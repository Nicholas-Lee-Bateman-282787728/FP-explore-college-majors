3466393,4,B001ARYYNG,"Colin Baker really did  a great job during this season of the classic doctor who show.  Any failings in these shows can be truly attributed to the bbc who was determined to kill the show.  The men in charge hated sci fi as surely as the people at NBC did in 1969 with star trek.  These are the type of men and women who look down on the whole genre.  John Nathan Turner (1947-2002, RIP) the shows producer during the 1980's,  cannot even be blamed for the shows demise or at least half the failings of the time , sure he tried many unfortunate things for the series. Like the garish clothes the doctor had to wear.  But he was faced with these terrible people who
had it in for him and the show.  In spite of all the struggles from that period, a inspired colin baker and some decent stories  came together to bring us a good season  of Doctor Who.
The dvd's themselves are well done here and they excellent.  I am grateful the bbc put these in a affordable boxset. They need to do much more boxsets as no other major tv series has been released this slowly.
And while they are at it they can finally put out a 'Doomwatch"" boxset too.",1227225600,2,1134,4.203703703703703
3466394,4,B001ARYYNG,"For anyone collecting DVD releases of classic Doctor Who, this nicely packaged box set is a rare, seldom-encountered oasis. Though there are good reasons and rationales for it, the normal release schedule can seem maddeningly random and haphazard at times. Such however is certainly not the case here with the 4-disc ""Trial of a Time Lord"" set, which includes all of 1986's season twenty-three in one complete and coherent whole. What a luxury, to watch an entire year of the show together in order! Of course, one key unfortunate factor making such an indulgence possible is that this season was radically (one might say brutally) scaled back and truncated by the allegedly apathetic if not hostile BBC hierarchy of the time: fourteen half-hour episodes, the old standard of twenty-six sliced right in half. The show was indeed literally on trial for its survival, and the fiction-mirrors-fact echo of the Doctor being put on trial by his own people is a deliberate and conscious one by the show's beleaguered creators. You might say that the postmodern self-reflexive '80's had finally caught up with Doctor Who, but the effect is poignant rather than ironic.

But yes, true to its title, the overall story arc encompassing the four individual tales of this season sees the Doctor on trial for reckless and capricious interference and meddling in timelines, and later even for genocide. With this good solid bit of courtroom drama as the frame, each individual tale then unfolds in classic Dickensian order as evidence presented to the court by the Doctor's belligerent prosecutor, the Valeyard (for a good clue as to his true identity, check out what his title means, and no, for once he's not the Master in disguise). First of all, from the Doctor's past we get to visit (or revisit?) ""The Mysterious Planet"", wherein he and Peri explore a distant world with two different regressed civilizations, one free and tribal, the other ruled with an iron hand by a control freak of a computer--a world that turns out to be impossibly familiar after all. This intriguing puzzler is the last full story by Robert Holmes, a longtime stalwart writer of the show responsible for many of its most memorable moments, and is worth its weight in gold for that reason alone. And quite good in its own right, too, an entertaining adventure replete with dry wit and given substance with thought-provoking ideas and concepts integral to the plot--typical Doctor Who in the best sense.

Next, from the Doctor's present we are shown ""Mindwarp"", which manages to deal with many chillingly disturbing grown-up themes like unethical medical experimentation and corporate economic exploitation in a compelling manner, playing with the viewer's mind in the process as we see the Doctor act in very uncharacteristically self-interested and even evil ways--or has the evidence been tampered with? To top it all off, Peri leaves the series in a dramatically grim fashion (Afterwards to be retroactively defused by a lame cop-out). From the Doctor's future, ""Terror of the Vervoids"" finds a later him and a future companion, Mel, aboard a space liner plagued with an ongoing series of murders and a serious weed outbreak. A traditional whodunit in a futuristic setting (the writers don't seem to realize they've effectively put ""Robots of Death"" and ""Seeds of Doom"" in a blender), this is Doctor Who by-the-numbers but there's little sin in being formulaic when the formula works so well. If the show is on trial, it might as well play to its strengths. Finally, ""The Ultimate Foe"" brings the Doctor's trial to a bizarre and perhaps less than fully satisfying conclusion. Rather disjointed due to the sad and tumultuous circumstances of its creation and marred by some deplorably cringe-inducing dialogue lines scripted for Mel, the final battle with the Valeyard in the eerily surreal computer-generated environment of the Matrix still has lots to offer besides inspiration for later Hollywood cyberpunk sci-fi blockbusters (or is it a coincidence?), and in the end offers us an old but reliable truth: we are often our own worst enemies.",1226361600,4,4112,5.054491899852724
3466395,5,B001ARYYNG,"So far, all the reviews have been about the actual 14-episode story on this DVD.  Let me start by quickly saying how much I love this season-long epic.  I know, I know...it has its flaws, it was riddled with behind-the-scenes turmoil which kept the story from really coming together onscreen, some of the trial scenes simply don't make sense, etc.....but I still love everything about it.  I've always loved Colin's portrayal of the Doctor and I think some of his best work is in this season.  He was obviously VERY happy to be back to work on the show he loved after a long hiatus.

But ""Trial of a Timelord"" has been written about a great deal, and other reviewers here have already given you very good reviews of the actual story.  My review, then, is about ""the rest of the story""....the DVD packaging of ""Trial"".

Which, by the way, is excellent.

Even if you don't love this season, you have to admit that this is one of the strongest collections of special features on any Doctor Who DVD.  What is most admirable here is that the team that puts together these DVDs did't shy away from the controversy that surrounded this season.  These features aren't ""Doctor Who Confidential"" styled pats-on-the-back.  The features show the good and the bad in equal measure.

Here are some of the highlights:

-  There's a ""making of"" documentary for each of the four stories that make up ""Trial"".  These are all really great, very entertaining and educational.  But the highlights are seeing Tony Selby and Brian Blessed talk about their time on the show.  They very obviously loved doing it.

-  There's a 55 minute documentary on Colin's time as the Doctor.  It goes into great details about the detioration of the relationship between John Nathan-Turner and Eric Saward, the hiatus, the reasons behind the ""Trial"" story, Colin's firing....its really good.  Its a very revealing, ""cards on the table"" type of discussion. Its amazing to see that even 25 years later, talking about this stuff is difficult for Colin.  Its also great to see Eric Saward talk about his role in alienating people who had been his friends and co-workers.

-  There's a short bit of commentary with Colin and Nicola watching the scene in Part 14 where the script, at JNT's urging, undoes Peri's death from Part 8 by saying she was living happily-ever-after with King Yrcanos.  While Nicola was aware that they'd done that....she'd never seen the scene in question.  Her reaction to it is pretty interesting.

-  There's a great documentary on what would have been Season 23 had the hiatus not happened and they'd gone on to do Colin's second season as planned. Most of this is pretty well known, and three of the stories were later released as novels.  But this is illustrated by new artwork, is narrated by Colin, and talks about each of the stories and the shape of the season.  Very enlightening.

-  There's a fun little half-hour piece on cliffhangers.  Authors, editors and scriptwriters talking about the show's cliffhangers -- which ones were great, which ones didn't work, which ones could have been brillian but weren't, etc.  A very fun piece.

-  There's a fairly substantial clip from a talk show after the end of the season that has a group of people from one of the DW fan clubs talking about the ""Trial"" season, and what a mess it was, and if fans couldn't follow it how could the general public?  So after a series of comments from each of them, the host says ""Well, now lets hear from the producer and the writers of this season"".  John Nathan-Turner and Pip & Jane Baker seemed genuinely caught off guard to learn that these people didn't completely love their work!  It's really interesting viewing.

All-in-all its a stellar package.  The sound in particular is cleaned up very nicely.  And the picture looks great.  There seems to be more contrast in the opening courtroom scenes, where the set looks a bit more darkly lit and moodier.  Even if I were't a fan of this season, I would probably give this DVD release of it 5 stars simply on the strength of the packaging, the extras, and the great lengths that the Restoration Team went to to bring us a very thorough and enlightening set.  Very well worth the money.  I highly recommend this set!",1223510400,88,4240,4.684281842818428
3466396,4,B001ARYYNG,"I actually really liked the sixth Doctor, and I realize that this puts me very much in the minority.  His portrayal of the Doctor was fresh, is arrogance taken to new heights.  This storyline, very reminiscent of War Games in scope and grandeur, was aiming for EPIC, and in many ways it succeeded.  The story and sets are engaging.  Collin is in top form.  Some of the storylines don't exactly end, or do so quickly and in ways that just seem off(the send off of a particualr character seems rushed).  Still, a very good episode, which left me riveted when I was younger and still does so today.  What a shame this Doctor's tenure ended so quickly.  Don't let his quirky outfit put you off, Collin is magnificent in the role....and keep a look out for tge Graveyard...I mean Valyard",1223424000,,782,4.535714285714286
3466397,4,B001ARYYNG,"Before Doctor Who Colin Baker was a very good actor, after Doctor Who Colin Baker was a very fine actor.  This is the only season, where he had a chance to be Colin Baker...JNT was to busy fighting for the survival of the franchise to get in his way any more.  What a shame that he couldn't have started here, and gone down as one of the great doctors instead of being constantly villified for JNT's failings.  Take a look at what is one if the few shining moment's in the series' waining years.",1221696000,5,495,4.24468085106383
3466398,2,B001ARYYNG,"Having owned Trial of a Time Lord on VHS for over a decade, plus having watched it when it debuted on U.S. Public Television, I feel qualified to comment on this epic, but ultimately disappointing season of Doctor Who.

Doctor Who, as many ""traditional"" fans have known, was placed on hiatus after Colin Baker's creditable first season in the role.  The Doctor and Peri Brown had begun to mellow as a time-travelling duo, and despite some complaints of ""graphic violence,"" the Sixth Doctor did not really become the ""Sith"" Doctor, or ""Dirty Harry,"" or the ""Psychotic Doc.""  Colin Baker later argued that his three year plan had been to make the ""alien"" role more likeable as time went on.  But early in 1985, BBC President Michael Grade decided to stop producing the show -- primarily out of personal dislike for the show -- which is well-documented in the press.

Fan outcry from around the world, and favorable British press, forced the BBC to reconsider their choice.  But the damage had been done.  Serious science fiction went out the window, to be replaced by the ""camp humor"" characterized by Tom Baker's 17th Season.  BBC heads insisted on these changes based upon TV watchdogs like Mary Whitehouse.  Season 23 would set the stage for the last four years of Doctor Who, making it difficult for Colin Baker's immediate successor to rise above the formula.

As for Trial of a Time Lord, it began on a somewhat high note, with fine model effects and a sense of foreboding.  But ""Mysterious Planet"" was not really a complete story, only the seeds of one.  The trial format kept any potential plot twists from developing.  Sabalom Glitz (Tony Selby) is one of Doctor Who's more interesting anti-heroes, but Glitz was the only highlight from a routine post-holocaust story.  Since this show had been written just as Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome was released, it's not very surprising.  There were also too many Monty Python touches for my liking.

Mindwarp represented the nadir of Doctor Who at this point -- although I might take pot-shots at some of Russell T. Davies' scripts for the new series.  Although it was nice to see Nabil Shaban reprise Sil from the previous season (""Vengeance on Varos""), he is overshadowed by the silly plot convention of switching Kiv's mind into Peri's body.  This concept had been exhausted by series like ""The Avengers"" and ""The Prisoner.""
Moreover, Colin Baker and Brian Blessed should have been restrained, as their acting broke the OTT meter.  I also got tired of belaboring the point of whether Peri survived the process, or whether she was killed.  The final outcome, with her marriage to Yrcanos, was hard to swallow.

Finally, we come to ""Terror of the Vervoids,"" which felt more like a story -- even if it mirrors ""Robots of Death.""  Honor Blackman was an inspired choice for Professor Laskey.  Excellent creature effects and startling revelations abound.  But the regular cast is somewhat let down by Bonnie Langford, who is quite a good stage actress for light comedy, but not for drama -- which Doctor Who, incidentally, falls under in the BBC.  Mel Bush makes the last six episodes rather hard to watch.

The last two episodes feel like a pastiche of two previous Gallifrey stories, ""Deadly Assassin"" and ""Invasion of Time,"" with very little new ground broken.  Although Michael Jayson's Valeyard is compelling, I agree that Anthony Ainley's role as the Master was under-employed in this last segment.  I never liked the idea of the Valeyard, to begin with.  Even with his surprise revelation in the Matrix, the Master feels as though he were added at the last minute.  Since this is the last scene we have of the Time Lords, before the new series exterminated them, it is not a very flattering view of the Doctor's people.  They deserved a better story.

As for Colin Baker, he also deserved much better treatment by the BBC, although it's all over but the crying.  He's gone on to greater things, and Sylvester McCoy, despite the odds, did a memorable turn on his own.
But ""Trial of a Time Lord"" is a poor transition between two Doctors.",1217548800,13,4088,4.810888252148997
3466399,4,B001ARYYNG,"You may or may not have of heard of or seen ""TRIAL OF A TIME LORD"" the 23rd season story which encompassed the entire season....but, before beginning let me take a moment to note the talent of genre writer & major Doctor Who contributor the late great Robert Holmes...the man responsible for most of the greatest ""Classic"" Doctor Who episodes ever written and also responsible for the TRIAL OF A TIME LORD 14 part story/concept.

Holmes either wrote or co-wrote the following Dr. Who classic stories, none of them forgettable, leastways not in concept: The Krotons, The Space Pirates, Spearhead from Space (which intros the 3rd Doctor), Terror of the Autons (which intros the Master!), Carnival of Monsters, The Time Warrior (which intros the Sontarans), Ark in Space, The Brain of Morbius (w/Terrance Dicks), Pyramids of Mars (w/L.Greifer), Deadly Assassin, Talons of Weng-Chiang (a fav of RTD), The Sun Makers, The Ribos Operation (intros Romana), The Power of Kroll, The Two Doctors and Caves of Androzani (the 5th Doctor's final appearance and considered to be the best story of the show's long history, certainly a fav of mine.)

TRIAL OF A TIME LORD's greatest strength, becomes it's greatest weakness...Robert Holmes was to write 8 parts of the 14 part story, the first and the last. His poor health, then death prevented him from completing the final 2 parts...completed by Pip & Jan Baker the story/season finale suffers for this loss! Following an already postponed season, this compounded the problem which ended the 6th Doctor's tenure without a proper regeneration story (unless you count the bewigged figure in ""Time and the Rani"").
As we see now a tighter continuity in the series is a preferable format...here we get a kind of CHRISTMAS CAROL format, via the Time Lord High Council we see the ""Accused"" a.k.a the Doctor's past/present/ & future while he defends his actions on the stand. Long time fans may question... ""has the Doc already been trialed and sentenced by the Time Lord, as seen in the final moments of `The War Games' in which the 2nd Doctor is punished for his interference, forced to regenerate, exiled to the 20th cen. Earth along with UNIT?"" Well, yes, he was and they did...but here we get pomp and circumstance and flashback and forward and lots of new crimes and accusations against the Doctor, even for things he has YET to do!!! (how cool is that one?) As a result the season can be packaged a 3 major stories with a common courtroom thread and 1 extended 2 part resolution : The Mysterious Planet...Mindwarp....Terror of the Vervoids...The Ultimate Foe.

The Mysterious Planet begins with one of the best openings of the shows history (a dare say better than even the 2005 series, too) as we see THE TARDIS drawn into a station where the trial is to be held. Gorgous, ever by today's standards. Soon we are drawn into flashbacks of the Doctor and Peri's last adventure, no not from last season, but an adventure new to the viewer. We watch along with the tribunal of Time Lords as the Doctor arrives on Ravalox (write it down, by episode 14 you may have lost your scorecard) 2 million years in Earth's future...(you might want to write that down, too). The Ravalox location is neat, `til we get to the old steel corridors beneath ruled by a mad robot, sorry. One thing Mysterious Planet has going for it...are characters typical of Robert Holmes' writing, like rascally fallible rogue Sabalom Glitz who plans to come into possession of the hidden secrets and advanced technology guarded by the robot, while of course falling underfoot of the Doctor's own plans. All the while important details are omitted from the story by the Time Lord prosecutor the VALEYARD, raising the Doctor's suspicions, as he cannot remember the events himself.

Then the adventure in the Doctor's present is reviewed in the story arc, which Holmes had the least to do with, called ""MINDWARP."" The VALEYARD continues to build a case against the Doctor showing his most recent adventure as evidence of guilt their activities on Thoros Beta immediately before the trial. We see the Doctor at first investigating arms sales; after he sees his old adversary SIL, he surmises that Thoros Beta is the home planet of Sil's race. We learn a scientist, Crozier is experimenting brain surgery on a local warrior-king, Yrcanos, played by the great Brian Blessed (fantastic!), before performing on SIL's mentor Kiv, played by the great Christopher Ryan (seen in season for as a Sontaran). The Doctor is shown as malevolent in this segment of evidence convincing him that the evidence has been tampered with, specifically his betrayal of Peri and Yrcanos. Also,  his capture by the Time Lord High Council appears to have resulted in Peri's death.

In the ""TERROR of the VERVOIDS"" a story of the Doctor's near future is presented as evidence against him. An interesting concept, including the introduction of a ""current"" companion who the Doctor has yet to meet, by our perspective anyway, Melanie or Mel, played by stage entertainer Bonnie Langford, and probably the most annoying companion this side of Tegan (seriously, you will go watch Timeflight and say, ""Wow, Tegan's not that bad.""). The pair, break from dieting long enough to answer a distress call from the Hyperion, space-cruise ship (hmm, where have I seen that before?). The ship is sabotaged & people become plant-food for the Vervoids, plant-like humanoids genetically engineered by Professor Lasky, played by the still lovely Honor Blackman. In the end, the Doctor, Mel, and Prof. Lasky succeed in preventing the Vervoids from reaching Earth, but upon admitting that no Vervoids survived, the Valeyard now charges the Doctor with genocide, oops.
Then in the final 2 parter the ULTIMATE FOE, the truth is revealed, and a chase into the very Matrix itself ensues (as seen in Holmes' Deadly Assassin), but first Mel and Glitz called as witnesses, even the Master shows up, appearing to aide in the Doctor's defence of all things!  The Ultimate Foe is revealed, and pretty cool idea it is, I won't say more, but pity it wasn't executed better, though.  All is explain, if less than adequately, how the Doctor was used as a scapegoat, and the Valeyard real involvement as more than just a prosecutor. The truth about Peri's death is also revealed in a weak exit for the companion (although no worse or less believable than Leela's exit). As I said in the end the truth is revealed, but with all the twists and turns of the 14 parter the most confusing is the very final moments of the story in which the Doctor leaves with Mel, the companion ""he"" has yet to meet.
But, for all it's flaws...once all is said and done, the TRIAL of a TIME LORD set, is a must have set for any Doctor Who fan.

3466403,5,B001ARYYNG,"Trial of a Time Lord really gave me a new look at Sixy, and I came out of this with a much greater appreciation for him.  The story was a bit disjointed, but that was done deliberately.  I think it could have been improved on, but hardly terrible.  Baker was not the issue at all.

It's pretty hard to imagine having to redo various parts after a writer death, your script editor quitting and the head of Drama at the BBC making decisions based on his biases (the guy didn't like Blackadder, so nuff said).

I rather like the idea of just throwing the new companion out there.

The special features are really great.  A huge number of them, and another reviewer was right in that on one the knives really come out and you get some true feelings; really unusual but appreciated.

3466405,5,B001ARYYNG,"Never got to see these before - really glad I ordered them! Colin Baker does an impressive job with very different roles - really liked Six and Peri's chemistry, and wish we could have seen more of Six and Mel. Really, really wish. (Well, there's always Big Finish, but still...)
The Mysterious Planet - That model shoot truly is impressive. I thought it had been added to - but that *is* the original! Would love to see more of Glitz and Dibber. The commentary in the episodes was a hoot - whatever did happen to the helmets of the people that Katrica calls underground dwellers? Heh heh heh! And, um, did any other story resolve Ravolox? Wow... Now that's really a lost thread - I mean, there is another episode in the new series where that planet's, er, where it should be... Hmmm.
Mindwarp was great  - loved the Tardis landing, and the unexpected tide. Great commentary as well. I have to agree with Nicola Bryant; I would have preferred the ending in this rather than what was said to have happened later in the trial. It was great acting after a great lead up, and would have given the Doctor some really good opportunities in following up with the Time Lords! Absolutely loved King Yrcanos (Brian Blessed) out-eccentricing the Doctor - ""Yrcanos... It's time... we found Peri...""  That was fun!
Terror of the Vervoids was a very good who-dunnit - don't want to spoil that one, and the Ultimate Foe - yet another set of episodes that raised more possible story lines.
All the episodes in Trial of a Time Lord could have very interesting to build on...
Loved this as the box set - really interesting seeing the behind the scenes here as well.

3466410,5,B001ARYYNG,"The Trial of the Time Lord---famous or infamous. Here are my thoughts.

First on the stories:

The Valeyard (so named so the Doctor can deride him demeaning nicknames) presents the case against the Doctor becoming by telling to the Doctor's visit to the planet Ravolox with Peri.

The opening shots of this adventure within the trial show how the Doctor and Peri's relationship has progressed. This Doctored had mellowed out through Season 22, but in this opener, he shows how really warm and kind he can be. It's a look at the type of Doctor, Colin Baker should have evolved into. He's caring, kind, but still tough and with a touch of the egotism that so defined the sixth Doctor. The relationship with Peri is very well-played throughout with great chemistry between Doctor and companion. Yet, there were reminders of where the relationship had come from with the Doctor's joking about Peri taking delight in the underground dwellers calling him, &amp;amp;quot;old one,&amp;amp;quot; and saying, &amp;amp;quot;I always knew there was an evil streak in you,&amp;amp;quot; calling to mind a more cringeworthy moment in Twin Dilemma.

The story a Robert Holmes story. No, it's not Caves of Androzani, the Ark in Space, or the Sun Makers, but it's still a Robert Holmes story which gives it a great quality with enjoyable characters and twisted baddies. The Rogueish double act of Glitz and Dibber are marvelous and pure Robert Holmes. There's also nice but not overdone use of humor.

The trial scenes are tiresome but this is a very nice story to kick things off. 8/10.

Mindwarp is a surprising story that stars out interesting, falters a bit and ends in a brilliantly dark way. Ultimately, what holds it together is a solid script, and four great performances.

Nabil Shaban returns for another run as Sil. Here, he's the secondary villain and mostly for comic effect, but every moment he's on the screen is a delight. The character is a forgotten highlight of the Colin Baker era.

Then there's Brian Blessed finally appearing on Doctor Who as King Yrcanos with his trademark bellows and over the top performance. It really works with Yrcanos being big blustering, lovable, but also big hearted as shown by his relationship with Dorff, an old comrade in arms who has become a victim of Crozier's experiments.

Then there's Peri. Nicola Bryant is fantastic in her last televised story. This is her best story and while there were many companions in the Classic run who had better runs, you have to go back quite a ways to find a companion who had a better story. She's able to bring a bit of reason and common sense to Yrcanos. Even though she believes the Doctor has betrayed her in Part Three, she saves his life. There's a certain wistfulness and sadness with the character, but we also have a far more mature Peri than when she first boarded the TARDIS. And her end in the episode is heartbreaking, and in its context is quite shocking.

Colin Baker's Sixth Doctor plays it close to the vest throughout and you wonder how much his brain has been effected by the events by Part One and how much is the Valeyard's editing. However, the courtroom performances are great. He goes from his poking fun at the Valeyard's name to shock and anger. Colin Baker is at his best with the heartbroken furious reaction to what happened to Peri. This story illustrates why Baker was one of the best actors to play the Doctor.

There are issues with this story including some weak cliffhangers, a silly plot point in Part Two with Peri trying to join the serving women, and a few other miscellaneous weak points. However the four big performances of this story help to rise above its faults to be a true classic story. 9/10

The third segment of, ""Trial of the Time Lord"" manages to mix a murder mystery along with an invasion of killer plant creatures.

The mystery was actually pretty engaging, and the Vervos plot leads to some moments of genuine terror. The Sixth Doctor is at his on-screen best, miles away from the Twin Dilemma. The Doctor is warm, funny, comforting when appropriate, and a very solid sleuth.

Mel is a nice change of pace in her debut story. While I understand she has a bit of reputation issue in her later stories, in this one, she's resourceful and manages to play well off Colin Baker's Doctor. At this point, the friendly relationship is a nice change of pace from a string of Companions who haven't quite trusted the Doctor, or who the Doctor didn't quite trust.

On the downside, the Vervoids look a bit silly by 1980s standards. There are several parts related to the overall trial narrative that don't make a lot of sense including this clip being from the Sixth Doctor's future. Still, this is a very strong and entertaining story. 8/10

Finally, we have the Ultimate Foe:

Some of the highlights of the story include the Doctor's ringing indictment of the High Council in Episode 1. Anthony Ainley turns in his best performance as the Master since Castrovalva. The revelation of the Valeyard is a great twist and a strong concept with Michael Jayston turning in an enjoyable performance. Tony Selby's return as Glitz is welcomed.

The script had problems, but given the bizarre nature of its formation, it's about as good as could be expected. The idea of the Valeyard never got realized its full potential, with him coming off more as a duplicate of the Master. The two part format of the finale didn't help matters. A three to four part script written by a single writer would have achieved a better result. Also, there are so many oddities and problems in continuity such as Mel's arrival from the Doctor's future to meet the Doctor before he met her. Probably the best thing that can be said for it is that all the various plot holes were grist for the mill for Big Finish's stable of writers, and launched plenty of novels, comic stories, and other spin-offs. 6/10.

Overall, I enjoyed the stories very much. I think the first three stories were probably the best run of consecutive stories since the Season 1 end to Season 15 run of Robots of Death, Talon Weng-Chiang, and Horror of Fang Rock. It's true that there were better in the eight interceding seasons but every ""City of Death,""  ""Earthshock,"" and ""Caves of Androzani"" were followed by much weaker stories. The first three were strong.

The extras are enjoyable with great details on the eightteen month rest. I liked the Lost Season feature too. It kind of illustrated that the BBC had a point when they said there was complacency on the show. Three of the five stories they had details on for the original Season 23 involved the return of past villains, and sounded like they'd give Timelash a run for campyness.  Of course, this doesn't justify the firing of Colin Baker who managed to be so far from complacement and put up a solid performance. As my wife has pointed out, firing Colin Baker made about as much sense as firing your waiter because your cook's making bad food.

At any rate, we also get the Doctors in Distress music video, and a nice retrospective on the sadly too short Colin Baker years.  A very good and enjoyable DVD set and relatively affordable for a Doctor Who DVD collection.",1429056000,3,7192,4.712350597609562

3466416,4,B001ARYYNG,"Withe the passage of time, Colin Baker's Dr Who has been undergoing some re-evaluation and it's all been going in a good way.  Once thought to be the beginning of the end in the 1980s, the sixth Doctor has now become a beloved favorite.  And The Trial of a Time Lord is clear enough reason why.  Absolutely the most ambitious undertaking in the history of Who, ""Trial"" is a season-long cliff hanger, with the Doctor on trial for his very life.  In the course of the run, he must review past actions, present actions and, (being a Time Lord) future actions.  Colin Baker rises to the occasion and turns in some very compelling performances.  Especially welcome, is his mellowed relationship with Peri.  They are really a terrific Dr and companion during this run.  -- Trial of a Time Lord is big and rich and ambitious.  It may not always hit on all marks, but the sheer scope of the idea, and the performance of Colin Baker as a Time Lord pleading for his life, makes all of this high-water entertainment.  If you haven't seen the sixth Dr in a while, or are new to Who-Dom, this huge undertaking is highly recommended.",1410480000,2,1119,4.522388059701493

I very much recommend the mythmaker Colin Baker documentary in which he tells exactly how he felt. Would not even be locked in to do a regeneration episode.

3466428,4,B001ARYYNG,"This box set contains the entire Season 23 of the show. It is the second and last season of Colin Baker, the sixth doctor. The Sixth Doctor is the most hated doctor of them all, but I like him, and he come in at sixth place in by top 11 doctors. That's better than the 10th, 11th, 2nd, 9th, and 8th doctors.

This was the first of the four ""Seasons of Doom"", as I call them. These were the seasons in between the 1985-1986 hiatus and the cancellation of the show in 1989. These seasons were full of mixed bags, except for the season 24. All of those stories were pretty bad.

The first story, The Mysterious Planet, starts off with one of the best model shots in all of Doctor Who. The Doctor is on trial for his life. Plucked out of time and space by the Time Lords, he is charged with transgressing the First Law of Time.
He must defend himself against the prosecution led by the sinister Valeyard.
  The Trial begins as the Time Lords review an adventure from the Doctor's recent past. The setting is Ravolox, where the Doctor and Peri find themselves caught in the conflict between a warrior tribe, a pair of intergalctic con men, and a god-like robot. But deep beneath the surface of the mysterious planet lie secrets that threaten the very fabric of the universe. And to protect them, drastic measures have been taken that will shock the Doctor to his very core.
  I would give this story 2.5/5 stars. Which is strange, considering this was written by Robert Holmes.

In the year 2986, the starliner Hyperion 3 makes its way to Earth... but all is not well. The Doctor and Mel arrive in response to a distress call, although not in time to prevent a murder. And this will not be the only death. Someone aboard will kill again and again to protect a secret.

When this series was released back in the 80's, there were many trials and tribulations occurring off camera, but this review will only be looking at the episodes in this series so let's get started.

1. The Mysterious Planet- I found this episode rather entertaining. The fact that this takes place on a post apocalyptic Earth was rather intriguing. All in all, this episode is a pretty good classic who episode.

2. Mind Warp- This episode is pretty good if you have seen Vengeance on Varos. This episode reintroduces Sil into the show. Now for the first two episodes it can be a little confusing, but from then on is an excellent example of the Doctors ability to manipulate.

3. Terror of the Varvoids- the only episode of this series that is boring. Not only boring, but because this episode takes place in the Doctor's future, confusing.

4 . The Ultimate Foe - I liked it, but I'm glad that it was only two episodes long.

There are plenty of special features on each disc, which I found very in-depth and interesting. The second episode in the series also features the controversial departure of Peri as a companion.

3466439,5,B001ARYYNG,"Inthe Colin Baker era doctor who season simply entitled ""Trial of a Time Lord"" yes that's right the entire season was simply called that. The Doctor has found himself confused and within a space station of some kind. Without any clues he enters and finds himself in a courtroom of the Time Lords. He meets a man called ""The Valeyard"" (Check out the special features of this set to find out what the name Valeyard means). There he accuses the Doctor of meddling in the affaris of other races throughout all of time and space. Enters the judge of what starts out as a simple inquiry into the Doctor behavior. Were given to scenes from the Matrix that shows The Doctor and Peri on a planet called Ravalox. For Peri she doesn't understand why they are on this planet. The Doctor tells her that Ravalox is so simliar to Earth in just about every compostion its not possable. Meanwhile The Doctor and Peri are not the only travelrs to the planet. They are being followed by two mercenaries named Sabalon Glitz and his assocate the young Dibber (For extra points Glitz say a familiar catch phrase spoken often by The Brigader later in the first few episodes). While Glitz and Dibber are tracking them The Doctor and Peri stumble upon a cave that has an escalator. Peri begins to think that Ravalox might really be Earth. The Doctor thinks its just a fluke that another species created the escaltor. Then Peri finds an old tube station sign. The Doctor now thinks Peri's theroy might be right and requires further investiagtion. His searching of the immeadiate area has found a sealed door into some kind of facility. Peri on the other hand want nothing to do with his search and wants to mourn the loss of Earth.
The Doctor discovers that inside is some kind of bunker that was desgined to safeguard something or someone. Peri has been taken captive by a primative warrior who was also spying on the cave. The Doctor encounters those that live the strange bunker and discovers it is called ""UK Habitat"" and ruled by a creature called ""The Immortal One"" in reality a robot called Drathro a mark 4 robot build by man and desgined to keep a certain number of humans alive and working until such times as it recives new orders from its makers. However Drathro is coming to the end of its use as its power source is now malfuncting and its power antenna is worhsipped on the surface as a totem by the primatives.  Drathro trying in vain to save himself demands the Doctor repair its power source or watch as it destroys the habitat and the planet itself. Will the Doctor be able to stop this robot gone mad? Will he figure out why Earth is where Ravalox should be or is it the other way around? What does Glitz and Dibber want with what Drathro is keeping hidden? More questions then answers all this and the fact that the Doctor is still on a space station.
The Valeyard showing the first example of the Doctor's behavior during the Ravalox situation shows the Doctos latest adventure with Peri to the planet Thuras Beta Minor a planet in which the Doctor tries to find who made the weapon that was given to a race of primative warriors and nearly wipped out. While wading through the purple ocean they stumble upon a yet another cave and within a device that controls the tidal volume that helps generate power for some reason. They are soon attacked by a strange creature and while escaping further into the caves encounter guards. There holding the same weapons as the one the Doctor discovers they take him and Peri to meet the Mentads the rulers of the planet the true masterminds behind the weapons and other things. It is discovered that Sil (Vengance on Varous) is on the planet and is thrilled to see the Doctor and Peri again devices ways to make the Doctor yeild his secerts as a time lord. Meanwhile Sil's leader is dying his vast mind expanding and has hired the aid of famed scientist Krozian. Krozian has develpoed a way to continue on by placing ones brain into another. However those slaves he has do not fit his requirments. He's even interested in what the Doctor has to say on the matter. Even more he does like the shape of Peri's head.  The Doctor also meets Yarconas (Brian Blessed) a warlord from another world kidnapped and meant to be gentically altered so that he will stand down and let his eneimes take his lands. His best freind and fellow warrior turned into a part man part canine creature. The Doctor is in the middle of some heavy stuff with Sil at his back. A scientist that wants Peri at any costs and a warlord that wants to crush the strange slug like creatures and thier wicked weapons.
With the events of the Valeyards evidence given it is the Doctor's turn to give his evidence. He shows the court of a future adventure. The doctor begins by showing a luxruy linear being loaded with minerals and resources and passangers as well to Earth. On board A group of scientists have requested a large portion of the hold for some unknown reason and that no light be allowed in.  Meanwhile the Doctor along  with his new companion Melaine or Mel are enjoying a brisk exercise routine when they get a signal from the ship requesting help. Materalizing in the hold they are captured by the security officer and taken to the Commadore. A man who the Doctor has encountered before and knows when the Doctor is around bad things beign to happen. However he also knows that he is the only one who can get to the bottom of who sent the signal and why a passenger is going missing. Meanwhile someone is lurking  within the part of the hold that is off limits with the scientist cargo. However thanks to this the crago begins to move and things begin to go from bad to worse.

3466440,5,B001ARYYNG,"From the very first 15 minutes, I was beginning to become disappointed. The story is extremely predictable, and very easy to know what is going to happen next without having seen it before. This story has the Doctor on trial for his interference with other planets, and putting his assistants in constant danger. Who is behind it all, well that would spoil it for you. Hence, the story actually uses other stories to tell the one long story (overly so, in my opinion. The last disc is only 2 episodes, very disappointing in that I was expecting a longer end story/conclusion. There is also a very interesting developments at the end of the story.

3466441,4,B001ARYYNG,"This a great boxed set for any hardcore Who fan and has no shortage of special features not to mention the longest story on DW history. It is true that JNT could have done a better job with the series and this season, but keep in mind that Doctor Who must always be changing and evolving. The sixties were great but nothing compared to the incredibly awesome seventies(particularly the Tom Baker/Phillip Hinchcliffe era.) The show has to change and stay fresh and like it or not the JNT period did produce some wonderful episodes. Caves of Androzani,Warriors of the Deep,and Keeper of Traken to name a few. Everything can't be as good or as timeless as the Tom Baker years. How can you compete with Genesis of the Daleks or Horror of Fang Rock. Even the new series which has huge faults will occasionally put out something really terrific like Midnight(one of the 10th Doctor's finest.) Getting back to Trial of a Time Lord, which I might add has the second best intro/music of the entire show's history in my opinion. If you're a real fan than there is no question that you have to buy this boxed set and most likely enjoy it. Mysterious Planet and The Ultimate Foe are both good solid stories but Mindwarp is the real gem. It has a compelling and very dark story and might be Colin Baker's finest episode. It also has a huge treat for those of you that love I Claudius, one of the BBC's finest productions. That's right, I'm talking of coarse about the great larger than life Brian Blessed. As for Terror of the Vervoids, it SUCKS! It might be DW's worst story ever. I cannot understand what Eric Saywood(sorry if I'm mispelling his name but I don't feel like looking it up) saw in the terrible writing team of Pip And Jane Baker. And why, besides Robert Holmes, did they never bring on writers from the show's early years? I never understood that. That's what really did in poor Colin Baker. He was a really good Doctor and had the potential to be a great Doctor but the writing was usually bad in that period. So besides the one crappy episode my advice for any true Who fans is to buy the damn thing, put it in the DVD player and ENJOY! Thanks for reading my review and I hope you found it helpful.",1255910400,2,2203,4.428571428571429
3466442,4,B001ARYYNG,"I like Colin Baker's Doctor. His episodes seemed more action packed, more confrontational, probably more ""American"".
The first story, Mysterious Planet, and the last story, where the Doctor confronts the Valeyard in the Ultimate Foe, are the reasons to buy the DVD. Especially the latter episode, which is tense, very well written, and well acted by Colin Baker, while still being totally over the top. One of my favorite Doctor Who episodes.",1252713600,,442,5.152777777777778
3466443,1,B001ARYYNG,"When Doctor Who was put on hiatus for eighteen months, they had already started work on the next season, which included the return of the Celestial Toymaker, Sil, the Ice Warriors and the Autons. Instead, John Nathan-Turner decided to do the Trial storyline to reflect the fact that Doctor Who was on trial, putting out a season where the Doctor was on trial for violating the First Law of Time wnd written by several writers. Considering the bad stories and the hodgepodge ending where the Valeyard escaped and the Doctor goes off with Mel, who he hadn't even met yet. I wish that they had used the ending where the Doctor and the Valeyard were trapped in the Matrix, then used the next season to not only resolve this, but also have the Doctor and Mel meet properly and perhaps see if Peri and Yrcanos were living happily ever after.
 They should also have fired JNT because Trial is the culmination of the decline of Doctor Who because of not only increasingly violent stories, but also a poor characterization of the Sixth Doctor. Hopefully, a new producer would have reversed this trend and perhaps Doctor Who might not have been cancelled. However, this was not to be and the show was cancelled until 2005.",1247184000,9,1212,4.663551401869159
3466444,5,B001ARYYNG,"This is a great departure story for the 6th Doctor. to bad the best is the last time we see the dreadful rainbow coat of the Doctor and the most sexy and pretty companion of all classic series, PERI!
 The Concept of put on Trial The Doctor is a very good one, especially when you see the past Doctors and the relation he have with the other Time Lords, I feel this was more like a Tom Baker Story than a Colin Baker Doctorm, but that's history. The only low is the new companion Mel Bush, she felt out of place and we never new how she came to be a companion in the first place, and why put on trial the doctor in a space station , why not Gallifrey?, only John Natan Turner knows?
 But overall , the box set is great, the stories are the best in the Colin era and the Features are priceless, ecah DVD have some great features, especially the last one, and the chessy 80's video Doctor Who in Stress is priceless!",1245024000,4,913,4.094972067039106

3466446,3,B001ARYYNG,"I was anxious for this DVD set.  I had preordered this set the moment it had been made available.  So when it comes in I popped it right in and began watching it.
Where I think Colin Baker was a good Doctor the over all story was a bit confusing.  I don't want to give away spoliers but if you blink you might lose something along the way.
What really was GREAT about this set was the extras.  Every disc is packed with great stuff about the making of this story and what was going on behind the scenes with the Doctor at the time.
So if you like The Doctor then this is a set for you.  If you are a fan of the overall story of Doctor Who and how it was all made then this set is essential!
For me I give it three stars as I found some of the story confusing but I LOVED the extras.",1240012800,5,782,3.8322981366459627
3466447,4,B001ARYYNG,"I'm a Doctor Who chump and would give a least two stars to anything Doctor Who. But I liked this series more than most. It seemed like Colin Baker felt really comfortable at this point. Most of the stories in this series are done well. It is just the last episode that leaves me flat. It felt ruched and awkward. SPOILER ALERT- How they brought the story to an end with another incarnation of the Doctor on paper sounds good. In execution it went badly. The Doctor has an evil incarnation, great. Now give me more details. The Matrix scenes seem like an afterthought. This is worth getting if you are a big fan but I would choose other episodes first to add to my collection.",1235433600,,675,4.365079365079365
3466448,4,B001ARYYNG,"Trial of a Timelord isn't remembered as one of the best season ever of classic Who, but it's definitely not the worst.  The entire season was made of 3 stories presented as evidence at a trial against the Doctor and a 2-part conclusion.

This was Colin Baker's last season, and the first after an 18-month hiatus, so a lot of the bonus material deals with those events.  During this time, a single and a video were released to show support of the show, and the video is included as is much archived news footage.

There are the usual ""making of"" specials that highlight each story.

For this season, producer John Nathan-Turner requested yet another re-imagining of the show's signature tune.  Dominic Glynn did this work but since he had just started to build his studio, he considered the version that aired incomplete.  Here, he has a chance to remix the tune which is available here as a video playing over a re-worked version of this season's opening graphics.",1232841600,10,965,4.708333333333333

8279281,1,B001ARYYNG,"As a true Dr Who fan, I  was excited about this set.  I  adore The Key To Time,  and looked forward to another season-long story arc.  However,  Trial of a Time Lord is tedious and boring.  The first adventure is bland.  I  really didn't care what any of the characters were doing.  The two geeks were corny.  The robot was uninspired.  And of course,  we're saddled with Peri.  Annoying and whiney.  Sarah, Leela, and the Romanas were pro-active.  Peri just stumbles around.  And the ""actress"" is awful.  Every line is delivered in the same ""are we there yet?"" tone...The next adventure is uncomfortable to watch.  The characters are all shallow and evil.  The aliens are gross and laughable.  Brian Blessed  (one of my favorites--Cabot Rowlan, Mentor from Space: 1999, Vargas from Blakes 7,  Flash Gordon, etc) is incredibly annoying and OTT here.  How did he bounce his head like that without a stroke?  And, again, Peri...Plus, THIS story has no conclusion!  Then, out of the blue, we have Terror Of The  Vervoids.  Coherent,  fun, engaging, traditional, neat sets, and Honor Blackman and Michael Craig!  And I'll take Mel over Peri anyday!  The two-part finale looks like something lifted from the Prisoner.  It tries SO HARD to be edgy and ends up being boring.  The scenes with the desk clerk go on forever...Peri married the barbarian king???  My set is the Tardis VHS boxed set.  I  plan to get Vervoids on DVD, and ditch the balance.  Again, I  am an avid classic Dr. Who fan.  Cannot hold a candle to 99% of other stories.  No other Dr. Who bores me.  Finally,  Colin Baker is an excellent actor,  but his wardrobe undermines his dignity.  (Jon Pertwee nailed it.) Why did they dress Colin like a circus clown?",1520726400,,1721,4.688135593220339

8279283,5,B001ARYYNG,"This is the entire 23rd season (4 stories) in one set. Overall the stories are pretty good and Colin Baker provided a strong performance through all the stories. The Doctor is summoned to appear at a trial which in which 4 of his adventures are used in evidence. A new theme song and one of the most expensive model shots ever done on Doctor Who up to this point greeted viewers to this epic. The story of the trail is intertwined through out the 4 separate adventures. (No spoilers in this review)

The first story in this set is ""The Mysterious Planet"". A strong story written by Robert Holmes in which the Doctor unravels the mystery of the planet Ravolox.

The second is my favorite story, ""Mindwarp"". The Doctor visits Thoros Beta and must stop the dangerous experiments taking place there.

The third story is ""Terror of the Vervoids"", A new companion, Mel, is introduced in a unique way by just appearing without the traditional introduction. This is a murder mystery style of story which was pretty well done.

The last story is the weakest of the set. ""The Ultimate Foe"" is a two episode story featuring the Master and takes place within the Matrix.

Overall, the season is pretty enjoyable and I found the trial setting to be a good method of linking the stories together.",1493596800,,1282,4.629955947136564

8279286,4,B001ARYYNG,"The hiatus left what looks like a massive cut to the Doctor Who show's budget in its wake. This season is all of 14 half hour episodes. The 18 month hiatus and a returned in this limited format made the show end for me when I was a boy. I was a casual fan. It was easy to stumble on the 6th Doctor stories on Saturday evening when there were 13 hour long episodes. That was equal to a 26 episode season. When the show did return, I wasn't aware of it and my likelihood of stumbling across it was almost nil since it was on nearly half the time it once was. I imagine other casual fans not located in the UK did the same thing.

What is cut from this season is any kind of adequate introduction for Mel.  Also the format can get really irritating. I would have liked the stories to have run their course and the Trial of a Time Lord to be the season finale. Instead we see the stories after the fact, we doubt the authenticity of what is shown because that is something that comes up in the trial, and frankly, the bouncing of back and forth from one story to the other wrecks the flow of it all. I rationalize this as the writers having too much to offer in a shorter period of time as planned. The Ultimate Foe is the season finale we expected to see but if the show was 26 half hour long episodes, would the trial have been just the finale? The same format would have worked for 4 episodes caped with the Ultimate Foe. But alas......

Glitz makes his debut in The Mysterious Planet. The funny, playfully shady character makes return appearances later in this season and in Ace's debut for the 7th Dr story Dragonfire.

Peri's fate is and is not explained convincingly in this season. I chalk that up to time constraints.

A common complaint of the John Nathan Turner era of the Doctor Who series was violent scenes that went beyond what they believed was the standard for children's entertainment. This complaint goes back to the 5th Dr stories but it carried on in Season 22 with the 6th Dr. I was a boy watching that, the scenes didn't really come across as anything worse than what was on regular cable. The difference did exist and gone are scenes of guards falling into acid baths, Cyberman trying to claw through plastic wrap to get out of their cocoon's in a close up shot of just head and shoulders, stabbings, and killing a bad guy with a cyanide soaked rag across the face. I guess it did need to be toned down a little. I don't think machine gun firing appeared again until Delta and the Bannermen, Remembrance of the Daleks and Battlefield. The guns fired were out in the open unlike in Caves of Androzani and Revelation of the Daleks which made their sound and use much more alarming.

This season has aged very well because there is precious little of the 6th Doctor to enjoy on screen so it is good to many people including myself despite the limitations of budget, time which affected the cohesion.",1487635200,,2916,4.341284403669725

In many ways, this was the beginning of the end for the original series, and a very important turning point in Doctor Who history.  Viewers get to see the way cliff-hangers were portrayed back them, with a glimpse of how plots are interwoven now.  Colin was not one of the more popular Doctors, but this season is well worth watching.
