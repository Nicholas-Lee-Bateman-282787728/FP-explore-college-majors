8203805,5,B000S1KX6M,"To all of the imbeciles out there giving these DVDs 1-star reviews, shame on you.  You'd think the French writing on the box would be a clue.  Don't make French-speakers pass up even looking at these DVDs just because YOU didn't pay enough attention.",1341360000,,250,4.659090909090909
8203806,1,B000S1KX6M,Might have been nice to know the movie was in French!  I did not think to scroll down to the product details (in smaller print) to see if the movie I was purchasing..the title of which is completely English...was in FRENCH! My daughter has Autism and now I am trying to explain why this movie she wanted is in another language!  Please be sure to note the language of a movie in the first few lines.  What a disappointment.,1200182400,2,423,4.329113924050633
