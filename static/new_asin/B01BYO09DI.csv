7670848,5,B01BYO09DI,"I refuse to read/watch the 'original' bc it's RAPE CULTURE, so I don't even know what the jokes are based off of and I can't stop laughing!",1461024000,,139,4.185185185185185
7670849,2,B01BYO09DI,"""Are you stalking me, Mr. Black."" Hannah Steale (Hawk) is a college student that helps her roommate by interviewing a billionaire named Mr. Black (Wayans). Slowly a relationship begins to build, but Mr. Black isn't like most men, then again neither is Hannah. I have to start off by saying that I have seen enough of the Wayans' brother spoof movies to not be excited about this one. Haunted House 2 was terrible and I was expecting more of the same from this. While this movie was better, it still wasn't that good. Unlike the last few movies they have done though this one is more of a mock then a spoof, in the vein of Hot Shots. Rather then just piecing together parts of different movies to try and be funny, this one sticks to the Fifty Shades of Grey story and really just takes it in a more ridiculous direction. There were a few parts where I smiled and even a few where I laughed out loud, but there are still scenes in this that go on way too long with a joke that isn't funny to start with. Many people may like this one, but as for me it just felt forced and tried too hard to be funny, and failed. Overall, another Wayans' spoof that falls flat. I give this a C-.",1460937600,3,1177,4.212389380530974
7670850,1,B01BYO09DI,"I love comedies and spoofs by the Wayans brothers so this pains me to give this film one star. Honestly, this film is downright painful and the laughs are few and far in between. I think the issue has to do with the fact that the Wayan brothers really shine when they work as an assemble. They don't seem to have success when they work separately. The editing seems off as well because the jokes are poorly timed that it doesn't give the audience an opportunity to react and laugh because of its poor execution. Everything and every scene seemed dragged out and just grasping at the very tips for laughter and it just doesn't succeed here. If you are a eight year old kid and haven't seem many comedies and movies are a new experience since one is so young, this might appeal to you. But for experienced movie goers who have seen everything from A - Z, this just comes off cliched and DONE. Its been seen before. The skits have been done and there's no NEWNESS.

Perhaps maybe actual nudity could have saved this film, but even that is not a guarantee. With such a small budget, i doubt any of the stars are down for showing any skin. At least if there were tons of nudity, audiences can be honest and say that the nudity and sex saved the film, but there is none of that here. I will give Marlon an A for effort though.",1460419200,7,1320,4.28
7670851,5,B01BYO09DI,"In choosing to ignore this movie the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ignited a cultural firestorm leading to calls for more diversity among its Oscar hopefuls.  As such, FIFTY SHADES OF BLACK will be remembered as one of the most important and influential films of the 21st Century, deservedly so.  Soon to be available on blu-ray, this is a picture that not only entertains but also educates; it imparts a lesson to us all.",1456790400,4,436,4.723684210526316

7670854,2,B01BYO09DI,"This is an urban spoof of the film ""50 Shades of Grey."" As expected the humor is crude. The jokes were hit and miss. The film seems forced as if they were rushed to get the film on tape and didn't bother to develop their jokes, instead relying on crude humor. Not nearly as good as Marlon Wayans' other works. There are some good lines, but not enough to carry the film.

Florence Henderson as the music teacher (in one of her last performances) is shockingly brilliant. MRS. BRADY! Jane Seymour as the adoptive mother is a completely casual racist -- we all know someone just like her.

This movie pokes fun at and laughs openly at a whole pile of racial stereotypes while taking the SM theme seriously. Mostly. I know people who have had the ""lost the key"" moment. That scene plays like their worst nightmare. The ""welcome to my world"" scene is really NOT all that far off the mark. Put a cell phone in her hand rather than knitting needles and you have something I've personally SEEN at parties I attend.

Was the movie on the ridiculous side? Yes. But, given the crap they were parodying, they didn't have much to work with.
I love that they picked up on the stalking and abuse of the original. Because it's true.
The fact that Mr. Black was torturing Hannah by reading the original book was funny. Because James' version is torture...and not in a good way.
I love that he asked if a 3rd grader wrote it. My answer: you'd think a child wrote it. But, I honestly think that a 3rd grader has better writing skills.
The part that made me LOL?
The 1st meeting at the elevator. Dead on: ""Hannah"". And, as Hannah says "" Christian"", the elevator doors closed on her face.
On, how I wish that had happened in the original book and movie.
This parody did go a touch over the top but pretty much knew that this is how a lot of people see the original book and movie: inaccurate, one dimensional, sad, pathetic, laughable and for the brain dead.

The acting was overly painful to watch and the story made no sense... Right down to the random magic Mike scene seemingly tossed into the middle.... Please do not waste your money...

I struggled & strained to sit through the entire thing. I don't think I laughed once while watching it. I might have grinned, smiled, or smirked, but I never truly laughed. I know I spent the majority of the time cringing. I watch anything and everything the Wayans put out and usually find them funny. White Girls did suck but it didn't suck as bad as 50 Shades Of Black did. The funniest thing about  50 Shades Of Black was the trailer. It's what made me really want to see it. Maybe if I would've seen 50 Shades Of Grey or even read the book (I have NO interest in doing either) before watching this, I might have enjoyed this movie or liked it but even then I really don't think so. There were so many parts where they just tried way too hard to get a laugh (Like the belly button scene for example. See what I mean?) I'm a BIG fan of potty humor but here it was WAY too overdone & the only thing it made me do was feel awkward. The only way I can see anybody finding 50 Shades Of Black funny is if they're high on drugs or completely drunk.

It just kind of dragged on, and a couple of the scenes fell flat.  That is why can not give it more than three stars.  It was a really good spoof.  I'm not a huge fan of the Fifty Shades franchise, but it's certainly was humorous. It is definitely  not appropriate for young viewers at all.

There are MANY silly/stupid jokes in this movie and they are placed back to back in an almost rapid fire fashion. Some jokes go far beyond the point of being funny. **SPOILER** The scene where the girl is handcuffed with her arms up and Black looses the handcuff keys stops being funny after the second attempt to unlock them, yet the scene goes on for another few minutes. The white chick acting like a black chick stole every scene she was in. I wanted to see more of her. If any producers, directors, etc are reading this review, please DO NOT make a movie around this character. The Black White lady worked in this movie because she was the relief from everything else that was going on. A movie featuring the character would get old fast. Great, now that I've spoken it, it'll happen. Oh well.

Black, is erotic, sexy edgy and funny at the same time. Perhaps some found the kinky extended sex scenes a bit over the top. Others were just
Waiting for Marlon to do this kind of movie, where he can exploit his sexuality all the way.
