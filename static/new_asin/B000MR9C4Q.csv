While watching it I sometimes feel I'm lying on the floor of our long gone family room, head popped up by hands, staring in wonder when I was 10 at these shows CBS randomly put on in the 1970s. And I have my 10-year-old watching with me hoping he'll get something from it.",1385078400,,442,4.337349397590361
8171150,5,B000MR9C4Q,"This is a nice box set with 3 animated movies for TV made in the late 1970-s by Hanna Barbera studios. The 3 titles are Black Beauty, Gulliver's Travels, and The Last of the Mohicans. They run about 47 minutes each without the commercials. Each movie comes in it own DVD case, and the 3 are in a slipcover cardboard case. Black Beauty is a classic story, the tale of a horse in England who has many negative experiences before finding love in a new owner. The script moves along pretty well, the animation is standard fare for TV.
Gullivers Travels, not to be confused with the older musical Fleisher Studios version, is the well known tale of a man that is shipwrecked on an island, only to find himself prisoner of a race of tiny people called Lilliputions. Good voice acting in this one, decent animation and character design.
The Last of the Mohicans. In frontier America, a half Indian scout heads up a group that is relocating the daughters of a British officer in wartime.
The DVDs played well in both of our players at home, no freezing or other issues. The image looked cleaned up or remastered. These films are a great way to introduce kids to the classic books these films are based on.",1271635200,,1197,4.495412844036697
