4306840,5,B004AC6PN0,"This video is our 2-year-old daughter's new favorite! She asks to watch the ""pirate adventure"" and sings along when they count. She went from counting 1-2-3 to counting all the way to 13. She has trouble saying ""fourteen"" so she skips it and counts to sixteen. Now, she counts everything she encounters and I love it. I had tried to make counting fun but this video has beat me by leaps and bounds. It's entertaining and educational. Just for reference, her favorite video before this one was Leapfrog's Letter Factory. She still watches that one but prefers Numbers Ahoy. I've ordered Amusement Park Alphabet to give her for her 3rd birthday in March.",1297728000,2,652,4.778761061946903
4306841,5,B004AC6PN0,"The reviews for the other math Leapfrog videos (Math Circus, Math Adventure to the Moon) were mixed so I decided to give this one a try the day it came out and I am glad I did. This DVD is ideal for toddlers and preschoolers who are learning to count and recognize numbers. My daughter (who recently turned 2) was having a hard time learning 13-20 and this DVD helped her a lot--in just a week she has gone from mixing up all of the ""teens"" to reliably counting to 20. It also introduces the concept of 0 and early math skills like relative size and estimating (small/medium/large) and that when you have two groups of 10 it all adds up to 20 when you count it out.

The DVD extras were great for this title too. It has all 4 songs available as stand alone sing-alongs which is great because your child hears the number, sees it counted out, sees the numeral in the background, and sees the numbers and words to the song spelled out at the bottom of the screen. It also includes an extra song sung by Scout the Puppy, two cute read-along sing-along vowel shorts (short a and short i) and a great song about rhyming from Alphabet Amusement Park.

I strongly disagree with the review that said this video was up to par with other leapfrog videos. My daughter likes it just as much as the Letter and Word Factory DVDs. I don't think it's the MOST upbeat Leapfrog title but it is fun and the songs are great. She loves the Fish Counting song and sings it all the time now. The story and songs are also interesting enough that I think even a more advanced preschooler who can already count to 20 would still enjoy watching it, especially with a younger sibling or friend.",1296172800,80,1666,4.336538461538462
4306842,5,B004AC6PN0,"If you are your kids don't like the new redesign and style for these videos that began with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LeapFrog-Let-s-Go-to-School/dp/B002BJGYJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LeapFrog: Let's Go to School</a>, then feel free to skip. If, however, you or your kids still enjoy these videos then, ""Numbers Ahoy"" is another excellent release with a lot to love.

""Numbers Ahoy"" was released along with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LeapFrog-The-Amazing-Alphabet-Amusement-Park/dp/B004AC6PXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LeapFrog: The Amazing Alphabet Amusement Park</a>. As far as bonus content goes, everything included on this DVD is pretty much the same as ""Amusement Park"" and I already reviewed it for that one, so I'll just note that this DVD also includes its own set of useful commentaries by one of LeapFrog's educational consultants and also heavily features the new character, Scout the puppy.

In this DVD, Tad & Lily want to play a board game called Numbers Ahoy, but find it problematic because it requires a lot of counting. Their big brother Leap teaches them the basics of the game, but they're still in trouble because they only know a bit of basic counting. So Edison uses his green learning stone to take them under the sea, where there are fun opportunities for counting fish and more.

Unfortunately, there are also pirates floating about the sea, one of them being Pirate Pythagoras, who is scooping up any animal from the sea he can find in order to count them. When Scout ends up being one of the animals scooped up, Tad, Lily and Edison launch a mission to rescue him and encounter some surprising help.

Along the way, they learn to count as high as twenty. They also learn about things such as estimation and about developing an instinctive ""number sense"" to tell them whether a particular number is higher or lower than other numbers. Much of it is presented through song, generally pretty catchy. The video also teaches other more general, pro-social skills as well (i.e. playing games fairly.)",1295654400,42,2124,5.607476635514018

4306857,2,B004AC6PN0,"I own all of the LeapFrog DVD's.  The Numbers Ahoy movie is decent at best but by far my least favorite.  There is too much backstory and not enough learning factor as compared to say Letter Factory, Numberland or Shapeville Park.  The movies starts off slow and I found myself waiting for those beloved LeapFrog learning songs.  While it does help kids learn, it left a lot to be desired.  Overall, I would skip this one and buy their other DVD's.  On a side note, I know a lot of people complained about the DVD's not playing correctly...I had no issues with playback.",1469836800,3,570,4.485436893203883
4306858,4,B004AC6PN0,I like the Leapfrog series ONLY because my son enjoys them so much.  I however do not think they are particularly educational and that is how they advertise themselves.  I think their advertisement is completely deceptive.  I can't imagine that any child would actually learn anything from these videos.  They are just an excuse that a parent can use to plop their child in front of a video without having to feel guilty.  Children will learn their numbers more quickly and remember them more effectively by engaging in real-world counting examples on a daily basis.  The characters are cute and not annoying which is a plus.,1468195200,,625,4.849056603773585

Bought is since the old Leapfrog videos are amazing (Letterfactory, Talking Words Factory). Can't get past the Stupid whiney new voice they gave Tad in the new videos. Its like a whiney d-bag surfer voice. Horrible. And it also bothers me they say things like ""fishies"" as the plural form instead of fish. Seriously!?",1421884800,,410,4.871428571428571
4306899,2,B004AC6PN0,"We really enjoy the Letter Factory series. This is too distracting with the story/plot, rather than focusing on the counting. I was also disappointed that they had to have a ""bad guy"". For little kids who have conservative, minimal tv watching and are not regularly exposed to what's on today's tv cartoons, it was very scary for my 4 1/2 year old (he was also scared of the big 'monster' snowman on Frozen - if that gives you an idea of what disturbs him). He was even disturbed by the sharks and their teeth falling out.

I wish there was a similar counting dvd as the Letter Factory - where an elaborate mix of story line is not needed. Wish they would just COUNT in this dvd. We also tried the Space Math/Counting dvd, which we found more able to tolerable than the pirates (I had to take the pirate dvd out as it was too upsetting to my son before we finished it). The space one has a ""star storm"" where the characters became panicked, which was also upsetting to my son. He cannot determined what is real or made up at his age, especially when what he's exposed so far in life has been simple/real life experiences or nature in general.",1421798400,,1142,4.36150234741784

Well, it wasn't bad and she was interested but I guess she was too young for the actual story.

There was lots of counting to 10 and only one small scene where they go beyond ten into the teens.  1-30 would be more helpful I think, but even that would have been kind of lame.  I would only recommend this video to very young kids- 2 or maybe 3 year olds.  Even then, you'd probably be better off just counting Cheerios or stuff around your house. There isn't any ""math"" and the story itself is slow and, frankly, boring.  My kindergartener loves all her other Leap Frog DVDs, but never asks to watch this one.

I've seen probably all of the Leap Frog videos and this Numbers Ahoy is one of my and the kids' favorites. A video to invest in... It gets the kids' counting to 20, estimating the which amount of teeth go in which shark and as they are counting to ten teeth or twenty under-water crabs, the children improve their number recognition. A great supplement learning video for those times you need a few minutes to yourself and want something EDUCATIONAL that they'll enjoy.",1335398400,,548,4.65979381443299

4306978,4,B004AC6PN0,"My son loves this movie and likes counting along with Tad, Lilly, and Edison.  But for concerned parents, there are a few things you should realize:

1.  This movie seems to focus a little more on the plot with counting mixed in, rather than being solely about counting (the way Phonics Farm is solely about letters and their sounds).  So in terms of sheer educational content, this video is not as rich as other entries in the Leap Frog series.

2.  The video teaches the number zero, which is a nice touch.  But in the same song that 0 is presented, the number 10 is not.  I think people are more likely to count from 1 to 10 instead of from 0 to 9.  I with the number 10 was emphasized a bit more.

3.  There are a few other times where the gang counts to 4, 5 and 6, but the counting is presented more as part of the dialogue, rather than an actual lesson.  So some kids might miss this.

4.  There is a song where Tad and Lilly are putting teeth into sharks' mouths.  During this song, they count to 10, but do it very quickly.  I think they count a little too fast in this song for it to be useful for new counters.

5  There is an instance where the gang counts to 20, which is nice, especially because they do it slowly.

This is not the strongest video from Leap Frog, but my son loves it and enthusiastically counts along when the ""fishies"" song is being played.  So I rate the video highly because my son is indeed learning something from it and is interested in it.  But I must ding it one star for its overemphasis on plot rather than actual counting.",1329955200,,1564,4.1638795986622075
4306979,1,B004AC6PN0,"Shame on you LeapFrog, this Numbers Ahoy needs to go ""down under the sea"", you need to do a much better job than this! This video is not bad if you want your child to watch something trivial that has a smidgen of learning, but honestly, there is very little educational content in this and ALL of the Leapfrog videos I have watched, so LeapFrog should not market them as such!

I am talking from experience, as a former elementary school teacher and learning specialist, as well as trained animator (MFA) and parent of a toddler. I am utterly appalled at the amount of actual learning in all of the Leapfrog videos I have watched. Gosh, I timed the actual amount of learning time in these videos and let me tell you, for the entire 39 minutes of each of your ""educational videos"" there is actually an average of less than 8 minutes of actual learning time going on! Something is considerably WRONG with that ratio.

I don't know what is going down in Emeryville, CA, but something needs to change! To me this is a case the Emperor's New Clothes. A suggestion to you would be to go to your backyard UC Berkeley campus and get a bunch of graduate teachers to review this for free.

I have a 3.5 & a 2 year old and they love this video. The video teaches counting from 0 to 20, division (sharing), and helps the children relate the written number with the amount.

At first viewing, my youngest quickly became frustrated because there was not enough time for him to count each animal.  This was easily corrected by hitting the pause button; afterwards, he enjoyed it and both children sing the songs even when not watching the video.",1322611200,,599,4.518518518518518

We decided to try Numbers Ahoy, expecting to find the same level of repetition in learning number sense.  However, we were sadly disappointed.  They do name each number, however they do not count up to each number (for 5, they say one more than before).  This was more of a short movie, than a learning DVD.  I was expecting a song about counting and naming numbers.  Hopefully LeapFrog will create something to help reinforce learning numbers as a supplement to what the children are learning at home.",1322438400,,663,4.814159292035399

My three children ages 1, 3, and 5 all find this DVD very entertaining and beg to watch it, even over other TV shows and movies. (Read Bolt, Tangled, Mulan, Clifford etc.)  We own all the leapfrog DVDs, but this one is most appropriate for children who do not know their numbers yet. If they can already count, then you are wasting your money on this one. The DVD follows the adventures of Tad and Lily as they play a game called ""Numbers Ahoy"", all the while learning how to count and recognize numbers 1-20 as well as develop beginning estimation skills.",1322179200,,623,4.417391304347826

No improvement over his counting before we bought the video.  The story is ""fun"" for kids, but there is no repetition of the basics, so that children will actually learn anything.

She seemed more in tune with the counting in the books that we daily read together after watching the DVD. I may have become more counting-oriented due to this purchase, so there is more to it than merely setting your child down in front of the tube.

The special features have the music portions listed, in case you merely want to visit the counting portions of the 30 minute show. We limit TV watching to DVDs and it is nice to simply allow for a few minutes as a treat as opposed to the entire show every now and then. The counting is then reiterated, which is a valuable tool for any small child on the learning path.

We have a few Leap Frog products (Violet and their reading pads) and have been very satisfied with them all. The characters and format that this brand has created has been all very likable and approachable to our daughter.",1320451200,,946,4.338983050847458

4306993,1,B004AC6PN0,"This Leap Frog production attempts to do three things: 1) overview how to count to 20; 2) touch on the concept of ""more"" and ""less"" and; 3) spend a lot of time on a meandering, silly plot.

1) Within the course of this 30min -ish video, Tad and Lilly (the main characters) count to 10 six times (at least in a remotely memorable way) and count to 20 once. In the course of this there is a song, quite cute, counting fish, which I think would be useful for toddlers to develop counting skills. This song comprises one of the times they count.  The other 5 are merely counting and, while obviously intended to be a helpful part of the video, they do not strike me as being something a small child might ""latch on to"" since they are merely spoken plainly. They count to 20 in the same manner. This is disappointing for me since in the Letter and Word Factory Videos (Highly Recommend!) the respective skills are emphasized with song, something universally acknowledged as helpful to early education.

2) I was surprised that the concept of ""more and less"" was bothered with. It was a pleasant surprise, yet it is briefly done and without much emphasis.  The way this is introduced, as far as I can foresee, is neither very helpful nor at all bad...just there.

3) On this third point, Leap Frog was successful. Tad and Lilly magically go to the bottom of the sea with a fly, ""Einstein"" and their puppy, ""Scout"" to learn to count. There they meet some sharks and pursue a pirate ""Pirate Pythagoras"" whose ship floats beneath the water.  Much time is wasted, in my opinion, in trying to make this seem logical.  I'm not necessarily of the opinion that children's videos must be strictly realistic.  It is good to foster imagination. Yet, since Leap Frog chose such a disjointed plot, they spend quite some time trying to make it make sense.  Time that could be better spent... counting.

In the end, I would say this video is not a serious educational media.",1313971200,18,1953,4.538461538461538

First, this is no Letter Factory - that video is amazing and deserves an Oscar.

That said, while it's a bit showy/commercial and chintzy, it grows on you over time.  The songs are addictive and yes, my daughter learned to count, and somewhat learned to recognized numbers by sight with some help from this video.

4307004,5,B004AC6PN0,I bought this for my 22 month old. He sings the number song from dvd alot. now at 23 months he knows how to count to 20 and can identify most of the numbers from 0 to 20. I'm going to buy all the new leap frog dvds.,1301529600,,215,3.5
4307005,5,B004AC6PN0,"I bought all the Leap Frog videos for my daughers (2 & 3) and they absolutly love them! My two year old knows all the letters by sight and the sounds. My three year old is beginning to spell, write, and read simple words!  Plus they are both recognizing numbers, understanding how to sort, they can identify patterns and shapes, plus learning how to add & subtract with 1's and 2's.  We've had this maybe 1 month. These are their favorite shows and watch them all the time. They hradly want to watch anything else. We bought another program (your baby can read) but both girls lost interest very quickly. These videos keep their full attention and they are honestly learning in the process. I would highly highly recommend these videos! Amazon was also the cheapest price I found.",1301270400,,780,4.60431654676259

4307010,3,B004AC6PN0,"We have all of the LeapFrog learning dvds. My 4 and 2 y/o kids love them and learn a lot from them. Unfortunately, Numbers Ahoy isn't quite as educational compared to the others - to my disappointment. It is basically a cute little story with a minimal amount of counting added in. It had the potential to be really great, but they did only an average job in making it educational. To its credit, it has a few catchy learning songs and my kids do enjoy it. I definitely would recommend the 'Math Circus' over this one.",1298851200,2,518,4.350515463917525

8419932,5,B004AC6PN0,"My kids love this video. I'm pretty sure it's why I haven't had to teach any of them to count. There is an annoying catchy song that might get stuck in your head, but at least it's educational. :-)
