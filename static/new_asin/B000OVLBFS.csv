2799903,5,B000OVLBFS,"Tom Selleck portrays Jesse Stone, so well, that you feel you could call on him for any problem you might have, yet you can really feel his pain. Tom is terrific in this role, and has been a great actor in many television shows, and has done many excellent westerns. I hope he does many more Jesse Stone DVDs.",1184716800,,308,4.237288135593221
2799904,4,B000OVLBFS,"I had previously rented from the video store the movie Stone Cold, with Tom Selleck.  I really enjoyed the movie. The characters, plot and the complexity between each person. I then saw ""Night Passage,"" which appears to be the first in the ""Jessie Stone Series.""  The movie was a great hit in my household, and we now own all three movies.  Night Passage introduces you to the main character, Jessie Stone, and also the other returning characters. Who, where, when, etc., without deterring away from a great story/plot. I highly recommend this movie, especially if you have seen Stone Cold or Death in Paradise. This is great to watch over and over at any time.",1184371200,3,661,4.730434782608696
2799905,5,B000OVLBFS,"Excellent lead in to ""Stone Cold"". Tom Selleck does a great job as Stone in this prequel to the first movie. The back story of him being fired because he drank on the job shows he has a murky past. Him driving to Paradise, and us getting a chance to see character development, is good. He finds some suspicious events tied to the previous sheriff of Paradise, and a good lead as to why the sheriff is retiring early. When he handles a case of a battered wife, he finds the husband is hiding something. If that isn't enough, Jesse's dog Boomer has failing health. It is handled with a sensitive touch. Especially if you have been through it. If you enjoy this be sure to catch the other two movies ""Stone Cold"" and ""Death in Paradise"" based on Robert Parker books. You may like ""An Innocent Man"" as well. It is a drama with Selleck being falsely accused of a crime and then being sent to prison. Tom Selleck is a great actor. Often underappreciated as far as I'm concerned. I have enjoyed ninety percent of all his TV shows and movies. So if you like Selleck or good dramas, be sure to catch this one.",1183939200,32,1100,4.318840579710145
2799906,4,B000OVLBFS,Greatly enjoyed seeing Selleck in this role.  I'm glad he has done a whole series of these movies.  I have all three that he has done so far.  Hope there are more in the works.,1183939200,2,176,3.9714285714285715
2799907,5,B000OVLBFS,"Each of the Jesse Stone films, like the novels by Robert B. Parker, offer a chance to watch an intelligent movie. Tom Selleck is great as the lead actor---a complicated figure who has a set of core values that are constantly tested by his own set of personal problems. Rather than sensationalism, special effects, or mindless humor, the Jesse Stone films actually rely upon character development and an interesting plot.",1183680000,2,420,5.014285714285714
2799908,5,B000OVLBFS,"This, the second in the Jesse Stone series of TV movies, was actually the beginning of his adventures in Paradise.  It holds its place in the now four adaptations of the Parker novels, with a fifth in the works, and simultaneously begins and continues the development of the lead and supporting characters.  So long as the novels are adapted for TV, I'll watch, and so long as they're released on DVD, I'll buy.  All who read this, do yourselves a favor, and check them out.",1183680000,,474,4.552941176470588
2799909,5,B000OVLBFS,"I recently got to watch Night Passage on TV and truly enjoyed it. It has a simple yet interesting detective storyline and nice strong characters (Selleck is perfect in the Stone's role, believably flawed as a womanizing drunk), and an allover simple ""classic"" timeless feel to it in the style of many British TV miniseries or films  - and that's a real compliment! (since I believe the British are the best at producing quality work for television.)
Well done!",1183334400,,460,4.822784810126582
2799910,5,B000OVLBFS,"Tom does a great job on all for stories. The scenes are pleasant and calm. The crime is cold and solvable. When the legal paperwork won't solve a domestic problem, Chief Stone adds his 'extra' means of enforcement. We need more police chiefs (and patrolmen) willing take the extra means necessary to control the 'bad' element out there. If they had done so when the bad seeds were younger, perhaps they would have chosen a better path. Good writing and directing. Great story. Need more of this caliber on TV and DVD.",1183334400,,517,4.630434782608695
2799911,5,B000OVLBFS,"The entire series of  Jesse Stone is absolutely fantastic.  It keeps you at the end of your seat.  Bravo to Tom Selleck!!!!!!  Looking forward to ""Sea Change"", the fourth in the series.",1182729600,4,185,4.6875
2799912,5,B000OVLBFS,"Tom Selleck is absolutely perfect as Jesse Stone, a character created by the great crime author Robert Parker. Selleck plays a burned out, alcoholic cop who takes a job in the small town of Paradise, Massachusetts as sheriff. ""Night Passage"" is the tale of the quest by the emotionally damaged Stone for the killer of a young girl. William Devane costars as Jesse's shrink and he is excellent. Terrific secondary characters. In my opinion, Parker's Jesse Stone series of novels eclipses his famous Spenser books. This story line is the prequal to CBS's fabulously successful ""Stone Cold"", Selleck's first outing as Jesse Stone. Grab ""Night Passage"" . . . the Jesse Stone made-for-TV movies are quality productions with superb acting and beautiful cinematography. Stunning music. Exceptional TV. Highly, highly recommended.

""Cop-ly intuition."" - Jesse Stone's sixth sense.

Four and a half APPEALING Stars. ""Jesse Stone: Night Passage"" is one of the excellent episodes in the series of TV movies based on the novels by Robert B. Parker about the star-crossed fictional sheriff, Jesse Stone, of the seaside town of Paradise, Massachusetts. This is based on the very first Parker book on Stone and picks up where Stone has been let go by the LAPD, mainly for a persistent problem.

In a job search, Paradise's mogul purposefully selects him as the new sheriff, along with his baggage, talents, and dog. Stone needs the change of scenery in this very deliberately-paced drama about fitting into his new environment, but much is going on behind the scenes and some things are deadly when an unexpected mystery appears as Jesse's first case as sheriff. Luther 'Suitcase' Simpson, Molly, and Anthony are regulars in the sheriff's office, in what became a popular series of stand-alone movies with evolving characters. Starring Selleck, Viola Davis, Mike Turner, Saul Rubinek, Kohl Sudduth, Polly Shannon, Stephanie March, Mike Starr, Brittany (Britt) Robertson, John Beale, and Stephen Baldwin, with Stephen McHattie. Music by Jeff Beal. Produced by Steven Brandman.  Directed by Robert Harmon. Highly Recommended. Four and a half FERVENT Stars. Rated PG-13. Color. HD. CC. X-Ray.

2800122,4,B000OVLBFS,"We had just seen Jesse Stone: Lost in Paradise, the last film in the Jesse Stone series and we liked it well enough to go back to the beginning and see the first film in this ten film series, Night Passage.

Night Passage opens with our hero, Jesse Stone, Tom Selleck, standing by the ocean in Santa Monica looking out to sea.  He has been drinking heavily and is in the process of sobering up when he is confronted by a police officer.  Stone tells the officer that he is a former LAPD policeman himself and will be all right.  The officer goes away and next we see Jesse in his car driving slowly to a new job as chief of police in Paradise Massachusetts.

There is trouble in Paradise.  The old police chief has been given a fifty thousand dollar pay off by the head selectman of the small town.  We don't know why, but soon after the old chief is murdered in what looks like an accident.  Our new chief Jesse Stone suspects foul play and this mystery sits at the heart of this opening episode of the series.

Tom Selleck is a fine actor and is well cast as the laid back chief of Paradise, who wants to live and let live as he confronts his demons, alcohol being one of them and a recent divorce of a wife he cant forget being the other.  The story moves forward slowly as Jesse gets to know the various townspeople and members of his small police force.  When we finally come to the final resolution of the murder mystery, I must say that I was disappointed.  It did not ring true to me.

That said, I am willing to try the next film in the series, Trouble in Paradise, and will report back to my readers my take on the development of this series.

As many of my readers know, Robert Parker is the author of the Jesse Stone series of mysteries which are available for a little as a penny on Amazon.  If readers of this review have a recommendation about which of these books to read first, please leave me a comment.  Thanks.",1457222400,,1930,4.23224043715847

2800145,5,B000OVLBFS,"All of the Jesse Stone films are excellent. I have read the original Robert B. Parker novels, and these films portray the characters very accurately, if you ignore the differences in plot points and story lines. As in most movies made from novels, there are some scenes and characters which are not included, or whose appearance in the story has been increased or decreased in importance. One thing in particular that I want to note is that you should keep in mind that in the beginning of the series (Night Passage), Jesse Stone is only 35 years old, and this is explicity stated in the novel. Tom Selleck is of course much older than that, and no amount of makeup can conceal that fact. This is important in that the ""romantic"" scenes in these films often seem unrealistic due to Mr. Selleck's apparent age. If you can keep a mental image of him as he looked in ""Magnum, PI"", and pretend that it's his younger self portraying Jesse Stone, the romance scenes in these films don't seem nearly as strange as they do. Other than age, Tom Selleck is absolutely perfect as Chief Stone, and all the other cast members are perfect in their roles, too. For a ""made for TV"" series, these films are extraordinarily good, and if you haven't already taped them, I highly recommend buying the whole series of DVD's. You will likely watch them many times over the years.",1454198400,8,1357,4.588477366255144

2800158,5,B000OVLBFS,"If you love the Jesse Stone movies you'll know what I'm talking about. It's the ""feel"" of these movies that sets them apart. From the very relaxing yet still dramatic theme music to Selleck himself as a laid back and calm man with inner demons who occasionally resorts to unexpected violence, these movies have an atmosphere of calm and beauty yet still dangerous under the surface. Selleck's laconic voice lulls you in and the scenery of ""Paradise"" takes you on that New England getaway you have always wanted to take, minus the incidental murder taking place in the background. Anyways, as you can tell I'm a fan. Take a trip to Paradise, you won't be sorry.",1453593600,6,660,4.698275862068965

2800201,5,B000OVLBFS,"Tom does a great job on all the stories. Night Passage may be viewed first in the series if one wants a chronological look at Jesse Stone that starts with his leaving LA and shows his settling in in the town of Paradise, Massachusetts. This is supposedly loosely based on Swampscott, which is about 15-20 miles from Boston. Swampscott has a Paradise Road that seems to have motivated the town's name.

The scenes are pleasant and calm. The crime is cold and solvable It has a simple yet interesting detective storyline and nice strong characters Selleck is perfect in the Stone's role, believably flawed as a womanizing drunk, and an allover simple ""classic"" timeless feel to it.  Anyone looking for Magnum P.I. in the Jesse Stone character should look elsewhere. Tom Selleck does a magnificent job in his portrayal of a rough, very flawed, but brilliant sheriff as he cracks the case, but interacts genuinely with his fellow officers and the people he serves.

Are there cops like Jesse Stone Very doubtful, or very doubtful there are many. There are too many horror stories of police brutality these days. But we do need examples of heroes, and Jesse Stone is one. He knows what to say and not say to win over a girl from a troubled marriage who could easily go wrong. He knows how to gain the respect of his department members. But clearly he did not know how to handle his affairs in LA, before he journeyed to a small Massachusetts town to become a police chief, for he arrives in quite an alcoholic condition. So, Jesse Stone is a kind of throwback to a long series of movieland good cops and good private detectives, incorruptible, alert, smart and stalwart who plow on despite their personal problems.

It's not too far-fetched that the mob, known to inhabit various locales in and around Boston, might launder money in a nearby town. Well, at any rate, there have to be bad guys to challenge Jesse, who insists on being called Jesse.  The movie seamlessly interweaves characterizations of local people and of Jesse himself and his dog Boomer with the central crime story, the resolution of which leaves something to be desired, since it exposes Jesse to a risk that hardly seems plausible. But then this entry in the series focuses far more on character than on the crime story.  The movie reminds me being in a small bar with a pianist playing a light piano with the lights down dim. There is some talking but it is soft.  I just loved the flow of the movie, the perfection of Selleck for the main character,  does not say very much, his face is full of expression. What he does say is meaningful. It is surprising that Jesse Stone, a man with a lot of painful baggage, can be so understanding around everyone he meets. Everything about the character is direct.

It's a pleasure to have a hero who understands people and thinks for himself.  Terrific series! Intense, dramatic, wonderful sound track and scenery...you really care about these people.  I really enjoyed this series and have watched all the DVDs from the library.

SPOILER ALERT
Jesse Stone is a former LA policeman, who relocates to Paradise, Massachusetts after leaving the force due to a drinking problem. Stone is invited by Paradise's powerful counselor, Hastings Hathaway. Stone replaces former Chief Lou Carson, who is forced into early retirement.  He becomes Chief in the small coastal town and buys a secluded house where he lives with his senior hound dog.  In Stone's first assignment, he hits an abusive husband named Joe Genest. Genest disregarded a restraining order. Local attorney Abby Taylor visits Stone after the incident and an affair begins. When Lou is killed, Chief Jesse Stone suspects of the mobster Joe and Hastings, and plots a situation trying to disclose the truth.",1443312000,,3769,4.7784615384615385

2800392,5,B000OVLBFS,This is movie 2 in the series.  I love Jessie Stone played by Tom Selleck. He played a realistic role of a troubled alcoholic trying to keep his job a float while dealing with abandonment issues.  Even small towns have cover ups and Jessie is hot on the trail of uncovering the towns dirty secrets.  I guess he isn't as washed up as they thought he was..look out guys he is still a great homicide detective and will uncover your unmentionables.,1413244800,,444,4.45679012345679
2800393,5,B000OVLBFS,"The Jesse Stone novels by Robert B. Parker make up the few fiction books I have read.
I like them because they are written in a simple clear style presenting the realistic problems of a policeman.

There is a unique ""thing"" about a ""good"" novel in my opinion.
It's one of not conflicting with known technical true information.

Stone looks at the facts, seeks ways to get more facts, and progresses in a logical way to solve the case.",1412553600,,434,4.481012658227848

2800419,4,B000OVLBFS,"For those unfamiliar, Jesse Stone is the legendary, fictional, Police Chief in the small town of Paradise, Massachusetts, created by Robert B. Parker. The Jesse Stone franchise has spawned over a dozen novels and eight feature films. While being the first book in the series, strangely enough, Night Passage was the second movie shot, and the third one released. It seems odd, but Night Passage is more of an introduction to the character and the town. If this were a TV series, it would have been the pilot, but when you're trying to start a film franchise, you want to start it off with a film that hits harder and is more memorable, the way Stone Cold was. As for Night Passage, it introduces audiences to Jesse Stone, as he leaves L.A. a disgraced homicide detective, with an alcohol problem, coming on the heals of a divorce. Stone drives across the country in hopes of taking over the seemingly easy job of being a Chief in a small town, but he quickly learns that Paradise is not your ordinary small town. Tom Selleck stars and was the obvious choice to play Stone, because the man has been playing a cop for almost forty years! Unlike many of those other Policemen, Stone is more withdrawn and uses his experience to take care of business, so he can go home to his dog and his alcohol. Each story centers around a crime, but also has a secondary story, Night Passage is no different as Stone must deal with a homicide, and a domestic situation that has torn a family apart. Similar to the other films, they get big names to co-star and in Night Passage we get Academy Award Winner, Viola Davis, and Stephen Baldwin. These guess stars, along with deep characters, and complex stories are the difference between the Stone films and a TV series. While Jesse Stone would transfer into a tremendous TV series, you wouldn't get the same feel that you do from the films. The world of Jesse Stone is a cold, dark one. He must do his job while battle his own demons at the same time. With a perfect leading man, coming from some very well written novels, the Jesse Stone films have been a treat, and Night Passage is where it all started. I'd highly recommend getting into the series, but watch the films in order of the novels, not in the order the films were released.",1407628800,,2269,4.509708737864078

2800462,4,B000OVLBFS,"These Jesse Stone films are all very good, equal at least to most theatrical releases. The only complaint I would have is that they have received such limited distribution as Sunday night TV movies. I wish they would get more re-runs. The writing, acting, direction, production, etc. are all superb. Although Chief Stone's character is consistent throughout the series, his and the other characters' life experiences and sometimes just personal ruminations through time that we see in the stories cause these characters to mold and change consistent with their basic personalities. Even a character such as Hasty shows growth as a result of his experiences as a criminal, and one see's that his appreciation of Stone's character reflected off his own experience has changed from a simplistic burnt out drunken big city cop to a genuine appreciation of Stones fundamental morality and strength of character that keeps him going regardless of the disasters in his life and his personal weakness for Scotch whiskey. And, since all the characters in the series still have a distance to go to reach their final state of maturity and moral consciousness, I would like to see the series continue when Tom Selleck can take a break from his television series commitment.",1403568000,,1261,5.096618357487923

I was hooked and hope that they continue to make more movies in this series. Not surprisingly, Mr. Selleck plays a detective, a bit beleaguered and broken, but thoroughly good and sharply insightful.

The story carries you into the intrigue of Police Chief Jesse Stone pursuit of solving the crime.  The series is very well done and the actors do a great job in capturing your interest in the roles they play.

you see on TCM who don't have those three in a movie today.  We watched this series entranced by the great acting and
content.
Whenever we see a really good movie and it has bad language I end up saying to my husband--""That could have been PG
if they had left out the language.""
Tom isn't the only actor that made this series good.  Whoever chose the actors for each part knew what they were doing
and they have a great sense of who is best for each part.  I liked the guy who was called Suitcase and Kathy Baker-really good.
Get this Jesse Stone series for your library--you won't regret it.  But put the little ones to bed first.  It's a adult series.",1400025600,5,779,4.194630872483222

2800586,5,B000OVLBFS,"Murder mystery (& other drama) in a small town. Where did I see that before? I've actually watched the first three of the Jesse Stone made for TV movies. I like Tom Selleck and the movies are entertaining. Not too predictable except his disastrous love life, but that's part of the story line so far. Selleck isn't quite playing the Magnum or Quigly or Commissioner Reagan character in these. Actually there's a little of all of them in this character. I'm recuperating from surgery, so I'm watching Amazon Prime movies & some old TV series I missed to be entertained without losing brain cells to daytime TV. If you do watch these, go to IMDB for the release dates and start at the beginning.  Or maybe watch #2 first since it is a prequel.  If you don't do that, all three so far would be entertaining as disconnected stories. There is a background storyline running through these, though, so some of the details will make more sense watched in sequence.  Not sure why Amazon doesn't list them as a series to make things easier.",1399939200,,1030,4.586956521739131

2800698,5,B000OVLBFS,"Having watched Magnum PI for so m,any years, getting used to his wink and smile, a somber, more /older Selleck took some getting used to, however, as Jessie Stone, Selleck demonstrates that he is a very competent actor, portraying a Police officer  who has fallen from grace and is seeking/achieving redemption in a small New England community.
The scripts are well written and well presented to the viewer as Jessie rebuilds himself as a very interesting character. Some violence, but only as a a an illustration of man kinds flawed nature. Very enjoyable viewing overall.",1395360000,,573,5.031578947368421

2800700,5,B000OVLBFS,"there was Jesse Stone. Tom Selleck is great in this series. Night Passage is actually the first book in this Robert Parker series but apparantly was the second movie made, after Stone Cold.

The action takes place in what is supposedly coastal Massachusetts but was filmed in Halifax, Nova Scotia, so, no, MA does not look like this at all. But, that is a quibble. The story is very good.",1395273600,,388,4.542857142857143
2800701,4,B000OVLBFS,Love anything Tom Sellick is in. He has always picked good movies to act in. Unlike so many stars that you never know if you will like it or not. Tom is so believable as Jesse Stone. The movie has a very good plot that keeps you guessing.,1395273600,,238,3.9791666666666665
2800702,5,B000OVLBFS,"Really enjoying this series. Hope Amazon makes the full series available on Amazon Prime.

2800710,4,B000OVLBFS,For over twenty years Robert B. Parker has been my favorite beach read.  Predictable cops and robbers plots with sweet touches of humanity.  Tom Selleck was perfect for this role; he plays the dissolute but honest alcoholic cop with alacrity.  He adds a dimension or two to the predictable.,1394323200,,290,4.877551020408164

2800757,5,B000OVLBFS,I have always enjoyed Tom Selleck movies and series after his series in Hawaii. The Jesse Stone series shows him playing a person with a tough past in L.A. and having a hard time forgetting a ex-wife and adjusting to a slower paced life in a smaller town. He brings his background from the larger city to a town not to open his hand as he investigates cases and at the same time teach his staff skills to become better at their jobs.,1392768000,,433,4.228915662650603

He has an alcohol problem and an ex wife for whom he still has feelings and is seeking help on both accounts. He does his job which he knows very well and is not too concerned about the politics of his bosses at the City Council.

Tom Selleck and company have produced an astounding series of movies that will keep you interested from end to end.  They are one of a very short list of movies that I and my wife can sit and watch over and over again, seeing new elements and nuances with each viewing.  We have two diverse tastes in movies, but agree that this is one of the very best we've seen in many years!

In line with Foyle's War and Inspector Levis, this cop has what it takes to solve crime.  He is persistent and insightful when it comes to solving crime.  Jessie has a unique way of establishing friendships, always cautious but careful to respect others unless they are criminal.

2800881,5,B000OVLBFS,"After watching all 8 Jesse Stone movies, I realized I was already a fan of the writer Robert B Parker.  He also wrote Spenser for Hire and the Sonny Randall series.  Also the theme song and musical score were written by Jeff Beal who is an amazing composer...listen to the Jesse Stone theme song long enough and you will get the haunting melody caught in your head.  I know you will love this movie.  There are 6 more written by Parker and ""Thin Ice"" written by Tom Selleck.  Bucket list is to own and read all Parker books.  I recently bought the t.v. complete series of Spencer for Hire.  I own all but 4 books.  You will love it.",1379462400,,632,4.2521008403361344
2800882,4,B000OVLBFS,"These Selleck-produced and acted movies are not comparable to first-rate, high budget movies, but they use beautiful New England settings, nice looking actors who do a credible job. The script follows the writer Robert Parker's dialog and style closely, although I am sorry it is sparse on the humor that Parker often used. I don't think the novels were quite as dark and brooding.

Jesse Stone has problems but in the novels, he's not quite so sad and flawed.

Like most Selleck-influenced work, these movies are moral tales: portrayals of people being good, with traditional values, being kind, honest and doing the right thing.",1378771200,,630,5.048076923076923

Tom Selleck is perfectly cast as small town police chief Jesse Stone. Imperfect, divorced, alcoholic fired ex-cop Jesse Stone finds new life in Paradise, Mass., and you won't want to miss one minute of it.
In this first installment of the Jesse Stone series (actually the second, but see this one first), Jesse finds himself being harassed by the mob. Stephen Baldwin is absolutely perfect as the bad guy in this movie. Do yourself a favor and just watch Night Passage first, and you will be hooked. The next seven in the series are just as well made/superbly directed as this one. After you watch this series once, you'll want to watch again - and again. The over 40 crowd will probably more appreciate the ""atmosphere over action"" style of this series. Enjoy!",1375920000,,973,4.867469879518072

2800924,5,B000OVLBFS,"This prequel to the long running series based on the late Robert Parker's creation was both well written and acted. Not to belabor what others have noted,  Ms. Viola Davis' work in the earlier stories is truly missed.  Mr. Selleck's performance is credible, and true to the original character personality as expounded in print.

2800941,5,B000OVLBFS,I have enjoyed watching Tom Selleck playing different roles. The series of Jesse Stone has become one of my favorites to watch. The writing and directing of this series is one of the best I have seen in a long time. Tom's performance is outstanding! His character is a no nonsense kind of a guy and I find that very refreshing. I like people who stand for what they know to be true and right and they don't let anyone turn them from that no matter if it is fortune or fame.,1373846400,,473,4.1521739130434785

2800945,5,B000OVLBFS,"This step back movie production is a great way to get acclimated to the Jesse Stone we have seen in the 1st movie, which actually is 2nd in the timeline of the character.  Tom Selleck plays the part of Jesse Stone, damaged ex-LAPD homicide detective as if he, or Jesse were made for each other. The story line creates the weaknesses and the strengths of the characters, and the great plots which Robert B. Parker is the best at bringing to life. If you haven't read any of the Parker books, do yourself a favor and check them out, I am sure Amazon has them, although I have not checked. I didn't check as I have read everything Parker has written for the last 20 years or so. Then do yourself a really GREAT favor and buy some more of the movies, for they are sure to please.

2800977,4,B000OVLBFS,"I like Tom Selleck in general so I liked this series also. The first in this series was Night Passages and it is little depressing at times because of his personal struggles (the character is an alcoholic and the loss of ""Boomer"" (his dog) .But Selleck's characters are usually down to earth, honest and with a dry sense of humor....and manly....!!!",1372896000,2,349,4.737704918032787

I personally like that the movie wraps everything up tight at the end, as I think getting to know Jesse Stone is the point of the whole movie anyway.

I look forward to watching the rest of the Jesse Stone movies.  So far, I find these to be hidden, understated movie gems!",1372118400,,531,4.166666666666667

2801007,5,B000OVLBFS,"Who could dislike Tom Selleck, right? He's the nice and amiable type...but I had also never thought of him as a top-tier actor. This role fits him like a snug pair of jeans, though. His acting is very natural in it, and has a lot of manly weight to it. It's a darker, cop/detective role he's portraying. It allows him to offer a relaxed and believable performance as a jaded, functional alcoholic still in love with his ex-wife, but not pining so significantly that he would shun the affections, nay advances, of the charming ladies that throw themselves at him. The character's  unavailability don't seem to deter women from appreciating his manliness and nothing-to-lose disposition. This is the first story in the series and I'm sorry I didn't watch this one first. The one called Stone Cold was made ahead of it.

2801072,5,B000OVLBFS,"Someone recommended Tom Selleck as ""Ike"" and while looking on IMDB for movies with Selleck I came across all these Jesse Stone films.  I'd not read the mysteries on which they are based, and I'd never even heard of the books or the films.  I first watched ""Jesse Stone - Stone Cold"", which while it is the first one made, it is actually preceded by this prequel.  I was captivated from the start.  Complex characters, interesting and unusual dialog, haunting musical score that is so evocative and appropriate and the mysteries are excellent.  WOW! The best result of not having seen any of them before is that I've been able to watch one right after the other.  I've been immersed in the character of Jesse Stone, the small town of Paradise, MA, the quirky other regular characters played with equal ability (to Selleck's) by Viola Davis, Kohl Sudduth, Kathy Baker, William Devane, Stephen McHattie and more.  You've seen these actors in other films and TV shows, but they are better than ever here as an ensemble.

The sad thing is that I'm concerned with Selleck in the TV series Blue Blood (which I also like), that there may be no more Jesse Stone movies.  There is one more for me to watch.  Lucky me.

Stone is such an unusual, complex and complicated character.  I am captivated! And besides that, he has a wonderful golden retriever through most of the series.

Why it is so hard to ascertain what the order of the series is?  It took me a bit of work, but here it is for you.  Some are available here on Amazon Instant Video (and on Netflix-streaming and DVD).  Do not miss this series, and do watch them in order.  There are back stories that you want to follow along as well.

Movie writers typically change the story line, you know the drill. The story has been changed. It's shortened. The ending is different. Molly is black instead of Irish Catholic.

Surprisingly it does work. Selleck may be too old but he manages to pull it off quite well. While the plot has been changed, enough of it is loyal the the intent of the story that it hangs together.

Having read the books and seen most of the movies, I can understand the choice of Tom Selleck to play Jesse Stone. When I read one of the books now, I can hear Selleck in my mind saying the words. Although the movies do not completely follow the book, mainly due to time constraints, they are true to the character created by Robert Parker.",1367107200,,576,4.342592592592593

2801116,5,B000OVLBFS,"In almost every instance where I have read a book and then seen the movie I have ALWAYS found things that I hate in the movie because they omitted something vital or completely changed things around but Jesse Stone movies are the exception. Tom Selleck is stellar and he does a magnificent job of mixing Jesse's venerability and tough and gruff attitude into his amazing performance. This movie is definitely a must see. I would recommend that this particular movie, Night Passage be watched before any of the others within the series because shows how and why Jesse came to Paradise.",1365984000,,584,4.792079207920792
2801137,4,B000OVLBFS,"A good movie...but the part with alot women throwing themselves at him is a bit of a stretch. I mean the plot and Selleck and the crime part of it are good.  But every single woman he comes across aggressively throws herself at him.  I mean a hot 19 year  old college chick in a bar making sexual advances on a 50 something or late 40s something year old guy????  No..... college chicks are interested in college boys and would be super intimidated by a  guy that much older.
  Then...the girl he dates brings up sex on the first date...sex with him. Then, at a dinner party...some other guys wife pulls him on the dance floor and propositions sex with him.  All he has to do is be there.  This is so unrealistic.  Not human nature at all.....men are always the aggressors and women are more demure needing to be seduced. At least the female vet didn't try to throw him on the examining table and rip his clothes off.
  Other than this beef....it is good writing with good actors.  I will watch more Jesse Stone films.",1365984000,,1018,4.379679144385027

I can watch this show and the next one over and over again. I was on the road and needed a break so I just dialed in my Amazon Prime and pulled up the movie. What would it be like if you could take a break from your life for just an hour? This is the place I go for that.,1365897600,,403,3.6436781609195403
2801139,5,B000OVLBFS,"I have enjoyed every installment of this series. The plots are interesting and suspenseful, yes, but the real star is the atmosphere. Selleck's character is noble and intelligent but also damaged, sad and lost. He lives in a distant cabin, far from other human beings; the musical score is melancholy, fitting the mood nicely.
 We get to watch Jesse struggle toward redemption and self-forgiveness as the series continues, which is the best reason to watch it in order.
The stories are well developed and the supporting actors are perfectly cast.",1365897600,,546,5.066666666666666

He finds a money laundering and murder that leads him to some of the town's leading citizens as suspects for these crimes. His quiet but effect techniques do not make him the most popular chief of police with the town council as he continues to drink and spiral downward into depression. The film has an element of suspense that keeps the audience guessing as he puts the pieces of his puzzle together in solving this crime. Our family loved this film as they have the rest of the series.  We look forward to more Jesse Stone stories in the future, as Tom Selleck looks great in this role of the rough and ready police chief and plays the character to perfection.",1364083200,3,840,4.593333333333334

My only complaint is that there is little action and a lot of whispy music between little dialogue. In great measure, that is intentional because that enhances the same feeling about the Jesse Stone character.

I recommend the whole series and can't wait for more. But, don't expect new releases to come along quickly, Selleck has other irons in the fire, and these are low-budget project films.",1355875200,,523,4.943181818181818

Well cheer up cause it's REAL irritating.  I originally ordered 2 Jesse Stone videos with the intention of getting more but now I think I will pass on getting any more and get something a little more entertaining (unless you enjoy the grief tone level).  The melancholy music didn't fit in to what was going on and therefore real irritating.  It had Tom Sellik our hero from the 70s (Magnum PI) which did give a redeeming aspect to it.

There's something as good as SHERLOCK on?  This piqued my interest so as a mystery aficionado streamed this film which is the prequel to the series.

Even though this is the prequel and the second show in the series, I would watch this first as it shows the backstory regarding how Stone ventured from CA to MA to be chief police there.  The major characters are introduced.

Wow!  It totally exceeded expectations.  Stunning scenery (supposed to be norther MA but actually Canada), witty dialog, complex characters, believable acting, intriguing plots, haunting musical theme, pacing which kept you interested....don't know why I'm just hearing about this series.

Haven't read the author Robert Parker's books but now I want to--he had a PhD in English Lit and taught, along with writing 50 novels.

Selleck acts, produces and helps write the teleplays and you sense someone who cares about the production oversees the details.  It emanates quality.  It is better than many movies I have been to.  Like other reviewers, wish they would produce more of these per year whilst retaining the quality.

Love the set design, especially the Chief's office and home with the cracked leather chairs.

If you like a warm, intelligent, imperfect, masculine, astute, humane, non-political chief of police as protagonist, check this series out.",1337990400,,1487,5.1161825726141075

That's how I feel about Jesse Stone, another Californian transplanted to New England. Ted Williams didn't pay much attention to fielding, but what he did pay attention to, he did very well. The ""Jesse Stone"" movies don't do everything well, but when it comes to producing character-driven, moody, exquisitely paced, hard-boiled entertainment, they do very well. One of my favorite aspects of ""Night Passage is how it takes the time to tell the story well. The relationship between Boomer and Jesse is presented to us patiently and effectively. Also, ""Night Passage"" pays attention to detail. One of my favorite moments in the movie is when one of the characters hands a cup of coffee to another character.

this installment shows the viewer how Stone became police chief of Paradise, Massachusetts.  Formerly, he was a homicide detective working for the L.A.P.D. He was kicked off that job due to his alcoholism, drinking on the job.  He is estranged from his wife.

A new chapter in his life opens when he gets a chance to interview for the now open position of police chief in Paradise, Massachusetts, a small fishing village.

To his surprise, he gets the job.  A few days later, he learns that the former police chief has recently died, of an apparent suicide.  The case seems to be ""open and shut"", but Stone has his doubts.",1283817600,,796,4.602836879432624

2801254,4,B000OVLBFS,"THANK YOU for checking out my reviews. I recently have been looking into Tom Selleck's catalog of projects and have been pleased with the results. I am not a reader of the JS book series, so I had no idea what to expect. But after recently watching a Jesse Stone feature on CBC in 2009, I realized this was a series, and decided to go back and explore this product from the beginning. While 'NIGHT PASSAGE' is described as the official 'prequel' to the first JS movie and sets everything up (and is really a LOUSY title, so DON'T be deceived!), it wastes no time in pulling viewers into the characters world. Excellent production values, beautiful photography and exceptional acting compensate for what seem to be standard crime-noir thrillers where only slight surprises occur. The casts and characters in these stories seem to be limited, so by the end, it isn't too hard to figure out where the story is headed. But expect a small surprise or two with each chapter, as well as finely detailed character development and dialogue. Tom Selleck does an excellent SLOW BURN characterization here - unlike anything he's done so far in his varied career. The JESSE STONE series looks to be an exception adult modern-day alternative to the classic detective films of the 1940's and 1950's. They are the perfect compliment to a busy week, and make thoroughly entertaining viewing on a quiet Sunday afternoon or evening. Intelligent, thoughtful, moody and at times dryly funny, TOM SELLECK SCORES with this unique series.

A fan of Tom Selleck since MAGNUM, P.I. days, this is a series that was truly MADE for Selleck.  The brooding Jesse Stone, with all his foibles, is excellently portrayed.  That said, the character and stories of Jesse Stone grab you from the first. . .and don't let you go.  The music too is haunting reverent to the story, adding to the suspense.

2801264,4,B000OVLBFS,"The Jesse Stone ""films"", which are really CBS TV two-hour special recurring dramas, have been a big surprise in many ways. The production quality has been very high, the filming locations, in Nova Scotia, standing in for Maine, very scenic and atmospheric, the way in which the pulp genre characters and B-List former stars and character actors have been used has been keenly attuned to the needs of both Robert Parker's style and Tom Selleck's long established screen persona, the scripts have been lean and well crafted, and Tom Selleck has been wonderful, perfect, perhaps, as Jesse Stone. The first two instalments, with Viola Davis, were especially good. The score is wonderful -- is there any way to get that great music on CD?

However, since the exit of actress Viola Davis as Jesse's fellow cop, police station manager and conscience, and the arrival of the very different Kathy Baker, in a similar role, the series has taken a definite turn into late middle aged ""Murder She Wrote"" torpor. The edginess that made it alluring has waned, the supporting actors have become less notable, and the recurring business about Jesse's drinking, his shrink, his dog, his indifference to being fired from his ""last chance"" job as chief of police, and the calls from his ex-wife have all become a little more rote, and lifeless.

That said, there are some wonderful pulp genre elements here, and I guess I will keep watching. But they need to take stock and amp it back up a bit. It may be aimed at an older demographic, and that may even include me. But it's getting just a little too stolid, even for aging boomers with an affection for gruff but sensible Tom Selleck in a great third act role of a lifetime.",1251936000,3,1707,4.724832214765101

Though ""Jesse Stone: Stone Cold"" was released first on DVD, it's ""Night Passage"" that gives viewers background information on Jesse. Jesse's alcoholism leads to the breakdown of his marriage [though there is a deeper reason for his alcoholism in the first place] and losing his job as an LA homicide detective. So Jesse attempts a new life by moving to a small town called Paradise in MA, accepting the position of police chief.

Jesse soon finds that he's got more to do than just the average small-town shenanigans, and the major theme here is corruption.

The movie reminds me being in a small bar with a pianist playing a light piano with the lights down dim.  There is some talking but it is soft.

I just loved the flow of the movie, the perfection of Selleck for the main character.  Jesse Stone, played by Tom Selleck, a sheriff in a small town, does not say very much, his face is full of expression.  What he does say is meaningful.  It is surprising that Jesse Stone, a man with a lot of painful baggage, can be so understanding around everyone he meets.  Everything about the character is direct.  It is rare for me to find a movie that will entice me to read the book, but this one certainly has done that for me.  It is unfortunate, for me, that the author, Robert Parker, has written a series of book around this character.  I just hate it when I find a book, that I would like, and then discover there is a series of them on one character.  Well there goes again, hours and hours of time committed, locked into the storytelling of some author.

The movie is just wonderful in every way. Robert Harmon, a distinguished made for TV Director has done a spectacular job.  I give this a 8.5 out of 10, or a 4 stars out of 5.",1219795200,,1205,4.1869565217391305

Tom Selleck is perfect as Jesse Stone, a brooding Police Chief of a small New England township.  He's battling alcoholism and a continuing love connection to his ex-wife. This character is pretty much the polar opposite of his Magnum P.I. character but he nails it - just enough brooding with sparks of wry humor.  These series of movies (Stone Cold, Death in Paradise, and Night Passage are three of four, I think) are all beautifully shot and feature a great supporting cast.",1215043200,,710,4.9411764705882355

2801291,5,B000OVLBFS,"I'll skip commentary on the plot or Tom Selleck. Most people have covered these very well. My perspective is production quality. Generally, television movies are merely okay when judged by music and camera work. After all, the little screen is cheaper than the big screen. The stunning production of the Jesse Stone series sets it above anything seen ever.

I would love to know the location setting. I was born and raised in MA and can't imagine a village like Paradise within commuting distance of Boston. The entire North and South Shore above and below Boston are teeming with residents so tightly packed that merely setting off to pick up milk takes resilience and cunning. I'm thinking that it's really Canada or the state of Maine.

It's the harsh and compelling scenery of the shoreline wrapping around the tiny town of Paradise that sets the appropriate mood for the brooding and iconoclastic new police chief, LA fugitive Jesse Stone. Gorgeous, sunny fall days full of spectacular, sharply displayed color recede into damp, rainy, foreboding nights full of those quietly desparate people who rarely dare to leave. The camera work is as stunning as I've ever seen out of Hollywood. One could find entertainment playing this DVD over and over even with the sound turned off.

Crank it up, though. Don't miss the poignant score artfully articulated by Jeff Beal. I hope the soundtrack will be released as well as future movies. I always play the credits that role too briefly at the end. Big screen movie credits go on interminably citing the great contribution of everyone from the executive producers to the gal that keeps the coffee fresh on set. The Jesse Stone series is just a few names at the start and the end. Still, I find it hard to shut the television off until the last note is played.

The cast is a great blend of old pros and new talent. Selleck's trademark laid back style envelopes the storyline like a perfectly broken in leather chair. Kohl Sudduth as Luther ""Suitcase"" Simpson, the eager young officer, moves into a favorite son roll that contrasts very well against the paternal Jesse Stone. The dispatcher is commandingly played by the amazing Viola Davis who takes her character from skeptical resentment to protective admiration swiftly and smoothly.

Saul Rubinek, the crooked but likeable banker squeezes two movies out of what is usually a throwaway roll. Rubinek may be one of those names you can't place because he's pretty much a utility actor rather than a first stringer. But he's never failed in being a notorious scene stealer in the best sense of the term. He has capacity to spare in his acting and prevents any flattening of character. The viewer roots for his comeuppance and then regrets his punishment.

The Tony D'Angelo character simmers in petty irritaion as the oldest cop at the station who's forced to play bridesmaid to every bride when the job of chief is 'stolen' from him by the incoming LA stranger Stone. Vito Rezza's expressive face and talented posturing creates an enduring tribute to the self-obsessed ""little guy"" steeming in his own resentments and obsessed with lame efforts to get back at the new chief.

But the real prize is the main character. There's a great deal of viewer satisfaction in seeing a powerful, confident man who, despite his own personal demons, sees crime and punishment through a complicated but common sense lens. Whether in a big city or a tiny village, he operates on his own keenly tuned intution, dispensing justice with supreme condidence. In this world of man-made conflict it is very rewarding to see a man who can un-make the troublemakers.",1207180800,53,3638,4.877022653721683
2801292,5,B000OVLBFS,"Anyone looking for Magnum P.I. in the Jesse Stone character should look elsewhere.

2801294,4,B000OVLBFS,"Another engaging, introspective TV movie featuring Robert B. Parker's ""Jesse Stone"" police chief character.  Though the second of the Jesse Stone films, ""Jesse Stone: Night Passage"" chronologically takes place before ""Stone Cold"", the first film produced.  That's because this is an ""origin"" story, showing how Chief Stone landed his job in Paradise, Massachusetts.

The same thoughtful, measured, ""artistic"" feel of ""Stone Cold"" permeates this film, as well.  Some people find this approach slow and a bit dull, but I like it.  My only quibble this time out is a conclusion that wraps every plot point up a bit too quickly and neatly during the course of one scene: some explanation, a shooting, a little more explanation, a little more shooting, all questions answered.  The scene also shows us Jesse stupidly putting himself completely at risk as he attempts to spring his trap.

But, as said, that's just a quibble, and the movie is generally very good.  Just the fact that these Jesse Stone movies are clearly aimed at literate adults who enjoy skillful, nuanced dialogue and artful cinematography is enough for me to give these productions a strong recommendation.",1200441600,10,1170,5.1534391534391535
2801295,2,B000OVLBFS,"I kept waiting for this picture to get moving, but it never did. There is a lot of atmosphere and a lot of meaningful brooding, but nothing ever actually happens. As a result, the pacing of this film is painfully slow. We don't get anything like a story until nearly the very end, when Stone stumbles across the money-laundering scheme. Of course, part of the reason everything is so slow is that the filmmakers jettisoned the biggest part of Robert B. Parker's plotline. The money laundering is strictly secondary in the book. It's as if they did ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" without the mutiny. On the plus side, Selleck is excellent, and so is the rest of the cast, but they are torpedoed by the molasses-in-January pace and excess atmospherics. It's hard to believe the same director made the other two Jesse Stone pictures. Those two are excellent; ""Night Passage"" is not.",1195516800,6,871,4.7368421052631575

2801297,4,B000OVLBFS,"I've read all of Robert B. Parker's Spenser books, and then my ladyfriend picked me up one of his Sunny Randall books - mistakenly thinking that's what I liked.  I'd actually been getting a little tired of the Spenser books as I think the basic concept's getting a little dated - really, who would actually answer to the name ""Hawk?""  I didn't much care for Sunny Randall either - but Jesse Stone made an appearance in the book.  Here, I thought, was a character with some depth.  Moving through his life trying to adhere to a set of principles values while, at the same time, also struggling with his inner demons - now that's a flawed hero I can identify with.  I found ""Death in Paradise"" at my local Blockbuster, loved it, and have since bought it, this one, and ""Stone Cold"" - and loved them all.  I think Tom Selleck did a much better job in these movies than he ever did in his 'Magnum PI' series.  I'm also anxiously awaiting the DVD release of ""Sea Chase,"" having missed it's television airing.  The only reason I rated this, and the other two movies four stars instead of five was because of some continuity flaws from movie to movie.",1190246400,5,1144,4.440191387559809
2801298,5,B000OVLBFS,"Tom Selleck portrays the world-weary Jesse Stone perfectly.  The cinematography, the story line - This is a very good movie.  Wonderful cast.  Would like to have seen it before the others, but they are all great.",1188777600,2,212,4.833333333333333
2801299,4,B000OVLBFS,"The ""Jesse Stone"" series of TV movies goes against the recent trend of fewer and low-rated TV movies (mostly because they are uniformly bad). Possibly it's because it's not aimed at the almighty 18-25 demographic, a lot of more mature watchers will tune in for a movie made for adults.

""Night Passage"" is based on the first ""Jesse Stone"" novel of the same name by Robert B. Parker, best known for his ""Spenser"" novels and television series. Why this story, which ""introduces"" the Stone character when he initially moves the ex-cop from LA to Paradise, MA, was not made first (it's the 4th Stone flick) makes one wonder about what the studio suits were thinking.

What this film lacks in explosions and car chases it more than makes up for in character development, mood and style. Tom Selleck absolutely ""nails"" the character as the demon-plagued Jesse, trying to make a fresh start as Police Chief in a small New England town, away from the crime and grime of LA, along with his drinking problem and his inability to delete lingering feelings for his unfaithful ex-wife.

Parker should feel fortunate that the conversion to film didn't transform his literary character --as television and movies usually do-- into just another cliche-ridden, cardboard action figure. I still think people should be shot for what Hollywood did to ""Matt Helm"" years ago.

All four films are well-done and well-acted and well worth the time to appreciate the nuances of the characters and the setting.",1187049600,14,1483,4.92
2801300,3,B000OVLBFS,"After CBS aired ""Stone Cold"" in 2005, the ratings response prompted a series of TV movies. So, for the second entry, CBS went back to the beginning and adapted ""Night Passage,"" Robert B. Parker's novel that introduced Paradise, Massachusetts police chief Jesse Stone.

In ""Night Passage,"" we see a very different Stone from the first movie. In this prequel, he leaves Los Angeles after being fired from the police due to his alcoholism. His wife has left him, and booze seems to be the only thing getting him through his pain. And he arrives in Paradise as the hand-picked replacement for the outgoing police chief by an unscrupulous businessman who doesn't want a strong law presence in town. He's sadly mistaken and misjudges Jesse.

Like the other films in the series, ""Night Passage"" surrounds star Tom Selleck with a dynamite supporting cast. Saul Rubinek, Stephanie March, Stephen Baldwin, Mike Starr, Viola Davis and the underappreciated Stephen McHattie all provide support. The acting is not the problem with ""Night Passage,"" but the story is weak.

Maybe because the paramilitary, white supremacist storyline from Parker's book is ejected in favor of a money laundering scheme, but there's no mystery or suspense to be found here. Jesse suspects Hasty Hathaway from Day One, and he knows Joe Genest is involved with the mob. Besides, Joe doesn't make for a good menace because Jesse kicks his butt within five minutes of meeting him.

The strength of the piece lies with Selleck, who turns in a tour de force performance as a man who is trying to hold on to the last chance he's got in life. Recently, Selleck was nominated for an Emmy for his performance as Stone in ""Sea Change,"" and it's nice to see these films and Selleck getting their due.

Is it a bad movie? No, but it is not as good as ""Stone Cold"" or ""Death in Paradise."" I would recommend this one for established Jesse Stone fans only. Even though it is technically ""Chapter 1"" of Jesse's story, it is a bad film to start with.",1186531200,26,1999,4.749279538904899
