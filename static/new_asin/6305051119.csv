955444,4,6305051119,"Movie that u want to watch till end and don't get bored. Black slang talk really makes u laugh. Would like that movie would be little longer when all things leave half way. Music rocks behind and makes u feel happy.

In this movie it was fun seeing a bunch of people driving to Miami to do a music video.",1128643200,,304,4.066666666666666
955445,1,6305051119,"Ride is a road comedy that you don't want to take a trip to the video store for. Without a solid script or director this Ride turns into a bus wreck on film. The story is so full of plotholes you'll want to get off this bus before the first twenty minutes of the film.

An aspiring music director (Melissa De Sousa) desperate for a break makes a deal with her greasy boss (Downtown Julie Brown) to bus down a star's (Luther Campbell) talent to Florida for a music video. The group of ""entertainers"" is a bunch of standard road comedy misfits all rewritten to fit music stereotypes. The female singing duo, the sexy babe, the hard-core thug, the white rapper, and his bickering black partner, and the smooth operator crooner who's actually a misogynist. Sadly the actors are less talented than the one-dimensional characters they play. Keeping these no-talents in line during the trip is Pop (Malik Yoba in desperate need of a paycheck) Luke's best friend. Cedric the Entertainer and John Witherspoon are the drivers of the Jalop Charter bus they all get on for the ""Ride."" The beat up bus is actually in better shape than you will be in after you watch the movie. Make sure to have some alka seltzers or some Tums on hand before you pop this DVD in. You're going to need them soon after the ten-minute mark.

As they make the long journey from the ghetto of Harlem to Florida, we watch as several poorly written stories start to unfold. Because the characters are so one-dimensional, I didn't get to know anyone or how this experience changed them in any way. Instead of developing the characters, the screenplay uses very bad jokes to cover up its total lack of story. These gags are so bad I got motion sickness when they started the ""Ride"". I needed a couple of barf bags just to finish the movie. From stupid gags about the ethnicity of a white rapper, to a running gag about a two bumbling robbers (Lady of rage Guy in a down jacket while everyone else wore summer clothes) chasing down a thug for some bodega loot they stole, this movie just made me more nauseous on its long tedious journey to Florida. Laid back West coast cool Snoop Dogg as a southern hick? There's a ???moment if there ever was one. Hillbilly gags, gags about carjacking, all go nowhere. The most vomitrotious moment is when Pop asks Luther Campbell to fund a manhood program. What??? Luther Campbell playing, a hard core-misogynist, in this movie (not a stretch) is going to fund a manhood program to promote responsible behavior and good values among men. An MST3K moment if there ever was one.

You know a movie is bad when the actors' faces express frustration in the performances. Melissa De Sousa and Malik Yoba look like they are in pain for most of this movie. They struggle through the script looking for a bright spot to display their talents in but find none. Downtown Julie Brown looks so annoyed that she wants to choke someone. Cedric The Entertainer and John Witherspoon are just phoning it in here. Thankfully both have done better work in other movies(Boomerang, Hollywood Shuffle and Barbershop.) Ferdo Starr is his grating Q character from Moesha and Luther Campbell is well Luke.

Do yourself a favor and avoid this ""Ride."" Get on the next bus please.",1124064000,2,3248,4.6239168110918545
955446,3,6305051119,"I thought the movie would be really fun to watch I mean CEDRIC THE ENTERTAINER & BERNIE MAC and on top of that FREDRO STARR & MALIK YOBA.
All the people I mention did great work, but the movie it self weren't that well-written and couldv'e been much better however it was a pretty funny movie.
I bought the European Version and missed out on the 4 musicvideos that are as a bonus in the american edition and that pissed me off a little.
The soundtrack is better than the movie, but the movie is still o.k. if u don't pay too much for it.",1080604800,,537,4.123809523809523

I thought just some  second rate low budget comedy.. with the laughs  comin at  crude humour..but to my surprise  the  laughs were  ginuwine.. they were forced like you get in some movies..  a  good cast of  hip hoppers, unknowns, veterans..  a Slamming Soundtrack !  made this movie very entertaining",951436800,2,402,4.63768115942029
