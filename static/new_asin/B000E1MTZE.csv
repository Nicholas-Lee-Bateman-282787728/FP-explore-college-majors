2481175,5,B000E1MTZE,"Just got my box set today and popped in part 1 on my A-2. It was glorious to see the matrix in HD. You wonder if they knew when they made this movie, that Hi def was lurking around the corner. It's magnificent, can it get any clearer any more real? I thought pirates on Blu was great, this just takes the cake.",1181520000,,310,3.9365079365079363
2481176,5,B000E1MTZE,"If you own an HD DVD player its safe to assume that your into sharp images and clear powerful sounds. I own the original standard box set and like many, went ahead bought the HD version anyway. Well worth it.

The visual is incredible but for me the real difference is in the sound. Powerfull and crystal clear. I cant get enough of Trinity jumping out the building being chased by the Agent. Glass breaking and bullets flying are the perfect sound effects when listening to quality HD sound.

My opinion; HD is the better format right now. Blu-ray may have the most movies but HD has the better product.",1181520000,16,604,4.4818181818181815
2481177,5,B000E1MTZE,All I can say is that this movie was made for HD. Once you take a look at the Matrix in HD...you'll see what I mean. The picture and sound is incredible! movies like this is what HD is all about. I have no doubt that HD will win over Blu Ray because of quality titles like this. Once the price of HD movies come down(and they will...the average price on amazon is around 19.00...not too bad)it will be only a matter of time before standard DVD's will be a thing of the past...especially since HDTV's are now taking over the market.,1181520000,4,531,4.215686274509804
2481178,5,B000E1MTZE,"I've had this set for a couple days now and have watched all three films. The picture quality is outstanding and the sound is too (though I thought the SD soundtrack was amazing too, not a discriminating ear). There are so many things I never really noticed in the original SD DVD releases. For instance in the second film when Morpheus is giving his speach at Zion. In the HD version you can see him spitting when he talks. I saw a parody of this scene at the MTV movie awards that year and didn't get it. I guess you had to of seen it at the theater.

Some other things is the skin imperfections some of the actors have. I don't care about that sort of thing, but thought it was really cool to see people the way they really are. Also, I think HD and BR are going to change the way makup is applied for films. You can definately see some lipstick and blush on the male actors in a couple scenes. To make a long review shorter, buy the Matrix in High Definition. Even if you have BR it's a matter of time before it's released there too. Pick it up! Don't let this become a format issue, review the quality of the movie. It's a big enough market for mulitple formats these days.

PS. This cheaper set comes with a free download of the Animatrix. So unless you want 10 hours of extras go with this cheaper set. Me, all I care about are the movies. I have the Lord of the Rings collectors sets and have never placed a bonus disc in my DVD player. Not the case for everyone.",1180310400,89,1471,4.13986013986014
2481179,5,B000E1MTZE,"When the Matrix was originally released on standard DVD, it was the movie that most people used to showcase their home theater set-up. It's only fitting that The Matrix once again helps usher in the new standard for the nex-gen format. For anyone that has been hesitant to jump into the new DVD format, this box set will make you a new convert. The films look and sound spectacular and are each loaded with extra content from the original release. A MUST have collection.",1180224000,4,471,4.619047619047619

The sound is much improved, with greater punch, depth and surround effects; as it should be; DVD vs Bluray. The picture quality is also much enhanced with greater depth, contrast and clarity. Seems this specific set isn't available right now, but it's the same Bluray transfer as all the others, and for me the price was right.

2481269,5,B000E1MTZE,"I cut my philosophizing teeth on The Matrix - watched the original dozens of times
This was a mental baptism, and there is no going back once you take the Red Pill

Yes the second and third movies are nowhere near as good as the original, but the story does feel more complete as a trilogy, and I would definitely recommend at least watching the cut-scenes from the video games as well as The Anamatrix for the lore

Great deal on HD versions of a life-changing series

Terrible, horrible, no good, very bad movie. If you like special effects - and weird special effects - you might like it.

If you like good stories and characters, run!  If the special effects are backed out, there is a little pretentious philosophy crap and a whole lot of nothing.

The movie is also really dark. Literally. Lots of actual darkness on the screen.

2481332,5,B000E1MTZE,"It has to be said that The Matrix is not the most original concept, the style and ideas have been around before, mostly in Japan. It definitely however can be credited for bringing these concepts and ideas to most Westerners. And despite the obvious influences, and the fact that it's aged quite a bit, its still one of my favorite sci fi action movies. It's probably the most famous and groundbreaking of it's time so it's a shame that the sequels didn't live up to the hype.

 I remember seeing them in theaters and being very excited for them but once we got past that awesome opening scene of Reloaded I just remember being confused at all the long winded discussions and fake looking CGI. Whether someone is a fan of The Matrix or not there's no denying that for it's time it had amazing effects which were largely done practically. The dialogue was also scaled down as much as possible, more nuanced and to the point, unlike the sequels that take their time to explain everything in great detail. This above all else, aside from perhaps the plot itself, killed the sequels for me. The sequels can be fun, the second one more so than the third, but it just seems like they cranked everything to 11 and tried to include as much as they could without properly developing the basics. For those of us old enough to remember around this time they had also come out with a video game and another movie of sorts called The Animatrix, which admittedly I've never seen. It just seems like they had way too much going on at the time to properly focus on these sequels and really make sure they were ready for release. In short, I feel like the sequels were rushed for release and in doing so many problems immediately surfaced when compared to the original. The original Matrix had some silly stuff too right? No movie is perfect, but with the sequels they loaded it up with CGI effects, changed the tone, included many lengthy pretentious discussions, and contradicted many of the ideas and rules of the original movie.

I've still got a soft spot for these sequels and have great memories watching them, but obviously I still prefer the original for it's interesting and dark tone, as well as it's groundbreaking effects. Watching Neo fight a hundred Smiths or watching the last remaining humans defend their home from killer robots might sound awesome on paper but sometimes less is more. I still feel way more impact from seeing those simple yet well done action scenes from the first. I feel every punch, every kick. Neo swinging a pole around a hundred CGI Smiths started to get pretty cartoony to me.",1501891200,,2602,4.603448275862069

2481563,5,B000E1MTZE,"It is vain to retell these films, or this trilogy. But I would like to insist on the general structure of the world that is depicted in these movies.

There are three worlds. First of all the normal human world we know, New York essentially, that is in fact only an illusion created by the matrix, a program or a vast set of programs invented by the Architect who does not have any other identity and who pretends he is not human at the end. This illusion of a normal human world in which billions of people live has been created to simply control humanity in their growth, development, everyday life, etc. In other words we have a total digital dictatorship of which no human is conscious, well nearly no human is conscious. To keep this world in place and in peace the Architect has invented a set of Agents all called Smith, all similar, dressed the same, physically the same, etc, who have special powers to transport themselves at will where they want and to penetrate and possess any human being.

There is then Zion, the resisting human underground world in vast caves mostly artificial and with some kind of metallic skeleton. This world is human because the people living there are humans, but otherwise it is an artificial world, but it is managed by a council of representatives though we do not know how they are selected or appointed. Apart from this council the main institution is the armed forces since this underground world is under attack and in the midst of a war with the third world that seems to be in some kind of objective alliance with the matrix world. Note this human world is so cut off from the normal human, world, because of the matrix, that the only way is to jump from the underground world to the matrix world and the very few who can cross have to be plugged on some kind of digital program that transfers them, body and mind, to the over-ground world and yet keep their bodies underground, though they are then connected to the underground managing unit, though it seems this managing unit for that kind of transfer is on board of one vessel or ship that is some kind of space ship that can get out of the underground city and circulate outside  though they cannot normally reach the matrix world and they believe they cant reach the third world.

The third world is the world of machines. Apparently they raise human beings to get their energy and thus fuel their machines. Only at the end the main hero Neo will reach Machine City and cast a deal with the representative of this machine world. That deal will enable Neo to get some kind of truce in the war that is raging at the very moment, then an alliance between the two worlds, Neos and the machine world, against the Matrix because the Smith program has gone out of hand and the original agent Smith has multiplied to millions and has been able to simply take over the matrix world with only one clandestine link between the matrix world and the underground human world entirely controlled by a Frenchman, the Merovingian, who uses the Trainman and his train to smuggle things from one world to the other. With this alliance Neo is able to be sent to the matrix world that has become Agent Smiths world and to have the final fight with the original Agent Smith that will decide of the end.

The color of the matrix is green, like all the lines of codes on the computer screens, lines that work from top to bottom and then it is not clear if it is from left to right or from right to left. Green is the matrix color, though the Architect is dressed is some light creamy white suit. The illusion of a human world created by the matrix is multicolored like our own human world. The underground human world is highly dominated by brown and all brownish shades of brown, and there are quite a few: the people are vastly diverse in ethnic origins and heritage. They are dressed in all shades of brown, with an alternative light grey. Agent Smith is dressed in black and is white, a color intending to imply we are dealing with a very pure white world. He is dressed in black and wears black glasses more like some kind of blind man than sunglasses. Finally the machine world is all kinds of dark grey and black but with systematic red eyes because these machines have red eyes, have eyes. At the end it is revealed that blind Neo is able to see this machine world as pure light from white to bright yellow and bright orange.

The stake is thus to liberate the human world we know of this digital dictatorship of the Architect and let it go back to the normal palette of colors we know from sunup to sundown. It is clear too that modern civilization, science and technology can only produce what H.G. Wells already described in Time Machine, an industrious and industrial world living in total darkness and genetically descending from the working class, the Morlocks, exploiting and raising for meat a human species descending from the bourgeoisie, the Emoi, except that this machine world has no human presence at all, except as an animal raised to produce energy. On the other hand in its digital branch this modern world, science and technology can only enable one man to control the whole world and even to create a police of thought, an omnipotent corps of robotic androids. Imagine an army of millions of nanobots in all human bodies, all nanobots connected to one central unit managed by one man. The digital evolution leads to that. But there is hope because some humans will resist, and yet they need the vision of an oracle (a black lady that ages fast) and of a One who is a white man who can save the world with the help of Trinity, a white woman he is in love with and who is in love with him. This trinity of Oracle-One-Trinity is not the only trinity. The Oracle goes along with an East-Asian Seraph and a little South-Asian girl. We have there a strong reference to Christianity. Trinity and Neo will have to be sacrificed for the prophecy to come true and the matrix to be defeated. The sacrifice of Neo is typically in a crucifixion form, arms outstretched perpendicularly to the body and light effects are super-impressed on him in the form of a roman cross, and this roman cross will turn into a Greek cross of light. This Neo is thus a new Christ. This very strong Christian reference is founded on three worlds: the human world controlled by the matrix, the underground human world of the resistance and the distant machine world. Add to this that most teams in this trilogy are groups of three people. It is a ternary vision, though the digital world is based on a binary language. The dominance of the ternary figure is thus very clearly ideological, meaningful.

All in all it is a very fatalistic vision with a touch of hope in the form of a blind Messiah and an Oracle.

2481631,5,B000E1MTZE,"This more than a mere action movie trilogy, it is a modern-day allegory featuring Biblical nods throughout.  From the names of characters and the ship to the main character being sprawled out crucifixion style when meeting the machine version of God, these movies are filled with deep meanings hidden below a thick layer of action and style.  The second movie is only watchable as a bridge between the first and the third, as it doesn't stand well on its own, whereas the other two are excellent bookends.  They certainly must be watched in order for context.  Overall, I would highly recommend this movie to action fans as well as the intellectual watcher who will enjoy talking about the movie with friends and family afterward, comparing notes on what sly references they caught.",1471046400,2,782,4.901515151515151

2481679,5,B000E1MTZE,"At the beginning of his ministry, Jesus spoke his mind, but toward the end as the Jewish elites began looking for ways to condemn him for blasphemy, he switched to parables. The Matrix is one of those parables for our day.  Effective parables are powerful things for opening peoples' eyes - either you get it or you don't, and walk away thinking, ""Gee that was an interesting story, but I don't see what it had to do with my question.""

Mental (some say spiritual) preparation to understand what's going on in the world today is represented by the red and blue pills.  There will always be those who refuse to see; who are willingly blind.  Then there are those who take a peek, see what it really happening, but then chose to join with the conspirators.  All these are represented in the movie.  Too bad about the cyber violence though, it really detracts from the story.",1465689600,,872,4.5576923076923075

Blu ray only enhances the movies to make them even more enjoyable, & are really fun to watch.

2481933,4,B000E1MTZE,"Keanu does a good job as Neo, the extraordinary hero, throughout the whole series.  I was happy seeing some neat effects this series pulled off.  The iconic moments I mentioned in the headline were pleasing such as when Neo bends backwards as the bullets fly over his body and the way they filmed the action scenes.  While I thought part 1 was the best and very original.  The next ones went down slightly as they get a little heavier in philosophical themes.

Overall as a series, it's ok.  They did the best they could with the script I think.  It was interesting.",1434326400,,566,4.490196078431373

But I hadn't seen Reloaded & Revolutions since their theatrical release.  I was actually disappointed then, but not now.  In hindsight, you can only be wowed once regarding a new world.  What I hadn't paid attention to was the remarkable story that is carried through to the end.  It's a credit to the Wachowskis that they didn't dumb down this complex series of story threads.  The other realization was the wonderful chemistry between Keanu & Carrie-Anne -- their love was epic.",1433980800,,610,4.921568627450981

2481954,5,B000E1MTZE,"This review is only about the bluray disc and the packaging as more recent reviews, raised quality concerns.  Like others, I only want the movie.  To avoid problems, I purchased it directly from Amazon, rather than from any of its partner sellers.  I paid $10, free shipping on total order >$35.

The packaging is as pictured, all plastic with 3 disc mounts in the spine so you can turn it like a book, and just paper graphic inserts.

All discs played, the movies were quality bluray mastering in 2.40:1 aspect ratio, audio output selectable English 5.1or TrueHD, or multiple languages and subtitles.  The discs were a movie each, with extras in 4: 3 format, I don't know what extras are included in the ultimate edition, but in total what's included ran a long time; for example in the The Matrix disc has 300min of extras, plus 5 commentary tracks that will require rewatching the movie 5x.  The other discs had as long extras but just 2-3 commentaries.",1433203200,67,956,4.688622754491018

2482203,4,B000E1MTZE,"Excellent ""Triple Feature"" blu ray set.  I was a big fan of the original Matrix and I enjoyed the 2nd one too, but like most trilogies, the 3rd was a bit hokey.  I'm glad they were able to keep the cast together at least.  These movies look great on any bluray player.  The sound is great, the additional material/videos are ALL extremely interesting for any Matrix fan.  The behind the scenes footage of the wire rigs that these guys used to pull off some of the stunning fight sequences was also extremely entertaining.  Even non-Matrix fans would enjoy it.  I highly recommend this triple feature.",1420156800,,600,4.6571428571428575

Here is something you will be suprised at...I was. I bought a 120hz tv (3D) and something suprising was goin on. The speed of the higher hertz slowed down the film to what one would call ""Real Time"". This ""Real Time"" makes all movies seem like you are 'on the Set' experiancing the movie as it's 'being filmed. Like a fifties teleplay.
  You actually start noticing things that are ""Movie Fakery"". It is after all Pretend..I know this. Its takes away from being ""In the Movie"" to Being on a set. You DO notice also that instead of characters portrayed actors...you find you are noticing its Actors portraying characters. It's Very strange. I get more into the Actors skill than the ""Movie Magic"". Next time you are at your local tv store check out any movie at 120hz.

In any event, the Blu Ray quality of these movies is good, not the best I have seen.

I bought it because yes, I have a 55"" HDTV and a surround system, but mainly because I never bought the entire trilogy on DVD, and this set was under $20 at the time.  If you have a Blu Ray machine that up-converts DVD's to HD  and you have the full set on DVD, and you're just an all around hard core scifi fan, maybe put your money toward something like the Blu Ray / 4K [yes 4K] set of the new Total Recall currently available for pre-order.

2482657,3,B000E1MTZE,"my daughter summed it up after we watched the whole thing.  It had been a long time since I watched these, but I really did enjoy them at first.  However, on watching them more than once, I must admit that they do not quite meet the test of excellence, where you can see more and more each time or interpret them differently at various periods in one's life.  (That is true of, say, 2001, but most definitely not for Matrix.)

On the good side, the action and to a degree the characters are good.  We really enjoyed the fight scenes, particularly with the added dimension of the weird way it can occur in the Matrix.  This will stand the test of time.  OK, the CGI appears a bit dated, but it still works.  As this is the core of the film, it is fine and worth the price of admission.

Regarding the characters, I would say about 1/3 of them are excellent, but the rest of them range from mediocre to, well, pretty stupidly unbelievable.  On the positive side, you have the human prophet Morpheus and his devoted acolyte, Trinity.  They are tough and interesting.  There are also many beings in the Matrix, such as the oracle or the architect, that are quite original and fun.  Alas, a whole raft of them seemed unconvincing to me, such as the angry commanders jealous of Morpheus' defiant faith.  Then there are weird characters like the Merovingian and Persephone, whose behavior is so inhuman as to be unfathomable and not worth trying to unravel.  FOr whatever reason, I can no longer suspend my disbelief while watching, which I regret - it didn't help my daughter that I found lots of their pronouncements laughable, e.g. ""some things never change and some things do"" which Morpheus says over and over and over.  I have concluded that much of the acting simply isn't very good.  I mean, did we need to see Cornel West talk in his pseudo-jive here?

The greatest fault of the film, however, was that it acts as if it is making some kind of profound statement.  The film is full of flabby philosophical quips or cryptic references, such as the enigmatic babbling of the architect, but on closer examination, there really is less than meets the eye on the initial viewing.  After puzzling on it the first time I saw it, it now just sounds silly to me.  OK, there is humor in it as well.  Also, don't get me wrong:  I don't take film all that seriously, but it is fun to feel a sense of wonder during the viewing and it is completely lacking in Matrix.

I say this with far more regret than disdain, because frankly I would rather be able to go with it.  I think of other ""heavies"" like Red Planet or Contact - somehow, they continue to succeed as a viewing experience even if they don't have quite the depth of 2001.  Recommended:  just don't expect you will want to view them more than a few times.",1366675200,4,2802,4.432485322896282

The packaging: plain, simple yet very attractive. The box is made of cardboard, with the matrix screen image (letters falling down) at the center.
The discs come in separate slim cases, and include the all the 3 movies. The packaging is good, but designed when there were few extremely well-made special edition boxed sets to compare.

The movies:
This is the definitive edition in my opinion, with great 1080p video and hifi surround sound. The video and sound altogether make you feel like your right in the middle of the action.... A great action movie... And if you're a matrix fan I think it's a must have.
As matrix trilogy is kinda old today, most people already know the plot, and I think there's no point in discussing the story, the characters and the fx.

The sound:
The sound fx are really great.... The surround really makes you feel closer to the action, make you believe you're really there, inside the Matrix. The soundtrack is also fantastic. I think the scores are so creatively placed on the scenes that they help create the mood for whatever is going to happen. I really loved the party song in Zion.... The sound is definitely a blu-ray quality sound and really keep up with the excellent video.

Overall:
The movies are great !!! The quality is amazing.... Too bad the hero dies at the end....That was not fun.... Anyway, the sound is of superior quality and the package is old, simple, but good looking. I'd totally give it a 5 star overall.

2482737,3,B000E1MTZE,"The Matrix (1999) 3/5

I've always called the first Matrix film a rip-off. It's a mix of many different films put together with component parts stolen from the Terminator (robots rule the future and have enslaved the remainder of humanity), Total Recall (futuristic 'Is it a dream or reality' sci-fi) and even Johnny Mnemonic (futuristic cyberpunk trash starring Keanu Reeves as a guy who can plug computers into his head and 'go into them'), plus various other works by William Gibson and a lot of Anime.

Thomas 'Neo' Anderson, is a computer programmer/hacker who meets with the mythical cyber-terrorist Morpheous, who asks Neo if he wishes to know the truth about the world or live a lie forever. Neo chooses truth and soon wakes in a gel-filled pod in a techno-hell future. His body, and billions of others, is nothing more than a battery to power the machines that rule the future (exactly what they do with this world that they now rule is not explored).

Convinced that Neo is 'The One', Morpheous trains him to be deadly digital warrior, but this set-up doesn't go beyond fighting a sentient program called Agent Smith. The war against the machines comes later.

There's no denying that the film, unfortunately, was massively influential for virtually every action film that followed. Gone was the 'Die Hard' formula where action was gritty, somewhat realistic, and with practical stunt-work. In it's place they all went for excessive CGI, green-tinted photography, impossible cameras, and impossible physics. The Matrix is semi-stylish with it, but it doesn't ever entertain or excite me.

It's the style of the Matrix that's more fondly cherished than the story. It won 4 technical Academy Awards, proving that all the Matrix is is eye-candy. Call that narrow-minded if you want but I believe this movie is no more than a very, very popular cult movie. A contradiction in terms yes, but still the most appropriate way of describing it.

The Matrix Reloaded (2003) 2.5/5

Arriving four years after the original, The Matrix Revolutions should have delivered action from start-to-finish since we've already had over 2 hours of set-up. Doesn't happen. Instead we get many, many scenes of long, rhetorical dialogue that wants to be deep and meaningful but instead comes across as pompous and boring. This is what happens when filmmakers are given free reign without studio interference. Damned if you do and damned if you don't, I guess.

With the machines digging their way down to Zion, Neo, Trinity and Morpheus clash with the Council and various superiors on how to deal with the oncoming assault. You'd think the last thing they have time for is lots of pretentious talking.

None of the many, superfluous fight scenes are exciting. They are virtually all about blocking. There is no real impact. Watching people twirl five times sideways after a soft kick to the chest doesn't make up for it. I can't understand how anybody has ever been impressed or entertained by these stupid, impossible physics.

Keanu Reeves ain't no actor, but I can deal with it most of the time. However, Carrie-Anne Moss is very easy to look at, and Agent Smith owns every scene he's in. I do appreciate Monica Belluci's translucent dress too.

It's an effort to get through this film. I've only watched it twice since it came out in 2003. There's just no reason to go back to it. There are films half the length, with a tenth of the budget, that have more action, and coherence.

The Matrix Revolutions (2003) 1.5/5

With five hours of set-up established in the two previous movies you'd expect The Matrix Revolutions to be action from start to finish. Wrong! It's the same long bore as with Reloaded. After about forty scenes with long, pretentious dialogue the film then delivers...more scenes of gibberish exposition. The Wachowskis probably think/wish that it has some deep meaning, but it really is just mumbo-jumbo.

Neo now has the ability to use some of his Matrix powers in the real world, while a copy of Agent Smith has 'possessed' one of the humans. Hundreds of thousands of Sentinels are just feet away from breaking into Zion, and the digital Agent Smith takes over the entire Matrix after overwriting the Oracle.

The Zion battle with the Mechs and Sentinels is kind of exciting, but it's the only part of this 129-minute movie that will quicken your pulse. The rest threatens to stop it permanently. There's plenty of CGI, some it good (the Sentinels) some it horrible (anything with Neo and Smith). The fight scenes are now just a bore. Watching people walk on the ceiling while firing guns doesn't excite me. Watching people slam into wall and making a big hole got old the first hundred times it happened too.

You've never seen a film with such unjustifiable delusions of grandeur. The Matrix universe had so much potential, but the Wachowskis squandered it. I will never watch this film again. Twice (with a nine-year gap between those viewings) was more than enough.

The Blu Rays are presented in 2.40: 1080p with great picture quality, but it often highlights the bad CGI and makes it look even more fake. All have Dolby TrueHD sound with lots of old, recycled extras.",1329350400,9,5180,4.87485779294653

2482885,5,B000E1MTZE,"I have to agree with the general consensus, High Definition was made for movies like The Matrix Trilogy. Or is that the other way around? Either way, The Matrix Trilogy looks absolutely stunning in 1080p/1080i High Definition.

I remember when the first Matrix came out on DVD, we all thought the picture quality and audio quality were the best thing we had ever seen. And it was, at the time. Now, the Matrix returns, this time in HD, and it once again takes the cake as the best picture and audio quality ever seen.

I cannot help but laugh when people tell me that ""there is no difference between standard definition and high definition""; all I want to do is show them The Matrix Trilogy HD side by side with its standard counterpart and watch their mouth hit the floor. Seriously, watching this trilogy in HD breathes new life into it, and movies in general. There is a HUGE difference between 480p/480i (standard definition) and 1080p/1080i (High Definition).

You can see every imperfection on every actor, their pimples, their pores, their scars. And its all beautiful. Details, details, details. You can clearly see the detail on virtually every object in the foreground of each shot, each scene. Colors are vibrant and clear; the whole picture has ten times the clarity of its standard definition counterpart. The picture is so clear that you can make out every piece of fabric that comprises the actors clothing; to me THAT is amazing.

For a particularly amazing scene, check out the Lobby shootout segment in the first Matrix film. Then compare it to the regular DVD version. You WILL see a huge difference.

All three films are pristine and clean from any artifacting, dirt and any other blemishes. There is a slight film grain pervading each film, but nothing that wasn't originally present in the source material, and it is never intrusive or distracting.

The audio is so crisp and booming, bringing the film to life. If you have a surround sound setup it is even better. From the high intensity explosions to the pulse pounding music is so clear and pristine that it clearly beats that of any movie theater quality. The audio is presented in Dolby 5.1 and Dolby 5.1 TrueHD. Both are spectacular.

These kinds of details may not be a huge deal to the average joe, but to someone who really enjoys movies it makes all the difference in the world. Before I witnessed HD with my own eyes I too thought that it didn't really matter how blurry and bland the movie looked. But now, after I have tasted the divine, I cannot go back. Standard def movies look plain and muddy. Yeah, I'm spoiled now, but I don't care. High Definition is the way to go.

So, we all know the story of the Matrix Trilogy, and most of us can agree that the first Matrix is undoubtedly the best, while the 2nd and 3rd iterations are slightly inferior products in the storyline department. Yet, all three are equally amazing in my mind, and this HD trilogy easily  ranks as one of my all time favorite films ever.

There are extras, mostly ports from the DVD version of the Matrix films, but there is also something called ""In Movie Experience"" that brings you even deeper into the world of the Matrix and the mind of the infamous Wachowski Brothers.

HD-DVD adopters truly lucked out with this fine trilogy, something Blu-Ray owners are literally begging for.
Its sad that HD-DVD is dead now, what with Toshiba giving up in the format war. Blu-Ray fans need not fret though, The Matrix Trilogy will soon become Blu; its only a matter of time. For all of the HD-DVD die-hards and early adopters, I implore you, pick up The Complete Matrix Trilogy on HD-DVD. You will be very happy and pleased with this purchase. The picture is amazingly stunning, the audio is better than the movie theater, and the total experience will blow you away.

HD-DVD owners, do yourself a favor and grab this item while you can. This is definitely demo material.",1204156800,2,3924,4.662807525325615

2482889,4,B000E1MTZE,"What can be said about the Matrix trilogy that hasn't been repeated ad nausea um so far? Since you have already heard the love/hate argument of the trilogy, i will comment on the quality of the product.
The high def rip of these films is excellent. You do notice an improvement on the detail and although it's not a vast difference, due to the quality of the standard def transfers, it is an improved experience.
The color palate is where you notice the high def difference. It seemed on the matrix ultimate collection the green overtones were a bit more distracting and washed out the other colors. Here in the high def realm, the  green tint is more of a subtle overtone and the other palates are sharp and enhance the story instead of distract from whats going on.
  The pip and interactive menus are such a sweet treat. I love being able to switch between audio tracks and scenes without having to default back to the main menu. The list of extras are almost the same, but the big additional extra is the audio commentary from the psychologists that loved the series and the movie reviewers that hated it, quite a different experience watching it with those opinions piping in, I learned to appreciate the series a bit more after listening to the opposing views.
  All in all this collection is a must have for any HD DVD owner and film fan",1197244800,,1344,4.51440329218107
2482910,5,B000E1MTZE,"There is no excuse for anyone to have not watched this movie. But how many people who watch it really understand that it is gives a superb analogy to understanding our current reality.

We live in a world of illusion, distraction, economic slavedom and material indulgence. Breaking free from these culturally programmed distractions will enable you to break free from the real Matrix that we inhabit.

Still think the Matrix is fantasy???  To really explore the reality of our 'matrix' try reading the book by Ouspensky called ""In Search of the Miraculous"", and the book by Laura Knight-Jadczyk called ""The Secret History of the World"".

It's your choice,  get swallowed up in the illusion of job titles, pensions, media propagated fear, control and consumption or start living your own truly free life!!!!",1196035200,,807,5.083333333333333
2482911,5,B000E1MTZE,"This High Def version of all three movies is a revelation.  Right down to the matrix code itself.  The picture is crisp and clear with details never before visible.  The sound is crystalline in it's precision and buoys the story along with kid gloves.  In dark scenes, such as under the bridge when they first take Neo under their wing, you can see Keanu's make-up as clear as day.  Rouge, pancake, and delicately done eyebrows. This occurs with all the actors throuhout the movie, though, after your initial reaction it is not distracting.  However this could present a problem for movie makers and I wonder that the Warchowski's didn't think of it since they knew they were in virgin territory filming the movies in High Def.  They thought of everything else!!!
To me though the real breathtaking scene wasn't the action sequences (even though they DO take your breath away).  It was Neo's visit to the Oracle.  The nuances flittering across her face as she deftly guided him in the right direction is a study in acting.  You can see the depth of her disease eating away at her in and under her eyes, but her talent will out and such detail in facial expression and tonal delivery is as rare as an Olivier or a Tracy.  It is a pity that she was unable to complete the trilogy, and it hurt the overall project more than most will admit.  However this is a review of the HD-DVD version of these films and let's just say that I have watched the movies probably twenty times each since their release and this was the first time I really and truly saw them.  Nuff said.",1195776000,,1566,4.491166077738516
2482912,4,B000E1MTZE,"I'm not going to review the films but rather give my opinions on the technical aspects of this set. I have to say that I was somewhat underwhelmed. Perhaps this comes from the fact that the original Matrix was the standard for testing your presentation back in the earliest days of DVD. It was THE best dvd out there. Because of this, I thought that this would be the same for the newest generation of movie playing technology. While the films look good, they don't look great. There is little to no compression ""noise"", artifcacts are nonexistant, and edges look good. What you get is a very clean picture. However, it's not as sharp as it could be. Perhaps this is a result of creative decisions by Wachowski's, or it's a byproduct of the coloring and filmstock used. Either way, what you're left with is a relatively softer picture than what I at least had expected. While I love the movies, the video quality of this set just doesn't knock my socks off like some other HD-DVDs and Blu-ray discs do. TrueHD sound works well if you're able to play it. Otherwise it's the standard 5.1 which, while uncompressed, is still pretty much the same as the standard dvd set. If you like the films and want the best possible presentation of them, then this set (or the ultimate one) is for you. If you want something to show off your equipment, you might want to look elsewhere first.",1195516800,2,1376,4.530120481927711
2482913,5,B000E1MTZE,"I know of friends who only saw the first Matrix movie and that is a shame, as all three parts of the trilogy belong together as the journey of Neo and the change that happens to him along the way. It is a fantastic job that has been done in keeping the quality at the top without descending into making B-grade follow up movies as is often the case with sequels.

It is a movie that can be seen on many levels. Some will see it just as a great action movie which it is, but there is so much more to this film. It is a fantastic depiction of the journey of the spiritual seeker and the difficulties that he encounters within himself as he starts pushing against the prison of his own mind and the multitude of programs that operates and which keep us small.

It also neatly depicts the way humans are kept as 'food for the moon' in Gurdjieff's words or simply food for ultra terrestrials. In the film this is depicted as humans, being little less than cultivated biological batteries for the machines. A scary thought that we humans might not be at the top of the feeding chain.

All three parts are worth watching more than once, as you will undoubtedly see new things each time. Things that start making sense only after some time of reflection and reading. In this regard I can recommend reading the book by Ouspensky called ""In Search of the Miraculous"", and the book by Laura Knight-Jadczyk called ""The Secret History of the World"".",1195344000,4,1436,4.411320754716981

2482942,5,B000E1MTZE,"First let me say I know there are alot of people out there who think only the first movie in this trilogy is any good. I somewhat agree with that statement. True the sequels were not as good as whole movies as the first. But they are full of scenes that rule,and with the power of a DVD remote I become the ultimate film editor.  Ill skip boring sequences and just get right to good stuff. Sometimes in reloaded I forget Zion even exists cause I skip right thru it.  The picture quality is amazing on all 3 movies and I use it for demo material to show off my system all the time.  I highly recommend this purchase.",1182816000,5,615,4.151260504201681
2482943,5,B000E1MTZE,"There really isn't much to say about this box set.  You get all three Matrix movies in full high-definition, as well as three separate In-Movie Experience tracks along with all the same great supplements that came with the DVD version.  At $65 it's a little pricey, but this is as cheap as it gets and fans of the Matrix won't be disappointed.

Video quality: 4.5
Audio quality: 5.0
Special features: 4.5 (get the Ultimate collection for the most content)
Overall value: 4.5",1182816000,,474,4.7560975609756095
2482944,5,B000E1MTZE,"I assume you've already seen the Matrix, and probably love it, and this is the hands-down best version of the trilogy ever released. The quality is simply amazing, even a better remaster than some other HD-DVDs like Serenity. The colors are way more vibrant and the detail is incredible. During the famous lobby action scene I swear you can see every single scrap of tile, speck of dust and individual bullet. You will see details in the background you never knew were there. This is the Matrix at its finest.

As a test to the quality, I had the original widescreen DVD and this new HD-DVD playing back-to-back on my Samsung 32"" LCD. Quickly switching back and forth between formats I could not believe the difference. In comparison, it made the original DVD look like a bootleg VHS copy. I kid you not. Some scenes on HD-DVD look so real its like you are staring out the window. If you don't yet have an HD-DVD player, this is a great first set to pick up with the player and a great movie to show off to friends how good HD-DVD really is.

As a note, I bought this version over the ""Ultimate"" collection for a few reasons. One being that the Animatrix on the Ultimate edition (along with all the other bonus content) is only in 480p. Since I already own the original Animatrix DVD, theres not much point. The Complete Trilogy still includes a decent amount of bonus features and you can get a free download of the Animatrix if you have an Xbox360. Also, the Complete version has nice looking disc art, while the Ultimate version has blank looking 2-sided discs. If you are the kind of fan that actually wants to watch 12-hours of behind the scenes footage, get the Ultimate. But if you are like me and just want to see the movies in HD then this version is just fine.",1182643200,32,1770,4.443076923076923
2482945,5,B000E1MTZE,"The Movies Themselves are the science fiction cult classics written, directed by The Wachowski Brothers and primarily star Keanu Reeves as ""Neo"", Laurence Fishburne as ""Morpheus"", Carrie-Anne Moss as ""Trinity"" and Hugo Weaving as ""Agent Smith."" If you're one of the of the few people who have never seen these films then you're in for ""one hell of a high definition treat!"" These films include some of the best action sequences and CG special effects since Star Wars. Don't get mad at me if you're a fanboy for that statement, I'm just saying that these flicks really have set the benchmark for this type of action in Hollywood. It's been copied time and time again but no one can do anything as incredible as these trilogy of films did in theatrical release. This is THE BEST HD DVD RELEASE YET, hands down.

Video Quality on this release is VC-1 encoded on three 30gb Dual-Layered HD DVD's, one disc for each film obviously. As stated above these films are by far probably some of the best films ever for action sequences and CG special effects. So this release obviously held high expectations from everyone to be an amazing video transfer not only on the first film but all three. Well they didn't let us down, this is some of the best ""eye candy"" in high definition available. The video transfer on the first film ( ""The Matrix"" ) isn't quiet as good as the second two films in the trilogy video-wise at points but it is definitely a transfer I would have rated at least a 4 1/2 if I reviewed the films seperately. This is kind of disappointing in a way but you have to realize that film probably wasn't shot on the same type of cameras and such. Because the second two films were shot planned back to back they really hold the same video quality feel. I'm not complaining though, don't get me wrong. This is a great release in terms of video quality!

Audio Quality on this release is in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (which is by far the best choice and really going to blow you away) and Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 @ 640kbps. These films aren't just known for being eye candy, so that being said I'd just like to state for the record ""These are the best 5.1 surround mixes I have ever heard in my entire life."" And I'm not just saying that to give this release even 5's for everything. You'll have to hear it to believe it obviously but take my word, it's nothing short of AMAZING!

Bonus Materials are by far the real highlight on this release and nothing short of breakthrough. The ""In-Movie Experience"" is included on all three films and are all the best ""In-Movie Experience"" features that Warner Brothers has yet to offer on HD DVD. The Wachowski Brothers have a written commentary (which is the same on each disc) but there's also 2 different commentaries by Philosophers and Film Critics across all three films as well. If you read the written commentary first by The Wachowski Brothers you'll understand why the 2 commentaries mentioned above are there. Also The first film features 2 more commentaries than the sequels, one that even includes some of the cast and crew. The special features go all the way to as far back as the ""Enter the Matrix"" video game and it's exclusive cut-scenes. Music videos for songs featured on the film's soundtrack, For instance Marilyn Manson's ""Rock is Dead"" and another music video by P.O.D. are there too. There's tons of ""making of"" documentaries on each film to keep you busy for at least a week. Then you've got the music from The Matrix in ""Matrix Reloaded."" This release is the cheaper version of the trilogy and I can honestly tell you that this version packs a lot of punch for the price tag. Now I'm sure that more expensive ""Ultimate Matrix Collection"" offers more bonus materials on it's extra HD DVD but you choose whatever version you want, you're going to be extremely satisfied either way.

2482946,5,B000E1MTZE,"The Complete Matrix Trilogy is absolutely incredible and you get a free copy of The Animatrix if you have the Xbox 360 HD DVD player with Xbox Live access! This set already includes over 25 hours of extras and I feel there is no need to waste the extra cash on the Ultimate Matrix Collection unless you do not have The Animatrix and Xbox Live. Also you get to watch 'Enter The Matrix' (over 1 hr long) which are all the live action scenes from the videogame that shows what Narobi & Ghost were doing while Neo was battling his way thru The Matrix.

The picture quality of this HD DVD set is flawless and the first film (though 4 years older) blends in perectly with the final two Films. I know the Wachowski brothers are proud of this release!  The In Movie Experience (picture in picture extras)is perfect and the Dolby TrueHD is astounding!  Do yourself a favor and make this (along with Planet Earth -HD DVD) your first boxed set purchases on HD DVD.  I was never that interested in Matrix Reloaded but now that the HD DVD picture has kept me glued to the screen, I've learned to appreciate the film and have watched it numerous times.

With your purchase, you can rest assured that Warner Brothers, with HD DVD, has delivered! You're going to absolutely love the picture quality and enjoy the sound when Neo takes on over 100+ Agent Smiths! Lastly you get a ton of commentaries from not only the actors, but philosphers such as Cornell West, and even critics that critized the film!  The Complete Matrix Trilogy has tons of replay value from In Movie Experience to extras.  If you own an HD DVD player buying this set is a must!  It truly is the Look and Sound of PERFECT!  Thank You Warner Bros.!!!",1181779200,6,1703,4.45016077170418
2482947,5,B000E1MTZE,"As the high definition wars wage on the argument goes back and forth as to the future of HD-DVD and Blu-Ray (watch everyone's jaw drop when a third format comes out of left field and ends up winning).  For those of us who are fortunate to have HD-DVD players, the faithful day that we get a really great movie that was MADE for HD has come.  The Matrix Trilogy is a great storyline that comes equipped with killer special effects and beautiful scenery.  In the HD-DVD installment, the picture is so precise and crisp that I spent half the time I was watching it trying to take in background items I was never able to see on the DVD version.

The sound is incredible and with uncompressed Dolby, the opening explosion scene of Matrix: Reloaded had my non-tech buddies giving an impressed ""wow"".  The encoding has almost no flaws (on the discs I recieved they all played all the way through without stalling once) and the occassional grain found in 1st generation HD-DVD and Blu-Ray is non-existent on this boxed set.

Xbox 360 owners even get a free standard definition download of Animatrix, making this set definitely worth the price.

If you own HD-DVD, it's because of movies like these.  Purchasing this boxed set should be a no-brainer (although I would avoid the ultimate collection on HD as only the movies are in HD, just like this boxed set).

NOTE TO XBOX 360 OWNERS: Make sure to get your system online and download the spring 07 update for your system (if you haven't already;  you'll now have a ""Marketplace"" blade if you have) as well as the HD-DVD update patch that should download automatically once you play a newer HD-DVD (the Matrix definitely qualifies).",1181779200,15,1674,4.663265306122449
