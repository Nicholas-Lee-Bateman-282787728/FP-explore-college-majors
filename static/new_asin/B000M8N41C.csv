8167106,1,B000M8N41C,"I thought this was going to be like a quality documentary, like something National Geographic would do.  Instead, it's just somebody riding on a boat and recording the flora and fauna that they see.  There is no narrator here.  It's all just instrumental country music.  No one asks or answers, ""How can we preserve Florida's biodiversity when our human population just keeps getting bigger and bigger?""
This is for environmentalists only.  I think the makers just assume you love the Everglades and want something done to keep them around.  For some people, ""a picture is worth one thousand words.""  This documentary does nothing to connect the dots.
You could have this playing in the background at a party.  You could show it for a few minutes before an environmental panel at a conference.  Otherwise, this is visuals with no substance.",1204243200,2,840,4.942857142857143
