1904673,5,B0000ACNQH,I loved this movie from the first time I saw it in the 90's I actually met the man in the story at a convention where they played the movie and then he came out to speak and surprised us all.,1215648000,2,191,3.682926829268293
1904674,5,B0000ACNQH,"Fantasic movie showing true Christianity at it's finest. The movie is a family favorite but may be tough to understand for 6 and under. It showed how a missionary came to a remote village, against all odds and his own church, and created thousands of Christians for Jesus....  A true story worth seeing to give us all hope, even if we have to go against worldly authority to follow Jesus....",1192320000,18,391,4.585714285714285
1904675,4,B0000ACNQH,I am not a DVD owner but there are some that I just have to have.  This is a keeper.  It shows both the power of God and the power of what one person can do in obedience to God.,1189036800,8,177,3.4
1904676,5,B0000ACNQH,"We have just viewed this movie in 2007 even though it was made two decades ago. It is an amazing story and a powerful testament to the power of the Word and to what can be accomplished by God through those with faith and determination. Trust me, you will want to tell others about this movie. Please do not be put off by the apparent slow pace in the beginning. The story grows and grows and gets better and better.",1170547200,7,415,4.2
1904677,5,B0000ACNQH,Among a host of awesome lessons this history teaches us to remember our creator when we are young and strong. Anybody that wants to serve the Lord should be very moved and inspired by this movie.,1168473600,2,195,4.444444444444445
1904678,5,B0000ACNQH,"Beyond The Next Mountain is a unique story. Unique because it is something that had never happened before in northeast India. In fact, this story is one that most likely has happened only one or two times in history. A barbaric tribe in India receives news of Jesus through one young white man from England, which in turn leads a tribal boy in a future generation to learn English, Hebrew and Greek, who in turn creates a written language for his people, then translates the Bible into that language. He goes on to establish schools for his people to learn both to read and write the language he created. And later, with the help of many others, he mails millions of Bibles to people all over the world using addresses listed in telephone books.

When I watched this movie I thought, ""I wonder where this person is right now in the world."" It wasn't until I watched it two more times that I finally saw at the end that it gave contact information for his ministry office. It was a 45-minute drive from my house in Denver, Colorado! He and many of his family members have been living in Colorado Springs for several years working at his ministry, Bibles For The World.

I very much recommend watching this. The acting is superb. And through this film, I believe you too will receive a revelation that God's true ways are astounding and unlimited.",1165622400,84,1345,4.553719008264463
1904679,5,B0000ACNQH,"I have seen this movie twice, and both times was struck with the focus of one who ""moves mountains"" to reach a goal.  Most of us do not know this type of focus.  Granted, God touched this individual through the prayers of his father and mother, but his open, pure and sincere heart along with his willingness to do what it takes to reach the goal enabled the God of the Universe to touch his life with the end results of success upon success.  Even his willingness to wait to be with his beloved one showed his ultimate trust in his Lord and God.

I had not heard of this man until seeing this movie.  It is mind stretching to learn of how many lives have been touched just by one individual.  This movie is a must see for anyone wanting encouragment in tackling the impossible.",1118534400,45,778,4.294520547945205

Amazing what one missionary sparked and did for these people and how it carried on for generations now.  Super good story.  Remember this movie is not produced by an expensive cinematic team, but if you are after good Truth in movies and a terrific story, you will enjoy this very much.  Not boring at all!

It is amazing how Rochonga was led by God to learn English, then Hebrew and Greek in order to translate the Bible into the language of his people, and how all of this started by God's work of one missionary. It even has a happy ending where He finds a good wife and still does God's work.

1904712,5,B0000ACNQH,"I bought this as a potentially interesting story for the younger folk half-expecting a borderline smarmy, formulaic tale.  I was blown-away by the cultural and experiential complexities that emerged, and the courage and commitment exhibited in several of the characters.  And there was no glossing over of the waxing and waning of their courage and commitment as the real world with its distractions, harshness, and discouragements intruded.  That ring of veritas made it all the more moving to me.",1400976000,,498,5.2784810126582276

A story of God's working  through first a determined missionary and then a boy to bring God's word to the rest of the tribe. Miraculous!

Great acting and filming, not a cheesy low budget type at all.",1398988800,,367,4.318840579710145

1904721,4,B0000ACNQH,"Beyond the Next Mountain is an incredible true story of the life of Rochunga Pudaite, a young boy who lives in the north east jungles of northwest India. Many years before he was born a missionary visited his tribe for a short time until the government kicked him out but the work that he had done it still going on today. Although not the best script or the best movie making skills this movie is a must watch for all those the believe in the power of God. I first watched this movie back in the 1980s and remembered it so well that I wanted to get my own copy. It's a great family movie, nothing offensive. It is a bit slow at times so stick with it. The payoff is worth it.

1904726,5,B0000ACNQH,"This is such an amazing story that I am at a loss for words. I had read the book years ago, and the movie is faithful to the book. What this father-- and especially the son --risked for the sake of obtaining a Bible in their language was incredible. How the message of the gospel transformed an entire village is-- what the gospel is all about-- changing hearts and lives.

1904730,5,B0000ACNQH,True stories are the best and this is a great story of God's faithfulness to one man who dared to plant seeds where no on else would go.

He feels like a failure for many decades, but seed that was planted takes root and continues to grow, but not without opposition.  The key indigenous leader of the believers realizes the need to have a Bible in the language of his people.  His own son ""gives his name to Jesus"" for this work, journeys through the perils of the jungle, to a school where he learns English.  Years later, after a world detour, he completes the translation of the Bible.

Then he receives word of the whereabouts of the missionary that had come to his tribe so many decades before.  He shows up at his door, to the immense surprise of the old missionary.  Only then does this man learn of the fruit that abounded to his account in the lives of the people of India.

This was an awesome story of a boy who dedicated his life to bringing the full scripture to the indigenous Christians of his tribe.
The film stock was somewhat poor, (and restoration for DVD didn't seem to take place (I watched in on DVD)), though this is often to be expected with foreign films.  Still, the acting, direction, and editing were quite good which is impressive as many American made Christian films (being independent) often lack some of these qualities.

A young Christian man from Wales wanting the bring the gospel.  He arrives in India where government officials block his travel--but he goes anyway.  In time, he is expelled, leaving one young convert and no translation of the Bible.  Follow the story from grandfather, to son, to grandson.

1904749,5,B0000ACNQH,"I have to admit upfront that I love watching movies with heart-pounding graphics, high definition video and immersive surround sound.  I found none of that in this movie.  What I did find, however, was an incredibly moving story of challenge and triumph by those of faith.  One missionary's (Watkin Roberts) faith in God drove him to share the gospel of Christ with the Hmar tribe (known for cutting off heads) in northeast India, even in opposition by the mainstream missionaries who had no regard for this ruthless people.  Ironic, huh?  To most missionaries the Hmar people were as the Ninevites were to Jonah, not worthy of God's love, but not to young Roberts. Chawnga accepted Roberts' teaching of faith in Christ and his tribe was forever changed.  Chawnga's young son, Rochunga, would carry this torch as he committed himself to learning English, Hebrew and Greek in order to translate the entire Bible into his tribe's native language.  Rochunga's faith would be tested many times along his journey, and sometimes he would slip and forget his commission.  But God would remind him through the encouragement of his father and his own witnessing of the carnal nature of man to continue his difficult journey to the mountain top.  This movie is akin to ""Inn of the Sixth Happiness.""  I cannot recommend these two movies highly enough!",1326758400,,1340,4.941964285714286
1904756,5,B0000ACNQH,One of the best inspirational movies ever made!!! I had it on VHS but needed it on DVD as I had played it so often.you wouldnt  be sorry if you bought this!!!,1309737600,,158,3.9375
1904757,5,B0000ACNQH,"But an amazing story of true events that transpired, and how God used one man to take the gospel to a people in their own language.  Not the best production, but the story was inspiring to say the least and reminds you that with God all things are possible.",1290988800,,257,4.244897959183674

1904759,5,B0000ACNQH,"I came so close to missing one of the most inspiring movies I have ever seen! It's slow in the beginning and I got a little bored and confused and almost watched something else instead, but I hung in there and am so glad I did. The acting was excellent. What a beautiful, wonderful, inspiring true story! I can't say enough! I've been telling everyone about it. I can't believe I never heard it before!",1277596800,,402,4.373333333333333
1904760,5,B0000ACNQH,"The movie starts a little slow at first, but by the end I was weeping for joy to know that the Bible is so cherished in so many parts of the world while we here in America take it for granted.  I also thought this was a wonderful film to give to those who have or have had any kind of ministry and wonder if they have made a difference in the lives of others.  I bought another copy right away and sent it to friends.  They were as touched as I was.",1272844800,,449,3.806451612903226
1904761,5,B0000ACNQH,"What can God do if we follow Him?  More than we could ever think or imagine as seen in this great film of faith and devotion to God, his earthly father, and people that desperately needed God's love and provision in their lives.  It goes to show us that where we are isn't necessarily where God wants to leave us.",1268352000,,313,4.2
1904762,5,B0000ACNQH,One of the most unusal and inspiring life stories that I've seen. A must see!,1260057600,,77,4.2

1904764,5,B0000ACNQH,The DVD arrived in good condition. The story is amazing and everyone should see this movie. My sister helped type the translation Rochunga did in the Hmar language for his people in India. This was the first time their language was in written form. He was truly God's man for the Hamar people.,1243641600,,293,4.547169811320755
1904765,5,B0000ACNQH,"I know nothing of who actually produced this video, but it is very well done.  The true story of Rochunga Pudaite (and the Welsh missionary Watkin Roberts) is alone deep and compelling . . . a young man is saved during the Welsh revivals of the early 1900s and travels alone to the highlands of India to evangelize a nation of headhunters with little outside contact . . . . after living among them and seeing several saved he is expelled by the British authorities, never to return . . . the converts evangelize their own people and many churches are planted, all without a Bible or missionary or outside contact.  One of these early church leaders sends his young child (Rochunga) out ""Beyond the Next Mountain"" to learn English with a view to translate the Bible into their language, one which had never been written.  The movie follows the travels of Rochunga from 10 years old through the 2nd World War as a scout/messenger for the British and a triving trade in the black market, to his return to his original purpose, University training in original biblical language so he can begin his linguistic translation work.  There are several unexpected twists and turns . . . deeply moving.

The story is great . . . but the production is also excellent, well crafted . . . creative and unpredictable enough to keep your attention very well.  Telling tales that flip between (supposed) foreign and English speakers is difficult and is well executed.

Highly recommended for all ages.",1215993600,23,1484,4.728682170542636
7996586,5,B0000ACNQH,"Gave this as a gift to a family headed to India to assist local churches. Hope they enjoy it as much as I have. Based on a true story, it's one of the great inspirational Christian films of the last fifty years. Show that the Lord often works to bring forth fruit at times and ways we might not see at first. Encourages Christian workers not to give up hope when results are not immediate or obvious.",1515196800,,400,4.207792207792208
