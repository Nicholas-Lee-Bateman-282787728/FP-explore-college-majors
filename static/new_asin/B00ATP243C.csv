5509741,5,B00ATP243C,"If you've seen one independent horror film, you probably think you've seen them all.  The genre is typically defined by a set of rigid features: wooden acting commensurate with your typical community college theatre production, shaky camerawork and cinematography which barely serves to convey the narrative in only its most rudimentary sense, and a plot with more holes than O.J. Simpson's alibi.

Shadow People, however, is not your typical indie horror flick.  Dallas Roberts (The Walking Dead) does an exceptional job of playing Charlie Crowe, a small-town talk radio host who gets caught up in the mystery of the shadow people after a late-night call from a disturbed listener.  His exploration into the phenomenon makes the film as much mystery or suspense thriller as pure horror and is spliced together with documentary footage.  The resulting mode of storytelling is both effective and novel, making suspension of disbelief (a major problem with most horror films) that much easier and enhancing the overall feel of the film.

The film's camerawork and cinematography in general is reminiscent of a much larger production.  Roberts' emotional range is expertly captured, inviting the audience to share in his brushes with the uncanny.  Outdoor pans manage to give the audience a strong feel for the insular Kentucky setting in only a few seconds here and there.  Lighting in the film's more traditionally ""scary"" scenes is viscerally creepy without being over the top.  The overall effect conjures up several great horror films of the past, with a dash of film noir for good measure.  Sound is equally well done, serving to enhance the ambiance.

Again, Shadow People is not your typical indie horror film.  It is instead a well-crafted exploration of an all too familiar phenomenon (sleep paralysis, shadowy figures caught in the corner of one's eye in the middle of the night) that manages to be both suspenseful and genuinely creepy, and just might just have you dreading the next time you have to sleep alone.  Definitely worth a watch.",1363824000,20,2049,5.114114114114114

When you go on a ride at a theme park they have signs to warn people not to get on if they have a heart condition or are pregnant, etc., so why should a movie be any different?

There NEEDS to be a warning before this film to not watch it if you are OCD or are taking any meds for anxiety. I watched this movie with my wife and she has suffered a complete nervous breakdown from it. We thought we were going to enjoy a scary movie as we normally do, but everything in this film is true, and once you've seen it you can't get it out of your head.",1363824000,2,749,3.9602649006622515

This is a very interesting movie but I wouldn't call it a straight horror movie. The movie is interesting enough to keep you watching and interested but I didn't think it was scary in the classic sense. The only movie I can really compare this to is The Fourth Kind in the way that it mixes ""real"" footage with the movie footage which makes it a little more creepy.

5509747,4,B00ATP243C,"Rarely do I come across anything in my viewing of horror movies that makes me jumpy or paranoid after turning the TV off. Most times I enjoy the film and then go on about my business with no worries. However, every once in a while a true gem of fear comes along and leaves its imprint on me as I shut off all the lights in the house and head to bed. Matthew Arnold's ""Shadow People"" had me searching the walls and windows for ghastly spots of unexplained darkness after watching it.

Participants in an experimental sleep study in the 1970s report seeing strange shadowy figures. They and several hundred other individuals die in their sleep soon after. The phenomenon was given the name SUNDS, which stands for ""Sudden Unexplained Nocturnal Death Syndrome."" Doctors wouldn't talk about the shadows.

In the present, failing radio talk show host Charlie Crowe begins receiving calls from a teenager claiming shadowy intruders are coming for him. At first, Charlie believes the kid is mentally ill. His theory is challenged when the boy dies in his sleep. Things get even weirder when listeners of his talk show and people he tells about the mysterious shadowy figures begin dying in their sleep. Are these clusters of deaths a coincidence or are there sinister nocturnal forces at work?

""Shadow People"" takes the sort of ideas our nightmares are made of and puts them in a visual package. Everything you've ever thought about someone or something watching you in your sleep is brought to life in this creepy little indie film.

Director Matthew Arnold shows great promise through his mastery of timing. He has a knack for setting up what you would expect to be your typical jump scare and somehow delivering it in an off-tempo manner that leaves the viewer surprised and shuddering.

I can't say I completely agree with every choice of filmmaking he used for ""Shadow People."" The movie is presented in the manner of many true crime TV shows are. It's a re-enactment of ""true events"" with the actual people involved giving their commentary along the way. The concept is interesting but gets a bit distracting as the terror unfolds.

Many religious individuals would express their belief that shadow people are demons or evil spirits. Much like in ""The Possession"" or ""The Exorcist,"" the person has brought something into their house that allowed the entity access. I am of that mindset more so than any other concept brought up in this.

If I were to compare ""Shadow People"" to other movies out there just as a way to spark people's interest, ""The Ring"" and ""The Apparition"" immediately come to mind. By no means is this a carbon copy of either of those films. They just came to mind as I sat watching it.

The audio and video transfers for ""Shadow People"" look and sound good. A few of the ghostly scenes created by CGI suffer in a high definition format, but it doesn't ruin the overall viewing experience. The musical jolts used in the movie's score will have the audience pulling their heads out of the ceilings of their living rooms.

The only special feature included on this Blu-ray release is a featurette entitled ""'Shadow People:' More to the Story."" It gives viewers exactly what it claims to: more information about the phenomenon known as ""Sudden Unexplained Nocturnal Death Syndrome"" (SUNDS). It's short, but offers additional data to think about as you lie in bed eyes wide and darting around your room as you attempt to drift off to sleep.

""Shadow People"" is that rare horror movie that leaves a lasting impression on its audience. The fear might wear off over time, but you'll never completely stop thinking about it. We all wake up in the middle of the night gasping for air, feeling like something is sitting on us, or thinking we're being watched.

I feel like this movie could of been good if they added a supernatural plot, creating a story in what is related to true events. the movie was to me a waste of time since I do not scare easily and ive experienced mental health issues where things unreal have become real and what felt like dreams ending up not being dreams. I was hoping the idea behind the movie would spook me but 3 people dying in their sleep randomly and around the same time with no cause of death findable just seems like pieces are missing and things were missed or mistakes covered up.

5509779,5,B00ATP243C,"*The Showtime channel recently presented the extremely spooky Shadow People as part of its rotation. The 2013 film originally titled The Door had the classic elements of a horror movie, but many parts were also done in a documentary style making it chillingly believable.

Shadow People is presented as an explanation for and a dedication to victims of the very real disease, Sudden Unexplained Nocturnal Death Syndrome. This syndrome is mainly seen in Asian locales, including Cambodia and the Philippines. Some folk tales from those regions attribute the mysterious deaths to supernatural forces.

In folklore and among paranormal researchers, Shadow People are unidentified entities that appear as a humanoid form of a black mass or a person-shaped shadow that appears at the corner of ones vision.

The movie begins in Cambodia, 1973. A group of villagers were listening to a town elder or storyteller who was telling his audience about deaths in a nearby village  the victims had reported seeing something that frightened them, and when they went to sleep, they never woke back up. A young boy was hiding nearby, listening. When his mother catches him and brings him home to go to bed, she sees a shadow in his room. The boy died minutes afterwards.

Segue to the meat of the story  late night radio talk show host Charlie Crowe Camfield (Dallas Roberts) wants his show to become syndicated, but his ratings are low. One night, he gets a call from a young man, Jeff Pyatt (Jonathan Bacon), who tells him hes afraid to go to sleep because he sees these Shadow People, and truly believes they will kill him when he does fall asleep. Charlie writes him off as a crackpot. Jeff sends a package to Charlie of proof that these beings exist. Then he calls the show back when Charlies on the air. Charlie still doesnt believe him, and we hear the sound of a gunshot from Jeffs end of the phone line. It sounds for all the world like the boy committed suicide. Turns out, he just shot the wall, and his parents hospitalized him for psychiatric evaluation. Charlie goes to the hospital to meet the young man and find out how hes doing, but finds out Jeff died inexplicably in his sleep after admittance.

Many people, including the authorities, are blaming Charlie saying this whole incident was a publicity stunt to boost his ratings. But that is far from the truth.

Charlie starts doing his own research into these Shadow People, and his phone lines are lit up like a Christmas tree every night while hes on air with listeners offering their own theories. However, there are more deaths among his audience members that are being attributed to the same mysterious malady. This draws the attention of the CDC, who send their representative Sophie Lancombe (Alison Eastwood), who joins Charlie in his investigations into a non-medical cause for the untimely demises.

Like the very best of thrillers throughout time, this storys strength is in the atmosphere. The tension was so thick, you could cut it with a knife! There was a haunting chill throughout. One of the best told cinematic tales Ive experienced in a long time.",1440547200,,3119,4.836772983114447
5509780,3,B00ATP243C,"I think what mostly makes Shadow People average is the messy way it's written.  At first a radio talk show host (played by Dallas Roberts who totally reminds me of David Duchovny's creepy demeanor from the X-Files) gets suspicious calls from a caller late at night, and eventually starts receiving mysterious packages on his doorstep from this caller.  During the next broadcast the caller calls once again, and reports spotting shadow people in his room.  He has a gun, and of course Dallas doesn't want this poor teenager (only 17) to do anything crazy and commit suicide, but later discoveries the kid died under mysterious conditions in his sleep.  Dallas then goes on a quest to the library and around town to figure out the mysterious pertaining to these supposed shadow people claims.

That's all fine and good, but where the movies loses me is soon after when the storytelling changes and combines documentary segments with the movie parts.  This doesn't work for me.  The interviews with the people around town (specifically the kid playing video games) claiming to see shadow people are really quiet and hard to understand, and it feels awkwardly blended the way the movie just stops Dallas' search for clues and focuses on the interviews for a few minutes before shifting back to the main story.  Too much shifting between the two for my liking.

Basically David... er, Dallas initially writes off these supposed shadow sightings as nothing to take seriously and even mocks it on his radio show, until the people he communicates with continue to die under mysterious conditions.  Some of the outside filler could've been trimmed away such as the predictable cliched ""angry ex-wife drops off son and has nothing positive to say about anything"" writing that's really redundant and unnecessary by this point in movie writing and doesn't belong in a film like this.  Of course Dallas playing the deadbeat dad is equally clichd.  Anyway eventually it becomes apparent there's more going on here besides sleep paralysis, which is what I originally suspected.  They also touch upon the subject of frequencies in the air contributing to the problem.

The movie provides some facts, but I'm not sure how much of this stuff are REAL facts or just fictional disguised as facts.  1 out of 5 people experience sleep paralysis.  If this is true, I'm part of the 20%.  Let me tell you, it's NOTHING to write off as no big deal.  Before experiencing it for myself back in 2010, I figured only heavily medicated drug users experienced intense nightmares that were interpreted as shadow people, but experiencing it for myself completely changed *everything*.  The movie even touches upon this subject- you have to see it to believe it.  I too saw what appeared to be a shadow person while I was completely immobilized in bed.  It was only 5 seconds long, the entire incident, but it sure felt *extremely* scary being unable to move and seeing shadowy images to my right.  I can't really explain what I saw, but I prefer to write it off as my eyes playing tricks on me so I don't have to think about demonic stuff.  I wonder if the shadow was actually a similar thing to seeing a dark spot (or floater) but it looked different because I wasn't able to move so I freaked myself out and desperately tried looking for an explanation.  Anyway the movie also teaches us what the true definition of a nightmare is, and how it originated which is fascinating stuff.  The original/true definition of a nightmare really isn't pleasant at all.

The ending, which I won't spoil even though I'm tempted to, is disappointing because it's inconclusive.  Deliberately inconclusive... you'll see what I men when you watch it.  The acting is decent, the search for clues is alright by the few clichd characters involved, but the messiness of the writing by stringing together unnecessary/tacky documentary bits and failing to provide enough frights (and building on those frights) related to the few appearances of shadow images dancing off the walls while people are asleep leaves me to believe most people are experiencing sleep paralysis.  Of course I'm not actually there in the bedroom when this stuff is happening to them, nor am I living inside someone's head, so I have no problem admitting I could be wrong.  Either way I'm not wrong about this movie failing to provide enough excitement to recommend.  It's okay, but I've seen hundreds of scarier movies out there.",1438905600,,4449,4.8763297872340425

From the first scene to the last scene, it just keeps getting creepier and creepier, as the viewer can't help but be completely pulled in to the story.
Everyone can relate to this film. We've all experienced nightmares and I think I can safely say that we've all had our little ""bump in the night"" scares at one time or another.

  Although this movie does have plenty of suspense it doesn't give the same goose bumps the radio show provided as that played with your mind and this is a visible feast for the eyes, there are a few gripes I have with this movie .... one is it's again like a documentary and goes in and out showing the actors portraying the actual people the events happened to go along with the actual people themselves a nice point but ..... and this is the second point every time the people actors and the real people are talking you have a loud and very distracting piano music track that has one strain to hear what is actually being said, I wish producers who shoot these types of movies consider in keeping the darn music down or else leave it out altogether.

5509808,3,B00ATP243C,"I'm a big fan of horror films. The only problem is that it seems like lately they either use lame ideas or rework some past film into a new and improved version. So when an original film comes along I'm always ready to let other know how good it is. SHADOW PEOPLE is one of the good ones.

Charlie Crowe (Dallas Roberts of THE WALKING DEAD) is a late night radio DJ who takes calls from people who discuss weird topics from aliens to hauntings. One of his callers has sent him a package and later calls to tell him he's afraid to sleep for fear of dying, attacked by shadow people he's been seeing. While he at first believes the caller is off his rocker and in need of help, he changes his mind when he learns the same caller dies in his sleep.

Crowe begins digging deeper into the mysteries of shadow people, finding out that they have been studied and the results are not hopeful. He learns that this was not the first person to complain of the shadow people and their intent on killing and that others have died the same way, in their sleep. As he digs deeper he too begins seeing shadow people and one can only hope he finds a way to survive this experience.

The idea of shadow people is nothing new and most recently talked about in nearly every ghost hunting show around. The idea of these shadows as spirits stuck in a certain location is the way those shows describe it but in this film these shadow people are very mobile, moving from one person to another, location to location.

The way the film shows the shadow people uses limited special effects and offers small glimpses rather than full on in your face displays. This adds to the creepy feeling that they invoke. You never feel cheated in not seeing them rather they make the hair on the back of your neck stand on end. The entire film has the ability to make you feel that way offering chills rather than thrills, something lacking in most horror films these days.

If you're looking for a movie that was made on a shoe string budget but that delivers some unique scares then this one is for you. It doesn't get in your face but does get under your skin. What more could you ask for in a horror film?",1388448000,,2170,4.3088235294117645

5509812,5,B00ATP243C,"This movie opens with a disclaimer: The following motion picture is based on an actual case of mysterious deaths and the viral video known as ""Sleep Study GR16 1971.""  We have used footage and interviews with real people whenever possible.

Late night radio host Charlie (Dallas Roberts) is more than a little displeased with his job.  His divorced life is equally dissatisfying as he is serially disrespected by his ex and their son (Mattie Liptak; Quarantine 2: The Terminal).  At an all-time low in his career he gets a call from a frightened teenager who claims to see ghostly shadows at night.  After readily dismissing the teenagers story, he receives a package from the disturbed caller containing documents pertinent to a strange sleep study in which the subjects all reported seeing shadowy creatures as well.  The teen calls again to talk about the study and his fears.  He concludes that ""when you think of them, they come for you.""  During the call the teen describes his fears, reveals he has a gun, fires, and well, things seem to have escalated along with Charlie's ratings.

His producer Tom Dimartino (himself and Christopher Berry) suggests that he visit the caller, who is now in the hospital after shooting the wall, to follow up on the story for the sake of ratings.  Charlie goes to the hospital to meet the boy only to learn that he died in his sleep during that first night of his stay.  Now a bit perturbed, Charlie goes to Camden College (where the sleep study was conducted).  He does some library research and a student librarian assistant (Mariah Bonner) who takes an interest in his show happens to find out what Charlie's researching when she fixes a paper jam in the copier he was using.  She was found dead by her roommate that night.

With this second death, Charlie becomes a believer and makes his radio show all about it.  His radio show is now abuzz with talk of drugs, mental illness and schizophrenia as callers flooded the airways with likely causes of how two healthy young people died in their sleep.  ""Real footage"" of locals' and witnesses' testimonials add flavor.  Over time, the calls shift from attempts to explain the sleeping deaths to callers' accounts of experiencing sleep paralysis and sightings of shadowy figures.  Charlie questions, with so many telling the same story ""Could it all be real?""

Sophie (Alison Eastwood), a CDC researcher rep, meets with Charlie to discuss the recent sleep-related deaths.  Autopsies revealed no pathogens, heavy metals or health history to explain the deaths.  Sudden Unexplained Nocturnal Death Syndrome is the suggested cause.  But Charlie believes in something of a more primordial, sentient cause.  His mission to reveal the truth leads to a national media blitzwill it work?  Can he stop these deaths?

As we stare at the screen waiting to sleuth out the next rogue shadow we are left with a haunting notion: The shadow people know when we think of them and then they come for usso how do you stop thinking about something?

Whereas some of the shadow effects were perfectly executed in my eyes, others were not ideal.  For example, running shadowy figures may make me jump, but that's not the same as eliciting fear.  The shadows that are still and suddenly noticed in the background, or slowly moving, or out of sync with the caster of the shadow...THOSE are the scary effects.  THOSE are chilling.

Overall I was pleased with the jump scares.  Watch this in the dark.  This film is good at building tension as you anticipate seeing something weird in the shadows, much like the intensity of Paranormal Activity (2007).  It's creepy.  You know it's probably about to happen, then it happens, and you're still shaken by it!  The ending, while not some super clever twist, was elegant and simple and I appreciated it.  From start to finish, I was very surprised and pleased with this.  I find none of the typical, in fact expected, flaws of horror: over-exposition, poor character development, stale writing, effects demonstrative of a forced and over-extended budget, frightlessly empty scares, inconsistency in pacing or story and, perhaps worst of all, lame endings indicative of a lack of vision.

This solid film was written and directed by Matthew Arnold, who has done basically nothing else in terms of feature length films or horror.  Like The Day (2011), The Shrine (2010) and The Last Will and Testament of Rosalind Leigh (2012), this film really shocked me.  While not as original as the other three in story or style, Shadow People was without a doubt finely crafted, acted and filmed such that I am excited to see whatever Matthew Arnold does next.",1385164800,2,4657,4.867852604828463

5509819,3,B00ATP243C,"Dallas Roberts plays a radio DJ with a failing program who gains notoriety when a caller accurately predicts his own death over the airwaves. Even more disturbing, the caller attributes the death to ... da-da-duuum! Shadow People!

The movie claims to be based on true events, and I even know people who profess to having seen these people. Given the human brain's propensity to see humanity in everything from clouds to burnt toast, it's not so unusual that people have personified the darkness. And also given how little we know about the world and our place in it, sure, it's also possible that there may be life on other planes of existence that we can only perceive as shadows. Or maybe its pixies. Who knows?

That's really the big flaw of the film. It tries to find spookiness in two things. The first is the plot's real world inspirations (""actual"" footage of people from the story is often shown in tandem with the movie footage). This never really hits home because all you really get from this are various homely looking people saying fairly mundane stuff. Some believe in shadow people. Others don't. The second well that the movie tries to draw fear from is in the actual shadow people themselves. There are a few moments when this is done effectively, but since it's a pretty old horror movie trope -- the malignant darkness moving around -- it gets pretty old pretty fast.

The movie neuters itself the most when it tries to get serious with its own concept. There are a lot of shadow people theories thrown around, but the movie's biggest guess is that maybe we are creating these beings ourselves, basically allowing ourselves to be subsumed by fear. Although the film never really does explain the shadow people and leaves most of the story up to the imagination, this is the theory it keeps returning to over and over again. That lack of a conclusion ends up taking a lot of the wind out of the film's sails, and its insistence that maybe we're doing this to ourselves ends up ripping the sails to pieces, since it basically exposes the conceit behind all scary movies everywhere, turning what should've been a decently spooky flick into an over-thought treatise on what it means to be scared.",1382400000,,2212,4.695876288659794

5509821,4,B00ATP243C,"I love find indie film gems and this is one.  The director uses camera work, light and dark, shadows, facial expressions and open-ended questions with the mastery of a great storyteller.  The film is based on a 1970s experimental sleep study during which the patients (volunteers)reported seeing shadowy figures in reflections and around them. Some of these patients died in their sleep a short after. This phenomenon is called 'Sudden Unexplained Nocturnal Death Syndrome'.

The film begins in a documentary style with many people chiming in about an uploaded video about the experiment gone wrong.  Enter Charlie Crowe (Dallas Roberts), a second-rate late-night radio host who takes a call from a young man who is reporting this phenomena.  The young man sends Crowe an envelop filled with data and photos from the original experiment. A couple of deaths soon convince Crowe and a skeptical CDC investigator (Alison Eastwood) that something is wrong.  As the movie picks up speed, Crowe's son and many others tune into the radio show to listen and report more sightings of the ""Shadow People."" Paranoia soon gives way to facts and Crowe tries to go public and then makes a brave decision.  The movie ends with a shock ending that is somewhat expected but still scary.

It was not poorly made, but slow, too many things like other movies, like the Fourth Kind, and no explanation for what caused the shadow people to appear.

5509842,4,B00ATP243C,"I watched a few scary movies recently while my family was away. Out of the four or so that I watched, this movie is my favorite. It's pretty creepy, the acting is good, and it's not a gore fest. This movie is just a good, creepy, kinda scary movie. Charlie Crowe (Dallas Roberts) is a late night radio talk show host who gets a call from a very frightened kid who says he can't sleep or the shadow People will get him. Charlie thinks at first that this is some hoax or the kid is mental, but when he ends up dead, Charlie starts to do some digging into the myth of the Shadow People (who, I guess are documented-though before watching this film, I'd never heard of them-which actually creeps me out even more). Charlie's radio show begins to skyrocket in popularity when the subject of Shadow People is discussed on his show by callers who want to talk about their own experiences with the scary Shadow People. Charlie uncovers some interesting work done by a sleep doctor may point to the existence of the monsters.

Dallas Roberts does a great job portraying Charlie Crowe and carries most of the movie, though, Allison Eastwood does a good job as a woman working for the CDC who is in Crowe's neck of the woods to check out the mysterious deaths that have been occurring in the area.

If you like scary movies but don't like the blood baths many turn into, you might like this one. It tickles the scary bone without going over board.",1369267200,4,1436,4.415094339622642
5509843,4,B00ATP243C,Now I will start off by saying yes this movie is quite boring and not much happens. It's more about the subject and plot of this movie which is about the shadow people. Something to do with creatures or entities that live in or are shadows and attack people at night when you go to sleep mostly. Not the greatest movie but the subject matter I think is very interesting and thats why I'm rating it a 4 instead of a 3 and the fact that when I watched this it actually scared me a bit. I was by myself in my house watching this in the dark before bed so it was a perfect storm. Normally movies don't scare me at all but something about this one just hit a nerve and I'm still thinking about it a day later and checking the corners at night for some shadows that shouldn't be there. So I guess the movie did it's job fully because I'm still creeped out a bit. Acting not so hot but not terrible and like I said a very very slow movie with minimal shocks. Just the overall atmosphere is a little tense. Worth a rent for sure and a buy if it's cheap enough. Just make sure if you wanna get creeped a little then watch it in the dark by yourself before bed.

5509856,3,B00ATP243C,"Back in the mid 1980's I was with a friend housesitting for my step brother in Honolulu, Hawaii. We had decided to watch Night of the Living Dead one evening but fell asleep mid- way through. We had both fallen asleep on the floor next to each other. There was a powerful storm outside during this time. The front door of this small very old apartment had a spring that would close it automatically, then a latch lock would lock the door when it closed. I was often forgetting and locked my self out several times. There was no way to change this auto lock latch so it wouldn't lock.

While we were sleeping I had a dream that the door busted open from the force of the wind. I saw my self laying next to my friend in the dream. Suddenly a shadow looking human-like figure came in the door and creeped up to my friend and bent down to where he was laying asleep. I saw it as though it was whispering in his ear, leaning over him. At that moment I heard a loud scream and that woke me up. As I woke, I saw a real shadow figure in the dim lighting swoosh quickly toward the hall then vanish around the corner. I then swung my head at my friend who was screaming and truly terrified. He was looking around all over the room and I kept asking what he was looking for.

He said, ""Something attacked me in my sleep, I saw this wierd shadow like being in my sleep"". I got seriously scared and said loudly, ""Oh my god! YOU SAW IT TOO?!!!"" His eyes got very big and he said, ""You saw a shadow being?"" I said ""Yes, I saw it leaning over you in my dream, when I woke to your screaming I saw it fly away around the corner toward my brother's bedroom"". We were both extremely terrified. He said ""Oh my god, I saw that too, but while I was still asleep, I saw it fly around the corner, then I woke"". It was at that moment that we noticed the front door was standing open and the wind was blowing in. We went to the door to discover the spring had broken and the lock was also busted.

We thought maybe a powerful wind had done it, but we noticed the wind had already calmed to a gentle shower by that time. We turned all the lights on and slowly walked to the kitched and grabbed two butcher knives, and began to walk slowly toward the halway, very scared. My step brother's bedroom had a door that opened outward toward the hall. He never shut it and there was always one of those large rowing machines used for excercise standing up against the opened door. This machine weighed about 150 pounds. When we got around the corner into the small hallway of this small one bedroom apartment. We were in a state of shock at what we saw.

The machine was all the way at the other end of the hall standing upright in the opposite corner, and the bedroom door was closed. We finally worked up the courage to open the door and we carefully checked the closet, bathroom that was in there, and there was nothing there. Both the windows in the room were locked shut. We searched the rest of the apartment and found nothing. Within minutes after that we both began to feel very very tired and at the same time we just felt suddenly and oddly uncaring about what had just moments before terrified us to near death. We tried to talk about what we saw in our dreams, and then the next thing I knew it was daylight and we had both fallen asleep not remember anything that happened the night before.

Weeks later we were having dinner out with a few friends, and someone started talking about apparitions, then from across the table we both stared big eyed at each other, and pointing at one another, we both said ""Oh my god, you remmeber? That night!!"" We sat there for hours telling everyone what happened. We couldn't understand that such a terrifying event was striken from our memories until a key subject brought it all back to us.

It was the only time we ever experienced these Shadow People, but it still sends chills down my spine when ever I think about it. Some years later when the Mothman Prophecies came out we thought maybe we had seen the Mothman that night. Only two days ago I learned of this film, and that there was actually Shadow People encounters in the 80's. I had never heard of these Shadow People until two days ago. I have not yet seen this movie, but I can assure you that these entities what ever they truly are real.",1364860800,9,4317,4.239368165249089

5509858,3,B00ATP243C,"This is an interesting film about SUNDS, Sudden Unexplained Death Syndrome. A Baton Rogue (or there about) night time talk show host, Charlie Crow (Dallas Roberts) has a call-in guest who dies from SUNDS having predicted his death on air. He blames the ""Shadow People"" who come for him. Alison Eastwood (Clint's daughter) is called in from the CDC to investigate.

The film incorporates ""actual footage"" of the real host ""Charlie Camfield"" and various news feeds. The people in these ""actual films"" are different than the actors portraying them in order to give the film a sense of realism. I believe they are uncredited actors as the film also includes police interrogation films as well as people/news casters who do not exist in the world of Google.

Dallas Roberts did a good job, but the script was bland. Your villain is ""shadow people"" who only come if you imagine them. This is not a documentary about the syndrome. The scare factor doesn't exist... until you go to sleep. A well done interesting film that goes nowhere.

Actual studies are interesting as it appears people suffer heart fibrillation while sleeping. Younger males are most susceptible with epilepsy, stress (from relocation) and perhaps diet prior to bedtime (carbs) being linked as contributing factors.

5509864,2,B00ATP243C,"Shadow People begins with a promising set-up:  a bizarre phenomenon involving healthy adults who die in their sleep just after encountering shadowy, scary figures.  However, the movie pretty much spins its wheels for the next hour and fifteen minutes.  The main character's decline into obsession is probably the film's greatest asset along with decent acting and some good dialogue.  The creepiness factor is pretty low if you're someone who watches this kind of stuff all the time.  The ending was also predictable if you watch this kind of stuff all the time.  In short, the film never really reaches a fever-pitch and offers an ending that provides very few answers.  Anyway, the movie was just kind of blah.  It's loaded with ideas that were pulled off much better in other films.  I can only really call this one a moderately entertaining time-killer.

What are the odds that those rave reviews came from people who were involved with the movie?  99.99%?  Stealing a gimmick from the awful Milla Jovovich vehicle The Fourth Kind, Shadow People purports to be based on a true story and mixes in footage of the ""actual people"" involved with the incident being dramatized along with the acted footage.  If you're going to rip off an idea you should probably do it from a good movie.  The plot involves people dying in their sleep for no apparent reason.  The movie seems to suggest that there is some sort of Ring-like curse going on where if you believe in the Shadow People then they can kill you.  There's also a scientific experiment, You Tube footage, a prologue in Cambodia and scads of fake talking head documentary footage--in other words pretty much anything the filmmakers could think of to pad out the running time enough to make this garbage a feature.  None of it hangs together in a coherent way and absolutely none of it is scary.  Anyone who writes a review claiming that Shadow People unsettled or terrified them is either lying through their teeth or is ridiculously easy to frighten.

5509866,4,B00ATP243C,"SHADOW PEOPLE is one of those films that claims to be based on true events.  I don't know if this is true or not, but I can definitely see how it could be in this case.  The subject matter is steeped in realism and I would wager we have all experienced something like this at one time or another.  Heck, I had trouble going to sleep last night after watching this one...and that's saying something for a guy that watches horror movies regularly!  Needless to say, this is one film that any horror fan needs to check out soon!

I am stunned that 162 reviewers on IMDB.com have given this film only 4.4 stars out of 10 as of the writing of this review.  I figured this would have garnered at least 6 or 7 stars out of 10.  That's what I would have ranked it as, anyway.  It's that good.

SHADOW PEOPLE is shot very well and combines supposed archival footage with movie-style reenactments of the same events.  Some folks might not like this, but I find it works very well when done correctly.  This film pulls it off with ease.

The acting is also great, with Dallas Roberts headlining the cast as radio host Charlie Crowe.  Horror fans will recognize Roberts from his role on THE WALKING DEAD.  Roberts does a stellar job in this role, and I look forward to seeing him on-screen in the future.

The best aspect of SHADOW PEOPLE is how it scares you:  the shadowy beings that are seen on camera strike a primal chord deep within the viewer's mind.  As a result, a simple movement of shadow (where there should be nothing moving) can send terror surging through your veins.  I love how many times I jumped while watching this one.

SHADOW PEOPLE is a great and fun-filled jaunt into simplistic horror.  This might be a great date movie because it will scare you both.  I recommend giving this one a look for sure.",1363996800,2,1810,4.391566265060241

Even at the beginning when the ""true story"" introduction came out I thought ""here we go one of those stupid Blare Witch knock offs"" (not that I liked Blare Witch). It is not a ""Found Footage film"" it is a movie with real life footage seamlessly inserted throughout the film and this also made it different than most true story films. I also believe this makes the film better because you are getting to see the real people instead of having to wait till the end like many other true event movies and from the beginning it was interesting. As the movie went on, the mix between real footage and the movie footage that was very well done, the film captivated me.  Watching this at home by myself one evening I can't recall another independent film literally at times sending chills throughout my body. I am not a person that is easily scared but I found myself looking around the room even after the movie ended. The film was very well filmed, the script was well done, and the cast was very believable.  All in all this movie is well worth the watch.",1363910400,22,1160,4.466981132075472
