3509103,5,B001CDFY5K,"The main thing I liked about the documentary is that you get to understand what the athletes were going through as all the changes in society was happening around them.  Very simple elegance overall concerning the film, not preachy, but informative all the same.",1286668800,2,262,4.954545454545454
3509104,5,B001CDFY5K,"I got turned on to Dan Klores' work through the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ESPN-Films-30-for-30-Winning-Time-Reggie-Miller-Vs-The-New-York-Knicks/dp/B0039YAKYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ESPN Films 30 for 30: Winning Time: Reggie Miller Vs. The New York Knicks</a>.  Klores is a high-powered NYC PR professional who doubles as a documentary producer of the first order...and as a mad hoops fan.  His '30 for 30' piece oozes basketball credibility.  Indeed, one of the most enjoyable parts of the Miller/NYK production are the interludes with Klores describing - in his rich, authentic Brooklyn patois - his presence at and remembrance of those games.

But it was 'Black Magic' that got Klores invited to the '30 for 30' table.  This 224-minute ESPN Films production first appeared on cable in 2008.  To be clear, 'Black Magic' focuses on role of traditional black colleges in the advancement of African-American opportunity and equality.  Yes, that opportunity is ostensibly about basketball.  But Klores juxtaposes his basketball arc with the civil rights progress of the 50s and 60s.  In that regard, Klores' pioneer is Coach John McLendon, a man that brought credibility and respect to the programs he headed and launched the careers of proteges such as Clarence 'Bighouse' Gaines and Ben Jobe.  McLendon's teachings and dedication to an up-tempo style literally changed the face of the game.  To prove that point, Klores includes some jaw-dropping footage of what basketball looked like before the influence of McLendon and his successors.  Answer: an unrecognizable - almost comical - game.  Thank god for these pioneers.

Of the various protagonists around to tell their tales to the camera, there are three standouts.  First, there is Coach Ben Jobe.  He's the living connection to McLendon.  He's overflowing with authenticity...and with palpable emotion.  His presence is magnetic.  Second, there's Willis Reed.  Has there ever been a more regal and elegant man to grace the hardwood?  He looks spectacular here.  We should all age this well.  Third, there's the unparalleled Earl 'The Pearl' Monroe.  Not only is Monroe - a collegiate star of the highest caliber at Winston Salem - a winning interview subject, he's also Klores' co-producer!  The Pearl's calling card - his indelible, infectious smile - is on full display here.

'Black Magic' is informative and enjoyable.  I heartily recommend it to any basketball fan or anyone with an interest in the civil rights movement.",1282694400,4,2545,5.5942408376963355

3509106,5,B001CDFY5K,This was a fantastic video describing historic black coaches in college basketball. Current coaches would do well to view and have their players view this film.

3509111,5,B001CDFY5K,"My husband & I saw the first part of this film when it aired on TV back in March.  It was the same night the John Adams series began & which we were planning to watch.  We were so sucked into Black Magic, we totally forgot about John Adams.  This is an absolutely amazing, remarkable film, on the same high quality level as a Ken Burns-type documentary.  The stories are unforgettable...incredibly moving and touching.  As a child of the 80s/90s, I learned so much - it's mind-boggling to me that a person would be passed over or banned because of the color of their skin.  I'm a huge NBA fan, and couldn't believe the Detroit Pistons passed up Earl Monroe because he went to a smaller black college!  For basketball fans, the classic NBA footage is out of this world - early film of Earl Monroe, Wilt Chamberlain, Willis Reed, Oscar Robertson & so many more - this is a must own for any basketball fan!! I can't wait to get my copy & can't recommend it enough!",1224892800,16,961,4.365168539325842
3509112,5,B001CDFY5K,"I recently saw this ESPN production via video tape that I received from a friend of mine. This film recounts the history of small, black college basketball. Let me first say that I am a white middle aged conservative from the south and I would say anyone who is a college basketball and/or a history fan would be absolutely thrilled w/ this film. All the familiar names are there, Willis Reed, Earl Monroe, Charles Oakley, etc that fans may know came from these type of schools but the best parts are the names and stories of guys we've never heard of. They are truly uplifting and at times tragic stories. I was raised in Durham, NC and am (I thought) very knowledgeable of area basketball history but had never heard of John McClendon, arguably one of the leading pioneers in the game. The film also examines a lot of the social and political problems of the 40's,50's and beyond in regards to race and discrimination. This is, in a word, wonderful television. I would highly recommend this purchase.",1218931200,10,1002,4.634831460674158

3509174,3,B001CDFY5K,"Charlie Chan in Black Magic, 1944 film

W. Bonner is a psychic medium and holds seances. Mr. Brown arrives for his new job. The seance raises a spirit of a mans wife! Does anyone have a question? They find Bonner dead! They call the police. No gun was found. The police take them all to headquarters for questioning. Charlie Chans daughter is there. Charlie is summoned too. The coroner says the victim was shot but no bullet was in the body! Charlie will take the case. Chan shows some tricks. Birmingham will go back to Bonners home as an inside man. Frances helped Charlie. Nancy Duncan explains why she used a false name. She was investigating the Bonners because of her fathers death. Charlie arrives at the Bonners home to investigate the seance room. He finds trickery in the basement.

Since everyone was holding hands around the table no one there could have fired a gun. Chan tells why people had motives. Mr. Edwards makes magicians supplies. Later Chan finds Miss Duncan - alive. The lights go out, there are shots! Where did that man go? Miss Duncan awakes from her trance. Chan visits Mrs. Bonner. What happened November 5, 1935? Miss Duncan has a message for Charlie. Mrs. Bonner goes to the top of a building. The stain on her coat will be analyzed, it is a drug that allows hypnotism. Charlie goes to an apartment to look around. Someone throws a black cloth over his head! He is strapped to a chair, a voice tells him to relax, then gives him orders to go to the top of a building.

Outside Charlie walks in a trance. Can he be saved in time? Yes. There is a report from Scotland Yard. Charlie will hold a seance. The police search the basement of the Bonner house. Charlie speaks to Vera and Tom Starkey, magicians assistants before vaudeville died. Birmingham stumbles into a hidden door and then goes to the basement. Charlie plays a word association game. Then the lights go out! There is a noise, the lights go on to show a bullet hole in the chair where Charlie was sitting! The message from Scotland Yard has information about a magician and his life. Charlie reveals the murderer and the secret weapon used to kill Mr. Bonner. Take him away, Sergeant. Charlie explains the trick used by the murderer.

The method of murder seems very improbable for physical reasons. The motive was seeking revenge, like in an earlier movie. I guess its hard to be original on a lower budget. Repeating an earlier successful story works when you have an uncritical audience. Birmingham Brown provides the comic relief previously provided by Jimmy Chan. This is a good story but others were better. One explained how a psychic could gain personal information which could be used for blackmail.
This movie was originally titles Meeting at Midnight.",1484956800,,2755,4.674226804123712

It gets better when someone is apparently using a hypnotic drug to have people join the first victim in death.

You profess a numbing fear of anything that smacks of murder, moving shadows in the dark, or spooks from the great beyond, but in spite of that, you need the work.  So when Mr. Chan takes a vacation, you need a job to tide you over, and you find one at the Bonner's. . . .

If you are Mrs. Justine Bonner, you and your husband have been - for years - profitably fleecing your clients who yearn to hear the whispers of their deceased.  You conduct the seance, your husband enters a moaning trance to contact the spirits, and your hidden assistants provide all of the necessary special effects.

Then one fateful night, the seance begins, your husband calls forth the manifestation of Mrs. Edwards, but before Mr. Edwards can ask her a question, a man's disembodied voice interrupts with a strange question, and then, when the lights come up, one of you is found dead ... murdered as if by black magic. . . .

Note: ""Black Magic"" is not based on a story by Earl Derr Biggers; it is an original screenplay by George Callahan.

I give Dan Klores' movie, ""Black Magic"" the grade of  "" F ""  for FAILING to make it accessible to the
hearing-impaired community, the elderly and the low-hearing impaired sports fan or for academic student(s).
Regarding the content, I give the content an A+ grade.

I am very disappointed that this movie is sold as a ""subtitled"" movie because
 ""it is not a closed-captioned movie with subtitles""---false advertisement.
I am very disappointed that I can not show this to my students this Fall semester.
I am a Professor and I was going to show this to my post-secondary students, some of which
are deaf-students.  Now I can not use this video.
Professors should not buy this video to be viewed in the classroom.

The producers did not include the subtitle option.  You discount the
hard of hearing, deaf people and regular people who would benefit reading
the closed-captioned subtitles, because the subtext-subtitles always clarify the spoken words.",1349481600,,1090,5.685185185185185

All young players need to watch this and other videos like this one to appreciate those before them and to truly understand what a gift this game is and the struggles that those before went through to pass along this gift.",1349395200,,345,4.864406779661017
3509288,2,B001CDFY5K,"Sid Toler and Mantan Moreland only saving grace of this pix.  I had seen many years ago.  Seems like some of movie edited out, and for that PRICE.  Lord!  For instance, Chan says, initials on woman's purse tell of ""name"" not same as she gave.  NOwhere does anyone see a purse, not Chan nor Police.  Seems like not real good editing job.  If they record or press this when ordered, they need a NEW master, as this barely acceptable.  Only Toler/Moreland save the day.  Only for my colelction, or would not order at all.

3509289,5,B001CDFY5K,I am a Charlie Chan fan. I see a difference in the acting ability of Mr Toler as compared to his other Chan films.,1313539200,,114,3.7916666666666665
3509290,5,B001CDFY5K,"This movie brings me back to a more quiet time in my childhood.  I enjoy the plots, the use of the scientific method in crime solving, the humor between #1 son (etc.) and Mantan Moreland ( he represents the child in us, being afraid of skeletons, disembodied voices, and so on).  Charlie is a loving father and husband, a champion of that which is right and a defender of the innocent.
You can never have too much of Charlie.
It's great to be able to get the collections at Amazon.com.",1311811200,19,485,4.377777777777778

Shows a lot of early history of black basketball and how it spilled over into the larger colleges and the NBA.
Every black athlete should read this and realize the hardships the pioneers endured so they could have what they have today.",1295913600,4,309,4.7407407407407405
3509292,5,B001CDFY5K,I thought that Black Magic was exceptional. It's sad that so many basketball junkies never heard or saw these great black coaches and basketball players.  I saw a lot of these players at Rucker Park in New York City but there were quite a few great black coaches I have never heard of or seen. Thank you Earl the Pearl for putting your magic touch to a wonderful show. And thank you ESPN for continuing to be the best sports network in the country (maybe the world).  I love your 30 for 30 series too.,1293667200,3,501,4.2631578947368425
