8255905,2,B0014JC8NI,"You read the review title right and I'll reiterate it: Sometimes sex every three minutes isn't a good thing. You may be wondering why and before you make any guesses or assumptions let me explain.

The animation in this anime sucks. I mean it, this is one of the most poorly drawn animes I've ever witnessed. There's some shading, sure and the sex scenes are drawn clearly enough to figure out what's going on, but the characters lack detail, most of the females lack variation in that they all seem to have large cleavage, thin waists and nipples that are hard to identify at first glance. Some of the physics are actually quite feeble as cleavage won't even look real and to boot, this anime like many has moments where the animators just didn't care much about proper anatomy and decided not to draw bodily organs.

That may be one little nitpick, but it doesn't end there. One of the reasons why I as a human being like hentai is because there's a certain fantasy feel to it; it's the kind of thing any amorous male thinks about when on the subject of his own reproductive system or other physiology: 'What would it be like if I had more this and that.' Don't pretend this question has never been asked before and only among perverts, just look at European art involving amorous demons and you can see that this question has been in human minds for a long time. Once we see this fantasy lived out on-screen that we normally don't see in live-action, then it's a unique visual formula.

While I'm not too sure that I speak for everyone on this, I think it's fair to say that full-body mutilation has not been apart of said reproductive organ fantasies and nothing stops the show faster than sex scenes that end with one or multiple partners dying in a technicolor flurry of red and crimson senselessness. Every five minutes. Admittedly this does wear off as the anime progresses and the animation is actually so bad it's easy to tolerate some of the many brainless mutilation scenes that treat human bodies as though they were made of puddy unlike most hardcore anime where they throw this crap in by sacrificing continuity and the audience's intelligence, but the addition is still just as obnoxious and unwanted as it is misogynistic and pointless.

But then again, maybe you don't really care. If you can skip past these scenes then you'll have quite a lot to see, but once again the statement in my title comes back.

Have you ever watched a live action porno and switched over to animated hentai only to find that you invested in a hentai that tries to be a live action porn? Well, that sums up the rest of Mission's sexual activities. Any time a tentacle is not involved, a group of men and women are and sometimes they'll eat up the scenes for a longer time than the tentacle sex. Don't get me wrong, I don't oppose live action pornography or any pornography for that matter (at least when it's trying to be pornography and not a horror movie), but any hentai that dedicates itself to something you could watch people in reality do feels idiotic, especially in this anime where the animated humans are drawn badly.

Now imagine all this happening every three minutes. You'll have a mixture of pain and pleasure in your hands and you'll either need a strong sense of humor or a strong skin to deal with its insipidness.",1212019200,4,3328,4.566164154103853
