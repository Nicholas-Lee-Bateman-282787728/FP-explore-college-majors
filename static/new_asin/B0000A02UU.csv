8095698,3,B0000A02UU,"I purchased Cartoon Marathon, Vol. 1 & 2 from a discount bin, and was pleased to see a number of cartoons I have not seen since I was young. However, the quality isn't all that great (probably because they have not gone through a ""remastering"" process). Also, I found that the block of Popeye cartoons on Volume 1 is identical to the Popeye block of cartoons on Volume 2, though differnet cartoons are listed on the sleeve.

Again, if you don't have to spend more than a couple of bucks for them, they're worth having, if for nothing else the simple nostalgia.",1108944000,,560,4.490196078431373
8095699,2,B0000A02UU,The quality is not as good as it should be. I would say buy the looney Tunes Golden Collection and classic cartoons (B00063QD6G). I am a cartoon fanatic and quality is very important too me. If the color is washed out or the sound is not as clear I can not enjoy the cartoon.,1099958400,,275,4.111111111111111
