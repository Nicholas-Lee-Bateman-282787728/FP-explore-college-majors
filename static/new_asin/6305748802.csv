Buy both tapes!",961200000,3,194,4.909090909090909
1065635,4,6305748802,"This video is like their album: fun. The video contains about 16 minutes of behind the scenes on their show and three episodes of about 20 minutes each. The group has been sent to a Miami hotel to perform by their bad  manager. Along with singing, the 7 must put up with the crusty hotel  manager and his silly sidekick/brother. The 7 get into various situations.  In one, they buy a car that breaks down. Another, a hurricane threatens the  hotel. Together, the 7 get through everything. In each episode S Club  perform at least one song, with their songs playing in the background while  they go about their various adventures. One of the things that I like is  the genuine affection they have for each other. They do okay on the acting,  but then again they are playing themselves. Or rather, cariacatures of  themselves. Rachel is displayed as a mini-Posh Spice all into hair, makeup,  and clothes. Jo is a regular mechanic. Jon is out to save the animals.  All  in all, a fun 105 minutes.",958867200,2,993,4.548022598870056

7893869,4,6305748802,"I really enjoyed the show, but when I bought the VHS of season 1 vol. 1, I was really disappointed to discover that the PILOT episode was not on it. (I had bought it at a store, not on Amazon.com, by the way.) The PILOT episode shows the band starting out at home & then traveling to Miami, FL. The first episode on the VHS tape I bought began with them ALREADY in FL.
I wish that they would re-release this season on DVD COMPLETE WITH THE PILOT EPISODE, PLUS ADD THE REST OF THE SERIES.
None-the-less, the shows are fun & entertaining, & the music is upbeat & makes you want to get up & dance. Some of the adventures are really hilarious; ex: when the band tries to take Howard's pet alligator back to the wild, only to discover him back in his yard when they return back home to the hotel; OR, when they fall asleep around the Bermuda Triangle & have a crazy dream sequence that they went back in time to the 1970's.",1426032000,,918,4.162921348314606
7893870,1,6305748802,I was wanting this video tape for a present but when I recieved it I was disapointed with the recording of it.,1305676800,,110,4.045454545454546
7893871,3,6305748802,"If you are reading this and wondering what the heck a ""S Club 7"" actually is, then you are probably a fan of either Rachel Stevens or Hannah Spearritt looking for things they did early in their careers. Rachel and Hannah appear to be the only members of the cast who have been visible in the industry since the BBC show ended and the group broke up.

I say ""group"" because the premise of the thing is that they are a seven member musical group-imagine ""The A-Teens"" playing the main characters on ""Hangtime"" and you will have a pretty good idea of the concept. Like ""Hangtime"" they placed a premium on diversity although they shot themselves in the foot by turning the black guy into a ""step-and-fetch-it"" caricature who is patronized by the other six members of the group.

The ""Miami 7"" tape opens with the group's first performance at a Florida resort. This becomes unintentionally hilarious when the owner makes them do ""Tie a Yellow Ribbon"" as their first song. Then they rebel and insist on doing their own songs-the producers try to dial up the contrast between the geriatric first number and the youthful zest of their natural style. Amusingly, other than exposing their abs there is almost no difference since the ""S Club 7"" style is just an updated version of ""Tony Orlando and Dawn"".

Although the group actually had some hits, the BBC show just reveals their acting and performing inadequacies. The 1999 ""Miami 7"" episodes on the VHS tape have some historical interest because even a casual observer can see that Rachel and Hannah stand out from from the others talent-wise and charisma-wise.

A word of warning-although the VHS tape I watched was new it would not play smoothly and jammed frequently, the only tape that has ever done this in my player.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1123891200,2,1812,4.685534591194968
7893872,5,6305748802,"This is one of the best shows ever!! All that is missing is that they really need to release the Complete Series of L.A. on VHS and DVD. Now, That would be better than the best!! You should buy this VHS if your a big S Club fan.",1120608000,2,228,3.7708333333333335
7893873,5,6305748802,"I am a huge S Club fan and I love this video. It includes about 40 minutes of behind the scenes footage and interviews, including a tour of Pauls hotel room. Every fan should get this. The episodes are 3 episodes Howards Hotel, The Blue Chevy, and Wind Resistance. The epidoes don't include the first episode that was played on TV though. It also comes with stickers.",1071878400,,367,4.492537313432836

I watch this movie over and over and over again. I'd put it up there with breckfest at tiffinys.  And that Rachel Stevens is just so hot she stops my heart every time I see her. I think the music goes really well with the video also.  If you like groups like slipknot, static X, Coal Chamber, and Head P.E. then you'll love the music in this.  It was cool,,  big truck",1034294400,3,502,4.177083333333333

7893876,5,6305748802,I am 16 years old and S Club 7 is the best series I've ever watched.  This series isn't only for children.  Even if your older you will still get a lot of laughs out of it.  This series is about S Club 7 trying to get started in the music business. They overcome a lot of obstacles throughout this series.  S Club 7's old manager told them that he was sending them to the best Hotel in Miami and it turns out to be the biggest dump.  They work for the worst person named Howard.  He makes them keep up the hotel and he says singing is only for fun.  He is so into himself that he can't even remember any of the S Club names.  5 stars being the best I definetely give it 5 stars.,1025308800,,678,3.86231884057971
7893877,5,6305748802,"S Club7 in Miami is one of the oddest, funniest shows for kids on tv.  My whole family enjoys it.  Its about the band, S Club who are in Miami,  trying to make it big.  However, they get stuck at a cheapo hotel on Miami  Beach, with a very crabby hotel manager.  S Club 7 has to go through all  these different situations (and I mean very different) to make their way to  the top.  I love the performing parts of every show, I think they make the  show what it is.",966297600,9,464,3.9456521739130435
