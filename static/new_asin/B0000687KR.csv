It's confusing to see ""Customers who bought this video also bought:...I Love Lucy Collection 2"" when what you'd be doing is purchasing duplicates.  If you really love Lucy, just buy Collection 2--with the bonus video included, it's a bargain!",1045008000,33,572,4.598039215686274
7964062,5,B0000687KR,"In this decade, every episode of ""I Love Lucy"" will be celebrating its 50th Anniversary.  Every episode is still funny as funny as when they first aired.  The shows are good. The shows are wholesome.  They are healing and warm and will make you feel good.  Buy them on VHS or DVD today.",1041638400,3,286,4.339622641509434
