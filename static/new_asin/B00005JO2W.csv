Even when Mr. Moore left, Billy was still cool and the kids just take me back to my high school days....(if only high school was really THAT cool) :) Please release this dvd soon, we are waiting......",1197936000,6,376,4.094594594594595
1540289,5,B00005JO2W,"Head of the Class was one of the best sit coms ever.

When will it be released on DVD?

There are lots of us out here who will buy it as soon as it comes out.",1174003200,18,158,3.361111111111111
1540290,5,B00005JO2W,"This was a show that I could really relate to, having been just like one of this ""gang"" myself. It was so refreshing to see smart kids and a teacher who could teach them something other than just the facts found in a textbook. This is one series that is WAY past due for a DVD release!",1168992000,4,285,4.017543859649122
1540291,5,B00005JO2W,Please bring Head of the Class out on DVD!  It's one of the best sitcoms EVER!  Pretty please?????,1157068800,7,98,4.388888888888889
1540292,5,B00005JO2W,"why or why is this not on dvd????  i can't understand it!  one of the best comedies on the air.  let's all sing 'feed me, norman', until they do!

1540293,5,B00005JO2W,"I'm amazed at all the forgettable dross the media giants churn out on DVD all while ignoring classic programs such as Head of the Class.  Head of the Class ran for five seasons--more than, say, Welcome Back, Kotter, which has its own DVD release--and remains fondly remembered to this day.  Admittedly, the first three seasons were the best; they started replacing kids after that, for whatever reasons, and after the fourth season, Mr. Moore (played by WKRP alum Howard Hesseman) left.

A DVD set--either the complete series or individual season releases--would be successful and profitable.  The show has a dedicated cult--it was successful enough to run for five seasons, after all--and plenty of people out there would be more than willing to shell out for the purchase.  Please get this out, the sooner the better...and Parker Lewis, too!",1138838400,44,843,5.079710144927536
1540432,4,B00005JO2W,"This was the perfect 'welcome back Kotter' for the 1980's. Mr. Moore is the street smart teacher who successfully taught a bunch of chronic--overachievers. Enrolled in the fictitious 'individualized honors program' (a takeoff on the IEP) this class comes laden with tons of personal issues.

Dr. Samuels (William G. Schilling) should like the prestige which 'honors' students bring into 'his school'. But he's instead always nervous around the students--forgetting that he is 'the authority figure'. And Dennis Blunden (Dan Schider) does not help. He always gets away with teasing this principal, even if he is an honors student. Samuels should know how and when to stand up for himself. A constant gag is how Samuels always seems to cower when the student is around?

Mr. Moore's ongoing task is to get the kids involved in 'other' projects so they don't single-mindedly expend all energy on studies. Or become stressed out from their pursuits. Maria (Leslie Bega) actually once went so far as to ground herself just because she got a 'B'! I never was like that, but I easily could name lots of people who were off screen.

Our streetwise former actor turned teacher gennuinely sees the good in people. He's not caught up in appearances. Unlike Samuels, he realizes that Eric (Brian Robbins) really is an intelligent kid deserving enrollment in the IHP, and is among his biggest cheerleaders. The relationship between Eric and Simone was among the best series storylines.

So on the surface, it's less of a promotion of the 'honors kid' prototype of our generation---and more of a parody. It was only so-so back in the day. But looking back, it's now hilarious because the scripts accurately got down prototypes of friends and me exactly.",1354147200,,1739,5.006920415224913
1540433,5,B00005JO2W,"This is a classic show that I loved growing up.  Who can forget Arvid and his pocket protector?  What about the youngest student in the class, Janice?  Every student was unique and perfect for the class!  Remember when they did the video with that song... My future's so bright that I have to wear shades or whatever LOL.",1314403200,,321,4.482758620689655
1540434,4,B00005JO2W,"Why in the world has this show not been given a DVD release?  Lots of shows that no one remembers and didn't last past a few episodes have been released, but this one has not.  Does not make sense.",1310688000,,197,4.0256410256410255
1540435,4,B00005JO2W,"This really needs  be on DVD, why is such bad one sreleased, and the well written ones never on Dvd.  It cannot be that expensive to release.  And obviously the market is out there foor them.  PLease release Head of the Class on Dvd soon....",1302998400,,241,4.288888888888889
1540436,5,B00005JO2W,"Head of the Class (1986) was one of my most favorite shows of the 80's. Why is it not on DVD? It also has, unbelievably never been released on VHS! What is the hangup? Musical rights? AOL has free episodes for viewing via the web, but I would much rather pay for a set and play them on my much more reliable DVD player. Heck, the show was so great I don't really need any DVD extras. Warner Bros. should at least come out with season one before everyone is too old to care or the whole cast has died off. Interviews with the cast might be nice. I cannot find any valid reason why this ""classic"" is ignored on DVD, but not by the fans. 5 thousand stars for Warner if they release this series soon! Hope they see this review!!!",1244851200,3,725,4.112676056338028
1540437,5,B00005JO2W,Please release this already!  What is the hold up?  I would buy all 5 seasons.  Classic show!,1238803200,,93,4.352941176470588
1540438,5,B00005JO2W,"I loooooved Head of the Class and I also can not believe that with all the shows that have been released on DVD, this one is not out yet. Also can I get the rest of the seasons of Fame?",1235260800,,185,3.65
1540439,5,B00005JO2W,"I loved this show growing up.  Why is it not yet on DVD?  How is it that ""Perfect Strangers"" is already out but not ""Head of the Class""?  The universe is a cruel place.",1215388800,2,168,3.8823529411764706
1540440,5,B00005JO2W,i can't believe this isn't on DVD yet. seriously? i need head of the class back in my life. (and robin givens too) bring back mr moore and the gang!!!,1205020800,,150,4.033333333333333
1540441,5,B00005JO2W,"Obviously this is a plea for the DVD release and not a review of the product since it does not yet exist....

Plain and simple, release HEAD OF THE CLASS!!!!
Great eighties sitcom revolving around an honors class for phenoms. Great characters, good acting, strong direction...what else? Oh yeah, awesome intro music.

My God! They put out Growing Pains and The Facts Of Life already!!! Get this done before I'm dead, please.

And if all the other studios are reading this, please release Parker Lewis Can't Lose and the rest of Mamas Family! Damn!",1203811200,7,547,4.797872340425532
7941065,5,B00005JO2W,"UPDATE:  THIS SERIES IS COMING TO ANTENNA TV STARTING IN JANUARY 2018!!  Hope it will be well received there.

Like several of the other reviewers, why has this not been released?

I remember Head of the Class in the mid-to-late 1980s, and it was a positive show.  Some of the other sitcoms today are terrible, so why has this been overlooked?

It really has not been given a fair shake in syndication either.  Some independent stations carried it in the 1990's, and I am really surprised that a network like FamilyNet, MeTv, AntennaTV, CoziTV, or TVLand has not carried it to my knowledge.  I know it could find an audience, and I think millenials would enjoy it, and today's teenagers (with the exception that the teens are not on Facebook and sending texts) should be able to relate.

It would be great if a studio, a distributor, or a network  could either pick up the re-runs for syndication or make a DVD release.",1486857600,,919,4.58282208588957
7941066,4,B00005JO2W,"I, too, have been waiting for this to be released on DVD.  I have seen, however, that the show is coming to the Antenna TV network soon.",1476489600,2,136,4.037037037037037
7941067,5,B00005JO2W,"I'll add my voice, I would buy this set AND encourage my nieces to watch it as well.  I still remember the shows where they performed Little Shop of Horrors, and Arvid was a much better Seymour than the cast of Glee.  I can't believe you're going to make me dig through some VHS tapes I haven't looked at in 25 years to find the 3 minute clip on a 2 hour tape where I copied in the performance of Suddenly Seymour.  I can find the Hair performance online, but only a small brief clip of Suddenly.

Please, give us a break and release this show.  The issues that faced these kids still face kids today, and parents who remember the show can help their kids work through the problems and embrace nostalgia at the same time.",1432944000,,721,4.233576642335766
7941068,5,B00005JO2W,"If and when this awesome show ever becomes available, it will deserve 5 stars by default.  Mr. Moore, Dennis Blunden, Arvid Ingen (sp?), Jawarhalol, Simone, Eric, and the brilliant Billy Connolly and more, all add up to what was one of the most enjoyable shows ever made.  Educational, thought provoking, entertaining, and just downright loveable, Head of the Class is an absolute masterpiece that should and must be made available for home viewing.  Whatever is holding up this show being brought to (wishful thinking now) blu-ray and home streaming via internet must be resolved!!!  We want our Fillmore High primetime nostalgia and not just the classics such as the episode where they perform Hair, or when we were all blessed by Jonathan Ke Quan's role as Jasper showing us how to truly own a debate match, or when we all learned the truth about Run Kunkel's illiteracy that was arguably obvious;  WE NEED ALL OF THESE EPISODES like Mr. Moore needed to be reminded by Eric that he indeed didn't know who the lead singer of Guns 'n Roses was at the time that beloved show was blessing the boobtube.  Whoever or whatever has been keeping this show from being released for home viewing will be totally forgiven once this show is available; as Alan said about the USSR in class, we will all say once this show is available:  ""They're exactly our friend now.""  Shout out to Viki, Aristotle, and T.J. also.  Head of the Class for the win!!  Can't wait to buy as many copies as I can to share with all of my television loving friends.  Alex singing ""Manchester, England"" during the Hair episode...television has never been as good!!!",1425859200,3,1630,4.74468085106383
7941069,5,B00005JO2W,"2014 and still no release for this highly successful TV show. It's been almost 30 years since it first appeared on the air. No VHS and now no DVD/digital release in sight. 80's nostalgia is hot right now. Get on the ball, people, before it's too late. This was a fantastic show with a fantastic cast.",1399766400,5,300,4.375
7941070,5,B00005JO2W,"It ir ridiculous that we are STILL waiting for this show to be released.  Give all the actors a few cents off each set sale and get it done.  There's no reason to hold this up.  Too many people like the show, and would be willing to pay for it.  At least release it to Hulu or another pay service so we can watch them online.  RETARDED way to run a business...",1377129600,7,360,3.9444444444444446
7941071,5,B00005JO2W,"I'm absolutely amazed this this quality, classic sitcom is still not released on DVD.  Why?  With so many other shows being released in the last few years, how has this one still not been included?  Who do we need to contact/campaign to to get this happening?  HOTC still holds up today, the fashion may be dated but the show itself is timeless.  Please release it soon!",1372032000,5,370,4.545454545454546
7941072,5,B00005JO2W,I remember watching Head of the Class when I was a kid back in the 80's. I really like the show but I am baffled as to why it has not been released on DVD yet? I would buy it if it were available and I am sure many others would as well. I am wondering if this is an ABC thing. I say that because another ABC sitcom Step by Step has also been not released on DVD yet. Anyways its a really great show that deserves the light of day. Interestingly neither show is in syndication that I know of.,1365552000,2,491,3.823529411764706
7941073,5,B00005JO2W,"Please, please, please help me relive my childhood by releasing my favorite show of the 1980's, Head of the Class. I cant even find it on re runs anywhere and am desperate to see this show again. I am so desperate id be willing to pay 100 bucks a season if i had too! They put out all these other crappy shows but not the best of them all? Need to get my Dennis and Eric fix. Someone tell me who owns the rights to this so i can write them a letter a week for life until its released. Heck, it worked for Andy in Shawshank Redemption, so maybe it might work for me. I want this show out on DVD....NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1360368000,,616,4.057377049180328
7941074,5,B00005JO2W,"I would absolutely LOVE if they'd release this on dvd! I loved this show when I was a kid. Anytime it was on, I'd watch it! It's such a great show and I'd love to watch it again!",1356480000,2,178,3.710526315789474
