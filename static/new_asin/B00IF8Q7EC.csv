6262508,5,B00IF8Q7EC,I thought this was a great film on the subject. Need more like this. Great for motivation also. I would have liked to see more Jay and Ronnie.,1396828800,2,142,4.107142857142857
6262509,5,B00IF8Q7EC,This is a must buy for anyone who is interested in fitness/bodybuilding or anything in that area you should buy this,1396828800,,116,4.571428571428571
6262510,5,B00IF8Q7EC,"Excellent documentary,  it's hard to find anything decent about bodybuilding,  but this has all the top guys in one film.  Watched it 3 times since it's release on the 4th!",1396828800,2,172,4.666666666666667
6262511,4,B00IF8Q7EC,"The movie has the feel of the original Pumping Iron somewhat, taking you a little further into the lives of the bodybuilders, showing them at home, with families, etc. Not all the bodybuilders had the feel though. Some of them are just too arrogant and cocky to enjoy listening too, while others like Kai Greene have a touch of the old school more humble attitude that not only endears them to the viewer but sets them apart from the others. I was very disappointed however that they didn't delve more into supplements and steroid usage, as obviously it plays a huge role, but all in all the movie kept me focused on it for the full two hours up until the title competition which really was well filmed in such a way as to put you on the edge of your seat (assuming you didn't already know the outcome which I did not going in). I wished it had been a little longer and focused more on training, steroids and supplements and their role in the title but overall the movie outshines some of these documentary's on bodybuilding and was well worth the 14 bucks to buy. Its a re-watcher.

By the way, be sure to watch the closing credits all the way to the end. The scene of Mike Katz still looking for his T-shirt (that Ken Waller hid from him at the South Africa Mr Universe in the original Pumping Iron) is a priceless moment of memorabilia for us old schoolers out there.",1396742400,33,1370,4.372549019607843

6262520,2,B00IF8Q7EC,It was just disappointing. In pumping Iron Arnold was the hero. I felt there should have been more of a hero to this. I realize that was not the aim of the filmmakers but I felt the movie should be motivating to the bodybuilding industry and their fans.

6262546,5,B00IF8Q7EC,"I just saw my first body building/physique show in my hometown of Phoenix, AZ and I was inspired to watch this movie.  This documentary is excellent!  I loved the way the movie humanized the competitors, especially Kai Greene.  If you're into body building, or strength training or just enjoy watching Greek gods on stage, this movie is as entertaining and educational as it gets when it comes to the world of competitive body building.",1432425600,,436,4.864864864864865
6262547,4,B00IF8Q7EC,As other reviewers have said not quite as good Pumping Iron. Schwarzenegger mentions the competitors lack  symmetry that had in his day. The mind games the guys play on one another are intense and nasty. It did not seem fake. Wish they had a bit more of Ronnie  Coleman and Jay Cutler.,1432339200,,285,4.461538461538462

The body builders are amazing. Their dedication and hard work really shows. I just think the film itself was a little drawn out and never really got me super excited about anything. It was kind of flat and never reached a high point.",1426118400,,357,4.173913043478261

6262601,5,B00IF8Q7EC,I'm a bodybuilding fan through and through. I've seenjoyed pumping iron at least 7 or 8 times . This is totally different but exactly the same. It's 38 years later so the physique is totally different and the character of each man but the same basic premiss ad the 1st. Man vs iron vs man. Good movie,1417651200,,300,4.280701754385965
6262602,2,B00IF8Q7EC,"Not that great. Somehow I expected more. I thought it would show more competitors, and what they had to say about competing in this sport, but it didn't.

A very small group of guys (and gals, this film covers mostly males) are actual pro BBs and run in the BB competitions (Olympia is #1!). The filmmaker covers Kai Green, Branch Warren, (the one to beat) Jay Cutler and others. Fascinating. An extremely entertaining docu that I find is BETTER than Pumping Iron. Here we see how the guys live (ummmm.. Branch lives VERY well) and show their families. My god, these guys are hardworking athletes who are BOKU with passion for the sport!!

6262743,4,B00IF8Q7EC,"A must watch for bodybuilders and couch potatoes alike.
Although often referred to as ""meatheads"" (think of the Planet Fitness commercials) this movies makes it clear that these men are real professionals with the kind of will power almost no one has.  They know their bodies.  How to use them and what to put into them.  Most people can't even stay out of McDonald's let alone each nothing but chicken, tuna and rice for 20 years.  Then when you think about the time in the gym; I've heard people crying about using 5lb dumbells.
Like ""Pumping Iron"" I'm sure a lot of the editing portrayed them as the ""Golden Boy - Heath,"" ""The Underdog-Greene,"" etc.  Their true personalities may or may not be so extreme, but as long as they are good to their families and fans, who cares.  It's a competition, not a love fest.
The previous Mr. Olympia always has an advantage and is usually a sure thing, but Heath DID look better on the second day.  Greene wasn't wet enough and his chest was flat.  He did something wrong right before he went out.
Also, if you ever wondered what ""b*#$ch tits"" looked like, Kai Greene had them (not bringing him down, just pointing it out as he still is an absolute monster).",1407628800,,1198,4.513888888888889

6262756,2,B00IF8Q7EC,"For bodybuilding fans who already follow the sport, this will not be very enjoyable, or anything new. The film felt like a bunch of disconnected interviews with no real overarching plot. For somebody wanting to learn about bodybuilding I'm not sure this accomplished that either. Not sure why they chose to follow the people they did (i.e Dennis Wolf and Hidetada Yamagishi, etc). This film overall lacked the detail it needed and there was no flow.
*possible spoilers*

*Not enough Phil Heath. This film needed him to be the personality and character of it (like Arnold in Pumping Iron), but they didn't show him enough to be that. When they did, he was great, but not enough. The others they filmed were far too bland to stand out in this. The Dennis Wolf casting scene was downright painful to watch.

*Kai Greene's ""oh poor me"" attitude got old, fast. Kept repeating the same thing.

*Too much Victor Martinez. Especially for a guy that didn't even make the Olympia that year.

*No Dexter Jackson or Shawn Rhoden. Disappointing",1405987200,,1031,4.807909604519774

Generation iron is a great ""sequel"" to pumping iron explaining how the sport if bodybuilding has changed.  I've seen some reviews about the competitors not going into detail about steroid use, well why would they do that? They get money for sponsorship for ""using"" their products so if they come out and admit to using steroids then people wouldn't think these products work. Do you see LeBron wearing reebok or ADIDAS? Probably not because NIKE wouldn't like that. Sorry for rambling but I hate people who throw out steroids as soon as bodybuilding is mentioned.",1403827200,6,725,4.8861788617886175

I know we watch these movies for the spectacle, but I also think there is a high likelyhood that the people watching this movie are likely gym-goers themselves and wouldn't mind some interesting information tidbits from these pros... and there is none of that.

The additional footage of Dennis Wolf was really interesting as I didn't know much about him.  Kai Greene is well Kai in this.  Kai comes off as articulate as usual and really is the true ambassador for the sport.  Wish they would've mentioned more of his paintings but that's a minor detail.

Dang, I'm old.  Anyways, this movie doesn't motivate the same way.  It's kind of a circus side show feeling.  Not judging, because folks have the right to do whatever they want to their own bodies (unless your a pregnant woman in Kansas, but that's another story), but what I see on those stages is pretty freakish and I can't help but wonder what these dudes will look like when they're 75 and not consuming 8,000 calories a day.

6262831,2,B00IF8Q7EC,"I began liking men's bodybuilding after ""Pumping Iron"" the classic film about the Mr Olympia competition starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. I appreciate seeing what the human body is capable of in developing its muscle mass. These Men aren't 'freaks' as some like to call them. They represent a sport at its 'extreme' level much like some people don't just run 26.2 miles (a marathon)--they run 100 mile races. Schwarzenegger's personality in PI brought acceptance & interest in BB to a mainstream audience like never before. Unfortunately, this film might undo that completely. Its a documentary following 5 main competitors training for the 2012 Mr. Olympia. In addition to their training you get to see the 'stars' in their home lives as well as a peek at their personalities behind the muscle mass. You don't need to know anything about the sport of bodybuilding or the Mr. Olympia to follow what's going on, Bodybuilding is essentially a 'beauty contest' for Men and unlike say Miss America they do NOT sing, dance, or answer questions about world peace as part of the competition; its posing in swimsuits and nothing more. And so finding out 'more' about the competitors is not always a good thing it turns out. Phil Heath, the reigning champ comes across as insecure & self absorbed. That's not a knock on him, he's just not very interesting to watch when he isn't on stage. Branch Warren comes across as a thick headed, angry guy you wouldn't want to know much less be married too (he's shown with his Wife & little baby at home in a few scenes). Kai Williams had a horrendous upbringing & overcame it to be worthy of an Olympian title, but he comes off as angry and totally narcissistic--not a guy you'd want to know at all. Only Dennis Wolf from Germany comes across as a funny, friendly, happy, family guy you'd want to talk to at the gym. The film was so slow and most of the 'characters' unappealing, I almost turned it off because I was bored watching it.",1401840000,,1966,4.701449275362319
6262832,5,B00IF8Q7EC,A very good Bodybuilding documentary. The most important topic was the use of steroids and why they are used. A must buy.,1401840000,,121,4.545454545454546
6262843,5,B00IF8Q7EC,"Generation Iron follows a group of professional bodybuilders from pro-qualifier competitions to the 2012 Mr. Olympia.  Some make that journey rather stress free, others find it more tolling.  The presentation of these men is appropriately down to Earth and humanizing.  You forget that they are in the top 0.0001% in their sport and appreciate them for their flaws and struggles in the microcosm of this single competition in their career.  When we see them fail, we understand the realities and that there can only be one winner.  But when they triumph, we get lost in the moment and feel happy for them.  By the end (when they named the 2012 Mr. Olympia) I was at the edge of my seateven though I already knew who won!  LOL

Mickey Rourke's soulful and wizened narration breathes life into this work and allows the audience, who may have once viewed these athletes as steroid-abusing sideshow spectacles, to understand the level of determination and struggle of these men.

Pumping Iron (1977) introduced the world to bodybuilding which, at the time of its release, was just as unknown and fantastic to the general public as Harry Potter's wizarding world and Hogwarts.  In need of a protagonist, they depicted the arrogant veteran and current champion Arnold Schwarzenegger as the hero while essentially vilifying the kind-hearted newcomer Lou Ferrignou.  Here, we find Phil Heath filling the role of the arrogant champion and Kai Greene as his humble opponent.  The dynamic, however, is rather different since Kai Greene is a veteran who never won a Sandow (the trophy) and Heath is a young champion.  So it comes with little surprise that Heath finds comfort in his arrogance.  He expects to win whereas Kai Greene expects only to bring his best.  That said, there is no clear protagonist in this story.  In a way, that may be the documentary's greatest fault.  But I still thought it was great!

All of the competitors presented have found their way to the Olympia in different ways.  Branch Warren thrives on his instinct and almost reckless work ethic whereas Ben Paluski relies on science to track his progress and hone his training program.  Kai Greene protests that his devoted training will earn him Mr. Olympia, but Phil Heath suggests that his natural talent provides a powerful edge.  We get a taste of many bodybuilder philosophies, but we delve very shallowly into supplements, training programs or steroids.  Although, they do make some strong statements about steroid use in general with respect to competitive professional sports and bodybuilding, especially the fact that steroids don't make their jobs at all ""easy.""  Their development is wrought with pain and sacrifice.

These powerful athletes, often considered dumb meathead hunks of chemically-developed muscle, reveal their vulnerabilities and what they can and cannot control.  For some, their career is everything, for others it's just a chapter in their life, and bodybuilding saved Kai Greene from a youth of delinquency and a likely troubled adulthood.

This is a fun ride for any fan of the sport.  You'll see the likes of Lou Ferrigno, Michael Jai White, Busta Rhymes, Phil Heath, Kai Greene, Dennis Wolf, Jay Cutler, Ronnie Coleman, Ben Pakulski, Roelly Winklaar, Bob Cicherillo, Branch Warren, Hidetada Yamagishi, Sibil Peeters, Victor Martinez, Dennis James and Jim Stoppani.  Stick around to the end of the credits for a Mike Katz cameo paying homage to when he was pranked by Ken Waller in Pumping Iron almost 40 years ago.

As a weightlifter myself, I found this film inspirational and I'd beg anyone with waning dedication, discipline or interest to give this a watch.  You'll be re-invigorated!",1401494400,,3687,5.066334991708126

as a movie goes it was looooong...  loved the tough guy talking smack and then riding off on his horse only to get bucked off... best laugh Ive had in a long time.. nothing funnier than an ""alpha male"" getting what he has coming.  it is a pretty good look at what modern competition is like... if you are a fan of the sport I am sure you will love it..

What a moving, thoughtful look at the lives of men who are either championed or vilified/ridiculed - there is simply no in between in how bodybuilders are perceived. They became so human...so vulnerable and real, I couldn't help but appreciate the level of effort and sacrifices made to manipulate their bodies to this level of perfection and mass. I'm not a bodybuilder myself (I do love lifting, though), but I think even non-fitness types will appreciate the documentary and the stories of these men.

I'm no fan of any particular bodybuilder but I don't like when grown men run their mouths about other grown men. They barely showed anyone hitting the weights.,1400457600,,379,4.428571428571429

Honestly there are three big problems with generation iron as I see it. 1. The story is over extended. Instead of focusing on 30-4 characters the involve 7-8 most of whom don't even make the top 10! 2. It drags on forever, this movie would have been great if it ended 20mins sooner. And lastly 3. Its oddly familiar.  If you've ever watched a day in the life of any bodybuilder on YouTube or anywhere else on the internet you'll feel like you've seen this before and that makes it kinda boring to me.

Bottom line if you enjoy bodybuilding then this movie is a great addition to your collection however if you're looking to relive the pumping iron days I suggest buying that movie instead",1400112000,3,947,4.431034482758621

One of the great lines was from the medico who stated, ""Gaining muscle while losing fat is counterintuitive,"" or some such thing.  Hey doc, tell the beefy guys to lay off of all steroids, and whatever else they are injecting, and let's see the results about fat loss and muscle gain at the same time.  It really isn't the supplements true believers, it's the roids.  Oh and the backbreaking spine torturing lifting of heavy weights that will make your chiropractor a wealthy man in the future.  O for the days of guys like Steve Reeves and Frank Zane.

My wife and Son who aren't intersted in lifting actaully walked by while I was watching the movie and got hooked on the stories each had to tell and the struggles they had to endure to try and just make it to the Mr. Olympia contest.

These modern-day bodybuilders, on the other hand, lacked any of these qualities and in some cases, their arrogance (especially Heath) was very off-putting.

In this movie, professional bodybuilders come off looking dull, anti-social, uneducated, inarticulate, awkward, and self-centered (which is largely the case). The movie doesn't really do much to advertise bodybuilding in a positive light, but again it does a good job of being honest and accurate.",1398124800,,624,5.313131313131313

I think it gives realistic insight into the world of bodybuilding including the ups and the downs, and most importantly the dedication and hard work it takes.  If I had any complaint, they could have featured some more of the top bodybuilders.  I know they chose a handful of guys to follow, but there were some really prominent guys left out, like Dexter Jackson for example.  And what happened to Jay Cutler lol???

Maybe I am comparing it to Pumping Iron and that is not fair but a documentary should take us INTO the life of the competitor(s). This doc had quick flashes of them eating, training and posing, like a giant commercial. You did  not get a sense that you were there with the competitors in their everyday life.

6262987,1,B00IF8Q7EC,"As a fan of the sport of bodybuilding, I was very let down with this film and the direction it took. The film is narrated by Mickey Rourke, who is a great actor, but as a narrator has a mumbled voice which was difficult to hear and understand without annunciation of words.
The bodybuilders portrayed in the movie are shown in kind of a depressing light, highlighting more of the struggles and let downs of the sport.  Also, there was portrayal of trash talking between the athletes that made the sport and the athletes look bad.
I believe that since so very few films of bodybuilding and the professional athletes are made, that it should have focused more on inspiring and educating people who do not understand bodybuilding as well as showcasing the great athleticism and dedication the athletes have.
I remember watching Pumping Iron for the first time and feeling so motivated to work harder and improve my physique and teach my friends and families how positive bodybuilding is.  If I were to show this film to someone who was unfamiliar, I think they would think less of bodybuilding and the pros who compete in it.  I wish this film could be erased and redone in an inspirational and great way.
