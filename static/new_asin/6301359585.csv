7811127,5,6301359585,"The third volume in the Macron 1 VHS tapes.  Its not as good as the first 2, but its still a must have.  The episodes on the tape are as follows.

Episode 11: Picking up where the last episode left off, GRIP resolves itself to obtain the meteor fragment that powers Macron Base.  As they plan to infiltrate it, Nathan develops a crush on Cathy.  This isn't the best episode, but its still pretty good, all things considering.

Episode 12: The team tours France, & Cathy meets an old flame of hers.  This is a great episode, marred only by some poor editing on Sabans part in one scene.

Episode 13: Scott infiltrates the mob in order to find out about a deal Dark Star is making with them.  This episode is pure excellence.

Episode 14: While in the Andes Mountains, ND-2 feels neglected by Nathan, so he runs away, into a trap by GRIP of course.  This is the worst episode of Macron 1 I have ever seen.  The Macstar 1 fight is good, but it does not make up for a poorly written plot, with Nathan at his most annoying & other dumb moments (like terrible singing from him & Jason).

Episode 15: In Egypt, Cathy is asked by the director of a movie to stand-in for an actress in the film.  But hes secretly working for Dark Star, so naturally she falls into a trap that Jason & Scott have to get her out of.  This is an excellent episode, and more than makes up for the last one, simply for Macstar 1s fight with the Golden Sphinx alone.

Overall its a good collection of episodes, just not the best.  But as long as you fast forward through episode 14, its a great watch.  WARNING: Like the other tapes there are 2 versions: The hour long one which only contains episodes 11 & 13, and the 2 hour version which contains them all.  Make sure you're ordering the longer one.  On a side note, this seems to be the only macron 1 tape that has 2 editions to buy on Amazon.  If you look at the cover art that has been posted, you can see the difference in the exclamation declaring the running time.  The one this review is for says 2 hours & when I contacted the seller they said it really was that long.  But still, I recommend making sure before you make any purchases.  Why did Celebrity Home Entertainment release products like this?!  Didnt they know how frustrating it would be to collectors in the future?  Forget what I just wrote, I should just shut up & be glad that they released as many episodes of this awesome series as they did.",1359158400,,2435,4.262008733624454
