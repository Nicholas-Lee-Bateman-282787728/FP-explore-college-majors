8479756,2,B005MTHRHI,"Most of this story was great I was enjoying it very much. I loved the art and the illustration of cause and effect. Then the end came and ruined the whole story.

The animals all shouted punish mosquito as if it was the mosquito's fault that the owlet was killed. And to this day we punish all the mosquito's ancestors with the death penalty. It should be called why we kill mosquito's instead of sugarcoating it.

This story that could have been a tale about being responsible, communicating well, and forgiveness rather than being about overreacting, spreading rumors, holding a grudge, being prejudice, being rude, and being vengeful. The the monkey climbed a tree to escape danger without finding out what kind of danger he was escaping, if it were a rampaging elephant or a fire, climbing a tree would have been a bad choice. The monkey killed an owlet and snuck away.  When called forward the monkey claims it wasn't his fault the owlet was dead and for some bizarre reason the lion accepts his illogical rationalization for his irresponsible actions.  The crow could have asked rabbit what the emergency was before scaring the whole jungle.  The python didn't need to jump to conclusions. And the Iguana's reaction to the mosquito was strange and rude.",1363996800,,1259,4.810185185185185
