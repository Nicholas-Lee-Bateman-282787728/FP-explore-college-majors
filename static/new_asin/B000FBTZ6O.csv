8198874,2,B000FBTZ6O,"Stick to ""Strength, Conditioning, and Injury Prevention for Hockey"" by Joseph Horrigan. Far better information that's hockey specific and is laid out in an easy-to-follow format.",1224460800,,178,5.884615384615385
8198875,1,B000FBTZ6O,"If you're a goalie and want to strengthen yourself for the game, don't bother purchasing this product. Just get in the weight-room and do exercises for toning your muscles (low weight, high repetition). Although, weight training is not necessary for goaltending in any expert opinion. This DVD is not put together by anyone who'd really know much about the game, and philosophy of a goaltender.",1223769600,,394,5.076923076923077
8198876,4,B000FBTZ6O,This DVD gives alot of great work outs and off-ice training ideas that i could not find anywhere else.  However I wasn't sure what benifits the exercises. How are these exercises going help between the pipes? But all in all its a good DVD for those looking for a of-ice training program.,1199664000,,287,4.519230769230769
