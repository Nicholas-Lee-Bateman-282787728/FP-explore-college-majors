7537669,5,B017Y394CA,"It was a story that transfixed much of the world.  For sixty-nine days in the summer and autumn of 2010, thirty-three mineworkers were trapped almost half a mile beneath the Atacama Desert in southern Chile inside an unstable mountain gold mine.  During what appeared to be a routine mining operation some two thousand feet below the desert surface on August 5, 2010, the mountain started shifting very violently, trapping these workers in a shelter, blocked by a mass of rock twice the size of New Yorks Empire State Building.  With three days worth of rations, the miners managed to survive an extra two weeks before massive drills managed to reach them with additional supplies.  But during that time, it was necessary to engage in a very careful rescue operation that took an additional seven and a half weeks; and it involved a great deal of risk, notably the use of a NASA-designed Phoenix rescue capsule.  This is the story told in the 2015 movie THE 33.

Well directed by Patricia Riggen, a Mexican-born female director whose credits include 2007s UNDER THE SAME MOON, and based on Hector Tobars book on the incident, Deep Dark Down, THE 33 stars Antonio Banderas and Lou Diamond Phillips as the principal leaders of the miners who find themselves trapped in that mountain, literally between a rock and a hard place, and a Chilean mining company and government that seem unwilling to believe that any of them are alive.  The claustrophobic nature of the saga is very well depicted by Riggen, and give the added gravitas by the largely Latin American cast that portray the miners, including Banderas and Phillips.  A fair amount of this film was made on location not far from the actual mine itself, in Copiapo, Chile; and the remoteness is photographed with the utmost stark reality imaginable.  Riggen also depicts the kind of international media attention that the story got, and how the families and wives of the miners, including Juliette Binoche, who portrays the wife of miner Dario Segovia, played in the film by Juan Pablo Rada, angrily pressed the case for the Chilean government to do more, even to the point of asking for help from outside sources, including an American mining and drilling expert portrayed by James Brolin.  Gabriel Byrne and Rodrigo Santoro portray the government officials charged with finding a way of drilling down to the miners without making the mountain even more unstable than it already is, and perhaps guaranteeing a cave-in that would make rescue impossible.

While it may be easy to portray the Chilean mine disaster depicted in THE 33 as an example of corporate malfeasance that had nearly fatal results, that socio-political aspect is not really discussed in the film, although when the end credits (featuring the real life miners) roll, the end title card indicates that the mining company never compensated the miners for their nearly ten weeks of psychological and spiritual horror (in essence, they really did get the Shaft, so to speak).  The film, however, does go to great lengths to depict the aforementioned psychological and spiritual horror they went through, including a subtle hint that, unless food was sent down to them, they might resort to cannibalism if any of them died off in that hellhole, where temperatures reached 100 degrees Fahrenheit the entire time.  Even without this hint, though, the film that THE 33 most closely resembles is 1993s ALIVE, which depicted the survivors of the 1972 Andean plane crash whose survival did partially depend on cannibalism; it also resembles the equally compelling true-life 1995 space saga APOLLO 13.  Another aspect well depicted is how transfixed the international media, including every news outlet in the United States, covered this story in a way that, given how tabloid-focused it had become by then, was largely tasteful, though also suitably dramatic.  Given the fact that this story has a happy ending, the logic is that it shouldnt work as well as it does.  But much like the two films I just mentioned, both also based on true stories, THE 33 does work because of the details that surround the story, as well as the story itself.

The whole enterprise is topped off by an appropriate, somber, and Andean-flavored score by James Horner, which as it sadly turns out will be one of the last film scores of his; he perished in a plane crash in Ventura County, California on June 22, 2015.  Despite the fairly leisurely pace (some would, mistakenly in my opinion, call it slow), THE 33, like ALIVE and APOLLO 13, is done in the right way, avoiding spectacle most of the time, using CGI only when necessary, and steering clear of sensationalism.  As such, it will likely count as one of the best movies of 2015.",1447804800,,4727,4.8936170212765955
7537670,4,B017Y394CA,"The Movie Review by Andy McKinney
The 33
 How hard is it to make a real life drama about an event that the whole world knows about?  How hard to make a film about a story familiar to every one and make it not simply interesting to watch but to make it mesmerizing to the audience?  I'd say about as hard as granite or maybe as hard as the rocks in a Chilean mine.  But Mexican born film director Patricia Riggen does just that.  ""The 33"" is quite simply wonderful film making.
 I am sure you remember the true life events depicted in the movie.  A cave-in in a deep rock mine in Chile trapped 33 miners deep underground.  They remained trapped for 69 days.  The whole world watched and waited along with the loved ones of the miners, hoping and praying for a successful rescue.
 While still underground the miners themselves agreed with one another to produce a single voice to the world after rescue and to share equally in any proceeds.  The men knew that they would be famous.  The book on their trials, ""Deep Down Dark"" became the basis of the film.  In spite of five different pens having a share in the script the power of the story comes through in the movie.  We get to know several of the miners well enough to root for their rescue.  One poor guy, the real life Carlos Mamani, was a Bolivian, a foreigner and an Indian, separated by nationality and race and on his first day on the job, friendless and utterly alone.
 Others among the miners included an alcoholic who could just barely function, a young new father, a Christian who served as the spiritual hub for the trapped men and their leader who became known as 'Super' Mario.  Even though we know the outcome, we sit enthralled as they struggle to survive starvation and madness deep beneath the earth.
 A big big tip of the hat must go to director Paticia Riggen for her management of this project.  She doesn't do anything flashy, no clever director tricks to distract us.  She lets her players tell the story, the upper story of the family members and rescuers and the lower story of the men trapped with only a few pitiful cans of tuna to sustain them.
 The cast members, starting with Antonio Banderas as 'Super' Mario, the natural leader of the men, do a great job of showing the strain on the trapped miners as human beings in a very tough spot.  Many of the cast members are from South America but you might have seen Rodrigo Santoro, a Brizilian actor who played the Chilean Minister of Mines.  Besides Bandaras other familier faces  include Lou Diamond Philips as a miner and Gabriel Byrne and James Brolin as rescuers.  French actress Juliette Binoche plays the sister of a miner and represents the frantic family members of the lost men.  You will recognize long time character actor Bob Gunton who plays the president of Chile.
 This movie satisfies on every level.  The above average four saw blade film runs a good long two hours and seven minutes.  In spite of its very serious theme it carries a mild PG-13 rating.
 ""The 33"" was filmed in Columbia and Chile.  The opening shots of the stark landscapes of the Chilean dessert show a kind of very hard beauty.  This very well done film took in only $6 million in the USA over the opening week end but world wide box office of $18.5 helps the producers make back the $26 million budget.  The producers should be rewarded for making this superior film and I think they will.",1447632000,48,3403,4.472402597402597
7537671,4,B017Y394CA,"Surprisingly good for a movie you already know is going to end well. The movie is of course about the 33 miners trapped over a 1000 feet underground  in Chile with 3 days of food and water who managed to last over 2 weeks, long enough for rescuers to drive a hole to drop supplies. And then they had to wait another month to get a shaft down big enough to extract them. a solid cast makes this work, helping us feel what both the miners and their families and friends outside were going through.  Saying Antonio Banderas does a fine job should come as no surprise, but Lou Diamond Phillips turns in one of if not the best performance of his career. All in all, well worth watching.",1447545600,22,681,4.271317829457364

7537673,5,B017Y394CA,"Take a story this this, add in a sentence to let you know, ""This Really Happened"" Really...
The story takes on so much more than getting mad at things an actor does or doesn't do because,
in the end, it's real. These people make you feel like you're really watching the real story as it happened.
Then you're getting mad at the real people, the people behind the movie, not the ones making the movie.",1522368000,,400,4.346666666666667

Sometimes true stories being made into movies don't do the story justice, but this one certainly does.  The pacing is slow once the mine caves in, but I think the director did this on purpose to give the person watching a sense of how slow time went by for the miners trapped in the mine, day affect day, week after week as well as for the families waiting in anguish for them to be saved.  It's a rare movie that brings me to tears, but this one did!  Two thumbs all the way up.",1507334400,3,620,4.133333333333334

7537808,5,B017Y394CA,"An infamous rescue in 2010 as written in the book Deep Down Dark by Hector Tobar and adapted for the screen by Jose Rivera, Mikko Alanne, Craig Borten and Michael Thomas and directed with great skill by Patricia Riggen is brought to life by a splendid cast who not only maintain a sense of credibility to the incredible 69 day survival trapped in a mine but also make us aware that the government and the mining company did not compensate these men or their families for the disaster they experienced.

Filmed in Chile and Colombia the action is very real due to not only the cinematography and special effects but also to the fine cast of characters. The place - Copiapo, Chile were many of the town's men dig for gold in the San Jos mine. Mario (Antonio Banderas) takes extra shifts to support his wife Katty and his daughter. lex (Mario Casas) considers taking a much safer job despite that it may pay much less to ease the mind of his pregnant wife Jessica and his father Don Jos. Daro (Juan Pablo Raba) would rather sleep on park benches than accept the charity of his estranged sister Mara (Juliette Binoche). Yonni (Oscar Nunez) entertains his fellow miners with his romantic escapades, while Edison (Jacob Vargas) dresses and behaves like an Elvis impersonator. Jos (Marco Trevino) doubles as a pastor for the men when they head below ground; shift foreman Luis (Lou Diamond Phillips) has growing concerns about the safety of the San Jos mine. Gomex (Gustavo Angarita), the crews oldest member, will retire in two weeks. Then, August 5, 2010. Day 1 - Mario, lex, Daro, Yonni, Edison, Jos, Gomex, Luis, and other men board a shuttle bus to the San Jos mine. While driving through the desert, they pass Carlos (Tenoch Huerta), a Bolivian transplant walking to his first shift at the mine. The bus does not stop to pick him up. Before their shift begins, Luis storms into his boss Castillo's office. While inspecting the stability of the tunnels below ground, he discovered a shard of glass. Luis explains that mirrors were placed between the fissures of the mountain; some of the mirrors have broken, which means the mountain shifted. Luis, concerned about the safety of his men, thinks the mine should be shut down. Castillo disagrees and sends Luis away. Outside, Edison berates Carlos because he comes from Bolivia, where men dig tin but not gold. Everyone climbs aboard a truck, which drives them into the mine through its only entrance and exit: a narrow tunnel. Carlos quickly becomes claustrophobic. Once descended into the mine the mountain collapses and the men are trapped and it is there that the social commentary is stunning.

Behind the scenes  - or rather above ground - there is much work from the Minister of Mines Laurence Golborne (Rodrigo Santoro), the engineer Andre Sougarret (Gabriel Byrne), President Piera (Bob Gunton), and the various countries who come to Chile to drill in an attempt to free the 33 trapped men. Some are heroes, others are not. But the celebration of the release of the men on October 13, 2010 is deeply moving.

The movie could be edited to shorten the viewing time, but in a way  have the movie long mimics the length of time and anxiety and endurance of the 33 me and their above ground families. It works well. Grady Harp, August 16",1470268800,,3287,4.729493891797556

7537845,4,B017Y394CA,"When the Chilean mining disaster happened in 2010, most of the world was watching as these 32 Chilean and 1 Bolivian men were trapped deep into cavern sitting underneath a shifting mountain.  Sixty-nine days later the men were all successfully rescued in what became one of the feel-good stories of the decade.  Hector Tobars book is adapted for the screen under Mexican born director Patricia Riggen (Girl in Progress).  Im not aware of what is true and what is actually inventive movie-making but it all worked for me.  I have some issue with the Spanish-accented English dialog, but I also understand that is the only way the film would sell to America.  At least Hispanic actors were used.  Except for a meaty role from French actress Juliette Binoche who plays Maria Segovia whose estranged younger brother is one of the miners.

Although 6 or 7 actors have most of The 33s dialog, Antonio Banderas is most prominent as Super Mario Sepulveda, the de facto leader of the group.  He supplants the actual supervisor, Don Lucho (Lou Diamond Phillips) who initially makes it known, it is his fault because his safety concerns were ignored by the owners.  Oh, and he proclaims they are all going to die.  Well they did only have a 3 day supply of rations.  Thanks to Marios leadership, they made it last 17 days.  It is then that the rescuers finally broke through, enough that they could send down provisions until they could be extracted.

The film makes a point of most mining accidents and the lives of men are typically written-off.  Rarely are attempts even made because of the cost and the likely outcome.  Laurence Golborne (Rodrigo Santoro), the mining minister in President Pineras (Bob Gunton) cabinet insists on a full court press to get the miners out.  Pineras go-to guy for such things is Andre Sougarret (Gabriel Byrne) and together, the men are eventually rescued.

While the scenes involving the miners occupies much of the film, the other side of the story is portrayed above ground as the families are insistent that a rescue attempt be made.  In addition to Binoches Maria, Kate del Castillo plays Marios wife Katty.  They and others become catalysts as well, getting the attention of the press and eventually helping to establish their own tent-city outside the gates.  If the film has faults, and it does, I found them easy to overlook given the successful outcome.  The film closes with pictures of the real miners (unfortunately not matched up with the actors who portrayed them) and some brief shots of a beach reunion of sorts that the men have.  They remain forever connected.",1466812800,,2603,4.8284424379232505

Being in the US and watching/reading the coverage of this disaster, I don't remember coming across too many personal stories about it. That's why I love this movie. It opens your eyes into the hardships the miners and their families went through.

The writers, directors and actors did such a great job at presenting the story that at one point during the movie, I was contemplating how I would cope in that situation.

This movie is pretty family friendly as there is no sex and vulgar language is minimal.

I would highly recommend anyone that hasn't seen this movie to rent it or buy it!",1465689600,2,846,4.582781456953643

7537872,2,B017Y394CA,"Well.... meh.

This is an extraordinary human story to say the least. I wish it had been told better. A great model for this film could have been 'Apollo 13'.

Issues -

--  The film never once lays out the mine geopgraphically, just where these guys were, how deep, and what exactly happened to trap them there. I know all that, because I read Tobar's book, saw the NOVA episode on this, and am fairly well-versed in the event. Had I not been, I would know..... ""these guys were in a mine and there was a cave-in...  O-Kayyy.....""

--  Getting them out was an incredible technological challenge, just like Apollo 13. That film spelled that out in detail, but Ron Howard managed to keep it both scientific and exciting. Here, there was very little detail that spelled out just what had to be accomplished technically to even find these guys, much less get them out.

--  I would like to have seen more scenes about the incredible national emotional impact this had on the Chilean people as it unfolded, to millions of people who did not know these families at all, but were there with them all the way. There were allusions to that, but surely it could have been better portrayed theatrically in just a few scenes at least.

-- Lastly, I was very bothered by something that was obviously dramatic license, but still irritating. When the capsule rescue began, there was a significant discussion about who would be sent DOWN into the mine at first, to coordinate at the miners end. Eventually, the task went to a Chilean naval special forces officer. In the movie, there was no such person, they just sent the capsule down by itself. OK, well, big deal, c'mon.  But here's the thing: THAT is what a billion of us watching saw on TV. So if you immediately see this and say, ""well, that's not really how it happened"", all of a sudden, the rest of the movie starts to take on a different aura. Then, the whole thing about the capsule getting ""stuck"" on the way was all nonsense, never happened at all, and was totally and obviously just added for drama. Yeah, it's a movie, I get it, but that is always a fine and delicate line.  Ya gotta be careful with a story that we all saw on TV.

OK movie, coulda been better. But wadda I know....",1465084800,3,2232,4.454545454545454

7537943,5,B017Y394CA,"THE 33

I was so excited for this movie when I heard about it, one of the stars was The Lou, Lou Diamond Phillips. He is one of my all time favorite actors and this was a return to the big screen for him as a theatrical release. Plus it was the true story of the minors who were stuck underground for 69 days, which is insane. So when I finally got the chance to see this I was all about it.

In 2010 a group of minors, Chilean minors that is, went to work one day going 200 stories underground but did not come out. After a collapse thirty three men were trapped with a very limited supply of food and water. In order to survive that must come together and trust in one another. As that happens the world up top would watch as their country worked to get them out.

This was a really good film that I am really surprised did not get as much love as I think it should have. It was filmed really well and the acting was superb. Of course I came here for The Lou, Lou Diamond Phillips. He of course was excellent as was Antonio Banderas as the two made for an excellent on screen tem, I am hoping for another film with the two. The whole entire rest of the cast are just as great here from the minors to the families and everyone in-between.

The film was well written and directed and the film felt real. Some say it was made as an Oscar bait type of film but I think it was made the way it was supposed to be. As for the Blu-Ray it looks great as one would expect and comes with a few special features. You get some great behind the scenes and making ofs but I really wish we would have gotten an audio commentary. Over all I think that this was a great film and worthy of any movie collection.",1460160000,,1694,4.002958579881657

7537964,2,B017Y394CA,"THE 33 is the miraculous true story of 33 men trapped in a Chilean mine in 2010. It is amazing story that is not done justice by the film. THE 33 is a disappointment on so many levels and it could have been so much better.

The opening scenes of a breathtaking desert as credits roles leads one to believe an incredible film is about to follow. Unfortunately, much of the film looks like a low-budget 70's flick.  The quality, whether good or bad, is not consistent. Of course, this is a story worth telling so we can overlook technical shortcomings.

Some of the film is fascinating. The mine is so huge that the miners are transported into the mine in large trucks. There are cavernous rooms with furniture and equipment. When disaster strikes, one thing is in the miners' favor, they are able to get into a large refuge room with plenty of space to move around and 3 days' worth of food. Rescue seems impossible but miracles do happen.

It certainly is a fascinating story. What happens to the minds and bodies of men trapped far underground in sweltering heat? Above ground we find the families of the miners desperate to get information. One can only imagine the emotional suffering of all parties. THE 33 tries to mix the stories of the miners with the people trying to save them. Of course, a movie set entirely underground in a collapsed mine would be hard to watch. The miners' headlamps never seem to run out of power so I am not sure if they were in darkness in real life. As the last morsels of food run out, a rather silly scene emerges of the miners fantasizing about loved ones bringing them enormous-sized portions of food. I get the idea of men hallucinating but the scene verged on ridiculous.

There is a fine cast of older actors who are always great to see on screen. Antonio Banderas is almost unrecognizable as is Lou Diamond Phillips. Lovely Juliette Binoche, one of my favorites, is the sister of a trapped miner. Gabriel Byrne is one of the would-be rescuers. Here is where I found a problem. Everyone spoke with a Spanish accent. We have French, Irish and American actors with Spanish accents. Maybe that was to help with the Chilean setting yet later a Chilean newscaster arrives and he speaks in Spanish and English subtitles are shown. Newscasts from around the world in various languages are shown. It all seemed so very odd.

THE 33 misses its mark on so many levels. Yes, it is story of hope and inspiration and seeing the joyous reunion of the actual miners  at the end making viewing the film worthwhile.  Unfortunately, THE 33 is so disappointing and could have been so much more, but the story of the 33 should be told and admired.",1459209600,4,2668,4.54375

Apparently real life is not as impressive to them as some CGI phony movie where the hero jumps from a moving helicopter while shooting 14,000 rounds from a six-shooter without spraining an ankle.  If you do not cheer with adopted Chilean pride as the story unfolds you have no heart.  This was an enjoyable family movie.  Most scenes were less intense than I suppose they really were in real life and even the salty language seemed much, much toned down from the real miners I have known.

I thought it was a great inspirational story of the power of faith and never-ending hope against impossible odds.  The characters were phenomenal and emotionally captivating really drawing you into the story causing you to care what happens to them. I especially loved the character Mario Sepulveda or Super Mario as he is called in the film, played by Antonio Banderas, and Maria Segovia played by Juliette Binoche. They were amazing dynamic characters that I found myself thinking about days after I had watched the film.
 I love to watch movies that cause me to do a little self-reflection. While watching this I found my-self wondering what I would do if I were in a similar situation. Would I be overcome with the bleakness of the situation and just give up and accept my fate or would I be as Mario Sepulveda played in the movie by Antonio Banderas who holds on to hope against impossible odds sparking and continually feeding the flame of hope in all the other miners. I also wonder what past life experiences the character Mario Sepulveda  must have had to give him the presents of mind and fortitude in that critical situation to stand against all the other miners and insist that the food be rationed. I also wonder what deeps of desperation someone would have to sink to in order to drink their own urine to survive.  I personally think that would have been my breaking point.
 I also loved the character Maria Segovia played by Juliette Binoche. Her role of the loving, devoted unmovable sister caused a bit of self-reflection. If I were in her situation how would I react? Would I show the level of love and devotion to a brother or any family member, especially one in which I had a strained relationship. I believe the faith, hope, love and untiring commitment that this character showed was amazing. It defiantly got me thinking about some of the relationships that I have with my brothers and other family members. After watching this movie I resolved to show a little more love, compassion, and commitment to those relationships in my life that could use a little patching up.
 Some of the cons I found to the movie is its predictability.  The movie is about the well broadcast event of the Copiapol mining accident that occurred in Chili in 2010. Even those of us emotionally captivated knew that they would be saved in the end. I wish the film would have showed a few more scenes to better depict the hardship of being essentially buried alive in the mine for the sixty-nine days that the miners were trapped in the mine.  I do however think that director Patricia Riggen did a marvelous job making a spectacular film.",1457395200,6,2647,4.67741935483871

Onto the film.....the film is based on a true story that I believe most of us know the outcome. Antonio Banderas plays the appointed leader who kept the group together in the film version. Lou Diamond Phillips has a respectable role as a safety engineer whose role is defined as making sure they get 250 tons of ore out a day.

The film goes through the emotions in Camp Hope, the families outside of the fence. The film was made in English although there are newscasts and songs in Spanish.

I LOVED this story. Not that the miners were trapped but the outcome. I remember trying to stay awake as each miner rose up out of the ground. Who cares if we speak different languages!, that people care crosses all language barriers! And this movie told one facet of this incredible rescue. Even true/mixed with some fiction it tells a compelling story of people's perseverance not only to survive against all odds, but government who pitched in at the time to get the miners out.

That the miners have never been compensated is a sad commentary on the part of the mine owners and the government. But that is another story.",1456012800,2,831,4.608108108108108

7538339,5,B017Y394CA,"A true story of desperation and unity. This film version is almost as heart wrenching as the reality news coverage in 2010. A reenactment well done by both crew and actors who made it all look convincingly real. The hallelujah finish after two months of fears of a mission ending badly with death. And the amazing part, the film version still brought goose-flesh with the successful rescue of the first miner. When emotion and body sensations are repeated that happened in the reality first-hand news coverage over half a decade ago, well, that's good storytelling. The entombment of 33 miners in a gold mine rescued after 67 days is too unbelievable if it's a story made up in Hollywood (or Chile). The fact that it all really did happen is what drives this film. And knowing the outcome because you watched--like me--on the news nightly, and prayed for these men, did not serve as spoiler for viewing this cinema telling of the events.

You may ask, did the events underground actually happen as depicted? There are only 33 that can say ""no or si"" to that question. They have pooled their story, and I hope received some good compensation from the cinema and DVD versions, since the company gave them nothing for their months sealed below ground. Not even 69 days of wages. The work of the film crew and special effects make it seem like the TV cameras were underground when the mine collapse began. The emotion of miners and their families, as well as the rescue teams, depict what was surely the reality of near death. Emotional and action-packed sequences; and then the feel-good warm fuzzies all over again at the end.",1455840000,3,1624,4.71830985915493

Mario (Banderas) and 32 other miners headed down in a mountain looking for gold. While they are underground the unthinkable happens. Now, with only enough food and water for 30 people for 3 days the 33 trapped miners must ban together and fight in order to survive long enough to be rescued. This is a difficult movie to make emotional. The subject matter lends itself to it, but this only happened 6 years ago and most people remember the events and the outcome. The fact that most people know how this will turn out is a hard thing to overcome. This movie did that and more. The movie was tense, emotional and really sucks you in. You are on the edge of your seat almost the entire time and you actually forget you know how it will turn out. That is a tremendous thing for a movie to pull off. This is a great movie for all ages and I recommend this. The movie fills you with hope and shows what humans can do when their backs are against the wall. Overall, one of the best movies of the year. I highly recommend this. I give this an A-.",1455321600,,1160,4.253393665158371
7538362,3,B017Y394CA,"The 33 is based on the 2010 catastrophic explosion and collapse of the 100-year-old San Jose Mine in Chile where 33 miners were buried alive. Over the next 69 days, an international team worked night and day in a desperate attempt to rescue the trapped men as their families and friends, and people around the world, waited and watched anxiously for signs of hope. Meanwhile, 200 stories beneath the surface, in suffocating heat, tensions were rising, provisions dwindling, and time running out. The film switches between the miners plight and above-ground attempts to rescue them as director Patricia Riggen takes us through the technical business of drilling down.

The first rule of disaster movies is to provide knowledge about the main characters. With 33 men, thats hard to accomplish. Director Riggen focuses instead on a few: a veteran miner on the verge of retirement (Gustavo Angarita), a young father-to-be (Mario Cassas), a philanderer (Oscar Nunez), a voice of reason that no one listens to (Lou Diamond Phillips), a drug addict (Juan Pablo Raba), and a Bolivian who ignites tension among the ranks.  When conditions worsen, the men look to Super Mario (Antonio Banderas), who becomes the unofficial leader, encouraging them to persevere through starvation and lack of oxygen, and serving as referee when in-fighting occurs.

A problem with a movie based on actual events is that the outcome is known. The director must nonetheless sustain attention and build a certain level of suspense. Ron Howard did this in Apollo 13, but The 33 seems more content to draw upon disaster flick cliches and character types. The mostly unknown actors contribute believability to their portrayals, and the means of the mens survival are recounted in meticulous detail, but the end result never really catches dramatic fire.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include a behind-the-scenes look at creating the mine collapse with the cast, crew, and stunt department; an examination of how this story captivated TV viewers with news footage from around the world; interviews; deleted footage; and theatrical trailer.",1455321600,3,2112,5.221238938053097

7538367,5,B017Y394CA,"While no movie is perfect, this was very well done.  I have lived in Chile and my wife is Chilean.  Although there was some added Hollywood drama, the depiction of events and of Chilean people was generally accurate.  Chilean people are hard working, resilient and put their trust in God.  This movie depicts the best of humanity.  I am proud of my Chilean brothers and their families.  Most of us will never understand what they went through.

On a side note, if you read other movie reviews including those on RottonTomatos.com you will find some idiots talking about the movie being racist because of who was cast to play the miners.  These reviewers should be ignored.  They have probably never been to Chile, know any Chilean people and did not follow this story when it was happening.

7538368,5,B017Y394CA,"Based on the book, ""Deep Down Dark"" by Hector Tobar and a screenplay fostered from several, this incredible story of the survival of thirty-three miners trapped underground for what turns into an unbelievable length of time for any hope of rescue. Dedicated to James Horner who did the lovely and ominous soundtrack and who will be greatly missed. These larger than life miners tell their story in this dramatized way that takes your emotions completely hostage. I had seen it on live television when it was happening. I also have seen a documentary, but this retelling in a full-length movie of just over two hours really packs that solid and painfully emotional punch this tragedy needs as this amazing story should be told in its fullest capacity. What struck me so hard from first blush was 'Don Lucho' (Lou Diamond Phillips, in a solid performance) who tells his boss that the mine is getting much too dangerous to be in and the company boss just brushing off his evidence and expertise as the miners go-between.  The owners keep showing him certifications (it comes out later) that the mine is still fine and tells him ""for at least another twenty years"". Then all goes asunder as the miners descend some 1,700 feet below ground in a stifling heat of between 90-100 degrees Fahrenheit when the ""heart of the mountain caves in then blocks them completely from the surface; their lives, their families, their relatives, along with the chance of ever seeing daylight again. This huge mass is twice the mass of the Empire State Building and they are now helpless deep, down and dark in the Atacama Desert in Chili beginning on August fifth, 2010... These miners are literally buried alive.

After Lucho finds and accounts for all thirty-three men, they go to find their rations which are only a supply of three days of food and water. Their plight begins as we watch these men quickly go into starvation, fighting, delirium, guilt and blaming, but they do not give up hope just yet as they turn it around and begin rallying and praying to keep themselves near believing that they may be discovered alive. As the situation on the surface begins to get dire while families and loved ones have gathered, the Company claims the situation is under control. There are many different personas of men in the mine including Mario (Antonio Banderas) who is given the responsibilities of rationing, morale boosting and other aid to come later. A single Bolivian man on his very first day who is totally alone and without anyone, a makeshift pastor, an Elvis impersonator, a husband whose mistress lives next-door to him, a young father-to-be and so many different personalities must keep themselves in check.

This quickly gets reported to ""La Moneda"", The Presidential Palace in Santiago, Chili. A young representative of the government, Laurence Golborne (Rodrigo Santoro) and also the Minister of the Mines is notified to quickly react, but it appears that a private mine is a problem. Bringing the government into full involvement through his urgent interest in these mens lives, he is compelled to intervene but begins with an altercation at the site with the sister of one of the trapped miners, Maria Segovia (Juliette Binoche), who has no use for a government official that is all talk and no action, but is Laurence this type of man? He begins by calling in an expert, Andre Sougarret (Gabriel Byrne) who advises Laurence that there is about a one percent chance of finding them; but alive?

This harrowing film directed by Patricia Riggins is compelling beyond belief because of the truth of it while the world watched. She pulls no punches and does not rely on any spectacle, but the realism of what this would mean to the miners first, then the families and loved ones above. Each and every grueling day of sorrow, then hope, then depression is deftly shown as she goes right into the situation and gets to its heart at each and every turn. Even knowing how this turned out, I was glued to my seat feeling all the gamut of emotion that Riggins made to wash over me. This is a film which certainly needs to be seen as this story should be told and in this way with what was happening underground; beautifully as much as horrifyingly. Its urgency underground and at the surface is palpable and grueling. The ending is very gratifying being able to see upon introduction by name to each of the thirty-three and how they are still all Brothers after their actual sixty-nine days of being buried alive.",1449446400,12,4500,4.787644787644788
7538369,5,B017Y394CA,"I remember when the 33 miners were being broadcasted on live television and I was surprised that it was made into a movie. I remember watching the actual progression and how nations got together and helped the miners get out of that deathtrap caused by the negligence of the mining company. I decided to go watch it to relive that great moment in history where everyone in the world put their differences aside and helped one another. I did not regret it, it was almost exactly like it was broadcast on live television and I got to relive the feeling.",1448928000,,551,4.52
7538370,3,B017Y394CA,"An adaptation of the incredible ordeal suffered by the Chilean miners in 2010 was so desired by Hollywood that a film was in the works before they were even out of the ground. It adds a slightly oily touch to Patricia Riggen's inspiring if broadly predictable human drama, The 33, a film which is bolstered by the direction of Patricia Riggen, whose Under the Same Moon proved she knows how to reach audience's hearts.

Based on Hector Tobar's book, Deep Down Dark, what audiences are treated to is a two-hour look at the 69 terrible days those mine workers endured after the San Jose Mine collapsed with them in it. Their story is one that made Chile more news-worthy than it's been in years, but also captured the attention of the entire world. Riggen's biggest hurdle isn't overcoming that everyone already knows how the story ends; it's overcoming a largely homogenized screenplay that rarely endeavors to go beyond being just another survival drama with all the familiar Hollywood checkpoints.

As such, this probably isn't the most accurate retelling of events, but the one that could get made with just the right number of recognizable stars, wherever they may be from. Antonio Banderas plays ""Super"" Mario Sepulveda, who became an international superstar as the public face of the trapped miners. He's a bold, boisterous guy and a natural leader, while Lucho (Lou Diamond Phillips) is a mine supervisor but too passive to take charge. It's Lucho who leads the men into that death trap after voicing concerns with upper management about the mine's safety, but of course he's ignored because the owner doesn't want to spend the money. Most of the men are given fleeting glimpses of personality; one is an Elvis enthusiast, one has a baby on the way and has dreams of a better life, one has a mistress, and still another is due to retire in a few days. Want to know a good way to spoil a retirement party? Getting trapped 2,000 feet underground.

There's both too much and too little ground for Riggen and the screenwriters to cover. What's going on below ground mostly amounts to the men trying to ration what little food they have, until personality conflicts inevitably begin to flare up. Riggen finds moments of levity in their tragedy, especially in one great scene in which their culinary fantasies are dreamily visualized. As the men fight to survive, the more interesting tale is being spun up above as the women in their lives struggle to keep the faith. Setting aside her French accent and trying on a Chilean one is Juliette Binoche as Maria, an eccentric who sells empanadas on the street and battles with the government (led by Rodrigo Santoro as the Minister of Mining) to get the proper drilling tools to rescue her trapped brother. Kate Del Castillo, Cote de Pablo, and a number of other Hispanic actresses bring soulfulness to what are largely under-written characters. Rather than being a story about the pain they are going through as their loved ones are buried underground; it's about the bonds these women form to help bolster one another through this nightmare.

While Binoche handles herself pretty well, some of the other casting choices are just plain weird and comically distracting. Bob Gunton couldn't be less Chilean if he tried, so seeing him as President Pinera is flat-out absurd. A real momentum killer is a protracted but important subplot involving drill bits. In fact, drill bits and finding the right drill bits is a pretty big chunk of the film, which is about as exciting as it sounds. Those lulls aside, Riggen achieves everything she intends to on an emotional level. There won't be a dry eye in the house by the time it's done, and she consistently finds way to inspirit the audience. It's a terrific story, one that epitomizes the best in all of us. What The 33 isn't is especially memorable. It does what it sets out to do, which is turn a horrible tragedy into feel-good fodder.",1448409600,7,3929,4.790560471976401
7538371,5,B017Y394CA,"The film is based on a true story that I believe most of us know the outcome. The first 10 minutes of the film show us the miners as a community, with gold mining the best gig in town. We get to meet a half dozen or so personalities before the ominous music plays and the film is divided into a surface and subsurface subplots. Antonio Banderas plays ""Super Mario"" the appointed leader who kept the group together and from killing each other, at least in the film version. Lou Diamond Phillips finally lands himself a respectable role as a safety engineer whose role is defined as making sure they get 250 tons of ore out a day.

The film goes through the emotional high and lows as despair sets in Camp Hope, a tent community of the families outside of the fence. The film portrays the mining company as bad and the government as heroes whose hand is forced by public opinion. The film was made in English although there are newscasts and songs in Spanish.

The film is over 2 hours long as we experience all the failed attempts at rescue.  The end of the film shows us the actual miners, and to be honest, none of them looked like Antonio Banderas. The film is a drama. Don't expect an action flick.
