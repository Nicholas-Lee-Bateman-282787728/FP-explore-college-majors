5167367,5,B008IG0A8A,"Clean, attention grabber movies for my children as well as other children who watched it at our church. My kids said that they like the mystery in these movies. I found myself drawn into these movies as I previewed them for our church library. An enjoyable factor for me was the balance of seriousness & humor.

Negative: A possible negative factor that my one child mentioned is that they used a different actress for the 3rd movie in these series. It didn't bother me, but it may make a difference for others.",1374883200,2,511,4.554347826086956
