3905533,1,B002CAWNDS,"Want to see a supremely watered down version of Fatal Attraction?  If so, look no further than Obsessed, a potboiler that holds back much more than it succeeds in terms of being a potboiler.  The Wire's Idris Elba stars as a successful corporate man who also plays loving family man to his wife (Beyonce Knowles), and soon becomes the target of psychotic young temp (Heroes' Ali Larter).  Wholly predictable and cliche, Obsessed is mind numbingly dull from beginning to end, but I guess this is the kind of thing that passes for suspense these days that mainstream audiences seem to eat right up.  Elba is disappointing wasted in his role, while Knowles and Larter do their respective parts at looking gorgeous, and doing nothing else as well.  All in all, Obsessed is something that you could easily save yourself a few brain cells by not giving the time of day, and spending your viewing time on something more worthwhile.",1249171200,37,924,4.786163522012578
3905534,2,B002CAWNDS,"And Ali Larter ain't bad either, so the cat fight alone is worth two stars, even though within the first three minutes the director saw the need to foreshadow where the chick, err... I mean chips would fall. But really, Ali is way out of her weight class, and no where near as competitive as Missi Pyle in Bringing Down the House, as she goes a few rounds with the Queen Latifah dialogue spewing Knowles. Meanwhile somewhere, Michael Douglas is telling Catherine Zeta Jones pass the T-Mobile so he can call his attorneys to find out if the master copies for any more of his films are missing.  By the time I stopped paying attention I felt like I had dropped in on a Douglas film festival featuring Fatal Attraction, Disclosure and The Game with the climax of War of the Roses thrown in for full effect.

 She might be deranged but her intuitiveness wasn't that far off seeing how Charles' possessive paranoid spouse, Sharon (Beyonce) used to be his secretary.  Lisa will not be deterred by any measure of obstacle, Derrick is the non-aggressive objectified prize of her fantasies and Sharon, well she's a woman who might look like the girl daddy always wanted you to marry but she obviously no stranger to applying an ample supply of Vaseline before a fight but regrettably 'thespianly' challenged.  Throw in Christine Lahti (in an absolutely throwaway role) as the investigating detective desperately in need of a clue, Jerry O'Connell [...]into oblivion) as the horny, wandering eye office best buddy and a stereotypically gay office assistant (Matthew Humphreys) who just has to gossip and before you know it, we've cut and pasted the middle third of Douglas's career.

But for this movie derivative and clichd are not enough, so inanity is tossed in to create a trifecta. At one juncture, Sharon kicks out Derrick because according to her logic he exhibited no trust in her although it has been made perfectly clear to the audience she had even less in him.  When she finally relents and the estranged couple agrees to re-unite after three months, the pound of flesh she exacts (in jest evidently) are the keys to his Benz even though she continues to tool around in her immaculately conditioned hybrid Escalade.  During this three month period BTW, Lisa makes no attempt to contact Derrick , when presumptively, he would be at his psychological low point.

I'm only mildly pleased while the put upon couple had a toddler, they had not yet committed to a sacrificial pet.",1247529600,11,2482,4.793911007025761

Derek Charles has the perfect life, until he meets Lisa Sheridan who becomes completely obsessed with him and ruins his life. It started as friendly conversation in the elevator to Lisa trying to make out with him at the office Christmas party.

3905537,5,B002CAWNDS,"Derek Charles is a hard working man, employed as a asset manager in a private company. He is very happy with his beautiful wife, Sharon, and only son, and because of his hard work he just got a huge promotion. But suddenly he gets a temporary worker who is both attractive and smart, and Derek is understandably impressed with her and also finds himself physically drawn to her. However, this new girl is desperate to get close to him at any cost. ""Obsessed"", is one of those movie I just couldn't resist seeing. Beyonce and Idris Elba are great.""Obsessed"", is one of those movie I just couldn't resist seeing. I liked it and it's very entertaining.",1244678400,3,649,4.603448275862069
3905538,2,B002CAWNDS,"A totally predictable retread of the jilted lover movies that seem to pop up every decade or so.  This is a silly, faux thriller that leaves no cliche uncovered.  I think the whole script was written for Beyonce to have her ""you-go-girl"" lines during the absurd girl fight sceen.  The screen play is at least under 120 minutes --well just barely.  That's the good news.  The real problem is the utterly atrotious acting.  Terrible doesn't describe Beyonce's acting ability.  She may be a great singer, but if she were on an acting version of American Idol she would be one of the first to get rejected, you know, in those first two weeks where we see all the hacks to laugh at. Idris Elba as Derek Charles is OK and only makes a few minor novice errors, but he could have been anyone.  I will commit no more words to this horrible flick other then to warn potential victims of move theater prices to save your money.  Rent if you must. Two stars only for the baby's fine acting.",1243123200,56,978,4.418994413407821
3905539,4,B002CAWNDS,"While not as complex or frightening as Adrian Lynn's ""Fatal Attraction,"" ""Obsessed"" still manages to be an entertaining film. In one very crucial way, it breaks tradition with the average domestic thriller: There's no infidelity. There's an awful lot of flirtation, no question, but when it comes to faithfulness, the married man gets high marks. I'm referring to Derek Charles (Idris Elba), a Los Angeles asset manager. He becomes the object of a new office temp's desire, and as we see over the film's 105 minutes, she'll go to just about any lengths to get what she's after. I agree that this is hardly an original premise, and at times, the film seems more interested in being formulaic than in being compelling. But at the very least, it makes due with what little it has, which is to say that it's perfectly acceptable.

It's a classic scenario: Not only has Derek just been promoted to the rank of Executive Vice President, he also has a beautiful family and a luxurious new house. He's respected by his colleagues, his superiors trust him deeply, and he has great friends. Things are going really well.

Then comes the day he enters an elevator and meets Lisa (Ari Larter), a sultry beauty with long blonde hair and a killer figure. She's carrying a large amount of paperwork, so much so that she inevitably drops them in a moment of clumsiness. Derek, trying to be nice, offers to help her out, and that leads to the next inevitable moment--they reach for the same piece of paper at the same time, resulting in their hands touching. There's nothing subtle about this. For that matter, there's nothing subtle about the entire film, which has no qualms about going for the obvious.

Take, for example, a scene that takes place some weeks after Derek and Lisa first meet: Derek walks into the lounge area and sees Lisa on the verge of tears. He assumes she's having boyfriend trouble, and encourages her by saying how pretty she is and how any man would be lucky to know her. In fact, if he was single ... ah, but he doesn't finish his sentence. There are two specific reasons why people do this: (1) some people don't actually mean it when they say it, so there's no point in completing the thought; (2) some people are afraid that they do mean what they're saying, and therefore don't want to incriminate themselves any further. What reasoning do you think Derek followed? Choose whichever one you think applies. I have a feeling the filmmakers wanted it to be ambiguous.

It isn't long before Derek regrets ever having met Lisa. In spite of the fact that she's incredibly efficient (at times frighteningly so), she rapidly becomes overly friendly, pretty much to the point of intrusiveness. It isn't until the annual office Christmas party that things begin taking a darker turn; Lisa takes advantage of the fact that Derek has had one too many and tries to have sex with him in a bathroom stall. He wards her off, but that doesn't stop her from trying again the next day, when she insistently gets into his car as he's leaving work.

Before I go any further, let me backtrack a bit and talk about Derek's wife, Sharon (Beyonc Knowles), who looks bootylicious but acts, for the most part, like a typical wife and mother. When she first learns that a new female temp is working for Derek, she jokingly chides him for allowing such a thing to happen. Then the two actually meet, and while it's too early for Sharon to be suspicious, she definitely shows concern. Let's face it--Lisa's a beautiful woman and Derek is a handsome man. It doesn't take a genius to see what could potentially happen.

As Lisa's attempts at seduction grow more and more brazen, Derek finds himself in a very awkward position, desperate to maintain his reputation but even more desperate to distance himself from Lisa. There inevitably comes a point at which Sharon finds out that something isn't quite right, that Lisa labors under the delusion that Derek is in love with her. This paves the way for the final confrontation, which, for me at least, was the weakest section of the film, designed less like a plausible plot point and more like an excuse to have two women fighting. I have no doubt many will see this movie specifically for this scene.

There are other aspects that don't work too well, including a strange camaraderie between Lisa and a gay office assistant named Patrick (Matthew Humphreys). Within the context of this story, I failed to see how this character was necessary--other than a few stereotypical one-liners and some witty banter, he contributes nothing to the story. There's also Derek's office buddy, Ben (Jerry O'Connell), a sex-hungry party animal who seems to lack the conviction of his personality. He too contributes nothing to the story. Fortunately, these are side characters that have little bearing on either the central story or the three main characters, all of which are the most developed components of ""Obsessed."" While hardly a masterpiece, it's an entertaining thriller that achieved exactly what it wanted to achieve. And even if Beyonc Knowles is better suited for more meaningful characters like Etta James, she has once again proven herself as a competent actress.",1240790400,2,5196,4.785953177257525
3905540,4,B002CAWNDS,"It's inevitable I suppose to compare this to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fatal-Attraction-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00003CXA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fatal Attraction (Special Collector's Edition)</a>, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hand-That-Rocks-the-Cradle/dp/6305213305/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hand That Rocks the Cradle</a>, two classic movies in this genre.  Although there are similarities, this is not those movies, and the plot unfolds in a totally different manner.  Neverthess, if you appreciate it for what it is, two hours of excellent escapism, you might discover that it's an enjoyable experience in it's own way.

Sexy hot new temp Lisa (Ali Larter) gets it bad for happily married exec Derek.  Wife Sharon (Beyonce) goes on hyper alert. ""Is she pretty?"" she asks. ""Pretty plain,"" he says. Oh oh.

As you probably can imagine the innocent relationship takes a turn, as Lisa pursues Derek.  There is nothing she won't do to get what she wants, and the situation spirals out of control in unexpected ways.  Will Derek give in to temptation or tell his wife what's going on?

Obsessed delivers solid entertainment, and the fight scene between between Beyonce and Ali Larter is one of the best girl fights you'll see.  ""You think you're crazy? You ain't seen crazy, [...]!""

Beyonce acting in the Austin Powers movie was singer playing singer. Her acting seemed unnatural.  Her facial expressions vacant, her emotions not quite right. In an interview on Oprah she said she was taking acting lessons. In&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dreamgirls-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000O1799U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dreamgirls (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;she showed some improvement.  In Obsessed she shows remarkable improvement, conveying the emotions she portrays very well.  A convincing and confident performance.  She has become a dramatic actress.

Although Beyonce is the star, Ali Larter,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Final-Destination-New-Line-Platinum-Series/dp/0780631684/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Final Destination (New Line Platinum Series)</a>&nbsp;and Heroes, is a dreamgirl, and it requires some suspension of disbelief to imagine anyone resisting her.  The three actors play excellently, although the camera favors Beyonce, it's not at the expense of the story, or the other two actors who perform brilliantly. No surprise to learn that Beyonce and her Dad are both executive producers on Obsessed.

3905549,1,B002CAWNDS,"*** SPOILER ALERT ***

This movie was horribly clich. Office temp desires a relationship with a married coworker. He is tall, black, and handsome. She is young, skinny, and white. The insecure wife (with an overplayed attitude) is suspicious from the start. There is a party, a few drinks, the female stalker makes her move, a series of hit and misses, and finally the two women have it out. SPOILER! The wife wins.

This movie is for anyone with a chip on their shoulder in need of reassurance. As for Beyonc ... her acting was both visible and lacking in vision. No style. Very shallow. A not-so rare feat for many in the music industry. Few make the transition well. Will Smith is among the few. Perhaps, she should give him a call.",1512259200,2,735,4.518796992481203

This movie was ok.  But, I prefer the 2002 version (Lifetime/Jenna Elfman & Sam Robards) much better.  It's the same story line but the acting, along with the other stars, makes the 2002 film my first choice.  The 2009 version showed a lot more suspense and intensity but it was Beyonc&eacute; Knowles that couldn't pull off the acting for it.  Idris Elba did a fine job on his part.  I thought that Ali Larter did a much better job as a supporting actress than Beyonc&eacute;.  I wouldn't pay to watch this version.

It came out that Derek and Sharon met while she was his temp.  They fell in love, got married and had a kid.  Lisa, is totally OVER THE MOON for Derek and will do ANYTHING to keep him.  Everybody played their parts, but I couldn't get past Beyonce' as Sharon.  She seems forced into acting this role.  I also couldn't get over the fact that NO BACKGROUND was covered with Lisa.  Did she stalk someone else in the same fashion she did Derek and got away with it?  Loose ends needed to make this a cohesive effort.  Still....not too bad.

3905650,2,B002CAWNDS,"There's no question about it:  Judging by this 2009 thriller, ""Obsessed,"" Beyonc Knowles has a great career ahead of her as a singer.

Unfortunately, Ms. Knowles doesn't sing in the picture.  It is, in fact, her first screen appearance where she doesn't sing.  Maybe she should have.  It would have improved things.

The fact is, Knowles is not at all bad, nor are any of the other actors; it's the movie that's bad, a variation on the old ""Fatal Attraction"" ploy.

Everything in the film proceeds according to formula.  We start with an ideal couple:  Sharon (Knowles) and Derek Charles (Idris Elba).  They have been married for three years and have a beautiful baby boy.  Derek is the executive vice president of an L.A. asset management firm; the couple live in a plush, three-story home in a ritzy suburban neighborhood; and they drive recent-model Mercedes-Benz and Cadillac automobiles.  Life is good.

Then a new temp, Lisa Sheridan (Ali Larter), shows up at Derek's office.  She wangles her way into a job as Derek's personal assistant and becomes obsessed with him.  She appears, outwardly, as intelligent as she is gorgeous, but we know she's up to no good when the music becomes ominous whenever she shows up

When wife Sharon meets the new temp girl, it doesn't take her long to get jealous, but Derek assures her that Lisa is only there for a short while.  Meanwhile, it doesn't take long for the audience to wonder what Lisa's motives are in hanging around Derek so much.  Is it innocent infatuation?  Is she conniving, plotting some sort of extortion scheme?  Or is she just crazy?  If the filmmakers had followed that line of doubt, the film might have built some tension or suspense.  But neither director Steve Shill (a prolific TV director doing his first feature film) nor screenwriter David Laughery (""Lakeview Terrace,"" ""Flashback"") seems at all interested in creating tension or suspense so much as boring us to death with talk and then shock and awing us with stupidity.  Haven't any of the filmmakers seen a Hitchcock movie?

I mean, everyone in this film acts stupidly.  The story quickly reveals that Lisa is not devious or cunning; she's simply sick and delusional.  She creates fantasies about Derek loving her, and at an office Christmas party she pushes herself on him in the men's room.  Derek pushes her away immediately, but he tells no one except his close friend and colleague Ben (Jerry O'Connell) about the incident.  When Lisa continues to come on to Derek, he keeps it a secret.  Apparently, he has never read a newspaper or watched a TV broadcast about the scandals of famous politicians, so he doesn't understand the consequences of keeping sexual encounters a secret...or denying them.  The one time he does determine to tell his wife about this deluded woman stalking him, it's at the exact moment when Sharon has gotten off the phone talking to one of her female friends who's in tears about her husband admitting an affair to her.  Derek decides that it might not be the best time to spring his own secrets on her.  It's a coincidence worthy of the best (or worst) daytime soap opera.

For her part, Sharon remains rational for a longer period than anyone else in the story, but then when she finds out about Lisa's advances, she goes completely nuts.  Par for the course in this film.

As the story progresses, Lisa's actions become more seriously outrageous, and the plot gets more seriously harebrained and idiotic.  The temp girl is an idiot; the husband is an idiot; the wife is an idiot; even the couple's baby-sitter and Derek's regular personal assistant are idiots.  No one behaves rationally in ""Obsessed,"" making the plot not at all scary or exciting, just frustrating.

There is one unintentionally humorous aspect to the film, though, one I alluded to earlier.  Every time the music becomes louder, more dramatic, and more threatening, the more likely something baleful is about to happen.  It's so corny and overdone, it might elicit a few giggles from viewers with nothing better to do.

Video:
No complaints about the video quality.  The Sony engineers do their utmost to present the film in the best possible condition they can, using a dual-layer BD50 and an MPEG-4 codec to replicate the movie's original 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Colors are beautifully realistic, deep and solid.  Whites are clear and vibrant; black levels are fairly deep to set off the rest of the hues; and overall delineation is sharp.  The screen is clean, with the merest whisper of grain to provide texture.

Audio:
Although there is nothing particularly spectacular about the soundtrack, the Dolby TrueHD 5.1 lossless audio does a fine job with all aspects of the reproduction.  The surrounds display some excellent musical bloom, along with a little environmental noise; the dynamics are incisive; and the low-frequency response shows its presence on more than a few occasions.

Extras:
The primary bonus items are three featurettes, all in high definition.  The first featurette is ""Playing Together Nicely,"" a fifteen-minute segment wherein director Shill, producer Will Packer, screenwriter David Loughrey, and various of the actors comment on the film's casting and direction, and how great the movie is.  The second item is ""Girl Fight,"" eleven minutes with director Shill, stunt coordinator Lance Gilbert, and stars Beyonc Knowles and Ali Larter commenting on the film's climactic fight scene.  And the final item is ""Obsessed:  Dressed to Kill,"" nine minutes with costume designer Maya Lieberman, who talks about the film's wardrobe.  It's all pretty boring, but it beats watching the movie.

The extras conclude with a digital copy disc of the film, compatible with PCs, PSPs, Macs, iPhones, iTunes, and iPods; BD-Live; sixteen scene selections; bookmarks; English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish spoken languages and subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Parting Shots:
""Obsessed"" kept making me madder and madder as I watched it because the characters' behavior kept getting dumber and dumber.  By the time it ended, however, I wasn't so much angry anymore as I was a little giddy at the film becoming so laughably bad.  Seldom does a movie thriller misfire so severely as this one.",1434326400,2,6252,4.98647342995169

3905696,1,B002CAWNDS,"This is the only word I can use to describe this movie. Hey, kids, do you enjoy movies like Fatal Attraction, The Hand That Rocks The Cradle, Play Misty For Me (for a slightly older version), Disclosure and even A Thin Line Between Love and Hate, which started the beginning of Martin Lawrence's lackluster movie career? Well, this movie is just a composite of those films, albeit much lazier and uncharismatic.

Idris Elba stars as the successful Derek, an office manager or something that women apparently cant resist. In spite of the fact that Elba was on one of the most popular and well-acted shows of all-time, The Wire, and being quite well on the show as well as other acting projects, he loses any real allure as the perfectly boring hero of this flick. Aside from his stilted acting which includes accentuating the wrong words from time to time, his ""American"" accent drifting in and out and not being as nearly outraged (or, as we find out, forthcoming) with the situation he finds himself in as he SHOULD be, he leaves me wondering why on earth would a virtual unknown be cast in the lead for a major motion picture versus his two more well-known leading ladies? Although the film tries to portray him as the sympathetic everyman/victim, it fails miserably. Looking at the movie again, I realize that he did lead his obsessed co-worker on, especially with his dimwitted decision NOT to inform either human resources nor his wife the first time the girl came onto him.

Superstar Beyonce Knowles plays Dereks wife Sharon, who is played up as the epitome of the stereotype of the angry, insecure, semi-dowdy harpy of a housewife a major movie can get away with while trying desperately to remind us that this is a drama instead of a comedy. In a business where someone with a substantial collection of movies under their belt are either hit(s) or miss(es), this film can be added to Beys staggering amount of misses. Her acting is overblown and unnatural and a slap to the face of her few hits, like Dreamgirls and Cadillac Records.  Her usually sultry (or at least what society counts as sultry) appearance is nothing to write home about from her predictable Mom fashions to her terrible hairstyle, which looks like something the stylist stole from Tyra Banks garbage can circa 2004. In addition, aside from her aforementioned insecurity and harpiness (and reminding us of the old adage of never sending a man to do a womans job at the movies conclusion), she also gets the dubious honor of delivering some this travestys most famous lines: You tuched mah CHILD? and She was nekkid in yo BED?

Heroes Ali Larter plays the obsessed temp Lisa, one of the laziest, most one-dimensional, stupidest and even borderline sexist characters ever created. Where did she come from? Why was she so obsessed with Derek when in her first appearance in the film gave very little inkling of this? What was so interesting about Derek in the first place? Why was it so forced down our throats how sexy she was? (FWIW, Ali Larter isn't unsexy, but the movie laid her minx-like behavior on way too thick.) Did she have a mental disorder or a history of doing this to other men in power? This would have added some character development to her, yet the movie neglects to provide a reason or decides to leave this up to our imaginations, which are too busy trying to make sense of the movie itself in the first place.

Other actors within the film are just as pointless. Jerry OConnell co-stars as the worlds worst so-called best friend, Ben, who thinks Lisas obsession with Derek (and possible destruction of said best friends marriage) is both hot and funny. Christine Lahti and Bruce McGill are wasted in their barely there and barely mentioned roles. There are other actors in the movie, yet are just background characters. Hell, even the Charles' son is inconsistent; the boy is clearly a toddler, yet doesn't speak a single word throughout the movie, not even baby talk, as if he was written to be at least six months old, at most. I was not expecting much from this movie, since it reminded me of so many and much better movies before it. However, if anything can be enjoyed from the movie, its the sheer cheesy feeling you get from the acting, the script, the directionor lack thereof--and in particular its one-liners. Its not something to be taken seriously, obviously and even if it were, I suggest you go rent one of the movies or television shows I mentioned previously; at least there, youll get your viewing times worth.",1394236800,,4524,4.707070707070707
3905697,5,B002CAWNDS,Idris Elba is so sexy in this movie. He is fine fine and just plain ultra sexy. I am biased anyway but he was caring and loyal to his wife and one woman had a fatal attraction to him and was just plain ridiculous. Beyonc is great and you will love the fight scene between she and the other woman. For my money Idris makes this film awesome!,1393632000,,340,4.014705882352941
3905698,4,B002CAWNDS,"There are going to be comparisons to Fatal Attraction and Disclosure, of course in this extreme example of erotomania or de Clrambault's syndrome. It can't be helped.  This is a very tense film with some very shocking scenes. There are holes in the plot in which the characters don't react as I would think ""normal"" people would. No reason is given for Lisa's obsession with Derek. He appears, she'd enthralled, and that's it...and there's where the discrepancies begin.  Derek should've never kept quiet in the first place, but immediately hauled Lisa before Human Resources on a harrassment charge. Of course if he'd done that, there might not be a movie. His wife, who professes to love him deeply, is quick to believe he's having an affair, though apparently he's never given her any reason before. She doesn't let him explain, just immediately orders him out of the house as soon as any hint of impropriety occurs. The friend at work to whom he mentions Lisa's fixation, never comes forward to speak of this.  Lisa wanders in and out of his life with no explanation as to how she gets into some of the places she does. Idris Elba is great in the role. Ali Larer is a perfect pyscho, brushing aside any and all denials from Derek that he cares anything about her. Her idee fixe is permanently in place. Beyonce is good as the wife and the lady has a mean right cross when she and Lisa get physical. It's a tense entertainment.",1392854400,,1430,4.622047244094488

3905711,3,B002CAWNDS,"The psychological thriller Obsessed (2009), may not have lofty aspirations, but it nicely achieves some of its goals, presenting a provocative story involving some strong characters, as a happily married lawyer, becomes the target of the fantasies of a temporary worker in his office.

Idris Elba (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Luther/dp/B0041QSZFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Luther</a>) is Derek Charles, a successful account manager at a big investment firm, who is married to his former secretary Sharon, who is played by singer Beyonce Knowles (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Goldmember/dp/B004EJTGTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Goldmember</a>), appearing in her first real dramatic role.  When Derek meets Lisa (Ali Larter), he has no clue that the temporary worker, is about to turn his life upside down.

The story isn't that complex, and has some rather large gaps in the plot, but what is presented is still pretty interesting, as Lisa attempts to manipulate Derek, before making an attempt to seduce him at a Christmas party.  Matters escalate, as Lisa later drugs Derek, and spends the night in his room.  What happens between them is unclear, in what seems like a real missed opportunity.  Matters reach a new level, when the couple's young son is threatened.  While certainly not as graphic as it could have been, and with practically nothing is revealed about Lisa's background, the strong performances of the three leads, helps to make up for some of the deficiencies in the story, which plays much like a Lifetime movie.

Ali Larder (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Final-Destination/dp/B001AQMBHI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Final Destination</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heroes/dp/B004DAG1SS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heroes</a>) does a convincing job of flirting with insanity.  Playing a toned down role, Idris Elba is impressive working with either leading lady.  Also an executive producer for the movie, Beyonce Knowles does well in a dramatic role, which also features an extended fight sequence at the finale.  The supporting cast includes Jerry O'Connell, and Christine Lahti.

Although much that happens is quite predictable, and often defies logic, some may find Obsessed to be fairly entertaining.  The screenplay doesn't take a lot of chances, but builds to a climactic fight between the two women, that while not spectacular, is competently executed, and a glass table begging to be shattered, does play a prominent role.  However, unless you're really into checking out the flawless makeup job on Beyonce and Ali Larter, getting the Bluray probably isn't a must.",1373932800,,2755,6.21578947368421

3905727,3,B002CAWNDS,"Screenwriter David Loughery and director Steve Shill would have us believe that ""Obsessed"" is some absorbing psychodrama. It's actually a Psycho-Comedy, with Ali Larter as Psycho Lisa; the ""office temp"" from Hell at the center of it all. It's all been there, done it before as ""Fatal Attraction""; with Larter less intense than Glenn Close, but equally demented and deranged. In retrospect, ""Fatal Attraction"" is a misogynistic, retrogressive piece of junk-- with smug, cocky Michael Douglas allowed to have his extra-marital affair and get away with it! ""Obsessed"" is obviously the same piece of junk; but it is a much more fun, ""popcorn movie"" piece of junk.
  Derek's (Idris Elba) marriage to Sharon (Beyonce Knowles) is so stable and hot-- they make love on the bedroom carpet of their beautiful new house-- he, unlike Michael Douglas in ""Fatal Attraction"", won't even THINK about having an affair.
And twisted Lisa tries so hard to seduce him (in the Men's Room, parking garage, etc.). Elba is such a dull actor, he's not the type anybody would flip their lid for.  Now, L.L. Cool Jay would have been perfect casting--AND PERFECT eye candy in the role. Jerry O'Connell co-stars as Elba's office pal with a very liberal attitude towards office ""hanky-panky"", and Christine Lahti is an investigator who needs a few more brains in her head.
 Don't worry, though, Beyonce is not going to play the ""victimized wife"" to any degree. Beyonce brings her ""Diva Attitude"" to the ""wife"" role-- and thank God! Things don't get interesting until Larter attempts suicide; and Beyonce tells dull Elba to get the hell out of her house! The fun part is just about to begin; because the movie is just an excuse for a ""girl fight"" between Beyonce and Larter. Beyonce and the fight do not disappoint! Beyonce does a GREAT job of whipping Larter around like she is a rag doll (""I'm gonna whip the floor with your white ass!""). Beyonce's triumphant song over the end credits, the ironically/hilariously titled ""Smash Into You"", did however leave me in fits of uncontrollable laughter.",1359676800,,2065,4.942363112391931

I also knew by the long shot of the attic with the weak floorboards that it was going to play a significant part in the movie later on.  To say that there is nothing subtle or unpredictable about Obsessed is an understatement.  We get a pretty married couple with a cute baby, but we never really know how old he is.  Hubby tells the temp they've been married for three years, and other coworkers have made it clear that he married her because he got her in trouble.  Okay, fair, he did the right thing.  So why is it that when he's going to the Christmas party she wants him to eat something if he's going to drink (Beyoncee sounds like my mom used to when I went out!) because he got her in trouble the year before.  Um, so is this kid a little more than 2 or is he 9 months old?  If he's two, he should be munching on cookies and eating solid food!

Ali Larter as the temp does everything you expect her to do as a psycho chick without any reason behind it.  What temp knows all about the vice president of the company they're not staying at in the first place?  Most temps just want to get their check and get out.  And if she's so gosh darned efficient, why is she a temp in the first place?  Answer THAT one!  All we know for sure is that she's nasty, conniving, and wants to break up a happy little family consisting of a wife who pushes her husband around so much you'd think he'd be in the market for a little side action.  Anyway, this plot reeks of haven't-we-met-beforeisms of deluge quantity impact so as to rival a Mississppi flood, except more disastrous.

The acting is so-so, but Beyoncee' is pretty bad except for the end when the claws (and the previously mentioned attic floor) come out.  Too bad about that one ditzy moment of compassion.  Yeah, right, drop that bee-otch!  Better yet drop the idea of seeing this unless you can do it for free.

3905740,2,B002CAWNDS,"Not that you didn't know it based on the title and the cover art, but it's an updated version of Fatal Attraction.  Save for some major holes in the plot, it was an ok movie.  The problem is that it was done before and they did it better the first time because there weren't so many holes in the plot.

Derek has everything - a good job, nice home, a beautiful wife (Beyonce Knowles, no less!), good friends, and a baby.  One day he gets a new temp in his office, Lisa.  She was blue one day because she was having some man troubles, Derek comforts her, and she becomes obsessed with him - showing up places where he is and then living in a fantasy world that they are having an imaginary affair.  His wife Sharon, however, does not remain living in ignorant bliss, but will confront Derek and kick him out of their house for months when she learns that he and this woman may have had an affair.  And in the end, as in Fatal Attraction before, there will be confrontation between the wife and the mistress.

If he had actually had an affair with the obsessed woman, it would have made a bit more sense.  If Lisa had a past history of behavior (even by something as lame as finding a box full of newspaper clippings), one would have realized that she was very unstable, then perhaps debate ""So he made a mistake"".  But Derek never makes a mistake, he rejects her outright and every other attempt she makes towards him.  Sharon (his wife) naturally thinks that something is amiss and becomes furious.  Understandable, but she does not really grapple with things when she realizes that her husband did not, in fact, cheat.

It's an ok movie, not horrible by any means.  But don't hold your breath that this is a new innovation.",1313366400,2,1724,4.3974763406940065
3905741,1,B002CAWNDS,"'Obsessed' was written by David Loughery and directed by Steve Shill. The movie stars Idris Elba, Ali Larter, Beyonce Knowles and Jerry O'Connell. The trailer for 'Obsessed' had me fired up and ready to see a fantastic movie, however, the trailer ended up being the best part. I struggled to sit through this flick and was disturbed over the $3.00 I had spent to rent it! We have all seen this movie before. It was called 'Fatal Attraction'. The difference being that there was none of that pesky sex stuff to make us understand how our villainess became so enthralled with our married, male lead!
The acting in 'Obsessed' was much like watching a fourth grade play (No offence forth graders), and very quickly made me come to the conclusion that not all singers can act, regardless of their efforts...sorry Ms. Knowles! Ali Larter, on the other hand, played a fantastic psycho but the movie's dullness and lack of luster threw a dark veil over her performance. If you are looking for a good DVD this weekend, Obsessed IS NOT IT ! Surprisingly, this movie grossed $68 million dollars at the box office. Good thing there is a no-refund policy on box office hits...or in this case, misses!

3905742,2,B002CAWNDS,"I never thought Fatal Attraction would look deep and intricate until I saw Obsessed. It really made me appreciate the work that went into the 1987 film. By comparison, and even by itself, Obsessed had almost nothing to it. Despite production credits that boasted Beyonce Knowles and Magic Johnson, it would have been weak even as a TV movie.

The only good thing about the film owed less to Fatal Attraction than to Disclosure. Obsession created a sketchy but interesting picture of just how much of a mess sexual harassment by a female employee could create for a good boss and family man when he did nothing wrong but circumstances conspired to make it look like he did.

Here, the guy was a young executive at a hard-working, hard-partying investment firm. A good-looking guy with a history as a ""player,"" he married his last female office assistant. A sexy blonde temp is attracted to him, and his office buddy reacts with a ""go for it"" locker-room mentality. The exec has a lot to lose.

His wife is high-maintenance, strong-willed, and jealous, insisting that only male secretaries can work for him. Then his wife got even more touchy when her sister's marriage hit the rocks over infidelity. Another source of tension is that the exec is uncomfortable with his wife's plan to go back to school to ""get her degree"" (in what is not clear), now that their son was born.

At work, the exec is important to client relationships and to his firm's reputation. The temp uses her position (including listening in on his phone calls and manipulating his weakling permanent assistant) to get information about him. After several polite conversations, she suddenly became hyper-aggressive, ambushing the exec in a stall in the men's bathroom during an office holiday party (about the only scene in the movie with any real suspense, as to whether his co-workers would see and misinterpret what was going on) and in his car in the office parking garage. He rejected her and tried to discuss it with his wife, his buddy, and a human resources official, but for natural enough reasons ended up holding back each time. When the woman attempted suicide, after somehow secretly gaining access to his hotel room at a firm retreat, the situation blew up, with him looking terrible to his wife, co-workers, and police.

But the movie failed to develop the situation effectively or to take it anywhere. At crucial points in the story, the temp simply disappeared, either quitting work or being whisked away to another city by an unseen sister. Her actions did not build into a fast-paced, suspenseful sequence of events. Instead, even when reasonably well executed -- such as a visit to the exec's house to fool the babysitter into letting her get access to the baby -- they seemed aimless and disorganized. A prime example: the night before the suicide attempt, the temp drugged the guy senseless; in a confusing, dream-like sequence, she then showed up in his hotel room and got into bed with him. Nothing was ever made of this scene. Then the movie really fell apart, with little happening -- none of it surprising, interesting, or entertaining. This included a ridiculous, stagey, drawn-out catfight to the death between the wife and the scantily clad temp at the end. Musical sequences went on way too long in the movie and did not seem to fit. The pace was too slow.

Idris Elba was good, if somewhat wooden, with what he was given to do as the male lead. The temp was the thinnest of cardboard characters, a pure psycho with not a shred of depth or background or explanation for her behavior and with nothing meaningful to say or do. Frankly, I was embarrassed for Ali Lartner, who had nothing to work with in this film but her good looks. Beyonce seemed okay in the thin role of the wife until toward the end, when her lines and actions sunk to the worst of smack-mouth, tough-mama clichs. None of the supporting cast added anything worthwhile or memorable; all were let down by the weak material, especially the intelligent Christine Lahti looking pathetically ineffectual as a police detective.

I had hoped that this movie would be fun and interesting to watch. Instead, it was a near-total waste of time.",1310342400,,4200,4.784827586206896
3905743,4,B002CAWNDS,"This movie seemed like a combination of Jungle Fever, with a twist of Fatal Attraction, and Wall Street, all in one. I liked the strong commitment minded role Derek portrayed of rejecting Lisa's advances. Usually these interracial plots are portrayed in the script, by weak black men characters. Black men that are desperate, and on a mission to get with white women. And eventually permanently taking themselves off the dating market of availability, towards black women. Black men portrayed as big, strong, and dumb, with jungle fever.

It was refreshing to see a strong, committed, black family man, finally resist a white woman for a change. Refreshing to see him stay loyal to his marriage, and try to keep his family together. It was especially uplifting to see that Derek was successful, and nowhere near as insecure, or as weak like Tiger Woods. (The self-proclaimed Cau-Blin-Asian). The Tiger Woods type would have quickly given in to Lisa, by grinning and pretending, and secretly fornicating with this woman, to escape his obvious blackness.

Derek was the perfect example of what to do when you are tall, dark, handsome, financially successful, being pursued, stalked, bullied, by an overly aggressive woman. I was hoping that Derek did not give up, nor give in to Lisa. She had a smile that could win over the weak, she had very sexy, and graceful, body language, with natural rhythm. She was very convincing for the mentally ill part that she portrayed. Beyonce showed the ugly disrespectful side of some black women, and why some successful black men gravitate to other women. Beyonce expected Derek to remain faithful to her, while he was put out the house and suffering emotionally, all while he kept a roof over her head.

In real life situations, most unemployed wives, would not put their six figure salary husbands out for 3 months, after just purchasing their first dream home. I found out the Executive Producers of the film also included Beyonce Knowles, and basket ball great Magic Johnson. They've continued the cinematic expectation, exploitation, and mammy-fication, of the angry black woman syndrome. Beyonce blinded herself to the truth of Derek's complete innocence, and showed excessive anger, insecurity, cursing out, fussing, behavior just as mentally unstable, and unpredictable, as Lunatic Lisa. When the movie first came on, Beyonce played difficult to get in bed, and was trying to get out of knowing Derek.

The ultimate showdown between Beyonce and Lisa, was not believable on behalf of Beyonce's weak script. Beyonce offered her kind hand, in a last ditch effort to save Lisa from falling over 30 feet to her death, when the attic floor caved in. Lisa had invaded Beyonce's home, and was trying to kill her, and Beyonce decided to try and save Lisa's life. Executive producer Beyonce, gave herself the script of playing a good samaritan, by trying to save Lisa as she dangled from the high ceiling. Lisa decided to grab Beyonce's hand, but not to save herself, but to try and pull Beyonce down also, so both would fall to their deaths, and neither would be with Derek. The attitude that if I can't have him, you can't live to have him either.

Overall a different outcome of a growing black men, white women phenomenon. Idris Elba was the perfect actor for the part of Derek, Ali Larter was the perfect actress for the part of Lisa. Beyonce unknowingly played the perfect part to explain why some black women, force black men to bolt out the back door, to be with other women. The baby did not look like Derek or Beyonce, could have ever been his parents. The movie looked great on Blu-ray, and the soundtrack was mysterious but perfect, for the fatal attraction, demented role that Lisa portrayed very convincingly.",1308268800,7,3757,4.919558359621451

3905747,4,B002CAWNDS,"Obsessed is a really good suspense about a man who's just starting a family and, while at work, stumbles across a secretary who has a huge obsession with him.

It starts off as a mild game of flurting inside an elevator, but soon escalates into the woman transforming into a psychotic lunatic constantly spying and seducing the man.  Eventually it leads to the woman making unexpected visits to the guys home.

The storyline is a bit predictable which is why I'm taking away one point, but as far as utter suspense and keeping me glued to the television screen goes, YES!  I was totally absorbed into the storyline despite several moments of predictable writing.

Of course throughout the film a question constantly came to mind- ""Why not tell your WIFE about this crazy woman?"" because you just know the wife would understandably get bent out of shape over the whole ordeal.  That turned out to be a big mistake.

I really liked the woman who played the part of the psychopath.  Her performance was totally believable.

She needs to stick to a microphone and leave the acting to the profesionals, money can buy a lot of things but I don't think there is any amount of money that can buy Beyonce an acting career, hopefully this was a learning experience for her.

First of all Beyonce better not quit her day job cause acting is not her thing. Beyonce cannot pull off the wife scorned and the only reason she got this part is because her father is one of the producers.

Beyonce's character Sharon is not rootable at all, she's too damn possessive, ""Why didn't you call me back,"" ""Are you listening to me,"" ""Eat something,"" shut up. The ultimate ""I thought we had an agreement no female assistants."" Her husband Derrick is not in charge of who gets hired to work as a temp, so she shouldn't be blaming him for that. Then when she meets Lisa, Sharon is acting like a bitch with a stick up her ass. When they first met Lisa did nothing to show she was obsessed with Derrick and just making conversation but Sharon just made her insecurities show. Does she not have faith in her husband for him not to go sleeping around.

Derrick being an idiot not telling his wife Lisa came on to him just because Sharon just talked her sister off the ledge. What a pathetic plot device to use to keep him from telling his wife. Then when Sharon finds out and Derrick is telling her he didn't do anything with the woman, Sharon automatically believes Lisa's story and not her own husband. She kicks her husband out of the house for 3 months, where there is no solid proof of him cheating. When she kicked him out did he go out and cheat and be with another woman like some men would do, nope. She's acting crusty for 3 whole months of not talking to him and all for what? How the hell is she kicking him out and she got no damn job, did she pay one bill during those 3 months, no she didn't because she has no income.

Why was Lisa targeting Derrick specifically, there was no reason why she became obsessed with him out of the blue. Like others said they gay assistant or Derrick's best friend could have been behind the whole thing but no they weren't. So makes no sense at all. The ending is so predictable, girl catfight and the police show up the minute the catfight is finished and her husband shows up right along with the police, what a piece of crap.",1284940800,11,2192,4.300242130750605

3905753,2,B002CAWNDS,"This film is almost an exact copy of Fatal Attraction...you know the thriller starring Michael Douglas and Glenn Close. It felt like the director didn't even care about the plot of this movie, and to make matters wrose he figures ""Hey, let's cast Beyonce!"", that'll be a sure way to draw a crowd to see this movie...and it did.  Like most of Ms. Knowles films, her fans don't care what the movie is about as long as she's in it. (Remember her in 'Carmen: A Hip-Hopera'?) The majority of people watched that film with no prior knowledge about Bizet's Carmen...or at least Dorothy Dandridge's 'Carmen Jones' as long as Beyonce's in it who cares right? I do...

Besides 'Obsessed' not being that great of a film with a recycled plot, Beyonce's performance is average at best.  She forces her lines too much and her acting skills don't come naturally to her.  Her dialogue in the movie makes you want to roll your eyes and facepalm, and you almost feel sorry for her.  Though she has a few films under her belt, she could still use about 2 years of acting school. Then again her role in this film didn't require much talent, all she had to do was play the black woman who's 'not having it' when a white woman tries to sink her claws into her man.

I would say the only redeeming attribute of the film is Ali Larter.  Even though she plays the cliche jilted vixen who eventually goes pyscho over her completely fabricated love affair with Idris Elba, her performance is still strong, as well as Elba's.

Idris Elba looks like a younger Magic Johnson (ironically one of the Producers of this mess) but he acts like an Idiot: instead of taking care of the Stalker/Nut Job with a quick visit to Human Resources, he allows Ms. Lauter's Lisa to keep harassing him until it's too late. Ms. Lauter is a completely unconvincing Psycho. She seems more concerned with good camera angles and her skimpy wardrobe. But she looks like Meryl Streep compared to Beyonce Knowles. Ms. Knowles struggles to bring any sympathy to her character and while she looks great and treats us to some new songs (!) , she simply can't act. Period.

3905755,3,B002CAWNDS,"I kind of like this movie.

Seriously, this movie is kind of stupid yet completely entertaining.  I was really floored with how much enjoyment (cheap and slightly guilty I will admit) I got out of this movie.  My wife and I happened to catch this while lazing it up on our last vacation, and while I was not initially interested in watching the film at all I must say that it held my attention and then some.

Yes, the film is kind of a cheap knock off of `Fatal Attraction' with inferior acting and plot development, but it doesn't matter.

The film follows a successful man named Derek who happens to land in the evil and manipulative clutches of Lisa, a hot temp who has a thing for him.  The thing is, Derek is married.  He has a family.  He isn't interested (well, at least not to such a degree that he would jeopardize what he has for her).  Lisa is very interested, so much so that she goes all sorts of bat-poop crazy and starts wrecking Derek's life, one ridiculous move after another.  With Derek's family on the line, things start getting pretty intense...and then, well, you have Sharon, Derek's wife; and she isn't content with `sitting pretty'.

Yes, there are many moments in this film that are unintentionally funny (Beyonce alone is unintentionally funny) but it doesn't matter.  Nothing matters here.  The film is fun.  Aside from Beyonce's ridiculous performance, and Ali's obvious overacting (I miss the days when she was a fresh face with lots of untapped potential) there is a surprisingly deep performance delivered by Idris Elba.  Seriously, this is far from what I expected.  He adds layers of authenticity to Derek's situation, and you can feel each emotional connection he has on full display here.  It is a performance that is far above the material, which also makes this film somewhat of a hidden gem.

Go figure.

So, the movie is not a masterwork of any kind, but when it comes of mindless popcorn thrillers, this one is better than average in the fact that it actually entertains more than it insults our intelligence.  Sure, I gave it a C, but that is a C+ with a very strong recommendation.  Seriously; take a lazy Sunday afternoon and pop this one in the DVR.",1280966400,4,2195,4.605670103092783

This is the most annoying, in fact literally painful film I've seen since... hmmm ever really. There's a 'successful' guy with a wife and a small kid who gets hit on by a new temp worker. In fact she sets out to conquer him from his wife. We have no idea why, I mean the guy is happily married, has money, a boring job as some finance manager, and looks ok, but that shouldn't be enough to be singled out like that. Anyway, the stalker is just so unattractive that viewers would find it hard to consider her a genuine threat to the marriage.

Except of course the wife is almost as unattractive. She gets hysterical, with no attempt to understand what's going on. Beyonce seems to have just needed a role where she could be angry. Maybe she is angry in real life, take it easy girl, move out to the country, real life isn't lived in LA.

I sort of enjoyed the final catfight between the two jealous princesses, though I didn't really care who won. Not that it was ever in doubt.

So If anyone know's how I can go about obtaining the music from ""Obsessed"" pls let me know. Also if you really want to see Beyonce' in a much more humble role and believable rent/buy ""The Fighting Temptations"".Now that was a fabulous movie and the soundtrack is off the hook. Especially the cut The O'jays do that features Beyonce' and Angie Stone. The movie stars:Cuba Gooding Jr,Beyonce',Mike Epps,Little Zane,Rue Maclaahan(Golden Girls)Angie Stone,Montel Jordan and a host of other great actors/actresses. Trust me you won't be disappointed. But getting back to ""Obsessed's"" soundtrack drop me a line if you know something about this music. Some times it's so frustrating to hear great songs from these movies and it's so difficult to find or purchase. Maybe Amazon.com should start a division where you can find out about any musical artist on a particular movie soundtrack or at least point us in the right direction in terms of finding the artist and purchasing the songs from them directly or their label/record company.

3905769,2,B002CAWNDS,"Let me state that I love Ali Larter the actress. She is pure sex. Blonde, slinky and a smile that would make you hand over all your credit cards without a thought. But this movie is unbelievable and very predictable. Ali is perfect in bluray and shockingly beautiful on the plasma screen. She is an amazing talent that is very easy on the eyes along with a voice that would glue you to your chair even if she read the ingredients to a breakfast cereal.

But please, any man under the influence of alcohol trapped in a bathroom stall with such a seductive lady (this is from the movie and not my fantasy world) would not be so self-righteous without becoming slightly tainted by her seduction. The movie could have been better if he was completely conquered by her and then let the events play out. Ali is believable as the office hottie and does not dressed in unaffordable fashion beyond her pay scale. I would added many facets of his downward fall into the debauchery that would follow after his seduction into office sex.  After all, he met his wife at the same office and now they are both virginal members of the choir. Instead we are subjected to a predictable and overly long cat fight.

This is a one watch movie. I have tried to play it again but even Ali can't save this weak move. There is nothing wrong with the other actors. They were just not given anything to work with to make this a true suspense drama.

First of all Beyonce' should REALLY stick to singing...that's where her raw talent lies. I think Sanaa Lathan or Gabrielle Union would have been better casted for the role of ""Sharon"", but since this movie was produced by Ms. Knowles and her father, who else would play the part other than she? Now here are some of the flaws I found to be noticeable through out the movie. In the beginning of the movie, Sharon clearly states that the baby, Kyle is 2 years old. When Derek asks Sharon what her plans are for the night (right before he leaves for the office Christmas party) Sharon tells him ""the usual, formula, oatmeal...."" What parent feeds their kid formula at the age of two?  Sharon is a stay-at-home mom. Before Derek leaves for the party, she tells him to make sure that he eats something if he's going to be drinking....why didn't she cook something for him to eat at home? When she tells him that he needs to eat something, she reminds him that he drank too much last year at the party which resulted in her becoming pregnant and giving birth to Kyle. If that were true, Kyle would only be three months old (if conceived in December, Kyle would have been born in September)...so how is Kyle two years old?  She also mentions earlier in the movie when she's talking about her upcoming school schedule that Derek told her that once he got promoted and she could have a baby and then return to school. This sounds like baby Kyle was planned and not mistakenly conceived out of drunken passion. This movie was so predictable from beginning to end. Idris Elba, Ali Larter and Jerry O'Connell played convincing roles, but there was absolutely no chemistry among the cast. Beyonce' is a talented singer and performer, but she has definitely not been gifted with the acting bug. Obsessed was a diaster in the making...literally.",1262822400,11,1925,4.593023255813954

The plot is predictable and it is unfortunate that they didn't at least TRY to make it stand out from similar films. There were some excellent opportunities to create ""I didn't see that coming"" moments - you know, the kind that make a film stick out, or become a must-buy for your DVD library. This movie was written closely to the formula - sort of like Harlequin novels; no deviation, no surprises. The end scene where the wife is finally facing off with the obsessive freak goes on WAY too long and runs into the ridiculous.

I always love Ali Larter as a psychopath and she really shines in this film - more so than the other actors. Beyonce Knowles was surprisingly good; I was expecting a lot worse.

That said, I still liked Obsessed. There was a certain deviant charm to it that resonated with the thriller genre lover inside.

Let me start out by saying that Beyonc's man (Idris Elba) is the perfect example of what a husband should be: imperfect, but very close to perfection.

He didn't stray from his wife and kept his ground during a lot of stuff that the ""obsessed"" put him through.

I think this movie is underrated here. 2 1/2 stars my butt. This movie was good.

Maybe it WAS a re-tread of some movies but it was still very entertaining, with bits and pieces of goodness on the way until the finale which was just short of excellence.

Every one of the main characters acted their butts off, and that includes the deranged temp who was in love with B's man.

The movie starts off with her and her husband moving into a beautiful (and big) house, where they plan on spending a great deal of their lives together. They move in with their young son and make things cozy. Edris goes to work quite often and brings home the bacon as Beyonc provides a stay-at-home environment for her child, Kyle (or is it Cal? Hard to understand sometimes).

The action doesn't really happen until the end so you will just have to hold on.

All in all, a good watch and worth the rent.

3905791,3,B002CAWNDS,"Obsession is used in so many things these days, from describing how people relate to politics to perfume. Now the name has been taken and used for a feature film that offers little new but delivers the goods for fans of the genre.

That genre is the cheated on spouse whose rival goes crazy and attempts to take over. Perhaps the biggest known film in this genre was FATAL ATTRACTION. After that film came out, it's hard to believe anyone would be stupid enough to cheat on their spouse. And yet they continue to do so. If not we wouldn't have films like OBSESSED.

Derek Charles (Idris Elba) is an asset manager with a major firm. He's just about to land the biggest contract of his career, things are going well with his wife Sharon (Beyonce Knowles) and they've recently had a child. Life couldn't be better.

Then one day a secretary takes ill and Derek finds a temp in the office by the name of Lisa Sheridan (Ali Larter). They first meet accidentally in the elevator but not long after he finds Lisa working as a temp for his ill assistant. While she seems efficient, she has a certain air of familiarity about her that bothers Derek.

No doubt this comes from a past of flirting in the office, a past that resulted in his marrying Sharon. And the two of them made a pact of no female secretaries. When Sharon discovers the young woman working there, she gets angry (since he told her she was plain looking) and suggests he find a replacement. This happens soon enough when his assistant comes back. But then Lisa snags a job replacing another ill secretary.

At the office Christmas party, Lisa makes her play for Derek by trying to catch him under the mistletoe. This lame ploy is brushed off but not before she follows him into the men's room and plants a big old wet one on him. Not one to fall back on his old ways, Derek rebuffs her attempt but she doesn't let go. Then again, he fails to mention the problem to Sharon.

Instead not long after, Derek finds himself about to head home in the parking garage when Lisa jumps into his car wearing a trench coat. And underneath? A revealing teddy. Derek insists she get out of the car but Lisa is convinced that he truly loves her. While he continues to tell her to get out, she argues until he finally gets her to leave. Swearing to tell Sharon when he gets home, he puts it off when he finds her crying about her sister whose husband has just had an affair.

Push comes to shove and Lisa attempts suicide blaming Derek for the whole thing. The police now begin to investigate Derek even though he denies everything. Lisa has planned this well and the evidence all points to the two of them having had an affair. He denies, she confirms. And Sharon, fearful of his previous indiscretions prior to their marriage, believes Lisa and kicks Derek out.

Eventually the proof comes out of Derek's innocence. Months go by and Sharon forgives him, even though he did nothing wrong with the exception of not telling her immediately. Lisa has returned to the care of her sister after the initial hospital stay. But she's out again and about to make one last attempt to regain the man she is certain loves her. While that may be her desire, it isn't one Sharon is bound to take lightly and the battle is on.

It would be easy to say that this film is predictable, because honestly it is. But there are some films that come along that are predictable and that's okay. It forms a sort of shorthand for the viewer and fulfills the need for this sort of trashy romance type film.

While it does fill that need, it left me feeling like it was more routine than anything. I found it hard to believe that someone who has worked so hard to get where he is could act so stupidly and not notice what is right before his eyes. The character of Sharon was such a shrew at times I had a hard time sympathizing. She was so determined to believe Derek could do wrong that she never gave him a chance to speak let alone defend himself. For two people so in love one would think at least she would give him the chance.

The actors perform well in this outing, doing what a good actor does. They make you lose the idea that this is an actor and instead believe them in their roles. Especially well done is the performance by Larter which could have found its way into clich. Instead she comes off as truly scary while at the same time making you feel a touch of sympathy for her and her unstable condition. She only wants to be loved.

While the performance delivers that, one has to also suspend belief to the extreme to believe that someone as attractive as Larter wouldn't be able to find someone who cared for her. Even a shallow relationship would have been enough for the character of Lisa to jump at. Then again, I guess one could always fall back on the idea that ""it's only a movie"".

So does it entertain? Does it make for a good viewing? Sure, especially if you like this genre. For a night's rental you could do worse. As for a vehicle that will drive the career forward of Beyonce? I don't think this one will do it. She seems truly capable in her role here.

Oddly, even though Shill has plenty of chances to inject some intrigue into this fairly routine go-around of one woman's mind fantasy about moving in on a one-time bachelor now happy family man complete with the lovely Beyonce as wife Sharon, a too cute toddler, brand new upscale abode and requisite Mercedes Benz, he plays it straight, offering instead the usual tale of pursuit, rejection and violence.

With Jerry O'Connell playing a smarmy office mate, Shill had a great opportunity to add a behind-the-scenes note of competition utilizing Lisa's obvious charms as bait to lure Derek into a semi-scandal that may lose him the firm's more prestigious clients.  Doesn't happen.  This is ""Fatal Attraction"" redux without the boiling rabbit . . .

. . . and without the quiet albeit resigned hysteria of the Anne Archer-type wife.  Once Sharon gets wind of Lisa's intrusion within her dream Queendom, her nostrils flare with a heady sense of survival `hood-style and she prepares herself psychologically with some knowingly street-smart explicatives that suggest that once she gets involved blood will be spilt.  Other than exhibit ample displays of anger and jealousy, Beyonce Knowles does little else--her role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cadillac-Records/dp/B001P3SA94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cadillac Records</a>&nbsp;as Etta James showcased her beauty and vocal talents with more poignancy and depth.

Bottom line: Director Shill should have added a corporate rivalry subplot to this ""Fatal Attraction"" clone that would have at least warranted some ingenious form of retribution rather than just two women duking it out for the attentions of a stud-ly investment banker.  Attach a star if you love catfights involving a blonde in her underwear and a high-heeled Beyonce with a murderous glint in her eyes.  Okay if nothing else is on.

3905802,1,B002CAWNDS,"A poor man's version of Fatal Attraction with a series of dumbfounding stupid events - easily avoidable leading to 'a crazy woman is stalking me' formula. The acting wasn't very good, the situations where Idris Elba (as Derek Charles) has plenty of chances to tell his wife, Beyonce 'I cant act' Knowles (Mrs Charles) to tell her that Ali Larter (as Lisa Sheridan) is making movies on him,stalking him, and so forth. Of course everyone finds out and then it becomes the Beyonce ghetto acting performance of a decade. She throws him out after she discovers whats going on and refuses to believe him , even though its painfully obvious that Lisa is a nutcase. Of course there is the great scene of Beyonce leaving the house for a weekend in San Diego (with he hubby) ,turning on the home security system ,then forgetting her purse. She has to goes back home to get the purse, thus turning off the home security system when she is inside. Of course when she leaves the home for the 2nd time, predictably she amazingly somehow forgets to turn back on the home security system, leaving the house vulnerable to Lisa. I started groaning after awhile whenever I saw her. Even when she enters the house for the first time she easily gets past the babysitter who decides not to talk to Mrs Charles on the phone whom Lisa is supposed to be talking to on the phone to get past the babysitter. Lisa to the babysitter as she offers to hand the phone to her "" You want to talk to her"". The babysitters response "" No."" Give me a break !
The big payoff is of course the cat fight scene finale between Beyonce 'Mrs. Charles"" and Lisa, as is the entire film was made for that moment where Lisa is fighting in a long shirt & panties on & we get plenty of shots of her black panties (oh boy !! ) It became the Beyonce 'you want some, come get some' very reminiscent of a WWE Diva's match. I think the whole movie could have been cut down to just the fight scene...
There were a couple of other mind numbing scenes as well but I don't want to spoil it other than I will just this question - would you show the slightest compassion to a person who has stalked you, tried to kill you, steal your child , rob your home and drive you insane for 100 minutes ? If your answer is no then you will be groaning over a few choice scenes...
This movie was frustrating, un-original & the biggest piece of crap Ive seen all year..despite the suspenseful moments. It wasn't there because (1) the story has been done before and better (2)the characters were illogical about how to deal with the situation and each other

A stripped down, watered down version with nothing new added minus all the suspens of the original. I waited paitently for a twist.. maybe the gay assistant had a crush on Derek and was rejected so he planned and unleasehed the temp on Derek to destroy his perfect life. Maybe his unhappy, married friend planned this to destroy him. Maybe his boss wanted to get rid. Maybe his other coworker wanted to destroy him to get that 150mil acct....maybe ..maybe..maybe I should've skipped this movie and watched the Fatal Attraction again. Maybe they shouldn't have made this awful movie and tempt us to watch it because of Beyonce and Idris Elba make such a beautiful couple...but none of my aniticipations/prediction came through... it was just a silly instant crush. From the first moment the temp laid eye on Derek she wanted him and that was it...

3905806,1,B002CAWNDS,"A man and lady move into a new home.  The man has an important position at a big corporate job.  The husband met his wife when she was his secretary.  Later we find out that the wife does not like the man's secretary being a woman.  They made a promise that he would not have a female for the job.  So, in comes this new girl.  When she first sees the man on the elevator she kind of stares at him.  They start talking and she drops her papers.  As the man is helping her pick them up she runs her hand over his.  Seem obvious.  Well that's how the whole movie is.  The lady is at a Christmas party with the man and starts getting all over him.  He tells her to stop and she acts like she does not know why he is acting like he is.

Now, you would think that he would tell his wife.  When he calls her though, it just so happens that her sister's husband has just left her.  So after the man hears her talk about that, he decides not to tell her.  Then, he is going to tell his boss.  His friend though tells him that the lady may turn it around.  Seeing as how he met his wife after she worked for him at on point.  He still decides to tell his boss.  But before he does the boss tells him the girl has left the company.  Sound annoying?  My God is it ever.  Every time the man gets a change to stop what's happening, or to tell someone, something happens in which that does not occur.  It's like a movie made by a bunch of art house goons.  My mom and I were thinking Fatal Attraction.  But this was no wear near as good as that movie.  It was a complete waste of money.  There were also things that happened, that led to nothing.  Like at first, when the secretary would be around the man, he would always look at her legs.  Why?  He didn't like her, and never acted like he did.  Also, when he calls the cops in the end.  They take FOREVER to get there.  Somehow they get their when everything is over.  Plus, the husband gets to the house at the same time as they do.

In the end it comes down to this.  This was a really bad movie.  A complete waste of time and money.  The entire movie, this guy keeps having bad luck when it comes to letting someone know about what is going on.  The secretary try's to play a crazy deranged character, but makes you laugh at how bad she is at doing so.  Also, through the movie you will think you know what is going to happen.  I will save you the time and tell you that everything you think is going to happen, happens, exactly the way you think it will.  The move isn't even 1 hour and 45 minutes.  But it drags on and on and on.  This could have been such a good movie.  If it had not been done a thousand times before.

3905808,4,B002CAWNDS,"First of all I have to admit that even during the opening credits where there where showing scenes of Idris Alba and Beyonce Knowles moving into their fixer-upper dream house, my friend and I knew this movie was going to be very predictable. For the most part we were dead on accurate. Ali Larter's character of Lisa took all her motives and actions from 'How to stalk in a movie FOR DUMMIES' AND CLEARLY has watched Fatal Attraction and The Hand that Rocks the Cradle more than once.

However, this movie is a lot of FUN.  Beyonce seems to be the only smart one, and you tend to cheer her on for the entire film even though her main portion comes after about an hour in.  Idris Alba's character of Derek tends to make some cliche mistakes along the way, but he isn't as completely dumb as one would expect.  Also, even when some of Lisa's attemps for attention fail you think to yourself ""well. she will just try harder""...and then she does and even that in itself is entertaining.

As an entry in the genre this surely is not ground-breaking by any means and I doubt it will help any of the three actors careers, but admit it, we all just wanted to see Beyonce beat down the white chick who was tryin' to move in on her family, and that goal was accomplished.  The formulaic plot and obvious character flaws make one seem like they are shouting at a bad horror movie rather than a suspense thriller, but it also means that as an audience member, one can just enjoy the absurdity and the satisfying conclusion.

I think that even by the end of the movie Beyonce herself even knew the movie was too predictable because when the detective (played by Christine Lahti) asks what happened in the house, Beyonce says ""You know what happened in there."" I think th at line was not only for the character but also a nod to the audience also.

3905810,5,B002CAWNDS,"This is not a groundbreaking film & when tackling a genre that was so masterfully done with style and elegant grace in Unfaithful and Fatal Attraction - you really have to bring your GAME in order to make any erotic suspenseful thriller, well, an erotic suspenseful thriller!

OBSESSED, is a great fun enjoyable movie. However, the lack of an R rating really hinders it from becoming spectacular. The movie has its slow low points, but overall, it was an effective thriller with some titillating tension between the actors and actresses. Of course, Ali Later steals the film. One minute without her crazy antics on screen just feels like a life time. The director made an excellent executive decision by keeping Beyonce's screen time to a minimum. The girl has always had and will always have way too much country swagger and after all this time in Hollywood, she has yet to drop it. It's like the winner of Americas Next Top Model not being able to drop the accent in order to do an effective CoverGirl commercial. When Beyonce utters the line: That gurl mayba alotta thangs, but she aint plain - Just makes me want to cringe. There is a comma in that sentence. Please, pause Beyonce. This is a movie, not a song your singing or a track on your CD where you are trying to carry a tune. Someone please get her an acting coach!

I'll give a quick recap of the store, but will not go into full detail, as everyone else's review already has. Derek and Beyonce are a happily married couple that just moved into their new house. On his way to work he bumps into, Lisa, on the elevator and thinks that she's a model. However, she is actually the new temp in the office & it just so happens to be the same office as Derek's. Slowly but surely, she weasels her way to the assistant's desk outside his office & listens in on his calls, goes through his music collection, doesn't give him messages from his wife's missed calls, and so forth. Pretty much the madness ensues since her arrival. I have to hand it to Ali who really deserves an award because she plays crazy Lisa to a tee! Of course, all the girls and gays went crazy for the final showdown scene between the two GURLS! Everyone loves a cat fight & that was one of the major highlights of the movie. Except, it was ruined by Beyonce being ridiculous and insisting the scene be done with her wearing high heels!

Overall, this is a great thriller! I know the reviewers have been trashing this movie left and right. I don't understand what their problem is. I guess they were all looking for the next Fatal Attraction. If that's the case, this isn't it. But if you like silly over the top fun in the vein of ShowGirls, then this is the movie for you.

3905811,5,B002CAWNDS,"""Obsessed"" was a huge boxoffice hit when it first debut in theatres in April, 2009, however, most critics panned the film. Nevertheless, the movie opened at #1 for the weekend grossing an amazing 29 million dollars. As of June, 2009 the film has made nearly 70 million in ticket sales. Pop star Beyonce Knowles stars as a woman who's family is endanger when her husband encounters a sick and mentally unbalanced female office worker who becomes obsessed with him. The film is similar in theme to ""Fatal Attraction"" and ""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle"" in which a woman poses a threat to an idealic family. In this instance, however, the ideal family is African-American and the villin is a white woman. Like many films made before it the wife in this instance comes across as being more stronger than the husband, and it is she with whom the audience roots for. Yes, ""Obsessed"" is not Oscar material, but it's great fun to watch, especially the famous cat fight scene between the two female leads at the end.
 The DVD features interviews with the stars and the producers discussing the making of the film. Screenwriter David Loughrey talks about assembling the cast for ""Obsessed"" as well.
 The movie is 108 minutes long and is rated PG-13 for sexual material.",1249516800,6,1260,4.748858447488584
3905812,3,B002CAWNDS,"In the Spring of 2009, the obsessed psychopath film known as ""OBSESSED"" made its way to theaters.

The film would be directed by Steve Shill (""Dexter"", ""The Tudors"" and ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent""), featuring a screenplay by David Loughery (""Lakeview Terrace"" and ""Money Train""), music by composer James Dooley (""Pushing Daisies"") and cinematography by Ken Seng (""Quarantine"" and ""The Poker House"").

""OBSESSED"" would star Idris Elba (""The Human Contract"", ""28 Weeks Later"" and ""American Gangster""), pop singer Beyonce Knowles (""Dreamgirls"", ""The Pink Panther"", ""The Fighting Temptations"" and ""Austin Powers in Goldmember), Ali Larter (""Heroes"", ""Resident Evil: Extinction"", ""Final Destination 2' and ""House on Haunted Hill""), Jerry O'Connell (""Do Not Disturb"", ""Samantha Who?"" and ""Crossing Jordan"") and Christine Lahti (""Jack & Bobby"" and ""Chicago Hope"").

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""OBSESSED"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (with an aspect ratio of 2:40:1).  The picture quality is quite solid, with plenty of detail on the characters, Derek's office and home. Director of Photography Ken Seng, does a good job of capturing the two areas of Derek by making sure the colors are different.  Colors for Derek's office are more towards the blues while his home is more Earth tones and natural.  Blacks colors are nice and deep and overall, picture quality is quite vibrant during the outdoor scenes and colors look strikingly beautiful throughout the film.  There is adequate detail seen throughout the film and I found no digital artifact compressions.  Grain was subtle and overall, a beautiful looking film.

As for audio quality, ""OBSESSED"" is featured in English, French and Portuguese Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (and Spanish 5.1).  The film is primarily a dialogue driven film and mostly everything is center and front channel driven.  Along with the dialogue, you get composer James Dooley's haunting music playing during the intense scenes during the film.  Also, you get quite a bit of contemporary music such as Estelle's ""American Boy"" playing nice and clear.

As for subtitles, the film is presented in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""OBSESSED"" comes with a second disc which is the Digital Copy of the film.  The first disc comes with the following special features (all in High Definition):

  *
  * Playing Together Nicely - (15:37) An interview with director Steve Shill, screenwriter David Loughery and the various talents on the film.  Everyone talks about what they enjoyed about doing this film and working with each other.
  * Girl Fight - (11:13) The film had to have a major climax and that is the confrontation between Sharon and Lisa and the ""Girl Fight"".  This was a scene that had to be planned quite well and look effective.  So, through this featurette, we get to learn how this major scene was shot.
  * Obsessed: Dressed to Kill - (9:30) Interview with John Gary Steel and Ken Seng about the look of the film.  And an interview with Maya Lieberman, the costume designer and why she selected certain clothing for the main talents.

I do wish there was a commentary track because I wanted to hear if there were changes from the actual screenplay and the final cut.  Also, with the various scenes of the city, if a lot of it was stock video. It would have been a nice addition to hear from the director, screenwriter or cinematographer.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""OBSESSED"" was a film that didn't do that well when it came to critic reviews but in the box office, the film debuted at #1 for the weekend of April 2009 and has grossed over $71 million worldwide.

The film is essentially a springboard for Beyonce Knowles, the actress.  We have seen her in various comedy and dramatic films but this is the first time we would see her partake in film that required action scenes on her part.  On one hand, Beyonce fans can appreciate her growing acting range.  But on the other hand, part of the problem with ""OBSESSED"" is that it will be compared to a classic psychopath film ""FATAL ATTRACTION"".

Where ""FATAL ATTRACTION"" lays groundwork of the stages of how a woman scorned through a one night stand, becomes obsessed and ends up doing the unthinkable.  ""OBSESSED"" is a film that is much harder to accept.  We don't know why Lisa is so obsessed over Derek.  Before they started working together, she's already has some attraction to him.  I thought that there would be groundwork of why this woman is sick and obsessed but we never find out.  It's just a woman obsessed with a man and doing whatever it takes to be with him.

The other problem is that the film focuses on Derek for the majority of the film.  Derek working with Lisa and having to deal with the situations that arise from Lisa's lies.  But during final half of the film, it seems that Derek becomes less important and a switch is made from being a main character and all of a sudden a supportive role, giving Beyonce the main lead to showcase her acting through action and becomes more of a film about a wife who will not stand for this psychopath to disrupt her family.  Because of this, the pacing of the film suffers and although it does work, it's not as effective.  But despite the plot falling short, for the most part, Idris Elba, Ali Larter and Beyonce Knowles do a fine job.

In the end, ""OBSESSED"" is a slick film that will unfortunately be compared to ""FATAL ATTRACTION"" but it's best to move far from the comparisons and enjoy the film for what it is.",1249430400,2,5480,4.839784946236559
3905813,3,B002CAWNDS,I knew Idris Elba was doomed when he was on the elevator from the start.  He should've listened to that little voice that said take the stairs.  It didn't help that he rubbed her shoulder in the lunch room though. This Movie was like a watered down Fatal Attraction and Swimfan even holds its own but this movie left alot to be desired.  It must've sucked to be Idris Elba because he was raped by Ali Larter (Lisa) while on drugs while the other guys cheated on their women.  Man thats just sick!  Ali Larter is just the infatuated bully who makes Idris wish he picked the swing instead of the slide to hang at because she shows up everywhere she is not expected to be even in his car with revealing clothes. The final fight scene with Beyonce and Ali was epic!,1249430400,,761,4.293706293706293
3905814,4,B002CAWNDS,"Many of the reviewers here have focused upon the performance of Beyonce Knowles in this updated version of ""Fatal Attraction.""  For my money, her performance certainly shows that she can certainly do more than just sing and dance.  Was she believable?  Yes.  Was her performance in any way embarrassing?  Not in the least.  Should Meryl Streep start to worry about the competition?  No, but then again the role that Beyonce was required to play was one that could have been played effectively by any number of young performers in today's entertainment universe, with the possible exception of Mariah Carey.  Hopefully having her name on the marquee will draw in viewers who otherwise might have missed this exciting psychological thriller.

Fans of ""The Wire"" and ""The Office"" are already familiar with the talents of Idris Elba.  The twist in this film that makes it different from ""Fatal Attraction"" is that Elba's husband character is entirely innocent of any extra-marital activity, unlike Michael Douglas in ""Fatal Attraction.""  Even though the Douglas character did not deserve the troubles that he faced in that earlier film, you always knew that he was responsible for them due to his choice to be unfaithful to his wife.

 In this film, to his credit Idris Elba, rejects the advances of the persistent Ali Larter's character on numerous occasions.  Sure, he could have told his wife about the initial advances of the obsessed temp and perhaps saved himself some of the strains to his marriage but such would have done nothing to affect the behavior of the obsessed woman who was not going to give up her quest.  Elba's husband was simply in an impossible situation.  Telling his wife, co-workers, and even the police was not going to get him out of the box that he found himself in.

I found Ali Larter's performance to be even more frightening than Glenn Close's in ""Fatal Attraction"" since unlike Close, she exhibited no outward visible manifestations of a mental illness.  A casual observer in the office might have noticed her interest and attraction to the Elba character, but who would have suspected the sort of obsessive behavior that she was capable of once she was outside of the office environment?

Although the film's ultimate conclusion was fairly predictable, it was exciting and satisfying.  If you enjoy films like ""Fatal Attraction,"" ""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,"" ""Basic Instinct"" and ""Disclosure,"" watching this one would be a great way to spend an evening.",1249430400,4,2489,4.995145631067961

3905816,4,B002CAWNDS,"But it's still a very good feature. This can be a tool used in teaching about sexual harassment. I think it's also a film that can be used in marriage counselling classes as you really feel sorry for the husband, and the fact that he has to go through the come-ons by the temp, but he should've told his wife about it in the first place. I found this to be the dark side of going to work. I have come to the conclusion that work isn't a social outlet, and it doesn't pay to find out how the other co-workers are doing. It's also becoming where you have to keep yourself...just keep saying you're F.I.N.E. you can fill in the blanks. I honestly don't know if work was supposedly at one time a way of making friends, or not....who knows we may have been all wrong about socializing with our co-workers, giving hugs, dating each other. If that wasn't what we were supposed to do at work then we've put each other in danger. I don't know the answers to this. It's just a crying shame that something as innocent as a hug can be construed as a sexual come-on, and that some people are ignored, not part of the team, or part of the family while others are fortunate to have friends at work, possibly soul mates. Me being one of the many who are ignored sympathize with all the others out there who are ignored. The ones who get in trouble for being vulnerable, and feel like they don't just belong. I feel for each and everyone of you I wish I could say that your co-workers will like you, and everything will be fine...well it may very well be if you find the right place to work to have social outlets. However, don't do what was done in this feature....it may cost you your life. I know I've said I would rather work out of my house instead of going to work anymore, but I may not have that option, so until I find that job where I feel like I belong, and can have friends at work...possibly a soul mate I will just have to watch out, and be careful with who I want to be friends with at work.",1249257600,,1989,4.1688311688311686
