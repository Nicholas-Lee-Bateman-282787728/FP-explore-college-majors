8443032,1,B000228TC2,Doesn't work like the other I spy DVD's we have.  It only gives you a few seconds to look at the picture and try to find the item.  Then it automatically moves on.,1515283200,,163,3.909090909090909
8443033,5,B000228TC2,The grandkids really like this video and if it makes them happy then it makes us all happy. We take it camping to watch at night in the fifth wheel to settle them down.,1369872000,,168,3.9705882352941178
