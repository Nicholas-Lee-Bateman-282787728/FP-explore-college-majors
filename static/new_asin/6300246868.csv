275751,4,6300246868,"I just recently saw ""The Desert Fox"" and I was suprised at how good it was usually films done in the 50s about real people make them out to be either super heroes or terrible villians. This film really showed the human side of Rommel and his family. I would like to see this film released on DVD someday.",1043193600,2,304,4.169491525423729
275752,5,6300246868,"James Mason is stellar as Field Marshal Rommel. You'll witness his military defeat in Africa and return to Hitler's Germany. This film is a great story about a great general.--Diana Dell, author, ""A Saigon Party: And Other Vietnam War Short Stories.""",990576000,4,250,5.121951219512195
275753,4,6300246868,"Originally copyright by 20th Century Fox Film Corporation, in 1951, only six years after the end of World War Two, this black and white film gives a  shallow overview of the last years of German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel:  the Desert Fox.
Once you get past the opening rather stagey scenes, of  British commandos raiding a German headquarters building in north Africa,  hoping to kill the Desert Fox in his lair, the rest of the film is carried  along guite well, by the great performance of James Mason, as Rommel. This  performance is the only reason I rated this film as four stars, without  Mason I would have been disapointed.
Other members of the cast do fine  jobs too, notably Cedric Hardwicke and Leo G. Carroll. One can find good  entertainment based on real events.
D-Day: the invasion of Normandy, is  a highlight of this film. There are several minutes of what appears to be  genuine newsreel footage of the storming of the beaches: the ships off  shore, the guns, the planes, brave men falling. It's all very real at this  point.
""The Desert Fox"" was made in an era when the directors,  producers, and the Hollywood Establishment in general, were less preachy,  and less likely to distort the truth in order to promote a social agenda.  That is a big plus for this film.
On the down side: the film starts off  with several undisclosed advertisements for other videos, of like kind, by  Fox. This is borderline dishonest, as consumers have paid for entertainment  and expect it to be commercial free. At the very least, the ads should be  disclosed, before anyone makes a purchaseing decision.
All in all,  ""The Desert Fox"" is good entertainment and deserves a look.",964310400,64,1680,4.724137931034483

275811,5,6300246868,"This film was made in 1951, a few short years after the end of WWII and although in B & W, is actually quite well done.  James Mason was believable as Erwin Rommel, and the rest of the cast also played their parts very well.  One thing that I did not like would be that the actors all had British accents instead of German, which seemed quite out of place, but might have been normal for Twentieth Centtury Fox at the time, and, after all, the actors and acrtresses all have English names like Cedric Hardwicke.

275812,3,6300246868,"Should have been titled ""The Fall of the Desert Fox"" because there is no hint of the tactics and leadership that made him the most famous general in the German army.

275813,4,6300246868,"An interesting story indeed but there's just something about listening to a British accent when watching Germans. It's hard to get into the focus of the film when I am so distracted by the accents - and I love James Mason. Jessica Tandy is good as his wife but the picture itself just did not live up to the expectation. Apparently the film caused a critical stir in 1951 by providing a tense ten-minute dramatic sequence before the opening credits but by today's standards, it wasn't that interesting.",1484697600,,502,4.715909090909091

It's focus was not on the desert exploits of Erwin Rommel, but rather on his subsequent role in France and in the plot to overthrow Hitler. His dialogues with Gerd von Rudstendt were especially interesting (and historically accurate) as well as his dramatic talk with the two officers sent by Hitler to offer him the chance to commit suicide.

276034,4,6300246868,"Since boyhood this film commanded my attention, that is, as long as I had seen ""The Desert Rats,"" with Richard Burton in the same six-month period. Knowing what I know about the German tank corps with the Enigma code-breaking, one expects more than this film ""Desert Fox"" reveals about the genius of this legendary tank commander. To the point, there is less action here than you expect after the opening British commando raid on Rommel's headquarters. The Enigma achievement was still top secret to the general public although Desmond Young (Rommel's best biographer) gets to play a bit part. However, the character, courage, humanity and honor of Rommel is exhibited every frame James Mason fills. Although this film of the 50s does not examine in detail the battlefield exploits of Rommel it depicts the mettle of its generals under tremendous stress straining to defeat its enemy while avoiding political exile or worse. This film depicts probably the last third of a Rommel biography with Germany at its peak with an expansive empire but scarce resources to sustain itself, frustrated by unexplained missed opportunities that call for retreat. Rommel (James Mason) begins a chess game with his superiors in Berlin including the increasingly mad man, Hitler (Luther Adler) that strains Rommel's loyalty. Suffering a near breakdown, Rommel is called back to concentrate on the french defenses. You meet his devoted wife (Jessica Tandy) and his son (William Reynolds aka FBI Story) who steel his resolve to participate in an attempt to silence the mad man. When the plot of generals fails, Rommel pays the ultimate price for endorsing the attempt although an inactive participant. The scene in his home surrounded by his family when he pretends he is going away on business for his son, while to his wife he communicates otherwise, telling her it will be alright, be brave, is one that can only be brought off by a master actor like Mason. Other German leaders, General Von Runstedt, played by Leo G. Carroll and Cedric Hardwick playing a professor are convincing conscientious Germans doing right who depict the admirable philosophical qualities of the German mind. Here clearly, winning wasn't everything. We know the outcome of the war, but of the German participants Rommel represents the highest integrity. Rather than a study of combat, this is a study in character, a nobility axis or allies can admire.",1418428800,2,2412,5.07808564231738

The impressive cast includes Cedric Hardwicke, Jessica Tandy, Everett Sloane, Leo G. Carroll, George Macready, Richard Boone and Luther Adler. The underrated composer Daniele Amfitheatrof (MAJOR DUNDEE) came up with a moving score. That combined with Norbert Brodine excellent cinematography make for a very good film.

276070,4,6300246868,"The Desert Fox, 1951 film

It begins in 1941 when a British submarine surfaces to land British Commandos behind enemy lines in Libya. Their purpose is to kill one man. They attack a house using machine guns and grenades. Did they get him? Rommel was seen as a symbol and must be eliminated. Fighting goes on in 1942. Two years later Rommel was dead while the war continued. After the war ended Lt. Col. Desmond Young investigated Rommels death and wrote a book that was adapted to this movie. Young had been a POW in 1942 and met Rommel. The German forces are short of petrol and other supplies. Rommel orders changes in tactics to meet an attack by Montgomery. They show actual battle scenes between armor and artillery. [Stock movies from the war.] The German forces are being pushed back, but they are told to stand and fight to the last man. Rommel makes his decision.

[Are those who know local conditions the best judge of tactics?] Rommel was returned to Germany for health reasons. The war is not going well, the Afrika Korps was abandoned. Can they win? They have no choice as long as AH is in power. Abdication? What if AH turns against Rommel? Stollen shakes a tail. In 1943 Rommel inspects the German defenses against any invasion and reports to Von Rundstedt. There are many places for a successful invasion. What can be done? Rommel is warned to be on his guard. Rommel expects an attack in the spring. Dr. Stollen visits him; is his house wired? Stollen mentions the names of men who plan to remove Hitler. Rommel isn't interested; he cant decide. In June 1944 the Allies invaded Normandy. [This, like the Battle of Kursk, marked the beginning of the end.] Von Rundstedt analyzes Hitlers decisions; his astrologer tells him what to do. [Who controls them?] Is it much too late?

Rommel gets a note from Stulpnagel. Three men were captured and will be made to talk; they must act at once. Rommel calls Keitel to meet Hitler tomorrow. There is a crisis. Hitler explains his plans - in two weeks! The V-weapon will revolutionize warfare, AH says. On July17 airplanes shot up a German staff car. On July 20 a bomb exploded in Hitlers bunker, but he survived! Five thousand suspects were rounded up. Rommel is summoned to Berlin to talk about another command. He is told about a charge of Treason. Deathbed confessions? The verdict is pre-ordained, Rommel must resolve this himself. His family would be safe. It is either poison of the garrott. Rommel says goodbye to his wife; he is leaving and won't return. There are final comments on Rommel by Winston Churchill.

This 1951 movie was criticized as being too sympathetic to a Nazi general. Is it? Does it gloss over the evils of Nazi Fascism? It does take a limited view of the war, like some history books that discuss one facet of the war. There was one book that said adding a bottle of gasoline to the bomb would have created a fire and asphyxiate all inside a closed room. But a bottle of liquid would gurgle and arouse suspicion. Would the removal of Hitler have ended the war sooner? Could Germany have switched sides and ally with Britain and America? I don't think so. Holding out this promise was a way to create division among the Germans, even if some of the Allies would have preferred Hitler before the war. Allies read the coded messages of the Germans and knew most of what was going on. Not to mention Der Rote Kapelle.",1412812800,,3399,4.594728171334432

A, Did it keep my attention? Answer: Yes
B, Did I like the actors/acting, lines/dialogue, action scenes? Answer: For the most part, yes
C, Is it just another ""Rah, rah!"" film of the period? Meaning, is it mostly how we 'supposedly' won the war? Propaganda BS movie? Answer, not really and it told the story, at least for the most part in a short way, about Rommel. It wasn't really in depth and it didn't really tell about his thinking and actual trials of being a general in Hitler's war machine.

Luther Adler, a Jewish American actor does a passable job as Hitler. It is sort of a dramatic documentary and the Author of the Book, Lt. Col.

A film made today would be more violent and harsh, but this one seems to capture the man that Rommel was and even though I knew the outcome, I found myself rooting for him to overcome the odds. His son Manfred just passed away in 2013 so the German government must have honored their promise to Rommel that his family would not be harmed, because of course, what guarantee did he have?I have probably seen this movie 3 times over the years, and probably don't need to see it again, but it has peaked my interest in the topic and I will probably search out a more current rendition to see how that portrays Rommel.

It is called - The Desert Fox - yet it spend merely 15 minutes depicting Rommel in the desert - that too in the end when he had been beaten back into Tunisia. The movie is really about Rommel's role in the conspiracy that led to the 20th July Bomb Plot against Hitler.

James Mason (Plays Rommel) in is early life was a poor actor - nothing like the villain, I had come to expect from his role in ""North by Northwest"". Acting in this movie was also generally very poor. A very bad screenplay. Not a smoothly flowing story.

It's a little nostalgia for those Saturday afternoon war movies we watched as kids.",1396137600,,404,4.811594202898551
276180,4,6300246868,"I liked this 1951 war film telling the story of one of most legendary WWII great commanders - Field Marshal Erwin Rommel.

This film is in large part based on Rommel's biography written soon after war by a British officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Desmond Young, who actually briefly met Rommel during the war, after being taken prisoner by Germans in North Africa. Young never lost from sight that Rommel was an enemy of his country and even of ""the whole civilisation"", as he served the Nazi regime, but he nevertheless felt some respect to this mighty foe. He was also particularly intrigued by the mysterious (at least they were mysterious immediately after war) circumstances of Rommel's death. Combining interviews with German and British officers and soldiers with captured documentation and his own memories of Desert War he wrote an ultimately quite flattering biography of ""Desert Fox"", which became an instant bestseller - but also subject of controversy, as many deemed Young's vision as TOO flattering.

The general tone of this film follows the line of Desmond Young's book, showing Rommel as a soldier serving Germany rather than Nazism. He is shown as an extremely dangerous and cunning enemy, but one who avoids atrocities and cruelty. His fair treatment of allied war prisoners impressed Desmond Young already during war and this point is stressed again both in book and in film. In that point Rommel was lucky that he didn't fight even one day on Eastern front, where neither Germans not Russians bothered to observe such niceties...

The film mostly sticks to the real history and clearly shows how much British government and especially Churchill appreciated Rommel's skills - going as far as targeting him for assasination (the very real operation ""Flipper"" on 17/18 November 1941). It also shows rather well Rommel's progressive disaffection with Hitler in 1943 and 1944. The last moments of Rommel's life are also portrayed very, very well indeed.

The one slightly weaker thing is the way in which was shown Rommel's contacts with conspirators who planned to kill Hitler. Contrary to what we are shown in the film, there is absolutely no proof that Rommel at any moment agreed to join the conspiracy - in fact he refused to commit himself in one or other way and he certainly DIDN'T try to recruit von Rundstedt! On another hand he didn't inform the Gestapo about the existence of conspiracy and the fact that he was contacted - which was already an act of  treason and in Nazi Germany that signified death!

The film also avoids to show that from 1939 to beginning of 1943 Rommel was in EXCELLENT terms with Hitler, which means he was still Fuhrer's pet at a time when trains were carrying millions of heads of human chattel to concentration camps - and many of those prisoners, including women and children, were in fact destined to be exterminated in gas chambers...

Nevertheless, all those points notwithstanding, Rommel WAS a great commander, feared but respected by allied oponents and he was ultimately destroyed by the very monster he so long and so well served - and for all that he certainly deserved to have at least one flattering biography written and at least one good film made about him. And this film is good, with James Mason portraying Rommel simply with perfection.

I liked this film and I will keep the DVD for future viewings. Enjoy!",1395273600,,3376,4.92091388400703

276231,4,6300246868,"Erwin Rommel was more than an exceptional commander on the battlefield.  As a lifelong professional soldier he was born into the middle class and enjoyed the early Provincial German life......as a young Infantry Cadet-officer , according to Biographer Brigadier General Desmond Young,  ""whenever Rommel came under fire he stood out as the perfect fighting animal--cold, ruthless, untiring, quick of decision,and incredibly brave"".  These characteristics remained true of Rommel until his death (named by a turncoat as a possible collaborator in an assination attempt of Hitler).  He gained the respect of his enemies as well as his men.  James Mason was the perfect choice to portray this Historical figure and did so with the aforementioned traits of a heroic adversary.  His exploits in battle won him the ultimate promotiom of ""Field Marshal"".  As a young boy I had watched this movie on Saturday TV in the late 50's and never forgot the gallant image of this consummate warrior.  I recently purchased the DVD and reacquainted myself with the ""Desert Fox"".  The film does reasonable justice to him; although the scenes with his wife and son seem a bit brief they succeeded in reflecting a man with strong family values.  Rommel's undying distaste for ""politicians"" brought about his premature demise.  The film dealt realistically with his struggles with trying to maintain military objective in a losing cause; there is no question his allegiance was to the country he loved however the political temperament (and Military fervor stirred by the fanatical Hitler and some of his generals) became the slow poison that would inevitably end his life.  I would recommend this great film to anyone who desires to know more of History, moreover the life of an incredible Military genius.",1390521600,,1784,5.177700348432055

It was interesting to me to see her act as a young woman, since I know her mainly as her role in Driving Miss Daisy. The movie was made 6 years after the end of WWII, so Rommel was portrayed less as a villain and more as a ""reasonable"" German militarist working against Hitler trying to end the war. I thought the parting of Rommel & his wife at the end when the Nazis are taking him away to die is sort of cheesy---""goodbye darling""---I don't think this would be my reaction if I knew my husband was about to swallow poison. Other reviewers on Amazon gave it higher ratings. I would recommend Where Eagles Dare, The Great Escape, or the iconic Casa Blanca as better WWII movies.",1389398400,,773,4.301369863013699

276395,4,6300246868,"Most WWII flicks center around famous folk or incidents as they directly relate to the action of the war. ""Desert Fox"" veers away from the format in that it deals with Rommel more off the battle field and in the later days of his life.

Here's the scoop. Rommel is the big hero for the Nazis in North Africa. The Allies have not landed in Europe yet so they send him to the beaches of France to check up on defenses. He performs some other tasks but it's becoming plain that the Germans aren't faring too well and it's Hitler's fault. Word starts that he should be put to pasture. The conspiracy widens, fails, and a lot of Nazis lose their lives.

This was a surprise. It's more of a drama than a war movie. They do cut some archival footage of the war into the filmed parts but this acts as more of an overview to the historical aspects. This deals mostly with Rommel. Who he was. The type of guy he was and how the conspiracy to assassinate Hitler started and ultimately grew to a bomb plot that only wounded him. They made Rommel out to be a very upstanding guy with a great wife and fine son. A gentleman who began to understand that Hitler wasn't all he was cracked up to be. It surprisingly touches on Hitler's dabbling in the occult which is something I thought wasn't well understood when this film was made. One thing that irked me a bit was that many of the main and secondary characters spoke with British or American accents. Very few German accents are to be found.

The production values are decent and the script deals with various areas of protocol and procedure not found in similar movies. They give it a ring of authenticity. Not as exciting as other movies of that era it still is well worth watching.",1330646400,2,1722,4.358255451713395

Consequently, a modern audience really needs more of a background about WW2 to appreciate what they are seeing here.  Rommel gave tacit approval to the attempt on Hitler's life, and was arranging with other military leaders to take control of the situation after his death, in the hope of holding a firm line.  But one of the conspirators does point out the risk that with Hitler, the Allies might not even stop at a truce before invading Germany itself, because of everything else that had already happened under his regime.

It would require a brave studio, a brilliant script and a serious leading actor.
Fortunately, this thoughtful, interesting biopic has them all.

The first time we see the main character, he is a good distance away, deliberately
so, in the North African desert. Is this not the beauty of great acting? Even with this
distance shot, it is immediately apparent, simply from stance. `That's Rommel'.
Not James Mason, you understand, but Rommel.

We follow the Field Marshall from battle to his home, from the office of his supreme leader to the shores of France. Finally, to his suicide - it's that or face trial by Hitler for treason. And he is sympathetically played. There are some interesting super imposition shots of the actors over genuine footage, and of course, sets, props costumes etc are all totally authentic. The film looks and sounds great.

Jessica Tandy is totally convincing as Mrs Rommel and the entire cast is high quality.

There are even some laughs.
Particularly considering when this film was made, it is human, occasionally charming and
a thoroughly enjoyable watch.

It really portrays how disenchanted the German generals were getting at Hitler, and starts telling of all the plots to eliminate one of the most heinous war criminals to date...Adolph Hitler. I wish the movie did more to go into detail of Rommel's career, but I think the producer's or script writer jumps around and hits the highlights of the frustration Rommel was going through. It's as if Rommel is portrayed as a man trapped in his situation and must decide the fate of his Germany to join the resistance against Hitler or ignore it.

276468,4,6300246868,"Field Marshall Erwin Rommell has been portrayed in dozens of films, but never better than in the 1951 film starring James Mason. The wonderful supporting cast features Cedric Hardwicke, Leo G. Carrol, Eduard Franz, Everett Sloan, George Macready, Richard Boone, and Jessica Tandy as Rommel's wife and Luther Adler as Hitler.

James Mason appeared in more than 100 films. He was nominated for an Oscar 3 times (""A Star is Born"", ""Georgy Girl"", ""The Verdict"") and won a Golden Globe for ""A Star is Born"" (1954). He is perhaps best known for his role in Stanley Kubrik's ""Lolita"" (1962) for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe. Other  memorable roles include Brutus in ""Julius Caesar"" (1953) and Captain Nemo in ""20,000 leagues Under the Sea"" (1954). Mason identified himself as a ""fairly desirable sort of character actor"" and claimed that the ""public never knows what it's getting by way of a Mason performance"" - true to a point, except audiences knew they would always get a great performance, which is what he gives in this film.

Other actors who played Rommel include Erich von Stroheim (""Five Graves to Cairo"", 1943), Werner Hinz (""The Longest Day"", 1962), Christopher Plummer (""Night of the Generals"", 1966), Wolfgang Preiss (""Raid on Rommel"", 1971), Karl Michael Vogler (""Patton""), and Helmut Griem (The Plot to Kill Hitler"", 1990).  James Mason played him again in ""The Desert Rats"" (1953) with Richard Burton (FWIW - Burton starred years later in ""Raid on Rommel"" (1971) directed by Henry Hathaway who directed ""The Desert Fox"")

Cedric Hardwicke plays an old friend of Rommel who tries to persuade him to join the plot against Hitler (played by Luther Adler). Sir Cedric's strong voice and stony appearance graced nearly 100 films. He played the evil bishop in ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (1939), Dr. Livingstone in ""Stanley and Livingstone"" (1939), and King Arthur in ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"" (1949). I remember him best as the Pharaoh in ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956).

Eduard Franz is another conspirator, although he is on screen only for a minute or so. Franz appeared in more than 50 films and made a successful transition to TV in the 50s. He had recurring roles as Gregorio  in ""Zorro"" (1958) and as the Psychiatrist Dr. Raymer in ""Breaking Point"" (1963-4). Franz was extremely versatile and could play an Indian (""White Feather""), a Mexican (""Zorro""), a German (""Desert Fox""), etc. I remember him best as Dr. Stern in ""The Thing"" (1951).

Luther Adler (a Jew) plays Hitler. Adler was a director as well as an actor on Broadway, and his sister Stella was well known as an acting coach and with her and Lee Strasberg they formed the Group Theatre Acting Company where people like Elia Kazan, John Garfield, Lee J Cobb, Franchot Tone, and others started.  In fact, one of the first jobs Marlon Brando ever got was in a play directed by Luther called ""A Flag is Born"" (1946). Adler made only a few dozen films as he was busy in his other endeavors. He had memorable roles in ""DOA"" (1950), ""The Last Angry Man"" (1959), and ""Absence of Malice"" (1981).

Adler's portrayal of Hitler is OK. Dozens of actors have played Hitler - Charlie Chaplin, Alec Guiness, Bruno Ganz, Ian McKellan, Anthony Hopkins, Ludwig Haas, Michael Sheard, Noah Taylor, etc. Bobby Watson played him nearly a dozen times. My favorite is Bruno Ganz in ""Downfall"" (2004).

Everett Sloane appeared in more than 100 films and TV programs and was part of the Orson Welles stock company. In fact his film debut was in ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) as Mr. Bernstein and he appeared in several Welles films like ""Journey into Fear"" (1943) and ""Lady from Shanghai"" (1948). He transitioned to TV in the early 50s. Sloane has a small part as a German General who offers Rommel the choice of suicide or death.

Jessica Tandy plays Rommel's wife. Tandy was a marvelous actress who appeared in a mere 50 films but earned an Oscar and a Golden Globe  (""Driving Miss Daisy"", 1989), 2 Tonys (""Streetcar Named Desire"", 1947, ""The Gin Games"", 1978) and an Emmy ""Foxfire"", 1987) as well as numerous nominations for films such as ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" (1991) and ""Cocoon"" (1985). She has one of the longest careers on record, having started in 1932 (""The Indiscretions of Eve"") and worked continuously through 1994 (""Camilla""). She claimed to be ""most comfortable on the stage"".

Richard Boone appears throughout the film as an aide to Rommel, but he almost never speaks. Boone was a terrific actor, perhaps best known for his TV western series ""Have Gun Will Travel"" (1957 - 1963), but he was a busy actor and appeared in nearly 50 films, 3 of them with Wayne (""The Alamo"" i1960, ""The Shootist"" in 1976, ""Big Jake"" in 1971). Boone was a graduate of the Actor's Studio.

George Macready appears briefly in the beginning. He was an excellent character actor, appeared in nearly 100 films and was active on TV. He was often cast as an aristocratic villain because of his cultured accent, and the scar on his face was often used to this advantage. He had memorable roles in ""Gilda"" (1946), ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" (1970), and ""Seven Days in May"" (1964), but my personal favorite was his role as French General Mireau in ""Paths of Glory"" (1957)

Henry Hathaway directs this film and also directed ""Raid on Rommel"" (1971). Hathaway is best known for his westerns, for which he won 3 Western Heritage Awards - ""How the West Was Won"" (1962), ""The Sons of Katie Elder"" (1965), and ""True Grit"" (1969). He was nominated for an Oscar for ""Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" (1935). Hathaway worked in a number of genres, and his memorable films include ""The House of 92nd Street"" (1945), ""13 Rue Madeline"" (1947), ""Call Northside 777"" (1948), and ""Niagara"" (1953) Hathaway claimed ""To be a good director you've got to be a bastard. I'm a bastard and I know it."" Indeed, Mason commented in his autobiography that Hathaway had been difficult to work with.

The film is written and produced by Nunnaly Johnson. Johnson was a creative genius. He was twice nominated for an Oscar for best screenplay (""The Grapes of Wrath"" and ""Holy Matrimony"") and DGA and Cannes nominated for ""Man in the Gray Flannel Suit"" (1956). His other memorable works include ""The Dirty Dozen"" (1967), ""The Three Faces of Eve"" (1957), ""How to Marry a Millionaire"" (1953), ""The Woman in the Window"" (1944), ""Tobacco Road"" (1941), and ""Jesse James"" (1939).

Coming so close to the end of WW 2, the film was criticized as being too gentle on the Germans.  Bosley Crowther said the film had ""a strange disregard for the principles and the sensibilities of those who suffered and bled in the cause of defeating German aggression."" On the other hand, the coming Cold War meant that Germany and the US would combine against the Russians, so a film about a ""good German"" was politically correct, even if a little early. Notwithstanding this, the film tends to ignore Rommel's early career in which he was an ardent Nazi.

Another criticism of the film is that it uses stock footage from other films, and most of the action with Rommel is behind the scenes rather than on the battlefield, where he was a legend.

When viewed as a character study, this is a great film with a wonderful supporting cast, although they are not used to their full advantage. It's not really a war film, and action fans will be disappointed.",1274400000,,7340,4.7957244655581945

276501,4,6300246868,There's something to be said about older movies. Very little political correctness!!! It's a great story about Rommel and the situation he found himself in.,1265587200,,156,5.28
276502,3,6300246868,"The Desert Fox is a loose biography of one of Germany's most admired strategist by Allies and Axis alike, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, convincingly portrayed by James Mason, and done in a narrator format by a British officer, who after the war decides to follow up on the exploits of Rommel and find out what really happened in his life.

The film was made in 1951, not that many years after WWII, and I was afraid that this might be a propaganda film or some kind of finger-pointing at the Germans, but it was not.  In fact, the whole film, though very heavy-handed with the original battle footage, did a fair job of portraying Rommel, what went through his mind during his frustrating struggle with Hitler countermanding and watching his every move, and Rommel's eventual contribution to a conspiracy to overthrow Hitler and create a separate peace with Eisenhower.

The film attempts to take us through the War, beginning in November 1941, only a month before Pearl Harbor.  British commandos come on shore from a sub, (not told where, exactly) and kill several jerries in a non-descript house.  They easily overpower the Germans there, but take on wounded themselves.  Finally one Brit lies on the ground about to die, and asks ""Did we get him?"" and a German officer says, ""Are you serious, Englishman?""

Rommel ran the Afrika Corps and was as sly and conniving as ever in his fight against British commander Montgomery.  The problem is, the film barely showed ANY desert fighting and did little to show any kind of real strategy.  Rather, the film pointed out, in various places throughout, that Rommel was angry with having his orders countermanded by Berlin, and at one point rants about the pencil-pushing generals in Berlin and wishes Hitler would slaughter them all.

However, through the machinations of Dr. Strolin (played like an English teacher rather than a conspirator by Cecil Hardwick) Rommel becomes convinced that getting rid of Hitler is the way to go.

Rommel confides in von Rundstedt, a field commander who is helping to defend against a planned Allied invasion (which as you may know the Germans were not planning on the Allies storming Normandy but knew there was going to be an invasion) that Hitler really doesn't know what he's talking about.

Rommel even meets Hitler in one scene.  The actor who played Hitler was very unconvincing.  In fact, it's a real shame that such a superb character actor like Mason had to play it straight with a hammy, over-loud Hitler.  Yuk.

Even with all this, Rommel feels there's a way to not assassinate the guy but to take over the government and offer peace to Eisenhower.  Rommel is later strafed by the bullets of an Allied plane and is hospitalized.

A replay of the attempt on Hitler's life with von Stofenberg placing the bomb.  Well, this aspect was interesting though I found the actor who played von Stofenberg kinda walked on and walked off -- no personality, and he is sure no Tom Cruise (ala' Valkerie)&nbsp;].

Overall, though Mason's acting was superb, Leo G. Carroll was not totally convincing as a German field marshal (von Rundstedt).  In fact, I could not help but see Leo as ""Topper"" or the TV series Man from UNCLE.  A bit of miscasting there!

Way too much battle footage, almost like they didn't have enough story to tell.  More on the Afrika Corps. battles and strategy would have been more enjoyable and entertaining.  So despite the somewhat disjointed script, Mason was excellent and convincing.

The movie would have been better if it were lighter on the original war footage and heavier on what was going on in Rommel's mind and more strategies and tactics on his battles which was not touched on enough.  Some tender moments with his family but a romance story this ain't.

Why no German accents or language?  Well, the film was made in 1951, the war a bit too fresh to get that realistic.

I may watch Mason in The Desert Rats (see below).  There he reprises his role as Rommel and fights against Richard Burton.  Uh-oh!

My DVD did not have any special features except for some 20th Century Fox war trailers.

276505,3,6300246868,"It must have taken considerable courage for Hollywood to present the war years of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel just six years after cessation of hostilities. What is of surprise is the type of war picture it was. Rather than unfold another of the wildly popular shoot-em-ups then current, director Henry Hathaway chose a more daring tack: to film a character study of an officer who was widely considered to be one of the best tank generals of all time, even if he fought for Germany. James Mason is Rommel, a man whose strong sense of duty shines clearly in every scene.  Mason speaks in his normal resonant English accent, with no one speaking German. Mason's Rommel is a general staff officer who begins the war with a few reservations about the competency of Hitler.  He keeps these to himself until a rapidly deteriorating and collapsing front forces him to make a choice that afflicted many others in the Wehrmacht. Should he obey the orders of his Fuhrer without question and risk the annihilation of Germany or should he act to remove Hitler in a coup.  The recent film VALKYRIE has Tom Cruise as Colonel Klaus Von Stauffenberg face the same brutal choice, with both officers in each film reaching the same conclusion: namely that Hitler had to go.

Part of the problem I had with THE DESERT FOX lies in director Hathaway's desire to have it both ways--a film that is an actioner and one that explores the inner thoughts of one man at a critical juncture in a world war. The movie begins with a British raid on a chalet in Nazi-occupied Europe for the sole purpose of assassinating Rommel.  There is considerable gunfire and explosions, but after that the audience views the late career of Rommel through the lens of stock footage of war scenes and vignettes that lead Rommel inexorably to conclude that the only way to salvage Germany was to arrest Hitler and the entire leadership of the Nazi party.  Rommel is briefly shown as the commander of the Afrika Corps in 1942, but his appearance is limited mostly to scenes in which he grouses about the idiocy of obeying Hitler's orders to fight to the last man and the last bullet. Fast forward two years to D-Day. Mason shares some revelatory scenes with Leo G. Carroll as Field Marshal von Rundshtet as both similarly realize that the fate of their country lies in the incompetent hands of a corporal with no concept of tactics and leadership. The ending is no surprise to any student of military history. What Mason adds to factual history is his portrayal of a man who must battle his conscience with the same ferocity that he does with the Americans and English.  The scenes with Jessica Tandy as his wife are deeply touching as both face a crunching reality of Hitler's vengeance that reaches out to ensnare even a decorated Field Marshal. THE DESERT FOX is a war film that focuses less on the fox and more on the common sense decency of a general who swore allegiance to one who had none at all.",1243641600,,2956,4.629770992366412

A true story, but not one we American's are as familiar as the Brits, since we didn't really have a roll in actualy fighting. Good British, German and Italian history mixed in with action everyone can enjoy.

Having rented ""The Desert Fox"" years ago, I was not at all disappointed in my re-done purchase.

276507,5,6300246868,"I am writing from memory here -- of the film from three months ago, and a walk from Herrlingen to the Rommel home twenty years ago.

Although the IMDB listing says the filming took place in California, the exteriors of the home match my memory of the actual house.  The driveway entry's gateposts, the curve of the driveway, the the shape and stone appearance of the front of the house, even the front doorstep.

I'll have to watch again to see if Mason was actually present in those exterior shots, or did he stay in California?

The house was briefly used as a U.S. military HQ, and then became an orphanage, I remember reading, after the war.

When I walked up the hill from Herrlingen toward the Rommel driveeway on my left, the gate was shut, but then a car approached it, and a young woman opened it, just as she saw me.

She did not want to disappoint a visitor from so far away, and so delayed her errands to show me in to the house.

I stood inside in the portico, looking up the stairway to the right, and she explained that three young families, each with two children, had cooperatively purchased the home.  I believe she said each family occupied one floor of the house, though I don't recall it being tall enough for three stories.

I did not intrude further, and went back outside, where she pointed out the bomb shelter (against possible Allied air attack) to the right of the driveway (the uphill side when facing the house), up against some (birch?) trees.

When she closed the gate behind us and drove away, I turned left and walked up the hill, the route Rommel took in his last moments.

The right side of the road had several newer homes, on an uphill slope, looking out over the valley and river below.  This same hillside appears bare, I recall, in the film.

On the left side of the road, the side opposite the houses, there is now a bench (concrete?) with a plaque, I believe, commemorating Rommel's death there.  I sat there for a few moments.  I believe photos of that site are availabe to view online.

I need to see the film again to be certain, but I now recall seeing that same spot in it, without the bench, or with a cruder wooden one (?)  Ah, memory!

Anyway, among the praises in your wonderful reviews here, I want to include praise for this film's conscientious effort to utilize or duplicate the actual Rommel home in Desert Fox.

The Rommel story is of course the mirror we hold up to ourselves in times of turmoil.

How would I have acted, given a career involvement in military expertise, as I realized the madness of the rulers and the insanity my country had fallen into?  Would I have withdrawn my skills from such wrong uses?

All of the recent fatuous praise of U.S. soldiers who don't think for themselves, and just ""do their jobs,""  hmmmm....

And ""loyal"" U.S. civilians, who've allowed the displacement of four million Iraqi refugees, among them 10,000s of young teen girls selling themselves in neighboring countries for the survival of their families, without an ""American"" finger lifted to help them.

Where is the shame now among us that the German people were expected to learn and display when confronted with the ovens up the road?

In this Republic, especially, the ""job"" of Citizen comes first, and we have been slow, slow, slow to do it.

The Rommels present the many-layered story of sane people trying to exist in insane times, much like the parallel sad story of Robert E. Lee.

We have even more apt lifetime examples generalship, such as Eisenhower, eager to teach the rest of us to keep War as the last resort, not the first.

We gather here to learn from history, and its significant characters, so as not to repeat or perpetuate their misery.

The final coda of Manfred's long and successful career as Stuttgart's mayor indicates that these were, indeed, normal, honorable people that any of us could aspire to equal, and yet, sadly, living in a time of such evil, they could neither prevent much of the evil, nor keep it from marking their own family with its touch.

The death mask of Rommel, the photo of which I recall seeing in The Rommel Papers, casts upon us a final look of contempt which speaks many volumes.

Without going into the complex layers of bitter disappointment that might have produced such a look, I might add that I hope this soul has since found peace in understanding how an immature humanity could fail to live up to the high principles he held, and arrived at forgiveness for himself in not penetrating the fog of life's accumulated experience enough to see what he was really up against, and to escape it with his family in time.",1226793600,2,4625,4.548309178743962
276508,4,6300246868,"The Desert Fox is a tight little film about Rommel that's directed by Henry Hathaway. I'm sure it's not 100% accurate but what film can be in only 88 minutes? Hathaway certainly glorifies Rommel as an honorable man that was only being a good soldier. Once again, not being a historian, I'm not sure of its accuracy but I don't think I've ever heard the person of Rommel being disparaged. There have been many facts about different German officers of that period that are common knowledge, many of them are never shown in a good light. The exception seems to be Rommel.

The movie is based upon the biography written by Brigadier Desmond Young who had been captured in Africa. He only saw Rommel from a distance one time in the desert & from this, after the war, he researched the background of the Desert Fox. The movie doesn't focus on Rommel's (James Mason) role in the Africa Corps. It focuses more so on the later period when he was a part of the Normandy defenses & his involvement in the assassination attempt on the leader of his nation. None of this is presented in much depth & in the end Ididn't feel any sorrow in the demise of Rommel.

Frau Rommel (Jessica Tandy) is presented as the dutiful wife though there is a hint that she was the catalyst in getting Rommel involved in the plot. Dr. Karl Strolin (Cedric Hardwicke) approaches Rommel about the plot. At this point we are told that Rommel has harbored secret feelings about the situation that he had revealed to his wife. Rommel sees it as an act of treason even though it's the right thing to do. This inner conflict causes Rommel to be hesitant about the consequences.

There's not a lot of action in the movie, it's more of a character study about a man who must make an extraordinary decision. The movie has authentic film footage interspersed throughout. The film even has the part where the satchel bomb was placed in the bunker by Col. Von Stauffenberg (Eduard Franz) to kill the infamous leader (Luther Adler). There are a couple of scenes with Field Marshall Von Runstedt (Leo G. Carroll), one of which reveals where Von Runstedt's sympathies might lay.

The official version of Rommel's death was that he died from his war wounds. The film makes it plain that Rommel was about to be put on trial for treason & it was obvious he was guilty. The messenger (Everett Sloane) makes it plain that Rommel only has one choice. Rommel wants to go to trial but his wife & son would suffer the consequences of this. Rommel is a hero & they would prefer he would go away quietly without making the noises that the German people would hear & respect. Rommel agrees to take the offer in order to protect his family.

The Desert Fox is a good film that gives James Mason a chance to show some of his acting skills. The real life Desmond Young portrays himself in the movie & is the narrator. The film is in very good condition & there aren't any significant bonus features though it does have a Spanish audio track & subtitles in English & Spanish.",1223769600,2,3010,4.5054945054945055

276579,2,6300246868,"For those unaware (just in case), Field Marshall Erwin Rommel was one of the most successful General Officers in the German Army during World War II, and a favorite of Hitler. He was a very successful junior officer during World War I while fighting in France and was again instrumental in France's fall during the Second World War.  Though he was a German celebrity due to his North Africa accomplishments, he fell from Hitler's favor as the Field Marshall's North Afrika Korp suffered reverses. Eventually Rommel's obedience to Hitler's command, unknown to Hitler, became questionable.

The film focuses exclusively on Rommel's gradual dissent. The dialog has a few bits of wit thrown in and examines the conundrum of the General officer in regards to duty versus moral responsibility. Should he strictly follow orders that violate his better judgement as a Commander and also a Citizen. In particular the film displays conversations between Rommel and his wife, fellow officers, and close friend, the Doctor. The film begins with a Commando raid action sequence that is laughable in terms of tactical validity and really sets a bad tone for the film. Commandos dart from room to room spraying rounds from their automatic weapons at German Soldiers who run indiscriminately towards the firefight. Other times, a Commando fires a burst, turns his back to the enemy, and runs away with no regard to his pursuers, until shot in the back. Fortunately, the film does not repeat similar action scenes, but occasionally throws in a highlight of actual War footage to tie the chronological story together. However, these scenes are fairly tedious since there is no powerful soundtrack or video content involved. I was happy when the film returned to dialog, which represents the lion's share of the movie. Most scenes, which would appear natural on a Broadway stage, show Rommel and the other characters expressing their displeasure with Hitler's meddling in the arena of strategic and tactical battlefield command.

In no way is the film suspenseful or dramatic. Dialog is generally ""canned."" With Victorianesque accent,  Rommel speaks to his wife, ""Darling, I love you.""  His wife replies, ""Yes Darling, but not now."" ""Darling, I must speak to Hitler"" and on an on in this uncomely, non-Germanic tone. Historically, the movie is shallow. From a biographical standpoint, the movie is extremely brief. Action is ridiculous and virtually nonexistent. In a few brief moments, the viewer is invited to ponder Rommel's position, such as the final conversation with the Doctor. These moments, accompanied by views of Rommel's black, leather trench coat, tend to salvage the movie.

I believe there is a distinctly, small number of War fans that will enjoy this movie. Those that have a nostalgia for the old black and white picture, paralleled by good and bad characters, and sequenced with a tightly woven, transparent story will enjoy ""The Desert Fox."" I would recommend reading one or two of the prominent books on Rommel. This movie is in no way essential to understanding or enjoying the knowledge of one the modern era's greatest Commanders.",1214179200,12,3136,5.12720156555773

276581,4,6300246868,"1951's ""The Desert Fox"" stars James Mason in his signature role as German Field Marshall Erwin Rommel, charismatic commander of the legendary Afrika Corps in the Second World War.  Oddly enough, the movie isn't about Rommel's exploits in North Africa. The dramatic thread is Rommel's growing disenchantment with Adolf Hitler as the tide of war begins to run against Germany in 1942.

The movie opens with an unsuccessful British commando raid on Rommel's headquarters in North Africa. An ailing Rommel then returns from Europe to rally his troops as the climatic phase of the battle of El Alamein gets underway.  Rommel's tactical wizardry is not enough to save his troops from defeat.  When he requests permission to withdraw his battered army, Hitler directs him to fight to the death, eroding Rommel's confidence in his leadership.

Rommel is next assigned to bolster defenses in Normandy against the anticipated Allied second front.  He is quietly approached by conspirators within the government who seek to overthrow Hitler and end the war.  Rommel is drawn into the conspiracy.  When it fails to kill Hitler, there will be a price to be paid.

In 1951, the details of Rommel's death were not widely known.  The movie adroitly mixes real footage and dramatization to tell his story.  A young Jessica Tandy is excellent as his wife.  Leo Carroll has a nice turn as the aging Field Marshall Von Runstadt, Rommel's nominal boss in Normandy.  Luther Adler is frightening as the slowly deteriorating Hitler.

This movie is highly recommended to fans of World War II movies, who are advised to check out ""The Desert Rats"", Mason's original turn as Rommel, the Desert Fox.",1201564800,,1671,5.007246376811594

Briefly covering his initial genius as a battlefield commander, and later when the war had turned, his gradual dissaffection with Hitler.

From what I have read it is not entirely accurate, but it gives a good impression of the man, and in the leading role James Mason is, as always, magnificent. He makes no attempt to do a fake German accent, and it would be unneccessary. At the end Mason (who knows whether this is true or not) shows Rommel to be a dignified and courageous man. Particularly good in a supporting role is Leo G Carroll as Field Marshall Rundstedt who's own disanchantment is a turning point in the film.

The film was made only 6 years after the end of WW2, but it is a fact that even Churchill praised Rommell. Whether this would have happened if he had remained completely loyal to Hitler is open to debate. Nevertheless this remains an engrossing film.",1183593600,2,936,4.598802395209581

As Field Marshall Rommel, much propaganda value came from his initial African exploits which led to a lavish State funeral long after the top brass considered him a traitor following the July 20, 1944 assassination attempt.  And, of course, he missed the prediction of the Normandy Invation, which would have been a lasting legacy and perhaps an outcome-changing realization.  However, the Reich's Atlantic Wall was simply spread too thin, and by the time he was assigned to assess its strenghts and weaknesses, it was far too late in the game.

Nonetheless, James Mason was an ideal pick around 1950 to play Rommel, so shortly after the war, and in context, it is eerily documentary-like.

The life of his son Mannfred, who became mayor of a major West German city, would be of equal interest....

Understandably, so soon after the end of WWII, it focuses more on the his questioning of the leadership of Hitler than on this battlefield exploits.

Unfortunately the Desert Fox cannot hide its miniscule budget, with lots of stock footage and talk, talk, talk...it provides no sense of grandeur or sweep whatsoever. If you are looking for some big battle scenes you will be sorely disappointed.

The best thing about this film is James Mason but even he struggles to give Rommel three dimensions - hampered by a lightweight script that is barely adequate.

The only interesting aspect of this film is that is provides a very sympathetic portrayal of a ""good"" German soldier only 6 years after the end of the second world war.

276587,5,6300246868,"While this 1951 biographical film on WWII German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel is stylistically dated, ""The Desert Fox"" is a decent enough documentary about key moments in his life between 1941 to 1944.

Based on the research undertaken by Michael Rennie, who was a POW in North Africa when he first encountered Rommel, he relates how his travel to Germany after the war and interviews with family members and soldiers who served under him influenced his quest to discover the truth behind Rommel's death. From there, the film attempts to probe how and why Rommel became a conspirator in Adolf Hitler's assassination.

Although filmed six years after the WWII, ""The Desert Fox"" is surprisingly respectful in its treatment of Rommel. He is portrayed as an honourable man who fought for his country's cause, but then realised he had to correct Hitler's misuse of power, disregard for life and dishonour of Germany.

As for the cinematography, I found the weakest scene in the film was in the opening when British commandos attempted to assassinate Rommel in 1941; it is set on a film stage and looks it. Otherwise, the historical footage of some of the battles in North Africa, the Atlantic fortifications and D-Day are appropriately segued to his life and lend authenticity. There are even brief glimpses of Generals Eisenhower and Patton, as well as then British Prime Minister Churchill's tribute honouring the heroics of Rommel.

James Mason's portrayal of Rommel is superb. Jessica Tandy as Rommel's dutiful and supportive wife is passable, although it's certainly not her finest performance.

The digital transfer of this B&W film looks fine.",1147046400,11,1643,5.092936802973978
276658,4,6300246868,"It is interesting how often the losing sides in great conflicts often throw-up great military leaders. Just as the Confederacy had Robert E Lee in the Civil War so too did the German Wehrmacht, in WWII, have the military genius of Erwin Rommel.

This 1951 classic has British actor James Mason in the lead, and flanked, by Cedric Hardwicke (Dr Karl Strolin, mayor of Stuttgart), Jessica Tandy (Frau Lucie Rommel), Leo G Carroll (Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt) who all give fine performances. Cameo appearances come from Rommel biographer Desmond Young, who plays himself, as a captured British officer in North Africa at the start of the film's action, and footage of US Generals, Dwight Eisenhower and George Patton (waving at tank crews).

The film traces Rommel's growing disenchantment with Hitler (Luther Adler) and the encroachment of the Nazi police state on the life of its citizens - revealed in guarded conversations between Rommel and his friend Mayor Strolin, (the latter also giving a gestapo spy the slip) and Rommel and von Rundstedt.

This disillusionment is clearly seen in the two separate conversations between Rommel and Dr Strolin -the first in a hospital ward where Rommel is clearly more up-beat and later in Rommel's study, where the conversation is more strained and indeed aggressive between the two old friends.

The destruction of the Rommel family unit is a poignant moment as Rommel goes to his death (via self induced poison) to safeguard the lives of his wife and son. The Fuhrer honours the fallen hero of the Reich with a state funeral after he 'had succumbed to war injuries' -fulfilling his 'bargain' that if Rommel went quietly nothing would happen to his family.

The reason this dreadful scene came to fruition was that Rommel was implicated in the 1944 bomb plot (of 20 July) against Hitler but unlike some of the other conspirators, who ended up on meat hooks, the Fuhrer did not want the scandal of a trial involving the hero of the Afrika Korps.

Ironically Rommel, also narrowly escaped death in July 1944, just 3 days earlier than the attempt on the life of Hitler, when his staff car was attacked by a Canadian fighter pilot, leaving the Field Marshal injured and hospitalised.

The film is basically real to life although Manfred Rommel in the film is portrayed as a naive 15 year old unaware of the dreadful fate of his father as the Field Marshal exits the family home for the last time.

In reality, the son knew that his father was being driven to his pre-arranged doom by the two military emissaries acting under instructions from the Fuhrer.

This is a fine film made only six years after the end of WWII -and is a sympathetic documentation of the events surrounding the life and times of the famed Desert Fox, Erwin Rommel.",1123200000,49,2780,4.823529411764706

276660,4,6300246868,"Henry Hathaway's 1951 film on Erwin Rommel, Nazi Germany's most brilliant tactician whose indirect involvement in a failed plot to assassinate Hitler resulted in his untimely death.

 The film is a character study and focuses more on Rommel's relationship with Hitler and the German High Command as opposed to his achievements as a military tactician. Because the nature of his death wasn't very well known at that time, the film focuses on Rommel's deteriorating relationship with Hitler and his eventual participation in the assassination plot. This is normal since, with the film being made only 6 years after the end of WWII, audiences would have been quite unreceptive to a film glorifying a German general's military exploits against allied forces.

 All in all, James Mason delivers a brilliant performance as a man who is struggling with his conscience. Is his duty as a general to just obey Hitler or to protect Germany from destruction? What should he do when Hitler's megalomania is a greater threat to Germany than the Allies themselves? How can he be a good soldier and live with himself by committing treason: even if treason is the only logical alternative? Although the film isn't entirely accurate in its history, it succeeds in capturing all of the internal conflicts Rommel must have suffered in deciding what to do. The film is also accurate in portraying the impossible dilemma faced by Von Runstedt and others in the German High Command with Hitler's incessant meddling in military planning and execution. As the movie shows, by 1944 Hitler assumed direct control of virtually all military operations in the major theaters with disastrous results (i.e. insisting that most heavy guns and panzer divisions remain in Calais even when the D-Day invasion was well underway). This dilemma was dealt with humor in the movie when Von Runsted sarcastically tells Rommel about how corporals (i.e. Hitler) are such brilliant strategists and tacticians who clearly know far more about waging war than your run-of-the-mill Field Marshalls: ""You know how rigid those corporals can be.""

 Altogether a great film that sheds light on the character of one of the greatest military tacticians of the 20th Century. A film not to be missed.",1090886400,17,2243,5.114754098360656

Although Rommel was indeed the commander of Germany's Afrika Corp in World War II, and there earned a reputation as a master tactician, that is not what this movie is about.  Two-thirds of this movie's 88 minute length focuses on Rommel's minor role in a conspiracy to kill Hitler.  The conspiracy failed, and Rommel eventually paid with his life for his involvement.  (In truth, Rommel was lucky.  The other conspirators were hanged on piano wire and died a painful death.  Because he had been built up into a national hero, Rommel was given the opportunity to take poison, and the public was told he died of war wounds.
I'm afraid most viewers, jaded by modern F/X and action laden efforts like Saving Private Ryan, will be disappointed with this rather inexpensively made effort from 1951.  There is very little action other than a commando raid during the first five minutes of the movie.  The little remaining action is actual stock footage of the war, skillfully cut into the film.  The movie is very talky, focusing on Rommel's relationship with his wife and son, Field Marshal Von Rundstedt, and Adolph Hitler.
I have to admit that when I watched an early scene that showed Rommel in North Africa, wearing a long black leather overcoat consulting with his officers, I said to myself ""pure Hollywood! there is no way he would have been wearing that in the hot desert.""  Then I went to my library and consulted a book on Rommel, lavishly illustrated with photographs.  Not only was Rommel wearing the black leather overcoat, he was dressed precisely as depicted in the movie.  There is also a remarkable resemblance between Rommel and James Mason, who does an outstanding job portraying Rommel in the movie.

The film pays tribute to Rommel and is a superb tribute about Rommel's life as General, husband and father. Rommel was a huge believer in tactics and won many early victories as the film shows, not all in great detail, but enough to get the point across. As the film begins at the begining of WWII, Rommel took control of the Afrika Korps, and they would take total control of North Africa. But then the tide would turn, and the Germans were defeated. Somewhat defeated but not totally lost Rommel is put in charge by Hitler (Luther Adler) to take over the Atlantic Wall. He orders it to be built up to such military power that the Allies will be pushed back into the sea and be defeated. As this happens the film picks up. The D-Day Invasion is one of the high points of the film. But it does not fail after that. Something just as important to Rommel as the Atlantic Wall, is taking Hitler out of power and this seems to be a must, not an option. So along with others that believe the Fuhrer must be taken out of power, they plot to assassinate him. But it fails and Hitler goes after everyone that might be against him. In the end Rommel himself is targeted and must either take poison and save his family and reputation or die a slow death. So Rommel puts on his best uniform and bids farewell to his wife (Leo G. Carroll). ""The Desert Fox"" is a must see as it is about a man who was loved by his fellow soldiers and was respected by those who fought against him during the war.
