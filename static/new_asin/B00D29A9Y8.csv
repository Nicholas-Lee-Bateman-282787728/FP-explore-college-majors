8588505,5,B00D29A9Y8,"A well done powerful film that years ago brought my father-in-law to salvation and who is now in his eighties having served God faithfully ever since.  My husband and I were pleased to have found this DVD finally and after watching it, could feel the strength of its gospel message most singularly.  Although the setting is in the past, the story is timeless.  If you have a relative or friend who needs to find Christ, I would highly recommend watching this together.",1405382400,4,468,4.682926829268292
8588506,5,B00D29A9Y8,A 60 year warp back in time. I was expecting our third child who turned 60 this year. It had serious impact on  these new Christians.  We were called to full-time ministry 10 years later. My husband was a pastor and served in a pulpit ministry until he retired  in the 1990's.,1405123200,5,276,4.269230769230769
