2753102,5,B000N2HDIM,"I've been disappointed in most of the Rifftrax released so my expectations were rather low for this outing.  Let me say though, you won't be disappointed!  The riffing is MST3K caliber and precise, well delivered and scathing at times.  (think Sci-Fi era).  A lot of writing and planning went into the riffs and it really pays off.  a definite must have!",1186099200,2,354,4.737704918032787
2753103,3,B000N2HDIM,"Like many, I was (and remain) a huge fan of MST3K; I have eagerly awaited each compilation released over the past few years. So, when I learned of this project I was excited to see what the Film Crew would be like. Sadly, this was very disappointing. Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett still write very funny material, and the film was of about the quality you'd expect. However, the premise (three guys who were hired to provide commentary tracks for movies that don't have them) was a non-starter, and the filler material (think MST3K ""skits"") was strained, surreal, and not remotely funny. This effort still had some hilarious moments, and is probably worth adding to your collection if you like riffing bad movies. Just don't expect MST3K...it's not even close.",1185926400,2,773,4.863636363636363
2753104,4,B000N2HDIM,"Words can barely express how terrific it is to have Mike Nelson, Bill Corbett and Kevin Murphy back and doing what it is they do best.  Namely, making the unwatchable watchable.  In this case it is providing the 'commentary' for a piece of early 60s drive-in dreck called 'Hollywood After Dark'.  Listening to them bounce riffs off this terrible movie, I can almost think myself back to 1998 and the crew of the Satellite of Love.  But The Film Crew doesn't have to play act like they did back then.  Gone are the robots and the space ship and the mad scientists.  The Film Crew is just three guys who watch bad movies with you and make you laugh.  To that degree, the new incarnation is very successful.  They still have the comedy chops to make you laugh ... and because there are no television restrictions, they are able to resort to naughtier comments and saucier observations (parents beware, anatomical references are made.  They are very funny, but they also very anatomical).  But as is the way with most new ventures, they (The Film Crew) are trying to hone the personality of the new show, and to that end I dropped a star from the rating.  The extra -- Bill Corbett reciting a poetic ode to a bagged lunch -- was funny (and now I know what Bill Corbett looks like without the Brain Guy make-up).  The bumpers during and after the actual movie fell a little flat, though.  The sketches didn't seem to fit the personalities already established for the guys at the beginning of the DVD.  That's alright, and I have no doubt they will make the bumbers work, too. -- And, as was the case twice during the MST3K run, the guys have picked a movie which is almost beyond comedic salvage.  'Hollywood After Dark' isn't as bad as a 'Castle of Fu Manchu', but it is close.  But again, these three were rocketed as babies from the dying planet of Krypton to save the human race from bad movies.  And they do make this first outing very satisfying.  At the best of times, they are a film school run by Don Rickles and Joan Rivers.  And there were many good moments in this DVD.  I sincerely hope there are many more to follow.",1185753600,3,2125,4.441860465116279
2753105,3,B000N2HDIM,"The Film Crew's debut effort has some belly laughs and lots of chuckles, and it's great to see this team back in action.  However, the choice of film is odd -- it's very dreary and monotonous, and even at this short running length seems too long.

The skits that bookend the film (and the ""Lunch Break"") are cute, but they don't really hit their mark comedically.  Here's an idea for the next episodes: Why not have Bill, Mike, and Kevin -- three very clever, funny people who know a lot about film and who have a lot to say -- just chat about the movie, unscripted?  I bet the laughs would be more genuine.

I like the basic premise of this project: the Film Crew provides commentary tracks for any DVD that does not yet have one. But I think the idea would be better executed if the Crew started out actually doing real commentary, gradually slipping into out-and-out mocking.  It's familiar terrain for MST3K fans for the guys to start riffing from the first frame of the film, but wouldn't it be funnier for that riffing to arise out of disdain for the movie than out of habit?",1185408000,2,1081,4.407035175879397
2753106,3,B000N2HDIM,"I'm a long time fan of MST3K and the crew in general.  I even own and enjoy Mike's commentary and RiffTrax.  When the 'gang' got back together, I was ecstatic, elated, suddenly without breath, and loving that the guys we've known and loved have not given up on us.

Having said that, I was disappointed with the first production from The Film Crew.

The Crew decided to start off with what I would consider a difficult to comment upon movie, Hollywood After Dark, that doesn't seem to know whether to be a wannabe crime movie, a strip fest, or a boring romance story.  Many moments in the movie just sit there, apparently doing so to meet some sort of film length quota rather than ever developing anything of value to further the story.  And the parts of the movie that aren't just sitting there, waiting for something to happen, the interaction is oftentimes difficult to poke fun at, and it shows.

Rather than two robots and a guy stuck on a space station, we now have three guys who have the job of providing commentary for old, oftentimes forgotten films.  Where in the past it was hokey but fun to watch, now I feel like the concept is forced and didn't find the skits with the Crew itself entertaining in the least bit.

There are some good lines in the movie (""Die! Die! Hey, nice koi pond. Die! Die!), but they're the general comments I've heard from the Crew's previous MST3K films.  None of them made me truly take note and laugh about their ingeniousness or comedic use.  The lack of the guys sitting in front of the film also detracts from the overall capabilities in regards to truly interacting with the film, which I feel would have made this first foray into old ways much more entertaining due to what the film itself offers.

But, regardless of how flat the first Film Crew film feels, there is the potential there that only the Crew can provide.  I'm hoping that they improve upon the idea and rethink the Crew skits so they don't seem so forced.  I also think they might do to bring on a female writer so that the guys don't stray too far into certain comments like the first few years of MST3K.  Though, Hollywood After Dark does open the door, all the windows, and even tears down a wall or two in order to open itself to these sort of jokes (however crass they may be).

As far as quality, I was surprised that the quality is very good for DVD.  Sure, you have the few moments of the old film edit moments, but the picture itself is clean and clear.  It gets high points for this, which is something that lacked in the MST3K series, even with the DVD reproductions.

If you're a fan of MST3K or Mike Nelson's work with Legend Films and RiffTrax, then you should definitely get this.  If this is your first time viewing such a program, I would suggest first getting one of the MST3K DVD sets (search DVDs for MST3K and you'll get what you need) to familiarize yourself with the people behind The Film Crew.  If you end up enjoying MST3K for more than just the jokes, then you will definitely enjoy The Film Crew: Hollywood After Dark.

Parents of younger children will more than likely want to decide on whether they want their children to watch this movie.  While there is no nudity (or perhaps I didn't notice it while I was looking away, because I can only take so much bad dancing by scantily clad women), it comes extremely close and has long periods where women are dancing with hardly anything covering their upper body.",1185148800,6,3451,4.451510333863275
2753107,4,B000N2HDIM,"Mike Nelson and the other familiar voices from the final incarnation of MST3K are back and just as funny as ever. For those MST fans who miss the show, the film crew provides new fun to be had. I have a small problem withthe film choice for this release: I love watching MST3K with my step son. I'm hardly a prude, however, this film pretty much has full frontal nudity in a strip joint type atmosphere. I figured it out in time and cut it off so I could watch it on my own later. If you are a parent who is concerned about such things, do not watch this with your child. Hopefully, the forthcoming sci fi movies from the Film Crew will be more kid friendly.",1184198400,15,658,4.1484375
2753108,4,B000N2HDIM,"After 11 years and 199 episodes, Mystery Science Theater 3000 officially closed their theater doors and ceased their disparaging commentary of disparage-worthy old films. But apparently, you can take the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 out of their title, but you can't take the... whatever, the MST3K guys (that's a hip acronym as all hip things need these days) are back in a new setting: they are now called The Film Crew. Back to their old shenanigans, if bashing movies can be qualified as a shenanigan, Kevin Murphy, Bill Corbett, and Mike Nelson are ready to get down to business: the business of mocking movies.

Their first release is Hollywood After Dark, a poorly made 1968 black and white film about a depressed loner who gets roped into assisting some strip-club owning gangsters with a seaside robbery. In the meantime, he also falls for a ""stripper with a heart of gold"", who just happens to be a younger Rue McClannahan from TV's Golden Girls. Clearly, there's plenty of joke fodder here, and the guys make ample use of it.

Starting with an introduction to the basic premise of the film crew, the guys describe themselves not as moochers of old films, but as ""value added resellers increasing profits for people who aren't us."" Their task, assigned to them by their boss, Bob Honcho, who calls them and talks to them over speakerphone, is to provide a commentary track for every film in Hollywood that doesn't currently have one. Their first task, sent to them in a package marked ""URGENT"" is Hollywood After Dark. The guys pop it in and the fun begins.

The film is desperately bad, obviously a clunker even 40 years ago when it was made. Filled with stripper dance sequences that are almost 5 minutes long, a 15 minute robbery scene with no dialogue, a nonsensical plot, a confusing ending,  and entirely drab dialouge throughout, Hollywood After Dark serves as the perfect opening act for The Film Crew to make their mark with.

Fans of Mystery Science Theater will find little difference between the old style and the new style. Instead of a guy and two robots, it's three guys. And instead of seeing their shadowy images walk in and sit in an empty theater, these guys sit down with headphones to watch the film, and then the audience actually watches the film with commentary. These are the changes that necessitate the name change.

Fusing biting sarcasm with hilarious pop culture references (""Uh, I'm supposed to meet a Mr. Tumnus at this lamppost""), the film crew doesn't let up for a second when there's mockery to be had. Of a silent robbery scene with quiet jazz music: ""If Jim Jarmusch made a holdup film."" On Rue McClannahan's hair: ""All I can think of is Justin Guarini in a dress."" The jokes go on, and so does the awkward Hollywood After Dark.

The complete feature is made up of the crew's intro, 30 minutes of Hollywood After Dark, a brief lunch break, the final 30 minutes of Hollywood After Dark, and then some concluding remarks form the crew. The breaks are quite necessary considering the dullness of the film they're watching, but the guys perform best behind the camera as commentators, rather than in front of the camera as pseudo-sketch-comics.

Included on the DVD is a rather uninspired short entitled An Ode to Lunch, in which Bill Corbett performs a 90 second ""sonnet for lunch"" in a Shakespearean dialect that ends with, ""alright I'm hungry, shut off the camera."" Stick with the feature here as it offers plenty of laugh-out-loud moments and gleefully witty banter. It's official: the Mystery Science Theatre guys are back... with a hilarious vengeance.",1184025600,48,3601,4.806138933764136
2753109,4,B000N2HDIM,"Remember the TV show Mystery Science Theatre 3000? I do, I love that show. Seeing a man and two of his robot pals doing commentary on the worst movies made it a wonderful experience. Although I missed its run on Comedy Central, I did watch it a lot when it aired on the Sci-Fi channel. Normally I wouldn't waste my time with old low budget science fiction films; But when the Mystery Science Theatre crew provide the commentary, I can't resist. I stay glued to the TV listening and laughing at all the jokes. Thanks to Shout! Factory, us MST3K fans can rejoice and laugh some more. Three of the brilliantly cracked minds behind the Peabody Award-winning comedy program have reunited for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Film-Crew-Hollywood-After-Dark/dp/B000N2HDIM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Film Crew: Hollywood After Dark</a>, a DVD-only series that provides a similar skewering to some uproariously bad B-movies. Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett join together once again to bring us excellent commentary. The Film Crew are three affable guys who've been hired by a jovial yet clueless billionaire to provide commentary tracks for atrocious films.

They're job is to provide commentary for old movies that don't have a commentary track already. Of course, they have to be really bad movies. This new DVD is definitely worth watching, because it's really funny. To our amazement, the Crew's ""commentary"" is more cutting than informative (surprising isn't it?). The Film Crew's first target is a miserable 1968 slice of sexploitation starring a youthful Rue (The Golden Girls) McClanahan (quite atrocious). The Film is called Hollywood After Dark (aka Walk the Angry Beach), and man is it a terrible film. It's one that I actually recommend staying away from. That is unless you want to ruin 74 minutes of your time. In the movie a young girl comes to Hollywood to try to break into the movies. Sadly she winds up being taken advantage of by sleazy producers and is forced to become a stripper. Parents and fans alike should take note that the gags in The Film Crew are a little more ""adult"" than the ones on MST3K.

Hollywood After Dark isn't very graphic in terms of violence or sexuality, but it does feature a handful of half naked females dancing around. For the most part, this is harmless if hilarious stuff.  The strip teases are more funny than they are sexy. I had a nice time laughing at the movie itself. Hollywood After Dark is a comedy in its own right. The commentary provided by The Film Crew is very entertaining. While the movie itself isn't, the DVD is worth watching just for the funny commentary. That's the sole purpose for this release. You're not buying the Film Crew DVD for 'Hollywood After Dark', you're buying it for the Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett commentary. Hollywood After Dark is a cinematic train wreck that's loaded with terrible dialog and a cast of half naked strippers. The story loses itself somewhere and you're left wondering what the hell is going on. Much like MST3K, the Film Crew takes a much needed lunch break in the middle of the movie.

The Film Crew point out most of the movie's flaws, as if they weren't obvious enough. Hollywood After Dark suffers from a lack luster story and poor editing. All the quick cuts and lack of dialog in certain areas just make no sense.  Without the hilarious commentary, this DVD wouldn't be worth mentioning. Since it is worth the price, I'm recommending this DVD for all MST3K fans out there. I do have one complaint however. The commentary track on the DVD is funny, but it lacks bonus material. The disc's only sole extra is an amusing poem by Corbett which extolls the virtues of lunch in verse. That's about it, I would have loved to see some behind the scenes stuff as well as a gag reel. More extras would have made this DVD better. Still, I do recommend adding it to your collection. Keep in mind that this is just the first of many reviews to come. Shout! Factor will be releasing more Film Crew DVDs for other movies that are begging for a commentary track.",1183852800,25,4126,4.871794871794871

2753111,4,B000N2HDIM,"The Film Crew: Hollywood After Dark: 7 out of 10: Since the cancellation of the beloved Mystery Science Theater 3000 (greatest show ever), fans have been waiting for a comeback.

The short-lived Film Crew is just that. Staring Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy (former voice of Tom Servo), and Bill Corbet (former voice of Crow) the Film Crew promises to deliver the old magic back.

In some ways it does. The riffing is certainly up to the old standards. Hollywood After Dark is a horrible grainy grind house film featuring Golden Girl Rue McClanahan as a stripper.

The boys riff in vain but honestly, the movie was so slow and talky that there are places where riffing simply does not help the cinematic pain. For example the endless stripper scenes (no nudity and the woman look like Wal-Mart shoppers) provide very few laughs. There are only so many jokes you can make about cottage cheese thighs.

Since The Film Crew is a DVD exclusive creature, they were not restricted in content (unlike the television counterpart). I wish they had experimented on a more adult exploitation film such as one of the Ginger masterpieces. Though claims have been made that their riffing is more adult in nature, I really did not notice despite Hollywood After Dark's stripper theme.

Had this been a MST3K episode, it would have likely been a middle of the road one. Moreover, truth be told, I miss the robots and the silly sci-fi set-up. The film crew does contain a 'lunch break' where the boys engage in some of the most painful comedy I have ever scene. (Admittedly, some of MST3K's 'commercial breaks' were just as painful)

The Film Crew is better than nothing, but alas it is a somewhat faded copy of the original's magic.",1256256000,2,1711,4.724832214765101
2753112,3,B000N2HDIM,"I'm a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but I was a little late to the Film Crew party.  I heard about the series back when it was announced but for some reason it flew under my radar.

Recently I read some good reviews of the series, especially ones that compared it favorably to the seasons of the sci-fi channel run of MST3K.  I decided to break down and pick up a couple.  ""Hollywood After Dark"" was the first one I popped in.

Right off the bat I can say that this episode is very much like a MST3K episode, especially during the movie segments.  The film is a dreary tale of good people gone bad in Hollywood.  There is stripping.  There is a caper.  There are good intentions gone wrong.  It all ends with three dead bodies and money scattered on the side of the road.

The writing is probably the worst part of the movie.  There are whole lines that make no sense at all. The Film Crew points out some of their favorites and wonders at one point if the script was written using a magnetic poetry kit.

The camera work and direction are attempting to be arty and noir in several places but all this ends up doing is slowing the movie down and making things look harsh and cold.

The acting is not horrible, but not quite average. Rue actually isn't bad, but the real find are the strip scenes.  They are bizarre and seem to go on forever!  There is no complete nudity here, but it gets uncomfortably close on a number of occasions.

With all that said, the movie is solidly bad, but unfortunately doesn't have quite enough for the Film Crew to work with.  The result is that riffs come at a measured pace.  It's not a bad track, because the riffs are solidly funny, but the movie is so dreary that it doesn't offer enough for them to work with.

There are three host segments.  The introduction gives us the premise of the series, and reveals why this film in particular is chosen.  The middle segment occurs with Bill wanting to conduct a lunch meeting in a very corporate way, Mike and Kevin are not amused.  The concluding segment has the three of them attempting to recreate the final battle at the end of the film with other props.  It's about as goofy as what you had in MST3K, so if you enjoyed the host segments there you'll probably like them here.

What struck me most was that watching this episode of Film Crew really felt like a natural continuation of MST3K.  I kept waiting for the exiting the theater sequence.  The humor was solid and while the movie didn't offer the best material to work with it was bad enough to make me laugh.

For a first effort in a series this is four stars easily.  Compared to other MST3K episodes or Rifftrax material, this is closer to a three star effort - so I say 3.5.",1243814400,,2726,4.321499013806706

2753114,2,B000N2HDIM,"After MST3K, Mike Nelson and company needed something to do.  And after 10 years of a steady Mystery Science Paycheck, they needed something to put food on the table as well.  Their first post-MST3K foray, the Film Crew movies, are unfortunately just a limp, not-terribly-funny retreat of the MST3K concept.  The host segments are downright painful to watch.  OK, it's fun to see what Brain Guy looks like sans makeup, but their hearts just aren't in the host segments.  When they get into the movie, you can imagine that it's Mike and the bots, what with the voices and all.  But this movie is such a stinkbomb that even a MST3K-lite treatment can't keep you from pressing ""info"" repeatedly to see how much of the hour and 18 minute running time is left.

I think I have about every mst3k since the first year and have watched many of them multiple times. I don't think this piece is in the same league. Mike is good, the others ok, but the whole format is disruptive and irritating. And something about the robots always allowed them to be extremely critical without coming across as nasty, an advantage they lose here. This is passable entertainment, and I'm not saying don't waste your money if you are totally jonesing for some new mst3k- but it's going to be about equivalent to giving the Marlboro man a nicotine patch.",1206921600,5,671,4.419354838709677
2753117,4,B000N2HDIM,"I haven't been keeping up with what Mike Nelson and company have been concocting over at their RiffTrax project, so these Film Crew DVDs are my first exposure to the televisual movie mocking that some of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 alumni have been up to.  For anyone who doesn't know (though I doubt anyone is on a purchase page for a Film Crew DVD without any knowledge of this), MST3k ran for years on basic cable as a guy and his two robot friends who were trapped on a satellite in space and forced to watch the worst movies ever made.  Their only hope of remaining sane was to make as many jokes as possible.

The premise of the Film Crew is slightly different, although the end result is the same.  Three guys (Mike Nelson, who played Mike Nelson on MST3k; Kevin Murphy who voiced Tom Servo; and Bill Corbett who voiced Crow T. Robot) work at a DVD-authoring factory.  Their boss, Bob Honcho, wants DVD commentaries on every disc he releases and so forces his three employees to record a voice-track over the on-screen action.  Unlike the traditional DVD commentary, the annotations provided by The Film Crew consist not of insightful behind-the-scenes information, but rather sarcastic comments, hilarious jokes and mocking observations.

The first movie in The Film Crew series is a 1968 flick called HOLLYWOOD AFTER DARK which stars a stripping Rue McClanahan.  Yes, you read that correctly: Rue McClanahan of the Golden Girls plays a stripper.

Yikes.  And you wondered if MST3k had already found all the really bad films.

The movie features quite a lot of the stripping that goes on at Rue McClanahan's strip joint.  The other portion of the plot involves a weedy guy (Rue McClanahan's love interest) getting involved in some sort of heist.  What the heist is about never really gets explained, nor is the audience allowed to know why exactly the movie's two-dimensional bad guys need this particular character to help them.

For this MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER fan it was great to hear those three voices mocking films again.  I think the biggest mental shift for me was the lack of the shadowrama (the silhouettes of the three captives on the ""Satellite of Love"").  You may think that's a minor issue, but consider this.  When you were watching MST3k and they were doing a more risqu film, the silhouettes immediately conveyed to anyone who unexpectedly walked into the room that you watching a comedy spoof and not spending your time watching some 1950s sleazy cheesecake film.  Given that much of HOLLYWOOD AFTER DARK involves long sequences of bad and awkward stripping, you may want to make sure you have the volume up for the sake of anyone observing you.

Another fun aspect of The Film Crew experience is that the jokes are more up-to-date.  MST3k always had multiple references to current events and the popular culture.  Since the show hasn't aired since the late 1990s, a few of the jokes when watched on DVD can seem a little dated.  So I was happily anticipating the first post-1999 reference.  And, boy, it was a good one.  I've missed hearing these guys make fun of the present day.

Now, the big question is: how does this format and presentation compare to MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER?

I had fun watching this.  I'd rank it alongside an average episode of MST3k, which for my money is still funnier than most other stuff out there.  One thing I feel does hurt this project is simply that the number of writers is fewer than on the old show.  It's just the three of them here, and I think that the variety and unexpectedness of the material on MST3k was helped  by the fact that they had over half a dozen very talented comedians on the writing staff.

In any case, I'd recommend HOLLYWOOD AFTER DARK for any fan of MST3k in need of a fix.  You can even cheer during the closing credits when you see the names of Beez McKeever and Brad Keeley roll by (I did).  It may not be as good as MST3k was at its peak, but it's still pretty hilarious.",1206489600,4,3970,4.641833810888252

They have an opening/middle/closing segments, a set, small storyline, and a boss who ""provides"" the bad film. See with RiffTrax,the majority of the movies they are doing are major studio motion pictures and with the Film Crew they go back to riffing awful B films like they did on MST3K. What a bad movie to do for an introduction to the film crew. This one is very funny and enjoyable.

2753122,3,B000N2HDIM,"I guess like most folks who would be here looking at this DVD, I'm a rabid MST3K & ""RiffTrax"" fan.  So when Michael J. Nelson, Bill Corbitt and Kevin Murphy were working on some direct-to-DVD riffing; needless to say I anxiously awaited the release dates.  This 1962 movie is a bleak, nihilistic, story about an veteran who now works at a junkyard, hired by some stripclub owners to launch an amphibious robbery of a bank?store?, and falls into a hip, swingin'60's Romeo and Juliette affair with Rue McLanahan.
I really wanted to like this DVD, a lot.  Compared with the MST staff in their prime, this would not be a best effort.  Sure there's some good riffs, but the snap, and depth of the writing doesn't seem to be there.  (Maybe the lack of the other writers has something to do with this.)  The interstitial I thought broke the rhythm of the DVD; unlike those of MST3K episodes.
Anyway, if you're a fan, you should probably buy it; it's enjoyable certainly, just not ""all that"".",1193443200,,984,4.594285714285714
2753123,4,B000N2HDIM,"Hollywood After Dark is a scary, confusing, story about a guy from a trash dump who decides to work for a man who owns a strip club to help steal money.  The real sad part of the movie, the scary part, is the stripping.  It is the old fashion kind, in which the dancing is the most important part.  Funny enough, early stripping had nothing to do with nudity.  The fact that there is no out right nudity is a good thing when one of the strippers is Golden Girl Rue McClanahan.  She is trapped between making money and wanting to have some respect.  The need for respect seems to be a focus of the film but it is rarely seen.
The film, like many that these guys have done in the past, is bad.  Really, really, really bad.  We really do need Mike, Kevin and Bill to help us live through the whole thing and even they seem hard pressed to make comments.  Many times they become totally silent, shocked and dismayed by how totally bad the whole experience is.  Notice during the stripping scenes how they sometimes just run out of material, not even able to crack a joke, lost and confused.
And the film scares me.  I have seen bad films, very bad films, but how did this one even come to exist?  The bonus feature, Ode to Lunch, was a nice twist but as always, the movie is the point of buying this DVD.  Just make sure to have something to drink while watching.  Something hard, that helps with the pain.  Maybe makes you go blind.  That would help a lot.",1193011200,,1453,4.2290909090909095

2753127,4,B000N2HDIM,"As a long time fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K), I am overjoyed that Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett are back in the business of mocking terrible movies, though I wouldn't have picked this piece of junk from 1968 for their maiden voyage. Whatever the case, the jokes are as good (though occasionally a bit more adult oriented) as the majority of MST3K episodes, and once the host segments are over, you quickly forget that the three familiar silhouettes are missing from the lower right corner of the screen.

The film itself is a black and white drama starring Rue McClanahan as a stripper trying to make it in Hollywood. Much of the movie is filmed in a junkyard, which is (unbelievably) more interesting than the stripping. As far as the stripping goes, it is fairly tame and no critical areas are exposed (mercifully). The best word to describe the onstage action, actually, is ""boring,"" a trend that continues through the offstage action as well. The movie is so bad that I don't think anyone could care about any of the characters, and has one of the lamest endings in cinema history. You might think that a movie filled with underwater demolition experts, robberies, stripping, and underworld characters would be involving, but incredibly, the most interesting scene in the film involves a customer haggling about the price of a used auto part at the junkyard.

The host segments are amusing, though not as consistently entertaining as those from MST3K, but this film and the ones that follow give all fans of the late lamented show a reason to rejoice.",1189987200,2,1583,4.8161764705882355

  The result is ""Hollywood After Dark"" a truly abominable little ""strip indie"" feauting everyone's somewhat favorite Golden Girl: Rue McCallahan....back when her hair had more gold and less grey (and, speaking of hair; I was more impressed with the lead actor's Pompadour than I was with his acting!  I've been trying to grow one myself, after all).

I was worried that somehow this new effort would be some kind of step backward for them.  It isn't.  Their wit and screen presence has not diminished, and each of them is just as handsome and charismatic as I remembered.  The commentary they provide is inspired and fun.

2753137,4,B000N2HDIM,"When the Sci-Fi channel closed the doors on Mystery Science Theater 3000 way back in '99, it seemed to be an end of an era.  Well, you can't keep a good idea down as Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy & Bill Corbett reunite to become ""The Film Crew"" and their first DVD effort is ""Hollywood After Dark"".

If you need a bad film to make good comedy, boy have they hit the jackpot with this one.  ""Hollywood After Dark"" is terrible...horrible...just plain bad flick where even the ""stripping"" isn't all that interesting.  From the saying ""You gotta start somewhere."" Rue ""Golden Girl"" McClanahan is a rather lumpy stripper wearing a fright wig in love with a depressed junk dealer who falls in cahoots with two odd crooks to steal a pile of lumpy dough...no, not Rue, a bag full of cash.

Even the extended scenes with two okay looking, but nothing to write home about ""strippers"" doesn't help this mess of a film become remotely interesting. But it certainly helps to have three guys hurling insults at the screen while you watch.  The Opening & ""Lunch Break"" skits are nicely done showing that the guys haven't lost a beat.

As wonderful as it is to have three MST3K vets doing what they do best, I wish that the DVD itself was better produced.  There is only one Menu screen and no Chapter selection, so the only way to get to your favorite scene is to start the flick, skip ahead, then Fast Forward which is a pretty slow way to go. Also, for the few that are interested, they could've had an alternate audio channel without the commentary.

The only ""Special Feature"" is Bill Corbett's earnest ""Ode to Lunch"", which is a nice throwaway bit, though nothing that memorable. But you do get a ""The Film Crew"" patch to sew on your hat, shirt, or whatever bits of clothing you wish to anoint.

This may not be vintage MST3K, but it will do and I look forward to the next releases in the series.

Tidbits:

- When you remember that this film was released back in 1969, it's really on the edge in terms of just how much of the ""strippers"" we see.

- The skits were not only shot in Minnesota, there are also some MST3K crewmembers in the credits.

- I was all for democracy until this film was voted to be the first release of the series. While I can understand that my choice, ""Giants of Marathon"", may not have looked all that appealing, I can't imagine it being worse that this.",1186963200,2,2367,4.423963133640553

Anyway, Rue falls for a lunkhead who gets pulled into an armored car robbery, and existential wackiness ensues.

The Film Crew, that short-lived link between MST3K and RiffTrax, get in some good riffs, but the comedy skits garnishing the film are, let's face it, painful to sit through.
