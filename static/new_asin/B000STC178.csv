2890517,5,B000STC178,"I watched Megiddo II the first time on YouTube, and ordered it right away. I've watched it twice since having it for only a day. It is powerful, and every Christian should see it!

Caryl Matrisciana made the point about how the New Age and cults deny the deity of Christ and the Trinity. Although this has been happening since the onset of the Church, and corrected with the Council of Nicea, the reason for this false teaching will culminate with the New Age Christ. Meitreya will be coming on the scene in our lifetime.

If you consider yourself a watcher and have interest in following the false christ Meitreya, you'll have to see Benjamin Creme on YouTube. He lays the plan out for us[...] Don't miss it.

This is a greatly done video about current global events.
I can't believe nobody has reviewed yet o_O

If the following are somewhat familiar to you get this video and watch it:

New World Order, New World Religion, Theosophy, Allister Crowley, Helena Blavatsky, Charles Darwin, Adolf Hitler, Fascism, New Age, Aquarian Conspiracy, Freemasonry, All-seeing-eye, John Dewey, secular humanism, deism,

Man, what a great video!
It is Christian. But anybody who is into analyzing current events, with regard to occult influences can benefit from it.
Don't be naive to think that the media is feeding you well, get this video. It's very well done.

2890553,2,B000STC178,"A kind of film I would have made as a young Christian lad, blinded by intolerance. Not really a documentary but a sermon or polemic, posing as a reasonable interpretation of Christian scripture. Sets up every conceivable straw man possible (example: Hitler's misinterpretation of Darwin), then knocks them down in an attempt to evade a truthful and thoughtful consideration.

The mistakes made by the writers and director (as is typical of modern fundies):

1. Christianity is the only scripture (""the Bible says so!!!"")
2. Thinking that a literal interpretation is the only legitimate one
3. Conflating Lucifer with Satan
4. ""God"" is only a Christian God (""the Bible says so!!!"")
5. A country with Christians in it, living personal Christian lives, MUST have a Christian constitution and thus Christian laws

SO many more

These mistakes are made all the time by immature people, clinging to a world view (and who even fail to see that ""In God we Trust"" does NOT say ""In Jesus we Trust"" (or ""in Buddha we trust"", or Allah, Khrishna, etc, etc, etc), much like children who resist and distrust adulthood, refusing to accept reality.

Thinking is not allowed!!!
Freedom is scary!!!
Doubt is evil!!
You are not ultimately responsible for your life (only God and/or Satan is!!)

Also brings up the tired and ridiculous resistance to the difference between religious instruction and science.
Reality check:
Science is EVIDENCE BASED, and thus changes with more information
Religion is NOT, and thus never changes

Never the twain shall meet

It's exactly why the Holy Roman Church (with all her daughters) is fading into irrelevancy

Maybe the makers of this film find it ok that women were basically slaves to men. Maybe they think its ok that women have no voice, no freedoms and can be beaten to death on the whims of a man. I'm pretty sure that's Not what Jesus taught. You can not help but see the irony.
If you want to teach about a just, honest and loving God and Jesus don't start out with lies, oppression and hate. The rest of your message comes into question at that point. You can't say ""That is evil!"" while saying something just as bad is good. Women back then weren't fighting for spirituality, they were fighting for their lives, quite literally.

2890603,2,B000STC178,"OK, What then, pray tell, is the message here? Don't trust anything but religion, which is what we throw at you from a 100 or so out-of-context, iffy, or unreliable sources, but trust what we say and then don't!!!!. King James was a proven misogynist (woman-hater), homosexual, and occultist; he also had many books on witchcraft and cults translated. I have read the entire bible many times and where are the New Testament verses you so blatantly throw out in favor of Old Testament verses of another time. Christ came so that we may have life, and have it more than abundantly. He said, ""God is in me and I in you, therefore God in Christ in us who are saved. Every MAN you quoted in 1st 1/4 of film can also be quoted as doing and saying exactly opposite to your quotes. I don't appreciate how you use women as the downfall of man, civilization and the world as we know it!!!! Adam was given Eve to care for and when questioned, He points the finger straight at Eve who is honest. Adam took no personal responsibility and laid blame on his precious gift he could have guided or at least not sold out. This is why don't trust King James' version, translate verses yourself from the original Greek, Aramaic and Hebrew texts King James' scholars used. If you buy this rhetoric blindly, never studying these people, their lives and the Bible's translations, then this movie is talking to YOU! YOU are the ones that need to fear the rapture. I wish I had time to go through and prove/disprove or further put in context every bit of hodge-podge they are throwing out, but that's why they do it. Its easier than looking closer at any one of hundreds of quotes, or comments, or verses that can be easily be seen in a truer context where Christ said many times said he was not God, NOT to worship him, but God, chastised all those who tried to worship him instead of God, and stated he would be seated at the right hand of the Father (how can you sit at your own right hand?) God is in Christ and Christ is in Us, the Holy Spirit is in all who have accepted salvation and the only commandment NOW IS to love God with all your heart and love one another as God loves us =....use your own mind this time..",1414886400,5,2197,4.347931873479319

2890609,4,B000STC178,"Wow! This was so interesting (and informative) that I hardly know what to write.... but I'll try.

1. I greatly appreciated their use of using actual quotes from the lives of many of those cited. Personally, I think there is nothing that leaves a history of what people believe (and practice) so much as the words they speak and put to pen.
2. Twenty-five years ago, I would have assumed the talk of a ""one world order"" soon approaching was fool's talk. (Although I had no problem with their being a push towards a ""one-world religion"" -- as I clearly saw some churches pushing ecumenicalism.) Now (with their being so much evidence to support it by way of the direction of the society in general) I would have to suspend what I see around me.
3. The history of spiritualism in America... very, very interesting. I live in (what has for decades been referred to ""The New Age Capital of the U.S."") and with the increasing emphasis on witchcraft (and darkness - in general), particularly geared towards children and adolescents, what more need be stated?
4. I am at the tail end of those students who were taught that evolution was a theory (something to be considered but which needed more proof to be anything else) and, despite years of rhetoric, still believe it to be so. I have seen it slowly be treated as though it were a religion, even as I've watched scoffers make fun of those who don't adhere to it. To which I state -- whatever...
5. While I believe many people who watch this may end up making light of the (upcoming) killing of Christians - to me, it is simply a ""done deal."" It's evident in much of the vitriol I have read online (against believers), the suppression of (our) free speech, etc. But it's O.K. For me, the truth is worth dying for...

Finally, there were parts that I disagreed with. For example, the part about Billy Graham. I regard him as a true man of God who (at times - like in his trip to the Soviet Union) every now and again has put his foot (all the way) in his mouth. His ""definition"" of a believer was ludicrous and I pray he realized it.

2890620,5,B000STC178,"I to read the the bad reviews of this movie. Being aware of Chris Pintos work and wondering why it had two stars. It has two stars because the majority of the reviews are by non Christians thinking it was a New Age movie. One person said they love History Chanel Documentaries. That's because the History Chanel is secular and is full of lies and exactly what a non believer wants to hear..Anything they or the B.B.C. present that is about Christianity is from a world view of trying to disprove the bible and filled with secular lies and science that can be easily disproved.. Even the Bible mini series was so non biblical which is why they played it.
 It all started in the Garden of Eden with the original sin. The New Age is nothing new. It is Satins agenda from the beginning.
(Genesis 3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:
5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.)  That is what the New Age is all about. Becoming a god. Realizing your Christ consciousness. They take the verse be still and know that I am God. And they recite it saying to themselves or one another I am god. It is the reason Satin fell from Heaven. He wanted to be like his Creator the Lord most High.
 As for all modern Heresies and false religions. They are all ancient. There is nothing new under the sun.
We are living in the Last days as we have been since Christ Jesus Paid for our sins on the Cross, was Resurrected from the dead, and ascended to Heaven 2000 years ago. Although what is happening all over the world. In the middle east and the United States all biblical prophesy is being fulfilled before our eyes. Although the U.S. isn't in the bible probably because it won't exist or will just fall into the one world order where there will be no more sovereignty of Nations. No more borders. We know we are real close because of the Jewish people who were scattered all over the world were returned home in the hands of their enemies as the bible prophesied they would be in the 1940's. Since then things have been happening at a rapid pace.
Jesus Christ is the only way to Heaven. Jesus said no man come to the Father except through Him.
 If you know the bible and you know Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, then you won't think this is movie is crazy. You will see how it all fits together. We will see our blessed redeemer, our blessed hope, face to face. Amen. If you are not a believer I pray God opens your eyes. Because the bible says Faith is a gift from God. So please have an open mind and be a true seeker of truth. Because if you harden your heart to much you may not get another chance.
 The One World Order is not the answer for peace but it will happen because the Anti Christ will first come on the scene to deceive many. Then after 7 years Jesus Christ will return and end it all and then their will be true peace on earth. Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus Christ.",1395014400,3,2986,4.222416812609457

They hold nothing as they are all from one source, the Bible.  If I was arguing the opposite point of view to you (the Christian) with quotes from 1 source, and followers of the 1 source, you would think it was total b.s.  As I think of this movie!

If you are a Christian this film gives insight into the unfolding of the prophecy in Revelation.

I feel differing views on religion has caused many times the pain, suffering and turmoil in the world compared to what would have existed in the absence of all religions. I believe any all powerful deity worth his salt, if he truly existed, would be capable of convincing all men of his existence. Instead, most religions blame man for his lack of faith, when in fact the blame should go to God for not making his presence clear in the minds of all men. Of course, if there is no God, that couldn't possibly happen (which for the logical thinker, is the situation we've got)!",1387238400,13,832,4.444444444444445
2890634,5,B000STC178,"I have study my history for years before finding this documentary.  They did an outstanding job in looking into the past and pointing out the prophecy  in the Bible and the actual History.  History can be told as an opinion or the actual thing that we know did happen.
This film point out actual scripture in the bible and how History came to be until present.  Megiddo II is more focus on other religion and new age movement vs what the bible says.
 This is a good research tool than can save you time digging more into history of what actually happen and how christian cults started using mans knowledge.
 this points out why we are walking into the final days in the bible or should I say reality. (not as my opinion of what I am witnessing in my life being in the military and having the opportunity to witness this for my self.)

 I have actually gone to see this in real location and asked to see if it true or not.  I have experience and seen for my self the statement said in this documentation is actually true. I have also seen hours and hours of indoctrination from all these cults talked about in this film and found out, that yes this  is true.
Not even National Geographic or Discovery channel likes to point out the obvious about actual intent of the leaders and how they suffer in real life.

 I seen them and meet them, to bad I can't do anything for them other than pray for them to open up their eyes and walk away from that life.
Its amazing how every religion likes to say that ultimately becoming a god of a some kind and  to work for their salvation.
I had to sometimes dig scratch a little more to find out but sure enough like always. Satan plans are to make you believe the creature can be a god and knowing this is the first step into your destiny, in finding your light within you.  Yeah right!
  So bottom line this will bore you if you don't have interest of how things around you came to be. it brings light to the world around you using the bible and prove to you that the bible is true and true. Of course their is more and two hours plus is not enough, not even 10 years has been enough. I am finding more and more and it is frightening to know how deep it goes.

So if you are a Bible student, then this film is for you.  Just study your bible and you will find out the bible is not shallow and it is really deep.  Highly recommend it to you and for those who are seeking The Bible to be the true word of the creator of this Universe (Single spoken sentence). Like God said Let their be light! Let him be your light of the world like it was originally John 1 In the beginning was the Word. Which is Jesus the light of the world.",1387152000,19,2663,4.135922330097087
