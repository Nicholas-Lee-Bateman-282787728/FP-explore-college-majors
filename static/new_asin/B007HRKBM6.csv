5087201,4,B007HRKBM6,"Why should you purchase I Was A Spy?  Conrad Veidt, Madeleine Carroll, and Herbert Marshall are three very good reasons.  It's a Rank production and it's an English film of the thirties for two more.  I'm not going to give away the plot, but there's spies, tough decisions, love, gratuitous sex, heartache and the backdrop of World War I, the war to end all wars.  (Okay.  I lied about the sex).  But if you enjoyed Veidt as Colonel Strasse in Casablanca, Ms. Carroll in The Thirty-Steps, and Herbert Marshall in, well, anything, you'll enjoy this film from Rank.  Rank..., code word for wonderful film productions.",1369699200,12,615,4.8
5087202,2,B007HRKBM6,I do not recommend this movie.  I was very disppointed.  I felt I wasted my money. There is not much to this movie.,1366588800,,115,3.9565217391304346
5087203,3,B007HRKBM6,"I was intrigued with the cinematography of this movie and how authentic the costumes and interior design were.  The acting was very good and the actors picked to portray the characters in this film were well chosen.  Because the story is based on the espionage career (albeit a short one) of a real person, I was looking forward to seeing this movie.  However, after half of the DVD was played, it stopped and I was unable to see how it ended.  Up to then, I was enjoying the movie but I wish I knew what happened to her.",1356652800,4,521,4.285714285714286
5087204,5,B007HRKBM6,"I concur with the other reviews giving this 5 stars. The title of the film might deter some prospective viewers - it is, after all, pretty cheesy - but don't be deceived by the label. Victor Saville has directed a film with high production values, a well-constructed script and an excellent cast. The outdoor scenes in the German-occupied Belgian town, where the story is set, are reminiscent of ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" in their grand choreography and attention to detail. Indeed, the final scenes of ""I Was A Spy"" include a mis-en-scene effect much admired in that other film. It is easy to understand why Madeleine Carroll was a great star in her day. Not only is she strikingly beautiful in black and white, her range of emotions and fluidity of movement lend great vitality and interest to the character she plays.

The film has been somewhat restored, though it is not perfect in either vision or sound. These defects, however, do not count for so much because the look and intrinsic interest of the film itself outweigh the preservation shortcomings. We can only be glad that a film of this quality, made in 1933, has made it to a new generation.",1353888000,12,1161,4.6911764705882355
5087205,5,B007HRKBM6,"VCI seems to be on a roll lately, releasing several excellent DVDs of films that aren't great masterpieces but are still welcome additions to one's film library.  The picture quality is great.  The sound track is a little tinny, but that's characteristic of British films of this era.  Subtitles are offered.

The story is based on the autobiography of Marthe McKenna, which was a best seller in its day.  The screenplay is realistic and brings out the emotional conflicts of all the characters.  War is not a matter of black and white, but a lot of screenplays treat it that way.  The cast, headed by Madeleine Carroll, Conrad Veidt and Herbert Marshall is excellent and there are strong supporting performances by the usual British character actors.  Victor Saville's direction really shines in the scenes of masses of troops, but he handles the more intimate scenes well too, and manages to create a sense of claustrophobia where appropriate.  There are several of those camera zooms characteristic of early talkies that were necessary to keep the sound of the camera from being recorded on the soundtrack but which look a bit odd to modern audiences.  Don't mistake them for poor cinematography.  They were a technological necessity in their day.

Based on this one, I can hardly wait to watch the rest of VCI's new releases.",1344556800,16,1329,4.910313901345291
5087206,5,B007HRKBM6,Fabulous early British film.  It is great to have another early Conrad Veidt film available on DVD.  I Was A Spy also includes a great supporting cast.  VCI's presentation is very good and appears to be complete.,1342828800,9,212,4.675675675675675
5087207,5,B007HRKBM6,"This film surprised me, it was a very good story and despite being a bit dated as for spy techniques, was very entertaining.",1341446400,3,124,4.434782608695652

8516857,5,B007HRKBM6,"Having never seen this movie before, I grabbed it when I spotted the DVD release, once I saw the credits (Victor Saville was one of the most able directors in England in the 1930s). And I was not disappointed -- quite the contrary, I WAS A SPY was one of the most rewarding evenings of viewing I've had in a very long time, and one of the finest espionage thrillers of its era; and the fact that it's based on fact (and very closely on fact) makes it even better. This is a true classic espionage thriller, before the James Bond movies turned the latter into a theme park ride. Madeleine Carroll's performance is filled with subtle nuances, and the pain that she feels in what she's asked to do -- spend time (in her ""day"" job) as a nurse, saving the lives of German (and British) soldiers in a military hospital in occupied Belgium, while passing information and later also assisting in sabotage that could kill hundreds or thousands of them -- is palpable in her portrayal. Herbert Marshall is a little too stiff and proper at times as a man equally conflicted by patriotism and emotion. And the Kommandant, played by Conrad Veidt, is the most difficult of all to make out, equally torn by emotion and duty. Much of the action here is small scale -- a wrong look or a slight stumble can be a prelude to disaster; but there are some large-scale action sequences that will satisfy those seeking excitement and not just suspense (the most brutal killing of all, involving a single shot, takes place off-screen, midway through the movie, and ratchets up the tension in the picture even more). The DVD is well produced from what is probably the best surviving source -- the volume is a bit low, and some of the accents initially difficult to penetrate, but one adjusts in a few minutes to this flaw brought about by age and early sound technology. The opening menu also reveals the existence of some equally worthwhile movies in the library of the production company, VCI Entertainment. The chaptering is generous, and the picture quality, given the date of the movie, is quite fine, with excellent contrast and detail.",1452729600,,2116,4.63031914893617
8516858,4,B007HRKBM6,Another good Conrad Veidt film. Veidt is at his sinister best.,1413072000,,62,4.7272727272727275
8516859,4,B007HRKBM6,"I am an avid Classic Movies Fan, and even though I am 72 years old, this movie was made in 1938 - way before I was born.
As far as the presentation part is concerned, the print and the sound are unblemished. The performances were by two Classic Movie Stalwarts, Herbert Marshall and Madeleine Carroll, among others. Madeleine Carroll was a gorgeous blonde  and fitted the role of a lady spy perfectly. To reveal the story would be a travesty, but I would recommend all Classic Movie Lovers to see the movie and enjoy it.",1402099200,3,520,4.473684210526316
8516860,5,B007HRKBM6,"Love the film. It's a little long, but good like most of these films I've seen starring Conrad Veidt. I'd highly recommend this film to anybody.",1398297600,2,144,4.576923076923077
8516861,3,B007HRKBM6,It was a good movie.  Gave a good look into life in a enemy occupied country.  So sad when HB's character  sacrifices himself to save his love who was captured.,1375401600,,160,4.266666666666667
8516862,5,B007HRKBM6,"This 1933 film with three marvelous stars is of World War One.  Conrad Veidt, being German born, always played the German commander and all his performances are excellent.  Madeline Carrol finds herself drawn into the war as a nurse and further implicated to serve as a spy.  What she discovers later is Herbert Marshall her co worker also is a spy and ultimately becomes the love of her life.  Not a long movie, but entertaining.  I love this age of movie and enjoyed it very much.  Of course it is black and white, if that matters.",1369785600,4,533,4.5
