1706894,4,B0000648Z1,I enjoyed this movie as I love Gena Rowlands.  The plot is different and the characters are likable and real.,1366588800,,109,4.45
1706895,1,B0000648Z1,"the description sounded good, but I turned it off after 10 minutes, others might like it but I did not",1363737600,,102,4.15
1706896,5,B0000648Z1,I was looking to watch some old good movie. I chose this one only because of Gena Rowlands. I was pleasantly surprised. The movie is breathtaking - beautiful and very smart. Acting is superb. I enjoyed it tremendously.,1362268800,,218,4.7631578947368425
1706897,3,B0000648Z1,"I watched this documentary on my kindle HD, it was informative, and kept my interest, it did make me think and wonder how it would be to live as these people do everyday with war in their own back yards, never knowing what will happen next, never knowing who to trust....I hope this never happens in the USA but the way things are now, it would not surprise me to find ourselves in a similar situation. I would recomment this to my friends as I did learn from it.",1361491200,,463,4.213483146067416
1706898,1,B0000648Z1,"it,s slow and boring......... it goes on and on about nothing.... A true sleeper movie... Glad i did not pay more to see this",1360627200,,125,4.25
1706899,3,B0000648Z1,"Very well-acted movie! This is the strongest, most believable acting performance I've ever seen from Brooke Shields. Geena Rowlands is always superb. I was equally impressed with Deborah Kara Unger.",1351900800,,198,5.633333333333334
1706900,4,B0000648Z1,This is a very well acted film. The characters are given time to really connect so it is slow moving but well worth ones time. It has a soothing silence to it. Sweeny really shines as a well loved gay partner. I think it is some of his finest work.,1350950400,,248,3.98
1706901,5,B0000648Z1,the product was great and in great condition and lastly arrived in a timely fashion,1289001600,,83,4.6
1706902,1,B0000648Z1,"i so wanted this to be one of the really interesting, but it did not even come close. boring, boring, boring.  absolutely, nothing interesting. i thought that it would be alot more sophisticated due to it's subject matter and actors.  sad but true.",1233619200,2,248,4.744186046511628
1706906,4,B0000648Z1,Interesting story line and acting was not too bad.  Never heard of the movie before; sort of a sleeper flick.,1388448000,,109,4.45
1706907,4,B0000648Z1,"Great movie with real human touch.
Some complicated relationships.
Good scenery .
At times boring long conversation ,but overall good entertainment.",1387843200,,148,6.095238095238095
1706908,5,B0000648Z1,"I laughed, I cried, and I laughed again... and cried again!.. and then I smiled.
The Weekend stands as a slightly understated film that made quite an impression - and splash.
It's a story of loss, resentment, desire, pain and forgiveness.
Gena Rowlands is simply charming as Laura Ponti, a seasoned lady who lives her life as she chooses without judgment. A young James Duval delights as Robert, the doomed new lover of Lyle - who recently lost the love of his life.
If you like paced dramas with a hint of peril, The Weekend is for you. At least your heart will smile a few times.",1382140800,,581,4.4392523364485985
1706909,4,B0000648Z1,"I really enjoyed this moving. Guess I didn't read the cast too well prior to watching. I was pleasantly surprised by seeing Brooke Shields. It's a slow paced movie, a lot of time spent on developing the characters which I love.",1381708800,2,227,4.560975609756097
1706910,5,B0000648Z1,"Wonderful cast, well-written and well-presented.  I don't know why this movie hasn't been rated more highly by viewers.  Gena Rowlands gives her usual amazing performance and Brooke Shields, all grown up, is at her best in this film. It is a film that is moved forward more by character development than by plot. With characters well worth observing, this was enough for me!",1379548800,,374,4.920634920634921
1706911,3,B0000648Z1,"A quiet movie but backed with emotion. Needed to turn up the volume to hear the feelings behind the words. And like I said. The last sentence, made it all worth it.",1378166400,,164,4.15625
1706912,1,B0000648Z1,"The movie was so very boring, slow moving, plot awful.  Don't waste your time!  Even with free viewing via Prime, I was sorry I chose it. I could only watch half, then I had to give up, as it never improved.",1376956800,2,207,4.024390243902439
1706913,3,B0000648Z1,for me this was just an okay movie to watch..good acting  the main character was very good I was disappointed with the movie don't  know what I expect anymore the story wasn't bad just wasn't very entertaining,1373328000,,209,4.621621621621622
1706914,3,B0000648Z1,"Just somewhat dull.  Maybe a certain audience would enjoy it, but I really didn't.  Just not my style. Gena did an admirable job.",1371945600,,129,4.565217391304348
1706915,1,B0000648Z1,This movie was a waste of two hrs. Movie slow and I kept waiting for the plot to develop and the characters to show more emotion. You has to read between the lines a lot.,1371254400,,170,3.8857142857142857
7960623,3,B0000648Z1,"Video was not that crisp and for an older movie, should have been included free with Prime membership. Story line seemed to have a lot of cliche's and some characters were undeveloped.",1419724800,,184,4.78125
7960624,3,B0000648Z1,I don't really know what to say about this movie.. I am happy I didn't pay $12 to see it at the movies.  A little to slow for me and I kept waiting for more of a story to develop but it didn't.  I do like Gena Rowlands so it wasn't all bad ... Maybe just something to watch while you are multi tasking :),1395360000,,304,3.6615384615384614
7960625,5,B0000648Z1,"It kept my interest. The actors were good. Liked the involvement of all characters, especially Gena Rowland's part. The end.",1394150400,,124,5.25
7960626,2,B0000648Z1,I really didn't like this movie. It was very slow moving but I do like Gena Rowlands and Brooke Shields.,1393977600,,104,4.25
7960627,3,B0000648Z1,"Good for a quick easy movie.  I thought the plot was a little weak, but overall I would watch it again.",1393891200,,103,3.9047619047619047
7960628,1,B0000648Z1,It was better when you didn't know. Now you have to rate it R or MA or the story can't be told...why bother.,1392768000,,108,3.739130434782609
7960629,2,B0000648Z1,"boring plot

7960630,3,B0000648Z1,This was a thought provoking movie. Love Gena Rowlands no matter what part she plays. Funny how lives entertwine each.,1392422400,,118,4.95
7960631,3,B0000648Z1,"Marian (Deborah Kara Unger) and John Kerr (Jared Harris) are expecting an old friend, Lyle (David Conrad) for a weekend visit to their beautiful upstate New York home. Emotions run high since it is the one-year anniversary of the death of John`s brother, the handsome and charismatic Tony (D.B. Sweeney), who had also been Lyle`s lover.

Marian, who is still inconsolable after losing Tony to AIDS, is upset when Lyle brings his new boyfriend, a young artist, Robert (James Duval).

Meanwhile, the situation is just as tense at the Kerr`s neighbors` house, where oft-widowed, free spirit Laura Ponti (Gena Rowlands) gets a surprise visit from her resentful, angry daughter, Nina (Brooke Shields), and her married lover, Thierry (Gary Dourdan). Matters worsen when the battling mother-daughter duo joins the Kerr household for a dinner party, where the pain-riddled diners engage in a messy emotional showdown.",1391990400,,909,5.305555555555555
