4336184,5,B004EBYC8M,"Here is a rather odd movie--won't comment on the cat eyeballs!! But as with so many other films and shorts, the Riffers have their special and unique way of taking even out there material and making you laugh!! I loved this one and would recommend it to anyone who needs to lighten up after a long day at the office!",1395446400,,316,4.283333333333333
4336185,5,B004EBYC8M,"Rifftrax makes fun of movies--both those seen as good, and those seen as bad.  ""Maniac"" would have to be the latter.

No, don't confuse this movie with the William Lustig horror classic.  It's nothing like it.

Basically, what ""Reefer Madness"" was to actual marijuana usage, ""Maniac"" is to actual mental illness patients:  Over-the-top, completely unrealistic, and completely uninformed.

Fortunately, Rifftrax saves the day by making this film watchable (just barely)!  Buy it!",1373500800,,478,5.555555555555555
4336186,5,B004EBYC8M,"I think this movie would send me over the bend --- off eating cats' eyeballs myself --- if I were forced to watch it without the Rifftrax commentary. I sincerely wish the guys had written an intro song for this one.

Also, the brief frontal nudity in this is surprisingly shocking. Since I'm not a prude in any way, I guess I must really calibrate my expectations of content to match the historical period. No one was more surprised than I was at my recoil from the scene with nudity. Weird.",1365379200,,491,4.395604395604396
4336187,3,B004EBYC8M,"If you like seeing cats getting their eyes popped out, you'll probably give this one a 5. I was a little disturbed by it. Overall, this one is okay but not one of their best. Painful movie to watch. I think I actually liked the extra ""comic-con 2010"" better than the actual riffing of the main feature.",1363564800,,302,4.315789473684211
4336188,4,B004EBYC8M,"The movie is fun and the riffs are great. The odd movie might leave you a bit confused but the guys will drag you through it laughing.

The real value is in the Comic Con panel where they do a live riff of Buying Food with many different riffs than the version sold elsewhere. Watching the guys riff on people offering ideas for a future riff is worth the price of the disc alone.",1362787200,,380,4.135135135135135
4336189,4,B004EBYC8M,"They kind of lost me when the villain popped the cat's eyeball out, but still a funny edition to any MST3K fan.",1304553600,,111,4.090909090909091
4336190,5,B004EBYC8M,"I just finished watching Rifftrax Maniac a few minutes ago for the first time and I have to say, even being a fan of bad movies all my life and a long-time fan of MST3K and its successors, Maniac just may be ""the worst movie ever made"". Seriously, it's only 51 minutes long yet it has padding, tons of disjointed disconnected scenes, actors chewing the scenery, and a nearly incomprehensible and drab documentary style reminiscent of Reefer Madness. It's the Manos: Hands Of Fate of 1934. It must be seen to be believed.

That said, Mike, Bill and Kevin do a terrific job with it and the jokes on the commentary track are certainly of high quality. But if that's not enough reason to buy this, then you'll definitely want it for the extra feature, which is the Comic-Con 2010 Rifftrax Panel. The extra feature is nearly as long as the main feature and shows Kevin, Mike and Bill bantering with the audience as well as riffing on a great old Centron short about how to buy food. Audience members also get to suggest films for the next Rifftrax project and there's plenty of good interaction between the panel and the fans. At about $10 at the time of this writing it's certainly worth the price and you'll get plenty of repeat viewing value out of this hilarious DVD. Highly recommended for all MSTies and fans of really odd, low-budget movies.",1293148800,13,1343,4.572614107883817
8426667,3,B004EBYC8M,"I remember watching this film years ago and found it a little unnerving even by today's standards.  The guy's riffing actually didn't add a whole lot.  I was a little disappointed that the riffing didn't live up to the entertainment value of the film itself, but I did get a few chuckles.",1529020800,,288,4.519230769230769
8426668,5,B004EBYC8M,One of the most bizarre movies I have ever seen.  Great with or without the Rifftrax audio.  A must see.,1501718400,,104,4.15
8426669,5,B004EBYC8M,Great movie.,1481414400,,12,5.5
8426670,4,B004EBYC8M,"This was a good one, but it's brief at 50 minutes. There is a 45 minute panel at Comicon with the guys to add to it. The movie itself is from the 30's and very out there. I'd still recommend clasics like Manos life, The House on Haunted Hill, or The Guy From Harlem before it",1458604800,,275,3.9285714285714284

8426672,5,B004EBYC8M,"What happens when a mad scientist and a former vaudeville impressionist go into the grave robbing business together?

Imagine Tod Browning's FREAKS crossed with a Three Stooges short and you get the flavor of MANIAC, a 1934 exploitation movie loosely (very, very loosely) based on Poe's ""The Black Cat."" The story, such as it is, is meaningless. What matters is the film's endless chain of bizarre images: cats pouncing on mice in a morgue; a madman running through streets deserted except for cats and dogs fighting each other; a drug-addled mental patient abducting and raping a dazed, female zombie; a bare-knuckle fight to the death between two plump matrons, and a human heart devoured by a cat named Satan; all this, interspersed with images of witches and demons, as well as with long blocks of dry, clinical text supposedly taken from the medical journals of the day.

On top of all that, there's the unintentionally hilarious overacting of the two male leads, and the leaden non-acting of almost everyone else on camera. The film is the ultimate in found objects: a profoundly disturbing piece of folk art repurposed by RiffTrax into a masterpiece of dark comedy.

There's a bonus feature: a 2010 panel from Comic-Con, with the guys riffing the short, ""Buying Food"", and then riffing on their fans as they line up to pitch ideas for the next RiffTrax movie. And I've asked this before, but I'll ask again: who the hell is Veronica Belmont?",1433462400,,1448,4.878048780487805
8426673,5,B004EBYC8M,"This is one of the better RiffTrax episodes. Not only is the commentary hilarious, but the movie itself is so weird it's brilliant. I imagine that if someone like Rob Zombie would have been around back in 1934, he would have directed a movie like this. It even has some nudity! At some points, I laughed so hard that I was crying. Maniacally funny stuff!",1410912000,,354,4.461538461538462
8426674,5,B004EBYC8M,"Awesome DVD, great price, and immediate delivery!  A++",1409011200,,54,5.75
8426675,5,B004EBYC8M,"Exactly what I was hoping it would be , strange to see a movie so old be so disturbing.",1408579200,,87,3.6315789473684212
8426676,3,B004EBYC8M,"This movie runs 51 minutes, and it looks like the director cut all the exposition scenes from it, so that what we have is ""huhwut?"" and ""nah you di-n't!"" I watched it twice, and I'm still not sure what happened. Or why. Sadly, the riffing wasn't all that funny, either: nothing I wanted to quote. Still not sure why the guy popped the cat's eyeball and ate it, or who those women were at the end. I made the mistake of watching this right after Jack the Giant Killer, which is miles better. Oh, well, this DVD helps complete my collection, and I didn't pay very much for it. I will watch it a few more times, and who knows? Sometimes you catch lines you missed the first couple of times, and a Mike/Bill/Kevin-treated movie, previously unloved, will become a personal favorite.",1397952000,,777,4.47887323943662
