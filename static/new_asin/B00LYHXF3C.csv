6516146,4,B00LYHXF3C,"I searched all over for the ""smartpak"" description, couldn't find anything and I really eanted this in my collection so I bought it, great price! It's actually a regular CD jewel case with not one but two DVDs. It's all the material you would get in the original release, including all the bonus features, only inside a smaller package. if you want that neat DVD collection where everything is the same size, well, this may not fit but still a great bargain and you get all the great content!",1428537600,24,492,4.53932584269663
