8574058,4,B00BUELGJE,"This is another film from Japanese director Yoshihiro Nakamura (Fish Story and See you tomorrow everyone) and should be Japans entry for the longest film title ever competition (it won't all fit onto the IMDB page!). It stars Gaku Hamada as Shiina. He is freshly arrived at University and tries to make friends with his neighbours. One  Kawasaki (Eita) spins some yarns about his other neighbour and a pet shop owner which Shiina finds intriguing. Shiina is one of those lads who are naively over trusting, but after some light handed detective work, he discovers that all is not as it had been portrayed.

Along the way we have pet killers, a book store hold up, issues around HIV and a whole heap of Bob Dylan. Actually the Dylan song Blowing in the wind is used as a constant refrain throughout the film and the reference to god in the title is actually referring to Mr Dylan. This is told in a series of flashbacks as the truth and indeed the reality is revealed, sometimes the flashbacks  seem tohave their own flashbacks. When time jumps around Nakamura uses black and white footage and then reverts to colour in the now time.

This is a really nice film, there is some nastiness but Shiina manages to pull everything and everyone back with the force of his innocent charm. A film that can rightly be called multi layered, and a fine addition to the films of Nakamuras that we have been able to see in the West. I hope we get to see more from his back catalogue as I found this to be absolutely charming.",1388793600,,1510,4.5
