I know that Evie is a fantastic teacher, but I can't watch this since my player doesn't play recordable DVDR's!",1512777600,,139,4.148148148148148
8223272,5,B000WGX28Y,I love this DVD. I would say the beginning of it is for beginners but it definitely gets up to advanced beginner/intermediate by the end. I have been learning daily for about a month from various DVDs and can keep up til about the middle of it which is fine. It will give the dedicated beginner something to work toward. The teacher is delightful and really knows her stuff.,1503014400,,374,4.434782608695652
8223273,5,B000WGX28Y,"I know Evie from her own band and her previous work with The Stairwell Sisters and proudly possess all releases... I bought ""Buckdancing for Beginners"" a couple of years ago and have dusted it off several times with full intention of giving it a try... Today I finally did pop it in the machine and What a Workout !!! I knew Evie was multi talented, but many talented people have no teaching ability... Evie is fantastic ! I did about 20 minutes with many pauses of the disk and was smiling throughout... This jewel has, as of today, become a part of me exercise regime...",1485388800,,572,4.457142857142857
