7855144,4,630391439X,"This is volume 4 of 8 in Pretty Sammy's adventures.
(1) Pretty Sammy loses her baton and it is found by a classmate.  Will the Magical Girl wanna-be be more troublesome than Pixy Misa?  Will Pixy Misa take advantage of the situation?
(2) Tenchi makes a cameo appearance and really gets Sasami's attention -- to the point of neglecting Misao.  Just how is the Tenchi character represented in this series?
(3) An arranged marriage of one of Sasami's teachers (You'll have to see the volume to see if it's Mihoshi, Kiyone or Washu!) leads to complicated situations.  Will Pretty Sammy be able to keep the relationship together?
Pretty Sammy fanatics know that 4 different instances of this series exist. Pretty Sammy originated in a follow-up to the Tenchi Muyo OVA called the ""Mihoshi Special"" and later re appeared in one of the fantasy within a fantasy episodes of the Tenchi Universe Series. Next came the OVA, and finally this Magical Project S TV series.
Recommened for those who like things ""too cute"".",1014854400,2,1006,4.8313953488372094

Sorry, But I don't find little barbie doll-like, mini skirt, high heel warening sissy girls runin around with some kinda LOVE *cough cough* magic or sumpin'. Okay I admit. I've only seen pretty Sammy once on toonami, but Once is  anough! What happen to the butt kickin' action of Ryoko, Tenchi, or even Aeka ( i can't beleive I'm sayin' this) Hey, I'ma agirl, and I can understand some femine hero stuff, but not when the heroines are wearin' skirts and heels. What if the enemy's a guy? He  just say whoops and lift up her wittle skirt and she'd start screamin' and runa way. Ooooookkkkay.

7855146,4,630391439X,"Tenchi's produced some weird stuff, but THIS wasn't just weird, it paid tribute to the greatest anime ever. SAILRO MOON1
I first caught a glimpse of Pretty sammy during the ""time and space"" trilogy transmitted on TenchI Universe, a lot of people would think this a paroday, but by watching it you'll soon think different. I t stands on it's own as well as spoffinmg where it came from.

7855147,5,630391439X,"Magical Girl Sammy (Shikkoku no Mahou Shoujou Toujou Sami) is a very cute parody of Sailor Moon.  As a Tenchi fan I had to see it, but it was much better than expected.
The regular Tenchi cast is there, but all in new roles, but with satirical references to their space opera personas.  Center stage is Sasami for a change.  Such a cute, perfect kid.  Makes a good role model for kids ^_^
Sammy is extra complicated because 4 different versions of it exist.  Pretty Sammy originated in a follow-up to the Tenchi Muyo OVA called the ""Mihoshi Special"" and later re-appeared in one of the fantasy within a fantasy episodes of the Tenchi Universe Series.  (It was Sasami's dream to be Pretty Sammy).  Next came the OVA, which is what this tape is from.  Later a TV series followed.
Those really into Tenchi, Sailor Moon and Anime/Manga will appreciate the insider jokes.  The producers, artists and seiyu had a lot of fun with this one. The English dub is actually pretty good (but who can compare with Sasami's Japanese voice actress Chisa Yokoyama?). The music is very cute as well.  ^_^
Don't want to spoil things by revealing the story line. Shoujo (Japanese Girl Anime) and Tenchi fans will want to get this.  Did I say it was cute?",989280000,3,1233,4.5590909090909095

While on earth, Rumia turns Sasami's best friend,  Misao, into Pixy Misa, a loud brash magical monkey wrench set to distory  Pretty Sammy. This tape is a funny one where a lot of the orginal tenchi  characters appear in short cameos. If you want to see some old faces from  the tenchi serie si would recomend this tape!",967334400,2,857,4.435897435897436
7855149,5,630391439X,"I was expecting a spoof on Sailor Moon and it was even better than that. If you know a little Japanees and you're an Anime fan, you'll see some  interesting stuff from the begining. If you are a Tenchi fan you'll see some  familiar faces playing diferent parts.(Anime characters treated like  actors? Good idea! )  Sasami is Tenchi's little sister in this adventure  and the writers made her sound and act like all the little sisters I've  known. Tenchi,Ryoko and Ayeka are along for commic relief and  Washu,Kiyone'n'Mihoshi play stock character parts. Tsunami enlists Sasami  to spread love and peace on earth as Pretty Sammy but the fun starts before  then. This is a good video if you like light hearted adventures and you're  looking for a break from little Mon-sters. Your kids will even like it.^_-  You better hurry I don't know if Pioneer is going to reissue this  video.(Damn shame if they don't.)Trying to find a copy of MGPS 2&3 is  an adventure in itself. ~_~",967334400,13,972,4.714285714285714

Sasami transforms into Pretty Sammy using her magical baton and has to use her powers to keep the world a happy place.  If she does good,  Tsunami will become queen but Pretty Sammy's rival, Pixy Misa is out to  make trouble. Excellent Music! especially the opening and closing songs,  buy the import soundtrack if you can find it. Also Appearences by Tenchi,  Ryoko, Ayeka, Washu, Kiyone, and Mihoshi. This video is hillarious! Highly  Recommended if you like anything Tenchi.",948931200,5,560,4.956989247311828
