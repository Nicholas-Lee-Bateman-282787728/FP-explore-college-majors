2654988,5,B000ICLRGG,This is another version of A Christmas Carol. This time the ghost of Christmas past doesnt cooperate so the story takes a different and mostly includes the ghost of Christmas present. The ghost of Christmas future doesnt show up until the end. I won't say anything more because Ive probably been to much of a spoiler but you should see it.,1349827200,,339,4.573770491803279
2654989,1,B000ICLRGG,"I love watching Christmas movies.  There are not too many that I dislike.  But I have to say that this one is definitely at the top of the list for being boring.  What a waste of time.  There are so many good and very funny Christmas movies out there, but this one is downright Stupid!  Save your money!",1262736000,,303,4.155172413793103
2654990,2,B000ICLRGG,"Mediocre take on ""A Christmas Carol"" with Tom Arnold so why should anyone expect anything good.  Had really hoped that Leslie Jordan might be fun as the 'Ghost of Christmas Past', but even he fell flat.  Only fun part was seeing a c. 1968 living room on Christmas Eve!",1258329600,,268,4.448979591836735
2654991,3,B000ICLRGG,"I own every version of Dicken's Christmas Carol that I can find, and they all have their good points. In ""Chasing Christmas"" the ""scrooge"" character is about as unlikeable as any I've seen, because this one is the dad of a beautiful teenage girl who longs for a normal Christmas. Her dad, who is embittered about Christmas because he caught his wife cheating on him on a Christmas Eve 7 years ago, hates everything about Christmas. Of course there are the usual Ghosts of Christmas, but in a unique twist, the Ghost of Christmas Past is also embittered at the world he sees now, and wishes to live in the past himself. Scrooge and Christmas Present embark on a funny and touching race to find ""Past"" before midnight, when everyone will be stuck in the past forever.
Not the greatest version of the classic, but a fun and likeable one.",1222732800,6,834,4.566666666666666
2654992,3,B000ICLRGG,"There are several versions of ""A Christmas Carol"", and even if this may not be called that the story is basicly the same. Tom Arnold hates Christmas because his ex-wife cheated on him with his dentist on Christmas Eve. When he finally becomes enlightened by things he has no control over with the visits of Christmas spirits, it begins to sink into his head that he doesn't have it so bad. A reasonably decent romantic comedy for the holidays. Recommend you rent it first unless you are a huge Arnold fan.",1199232000,4,505,4.56043956043956
2654993,4,B000ICLRGG,I love Christmas movies and wasn't disapointed in this one.  It was sappy but good.  Surprising Tom Arnold was believeable in this part.,1196985600,,136,4.869565217391305
2654994,5,B000ICLRGG,I enjoyed this movie very much. I could watch it again and again. I just wish the dvd was a little bit cheaper.,1176595200,2,111,3.869565217391304
2654995,3,B000ICLRGG,"Good twist on an old tale. Tom Arnold is fun and the other actors, too.  My family will watch this one season after season.",1169078400,,123,4.125

2655026,5,B000ICLRGG,Loved this movie. I love Tom Arnold and Jed Rees. It was fun and light and I watch it two or three times a week.,1428192000,,112,3.52
2655027,5,B000ICLRGG,Another Tom Arnold seasonal relaxing movie.,1420502400,,43,6.333333333333333
2655028,1,B000ICLRGG,"This movie was so bad that I just can't believe it.
I watched this entire movie all the way through to the very end (where they played Bloopers which were not at all funny) and I kept asking myself why I was still watching and why I had not turned it off yet, and all that I could answer myself was that I was hoping that it would get better. It just kept getting worse.

The idea of this movie was really good, but the writers didn't know how to use it, they could have done so many creative things with this movie, but they didn't know how to write a script. There have been so many remakes of ""A Christmas Carol,"" and the writers obviously tried to be unique about it, but they didn't know how. The ""Back to the Future"" copying got boring really quickly, it was just too much and just not interesting enough.

The only thing that I thought was good about this movie was that the Christmas Past actor did a really good job with the terrible lines that they gave him, I really don't think that anyone could have done any better with what he had to work with, he really tried to hold the movie together.

But the Christmas Present actress just looked like she was trying too hard, I think that she was totally miscast, I would have loved Molly Shannon for this part.

I like Tom Arnold, I think that he is a good actor, but he just was not funny at all in this movie, but I can't blame him for the pathetic lines that he had to suffer through.

When they traveled to 1965, the writers looked like they didn't know what to write, so they just gave up. The movie had a lot of potential up until that point, and after that 1965 scene was dropped, the rest of the movie just fell apart. I thought that it was clever when they traveled to a black-and-white scene, but again, they didn't know what to do with it, so it was just some more boring lines.

This movie also ripped off ""Stay Tuned"" with John Ritter, that was a really good movie, and they tried to steal from it, but they just embarrassed themselves.

The ending, of course, was predictable, because it was a loose remake of ""A Christmas Carol,"" so we knew that Jack would ask what day it was, and his daughter would say that it is Christmas Day, and then he would go on and on about how wonderful Christmas is, etc. etc.  So, the writers, again, did not know what to do, so they just cut out to some unfunny boring Bloopers and rolled the credits, and so I decided to take out my frustration at watching this entire piece of garbage by writing this review, hopefully, to spare anyone else from wasting their precious time on this, because there are so many really good Christmas movies that are available instead.

As I am reading over this review for typos, my review sounds as boring as this movie, and like the actors in this movie, I can't do too much with what I have been given here.",1418774400,,2845,4.234317343173432

2655030,3,B000ICLRGG,"This is one of those ""typical"" Christmas movies. It is a fine movie, I love Andrea Roth's movies, it just isn't spectacular. Tom Arnold does a good job, as does Andrea Roth and Leslie Jordan. There just isn't anything particularly special about it. I'm glad to have it in my collection.",1412553600,,286,4.627450980392157

2655034,5,B000ICLRGG,"If you like funny movies.. this is definitely a great one.  I would call it a sleeper movie which is one that you didn't hear much about but when you did see it on tv, it was wonderfully funny.  Lesley Jordan steals the show.  Great product, price and service.  Thanks.",1399420800,,269,4.32

2655046,5,B000ICLRGG,This is by far he best of Tom Arnold's Christmas movies. The cast is solid. The writing is actually inventive and fun. A solid holiday film.,1392508800,,140,4.423076923076923
2655047,4,B000ICLRGG,This movie is a nice twist to watching A Christmas Carol. Tom Arnold shows his acting ability for any role once again!,1390003200,,118,4.409090909090909
2655048,4,B000ICLRGG,"A takeoff on the classic Dickens story.  It seems that there is a department of ghosts whose job it is to ""unScrooge"" people who don't like Christmas.  The Ghost of Christmas Past decides he is tired of it all and skips out leaving the subject (played by Tom Arnold) and the other two ghosts to have to chase him through the past in order to convince him to come back.",1389312000,,368,4.242857142857143
2655049,5,B000ICLRGG,This is a very clever and unique Christmas story that only Tom Arnold could pull off. A must see for anyone who has an off beat sense of humor.,1388016000,,143,3.9655172413793105
2655050,5,B000ICLRGG,"This one was another surprising movie. It was the same old plot that we have seen over and over and over but done in a completely different way. Another good movie to veg out and enjoy the season. I heard someone on TV just yesterday say that Tom Arnold without Rosie was enough to turn them off from watching anything. I think it's just the opposite; I wouldn't watch Rosie but he's not so bad away from her. I was surprised at the Christmas movie I saw him in, two years ago, I think. He wasn't bad and he still isn't. He's not afraid to laugh at himself and we liked this new twist of the plot and the actors. You would never expect Christmas past to be as he was in this movie but we've watched this one twice and will probably watch it again before the season is over.",1384300800,,773,4.125827814569536
2655051,4,B000ICLRGG,I loves to watch Christmas movies every year.  And this movie is very funny and good movie.  I would recommend this to everyone who enjoy Christmas movies.,1368230400,,155,4.703703703703703
