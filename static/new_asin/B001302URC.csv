3101219,3,B001302URC,"Back in 1983, I saw a preview for this film on some VHS tape. I was 7 years old at the time. I remember seeing some, gloved, maniac getting ready to drill a hole in some woman's head. I went to the video store on the corner, looking for this video. Unfortunately they didn't have it, and I rented ""Halloween III"" instead. Ironically enough, ""Halloween III) also has a drill kill scene.

Almost 30 years later here I am watching ""Boarding House"" and my lord what a schlock fest this film is. Cheesy, horrendous acting, atrocious dialogue but so much fun to watch. It really looks like a few people just got together, got really hammered and said ""Let's make a horror film"".

Honestly, the plot was pretty hard for me to figure out. I don't know if I wanted to figure it out. This is one you have to see to believe. Not only because of how cheesy, and unique it is, but also because of how bad it is. I have never seen a film like this, and I've been watching horror films for 30 years.

Interesting, fun, boring, weird, and ridiculous would be a few adjectives to descrive this ""film"". Suggestion, get a 6 pack ready for this film. You're gonna need it.

Enjoy!",1319587200,6,1160,4.331797235023042
3101220,5,B001302URC,"I enjoyed this movie when I was younger because of how horrible it was.  After getting the VHS it is still one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  So why the 5 stars?  You don't see movies like this much anymore - Bad acting, random nudity, cheesy camera effects, mistakenly created humour, random nudity oh, and did I mention random nudity?  If you grew up watching ""USA Up All Night"" with Gilbert Gottfried and enjoyed it, this movie is worthwhile.  If you're looking for something scary or frightening, best look elsewhere...  This isn't it.

The PROS of this movie are;
The psychedelic hand in glove that appears right before a death scene.
The constant scenes of people wearing leather gloves like the mysterious killer.
The power of Telekinesis and how those who use it, use it.
The acting, or lack thereof.
The excessive use of blood.
The guy who dies in a pool towards the beginning for no obvious reason.
The extremely annoying typing on an 80's computer which you are gratefully is gone after the credits BUT then it comes back at the end of the movie.

The CONS of this movie are;
No chase scenes at all, only in a dream sequence so it did not count in my book.
Not enough 80's music - especially crucial considering one of them is supposed to be a rockstar.",1296345600,7,1270,4.491304347826087
3101221,5,B001302URC,"I recommend this film to anyone who wants to laugh until their stomach muscles ache.  I first saw it, about 10 years ago, at a screening at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, presented by Bill Landis, author of Sleazoid Express, an excellent book on exploitation cinema.  ""Modern Art"" aptly describes this shot-on-video time capsule of awful early-1980s clothing, hairstyles, computer graphics, and extremely cheesy music and pathetic ""special effects"".  The end result?

A masterpiece of horror that defies description.  Throw in the most ridiculous script, dialogue and acting outside of an Ed Wood or H.G. Lewis film -- and you're in for a wild ride!  We were falling out of our seats at the SF MOMA, shaking with uncontrollable laughter, and dumbstruck with awe that Boardinghouse was ever made, that it actually existed in the same universe as our own.

A recent (shaky) on-camera interview with director Wintergate and star Kalassu is interesting chiefly for their attempt to convince us that the film was meant to be a spoof -- and that their efforts at parody were overruled by the producer, who apparently believe Boardinghouse would work better as a serious horror movie!  I'm not sure what to believe.

The transfer quality is about what you'd expect -- high-def digital video cameras didn't exist in 1982 -- and the filmmakers claim this was shot in ""broadcast-quality"" video, then transferred to 35mm celluloid for theatrical projection.  Huh.  Most of it still manages to look as if they used consumer-grade equipment typical of the time.  This disc was apparently transferred off the original video source material, so it's certainly watchable (as well as laughable).

Don't take my word for it: rent or buy this movie, and you will realize that your life could never be complete until you've seen Boardinghouse -- and stay with it right until the mind-melting, soul-shattering, bloodcurdling finale: FOCUS!  WHITE LIGHT!  FOCUS!  WHITE LIGHT!",1266192000,10,1963,5.1257861635220126
3101222,4,B001302URC,"BOARDINGHOUSE is the kind of horror movie that is very rarely made anymore and is even more rarely appreciated for the out of touch with reality entertainment it offers. To put the movie in the right perspective the viewer has to watch it in the frame of mind that someone would have encountered it in 1981, stumbling into a Drive-in or grindhouse theater, probably assisted by some mind altering medication and being side swiped by this deviant blast of Northern Californication Occultic blarny. Boardinghouse takes you head, twists off the top and does unmentionable things to your gelatin matter whether you like it or not. The movie ENJOYS making a mess of your brain on a fifty cent budget.

Sure the acting is bad, the videography hurts your eyes at times, and the singing by the star is out of whack. But all of this adds up to the experience of being from an entirely different planet. A planet where a middle aged occult hustler just needs to put an ad in the Sunday paper to get a half dozen babes to move in with him and at the height of his powers can make a bar of soap zoom around the bath tub with his mind! It has boobs, gore and video generated shadow monsters! It was only the second movie ever to be shot on commercial video and released to theaters (the first being Frank Zappa's 200 MOTELS) so for that alone it is a landmark.

It is movies like BOARDINGHOUSE that separate real cult/exploitation film fans from the tourists who just watch the ""cool"" stuff that Fangoria or Maxim would feel safe recommending. Loving real trash like this alienates people, but once you get past that feeling that is where the real gems are.

8248667,5,B001302URC,"""Boarding House"" - 1982 - The first Shot On Video Horror. It was this fact alone that enticed me to seek out and purchase this movie. I was not disappointed! Many paths in Horror/Exploitation from genre to sub genre can bring you to some very interesting and mind melting places....
The 80's Horror S.O.V. rabbit hole is a wild ride, which chronologically begins here! The characters are great, I felt like I personally knew them all. John Wintergate is perfect in the lead role, there is always girls on screen, the blood flows and the laughs rumble.
""Boarding House"" is a perfect snap shot of independent horror in the early 80's, a shot on video time capsule. ""Boarding House"" has everything an S.O.V. horror should have. 10/10
I loved it!
The bonus features on this DVD  bring even more charm to the movie. Interviews and extras allow us insight to the lives of the film makers who made it. John Wintergate and his wife Kalassu are both wonderfully talented. This couple has been married and making creations since the 70's. Check out their band LightStorm!",1455840000,3,1061,4.735135135135135

8248672,4,B001302URC,"As mentioned in the commentary, this 80s trash movie was filmed on broadcast video. While some 80s horror flicks will appeal to a large audience, this isn't one of them. Although it's bizarre and somewhat unique in parts, it will bore many. The story involves a guy with strong psychic powers, a cursed boarding house, and a never fully seen insane mental patient (or maybe he's possessed by the boarding house ghost,or he is actually the ghost wearing black gloves) who has bizarre psychic powers and has escaped from an institution. This never fully seen maniac or demon basically makes weird breathing noises and motions with his hands to unleash these powers to kill. Some of the stuff he does is make the intestines of one guy fall out through his shirt, makes another girl bleed, and another woman's eyes bulge and fall out. The haunted house is causing problems as well, with stuff like a bloody shower hallucination and other stuff. There's a decent body count, and the film has good looking women with plenty of nudity; there's some flashes of full frontal. One thing that I thought really stands out is the electronic sounding music which is excellent; the film is so cheap, but it has got a very well done main score. The ending of the film showcases a psychic fight between the good guy and the boarding house ghost, and it's particularly cheesy and funny with atrocious acting; this is a memorable scene of bad filmmaking. The problem with the flick is that it has some boring filler scenes in between the nudity and violence, but I still really like it because it's a memorable piece of cheese and bad cinema.

The DVD quality on this release from CODE RED is pretty good considering it's such a cheap video movie from the 80s, but I'm a little disappointed. It would've been more enjoyable with better quality. The commentary is good and there's the excellent main soundtrack playing during the menu screen.",1372896000,6,1922,4.737313432835821
8248673,4,B001302URC,"Recently I decided I'd try to get my hands on some of the more obscure shot-on-video horror films.  Having just missed the opportunity to order this film while in print, I spent the extra money to order the DVD (very expensive).  Was it worth it?  Well, yes and no.  While I understand why people jack up the price when something goes out of print, I also think it's a bit of a kick-in-the-teeth for horror fans.  I digress, BoardingHouse is a solid film if watched in the right frame of mind.  It's sort of a mishmash of gore, sleaze and humour.  It's shot on video so the picture quality is essentially crap but for what it is, Code Red did a great job.  It's worth getting for those who loved renting the big box VHS tapes in the 80's since BoardingHouse is such a nostalgia trip to that era of filmmaking.  If you like gratuitous gore, nudity combined with a fairly steady acid trip, this is well worth a purchase.  Just be prepared to spend a fairly large chunk of money as it OOP.",1339459200,7,986,4.309782608695652
