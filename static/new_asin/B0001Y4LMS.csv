First came black men, then came black women, Latino men, and working-class white men.  In this tape, lesbian comics take the torch.  So I was wondering why didn't the artists name this ""Lesbian Queens of Comedy"" like the title ""(Black Male) Kings of Comedy.""  If Larry the Cable Guy and his buddies made ""Blue Collar Comedy Tour"", then why not call this project ""Labrys Comedy Tour"" or something?

What I found out was that this comedy tour was different.  Instead of just having the comics do their entire routines and then passing the mike.  This DVD cuts between the various comediennes telling one or two jokes at a time.  BET's ""Comic View"" often uses this same format.  In this work, however, the women are also interviewed talking about their girlhoods, families, and lives as openly lesbian comics.

Melissa Etheridge makes a quick guest appearance.  It's practically like no lesbian art can get produced without her stamp of endorsement.  On the Ellen coming-out episode, she and Ellen laughed saying, ""Now that you are out, you get a free toaster.""  In so many ways, Melissa, as much as I love her, has become that free toaster.  She even stares into the camera with a ""Okay, am I done now?"" type of look.

This work is more about life as a lesbian comic than the comedy itself.  I think the purpose is to encourage more lesbian comics to come out more than just to entertain any person who happens to rent or buy the tape.  In their interviews, the comics talk about sexism and homophobia in the comedy circuit.  Surprisingly, each comic said that as much as they love Ellen DeGeneres, doors shut after she came out.  The media only wanted one lesbian comic.  Though these women had been performing for years, they were instantly dismissed as ""Ellen imitators.""  Progressives of all genders and sexualities will want to hear about this.

There is the huge theme of permanence and continuity in this work.  All the comics say they have been out in their careers forever.  They have been in the business for ages.  They all had girlfriends since way, way, way back when.  They all came from families with entertaining relatives.  They even show a photo of the four artists from a decade ago.  They even show that Marga Gomez has had that huge gap in her teeth forever.  I'm not sure why the producers of this tape definitely wanted to send the message ""This is how it's always been!""

Sometimes the interviews with the comics are funnier than their standup routines.  At times, you can't even hear what Susan Westhoefer is saying.  Kate Clinton is cut!  She must work out hard in the gym.  The tape only reveals the highly sexual or highly political jokes toward the end.

I have mixed feelings in a way.  I loved seeing Marga Gomez at a San Francisco comedy club years ago.  I loved how she was the gay community's comedic secret.  So there's a way in which personal idols are being taken into the mainstream by this tape.  However, each comedienne is incredibly talented and this work will make all types of viewers ask, ""Why aren't these women getting more jobs and exposure in Hollywood!?""

In many ways this tape is meant to say, ""There's more than just Ellen.""  In expansion, ""there's more than just Ellen, Rosie, and Lea DeLaria.""  These women are great and this was amusing to watch.",1106784000,11,3451,4.691151919866444

8018152,5,B0001Y4LMS,"Some before they are on stage shots, so very honest comments.  Some on stage stuff which is very funny and more would have been fabulous.  I was a little disappointed about the quantity of performance.  I guess this is a great tease of very talented people.  Ill have to but more of their works sigh hahaha.",1397779200,,307,4.428571428571429
8018153,2,B0001Y4LMS,It was more like a documentary than anything and they talked about their personal issues vs. other comics trials.  It lacked more jokes and just seemed too much like a documentary.,1391299200,,180,4.806451612903226
8018154,5,B0001Y4LMS,"There was a lot of interviews on here, which is fine, I would have liked to see more of these ladies stand up routines though.",1373328000,,126,4.08
8018155,5,B0001Y4LMS,"This DVD provides something for everyone! We highly recommend buying this DVD and we thank Amazon for offering it as this small town only sells current, main-stream shoot-em-up type movies, LOL. This DVD would make a great present to give to that friend or loved one in your life! It's a good mix of uniquely-different comedians and their own personal topics blended with commonalities such as pride, commitment to deliver THE best comedy for all people, and a genuine respect for one another! DVD contains sufficient material to give you a glimpse into 'how each woman came to be a Comedian as well as lengthy video of their on-stage performance, unique talent and intelligence. As a person who appreciates intelligent and thought-provoking humor, these Comedians deliver and do so with a Punch!- they combine real life situations and observances with a creative humorous twist... which will leave you thinking about their perspective when you, yourself, encounter such a situation. After having watched this DVD, my family respects these women even more now and I hope more people will support their efforts and obvious incredible talent. On a personal note, I'd like to see more of Marga Gomez as she is not well known but she has great potential, is incredibly funny and talks about things that most of us only think about.",1346889600,,1327,4.981981981981982
8018156,3,B0001Y4LMS,"Yes, it was great to see four lesbian stand-up comics.  I wanted to see THEIR STAND-UP COMEDY ROUTINES!!!  The interviews were well-done; there wasn't enough of their comedy routines, and that was disappointing.  I'm glad I hadn't bought this DVD or I really would've been upset (thank you Netflix).",1240012800,,299,5.061224489795919
8018157,5,B0001Y4LMS,All of these wimmin are so funny and I also liked the storytelling/background aspect of the DVD. They talk alot about how they got involved in comedy in the beginning and how hard its been as a lesbian comedian I highly recommend this title.,1126569600,,241,4.5
8018158,5,B0001Y4LMS,"Strap your boots on and let these four ground-breaking, hilarious lesbian comedians take you for a ride. Kate Clinton, Karen Williams, Marga Gomez, and Suzanne Westenhoefer star in this well-made documentary that alternates between brilliant interviews and on-stage clips from their stand-up shows.

Both the interviews and the clips will leave your belly aching from laughter and your eyes opened to the political and humorous landscape of lesbian stand-up in the 80s and 90s, also known as the pre-Ellen Degeneres years. These women were and are

true revolutionaries. Their only tools? Being queer and making people laugh about being queer. And their

brilliant.

Gay, straight, man, woman, anyone: this film is not only politically educational and inspiring, it's simply hilarious.",1121817600,2,785,5.516666666666667
