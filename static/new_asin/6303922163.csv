724480,5,6303922163,"1966's ""Kaleidoscope"" was called the ""switched-on thriller"" and the fabulous camera work of Christopher Challis (who was the director of photography on ""Return from the Ashes"") with fashionable camera tricks and kaleidoscopic dissolves, the kind of thing Stanley Donen used to clever effect in his kind of sequel to his immensely successful ""Charade,"" 1966's ""Arabesque"" to less success.  Although ""Kaleidoscope"" too depends heavily on the chemistry of its stars, in this case, Warren Beatty (at the time in his career when he did things like ""Promise Her Anything"") and Susannah York and they have a surprising appeal together, its director, Jack Smight, was not as well-known and this is perhaps his highlight for me, although he also directed ""Harper"" and ""No Way to Treat a Lady.""  He was later responsible for a lot of television including the TV-remake of ""Double Indemnity.""  Written deftly by newcomers Robert and Jane Howard-Carrington and the music by Stanley Myers is especially wonderful (see my review of the CD soundtrack), the intricate plot, but not overly so, involves Beatty as a playboy who breaks into a playing card factory and marks the designs so he can win at cards in all the best European casinos.  York, a fashion designer running a boutique where clients seen trying on her designs include Jane Birkin in mod, swinging London is really the daughter of a Scotland Yard inspector played by Clive Revill who wants Beatty to beat Eric Porter, a villain called ""Dominion,"" who traffics in drugs and crime and is quite nasty, at cards and break him of his stranglehold on his financial reign of his syndicates.  The results is very exciting and quite comical, an entertaining movie that everyone involved brings off.  York is especially good, as are Stanley Myers and Christopher Challis.  Warner Archive brought this to DVD and the result is as usual exceptional.  A fine romantic comedy/crime thriller.",1340064000,3,1926,5.092063492063492
724481,4,6303922163,"The first half of this film is riveting, and Warren Beatty is perfectly cast in his role as a rich gambler who stacks his card decks in a way we've never seen on screen before. He's breathlessly cool, suave and debonair, with just the right amount of jaded sarcasm thrown in to be believable. (I personally believe that the TV series 'It Takes A Thief' was modeled after this film, in the same way that 'Mission Impossible' was forged from 'Topkapi').

Now Susannah York, well, she's a bit of a problem for me, as she's annoyingly two-dimensional in a 60's sort of way that's both irritating and unrealistically simple. None of the fashions from the era do her a bit of justice either, which is difficult to believe, as stylings from that era were made to highlight a female form like no decade since. She comes off as a ditzy, 60's Meg Ryan (as if Meg wasn't ditzy enough) - not my cup of tea at all.

The second half of the flick gets too mired down in the card game, and while it does promote tension and suspense, it drags on for too long; especially since you kind of know what the outcome will be long before it arrives. It is a good film, but I'd never call it great as other reviewers have. The picture is splendid, though it does have its fair share of blemishes for a WB Archive flick at these Criterion prices, but the kaleidoscopic effects and title sequence by Maurice Binder (who did all the James Bond title sequences) are thoroughly entertaining in a smashing 60's way.

All things considered, I enjoyed this cult film a good bit, just couldn't love it the way I wanted to. Maybe you will...",1286582400,6,1607,4.422297297297297
724482,4,6303922163,"A great opening hook and some solid plot twists (maybe a bit reminiscent of the novel Casino Royale) and only one curious lull where the action stops dead for a long introduction of the villain of the piece. Great swinging 60s London and Paris locales -- and cars! And the whole thing is fueled by Beatty and angel-faced York's having actual romantic chemistry! They make a terrific pair. (Less convincing is the relationship between York and her ""father"" -- Clive Revill -- who's only 9 years older than the actress.)",1281830400,5,518,4.766666666666667
724483,4,6303922163,"I totally agree with these reviewers: ""Kaleidoscope"" needs to be on DVD because the writing is on the wall and that is: Movies on CD's are here to stay. My estimation is that it will come out sometime next year as part of a Warren Beatty box set that Warner Brothers has been doing the last two years since as you know ""Bonnie and Clyde"" is most likely to be re-released on DVD to celebrate its 40th anniversary (yikes!) and be in that set.

7854728,4,6303922163,"I saw this movie on TV back in the 70s. I always remembered it because it is based on such a fun idea; A gambler with skills breaks into the factory that makes the cards for the casino. Once inside, he alters the plates that print the cards. As a result, every card in every deck sent to the casino is marked and this enables him to win every time he plays.

Over the years, I looked for this movie on TV and tried to find the DVD for sale. Until recently, I was unsuccessful. However, now that I have the DVD, I know why this movie remained buried for so many years: Its a movie with a great central idea but the script was terrible.
With a good script and an update, I think this movie would be a hit. Somebody should do a remake.",1496707200,,732,4.013698630136986

This movie hit the American screens in 1966 and 67 with the influx of European action movies like Tapkapi, Goldfinger, The Liquidator with Rod Taylor and Casino Royale with Peter Sellers.  All pay tribute to the MOD 60s with a tongue and cheek nod toward that notable occupation of gambling.  Warren Beatty plays a handsome, young, rich American who's main goal in life is to win at cards, even if he has to cheat.  Susannah York plays a swinging dress designer who latches on to Beatty's character for reasons other than just her attraction to him.

7854737,4,6303922163,"""Kaleidoscope""
(Warner Brother, 1966)

Note: mild spoilers below. Don't freak out.

A hunky, young, surprisingly svelte Warren Beatty stars opposite an equally delicious Susannah York in this stylish comedy-thriller set in Swinging London at the edge of the psychedelic era. Beatty plays a debonair, thrill-junkie con man who rigs the odds in casinos across Europe, but gets nabbed by an Interpol cop with an agenda of his own. The tone of the film is pretty lighthearted, and the main attraction is its overall stylishness, with flashy, showy cinematography from Christopher Challis with lots of glamorous shots of various European locales, bookended with goofy psychedelic visual motifs, along with lots of great '60s fashion, classic cars and decor. The plot drags a bit in the second half -- a lot of slow-moving stuff about playing poker -- but the movie has several delightfully quirky performances and good repartee. The playful tone will be familiar to fans of films such as ""Our Man Flint,"" and TV shows such ""Mission Impossible"" and ""I Spy."" Overall, a nice mod-era period piece.
