3831952,5,B0021FP322,"My 2-year-old loves watching Shaun.  Since they don't speak, he uses his imagination to interject words.  The claymation is amazing and the extra features are interesting.",1248134400,,171,5.538461538461538
3831953,5,B0021FP322,"We are big fans of Wallace & Grommit and had to order the latest of DVDs of those characters, Shaun the Sheep.  Our hero has the same facial expressions that Grommit uses to convey what he's thinking.  He takes good care of all the herd,  His eyes are irresistable and that cute oversized tail!  All the farm animals, Farmer,etc are clever and in my opinion original.  Adults  enjoy Nick Park's  creations  as much as children.",1247443200,,427,4.6
3831954,5,B0021FP322,Shaun the Sheep is so creative and entertaining.  Our 3-year-old adores the compilation of short 8 minute clips of Shaun and the rest of the barnyard gang.  This is well worth the cost.,1247097600,,185,4.575757575757576
3831955,5,B0021FP322,"Shuan the Sheep: Sheep on the Loose is the third DVD of the 40 episode Shaun the Sheep series.  This DVD has 6 episodes and 2 special features.  My daughter, who is 2 1/2 years old, loves these DVDs and Sheep on the Loose is no exception. The stories are each 5-8 minutes long and they are entertaining for the child and the adult as well. Very clever claymation. Highly recommended.",1246579200,,383,4.380281690140845
3831956,5,B0021FP322,"Another great entry in the Shaun the Sheep library, with six super adventures of Shaun being Shaun. Contains his best episode:  Saturday Night Shaun.  Can't be beat.  Will be enjoyed by children and adults alike -- I promise!  Shaun is the best!!  (O.K., maybe I'm a little biased.)",1246579200,,282,4.791666666666667
3831957,5,B0021FP322,A delightful collection of adventures and situations in the Wallace & Gromit / Shaun tradition that will please and tickle anyone's fancy. For kids and kids at heart. Every time you watch it you see something you missed.,1246060800,,220,4.815789473684211
3831958,5,B0021FP322,"Young and young-at-heart fans of ""Shaun the Sheep"" are going to love the newest adventures of the little sheep and his friends. With six features, each six minutes long, ""Sheep on the Loose"" is shorter that the others in the series, but it makes up for it in leaps and bounds with the ten additional minutes (not listed) of great, never before seen bonus features on the making of Shaun.

The adventures include:

* Sheep on the Loose - Shaun tries to keep the farmer from finding out his whole herd has disappeared after hitching a ride to the town fair.
* Saturday Night Shaun - an old record player and disco music are an invitation for party time at the barn.
* Tidy Up - It's cleaning day at the farm. Shaun and the gang have a run in with THE most powerful vacuum cleaner ever.
* Shaun the Farmer - Farmer's sick and his dog is taking care of him and must delegate. Or so he says. See what happens when Shaun takes over the chores at the farm.
* Camping Chaos - Never set up camp and go off hiking when sheep are around.
* If You Can't Stand the Heat - A warm wooly coat and a farmer enjoying a cool dip in the pool are a recipe for mayhem.

The bonus features include ""Building a Pig"", a 6-minute real-time workshop with children (8 years old or so) on how to make one of the pigs using plasticine (google ""home plasticine"" to make an easy homemade version or buy a whole set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Plasticine-Master-Crafter/dp/B000GDMIC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Plasticine Master Crafter</a>). The children all enjoyed it and it was easy to follow along, with pretty good results.

This was followed by ""The Mini Making of Shaun"", a step by step mini-documentary of how the features are made, including the storyboard phase, using computers, the making of the models with a moveable skeleton inside to let them move, building of the sets, how they get everything to look so real, and the use of stop motion animation.

Don't be put off by the length. At 48 minutes total, it's right up there with other kid DVDs. Moreover, I have newfound respect for this type of labor-intensive clay animation after finding out it took 12 shots, each time moving the figure a tiny bit, to get just 1 second of footage. That's 4,320 pictures to get just one 6 minute feature!

My toddler loved the adventures and kept giggling throughout, but didn't really care for the extras (he's too young but an older child would probably like this). I loved the bonus features and learning all the secrets behind bringing the barnyard gang to life. Funny kid-friendly story lines, great extras, excellent quality overall. Can't get better than that!",1244678400,27,2685,4.7387580299785865
3831959,3,B0021FP322,"I love the Shaun the Sheep shorts and the shorts on this DVD are as good as the previous 2 DVDs.  Note, however, that unlike the first two DVDs, this DVD only has 6 episodes and not 8.  I hope that this isn't a new trend for these DVDs.

The episodes on this DVD are:  Sheep on the Loose, Saturday Night Shaun, Tidy Up, Shaun the Farmer, Camping Chaos, and If You Can't Stand the Heat.  There are also a couple of features:  The Mini Making of Shaun (a quickie look at how an episode is made) and Building a Pig (sort of a demonstration of how to build a model of one of the pigs using plasticine).

I wish that the series had been released as a complete set in the US (as it was elsewhere).",1244505600,14,691,4.0

3831997,3,B0021FP322,"""Shaun the Sheep: Sheep on the Loose"" is the third DVD release of episodes of ""Shaun the Sheep"". It has 6 episodes, where Shaun and the other sheep get into adventures. I did not enjoy this third DVD as much as the second, because the comedy has become too broad. As TV shows age, they tend to become too over the top, like Fonzie jumping the shark in ""Happy Days"". Cartoons need to follow some set of rules to be entertaining, like cartoonist Chuck Jones imposing the rule that the Road Runner could only run on roads. In this third DVD, I felt that Shaun and his fellow sheep could now do anything for the sake of comedy, and weren't following any rules. The DVD includes a short making of featurette.
