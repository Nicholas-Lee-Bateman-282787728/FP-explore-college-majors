7561865,3,B0192PERWU,"Thank you Cinedigm for sending us this movie to review!

Does a Bible Club belong in a public school?  Thats the premise of the movie Gods Club.  Christine Evans was getting pushback from launching Gods Club at the Echo Grove high school in Vermont.  This small community has a number of outspoken (and often jerkish) atheist families who are trying to stop the club from launching.  Her husband reluctantly supports her efforts, but doesnt get too involved until she dies suddenly.

Michael Evans (Stephen Baldwin) takes his wifes death pretty badly and holes himself up in his house for twelve weeks (often wearing the same shirt).  His nearly angelic teenage daughter tried to get him out of the house without much success.  One of his colleagues (Corbin Bernsen) pays him a friendly visit and reminds him that he could lose his job altogether if he doesnt return to work soon.  To inspire him, he suggests that Michael launches the Bible club in his wifes honor. And he does so, not anticipating the uphill battles ahead.

At first the Bible club has a few members and a couple of them joined up just to heckle the teacher.  Other students are positively impacted by the gospel and it stirs up trouble with their non-believing parents.  One of the parents is a lawyer (Lorenzo Lamas) and is looking for any creative way to shut down the club for good.  Some of the students resort to vandalism to let Gods Club know that they are not welcome as well.

With so much stacked against them, Michael and his daughter press on with the club realizing that their lives, jobs, and reputations are on the line.  But their faith is strong and unwavering as Psalm 62 proclaims.  Other verses quoted include Mark 11:25 and Romans 8:28.

While a bit corny and stereotypical at times, there were some enjoyable moments in Gods Club.  Im in no rush to see it again nor am I eager to loan it out to fellow believers telling them that its a must see.  Overall its a decent film. However, I certainly won't be handing it out to non-believers because of how they are portrayed in it.",1457827200,3,2068,4.601092896174864

7561869,4,B0192PERWU,"It's the age old debate of separation of church and state. Does that apply to after hours clubs at schools? The parents at Michael Evans school seem to think so and when he tries to start the God's Club that was his late wife's hearts desire; it stirs up a lot of trouble.

Trying to get over the loss of his wife, Evens and his daughter find new purpose in the club and fight to keep it. They are both persecuted for this as the Bible says Christians will be. His classroom is vandalized by some bullies and a fire is started outside their home. They don't want to give up on something they know is changing hearts, even as others oppose them.

The story takes place in Vermont which always makes me nostalgic for my East Coast roots. Baldwin is convincing as a grieving widower but I think his daughter steals the show. She is bullied but stands firm and doesn't give in to them, even though her father loses his temper on more then one occasion.

God's Club is a great reminder that fighting for our faith can be a struggle but one well worth it if you follow through.

7561878,2,B0192PERWU,"I like good clean movies that tell the story about Christian characters who have good Biblical values and demonstrate a strong faith in God and overcome adversity.  That's why we selected God's Club.  I'm disappointed to say this movie was not very good.

Of biggest concern is the movie is not very well grounded in Christian theology.  It really missed the mark and was not Scripturally sound.  It was Gospel light.  Secondly, the movie was not very well written, nor were the characters well developed and some of the acting was weak.  Some of the characters seemed one dimensional.  You don't have to have a big budget action packed movie to make a good movie.  You need a good story that is well written and well acted.

The storyline had some promise as did the relationship between the dad and his daughter.  The young lady who played the daughter Rebecca was pretty good as was the actor that played Nic.

I know that most Christian movies aren't going to be blockbuster movies.  But I believe, as a Christian you ought to do the very best you can.  If you are making a movie, make the best movie you can.  You have an obligation to make sure that the theology lines up with the Bible.

God's Club fell far short in many ways.",1475193600,,1234,4.490990990990991

7561882,2,B0192PERWU,"A Christian high school teacher (Stephen Baldwin) starts an extracurricular Bible club, which angers the town's militant non-Christians. The antagonists respond by starting fights with the teacher and his daughter, vandalizing his classroom, and even firebombing his house with a Molotov cocktail. In the end, however, the teacher's mildly emotional speech at a school board meeting prompts a sudden change of heart and the antagonists join the club.

This movie is poorly written and poorly acted, but perhaps its most glaring fault is the exaggerated character of the conflict between the Christians and the non-Christians. If you are a Christian and are suffering from some degree of persecution complex, you may well enjoy this movie. Otherwise you will probably find it intolerably unrealistic.",1472083200,,799,5.495934959349594

It depicts what we as Christians have to do to stand up for the God we believe in and the struggles we will face as Christian's being persecuted for our beliefs. Not everyone has the same beliefs but if you believe in God and want to stand strong for your beliefs this movie will show you how a young girl did just that even when her father wanted to give up.

7561900,4,B0192PERWU,"I had been both looking forward to watching this movie and slightly nervous. Course that always comes with a new movie that I don't know anything about.

This movie was suspenseful and had me on the edge of my seat several times. Overall, it shows the struggles that some people are claiming are non-existent. I loved the moral of the story, which was basically... endure and persevere. Stand firm in your faith, stand and be strong in God.

Summary:
A tragic loss has hit home for the Evans family. The loss of the mother/wife of the family. She had one dying wish. That her husband, Michael (played by Stephen Baldwin), would continue the Bible Club they founded together. This is no easy task, because some of the parent's want the Club gone. Maybe even the Evans that are running it.

In conclusion:
This movie was real. You could believe that it was something that was actually happening and you were getting to view it as it happened.",1462924800,6,940,4.616766467065868

7561909,2,B0192PERWU,"This movie does a disservice to Christians wanting to use it to evangelize family and friends. There is zero gospel presentation, scriptures are ripped out of the bible and twisted, characters in the movie are blasphemous to our Lord and Savior. The main character, the teacher seems to not know what in the world he is talking about when he starts talking about the bible. The acting itself is very subpar. All around just not a good movie. I applaud the Christian entertainment industry for putting movies out there that are safe to watch with kids, that don't have sex and cursing, so thanks for that.
