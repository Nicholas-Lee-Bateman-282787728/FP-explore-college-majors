8128385,5,B000G1ALVQ,"Ordered ""used"" double pack 2-movie DVD set at about 1/2 off Thurs Mar 19 - Recd Wed 3/25. Movies fun and very enjoyable & great to revisit these 2 stories & watch the actresses who did such a fine job --esp Kirsten Dunst in her earlier days. The DVDs and covers were in excellent (even ""new""-type) conditon --and they were well-packed!
