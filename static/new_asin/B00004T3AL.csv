1349044,5,B00004T3AL,"Whenever I need a laugh I put this in and sit back to watch a comic genius display his timing and quickness of mind. Red considered a script to be a general outline rather than a rigid box he was required to stay within. Watch closely and you'll see the light in his eyes as he leaps to take advantage of an opening, and see his co-stars and others react to his riffs on the matter at hand. Some of them are quick enough to play along, some can only laugh. In my book, when you can cause as great a comic as Harpo Marx to nearly lose control from laughter then you're doing something right.",1122163200,21,590,4.094827586206897
1349045,1,B00004T3AL,I agree with the other reviewers.  Avoid this one at all costs.  Picture quality is that of a VHS tape recorded at EP speed about 100 times.  An insult to a very funny man's legacy.,1093737600,3,181,4.114285714285714
1349046,1,B00004T3AL,The video and sound was very very poor.  A sad commentary on just a great man.  Why include the songs.  One bought this to see Red not the song and dance group.  The DVD was not indexed so you couldn't skip.  I wanted a DVD of his best skits.  This was just some shows and not even his best.  Avoid this DVD like the plague.  You will be very disappointed.,1056758400,13,356,3.9857142857142858
1349047,1,B00004T3AL,This set was even worse than Remembering Red.... very poor video quality and alot of tape wasted on commercial breaks. There were so many cherished episodes; where did they dig these bombs up? You still need to add 0 stars to the rating choice.,1014940800,22,244,4.568181818181818
1349048,1,B00004T3AL,"I love Red Skelton, the VHS tapes of some of his best shows have a great quality to them, so you would think that the DVD would at least be better.  Well, this DVD set has the worst picture quality I have every seen.
The only redeeming quality was seeing John Wayne with Red Skelton.

1349050,1,B00004T3AL,"The quality of this DVD (and I use the word quality loosly) is horrible. It's worse than the worst scratchy old video tape. Red Skelton is GREAT, and seeing JOHN WAYNE in a comedy sketch was fun, however, its nearly impossible to get past the poor visual quality. Very blurry. Ugly.

1349101,3,B00004T3AL,"This budget collection contains ten random (public domain?) episodes of ""The Red Skelton Show"" from 1955 to 1964, so these all originally aired on CBS--no NBC episodes. [There is no information on individual episodes, but the Look Magazine Movie Awards show (Jack Lemmon, Alfred Hitchcock, Walt Disney among the recipients) aired in March of 1955. There was also an episode where Red and Archie Moore don Beatle wigs to introduce a guest.] Some of the episodes are 30 minutes; others are 60 minutes.

These episodes feature beloved characters like Clem Kadiddlehopper, Cauliflower McPugg, Freddie the Freeloader and San Fernando Red; along with guest stars such as Vincent Price, Nancy Walker and Martha Raye--and, of course, David Rose and His Orchestra. Some of the opening sponsor promotions are left in, so you see commercials for such items as Pet-Ritz frozen pies and Johnson Wax Glo-Coat.

I don't know what the original source tapes are for these episodes, but they're pretty rough. (That's why I docked the rating one star.) They are all black-and-white. On the first episode, the sound and the action were about a half second out of sync. It was not a problem with the other nine episodes. Picture quality was about what I remember watching these as a kid on my parents 24-inch black-and-white TV set. [Note: For much of these episodes there is a Platinum Disc Corporation logo in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen.]

It was fun to see these old shows again. There is certainly a nostalgia factor to these old shows. I had given this set to my dad years ago and came across them again recently while cleaning out the house. Red Skelton harkens back to a time when other like-minded comedians such as Bob Hope and George Burns didn't have to be raunchy to be funny. And Skelton would always sign off each episode with ""Goodbye for now and may God bless.""",1418601600,,1872,4.825545171339564

I loved it then but since my vcr fell into the cave man era I could no longer watch this special. Now here it is a class act comedy in a current day format. I got to show some young people of today the master at work with his silent pantomime and they stared at the screen with wide eyes, laughing and asked for more when it was done. I dug through some other dvd's and showed them funny face at work as many characters. When they visit now they ask to see it again. Red made audiences around the world laugh with simple, clean down to earth comedy and true professionalism, an art lost today. He loved his audience and showed it. This is comedy for all ages.",1398643200,,759,4.066666666666666
1349121,5,B00004T3AL,"If you are looking for a comedy act of todays dynamics with lots of 4 letter words and huge stage presence this is not for you. If you want to see a class act for comedy with one of the most versatile comedians that ever walked our planet this is a must see. Red always had a great stage presence in his tv show, leaving the script making his guests loose their place if the show, even laughing at his own actions and jokes. He carried a list of characters with him to every show that were made real with his simple actions and a costume that may consist of a hat, his fluffed up hair, an invisible fishing pole and fish yet you got the simple real world humor from such simple actions. The man appreciated the simple things in life with the goal of making everyone laugh. He made fun of simple situations in stand up comedy jokes, skits with guest stars, and simple one on one actions in such a way that his jokes could be used again and again but always made you laugh. Red respected his character and his audience from his opening line through to his sign off mesage.
This is old film footage so a lot less of quality than a 1080p HD blue ray disc of today. Some of the footage is rough but it does not take away from one of the funiest men that ever lived. I love live comedy and have been to many shows in my life and i must say i have so much love and respect for this very talented man. The show is excellent Red Skelton work, characters are great and watching his view on the American Pledge of Allegiance is even more applicable today than it was when he performed it. This is a statement from a true performer that loved his trade, his people and the contry that gave him the freedom to practice his comedy without the fear of recourse.

It was a different era back then and it's nice to see Red miming and bringing back his old characters. Part of the fun is hearing Red laugh at his own jokes. In life he was known as a very nice man and it shows in his warm performances . Sometimes I need a break from all the  dirty jokes and insensitive comments in todays comedy .

Another reviewer commented that it was dated, citing a reference to Cassius Clay, he thought it came out in 1981 but I remember seeing it in the 60's (Miss Garson's costume choices are also from the early 60's). It sticks in my memory because Red's Freddie and Jackie Gleason's Poor Soul were my favorites especially at Christmas. That same reviewer commented about another Freddie special. It is titled ""Freddie the Freeloader's Christmas Dinner"". It was broadcast on HBO in 1981 and then rebroadcast on PBS in the early 90's when I recorded it on vhs. Along with Red, it stars Vincent Price, Imogen Coca and a very cute dog who might be the original Benji (there's no mention of the dog in the credits so I can't say for certain but the dog is well trained). Unfortunately it has never been released on dvd (or even vhs) as near as I can tell. I transfered my home vhs to dvd as soon as that technology was available to me and endure the less than perfect quality every year because it is my favorite. I will continue to search in the hope that the Red Skelton estate releases an official version on dvd. It would be wonderful to have it, Freddie and the Christmas Doll, Freddie and the Plight Before Christmas and Freddie Gets 90 Days, plus the shorter black and white Freddie Christmas skits all in one collection.",1264204800,2,1492,4.468864468864469
1349168,3,B00004T3AL,"I suppose that if you're a huge Red Skelton fan--and I'm not--this DVD would be a great find. I'm a fan of Christmas specials, and when viewed as that, this DVD is three stars and that's being generous.

The primary feature here is ""The Plight Before Christmas"" from 1981 (yep, Skelton still was active then--despite a ridiculous joke about ""Cassius Clay"" this special didn't originate in the mid '60s) featuring Red as Freddie the Freeloader along with guest star Greer Garson. Garson gets mistaken for a panhandler herself through a mixup, and hilarity ensues. Not really...Skelton is his usual cornball self, and it just isn't funny. It all comes off as being quite tired.

Interestingly, this special came several years before another Freddie the Freeloader Christmas one with Vincent Price that I think is far superior. Ran on HBO in the early '80s and I've not been able to locate it anywhere since...I don't think that a recording exists for sale.

The other items on the DVD, essentially afterthoughts, arent' even worth viewing. In some cases the audio has been replaced and the video--probably found in some old closet somewhere--is atrocious.",1261440000,3,1153,5.026178010471204

1349176,4,B00004T3AL,There was a time television Christmas specials and yearly Christmas episodes dominated the TV schedule in December.  Those days are sadly gone.  Most of the great entertainers who delivered yuletide fun have passed on.  Red Skelton was a fixture on TV during the 50s and 60s.  This 3 DVD set provides Skelton fans with some great Christmas bits and some complete Christmas episodes from Red.

1349178,5,B00004T3AL,"When caught in a blunder - bad or good - Red was perhaps at his funniest! This is a masterpiece, and any Skelton fan would do well to own it! Ron Pataky knew Red well and up-close, and always claimed that Red was one of the most congenial (and hilariously ornery!!) fellows around. In several written pieces, Red established that he was an admirer of Ron's as well.

Along this line, Ron's new books, including ""HELP! I'M BEING HELD A PRISONER IN A RANSOM NOTE FACTORY!"" are now available by ordering online from Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Books-A-Million, etc. Another book is about to be released as well (11-06). Much like the first in the series, its title is: SECOND NOTICE! (If you ignored the desperate plea, ""Help! I'm Being Held A Prisoner,"" etc., what better and more logical follow-up than ""Second Notice""?).

Ron's silly humor site is >>>  Custom-Ransom-Notes.com",1162339200,6,872,4.8
1349179,3,B00004T3AL,"From the Jack Benny Program, we begin with ""The Christmas Show,"" as Jack braves a busy department store during the holiday rush in an attempt to get Christmas gifts for his friends. While there, Jack bumps into Rochester, Dennis, and Nelson, and his legendary stinginess even drives salesman Mel Blanc to suicide! Yes, it's a grim touch for a holiday show, but the entire episode is downright hilarious and my favorite program on the disc! Dennis Day even performs ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" for children in the department store in what is one of the most ""Christmassy"" moments I've seen on television!

The second show on the disc is another episode of  The Jack Benny Program. This episode is ""The New Year's Show,"" and while it doesn't have the special magic a Christmas show is naturally endowed with, it is still entertaining and gets funnier as it goes along. The crew is getting together for a big New Year's party, but Jack is skipping out for a date with a girl named Gloria. When Gloria calls to cancel at the last minute, Jack is left alone with nothing to do on New Year's Eve (join the club). He wanders the streets for a while, then makes his way to a diner to warm up with a bowl of soup. What happens here is hilarious, but I won't ruin it for you! Luckily, Rochester saves the day. This episode features a great Irish tune from Dennis Day!

Our third program is an episode of The Red Skelton Show. In ""Freddie and the Yuletide Doll,"" Freddie the Freeloader is spending Christmas Eve in the park feeling lonely watching the ice-skating couples and cheerful daters taking walks. When one young woman leaves behind a Raggedy Ann doll, Freddie takes it in his arms and begins to fantasize that the doll has come to life. The two enjoy a lovely and humorous date together, dancing, flirting, and ice-skating. It's a sweet and charming holiday pantomime story with great Christmas background music.

The fourth and final show on the disc is another Freddie the Freeloader tale from The Red Skelton Show. In O'Henry's story, ""The Cop and the Anthem,"" Freddie vows that he will spend this Christmas in a nice, comfy jail with 3 square meals a day. He goes into a fancy restaurant, runs up a huge bill, and prepares to be taken away, but the manager's holiday spirit prevents him from calling the police. From then on, it only gets funnier as Freddie tries again and again to get arrested with absolutely zero luck!

These are four real holiday treats for fans of old-fashioned television comedy. I mainly purchased this as a Jack Benny fan who used to watch reruns of his show as a kid and loves anything related to Christmas. However, I enjoyed the Skelton shows quite a bit as well. As I mentioned, the first show on this disc is my favorite, and it also happens to be of the highest picture quality. The second is considerably worse and the sound is low, though the picture has less troubles after the first few minutes. The third program has a rather dark picture, and the fourth is better, but still not as good as the first. They are all watchable though, and this disc is well worth owning at its usually affordable price for the first episode alone! Though the picture quality varies and is mostly what you'd expect from a bargain DVD, the only major complaint I could give is that it doesn't play on my Samsung player (always have to watch it on my parents' Sony), but I have learned over the years not to buy Samsung players. They're not great with bargain DVDs and lots of other stuff. It HAS lasted me quite a while, being my first DVD player, but when it conks out, I'll get a Sony. Anyway, as for this DVD, I highly recommend it to all Benny and/or Skelton fans. I'd give it more stars if it weren't for the varying picture/sound quality.",1138924800,4,3767,4.5419734904270985
1349180,4,B00004T3AL,"A very nice DVD collection.  Unlike most of the Red Skelton DVDs, this is authorized by the Red Skelton Estate.  The main episode, ""The Plight Before Christmas,"" is in color, co-starring Greer Garson.  In a nutshell, Freddie the Freeloader has a run-in with the law, escapes, and helps a flower lady escape as well.  The flower lady is the actress Greer Garson in stage makeup, who later returns the favor by allowing the hobos to hold their annual Christmas program in her theater - a benefit for orphans.  Nicely done, with some good Freddy the Freeloader moments, Red pantomiming, and just plain good entertainment.  One nice piece of trivia: at the beginning, the action takes place in front of Valentina's Antique Shop -- Valentina is Red's daughter.  The other features are in black and white, and include ""Christmas with the Skeltons,"" where Red's various character (Clem Kadiddlehopper, Willy LumpLump, Cauliflower McPugg and Deadeye) drop by the Skelton home to wish seasons' greetings, including an appearance by Red's real-life wife, son Richard and daughter Valentina.  Another Christmas episode is based on O. Henry's ""The Cop and the Anthem,"" dealing with Freddie the Freeloader trying (& failing) to get arrested on Christmas Eve in order to have a warm place to stay the winter - heartwarming, and one of my favorite episodes of all time.

However, this ""Christmas"" DVD also has other holiday goodies, including Red Skelton's famous recitation & explanation of the Pledge of Allegiance, two Thanksgiving skits (one hilarious with Clem Kadiddlehopper, one less so).

In short, this 130 minute DVD is packed, and a bargain to boot.  I enjoy it, and recommend it.

(In case you're wondering, the only thing that prevents me from giving it 5 stars is that it includes highlights from another excellent Christmas program, ""Freddy and the Yuletide Doll"" -- had they included that entire program, I would have given it an enthusiastic 5 stars.)",1133568000,44,1953,5.06875

His style of humor stands the test of time quite well. These clips are much better quality than those in other collections from the same period. Both in their content and visual quality, not to mention consistently funny.

The video quality of Red Skelton Bloopers, Blunders & Ad-Libs is consistent with the early 60's and late 50's when they were filmed or maybe a bit better. I suspect these may have had some digital ""cleaning-up"" but you can only do so much... If you are younger than 50 and watching the quality may be distracting. I suggest you take it as proof of its authenticity.

This is one of the best blooper-reels I've seen of 1950's/1960's TV. The content is funnier, better paced, and visually better with some (suspected) digital enhancement. The video quality is consistent with the times so don't expect anything close to modern quality! It's one of the best of its kind so I'm giving it 5 stars. If you remember the Red Skelton show fondly this will likely be a worthwhile hour and 5 minutes. It had me laughing out loud.",1491436800,,1167,4.552380952380952
