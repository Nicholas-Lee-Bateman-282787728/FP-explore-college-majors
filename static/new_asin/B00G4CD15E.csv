8620548,3,B00G4CD15E,"WARNING, MOVIE SPOILER. I loved Sound and Fury, and was anxious to find out what became of Heather and whether or not she eventually received a cochlear implant. I believe the movie did a great job of expanding upon both sides of the argument, the grandparents who wanted Heather to have every opportunity in life to succeed, and the parents who value the deaf culture, what it stands for, and how deafness is not a disability and does not limit her. I was a little disappointed in Sound and Fury: Six Years Later. It was very biased and did not demonstrate a well-rounded view of her post-cochlear implant life. It skimmed over any hardships she had to faced with transitioning to a hearing school and doing years of speech therapy. It only showed the positive outcomes and made it seem like 'get an implant and your life will be automatically be perfect'. However, it became clear why it was it was so biased when, at the end, the credits show that the movie was funded by Cochlear America.",1416096000,5,992,4.578651685393258
