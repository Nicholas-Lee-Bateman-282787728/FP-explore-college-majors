470914,5,6302484405,"This is a wonderful movie!!! and now that it is finally on dvd, I am glad to have it in my possession.  The movie itself is restored to brilliant color and crisp clearness for the viewer's eye.  The extras were very interesting.  I very much enjoyed the Backstory(from the cable channel AMC).  It helps take the viewer behind the scenes a bit and see a little more than MM's undies.
The deleted scenes made me laugh!!! To think what drew the line back in the 1950's as far as censors go!! These were so tame by today's standards.  They are still delightful scenes nonetheless.  They should've been put back onto the entirity of the film for the dvd.
The movie itself is just elegant, as MM's character would say.  It's the story of Richard Sherman, played by comedic talent, Tom Ewell.  Marilyn plays ""the girl"" who gets Mr. Sherman's wild imagination going.  She lives upstairs and when her tomato plant falls over and practically kills him, he invites her down for a drink.  Just a drink...
There's much more going on, just check this film out.  You won't be disappointed!!! It's a light airy comedy with great laughs, and the beauty of Marilyn.
This is a wonderful party!",1001203200,3,1174,4.596153846153846

470916,5,6302484405,"I won't do a summary, BUT I just have to say this is the best older movie I have ever seen. I have never laughed so hard. I don't know why, but every line Marilyn has is so funny to me: ""I can tell this is classical music, because there's no vocal"" she says in one of the scenes.
Also it's worth seeing simply to watch Marilyn light up the screen. I have never seen someone be so luminous on the screen. She's like electricity, you can't take your eyes off of her!

470917,4,6302484405,"This is one of the cutest movies ever ~ Like many other husbands in Manhattan during the summer, Richard Sherman (played by the extremely funny Tom Ewell) sends his wife and son to the country for the summer, while he stays behind.  While his wife is away, he tries to be a ""good boy"" by avoiding alcohol, smoking, and women!! But when a voluptuous blonde moves in upstairs his imagination starts to run wild~!!  When she asks to stay over because her air condition is broke; THE FUN BEGINS!! Marilyn Monroe lights up the screen as the innocent blonde - in every scene, she gives off such an incredible glow!!  Tom Ewell keeps you laughing all through the film while he talks to himself and has hilarious fantasies about women.  Such a Fast-Paced and SEXY film from the 50's...you don't want to miss it. I definitely recommend checking it out; especially if you are a fan of Marilyn or Tom - or if you're not, just rent it if you feel like laughing, and you may become a fan of both!! Enjoy! :)",985824000,,994,4.415300546448087
470918,5,6302484405,"Richard Sherrman has fallen head-over-heels for his new neighbor, a voluptuous blonde... er, actress. The only problem is that he's married. But that doesn't seem to faze the girl: ""Oh, I think that it's wonderful that you're married! Because with a married man, no matter what, he can't ask you to marry him!"" Right... but that doesn't mean he can't have a little fun... with his wife away for the summer.
Marilyn Monroe and Tom Ewell team up in this delightfully delicious sex farce directed by Billy Wilder. The sizzling script blended with Monroe's hopelessly dazzling appeal set the tone for the story.
Richard quickly learns a great deal about his new neighbor: She has posed for U.S. Camera, she appears in commercials for Dazzledent toothpaste (and gets to speak lines, too), and she keeps her undies in the icebox on hot nights.
Over the course of the next few weeks, Richard does the neighborly thing by inviting his charming, sexy, hopelessly ditzy neighbor up for a drink, charming her with records of Rock Monanoff: ""Is this what they call classical music? I can tell 'cause there's no vocal."" He escorts her to the theater and home again, walking right over a windy subway grate: ""Isn't it delicious?"" (The image of Monroe with skirts flying over the subway sparked one of the most memorable seconds in film history).
At film's end, Richard reluctantly succumbs to pangs of conscience and the girl's own, honest wisdom comes through. Despite the end of the illicit affair, the film is very much worth seeing, for comic scenes busting with laughs, fun, and the most of Marilyn Monroe's sex appeal ever captured on film. This is one of the great comedies, extremely funny, and absolutely timeless. This is one to watch on a hot night... with air-conditioning. And don't forget the champagne and potato chips.",971568000,4,1820,4.874193548387097
470919,4,6302484405,"The seven year itch is a really good film. And Billly Wilder and Marilyn Monroe were probably the best team of the fifties. Billy Wilder was the only one who could use perfectly Marilyn's sexuality on screen. Never was  it more compelling to watch her on screen than this film and""Some like  it hot"". Though ""Some like it hot"" is much better, the best  comedy ever made, this one has a freshness to it and a sort of underlying  tone which is refering to Monroe's intelligence. Watching her films, you  always feel that she means what she is saying, but in this one, you think  that she knows better than what she is really saying. You feel a sort of  contradiction between what she is saying and what she is thinking. That's a  different Monroe. And what did it for me, was when Tom Ewell tells the man  spending time with his wife, that Marilyn Monroe could be in his kitchen.  I've been wiating all my life to hear this. Whenever a star is in a movie,  you always mention others stars, that have no links what so ever with the  film or the actor. But why not use the real stars. The one who is character  in the picture. This one does, and only Billy Wilder could do such a  brilliant thing. It's small alright. But so smart....",961718400,3,1230,4.314410480349345

Believe me, when Marilyn  first appears on the screen holding her fan and bag of groceries, you'll be  blown away just as Tom Ewell's character is.
Contrary to popular belief,  I do not consider her role here a ""dumb blonde"" or a  ""ditz"".  The character is innocent, naive, and oh so  enchanting.

Marilyn's innocense plays off her sexuallity  very well. This comedy is upbeat, and though set in the fifties, it hasn't  been affected by age at all. The theme itself is thousands of years old,  (when the cat's away, the mice will play). My favorite scene is not the  skirt blower however. It's right at the end when Marilyn is waving good-bye  to Tom Ewell from the window. For a second you see why millions have fallen  in love with her.

The whole movie I was wondering why Tom Ewell kept delivering his lines as though he were in a play - only to read later that he had performed this part in the play many performances prior to doing the movie. Marilyn seemed to spend her time concentrating on keeping her eyes as wide open as possible.  It is a mildly entertaining movie, but it casts men as irresponsible idiots who need their wives to keep them in line.  My main fascination with the movie was seeing a piece of furniture on the set that looks a lot like a piece of furniture we have in our family room.

471043,5,6302484405,"Even after sixty years, THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH retains its freshness and bounce - a delightful testament both to the script (by Billy Wilder and playwright George Axelrod) and the quality of the performances.

The story is a simple one: left on his own during a hot New York summer, Richard Sherman (Tom Ewell) tries his best to avoid the temptations of drink, tobacco and an extra-marital affair. However his best intentions are frustrated by the presence of The Girl (Marilyn Monroe), who has moved into the apartment above him. Nothing actually happens, but the promise persists ...

Ewell gives a stellar performance, the best in his forty-five year acting career. In his rumpled gray suit, with tie askew, he embarks on a series of monologues where his better nature competes with his carnal desires. Most of them are shot in single takes in the Shermans' apartment: Ewell's India-rubber face changes rapidly as he debates the morality of inviting The Girl down for a drink. He walks from side to side of the frame, his shoulders hunched, almost as if he is bearing the cares of the world on his back.

The fantasy-sequences are extremely funny, with Ewell imagining himself as the protagonist in a comic reworking of FROM HERE TO ETERNITY, rolling about on the beach with a woman not his wife. Later on he casts himself as a Noel Coward-like figure speaking in a cod-British accent, as he plays Rachmaninov on the piano while trying to seduce The Girl (a reference to BRIEF ENCOUNTER).

When the latter scene is re-enacted for real, The Girl is completely uninterested in Rachmaninov. Sherman tries to embrace her, and the two of them end up falling off the piano bench in an ungainly heap. Although Sherman imagines himself as the Great Lover, he will never be able to fulfill his role.

Monroe is equally memorable in her role as the not-so-dumb blonde from Denver. It's clear she is attracted to Sherman - not because of his physical attributes, but because at heart he is an extremely sweet man. On the other hand she respects his love for his wife Helen (Evelyn Keyes), and thus refrains from making a pass at him. THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH contains the memorable sequence where she stands over a grille and lets the wind from a subway train beneath blow up her white dress. Wilder shoots this sequence very discreetly, leaving everything to the viewer's imagination. Monroe is far more seductive in an interior sequence, where she hides behind a chair and stretches out one leg, and then another. The janitor Mr. Kruhulik (Robert Strauss) witnesses what happens, and promises to leave Sherman alone.

Wilder's and Axelrod's script fairly crackles with one-liners, as well as a series of in-jokes referring to Charles Lederer (Wilder's fellow-scriptwriter), as well as a reference to Monroe herself.

THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH is one of those comedies that never loses its sparkle, even after repeated viewings.",1467504000,,2907,4.872469635627531

Richard Sherman is a man living in New York City who, like many other husbands there in the 1950's, sends his wife and son out into the countryside for the summer while he has to stay behind and continue working in the stifling heat. Other men, such as the apartment janitor and Sherman's boss, go out and live the bachelor's life in their families' absence, but Sherman has stayed faithful for seven years, and even tries to give up smoking, alcohol, and unhealthy eating.

But trouble comes when he meets a ditsy female temporary neighbor who works at making television commercials. She visits him because his apartment has air conditioning and hers doesn't, and Sherman imagines the possibilities. Will he be tempted to have an affair? What will happen if people, including his wife, find out about them? And is Sherman's wife unfaithful? Temptations and doubts plague Sherman throughout the movie, all in a comical way.

471137,5,6302484405,"The Seven Year Itch, from 1955, is a classic Golden Age romantic comedy. It stars Marilyn Monroe, at the peak of her success, and Broadway actor Tom Ewell. The film was based on the successful Broadway play of the same title written by comedy writer George Axelrod. In the play, the story concerned a middle-aged man's adventures during a steamy hot summer while he's wife and son's away in the country. He falls in the love with his very desirable upstairs neighbor, and has an affair with her. Wait, what?! Yes, that was the plot for this early 1950s Broadway comedy. However, when the time came to make the movie version, the Production Code (which came about in 1934) said the story was too naughty for the silver screen. It had to be cleaned up. First, the code insisted that any mentioning (or any suggestions) or an extra-marital affair be taken from the story, which, in the play had provided the majority of the funny moments. Most, if not all, of Axelrod's ""adult dialogue"" had to be either toned down or completely rewritten. Director Billy Wilder fought to have a scene involving a maid finding a hair pin in the man's bed, hinting that he and the young lady had ""spent the night together"", but the code executives wouldn't allow it. The Seven Year Itch ended up, in reality, being displeasing to author George Axelrod and director Billy Wilder, who later dismissed the movie as a ""nothing picture"".

Now that I've given a brief overview as to the history of The Seven Year Itch, I will now discuss the film itself. The story follows the life of article publisher Richard Sherman (Tom Ewell) who, at the beginning of the movie, sends his wife (Evelyn Keyes) and his young son off to Maine for the summer. Richard stays back in New York to make money. Richard insists that he won't be one of those men that lets himself become over-powered by ""living single"" for the summer. He recalls how one of his friends became tattooed while his wife was away one summer, and how many men ""see other women"" (there is never any mentioning of ""affairs"" or ""cheating""). However, when Richard meets his new upstairs neighbor (Marilyn Monroe), who takes the Kauffmans' apartment upstairs, he begins to rethink his plans. The Girl, which is how she's listed in the credits, has no name, but is very beautiful and very desirable to Richard. She's a commercial actress and former ""skimpy"" model. (The mentioning of the Girl's ""artistic picture"" is a reference to Monroe's own nude calendar posing, which caused controversy in 1952.) Richard and the Girl begin to spend quite some time together, quite innocently, though. Although Richard fantasizes that the Girl likes classical music and fine dining, in reality, the Girl prefers to play chopsticks and eat potato chips. After Richard allows his fantasies to overcome him, he takes the Girl in his arms and kisses her ""very quickly, and very hard"". This embarrasses him, even though the Girl states she's had that happen to her many times (and one can tell why). Richard asks the Girl to leave, and he becomes paranoid. He worries his wife will learn of his ""doings"" with the Girl and when an old friend stops by, he goes in to a panic and tells him about ""the blonde in the kitchen"". ""What blonde in the kitchen?"" his friend asks, ""Wouldn't you like to know,"" Richard says, ""maybe it's Marilyn Monroe!"" In the end, Richard decides to join his wife and son in Maine and lets the Girl stay in his air conditioned apartment. The End.

You have to know the play version of The Seven Year Itch to know exactly how much it changed to become the movie I'm discussing today. As I've said, the story was watered down considerably to be approved by censors, so much so that many involved were disappointed by the outcome (as I've stated beforehand). George Axelrod, who wrote the play, said that since, in the movie, Richard doesn't have an affair with the Girl he doesn't have anything to be guilty for. But, in the movie, he feels guilty anyway. Why? Well, I like to think Richard knows it isn't right to cheat on his wife, and that makes him feel remorse for something he hasn't even done. The Girl, too, I'm sure was toned down. But how can Marilyn Monroe be ""toned down""? She was uncontrollably sexy, there's no way that could be hidden. The movie, by today's standards, is quite innocent, but its still cute and very fun to watch.

I love The Seven Year Itch and Marilyn is, quite simply, a ""living doll"" in it. Her performance is dynamite! Tom Ewell does excellent. Their really the only two worthy of mentioning; there's others in the movie of course, but the main plot revolves around their adventures in Richard's apartment. One can understand why the movie wasn't good to those involved, especially the playwright, and from what I've read, the critics and audiences of 1955 were even upset that Richard didn't cheat on his wife. I certainly recommend this movie. Its delightful entertainment, of throwback at what was considered ""shocking"", and a way to capture the one and only Marilyn Monroe at the very pinnacle of her career. Highly Recommended.

471156,5,6302484405,"When most people think about The Seven Year Itch the thing that immediately comes to mind is the infamous scene in which the subway vents blow Marilyn Monroe's dress up while she is walking in New York City, but if you sit down and watch the film, this is not the reason that you will come away loving it.
This is a hilarious story of a middle aged man (Tom Ewell) with a wild imagination who sends his family upstate during the hottest part of the summer while he stays in NYC to work. He then meets a young girl (Monroe) who is renting the apartment upstairs and starts imagining that she is attracted to him. Half of the scenes in the film are carried brilliantly by Ewell as he stands in his apartment talking to himself about various things, most of which have to do the girl upstairs clearly being madly in love with him, since she knocked a potted tomato plant off the balcony and it nearly hit him, and what his wife would do if she ever found out. Hilarity ensues over the next few days as the two become friends and Ewell's character bounces back and forth with his thoughts about this girl, his wife.
There are many reasons why this is seen as such a great movie, but to me the most memorable thing is the truly beautiful performance that is given by Marilyn Monroe. She spends most of the movie playing the clueless blonde that she was known for playing, but in the last scene she gives a truly beautiful and wise speech telling Ewell that being incredibly handsome and having people adore you is not what is going to make a girl fall in love with you and it is not what is truly important. She tells him that what is much more important is who that man really is inside and how he treats a girl. She tells him that it's much more exciting if you know that ""he'll be tender with you, nice and sweet"". This is one of Marilyn's great moments and the real reason why this movie should be remembered.
The Seven Year Itch is a wonderful film and it is one of my favorite Marilyn Monroe movies. It arrived promptly and in good condition and this is a really decent prince for such a good classic movie. I would definitely recommend it!",1439683200,,2141,4.301980198019802

471247,5,6302484405,"[Fact] if your name is Richard Sherman (Tom Ewell) and your wife of seven years has gone to Florida for the summer, you will fall victim to the ""The Seven Year Itch.""

This film is based on a play by George Axelrod, who also wrote ""Goodbye Charlie"" (1964), and directed ""Lord Love A Duck"" (1966).

The director Billy Wilder also directed ""The Apartment"" (1960) and Sabrina (1954).

As with Shakespeare, this movie is a classic, many scenes and lines have been immortalized and parodied. I am not too sure that Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto was not used to remind us of ""A Brief Encounter"" (1945).

The basic story line is, ever since the time of Native American Manhattan's; in the summertime wives and children go south for the summer to escape the excessive heat. This leaves a residual of working husbands and sprinkling of single women. Or to be more precise, Tom Ewell and Marilyn Monroe. Tom has a great imagination and we see many of the scenes through his imagination. As the two accidentally meet and start to converse, Richard Sherman's (Tom) imagination only gets more exotic.

I am not going to quote the movie lines or scenes as if you have previously viewed this movie, then you know them by hart. If you are new to this movie, you need to have the characters deliver them.

It must have been irresistible for Darryl Zanuck to option the play when it became available, and to cast (or requisition) Marilyn Monroe as ""The Girl"" for this 1955 CinemaScope release.  Ewell cannot be blamed for reprising his Broadway role, which involved a great deal of thinking aloud and some funny fantasies, but vis-a-vis Marilyn's iconic presence there does seem to be a mismatch.  Marilyn still plays ""The Girl"" and she certainly wows Richard Sherman, but good grief, wouldn't you want to know her name?

Unlike the movie, Broadway audiences heard the inner thoughts of both Ewell and ""the Girl."" These lines were read by off-stage actors.

The famous publicity photo of Marilyn Monroe on a Manhattan subway grate is far more revealing than the sequence used in the movie. During an early morning location shoot, Marilyn's husband Joe DiMaggio stood by while a noisy crowd of 5000 spectators distracted her enough to ruin 40 takes. Each time that dress rose in the air so did Joe's blood pressure. The footage re-shot later has close-ups and discreet angles that show little of MM's torso but irreparable damage had already been done. By the time this movie hit theaters, Monroe's troubled marriage to DiMaggio was long over.

SYNOPSIS--
In Billy Wilder's toned-down adaptation of an often frisky play, Ewell reprises his stage role of a married man at loose ends while wifey and son are vacationing in Maine. Straitlaced publishing exec Richard Sherman fantasizes about the babe who's subletting the upstairs apartment, but it's the 1950s so nothing much happens beyond him feeiing guilty and them getting seen together by the building's nosy custodian.

Reminiscent of Thurber's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walter-Mitty/dp/0060847883/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walter Mitty</a>, Sherman's vivid imagination plays out a variety of scenarios. In this case, his daydreams run the gamut from romantically comic to terrifying. It's ostensibly Ewell's movie, but with Monroe at her ditzy blonde peak, who notices him when she's around?

She is absolutely at the top of her beauty and her performing abilities (albeit as the quintessential ""dumb blonde""), and lights up the screen with her charisma. Tom Ewell is the perfect foil - the henpecked dufus who falls for her while his wife is on vacation. Fabulous story, with sharp jokes and dialogue by Billy Wilder, based on the more daring play. Hysterical and dead-on commentary on the state of marriage and social mores of the 1950's - (but in some aspects things are not a whole lot different now). Times were simpler then (no computers, no cell phones, and they had barely laid the coast to coast coaxial cable for television) so it's a real fun escape into 1955 Americana.

It made me dream about how she and that other 50's comic icon -- Lucille Ball -- would have made cinematic magic together, with the right story and script.  She is quite frankly a marvel, and the only reason to see this film.  The rest of it is preachy, poorly written, boring, sexist, badly directed, and just embarrassing in contrast to the film's star.

His frequent conversations with himself and multiple-personality visions of grandeur - usually casting himself as a suave, jet-setting playboy - always backfires on him in hilarius ways when he actually tries to act them out in real life on ""the girl"" whenever she is in his company. The story is cleverly arranged and directed by Billy Wilder (""Some Like it Hot"", ""Double Indemnity"", ""Sabrina"") and I thoroughly enjoyed this film (again). Even my 23 year old son - somewhat cinematically-faded with years of CGI special effects and non-stop action films - liked it and wanted to have a copy of it!

Monroe and Ewell are indelible as its stars, the situations are classically amusing, and the whole package-- while in its weaker moments exhibiting that certain lack of subtlety which has devalued so many slapstick sex farces of the era-- by and large is delivered with a knowing wink, signifying an un-self-conscious acceptance of its flirtation with 1950s taboos and allowing it to achieve a level of elegance that transcends its 'naughty' hijinks and innuendo.  4-plus stars.

- commentary by Wilder biographer Kevin Lally

- picture-in-picture Hays Code reference

- Marilyn Monroe timeline

Unlike the movie, Broadway audiences heard the inner thoughts of both Ewell and ""the Girl."" These lines were read by off-stage actors.

The photo on this product page of Marilyn Monroe on a Manhattan subway grate is far more revealing than the sequence used in the movie. During an early morning location shoot, Marilyn's husband Joe DiMaggio stood by while a noisy crowd of 5000 spectators distracted her enough to ruin 40 takes. Each time that dress rose in the air so did Joe's blood pressure. The footage re-shot later has close-ups and discreet angles that show little of MM's torso but irreparable damage had already been done. By the time this movie hit theaters, Monroe's troubled marriage to DiMaggio was long over.

SYNOPSIS--
In Billy Wilder's toned-down adaptation of an often frisky play, Ewell reprises his stage role of a married man at loose ends while wifey and son are vacationing in Maine. Straitlaced publishing exec Richard Sherman fantasizes about the babe who's subletting the upstairs apartment, but it's the 1950s so nothing much happens beyond him feeiing guilty and them getting seen together by the building's nosy custodian.

Reminiscent of Thurber's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walter-Mitty/dp/0060847883/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walter Mitty</a>, Sherman's vivid imagination plays out a variety of scenarios. In this case, his daydreams run the gamut from romantically comic to terrifying. It's ostensibly Ewell's movie, but with Monroe at her ditzy blonde peak, who notices him when she's around?

471533,5,6302484405,"Either you understand what Marilyn Monroe ""had"" or you don't.

It wasn't just her beauty or her talent.  Marilyn Monroe had a vulnerability, a *tragic fragility* spoke directly to the human condition.  Because you can't understand tragedy unless you also understand Marilyn Monroe. ...

In his biography, Arthur Miller tells us that Marilyn was able to pick out the orphans in a crowd, she being an orphan herself.  And one believes this, almost as an act of faith.  Whern she's onscreen, regardless of the role, regardless of the quality of the picture: vulnerable and insecure, she has the ability to touch, to pick out in you, in you *your* vulnerabilities, *your* insecurities.

In a Nietzchean sense, when you see her onscreen and are, in turn, reminded of her tragic life, you fear for your own tragedy!  Her unbearable defenselessness triggers a thought -- ""Wouldn't it be tragic if *I* was that defenseless!""

What other actress was or is capable of doing that?

There were and are many, many actresses, especially in Marilyn's day, who tried to ""get across"" on screen what Marilyn got across.  And none of them even came close.

When Marilyn speaks to the Tom Ewell character, the Everyman of the movie, she's speaking to every male in the audience - handsome or homely; smart or dumb; single or married; rich, poor or somewhere in the middle. ... Jayne Mansfield couldn't do that.  Marlene Dietrich couldn't do that.  Rita Hayworth couldn't do that.  Angelina Jolie can't do that.  Cameron Diaz can't do that. ... Not-even-close.

When daVinci painted a gloved hand, even though he didn't paint the hand in the glove, he wanted to know about the hand: its structure, its anatomy.  In other words, he wanted to know what *moved* the glove. ... Knowing her life, knowing her tragedy, as just about everyone does, this is always in the audiences' mind when they see Marilyn Monroe onscreen -- what *moved* her, what was just below the surface.  Ultimately, it's impossible to know that in a person, especially a complex, talented, sensitive person.  But Marilyn gives us so many tantalizing clues!  So many theories, so many ... possibilities.

And they all go back, I believe, to her ""orphan roots."" ... How does an orphan deal with the adult world? ... How do we all deal with an adult world? ... What makes us so unfit for living?

We are all, at heart, orphans.  And Marilyn is there (put there by God or fate or random nature) to remind us of that.

Here's a question for you.  Was that certain-something Marilyn Monroe ""had"" inescapably tied up with her physical beauty?  Put another way: would she have lost what she had were she to have lived into her 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s?  I could be wrong but I don't think so.  As she grew older, her orphan-mentality would have been even more perceptive, more instinctive, more heartbreaking.  Assuming she got to play serious roles, she could have been the greatest beauty + the greatest actress ever to appear in front of an audience.

You can't take your eyes off her!  Men want to protect her, and  rage against those who took advantage of her.  And so do women.

If the studios who exploited Marilyn had given her half of what she earned for them, she could have bought every square inch of downtown Los Angeles.

As for ""The Seven Year Itch,"" this movie is humorous in the truest sense of the word, because to be truly humorous, to have a sense of *humor,* one must also have a sense of *humanity,* and that equation, more than anything, is what Marilyn Monroe captured in her comedic performances.

She relates to the Tom Ewell character not simply as a sex object (as some reviewers here mistakenly think), but in a true and human way.  Another less-talented actress could have easily turned Tom Ewell's ""inner most thoughts"" into something crude and dirty, but Marilyn never did that, not in any of her movies.  Her natural, spontaneous *celebration* of sexuality is, at its heart, the celebration we feel when we ""connect with others,"" when we discover someone doing exaclty what we're doing -- trying to figure out how, childlike, we can deal with the adult world.

That connection was Marilyn Monroe.",1250553600,7,4166,4.747910863509749

471566,3,6302484405,"The 1955 film version was co-written and directed by Billy Wilder, and starred Marilyn Monroe and Ewell, reprising his Broadway role. It contains one of the most iconic images of the 20th century-Monroe standing on a subway grate as her dress is blown above her knees by a passing train.

Richard Sherman (Tom Ewell) sends his wife Helen (Evelyn Keyes) and son Ricky (Butch Bernard) to Maine to escape the summer heat. When he returns home, he meets The Girl (Marilyn Monroe), a model who is renting the apartment upstairs while she is in town to make television spots for a toothpaste. That evening, while proofing a book by psychiatrist Dr. Brubaker (Oskar Homolka), claiming that a significant proportion of men have extra-marital affairs in the seventh year of marriage, he has an imaginary conversation with Helen, trying to ""convince"" her, in three fantasy sequences, that he is irresistible to women, but she laughs off his assertion. A tomato plant then crashes into his lounge chair; The Girl accidentally knocked it over, and apologizes. Richard invites her to come down for a drink.

As he waits for her to put on her underwear that she keeps cool in the refrigerator and gets dressed, Richard has a fantasy that The Girl is a femme fatale overcome by his playing of Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto. While playing Chopsticks (above), Richard, back in his fantasy, grabs The Girl in a bear hug, causing them to fall off the piano bench. She shrugs off it, but he is immediately contrite, and asks her to leave.

Over the next few days, they grow closer. His resolve to resist temptation in all of its many forms fuels his fear that he is succumbing to the 'Seven Year Itch'. He seeks out Dr. Brubaker for help, but to no avail. His imagination then kicks into overdrive: Helen and Ricky watch The Girl on TV as she warns the women of New York City about ""this monster named Richard Sherman""; The Girl tells a plumber (Victor Moore) how Richard is ""just like The Creature from the Black Lagoon""; the plumber repeats her story to the horrified patrons of the vegetarian restaurant Richard ate at; the Shermans' hunky neighbour, Tom McKenzie (Sonny Tufts), arranges for he and Helen to be alone on a hayride; a wronged Helen returns home to exact her revenge. The fantasies turn Richard into a paranoid wreck.

After a crazed confrontation with McKenzie, whom Helen has asked to drop by to pick up Ricky's canoe paddle, Richard comes to his senses. He tells The Girl she can stay at his apartment, then runs off to catch the next train to Maine.

The movie was filmed between September 1 and November 4, 1954, and was the only Wilder film released by 20th Century Fox.

The characters of Elaine (Dolores Rosedale}, Marie, and the inner-voices of Sherman and The Girl were dropped; the characters of the Plumber, Miss Finch (Carolyn Jones), the Waitress (Doro Merande), and Kruhulik the janitor (Robert Strauss) were added. Many lines and scenes from the play were cut or re-written because they were deemed indecent by the Hays office. Axelrod and Wilder complained that the film was being made under straitjacketed conditions. This led to a major plot change: in the play, Sherman and The Girl become intimate; in the movie, the romance is all in his head.

The footage of Monroe's dress billowing over a subway grate was shot twice: The first take was shot at Manhattan's Lexington Avenue at 52nd Street and the second on a sound stage. The sound stage footage is what made its way into the final film, as the original on-location footage's sound had been rendered useless by the over excited crowd present during filming.

Footage of Walter Matthau testing for Sherman is featured in the DVD of the film. Nicolas Roeg's film Insignificance features a character based on Monroe and a re-enactment of the subway/dress scene.",1237248000,,3837,4.803030303030303

It is not long before we realize the little scenes we often see are in Tom Ewell's head, wishful thinking on his part.  Marilyn plays it as only Marylin can.

471569,2,6302484405,"The only thing this movie has going for it is Marilyn Monroe, and that's just not enough.  Tom Ewell plays a blundering fool who loses his competence at the very sight of her.  If there are laughs in this advertised comedy, I must have dozed off at the time.

The setting is New York of a bygone era, complete with Automats and sans universal air conditioning.  I lived there then.  Ewell's wife and family have gone to the sticks to avoid the summer heat, and Monroe has taken the apartment upstairs.  Ewell's mouth falls open at the scent of her, as he tries to woo her into his--his--he's not sure what, but to his lair, for starters.

There's the famous scene of MM standing over the subway grid and having her skirt blow up to reveal her legs.  The giant cutout of that on Times Square revealed more than is revealed in the movie.  It offended Joe DiMaggio, her husband, but it had little to do with the movie.  The one memorable line was the claim that MM kept her daities in the ""ice box"" during the summer.

471571,3,6302484405,"The concept behind `The Seven Year Itch', and in ways even its execution, I really `get', but there is just something about the finished product that feels underdone, or maybe just done wrong.  I am new to the Billy Wilder fan club, but I've grown to adore just about every movie he's done.  This is the only one of the six I've seen this past month that doesn't sit right with me as a finished product.  In parts I love it, but lumped together it just doesn't translate well for me.

The story is one that I think is brilliantly crafted, because it is so much more than a mere tale of attraction.  This is a study of the male libido; the lies we tell ourselves to convince ourselves we deserve love and admiration.  This is a delicately crafted tale of intentional deceit and for that it deserves some major recognition.  The film centers on Richard Sherman, a successful married man who sends his wife and son away for the summer.  Unlike his male counterparts, Richard is determined not to fall into the summer fling territory, but then he meets a beautiful blonde staying in his apartment complex for the summer and soon his imagination is going haywire.

The entire film is shot like one long soliloquy, which at times adds to the humor but in the end takes away from the seriousness of the films subject.  The ranting of Richard is at times funny and witty and at other times overdone and irritating in its redundancy.  This may be due to the fact that actor Tom Ewell is slightly obnoxious in his delivery, but I think that talking every thought and emotion of a character would be hard on any actor.

Marilyn Monroe is without doubt the highlight of the film, for her infectiously bouncy portrayal of the desirable yet unattainable woman is spot on perfection.  This was an iconic role for Miss Monroe, one that she will always be remembered for, and with good reason.  She captures the naivety and innocence that makes a girl of her nature so desirable, and she serves up some of the funniest moments in the film.

In the end, the idea behind `The Seven Year Itch' is far more rewarding than the finished product.  I absolutely adore the concept and believe wholeheartedly in the message.  It is honest and rich with purity in its depiction (or attempted depiction) of the `real' man and his struggle with self security.  I just wish that the film had been handled differently.  Maybe I'm looking at it wrong, since it was adapted from a stage play where soliloquy form is much more tolerable and necessary, but that is why film adaptations have to take liberties with material.  What plays out as believable and normal even on the stage comes off as awkward and uncomfortable on the screen.

I won't say that you should stay away from this film, just know that it is not as effective as Wilder's other films.  It still has that humor he is (was) so famous for, it just doesn't feel as complete or as satisfying as a film like `Some Like it Hot' or `Irma la Douce'.",1221004800,3,2974,4.509328358208955

His wild imagination leads him to outrageous (and laughable) conclusions.  That is until Monroe almost kills him with a potted tomato plant.

Marilyn Monroe was very funny in her role and given that she was going through a tough time in real life makes it even a greater achievement to perform at the high levels that she does in this great comedy.  Although she is remembered as a bimbo femme fatale her acting talents should not be overlooked as I thought she was brilliant here and even when she played her small but memorable role in ""All About Eve"" I was very impressed at just how good an actress she was.  Unfortunately, this film was also responsible for her divorce from Joe DiMaggio shortly after.

Tom Ewell has this blonde, big boobed, beautiful neighbor living upstairs, who happens to be Monroe, and his wife happens to be gone for the weekend.  Ewell has air-conditioning and it happens to be bloody hot in New York, so hot- in fact, that Monroe needs to stick her panties in the freezer and begs Ewell to sit in his apartment to cool off. Oh sure, he lets her in. Wouldn't you?

So, his imagination runs away with him, does flips and somersaults, and creates scenarios, which never develop. Monroe is oblivious, just appreciating the kindness of a nice neighbor. There is a scene where he kisses her and says ""Oh my, I am so soooory.  This has never happened to me before!""  And Monroe straitens her stunning ivory dress, runs her fingers through her hair, and confesses, ""Oh, this happens to me all the time!""

""The Seven Year Itch"" is a lovely, lush, laughable film.  Nothing sexual happens.  Only a simple kiss. A man in middle-life going through menopause.  A man who comes to the realization that even though Monroe happens to be in his house, he still loves his wife.

My favorite scene:  Ewell says, ""No pretty girl would want me. I am old with a little pouch. No pretty girl would want me.""  Monroe disagrees--""How do you know what a pretty girl wants?  She wants to be treated tender. She wants kindness.  She wants to be loved.""  Before she leaves Ewell, Monroe kisses his cheek and says ""Your simply delicate.""

He really wants these things, yet seven years of marriage has ingrained his wife's nagging into his conscience. His wife's voice is always there and he is now no longer able to go through a day and complete simple tasks without constantly grappling with himself for permission.

Marilyn is so annoying in this I wanted to smack her, and Tom Ewell's character is equally a jerk. I am not sure why this movie was supposed to be funny. Is adultery funny? Not really. I don't mean to sound so conservative, in fact I'm quite the opposite, I'm pretty liberal, which may be why this movie bothered me so much. It is very sexist and dated and Monroe's usual portray of the harmless, stupid, breathy blonde bimbo so eager to please isn't very empowering to young women. The character she portrays has no name, is simply titled 'The Girl' a female puppet manufactured for pleasure. The jokes are dated and fall flat, no longer funny to modern society. I think 'The Seven Year Itch' is one of the most overrated 'classics' ever but what can I say, my 84 year-old grandmother enjoyed it. Maybe she was just nostalgic for the '50s. A much better Monroe comedy is 'Some Like It Hot' where she is less annoying and the humor still resonates to this day.",1152144000,16,1115,4.391304347826087

471657,5,6302484405,"This would have to be I think my favourite Marilyn film, certainly out of all her comedy roles anway. It's a Marilyn Monroe Classic and a Cinema classic for that matter also. Not just for the famous 'wind blown white dress scene', but also for the clever, tight script and superb direction of Billy Wilder, who always knew how to get the best out of Marilyn. The scenes between Marilyn and Tom Ewell are a pure delight.

 Ewell plays the tempted,nervous and slightly neurotic middle aged married Man to perfection and of course who else could portray the mixture of flirtatious sexuality and charming childlike naivety of Ewell's young, shapely neighbour for the summer, so beautifully as our Marilyn. She had a quality that was difficult to define and impossible to imitate.

There are some very memorable and vintage moments of comic irony and wit in this film. Among my favourites is where Marilyn's character tells Ewell's, that she was embarrassed about being rescued in her bathtub by the plumber(after her toe got caught in the faucet)because she had no toenail polish on. Marilyn's comic delivery and timing are superb in this film, and I think along with being a mega movie star and screen legend, she should be recognized for her talents as a very fine light comedy actress. Though when she pushed herself she could put her stamp on certain dramatic roles too (Bus Stop being the example which always comes to mind).

The scenes where the Ewell character's continually overactive imagination takes over, are very amusing and well done and I think he contributes as much to this movie as Marilyn does, in making it a timeless 1950's hollywood classic. It's a film I've seen many times but don't tire of.",1135641600,3,1712,4.812925170068027

He perfected
his role on stage & I would have loved to seen that. As the protagonist he carries the movie. The movie is dated, sexist, & P.I... for our time. For all I know people acted like this in New York City in the mid-50's (I'm not sure, I was five).
  I do know the censors were childish tyrants, afraid of sex. Who were thse (...)?
  Marilyn pulled this off while her personal life was crumbling. The numerous takes of her dress billowing up were gratuitous & demeaning. Her husband, Joe Dimaggio watching the whole thing was enraged & embarassed. I don't blame him. It may have been the last nail in the coffin that was their marriage. Very sad.
  Marilyn was a much better actress then she was ever given credit for in her lifetime. We had mere glimpses of that (Bus Stop & Niagra). But for the sheer joy of Marilyn Monroe, at her comic peak, this is the movie to remember her by.",1105488000,16,1261,4.317796610169491
471659,5,6302484405,"If you want to understand the fifties, you need to see this movie. In the days of ""Leave it to Beaver"", ""Father Knows Best"", ""The Tender Trap"" and all other ""women's goal in life is to get married and be placid"" garbage, this movie made quite a statement.

Marilyn Monroe plays ""The Girl"", a woman who hates marriage proposals and is very sexual. She runs around her apartment nude and she dips her potato chips in champaigne. She keeps her undies in the icebox and goes wild over Chopsticks. She knows what she wants, and in her own stupid way, she goes after it. Compare all this to Tom Ewell's wife, who, even in Ewell's fantasy, babies him while she does needlework.

Tom Ewell is a man who's very bored with his ""Leave it to Beaver"" life. When the beautiful blonde upstairs doesn't mother him and doesn't demand anything from him, he goes bananas. He's struck by her honesty, her lack of concern for social standards, and her natural, unforced connection to her sexuality. That he wants her at all was a huge social statement of the day.

This movie makes fun of other things too. Marilyn Monroe's toothpaste commercial highlights the stupidity that's now infamous of commercials of that era. Tom Ewell's reading about the ""Seven Year Itch"" theory in a psychological book makes fun of the 50's obsession with shrinks and psycho babble, especially with the theories of Freud. And who could miss the beach scene taken out of ""From Here to Eternity?""

This movie has some sexism in it, but it's quite tame compared to what it was parodying. Enjoy a good flick!",1105401600,3,1562,4.648550724637682
471660,3,6302484405,"Director Billy Wilder's ""The Seven Year Itch"" is a film classic not because of its comedic genius, but because it challenged Hollywood censorship and perpetuated the ""dumb-blonde"" stereotype that plagued Marilyn Monroe's career.  It's not a laugh-out-loud comedy, and is actually very predjudice by today's standards.  ""The Seven Year Itch"" was actually originally a broadway play.  However, when brought to the big screen, it had to be significantly trimmed down both in risky dialogue and subject matter.  In the play, the protagonist has an affair with Marilyn Monroe's character.  In the film, however, there is no affair at all.  Thus, the film is essentially about nothing. A married man flirts with a girl who lives upstairs. But nothing comes of their flirting, so the plot basically fizzles. In addition, the movie contains many monologues that drag, and the acting is very over-the-top.  Still, the film is important to see for anyone interested in Marilyn Monroe's life and career choices. For a better comedy that has stood the test of time and is an all-around stronger film, see Billy Wilder's other Marilyn Monroe film, ""Some Like it Hot.""",1097625600,6,1154,5.13903743315508

471663,4,6302484405,"""The Seven Year Itch"" is a wonderful film that opens up with the typical Manhattan family-or rather several of them being sent off to summer vacations while the husbands stay at home to ""play"" once their wives are gone.  The overlying dialogue, provided by a narrator, gives the film instant appeal and is strikingly different than any other film I've ever seen.  The dialogue in this film is very fun and the main character (played by Tom Ewell) has absolutely hilarious fantasies where he imagines himself in all sorts of incredible situations.  One of these fantasies, my favorite in fact, involves Rachmaninoff.
Ewell's awkwardness and assuredness that he knows how to woo women is hilarious and strikes a chord in all men's hearts.  He definitely plays to an older crowd-his ideas of dating and romance are wonderfully dated.  One gripe I have of the film is that they show us the picture that Ewell discovers of his upstairs' guest (played by Monroe).  Why do they show us the picture?  The picture would have been better if they had left it up to our imagination.
Marilyn Monroe is loveable in this film, though one can get tired of her nave character.  One has to see this film, if only to catch the now famous subway scene involving Monroe and her skirt.  The team who worked on the film did a magnificent job.  The DVD is excellent and the extra features are definitely worth a look.  ""The Seven Year Itch"" is a very funny comedy that manages to appeal to modern audiences.  I highly recommend it.",1073347200,3,1507,4.666666666666667
471688,5,6302484405,"""Chapter 6-the Brubaker-Steichel theory of the sporadic infidelity pattern of the married male, or the Seven Year Itch.""
Having sent his wife Helen and son Ricky to Maine to avoid the scorching July Manhattan summer, Richard Sherman, ""keymaster"" of a pocket edition publisher, stays behind to work, promising his wife to abstain from drinking and smoking.  ""Some husbands think just because their wives are away for the summer, they can run wild.""  However, the appearance of a young blonde renting his upstairs neighbours' apartment turns his life topsy-turvy, turning him into a bundle of nerves.
Sherman approves the covers of the pulp books:  ""Soup up the title a little, get yourself a cheerful and interesting cover.  It's a question of imagination, and Mr. Sherman has a lot of it,"" says the narrator.  To quote his wife and as a promoting film technology gag, ""lately, you've been imagining in Cinemascope and Stereophonic sound.""  From his imagination, including a parody of the beach scene in From Here To Eternity, we learn that he doesn't feel he's good-looking or charismatic.  It's his time with The Girl that changes him.  His imagination ranges from the humorous, ridiculous, even paranoid.  And he reveals his thoughts in soliloquys, which at times resemble trains-of-thought or even his subconscious.
The Girl turns out to be a typical blonde, but fun-loving, friendly, with simple tastes, understanding, trusting, and as it turns out, compassionate as seen from her sympathy for the creature of the black lagoon:  ""He wasn't really all bad.  I think he just craved a little affection, you know.  A sense of being wanted and needed.""  Oh, and she's definitely not a Rachmaninoff girl.
My take on the skirt scene?  Maybe I'd seen so many pictures of posters of it that it wasn't a big deal, and it's a bit overhyped.  There's plenty of superlativememorable dialogue, much of it funny, that boosts this movie.  However, the Girl has the best one.  When Sherman tells her he imagines a girl to love someone like Gregory Peck, she tears into him.  ""You think every girl's a dope?  You think a girl goes to a party and there's this one guy, a great big hunk in a fancy striped vest strutting around like a tiger, giving you that 'I'm so handsome you can't resist me look?  And from this she's supposed to fall flat on her face?  Well, she doesn't fall on her face.  But there's another guy in the room, way over in the corner.  Maybe he's kind of nervous and shy and perspiring a little.  First you look past him, but then you sort of sense he's gentle and kind and worried, and he'll be tender with you.  Nice and sweet.  That's what's really exciting.  If I were your wife, I'd be very very jealous of you.""  Those sentences cheered me up when I first heard them, and made me think, ""Well, maybe I've got it made, even though I don't look like Tom Cruise or Patrick Swayze.""  After all, like Sherman, I thought, no pretty girl in her right mind wants me.
The key trends of vegetarian cuisine, the coaxial cable, 50,000,000 TV viewers, and Arthur Godfrey are time capsule elements exemplified in the America of 1955.
Tom Ewell, who reprised his role from the George Axelrod play of the same name, must be one lucky actor.  After this movie, he played opposite another blonde, Jayne Mansfield in The Girl Can't Help It.
Robert Strauss is funny as Kruhulik the lecherous greasy-looking janitor, who quotes from Porgy and Bess to describe the antics of summer bachelors:  ""Summertime, an' the livin' is easy, when the fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high.""  Doro Merande has a funny line as a waitress whose pro-naturalist camp stance extends to pacifist sentiments.  And Carolyn Jones, best known as Morticia Addams, plays a red-haired nurse smitten by Sherman in an imagination sequence.
For me, this is Marilyn's best picture and best character.  I fell in love with her upon first seeing this.  Now, though, I consider her an old friend.  So, calling all the lonely creatures of the lagoon like me out there with great imagination and no esteem.

The movie is a splendid comedy about a man (Tom Ewell) married for seven years, itching over a beautiful blonde neighbor (Marilyn, of course), when his wife is off for the summer. Afterall, who wouldn't, for Monroe? The plot is nice enough for a nonstop comedy through out the movie. As usual, being a blonde, Marilyn is portrayed as a dumb and beautiful girl in the character. Specific scenes including the one where Tom tries to impress her with his taste for music are hilarious.
At times, you wonder if the movie was taken depending only on Monroe for she engrosses, blending so harmoniously in her role. The screenplay is impressive with loads of gag lines.

Ewell's got one overactive imagination, and that's where the comedy of the piece comes from. He fantasizes constantly about what will happen with various women in his life, and the reality of what does happen when the delightfully dizzy Marilyn agrees to come downstairs for a drink is a real laugh riot.
""The Seven Year Itch"" gives us one of the most famous images of Marilyn, when she stands above the subway grid so that the passing breeze blows her skirt up. It's a scorcher of a summer, and that's what occasions her joy with the gust of air, as Ewell stands passively just takin' it all in. I saw this film one summer on a hot pier on the Hudson River, and my friend--who to my amazement claimed never to have actually laid eyes on MM before--confided to me, ""Wow, she's actually a lot bigger than I thought!""

471693,5,6302484405,"This is the ultimate Monroe film. The one where she stands over a subway grating on a hot summer night to feel the rush of cool air from the trains passing beneath---the rush of air blowing the skirt of her sexy white halter dress up around her. But there's a movie that goes with this legendary image and it's a classic. Based on the adult Broadway play, ""Itch"" was watered down for the screen and stars Tom Ewell as the frustrated married man and Monroe as the Girl Upstairs. One hot New York summer, a man sends his wife and small son away for the summer---as all New York men do this time of the year according to Ewells' narration. He's left alone in their apartment to struggle with his vices---cigarettes and booze---when all of a sudden the Girl moves in sub-letting the apartment upstairs. She's a TV model and commercial actress and delightfully portrayed by Monroe. The homely and dumpy Ewell begins having steamy sex fantasies visualizing himself as a powerful lover irrestible to women. Monroe wants to be neighborly so she keeps inviting herself down to his flat frustrating the hopelessly timid Ewell. She doesn't realize her effect on him but he's got an air condtioner and it's hot upstairs. She's completely guileless. Monroe is perfect as the Girl and Ewell personifies the Everyman confronted with temptation when left to his own devices. Monroe is breathtaking in Technicolor and her performance speaks volumes about her comic potential. The subway grating scene caps her legend as a sex symbol but when you watch her performance here you see she was so much more than that.",1037318400,42,1595,4.782608695652174

I think the movie depends a lot on the major charactor Richard and his entertaining imaginations. The guy who played him, Tom Ewell, is wonderful. I am a little disappointed by Marilyn Monroe's role however. Her job in this film was just walking around wearing different sexy dresses (no complain here but I was expecting more)Playing a dumb girl, she really under-utilized her talent. But I guess she had no control over it. Come to think of it, how dumb people were just a few decades ago, when they thought ""pretty blondes are dumb"" kind of jokes are funny?

471695,5,6302484405,"This is without doubt one of the great works of American innocence in film.  Tom Ewell's Richard Sherman uses his powerful imagination to conjure up a whole slew of scenarios--some driven by 'pretend'-lust, some, by paranoia--to depict the colorful mental life of an editor in a small-time publishing office, circa 1955, whose day-to-day existence cries out for adventure.  The presence of Marilyn Monroe is the perfect added ingredient here; he needs SOME objectification to make his fantasies spring to life--and here she is!
The comedy here is great and works so well because of Sherman's constant, nervous imagination, fidgeting with scores of images that fly in and out that blow whatever his current situation is way out of proportion, and the leading lady's blithe, intentionally dopey disregard for baser intentions.  The combination of her innocence and obvious sexuality is a really potent one that leads Sherman into all kinds of imagined trouble and a supporting character, played by Robert Strauss, to say upon first glance of her, ""Well, HELLO""--justifiably so.
This film is much funnier than many more recent American comedies that take their comedy too seriously--because the writers and/or directors don't have the understanding of how to juxtapose opposites--the mark of any great comedy.  Here that understanding is so well done it's a real marvel.  The opposites of innocence and lust, fear and joy, happiness and frustration, are all mixed in so well with each other, this can't help but be a great comedic film.

Tom Ewell is a delight as mild-mannered husband on the loose Richard Sherman, and the movie is well worth watching for his performance alone.  His Walter Mitty like fantasies are a laugh riot--in one, he imagines the Marilyn character warning the entire nation on live TV about what a lecherous wolf he is during one of her ""Dazzledent"" commercials.  Comical situations abound in Ewell's life, like the antics at the sleazy pulp-fiction publishing house he works for that's reprinting ""Little Women"" as ""The Secrets of a Girl's Dormitory"" complete with lurid cover, and at the vegetarian restaurant he dines at since his wife isn't home to fix him supper (hey, it was the 50's).
This movie would be worth watching even without Marilyn, but she's here too in one of her funniest, most winsome performances as ""the tomato from upstairs"" who keeps her panties in the icebox for those hot summer days and gets her toe jammed in the bathtub drain and has to wait for the plumber to come rescue her from her predicament.
