7797004,4,1569382042,"In general a pretty good series.  Each video contains two episodes of about 30 minutes each.  Episodes are easy to follow without being overly simplistic, and the dramatized scenes are fairly decent.  Subject matter deals primarily with the pre-Christian or early Christian period, such as King Arthur, Merlin, St. Patrick, and Richard the Lionheart; but there are also episodes on Grace O'Malley and Bonnie Prince Charlie.  Overall, not a bad way to introduce young adults to some of the more interesting aspects of early British history.",1171670400,,539,5.232558139534884
