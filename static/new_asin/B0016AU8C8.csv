8261978,5,B0016AU8C8,The dialog in this movie is amazing. I was totally blown away by this movie. It was so novel. I wish there were more movies like this. It touched on so many topics about relationships.,1368835200,,184,4.285714285714286
8261979,5,B0016AU8C8,I was really impressed by the character work on Tre. This was a really great movie. I will be watching it again in the future.,1361059200,,126,4.08
8261980,2,B0016AU8C8,"Yes, lame as another review states, a bit like a TV Soapy, bought back memories of ""The Young and the Restless'
Don't expect the excitement shown by the young lady on the cover.",1315699200,,177,4.393939393939394
8261981,2,B0016AU8C8,"With the exception maybe of McDowell, I don't know how they could assemble a more lame set of actors. The story was okay, but nothing new. It was about 80 minutes too long.",1314748800,,172,4.242424242424242
