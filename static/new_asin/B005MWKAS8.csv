4838542,5,B005MWKAS8,"Good movie. It's more for the wife, though, as my type of movie involves Darth Vader battling topless Zombies, in space.

But, for people who actually DO have taste, such as my wife, it's a good movie. So, 5 stars.

Buy it now, and people will think that you have good taste too.",1326758400,8,279,4.245283018867925
4838543,5,B005MWKAS8,"Angel Dog Review
What happens when a man loses his entire family in one freak accident and the only survivor is the dog they found?  A bonding of man and dog, and a journey of a dog is discovered that has touched many lives.

I recieved this DVD free to review and I have to say it was very good.
Now if you are looking for a Christian Film this is not it.  It is CLEAN.  But it doesn't talk about how providence is from God etc...

(From [...])
Synopsis:
Angel Dog is an uplifting drama with sorrow, sincerity, hope, and humor...a journey of recovery for Jake Bryant, a man who has to learn to love, how to smile, how to live again after he loses everything that matters to him. His inspiration to get off the sofa and go on living comes from somewhere Jake never would have expected -- a lovable stray named Cooper.
Dove Worldview:
""Angel Dog"" is a movie which adults along with kids will enjoy. Don't let the title fool you. The movie deals with something everyone can relate to: death and loss, and the subsequent grieving process. Yet ""Cooper"", a stray, is a lovable dog who seems to have a mission: to help those who are lonely following a loss. Then he moves on to the next need.
Jake Bryant is lonely following the sudden death of his wife in a car accident. Cooper had just come to her and, against his will, Jake begins to form a relationship with Cooper and enjoy his companionship. The local vet, Caroline Mason, who cares for Cooper at first following the accident, can't figure out why his owner is so slow to pick him up from her office. Later, as she meets and gets to know Jake, she realizes just how lonely she is too, caring for an elderly mother in a nursing home with no one to share her life with. This fantastic story is an inspiring story of hope and we place our Dove ""Family-Approved"" Seal on this movie with enthusiasm. This film earned it! Make sure someone you care about sees this movie. It just might make his or her day.

Great film!  And definitly one for the whole family!",1325635200,2,2006,4.319148936170213
4838544,2,B005MWKAS8,"I was looking forward to watching this movie after reading the raving reviews. The story is cute and so is the dog. The acting, however, is horrible. It's a very low budget movie and it shows. Very disappointing.",1325548800,2,212,4.605263157894737
4838545,5,B005MWKAS8,Great movie for the whole family.  Total production used Texas talent.  Dog talent was done well! Awesome film for being on a low budget.  Loved the dogs!,1325548800,,154,4.62962962962963
4838546,4,B005MWKAS8,"I stumbled on this film while looking for something ""up"" to watch. It also doesn't hurt that I love dogs and have one that rescued me. That's what happens in this film, Cooper the dog, rescues Jake, a man who has lost his family. The film goes through Jake's grieving process while you learn what Cooper's real mission is. If there is one thing I didn't like it was the ending; that's the only reason I rated it 4 stars rather than five. In addition, I live in the area in which this film was made; kind of like seeing home through someone else's eyes.",1325116800,,552,4.266666666666667
4838547,5,B005MWKAS8,"As a father of two daughters, I'm trapped in a world of 3D animated movies. However, every once in a while I'm able to sneak in a movie that breaks the mold and warms the heart. Angel Dog is one of those movies. My girls loved it (both for the story and the dogs!). While the story starts out a little heavy (dealing with death) it quickly grabs you as you root for Jake and Cooper. Best of all, it gave us a lot to talk about as a family - how we appreciate each other, the importance of being together, and how we wished our dogs were more like Cooper! This is a good family flick or anyone looking for a nice feel good movie.",1324944000,6,628,3.992063492063492

As another reviewer says, it starts out a bit depressing, as Jake's entire family is killed in a car accident. But it's a nice movie.

LOL:  I know, because the drug flattened out a friend of mine the same way.  The story is of a man who loses his entire family in a car accident, but its acted as if he lost his job, not his family.  Everyone seems way too casual about the whole thing.  Most irritating of all is the woman who plays the Veterinarian.  OMG!  She is the most self-centered person! Her character repeatedly vocalizes more emphasis on the ""poor dog"", then on the fact that there is a poor dog and as man who lost his entire family and the entire family who lost their lives!  Then she projects all of her own internal blame and life-issues onto her mother who is obviously in some stage of dementia in an old folks home.  The veterinarian is in her own stage of denial and dementia.  The only god part was watching ""Cooper"" the dog.  I stopped watching this movie halfway through.  IF YOU WANT TO WATCH A GREAT ANIMAL MOVIE, see ""The Year of the Dog"". starring Actor and Comedian, Molly Shannon, John C. Reilly and Laura Dern, among others.  Its a feel good movie and very fulfilling.",1459468800,2,1225,4.439461883408072

4838803,5,B005MWKAS8,"I think it would be better to NOT watch this!  You can tell just by reading the description for Angel Dog it's going to be incredibly sad, and it is.  Within in the first 5 minutes we see the tragedy occur.  The vehicle is flipped over alongside the road and the family is dead... except for a very alert, intelligent and beautiful dog who happened to make it out alive.

You can tell the film is going for an emotional punch because of the way you don't see the accident happen, and instead we see it afterwards as the husband/father played by Jon Michael Davis has to cope with the loss of his entire family.  It's not easy watching Jon move from room to room and deal with the memories he has of his children and wife either.  The movie spends a lot of time showing Jon trying to deal with the losses.  You'll get upset too, believe me.

For a while (like 25 minutes) he doesn't care that his dog is alive.  The dog is kept at the downtown veterinarian's office.  There's a huge focus on the vet's office and the people who work there.  They make up at least half of the storyline.  The attractive Farah White initially thinks Jon's a scumbag for leaving such a special dog at the office for over 5 days without picking him up or so much as a phone call giving an explanation for basically abandoning the dog, until she learns the reason is that the man is depressed due to the loss of his family.  She then realizes the man has bigger issues and that he understandably doesn't really care much about a dog given the situation.  However this dog (named Cooper) has an amazing ability to help people cope with the losses of their family and friends, which is discussed in greater detail later.  This is no ordinary dog.

Also Ashley Hallford works at the vet's office, along with Maurice Ripke.  They all make the storyline with Jon and his dog that much better.  They also encourage Farah to hook up with Jon on a date.  For a while the dog refuses to get inside Jon's vehicle, so Jon leaves it parked in the lot and decides to walk the dog home instead.  Day after day he tries to encourage the dog to enter the vehicle but nope, he won't do it (obviously traumatized concerning the death of the family- hey dogs can pick up on these senses and memories too right?)

I kind of feel sorry for the veterinarian's office as well, because while everyone who works there spends all their time looking outside the window to see if the dog will finally jump inside the car, hardly anyone visits the place so their business must be on the brink of collapse.  Hey just one of those things I began to notice after a while. :)

Without spoiling too much, the story goes through a major change after a ""lost dog"" poster is found pertaining to this dog.  The storyline develops more as the dog becomes more of a focal point, and the characters try to figure out what's going through this dogs mind.  They visit a farm where the owners are looking for this dog, which is when the most surprising moments occur in the storyline as they explain the reason for the dog being there.  I won't say anything else.

The story is kept very quiet and subtle giving off a real homemade vibe.  It's better that way I think.  However this also means all the emotional twists and turns the characters Jon and Farah endure feel REALLY enormous and sadder than usual.  You can tell the goal of the dog is to help Jon cope with the loss of his family by encouraging him to hook up with the also single Farah White, who has her own depressive and angry issues related to her sick mother lying in a hospital bed.

I'm telling ya, this is a REALLY big tear-jerker of a film!  I was hesitating to even watch it because I knew what it'd be about.  Ah!!!  And you know this is one of those tricky situations where I don't really want to give the movie 5 stars because my high rating might give people the feeling I like being overwhelmed emotionally and that all emotional movies have to be given the 5 star treatment, but on the flipside giving it a low rating would be a big mistake too because it would make people think I didn't like it.  I DO like the movie.  It's just too much for my emotional state!  It's all so confusing!",1441497600,,4198,4.32225063938619

4838808,2,B005MWKAS8,"Just so-so. The characters were decent. The actors were good.

The storyline was weak. There are huge gaps that don't work. There is a senior in a nursing home with a hateful daughter putting her down whenever the daughter goes to see her mom. The senior dies without a whisper of mention other than the mother's cat is suddenly at the daughter's. Police drop a dog off at a veterinary clinic for care until, the owner can be reached after a car accident. The officer never mentions to the clinic that the man is the sole survivor of his family after said car wreck?

Dog is shown being walked on a collar, then on a harness when the leash exactly matches the collar. A puppy is supposed to get an exam, never gets it before the owner leaves the clinic. Other scenes make as little sense as the rest. It is a decent movie if you ignore the gaping holes in the plot and the strangeness of the interactions between the actors.",1432080000,,924,4.366279069767442

4838824,2,B005MWKAS8,"Saw this on Netflix and, as a border collie owner, decided to give it a shot. I hate to be hard on this movie because I know it is an independent, low budget film that is just trying to tell a heartwarming story, but at the same time, it wouldn't be fair to give it a free pass just because it means well. It's not awful; it has it's merits. I would just call it awkward.

Awkward (potential spoilers):
-At times it seemed like the actors were ad-libbing, almost stumbling along through the scenes. Some of the dialog seemed like complete filler, as if the writer couldn't think of valuable content to put in.
-Main character leaves his car at the vet because the dog refuses to get in. Why does he keep bringing the dog with him back to the vet? The average person not needing an obvious plot device would leave the dog at home and go get the car.
-The chronology was a glaring problem and, to me, is where this project really showed that it was produced prematurely. Were some of the scenes out of order? Here's an example: Woman's mother dies in nursing home. Man puts house on market. Man sells house. Man moves. Woman goes to nursing home to collect her mother's things. Huh? The woman didn't go get her mother's things until after the guy moved? How quickly did he move?
-Passage of time in general is hard to follow, too. I'm not sure what subtle cues directors use to indicate to the audience that a length of time has passed, but they're absent here. Apparently nine months passes and it seems like a few weeks.

Again, it has its flaws, but it's not awful. The overall concept is original and intriguing. If you're surfing through Netflix and you love dogs (especially border collies) and want something wholesome (albeit heavy), sure, throw it on. It won't be your favorite movie but if you can accept the various flaws and take it for what it is, you might enjoy it. There are definitely worse films on Netflix and if I'm going to watch an obscure title I'd rather it be this one than one of those blatant rip off movies like Transmorphers.",1354320000,4,2052,4.425925925925926

4838827,5,B005MWKAS8,"This is a movie designed to touch the heart and soul and it does a spectacular job of doing that very thing. Filmed in Central Texas around San Antonio the settings and the all-Texas cast create an amazing mood of reality as you watch them and listen to them tell their stories. My wife and I are both native Texans and she commented early on about the accuracy of the accents. When we saw the cast all came from Texas we understood why their accents were so good, they were natural.

This is the story of a mysterious, beautiful, and sensitive dog that just happens to be there when needed most. The movie focuses on the story of Jake Bryant, played by Jon Michael Davis, who is an ordinary guy with a loving family whose life is drastically changed by an automobile accident. A dog they named Cooper had come into their lives a short time before and had become a part of their family life.

The dog, the only survivor of the accident, is taken to an animal hospital where it is checked and found to be uninjured. The vet, Caroline Mason, played by Farah White, is drawn to the dog and develops a special concern for its well being. This concern has a significant impact on the rest of the movie.

The movie is sensitive and carefully crafted to show the phases of grief that Jake endures as he attempts to put his life back together with Cooper's help. If you appreciate animals this movie shows the marvelous bond that can develop between animals and people; Cooper is a precious life and fills a significant need in Jakes life as he begins the process of healing.

Cooper is, however, a dog with a mission and Jake must discover and make peace with Cooper's mission as his healing process continues and things change yet again for Jake.

The chance taken by Angel Dog is to tell a quiet, simple tale with no special effects and little eye-catching cinematography. As a result, the beautiful story written and directed by Robert Nations can make its fullest possible impact.

As for the story itself, it is two-pronged. On the one hand, it is a thoughtful and nuanced look at how the loss of loved ones effects us in different ways and how we may overcome or fail to overcome those losses. On the other hand, it is a slightly mystical consideration of the intuitive gifts of animals and how those gifts can be healing to their human friends. In the vehicle of a poorly written script, both of these themes could quickly become overly sentimental. But Nations' script is so quietly thoughtful and real, that I was captivated and moved from the beginning to the end of his movie.",1332374400,4,1086,4.7712765957446805
