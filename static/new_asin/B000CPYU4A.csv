8164695,5,B000CPYU4A,Watched this with my boys when they were small but I bought it because I'm a Flintstone lover.  Watched the orginal program when I was a teenager every week. Decades later I still can sit and watch them. This will be passed down to my grandchildren.,1377993600,,249,4.413043478260869
