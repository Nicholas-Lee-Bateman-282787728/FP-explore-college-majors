8255675,1,B0014GC1UQ,"I ordered this to replace the DVD we already have unfortunately I can not play this on my computer or on our DVD, so it is a waste of money.  This is in a format that I can not use.  I was so busy that I didn't pay attention so I am just out, due to my careless.  This is a very good movie & I was hoping to be able to see it again.  When I originally wrote this review, I was not aware that I could return the movie for a  refund.  Since that time I have returned the movie & received a refund.  I will be more careful next time when purchasing a movie.",1481932800,,554,3.6837606837606836

8255677,3,B0014GC1UQ,"I am sure it is a good film; I have seen it with other media.  Shows a slice of modern China mainland life. I recommend it.
HOWEVER, this was listed as a DVD, which is why I ordered it.  But it will not play, because it is DIVX.  The vendor misled me by wrongfully calling it a DVD for sale.  You wasted my time.",1424390400,,312,3.828125
