1305491,4,B00003CXZ1,"don't worry, this isn't a hard to follow movie. It's designed just like the games were. Lots of lavish scenes with a normal plot: save the world, kill the bad guy. But does she do it? I'm not gonna tell you. The trailers do that already. But I say the outer-space fight scene was interesting. I don't like Angelina Jolie for being too much hype, and there is way to much product placement: taco bell, cd's, UPS, Land Rover, key chains, blah, blah blah. They really can't crame anymore down our throuts unless they made a game out this.  Keeping this all in mind, you will like this movie. It's not like the Mario Brothers movie. This stays close to the game, and Angelina jolie prooves herself early in the film that she is Lara Croft, right down to the accent. Go see it. Not as good a Mission:Impossible, but close.",992563200,3,817,4.410596026490066
1305492,5,B00003CXZ1,"Now this is not an Oscar movie by any means. This is no Traffic or Crouching Tiger, Tomb Raider is exactly what the summer movie going folk need -- pure fun. Being a player of the games (and a reviewer of them as well) the movie totally felt like playing the game. You had plenty of bad guys in your way, Lara had to travel to exotic locales and of course in the end, it's up to her to save the world. I love it! This is what summer movies are supposed to be about. Action, adventure and fun. I hate to read reviews from folks who really don't understand the game and the background of Lara Croft. I personally know the fellows that created the game and who have put their heart and souls into developing this phenonemon. They are totally pleased with the movie. So do yourself a favor. If you want some fun for 2 hours, go see Tomb Radier. You'll be glad you did.",992563200,32,864,4.148809523809524
1305493,2,B00003CXZ1,"Lets face it,you just can't make a good movie out of a video game(Well Mortal Kombat was good but that was six years ago).Tomb RAider expects people to go see it because one:it has a big name attached to it,two:because it looks like its action packed(which the action scenes are far between).I won't tell you the plot because its so lame I don't feel like typing it. BUt I was a fan of this series before and I still didn't like it.i gave it two stars because the action scenes were OK and just because Angelina Jolie was good in it. If you want to see an action movie with brains see Swordfish but save your money from Paramount's wide open wallet.",992563200,,649,4.327868852459017
1305494,4,B00003CXZ1,"She may not win the Oscar for Tomb Raider, but this is still a fun movie to watch. Not every movie has to be an Oscar contender to enjoy. Go and enjoy this movie. I'm already looking forward to the sequel.",992563200,13,205,4.024390243902439
1305495,5,B00003CXZ1,"INTELLIGENT,STRONG WILLED, PHYSICALLY IMPOSING, SPIRITUALLY ELEVATED...AND BEAUTIFUL BEYOND BELIEF--JOLIE WAS BORN TO PLAY THE ROLE OF LARA CROFT. THE MOVIE IS NON-STOP ACTION WHICH RELIES FAR, FAR LESS ON THE STAR'S PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES TO ENTHRALL US THAN ITS COMIC BOOK PREDECESSOR.IT IS A VERITABLE TEXTBOOK OF MYTHOPOEIC ARCHETYPES GIVING THE COMPARATIVE MYTHOLOGIST THRILL AFTER THRILL. THE INCLUSION OF THE ILLUMINATI  EXTENDS THE MOVIE'S MYTHOS TO THE KNIGHTS TEMPLAR AND THE FREEMASONS; WHICH MAY EXTEND BACK TO ALEXANDER THE GREAT. THERE IS MUCH FERTILE GROUND LAID FOR SEQUELS AND  A TV SERIES. IT IS NOT ONLY ENTERTAINING (FUN) BUT INTELLECTUALLY STIMULATING FOR US SPECULATIVE ANTHROPOLOGISTS.; IT HAS MY HIGHEST RATING, NOT LEAST BECAUSE MS. JOLIE IS A GODDESS.",992563200,6,774,5.6068376068376065
1305496,2,B00003CXZ1,"It was one of the most anticipated film this summer as millions of Tomb Raider fans awaits the screen adaptation of their favourite game. Heavy promotion and cool website serve as the entree for this movie. However, the main course just fails miserably in contrast. The director, Simon West, was more interested in getting Angelina Jolie to pose in front of the camera than making her act.
 The movie opened with Jolie fighting with a robot in a typical tomb raider setting only to reveal ""the gem"" she was after was a CD of her favourite music and the robot was her ""simulated"" training companion. The action was well choreographed but the humour was unbearably contrived. Thus set the pace for the rest of the film which is filled with clique and a lot of pouty lips from Miss Jolie.
 The movie sees Lara Croft out fulfilling her late father's unfinished mission, the search and destroy of the secret triangle that allows its possessor's the power of controlling time. However, instead of getting on with the action and less talk, the movie took a twist and became a travelogue as we travel to Cambodia and the ice arctic (where Jolie was dressed in a sleeveless top and open buttoned leather coat - one wonders what is protecting her from the freezing cold), in search of the missing pieces that will form the secret triangle.
 It was even more bizarre as the script serves up several mushy scene between Croft and her nemesis Powell and her arch rival Alex West as Croft debates giving up her half of the secret triangle for the chance to go on the search of the second half with the Illuminati.
 This was a film with forgettable character, terrible script and direction. Surely Miss Jolie can do better than putting her career at stake by associating herself with this level of production. Fans of Lara Croft will probably be much more contented with the game play and finding solace in the brilliantly designed Tomb Raider website.",992390400,68,1937,4.688235294117647
1305497,5,B00003CXZ1,"It's the best action movie in years. We all have seen action movies befor, but none compair to Tomb Raidar. This movie is different. It's is a combonation of adventur, comedy, and fun. Since it is based on the video game Tomb Raider people can go in knowing what to expect...or can they? With Lara Croft played by Angelina Jolie you can never know what to expect! If you haven't seen this movie yet!!...!!...!! GO SEE IT SOON!!!",991699200,17,428,4.5

1305650,1,B00003CXZ1,Item came in that cheap bubble packaging which is crap and doesnt protect anything. When I took the movie set out I noticed that the discs were loose inside because I could hear them. I decided to open it to see whether or not the little teeth that hold the discs in were broken or intact as well as if there were scratches on discs. Go figure the teeth were fine but there were a lot of scratches on the discs and the case when opened ended up was split in several places but hidden by the info paper. I immediately ordered a replacement. Upon getting the replacement I ran into the same problem all the way to the crappy bubble package. Split case and discs rattling inside were scratched. Now I have to return the second one and still have no movie set. I have bought other movies that came in an actual box. Movies should be better protected.,1517097600,,846,4.29375

and noah taylor that plays as bryce is very annoying it would've been alot better to see someone played as zip rather than adding some new character that isn't much help at all and only there for the plot the stories for these two films was good for its time and Angelina was perfect to be lara for the time of these movies it just should've had a better cast and should've had characters from the games overall its a good film and catches some of the elements that's in core design original tomb raider",1486512000,,947,4.386363636363637

I ordered this two pack and sent it back as the first movie, ""Tomb Raider"", is a terrible copy.  Both the original order and the followup had the same issues, I found other reviewers stating the same thing.  That being that the picture has an almost snowy thing going on for most of the movie.  As long as Amazon doesn't want to pull this movie for whatever reason, you have to decide do you take the great price and accept the poor quality or do you pay more to get individual copies that do not have the snow.  The second film, ""Tomb Raider, The Cradle Of Life"", does not have this issue.",1463702400,33,740,4.111111111111111

1306572,5,B00003CXZ1,"As far as movies go, it is dumb. The plot makes no sense and is strung together with beautiful and well done (for the most part) action sequences. This movies whole premise seems to be put Angelina Jolie into as many creative action scenarios as possible. That is what makes this movie enjoyable. There seems to be a deeper and more compelling story and character development hiding in there somewhere but is too distracted by the action potential to show up. Angelina Jolie's performance is awesome and is very believable as Laura Croft. She seems to be having a lot of fun in this movie.

Looking back Jolie was miscast it would've been better if the studio thought outside the box and hired
 Rhona Mitra she is stunning has the perfect english accident and is a super under-rated actress
But, the damage is done Jolie did two Lara Croft film adaptions

The biggest selling point for this set is all the cool extras it has!  each film has a surprising amount of cool extras
That make it a must have (Only if you love films and appreciate audio commentaries,  behind the scenes footage, deleted scenes, etc.)

1308258,4,B00003CXZ1,"Angelina Jolie.

What can be said more than what has already been written? Well, not much really.

Tomb Raider does a nice job of highlighting the upper physical assets of AJ while she romps through a series of 007-esk scenarios. You know that she will save the world in the end but it is nice to watch her go from one locale to another clad in what can only be called a ""pointed advertisement"" for stretch tops of many colors for the amply endowed!

Acting? Well, enough said.

Direction? Well, not much more to say other than thank you.  When a director has such a subject/object actress, you will d___ well focus on what the viewers want to see. So there.

Script? Well, after all the film comes from a comic series so scripts are not really needed but there are a number of words in the film for those who want to follow something else.

Production values? There are some and perhaps this is where the film excels.

I don't know because I wasn't paying much attention to those during the film - sorry!",1416700800,,1005,4.394594594594595

1308674,3,B00003CXZ1,"Laura Croft: Tomb Raider does nothing but deliver in this action pack film based off of the popular video game.  Laura Croft must race against time and villains to recover powerful ancient artifacts that could change the course of mankind.  This film was written by Sara B. Cooper, Mike Werb, and Michael Colleary while Patrick Massett and John Zinman where in charge of the screenplay.  Simon West not only wrote the adaptation from video game to film but he was also the director of this.  He is know for films such as Con Air and The General's Daughter.

Seeing that Laura Croft (Angelina Jolie) is a member of a rich British aristocratic family, she spends her time as a ""tomb raider"" who enjoys collecting ancient artifacts from ruins of temples, cities, worldwide, and loves the thrill and danger to get them.  As it is clear in the very first scene of the film she is very skilled in hand to hand combat and weapons.  She loves to wear very tight outfits and does not like to wear dresses at all.  We learn that the planets of the solar system are going to go into planetary alignment (which only happens every 5,000 years) and that something occurs only when that happens.  There is a secret society known as the Illuminati and they are searching for an ancient talisman that gives its holder control over time.  The only downside is they are nowhere closer to finding it and the time to the alignment is getting closer.  Then while Laura is asleep she is awoken by something which turns out to be a clock in a secret room.  She takes this to her technology savvy friend Bruce (Noah Taylor) and they together discover that its not a clock but some sort of key.  She takes it to her dad's friend Wilson (Leslie Phillips) to see if he knows more about it but he doesn't want to get her involved.  He then tells her to take it to Manfred Powell (Iain Glen) that he knows more about it.  It's true that he knew because it is the key that the Illuminati was searching for.  That night he set up for the Illuminati to steal it, then the following morning Lara gets an old letter from her deceased father (Jon Voight) telling her what the society had planned to do.  It turns out that it was her father was the one that hid the key in the secret room. Now, she must retrieve the key and find and destroy the talisman before the Illuminati can get their hands on it.

One of my favorite scenes in this movie comes in what happens in the photo above.  There is a part where she has to jump onto a swinging log and that scene was awesome.  Angeline Jolie is everything Lara Croft.  She portrays the bad ass very well and it was enjoyable.  Although the plot was somewhat a bit unbelievable something that you could only find in a video game.  I guess that is probably what they were going for.  Just bringing it to life.  There is even a scene where she is shooting where all you see is the two guns, so it is like you are shooting, just like in the game.

Overall I would have to give this movie a C+.  It was an enjoyable movie with good action but you don't get to really learn anything about the characters which is a bit disappointing.  All you learn about Laura is her dad died in 1985.  There was no character growth which I was looking for in this.  Don't get me wrong it was enjoyable to watch and I would recommend you check it out if you haven't seen it.  It's just missing a few things for me to get a higher rating.

1308863,2,B00003CXZ1,This set is half complete. Cradle of Life looks great and is fine but the original is either a) a horrible blu ray copy or b) not really a blu ray at all. The original's disc is literally see though and when I look at other unboxing video's I see a completely different disc for the original so I'm pretty sure the one that comes with this set is not blu ray quality. The picture is worse than my dvd copy when I put it into my blu ray player.

Ok, so I am not the most current as I just watched this in 2014. I had it on my shelf of ""to watch movies"" for a while but never got to it until now. Yeah, Angelina Jolie is attractive, no one will argue that. But with all the action movies we have all seen,why doesn't this one rate better? It has good support characters (I particularly like the butler). It has a reasonable plot.

Maybe it's because I just get kind of bored. There isn't anything different enough (other than the fact that the main character is female) to make the story really stand up to the Indiana Jones movies or the Nicolas Cage American Treasure movies (all of which were excellent).

So it;s a reasonable rental (I guess) but not one I would need to own or even watch more than once.",1404777600,,795,4.251655629139073

The sets were interesting, Angelina was herself, as always, and once I got the pattern of the story down I found I could work during the heaving breasts sections and take a break in the brief spaces where Craig actually appeared. Ian Glenn was also on tap which added a bit of fun to the Suave Villain meets ""Overly Compensating For The Heaving Breasts"" Heroine.

1309719,2,B00003CXZ1,Cheesy overacting from the entire cast except Daniel Craig.  Only the chance to ogle a pre-mastectomy pre-homewrecker Angelina Jolie in an super push-up bra nets this an extra star.,1396137600,,181,5.241379310344827

1309721,5,B00003CXZ1,"If you haven't seen this action pack feature you will love it. Jolie brings Lara Croft to life in 3D sense and makes you believe in her. It's not the deepest plot but nearer where the games. She is a great action star and proofs it in this film with some great stunts. Many she did herself. It's a kind of tongue in cheek ride on the edge of your seat film. Chis Barrie as the butler provides some great comic relief. As well as the actor playing Brace her tech guy. (Sorry don't know the actors name off hand) Great job by both of them. Her father Jon Voight has a cameo as her father in this film, I think it was the last thing she did before she put an injunction against him to keep from seeing her. So value it as the last time the two will ever be seen together on film.

1310334,4,B00003CXZ1,"If you try to take this movie too seriously you will probably walk away hating it.  If you take it for what it is, an action movie with a little bit of drama and comedy sprinkled in, then you can enjoy it.  It is definitely not the traditional summer blockbuster with an explosion every two seconds.  While there is a lot of action, there is a plot that the action does slow down for.  It is not what I would call an overly deep or complicated plot...your basic bad guys want to rule the world kind of thing, but there are aspects to it that involve more than just fighting or shooting.

I think the pace of the movie was just right.  Clocking in at basically a little over an hour and a half, it did not try to do too much, and was able to keep the action going, tell the story that they were trying to tell, then got out before dragging on.  The movie looks and sounds great on blu ray.  There are a lot of special effects, but those do not really detract from the movie at all (like say Lucas' special effects laden movies).  The used enough sets and location shots that the effects really did enhance things.

For those who get the discs and like bonus material, there is a lot here.  There are a bunch of behind the scenes features ranging from 5 min to 25 min.  Some are general ""making of"" features, others focus on the special effects, and other show the training regimen Angelina Jolie went through to become the character.  The fact that she did many of her own stunts in the movie was impressive given what they had her doing.

Obviously liking or disliking any movie is subjective.  If you don't like action movies or Jolie, you probably will not like this.  I have not really played any of the games so I am not sure how faithful to the character they stayed, but it does seemed like they were trying to.  Maybe not storyline wise, but to capture the essence of the game. While it is not the best movie ever, on the whole I think it is well worth the price if you still get the physical discs or worth a rental if you do not.",1377475200,,2038,4.197943444730077

The story is almost unbearably cheesy, and now that it is outdated it is even more cheesy.  The movie has some famous actors in it, which they probably regret now.  Jolie has a taste for these types of roles (Salt, Wanted, Mrs. Smith) for reasons I do not understand.  Maybe she just finds them fun.  It is also somewhat shocking to see Daniel Craig in this, since he would eventually be recognized as a talented actor.  Only watch this for laughs or because you need reminded that even good actors and actresses play crap sometimes.",1369440000,,699,4.507936507936508

You don't need a bunch of blood coming out of a human body like if there was a sprinkler inside to say that it is an action movie. You can notice that in the whole movie no one is killed explicitly.

Bottom line, good movie if you like action and adventure at an enjoyable point where you don't think it's too much gore. Very entertaining too!",1369180800,,521,4.21

They were surprised that the movie was action packed and so much fun. Even on a small screen,  we all enjoyed watching it and the wonderful break from reality it gave us all. I recommend it as a fun action adventure movie and gave it 5 fun stars.",1368835200,,423,4.197530864197531

She is trying to steal a diamond from a chamber of an Egyptian tomb and she is attacked by a robot.  A fight and chase occurs and Lara defeats the robot and takes the treasure to find out it is a tape of her favorite music.  This action takes place in her home and it is her way of keeping her skills sharp for the real thing.  Unfortunately she doesn't suspect that the real adventure will be even more dangerous and deadly than the practice session could ever be....

Angelina Jolie does a superb job in playing this role.  Her acting skills and athletic ability shine in this movie.  It is almost nonstop action and adventure all over the world with Lara being the focus of the movie.

Yeah the movie is over the top and silly at times but the premise of the movie is a video game.

1311237,5,B00003CXZ1,"This review is of the movie and not the blu ray version. Though I will say it looks great on dvd. First of all, I will agree that some movies should not be taken too seriously. Why should it, when the main character is a bit larger than life (physically and metaphorically) she sometimes went up againsat dinosaurs in the game, so why is this one so over the top or hard to believe? I've always like the games, because I have always loved strong women (not bodybuilder strong. i mean strong in character) Lara Croft is a kick ass chick with a brain. She's eye candy in some respects but she's not a girlie girl. She's strong, yet feminine but always one step ahead of her male competitors if they can even keep up. The movie to me captured the character perfectly. Maybe it deviated a bit from the game at times, but then again with each new game they tend to deviate from the established canon. And seriously, is there anyone more perfect to play Lara than Angelina Jolie? she embodies the same character traits as Lara, and she exudes sexuality even in the most mundane situations. A lot of times women in action movies do not get the same credit as males in the same genre, but Jolie deserves to be ranked right up there with Harrison Ford and Tom Cruise or even a Shwartzenneger or stallone. Actually I'm surprised she wasn't asked to be in the Expendables. She's a top action star, and to say that she was ""lesser known"" at the time of the movie is a bit misleading, she won an oscar and did some great films, and most fanboys already know about Gia (which I happened to bump into when I was flipping through channels on cable) so the choice to pick her was a no-brainer. I love how an oscar winner can still get down and dirty with the rest of us, she's not too hung up on winning an oscar that she feels that action or comedy is beneath her. This movie rocks. The special effects are great and remind you of the games. Just like any movie based on a video game or comic book, there usually are updates/upgrades for the feature film, but I don't feel that harms this movie one bit. I think this is a great movie and anyone who is a fan of action movies or fan of video game movies will not be disappointed, and anyone who is looking for a serious plot and character development go read Crime and Punishment or Dante's Inferno. Action movies do not need to be overly thought out. We know she's a treasure hunter, we know she's the baddest one in the game and we know she won't lose, so sit back and enjoy and try not to overthink it.",1329264000,,2538,4.278586278586278

The very fabric of time is under threat and if she wants to save the world from the evil clutches of the Illuminati, she's going to have to get her skates on (not to mention an industrial-grade bra).

I have long been absolutely mad on the whole TR concept and, when this - the first film - was announced, I awaited it with great anticipation, although I was a little sceptical about the idea of Angelina Jolie playing Ms Croft. In all respects, though, this film easily achieves its goals and satisfies expectations.

The look of it is spectacular. It could easily have been spoiled by an inadequate budget or miserly set design, but really it looks fantastic.  Kick-ass action sequences, globe trotting locations and sumptuously stunning sets. Most importantly, the film tries very hard to remain faithful to the game series (and succeeds). The sets and story-line retain the (slightly corny) mysticism of the game, there are are some very TR-RPG camera angles and even the colouring and lighting seem to be strongly reminiscent.

Overall I think Ms Jolie does a fine job as the title character - she is acceptably English, suitably athletic, and appropriately pneumatic ""up front"" - a very convincing Lara Croft. It's nice to see Daniel Craig, Chris Barrie, Ian Glen, Julian Rhind-Tutt and even Leslie Phillips all playing their parts in support. I do feel that the producers rather overdid the ""Englishness"" of the film and the various players (pandering to the American audience, my inner bigot tells me) but one can't have everything and I suppose that the original Lara was in some ways a stereotypical Brit.

The film makes a nice addition to the TR franchise and, if you can forgive it it's rather simple-minded storyline and some enormous plot-holes (if the Illuminati can't find the artifact without Lara's help, and Lara doesn't want the Illuminati to find the atifact, then why does she end up helping them to find it?) it's a diverting and entertaining interlude.

13 B'ak'Tuns

In the 2001 Lara Croft: Tomb Raider movie, the protagonist Lara Croft had to recover two pieces of a Triangle of Light, which controls time itself, before it falls into the hands of the Illuminati.

Near the beginning of the movie, Croft finds a special clock which has several rotating rings and four compass-like points, very similar to the construction of the circular Mayan Calendar.

While recovering the first piece of the Triangle, Croft tells the antagonist if he puts the timer in the wrong place in the temple, they'll have to wait about another 5,000 years for the planets to be aligned once again.

5,000 Years is very close to the time period of 1 B'ak'tun on the Mayan Calendar.

Near the end of the movie when the Triangle is completed, both Croft and the antagonist are transported to an alternate reality with a large step pyramid with the triangle hovering in mid-air at the peak of the pyramid just like the All Seeing Eye on the Great Seal of the United States.

The step pyramid looks very similar to the step pyramid used by the Mayans to measure time for their long count calendar.  The same pyramid is seen earlier in the movie during a flashback sequence where Croft's father is explaining the Triangle of Light.

Once Croft obtains the Triangle of Light, she uses it to visit her deceased father, save her friend from death and attack the antagonist before shooting and destroying the triangle.

Many researchers on the Mayan Calendar believe once the calendar ends, people will have control over what they manifest in their lives as well as the flow of time itself as applied to alternate realities and parallel universes.

She seemed disengaged, which is a shame because on paper this works gloriously.  The plot is a shamble, but that is to be expected (I mean, it's not like the video game was too concerned about being plausible) but the tense engagement a person feels while sifting through clues on their own to `solve the puzzles' is lost in this unimaginative rendering of the prose.

1311326,3,B00003CXZ1,"Ever since taking the video game world by storm with the 1996 release of Tomb Raider, it seemed only a matter of time before the series' buxom heroine, Lara Croft, would find her way to Hollywood. Fast-forward to 2001, and gamers worldwide were anxiously awaiting the release of Lara Croft's first foray into the realm of live-action in ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"".

""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" chronicles one of the many adventures of Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie), a modern-day, female version of Indiana Jones. After uncovering a long-buried secret from her father's mysterious past, Lara learns she must seek out a powerful object known as The Triangle of Light. Upon embarking on this perilous quest, Lara soon discovers that she is not the only one interested in the artifact. A secret society known as The Illuminati hope to attain control of the Triangle, and if they succeed, our world could be in grave danger.

The fact that this movie is based on a wildly successful video game franchise almost guarantees that at best it will be viewed as a guilty pleasure by those that enjoy it. I for one can confirm that while I did enjoy the movie, the experience is firmly cemented in the aforementioned arena. Now, some could view this status as a bad thing, I for one do not, in most cases; especially, if the creative forces behind the film appear content with that rating.

The moment the movie began it was crystal clear that this was never intended to be taken all that seriously as a film. From the writers to the director and stars, basically everyone associated with the movie undoubtedly knew that this was to be nothing more than pure, unadulterated fun. Just watch ten minutes of the movie and you understand instantly who this movie was geared towards. Obviously, its primary focus was to entertain the core audience of gamers that love the franchise and any teenage guys (or adult men) who enjoy non-stop action, explosions, guns, and above all... seeing Angelina Jolie on screen. In all of these areas, I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this movie succeeded with great ease; hence, the guilty pleasure status.

Written by Patrick Massett and John Zinman (both are writers on TV's ""Friday Night Lights"") the story appears to have one simple goal: take the audience from action scene A to action scene B and so on. If you're lucky, there could be a little bit of character development sprinkled throughout, just enough to feed the potential sequel; other than that, the plot is fairly thin and not particularly imaginative. Although, for a movie like this, I really didn't expect much more, so I'm not that surprised by the lacking storyline. However, due to the fact that the video games, on which the film was based, are actually quite rich in story (especially nowadays); I for one wish that the writers had put in a little more time and effort into making the story interesting rather than filler between action set pieces. Like I said, the writers clearly had one goal (albeit a far too simple one) and in that they succeeded, but a little more work would have been appreciated.

Helming the movie is director Simon West, whose previous work on the action-packed ""Con Air"" and the thriller ""The General's Daughter"" proved he had what it took to make an entertaining movie. In terms of this film's action, there is no denying that Simon West provided some very exciting action sequences; however, there were a few shortcomings where the action featured visual effects. These flaws, I believe, exposed Simon's inexperience in the realm of CGI, and became a slight detriment to the final product. While scenes involving predominantly real people were fast-paced and exciting, those featuring virtual characters looked awkward and lacked the momentum that carried the other sequences so well. Case in point would be the opening scene involving the training robot that Lara fights. There are moments in this scene that look great, but other times it looks amateurish at best. Despite his action movie experience, perhaps someone more proficient than Simon West in the use of visual effects would have been better suited to direct this film.

Even though Simon West's directing was sometimes hampered whenever CGI was present, that doesn't absolve the various effects houses from shouldering some criticism. Some of the special effects in the movie look great even to this day; however, there were others that looked weak upon the film's release and look just as bad, if not worse now. Due to the fact that over ten different visual effects companies were used on this film, perhaps ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" is yet another example of too many hands stirring the pot. Honestly, when this film was released there were numerous other movies in theaters that were just as CGI intensive, if not more so, and many of them looked excellent from start to finish. What it boils down to is this, there is no excuse for a movie with a budget as big as this one's (around $115 million) to not feature top-notch visual effects. Shame on the various effects houses for not producing better work than what was on display.

In an all-out action movie, such as this one, it's not surprising when the cast doesn't exactly receive award nominations or blow anyone away with their performances. To be honest, I doubt anybody expected any different from a video game adaptation. Although, there was one member of the film's cast that was a bit of a surprise to me. It wasn't the choice that surprised me, but the fact that the person actually accepted the role. The cast member I'm referring to is none other than the star herself, Academy Award winner Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft.

What made the surprise a pleasant one, aside from the obvious appeal of Angelina in the role, is that it's fun to see actors and actresses who are willing to set aside the critics and the awards from time to time. Whenever a star chooses to participate in a project because it's fun and shows potential to be a real crowd pleaser is almost always a treat. Of course, this decision could have turned very ugly for Ms. Jolie had the movie not been a success, as so many other equally talented actors and actresses have discovered. Even though the risk was potentially great, I'm sure the reward of a growing fan base as a result of a successful adaptation was well worth it in the end.

Prior to her casting, Angelina could have easily passed as a real life version of the character based solely on her looks or at least served as possible inspiration for the character's appearance. Another reason her casting surprised me was because the role was so unlike most of her previous work, which had been predominantly dramatic in nature, not counting ""Gone in 60 Seconds"". Even with her relative inexperience in the world of action films, Angelina handled the role rather well. There were just a few moments where she seemed a little uncertain of herself, but generally she stayed true to the character's confident nature as depicted in the video games.

Aside from Angelina, the remainder of the cast wasn't really comprised of any really recognizable Hollywood talent. Well, let me clarify, veteran actor Jon Voight (""Transformers"") does have a few scenes as Lara Croft's father (he also happens to be Angelina's real-life father), so I guess my statement's not completely true. His appearance in the film, basically a glorified cameo, did assist in providing the movie's extremely sparse dramatic moments, lending some weight to an otherwise lightweight affair.

Actor Daniel Craig, who has become much more recognizable the last few years thanks to his role as James Bond, appears in a relatively generic role as a rival tomb raider who fancies himself Lara's better, despite all evidence to the contrary. Daniel plays the role as one-dimensional as the very paper it was written on. He never once injected any real sense of life into the role to make it more exciting or interesting for the viewer, and as a result his character is easily forgettable. Yet, I must give him some slack, because clearly the script didn't call for much depth to this character, or any others; so, perhaps he wasn't confident enough in his career or craft to make decisions that would affect his character's story.

The other actors in this movie were adequate for their roles, but just like Daniel Craig's, they were fairly straight-forward, cookie-cutter cut-outs of typical action movie characters we've seen a thousand times before. British actor Noah Taylor did provide the movie some fairly humorous moments as Lara's assistant and technical genius, Bryce. Again, aside from some good comedic timing, Noah didn't really bring anything terrific to the role, but he was at least more memorable thanks to his humor than most of the other supporting roles.

It occurred to me while watching the movie that the lack of any truly interesting characters, aside from the titular one, coupled with a fairly unoriginal and basic plot, could have served as an example of how not to make a film adaptation based on a video game or otherwise. However, the film's terrific turn at the box office allowed it to emerge victorious over its various inherent faults. Despite its drawbacks, I have to say that ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" is a superficially entertaining action adventure. Just be sure to check your brain at the door first.

""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" is rated PG-13 for violence and brief sensuality.",1259452800,,9460,4.845915841584159

Jolie mainly is there to show off her chest in tight tee-shirts and perform near-impossible stunts. To her credit, she went to extreme lengths to get herself physically-fit for the role.

Audio-wise, this is a one of the better DVDs you will ever hear, with excellent use of the surround speakers. Nice scenery, a sharp picture and low profanity also are pluses. Yes, the action is a little much and too loud in spots but otherwise ""Tomb Raider"" is a fun adventure that is recommended to all.

p.s. Skip the sequel; it's a weak one.",1236297600,2,884,4.7272727272727275

Here's the thing: if Lara's dad wants to stop the triangle being rebuilt so that its destructive power won't be unleashed on the world, and it requires the clock to get hold of the triangle, why does he tell Lara where the clock is in the first place? Furthermore, if two parts of this artefact are necessary to make it work, Lara surely doesn't need to destroy both. Why doesn't she just destroy the first part when she gets it, as this would make the second part useless? Thirdly, when we find out finally that the triangle needs a further part, where is it? Inside the clock, of course. Surely this begs the question, why not just destroy the piece inside the clock, which Richard Croft actually had in his possession, thus rendering the triangle inoperative?  The fact that Bryce watches the Clangers was the only thing that stopped this movie being a total waste of time.",1220486400,,1049,4.695652173913044
1311391,4,B00003CXZ1,"After finding this, and its sequel, in my collection, much to my surprise because I don't remember owning them or wanting to own them, I decided to re-watch them.

To my surprise, I found them more palatable than the first time around, though this one still inferior to the second one.

Perhaps it's because I came to the film again with litte or no expectations, as opposed to when I saw it at a sneak preview with huge expectations (despite never playing the game).  It could be that this is literally the first role I saw Daniel Craig in (Road to Perdition being the second).  It amused the hell out of me that American Angelina Jolie used a British accent and British Daniel Craig used an American one (better than Jolie's).

There is still more humor and quirkiness in Lara's inherited Butler and beyond quirky boy-Friday who creates all her wonderful toys in addition to computer hacking with ease.  At this point, I can't help but feel that Jolie simply hadn't gotten comfortable with her character as well as she did in the second.

Still, she pulls off the high-action skills with grace, emotes well when it comes to her dead father (ironically played by her real father, absent most of Jolie's life and then banished not long after this when he announced to the world he thought she was in serious psychological danger when in fact she was at the point that left Billy Boy and cutting behind and had become a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador and adopted her first child).  Her constant, ""Hmmm,"" and head-cock when confronted with something that surprises her even has become less-grating and more endearing now.

For those who have seen it and panned it, give it a second go.  For those who haven't, approach it with the thought to not expect too much out of it, and you'll find it can be pretty fun.  As it is, I had to go raise my previous rating from 3 stars to 4 stars.",1219536000,,1875,4.534124629080119

1311395,2,B00003CXZ1,"I've been with Lara Croft since the first Tomb Raider game--the version for Sony Playstation--and I can tell you this is not only a great way to screw up a perfectly good setting and a perfectly good story, but also a great way to screw up a main character.  Sure, I believe in evolution; by the time this movie began production, Lara Croft had been the protagonist of every game in the Playstation series FIVE times at this point.

First off, the first game was the only one with this combination: an interesting character, a good plot, interesting dialogue, an interesting script, a music score that works, an interesting setting albeit a not-so-action-oriented one but nonetheless immersive and captivating, mostly non-fictional-type enemies (like birds, bats, tigers, you know, animals of the forest, and a few humans too), a ""free-roaming"" three-dimensional world, and even good voice acting.  This combination was a real development for videogames because, before the first game released in 1996--1995 on another system--not many of these things happened.  But, the quality of all of these thing noted here had changed in the sequel games.  Some things had just-as-good quality and some things were not just-as-good, depending on the sequel.  As a series, the first game was really a push for Lara as a character.  It is essential to carry the traits of that character forward into the sequels.  But, after five games on the Playstation, if anyone's going to make a movie and call it ""Tomb Raider,"" if anyone's going to depict the titanic ""Lara Croft,"" one must be faithful, regardless of whether or not its writers decide to include the transformations in the sequel games or not--it doesn't matter.

At the heart of things, Lara Croft is the daughter of an English aristocrat.  I can't tell you why anyone would ever think that Angelina Jolie, as likable and sexy as she is, would fit this character.  Does Jolie even attempt to put on an English accent?  No.  So then, I guess none of the storylined traits exist, and this film is solely about selling tickets and purifying the entire visual scenery when, in the game, this is not the purified thing.  And, in the game, it is Lara who appears sanitary only to prove otherwise, and that this is an important function of the character.  In this film, the character Lara Croft may as well have been the daughter of a New York City crack addict, because there is no sharing resemblance to the original game's ideas.

The Tomb Raider game was a genre piece.  It was only like the first ten minutes of the first film in the Indiana Jones series--or the protagonist of the old Atari, Activision game Pitfall--but it was more particularly supposed to be like, in plot, a marginally science fiction piece similar to the first ten minutes of The Fifth Element or the last hour-and-a-half of Stargate.  The plot of the first game was about a rugged and youthful daughter of a wealthy aristocrat who did not share in the interests of dirty corporate politics, and so her character juxtaposes them.  The story did not have Lara hating aristocratic wealth, but rather accepting it because she had been born into it, but with an appetite for adventure and the means to get there, financially, physically, and intellectually.  She's the kind of girl who must rather have been an Oxford University student of archeology than a politician like her parents--or whatever they did to make money, probably inheriting it and some titles from the English monarchy as well.  It just doesn't make sense to dispose of this past!  It's in Lara's genetic makeup.  One can't just remove these things and make a good movie starring Lara Croft; it's more than that.

Also is the problem of just plain bad decisions all around about the sanitized visuals and sanitized plot.  This film is just an action piece with dopey characters that Lara must avoid.  This isn't what Lara started out doing!  There were dopey characters, but Lara used to be an educated young woman.  In this film, she is just a female Rambo who likes caves.  There's no excuse for what she does in this film.  It's just stupidity.  Too much has been changed and, cinematically, the movie itself is either boring or has too many flaws.  It possesses very little of the originality in the first game, a coherent plot involving something better than a bunch of stupid moron-minded humans with the animals of the forest missing, all because Lara's gone and changed into James Bond now.  This film is a stupid action piece without a shred of credibility or intrigue, two things that abundantly made the first game so memorable.",1208563200,2,4619,4.821065989847716

Why people feel the need to post lenghty movie reviews here I'll never understnd.  But here is something that you might find useful to know:  the blu-ray edition is a real mess.  This happened to be the first film that I put into my new blue-ray player to view on my new 1080p tv and I was shocked.  The film is shockingly grainy.  I could see all kinds of grain and noise and garbage in the picture through much of the movie.  It looked like a really poorly made standard def movie.  I started playing with my player and tv thinking surely I must have not set the right options on it or something.  Either that or my equipment must be horribly defective in some way.  It wasn't until I tried a couple other blu-ray disks that I realized what a poor transfer this disk is.

1311439,3,B00003CXZ1,"Video transfer quality is great. Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 soundtrack is very clean - I haven't listened to the DTS soundtrack, but it includes one. Special features are PLENTY, among which are both a trailer and a teaser trailer in HD.

If you enjoy this movie, I would say you get a great value for the money with the quality and all the features. If you've never seen this movie before, and you feel the same way as I do about some of the other movies I've reviewed here on Amazon, then you may feel the same way as I do about ""Tomb Raider"" as well.

My first impression - having all the bells and whistles of a great surround system - leads me to conclude that it's plenty ""Tomb"" but not quite ""Raider"".

The story is decent as far as ""adventures"" go, perhaps more on the unconvincing side, but the action seemed small to me: gunfire petite...explosions dainty...somewhat corny...Lara evades a gunman's barrage of bullets in the main lobby of her mansion like a schoolyard tetherball going around its pole, and I couldn't help but be reminded of writings I remember from the U.S.S. Alabama - ""Lead Dammit, Lead!""

""Tomb Raider"" may be more of (but not necessarily) a ""chick flic"" adventure (pardon the reference) strongly cashing in on the ""daddy's little girl"" theme, which could easily alienate some. However, do not assume me biased about a female lead: I found ""Aeon Flux"" to be an outstanding film - it too has a female lead.

It turns out I honestly just didn't like this movie. If you're a fan of the ""Tomb Raider"" videogame, or of Angelina Jolie, or of archeological adventures or of the aforementioned thematic structure, you might get a kick out of this film. If you're particular about your collection, you may want to be cautious about this one - but in its defense, it's all a matter of taste.

1311548,4,B00003CXZ1,"Lara Croft started out as a videogame heroine in Core Design's TOMB RAIDER series, which at last count has six sequels on the shelves spread over 1996 to the present.  She's a world-class traveler, an expert in history and looting tombs (although with only good intentions), a martial arts expert and fantastic pistol marksman.  She's also good at jumping and solving puzzles.

Angelina Jolie does a terrific job of bringing the physical side of Lara to the silver screen, and she's beautiful to look at.  Jon Voight, Angelina's real father, plays her father in the movie.  Iain Glen plays the villain, Mandred Powell, who's working for the Illuminati, the secret society devoted to conquering the world for their own nefarious purposes.  Noah Taylor plays Bryce, Lara's computer-savvy partner-in-crime.  Daniel Craig delivers a lukewarm performance as Alex West, a rival tomb raider who has shared romance with Lara in the past.  Simon West directs.

The movie opens up with a blistering action piece that sums up what a lot of the Tomb Raider games were all about.  An all-out fight and escape inside a tomb with guns blazing.  Then the story segues to Lara hurting over the anniversary of her father's death and finding a mysterious clock that her father left for her.  The planets are due to line up in one week, and the clock will lead her a powerful artifact that can stop time itself.  Then Lara is up to her pretty little neck in bad guys and the race is on to find the two pieces of the Triangle of Light.

Although the action is fast and furious, it's light on characterization.  We don't really get to know much about Lara that wasn't revealed in the games.  And the bad guys are just evil, would-be world conquerors that can be gotten out of any ARE WE NOT VILLAINS catalogue.

TOMB RAIDER succeeds as a great B-movie, but it isn't anything more than that.  It's a chance to see a wellknown videogame heroine strut her stuff with awesome special effects and beautiful surroundings and authentic looking backgrounds.

Difficult to transform a video-game character into a real flesh and bone cinema character, against all the Draculas and Frankensteins who did the reverse trip. They had to bring some kind of English fabula into the picture, accent, tea and everything else, plus a touch of Cambodian safran buddhism and an ice-cube of Siberian whitish russianism. And it all works if you also add a pinch of extra-terrestrial magic that looks more like some Arabian astrology than anything from another constellation. But it does not really matter. Lara Croft is ready to run her first race with her chamber-valet and her rocking technical agent. And it works as much as we can hope, and in the end we can say the most admirable characters of the film are the sleigh-dogs who bring her back to her English mansion somewhere in a somewhat rainy tolerable climate. We recognized though some typical inspiration from the extremely British Clive Barker, but that might have been an illusion.

Being a fan of Angelina Jolie, I was not disappointed in her performance.  Despite a thin plot and cheesy effects, Angelina delivered her lines with class and finesse.  Unfortunately even her talent cannot overide an overall lack of plot and unbelievable situations.  The film grew tiresome very quickly.

On a Jungian level this film portrays a strange sterility.  The first scene is Lara upside down, in the middle of a training exercise set by her computer nerd flunkie and her all-purpose butler.  This opening segment defined the problem for the film--someone who is not grounded and unconscious.  Lara raids tombs and fights bad guys to no real purpose--except perhaps to pit her skills against someone else.  This cycle repeats endlessly, as do video games, which create a feeling of accomplishment where there is none, sterile endeavors with no learning and no personal or interpersonal gain.  The individual does not develop--just the skills.  Lara steals the ancient wealth of civilizations from tombs, co-opting heritage and treasure for the love of the game.  This disregard for cultural artifacts except as an exercise is indicative of lack of depth and insight.

In one moment in the movie, there is a clear symbol of the futility of this lifestyle--Lara puts everything aside to retrieve a memento of her dead father.  But then she reverts to form.  In addition there is no mention of her mother--what happened to her and why is this not a loss? Obviously this is such a deficit it cannot be referred to except obliquely by one scene where an enormous statue of a woman is destroyed, and by the total lack of other women in the film.

And Graeme Revell's score has it's moments, especially the father/ daughter reunion suite. Plus the DVD has some goods on it worth checking out. The best are the deleted/extended scenes ( That actually would've helped the film story-wise.) and insightful commentary by Simon West on why exactly he made ""Tomb Raider"" the way he did.

It has adventure with action and fantasy. I guess you  either love or you hate video game adaptions. Everybody on this website hated ""Super Mario Brothers"" and I liked it, and ""The Cat In The Hat."" I don't know why. That had the same humor as the Grinch. But that's not a video game originally. It's just something that I liked and everyone else, for no reason that I can think of, hated.

Heeeeerrreee'ss the plot:

The Illuminati is some kind of ""group"" that Lara Croft {Angelina Jolie} has to stop. In order to do that, she needs to find pieces to the Triangle of Light, which goes back to her father's {Jon Voight, her real-life father} past. He had been missing for quite some time and hadn't been found. She has to go and find them on a dangerous quest. I'm not sure what else to say about the plot.

Lara Croft has for many years lived in the fantasy of many gamers but now with her embodiment as Angelina they have someone to relate to.

Most of the movie stayed true to the game unlike many game-to-movies flicks nothing was jeopardized maybe because the game was so perfect in its fictitious depiction of a fantasy world, not to mention no shortage of exotic locations as well as conspiracies, urban legends, myths & human paranoia.

This movie is the quintessential pop-corn flick, complete with dim-witted yet attitudinal villains, tense & exciting action scenes, futuristic gadgets & an inconsequential romantic interlude.

This movie is a very good adaptation from a game, since I also love the games. Angelina was a good Lara Croft not just in the physical aspect but also in the attitude. She is as confident as the one in the games.

The movie also circles in a great plot line. The plot is very well served and not draggy, unlike other movies. It doesn't aim to much to inform people a lot about the Illuminati but supplies what the viewers need, not over or under that. The whole plot makes sense in a not so draggy way.

The adventure aspect is also well done. The exotic locations were mesmerizing as well as the action sequences. The stunts were very realistic, unlike the ones in movies like Charlie's Angels were people leap like animals. Here, Lara is very human but athletic, doing stunts that are actually possible to do and done very nice cinematically.

The movie overall is very enjoyable. its a fun action flick. It may lack depth or may fail to satisfy one but its an action flick. Let go and enjoy.",1114646400,6,1131,4.295774647887324
1311679,2,B00003CXZ1,"Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) is entering a tomb, trying to get to a jewel placed on a pedestal. As she makes her way towards the jewel, a large metal creature unsurfaces and she has to fight it to the death. After she does disable the creature, she retrieves the jewel which is actually a computer chip containing 'Lara's Party Mix', which she plays on the sound system in her mansion. The tomb was actually a training room built in her large English mansion. Soon, Lara discovers a clock hidden under a staircase by her deceased father (Jon Voight, Jolie's real father). The clock started ticking exactly one week before a complete solar eclipse is scheduled to happen. Inside the clock, she finds a dial, which when combined with a mythical triangle (which has, incidentally, been broken in half), gives the holder power over time. The holder can move back and forth within history, changing things. Naturally, a mysterious society, the Illuminata, headquartered in Venice, Italy, wants the device and hires Manfred Powell (Iain Glen) to retrieve it. Manfred hires Alex Marrs (Daniel Craig), Croft's former nemesis and fellow Tomb Raider to help him. Lara can't let the Illuminata gain control of the device.

""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" is the latest example of why Hollywood should not adapt video games into films. No more successful than ""Super Mario Brothers"", ""Tomb Raider"" will probably gross more than $100 million dollars because it caters so brilliantly to the pre-teen boy audience that loves the video game.

The film is filled with action set pieces, which look incredibly like set pieces. Each of the scenes is shot on a set. Each begins with the characters entering a room, tomb, cave, etc. and then, voila, they start fighting something, someone, each other. This creates a very claustrophobic feel which does not translate well to the big screen.

The film was reportedly shot on location in Greenland and a sacred temple in Thailand (?). If this is the case, the filmmakers did a very bad job of taking advantage of the natural scenery.

Jolie certainly fits the physical description of Lara Croft. She has the same voluptuous curves that the video game vixen uses to make grown men addicts of her adventures. I have never played the video game, so I am unsure whether Lara Croft is supposed to look so bored throughout. Jolie smirks and does little else to make the character seem believable. It appears as though the vial of Billy Bob's blood that she reportedly carries around her neck was missing most days when she shot her part. Where would they hide it? Jolie wears a series of skin tight t-shirts and short-shorts to reveal all of her assets.

It was no suprise to see that the filmmaker's managed to include a shower scene. After all, Croft is an archaeologist and needs to be squeaky clean for all of that roughhousing. I only wish they had managed to get a couple of shower scenes into the Indiana Jones films. NOT. As the film is PG, they only show Jolie from the neck up. Boy that water cascading down her hair and lips and neck looks sexy. Strangely, a little later in the film, Alex Marrs gets equal treatment. His shower scene is virtually identical to Croft's. Thank goodness for equal opportunity. I'm sure all of the little 12 year old boys in the audience will love to see a half naked man showering and then walking around his hotel room.

The other big problem with ""Tomb Raider"" is that we never actually see Croft engaging in any archaeology or tomb raiding, until the climax. Why is she so famous? What special skills does she have? Apparently, she can jump around on bungee cords and kill metal beasts quite well, but what about archaeology draws her into it? Apparently, nothing.

Oh, wait, there is another big problem. After the device is assembled (big surprise, I'm sure), Croft is told that she can't use it for a personal reason and then does any way. Huh? I wasn't even aware that she liked the person she uses it for.

Oh, oh, another problem... Oh, enough. ""Tomb Raider"" is a sloppy mess of an excuse for filmmaking. Will certainly join ""Pearl Harbor"" as one of the worst films of the summer if not the year.",1113264000,2,4161,4.706043956043956

1311686,3,B00003CXZ1,"Starring Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft. Co-starring a padded bra as Lara's breasts.

It's all I could ask in a summer movie - originality, action, a novel stunt or two, complete lack of plot, and breasts. First: the breasts, both of them. Since the Tomb Raider game was aimed at adolescent boys, physics and anatomical plausibility never limited the original Lara. Since the computer game was aimed at adolescent boys with mothers, the breasts stay covered, or at least off screen. I can barely imagine the building permit needed to construct a Lara-like padded bra, but the construction was successful. The bra's shape and movement reminded me in many ways of a human figure's. It disappointed me in one scene, though, where tee-shirted Lara climbs out of a moat into the chill of an ice-bound castle. The bra just couldn't rise to the occasion, and missed what could have been the high points of its role.

As to the plot, imagine a movie cut into twenty or thirty sections, scrambled, and spliced back together at random. Would you notice the difference? In Raider's case, probably not. That seems true to the original game, where a clueless player guides Lara randomly and repetitively through hazards meant to challenge a pre-teen on a sugar buzz. Movies from games rank just below movies from comic books for attention span and continuity - if you were looking for either, you probably picked up the wrong disc by mistake.

There's plenty of action, as in the game, without depending too much on chases, explosions, and fire. This may be the best feature of the movie: thoughtful, varied mayhem. The swashbuckling was only improved by being buckled onto Lara. Violence was mostly bloodless, although Lara briefly suffered a boo-boo on her arm. Gadgeteering, computer graphics, and stunts were pretty good. One of my favorite scenes was Lara's aerial ballet. You could easily see the bungee cords in that sequence - you were supposed to. I left wondering, though. Could she really have done all that on the ropes we saw, or was she also suspended by invisible ropes during the scene with the visible ropes? Make the most of that speculation. It's about as deep as Tomb Raider ever gets.

The movie really stands out for its use of originality. The wardrobe closet, dozens of identical outfits, was quite original when it first appeared in 'Last Action Hero'. I think the combination jungle gym and planetary model was original to 'Dark Crystal'. The uber-geek sidekick with advanced Personality Deficit Disorder and grooming malfunctions was probably original at some point, long before his appearance in 'Short Circuit'. The bring-it-down-around-their-ears ending to every 007 movie may not have been James Bond's at first, but he made it his own. There was lots of originality in Raider, but I'm sad to say it was all someone else's.

Tomb Raider is a fine bit of fluff, and you might enjoy it unless you liked Cider House Rules or Snow Falling on Cedars. You might enjoy it more if you're a testosterone-driven teenaged boy, or were one, or know one. This movie won't sink any of the actors' careers, but it probably won't launch any, either.

1311687,3,B00003CXZ1,"A lot of people have said this is a video game made into a movie, but actually it's not, it's just a video game that you watch.  In a game, you solve puzzles and shoot things.  When you make that into a movie, there's a gigantic, gaping hole in it where the main character should be.  Lara Croft has no personality.  She's emotionally distant, humorless, cold and unknowable.  As someone else said, she's ""uber-cool"", to the point of not really being human anymore.  She seems to be able to relate more to gadgets and machines than people.  When she's fighting a robot, riding a motorcycle, or trying to figure out the secrets of an ancient clock, she has a sparkle in her eye.  Her character really comes to life.  Yet as soon as she has nothing to do but relate to her fellow humans, all hope is lost.  She totally shuts down and just sits there, or stands there, bored out of her mind. This is the reason parents don't like their children to sit and play video games all day long, and insist they go out and play with their friends.  You might wind up being able to relate only to gadgets and having no use for people as well.

But don't get me wrong, I liked the movie.  I thought the special effects were really cool (...).  But just imagine how good a film it would have been if the (...) had a personality as well?  I mean, wow, you could have had something on the level of the Indiana Jones movies then.

Oh, how I disagree with that on so many levels.

Has this movie been praised because it stars a woman in skintight clothing? Bearing next to nothing? All while flying around, doing action sequences, and over the top stuff like that?

Because that's what I think has given this movie any appeal at all! I cannot stand Angelina Joelie, but putting that aside to actually focus on the fact that she is portraying a rip-off of Indiana Jones, and wearing, well, what some people would consider sexy attire/cloths... but to me, sex doesn't sell a movie. If you haven't got a good movie, then don't expect showing some skin will make it any better!

The movie is terrible, Angelina's performance is sickening, not only the cloths she wears to gain that attention of that kind of audience, but also her acting both inhales and exhales (work it out, Amazon will filter my exact words for that)

If your a guy who want to see a chick put on some sexy clothing to get your attention to try and distract you from a pointless, un-thought out scene with special FX from time to time, then you will love this movie!

If you can actually stand Angelina Goalies conceded acting, then you might like it.

But if your like me, and see through the B.S of trying to get a sexy image to sell, then you'll see how this movie fails to bring a decent woman onto the screen for an action role!

I hope some actress becomes a super action star sometime soon, one maybe so even bigger then any male action star, but Angelina is not the one to look out for. Sex does not sell in my book!

We know the stunts will be outrageous along with a lot of other things. If you look past all that you really can enjoy Tomb Raider.
Lara Croft Tomb Raider is a simple enough plot. Lara(Angelina Jolie)must find the Triangle of Time. It's a legendary artifact that is capable of altering time and space as we know it. She must find the artifact before the evil secret society of the Illuminati do. The society is led by Manfred Powell(Iain Glen)who is set on using the artifact for his own eveil purposes. It's now up to Lara to stop the Illuminati and Manfred before it is to late.
Angelina Jolie really is the reason to watch the film. She looks fantastic in the movie and it's probaly the best she has ever looked. She plays the video game heroine to perfection and nobody could have pulled it off quite like she did. She did all her own stunts in the film and even learned how to fire weapons and train for the part from a former SAS agent.
The only knock I have against the film is the traveling the movie. In a span of not even three days Lara goes from England to Cambodia back to England and then to someplace in North Western Russia. Thats a little far stretched even for a video game based character.
This really is a three star movie but the DVD extras bump it up to a four. There are deleted scenes and an altered main title sequence. You get the specials on how they crafted Angelina Jolie into Lara Croft. There is a special on the visual effects in the movie which are decent. You also get directors commentary from Simon West.

1311791,1,B00003CXZ1,"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider is an amalgamation of everything it is I hate about summer movies.  It's lifeless, soulless, crafted without the slightest care towards genuine enjoyment, and serves as nothing more than a springboard for a charisma-free star.  I'm still flabbergasted over the irony that the inspiration for the existence of this movie was Indiana Jones, the trilogy that represents the summer blockbuster at its very best.
Tomb Raider boasts something of a plot, but actually deciphering it is a puzzle.  Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) is apparently some sort of rich archaeologist, and her latest personal mission is to search for two artifacts that, if placed together, can somehow enable the user to control time.  Naturally, there are going to be a lot of villains who seek the same device.
General incomprehensibility of the plot aside, the aspect that makes Tomb Raider the turd that it is is Lara Croft, both in the way this character is written and through Jolie's portrayal.  Here is a heroine who thinks she's just uber-cool, riding motorcycles, wearing slick shades, acting cocky and arrogant, to the point of pure abrasiveness.  This is not to mention that she's also able to accomplish physically implausible to impossible stunts, and is also apparently invincible in combat, and almost impervious to pain.
What kind of a heroine is this?  It's hard enough to like someone who spends most of her time trying to act superior to almost everyone around her (the movie does give a half-hearted attempt to show her respect for other cultures, this brief scene totally overshadowed by her ""coolness""), but the filmmakers do away with even the slightest bit of suspense by making Croft apparently invulnerable to harm in all her surroundings.  Part of what made Indiana Jones so charming were his numerous flaws: he was afraid of snakes, often got captured by the villains, and was vulnerable in combat (he got beat up a LOT).  This is in stark contrast with Croft, who's really nothing more than a superhero without the villain to match her.
Some of this could be forgiveable if the movie were in any way fun or exciting, but it's not.  The action sequences are few in number, and what little there are are rapid-cut and packed with one impossible stunt too many.  The movie's adventure holds no ebb and flow, Croft simply gets from one location to another in a second of screen time.
It's not impossible to make an enjoyable Indiana Jones knock-off.  Stephen Sommers' The Mummy accomplished the task with exuberance and childish glee.  But Simon West merely gave us little more than a case of eyestrain.

1311792,2,B00003CXZ1,"Tomb Raider is a good idea.  It's always been a good idea, and so when I see it in the video game store or playing at the cineplex, I want to try it out, because it's such a good idea.  Unfortunately, a good idea isn't everything, and no Tomb Raider product has ever fully capitalized on the ""idea"" of Tomb Raider, and this movie is a prime example.  For roughly 100 minutes, we watch Lara Croft chase after some guy, blow stuff up, fight supernatural beings, and blah-blah-blah... why don't I care?  Because she's an adventurer, but in this film, all she does is follow the bad guy.  If you want to watch Angelina Jolie for 100 minutes, this film is good for that, so give it a rental.

1311793,3,B00003CXZ1,"In late 2000, it was official: video game legend ""Tomb Raider"" was to be adapted in to a major motion picture.  Fans rejoiced as they learned that sexy superstar Angelina Jolie would play the title role - what more could you possibly want?  The end result is LARA CROFT: TOMB RAIDER.
Jolie plays Lara Croft, a female Indiana Jones who is basically the same.  (The only big difference is she has a mansion, while he had a small house)  Racing against time and battling against an array of enemies (including a few creatures), Croft teams with ex Alex West (Daniel Craig) to recover an ancient artifact which allows it's users to travel through time.  Therefor, it would be pretty bad in the enemy's hands.  It's up to tightly-dressed, well-armed Ms. Croft to save the day while she kicks the enemy's ass.
First of all, let me say that I went into the theater expecting an ""updated"", more modern version of Indiana Jones.  I came out with a completely different version of the film.  While sporting some nice action scenes, TOMB RAIDER is unfortunately not much more than a showcase for star Jolie (not that I mind...).  There is fair directing, fair acting, fair just about everything except for a really nice techno soundtrack.
If you don't expect an action/adventure film with Spielberg's direction and fun, then you'll be okay.

Just like they did with Tomb Raider. But it shocked me to find out so many of the fans also hated it. The only excuse I found was ""The only way it related to Tomb Raider was the title."" I didn't understand this. It has Lara Croft looking, talking and acting in the exact way she does in the games. She raids tombs like she does in the games. Everything seemed perfect to me. So what was different? Why didn't the fans like it? The answer is Lara's father. In the game Lara's parents disown her and Lara makes her fortune on her own. In the movie Lara's father loves her and is killed on an adventure. That's it. That's why this movie was trashed so badly. Can you believe it? I've played all the Tomb Raider games and even I didn't pick up on that difference because it's so minuscule. It's like Batman fans not liking the Batman movies because the bat symbol on his chest was a half inch too small. It's this kind of nit picking that completely ruins the movie going experience. Tomb Raider is an excellent old fashion adventure movie and if people would take it for what it is then it would get the respect it deserves.

1311862,4,B00003CXZ1,"Tomb Raider, starring Angelina Jolie, brings the popular video game to the big screen to fine results.
THE STORY:
Lara Croft, the Tomb Raider, must search the world for a mysterious relic that holds to key to controlling time and prevent it from falling into the wrong hands.
THE COOL THINGS:
For fans of the video games, Jolie's depiction of Lara Croft is just amazing.  It really does feel like the game come to life with the mysterious locales, mysterious artifacts, treacherous monsters and rival tomb raiders.  Easily the main driver of this movie is it's myriad of action sequences and the awesome special FX.  The cool background story of ""a Father and Daughter's Love that Defies Time"" is another cool aspect to the film.
BEST SCENES:
1. The Mansion Battle
2. The Battle in the Cambodia Temple
3. The Last Fight Scene
THE CRITICAL ANALYSIS
All cool things aside, the storyline takes a major backseat to the action here however.  The rough gist of the story was Lara's need to prevent the time control device from falling into the wrong hands but to be honest, the actual storytelling gets quite confusing and if you blink for a minute you'll probably miss a lot of the story development.  The movie itself moves at a frantic pace and if not paying attention carefully you'll definitely miss out on some key plot developments (such as why are we suddenly in this particular locale).  Don't feel too bad though, it's the poor storytelling and not your lack of attentiveness.
That being said though, you're more than likely watching this movie for the eye candy (action, FX and Lara Croft) and not the brilliant storytelling.
THE DVD EXTRAS:
Like most action film DVDs of late, what the movie lacks is MORE than made up for in the awesome extras package of the DVD.  Among the cornucopia of awesome goodies in this batch are:
1. ""Crafting Lara Croft"" - 7 minute featurette about Angelina Jolie's extensive martial arts and weapons training to prepare for her role as Lara Croft.  Cool stuff.  Remind me not to mess with her...
2. Director's Audio Commentary Track - Always insightful
3. 4 Deleted Scenes - Some good, some alright
4. ""Stunts"" - 8 minute featurette about how some of the action stunts (particularly the
Mansion battle scene) were filmed.
5. ""Digging Into Tomb Raider"" - 25 minute feature that talks about the entire movie including it's video game origins, the stunts, Jolie's training as well as shooting on location in Cambodia and Greenland.
6. Music Video - ""Elevation"" by U2
7. ""Are You Game?"" - 8 minute featurette that talked about the Tomb Raider games and how they translated the game to the big screen.
8. Alternate Main Title Sequence
9. Visual FX - Several mini featurettes on how they filmed all the big Special FX scenes in the movie.  Cool stuff!!!
THE VERDICT:
While the story and storytelling may be pretty lacking, this film DOES deliver the goods in spades in terms of action and FX so viewers will be pleased in the action category and the story is easy enough to follow along and get the ""basic gist"" of if nothing else.
For fans of the Tomb Raider games you'll be pleased with the rendering of everyone's favorite action heroine and the DVD extras provide some awesome insight into the world of Lara Croft.
Overall, action fanatics should be pleased with this film which is great for a rental or a purchase.  The awesome DVD extras make it a solid addition to your collection if you're so inclined.
GRADES:
The Movie:  3  stars
The DVD Extras:  5 stars

1311863,4,B00003CXZ1,"I know the professional reviewers thought this movie was awful, but since I have played several of the Tomb Raider video games, I enjoyed it for what it was, a video game come to life. Angelina Jolie really captured Croft. The sets were very similar to video game levels. Jolie pretty much had to perform the same kind of stunts to get out of the scene as you do to get off the level. It was exciting to see the character I have manipulated so many hours on my computer come to life. And seeing a big-breasted woman firing big guns, swinging on ropes or leaping over cars on a motorcycle....well, that's just hot. What more can you want? Plot? Don't be silly. It had a plot. Find this shiny thing. Same plot as the video games. That's plenty plot.",1060387200,,747,4.3428571428571425
1311864,4,B00003CXZ1,"I liked this movie very much but I really think it could have been so much more.  With very little changes, i think this could have been more *indiana jones* and less video game...  I think the characters were all too much like the ones in a game...flat.  While they were certainly quirky and had potential I never got to the point that I really cared about (or against) any of them all that much.  The characters in the indiana jones movies all seemed to sparkle to me...The tomb raider characters never seemed to quite get *there*.
That said...it was a fun, escape movie and heavy on the action.  Interesting special effects but nothing that was overly distracting.  I thought the end climactic segment was a bit loose...  But overall I am glad I saw it at the movies on a large screen...altho a large screen TV with a good sound system would be good too.
I think they have a solid beginning for a series of tomb raider movies.  I hope that they work on the characters.  There can only be so much action before you have to actually care about the people.",1060300800,,1056,4.402061855670103

I have watched it a couple of times, and I haven't fallen asleep or read a book.  You have to like action movies to enjoy this one.  There is no real drama behind the movie.

1311866,5,B00003CXZ1,"Instead of your typical pumped full of steroids male, you get the very svelte, toned & very female, Angelina Jolie, playing the computer game heroine. Making a computer game into a film has not always been well accepted in cinemas - for example, Mortal Kombat & Resident Evil - but this one is a sure-fire hit for the studio. Had they not picked Angelina, it might not have been that good. I can't see it being good without her. You really can't imagine anyone else in that role now. She's taken it and made it hers.
Apart from the physical attributes she brings to the role (put the tongues away guys), she also manages to speak very well in an English accent, which actors have failed to do so in the past. (Think Keanu Reeves in `Bram Stoker's Dracula' or Tom Cruise's pitiful excuse for an Irish accent in `Far & Away')
Angelina has been well known for her tattoos, so the studio probably weren't that keen on her for the role, because of the difficulty make-up artists would have had covering them up. None of them can be seen during the film - particularly the well-known `Billy Bob' tattoo on her left arm. It's not easy to cover up tattoos, and sure, some of her tattoos are in parts of her body which wouldn't be shown on film, but that `Billy Bob' tattoo must have been HELL for makeup artists every day.
The CGI & the set are extremely similar to `The Mummy' and `The Mummy Returns', and all three films obviously take their inspiration from the Indiana Jones movies.
There's not as much action or violence as I expected in this film, I expected a lot more. There are bursts of violence, interspersed with strange scenes, with a haunting/pounding soundtrack. The use of guns is big in this film, shooting the strange CGI, or shooting bad guys - none of whom seem seriously hurt!
I know he's dead in the film, but Jon Voight, as Lara's father (and also her father in real life!), should have had a bigger role. He's only really seen at the start, opposite a young actress playing a young Lara Croft, and then at the end, playing opposite his real-life daughter.
If you're a fan of Red Dwarf, look out for Chris Barrie (Rimmer), in the very Batman butler role of Henry.
I didn't expect to enjoy this movie, but as I like Angelina Jolie as an actress, I thought I'd give it a go. It's very fast paced, the time flies by and before you know it, it's over. I'm glad I bought it now.",1059177600,8,2388,4.3927765237020315
1311867,4,B00003CXZ1,"As pleased as I was by Angelina's performance as an action star - I completely found her believable as a gun-toting English woman - and the action overall, somehow I found the movie not completely satisfying. The plot was just a little too simplistic. Lara Croft has to find something that gives her control over time before the bad guys do so she can talk with her father, whom she lost as a child.
The bad guys belong to a conspiracy known as The Illuminati. As it turns out, Croft's father also belonged, and this is why he's able to give her one of the keys to the device. She must get a few others though, and this leads her to remote parts of the world.
The movie feels like one long chase scene. My favorite action bit was the very beginning as Lara works out with a robot programmed to kill her, just for practice.
The action is great, special effects are terrific, so I'm not sure why I can't give this movie 5 stars. It's not something I can put into words. I purchased the DVD in order to look at the special features - it has a great documentary on the making of, which I really enjoyed, but I doubt I'll be watching this movie more than 2 or 3 times. I'm definitely looking forward to the sequal though. I think with the success from the first film they'll be able to get better screenwriters and even more funds for greater stunts. Then they'll really have a winner!",1057881600,,1380,4.291187739463601
1311868,1,B00003CXZ1,"A friend brought this movie over the other day.  Let me sum this movie up.
1) Angelina Jolie gets in a new outfit and slinks around to techno music for 5 minutes.
2) Rinse, repeat.
Throw in a shower scene to distract the audience from the fact that if they cut out all of the slow motion catwalk clothes modeling the movie would be 30 minutes shorter.
The best part was when they do the same slow motion techno blah blah when they are showing the tomb raiding convoy drive across a frozen tundra in their jeeps.",1057708800,3,511,4.268041237113402
1311869,5,B00003CXZ1,"Oddly enough, if I were writing reviews when I first went and saw this film at the theater when it was first released, I probably would've given it only a three or four star review and slightly panned it, especially since the producers felt it necessary to ""overly endow"" Angelina Jolie.  There are times in the movie where one might get the impression she may get ""knocked"" out.
Not unlike other films though, this one kind of grows on you and can be appreciated for what it is, a great action film couched a reasonably well thought out plot.  One of the most important aspects to the success or lack thereof in this film was the leading role of Lara Croft.  The decision to cast the ever beautiful Angelina Jolie was right on target.  I can honestly say that I don't think I've ever watched any of her previous movies, but I can say that she performs quite exceptionally in the role of the female ""Indiana Jones/James Bond"" type superhero.  The fact that she spent several months preparing for this film and performed the majority of the stunts makes this movie that much more appreciable, especially considering the effort she put into it.  Her reactions, facial movements and overall style of acting certainly adds a good ""flavor"" to the movie as well.
Of particular note is the style in which this film was produced.  Given that it is based on a video game and previous efforts to project video games onto the silver screen have come off as ""campy"" and lame, the producers made an outstanding decision to put this film in a ""serious"" light, with a mostly workable plot.  Given that I've only had a passing familiarity with the video games themselves, I don't really wish to comment on that particular aspect.
Of the many great action films I've watched over the years, I'd rate this one pretty high as it definitely exceeds expectations and leaves you wishing for more, which brings to mind the pending release of the second Tomb Raider movie.  Hopefully this movie will stand up to or exceed the popularity of this first Tomb Raider film!
The premise:
Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft, Tomb Raider performs exceptionally well; from A to Z she immersed herself in this role, including an extremely believable British accent.  The film begins with a great main title and opening sequence where Lara Croft if ""battling"" Simon, a machine that is well bent towards killing her.  This of course, is but the first of many outstanding action sequences for the Tomb Raider.
From there we're brought into the real plot which is Lara Croft, prompted by dreams and letters from the grave starts to piece together clues about her missing and presumed dead, father.  This brings her into the hunt for an ancient and powerful device while at the same time dealing with another person who is seeking this device for not so altruistic purposes.
I highly recommend this film to any and all that are fans of great action sequences/films that ""actually"" contain a reasonably decent plot.  {ssintrepid}

1311927,2,B00003CXZ1,"I have to confess that I liked a number of moments in this film, despite the fact that it is without any question overall a pretty bad film. I could compile a long list of absurdies connected with it. For instance, while I know that part of the point of the movie is to promulgate the legend of Lara Croft, sex goddess, is there really any excuse for her wearing a thin duster that she never closes over a very tight-fitting shirt while sled dogging in Siberia? The overall list of silly moments in this film could be expanded far beyond the amount of space that isalloted any reviewer.  Most of the sexual tittilation seems more appropriately targeted at adolescents than grown ups, but, then, that is true of the Tomb Raider games as well.
So after these negative comments, why do I still find things to enjoy? Well, for one thing, some of the fight scenes are, if not believable, at least quite inventive and fun in their over-the-top silliness. For another, Angela Jolie is never short of absolutely marvelous to behold. Had the movie merely consisted of her strolling down a sidewalk, with those beautiful lips and other unquestionably enhanced features, the movie would have been salvaged from complete disaster. If the movie fails, it isn't her fault. Although the idea of bringing any character as supranaturally athletic as Lara Croft to screen is daunting, Angelina performs far better than could possible have been anticipated. If she struts and poses a bit more than one might like, she still managed to carry off the role with some aplomb.
In closing, I would like to ask, when will we see an end to movies based on computer games? So far, we have had to witness a long list of terrible movies based on otherwise decent computer games. I played Tomb Raider when it first came out, and a couple of its sequels, and I have to admit they were pretty good games. But with absolutely terrible movies based on Super Mario Brothers, Wing Commander, Mortal Kombat, and others, you have to wish for filmmakers to decide not to make any further cinematic adaptations. Actually, TOMB RAIDER is actually one of the better film versions of a game, and that ought in itself to stand as a warning to Hollywood.",1051142400,,2208,4.661538461538462

 Angela Jolie does her best to breath life into the buxom action heroine, but it was a difficult task. The movie (loosely based upon the videogame) has a meandering action plot, (which seemed to be designed to show Jolie's figure to its best advantage) and an immense special effects budget which might feed a small third world country.

Director Simon West admitted that he wanted to distance the film from the game because Lara Croft is an interesting person all by herself, but this is way beside the point.  The point is, this is a Tomb Raider movie, so it should have remained loyal to the game.  When the costume designer was asked why Angelina Jolie was not sporting Lara's traditional duds, she said that was Angelina's decision, because she doesn't like bright colors.  Excuse me, but since when do the capricious whims of slightly crazy actresses determine how a multi million dollar license is treated on film?  I was very disheartened at how the game was completely disrespected in this movie, not only in the outfits, but in little things like names and character histories.

1312083,4,B00003CXZ1,"Before I even watched this movie, I was convinced that this movie was gonna suck. After seeing such horrible video game-to-movie disasters as Super Mario Brothers, Street Fighter, and the Mortal Combat movies, I only decided to see this movie because of the presence of Angelina Jolie. To my surprise, I walked out of the theatre very satisfied with what I saw.

First, the plot was very good. I expected this movie to be a shoot-em-up movie with almost no story, but boy was I wrong! The plot of this movie is one of the most complex (and one of the coolest) I've ever seen! Put simply, Lara Croft must use a mysterious, ancient clock she found to race against the Illuminati to get the two halves of an ancient triangle. (The two halves are hid at opposite ends of the globe.) When the two halves are put together, they can alter time, but this can only happen during the planetary alignment, which only happens every 5,000 years.

Filling in the gaps are some great action scenes, which includes fighting giant rock monsters, a fight in Lara's mansion, and more. Also, Angelina's character is actually devloped in this film. I expected just some nudity or something, but instead there are emotional scenes that tastefully develop her as a person as well as her past.

Everything else is top-notch in this movie: The special effects are great and the villains are truly convincing. The sets are wonderful, as is the cinemetograpghy. The acting is decent and the action scenes are well executed. (Angelina Jolie trained for 3 months to learn fighting techniques and how to operate firearms for this film.)

The only flaw to this movie is that it sort of rips off Indiana Jones and the ending is sort of weak. But most people will be able to forgive the ending because of the earlier events in the movie.

Simply put, this movie is a must-see for action/adventure fans and anyone who appreciates a good story.

2001; 100 minutes; Rated PG-13 for intense but muted sequences of action/adventure violence, mild language, and some sensuality.",1028332800,2,2039,4.745762711864407
1312084,5,B00003CXZ1,"When the coming alignment of all the planets in the solar system triggers the ticking of a clock hidden away by Lara Croft's  (Angelina Jolie) eccentric archeologist father (John Voight) it signals the beginning of a new era for the young adventuress.  Lord Croft's disappearance and presumed death had hurt her badly, and she had spent her life so far in a desperate quest to be what her father wanted her to be, a great field archeologist, Britain's answer to Indiana Jones.
Within the clock is yet another, this one the key to unlock the two pieces of the Pyramid of Light.  And the holder of the Pyramid can warp time.  Lara can return to her father and discover the cause of his disappearance.  Or the Illuminati can take over the world.  To prevent this Lara must outwit and outmuscle Powell (Iain Glen) the conspiracies agent.  And keep her old friend Alex West (Daniel Craig) from selling her out.
Based on the computer game series by Eidos Interactive, Jolie's Lara is smart, sexy, and tough as nails.  The actress spent three months in hard physical training for the part and performed many of her own stunts.  Of course, this isn't the kind of film where great acting is to be expected.  But all the characters, from Lara's eccentric assistant Bryce (Noah Taylor) right through to the star herself turn in solid, professional performances.  If the dialog isn't brilliant, at least it isn't stupid.  Of course, the real stars of the film aren't the humans but the technical teams.
I hardly thought that, when I first read Shea and Wilson's 'Illuminatus Trilogy' some thirty years ago, that I would find myself watching astonishing adventures of at heroine of a computer game in a race against time to save the world.  Completely new technologies would have to come into being before this was possible.  Back then, the closest thing to a real time game was an anemic version of Star Trek, and the only adventure game had you chasing (very slowly) through a few dozen 'twisty little passages.'  Taken from that viewpoint, the spectacular visuals of 'Tomb Raider' are a testimonial to the state of animation and special effects.
The film is meant to be fun, and a recreation in 'reality' of a computer game world, and does that perfectly.  Lara, as a woman, succeeds in a world where we once thought only men had a place.  Even so, almost every other actor in the film is male, the next longest female role being the bit part of a Cambodian girl (Ayla Amiral), who points out the entrance to one of the lost tombs.  Angelina is literally 'without competition.'  Even with a new Lara Croft film in the offing, this one will be tough to beat.
The requisite extras are provided on the DVD.  Features on visual effects, Angelina Jolie, the computer game, Angelina Jolie, the director's commentary, and (of course) Angelina Jolie.",1028332800,18,2832,4.729124236252546

A group of men are seeking for the two parts of this triangle to open a portal (or something) of time. This could only be done during the planetry alignment which occurs every 5,000 years.

1312185,5,B00003CXZ1,"A great DVD, a pleasure to experience and the extra features are a lot of fun, particularly the documentary on Ms. Jolie's training for the physical stunts.
Personally, I enjoy this movie for a variety of reasons. Angelina Jolie makes a perfect Lara Croft, for one thing. The movie looks fabulous, moves quickly, has a rather original design in terms of sets and locations, and the effects are spectacular without overwhelming the characters. Jolie makes Croft such a strong and convincing presence, and is so athletic and graceful in the physical stuff, that it is a joy to watch her -- and she's on screen almost every minute.
The film is based on a videogame, but this movie is more cohesive and better plotted than some of the James Bond entries I can think of, and stunningly executed.
It's a showcase for Ms. Jolie of course, and I can't see anyone else being as good at doing Lara. I never played the videogames, so I came at this movie fresh. I think Jolie creates a character as strong and well rounded as, say, Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones or Connery's Bond. Even though these movies have somewhat improbable premises and lots of effects, the actors remain firmly out front. Ms. Jolie achieves this with at least as much finesse and graceful detail as either of the other examples. And in all cases, the tone of the films is on solid footing, with sure direction, and never waivers.
Finally, Ms. Jolie executes her physical action very realistically and artfully, looking quite comfortable and competent all the way. The bungie ballet alone is worth the price of admission in TOMB RAIDER (extra safety wires erased via computer notwithstanding). It's quite a tour de force, particularly for an actor as versatile as Ms. Jolie, who, don't forget, received justifiable critical acclaim previously in GIRL INTERRUPTED.
It's a great popcorn movie of course, and a better movie all around than many big-budget fantasy films I could list that have less going on and more trouble taking themselves seriously.
I like the strong female character and the father-daughter underpinnings for the storyline as well. All in all, for a movie that started out as a videogame, this is surprising and I've easily watched it several times for the pure pleasure of its entertainment and lack of pretension -- and the convincing, mesmerizing perfection of Ms. Jolie.",1024012800,4,2355,4.89

As soon as it was released, I went to see it and, in spite of some of the negative reviews shown here, I really liked it. It is an ""Indiana Jones"" with a female lead. That's bad? Boys and girls this is a fantasy adventure. Don't over-analyze it. The acting is good, the effects are good and, overall, it is very entertaining. Leave it at that, buy the movie and enjoy! I introduced Lara Croft to my six and three year old grandsons and they enjoyed ""Tomb Raider"". So now there are three fans in my family. I see that there are several very negative reviews that have been posted subsequent to mine and I am not sure why.

Her hunt takes us around the globe as she races against an astronomical deadline and the obligatory bad guys who also seek the artifact.  Angelina Jolie makes Lady Croft a lot of fun.

A lot of the reviewers seem to think that because it's the action genre that we should expect to check our brains at the door, but I disagree. I expected the movie to at least tie together somewhat and not be completely insipid. Unfortunately, it had major major plot problems that just irritated me throughout and in fact made it painful to keep watching, because the plot hole destroyed the credibility of the main character. To explain, Lady Croft (man, that got annoying hearing her referred to so formally all throughout the flick) needs to keep the villain from getting two halves of a pyramid to put together, which will enable him to be essentially master of the universe. So what do these filmwriters do? They have Lady Croft find the first piece of the pyramid fairly early on in the film. That should have been the end of the story, because the villain needed both halves to wreak his destruction. At that point, with one half in her possession, she could destroy it and put an end to the whole thing. But no. She has to go after the second half. And there is never any justification for why she would need to do this. Pointless. Had the writers simply given the villain the first piece of the pyramid, this would have come together decently and actually created some drama. They didn't. It didn't work.

The movie starts off well with the introduction of Lara, but once she goes off on her adventure, it becomes a completely incoherent babblefest. It's pure stupidity at it's worst and I'd avoid it like the plague. However, because there is an interestingly campy quality about the acting that allows you to relish in the sheer complexity of its badness, I will give it another half-star.

Unfortunately, the scriptwriter and film director then proceeded to blow their chance. Sure, Tomb Raider was never going to be Great Art, but the saddest part of this movie was that it HAD all the elements, but somehow nothing quite came together. We had characters that SOUNDED like they would be interesting... but we don't learn enough about them to care. We had scenes that COULD have been tense and exciting... but somehow, they failed. It's really hard to understand how you can have a Gorgeous Babe(TM) in a scene with lots of Special Effects and Butt-Kicking (TM) and fail to get the adrenalin pumping, but somehow they succeeded in doing just that several times. It's almost tragic, in a way. Every scene, every concept, was just THIS >< far from working, but missing by that tiny bit was enough to kill it.

1312369,2,B00003CXZ1,"For everyone who has played the LARA CROFT role-playing games, this film does a great job of capturing the timbre of the game.  From her mansion where she trains to faraway exotic locales that she visits, there were several points in the movie that vividly re-created aspects of the game.
For those who have not played the game, you may ask:  ""Who IS Lara Croft?""  Well, she is a cross between an acrobat / weapons expert / martial arts guru & Indiana Jones - all rolled up into one.  Like Indy, she is always in search of lost treasure & artifacts.  When people and circumstances get in her way, the first 3 talents come into play.
As for casting, Angelina Jolie is PERFECT as Lara Croft.  She has everything the role calls for:  the athletic body, the exotic beauty, a sinister smirk, and the ability to move fluidly and gracefully like a ballet dancer.  Then, on top of all that, Jolie can actually act!  In fact, in my mind, she is one of the top actresses in Hollywood.
All that said, this movie just didn't ""work"" for me.  The fault was not in the direction or the action sequences (which were quite good).  Rather, I found the plot wanting.  It just seemed too off-the-wall and far fetched for my taste.  The objective was apparently to blend the adventure / fantasy genre with science fiction.  In my mind, it didn't succeed.
If you are a fan of the game, the film is worth seeing once - just for the experience.  It may also be worth seeing once if you're a fan of Indiana Jones type adventure movies.  Other than that, I would not recommend this movie.",1019865600,2,1562,4.428070175438597
1312370,5,B00003CXZ1,"The idea of taking a fantasy figure from a computer game and creating a whole film around it is bold--how much plot could there be? But the writers and director found good material, if a bit shopworn, to make a fun-filled adventure flick that delivers plenty of entertainment.

The plot is one you've seen before on Star Trek; a  dangerous weapon has been hidden to prevent man from destroying himself. It's being sought by the good guys (Lara) who want to destroy it, and the bad guys, the Illuminati, who want to use it. So, there isn't a lot of suspense, as you've seen this story before, but the adventure is fun and there's lots of eye candy.

What makes this film so stunning are the special effects and sets. The sets inside the tombs are full sized, lending realism and excitement to the scenes. The film was made in exotic Ankor Wat, the world's largest temple complex, and in Iceland on the blue glaciers. In addition, Jolie does her own stuntwork, which makes a huge difference in the editing and realism. She was surprisingly good, very believable as the fantasy fighting babe Lara Croft.

We enjoyed every moment. We were surprised how much we liked ""Tomb Raiders"" and especially Angelina Jolie. The extra bits at the end of the DVD on the making of the film are well worth watching",1019433600,3,1295,4.593073593073593

Jolie enters the action adventure genre with this film and I hope she doesn't intend to do more films in that genre.  If you like fight sequences, you might like this film.  If you like looking at Jolie, you also might like it.  That's not enough for me though and this film offered nothing else.

Angelina did a great job showing these characteristics of Lara and the movie was well done and written in relationship to the character Lara.

1)Mr Brittas/Rimmer (for those of you in the UK) turns in a marvellous performance as a younger butler. That sequence when he fastidiously dons his dressing gown and slippers with a shotgun is marvellous
2)The action. Let's face it, knocking out a bad guy with a front wheelie on a powerful motorbike whilst wearing silk pyjamas is what Lara Croft is all about.
It is patently obvious that the film makers have crammed as much of the games into the film as possible. There's the Ankor Wat, the Antartic, the Egyptian setting, mystery, time and space and plenty of Lara. To be honest the only thing that didn't amuse was the token 'father' sections with Ms Jolie's real counterpart and the 'hmm, how do we end this - let's have a silly ending' bit.

1312490,3,B00003CXZ1,"I'm not sure what possessed me to pick up Tomb Raider after reading all the horrible reviews already posted for it, but I did, and while Tomb Raider is everything that has already been said about it, I still found it a fun and worthwhile purchase.
Tomb Raider had the task of trying to please two distinct groups of fans: the video gamers who wanted an accurate adaptation of their beloved franchise (I never got around to finishing the first game), and those drooling for another Indiana Jones-style adventure flick. On the first count, Tomb Raider (TR) succeeds admirably. Lara Croft's world is perfectly translated to the screen, and Lara Croft herself is perfectly captured by Angelina Jolie. Like the games, the movie has Lara facing ancient evils and supernatural powers all while blasting away evil guardians and humans attemptng to thwart her. All the actors are believable, and the dialogue can be very witty at times: When the Illuminanti tell their field agent he must hurry or risk waiting another 5000 years, he answers that that's more time than he's willing to commit to this enterprise. It's not too hard to imagine someone in real life saying something of a similiar nature. The subplot of Lara wanting to see her father again adds depth that wasn't found in the game. Tomb Raider is a good video game adaptation, easily the best since the original Mortal Kombat movie.
However, as an adventure flick, Tomb Raider is sorely lacking. The movie feels like four distinct action set pieces coupled together with bits of dialgoue and traveling. At one point, Croft and her allies head to Siberia, but we're never told exactly how they knew to search there. This is one case where I wouldn't have minded if the movie had been longer, just so we could get a sense of the logistics behind the globetrotting. Another gripe is the action sequences: they're flashy, loud, rapidly cut, and totally ruin whatever excitment they were trying to build. Think back to the Indiana Jones Trilogy or even The Mummy Returns: these had nicely choreographed action sequences set to epic scores, where the viewer could savour the action without being over-bombarded. Then there is the special effects: A lot of them weren't needed. The Ray Harryhausen-ish stone monkeys were cool, but I could have done without the lightening in the final scene, and if they'd filmed the flashback of the triangle's origin using real locations, it would have been more believable. Lastly, there is the suspension of disbelief factor. The movie asks us to buy the whole 'controlling time with a mythical triangle' storyline. Okay, fine, for the movie's sake, I will. But plots like these need realistic scenes to ground them, and the movie doesn't have enough. Case in point: Lara drinks some tea given to her by a monk, which magicaly heals her wound. Walking stone monkeys I can accept, but herbal tea has its limits!
So while Tomb Raider succeeds as a video-game-based movie, it fails as an adventure movie. The disc has top-notch video and sound, but while the supplements are generally good, they're not enough to warrant a purchase by themselves. While Tomb Raider isn't the best movie I've ever seen, I enjoyed it enough that I can honestly say I didn't waste 100min of my time.",1015891200,5,3260,4.844086021505376

Both movies are B-Grade and only good for an MST3K party at midnight. Tomb Raider was torn apart by the critics, and with good reason. It features no coherent plot, mediocre acting, poorly planned action scenes, and dialogue so bad it makes an episode of Barney seem like Legacy of Kain... not that the games were much better. The game is well known for [poor] graphics, and horrid control, I guess the same could be said of the movie, and while Angelina doesn't pivot around to change direction, she may as well have. The story of this movie is just bad. When asked to summarize it's plot a friend of mine said ""Jiggle jiggle splash splash, jiggle jiggle"", and when we pressed further and asked for the moral of the story he simply replied ""Kaploowey"". I think that pretty much sums it up pretty well. While Jolie is a beauty, this film is not. It is over hyped garbage if I ever saw it. It is an excellent MST3K (Mystery Science Theater) movie though.",1014940800,5,1102,4.46039603960396
1312569,2,B00003CXZ1,"Angelina Jolie excels as Lady Lara Croft, a wealthy English archaeologist, and modern-times female version of Indiana Jones/James Bond in this video game adaptation. Not only does she look fantastic swinging through the air on bungee cords, knocking out menacing villains clad in black but she totally looks and acts the part of the Tomb Raider heroine Lara Croft, like she was born to play this role. She is stunningly attractive and looks every inch the action hero and what's more, her English accent is absolutely spot on. However, despite her valiant efforts this really is a soul-less film served up by Director Simon West (Con Air) that fails to live up to the excitement of the video games. The action scenes are merely a collection of set-pieces (often borrowed from other movies) that somehow fail to thrill and the plot (what plot?) is about as uninspiring as they come.
So what is the ""plot""? Tragically, Lara's father, played by real-life dad Jon Voight, died when she was eight, leaving her to a lonely life of raiding tombs... As fate would have it, Lara becomes embroiled in a plot to recover the pieces of an ancient artefact (a small pyramid) that was split into pieces to protect mankind and hidden in unspecified tombs around the world, guarded by elaborate defences. When re-assembled the possessor of the pyramid can control time and space when the planets become aligned and so it is left to Lara to race against time to stop the bad guys and save the planet.
There is little or no character development in this movie. None of the main or supporting characters, apart from Lara Croft, are given any depth or explanation for their actions or motivation. Lara, we discover, still mourns the death of her father (Jon Voight, hamming it up with a truly awful accent) but even this sub-plot is pretty pointless. Meanwhile her fellow tomb raiders (Iain Glen plays a particularly loathsome villain) betray each other for no reason other than to serve the plot, and when ultimately Lara risks everything to save her former love (Daniel Craig) it's a bit hard to swallow, particularly when for the previous eighty minutes their has been no evidence of any previous affection or chemistry between the two of them and he spends most of the entire film being villainous with no apparent redeeming qualities.
Ultimately the movie has its moments but it's a bit of a mess. No story, a poor script, no character development and lacklustre direction. It has no soul or integrity and insults it's audience's intelligence by assuming that all we want to see is a beautiful big-breasted woman shooting up bad guys in a series of action set-pieces in exotic locations, without any plot or cohesion to hold the movie together. Angelina Jolie certainly can't be blamed for this movie's failure. She excels as the confident and sexy tomb raider and makes a very believable action hero. I just hope that they make a sequel, a much better sequel, with a story, direction and plot to do Angelina Jolie, the character and the games justice.

1312570,2,B00003CXZ1,"Tomb Raider is the kind of movie you can watch while reading a book and not miss a thing.  Lara Croft originated in video games as a wild, sassy heroine with amazing acrobatic skill and two Desert Eagles to back her up, and her games supercharged that industry.  The idea for the movie was to cross Indiana Jones with James Bond, throw in a little bit of Batman's dark side and humor from The Mummy, and populate the lead role with a sexy, academy award-winning actress, Angelina Jolie.  You would think that formula couldn't lose, but the final serving is a mess.  I prefer the video games, even the later ones.
Director Simon West approached this film as if he were shooting a commercial or music video.  Every single shot is some high-concept, slow-mo dutch angle that lovingly follows our heroine on her adventure: we lovingly watch Lara open the door, then lovingly watch her close the door, that kind of thing.  It gets old fast.  The plot, too, is full of exotic locations and references to the films I mentioned above, and nothing is missing but some logic to make any sense of it.  Major plot points are lost in the glamor, and the endless sexy shots of our heroine and her hapless foes.  Enemies suddenly become friends for no sensible reason, and the major plot-twist is so uninspiring that if you blink you'll miss it.  The CGI enemies for Lara Croft look terrible and are about as entertaining as a barrel full of Jar-Jar Binks'.  The dialog is horrendous.  ""My ignorance amuses me"" is a real line that is actually heard 3 times, and it was just as dumb as it sounds.  I don't think the characters were even listening to each other, just say cool-sounding things to match the empty shine of the entire over-paid mess.  The onscreen meeting of offscreen fatherand dauther John Voight and Jolie is touching, dispite the fact that they don't have much to say to each other.
I admire the daring of the filmmakers to place Lara Croft on equal footing with any male enemy she faces - Croft simply karate chops 'em to the ground exactly as if she were a man, no dirty tricks, just pure power and skill.  Unfortunately, Angelina Jolie isn't believably as a nimble acrobatic kung-fu master.  Jolie DOES play Croft with a large does of sensual sexuality, but she throws a kick like a turle, and the wire work in this move is terrible, nothing as interesting as The Matrix.  Jolie doesn't look graceful, she looks clumbsy.
THE DVD - is a good one.  The making of documentary is from HBO, which means that it's about 3 stars out of 5.  There is an audio commentary and lots of little featurettes about various fxs and training for Jolie.  U2's excellent video is a must see.",1014508800,4,2675,4.544885177453027
1312571,2,B00003CXZ1,"When I first heard about this film, I was both excited and apprehensive. While I was certain that Angelina Jolie was a great choice for protraying famed videogame character Lara Croft, I was worried that the game's look and feel would not be translated correctly onscreen.
Sadly after watching the movie I was proved right on both accounts. Angelina Jolie nails the part of Lara Croft perfectly, even down to her faux British accent, and is perfectly fit and just enough of a badass to make her believable.
That unfortunately is where the fun of this movie ends. Sure, there are the requisite beautiful locations, such as fabled Angkor Wat and Iceland, but what happens between beautifully-shot scenery is a bit of a mish-mash.
The plot is largely ignored for the sake of some good action sequences, most notably the bungee attack. There's something about an all-powerful triangle (triangle?!) that the secret society Illuminati wants, and Lara has to find it. Or what? Oh yeah, the bad guys will get it.
The DVD is perhaps worth a rental; it 's chock-full of extras, including deleted scenes, a U2 video, Alternate main title sequence, and various featurettes on special effects, stuntwork, and Angelina's intense physical training for the film. There's also an easter egg and some ok DVD-ROM material.
Unfortunately while Tomb Raider looks great and has a pretty good soundtrack and some nice action sequences, the whole film feels rushed and just simply pasted together. Let's hope that if there is to be a sequel that more time will be spent on storytelling and less on blowing stuff up.",1014163200,5,1591,4.9182156133829
1312572,2,B00003CXZ1,"""Tomb Raider"" is a perfect example of how many movies from Summer 2001 were about style over substance; this film had great sets and good effects, but little or no meaningful plot or dialogue. Even the lovely Angelina Jolie was unable to save this tripe - she gave it a believable protagonist, because she does a very good Tough Ballsy Chick. However, her lines were awful, and they didn't seem to give her much else to work with, except slut, sultry, amused, sidelong glances.
The villians were probably the most laid-back doomsday cult I have ever witnessed, the romantic ""sub plot"" was laughable, and even Chris Barrie (of ""Red Dwarf"" fame) couldn't make me care about the butler. Oh, the humanity...
I went in with somewhat lofty hopes, I'll admit that - I really like Angelina, and the trailers were very pretty. I'd read a few reviews, however, that made me aware that it was probably not going to be all I hoped. I wanted an entertaining, visually appealing little romp, and I didn't get it. I was wholly unprepared for how [bad it would be]. Exiting the theatre, I was somewhat stunned, trying to figure out what exactly it was that made it [as bad as it was]. Turns out that there wasn't much that [wasn't bad], except the sets, the costumes, and the effects. Pity.",1014163200,2,1274,4.616740088105727

The first scene was pretty silly, as were many to follow... but as the movie progressed, her character was made more whole.  The movie makers did a pretty good job of giving her some depth of character that went beyond treasure hunting and killing bad guys.  Jolie did a superb job playing this character.  The story line had some holes in it, but who really cares.  I recommend it, either you'll love it or you'll hate it!",1013990400,,654,4.363636363636363

I could only manage to watch Tomb Raider in half-hour segments, because quite frankly, it was one of the worst movies I have seen to date. I'm a fan of the video game series because I think it is very well done and really improved the 3rd Person Shooter Genre. However, I can't believe Eidos (the game maker, may be pronounced : Idiots) sold their rights to a movie for this game.
Did I mention I fell in a plot hole?
The plot holes in this movie are so large I fell in. Really. The reason I got a headache was not from all the shooting, blowing up stuff, and all that, but because the story line is something a five year old could have written up. In fact, its so bad I can't even sumerize the story because I don't know what the hell happened.
Anyways.
The DVD itself isn't that bad. I give it 4 stars. Excellent video quality. Excellent sound quality. The Music Video by U2 (Elevation) is well done and sounds great, even without surround sound.
The extra features are wholesome to say the least. After viewing the movie you can understand why there are 8 segments on special effects and none on the script... The Making Of was good, I had seen it on HBO before, however it was well done. There was also a ""Easter Egg"" with Jolie + Voight (Her Father), it was touching.
The DVD-ROM had some other small features. The only one I looked at was the Demo for Tomb Raider: Chronicles. It was fun for about a half hour.
The only reason I gave the DVD Section 4 Stars was because no trailers were there. And I love trailers. Oh Well.

1312576,3,B00003CXZ1,"What can you say about 'Lara Croft - Tomb Raider?' It's a video game posing as a movie, and it shows. The plot is cheesy and far-fetched, while the many action sequences are so fast-fast-fast that they are nearly impossible to follow. The movie finds Lara Croft, the buxom tomb raider of video game fame, caught in the middle of a cosmic plot with nothing short of the future of the world hanging in the balance. Croft, played by the gorgeous Angelina Jolie, travels to Cambodia, Russia and other places, while disposing of lots of assorted bad guys... Still, Jolie sparkles as the movie's heroine in multiple tight-fitting outfits. (It's not her fault that the script is full of holes...) Aside from the movie, the extras on this DVD are pretty good. The disc includes deleted scenes, several behind-the-scenes featurettes, a U2 music video and other neat stuff. The quality of the movie itself, particularly on a high-end home theater, is top-notch.

1312653,1,B00003CXZ1,"I don't mind brainless action movies, but even the most accepting movie buff has to have some standards, and Tomb Raider can't even meet those.  Yes there are some cool scenes (like the fight against the stone monkeys and the bungie battle in the house, but they seem disjointed, contrived, and the result of a group of ""writers"" who tossed in ideas in an attempt to liven up a pretty dull film.  The story, ha ha, centers around two pieces of a triangle that when put together at the right time will give its weilder the power to go back in time.  Well, Laura has one of these pieces (its in her house).  I thought it would have been cooler for Laura to have found the first piece herself, but oh well, the army of writers who came up with this film thought otherwise.  At the point where Laura has one piece I thought to myself, why doesn't she just destroy it.  That would stop the bad guys.  But no!  She basically gives the bad guys the piece.
There are other rediculous logical gaps in the movie and I think it may be the result of horrible editting.  There seem to have been quite a lot of transitions that never made it from script to film or from film to final edit.  For instance, Laura's partners ask her how she expects to get from London to Cambodia in 15 hours to which she replies that she will have to call in a favor.  In the next scene, she is in Cambodia.  Ugh, how did she get there?  What favor did she call in?  Eh, whatever.  Lazy scriptwriters, bad editing.
Even the action scenes lack tension. In the first scene, she is fighting a robot.  But you learn that the robot is designed to help her train.  No tension there.  Then the movie tries to set up the story for about ten to fifteen mintues.  Yawn.  Then, Laura for some odd reason is relaxing in her home attached to bungie cords when her home is attacked by Illuminati thugs.  You can almost imagine the conference room when the writers came up with the idea to this scene:  ""We'll have her bouncing around on bungie cords, it will be cool, who cares if it makes no sense.""  This is the only real action scene with any tension because there are actually bad guys trying to kill her.
The stone monkey scene is ok at first, but then you realize that anyone, including my 85 year old grandmother, can beat these deadbeats by merely kicking them.
And am I the only person who felt that the ending of the movie was a rip of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade?
I guess we have ourselves to blame for Hollywood producing such poor action movies as Tomb Raider (this movie made over 100 million dollars in its theatrical run), but the least you can do is save yourselves: don't waste a second of your life watching this movie.",1012521600,,2698,4.309523809523809

1312655,4,B00003CXZ1,"2001 was an odd year for movies, bringing us a film that was animated so well it seemed real (FINAL FANTASY); and LARA CROFT, TOMB RAIDER, a film that was so perfectly cast that the lead seemed like the embodiment of a video game-character.  Whoever was responsible for casting Angelina Jolie is a genus, and Jolie herself deserves an enormous amount of credit for this uncanny albeit very strange portrayal.  And let's face it, Jolie is really the only reason to see this film.  The plot is nothing special, dialogue fairly commonplace at best (and at worst, laughable--the scene between Lara and her father's ghost made my entire family wince with the similarity to THE LION KING), the special-effects and set design acceptably workmanlike and the other actors similarly undistinguished.  But Jolie makes that all moot--and not just because she's gorgeous.  She brings Lara Croft to life without a single misstep; so much so that the aspects of Croft created specifically for the movie seem as though they've always been there through all the video games.  This is a movie worth a look for its entertainment value, expect nothing else; but a great popcorn movie it is--not quite Indiana Jones, but not far from it.
As far as the extras on the DVD go, they seem fairly standard.  I was amused by how pretentious many of those interviewed were, especially the director.  They seemed under the mistaken impression that what they were doing was truly important cinema; and spoke of such things as ""the spiritual heart of the film"".  Frankly, I'd give this all a miss--if you saw the film, you saw the best part of the disc.  The only extra of interest to me was the section on Jolie's training for the role; this is probably because I thought she was the only exceptional thing about the film.

Lara discovers that this clock will lead her to two triangle pieces that when put together at the exact moment of the alignment of the planets, the possessor will have the power to control time. But she Manfred Powell (Ian Glen), a member of a group called the Illuminati who want to use the power of the All-Seeing Eye, steals that clock from her. It's now up to her with the help of her friend Bryce (Noah Taylor) and later on another 'tomb raider' Alex West (Daniel Craig), to find the two pieces of the triangle before the Illuminati use the power for their own diabolical plot. But Lara herself be tested when she starts having thoughts of using 'time' to be able to be with her long dead father, Lord Richard Croft (John Voight). Will she able to resist the temptation?
I was totally impressed by Angelina Jolie with her doing most of her own stunts. I thought that action scenes using the bungee cord was pretty neat. Angelina sort of reminds me of Sophia Loren, you know the big lips parted a little. As for the plot, it was pretty cheesy but still it was entertainment.
But the best part of the whole movie is of course the cool action scenes! The four main action scenes are 1) the beginning where Lara is head-to-head against Bryce's robot, 2) where the bad guys are trying to steal the clock from Croft Manor (with Lara giving them a pretty hard time), 3) when Lara 'raids' the Tomb of the Dancing Light, and 4) the finale with Lara and bad guys going into the Tomb of Ten Thousand Shadows. The computer graphics were actually good.
As for the DVD itself, it's a pretty good special edition DVD. Plenty of special features, my favorites are the cast and crew interviews, a featurette on Angelina Jolie's physical training for the role, about the stunts, explains about the visual effects that were used in the movie, deleted scenes, and the U2 music video ""Elevation"". Of the four deleted scenes, three of them I was happy they had deleted. The one scene in which Powell killed Lara's friend was pretty grotesque. The one they shouldn't have deleted was the one where Lara takes the one part of the triangle from Alex's room. There are also some DVD-rom features.

All in all, it was a pretty fantastic movie to watch, enjoyable by people who want to spend two hours at home watching a film which you won't have to think too much but still have fun watching the action. Can't wait till ""Tomb Raider 2"" comes out!",1011312000,5,2615,4.5168776371308015

Hence we have a strange set of leading characters as diverse as Wolverine(X-Men), Lora Croft, Harry Potter and Froto Baggins.
Worlds that were only fantasies come alive on the big screen to the delight of their respective fans and target audiences, but also to the chagrin of cynics and critics.
Nobody expects a James Bond or Terminator movie to explain Life's questions, or even to really explain all of the details in the book.  I've read Ian Flemming.  Show me where he ever really explains 007's motivation for constantly saving the world and engaging in shallow, meaningless sexual relationships?
Simon West takes Lora Croft's world seriously and actually does come up with a reasonable explaination for what would motivate an extraordinarily rich girl to constantly expose herself to incredible risks.  Mountain Dew commercials aside, there is a limit to what adrenalin and extreme sports will do for you.
Angelina Jolie leaves her stunt doubles sitting on the sidelines as she brings Lora Croft alive and leaves the audience cheering for more.

The plot is messy, old and lacks originality.  The main heroes lack characters.  Even majority of computer game fans has reportedly been also disappointed.
It is not a rewarding task to write such a negative review.  However, watching Angelina Jolie in a summer shirt under unbuttoned coat in Siberia does not go any further than [breasts] watching anywhere in an office or on the street, but the latter is absolutely free and less time consuming.

Some of the sets were a liitle too much ""Indiana Jones"", but Angelina's understated character, kick-ass action scenes, and beautiful looks makes this the best action adventure movie in my mind.

Well, they were right about her changing clothes a lot. However, this film was no worse the any Indiana Jones film, the only difference being a female lead. It was a video game to start with, emeshed in fantasy and si-fi. Why anyone was surprised by the results eludes me.
First of all, AJ certainly became Lara Croft. You see it not only the extras but in the film. She is probably the only actress in Hollywood who could have carried the additude off alone, much less the physical techniques.

1312790,2,B00003CXZ1,"Tomb Raider is a film more popular than most action vehicle films simply because the heroine is the lead character, a difference that began changing much in Hollywood within the year 2000.  Think Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; Erin Brockovich; Tomb Raider, and so on.  This techno-thriller from Con Air's Simon West, is based upon the power packed Tomb Raider video game.  We've seen a few of these types of movies as well- such as Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within and Mortal Kombat.
Angelina Jolie plays Croft who is on a mission to find half of a missing triangle, in which if joined together, could alter the course of time and reality, where people can then easily play God.  Croft's one hope is to see her father again.  And if she can accomplish her mission before the allignment of the planets, she will then save the entire universe, and possibly see her late father once more.
This is a summer film, in which expectations are expected to drop simply because these movies are the ones to sit back and enjoy.  There should be no thinking process to it, and if you miss a half hour of it in the middle somewhere, you should easily be able to sit back down and put together what happened.  Lara Croft is an interesting character.  She is like a James Bond-Jet Li combination.  She's rugged, hard as rock, and as charming as anything.  Angelina Jolie fits her character the best of anyone I'd say.  Her performance and action stunts are dynamite.  But where she is excellent, she basically stands alone.  The plot is basically a Double Dragon theme.  Put the two pieces of rock together and save the universe.  Well, I was just sickened with the plot because I've seen it, seen it, and seen it many times after.  The villains are dreadful, and not even as good as the ones who ramble off their mouths telling the hero their secret plan to ""win"" (in their case).  These guys don't even say anything amusing.  They look like archelogist cowboys of some sort, who fire small pistols and a few artillary machine guns at Lara who is running across a wall attached to a cable.  For one thing- none of them hit her, and none of them have much of a point to shoot her at all.  What I'm saying is that if they want to kill her, why don't they try aiming for her?
However, I was immediately pulled into the film in the very beginning, which comes off as George Lucas: ""Star Wars"" style entertainment.  We are instantly pulled into the world of Croft battling some cybernetic prototype machine that her robotics expert built for her for practice.  At first we are unaware of this cyborg as to whether she's on a mission and it's a villainous computer controlled machine, or whether it's a cyborg with a mind of its own, something like in the film: Virus.  Jolie has some incredible stunts, and there are many tremendous action sequences, but the further we get into the film, the more the adventure dies out, and the special effects somewhat die down.  This film counts more on Jolie's sensuality rather than the action adventure the audience is expecting.  (Her shower scene in particular)  That isn't what draws the game's audience, so why should the movie rely on that formula?  However the film might portray what its audience is looking for, Jolie is an excellent Lara Croft.  Jon Voight, Jolie's real father, plays her father in this film as well.  His character is more-or-less not quite what I was picturing for his ideal persona.  I don't see much of a bond between Lara and him.  He wasn't bad, it was just sort of an odd placement.
I guess I will say that I give this film credibility for Angelina's performance, the action sequences and super-charged stunt working, but I don't understand the means of what the film has left over.  The villains are more like alcoholic leprachauns.  The plot copies a low budget Double Dragon or martial arts feature.  The ending plays out as obvious as it could possibly have been.  The sub-plot of Lara and her father was very much expected and unwanted.  The film also takes advantage of the audience and Angelina, in which the film basically targets boys who want to see some of Jolie's showered down flesh.  And there are so many film ingredients that make up this movie to fit.  So of course, this is what summer is all about when movies come around.  I wanted to sit back and enjoy this movie, I really did.  But as the movie kept on going, my interest just kept on slipping away.
QUOTE: ""Angelina Jolie's performance is great, and so is the action we are provided with.  But this film is all about getting that shower scene of Jolie in.  It seems as though this film is meant for teasing teenage boys, and not presenting action entertainment.  The special effects are passable, the plot is completely a low budget copy of previous alternate-dimension, time warping martial arts films, the villains are lower than typical, and the film stars going rotten after the first forty minutes.  So I ask you- would you rather play the game as Lara and make up the fun as you go along, or watch a movie that you cannot make interesting enough?""",1009843200,3,5082,4.586474501108648

1312792,5,B00003CXZ1,"Incredible movie. The acting was good, not Oscar material, but not average either, and better than most pure action movies. The sceneries were breathtaking, incredible. The directing fantastic. There was understated humor and fast fast action that left one almost breathless.

At first I had reservations about Angelina being Lara Croft, but after watching the DVD, all reservations went out the window. She was born to play this role. Angelina did her own stunts, thank you very much, which adds more to the film (no having to pull back shots with a double).

Yes, Angelina did an accent, it wasn't a heavy one, or a stereotypical one where you could say ""it's welsh for sure"" or ""it's Scottish for sure"".. but you know, I know in reality many people in this melting pot world where their accents are not very clear as to what accent it is they have. That's reality. She did a great job with it and made it seem more real to me (than some heavy-handed accent, or some too perfect accent, or some stereotypical accent). I could understand every word she spoke.

And maybe the one reviewer was too focused on Angelina's great body and so didn't noticed that there really was a plot. Not a deep, filled with twists and undercurrents and many subtexts plot, but a good plot, one that actually did have some subtexts and some thought-provoking aspects to it, if one was willing to look for it. The movie has, then, layers to it, like a good archaeological dig :-). Having said that, yes, the plot wasn't a 5* plot, but sheesh, do they all need to be? Diversity is great, and sometimes a decent average plot with some INCREDIBLE action and scenery (and not just Angelina scenery) is a very good thing. One does not live off of Shakespeare alone.

For those who say the camera was too much on Angelia (as if that could be possible <grin>) were either not watching the movie I was watching, or that they were so captivated by her that they didn't notice the incredible landscapes and panoramas that were presented to them. That's not the fault of the movie that some viewers are feeling guilty for gawking at Angelina so much that they couldn't tell you what the movie was about or that there were some fabulous direction going on with the photography. Is it wrong to have a beautifully photographed movie have a beautifully photographed star? Not in my book. This movie is a must see, must have, must buy.",1009065600,7,2399,4.611241217798595

Now in the movie version Angelina Jolie plays Lara Croft and the plot centers around her finding a clock that can stop/alter time. That's the basic plot. I thought Angelina was perfect for this role.

I really like her fearless energy and it comes across on film as it does in real life.

1312873,2,B00003CXZ1,"Ahh, another movie build over a computer game, this one have to be good. We all still fondly remember a masterpiece like Streetfighter, that made us all dance with joy. And now comes Tombraider. A movie obviously tailored to profit from the success of the game. Angelina Jolies body is perfect cast in the role as Lara Croft, and I am sure that alot of teenage boys will agree with me on that one.
The story is about Lara who is going after some artifact that have been split in two, many centuries ago so it could not be used again(one have to wonder why they did not destroy it instead of using energy on building vast underground dungeons to place it in). Whoever holds this artifact got the power to control time. Her opposition are a group of bad guys called the Illuminati, that uses all means to get to the pieces before Lara.
The plot could have been taken from an old Indiana Jones script, although it is full of holes. The movie seem to take itself too seriously, and not much acting is actualy involved.
Tomb Raider seems to me like a (take-off) from Indiana Jones, but where Indiana Jones often handle situations with wit and charm and elegance, Lara usualy just pull out her twin-mounted automatics and blast the obstacle to pieces, which make the movie seem alot less charming and a lot less fun. But what do you expect from a movie build over a computer game. One have to wonder about how smart this Lara girl can really be since we see her wandering around an icy Siberian plain, in only hotpants and a tight t-shirt, or earlier when marching through a muddy field in a white trench coat. But I guess even tomb-raiders have to put more emphasis on the fashion trends and less on practical details these days.

1312942,3,B00003CXZ1,"Lara Croft--Tomb Raider was one of the most anticipated films of the year. The very idea of taking a video-game and crafting it into a movie took us all by surprise, and once it was announced that Angelina Jolie was casted as the leading lady, that was it: we had to see it. The film, of course, has your stereotypical plot of an action hero (this time female) going on a quest to save civilization. In this case, Croft must stop villains from getting the pieces of a triangle which once led to the destruction of a society and could be used to control the earth and lead to its destruction, if put in the wrong hands. Naturally, lots of stunts, fight-scenes, and narrow escapes ensue before Lara Croft ultimately prevails. There is also a link to Lara's own past, in that she is taking on a mission which her father was unable to fulfill. As his successor, she is determined more than ever to rescue civilization.
I found this movie hard to interpret in the sense that it was very unemotional. I associated Jolie with such roles as 'Lisa' from 'Girl, Interrupted' and did not know what to make of her as a cool and collected action queen. Of course, she was fun to watch, but she did not seem to have a lot of lines, and the lines she did have, were often giving instructions or in the middle of fight-scenes. The lack of feeling was disconcerting for me. I understand that it was important to Jolie not to have a female action hero wimpering and being carried off by a man, but surely that is only one emotion that a woman will feel. A lack of humor was keenly felt in this movie. Her English side-kicks only produced luke-warm chuckles, but perhaps this would have been different if the villain had had a couple of dupes for side-kicks.
The positives to this movie are self-explanatory. We have a female action-hero who is not afraid to look feminine and have some sex appeal (without falling into the arms of every guy or any guy she lays eyes on.) The violence was not overly graphic and there was hardly any sexuality. I liked the idea of the movie's traveling to Angkor Wat to find the location of the sacred triangle, as this Cambodian location is so beautiful, yet so ignored by Hollywood. And of course, Angelina Jolie is beautiful and absolutely stunning to watch in action. You can rent this movie, enjoy it, but you won't find yourself captivated by it.
Over all, a good, even if a little enigmatic, performance by Jolie, some nice scenery, a typical plot, but lacking in emotion or hilarity.",1007683200,,2505,4.495614035087719

I've seen the Indiana Jones movies, didn't think they were great either, and found this one to be very similar in nature although perhaps more oddly paced. Angelina Jolie's Lara Croft might actually be better than Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones but really you're getting Indiana with a braid and an accent.

1312949,3,B00003CXZ1,"Reasons to watch this movie:
Amount of Action- Theres plenty of it.
Game to Movie Transision- The movie version of Lara Croft closely resembles what I think of the game's Lara Croft
Lara Croft(Angelina Jolie)- Cocky, nice moves, physically appealing.
The Butler-You'll have to watch to check this guy out.
Reasons not to watch this movie:
Laughable action- Sure, there's plenty of action, but whats the point of it when the weapons remind you of a game of laser tag.  The noise the machine guns make remind me of twittering birds in the morning.  Croft's weapons weren't so bad, but why do they have to be pistols?  I know that's her trademark, but she didn't have to use them the entire movie! Where's the uzies or M-16?  The troops, carrying machine guns, couldn't hit a thing!  Sure, Lara's supposed to be fast but she's not THAT fast.  There's no way she could move among them the way she did without getting hit unless these guys are idiots.  The hand to hand battles were short as well as lame.
The Ending- Fairly predictable, as well as a little corny.
Is it worth watching?
Sure. Go out one of these nights and rent it.  Though the action is pitiful, there is enough of it to make up for it.  Along with that, this movie shows in good detail what Lara Croft and her life would be like.  Just don't expect Matrix type action, and this will be an enjoyable movie.",1007164800,,1369,4.483870967741935

Lara Croft or Angelina Jolie really wants to fulfill her father's mission to find this artifact that erases or rewinds time. This movie was easy to understand and I knew when things were in the past or the future. The action scenes were perfect they were 'An on the seat thriller'. It kinda scared me at the beginning when I thought this machine she was training with was going to saw her head off, but it didn't thank goodness. I believe everyone should see this.

1313000,3,B00003CXZ1,"I suppose it was only inevitable that Tomb Raider should be translated to the big screen; and like most video game films, it was inevitable to fail.  Granted, it may just be one of the better examples, well beyond such horrendous offerings as Mario Brothers, but it still remains obvious that it is near impossible to take a game with little or negligible plot and successfully make a story of it on the big screen.  In which case, Tomb Raider makes a valiant attempt to meld a new story with the typical gameplay of the series--and it exceedingly passes as a companion to the game: the puzzles, the adventures, the appearance all model something that one would expect to see on the video game; the downside is, however, that the game is meshed by persistent gameplay, NOT by plot, or dialogue, or a story that has any reason to motivate the player further through the quest.
And so, without much surprise, Tomb Raider comes across as a exactly what it is, a Video Game you can watch, but cannot play.  What little story there is has too many holes to be believable, neglects far too many issues to become coherent, and lacks just enough importance to not make any difference in the film.  Moreover, where the screenplay fails in plot, it does NOT make up for in dialogue.  If films resembling James Bond or Indiana Jones don't blow the viewer away with plot or characters, they at least generally possess the snide humor of the traditionally cocky hero (or heroine, in this case) and nemesis.  Tomb Raider, however, fails to allay anything more than sarcasm, which dispersed evenly can oftentimes entertain, but which cannot carry a film.  So, the dialogue comes across as somewhat lame, backed up only by Jolie's impeccable attitude that is admittedly appropriate, but not worth the admission fee.  Furthermore, sometimes the film tries to be cool simply for cool's sake, by presenting situations and scenes that have no real relevance, working to make the film more disjointed than it already is.  Where the film tries to be emotional, it comes across cheesy; where it tries to be funny, it comes across as silly; but where it tries to be the video game, it succeeds admirably, perhaps the greatest feat the filmmakers accomplished in this translation.
But, alas, from beyond all of these criticisms remains a film that just might be silly enough, adventurous enough--with a main character that is hot enough--to sustain the viewer's attention.  It is, throughout, a proof that video games can rarely make a successful jump to the big screen without taking considerable liberties in the process, but some aspects of what made the game a success do come across in the more action oriented scenes.  Unfortunately, the back story takes some absurd leaps from moment to moment that come across in the end as so incredibly stupid that most will pass this film off as another failed attempt to profit from poor material.  The film MIGHT entertain you, but you'll spend too much of your time laughing at its stupidity to ever find anything truly satisfying in it.  For the time being, I'd stick with the video game!",1006819200,3,3111,4.781716417910448

1313003,5,B00003CXZ1,"If you have read the previous reviews, you can easily see that this movie has been debated greatly. Some thought it excellent, while others liked it and still yet, some who deemed it ""trash.""
Some seem to think that Angelina Jolie (Lara Croft) was too sultry and self-assured, or didn't seem to show much emotion. For those that have played the game, Lara Croft is depicted just that way. In the video games, Lara Croft doesn't get scared too easily, or often at that. Not that I think it's right for her to seem so tough, just that it stayed true to the video game.
Some think that Jolie's clothes were too skimpy. I understand where this is coming from and I would be just the one to object to a skimpy outfit, but Jolie's wardrobe was very well done. Her outfits were VERY much like that of the games.
Others stated that they thought Lara Croft was depicted as invincible. I find some truth to that, but Lara Croft is wounded in the movie. She does bleed, she's not Superwoman.
Still yet, some seemed to think that the plot was too weak. I, myself, found it rather well done. Some stated that the artifact she was searching for should have been more recognizable to the average person. Yes, this could have been done, but, again, returning to the video game, the artifacts that Lara is usually after are not well known, but they all hold some great power. (Much like in the movie)
Overall, I think that, for a game adaptation, this was VERY well done. It WASN'T another underdeveloped Street Fighter. We follow Lara Croft to find a special triangular articfact that holds the mystery of time travel. A good self conflict happens when Lara must decide whether to use the artifact to find out what happened to her father. I found the plot was deepened by the mysterious disappearance of her father and, returning to her ""lack of emotion,"" we see that Lara is not always sultry and tough. Her father seems to be her soft spot. Special effects were wonderful and VERY enjoyable.
I found that casting was very well done. Angelina Jolie made for a perfect Lara Croft. As for doing ALL her own stunt, I found myself in awe with some of the extremely challenging motorcycle stunts as well as the bungee roping. I found the casting of Lara Croft's father, perfect. Using Angelina Jolie's own father, John Voight, to play her character's father made for perfect scene chemistry. As for Lara' enemy, talk about good. I hate to say that I'm not sure of the actor's name because he did such a good job. He was so devious. I think that a very enjoyable scene is the Croft Mansion break in, but if you haven't seen the movie, I'll let you see it for yourself. This movie has a little of everything and would be enjoyable to men and women. There is loads of action, adventure to different countries (Cambodia, Britain, Russia), drama, comedy, and even a bit of subtle romance, with Lara Croft's ironic attitude and sarcasm as well as her ""sidekick's,"" if you will, goofiness.

1313006,3,B00003CXZ1,"This has got to be the best attempt at a good game-based movie that I've seen. There were a few minor plot discrepancies that didn't quite follow the storyline of the game, but they could be ignored-I actually didn't notice them myself until my avid Tomb Raider-playing pal pointed them out. I loved the action sequences-the ""ceiling ballet"" being my favorite, and I think that Angelina Jolie did a suberb job portraying our feisty heroine. The music was probably the best part of the movie, though. The fast-paced techno stuck with me more than the actual story did, and I bought the soundtrack almost immediately afterward.
What I didn't like was that the storyline of the movie wasn't that well developed. The charcters were typical, the events were ordinary, and the plot was so predictable that I found myself speaking the dialogue before the characters did! The story wasn't that detailed or involved. A third-grader could have followed it without trouble. I had been hoping for a more provoking, mature movie. Overall, it was...okay.

Angelina Jolie does make a good Lara Croft and the action is pretty good. The robot battle scene, the mansion fight, and the temple attack scene were pretty good visual effects and a lot of cool action. The music had a nice blend with the movie. I enjoyed the music video in the DVD by U2. The only things I didn't like about this movie was how the story went. In the story Lara is supossed to battle with the Illuminati but somewhere in the story Lara actually works with them when she's supposed to be fighting against them. That's something I can't quite really understand. Maybe a better story, better combat scenes, and a better villain could make this movie better. If they are going to make a sequel, they better make a good story. If they used some action similar to the Matrix, and draw in a little more romance, it could get more people and make the movie exciting.",1006560000,,1005,4.408602150537634

When there is a good game then bad movies follow. This is the basic plot that is followed by gaming movies. The only movie ever coming close to breaking this disatrous trend was Final Fantasy, which also was sort of a bomb. This movie is basically a Indy Jones rip off, but with a girl with a stuffed bra. The story is awful, at least the indy movies were somewhat believable this is unbelievably far-fetched with big statues coming alive and a clock that makes the planets align. All controlled by the illuminati a secret society. Whoo im getting goosebumps now! Phew yea right.

1313122,3,B00003CXZ1,"Well I don't think that I can really add much more than what has efectively been said by so many prior to me.  The only reason I am giving this film 3 out of 5 stars is for Angelina's performance as Lara Croft.  I understand that she worked extreemly hard to for this part. And I don't mean just physically, she has the English accent down cold as is the mannerism of a British  aristocrat.  I was originally livid when I heard the part went to her.  I wanted it to go to Catherine-Zeta Jones. Apart from the fact that Angelina was a yank. I was none too impressed with her wanton eccentricities which were reported on  in the press.  Lara was supposed to be a lady but as far as I was concerned Angelina was the exact opposite.  But as I read more about her and when I saw the film I thought that she gave it an adequate performance.
  That being said.  It really is hard to rate Jolie effectively because the movie was absolute trash. A non-sensical plot and poor story line. I spent years looking forward to the movie release of Tomb Raider and could scarcely believe that this dreck was all the film makers could come up with.  If I had not been given a warning about the poor quality of the film I may just have walked out on it.
  This movie is suitable for hard core Angelina Jolie fans, or perhaps Tomb Raider fans who may want to add this to your collection.  Otherwise I can not in all honesty recommend you plunking down your hard earned cash to buy this.",1006473600,,1466,4.223021582733813

Angelina Jolie is running around everywhere with little skimpy outfits and she has a constant ""I'm so sexy"" look on her face while she's running around with her guns and hanging from chandeliers.

It fell back to the contrived plot of an item of power being sought after by the bad guys. What it needed though if it was already borrowing from the Indiana Jones legacy was to make the plot center over an item or history that would've been more familiar to viewers. The made up history they did just wasn't attention getting.

Come on chaps, ""Lara Croft - Tomb Raider"" isn't a film of any intellectual merit, it is merely an exciting adventure movie with a whole host of good special effects and lots of quality funny moments.  I for one really enjoyed this film, I expected nothing from it other than a series of explosions and gun battles and that is what I got and I loved every single minute of it.  The plot wasn't too complicated, with Lara piecing together a mystery about an ancient clock and two pieces of a mystical triangle that has the ability to fragment time and space and of course there are the obligatory bad guys trying to get their hands on it.  There was a fine cast of characters from Iain Glenn playing the evil Mr. Powell (the main bad guy) to Chris Barrie of Red Dwarf fame coming across with great aplomb as the overtly English Butler Hillary who tries and fails to make his young employer into a regal young lady instead of a gun-toting maniac.  One of my favorite moments is when Hillary realizes that the security in the Croft Mansion has been breeched and there is a battle going on downstairs.  He calmly gets out of bed, dons a bullet proof vest taken from his wardrobe, locks and loads a massive double barreled shot gun without blinking an eye then carefully steps into his leather slippers before stepping out to join the melee.  I cracked up laughing, it was SO funny!  Angelina Jolie is well cast as Lara Croft, and she manages a pretty good English accent too as well as doing ALL her own stunts which impressed me big time.  The special effects were superb, watch out for when a husky-dog jumps through a break in the fabric of time, it's awesome.  All in all this is fun, fun film and that is the way it should be treated.

1313129,1,B00003CXZ1,"The Tombraider series has done well as a video game, mainly due to it's good gameplay and the main character, which the designers managed to give a personality (as well as breasts)that supersedes the other paper thin characters in the video game market.
However, that does not mean that it would transfer well into good cinema, where breasts just don't cut it as good character development or story telling.
The film project starts well enough by getting Angelina Jolie. While her accent in this movie is mixed at best, she looks the part and has the body to match.
However, the rest of the pieces that make the Tomb Raider pie fall completely short.
Simon West, a mediocre director at best, is not known for movies where character development is prevalent. I mean, in his Con Air, he has accomplished actors like John Cusack, Nicolas Cage (at that time), Ving Rhames and John Malkovich, but ends up making them paper characters, secondary to his image that movies should be a montage of 5 second cuts and involve one big explosion after another.
The writing team is little better and the story they provide is so preposterous, that they should be blacklisted for trying to subvert the already simple minded summer audiences into mindless zombies.
Lara Croft is a rich aristocrat type who is also a part proclaimed archaeologist. She get's this from her father who is also an archaeologist, but mysteriously disappeared while trying to find the location of the ""Clock of Ages"", a wonderous object that can bend time when the planets are aligned (once every 5K years).
The force behind finding the clock and it's various parts is a group called the Illuminati, and they discover that Lara unwittingly has the first piece, which is needed to find the other two pieces, which operate the clock.
There are many problems that even my huge ""suspension of disbelief"" mind cannot ignore.
1. It seems like Lara knows every language in the world. I mean, how many people can fluently speak Thai, Russian and can read obscure symbolic mumbo jumbo like it was all English?
2. She is bullet proof. She has the Arnold Swartzennegger, Commando syndrome, where bullets do not apply to her. 15 Commandos raid her home and she takes them all out without the need of a gun.
3. Scenes which involve getting a piece for the clock are arranged just like a video. Okay, I know this is based off a video game, but do you have to make it THAT obvious?
4. She is immune to cold. How many people can cross the Siberian wasteland in a T-shirt and a thin (often open) jacket?
5. She doesn't have to think. All the mysteries are given to her. And anything she doesn't know, the movie gods give her the answer without having to research any of it (this becomes apparent when a dog at the end of the movie walks through something that no one on earth has ever have seen before). Of course Lara knows that was a ""time storm"" and the effect that it would have, as if she sees such things on a regular basis.
Lara also doesn't seem to have much of a pulse. Her facial expression never seems to portray fear, nervousness or a sense that she might be in big trouble. Her voice rarely climbs above that sultry level she speaks, even if ten stone soldiers just tried to kill her.
Combine this with a one sided badguy who the director badly portrays as neither very evil or redeemably good and a love interest that she seems more annoyed with, Tomb Raider is my pick as one of the worst summer popcorn movies of 2001.
The DVD does a fair transfer and the sound effects are well done. If I had more interest in this movie, I would have checked out the special features, but I didn't. I turned this DVD off as the first credit opened and returned it for my money back",1006128000,4,3725,4.528189910979228

However I was pleasantly surprised by the acting, the action, set design, etc.
The plot was not predictable, was on the edge of your seat action.
Angelina Jolie who till this day did her best acting in a HBO film called ""Gia"", was very good as a action hero, and believable in the tough girl scenario.
You cared about the characters and the people that worked for her, and Lara cared about her employees as they were family.
It had a ""Batman"" feel to it in the home department, and was a fun action film.
Good action, no fowl language and perfect for 12 and up.  A fun movie to rent.",1005782400,2,688,4.204545454545454
1313206,2,B00003CXZ1,"Ah yes, Angelina Jolie...well, this film did not do much for me -in spite of her presence.  The effects and action were okay, but the characters were paper-thin, the plot was murky (if you could call it a plot at all), and the overall of the film was uninspiring.  One gets the feeling that any one of several so-called action stars could have substituted for Ms. Jolie (and I don't think much of any of them, either).  Angelina does have some pretty good acting chops (""Girl Interrupted"", for example), but hardly showcases them here...",1005782400,,537,4.691489361702128

In past experiences, other movies I saw that were based on video games turned out to be terrible, however this one was different from all the others. I believe this film very well could have turned out to be like the others of its kind, but Angelina Jolie was the perfect action heroine. It was nice to see a girl action hero for once. I probably would not have even watched it if she wasn't in it.  I also liked the fact that her dad in the movie was her real life dad. You could sense a father-daughter chemistry in their ""flashback"" scenes together.  There was also a strange chenistry between her and the bad guy in this movie. Sometimes you couldn't tell if he was really ""bad."" A review in Rolling Stone said that the bad guy looked like he was ""liposuctioned from Pierce Brosnan's a**"", which is true, but not necessarily a bad thing. He definitely played a good villian.  The acting is excellent, the script is good, and there are some killer action sequences. This film is perfect for any fan of action movies, Angelina Jolie, or the video game, and great for anyone else who likes a good movie.",1005782400,,1154,4.433962264150943

As far as the movie itself, ummm... what's going on again? Triangle pieces, time-control, boulder monsters, pet robots, etc... I felt like I was watching Wild Wild West again (oh, the horror!!!)
I liked Jolie's barbie-exaggerated proportions, but not necessarily the Lara Croft character. What could be mistaken for strong will and independence in ""Lady"" Lara Croft, I found more to be attitude smug, physically inhuman, and emotionally unreachable; except for the one large crack in her padded armor - that ""mysterious"" death of her father (the Father will be with you... always) Funny thing about this movie is you rarely see the lighting directly on Jolie's face - instead focus is shifted to other areas as evidenced by the cover of the box).

I think Jolie was the perfect choice for Lara Croft, she was smart, witty and oh very sexy.

1313211,1,B00003CXZ1,"The truth about Tomb Raider is complicated.  Even though I gave the movie only one star, the DVD does have its merits. If you're still reading this review, you're probably the type of open-minded (or obsessive/compulsive) movie watcher that actually wants to read about the DVDs high points, so here they are:
*  the movie has great special effects, and perfect casting of the lead character (if anyone tells you that Angelina Jolie is not the spitting image of Lara Croft in this movie, slap them...hard).
*  In a DVD, the action scenes alone may be worth the purchase for some. And one should remember that the DVD medium provides extra features, and the opportunity to skip undesireable scenes.
Which brings me to the reason that I gave the product only one star. The movie, in and of itself, is terrible.  Let me restate that: the movie is worse than any live-action movie of a video game I've seen (including Street Fighter), with the possbile exception of the Mario fiasco. Why?
**  The plot is stupid (if not for Lara's terrible judgement, there wouldn't be any drama), a number of scenes are overdeveloped, and there are really only 2 high-octane action scenes.
**  Where are the thought provoking riddles?  Where are the innovative ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""-type tomb break-in scenes? This movie is based on a STRATEGY game...hello!!
**  And for all of those people wanting to ""see more"" of Angelina Jolie, you're out of luck--the video game is more risque.
So, if you've got a couple of bucks burning a hole in your pocket, and you've got 20-25 minutes to kill to watch the few interesting parts of this flick, go right ahead.  Otherwise, check out the Matrix for the 15th time, or experiment with Lost In Space, or the Prince of Egypt.",1005696000,,1746,4.698360655737705

Well, to my pleasant surprise Director Simon West not only delivered on both accounts but exceeded to make Angelina Jolie ""Laura Croft""!!!!!
Angelina (an Oscar winner) is a very credible actress and went through 3 months of prepatory training to become this video hero. Not only did she become Lady Croft but did all her on Stunts!!!! So believe me this a very credible Lara and the story is one of video game proportion.
Remember this a Lara Croft aka ""Tomb Raider"" adventure which is full of adventure, impossible odds and heroic accomplishments.
In Summary: We are introduced to Lady Croft at her English Mansion (very true to the games version). Her appearance, abilities, her attitudes and skills are very true to the game character too. And of course we have an impossible task to perform in the shortest period of time 1 week. Task - locate within the confinds of earth the 2 peices of an ancient triangular relic (Tomb Raiding is involved!!), solve the riddle & location to perform the pagan ritual to reach immortality. Time - 1 week to scour the world, locate & find the relics, for this ritual can only be performed when all 9 planets are aligned. This happens only once every 5000 years!!!!!! No problem for Lara Croft? Villians are abundant and the action continuous.
You can see this is a nail biter scenario & you'll be sitting on the edge of your seat through this ""Tomb Raider"" adventure!!!
Lots of extras, to iclude Miss Jolies intense training and movie preparation.
The Widescreen digital picture & sound are awesome!!!!

1313284,5,B00003CXZ1,"Angeline Jolie, whose explosive personality made her more of an indulgence than Gia in the movie Gia and won her an Oscar in Girl, Interrupted, was just Lara Croft. Despite the deviations from Lara's video game wardrobe (needed for reality since Jolie isn't, Ummm, as busty as our video game Phenom), Tomb Raider is by far the best adaptation of a Video Game Character while being real at the same time. Critics didn't like Lara not being in much danger in the film, but, as a game player, if you play it right, she never is in any real danger except with you at the controls. Jolie certainly makes the film and her adversary makes quite the villan. Her Father, Jon Voight, was a nice touch adding some feeling to the film bringing poignancy to the ending(as was Alex West's romantic involvement).
Jolie, as always, is not the lady but the Vixen ready to explode. Scene after scene was intensely crafter to make her look like the Lara Croft and she did most of the stunts. I actually saw the film six times at the theater. Never bored once. Jolie had to tan constantly to look like her, makeup had to keep her Lara hair perfect for each shot, and the high-wire bungee act was simply Lara Croft. Enjoy the ride and look for Lara Croft 2 in 2003. Female Indy Jones time? Get Steven Spielberg to direct next time and Harrison Ford can forget about coming back (the big rumor).

While this film may not show you her true talents, she does do the best of what she had been given. She is definitley her hottest in this film. She might be a tad quirky in real life, but, that's endearing. This movie is pretty mediocre. I'm not a Lara Croft fan. In fact, I don't really know anything about it. I really wasn't expecting much. I didn't get much either. The silly plot about time or something, I really can't remember, was pretty transparent. I mean, I just said I can't even remember it!. The action scenes are pretty adequate. The raid on the mansion is especially fun and thrilling. It's too bad the rest of the film couldn't hold on to that thrillness. Is thrillness even a word?. Oh well. Jon Voight is on hand in a cameo as Lara's father. Voight, a brilliant actor, is pretty much not there in his performance of a barely there character. If mindless, senseless action films is your thing, you'll probaby like this. Others will probably just fall asleep. Five stars for Jolie tho. Not worth raiding.",1005264000,,1192,4.472477064220183

The best part is the bungee ballet, in my opinion. And I'm definitly glad that they cast Chris Barrie (from Red Dwarf, check it out sometime... one of my fave shows) as her butler and not some flatulant old man. ^_^ Bryce was cool too, and that Adam West guy was definitly hunky.

If the movie's not going the way I want it to, I can't go back and explore new places or maybe type in a secret code to go to the end.  No, I gotta watch the whole thing.
Well, I'd give ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" two and a 1/2 stars (out of four).  I read that the movie was supposed to give you this goofy grin the whole time, but I only had that goofy grin about 3/4ths of the time.  So when you give a movie that you liked 3/4ths of the time 2 and a 1/2 stars, that means you take the extra 1/4ths and multiply it by the remaining 1 and a 1/2 stars (assuming they go up to 4), which gives you 1/8ths of sheer boredom.  But of course, you can't forget the 9/12ths of sheer wonder that the movie holds, which is actually, when you reduce it, only 3/4ths after all.  So when you compare the 3/4ths to the 1/8ths, the good wins out.  But let's not forget the badness......
First of all, the plot didn't make ANY sense at all.  Well, it makes sense if you don't care about the laws of physics and sense (but if you leave out sense, how can it make sense?).  The plot was something about how everyone wants to possess this globe thingy that will make them God.  Seems an ancient civilization got their hands on it and ""over-used"" it, so they destroyed themselves.  Okay, here's a point: If the thingy lets you have the power of God, how CAN you destroy yourself?  You're God!  Just say ""I will never die"" and you're safe.  But no, even if you're God you can die.  Like that makes sense.  And isn't there something scary about Lara Croft becoming God?
Another thing I didn't understand was the creepy little phantom girl.  She popped out of nowhere with no explainable reason and just ""guided"" Lara around.  And Lara just follows her around like it's no big deal!  That's another thing: Why does nobody stop to think, ""You know, this being God thing and all these statues coming to life and this phantom girl..... it just doesn't make any sense!""  Of course, Lara can't do that, because she always has to look sexy and cool and everything.  If she started panicking and thinking, ""Oh man!  That's unbelievable!"" it wouldn't look good.

Angelina played Croft pretty well and while I've never liked the video games I enjoyed the background history that the movie provided as well as the great kick-... action scenes that had my blood pumping.

The story went well with the game, even though the relationship between her and her father was a little cheesy, and her fighting a whole society instead of one person and their henchmen was a little weird. But hey, whatever.
Now everyone that's complaining that she travels too much in the movie can explain Tomb Raider II to me right?
Even if Angelina had a padded bra, (which I doubt, I mean, haven't you guys seen her other movies??) she still knows how to look and act the part, so leave her alone.
Anyway, referring back to her travels in this awseome movie, she travels to: India, Cambodia, and Siberia, and all three of those locations also coencide with her exotic travel locations in the games too.
Oh yeah, and about that giant stone Brahman everybody's complaining about? Well, in Tomb Raider III: the adventures of Lara Croft, she had to battle many six-sword weilding stone Shivas, so, I don't want to hear about the movie not being like videogame. Ok?
Angelina also does the amazing hops, flips, and jumps that I thought only a certain videogame heroine could do.

The action scenes that were in it were good, but I was expecting more. The movie revolved more around story, like Final Fantasy did. The special effects were decent, but for this day and age they should've been a lot better. Like for example the big statue that came to life.

I'd give the movie 4 stars, but since Angelina is the perfect Lara, I have to give it 5 stars.

1313446,2,B00003CXZ1,"Well, I've been a tomb raider fan since the first game came out and was really looking forward to the movie.  However, this version of the infamous Lara Croft wasn't nearly as good as the game was.  There were plenty of elements in the movie that needed to be included -- the problem was they weren't balanced out evenly.
The best parts of the movie were also the most overdone:  the action.  Whereas I can appreciate a girl kicking butt, there just was too much of it; it seemed as if the script was sacrificed in order to add more combat scenes.  Action sequences can help make a good movie, but too many don't make it better.  They also tried to be original, like with Lara beating up the bad guys while on a bungie-cord. I can just see the writers saying to themselves: ""What kind of new action sequence can we write that's impressive yet not ripping off the Matrix?  Yeah! A bungie-cord!""  Whatever.
The script was poorly written.  Not that it had bad dialogue, but they tried to fit way too much into an hour and a half.  The movie probably ran longer, but unfortunately was edited so heavily that it seems to skip a bit.  Also, it tries too hard to be an action film while keeping a sentimental tear-jerking attitude, like Lara's memories of her dead father.  We see Jolie's emotions switching around so much due to the fact that she only has seconds to go from sad to happy to sexy and sly, we almost wonder if it was just bad editing or did Jolie develop multiple personalities.
Then we come to the actress Angelina Jolie.  What can I say except it was very obvious that Jolie was having a good time pretending that she was Lara.  Along with the winks, hip shifts, sly glances as well as the nose up in the air when she walks I wonder if Jolie played Tomb Raider and envisioned things that Lara never did in the game... but should have.  Jolie seems to concentrate on Lara being a little bit too cool.  I shouldn't be so critical with her, though, she did get directed in this film and was probably encouraged to portray Lara this way; Jolie's portrayal of Lara takes away from the fact that Lara is a competent, well-trained, brilliant adventurer and kind of concentrates on her assets that lean more towards toning.  (Jolie even admitted that they augmented her breast size for the film.)  How disappointing.
I would have loved a female version of the infamous Indiana Jones and after watching ""Tomb Raider"" find myself still craving it.  Unfortunately, Jolie's Lara Croft is simply too shallow and not enough substance.  Of course, die hard fans of Tomb Raider who love Lara for her digital body as well as fans of Jolie's body really have nothing to worry about -- that is if eye candy is what you're looking for.

Well, Tomb Raider was all that and more--a hilarious, off-the-wall comedy, packed with laughs, laughs, and more laughs--even though they weren't intentional.
To truly enjoy this movie, you must first suspend ANY hopes for a real storyline. Hell, through all the laughing all I remember is her going to a bunch of random ""exotic"" locales, making a pathetic attempt at action.
Oh yes, the so-called action. ""Ballets"" of gun fighting, the logic of trying to shoot a boulder-monster several times larger than the actress--all are scenes that will truly leave you rolling in your seat.
Also, you must truly enjoy Jolie's wooden acting and not-so-wooden-and-very-fake chest, as they provide for random bouts bouts of laughter. As I imagine you may be watching the DVD release, don't feel guilty at all about laughing--I didn't, and I was in a damned theater!
Other hilarious bits that you must be able to enjoy are the ENTIRE lapse of continuity and logic--where in Lord's name did those dogs come from? And of course, how is it Jolie's chest does not look cold at all even as they are in Antarctica.

They got the female part right, certainly, with the luscious Angelina Jolie and they included a number of great action scenes, including a marvelous set-piece where Jolie just happens to be hanging from a bungie cord in the center of her house. But the story could hardly have been lamer. It makes no sense. I won't go into all of the details. If you care about such things, you can read some of the other reviews here, and if you want to see the movie even if it has a lame story, it won't matter what I say anyways.
But two observations I had: 1) The trailer for this movie got cut from the actual film! (That whole scene where she and one of the bad guys are taunting each other). What the heck is that?
2) For such a supposedly smart lady, she has absolutely horrible taste in men.

1313519,2,B00003CXZ1,"Lackluster adaptation of the hugely popular video game that has Angelina Jolie filling in more than ably for the title character. Swaggering around in great clothing and accesorized by the coolest gadgets imaginable, Jolie's Lara Croft is an action woman extraordinaire, seizing her audience by storm with her powerful physical and emotional presence, and presenting the most popular female action hero since Sigourney Weaver first started battling those evil aliens. The story, however, isn't up to her standards, wasting the gorgeous around the world locales and strong supporting cast in favour of overly-edited action scenes and deceptive but ultimately useless character development (all the scenes about Croft dealing with her father's untimely death never really tell us anything about her or her relationship with him). The plot, such as it is, concerns our heroine racing against time to save the world from being taken over by a Venice-based power cult called the Illuminati who require an ancient talisman to be used in a ritual during a powerful solar eclipse. Between these guys and Hannibal Lecter running a museum in Venice, the place has certainly fallen off my personal list of future vacation spots. Though it features many good visual effects and exciting battles in ancient temples and all the trappings you hope for in a film of this sort, there's always the feeling that something's missing. Once you reach the finale and find out it's topped off by the most anti-climactic ending of the year, you have finished watching an okay but unremarkable movie starring a very impressive but underused leading lady. And yes, her breasts are everywhere all the time. Looking forward to a better sequel.",1001894400,6,1714,5.191335740072202

The movie was a special effects extravaganza leaving very little time for actual plot or character development. There were a few errors in continuity and the CG (computer graphics) were somewhat amateur in regards to the stone creatures that Lara Croft fights. Where is the centuries of dust on these things? How about some moss or lichens growing along the exposed horizontal planes? How about the multitude of insects and spiders and snakes the normally inhabit the nooks and crannies of areas left undisturbed by humans for long periods of time? Is this the best effort that Hollywood can give us in joining ""The Rock's"" head and torso to an arachnoid trunk and legs? I found the suspension of belief that we feel when we go to the movies severely encombered by fits of laughter after viewing the amateur way the CG was NOT well blended in this movie. Angelina Jolie should be commended on her execution of the stunts she did without a stunt double. You can tell that she worked very hard on getting the stunts just right without cutaways.

1313522,3,B00003CXZ1,"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider starts very well. It is quite good in the middle. At the end, it isn't so good. I guess the film just keeps going down and down as time proceeds. Anyway, I wonder if there will ever be any good video game-to-movie films? Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within wasn't too good, and this is the second movie in one year that is a full-on disappointment. I found this movie surprisingly dull in parts and the plot  big time. On the plus side, I did find all the action sequences extremely entertaining. Lara Croft is an interesting, rich and cool character and the director has a lot of fun with her action scenes. Seeing this great character leap around supported by a bungee cord in her silk pyjamas late at night is undeniably special. Angelina was fantastic and saved the movie. She really got into the spirit of Lara Croft. Add to that the film had some pretty neat ideas and was quite smart in places. But, the film wasn't as exciting as I thought it was, the script was mucked up, the director - although he does great with his action scenes - doesn't really know where he is taking the film, the whole ""father"" story didn't hit the right notes and the ending is really bad, confusing and leaves the film on an unenergetic and dissatisfying note. So, I guess Lara Croft: Tomb Raider gets a place somewhere in the middle. I thought lots of stuff about this movie, particularly Angelina, was sweet and impressed me. Then again, a lot of things disappointed me and the film will probably just be another loud, silly yet nice to look at summer film experience that people will enjoy but probably won't find to be a masterpiece of a movie.",1001289600,5,1657,4.486754966887418

1313587,4,B00003CXZ1,"I really, really enjoyed this movie, but I think it's one of those films that has to be approached with the right attitude - that is, no great expectations and a forgiving nature.
The usual criticisms are levelled at this movie: poor character development, bewildering plot, shoddy editing and a lack of realism, and I have to say that on most counts I agree with the critics. Yes, the characters appear superficial. The plot is spectacularly inane, the editing leaves much to be desired, and there's not the slightest evidence of reality.
But if you think about the generic conventions of these kind of archaeologist/superhero movies, the objections shouldn't seem so bad. I mean, firstly the realism thing. The only kind of movies that ought to be grounded in realism are the ones which are limited to the world as we know it. ""Tomb Raider"" is firmly placed in another kind of world, a world without our limitations, a world where Lara can go anywhere, do anything - like fight re-animated stone monkey soldiers in a bid to win control over time. This last aspect, that of wresting power over time, is the central thesis of the movie. Is this a realistic foundation? No. So what does it matter if unrealistic things happen in this film? They ought to, and do.
Secondly, the criticism made about the movie's plot. I think this is one of the biggest disappointments about ""Tomb Raider"", that the storyline is handled so badly. If you read more about the story (in the book-from-the-movie), you might have some chance of understanding what on earth is going on, but good luck otherwise. I think perhaps the film makers tried to be a little too ambitious: there are so many undercurrents in the plot (eg: Eastern mysticism, Lara's troubled relationship with her past, her ambivalence to ex-flame Alex West, humanity's greed for ultimate power, etc) that to put them all in the one movie comes at the expense of clarity. Simple films are often the best films: the good narratives are those which are strong and cohesive, and pursue one direction - not many! But considering the rumoured plan is to make a trilogy of Lara films, perhaps a flawed first film is inevitable; inexplicable points have to be raised in the first film in order to set the scene for the following sequels. Good editing is the only way to help a convoluted, crowded plot. Let's hope that message gets to the makers of the sequel/s.
As for character development, well - same deal as above. Too much in too little a space of time. Motivations aren't explained, for one thing. When Lara is betrayed by an old family friend, the audience is given no help as to what on earth prompts this betrayal. That's just one example, there are plenty of other confusing things. Like Pimms, the sidekick to the villain, what is going on with him? If you read the book you discover he undergoes a change of heart through the narrative, but in the movie you'd never guess that. (The novels based on the movie aren't that great, either, so don't read this as a recommendation to rush out and buy them - although it's worth it if you want to understand this movie more!) Again, the only way to fix these problems is to deal with the narrative/ editing. The acting was fine, but the editing needs a bit of help. Fix the storytelling aspect of a movie and you're halfway to audience gratitude.
Yet there are so many positives in this movie! The action is fabulous - awesome awesome fighting sequences, Jolie's portrayal of Lara is superb, there's the intriguing dynamics of Lara's relationship with Alex, and the locations - Cambodia and Iceland - are incredibly beautiful. We've got a strong female in the central role, which is a refreshing change, and there's a brilliant score and soundtrack. And did I mention how fun it is?! Non stop action, got to love that. Granted, those shower scenes of Lara and Alex (separately, of course!) are totally gratuitous to the plot, but I suppose in a movie which is inevitably marketed to the boys that's a hard temptation for film makers to refuse.  (They could at least try to refuse, though!)
I know a lot of people did not like this movie at all, and that dislike can certainly be justified. But if you don't expect movies to be cinematic masterpieces every time, and if you are prepared to be a little lenient to a well-intentioned movie, then this is a great, great film. Don't take it too seriously and have fun. Best of all, the in-the-works sequel has every chance of learning from this film's mistakes and getting it right. Can't wait!",999993600,4,4534,4.6675

I know Laura is an asskicking relic hunter and I really enjoyed watch Jolie bring her to life, but I would like a hint of believability.  The scene where her arm is healed by a Buddhist is almost useless.  If her entire body had been damaged or she was near death, this scene would have been more striking.

The villians were a non-issue and posed little threat to her. They can't shoot her with machine guns in wide open space? There was an imbalance between good and evil. Laura Croft would win in the end very easily just like she had all through the movie. The action sequences were hokey at times, I'm surprise they didn't just leave the green screen behind her green, because its not like we couldn't tell that's what was back there. Angelina Jolie does her best with want she has been given, and does a fair job with the five speaking lines she has in the movie. Other than that she does what she was paid to do, look sexy and wear tight fitting clothes. Over all the film had character that were strangers. You didn't know anything about them, and really you didn't care who won in the end. The hunk of plastic that is going to save or possibly destroy the world, also had no meaning.

However, her career is exploding with new movies and earning herself an Academy Award for her portrayl of a mental patient, Lisa, in ""Girl Interrupted"" co-starring Winona Ryder, Whoopi Goldberg and Vanessa Redgrave. She was recently in the thriller ""Original Sin"" starring Antonio Banderas and Thomas Jane. Jolie is an incredible actress and no-one could have portrayed Lara Croft better than Jolie.
  Jolie (""Hackers"", ""Pushing Tin"", ""Gone in 60 Seconds"") was well-equipped for this role having gone through massive training in different fields of fighting. Lara Croft:Tomb Raider starts out with Croft finding clues to an ancient mystery that can lead to destruction of entire lands. She has the Clock of Ages in her possession, but not for long. Croft gathers clues to find out what to do and where to look. Guided by the wisdom of her late father (Jon Voight, ""Pearl Harbor"", ""Anaconda"", ""Enemy Of  The State""), she discovers that the Clock of Ages has to be placed in different temples to obtain the parts of a Pyramid. Once fully together, the possessor of this pyramid will have ultimate power. Croft is ahead of another  tomb raider guiding someone to these ancient temples.

We move on to thieves trying to steal a time machine that her father found. The sequencing of moves, the tricky gadgets, the wicked dancing Buddha in the tomb in Cambodia, the trek to the Artic, the gigantic time machine that slices and dices.....

I think the cast and crew tried hard to make this more than some silly movie like Street Fighter and Mario Bros. but yet, as expected, the critics weren't having it - they just love to see films like TR fail and they make sure they do their best to negatively review them. Well forget the critics and go and see Tomb Raider. Its short but enjoyable, for both fans of the game and those who haven't played it. I discovered more about the character of Lara Croft, played so naturally by Angelina Jolie, and the locations were inspiring and exciting - the first movie in a long while to be granted permission to film in the sacred Angkor Wat temples of Cambodia. Personally, the plot intrigued me also...the planets lining up in a rare configuration that, when the right ancient artifacts are put in place, will allow time to be manipulated. There has always been belief that the ancients had powers associated with the Planets and the TR plot plays with this, although it could've been more clearer rather than left to the imagination.

In the film version of the video game, Angelina Jolie plays Lara Croft.  Didn't director Simon West all ready make a mistake there?  Con Air and General's Daughter were great!  Now he comes out with this!  Just because Jolie looks like a Lara Croft, doesn't mean she is a good actress to play her.  Her acting sinks below surface and the adventure is just too wild.  There is nothing that sets this film apart from unoriginal- it just blends these formulas together: RAMBO meets JAMES BOND meets THE MATRIX meets ANGELINA JOLIE means cheap summer stupitidy desguised as action adventure.

1313746,4,B00003CXZ1,"The video game adventurer Lady Laura Croft comes to life in this action packed movie in which she races against time, villains, and obstacles to recover powerful ancient artifacts.

The video game series this movie is based on is enjoyed by most for its' puzzle solving and strategy tactics. The video game does not provide much for a story line and lacks enough substance in itself to make a well rounded plot. The characters in the video game do not have much for personalities, but prove their attitude and purpose.

The movie is full of bold attitude, intense action, and all the explorative adventure one could possibly hope for. I feel that this movie is quite easy to digest over all and can reach a wide age-ranged audience. And though the suspense will not make you grip the edge of your seat, the fantastic ride with some great stunts and stellar special effects just might. Locations as exotic as Lady Laura Croft and elaborate sets populate this movie from beginning to end.

Unfortunately, the movie provides little opportunity to allow you to get attached to any of the characters in the movie. There are a number of events in the movie that may turn off those who value 'believability' within or throughout the story line. But on the whole, this movie was very well done as an exciting and adventurous way of attempting to put the video game onto the theatre screen.

Many reviews I have read for it on Amazon and other sites siad it was not a good as Indianna Jones or previous action movies.  I'll be totally honest: it really isn't.  Tomb Raider is NOT one of those movies that will go down in history as a fine example of American films.  It is instead, just a fun, silly but entertaining, great way to spend two hours.  Tomb Raider was probably not intended to be a ""masterpeice"" of a film.  It probably won't get any Oscars, but I feel that above all, the film was made to be fun.  And it is.
Now for those of you that liked the game, I'll think you'll get a GREAT kick out of the movie.  The reason some critics probably trashed it is because that are not at all familiar with the game.  I belive Angelina Jolie does a wonderful job portarying Lara Croft-she has the same look, attitude, spunk, and even the same accent as in the game.
The plot is definatly there, despite what some people feel.  If you really pay attention to what is going on, it is a fun plot filled with much action.  (By the way, don't you just love reading those reviews of people complaining that they didn't find a plot and that they were asleep through 1/2 the movie?  Well there's your hint!!)

I must admit, I agree with the people who complain about a lack of character development.  But the movie is still FUN and EXCITING to watch, and that's what it's all about anyways.

Tomb Raider, based upon the popular videogame series of the same name, is a character based action movie that centers on wealthy Lara Croft, an adventurer and tough cookie.  The plot is standard- find a treasure before the bad guys do and destroy the world. Blah blah blah.
What makes Tomb Raider better is the spunk injected into the character of Lara by actress Angelina Jolie.  Her natural beauty and strength are the very essence of Croft, and work well.  Humanity is also in the character of Lara Croft, a welcome addition to a character regarded for her body and guns.  She cries, she bleeds.
There is sexual undertone in this movie too- and quite a bit.  Of course it comes in obvious form as obligatory female AND male shower scenes, nudity, etcetera.  But it comes in subtle ways as well.  Watch for it.  It's very well disguised at points.  This sex is associated with the violence in the adrenaline/endorphin rush associated with action movies, and to be blunt- Jolie.
The action scenes are many and short between, well-choreographed and marvelously unrealistic.  This is an action movie after all.  Explosions, bullets, and grace.  At times the action sequences take a Matrix feel to them.
The only major beef I had with this movie was the over-marketing it took on and the publicity.  Oh, and the last shot (a freeze).  But don't worry, there's only one Pepsi reference (nearly subliminal).  I had to refrain from rating this movie higher because of its explotation of the action genre.  Otherwise, a fine girls, guns, and gore flick- PG-13 for the pubescent male.  ""Hellooo, opening weekend gross!""",996710400,19,1835,4.765079365079365

1313807,3,B00003CXZ1,"'Tomb Raider' is a movie released during the summer, and fits perfectly into that niche of big budget, star-powered, special effects extravangas that we have come to expect during the hot months of the year.
  The plot is mainly concerned with an evil group of people, known as the Illuminati, who are determined to gain ultimate power by using the once-every-five-thousand-years ""straight alignment"" of the planets as a trigger for a solar eclipse, which, along with some valuable stone pieces, and a dial taken from a smashed clock, will grant them their desired power. All sounds a little much? Well, it is. But, trust me, the story moves along well, you have no problem understanding what's going on, and the plot points allow for some really good actions scenes.
  As Lara Croft, the protagonist of the piece, Angelina Jolie excels at providing intelligence, cunning, acrobatics, and mucho sex appeal. The Croft persona is quite adept at fighting, and is always vigilante against the evil guys who are hell-bent on taking over the world. Jolie takes the character seriously, although one does maybe sense a slight tongue planted in the cheek at times. The supporting characters, heroes and villians both, do a good job, and the special effects are top-notch. Some of the sets built for the big actions scenes were really impressive. There is a sub-plot, centered around Lara's missing father, which, though it gives a chance for Jolie to act alongside her real-life father (Jon Voight), doesn't seem to make any sense as part of the movie - until the end.
  'Tomb Raider' blends a bit of 'Indiana Jones' and 'The Mummy' in order to come up with some of its recipe. The imitation is flattering, though not quite up to the same level. The exotic locales used for the film added nicely to its overall look, though I felt a sense of slightly lagging direction. Every now and then the movie seemed as though it were in need of moving a bit faster. But that is only a small complaint. All in all, it was a very satisfactory film.",996105600,,2028,4.763532763532764
1313862,2,B00003CXZ1,"Being an avid fan of the ""Tomb Raider"" video games series originally produced for the Sony Playstation, I went into the theater with high expectations - I'm ashamed to say I still haven't learned to keep from getting my hopes up.  I have been let down once again by a mediocre film that is simply 90% flash and 10% substance (perhaps I'm giving too much credit, no?).  Having read an early draft of ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" I procured online from various sources ([...] [...] etc.), I am of the opinion that the original story should've stuck - it would've made for a more entertaining and perhaps more authentic flick.  Instead, we have Jolie tumbling about the screen performing ludicrous stunts in dubious scenarios with nary an intelligent line to spare.  Dialogue is pure fluff and I could only think of what might've been had Simon West conferred with a better staff of writers.  Of course, the appointed authors have either little/no experience or have concocted the daft plotlines for flicks such as the Jim Carrey juggernaut ""The Mask"", the Travolta/Cage powerhouse flick ""Face/Off"" and Bradford May's hideous sequel ""Darkman III: Die Darkman Die"" in the irksome trilogy that began with Sam Raimi.  ""LC: TR"" would also have benefited greatly from a better stunt coordinator/choreographer, say the likes of Steven Lambert (Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story, Total Recall), Glenn Randall (The Mask of Zorro, Raiders Of The Lost Ark) or Peter Diamond (Star Wars - Episodes IV, V and VI, From Russia With Love).  Instead, we have Simon Crane, whose resume consists of such popcorn debauchery as ""Vertical Limit"", ""The Mummy"" and ""The World Is Not Enough"" - it's no wonder there's such a slight on realism for the movie's stunts.
Jolie is a more than suitable incarnate for the anatomically enhanced VG heroine, her beauty and physique unparalleled (and certainly more viable, even with a padded bra!).  However, I think that an up-and-coming talent or a virtual unknown would've made better use of the role.  Jolie is simply an alluring incentive to buy a ticket, the weak (albeit relevant) storyline taking a backseat to her superstar status.  Among my compliments to her is that she dons a decent British accent - there is a nary a moment that she forgets her character's UK origin and drops it completely (people like John Malkovich are VERY guilty of this post-production no-no, especially with European brogues).
Okay, we Sony gamers all know Lara is the female counterpart to Indiana Jones and can get through a sticky situation by the skin of her teeth (if you're a skilled player), but the Werb/Colleary story and the Massett/Zinman screenplay make her look untouchable and this is where my qualms with the film start to boil over.  In the game, Lara is subjected to pitfalls filled with razor sharp spikes, wounds by several rounds from semi-automatic weapons, mangled unrecognizable by rabid attack dogs/sharks/alligators/lions/tigers/bears, poisoned by darts and/or snakes and, if one is not careful, she will plummet from great heights to her death.  Basically, everything that can be a believable and/or realistic threat to her IS.  In the movie, however, Jolie has more than ten assassins enter her home in the dead of night complete with SWAT team garb and sniper rifles.  In a sequence that lasts about ten minutes, she conquers them all and escapes with neither a flesh wound nor a stain on her pretty silk pajamas (in ivory, no less).  The inconceivable occurs again when she traverses to Cambodia to recover the first half of the Triangle of Light - men armed with impressive glocks and pump shotguns seem to shoot right through her.  The gamut of her injuries is a pair of skinned knees after fighting a robotic training device, a bloodied nose in a climactic fistfight with her rival and a slashed palm after incorrectly handling a hovering dagger.  Come on, people!  Throw SOME realism in there, even if only a little!
Where this film begins to gain some points is its meticulously designed sets, from ancient Cambodian temples to the scrupulous creation of Lara's estate.  Those who are very familiar with the video game will know that the landscaping and design of the house is a very close match to what we see on our screens when we enter Lara's jungle gym of a residence in the video game.  Other than these small details, there is not much to praise Simon West for, nor any of TR's other filmmakers.
If you see this movie for anything, see it for Jolie's spunk and enthusiasm on playing a character we all know and love.  If you're expecting a smorgasbord of dazzling visuals and a smart script, rent ""The Matrix"" - ""Tomb Raider"" is mediocrity at its worst.",996105600,7,4685,4.867924528301887

Like the music, Lara's clothes (if not the same, at least something closer to what we've seen on the game), the action and the way it happens. The lack of this link to the game renders the big screen Lara just a mix of Indiana Jones, James Bond and, yes, Luke Skywalker. Lara as we know never suffered from such an identity crisis. Were the movie called ""The adventures of Jolly Jolie"", it would be ok. Just a new adventurer on the block. But this Lara. Or at least was supposed to be. The clothes she wears when she goes to the ice city, close to the end, belong to anyone but an adventurer. Too fashion. The plot is the usual result of a commitee: too much heads trying to prevail each of their opinions always end up transforming a horse on a camel. Angelina is fine, except for her lips. Is she trying to kiss someone during the whole movie? The lack of links to the game kept the fantasy we've been fed for years out of the movie. They tried to make Lara real, but she's not.

Demi Moore stars in this adventure film based on the TV show- Tomb Raider.  She goes in search of the lost lego chip which could blow up the Earth.  Along the trip are Harrison Ford and Denise Richards.  Now the movie was okay, but wasn't great. Why was ANGELINA JOLIE in this movie- well it's simple- she wanted to show off her small hoots which were mostly stuffed beanbags.  Demi Moore, though steals the show.  Um K?  So if you like PG-13 that's all GORE, NUDITY and ""BRIEF"" LANGUAGE- go see this 90 minute peace of junk- TOMB RAIDER.  But it you wanna get some action- see TOM HANKS in FORREST GUMP.

1314096,4,B00003CXZ1,"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider opened to rather unfair mixed reviews from the movie criticism establishment.  In fact, this is a quintessential summer movie action film, introducing an entirely fun action heroine to the big screen.  Angelina Jolie brings a sense of humor to her portrayal of Lara Croft, treading on Indiana Jones territory but never quite crossing into homage. The plot has the complexity and faux mythology of a 60s sword and sorcery film, but the action pacing and special effects are pure 2001.  Lara Croft must deal with the challenge of a device that, if properly aligned, will permit its user to control time. Many guns are fired, lots of things blow up real good, dastardly deeds are done and thwarted.  This is the type of movie to which  one takes a big bowl of popcorn and a willing suspension of disbelief.  This is not high art, this is summer fun. As far as I'm concerned, the only shame is that they didn't go ahead and film two sequels while they were at it.  Angelina Jolie can carry an action film, and she is ably supported by a fun cast.  This is a movie worth seeing, for many of the same reasons that the Brendan Fraser mummy movies work.  It's perfectly understandable that it's not everyone's cup of tea--it's a big budget escapist Hollywood fantasy.

1314185,4,B00003CXZ1,"Your mission: obtain the clock powered by the All-Seeing Eye, which will begin its countdown to the complete solar eclipse in which all the planets will align. Use this to locate and reunite the two missing halves of the Triangle of Light, which will give its possessor power over time itself.
Sounds like something out of a video game, right? Well, actually, it's the mission that serves as the plot for ""Tomb Raider,"" which is based on the popular interactive adventure. The movie, which is packed with action that contains little to no suspense, rides to success on its exotic locations, daredevil stunts, and the winning actress Angelina Jolie, in a role she was born to play. I wasn't on the edge of my seat, but I enjoyed it more than expected.
The movie introduces Lara Croft, born of a wealthy father whose expeditions took him out of the picture when Lara was a young child. Her wealth seems of little interest to her, though she puts it to good use by investing in mechanical beasts and reality-based scenarios in order to practice what she does best: discover artifacts. Lara is strong, careful of showing her sensitive side, and extremely witty and articulately sarcastic.
This is the Angelina Jolie that we love and admire. Her charisma and charm are a force to be reckoned with, not to mention the fact that she fits the role perfectly with more than just her looks. While beautiful as an actress, it is easy to see that she also has a brutal side, one that makes her a very formidable action heroine.
Upon investigation of a clock found in her home, she discovers a ticking clock, seemingly running on no apparent source of power, which is ticking down to the impending solar eclipse in which all of the planets will arrive. But when a pack of thieves invade her home and steal the clock, which has more significance than it appears to have, she learns that it is a key to the discovery of the Triangle of Light.
At this point, all things about the mystery in the plot are explained: the reasons for which the secret group called the Illuminati wish to obtain the precious piece, and what can occur when the two pieces are united once again. Here, the movie segues into a race against time concerning who will win the prize, during which Lara will bargain with the opposite side in hopes of changing time and bringing back her father,
Sounds kind of silly, huh? Well, it's inspired by a video game, so your expectations shouldn't be too high. The movie makes the mistake of taking itself a little too seriously, The action sequences are fun and interesting to watch, and may even evoke some chuckles from the suaveness Jolie brings to her character in the most tense of situations. But they have no suspense at all: predictability sets in a lot, and it's easy to guess who's going to end up where.
But it's not a total loss. I found myself laughing at those actions sequences, not so much out of disbelief as out of sheer enjoyment. It's the kind of movie that makes me feel like a kid again, which is, at times, a lot of fun.
The settings and locations picked for this film are divinely chosen. There are two places in the movie, the locations of the two halves of the triangle, one of which is an ancient tomb, and another in Iceland that holds a large, rotating model of the planets (trust me, it looks like something straight out of the prop department from ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory""). Still, these settings call attention to the details throughout, while bringing back fond memories of the Indiana Jones films and other adventures.
""Tomb Raider"" is what it is, a good adventure, not making the mistake of trying to be something more. The action may be a little lifeless, but it can be a fun ride, mainly in part to Jolie's brilliance as an actress. If I were hiking in the Amazon, I'd want her as my tour guide.",994464000,,3845,4.557803468208093
1314186,5,B00003CXZ1,"First of all, I am not really an Angelina Jolie-fan - or I wasn't ... before Tomb Raider.  It was impossible not to see her skill and admire her in this film.
She's strong, talented, agile and unafraid to do her own stunts.  She's got guts, style, beauty (obviously - please ignore the pointy bra, guys), and a special charisma you don't often see in young actors.
The action & special effects in the film were excellent, the plot was solid & well drawn, and it actually allowed Jolie to demonstrate her own acting skills.  I *Felt* a well of emotion from her, as she tried to 'prove herself' to her dead father.  She had a lot to draw on in those scenes & it showed.
In general though, I think Jolie just had great fun doing this flick. In the scene with the dog sled, you can see the 'endorphin-high' on her face. She's definitely into thrill seeking. At one point, she bursts into laughter for no apparent reason - and I definitely think that's Angelina, not her character.
I like both sci-fi & fantasy, and especially since this movie is loosely based on a computer game, I certainly didn't expect a plot true to reality or even to the laws of physics.
The same was true, of course, with the Matrix, the Mummy, Indiana Jones, the Bond series, etc. Some people don't seem to remember that movies are *about* escapism - so if a fact seems ""out-of-order"", it's OK.  Truly. It's *just a movie*.

1314188,5,B00003CXZ1,"I've been waiting OVER A YEAR to see this movie.  Yes, I know that sounds sad, but I'm a big fan of Lara Croft!  I couldn't wait until it finally came to our theater.  And, it's been a very, very long time since I was actually this excited to buy tickets to go see it.  So, was it worth it?
YEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS!!  This was one of those rare movies in which I was sad to see it end.  I was just sitting there like an idiot, grinning through it all.  So what did I see in it that I loved so much?
First off, I'm a girl so I wasn't obsessed about Angelina Jolie's body like many viewers.  What I loved about this movie, was:
#1.) _THE PLOT_  It really keeps you entertained, and it's quite suspensful at times.  Lara is trying to find two pieces of an ancient, powerful triangle.  She has only a certain amount of time to do this, as it only works during the planetary alignment, which only comes once every five thousand years.  But she's not only racing against time, she's also racing against THE BAD GUYS, the evil Illumati who are also trying to find these pieces.  However, at times, Lara must work together with these guys in order to find the pieces.  To top it off, her father, who disappeared on the field when Lara was a child (she misses him immensely) is somehow connected with it all...She must decide whether to save the world by destroying the triangle, or using it for herself in order to see her father again, and ultimately destroy time itself in the process...
#2.) _THE ACTION_  Sit through the first ten minutes and you'll see how intense the action is.  It's just awesome.  Especially if you're a fan of the video game series - watching her whip out her pistols to shoot a baddie brings back pleasent memories...
#3.) _EVERYTHING ELSE_ There's humor, some romance, great music, great picture.  When they filmed the movie, they actually traveled to those places (Cambodia, etc.) to film, so it really adds a sense of wonder as you watch it.
All in all, this is a GREAT movie and by FAR the best flick of the summer!  I think the only type of person who wouldn't enjoy this movie would be a 90-year old spinster who never leaves her house all day.  I LOVED and I can't WAIT to go see it again - I'm sure you won't either!!",994291200,,2244,4.335731414868105

The idea of controlling time itself compells many to become greedy, but the absence and input of Lara's father kick in dramatically to show that Lara really does care about not being evil.

There is one major action scene in the beginning where Lara Croft's house is being attacked, while incredibly well done its not needed. What should have replaced that scene is more of Lara in some Tombs. 70% of this movie should have taken place in Tombs.

1314280,1,B00003CXZ1,"I am an action movie fan.  I have liked movies that came across as so-so to most people I know.  I even bought a B-movie with an attitude called Mean Guns.  But this movie HURT!
Jolie did a great job with a rather limited role.  The character of Lara Croft presented had absolutely no depth.  Otherwise, the movie went from boring to plain sad.
Several characters just plain didn't need to be there.  (The main bad guy's lackey, and Lara's tech specialist)  They had no significant role or real purpose.
The action sequences were either laughable or dumb.  (A ""trained mercenary"" stands still for 10 seconds trying to aim an automatic rifle at Croft as she is coming near directly at him.)  In addition, the whole bungee war sequence in the mansion was awful.
The villian just wasn't menacing.  With his odd fetish of trying to live as Persian royalty, he just seemed wormy.  At times, he was even geeky.
The special effects weren't even that interesting.  While they were prevalent, they were highly gratuitous, and often overdone.  The stone textures were so over-rendered, they looked more like Playstation graphics.  Several sequences, such as Lara and Mr. Bad Guy running up a techno-pyramid just had no logic behind them.  Even as symbolism and ""just plain fun"", it didn't work.
I wouldn't tell anyone to see Tomb Raider.  There was nothing redemable about a film that seemed to send the most time trying to fit Jolie into spandex tops.  I nearly fell asleep three times...
If I didn't see Evolution an hour later, I would have had one heck of a frown on my face.",994118400,4,1569,4.6678832116788325
1314281,5,B00003CXZ1,Tomb Raider was by far one of the best movies i've ever seeI love everything about it. Angelina Jolie did an awsome job she is my favorite actress. In every movie she is in she is the star even if it isn't mainly about her. She gets into the character so much it makes the expeirience of the movie all the more realistic!!!!!!!!!!I LOVE TOMB RAIDER!!!!!!!!!,994032000,,357,4.424242424242424
1314282,3,B00003CXZ1,"Okay, here's the point you most want to hear: Angelina Jolie is most definitely an excellent screen Lara Croft, and should put an end to the endless fandom grumblings and cries of ""she's no Rhona Mitra."" Jolie and the screenplay bring three-dimensionality (in more ways than one, nudge nudge wink wink) to the cult videogame character, and the backstory of the her father's death (Jolie's dad Jon Voight seems like stunt-casting, but it works) is touching without being cloying. The only aspect that made me snicker at Jolie was the rather unconvincing padded bra used to get Jolie up to the, ahem, dimensions of the videogame Lara.

But where ""Tomb Raider"" fails is in its script. Sure, there's action and adventure and great scenery and a touching father-daughter subplot, but there's a definite lack of consistent humor or romance in it. In my opinion, the leaping, derring-do, and relentless loud gunfire would have certainly been leavened by a few more quiet scenes that ma! de us laugh or that established a sexual tension between Lara and her adversary, the slick and smooth but black-hearted Powell. The producers miss the boat by not adding the sort of humor and sexual tension that makes successful similar films (like the Indiana Jones or James Bond series) fun to watch for reasons other than the action. A good comparable would be the ultra-successful ""Charlie's Angels"" movie: strong female characters, action sequences, but also funny moments and romantic subplots.

What very little humor in the film is injected by a couple of the supporting characters: Lara's technogeek assistant Bryce and her faithful, long-suffering butler Hillary (a nicely understated bit of acting by ""Red Dwarf""'s Chris Barrie, whose character is sadly abandoned about halfway through the film). But the tongue-in-cheek comments come few and far between. Come on! We're talking about an overproportioned beauty queen firing whopping great guns at three-faced stone idols..!.you mean to tell me there's not anything the *slightest* bit ridiculous about that? In short, the screenplay--and Lara--take themselves way too seriously. Jolie *can* play this sort of humor: there's a funny scene halfway through the film where a UPS deliveryman is aghast at the after-battle damage to Croft Manor; an offhanded comment by Lara about redecorating is delivered with a sharp and casual tongue-in-cheek quality that defuses the tension of the preceding hardcore action scene. But this is one of the few and far-between scenes that made me laugh.

There's a bit of sexual tension in the character of Alex West, a rival tomb raider who apparently (it's never quite spelled out) has had a past romantic relationship with Lara. One nude scene (no, no, fanboys, it's not Lara!) does not a romance make. The point is not that just because the hero is a girl, there *should* be kissy-stuff going on, but c'mon...to cast an international sex symbol like Jolie and not utilize !this aspect of both her personality *and* the character appeal of Lara Croft is plain-out missing the boat.",994032000,6,3056,5.108

1314345,1,B00003CXZ1,"I was anticipating this movie ever since I saw the first trailer for it.  Angelina Jolie looked like the perfect Lara Croft, the action scenes looked spectacular, and there were a lot of guns and things blowing up.  The movie is all of those things, but that certainly doesn't make a good, even acceptable, film.  Wait, why am I even calling this disgrace to cinema entertainment a film?  I should call it a total waste of time.  Let's see, where should I start?  I want to be able to tell you all the things that are wrong with this movie, but I'm not sure if I can do it in 1,000 words.  First off, this movie took itself WAY too seriously.  I mean, c'mon people, it's a freakin' video game.  Speaking of the video game, the special effects were better in the game than in the movie.  Anyway, the only slightly believeable character in the entire film was Jolie.  With a new director, a new crew, a new supporting cast, better special effects, better sound, a better plot, and a better script, she would've really shined.  The crew probably spent more time making Lara's tight shirts (which, by the way, was the most entertaining part of the film) than the rest of the film.  There might as well have not been any scriptwriters at all, because there isn't a script.  Jolie spends all of her time rolling around on the ground, shooting stuff.  Under a new stunt coordinator, the action scenes could have been intriguing.  But in this movie, every action scene is just one quickly-cut take after another.  About a half-hour into the movie I was starting to get a headache.  I read a review written by a critic who said that this movie would have you ""screaming, laughing, crying, and cheering until the very end!""  I don't know how he could say that when I enjoyed the trailer over the movie.  If you are planning to see a movie, at least see a quality one like ""A.I.-Artificial Intellegence"" or ""The Fast and the Furious"".  You've been warned.",993945600,4,1944,4.512893982808023

1314350,3,B00003CXZ1,"Everybody I know who saw this movie hated it but I liked it.  Angelina Jolie does a great job in the movie.  She pulls off the character even though based on a video game there's not much to go by and she pulls off a convincing British accent.  It's cool to see a woman as an action hero in a major motion picture.  But why do some people refer to her as an ""archeologist""?  She is not.  She is a treasure hunter.  There's a BIG difference between the two.  The movie is based on the popular video game series Tomb Raider.  The basis of those games is for Lara Croft, a thin woman with a huge chest, who likes to shoot guns and searches for treasures.  In the movie, Lara Croft finds a mysterious clock that starts ticking for no reason.  When she brings the clock to be checked out, it gets stolen.  She learns that the clock leads the way to find the two pieces of a triangle.  She has to fulfill her father's unfinished mission-to destroy the triangle.  The triangle allows the user to control time but Lara wants to see her father again.  Will she obey his wish or will she try to see him again?
The plot is undeveloped even though it contains references to the illuminati and planetary alliances in it.  The scenery in the movie is breath taking.  They shot in exotic locations like in Cambodia and Iceland. The action was well choreographed but it takes too much time to get to them.
I could tell what would happen before it did but I still found the movie enjoyable.  Besides the special effects, Angelina Jolie is the best thing in the movie.  She gives the movie a certain coolness which an other actress in her role would not be able to give.  If you're looking for an action movie to enjoy and not worry about a confusing plot, this one works.",993686400,,1754,4.3058103975535165

Like who as the computer nerd and the other ""tomb raider"" (sorry I can't recall their names)? How were they connected to Lara Croft?
Angelina Jolie does an excellent job with the physical aspects of the movie, but at times she looks like a bored rich kid with nothing to do.

A decent action movie should have 5 things: decent plot, decent villian, decent quest, decent music and decent setting.  Well, the setting was cool.  The plot was rambling and inane.  I couldn't even care about the action.  The quest seemed interesting at first, but became burdened with fantasy and just fizzled.  The music was ""the Matrix"" mixed with ""the Mummy"".  The villian was one dimensional, but that isn't surprising as ALL the characters had one dimension.  The sidekicks aren't funny, the bad guys aren't chilling, the mentors don't lend the viewer to sentiment.  Bottom line, the animators of the video game gave Lara Croft much more personality.

The soundtrack is what keeps you hanging on the edge of your seat, however. There is a plot, of course, but don't be too worried about finding hidden meaning in it: the Clock of Ages leads to the halves of a triangle which, when connected (with a little more help from the Clock of Ages), allow the holder to control time. Good guys fight bad guys, but in this case the good guy wears a lot of black as well, and bobs her head to Outkast. As I said before, the music and Jolie are what make this movie fantastic. Watching Lara Croft run, jump, and shoot to fantastic songs by the likes of Moby, Nine Inch Nails, and Groove Armada make buying the soundtrack just as worthwhile as seeing the film!...",993600000,,956,4.468571428571429

The day it came out, I read the bad reviews (as I knew there would be) but ignored them. So, when I finally say it, I was not disappointed. To start off: THE MOVIE HAD A PLOT!!! For some reason, lately, whenever someone dislikes a movie, it's become hip to say ""there was no plot."" Granted, it wasn't Shakespeare and it won't be nominated for any awards, but the writers and director managed to keep a tangable plot throughout the movie.
Moving on, the real high point, of course, was the action sequences! Ultimately, these are why the movie was made and, I believe, save the film. Critics, however, criticized the scenes saying the were to much like a video game. Hmm... I wonder why that is?!? I felt that each action sequence was exciting and visually stunning, thanks in part to Angelina Jolie. My personal favorite, and most exciting, is the one in the house (not the beginning).
To conclude, don't go into this film thinking ""Ohh, I hope this gets nominated for Best Picture or Best Screenplay"" because you'll set yourself up for a major disappointment. Go in expecting an action movie and you won't be disappointed!",993513600,,1240,4.565022421524664

1314433,3,B00003CXZ1,"The ""Tomb Raider"" videogame series is a lot of fun, smarter than most of its competition, although no great shakes intellectually. But still, for a game that's ultimately about shooting some stuff, sneaking past others, and absconding with one valuable or another out of an Indiana Jones setting, there's as much brainpower involved in the game as twitch power.
Unfortunately, what passes for brains in an action game can't be mistaken for the same in a movie. Which isn't to say that ""Tomb Raider,"" the movie, is a bad movie. It's got spectacular action set pieces, beautiful locations, a lead actress who totally inhabits the role and a few supporting players -- although by no means all of them -- who are perfectly competent.
But the script is an awful, crushing, stupid bore. Elements are introduced into the story and then ignored, the film leaps about from one place to the next without explanation, and climactic moments are reduced to emotionless special effects shots because the film is so underwritten.
For a videogame movie, or a videogame in general, this is pretty good stuff. But as a film -- which is, ultimately, what this is of course -- ""Tomb Raider"" is fun but not satisfying. Even ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" feels more complete and weighty, and that's saying something.

Sure this movie has some bad acting.  They all do.

So what if the civilization was 5000 years ago when no one knew about 9 planets--ever heard the myth about the ADVANCED city called Atlantis that got wiped out.  You know what I liked about this movie?  It was thematically correct.  It started out in one direction and kept going that way until the end.  The fight scenes were well edited(to all editing directors who may be reading--we like well defined, fast motions, not this slow John Woo stuff.  I have a slow speed on my DVD player if I so desire.) and the gore and cursing was kept to a minimum.  Angelina looked perfect in the role and the bad guy was, well . . . bad.

And the attempt to flesh out the character, with requisite flashbacks and a deftly cast Jon Voight as her father (as he is in real life) is only half-baked.  Jolie never gets the chance to take the character over the top, to claim the role in that big, audience-pounding way that James Bond (Sean Connery) and Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) do theirs.

It tries to be a suspense movie, but it's not.  The plot is so confusing and far-fetched that where it could be suspensful, it is instead just boring.
It tries to be a love story, sort of.  The two lead characters start of hating each other and end up together, but you never get enough story to explain or support it.  It's one of those things that just seems to happen.
Add to all that a plot that was taken straight from a creative writing class, add characters that never really develop at any point, subtract from that the action you never get and the love story that never happens, and what do you get?
You get a two hour waste of time, with absolutely nothing to recommend it.  Even Angelina Jolie wasn't enough to make this film interesting.  Not only wouldn't I go see this in the theatre, I wouldn't even rent it when it came out.

Millions of teenaged boys have marveled at Laura Croft's all too unrealistic body (Jolie wore a padded bra to look more like the woman designed by horney computer guys.).  For those of you that don't know the game, there is even a cheat that allows computer game players to play the game with a nude Laura... sad, but true.  Guys, she is an animated character.  But gaming aside, the movie is a lot of fun, and you don't need to play the game to get it. A few things, like the fact that the outside of the house is exactly as pictured in the game are amusing to those who have enjoyed the game, but again, you don't have to be a video-game junkie to like the movie.  And in my humble opinion, many of the game players take themselves a little too seriously.  Those that complain about departures from the game are the same playes who will probably complain that the stunning ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" has no chocobas.  Really, guys...  One of the best things about the film is that it doesn't intend to be serious, and it shows.
As one of the minority (female players of the game), I can honestly say that I would have seen the movie whether or not it was based on a game.  Jolie has a strange appeal that draws both men and women to her.  She's sexy, dangerous, and unabashedly herself.  That's what we like about her.  She was the perfect choice to play the role because she is a lot like Laura.
This movie will not win an Oscar (excluding, perhaps, one for special effects editing), but who cares?  If I wanted to see a serious movie I would have rented ""Sunshine"" again.  ""Tomb Raider"" is a hell of a lot of fun and should be appreciated as such.  It's a great way to get away from yourself for a while and I, personally, cannot wait for the sequel.

That movie was good but personally Tombraider blew The Bone Collector, Girl Interrupted, and Gone in 60 Seconds out of the water. Hopefully, Angelina will get Best female Actress because of Tombraider The movie. My last advice is if you haven't seen this movie go buy a ticket and see it as fast as you can.",993340800,,811,4.30718954248366

Angelina moves just like the animated Lara Croft and I could not think of any other actress who could play the part as well as she has!!!

Plus I like Laura Croft well the games because I play them once in a while so I wanted to see how the movie related. But i thought the movie was really good and the story like was pretty good the only thing that cold have been better was the overall plot but even that was good do I gave this movie 5 stars.

She alone makes the movie watchable and although she cannot make up for bad writing or directing, she is fun to watch as a strong heroine.

Nope, nad it is almost eerie how much Angelina Jolie looks like the real Lara Croft from the videos games!! Its almost as if they created the game character from Angelina!! You certainly can't get any closer to looking like the real thing. I was quite impressed with the film myself.  Not boring for second and jam packed full of action. Lara Croft is on a mission to retrieve two peices of an ancient triangle in which when put together you will be able to control time!! She's not the ONLY one trying to get her hands on it,but she is only finishing what her father once would have done if he had not died. He is played by her real father Jon Voit.  She wishes her father back very badly because she misses him so, and joins forces with the bad guy for the time being in order to attempt to retrieve the second triangle peice. If you are looking for an action flick with brains look NO FURTHER then ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" !! *enjoy*

1314556,1,B00003CXZ1,"Why?  The question is why some people think this is a good movie.  The plot was completely pointless.  Think about it folks.  The idea is to not reunite the pieces.  Solution, destroy the clock, end of story, no need for forced action sequences that were completely stupid anyway.  Don't try to justify the story either, it was stupid and deep down you know this to be true.  The bungie ballet was stupid, the robot was, well stupid, the climactic scene at the end was nothing more than an erotic fairytale and completely sad (Angelina running in slow motion with her breast heaving in every direction).  They forced Angelina Jolie's breasts into every possible shot.  Though they are very nice, it was inappropriate for this film.  The shower scene, can anyone explain this?  I can, it was to stir some primal sexual emotion and to provide an opportunity to show Angelina's bare back and expose as much breast as possible and stay within the PG-13 rating.
This movie is a true loser, stupid forced action scenes, marginal special effects, and not just the absence of a plot it was worse than that it was contrived.",993168000,2,1115,4.695876288659794

If you liked The Mummy Returns (I did) then maybe you'll be able to get over watching the stone soldiers turn to living things.  I just think two movies with ancient fake artifacts and stone people is enough for one summer.
Jolie does fit the part of Lara Croft, but the movie itself is too much action and not enough storyline, there is much emotion shown and the charcters are for the most part dull.  The whole egyptian pyramid, being able to control time thing, I can't get into that.

Sure she shoots the robot but when dozens of armed men attack her home she doesn't even accidentally hit anyone!!  I'm not a blood thirsty movie goer but I found it tiring that she kept them busy dodging her ill directed fire.

1314560,1,B00003CXZ1,"Now THIS is a movie.  A HORRIBLE movie, that is.  Tomb Raider was touted to be a lot of things, but good is not one of those things.  The plot is embarrassingly cliched, the villain is a card-board cut-out, the characters are paper thin, and the movie is, on nearly every account, a failure.  This movie leaves the same bad after taste as other great video game movies (like Super Mario Brothers, Street Fighter, Mortal Combat II, etc.).
Now, many fan boys will try to convince the world that Angelina Jolie saves this movie, but that is not the case.  While she has the attitude and passes as a physical embodiment of Lara, her character is so under-developed that no one will care whether she dies or not.  The cameos by John Voight are also somewhat pointless and, in the end, only add to the convuluted plot.
Basically, this movie felt like an episode of Relic Hunter with slightly higher production values.  Tomb Raider is not the action film of the summer, though.  In fact, I nearly fell asleep on more than one occasion while viewing it (what with the film pretending to be a drama for the first 45 minutes).  If you want to see this film, go see an Indiana Jones movie instead.  Hell, see ""The Mummy"" or ""The Mummy Returns"" instead of this stinker.  As for ""Tomb Raider"", lets try to pretend like it never happened...",993081600,12,1326,4.506276150627615
1314561,3,B00003CXZ1,"She's got the attitude, she's got the moves, she's got the--well, she's got the look; Angelina Jolie is Lara Croft, in ""Tomb Raider,"" the action film adapted from the popular video game, directed by Simon West.  Like Indiana Jones and James Bond, Lara Croft is larger than life, and she had to be to bring this film to life.  After a slam-bang opening, we find Lady Croft at home in England, where the game is about to begin.  Still lamenting the loss some years earlier of her father, archeologist Lord Croft (Jon Voight), Lara comes across a certain object among his effects one day that had been hidden away in a secret place in their mansion.  Unsure of what it is, or of it's value, she seeks the counsel of a friend of her father's, and soon learns that whatever the piece is, it's somehow the key to an undertaking of dubious merit which has long been sought by a gentleman by the name of Manfred Powell (Iain Glen), who must have it in order to complete his quest.  Lara, however, has no intention of parting with it, but Powell is a man of persuasive means and is determined to have it at any cost.  But his methods of bargaining do not sit well with Lara Croft, and they are soon at it head to head.  And it's only the beginning of an adventure that will ultimately take them to opposite ends of the earth and into some ancient and exotic tombs, as Lara strives to uncover the mystery behind this cryptic antiquity.
 Jolie was the perfect choice to embody Lara Croft, from the confident swagger she affects, right on down to her articulate British accent and the riveting glare she uses to such great effect.  Her Lara is fearless and appealing, and director West allowed enough time in between the action for the character development that makes her more than just an action figure, and Jolie put the time to good use to flesh her out and create a well rounded character, and not just a one dimensional caricature; and the movie is all the better for it, as it provided the substance the film needed to make it fly.  Lara is actually a fairly complex character, in fact; possibly more than you would expect in a movie like this.  She's daring, yet vulnerable, but with a sleek exterior like tempered steel.  And watching her, you get the feeling that there's nothing she couldn't do, which gives her something of an invincible quality.  Even when she's immersed in the action and the excitement gets intense, there's no denying that she is absolutely the star of the show.
 This film has all the ingredients with which West should have been able to whip up a veritable banquet for the senses; but unfortunately, he came up a bit short-- as if he did everything right, but failed to add that extra pinch of spice that would've made it sumptuous and lip-smacking good.  What the film lacks is atmosphere and that special touch that someone like Tim Burton always brings to his films, like what he did with ""Batman,"" for example, which took you a step beyond what you were actually seeing on the screen.  West had a decent story, magnificent special effects and the kind of leading lady directors dream of having; but he brought it all to fruition with a bare modicum of imagination, presenting it with a kind of straightforward what-you-see-is-what-you-get style, which worked well enough for him with ""Con Air,"" but wasn't enough for this kind of film, which desperately needed some nuance to really sell it.  Not that this is a bad movie, by any means; it just lacks that spark of life that would've made it special.  In retrospect, West was probably not the best choice to put at the helm of this picture.
 The supporting cast includes Daniel Craig (Alex), Leslie Phillips (Wilson), Mark Collie (Larson), Chris Barrie (Hilary) Julian Rhind-Tutt (Pimms) and Noah Taylor (Bryce).  Hopefully, there will be a sequel to this film; Jolie's Lara Croft is just too good a character to leave alone, and ""Tomb Raider"" is like an appetizer-- once you've sampled it you're going to want the full meal.  And Jolie is an actor who will deliver the goods if given the chance; she certainly did more than enough in this one to make it work, and her performance alone makes it worth seeing.  Now if they can only come up with a director who can measure up to her for the next one, and can deliver on the promise this film made but failed to fully realize.  Now THAT would be a sequel worth waiting for.",992995200,5,4398,4.553299492385787
1314562,2,B00003CXZ1,"I was actually thinking of giving this movie 3 stars until i read some of the reviews and had to laugh.  For starters the movie took itself way way too seriously, just compare it to The Mummy Returns.  Chris Barrie (for all you Red Dwarf fans) was completely under used and could have provided a lot more comic relief.  You got the feeling a lot was left on the cutting board.
And the plot - ok I know its Lara Craft, not crouching tiger, but please just a tad bit of reality - just a little But for those of you who still think they might watch this and dare try and follow the plot here goes nothing. 1.  The most glaringly obvious plot hole - 5,000 years ago noone knew there were nine planets in the solar system.  2.  5,000 years ago everyone thought the earth was either flat or the center of the universe or solar system. 3.  5,000 years ago noone was making huge turn shafts and fooling around with metallurgy. 4.  And finally on a ligher note - a friend pointed out that the biggest hole in the plot was Angelina Jolie going to bed wearing a bra, which is probably true all things considered.
Well you get the idea. As a side note for all those supposed wonderful guardians of our children out there, be less worried about kids slobbering over Angelina Jolie, and more worried about them if they think the movie has a plot.  Oh to be 14 again.",992995200,4,1352,4.25
1314563,4,B00003CXZ1,"If you feel like turning off your brain for 2 hours, this movie, which is like a cross between Indiana Jones and Xena, provides an extremely fun diversion.  The plot is quite thin and only serves to set up a reason for the lead character, rich treasure hunter Lara Croft, to search various sites for various objects against ruthless competition (a secret international cabal called the Illuminati).  It is only necessary to change about 10 minutes worth of the movie in order to completely alter the setup and still leave the rest of the movie intact (Personally, I would have like to have learned more about this movie's version of the Illuminati -- see Robert Anton Wilson's novels for more). But this is just an action movie, so who cares!  The action scenes are fantastic and are some of the best I've seen.
Other pros is the superb casting of the beautiful Angelina Jolie, the use of absolutely gorgeous and exotic locales, a rocking soundtrack, and some good moments of humour, not to mention its rare use of a very strong female character.

1314633,5,B00003CXZ1,"This is a superb action movie. It gets down to business without any excessive preliminaries. The opening scene features Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft fighting Simon, a mighty robot--and this is just her training! The plot is neither complicated, nor particularly realistic. And therein lies the beauty of the film. It is adventure, fantasy, and action, all rolled into one. And, of course(how can one not mention this!?): Angelina Jolie posing for the camera, like the seductive tomb raider that she is. Lara Croft is an aritsocrat, intellectual, a superheroine, and one of the Valkyrs all at the same time.
The storyline takes back seat to the action/adventure/scenery part of the movie. But the storyline does have the underlying theme: the love of a daughter for her father. It was a nice touch to cast Jolie's real-life father as the father of Lara Croft who guides her from beyond the grave, because it added a certain sense of realism and persuasiveness to Jolie's acting. Obviously, this is not a tear jerker or a mushy overly-sentimental movie, but it does contains hints of tenderness, which I for one found credible. Aneglina Jolie, the action, and special effects grab you from the start and never let go, until the movie's ended.
The supporting cast is also quite good: from the Lara's comical butler to her arch rival--everyone and everything falls into place for this fabulous action-adventure that takes us from Britain to Cambodia to Russia, without missing a beat.

1314634,1,B00003CXZ1,"By far the greatest thing about this movie is Lara Croft herself, played by the bodacious Angelina Jolie. She does a fantastic job, and I can't think of anyone who could have fit the role better. However, breasts and a great bod only go so far, as this movie shows.
The plot is crafted around the wildly popular video game series of the same name, and as such is unbelievable. However, a movie is a movie and is thus allowed to be ""fun."" Of course we can have time travel and mystical cities and statues that come to life. That's what a summer movie is all about. But sometimes the fantastic elements in a movie get out of hand. Such is the case in ""Tomb Raider.""
Lara Croft plays the daughter of a deceased English archaeologist (played by John Voight, Jolie's real-life father) who was familiar with the mystical ""Triangle of Light,"" an ancient object of great power that would allow its user to travel through time. The triangle's power was so great that it destroyed the city, and the ancient people who used it--fearful that it would wreak havoc again--split it into two pieces and placed them on opposite ends of the earth. Now for some reason, the planets are about to align for the first time in 5,000 years, and the two halves of the triangle must be united before this occurs for it to assume its former, powerful abilities.
Croft finds a mysterious clock in her house that is the key to finding the two pieces; it acts as a kind of compass, and is the coveted prize of her nemesis Manfred Powell (played by Iain Glen). He belongs to a secret society called the ""Illuminati,"" and for some reason has been directed by the leader of this society to retrieve the two pieces before the planetary alignment is complete.
The plot quickly degenerates into cliched action fare: Croft's compass is stolen in a hyped-up raid on her mansion (why is it that the bad guy always seems to have an army of henchmen at his disposal, merely for the purpose of getting killed in a hyped-up action scene?), and then she has to get it back. In the process, she travels around the world, doing Venice and Siberia (where she is apparently unphased by the cold, letting her buxom chest hang out while yelling ""Mush!"" to her dog sled team), dodging computer-enhanced stone statues and bullets all the way.
Aside from the sad plot, ""Tomb Raider"" redeems itself somewhat with Jolie's performance. Her attitude fits the role, from her pseudo-genuine accent right down to that ""annoying"" strand of her that keeps dangling in her face. She pulls off the cool, cocky heroine so well that she'll have men going gaga everywhere. Her skin-tight shorts and a clearly unnecessary shower scene were meant to sell the movie, since it's obvious that nothing else would. Croft's computer geek sidekick Bryce isn't funny, even though he's intended to be the comic relief. Her absurdly prissy butler Hilary adds a bit of humor, but his role has been done before. Even Manfred Powell isn't sufficiently evil to make us hate or even dislike him. I never developed feelings for him one way or another. Come to think of it, all of the characters have about as much depth as a wading pool.
This movie had some potential, but it wasted it all on trying to appeal to the short attention spans of 13 year old boys. If something isn't exploding on the screen, something is exploding out of Jolie's blouse. The movie hardly gives you any reprieve from its tireless and overdone actions stints, and the worst part is that none of them are even cool.
""Tomb Raider"" tried to be the next ""Indiana Jones,"" but it played out more like ""The Mummy Returns Again."" I suggest you save your cash and wait for the rental.",992822400,2,3667,4.591463414634147
1314635,1,B00003CXZ1,"Let's get something straight.  I did not see this movie voluntarily.  I was DRAGGED by my cousin to see it on the only night I had off of work the whole week.  I knew right from the get-go that a movie based on a figure that, not only is she highly over-exaggerated, but very disturbingly, is the object of sexual fantasy for many 12 year olds, would be awful.  Lord help me, I was right.
I'm not one to walk out of movies, but I left my cousin there and walked around a little bit.  I just couldn't sit through it anymore.  The plot was....there was no plot.  How can you make a plot out of a game like that?  Video game to movie adaptions NEVER work, mainly because there is bad acting, bad casting, and no plot.  This movie suffered from bad acting and bad plot, as far is I could tell (I only stayed for around 45 minutes).  I am not fond of Angelina Jolie in the first place, but she did not perform well in this movie at all.
The special effects were painful to look at.  As far as we have come in the use of CGI and special effects (Final Fantasy: The Movie), they couldn't do better than that?  These effects make movies that you would see on Mystery Science Theatre 3000 look like masterpieces.  The action sequences are beyond pointless.  If you want to see real action, see Gladiator, or Crouching Tiger.  Not this movie.
And finally, I have never, EVER, seen a movie that has been so over-advertised.  I never wanted to see the movie in the first place, but as each day went on, and another advertisement came on the TV, I just got more and more frustrated.  'Go to Taco Bell now and get YOUR Tomb Raider Stuft Burrito!  IF you bite into Lara Croft, you win!'  'Go to King Kullen and get YOUR Tomb Raider paper bags!' 'Register at NYIT and get a FREE course in Tomb Raider 101!' 'Go to McDonalds, say hello, and get over 45 pounds of useless Tomb Raider promotional garbage!'.  Never in my life have I ever seen a movie so overblown like this.  The game itself was never any good, in fact it was repetitious, boring and sleep-inducing.  The movie is no different.  Don't see if you know what is good for you.  The game is aimed at 12 and 13 year old's pubescent fantasies.  Making a movie out of it was a bad idea.",992822400,2,2226,4.2304038004750595

1314724,1,B00003CXZ1,"Now don't be fooled, kids, this movie isn't good enough to merit even one star. Its actual rating is somewhere on the order of -3 stars.
Tomb Raider is, by far, the worst movie I have seen since...wait, there was no worse movie. Talk about orignality. Using a video game character/plot and action scenes ripped off of every previous action movie. What creativity! Amazing!
Well, let's get cracking. The first thing that triggered my stupidity sensors was the very first scene of the movie, where Lara is training in some kind of simulated tomb, and a psychotic killer robot jumps out and attacks her with a deadly array of dental instruments. After an impressive showing of hackneyed Matrix-like, shoot-em-up action, the dim-witted Lara defeats the robot, laughing hysterically all the way. That's a mere sampling of the stupidity to come. Don't worry though, I won't spoil it all. You have to get some enjoyment out of your $8, don't you?
Well, as said, nothing is new about the action, except for a particularly ludicrous scene where Lara kills off about ten armed commandos while jumping around on a bungee cord in her own house, in her pajamas, and unarmed. The rest of the action was copied from previous movies, I suspect because the producers were too busy playing Tomb Raider the video game to think of anything original.
This is one of those movies where you're constantly rooting against the main character because she is so incredibly stupid. Laughing in the face of danger, chuckling when your life, the fate of the universe, and especially the fate of the ""magical triangle"" are at stake, are not signs of a good action hero. Excuse me. Heroin. These are possibly signs of a lobotomy patient, a video game character, or a flat out idiot, but definitely not of a good ol' action hero. What ever happened to the Golden Age of Action--the 1980s, when films such as The Delta Force, Rambo, and Lone Wolf McQuaid were the authority on how to make a good action film? They were corny yet funny. Tomb Raider was corny yet corny.
Another thing that was very chucklesome was the intensity with which Lara performs ordinary actions, from opening the hell out of a book to viciously smashing a hole in the wall of her own house when she thinks there is an evil clock waiting for her on the other side. But it doesn't end there. There's also intense dog sledding, intense obelisk sufring, and intense showering. That brings up another point. Whenever Lara is around, you never know if you're watching a movie or some kind of model photo shoot (with a hideous model). There is the aforementioned intense shower scene, where Lara flips her hair around in slow motion and gazes passionately at the ceiling. This scene has no purpose whatsoever, except to mark the point where the audience will really start hoping that Lara will get killed for being such a doofus. But, getting back to the point about the model photo shoot thing, there are numerous random close-ups of her thighs and butt, as well as conspicuous, slow-motion chest bouncing. And every character she meets has some comment about her alleged ""beauty."" Perhaps this was intended as an attempt to make her appear attractive. It failed miserably.
If the makers of this movie had put down their Playstation controllers for a moment to focus on the movie they were making instead of the video game they were copying it from, they might have realized what a waste of time and money it was, and done us the favor of scrapping the whole movie.

1314726,3,B00003CXZ1,"I recently viewed the Tomb Raider movie Friday, and I was a little disappointed with the movie.  Angelina Jolie is the only reason to see the movie. She gave a terrific performance and made the movie visually stunning to watch, yet the movie lacked humor.  Several of the jokes in the movie fell flat, and they action waned at times. Maybe I was expecting to much because all of the hype, yet I can just give this movie an average rating.",992736000,,438,4.395061728395062
1314727,4,B00003CXZ1,"Angelina Jolie...(Stuttering Speechlessly, trying to find the Words)...Wow. She Fits the role of Lara Croft like a Glove, I don't think Anyone on Earth could have done a Better Job. She pulls a Renee Zellwieger on us and does a Great British Accent and she Loads the film with Sexy Glances, Sexy Smiles, Sexy Winks, Sexy Poses, Sexy Walks, Sexy Bashings... Everything she does is Damned Sexy. Without her Involvement the film's Faults would have been a Lot Harder to Forgive.
Jolie makes the Character of Lara Croft her own Forever, she does what Sean Connery did to Bond, she's the First Lara and the Best Lara. Hopefully there Will be sequels because the Character of Lara Croft deserves a Better Showcase than this film provides. Don't get me wrong, the film is Ultra-Enjoyable as an Action-Adventure, but does it reach ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" levels of Brilliance, Not by a Long Shot, and Luckily I never Expected it to.
Where-as most of these kind of films, Bond films, Indiana Jones films, could Seamlessly blend Action, Horror, Romance, Drama and Suspense, ""Tomb Raider"" succeeds on One Level and One Level alone... Action. It Attempts the other levels here and there, but Fails Miserably. The Romance Elements get the Shortest end of the stick, only about 30 seconds of the film even Touch on Romance. Drama is attempted (mostly the scenes about her father) but the results are Laughable, Comedy is attempted but the results are Anything But Laughable. Horror and Suspense are almost Completely Absent... Come on, Lara is a Female Bond, The Lady Indy, do we Ever really Fear for her Safety. At Least Indy and Bond were Captured and Tortured now and then, Lara is as Indestructible as Air Force One.
So Obviously, it's All about the Action. If you can Accept that as I did, you will have a Very Good Time. The film has Three Action Set-pieces, one at the Start, one in the Middle and one (yes.. you guessed it) at the End, which are Truly Spectacular. Probably the most Annoying part of the film was that All of us Die Hard Fans of the ""Tomb Raider"" games were So Glad that our Beloved Lara was getting a Big-Screen Transfer, the Problem is that she's even More of a 2-D character Here than she was in the Games. Not Once does the film mention how she Became such a Great Archaeologist, or how she became so Rich, or how such a Little Rich girl could Possibly love traipsing around Dirty Tombs and Caves. We learn absolutely Nothing about the Character, which is what us fans were looking forward to the Most. (I'm sorry, that was a Blatant lie, we were looking forward to Jolie most, them Action, Then learning more about the character. 2 out of 3 ain't bad, hence the 4 star rating.
And Now for the Performances. Angelina was Perfect, Utterly Perfect. Iain Glen was Very Good as the Villain of the piece. He won't go down in History as a Classic Villain, but he gives a Good Enough performance to warrant a Mention. Fellow Aussie Noah Taylor provides the so-called Comic Relief and I was Shocked to find him Totally Unfunny. Yes, he isn't given the Greatest Dialogue to work with, but a Better Performer would Hurtle that Obstacle and be Funny Anyway. Adlib, Rewrite, do Something. Chris Barrie is even Worse, between the Two of them, they comprise the Comic Relief cast, and for me, they didn't provide a Single laugh. Jon Voight is Ok, but he doesn't have much Screen time to work with. Simon West's Directing leaves Little time for anyone other that Lara, and No time for Any sort of Character Development. He is a Competent Action Director, but the trick is for us to grow to Care about the Characters in between the Action scenes. West still has to Learn that trick. Sure, it Looks Great, Sounds Great, Is Great Fun, but it Could and Should have been More.
Overall, Its Angelina's film and depending on your Jolie Love-Level she will either Make or Break the film. Go in expecting Substance over Style, and you'll come out Fuming. Go in expecting Angelina, Action and Adventure, and you'll come out Smiling.",992736000,12,4023,4.635854341736695
1314728,5,B00003CXZ1,"If you like the game, the movie is just as good.  I liked very much and the plot is great as well as the acting.

1314729,4,B00003CXZ1,"Lara Croft is an intelligent girl in addition to being very strong hearted and very strong willed. She is a very wealthy person who has been troubled by the loss of her parents at an early age. On the anniversary of her father's death, she stumbles upon a sacred clock that begins to tick after not working since before her birth. Her suspicions are answered to be true when she receives a letter from her father, written some 15-20 years ago. It tells Lara that the clock was symbolism of an item that she had just recently found, which was one of the pieces to a puzzle that everyone wanted to solve. Her father told her that she would have to travel long distances to get the 2 remaining pieces of the puzzle, which were a couple of halves of a steel triangle. With these three objects in her possession, she could have whatever she wanted most, which was to speak with her father again.
The plot is very original and interesting, which is a necessity for a good movie. My only complaint is that it wasn't completely justified and led to a small bit of confusion. The similarity to the video game is uncanny. Angelina Jolie has the identical voice to the one of the video game, not to mention she looks, and acts just like the real one. There weren't any mistakes at all in relation to the game; the house was huge in both Tomb Raider's and the objects, such as the weapons and jewels, didn't show any difference to the game, fortunately. My biggest compliment is of how well the crew brought realism to the ancient time slot with absolutely amazing stunts. Other movies like ""The Shadow"" failed to show many impressive stunts or date realism. All of the acting was very good, especially Angelina Jolie. This is an exciting and interesting adventure that won't dissapoint.",992736000,,1775,4.55
1314730,2,B00003CXZ1,"I have played the Tomb Raider game a few times and it's a pretty good game.  But after checking out the movie, I have realized that a good video game doesn't always equate to a good movie.  The movie had no character development and it focused to much on Lara's breast and skin shots along with her simple character lines.  It was a sterotypical movie for sure, Lara seemed to be larger than life with wealth, beauty, and intellect.
I am sorry I wasted my money on this movie, because I could have went to see ""Evolution"" or some other flick instead.  If nothing else, this movie has been hyped up by everyone and that in itself will cause millions to waste their money seeing it.

1314731,4,B00003CXZ1,"This movie is nothing special. It's not intellectually-stimulating. It's not life-altering. Tomb Raider is basically a hot chick in tight clothing jumping around a lot. That's basically it. And frankly, that's what it should be. After all, that's what the game is about.
I didn't go into this movie expecting a really moving story. I expected an action film. And trust me, this film DOES deliver. It's a summer action flick, what more do you expect? Action movies are, by definition, fun movies with a lot of explosions and action with very little story. Not every film has to be a psychological examination of the human psyche. I enjoy films like that, but I also like the occasional action film. And why? Because it's FUN!!! It's based on a freaking video game for crying out loud, it's SUPPOSED to be fun.",992736000,,808,4.73758865248227
1314771,4,B00003CXZ1,"Tomb Raider explodes onto the screen with spectacular special effects, some show stopping action scenes and best of all, Angelina Jolie perfectly cast as Laura Croft.  Her embodiment of the popular video game character is very close, yet Jolie gives Lara Croft her own spin and the result works in her favor.  The end result?  It should've been a lot better, because what Tomb Raider is missing, is a good script.  Things begin well enough, but after about a half hour of introducing characters and drawing up some interesting character angles, things quickly disintergrate into a typical summer action film.  An assault on the senses but a total insult to the brain.  Still, if you're looking for action, sex appeal or just a harmless way to kill 104 minutes, you could do a lot worse than Tomb Raider.
Tomb Raider begins with a bang like most action films.  We meet up with Lara Croft as she battles a massive training robot.  This sequence is an impressive way to kick things off.  As Croft, Jolie gets to flex her action muscles flipping all over the place and firing guns at the metallic menace.  This scene serves its purpose well enough, to draw the viewer into the type of film Tomb Raider is.  From here, we learn that heiress Croft is haunted by the mysterious vanishing of her father (played by Jolie's real life pop Jon Voight), whom disappeared several years ago.  There's a lot of buildup in the first twenty minutes or so as Laura begins to investigate the mysterious origins of a rare clock she discovers walled up in storage, hidden by her father.  Lara discovers this ""clock of ages"" is a device that will allow to user to control time and space when all the planets are aligned.  From here, most of the plot and characters go out the window in favor of wild action sequences.  There's some hokum about a cult called the Illuminati-also seeking the clock.  They exist to give Lara the majority of the resistance she will encounter during the course of her adventure.
What doesn't work about Tomb Raider is the lack of a good villian, a script with several loose ends and an unsatisfying climax which feels a tad rushed an anticlimactic.  Our villian in this film just sits on the fence, he's manipulating Lara to do his bidding, but he provides no tnesion.  His character is bested by Lara for almost the entire film, we are given no real reason to fear him and his minions.  By the finish, it almost becomes a bore, the clash between Lara and the villian provides no suspense and by this point, we almost don't care anyway.
Another problem is the weak screenplay.  Its got plot holes big enough to drive a truck through.  For example, in one scene, a character sells out Lara Croft to the villians and his motivations for doing so are never explained.  We never know why, nor do we ever see this character again.  Another head scratcher is the appearence of a little 'phantom' girl who pops up on occasion to guide Lara Croft along on her quest.  Exactly who she is or why she's there is anybody's guess.  There are a couple of genuinely silly moments involving Jon Voight (as Lara's father) that are intended to provide emotion but can be taken as unintentional comedy.
Director Simon West (Con Air, The General's Daughter) handles this film and provides as many pluses as he does minuses himself.  As far as handling the more plot heavy elements of the film, West inexplicably seems uncomfortable.  In contrast to his previous film, the plot dependant General's Daughter, West did a much better job.  Whether or not you liked that film, West told the film's story with a sure hand.  In Tomb Raider, not a single shot seems to last more than six or seven seconds.  In trying to develop a plot with this 'MTV' style, it gets tedious and absurd.  On the flipside however, West stages some of the most exciting action sequences seen in a while and does a brilliant job of orchestrating them.  The two showstoppers are the battle in Croft manor and the fight with the stone creatures.  West is a good action director and in this film, has done some of his best work.
Exhilirating action aisde, the good points outweight the bad almost completely thanks to Angelina Jolie.  Saying that as Lara Croft, Jolie may very well be THE sexiest woman ever to grace the screen is indeed an understatement, but it's also unfair.  Jolie looks the part, but she plays it even better.  Stepping into the shoes of a video game character and doing so successfully probably isn't the easiest thing to do, and it's never been done right up until now.  Angelina Jolie steps into that skin tight outfit and weilds those pistols with such gusto and enthusiasm that it's hard not to like her character.  Admittedly it's a bit hard to get to know her beyond the first twenty or so minutes, but with such a lackluster script Jolie really shines through more than any other actress would or could.  She's a great actress and makes for a perfect action hero.
All in all, Tomb Raider's good points outweight the bad because it's still a fun adventure.  It may not be a classic, but there's enough sex appeal and adventure to keep your eyes glued to the screen for its running time.  If you're willing to turn off your brain before you go in, you'll probably have a good time.
I hope this does well enough to inspire a Tomb Raider 2, there's a lot of room for improvement and to not use Jolie again would be a crime!  She's a perfect hero and makes this DVD a must own for me when it come out!",992736000,16,5480,4.555669050051073

I don't imagine it will be nominated for any academy awards, and I haven't ever played the TR game, so I can't speak to the trueness of the storyline, but it was a fun two hour escape - sometimes that's all a movie should be.",992736000,,437,4.2023809523809526
1314773,3,B00003CXZ1,"There's no question about it - Angelina Jolie IS Lara Croft, the Tomb Raider! As a man who is IN LOVE with Jolie, it was such a shame that the film could feel, at times, empty and cut down with many quick cuts to the next scene.
I know about the story of Lara Croft (well, partly) that she is the Indiana Jones for women, and that she is an adventure-seeking, wisecracking, beautiful lady of prominence. She is based on the computer video games by Eidos, and very popular with the geekboy group of men and boys. (I just watched this film because I love Angelina!) But, honestly, I expected a whole lot more - or rather, a whole lot better!
At times, I got so rapped up into the film that I couldn't wait for the finale to unravel. But then, nothing happened! For example, the ending where, after they find the Clock of Time, Lara has to escape via dogsledding. To make it worse, there's no snappy ending with a possible finality to the cave where the clock was located. The characters involved, like the villains  and even Lara's father, were just thrown in the mix and never truly flushed out. This film continues to drag with its insistent use of flashbacks, slow motions, and cutesy-poo remarks from a butler and an inventor.
In no way was this Jolie's fault, doing the best she could with what she had. But the film could have been better, no thanks to director Simon West's heavy-handedness with the film's structure and storyline, which was that cohesive. Let's just say, TOMB RAIDER could have been a little softer, like getting rid of the prologue with Lara's ""fight"" with a giant robotic spider (or whatever it was) named Simon; and that final shot before the film fades out with Lara, dressed like a lady, takes her trusty guns, on the butler's tray, and points it at the newly-constructed Simon (as in the director, perhaps?).
As I said earlier, the villains weren't flushed out properly. They appeared to be paper cutouts of other villains from the James Bond films. Iain Glen plays Manfred Powell, the villain who appears to be suave and sophisticated, but carries an ulterior motive in finding the Clock of Time and controlling time itself. Then there's his crony/partner/Lara's competitor (perhaps past lover, who knows?) Alex Marrs, played by curious appeal by Daniel Craig. There is, however, an interesting scene where he is showering and confronting Lara in the nude! (Though it's better left to the imagination to what he looks like.) Noah Taylor does provide the comedy as Lara's friend and inventor, Bryce. And then there is Jolie's real-life dad, Jon Voight, who has a cameo appearance as Lara's father, Lord Richard Croft. Voight, despite his minimal time onscreen, does a very good job in being the voice of the film. This comes just after his performance in the atrocious ""memorial"" film PEARL HARBOR, where he played President Franklin Roosevelt.
I wished, with all my heart, that the this film would have been much more - and it could have. Maybe in the next installment (they are planning two more sequels) they will shed somemore light on this film. Unfortunately, this one missed its mark.",992736000,,3120,4.724770642201835

Personally, I prefer the more emotionally complex roles Jolie has portrayed.

I'm a fan of Tomb Raider, a game my son and I played fairly often, but the movie itself falls flat, I'm sorry to say.

1314850,1,B00003CXZ1,"&#8220;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&#8221; is without a doubt one of this summer's most disappointing films. It is silly, but not fun, and pointless beyond belief. Even experienced &#8220;Tomb Raider&#8221; gamers will wonder why the writers and directors weren't able to do more with such an interesting, ready-made character. Oscar winner Angelina Jolie plays the buxom video game vixen with style, but is unable to do much with the thin plot and meaningless dialogue.  Fans and players of &#8220;Tomb Raider&#8221; the game will enjoy recognizing some of Lara's signature moves and may find the over-the-top exotic locales exciting (a game playing friend of mine turned to me and said &#8220;oh boy, and this must be the &#8216;level one boss'... &#8221; during one climactic scene in the film). Unfortunately, this movie is actually too much like the game.  As a rule, video games are driven by game-play and seconadrily by graphics. The storyline is there, but is generally loose and broad, providing enough basis for the challenges, terrain and foes in a particular game, but also allowing enough freedom for the gamer to play without being hindered by time lines and linear story telling. This formula works well in games, particularly in the &#8220;Tomb Raider&#8221; series, but falls apart in a movie format.  &#8220;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&#8221; the movie follows the adventure of Lara as she tries to save the world from the hands of the devious Illuminati by finding the two halves of a &#8216;triangle of light' before they can. Along the way, she is attacked by robots and stone monkeys, mourns the loss of her father (played by her real-life father John Voit - ready made chemistry!) and must battle with her feelings for her evil ex-boyfriend (West from the game). It is filled with gun play, action, and plenty of bouncing scenes. However, if you have seen any commercials or trailers for this movie, you have already been treated to the best it has to offer.  Summer movies should be fun and exciting, but this should not be the most that we are to expect from a big-budget Hollywood film. This movie had a lot of potential but ends up being a total waste of time and money. If you are in the mood for this type of archeological adventure but want something that won't insult your intelligence, you are better off buying the newly released &#8220;Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark&#8221; DVD. Or better yet, dig out your copy of a &#8220;Tomb Raider&#8221; game and play for a while - guaranteed you'll have more fun playing the game than being played yourself by Hollywood. Another suggestion: If you really must sit back and watch Lara Croft, find a talented ten-year-old child to play the game and watch the screen as he does. That'd be much more fun.",992649600,2,2781,4.885593220338983

However, there's a group of illuminati after it as well, and in order to get both pieces and hopefully bring her father back, Croft has to join up with them.

It is true that they have been stupid, with thrown together plots and characters who no one would have much interest in. The reason that ""Tomb Raider: Lara Croft"" succeeds where all of the past films have failed is because in this film, there is a character that is believable in the ways that the original Batman is believable: an ordinary person with no superpowers but just a large checkbook. The difference is that Batman helped Gothom City with his money and Lara Croft(Wonderfully played by Angelina Jolie) uses hers to go on archealogical digs, have an in house hacker and robot builder, and pay for her many ""toys"". The plot of Tomb Raider is a mouthful; the Illuminati want to reunite the two halves of a sacred triangle that were seperated to opposite parts of the earth in order to control time if the ""All-seeing eye"" can be used at the exact minute of planetary allignment which happens every 5,000 years and if the ""Tomb Raiders"" can survive the challenge of retrieving each of the two halves. At the beginning of the film, it is revealed that Lara lost her father Sir Richard Croft(Jon Voight) who was ""missing in action"" in 1985.  Lara lives in a lavish mansion complete with sports cars, a testing room so to speak where she can test herself, and a bungee system that is set up in her living room. One night Lara hears a faint ticking so she goes with her feeling and knocks down a wall with a large hammer. It turns out that the ticking came from a clock which holds the ""All-seeing eye"", the key which the Illuminati want for their own use. From here she is led on a clue here clue there quest in discovering the importance of the clock. She ends up finding her father's notes in the binding of a William Blake novel. From here the travels begin in search of the two pieces of the triangle. This film is pure eye candy, starting with great shots of Lara. It may be snowing and possibly under zero degrees Farenheit, but that doesn't stop here from wearing a tanktop. The special effects are great, but are not frequent enough to become annoying. Unlike ""The Mummy Returns"", Tomb Raider is not made of special effects, that is not all it has going for it. There is one last reason that this Video Game movie is different than the rest: the casting of Lara Croft. Angelina Jolie is a wonderful actress with real talent who is the winner of an Academy Award. Other Video Game movies have cast unknown actors with no real talent to portray the video game characters. With the success of this film(and there will be success) studios are planning to unleash a wave of Video game titles into movie theatres. You may be watching Joanna Dark and Duke Nukem in a theatre near you before you know it.",992563200,,2849,4.4788461538461535
1314942,2,B00003CXZ1,"This movie was very disappointing.  Since it was one of the most anticipated films this summer, I ran out to see it.  Instead of getting a ""Tomb Raider"" adventure, I was treated to a weak story line, a bunch of Jollie ""lip"" scenes with 4 action sequences.  Simon West, (the director) was more interested in getting Angelina Jollie to pose in front of the camera.  He should of thought about making her act as well.
This movie lack depth, and at times I found myself nodding my head trying to pay attention.  I think what killed it for me, was in the Ice scene, I started thinking ""How does she keep from freezing""? Since she was wearing a sleeveless blouse and an open coat.
My wife, who is a big action fan, fell asleep during the movie.  The games are way better than this movie will ever be.  Save your money and wait for the DVD.",992563200,,833,4.301282051282051

Angelina Jolie is not only one of the most gorgeous women today but is the best Laura Croft anyone could have asked for, she is LAURA CROFT.  This movie is pure mindless fun.  I think all of us Tomb Raider fans couldn't be happier.  I just hope that the paramont exec's see that we all want a sequel, no matter what the critics say.  Tomb Raider rocks go see it!!",992563200,,493,4.041237113402062

1314946,1,B00003CXZ1,"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider is one of those action movies where it doesn't know where it's going. The movie is bland and done cheaply. Angelina Jolie stars as Lara Croft, the British noblewoman from the hit video game series who wears skintight clothing and carries two automatic pistols and raids tombs for a living. I know that it doesn't sound bad but surprisingly it is. The opening action sequence is choreographed in an eventive way where she's mano a mano with a robot. After that the movie falls apart sadly. The basic plot is that it's the time when the planets are alinged(which only happens once every 5,000 years)and Lara has to piece together an ancient triangle that will give its possessor control over time. An adventurer named Manfred(Iain Glen)seeks the triangle as well on part of a secret evil society who want to dominate the world. It confusing how Lara seems to be working with him one minute and the next against him. Lara wants the triangle only so that she can go back and see her father(Jon Voight, who is Jolie's real-life father)who disappeared 16 years before. The movie tries to get emotional with Lara and her father but in a movie like this it comes out silly. The action scenes, when they happen, don't have any rooting interest in them either. The only thing I did like about this film was in one scene where Lara stubbles apawn a tomb filled with statues of monkey gargoyles. The art direction is very well designed for that scene but it's just that scene that stands out. Every other set looks uninteresting. Glen's is a villian that has no real menace or panache either. What this film needs is a much better screenplay and better direction from its director. Action movies either work or they don't. There all basically the same story. The film is better than last year's ""Charlie's Angels"" and ""The Avengers"" but it is a sad disappointment to see a hyped up movie like this to be such a bad film. It seems like every big movie that Hollywood makes  these days just turn out to be big disappointments like this. By the way Jolie has signed on for two sequels so expect Tomb Raider II in two or three years.",992563200,2,2141,4.575520833333333
1314947,5,B00003CXZ1,"This movie is FOR THE FANS, and nobody seems to have understood that better than its main star.  What a stellar performance by Jolie!!!
I've loved playing the Tomb Raider games over the past four years, and the movie is spectacular in that it delivers a visual feast between Angelina Jolie's excellent portrayal of Lara Croft and the lavish set designs.  From the moment of the first action sequence with Lara battling her robot, I was in awe at seeing Lara in a live action environment.  Only a holographic projector in the movie theater could have made it look more three-dimensional and realistic.  The film looks great!
The plot and screenplay admittedly have some problems at times, but it's certainly no worse than any of the in-game movie sequences.  Remember the source of inspiration for this movie, and that will help put everything about it into perspective.  For _true_ Lara Croft fans, it should be a very positive experience indeed!!!",992563200,10,948,4.89375
1314948,4,B00003CXZ1,"If you're willing to watch a movie based on a video game you shouldn't have high expectations. Then you may be pleasantly surprised. Saw it despite the mixed reviews in the Washington Post. The Baltimore Sun seemed to think it was OK.  But don't think you're going to see a movie, no plot, just action and Jolie. For many that may be enough.  Jolie has the body of a computer game hero so she fits right in. The sets were great, you get bit of a round the world tour. But at the end you may be left wondering if the game was superior.  At least a game will involve you in the plot.",992563200,,581,4.078947368421052

1314951,5,B00003CXZ1,"This was definitely an 'on the edge of your seat' action movie.  Okay, the plot is a bit weak - but when I go to an action movie, I am not going for the plot or character development...I want good action sequences.  This one has great action, excellent stunts, great graphic enhancements...what a ride!
Angelina Jolie play Lara Croft...a rich lady with a huge mansion set up with toys and gadgets for her hobby - tomb raider.  One night she finds a clock hidden in the house - this begins the main plot of the movie.  Her 'late' father has left her instructions to find (and destroy) the symbols of power before the planets align - but more importantly she must find them before the bad guys get it an use the power for evil.  Thus the setting for one action scene after another.  Each scene better than the last.
For action movie fans...this is a must see.",992563200,2,857,4.3924050632911396
