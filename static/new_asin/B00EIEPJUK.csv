5915318,1,B00EIEPJUK,"Story line trite, acting wooden, couldn't watch the whole thing, and I was REALLY bored and desperate for something to do.",1386979200,,122,4.857142857142857
5915319,4,B00EIEPJUK,"This was clearly super low budget, probably no budget, but a good performance from the lead actor, an ex-con vigilante, as well as his love interest. The dealers in the hood were believable enough, but the acting from the two dirty cops, downright laughable. For the most part I enjoyed the film.",1386892800,,296,4.711538461538462
5915320,1,B00EIEPJUK,"Way too much cursing. Couldn't watch this one thru either.
All that cursing was extremely unnecessary.
I hope the next movie makes up for this one.",1385596800,5,147,4.6923076923076925
5915321,3,B00EIEPJUK,"The film is also titled ""Zero in the System."" This is not its own sequel. Earl Coleman (Mike Simmons) has spent 5 years in prison. While in prison his sister dies from crack cocaine. Earl gets a regular job, but then goes ""Charles Bronson"" all over the dealers in his neighborhood. He also attempts to be a big brother while roughing up litterbugs.

Much of the film is spent developing the relationship between Earl and single mom Keisha (Tabitha Holbert). There are a few bad guy scenes, but this film doesn't cater to action/horror/ or blood fans. Much of the punching is done with a fist going at the camera.

I thought Simmons did an excellent job in his acting debut while the supporting cast needed help. The plot was slow developing and wasn't worth the wait.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1383955200,,810,4.611111111111111

5915337,4,B00EIEPJUK,Interesting,1439683200,,11,11.0
5915338,3,B00EIEPJUK,"Mike Simmons plays Earl Carter a man out of prison who wants to clean up his neighborhood.  Earl is a fixer.  He wants to fix the bad. His way of fixing is pretty much hands on.  The acting is weak but the storyline is anywhere big/large city America.

Zero offers inner city life lessons.  There's the pushers, the buyers, the thugs.  Hopefully there an Earl or two where they are needed.

Mike Simmons as an actor has skills to go somewhere.  He would have been a perfect candidate to have been on The Wire.  I hope to see him around in more.",1433808000,3,544,4.254901960784314
5915339,3,B00EIEPJUK,I liked this movie because of the reality of being cage up away from the world could damage most individuals and this movie pretrade how society was looked at in a mind of a damage ex-con.,1431302400,,188,4.25

5915344,3,B00EIEPJUK,A very good low budget movie to watch a little twisted storyline kept you guessing till the end.,1414281600,,96,4.388888888888889
5915345,1,B00EIEPJUK,"I really wanted to like this....I really did.  O.K. It's like this, a dude that grew up in the ""game"" comes back to the ""hood"" and goes all vigilante.  I don't know where to start, the acting, the script or the movie in general.  This general premise is plausible,but his in your face style would have gotten him killed in any ""hood"", dumb.  He has a chance to eliminate enemies and stay clear of the trouble or blame....but he doesn't, dumb.  He let's his enemies live when he has a chance to kill them, after they try to kill him, dumb. I've heard the phrase ""you're so country"" but I didn't know it was synonymous with dumb.  The only smart person in the movie is the caterer.  She made money catering and got her and her son a part in the movie......Smart. The best performance was by the drug dealer, unfortunately he was killed off too early to save this movie, but this guy was real.  I'm sure he's featured somewhere on a cell block near you.  They tried, and I wanted to like it, but I must say, don't waste your time unless you're tired of watching dust collect.",1412121600,,1072,4.32

5915349,5,B00EIEPJUK,"There's something both crazily poetic and simultaneously crazily gritty. Reminds me of The Wired with an even harder edge.  Brilliant acting and deceptively subtle low key but powerful directing. Tim McCain - with his star Mike Simmons as well as the other cast he's assembled are folks to watch. After watching it, I want to find out about so many folks involved with this film from director onwards. It's as if John Sayles without the didactic soap box meets John Huston in the ghetto.  It's violent. But this is not Quentin Tarantino violence which has its brilliance in humor and irony. There's a bit of irony here but far from much. It doesn't make you laugh at all. It's hard assed edgy. And everyone and everything from the dialogue to the physicality of the actors to the bleak Edward Hopper in the ghetto lighting gets to you. I grew up in Harlem in the 60s and 70s and lived in many urban areas of LA in the late 80s an 90s and this movie is real just like Compton and Harlem were ""real,"" harsh yet with people with a lot of passion and life but also sadness and fury from claustrophobia of fate and living situation. Sadness stays with you but, again, this is really interesting movie making - call it cinema, whatever.

PS: For all those folks complaining about the spareness around audio and lighting, believe me, this director was working something rich and gutsy. The opposite of lack of imagination. This has a sense of lushness even against how dry it is, like kindling amid a bout of drought about to crack into a burning forest.",1400025600,,1547,4.557553956834532
5915350,3,B00EIEPJUK,The movie had a good story but was dim-could have been music in the background or more going on in the background. I think he should've kept driving and drive to where he was suppose to go or it could ended up with him just kept driving.,1399075200,,237,4.0638297872340425
5915351,4,B00EIEPJUK,The movie was better than I predicted and it touched on real situations. The movie is a topic for conversation!,1394323200,2,111,4.6
5915352,3,B00EIEPJUK,The plot of the movie was good an ex-con trying to stay out of jail. But he goes back to the same neighborhood where he is being pulled into self destruction by people who have their own agendas. Because he has already been in jail they figure he will do anything.  But in life we are the sum of our decisions good or bad.,1393459200,2,322,4.03125
5915353,1,B00EIEPJUK,I was dissatisfied with this movie - terrible ending.  I w.ould not recommend so do not waist you time on this,1392768000,2,110,4.238095238095238

5915355,1,B00EIEPJUK,"I couldn't past the first ten minutes of such foul language, it was not very entertaining. It was a typical Afro-American movie.",1391558400,,128,4.863636363636363

5915357,4,B00EIEPJUK,"All the behind-the-camera work is great (camera, cinematography, plot, dialogue, direction). In front of the camera, the delivery by the actors is rough at times. It seems like there were a lot of competent people who had a solid vision for this film, but not a lot of money to make it.",1390694400,,286,4.519230769230769
5915358,4,B00EIEPJUK,"Too many ""art"" shots and not enough meat.  Good story line but the resolution in the end is vague and not well presented.",1389830400,,121,4.260869565217392
5915359,1,B00EIEPJUK,poor acting and the story lines was not strong a all. It was poor quality production low budget. Not worth the time.,1389830400,,116,4.318181818181818

5915368,1,B00EIEPJUK,"This movie started out too slow for me.

 It seems the plot was purposefully kept away from you in the beginning. A lot of movies hide the plot  so they can control the pace at which to build it, but this movie seems to keep it away from you like you're a little kid who just got his toy stolen by the school bully who has it dangling above you, just out of your reach.

I think that this movie may have been interesting but it was so boring waiting for the plot to unfold that I had to move on to something else.",1388793600,,513,3.9038461538461537
5915369,1,B00EIEPJUK,"Very Drear!

5915371,3,B00EIEPJUK,"The movie was ok, but it would've been better if the ending was developed more. It must have been budget constraints.",1387670400,,117,4.619047619047619
8605671,1,B00EIEPJUK,"Do not waste your time on this movie. Very very poor direction. It's as if a bunch of kids come together saying ""we've got nothing better to do, let's make a movie""",1476144000,,164,4.15625
