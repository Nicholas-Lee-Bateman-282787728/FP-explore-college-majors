2764108,4,B000NA78S4,"I highly recommend this series.  My only complaint is that since there are four discs, it doesn't make it easy to do the disc simultaneously (especially since there is about 5 minutes of filler with ""don't do this without doctor's permission).

2764110,5,B000NA78S4,"These workouts are amazing. The exercises, developed by Michael Carson are hard enough to really work. The DVD's are all shot on the beach which is not only fun and captivating but an incentive that this is the way to get a bathing suit body for sure. Plus, the shorter ""quick fix"" sections ensure that you'll have time to do these moves no matter how busy you are.",1177632000,12,365,4.382352941176471

2764122,5,B000NA78S4,"Yes, the title and the cover made my eyes roll. However, the workouts themselves are great, as are the production values:  filmed outside on a beach, nice music, good sound, the chaptering, etc.

I used these with the trainer, Michael Carson, speaking, not the girls, which is an option. However, keeping up with the young and fit females is inspiring, even though I really like the trainer, who's top notch.

Each DVD focuses on a different body part, but many of the moves work multiple parts or the core and legs and core and arms, etc.  Each DVD has the same four-minute warm up, a five-minute quick workout, and a 20-minute workout.  Each DVD also has a three- or four-minute ""trainer's tips"" on how to do some of the trickier moves.  The tips are very well done, and worth taking the time to watch.

I bought my set elsewhere, and now I am kicking myself for not using these when they were available on Prime to watch.  These are effective workouts that are fun.  I had read that Michael Carson's workouts were really good, but I had no idea just how good.  I'm definitely going to look for other workout DVDs featuring his workouts.

Oh, each girl uses one light dumbbell, probably a three-pound one at most, but I kept my dumbbells handy and switched out depending upon the move.",1384905600,2,1287,4.552173913043478
2764123,3,B000NA78S4,This is a pretty good work out but its annoying that the whole time the girls are doing the work out its almost like they are trying to sell sex appeal. the work out itself is pretty good and would recommend this if you don't mind the fake trainers.,1378771200,,249,4.1020408163265305
2764124,5,B000NA78S4,"I loved this Video because the instructors made me feel right at home giving me the feeling that I was there with them.  I am learning, re-studying, repeating, and relearning on a daily basis all of their exercises which have benefited me in many ways:  firmer/stronger arms, slimmed down hips, legs looking good, too, etc......I bought the DVD because I am so impressed with these lovely women who are smart and very easy to understand with their repetitive movements and exercises.  I would recommend this Video Set for beginners and experts because the Envy Girls actually appeal to everyone regardless of skill levels.",1375488000,2,622,5.019417475728155

2764126,4,B000NA78S4,"The videos were overall good for targeting and sculpting particular areas.  The buns workout really makes a difference quick for me. The lower body ones can give you a cardio workout too.  Some of the moves take some time to get used to the form to become truly effective so I recommend paying attention to the trainer at the end of the DVD before actually doing the main workout. Some people will be turned off by the skimpy outfits.  I personally like to see fit girls doing the routine because it gives me motivation. The warm-up lacks on cues for what to do next like other reviews mentioned but you get it down quickly anyway. I believe all the main workouts are 20 min each body area, a 5 min quick fix, and at the very end a trainer explains tips on performing some of the moves. I would up the weights after doing the routines a few times if you are already pretty fit or need a challenge.  4/5 because some of the moves need to be explained better to be effective.  I would recommend this to friends for target area sculpting.  People who are VERY fit already may not find this DVD useful.",1368835200,,1098,4.331707317073171
2764127,4,B000NA78S4,":) awesome workout DVD.. some of the workouts challenging, but I love a challenge. And the reason why I love you so much is because the workouts are 20 minutes n a extra. 5 min. :) I love warm ups..but the reason why I give it 4 stars is because the warm up are all the some the 4 DVDs.

2764134,5,B000NA78S4,"I started doing these dvds a few years ago. Fresh out of high school, never exercised a day in my life, but after a trip to Greece, my usual 110lb body had plumped up a few pounds, and since I had never been to the gym I wanted to start working out at home. These were great for beginners! I used them for a few months then graduated to Jillian Michaels workout dvds in conjunction with working out at the gym, now I just go to the gym! If I did these again now it would be way too easy, but for beginners they are great! Pretty girls, pretty scenery! Try it!",1334707200,,559,4.0
2764135,5,B000NA78S4,"I am not a big fan of exercising. I do it because I know it is the right thing to do but it is not my favorite thing. With that said, I do not exercise as much as I should and am trying to tone up and drop some weight. I get very bored with the same monotonous workout. I purchased a ton of videos from Amazon so I could keep things changed up and this is one of the videos that ended up in my basket. I am happy it did. So first thing is make sure you get yourself a pair of 3 lb weights. I wish I had known this from the beginning. In the videos they always use a 3lb weight no matter what body part you are working. My first week I did all the videos without the wieghts as I needed to buy some and I thought oh these videos are not too bad. Add the 3 lbs weight and WOW what a difference. My obliques my arms and my legs feel as if they are going to burn up and fall off by the end of the routine. I am a firm believer in no pain no gain so that fact that you can feel the burn with these workouts leads me to give them 5 stars.",1317686400,2,1032,3.611607142857143
2764136,5,B000NA78S4,"I think this DVD set is great for a beginner such as myself! I like that I can change up my workout from day to day and that it allows me to do exercises that are targeted to specific ""problem"" areas. I don't recall the description of the DVD set mentioning anything about all the workouts using dumbbells so I didn't have any and every workout uses them at some point or anther. other than that I really like the DVDs and think that it is something I can stick with.",1313884800,,467,4.142857142857143
2764137,4,B000NA78S4,"I love the dvd, but if you're used to doing tougher workouts, this dvd won't push you hard enough.  You'll find that you might have to increase the weight of your dumbbells to compensate for a tougher workout.  But it fits great in my home library because I live in a 3rd floor apartment, and there's no jumping involved nor obnoxiously loud music that would disturb the neighbours.
There's just a few things that need to be mentioned.  Sometimes the main instructor does not have proper form: Arms of envy, but she's not too far off.

I would recommend this dvd for those that are beginners, and even those that have a living situation like mine.",1309478400,3,647,4.551724137931035
2764138,5,B000NA78S4,"I really like this DVD!  It is by far one of my fav toning DVD's!  I love the setting on the beach and all the girls because they aren't drill sergeants, but they aren't over bubbly, both of which I find annoying.  I also love the 5 min. warmup on each DVD because it isn't just stretching, you really get yoour heart rate going.  I loved the legs of envy and the buns of envy is also pretty good.  I didn't really feel like the abs of envy did anything for me, but maybe since I am an athlete and already have pretty good abs thats why.  I think you'd enjoy the abs though if you want to get an ab workout without doing just crunches.  In all I would highly recommend this DVD, you get 4 workouts for basically the price of one!",1308182400,,729,4.020833333333333

2764140,5,B000NA78S4,"I bought these DVDs a few weeks ago.  I already see results.  My favorites are the buns and abs.  The work-outs are not the typical exercises that you see in other videos.  Some of them are actually fun to do...like the helicopter squat and the turkish sit up.  I would definitely recommend these because the exercises focus on problem areas.  I would say the DVDs overall are intermediate.  The arms DVD is beginner for me though.  However, u actually don't have to do a separate arm DVD because the legs, buns, and abs work-outs work your arms at the same time!!",1304035200,,564,4.514851485148514
2764141,5,B000NA78S4,The DVD box is so pretty. The work out is easy to follow up. The trainer is very focus and emphesize all the important techniques! They have 4 individual DVDs so I can share with other friends. Great!,1303603200,,200,4.2894736842105265
2764142,3,B000NA78S4,"I recently started an after school girls fitness group, 10 weeks of various exercise techniques to teach young women to feel good about themselves & their bodies & to learn that EVERYBODY can find a type of exercise that they like!
As a former yoga/group exercise instructor & personal trainer, I started the girls out with basic pilates techniques, then some yoga, walking, we tried HIP HOP ABS & (at the girls request) ENVY GIRLS...they orginally wanted to try Flirty Girl Fitness, but not only did I not want a pole erected in my classroom, but the reviews on Amazon kept me from that purchase & steered me to ENVY GIRLS. We popped the disc in,  excited to try something new, but were quickly disappointed. The warm-up's sound was poor & provided very few technical cues, even my teenage students were not all that impressed with the ENVY GIRLS themselves as we proceeded through all 4 workouts (a little like Barbies doing squats & tricep extensions complete with a ""smile & pose"" with each repetition), the routines were tough (which I appreciated) but poorly executed & GIRLS provided no motivation through the workout, in fact they barely count out the VERY repetitive reps...all of this being said, my girls group & I would suggest you go with Shaun T & his HIP HOP ABS series (a little cheesy sometimes, but TONS of fun & YES, you'll feel the burn, but you won't even care because time flies with this video)! Shaun T's technique is true, his prompts effective, sound & studio are top-notch & he really offers a workout EVERYONE would return to time & time again!",1302307200,23,1572,4.675090252707581

2764144,5,B000NA78S4,I honestly enjoy these DVD's; the DVD's are so much better than I expected due to the amount of clarity in the instructions. I LOVE that the majority of the exercises are done STANDING and the countdown of remaining reps are encouraging!!! I would have to say I enjoy these DVD's more so than the others I own. You cannot go wrong with these DVD's!,1301011200,,348,4.369230769230769
2764145,4,B000NA78S4,I will start with I have only tried one video. I tried the Abs video. I recently started dieting and was really excited about this video collection. I thought it would be great to start doing some exercise at home when I didn't make it to the gym. I got plantar faciitis in my feet from working out and I am no longer able to workout. I thought I could at least do the Abs video because I would not be on my feet. Well the abs video is completely done standing. Kinda a cool concept if I could be on my feet for thirty minutes. I was was upset wtih the fact that you need hand weights for the video. I didn't see anywhere that it stated you would need handweights. I thought you would for the arms video but from the introduction it looks like you need them for all the videos. Its an extra expense I didn't plan on. And more importantly when I decided to do the workout I found I couldn't until I got them. I know for me i want to work out when I first decide to and if I delay it I usually don't want to workout later. I did get hand weights but have only done the video twice. I think if I could have just done it when I was first excited about it that I would have done it more. I also didn't like the warm-up. It just showed the girls working out and this quiet voice in the background was talking. It was hard to hear and they switched exercises without letting you know verbally. I can't say I don't recommend the video but it was deffinitely lacking in some basic instructions,1299715200,,1484,4.051020408163265
2764146,5,B000NA78S4,"Sometimes I don't know if it's worth posting another positive review if a product if it already has a lot of them, but I really like this DVD set.  I have a variety of exercise DVDs, but this set is my favorite, and is the one I use the most by far.

I purchased Envy Girls to add some variety to my usual my gym workouts and to use on those days when I just don't feel like going to the gym.  I like all the routines, but at the start of the summer I focused on using the Legs DVD more often.  While I'm slim, my legs have never looked as long or as lean as I'd ideally like, but since I already exercise, I'd always thought that this was mostly just due to genetics.  But after using the Legs DVD regularly, I actually began to notice a difference--my legs did look longer, leaner, and more toned (especially my thighs), even more so than when I used to do yoga and pilates.  This wasn't due to any weight changes, so I think that the exercises really did work to change the shape of my legs.  Maybe all the cardio I was doing was making my legs stronger but also a little thicker.  This DVD slimmed them down nicely.

Michael Carson seems like a really good instructor who understands how women want to look.  For instance, he mentions that traditional crunches will give you stronger abs, but can also ""shorten"" them instead of ""lengthen"" them, which is why the abs routine includes so many standing exercises.  Throughout the DVDs there's a emphasis on exercises that will result in a shape change, and make you not only fitter, but also longer and leaner.  I'd recommend listening to his voiceover commentary during the exercises rather than the girls'.  I started getting even more out of the exercises once I started doing this, and he gives much better instructions.

Some people may find the whole concept of ""Envy Girls"" kind of silly or dumb.  But my opinion is that if it works, it works!  I'm glad I read all the positive reviews on Amazon and decided to try this.",1292630400,4,1978,4.363387978142076
2764147,4,B000NA78S4,"Okay, If your looking for a good work out this is for you.  That is, if you can get past the incredibly cheesy ""ENVY"" girls.  It seems like their trying way to hard to model for the camera and be sexy when doing the workouts.  I mean the ACTUAL work-out itself works and is pretty good when done right but as for the girls...I just think its kinda ridiculously hilarious. haha",1291161600,,376,4.267605633802817
2764148,5,B000NA78S4,I love this 4 disk set and highly recommend it.  The work outs really work!  My legs are sore for days after doing the buns or legs work outs so I know it does the trick.  I like the ability to turn the trainer commentary on or off since I get annoyed by work out videos that over explain how to do things.  There is no need to go into that much detail when you are watching how to do it and if you are doing the same work outs almost every day it gets old so I like the lack of instruction.  The girls are beautiful and are great incentive to try hard to achieve great bodies like theirs!  I try to use the four disk set like the P90X and do one disk a day.  This in combination with running every other day has helped me achieve the results I've always wanted in little time.  I went from a squishy size 4 to a tight and toned size 2 in only a few months time.  Great find!,1289779200,,875,3.8435754189944134

All the discs together make for a good warm up, but that's about it.  If you're a novice to working out and are just getting into it, then good on you and give it a shot cause it's better than nothing.  However I find it's kind of hard to take a workout instructor seriously and maintain motivation for the workout when she's wearing jewelry, makeup, and has her long hair down.  If you are looking for a a nice warm up then sure try this out, but if you want a workout and expect to actually achieve some results then I'd suggest you look elsewhere.",1277769600,,684,4.2384615384615385
2764152,5,B000NA78S4,"I had done a bit of research on various workout dvds before picking this one. I was happy to find that this one was well done. The workouts are 20 minutes long and there are 5 minute workouts for days you're super busy. I like that the exercises are broken down into specific area you want to work on. Most of the moves are easy; there were a few that took me a few tries to figure out, but I like that in a workout. During the 20 minute workouts, you go from each exercise to the next in quick succession. If that's not something you're used to it can be a bit difficult at first.

I really think that this is a great workout dvd set. My only issue is that it comes on four separate dvds when they really could just have been on one.",1274227200,2,734,3.993197278911565

So far I have done all the workouts twice and I feel pretty good. The first time I did them the day after, I woke up sore from my abs and butt. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a quick but strong workout. p.s. All the dvds have a 5 minute workout if you are tight on time.",1270857600,,409,3.823529411764706
2764154,5,B000NA78S4,"Hi Everyone! I purchased the Envy Girls DVD Set because I wanted to get a workout DVD for when it was snowing or raining or when something big came up and i couldn't make it to the gym. But, after trying all four DVD's one for abs, one for buns, one for legs and one for arms... I was really impressed! I was sweating like crazy and the exercises really made me feel like I was doing something. I now do these workout DVD's as well was go to the gym 5 days a week. I do the DVD workouts 3-4 times a week. I already am seeing results!! My whole body is getting a lot more toned. I couldn't be happier with this set. Money well spent!! You'll need a yoga mat and 2-5 pound weights for this DVD set. I think this DVD set is so different from anything else I've ever tried in the past, not boring, easy to follow, it works and the obvious level of physical fitness of the girls in the DVD's motivates you for bathing suit season which is only months away!! I'd recommend this set to anyone!",1270339200,,986,4.061538461538461
2764155,4,B000NA78S4,"I purchased these DVDs back July. I mainly used the Ab's of envy DVD. When I purchased these DVDs I felt stuck in a rut with my workout routine. I was bored and slacking off and noticing the effects on my body. These DVDs did add new workout moves to my routine. I have stopped using the DVDs but have continued to include aspects of the moves included on the DVD in my workout. The main reason I am rating this 4 stars is due to the fact that this is a set of 4 DVDs instead of just 1 or 2. Part of the reason I stopped using them is because it becomes quite a hassle to change the DVDs when wanting to work out a different body part, Specially when only having a enough time to complete a few of the 10 minute workouts on the DVDs.",1268784000,,733,3.9261744966442955
2764156,3,B000NA78S4,"This workout is good for days when you're too tired but just want to squeeze something in. The exercises will tone you but it won't help if you're trying to lose weight. Don't let the girls in their small outfits fool you. Most of the moves are effective and you will feel sore the next day. One thing I like about this video is that the moves are different from a lot of other exercise videos. It's a refreshing change from all the workout videos I've used. I don't really mind the girls. They're cute and chipper. I don't find their attire that big of a deal. I would be flaunting it too if I were in their shape! If anything, that encourages me to work harder.

I break into a light sweat when I do the legs and buns exercise, but the arms and abs section are too easy for me. I use Envy Girls when I'm bored with my other videos or when I am too tired after work for something more rigorous. I wouldn't depend solely on this product to get in shape. It's just too light, but it is decent if all you need is toning.

Complaints. The girls are pretty bad at cuing and explaining the form. This can be pretty frustrating for a lot of people. For me, I just copy their form. After doing the video once, you can pretty much figure out the moves the second time around. The DVD has extra clips of the trainer demonstrating and explaining some of the more trickier moves. I don't know why they didn't just use him in the video because he was so much better at explaining things than the girls. Also, the arms video concentrates too much on the triceps. My triceps were definitely sore the next day, but the rest of my arms (biceps) didn't get a workout at all! Also, if you're already in healthy shape, the abs section probably won't do anything for you.",1268438400,4,1751,4.2395209580838324

And some of the girls look obviously uncomfortable with the tiny boy shorts or bikinis that keep creeping upwards (if you know what I mean). Also, I think there should be at least one workout dvd that has ALL of the muscle groups or at least two combined. It's annoying that each dvd just focuses on one group. I would like to get more out of my workouts.",1267660800,2,526,4.3232323232323235

If you want something very intense this is not the video for you - I think this one is more for maintaining than for losing weight or building muscle.,1267574400,3,339,4.014925373134329

The warmup isn't cued well - they just move from one movement to the next. Also, the girls looked either super bored or were smiling self-consciously every ten seconds - they really had no enthusiasm. My biggest concern with this DVD was the lack of direction about form and posture, which could lead to an injury if you don't know what you're doing. Honestly, any sort of leading in that areas is completely nonexistant. This DVD has decent workouts, but overall it's super cheesy and very disappointing.

I promise it's not some silly joke that will leave you regretting spending your hard-earned money.

In fact, this is one of the best workout DVD's I've seen for dumbbells (arms). I ordered the series just for that 20 minute workout alone, after trying it for free on Exercise TV. (It's actually about $[...] before S+H is tacked on on the Exercise TV website.) It's recommended you get 3-5lb dumbbells I believe, which you will actually need for most of the workouts. I use 8-10lb ones, though.

I saw some users complaining about the fact that it's not challenging enough. Well, I am in fairly good shape, and I found some of these moves challenging. Of course, this isn't the only exercise I get in during the week. The ab DVD alone, for example, is definitely not enough to challenge me. I use it as a warm-up and then do 100's of more reps. But that's not something one should expect a DVD to walk them through, anyway (this isn't P-90X, people).

I've also found that combing the leg workout with the butt workout right after will really work the thigh & butt muscles. I've been doing that a few times a week now, and I've noticed my running has improved from it.",1236297600,5,1358,4.512195121951219

I usually do one of the warmups and then just switch the menu for each disc to the primary workout and try to do them all if I can. The music is fun and the setting is really nice because it kinda takes you away to the paradise of California.

2764189,4,B000NA78S4,"I bought ""ENVYGirls"" hesitantly.  I had previously been dupped into purchasing Carmen Electra's ""Aerobic Striptease"" DVD (from the same producers) expecting a fun but somewhat effective workout, and have never forgiven myself since! Nonetheless, the reviews that I read on Amazon convinced me to take a chance on this one.  And I am happy to say that I made the right decision!
This DVD is without doubt one of my favorite toning workouts.  Period.
First off, as evidenced by the packaging, the production is first-rate.  It is as clear and well-edited as any major Hollywood production, and the absolutely gorgeous island setting (South Pacific?? Carribean??) inspires me to work out even harder.  You can practically feel the breeze coming off the ocean! :-) The music is GREAT, hip and modern; I love it! It's so refreshing to actually work out to a good soundtrack instead of the generic dance club beat that is so prevalent in exercise videos.
The entire concept of ""ENVYGirls"" is that of a ""superteam of fitness"" (their words, not mine), each one with a particularly good body part.  Each girl then leads you through a 15-20 minute workout to help you get that particularly good body part. The parts are: Abs, Buns, Legs and Arms. There is an optional 4-min. warmup (it is the same on all four programs) and 5-min. express workouts for each program.
Make no mistake, this is not just an eye candy DVD a la Carmen Electra.  It actually is a pretty effective strength workout.  The moves are designed by celebrity trainer Michael Carson who is very knowledgable and inspiring but not drill sergeant-like (if you've ever seen ""The Biggest Loser,"" think Bob, not Jillian!).  Michael does a voiceover commentary on the warmup (as I preceeded this workout with cardio, I never really used the warmup) as well as a Trainer's Tips interview for each workout in which he guides you through correct form of some of the trickier exercises.  Also, don't miss the Trainer Commentary Option on which you can have Michael give a voice over on both the Primary Workout and the 5 Min. Workout.  He has a lot of important things to say, and don't worry, the music is still loud, and there is a repetition countdown on the screen, so you'll know how many reps you have left in a particular move!
ABS OF ENVY - My personal favorite!  I still pull this one out from time to time, and I've owned this for over a year.  When I initially viewed this program, I was skeptical because there are only a few crunches towards the end.  However, when I did it, it was challenging, I broke a sweat, and when I went to stretch my abs at the end, they burned quite a bit! It utilizes a lot of standing abs moves, but if you concentrate on using your abs, your belly will become sculpted and flat and your waist will be cinched, giving you that hourglass effect. Done almost entirely standing with a few minutes of floorwork.
BUNS OF ENVY - Uses various squats (love that Helicopter Squat!), Lunges, Reverse Lunges (called dips in The Firm) and other moves to effectively shape your glutes and thighs. Done mostly standing with some floorwork about three-quarters into the workout.
LEGS OF ENVY - Uses lunges, plies, plyo jumps and even balance moves to give you shapely thighs and calves. Done entirely standing with stretching on the floor at the very end.
ARMS OF ENVY - Uses bicep curls, hammer curls and some fun, creative moves such as the Dumbbell Catch and the Gecko Pushup to work your upper body. Done mostly standing with some push-up variations and floor tricep work towards the end.
And Now For The Bad:  The only real detriments that I could find: One- The packaging of the DVDs. Yes, plural. All four programs, unnecessarily, are recorded onto 4 separate DVDs.  For anyone who wished to combine workouts, it can be quite annoying to have to switch DVDs and then sit through minutes of exercise advisement/legal jargon/Lionsgate material. Two-The repetiveness of the exercises.  Though I found the exercises different and fun, each program actually contains about 7 minutes of moves that are repeated at least once halfway through. Depending on your attention span and the frequency with which you use this DVD, you may get bored quickly.
Three- The girls themselves.  Though I found them pleasant enough, it is obvious that these girls are not fitness professionals and were simply cast due to their looks.  Some viewers may find them a little Playboy-bunny-esque and not interesting.  I simply was inspired to attain their physiques! If they bother you, you could always choose the voiceover option by Michael , who IS a fitness professional, and a charismatic one at that.
All in all, I highly recommend this DVD and don't think anyone who wants a great body will be dissapointed.",1213574400,83,4769,4.771567436208992
2764190,2,B000NA78S4,This was a very boring video. I paid 30 dollars for junk. I mean i feel the burn and it's an ok video but i don't want to be there for 30 min. counting every second before it's over. don't waste you money.,1205884800,5,205,3.7906976744186047
2764191,4,B000NA78S4,"I've had this DVD for about eight months now, so I felt it was time to review it.

I was very excited to try out these workouts as they were designed by Michael Carson, the man behind Carmen Electra's Fit to Strip DVD, which is an amazing workout.

I thought this could only be better but sadly, it fell short due to a few flaws that just can't be ignored.

Firstly, the fact that the four workouts are on four DVD's. It would have been much easier and more logical to have placed all four workouts on one DVD. The packaging they come in is also rather cheap and one of the DVD's has the tendency to slide out and as a result has become scratched.

Next, there are some serious issues with the sound. Judging by the special features, the crashing waves on the background of their on-location Mexico shoot were very loud. So what did they do? Drown it out with music. That's fine, except they forgot to make the voices of the instructors louder as well. I have to turn my volume all the way up and it's still difficult to hear.

Then there's the picture, which inexplicably shows up in a box of blackscreen. Not widescreen format, but an entire box of black surrounding the picture. This is rectified by using the zoom button on my DVD's remote but I imagine if you didn't have a zoom button, this would be annoying. You have to rezoom every time you move from section to section as it is.

My next criticism is in regards to production. As I've stated, the workouts were shot on a beach in Mexico, which is beautiful (if unneccary). The bodies of the girls doing the DVD's are also beautiful, obviously BUT the cameracrew seems so taken by the beauty of the beach and the girls that they seems to focus on them instead of the exercises. Various camera angles from a distance make it difficult to see the form, random close-ups midway through an exercise; all unneccesary and irritating. This is very different from Fit to Strip where the camera stayed in pretty much the same position for the entirety of the workout.

Another disappointing difference between Fit to Strip and Envy Girls is that Michael Carson isn't leading the workouts, the girls are, and while he clearly taught them well in terms of form, they're not so adept at cueing and they all seem somewhat bored. You can change the voiceover track so that it's him talking, which I did at first. You can also see him explain proper form for some of the moves in the special features.

That being said, the main workouts themselves are excellent. All four areas (buns, abs, legs and arms) require one set of handweights and a mat.

The buns workout is paced well and you definitely feel it where you're meant to, as opposed to other buns workouts I've done where I'm struggling to make myself feel it in certain places. The standing and the matwork are on par with one another.

The abs workout is incredible. Lots of standing ab work, which is a nice change from most workouts of this kind. As I said before, you will use your handweights in each segment and the abs segment uses them a lot. Because of this, you get quite the arm workout which I feel somewhat detracts from the goal because you stop concentrating on your abs and start concentrating on your arms. My solution to this is to not use the weights and just make fists on certain exercises, namely the ones that involve holding the weights above your head, to give my arms a break. The matwork is good as well, though sometimes I just do the standing work and supplement the matwork with the Perfect Abs DVD. The girl leading this one definitely seems to be ""going through the motions"" and she has a rather dry delivery, which can be off-putting.

The legs workout, by contrast, has a very upbeat girl leading and because of this you forgive the fact that there are some repeat exercises from the buns workout. This segment seems to go by the fastest, for some reason.

The arms workout is a killer in that I have never been able to get all the way through it. Very intense. It's possible that it's just me but luckily, arms aren't a trouble spot for me so the fact that I can't do it all doesn't bother me. I do as much as I can. The girl leading this one is nice enough but there is one very distracting thing about her; her breasts. They are clearly not what Mother Nature gave her and so obviously so that when other members of the household have passed by the television as it's played, they have commented. Due to the aforementioned close-ups, they are not so easy to ignore.

Each segment begins with the same warm-up and while it's probably a good one, it's very difficult to follow because the camera won't stop moving around. Therefore, I don't use it and warm-up with something else before I start. The music on the warm-up as well as on the workouts themselves is rather blah and uninspiring so after going through it once or twice with the narration, I now watch it on mute with my own music. This works out best for me.

So, I have to take half a star off for all the technical issues and another half a star off for the slow pace. All in all, I think the workout themselves are good for their targets and you can easily integrate them with other routines. Hopefully, Michael Carson's next project will be less lacking.",1204416000,6,5257,4.428571428571429
2764192,2,B000NA78S4,"I bought this on sale at my local DVD store.  I have a Large Widescreen TV. the Workout Video only filled up a small square in the middle of the screen. Is this normal? thats why i only gave it 2 stars. Otherwise i would have rated it higher.

If anyone else has this dvd would you please comment, and let me know if yours is the same way? I'm wondering if i got a defective copy.  It doesn't seem like the manufactuer would make the screen small on purpose but who knows. Thanks :)",1201392000,,482,4.052631578947368
2764193,1,B000NA78S4,"Envy Girls looked like an effective and fun workout collection, but when I put in the first DVD I was highly unimpressed.  There is little to no energy put forth through the girls and I really have no desire to work out to it again. The other three dvds were just about as helpful as the first.  The only good work out in this series is when they do a slight bend at the knee and move weights back and forth doing a slight twist at the waist... but why spend so much money on four dvds for one effective move? If you want something that really works, is fun and full of energy, I suggest anything by Gilad.  His Total Body Sculpt DVDs are phenomenal.  I've been working out for an hour to his dvds for the past two weeks and I've already noticed a HUGE difference.  I've lost 3 inches and 2 pounds already, so I can officially praise and recommend Gilad's workout dvds.  His stuff is difficult but it does a body good.  Also, just a side note, the Envy Girls are actresses (look at the credits if you don't believe me).  One of them even works on The Simpsons.  Makes me wonder (not really) if they got such fantastic bodies by doing the simple workouts or by having personal trainers...",1200009600,9,1187,4.263392857142857
2764194,5,B000NA78S4,"I have so many fitness DVD's I've lost count, but am in great shape with a combination of running, pilates, and strength training. Was in the need for something fresh, and this DVD set was perfect!!! I was skeptical that it would simply be cute girls doing lame exercises, but after reading the initial good reviews, I purchased the set. All I can say is that I am absolutely (but happily) shocked at how good the workouts are!!! The ABS workout is handsdown one of the best I have ever done. You will be feel the effects after just one workout, and your waistline will shrink with all the oblique work and and twists. Plus, only the last 5 minutes or so is on the floor, a welcome change to an ab routine! Also, the 5 minute workouts on each DVD are fast and effective when you don't have much time, or feel like doing a little bit of each.",1189728000,4,841,4.2625
2764195,5,B000NA78S4,"I bought this not expecting too much because I've never heard of the Envy Girls and thought it would be as stupid as The Girls Next Door Workout, which I couldn't stomach (Bridget has to be the dumbest thing, some people should just be seen and not heard!)and thought that was joke. I sold it the next day...
So I had low expectations with this one because female eye candy does nothing for me but I was mistaken, this is a great workout dvd set. I love how they're separated into 4 body parts so I can mix and match and the exercises themselves were unique and I got fast results with them.

Very worth the money for the set, highly recommended!",1186444800,26,646,4.295081967213115

It's easy to do and really does give you the results it promises, and quick enough to fit it in between bottles and naps! I suggest combining this with HydroxyCut. The two combined has helped me lose 5 pounds just this week! One thing it doesn't tell you though: You also need weights and a yoga mat. I recommend 2lb. weights to start with, then move up to 5lbs. after 2 weeks or whenever you get used to it. Also, ankle weights will make it more challenging but aren't necessary.",1184544000,11,595,4.36936936936937
2764197,5,B000NA78S4,"This is a fun and challenging workout.  My girlfriends and I love it, and especially love doing it in a group.  You work out every part of the body during all of the exercises.  Arms, shoulders, and back are worked during abs, legs, and buns, because almost all the exercises are done holding a 5 lb weight.  I have dropped 10 pounds in a month doing this, the Women's Health Wedding Workout, Crunch Boot Camp, and the New York City Ballet Workout (great for lengthening and strengthening my new sylvette).

I am really feeling like an envy girl, and getting envious looks from other less motivated ladies.  These workouts are pretty hard core, but fun, and though the girls in them are a little gaudy, their bods are not.

Have fun!  And good luck!  If you are working out hard at least 3 times a week, the results will come!  Remember, if you want to maximize results, CUT OUT THE CARBS!",1183334400,10,889,4.46583850931677
2764198,2,B000NA78S4,"I use reviews to guide me through many of my purchases, and it has also led me to many fitness products that DON'T work. I should have known better when I looked on Amazon and another source, maybe two or three days after the DVD's release date, and saw the SAME review. Not only that, but it was positive and ""highly recommended the workout DVD"" without any cons. Also, look on this page. Look how similar the reviews about this DVD are, and note that the accounts only did one review and they are all from Los Angeles. Noticing all of this, was skeptical. Still, I ordered it.

The DVD wasn't what I expected. The warmup was good and the exercises weren't difficult but efficient, although I have not seen noticeable results yet. There's something about this workout that makes me not look forward to doing it, and I was trying to find a fun workout I liked.

Well, slick marketing skills, Envy Girls. You got my money and I'm slightly unsatisfied.",1182643200,24,950,4.517441860465116
2764199,3,B000NA78S4,"I would agree with the other reviews that the workout should be condensed into one disk rather than four separate ones. I found the ""buns"" section the more difficult of all featured areas. Overall it's a fairly decent workout, nothing outstanding. If you don't mind the ""cheesiness"" and the use of models posing as fitness instructors rather than actual trainers, then its fine. I would recommend buying the video on sale (even more).

8176518,5,B000NA78S4,5 stars because you get 4 workouts for a cheap price. Is it my favorite workout? No. But if you exercise 6x a week with dvds it can get monotonous if you do the same ones all the time. I like this set because some of the moves are different from the usual workout dvds. At the end my muscles are sore and I'm sweaty so it's working. Plus I like the ocean scenery. The cons are that the warm up audio quality is poor and the girls don't interact with the viewers. I'm glad I bought this and I use it about 3-5x a month.,1500595200,,518,3.8962264150943398
8176519,3,B000NA78S4,"After years of little sleep and less exercise, I suddenly found myself free of both child and parent care in a short space of time.  I got these exercise DVDs to help me get back in shape.  It was so bad when I started, that the 4 minute warm up was a cardio workout--without using the weights!  Well, these DVDs had easy enough routines that I could soon do most of what was on them, improved my cardio and my strength.
The spokesmodel ""instructors"" sound like valley girls, and I ignored the skimpy ensembles, and even the part about being envied.  Yawn.  There were some exercises that would have been better explained, even when using the instructor voice over.  But they did get me to where I could start doing Zumba and Pilates, which would have been way too hard for me to start out with.

If you're looking for an intense  and fun workout, this is not for you.  I was using 5-10 pound weights at the end, doing push-ups on my toes and so on and never breathed hard or broke a sweat even when it was 80 degrees. And frankly, the music was boringly repetitive. While I did gain strength, it didn't flatten my abs or tighten my upper arms.  Pilates and Zumba are doing a much better job at that.  I've given this DVD set to the thrift store.",1471824000,,1246,4.304721030042918
