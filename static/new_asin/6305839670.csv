7897017,4,6305839670,"Besides her great beauty, Brigitte Bardot is mostly known for her work & relationship with director Jean Luc Godard- and that might set some up for a dissapointment with this set. None of the films featured here approach ""Contempt"" or even her role in Roger Vadim's ""And God Created Woman"", these are basically cute French romantic comedies that are light, fluffy and full of sexual suggestion. For fans of the actress and fun films from the 60's, you'd really enjoy this set. I sat down to watch them without expectations (beyond having fun) and I wasn't dissapointed. It's sort of like seeing a lesser Marilyn Monroe film- it'll never be as satisfying as ""Some Like It Hot"", but it's still fun. Not to mention, Brigitte's carefree beauty and charm makes each of these very watchable.

The actually box set is a little flimsy, but will hold up on your shelf just fine if you take care of it. It's a very pretty blue box covered in stars with pin-ups of Ms. Bardot taken from the films. Highly recommended for fans of Brigitte (obviously!) silly romantic comedies, French films from the 1960's and collectors of classic and off-beat DVD sets. Don't go in expecting anything more than a good time, and you'll be sure to have one.",1150502400,9,1228,4.685185185185185
