364497,1,6301763041,Absolutely horrible pointless movie intended for dolts! I'm shocked that Johnny Depp was in it.,1517270400,,95,5.4

364500,1,6301763041,I can't believe what I got. I ordered this movie you watch on a Friday night and it's scratched a little bit and it won't play. It's worked a little before but now it won't work. It's skipping and I don't want to have to buy another copy. Plus the case was damaged too,1515110400,,268,3.9814814814814814

364538,1,6301763041,"As much as I'm a John Waters fan, I can't even pretend that this was fun. It was trying too hard to be campy and quirky. Yes, there's such a thing as too much camp and quirk. This was to the point where it was boring, and even painful. I mean, I get that it's John wanting it both ways: to be mainstream, and still be his trademarked self. And I'm glad that he finally went the mainstream route, but the problem with that is that John is and always was at his best in the arthouse scene. The mainstream can try and take the arthouse route, but it never really succeeds because plain and simply, it doesn't work. This wanted to be a Grease movie on acid, but it's too self-aware of how over the top it is, it just couldn't pull it off and the movie as a whole never took off. All the characters were basically parodies of themselves, but not in the way that they should have been. John Waters isn't known for plot, I don't mind that this didn't have a plot, but there was nothing about this that kept my interest. For being only an hour and a half, it felt like it went on FOREVER. Such a shame, because I think Cry-Baby could have been good, but it just wasn't. When a movie tries THIS hard, it's almost next to impossible for that to happen. Another thing that comes to mind is that, frankly, everything about Cry-Baby was embarrassing and screamed of desperation.",1513123200,,1365,4.253846153846154

364605,2,6301763041,"If you're moved to watch a decent film of this particular genre - watch ""Grease"", which is at least professionally done. This movie is cheaply and rather randomly presented: not funny but silly, not different but lame and quite badly acted - no talent involved. And even young Johnny Depp's awesome cuteness doesn't carry it off. It just plain stinks.",1505606400,,351,4.866666666666666

364740,5,6301763041,"This is probably one of John Waters tamest movies, so fans of HAIRSPRAY will find lots to enjoy here. For older viewers, the cameos are delightful and include Patty Hearst, Troy Donahue, Joey Heatherton, Joe DAllesandro, David Nelson as well as original Dreamlanders Mink Stole and Mary Vivian Pierce.

Spoofing the 1950s teenage delinquent films with a musical twist, CRY BABY satisfies on all levels, as a parody, a musical, an homage.

The Bonus Features give us some great interviews with the cast but Amy Locane seems to give off the vibe of being an outsider and not really wanting to be there, and Johnny Depp seems positively sedate.

Not one of my favorite Waters films (I prefer the earlier, trashy ones) but still a fun view that holds up on repeated viewings. This review is for the 2005 release by Universal.",1491696000,2,821,4.767605633802817

365225,4,6301763041,"Since the music industry pulled itself into the sewer--rap discs in hand--I've been desperate for new music discs that feature anything other than loud-mouthed idiots screaming out their angry, kindergarten-quality rhymes. What's worse is that the movie makers are following close behind. Here is music, and a movie, from the Golden Age of Rock--even if it is mostly an imitation of that music made to fit the movie. The best of the music is the authentic tracks from the era, but the rest is good, too. Neither the movie nor the soundtrack are ""great,"" but they are a refreshing break from contemporary noise like Jay-Z and Kanye and movie-manure like Straight Outta Compton. By the way, with new discs from Collective Soul, Def Leppard, The Scorpions, and Queensryche over the past year--all great--it looks like real rock may be back from the grave to drive a big stake into the heart of rap crap.",1457913600,,900,4.85064935064935

365340,5,6301763041,Johnny Depp does an excellent job in the lead role. Amy Locane and Tracii Lords are only two of the other amazing actresses who help make this movie one of my personal favorites. It's set in the obvious mid to late 50's where school kids were classified as Squares and others were classified as Drapes. A Square who is later classified as a Scrape (Part Square and part Drape) and a Drape go against all the boundaries and they break all the rules by falling in love.,1447372800,,467,4.379310344827586

Just a great, fun film with a silly but entertaining plot. Waters' great skill is capturing a moment in time and revealing it in all of its strange, funny, romantic and silly perfection (and imperfections). To be sure, Waters looks through rose-colored glasses, but he always errs on the side of humanity and humor and that is what makes him a genius.

But someone tell me, what has happened to him? Where did his movie career go? Come back John!",1438560000,,606,4.663551401869159

(I also am a midnight Rocky Horror and Buffy the Vampire Slayer sing along episode 'interactive film versions' to give you an idea of my film likes).

However I own the directors cut on DVD, I only bought this for the digital copy. If you previously watched the directors cut then you will notice that this version has screens missing and beeped out words in the court room scene. I was a little disappointed by this as the directors cut is the only one I had ever watched I didn't know there was an edited version. I still give it 5 stars as it is an awesome movie and Johnny Depp is such a hottie, but if your looking for the better version I'd say buy the directors cut.",1408060800,2,701,4.124087591240876

John Waters filled this musical comedy with characters played by Ricki Lake, Traci Lords, David Nelson, Patti Hurst, Troy Donahue, Mink Stole, Polly Bergen, Amy Locane and Iggy Pop.  Our quirky story takes place in 1950's Baltimore, at the beginning of Rock & Roll.  Depp's character is the Rebel Without A Cause caught in a Romeo & Juliet situation.  This underrated classic is always a fun watch...the soundtrack is finally available, too!",1398816000,,494,5.061728395061729
365863,5,6301763041,"A small and funny film shot in the late 1980s (1989-1990), at the end of Reagan's era and in the middle of George Bush Senior's regency, has no pretension except to debunk everything and everyone and make fun of a system that is as crooked as it is full of bigotry.

A remake of the Mods and the Rockers, of the Jets and the Sharks, the Montague and the Capulet, American sauce on top and whip cream to top it off and kick it up. But this multiple remake is so overloaded with clich&eacute;s and prejudices that it becomes hilarious and the objective is to make us laugh at those biases and other preconceived ideas about the other group, since the whole world is nothing but A versus B.

At the same time the film debunks fake education based on square ideas being the best in the world, on some clean type of dressing being the only decent, godlike and non-obscene way of dressing, all the rest, jeans and everything else, being nothing but homosexual showing off especially for girls who are supposed to wear decent dresses.

You add a love story in that viper nest and you have a real Romeo and a genuine Juliet. But the world must have changed because the judge is falling in love with Juliet's grandmother and he becomes sentimental and releases Romeo, alias Cry Baby. I must admit that the prison break is definitely as good as all those we were able to examine and/or supervise in the eponymous TV series. And do not forget that the best way to get out of trouble is to follow the rat. Rats are best to get out of the way, out of trouble and back to home security, I do not mean the security of your home.

The film is fabulous as for the music of the late 1950s, actually dated thanks to the evening prayer in the very special school for boys where the ""boys"" are supposed to thank Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon. That's cool indeed.

Be it only for the music the film is worth its eighty-two minutes, but the ""dancing"" and the performance of the actors, particularly the very young Johnny Depp is refreshing in this world where everything is nothing but special effect and make believe.

An excellent piece of dialogue alluding to the famous Unabomber who was definitely literate and had been avctive in the bombing business since 1978 at the time when the film was made.

Cry-Baby: That's right, Allison. My father was the ""Alphabet Bomber."" He may have been crazy, but he was my pop. Only one I ever had.
Allison: God. I heard about the Alphabet Bomber. Bombs exploding in the... in the airport and barber shop...
Cry-Baby: That's right. All in alphabetical order. Car wash... drug store... I used to lay in my crib and hear him scream in his sleep...""A,B,C,D,E,F,G... BOOM! BOOM!""
Allison: But your mom...
Cry-Baby: My mother tried to stop him. She couldn't even spell, for Christ's sake, but they fried her too.

Have one empathetic thought for this man who is in prison for life.

Surprisingly, the music was fantastic, though.  If I could give it 2 1/2 stars, I would.

366016,5,6301763041,"REVIEW:
Cry Baby  (1990)  Johnny Depp, Ricki Lake, Amy Locane, Susan Tyrrell
Rated PG13
Tagline: Good girls want him bad. Bad girls want him worse.

Evil genius John Waters,  that lovable, card carrying oddball director, has actually regurgitated a virtually squeaky clean but goofy musical satire for the ignorant masses. Unbelievable and one of my perennial favorites.
Lower your standards for an hour and a half and check it out.
So deliciously tacky it hurts.
So, what does this movie have exactly?
Well, let's see:
Bad taste galore.
Honeys painted up like trash.
Redneck hellcats.
Motorsickles, the kind your momma warned you about.
Juvenile delinquents who sing and dance.
Evil rock and roll.
Black leather.
Delightful degenerates
Colored people!
Grease was never greasier than this.
Johnny Depp is at his dreamiest (or so I've been told)
Oh, boy, being bad has never felt so good--or kinky.
Amy Locane is the quintessential 50's pony tail blond, and they don't come more mouth watering than her.
Puberty will never be the same.

366055,3,6301763041,"Cry-Baby (1990) is admittedly a very entertaining movie, designed
for the youth segment viewership. It is almost a musical from the
litany of talented musical performances and songs appearing throughout
the movie. It also is a very visual movie, thereby demonstrating the
remarkable skill of the actors, producer and director. i.e. the dialog
is almost redundant in enjoying this movie, as a result.

Humor is also very present  and welcomed  in this picture.
Johnny Depp's casting as a youth is a success, coupled with the lovely
Amy Locane who is his partner in this adventure. For those pulling a
blank like me about one other character, it's really the rocker Iggy Pop.

There are some surprising elements here, for horror fans too, as a
couple of actors play zombie-like people with bizarre attitudes.

Also, for the more sophisticated or adult in the crowd, there is the
intellectual appeal of the economic & class struggle shown in the
movie. i.e. Amy and Johnny are from different backgrounds, and each
family attends their own different stereotypical events, each typifying
mores, norms, values and behaviors that underline that fact, only here, in
this story, it's for laughs and to typify the absurd, but still
remaining real.

Coincidentally, this film was viewed for the first time the same weekend
(and again the next) that actress Susan Tyrrell passed from Hollywood.
RIP to an artist with a strong presence on the silver screen, in the same
style as Iggy Pop's.

Cngratulations to Hollywood and all artists for an artistic,
humourous and imaginary world that they were able to create over 90 minutes.

366056,3,6301763041,"This is a cross between ""Grease"" and every Elvis Presley movie ever made, but especially ""Jailhouse Rock.""

Johnny plays Cry-Baby Walker, an orphan raised by his grandmother (Susan Tyrrell) who deals in stolen car parts, after his parents were executed as the ""Alphabet Bombers."" He has a tattoo of an electric chair on his chest and freaks out at lightening. Grandma Ramona's boyfriend for the last ten years is Belvedere, played by Iggy Pop.

The good girl who goes bad for him is Allison Vernon-Williams, a rich kid raised by her way too proper grandmother (Polly Bergen), who runs a charm school where the motto is the four Bs: Beauty, Brains, Breeding and Bounty!

Of course, Allison has a square boyfriend that her grandmother does approve of, Baldwin by name (Stephen Mailer), who is a perfect ass, and not above vandalizing the Drapes (what juvenile delinquents were called in Baltimore in those days, for no discernible reason) cars and Cry-Baby's beautiful brand new motorcycle.

Cry-Baby's gang is also his rock 'n roll band, including his pregnant sister Pepper (Ricki Lane), Wanda the all-talk-and-no-show bad-girl blond (Traci Lords), Hatchet Face (Kim McGuire), who wears makeup you simply will not believe, and Hatchet's boyfriend Milton (Darren E. Burrows).

The other kids' parents are at least as outrageous in their ways as Ramona and Belvedere, and you may recognize some faces. Wanda's father and mother, the Wonder Bread squares, are played by David Nelson and Patricia Hearst! Hatchet's parents sell cigarettes in front of the school after hours, using all the cliche come-ons associated with selling grass in Reefer Madness. Milton's parents are evangelistic Christians; his mother (Joey Heatherton) even speaks in tongues!

366123,4,6301763041,"I would argue that the work of director John Waters and his Baltimore teen mania, circa 1955 type works are an acquired taste. And I have acquired the taste, having first gotten interested in his work through ""Hairspray"" that was revived on screen a couple of years ago. Of course, part of the draw is that the demographic territory that Waters surveys, circa 1955 teens, is very familiar turf to me. So when dear John spoofs a certain fashion, or a certain crowd, or a certain way of looking at things that were alien to the average teen back then he is giving off signals that I am attuned to. And that is the key; to know what is being spoofed, because the music is easy, very easy to figure out, the fight to get rock and roll to youth nation.

Of course, as is inevitable in a teen-based film, spoof or not, there is the central theme of sex. Here that theme centers on the orphan bad boy, Cry Baby played by Johnny Depp, who deep down inside really has a heart of gold matched up with an upscale orphan good girl, who deep down inside want to be bad. No, that last phrase won't work here, deep down wants to redeem Johnny-bad boy. Along the way to this inevitable happy-ending everything not nailed down gets spooked from 1950s suburban cookie cutter lifestyles to seemingly odd-ball teen fetishes like- French kissing and, oh no, the love of rock and roll. For my money the best spoof though, and it must have been hard to do with a straight face, are the musical performances of the quartet of pre-roll and rock teen singers(one, good/bad girl's beau, for a while) doing the cutesy songs made famous by male groups like The Letterman that were squeaky clean but upon hearing sounded like scratching on a chalk board. And, incidentally, drove me to blues, rock, and folk music in nothing flat.

Note: I haven't mentioned much about the performances here but for a long time now anything Johnny Depp appears in will get a look see, although it does not always turn out to be worthwhile. He has had a string of great roles, like in ""Ed Wood"", and some that it is better left unspoken like, ""Sweeney Todd"", but in this early film role (1990)as Cry Baby he gives a glimpse of why I will take a chance on any of his efforts. He does a beautiful parody of the James Dean/Elvis/Marlon Brando ""rebel without a cause"" style that the Cry Baby role called for.",1266710400,,2356,4.438799076212471
366124,5,6301763041,"Once upon a time there was a movie (or ""film"", since it takes itself very seriously), with a gay director and gay actors.
Gays were repressed and seen as unamerican aliens (especially by the House Committee...). They could understand and show the plight of women and minorities. James Whale had done just that in WATERLOO ROAD and ONE MORE RIVER. The master George Cukor had directed one of his masterpieces with THE MODEL AND THE MARRIAGE BROKER.It was an opportunity to show teenagers as strangers in their own country, treated as enemies, as gays were. Alas, it was all about whining, led by a cry baby, pretty long in his teenager tooth.
The adulterer cries that his wife doesn't understand him. The whining adolescents of the film whined that their parents didn't understand them.
I would call that family adultery by whining.
There was no real sens of alienation, except in a forced theatrical way.
35 years later, John Waters gives us a true masterpiece, which doesn't take itself seriously.
The situation is simple: no guilty parents. The society separates easily the upper and middle classes from the poor people.
The poor teenagers are juvenile delinquents by nature. They are very innocent here.
The action takes place in 1954, the same year that the notorious ""film"" was shot (released in 1955.
THE BLACKBOARD JUNGLE was published in 1954, the tame but very good film was released in 1955. THE JUNGLE KIDS, also by Evan Hunter was published as a Pocket books original in July 1956. It is a heart wrenching American masterpiece. A MATTER OF CONVICTION followed in 1959 (another very good film). they deal with teenagers becoming unwilling J.D.
The unexpensive DVD is a thing of joy: very good transfer for a very good cinematography and visual style. Waters wanting to recreate the saturated colors of the mid fifties (you can watch them in Paramount films,the Jerry Lewis movies if you are not prejudiced.
It's all about what makes youth so important: joy of living, dynamism, in a latter Mickey Rooney sort of way, invention.
The songs are exciting, the choreography is stirring. Everything is perfect.
An inspired casting idea is POLLY BERGEN, still looking great, as the rich, straitlaced at first, grandmother.
She didn't act in many movies but will be remembered for KISSES FOR MY PRESIDENT 1964 (unreleased in France) where she is elected as President of the US but soon sees her kids adrift, her husband without his firm. ""Fortunately"",she becomes pregnant and resigns.

Mr. Johnny Depp. Even though the movie has a stellar cast and even though it has a great story that's very funny and entertaining and even though Johnny Depp was the star of it, I never knew of this movie until very recently. Isn't that something.

""Cry-Baby"" was directed by g-a-y-as-a-goose director John Waters. John Waters' a genius because he knows how to mix just the right amount of satire, comedy, music and dramatics in each of his movies. IMHO ""Cry-Baby"" is his very best.

This is the main cast:
Johnny Depp ~ the coolest guy in the entire universe ~ Cry-Baby Walker
Amy Locane ~ otherwise known as Sandy Louise Harling to only her closest friends ~ Allison Vernon-Williams
Ms. Polly Bergen ~ Granny Vernon-Williams
Susan Tyrrell ~ Ramona Rickettes
Kim McGuire ~ Hatchet-Face
Ricki Lake ~ Pepper Walker
Traci Lords ~ Wanda Woodward

Johnny Depp was so adorable as Cry-Baby. He was like Jimmy Dean, Marlon Brando, Jason Priestley, Luke Perry and Jake Hanson all rolled up into a nice little package. I loved his character because as soon as you think he was serious all of a sudden he acted totally screwballish. And, that's how the entire movie was.

Generally, I do not watch musicals, but the songs in this were very good. My favorite was the last song that Cry-Baby ""sang."" He had his guitar and looked just like Ricky Nelson. So cute. The style of singing reminded me of something I'd hear at a Joe's Crab Shack. It was fast and fun and didn't have much rhyme or reason.

There were also so many funny parts. Ramona Rickettes (Pepper & Cry-Baby's granny) was just too much. She remined me of one of those old biker-babes who are just in this life to have a good time. Maybe that's because that's exactly what/who she was? Ricki Lake was hilarious. She looked like an elephant in a black leather coat who was in her 10th trimester. (Incidentally, isn't the name Pepper so laughable? It so sounds like a dog's name.) I also loved Hatchet-Face because she had a face that could bring a smile to anyone (picture a cross between Bea Arthur, Cyndi Lauper & Cindy Brady.) And I really liked the part with Traci Lords hitching a ride; and all of a sudden that weirdo from the beach pulls up.

Amy Locane was perfectly cast as the sweet and timid Allison. Wasn't she so incredibly attracted to Cry-Baby Walker? (Well, you know what they say, it's that forbidden fruit that tastes the sweetest.) The makeover that Pepper & Wanda gave her was sorta lame though. I pictured her in something much more far-out; like a pair of those ""hysterectomy pants"" that Ramona Rickettes had on.

I also really enjoyed Ms. Polly Bergen (who's in one of my favorite movies from the 60's, ""The Caretakers."") Her facial expressions and mannerisms were totally conducive to the prudish granny that she was playing. And it was so funny because all of a sudden she was for the Drapes. I didn't understand exactly how or why that sudden transformation occurred but with all screwballs the basic plot doesn't need to be understood.

My favorite part was when Cry-Baby and Allison kissed. To borrow the words of the brilliant businesswoman, Paris Hilton: that's hot. Johnny Depp's tongue looked absolutely delicious. And, you know what they say about cry babies with big tongues. I also liked how Cry-Baby's pants (conveniently) fell down as he was escaping from jail and his shirt also tore open to reveal Johnny's hot bod.

I really don't think Cry-Baby was anywhere close to being as evil as he tried to make others believe. He was just a misunderstood boy. He was just like Dorothy",1211760000,,3667,4.655332302936631

Basically it's one of those dumb musicals that you can't help but like because the music is good and the actors are wonderful -- even if their acting in the movie is bad. It's set in the 1950s in Baltimore, which is funny onto itself.

366255,4,6301763041,"This movie holds a special place for me. The fact that my grandpa in the 50's lived in Baltimore and he was a Drape! That man had alot of wild stories. Drapes as John Waters talks about was a gang in Maryland and term used for juvenile delinquints. Suffice to say I often wonder if John and my grandpa ever crossed paths. In fact the character Crybaby is alot like my grandpa he was white trash, he'd been to juvie, he rode a motorcycle, had a leather jacket and a greasy ducktail. He used to swipe cars and get into fights. He also was a musician with band called Rich Rocket and the Automobiles. It was a Rockabilly band he did a song called ""Shaking my Dice"" a euphemism for you know what, after watching a film warning about the solo act him and his buddies came up with this song as a joke. My Grandpa said they did a 45, the flip was a cover of Jerry Lee Lewis' ""Great Balls of Fire"" they pressed copies only for the band and after he died I looked all through the attic to find it to no avail I was pretty pissed and sad. His stories and bravado made me want to be a Drape and Rockabilly greaser.
Your probably wondering what this has to do with the movie. Alot, when I was a kid me and my grandpa watched this movie in theatres. He snuck me past my parents who wouldn't let me ever set eyes on a John Waters film. I had a good time and so did my grandpa. He thought the movie vulgar and little stupid because he had become a born again Christian but overall I saw that gleam in his eyes and he said it brought back memories. This movie is hilarious and some of the music in this film is really hokey and corny. The Rockabilly stuff is pretty good since Rockabilly veterans Dave Alvin and James Intveld worked on those numbers. Its pretty surreal and crazy overall it is a mind trip and a delightful one. My grandpa if he was alive would recommend this movie. The DVD has interviews with John Waters, the cast and crew. Waters talks in length about the real Drapes which I found interesting and there is commentary. Some of the musical numbers could've been done a little better, but all in all as my grandfather said after leaving the theater with a smile on his face: ""Swell, pretty swell.""",1180569600,,2199,4.213270142180095
366256,3,6301763041,"Even though Cry Baby is an above-average comedy movie, the thing is, more often than not the storyline is more *silly* than it is actually funny.  Johnny Depp's character was pretty good, but he wasn't as much of a bad guy or rebel as you'd believe.  Just because he goes around driving a motorcycle and taking a few punches in the face doesn't mean he's a believable bad guy.  His character was lacking in that area, in my opinion.

I also felt that the grandmother of his girlfriend (the GOOD girl who sings happy 50's-style rock tunes, instead of the more loud and outrageous Elvis Presley-like rockers intended for the troublemakers) wasn't entirely in character for the majority of the film.  I mean, she tried so hard to flat out HATE teenagers who rebel against their parents to the point where she actually stood up to a crowd and mentions how she will not be brought down by them.  But then, a short time later when Depp showed up to her granddaughter's musical thing in a motorcycle, for some reason the grandmother forgot that she was supposed to strongly dislike teens who rebel and didn't mind at all that her granddaughter opted to drive away with Depp.  Strange.

The musical parts were okay, but most of them were 50's style rockers.  You know how the music sounds.  No need to elaborate on that.

A pretty decent movie with a few flaws in the way.  Pick up some of Depp's other superior movies, such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or Secret Window.",1179878400,,1471,4.572519083969466
366257,4,6301763041,"Cry-Baby is a hilarious, campy musical that pokes fun at some classic musicals. The movie takes place in Baltimore and is named after its main character Wade Walker (Johnny Depp) who is nicknamed Cry-Baby because of the single tear he's able to shed at will. This unique ability and his devilish good looks drive the ladies wild. He even has Cry-Baby tattooed on his arm under Depp's real Cherokee chief head tattoo and scripted across the back of his leather jacket.

Cry-Baby is a drape, a leather wearing, motor cycling bad boy who hangs with a bunch of other drapes made of up of his pregnant sister Pepper (Ricki Lake), Hatchet-Face girl (Kim McGuire), Wanda Woodward (Traci Lords), and Milton Hackett (Darren E. Burrows); all delinquents in their own right.

One day one of the ""square"" girls takes notice of Cry-Baby. Allison (Amy Locane) decides she doesn't want to be so good anymore and encourages Cry-Baby's advances. Cry-Baby crashes a square party and takes Allison for a ride on his bike back to the drapes hang-out where his troupe gives her a makeover reminiscent of Sandy in Grease. They sing a duet together and there's a memorable make out scene with everyone wet French-kissing. Cry-Baby teaches Allison the basics of how to French Kiss (""Kiss Me, kiss me hard"") which was both sexy and pee your pants funny. Everyone is interrupted when Allison's jilted boyfriend and his gaggle of goons pay a visit and set Cry-Baby's motorcycle on fire. A fight breaks out, the police show up and Cry-Baby is arrested and sent to a detention center until he's 21. There are some songbirds singing in jail reminiscent of Elvis Presley's Jailhouse Rock but perhaps less choreographed. But bars, conniving girls and angry mothers can't separate Cry-Baby from his true love for long.

Acting wise it is really hard to judge. Everyone was over acting to make a point and these roles are really tongue-in-cheek. As far as I'm concerned this film proves Johnny Depp can do just about anything and still be sexy. Johnny already had a huge following with his success in 21 Jump Street. As for fat girl, Ricki Lake, this came after Babycakes and Hairspray which I think were better roles for her. It looks like she's sporting a pregnant breasts and tummy body suit for her role. I didn't notice any fat stereotypes. She already has two illegitimate kids and gets just as much make-out time as any of the other characters. Even the somewhat deformed Hatchet Face girl gets a lot of action. Special appearances by Willem Dafoe (Batman) as a mean guard and rock star Iggy Pop as Uncle Belvedere round off the cast.

Cry-Baby was written and directed by John Walters who is also the writer and director of the Hairspray musical. You really have to have an open mind for comedy to enjoy this film. I thought it was hilarious, going in with the perspective of not taking it seriously. There are a lot of great one-liners. Would it be on my favorite movie list? Probably not, but I'd watch it again and recommend seeing it at least once. Reviewed by M.E. Wood.",1179878400,,3049,4.725563909774436

""Cry Baby"" is a 1990 musical that is utterly silly and frothy, but works nevertheless. Johnny Depp, now a big box office draw and critical success with Oscar nominations for ""Finding Neverland"" & ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" can be proud of the rockabilly Elvis-type singer he plays named Wade ""Cry Baby"" Walker. Depp performs his ""Jailhouse Rock"" type number with great energy and rebellion. Having him run through sewage pipes in his underwear is enough to set many a teenage girl's hearts aflutter. The female lead is Allison played by Amy Locane who worked in other films like ""Airhead,"" ""The Mummy"" & ""Bongwater."" She does a good Olivia Newton John-like ""Grease"" character of the square girl who has a crush on Depp's bad boy. Stephen E. Miller who was recently seen in ""RV"" with Robin Williams and previously in ""The Accused"" with Jody Foster does a good job as the square boyfriend Baldwin who loses his girl to Cry Baby.

The supporting cast also frolics and froths with Ricki Lake as sister Pepper who is intensely pregnant. Iggy Pop plays the daddy Belevedere and takes a scrub bath in a tub sudsing up favorite parts of his anatomy with gusto. Traci Lords who was an adult film star plays Wanda to the hilt. The deleted scene where she sits in an oversized champagne glass while other hotties romp nearby is way over the top. Kim McGuire plays the character Hatchet Face with a permanent mug. Susan Tyrell who actually was nominated for an Oscar in 1972 for ""Fat City"" plays the biker matriarch Ramona. She recently appeared with Bob Dylan in the film ""Masked & Anonymous."" Polly Bergen does a nice job as Mrs. Vernon Williams, Allison's grandmother, who emphasizes propriety but encourages her granddaughter to follow her heart.

Though this movie has been silently looked over by most of the general public, it is a wonderful gem of a film. John Waters managed to make two great musical comedies from around the period of 1988-1990 - Cry Baby and Hairspray. I first watched both movies when I was 4 years old (this was probably right when the movies were released to video sometime in 1990 or 1991) and now I'm 20 and still love them. I remember going to a party when I was 4 and met Ricki Lake. My mom told me that I followed Ricki Lake around the whole party talking about Cry Baby and Hairspray, and she was very surprised and thought it was cute at the same time. It's cool to read that other kids (even younger than me) have taken a liking to this great film. I can't believe it's now on dvd.. I had no idea until just before writing this review! Hooray!

366394,5,6301763041,"There are two movies that people who don't know John Waters and the types of films he normally makes always love.  Cry Baby and Hairspray contain both John Water's sense of humor and style, but don't necessarily dig into the depths of depravity (like eating dog poo) some of his more subversive films do.  I'm not a John Waters aficionado yet, but what I've noticed in his films is that they normally center around two opposite sides that will eventually come crashing into one another.  From Hairspray to A Dirty Shame, the films do a great job of putting two sides in direct opposition to each other and then letting the fur fly.

Cry Baby is no different.  In this case, the Drapes and the Squares square off (pun not-intended) with Johnny Depp's Wade and Amy Locane's Allison at the center.  Basically a love story that draws on the same dichotomous split seen in Romeo and Juliet, you have the poor and rowdy meet the rich and on the surface proper.  What follows is a funny and zany ride as the two sides end up colliding in a winner-take-all car chase.

The writing is sharp as is the directing.  What I admire about Waters the most is his ability to create vivid characters with personality.  Sometimes he relies heavily on stereotypes, but each character is his or her own.  You won't ever confuse them.  They stay sharp, even when the acting isn't exactly stellar.  The acting, like a majority of John Water's films, is spotty.  Its done in an over-the-top sort of way that you can't help but laugh at.  It reminds you that this isn't real and that you shouldn't take it seriously.  Water's employs not only great upcoming talent (like Depp) but also people like Hatchet Face who haven't been seen much in film since.  All do a great job playing their roles; however, not all of them are good actors.

Once you look past this minor speed bump, the ride is hillarious.  It, along with Hairspray, is probably the most accessible of John Water's films.  It maintains his sharp satirical writing and funny dialogue, but keeps the humor bawdy but not excessive.",1128384000,33,2066,4.608219178082192

All of the actors gave stunning preformances and the rolls seemed to be tailor made to each of them. A better cast couldn't have been assembled if you tried.

Are there a few stereotypes? Yes. Is the plot predictable? Oh yeah. But it's also a fun movie that I would recommend you see at least once in your life. It's like a less serious version of Grease.

1) fans of Johnny Depp...if you consider yourself a true Johnny Depp fan, then you HAVE to see this movie. You won't regret it.

2) fans of Grease (although this movie is more of a satire of the 50s)

3) anyone who loves great music!

This movie will have you up out of your chair singing and dancing!! The music by far is the best part (besides Johnny). My favorite is the sultry ""Please, Mr. Jailer."" You'll be singing it all day. In addition to all the awesome songs, there's romance, action, comedy, and a bunch of kids who love bein bad cuz it sure feels good!

The plot of this movie is basically the Squares (good kids) versus the Drapes (bad kids). Allison is a square, but she can't help but have feelings for the ultra-cool, ultra-hip, ultra-adorable Cry Baby Walker (Johnny), who is known for his ability to cry one single teardrop. Allison finds herself having a wonderful time with Cry Baby and his gang (Hatchet-Face is my favorite character...you have to see her to believe it), but the other Squares can't stand to see Allison become a Drape. This leads to the ultimate battle between the nerds and the cool kids. Later Cry Baby winds up in jail...can Allison convince the judge that he is innocent?

You'll have to buy it to find out. So, if you're 15 or older (it does include the F word, and a LOT of intense and sloppy tongue-kissing), you LOVE Johnny Depp, you love great 50s music, or you just adore having fun, then this movie is undoubtedly for you.",1126569600,5,1675,4.4397394136807815

Here are a few highlights that tickle me to death:

  -Patty Hearst plays Traci Lord's mother. How deliciously bad can you get?

  -Great original songs include:

  Cry Baby

  King Cry Baby

  Doin' Time for Being Young (on my top 10 list for best rock song ever - best title for sure)

  Please Mr. Jailer (won't you let my man go free?) - probably no. 1 on my list for best rock song ever. Well, OK, ""Like a Rolling Stone"" by Bob Dylan has it beat, but just barely.

  -Some quotes (there are way too many to write them all here):

  ""I want to let you, Cry Baby, but I can't for my parents' sake. They're both dead.""

  ""One single solitary tear is all They'll ever suck out of this Cry Baby.""

  ""You mean you swapped me for a milk-maid?"" - Traci Lords to her parents

  ""Cry Baby, you're rehabilitated now. Here's $2.50 and a pair of clean underwear."" - the Judge to Cry Baby

  ""Tight slacks - hysterectomy pants, I call them.""

  ""This is only a drill, there are actually no Atom Bombs being dropped.""

  ""Oh Wanda, you sure is pretty, in them tight clothes all painted up like trash."" - grandma Ramona Rickets to Traci Lords.

This movie actually mocks the campiness of musicals in a light-hearted and humorous way.  The music itself is rockabilly, a mix of early rock and country.  The story takes place in Baltimore in the 1950's.  Johnny Depp plays Wade ""Cry-Baby"" walker, a Drape (Baltimore's version of a Greaser) and lead singer/ guitarist of a rockabilly band.  Cry-Baby and a Square named Allison, played by Amy Locane, fall in love.  The problem is that Allison already has a boyfriend.  Like Allison, her boyfriend is a Square and becomes very jealous of Cry-Baby.  Of course, the inevitable happens: the two classes of people, the Drapes and Squares, wind up fighting.  Do Cry-Baby and Allison wind up together?  You'll have to watch the movie to find out!  You should also check out the bonus features, which include the following: ""It Came From Baltimore"" (commentary from the director John Waters and the cast), optional commentary during the movie by John Waters, and deleted scenes.  Caution to those who care about ratings: the ""F"" word is mentioned three times in non-sexual ways.  There is also a lot of sexual humor, such as a scene in which couples are shown so closely that you can see all the moves they make with their tongues.  In other words, this movie barely squeeked by with a PG-13 rating.  Young teens might have a lot of questions about behavior and slang terms...  The bonus features are definitely ""R"" rated.

Like myself, who knows every line word-for-word, I of course found myself getting tongue tied and silent on parts that were new to me for the first time. Things started to make sense to me with the included scenes, for instance what seemed to be out-of-place scenes of the sleezy Kojo character, or the infamous courtroom scene where the ""F"" word is bleeped out repeatedly (not in this version friends!).  Mysteries like this and much more are revealed through the indepth ""It Came From Baltimore"" featurette.

Or what about that classic pic on the back of your VHS cover of Wanda (Tracey Lords) seductively lying in a large champagne glass that you never saw in the original?  And just what does the cast look like almost 15 years later?  Loads of deleted scenes and extras make this worth the wait for anyone who has grown to love this cult classic.

  What we did not anticipate was the endless laughter and joy we found while watching this movie. The satirical element of it is hilarious, and the music is amazing! We found ourselves walking around quoting the movie, and showing it to all of our friends. The cast is perfect for their roles, and the plot is so far fetched that it all fits together.

  Some of the lines from the movie are similar to those of Napoleon Dynamite....so hilarious you can't believe it just happened....and then you find yourself quoting it all the time.!

My problem with this Director's Cut is, just like the new Coyote Ugly disc, I don't mind the extra scsnes being put back in, but they seemed sort of shoved into the film as opposed to being integrated into it. Also, some of the ne shots and lines truly disrupt the pace of the scene and call attention to themselves as opposed to merely fleshing out the scene more.

The best scene added to was the courtroom scene with more of the parents that helped clarify alot of things, including the imfamous F word joke.

So, all in all, some of it really works and other things kinda muck it all up and that is upsetting.

But in you do get a great Waters commentary and a 45 minute retrospective and those always a blast.

I guess my disappointment lies with the fact that I'm going to have to keep my VHS copy of this film too, as opposed to other director's cuts when I can give the original VHS to friends or sell it on ebay.",1122508800,4,1124,4.137614678899083

The DVD version is awesome with 6 minutes of extra footage and some nice features including commentary and a ""Making of"" featurette.  The video quality is good and the audio is great, with the scenes with music obviously having some updating because the singing sounds more powerful than in the video version.  Some mentioned that the synching seemed off, but I did not notice that on my version.  The extra footage is great too.  I just love this movie and have probably watched it 30 times or more.  I can almost quote it line for line, yet it still never fails to make me laugh like crazy and sing along with the music.  About the only thing I wish is that there was a scene with Allison kicking Lenora's psycho (...).  LOL.

One correction to a previous reviewer.  NOTHING has been cut from this version at all.  Its obvious that reviewer has only seen the TV version  and not the true movie version, because the scene she mentions is only shown on TV and never appeared in the VHS version (which I have watched at least 30 times).  While the extra footage does include some of the stuff that gets added on the broadcast version, it is NOT the broadcast version and does not include all of them (which is probably good because some of those broadcast scenes were silly and the sing off one felt out of place when I watched the movie on TV).  The extra scenes that have been added actually help clarify some things (especially  Grandmother Baldwin's seeming overnight reversal of opinion on Cry-Baby) and further highlight some of the social issues/customs back then (like air raids, discouragement for ""good"" kids to hang out with blacks, rock music = bad people, etc).

I highly recommend getting this DVD version.  If you already have the VHS version, give it to a friend and convert them to the Cry-Baby fandum. :-D  And don't forget the soundtrack so you can sing along in the car!",1121990400,5,1978,4.53954802259887

I have been a fan of John Waters since the ripe young age of 8 when I first saw Polyesther, much to my mothers dismay. I got to see Hairspray for my 13th birthday, and well then she began to understand. So the release of Cry Baby on DVD was huge event in my life, being just one week after my 30th birthday, I can say I have loved this man's mind for almost a lifetime. I used to try to tape this version off of USA's Up All Night, and later TIVO it from of all channels the WE channel. But commercial's NO MORE!! Not to mention, ""It came from Baltimore"" is an excellent documantary, one to watched many times, as you see and hear such idols as Van Smith and Pat Moran discuss details of the film and Dreamland and so much more.

Johnny Depp and the amazing supporting cast continue to delight in their performances, and the silliness with the great songs is as fun as ever.

BUT...man, I'm not usually one of those people who get hung up on picture/sound quality, but there were some egregious sound problems that made me wince.  Several of the songs were ""miked"" strangely causing problems created with the mix of the back-up vocals.  ""Doin' Time for Being Young"" especially loses its punch with the strangely loud back-up singers overpowering the instruments and the lead vocals.  In fact, it sounds like ONE guy is just not blending in with the rest but for some reason was given the mike.  This is a problem I've never encountered on the VHS copy, the soundtrack, or the cable version.  Similar sound problems plague ""Please, Mr. Jailer"" causing some of the back-ups to be lost this time, and the lead so overly amped that the lip-synching is completely obvious, whereas previous versions upheld the illusion very well that both Amy Locane and Johnny Depp were actually singing.

It's probably a minor thing to most people, but it was sad to have an otherwise enjoyable trip down Memory Lane marred by some questionable choices in sound transfer and remixing.

Not only is this 1990 John Water's comedy funny and clever, but it features a young Johnny Depp doing his take on an elvis-look alike teen in the 1950's.

This heartwarming story is about the battle between the squares (rich preps) and the drapes (the motorcycle riding types), and the two that got caught in the middle. These two happen to be a boy named Wade ""Crybaby"" Walker, nicknamed for his ability to cry on command, and Alison Vernon-Williams, a rebel who just happens to be the daughter of one of the richest families in town.

Despite its drama-like plot, John Waters does a fantastic job of creating a friendly, happy-go-lucky atmosphere that sucks you in and doesn't let you out. It's a cheesy film with acting that is a little less than professional, however, but the fantastic soundtrack makes up for it.

366548,5,6301763041,"I'm really excited to see this great film finally make its debut on dvd; it's been a long wait.

John Waters has proven himself time and time again as America's avatar of bad taste and all things tacky, but he sidelined his more base urges for a greater good over a decade ago. Starting with Hairspray, Waters essentially re-created the American musical, and honed that to perfection with the castly underappreciated Cry-Baby. But it's not just a musical - it's also a heartfelt valentine to a simpler time, his beloved Baltimore of the late 1950's.

Depp stars as ""Cry-Baby"" Walker, a juvenile delinquent from the wrong side of the tracks who spends his time hanging with his gang and singing that evil rock n' roll music. He and his way of life are constantly threatened by the town 'Squares' who are both threatened and repelled by Cry-Baby and those like him.

Naturally, he falls for a Square girl and all hell breaks loose. That part of it is a simple story, and I won't waste time rehashing or giving it away here. No, what really stands out about this film is its gleeful embrace of 'white-trash culture,' its loving tribute to the great juvenile delinquent movies of the 50's and 60's, and its rambunctious energy.

As usual, Waters peppers the film with eclectic casting; Susan Tyrell, Iggy Pop, Ricki Lake, Mink Stole, Joe Dalessandro, Willem Dafoe, David Nelson (son of Ozzie), Traci Lords and Patty Hearst (yes, that Patty Hearst) are just a few of the many talents that form this wonderful ensemble cast. And of course, it's another one of Depp's great iconoclastic roles that have helped define him as one of the great idiosyncratic actors of our time.

So grab yourself an RC Cola, a Moon Pie, and put yer teeth up on the windowsill while y'all enjoy this trashy good time. You'll thank me for it and if y'all don't like it, I'll eat me a bug.",1116806400,95,1859,4.621212121212121

Cry-Baby, is the greatest example of this, as it is by far the worst film in a list of films by perhaps the most overrated director I have ever come across.  Cry-Baby is not goofy, it is not fun, it is not silly, it is not camp, it is simply a terrible terrible movie.  The acting is abysmal, and I like Johnny Depp.  The story is extremely terrible, and the overall production exemplifies my point: there is no such thing as so bad it is good.  Laughing at a film (as opposed to laughing with a film) for it's low brow style cheesiness doesn't make the film funny.  This movie seriouly belongs on a MST3K style lampoon, but instead people revel in it for what I can only assume is a sensation that they are suppose to like John Waters.  I had a similar sensation when watching Pecker, the other supposed great Waters flick.

366553,4,6301763041,"To enjoy and love ""Crybaby"" as much as I do, you need to have an appreciation of John Waters' strange, tacky, and very tongue-and-cheek approach to film making. Anyone who sits down to a Waters' film and takes it seriously is missing the point.  His films are meant to be cheesy and ridiculous because they are, in his own way, attempts at social and cinematic commentary.  ""Crybaby's"" silly songs, groanable dialogue, and off-the-wall characters are intential - they are both mocking and emmulating a world that Waters wishes he could have been a part of.

Of course, you don't have to worry about looking for the deeper meanings in a John Waters film - another reason they're so much fun to watch. You can just sit back and laugh.",1114214400,,732,4.658914728682171

366648,4,6301763041,"Cry Baby's finally out on DVD! Yeh!!! It's taken me quite a while to get - something more important always came along - but then it came out at work, for pretty cheap. I snatched it up instantly. I had this on video (taped off the TV) for ages, and also an illegal copy, and I loved it. It's such a feel good movie, and of course Johnny Depp is easy on the eyes.

Cry-Baby was made in 1990, or was at least released then, featuring a very clean cut, and very young Johnny Depp. John Waters has basically tried to do a cheaper version of Grease, cos it's set in the same period. (A lot seems to be borrowed from Elvis movies too - and Johnny's singing is a take off of Elvis, with the whole hip swinging, oh, I'm off drooling again). The first half is very much in the same Grease-style, but kinda loses it towards the end.

There's some familiar faces in this, including Ricki Lake (looking very big, before she hit the big time as a chat show host, and a John Waters regular), Traci Lords (ex adult film actress, so one for the guys to check out), Iggy Pop, and a blink and you'll miss it prison guard role played by none other than Willem Defoe! Hehe, I never manage to spot him properly, until I watch the credits. I'm used to seeing him with long hair (Speed 2), so it's hard to spot him.

Most of the acting is seriously overacted most of the time, just watching the acting is hilarious. But this film is definitely a must see for Johnny Depp fans. He's so HOT in this movie! And he reminds me of someone, so it's always a must for to watch it, and blush constantly. I blushed rewatching it, cos I actually learned how to french kiss from this film - embarassing I know - and I have since tried it out. It seems to work out quite well.

The music is a total spoof of all those kind of fifties movies. But it's very memorable - as well as the dance moves! (I'm one of these people who seems to memorise dance moves, never mind the words to songs!) What's my favourite song? Probably ""Please Mr Jailer"", or ""Teardrops Are Falling"".

What's my favourite scene? It has to be either Johnny Depp tugging on his crotch after getting off his motorbike, or when he's trying to get out of the jail, and loses his trousers!

There's quite a few scenes added into the director's cut, and I applaud John Waters for this, although I'm disappointed there wasn't more of a back story to Hatchetface - what was with her? There's not MUCH more scenes added in time wise but the die hard Cry Baby fans out there will spot very easily, the 6 extras minutes added in. And it's not 6 minutes of nothing either! I kept going during the film ""That's new! I haven't seen that before!"" It's mainly the first half of the film that gets the extra scenes, but judging by some other reviews, there's some stuff cut OUT too, but I haven't watched my illegal copy since I added this to my wishlist. Extra scenes include: Hatchetface's parents selling cigarettes by the school (""You still owe me from yesterday!); Lenora's ""gunboats"" are now ""goldmines""; the third verse of Allison's song, ""Teenage Prayer,"" is included (not that it makes much difference); extra footage of Cry-Baby driving his motorcycle to the charm school and an air raid drill that interupts Allison's act (strange); Cry-Baby arrives during ""So Young"" instead of before the song beginning, as in video version; there is a longer scene with Wanda, her parents, and Inga, the Swedish exchange student; and the showdown is at Turkey Point instead of at the press conference in front of the prison.

This film is a classic to add to anyone's collection. It's definitely going to be the main feature in mine - just try and stop me from playing it all the time! I don't understand why people slate it, as some reviewers have, it's easy going fun, and definitely leaves me on a high.",1083888000,,3819,4.393210749646393

They were ""old-school,"" yet they posessed enough up to date stars and character traits to hold the interest of the young and the older generations.  I personally remember watching Crybaby with my mom on several occassions when I was younger.

This picture is a startlingly well-executed spoof on those dreadful Elvis movies which we love to hate. Johnny Depp has got the sneer and swagger down pat, and is backed up by a zany array of grotesque suburbanites lovable degenerates. The music is flat brilliant, as is the exuberantly over-the-top choreography (particularly Johnny Depp's in-prison numbers). The lineup of actors runs the gamut from Iggy Pop to Ricki Lake to Traci Lords to SLA darling Patricia Hearst! The dialogue and character development is toe-curling bad, as are fair-sized chunks of the cinematography. But then, Waters had to throw some of his trademarks into this otherwise sweet and practically squeaky clean film. Wrongfully rejected by many hardcore Waters-heads, Cry-Baby (like Hairspray) is a step into more conventional territory for the Baltimore auteur, but still has some of the outrageousness for the benefit of folks without the stomach for his trash masterpieces like Desperate Living or Pink Flamingos.

366826,5,6301763041,i'm just gonna come right out and say it...i love this movie...i have watched it since i was little and my cousin watched it all the time...people tend to say that it's stupid. but the truth is...it's actually a great movie..they used Depp because he has that James Dean look to him...and even though some people don't believe it...THIS MOVIE HAS A PLOT!it's a semi-realistic look on how things went back then...and i am told that by my friends grandfather..who loves this movie by the way...so in conclusion..i'm just gonna say this...if you don't like the movie..that's ok just don't mess it up for the rest of us with your bad remarks...if you do like it..then you have my mark...- jenks,1036627200,4,690,4.710743801652892
366827,5,6301763041,"This movie is one of the funniest and wittiest movies I have seen.  Yes it is silly, maybe dumb in some parts, but every once in awhile you need a movie like this to remind us not to take life so seriously!  Johnny Depp is beautiful and fabulous in this movie as well as the rest of the cast, including the gorgeous and talented Amy Locane.  Its one of those movies you can watch again and again, learn the words and sing along!
So if you haven't seen it yet, expect the unexpected like you would from any John Waters movie, but also be prepared to laugh and feel for the characters!",1034467200,,583,4.1875
366828,5,6301763041,"I love this movie. It is a good movie for teenagers and older.
I have been watching this movie from like 4 years old. The actors in this movie are great for their parts. It is good because they show how different people can be, and how they react to others. What i like about this movie is, these two teenagers who one is bad boy and the other is a good girl who like each other but people don't like that they are together because they are different.  Its kind of romantic.  It shows u that u don't have to be the same to like someone. I think is was a great movie and johnny deep looks soo cute when he is young.",1033776000,,614,3.943548387096774
366829,5,6301763041,"CryBaby is a clever satire with everything that a movie should have. Let's face it, every girl wants to be fought over by two hot guys (especially if one is Johnny Depp). The script is witty, the songs are amazing, and the acting is outstanding. I could watch this movie every day for the rest of my life without getting sick of it. I find myself singing the catchy songs around the house. CryBaby takes an ordinary storyline of the good girl falling for the bad boy, and spices it up with music, dancing, and interesting sub-plots. The contrast between the ""squares"" and the ""drapes"" (the good girls and boys and the rebels) is hysterical; everything in the movie is hysterical. CryBaby is destined to become a classic.",1019260800,16,720,4.6328125
366830,5,6301763041,This is a great movie. The music numbers are so esoteric as is the entire film. Johnny Depp was made for this movie. When you think about it: how could any movie with Johnny Depp and Troy Donahue be bad? Just try to be a little more understanding about this film. It is more than just camp. This is a true look at society through the eyes of John Waters. Insightful.,1007251200,,366,4.169014084507042
366831,5,6301763041,"Crybaby is one of my favorites movies, and one that any John Waters lover should see.  Being that this movie is one of Waters, Crybaby may not be the best of his work, but it is far more entertaining and funny than Hairspray or Pink Flamingos.  The purposely over-dramatization and cheddar-cheesiness completely makes the movie.  The music is brilliant too.  Please take one look at Hatchet Face and just try not to laugh--it's not possible.  This is one of the best made and directed movies of all time.  If you enjoy zany comedy and the fusion of past and present, please watch Crybaby.",1005177600,,588,4.660194174757281
366832,4,6301763041,"Johnny Depp is smokin' hot in this John Waters film as Crybaby, a motorcycle ridin' bad boy of the greaser-elvis-rockabilly variety who sheds a single tear and makes all the girls swooooon. Crybaby is leader of the ""drape"" gang, which includes feisty sis Ricki Lake, who's ""so happy all knocked-up"". He has his sights set on local ""square"" Allison, who's tired of being a good girl. Traci Lords is great as a big-busted slutty drape trollop with an attitude. Iggy Pop (bow down to the father of punk) plays crybaby's redneck uncle, who's MIGHTY close with Grandma, if you catch my drift. hee-hee!
Oh, and don't miss seeing Hatchetface (gee, why do they call her that?...)
please note: for repeated viewings, i recommend having the remote handy, thumb poised over the mute button. You can only suffer through the likes of ""king crybaby"" and ""tear drops are falling"" so many times.

I don't understand  why people didn't like the movie and I think the one-star should be  strapped to a chair and forced to watch it over and over, [that would be  really cool for me].
