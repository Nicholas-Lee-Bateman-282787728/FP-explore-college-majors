8723847,2,B0118S6W9U,"I suppose we're lucky that any copy exists of this long-thought-lost D.W. Griffith/Lillian Gish film from 1919.  The video quality is abysmal.  Alpha Video, Grapevine and other such companies seem to specialize in selling poor-looking public domain copies of scarce films.  It's a business, I suppose.  What is hard to forgive is the atrocious musical soundtrack attached to Alpha Video's version of A ROMANCE OF HAPPY VALLEY.  The uncredited score is a repetitious and frequently inappropriate melange of classical and other pieces.  If you buy this video to watch the wonderful Lillian--although her usual luminousness is hard to see in a video of such poor quality--turn off the soundtrack.  Better yet, go to http://silent-hall-of-fame.org/, make a small donation, and watch this and other silent movies for free.  A ROMANCE OF HAPPY VALLEY was made the same year as TRUE HEART SUSIE--another rustic story of romance and possible betrayal with Gish and directed by Griffith.  TRUE HEART SUSIE is exceedingly lovely.  Image Entertainment put out the dvd in 2007 in a fine edition with beautiful video quality and an exquisite score by Rodney Sauer and the Mont Alto Orchestra.  The resourceful Flicker Alley now distributes the 2007 edition of TRUE HEART SUSIE as part of their Manufactured-on-Demand service at $19.95.  Let's hope someone, somewhere, sometime soon, locates additional, original film elements for A ROMANCE OF HAPPY VALLEY so that a restored (or at least improved) version can be created.",1451174400,,1508,5.2899159663865545
8723848,5,B0118S6W9U,"Charming is the best word to use in describing this minor masterpiece by D.W. Griffith. Set in rural Kentucky, Robert Harron plays a young man with big ambitions. His church members pray that he will stay home on the farm, and Lillian Gish is the sweet thing living on a neighboring farm who also wishes he would stay put (and marry her). He'd like to do just that himself, but ambition calls and off to NYC he goes - where he spends seven years inventing a toy frog! Success and wealth now his, he returns to Happy Valley, but finds his father in desperate straights: he attacks a man, and then through some melodramatic and incredulous circumstances, he thinks he's killed Harron. All turns out well in the end. The picture is full of wonderful comic touches, especially its depiction of life in idealized Kentucky, which is contrasted to ""evil"" New York. Gish is delightful as the maid in waiting, hugging a scarecrow making believe its Harron and checking under her bed every night for burglars (something Mark Twain would have thought up). Kate Bruce as Harron's mother shows powerful restraint when her son finally comes home, thanking God for his return rather than jumping all over him. The film was thought to be lost until a copy turned up in the Russian film archive.",1150243200,6,1278,4.684444444444445
