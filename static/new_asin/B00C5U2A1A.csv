5690957,3,B00C5U2A1A,"This dvd is fun because Dwayne is entertaining but it's not worth $85 - $100.
I bought disk 1 for $30 about a year ago and was happy with it. It's worth $30 to get my kids started with Latin.
I was going to buy disk 2 and was shocked that the price had more than tripled.
I searched for a more affordable latin program. I found Latin for Children.
What a difference there is between Visual Latin and Latin for Children. With Visual Latin 1 you'll get a disk with 30 lessons and the ability to print a worksheet from your computer and printer.  With Latin for Children primer A you'll get 3 DVDs, 2 chant CDs and 4 books (Latin History book, a primer, an activity book and an answer key).
While Latin for Children is $99 there's more content and it's all printed and ready to use. I consider it more affordable.
I wouldn't recommend Visual Latin. I would suggest looking at Latin for Children.
Don't get me wrong Visual Latin is entertaining and my kids were learning Latin it's just not worth $100.",1411344000,13,998,4.336898395721925
5690958,5,B00C5U2A1A,My boys are in 6th grade and we are using this course to introduce them to Latin.  He is very easy to listen to and follow.  He has a great sense of humor and we are all picking up the content quickly and easily.  I can't recommend this highly enough!,1408752000,11,251,3.98
8577485,5,B00C5U2A1A,"Bought it for my son for as part of his high school Latin class and he enjoys the teaching style of Dwane Thomas.  The lessons are entertaining which helps to keep it interesting while they are learning the language.  Each lesson, 1 - 30, is separated into three short video and each video is around ten minutes long so it's hard to get bored and lose interest.
I would recommend the videos for anyone wanting to learn Latin.",1482969600,5,425,4.435897435897436
8577486,4,B00C5U2A1A,"Using this for homeschool. The lessons are very easy to follow.  With the purchase of this dvd, you get access to print off worksheets for all the lessons. The instructor is a little corny but my kids don't seem to mind him.",1475020800,2,224,4.333333333333333
8577487,5,B00C5U2A1A,"We home school our children in part, so we can provide them with a broader education than would be available in our tiny little towns public schools.  As their teacher, I tend to impose my over-achieving nature on my children when I plan each school year.  Not only do they often have 8 or 9 or even 10 classes each semester, they typically study the classics.  I surprised no one when I decided to teach my children Latin.  Because I had never studied Latin, I set off to find a complete curriculum where I didn't have to be an expert in the subject.  I found that, and much more, with Visual Latin  Latin 1.

WHAT IS IN THE BOX:  One DVD set of three DVDs containing 30 individual video Latin lessons.  Internet and DVD access is provided to all supporting worksheets, quizzes, vocabulary sheets and answer sheets which can be printed.

WHAT I LIKE:  Dwane Thomas is not only engaging, he is hysterical!  He grabbed my kids attention on day 1 with his reasons to study Latin.  My kids enjoyed every single lesson all year long.

This class can be tailored to suit a range of students.  In my house, Dwane taught Latin to my 5th grader as well as my junior in high school, at the same time.

I don't have to learn Latin for my kids to learn Latin.  At the beginning of our school year, I decided I wanted to learn Latin with my kids.  A few classes in, I decided I was too old to learn a new language, especially a dead one.  (I did not share my epiphany with my children.)

So many of our words have Latin underpinnings.  Dwane Thomas expands my kids vocabularies throughout this course as he prepares them for their STEM classes later.

This class doesnt require me to do a ton of work to make it work.  Grading is minimal and simple.  Praise God!

WHAT I DONT LIKE:  There were a couple of typos in some of the written work.  They were minor errors and were hardly noticeable.

I hate that Dwane Thomas doesnt have other language classes like this one.  We would be extremely happy to see him do a couple Spanish classes (hint, hint).

This has got to be the best language curriculum on the market.  In fact, half way through the course, we started searching for other classes taught by Dwane Thomas.  We found a vocabulary building program and I intend to teach that to my kids next year.  I love this curriculum and would highly recommend it to anyone who is even considering teaching their kids Latin!!!",1465603200,15,2410,4.392290249433106

8577492,5,B00C5U2A1A,"Fantastic program for our family.  Both my son and I have completed this first DVD and purchased the second one.  None of us had much if any background in Latin and enjoyed the layout and the lessons.  It was a fun learning adventure with lessons, reading and exercises.  It is well put together, effective and entertaining.  We are hooked on Dwane Thomas.",1429142400,5,356,4.67741935483871
8577493,5,B00C5U2A1A,Dwayne Thomas made learning Latin enjoyable for my son.  He really wanted to learn Latin but the other program we were using was a drudgery for him.  I watched a couple of the sample videos of Visual Latin and then ended up purchasing the DVD.  Looking forward to Visual Latin 2. :),1422835200,4,282,4.384615384615385
8577494,5,B00C5U2A1A,"I needed a Latin program for my homeschooling 7th grader and since I don't know any Latin, I needed something she could do without my help.  This program has been great!  If she does both level one and two, it will count as a high school year of Latin.  The video is engaging and the go along worksheets let her practice the skills she is learning.  The program has a huge amount of translating the Bible from Latin to English - each weekly lesson ends with a paragraph to translate.  Personally, I view it as a piece of literature that has huge influence in the world, so though we are not believers, I don't mind the exercises.  Most foreign language programs translate something useless, I view this one as double counting as world religions.  My daughter has complained of other programs being rude about pushing Christianity on their users, but though she is translating the Bible, she has not complained about this program.

My daughter is happy to work through this program with only minimal checking from me- and there are answer pages that came with the program.  She often asks ""Can I do my Latin first today, Mom?""  I don't think it gets much better than that!",1417824000,14,1171,4.586538461538462
