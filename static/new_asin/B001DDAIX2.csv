Hand bead embroidery can be used to embellish fabric, incorporate into a wall piece, use in crazy quilting, completely cover the surface to make a pin or brooch, and much more. This video covers all the uses for this simple, yet potentially ornate, method of beading. Stitches covered will be canvas work, running stitch, scatter beading, lazy stitch, back stitch, couching, feather stitch, stem stitch, beaded edgings, beaded fringes, and more. Several projects will put these stitches to use: a canvas-work floral pin cushion, a nautilus-shaped pin, a house-shaped pin, and an embellished doll using all kinds of beaded crazy quilt stitches and fringe. As the video progresses, you will make a sampler of stitches which will be a useful reference tool for future projects. Although this videocan be for a beginner beader, it offers detailed instruction and embellishment ideas for the more experienced beader as well.
My comments:  Carol's technique is excellent.  She even shows my favorite method for threading a needle (where you pinch the end of the thread between your fingers so you are only seeing the very tip of your thread, and then you push the eye of the needle over the thread).  This video is supposed to have an insert with templates for the projects.  My used copy was missing the insert, so I cannot comment on it, except that you only need it for the projects, not for the techniques, and most of the video deals with technique.  Some additional stitches covered but not mentioned above include buttonhole stitch, feather stitch, and herringbone embroidery stitch (not to be confused with the herringbone stitch in seed beading).  There are some tips here I haven't seen elsewhere, like basting a cord to your work and beading over the cord to add dimension to your embroidery.  Some of the fringe techniques covered include picot, twisted, kinky and chain.
