8272350,4,B00197YZAY,"I would give 5 stars for the production values, but I give 4 because I didn't enjoy the opera that much.  Even though Britten has always been partial to having children in his operas and cantatas to great effect, this one has too much of the whining and screaming of them to enjoy  it much.  There are some nice quiet moments, interludes, and some great harmonizing between the two female leads and a feel  of intimacy in the chamber score, but over all not quite as effective as other of Britten's best.
I have heard other versions and the result was about the same more or less.",1467763200,2,580,4.392523364485982
8272351,3,B00197YZAY,"This is a good performance with suitable staging and direction, and the adult roles are well sung and acted. However, I have a problem with the portrayals of the children. Nowhere in the novel does it mention them being happy, gay, carefree, shrieking noisily and chasing after each other at every opportunity. Rather, James portrays them as quiet, withdrawn, even moody, as one might expect haunted children to be. I found this performance's characterization of the children obtrusive and annoying, thus three stars rather than the four the production might otherwise merit.",1385942400,,575,5.260869565217392
8272352,5,B00197YZAY,"I can only agree with the other reviewer.  This is a beautiful production of Benjamin Britten's opera.  Turning it into a movie makes it even better because of all the natural scenery that can be included.  Also, the governess' monologue is sung to us as if she were just thinking it, and that is far more realistic than watching a singer ""thinking aloud"".

I just wonder why this wonderful DVD has so few reviewers.

January 22, 2013:  Actually, this DVD is listed in two places.  On the other page (same cover picture), there are seven reviews.  The DVD was initially released by Opus Arte, with notes; it is now offered by Kultur (probably without notes).",1356307200,6,658,4.660869565217391
8272353,5,B00197YZAY,"This is a restrained yet very imaginatve staging of this strange and wonderful opera based on the celebrated, ambiguous novella by Henry James. It is a production marked by simplicity and a style that is direct and honest. The director refuses to utilize cheap effects for their own sake. Some extra visual montages are imposed on the DVD proceedings but these do not distract and definitely enhance the creepy mood. What impresses most, however, is the naturalistic, restrained acting style of all involved. The bane of many DVD opera productions, e.g., tragic gestures, grotesque mugging or staggering about, are not in evidence. Would that other directors and singers would take note that all of the usual tomfoolery is not necessary to keep one interested or, in this case, riveted. The voices are good; no great discoveries but no clinkers either. All told,a highly enjoyable performance, one that can be recommended with few, if any, reservations.",1269129600,12,953,5.15483870967742
