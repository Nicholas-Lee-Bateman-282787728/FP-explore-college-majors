8027965,5,B0002H4B7E,"A rather short story by F. Kafka, where most of events are internal, not external.  Great acting with no hi-tech trickery described those events, the use of the entire body, not only face is impressive.  Indeed, you see a man converting to a horrible insect, and all is real, no dolls, special costumes, special effects.  Convincing, great acting!  There are very few words in the movie, but the true spirit of Kafka is conveyed.  True, the movie also gave a short fragments of a couple of other Kafka's stories, all incorporated into the same flow of thought and feelings, appropriately and skillfully intertwined.  It is intended for those who appreciate Kafka, or, at least read and appreciated the story of Metamorphosis, you have to appreciate Kafka's psychological play, and have  feel of it, to appreciate the movie.  I am not sure that a totally unprepared viewer would really get it.  I highly recommend the movie to all those who like Kafka, and to those unfamiliar, - try to read Metamorphosis, if you like it, the movie is for great for you, and the world of a great master will unfold before you...",1186185600,,1111,4.744791666666667
