8514537,2,B007CJL14Q,"""China: In the Shadow of Mr. Kong, The Influence of Confucius on the History and Culture of China"" 5-part series on 2 DVDs; (c)2010, KULTUR.

There is some value to a Westerner watching the first three parts of this 5-part series, but the fourth segment is tepid and the fifth segment is terribly biased.

Hossicks description of the dynasties is cursory but does highlight the major literary works. His description of the ideas of Confucius as written down thereafter (Analects, I Ching, etc.) are correct at this level of generalization, and their import in the scholarly exams for officials is well put.

However, China has wrestled with two major philosophies, the school of the professional as embodied in Confucian writings, and the counter-view of the legalists such as Han Fei-tze.  Much is made of the first emperor to unite China but that emperor adopted the contrary legalism and enforced it with such strictness that the first empire fell in two more generations. This tension down through Chinese history between judging what is right based on general concepts such as the do-unto-others Golden Rule and the gotta-have-everything-written-in-laws is the backbone of Chinese history, and is totally missing in this survey. Readers of this review would be well advised to read Head and Xings Legal Transparency in Dynastic China for an overview of how Confucian influence went into and out of style across the millennia and how it persisted in the lives of common folks.  Here you can find the difference between li for appropriate moral behavior, fa for law, and xing or punishment. With a huge population, China has always sought methods to rule without ruling and that can be achieved under either system. If everyone knows their responsibilities (in the family and to those above, under Confucian thought) all will be well. The legalists considered the ability to educate people to make moral judgements and act without the law to be impossible, and asserted that if everyone followed the law (because the penalty was so severe), one could also ""rule without ruling."" All of this tension and debate is missed in this program. To really read the heart of Chinese thought, any works by the authors Herrlee Glessner Creel and Derk Bodde are far superior. Even the more popular books by Pearl Buck succeed where this video falls short.

Confucianism went through a resurrection in the 1100's (Song Dynasty) with great Neo-Confucians such as Chu Hsi making far more extensive application of Confucian thought, but this also goes unmentioned.  The injustices of the Imperial and Republican eras were mostly set right after the Peoples Revolution of 1949, particularly for women who were mere property under the old systems. But to ensure equality and fairness, the new Republic had to instigate legalist philosophies. Nevertheless, throughout the last century, Confucian family ideals persisted and in the last few decades of growing prosperity, more Chinese have asked there must be more to life than this (new business prosperity) and there has been a resurgence in interest in religion and codes of behavior. Hossick does correctly discern that Confucianism is not a religion but is associated with ancestor worship that was present before Confucius arrived on the scene.

Unfortunately, writer and narrator Malcolm Hossick is terrible at pronouncing all of the Chinese namesall of them! His voice does reflects a sympathy for the older culture and his modern footage shows respect for the high speed trains and immense construction up to 2010. But his narration of more modern Chinese politics in the last part of this series drifts far from his explication of Confucius and is so laden with the Western viewpoint as to be little more than reinforcement of wrong Western views.",1446854400,,3789,5.109854604200323
8514538,3,B007CJL14Q,"The maker of this 5 hours DVD did a good and yet incomplete job in researching the long Chinese history of 2500 years under Master Kong.  He compared contemporary US with China with American Constitution.  He failed however took consideration the powerful Ming Dynasty with a global perspective when Europe just came out from Dark Ages and America was a New World to be explored.  He may not be aware that it was Confucianism introduced by missionaries back to Europe brought about the American and French Revolutions (according to Professor  Herrlee Creel of University of Chicago).  Besides Master Kong, there was Mencius and both of them were progressive.  Recent Chinese people purge Master Kong and his teaching in a wrong way as they are attacking the distorted, modified and adopted by emperors of different dynasties.

The DVD talks about the golden rule of Confucius - Do not do onto others what you do not want wish for yourself, a doctrine bringing peace and harmony with other Asian countries.  The writings from Dr. Joseph Needham were included so that views learn and appreciate what are the Chinese civilization contributions to the world.

The DVD puts the Chinese timeline along with the rest of the world so that non-Chinese will have a better idea on the relationship of development, East and West.

His WW II invasion of Japan to China only mentioned 1932 the attack of Shanghai.  In fact, the Japanese Kwantung Army manufactured the September 18 Incident in 1931 in an excuse to attack and conquer.  Just imagine what if  China did not heavily engaged Japan with casualties and sacrifices and what if Japanese Imperial would be able to join force with Nazi Germany for an Axis victory?

In the section of Overseas Chinese, he only filmed London and Bangkok.  What about San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Vancouver, Toronto, Melbourne of Australia?

As filmed in China, this DVD set is informative and entertaining to general audience who want a comprehensive Chinese history of the past 2500 years.  This helps in understanding China and Chinese people.

8514539,1,B007CJL14Q,"I have watched first 3 parts of this documentary and so far i have been very disapointed by this documentary.

In the 1st part of the series (""The Middle Kingdom""), several topics could have been eliminated as they are not relevant to the topic of this movie and feels like they were just added for the sake of filling up the dvd.

In the 2nd part of the series (""Matters of the Mind""), the author makes several:
1) deragetory remarks about Tibetans  and Daly Lama
2) makes racist remakes Israel and ommits the fact that it was the UN  that voted for creation of Israel
3) Has no respect for religion , calls religion as ""superstionios"",

HOpe the the last 2 parts are better than the first 3.

I would not recommend this dvd documentary to any one.",1359331200,4,749,4.391304347826087
