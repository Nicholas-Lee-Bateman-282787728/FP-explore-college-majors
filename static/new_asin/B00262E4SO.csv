Of course, if you love Brit Coms, you'll already own one or have downloaded the converter software to your computer. Lots of great Aussie Coms out there now, and this one should not be missed. Get the whole set!",1419897600,,303,4.428571428571429

8351721,5,B00262E4SO,Got these DVDs as a christmas gift and they're great!  The seller was really nice to work with and they arrived fast and exactly as advertised.  If you're a Kath and Kim fan then you gotta get this collection!,1389225600,,209,4.333333333333333
8351722,5,B00262E4SO,"The old ""Sundance"" cable channel introduced me to the original Australian ""Kath & Kim,"" brainchild of Ozzie comedy geniuses Gina Riley and Jane Turner. For a couple of wonderful years Sundance played and replayed the first three seasons of the series (as well as the made-for-TV movie ""Da Kath & Kim Code""), long enough for me to save some copies on VHS tape. Over time the tapes went the way of my last VHS player, and I was Kath & Kim-less until discovering that some kind soul had uploaded both the movie, and the full four seasons of the series to Veoh. The video quality is just awful, but better than nothing for a full-blown K & K addict.

I finally decided that there was zero chance that this series and its love children movie off-shoots, the previously mentioned ""Da Kath & Kim Code"" and the newest addition, a feature release titled ""Kath & Kimderella,"" would ever be issued in NTSC Region 1 format. I researched and purchased a region-free, fancy Toshiba blu-ray player that will ""automatically"" play these Australian discs and ordered all four seasons of my beloved ""Kath & Kim."" The new movie is on its way from Sydney and I'm getting ""Code"" as soon as I locate a new copy that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.

I lived in Melbourne (where the show takes place) for a few years as a child and have retained an interest in and fondness for all things Oz. There's plenty of specific information on the show on the internet, Wikipedia, etc. that I need not repeat. I can say if you like Brit humor like the old Python, anything John Cleese, the old character-based shows like ""Keeping Up Appearances"" and ""Are You Being Served?"", the first few wacky and out of the box creative years of ""Saturday Night Live,"" you will likely be a fan of Kath and Kim.

If I ever needed cheering up, I immediately slid a copy of ""A Fish Called Wanda"" into the DVD player and forgot my troubles. ""Kath & Kim"" produces the same flood of laughter and endorphins no matter that I've seen these shows over and over.

CAVEAT: American television attempted to recreate a Kath/Kim phenomenon of its own with a remake which bears only slightest resemblance to the original, in spite of Riley/Turner serving as exec producers and consultants. The show quickly tanked and deservedly so. Nobody's tried to remake ""Gone With The Wind"" have they? Comedy, really good comedy, is magic that shouldn't be messed with, IMHO.",1373846400,5,2399,4.611241217798595
8351723,5,B00262E4SO,"Good quality video but only available in the European and Australian PAL video format.  It will NOT play on DVD players sold in North American. North America uses a video format called NTSC.  Someone is missing an opportunity by not making these videos available in North Americas NTSC format.  I downloaded a software format converter and watch Kath & Kim on my computer ONLY.

These two women are hysterical as are the supporting cast of husbands and friends.  Great humor. Just love it.

Please make this available in North American NTSC video format.  I guarantee there is money to be made.",1325289600,7,594,4.821782178217822
8351724,5,B00262E4SO,"Kath & Kim are like Edina and Patsy's long lost relatives from ABFAB!  The series itself is amazing, and the packaging, extras, and all seasons included make this set the perfect gift for anyone who is a fan of the REAL Kath & Kim (that US-NBC based rip-off was a horror!)  Go out and get yourself one....you'll not regret it one moment.  The show is non-stop laughs...all 4 seasons!  My one regret?  It does not include DA KATH AND KIM CODE, which was an hour telemovie/bridge between seasons 3-4. Not sure why it wasn't included.",1287187200,5,531,4.5473684210526315
