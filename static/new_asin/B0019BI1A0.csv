3431434,4,B0019BI1A0,This is a fun movie about 3 jr. college cheerleaders and their adventures as they try to make money for grad school.,1234051200,3,116,4.318181818181818
3431435,2,B0019BI1A0,Not much of a movie at all. I only purchased it to see Michael Pare' and he is wonderful in it. Too bad the movies isn't..,1233446400,2,122,3.730769230769231
3431436,3,B0019BI1A0,"The Good Things
*Includes a making-of documentary and a trailer.
*The movie has a fair amount of action, comedy (although nothing really hilarious), and drama.
*Photography is good.  Editing style is neat, including some funky transitions (reminds me a little bit of the ""Charlie's Angels"" movies).
*Characters are not bad; they seem to be well-acted.  Writing is not bad.
*Good music.

The Bad Things
*Story line is quite thin (not that it really matters).
*Not for kids.  Contains nudity and swearing (this film is unrated).

The Questionable Things
*DVD video and sound quality are just okay.
*Includes some cliches, especially with the mobsters.  There are also some really cheesy scenes and lines throughout.  I'm sure some parts are horribly inaccurate or irrational.  Don't expect anything too intelligent.

So who wouldn't want to see a trio of hot young high-school-senoir-cheerleaders who can beat people up? Add in a little bit of drama, comedy, gratuitous nudity in the transitions, and a number of stripping scenes, and what do we get? A low-rate film that succeeds at being a guilty pleasure.  It is mindless entertainment; nothing more and nothing less.  If you're not into that sort of thing, watch ""Charlie's Angels"" instead.  Still not into that sort of thing, then you seriously shouldn't even be here.  But if this is your sort of thing, give it a try, for it is generally well-made.",1226016000,8,1403,5.047826086956522
3431477,4,B0019BI1A0,"I saw this movie on cable. I didn't have high expectations, but Ninja Cheerleaders completely exceeded them! I laughed a lot. I think part of what makes this movie fun is that it doesn't take itself too seriously.",1332806400,3,213,4.631578947368421
3431478,3,B0019BI1A0,"This movie was ridiculously stupid, but the girls were hot.  I didn't buy it for the acting, so you've been warned ;)",1315440000,,117,4.318181818181818
3431479,4,B0019BI1A0,"Just watched this movie and I actually quite enjoyed it! I can only describe it as Coyote Ugly meets Batman (the original series). Yes, it's poorly acted and yes, it's got a gossamer thin plot, but it does what it says on the tin; The girls are HOT, the action is as camp as George Takei, but it was quite fun if you watch it for what it is and don't expect too much. I really hope they make a sequel as they left the ending wide open for one, and i'd love to see those girls in action again!!!",1290297600,2,494,3.95
3431480,5,B0019BI1A0,"If you pay attention, the dialogue is well done and subtle.  Hot junior college babes.  Strippers.  Ninjas.  Cheerleaders.  Plot uses stereotypes perfectly.  The interplay between the girls is really fun.  If Reese Witherspoon were the star, this movie would reach the status of LEGALLY BLONDE.  The three actresses are great.

This movie is two things:  1)Fun, and 2) entertaining.",1272758400,10,382,5.322033898305085
3431481,5,B0019BI1A0,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. There is nothing pretentious about it just pure fun. Three young women switch between being wholesome cheerleaders, to dangerous ninja's, to pole dancing vixens. In the course of the movie they are all admitted to Brown University, win the poledancing contest to finance their education and take out the local mob. This is not Shakespeare but it is entertainment at its finest. A must for any collection.",1268524800,2,453,4.82051282051282
3431482,4,B0019BI1A0,"Three junior college girls trying to raise money to pay to transfer to Brown University and begin their future is a good premise for a movie.  Throw in a mobster who has stolen their ""Brown"" money and wants to take their sensei's bar and the big stripper contest that will help them raise the final bit of money needed to attend Brown and you have a pretty good late night movie. I caught this at like 2a on a Saturday night and stayed up to watch the entire movie. Much of the story is told in flashback which actually adds a great deal to the humour.  I enjoyed their interactions with the police, with the sailors, and with the bad guys.  I also enjoyed their priorities:  1) College Finals, 2) Stripper contest=$50,000, and then 3) kicking bad guy butt!  It wasn't deep, but I feel with better direction (and some better writing) the movie could definitely be kicked up to sleeper hit.  I enjoyed it and I will buy it because sometimes you need a little Ninja Cheerleaders in your life...and my Amazon Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death is getting worn out!  Now, excuse me while I go see Matt Damon sing ""Scotty Doesn't Know"" from EuroTrip.  Cheers!",1260057600,6,1156,4.4714285714285715
3431483,1,B0019BI1A0,"This movie has nothing to offer - it's not funny, not entertaining and not action packed. The only reason to watch it would be to see the three lead women nude - they aren't even topless!!! The idiot director, writer producer who made this pile of garbage needs to have his head examined - it's against the laws of nature and man to have three nice looking women and not have them take their clothes off. The movie is a complete waste of time - do not watch it.",1252627200,4,461,4.191011235955056
3431484,5,B0019BI1A0,"Look people...loosen up.. It's a B movie, but a darn good one. Let me tell you, the first time I saw this movie I recorded it on dvr and I watch it like once every 2 weeks now since recording it. I LOVE ""B"" movies and this is the pinnicle of them all!! Ninja Cheerleaders Rocks!! It's premise is simple: 3 smokin hot cheerleaders are also ninjas, kick butt while looking super sexy. What else is there? All you wanna be movie critics need to loosen up and just learn to actually enjoy movies for what they are.... entertainment...",1251072000,4,530,4.363636363636363
3431485,5,B0019BI1A0,"There comes a time when a movie comes along, that a man simply knows, deep within his soul, that nothing could ever eclipse its genius. Ninja Cheerleaders, my friends, is that very movie.

I knew I'd hit a goldmine when I saw George Takei listed in the credits, sure his unerring integrity was the only real endorsement David Presley's script needed. Not only was I proven correct, but his portrayal of Hiroshi, sensei to the trio of cheerleaders, literally had me weeping, caught in the tremendous perfection this low-budget comedy deserves! His ability to knowingly laugh on cue and cast approving nods is hereby unequaled, lending dramatic weight to something masquerading as terrible schlock.

Some of you may be asking yourselves, ""Did we see the same movie?"" or perhaps, ""Exactly how high was David Presley when he wrote this?"" or possibly even, ""God, why!?"" But know, you poor mislead and unfortunate creatures, that the true greatness bubbles, like a vat of baby-pot-pie, beneath the tattered and deplorable surface. This movie claims to be a comedy, but the honest truth, is that it critically reprimands our society for our dwindling social mores, our haste to judgement, and especially the harrowing lack of cheerleaders which exhibit criminally abysmal skill in the lost art of Ninjutsu. Some may insist a link between the slow extinction of Ninjas and the looming cataclysm which will obliterate the world in 2012, is impossible or at least highly unlikely. Ninja Cheerleaders is a warning to us all, and absolutely not ridiculously atrocious garbage mistakenly committed to film by a cavalcade of deluded actors.

The best example I can cite came near the end of the flick. The main opposing Ninja, a Ninja-ette perhaps, refers to herself in the third person. At one point, this memorable dialogue takes place after a cop claims she can not shoot him with her crossbow, currently pointed completely in the opposite direction:

Cop: You're not that fast!
Kinji: [shoots cop with crossbow]
Kinji: Kinji is that fast.

How is this not the equal of Second City, Kids in the Hall, or Monty Python? I'll tell you! It's better. It's tongue-in-cheek, insightful, and poignant, where other such examples fall flat. The humor here is biting, sardonic, and wild. Nobody hams up his or her performance without reason, or delivers monotonous readings without fully wringing out every last drop of irony.

This, my friends, is what cinema should be!",1245628800,2,2449,5.034567901234568
3431486,2,B0019BI1A0,"If you like watching young women beat the crap out of men for being rude (!) you might enjoy this. Otherwise, there's no real point in watching this. Don't expect any big laughs or any exciting moments. The sound is badly synchronised with the actors' lip movements. I don't know if this is supposed to be funny, like a parody of dubbed ninja movies from Asia.

It would be fun to see such a film with reversed gender roles some time. Three young men assaulting middle-aged women for not showing them proper respect. Not because I enjoy watching women getting beat up, but to see the reaction from society. For some reason, women's violence against men is more hilarious than vice versa. Often, like here, it's even justified.

I almost forgot. Are you thinking of buying this movie because the three gorgeous girls work part-time as strippers? Don't. They're not even topless.",1241827200,4,877,4.7631578947368425

8273290,3,B0019BI1A0,"This movie has gratuitous nudity B-movie (I'm looking at you, Troma) written all over it, but there's nothing further from the truth.  Adequate production values, passable acting, interesting dialog and recognizable supporting actors make this a solidly entertaining movie (depending on expectations - see below).

The plot is a fairly basic kidnap/rescue affair that fortunately doesn't take itself too seriously.  The main characters are given just enough development to get by, while the supporting characters are mostly just archetypes with a sprinkling of script dust to explain their presence in the movie.  Nothing innovative, but all characters have a reason for being.

The martial arts portion of Ninja Cheerleaders is one area this movie falls flat (with ""martial arts"" loosely defined here).  The lead actresses obviously have no training, nor do any of the other actors.  George Takei does a good job of faking it, though, but he is replaced with a trained stunt double for back/distance shots while swordfighting.  Still, if you were expecting a gratuitous nudity B-movie then the fight choreography of Ninja Cheerleaders will probably impress you.

And that leads me to the last issue with Ninja Cheerleaders - expectation.  I'd wager that most people seeing the cover of this movie think 'T-&-A with ninjas? Sweet!' and are sorely disappointed when they watch this movie as it has virtually no T-&-A and sparse nudity.  In fact, the camerawork/editing of the movie takes efforts to NOT show the main characters clearly as they perform their strip routine, so much so they should have just used body doubles.  The only nudity is in random clips of strippers during scene changes and a 5-second scene with Heather Vandeven and Jaime Lynn hanging all over Jason Ellis (note: I have no clue who he is but he plays himself, for what that's worth).  If you remove the combined 20 seconds of nudity (topless only) then this film would be playable on a major TV network during the day with virtually no editing.

Overall, I give this movie 2-1/2 stars (rounding up to 3).  Definitely worth a watch if you're not expecting something akin to Striptease Samurai Squad or even Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  And for the record, my favorite scene was when the main characters first meet the police detective and they go into clueless bimbo mode.  Their dialog was most amusing.  :D",1378166400,,2380,5.028061224489796
8273291,4,B0019BI1A0,this was a good movie i sat though the whole didn't fast forward at all not bad strange how they were strippers to didn't know that,1368144000,,131,4.076923076923077
8273292,1,B0019BI1A0,"This movie was awful.  I was hoping it would be so much better than it was.  With a name like ""Ninja Cheerleaders"" I was thinking it would be a homerun.  Also to add to my heartache and dismay, these girls were also strippers.  So they were ninjas, cheerleaders and strippers.....and the movie still sucked.

First things first, a pet peeve of mine is when strippers in movies never get naked.  It sort of defeats the purpose.  Sorry, my macho inner child is coming out.  I could forgive this if they cheered more or were ninjas more.  Nope we the viewers do not get that either.  Instead we are given some lame subplot about how these girls need to save money so they can all go to the same college together.  And the conflicts of these girls personalities play out like a bad soap opera.  And when we actually do see some fighting, it is lackluster.

Now there is some good news, yet it is tainted with bad news. George Takei and Michael Par&eacute; are both in this flick but are sadly underused.  I believe giving them bigger roles and/or more purpose it could have elevated this film.  At the end of the day, this movie tries awfully hard to be a cult classic and it is just......sucks.",1358208000,,1191,4.423963133640553
8273293,4,B0019BI1A0,"April, Courtney and Monica are students by day, go-go dancers and ninjas by night.

It is what it is, a cute parody of action and exploitation films.  The girls are sexy, the plot is silly, the nudity is brief (and does not involve the 3 main girls).

George Takei's performance as their sensei is particularly good.

Ninja Cheerleaders is fun and light and just the thing if that's what you're looking for.

Watch out for the similarly named Cheerleader Ninjas, which is not nearly as good.",1350691200,3,491,4.662790697674419
