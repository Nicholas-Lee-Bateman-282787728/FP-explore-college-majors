This movie was absolutely horrible! With bad acting and an over abunance of cheesy love scenes . The filming was so bad you would think it was filmed on a video camera. The plot was probably the only decent thing, besides the movies cover, which i am throughly convinced more money was spent on that then the movie itself.",1125187200,5,630,4.384615384615385
