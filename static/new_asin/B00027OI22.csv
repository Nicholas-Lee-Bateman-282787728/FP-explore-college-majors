8521777,5,B00027OI22,"As a windsurfer entering kiting, i've been put off by the seemingly scary aspects of learning to handle my kite and not getting into trouble. In this nicely-produced DVD, the makers present a totally different approach to learning.
Rather than starting on small kites on ""normal"" length lines, here you start with your FULL-SIZE kite, and move up through varying line lengths (starting at 0 length! you'll see what I mean...) as your skills improve.
I'd reccomend this dvd (i think there is a book too) to anyone looking to learn kiteboarding, preferably with the aid of a proper instructor (not just one of your mates!), who can tell you about kiting in your area and help refine your skills.
Also has some great ""eye candy"" kiting footage at the end to get you pumped up to go out, especially useful if you live in cold Scotland like me and not Maui where this is made!!",1089590400,11,872,4.596153846153846
