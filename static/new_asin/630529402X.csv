8551560,4,630529402X,"This series is excellent!  In this episode each character reveals a secret desire that no one knows.  Well the big strong beefcake we know as Gateau is the only one we didn't know about but hey! It's a great secret! And amazingly enough the character known as Carrot is actually of some use, and saves the day! Kinda scary ain't it? Twice as scary is the fact that Carrot (the letcher we all love) almost gets a date! Now that's scary! This tape is a drama/comedy, and will please almost anyone.",985046400,,495,4.428571428571429
