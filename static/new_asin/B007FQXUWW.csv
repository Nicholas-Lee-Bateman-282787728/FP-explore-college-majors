8515886,5,B007FQXUWW,I bought this two years ago for a Sunday school class that I teach. The children love the songs and we have started doing dance moves to them. The videos of each song are well illustrated and there is nothing out of alignment with scripture about these songs. They are great and the children really enjoy them. I would recommend this for preschool ages only. They might be too kiddish for 1st grade and over.,1452729600,,408,4.453333333333333
8515887,5,B007FQXUWW,"I bought this for a church retreat. since this is the first time I spent time with this church's children, I am not sure what kind of songs they like, so I chose this one with more popular songs. Children loved it and did not want to stop the music worship. then I started to use in my own church's Sunday school, to my surprise, all my kindergarteners and preschoolers love it, I thought they were tired of old songs, I was wrong.
Besides, it is such good price. Classical is always classical.",1389830400,,494,4.32258064516129

Love teaching our little ones about Jesus and this is a great way to initate it.",1362700800,3,241,4.148936170212766
