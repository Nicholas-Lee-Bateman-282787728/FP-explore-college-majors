8282405,5,B001B9X78Q,Very informative DVD. Tells you how to train for this type of attack. Most Dojo's don't train you for this. Keep in mind this not a how to fight 20 guys at one time. No such thing. This is very realistic training.,1400371200,,213,4.095238095238095
8282406,2,B001B9X78Q,"Rat Packed will show you a couple of basic techniques, but it falls far short of providing a decent methodology for dealing with multiple attackers.  During most of the video, you will watch the author's students perform drills...over and over and over and over and over again.  This is largely a waste of time.  The audio and video are both quite poor; it appears this is more of a home movie type of production rather than a professional production.

One area where this video excels in comparison to many other videos is that it does a good job of showing the speed at which a violent encounter will occur.  Many productions leave you with the impression that you're going to have time to think through your technique as bad things are happening....not so in the real world.  This video does a nice job of demonstrating that fact.

If you are serious about learning a decent methodology for dealing with multiple attackers, don't rely solely on Rat Packed.",1381190400,,959,4.706586826347305
8282407,5,B001B9X78Q,"If you are in High School, then I really do recommend this, actually I recommend this for everyone, especially those who is the ""lone wolf"" type of person; who walks alone most of the time. Rat Pack was the first dvd i've ever purchased from Sammy Franco, and from that then on, I would like to start owning a collection of his dvd's.

In the real world, thugs and gangsters roam the streets in packs. You see them everywhere; in malls, streets, sidewalks, in their cars, and also in SCHOOLS. I asked if the person who is reading this whether they are in high school because usually most fights happen in high school and cliques and groups start to form.

This dvd is very useful in the real world because one day when your walking alone, some thugs might mess with you for the fun of it, or just simply teach you a lesson because they just don't like you. In the real world, there is NO rules; the one on one rule is DEAD. It's either you prepare yourself in any situation or you get beaten to a pulp.

I luckily bought this DVD during high school because there were people who posed as a threat to me and they roam around the schools and public places; thinking that they own the place. And that really ticks me off. One day I was confronted with a group of people who wanted to beat me up because I was in there way. So I did what Sammy taught me to do and made sure that I didn't do anything wrong like being surrounded; this is one of the few things Sammy teaches you. So at the end I got away with only a bruise to the arm while the others were restrained by officers, who luckily came in time before I get more bruised up. Now if you are wanting to know, there were four guys vs. me. Now I don't care if you believe me or not, but after that day, I was confident and thankful for Sammy Franco for teaching me the ways of defending from multiple attackers.

Also, everyone knows that in martial arts, they of course teach you to defend from multiple attackers, but not the real world way. In some martial arts, the attackers attack you turn by turn. What I really appreciate about Sammy Franco's DvD is it's real world senario's. Instead of turn by turn attackers, in the real world they would go at you all at once and he shows you what to do in these situations.

Now Mr. Franco shows you how to determine the Leader of the group, the right way and the wrong way of defending yourself, like not getting surrounded, vital target areas, and much more.

I tell you what, when I first watched this dvd, it really got me pumped up because the real world senario's were scary real life situations. If you plan to show your little kids this dvd, just remember that it IS very violent and will scare your kids. But it will help them in their future one day.

I also recommend a dvd from Sammy Franco's library that will teach you combat skills which would be very useful with this dvd.",1262131200,4,2885,4.24408014571949
8282408,5,B001B9X78Q,"And you have these nasty, ill-tempered thugs suddenly wanting blood. What do you do? If you don't know, you're as good as street grease. What this DVD will teach you is how to deal with those situations in which you're facing that ""tough guy"" and all of his boys. What you don't know can land you in a permanent hurt locker. Stay out of it as much as possible and add this to your library.",1241481600,,389,4.2
