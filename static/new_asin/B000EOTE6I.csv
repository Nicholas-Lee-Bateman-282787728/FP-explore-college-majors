8112322,5,B000EOTE6I,"This truly showed me the reason for so many of my own problems when it came to school and social skills.  I feel that this is very informative and is a must-see for all educators and paraeducators.  This truly brings to light the deep issues surrounding learning disabilities that are all too frequently only thought of in terms of academic performance.  This video highlights how they also affect emotional and social development, which continges on the development of the whole person.",1376092800,,487,4.987654320987654

8112325,5,B000EOTE6I,This is a must have if you have kids with challenges.  Learned alot from this DVD as always with Rick Lavoie.  He is a great speaker and very knowlegeable about learning disablities.,1353283200,,182,4.65625
8112326,5,B000EOTE6I,"This video is a must-see for all parents and teachers, whether your child has a learning disability or not.  At first I was skeptical about watching this because the set-up is very ""motivational speaker"" (a dynamic guy on a big stage talking to a huge audience), but within a few minutes I was very glad that I did.

Lavoie's excellent presentation is clear and engaging, and it gave me new insight about the ways that one's parenting style impacts children---both negatively and positively.  He illustrates each of his points with real-life examples, making them clear and easy to remember.

For a glimpse of this presentation, check out the various videos posted on YouTube.",1342137600,,676,4.95575221238938
8112327,5,B000EOTE6I,"This was a great video for me to watch as well as everyone that is in contact with my child who has mild autism.  I passed it on to the school and pass it to anyone who will watch it.

Thank you",1257379200,,194,3.5952380952380953

""..... This handbook will be divided into three distinct--- but inter-related - sections:

* The KNOWLEDGE section will acquaint the reader with the specific aspects of the learning disabilities profile that can cause misbehavior.

* The PHILOSOPHY section will outline some basic concepts which - when fully understood and effectively utilized - can be valuable as you develop your own behavior management plans.

* The TECHNIQUES section will present dozens of field-tested strategies that can be used to monitor, evaluate, and manage children's behavior.

The interaction of these three factors will enable you to
WORK EFFECTIVELY WITH THE SPECIAL NEEDS CHILD IN YOUR CARE.""
