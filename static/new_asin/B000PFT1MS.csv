2817572,5,B000PFT1MS,Delightful stories from the Creative Genius of Somerset Maugham. Well acted and just completely entertaining. Of course I am biased as  I have a great fondness for tales from this time period and location.,1383091200,2,205,5.029411764705882
2817573,5,B000PFT1MS,"Robert Osborne got up on TCM and, walking around his living room, told us that even though ENCORE came after TRIO and QUARTET in the ambitious program to bring Maugham's short stories to British cinema screens, they saved some of the most famous ones for this installment, including ""The Ant and the Grasshopper"" and ""Winter Cruise.""  Thought I was hearing things, but I rewound and rewound and he said exactly that, showing that even though Turner prides itself on its fact checking department, they are not alwsys correct, however on second thought I decided that perhaps there's some alternate universe in Atlanta in which ""Winter Cruise"" and ""Ant + Grasshopper"" were indeed among Maugham's more celebrated tales.  The point is pretty moot I know, for far more importantly, I thoroughly enjoyed these little known stories and their film adaptations made me regret bitterly the end of the series.

THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPER gives us two brothers, respectable broker (Roland Culver) as brother George, the ant, whereas playboy George (Nigel Patrick) as the grasshopper Tom openly hates working, cadges money continually from brother George, humiliates and embarrasses his middleclass soul, and finally winds up raking it all in by marrying the third richest girl in England.  Maugham was famous for his sophisticated cynicism and it's in full flower here.  The brothers are nicely differentiated, dreamy Nigel Patrick never more appealing, if I was an international playgirl like Margaret Vyner I'd be all over him like hot fudge on a sundae.  (This was Vyner's penultimate film, she later became a writer responsible for several London stage hits, including THE GRASS IS GREENER.)

""Winter Cruise"" is a showcase for Kay Walsh as a tearoom entrepreneur who likes to take a long Caribbean cruise every year, invariable boring the crew and officers of whatever ship she winds up on to bitter tears, for she is a thoughtless egotist who doesn't know how to shut up nor say an interesting thing.  Finally on one cruise, the officers get together and lean on French steward Jacques Francois to ""romance"" Miss Reid under the Southern Cross, just to shut her up.  An unexpected denouement proves sobering for everyone in the crew.

Finally, Eric Ambler wrote the screenplay for the finale, ""Gigolo and Gigolette,"" a tale of the Riviera with British show couple Sid and Stella as a team of adventurers who have worked up a daring vaudeville act (after a murky background in which, we gather, one or the other of them worked as a prostitute).  Now they are the toast of Cap d'Antibes with their act, in which Stella (Glynis Johns, gloriously hamming it up) mounts an 80 foot ladder in a shimmery silver lame bathing suit, and dives into a pool covered with flames, and only five feet deep, twice a night ricking her neck to please an audience of hardened cafe society who are really only there, she divines, hoping that she will slip, fall and die before their eyes.  What a grim, dour story, bitter as anything Fritz Lang ever thought of!  And Johns' stuntwork is beautifully melded into the rest of the story, allowing for a pair of heart-clenching sequences in which first, she performs the stunt without a hitch, and the second, in which she--well, I can't say, it would be cruel of me, even though you may never get to see this elusive VHS tape, but maybe it will come out on DVD, I hope with a nice commentary by the fantastic Welsh soubrette Glynis Johns, still alive (2007) and hopefully doing pretty well?  This might be her finest half hour.",1188950400,11,3545,4.867109634551495
8190924,4,B000PFT1MS,"To me, not as good as Quartet, but still it gives us another group of very interesting short stories that give you the feeling they are based on real people and their true life experiences. The stories are unique and definitely worth watching.",1489190400,,243,4.674418604651163
8190925,3,B000PFT1MS,"In the late 1940's early 50's the British made a series of anthology films based on short stories by W. Somerset Maugham: Quartet (1948), Trio (1950) and Encore (1951).  All three films exemplify the high standards of production, writing, and acting of British films of this period. But the thing about short stories is that you like some better than others, and while I very much enjoyed the stories in ""Quartet"", for example, I was unfortunately not so taken with the three stories in ""Encore"".  While the contrasting styles of Nigel Patrick and Ronald Culver were perfect for the first segment, ""The Ant and the Grasshopper"", for me this story was too much of a fluff.  I appreciated much more the second segment, ""Winter Cruise"", especially the performance of Kay Walsh and the story's touching, somewhat enigmatic twist at the end.  And I must confess that for me there was too much tension, almost anxiety, in the final story, ""Gigolo and Gigolette"", especially regarding the fate of the always charming Glynis Johns.",1462406400,,1023,4.930232558139535
