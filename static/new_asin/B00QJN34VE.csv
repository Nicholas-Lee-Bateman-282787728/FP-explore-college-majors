6872623,5,B00QJN34VE,"Jack Klugman as Quincy ME was not very unlike Peter Falk as Detective Columbo, both were meticulous and analytical in their methods of solving complex and ingenious crimes and bringing criminals to justice. Columbo started in the early 70's, ran for 7 seasons, but then continued making specials well into the early 90's. Quincy ME began in the mid 70's and ran for 8 seasons. Both are classic mystery type crime shows.

Some of the guest stars for this final season include Jonathan Frakes of Star Trek TNG, Jose Ferrer, Michael Constantine of Room 222, Simon Oakland, Robert Ginty, Frank Aletter, John Rubenstein, John Anderson, Charles Aidman, Lew Ayres, Edd Byrnes of 77 Sunset Strip, John McIntire of Wagon Train and The Virginian, William Campbell, June Lockhart of Lassie, Ann Blyth, Henry Gibson of Laugh-In, Barry Newman and Tony Dow of Leave It To Beaver, just to name a few.

Some facts from Jack Klugman's bio :

Date of Birth 27 April 1922, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA

Birth Name Jacob Joachim Klugman

Best remembered by the public for his starring role as ""Oscar Madison"" on The Odd Couple (1970).",1421280000,18,7813,4.592406876790831
6872624,5,B00QJN34VE,"I am waiting with great anticipation for the release of the eighth and final season of ""Quincy"".  I had not seen the show in many, many years and purchased Seasons 1 and 2 several months ago.  Since that time I have purchased Season 3 and I am enjoying that one right now.  I must tell you that the re-mastering job done on each of these episodes is absolutely first rate.  Last week I threw caution to the wind and decided to order the last five seasons of the series from Amazon. Oddly enough, I never watched ""Quincy"" during it's heyday in prime time but got hooked on the series when it went into syndication back in the 1980's.  You can always count on great writing and superb acting from the outstanding cast that producer Glen A. Larson assembled for this long running dramatic series. Furthermore, unlike most prime time series these days this is a family friendly show. There is little sexual innuendo here, no vulgar language and any violence is kept to a minimum. Jack Klugman was very proud of this show and puts his heart and soul into each and every episode.  Finally, the addition of Anita Gillette as Dr. Emily Hanover adds another dimension to the show.  Quincy had not had a romantic interest in several seasons.  I look forward to seeing ""Quincy, M.E.: The Final Season"" because as I recall the quality did not diminish one little bit.  Very highly recommended!",1421020800,22,1381,4.604081632653061
6872625,4,B00QJN34VE,"QUINCY was about a widowed strong-willed, very principled Medical Examiner for the LA County Coroners office who worked to ascertain facts & reasons for potential suspicious deaths & seemed to usually know more about the crimes than the police did, especially in criminal investigations and ran on NBC for 7 years.

Additionally, Quincy(Jack Klugman)lived on a yacht and was very popular with women and eventually got remarried in this 1982-83 Season of this popular 1976-83 mystery drama.

QUINCY also takes me back to memory lane to when my mom and I would watch it sometimes on Thursday nights on NBC after BUCK ROGERS from the Fall of 1979 through the Summer of 1980 and then when it was moved to Wednesday nights after THE FACTS OF LIFE & DIFFERENT STROKES by the Summer of 1981.

You can also watch these 1982-1983 Season episodes complete & uncut as well as commercial free without having to worry about all those deleted scenes you'd get when QUINCY was shown in reruns on A&E and now ME-TV, every Monday thru Friday.",1420675200,17,1025,4.779661016949152

6872635,5,B00QJN34VE,"I love the authentic science and medicine since today we see so much quackery and propaganda. I also enjoy the relaxing fact that sex, nudity, bad language, and gore are not a part of the show! It gets more difficult all the time to find good quality shows that are not offensive! And Hollywood seems intent of political suicide, limiting the shows I can enjoy even further! So, yes, Quincy is a pleasure to watch. Good drama with likeable characters and important plots.",1487894400,,471,4.686746987951807

6872639,5,B00QJN34VE,"I knew I wanted the entire series but was amazed to learn it was on for eight years!  Who knows why but the Odd Couple was not funny to me.so my first acquaintance with Jack Klugman was as Quincy.  I've seen the first 3 seasons and know why forensics is so fascinating to  us now.  BUT JACK WAS FIRST!  Every week his Foot in His Mouth, Painted into a Corner Human Foibles provide the laughs.  But at the end of the show we all wish we had someone in our life with his wisdom, compassion and willingness to take on every sad situation he believes he can make better.  His ""Boss"" has my sympathy and I'm always touched when he surprises me by firmly coming to Quincy's defense.  That's when we know Quincy's behavior will never break their bond.  However and by whoever it was decided to release this series to DVD, I am most grateful.  I intend to donate them to a Independent Living / Assisted Living Facility where I have several friends.
