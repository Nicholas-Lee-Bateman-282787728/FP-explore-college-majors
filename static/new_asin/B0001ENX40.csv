8011408,5,B0001ENX40,"This is one of the most beautiful and erotic films of the early sixties, in France. The film has fantastic locations, beautiful black and white photography, great direction, music and acting. The transfer is good most of the time, but not perfect. It's widescreen, with optional french or english audio. Great extras with informative biographies. Fans of Radley Metzger will love Sweet Violence (1962). Criterion should release films by Max Pecas and Jose Benazeraf.",1360627200,9,466,5.3108108108108105
