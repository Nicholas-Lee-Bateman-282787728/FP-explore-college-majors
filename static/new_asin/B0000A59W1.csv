1904333,4,B0000A59W1,"I ordered this tape so that I could exercise at home.  It serves that purpose well.  A brisk exercise that uses some stretching exercise...good conditioning.  The chatter of Leslie I try to tune out, but the walking program itself is excellent.",1247616000,,244,4.902439024390244
1904334,5,B0000A59W1,This video is easy to follow and makes burning calories easy. It's just the right length-- not too long to be tedious but long enough so you feel good afterwards.  I use it 3-4 times and week and don't get bored.,1236297600,,212,4.170731707317073
1904335,5,B0000A59W1,"I love this DVD from Leslie - it is the perfect workout when you're short on time.  The workout lasts approximately 33 minutes and was just what I was looking for.  I borrowed it from the library at first but, liked it so much, I ended up buying it through Amazon!  This workout is very easy to follow using Leslie's basic steps.  Definitely recommend!",1221868800,,352,4.453125
1904336,3,B0000A59W1,"I love Leslie Sansone but reccomend you skip this Express video.  The Techno music is awful, some of it even has words like ""Power Walk"" over and over during the warm up.  Some may say just do it without the sound, but then you miss her cues.  There are very little arm movements in this video, really only the 10 minutes with the strechie band and just before that they use the band they do 2 movements without the band.  The regular old Walk Away the Pounds videos are great and have lots of arm movements, I reccomend those.  Lucky for me I did not waste my money on this video, but borrowed it from the library.  I really liked Leslie Sansone's Power Walk 3 miles the best.",1094083200,14,677,4.25
1904337,5,B0000A59W1,"After purchasing several other workout videos, I happened to stumble acrossed Leslie's Walk Away The Pounds Express 2 Mile video. I had never heard of her and was skeptical, but decided to try it out. Wow...what a surprise! It was EXACTLY what I had been searching for! Leslie's program is very effective and yet it couldn't be easier to follow. There is no fancy footwork or frustrating moves to learn...it's soooo easy! The music is very motivating and fun. The workout incorporates both upper and lower body and is a great cardio workout and fat burner. I do this tape 5 days a week and have not yet grown bored with it. I will definitely be buying more of Leslie's tapes!",1078444800,11,675,4.586776859504132

7996381,5,B0000A59W1,"Love it.  My copy was so old it was defective.  I was thrilled to find a new one.  Shipping was very prompt and the tape is perfect.
I am 77 years old.  I have been doing aerobics at least five days a week for 35 years and Leslie Sansone is by far my favorite instructor.  It is great to be able to be at home in front of my own TV and getting good healthy exercise.",1402272000,6,366,3.763157894736842
