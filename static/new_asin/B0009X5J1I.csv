This contains two monochrome movies from the 1940s: The Third Man 1949 and The Stranger 1946. Both involve a man who is not what he seems to be, and is dangerous. This fact is brought out by an investigation that is the plot of the film. Be careful with your friends.

The Third Man is set in Vienna. Holly Martins arrives for a promised job. Harry Lime isn't there to meet him, he is being buried today. Martins arrives at the graveyard. Crabbins offers Martins a job to lecture on the contemporary novel; he will be paid. Baron Kurtz calls for a meeting; he was a friend of Harry Lime. Martins visits Harrys girlfriend actress Anna Schmidt. She accepts the loss of Harry to move on with her life. Martins learns more details about Limes death: his driver, his friends, and his doctor were all there. Was it really an accident? A porter promises to provide more information, but is later found murdered. Major Calloway explains Limes racket. Stolen penicillin was watered down and sold for enormous profits. Martins sees a watcher at night. He reports this to Calloway, who investigates and discovers buried facts. Martins warns an old friend about the police. This conversation reveals Limes character. There is a dramatic chase where Martins settles his debt with an old friend. The film ends with another funeral.

The Stranger is set in a New England college town. It is about the search for a Nazi war criminal said to be there. Franz shows up as a new teacher. He marries the daughter of an important man (Chief Justice). A Department of Justice Nazi hunter arrives, he poses as an antique dealer. There is a clue to the identity of Franz, his obsession with clocks. The facts come out to point to Franz. Franz tries to kill his new wife since she knows too much about him! This shows his lack of humanity and leads to his exposure and fall. Can anyone hide in a small college town? This film warned about giving refuge to Nazi collaborators, a policy unknown to most people at the time. [There are books about this, such as The Belarus Project.] This was a more innocent time when college students ran through the woods as a pastime (to burn up excess energy rather than socializing).
