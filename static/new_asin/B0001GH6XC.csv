8012254,3,B0001GH6XC,"PRO:  This yoga video, is slow and focused on breathing, without being 'easy'.  Many of the slower paced yoga videos end up not being challenging, this one is.  She doesn't over 'talk' but she does give enough instruction that while you are in the pose you can strive to get good alignments going.

CON: She gives new names to many of the poses (Adho Mukha Svanasana/Down ward facing dog becomes Mountain).  Also, if you are newer to yoga you will not full understand all the aspects of the pose, as there is no resource describing the poses individually.",1335830400,,555,4.622448979591836
8012255,5,B0001GH6XC,"This is the third Kali Ray DVD that I have purchased and I have not been disappointed.  The other reviewers gave the outline and content of the DVD so I'll point out what I like about it personally.
First, the whole DVD has a quiet, peaceful, and mediatative quality about it from start to finish.  The initial breathing asanas calm the mind.  I appreciate the lack of constant chatter because I like to repeat my own meditations, especially at night.
The other asanas, just flow from one to the other, always well explained with moderations for those who need them.
The relaxation at the end is very peaceful.  It seems I sleep much better when I do this DVD at night.
It does build strength, but in a gentle way.  I do feel the cat bow series and a few other lunge/warrior poses, but in general, this is not as ""powerful"" as other yoga DVD's, but I really get more out of this that others...the stress melts away.",1207180800,,915,4.4226190476190474
8012256,5,B0001GH6XC,"This is not a power yoga dvd.  If you want something that will ""work"" you, I suggest you get another dvd. I loved the slow passed, relaxing asanas.  This dvd truely examplies what yoga should be--a mix of effort and relaxation.  I am sick of the yoga dvds which simply force you through a variety of poses without really preparing you mentally or physical to do the pose. Yoga in many dvd's today has become an aerobic workout mixed with power poses.  I was glad to finally find a true yoga dvd.",1179360000,,495,4.3478260869565215
8012257,4,B0001GH6XC,"This was my first TriYoga video, although I've taken classes at a TriYoga-inspired studio as well as a 2-day workshop last year with a TriYoga instructor, Martha Hamilton. TriYoga founder Kali Ray calls this DVD your ""Daily 10"" in that it contains 10 posture segments (all chaptered), each about 5-6 minutes long. In addition, the practice begins with a 3-minute rhythmic breath section and ends with a 4-minute relaxation.

The 10 strengthening segments are as follows:

1) leg stretch--reclined leg movements plus static holds

2) reclined butterfly--preliminary hip and groin opening

3) cat rolls--cat/cow stretches

4) cat bow 1--cat stretches with a push-up move

5) mountain heel press (mountain is the TriYoga name for down dog)

6) cat bow 2--a repeated flow from down dog to the cat push-up

7) runner--lunge stretches

8) triangle--moving from standing forward bend

9) side warrior--same as above

10) half tortoise twist--seated twist

The total time for this video is about 58 minutes, and although the DVD case says it is divided into two rotations, there was no discernable break. Each segment includes only a few postures--Kali moves quite slowly and methodically through the dynamic poses and engages in lengthy static holds as well. Some of the flows, such as the cat bows, do require strength, but overall, I found this to be more of a relaxing, gentle practice.  Because each posture segment has the ability to stand alone, this is a versatile DVD--ie, you could get in a quick 10-minute practice by doing only 2 segments, do half the segments for a 30 minute session, or complete the entire practice when you have a full hour. I will use this video mainly when I want to engage in soothing yoga moves that require little effort or exertion.

Finally, Kali is a gentle, soft-spoken teacher who speaks with a slight accent. She reminds me a little of Wai Lana; although she is not nearly as flamboyant, the stand-alone segments of this practice were similar to a Wai Lana video. At times, there is an alternate view of Kali where she is shown using props (a strap and yoga blocks), but she makes only passing comments about how to modify. Overall, however, I found her to be a calming presence and enjoyed her instruction.",1125273600,15,2242,4.896825396825397
8012258,4,B0001GH6XC,"While this DVD may not provide the sort of ""strengthening"" one is used to in a yoga DVD, as in traditional Ashtanga or Power Yoga, the postures will certainly strengthen your yoga practice, if not give you a ""yoga (...).""  However, for people just starting their yoga practice, this might be a great way to begin exercising the muscles that will be used in any practice.

Kali Ray provides a very gentle, meditative, and original sequence of poses in this routine.  You will not see the traditional sun salutation, although a nice version of the poses are presented.  Her focus is, as it should be, on connecting breath with movement and maintaining awareness of a complete breath throughout the exercises.  Kali Ray herself is beaming through the whole routine, which is kind of cool, and inspires me to look inside for the joy in the practice.

Because I do need to have a cardio and tough strengthening workout from most of my yoga routines due to time considerations,I won't be using this DVD on a daily basis.  But I really do enjoy it and will be doing it as often as possible.  I will also be buying more of Kali Ray's DVDs.",1095465600,10,1131,4.564356435643564
8012259,5,B0001GH6XC,"Hi, I started Kali Ray TriYoga three months ago and I bought that DVD to deepen my practice. I have never practiced Yoga before so I cannot say something about this style in comparison with others. However I love the soft and gentle moves of Kali Ray TriYoga.

The DVD starts with rhythmic breathing. The main practices on this DVD include leg strech, reclined butterfly, cat rolls, cat bow I, mountain heel press, cat bow 2 flow, runner, triangle, side warrior, and half tortoise twist.

Kali Ray has a very gentle voice and explains the flow very nicely. If you have practiced Yoga before you should have no problems to follow her without looking on the screen. Beginners may have to watch the DVD first and then try the movements. However, no DVD will ever replace a yoga teacher who can correct you and help to improve your practices.

For me it is a very good way to practice until my next yoga class starts again in a couple of weeks :).",1092182400,8,943,4.47093023255814
