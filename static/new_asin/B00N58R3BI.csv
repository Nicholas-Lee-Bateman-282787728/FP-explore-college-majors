History and Technical Information:
This Blu-ray version (region A/B/C for North American Blu-ray players) of Puccini's Opera La Boheme was recorded in 1987 by producer Luigi Comencini on 35 mm Film with a 1.85:1 wide screen aspect ratio which fills the entire HD television screen, a major plus. The singers lip-sync very well to a studio recording they made earlier in the year for the Erato label. Shortly after the beginning of filming, Jose Carreras felt bad enough that he had to go to the hospital in Paris and was diagnosed with a deadly form of Leukemia. Jose could not continue the filming, so the scene that was already shot with Jose had to be re-shot with another opera singer/actor named Luca Canonici, who surprisingly looks like Jose. Just to be clear, Jose Carreras does do all the singing that you hear and Luca Canonici appears on the screen. The Blu-ray Version is a direct transfer of the original 35 mm film and is of very good quality. It is better than original DVD sources  and just below the quality of original full HD sources. The transfer is good enough for you to see the film grain if you get up close enough which is pretty close, I would say about 5 feet for a 55 inch full HD screen. The screens and sets have generally muted colors. The sound is very good and you can set it to a 4.0 DTS surround sound mode. The English subtitles are very good. The audio engineers paid close attention to the spaces the actors were in. For instance when inside the apartments the sound is tight with no reverberation but when at the cafe and outside the sound is more reverberant and spacious. The orchestra is fairly well recorded and the balance is weighted slightly toward the singers, but still within a good balance.

The Production:
This production places the action in Paris's Latin Quarter but in 1910 instead of the original 1840's. So in one scene you so see an old car passing by as well as horse and carriages which were still common in 1910.  The placement of the action in 1910 does not deter from the story at all as many poor Latin Quarter apartments still did not have electric lights, so use of candles were still common.  The film director does take some creative license in several scenes but they are tasteful and help explain and enhance the story line. For instance, in the first act, Mimi is shown alone in her apartment making her flowers while listening to the conversation that Rodolfo, Marcello, Schaunard and Colline are having. Generally the sets and scenes are very realistic and have a subdued beauty.

The singing and acting:
The director has chosen to couch the singing actors to subdue their facial expressions for the camera, perhaps too much at times, as I would have liked to see a little more emotion than what is revealed to the cameras. The singing by all is superb and is full of emotions. The two leads in particular are extraordinary. Barabara Hendricks's portral of Mimi is shy, timid, poised, and intelligent. When Mimi and Rodolfo meet for the first time one can see it's love at first sight. And she portrays the deterioration of her health very well. Barbara Hendricks has a beautiful velvety voice that she controls to dramatic effect especially in the final scene, which is so beautifully done by all involved. The final scene has the reflected light of the sun from a window of another building shining down through Mimi's apartment window onto Mimi as she lies dying in her bed. This is perhaps the most beautifully portrayed death scene I have ever seen or heard (except for Domingo in his RCA recording with Solti conducting). Jose Carreras sings a splendid Rodolfo, sensitive and caring. Angela Maria Blasi is splended as Musetta.

Orchestra and Conducting:
James Conlon conducts the Orchestre National de France. The orchestra performance is very good. Generally the tempos are slower than others but that helps to savor both the singers and the beautiful Paris scenes a little longer.

Conclusion:
I highly recommend this version of La Boheme on Blu-ray. It is so beautifully done all around. Also, this is a rare historical document of Carreras's singing before he fell ill and of Barabara Hendrick's  acting and singing. I never thought I would see this out on Blu-ray. If you are in the USA, be sure you buy the Region A/B/C version. It appears on the lower right back side of the case as ABC formed in a triangle.
You can purchase THE A/B/C universal version from Amazon France for around $30 including shipping, just search for the ASIN number: B00N58R3BI on the French Amazon website. The link to Amazon France is at the bottom of every Amazon page.",1444953600,6,4912,4.657439446366782
