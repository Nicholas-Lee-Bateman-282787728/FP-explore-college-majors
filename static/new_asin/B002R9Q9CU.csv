Loads of metal songs and videos that will have you screaming ""why haven't I heard of these bands before?""  I have all three volumes and all three are exceptional.",1368144000,,309,4.385964912280702
8378529,4,B002R9Q9CU,"Volume 2 is the weakest in my opinion, only because they got less on the female-fronted bands on here, and some of the ones they do have here I already have it on another DVD. I think another down side to this volume is the DVD portion got less from the last volume. Overall, volume 2 is still a good volume from a great series and that is why I still gave it a 4 star rating...for good product, quality and value. Napalm must of heard the complaints on this volume, cause they beefed it up on volume 3, which is my favorite of this series.
