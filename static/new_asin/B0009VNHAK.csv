2325133,5,B0009VNHAK,"If you like your Bigfootery laced with some humor, these two documentaries will definately do the trick.  Herriott obviously believes that Bigfoot exists, he just doesn't see anything wrong with having some fun with the subject while pondering it. In ""Squatching"", a nice combo of the serious and the comedic come together showing a bit of the humanity of various believers and skeptics.  ""Journey Toward Squatchdom"", on the other hand, is out and out funny...aimed at the fringe dwellers and shaky theories in Bigfoot Belief Land.  For those who can't stand humor with their cryptozoology, then you should DEFINATELY buy this. :) Great job on both.",1118620800,4,649,5.10377358490566
2325134,5,B0009VNHAK,"I have been interested in the subject of Bigfoot for many years now, and I have to say that of all the documentaries and films on the subject, Scott Herriott's ""Squatching"" and ""Journey Toward Squatchdom"" are two of the very best!

In ""Squatching,"" Scott takes us to various locations with his family and friends, where in candid interviews he gets their thoughts and feelings on the subject of Bigfoot.  Interlaced throughout is Scott's sense of humor, and I found myself laughing out loud often as I watched. This is not just a great Sasquatch film, but a great film period!

Now get ready to really laugh!  A lot!  ""Journey Toward Squatchdom"" is a true laugh-out-loud film that pokes fun at the subject and some of the people and places associated with Sasquatch.  Here Scott manages to do something incredible, in that he takes a subject that some take very seriously, but is able to make fun of it in such away that doesn't offend the viewers who are believers, but rather gets them to laugh along with him.  Hilarious and educational, this one is a must-see!

Whether you are well-versed in all things 'squatch, or a novice on the subject, you cannot help but be entertained by these films. I highly recommend them!",1118275200,9,1221,4.699530516431925
2325135,5,B0009VNHAK,"I love this DVD!  ""Journey Toward Squatchdom"" shows Scott Herriott's ability to take a serious and mysterious subject, and show how much fun, and how funny, the search can be.  I recommend this DVD because ""Squatching"" is something that everyone who's ever wondered if the ""big guy"" is really out there, and those who've never given it much thought, will not want to miss.  You will be entertained, plus you'll learn a great deal about this mystery.

Try this DVD.  You won't regret it I promise.",1118275200,7,496,4.72093023255814
2325136,5,B0009VNHAK,"These 2 hilarious Sasquatch ""seriocomic documentaries"" make some great late nite watching, popcorn not included. To quote Felix the Cat, ""You'll laugh so hard, your sides will ache, your heart will go pitter-pat."" Buy this great double feature from Scott Herriott, you won't regret it.",1118188800,,285,5.355555555555555
2325137,5,B0009VNHAK,"Squatching

I didn't know what to expect when I ordered Scott's DVD ""Squatching."" I had hoped that at the very least I would find some information that might satisfy my own Sasquatch curiosity. I found that and much, much more. In addition to having some interesting video clips, Scott's subtle humor in Squatching completely caught me off guard. I laughed out loud several times throughout the DVD. My wife, who does not share my hobby, also laughed with me. Squatching is an informative, hilarious look at one man's attempt to share his lifelong curiosity and his possible encounter with the animal called Sasquatch. Whether or not you have any interest in this animal, Squatching will make you laugh. If you do have an interest in this mystery, you will thoroughly enjoy Scott's narrative - and you will laugh too.  An excellent investment.

Journey to Squatchdom

This DVD is much more tongue-in-cheek than Squatching. Scott, although a believer, pokes fun at the fringe element of Bigfootery. His humor is much more overt than in Squatching, and more often than not Scott succeeds in making the watcher laugh. Scott interviews some funny folks, as well as some - odd - folks. Scott plays dress up with his girlfriend and an undisclosed third party. You will get to meet his parents and his pet dog. A very funny disc, well worth the money.

You will watch them again and again. Both are highly recommended.",1118102400,4,1411,4.838174273858921
2325138,5,B0009VNHAK,"Scott Herriott bring humor to Squatching Great movies!  I loved Journey Toward Squatchdom very funny.  Squatching needs a little help in the editing department but still great fun to view.  I hope he makes more, maybe one on Patty....

2325139,4,B0009VNHAK,"If you are looking for a DVD with credible eye witness acounts of the monster, serious investigations in the hunt for Bigfoot and to expand your knowledge about the elusive creature, then this is NOT the DVD for you. Take a trip down the lighter side in the hunt for the Squatch. You will see the Darrel Owens video of a light coloured bigfoot which is less funny than the rest of the show. A ""unique"" perspective on the Bigfoot phenomena. A good comedic jouney in the ""Hunt""? for Sasquatch.",1217462400,,491,4.466666666666667
2325140,5,B0009VNHAK,"This film was hysterically funny. Harriett does search for Bigfoot, in his own way...with a sense of humor.....This is really cute, and yes Scott a check plus is a good thing...LOL....",1213228800,,184,4.967741935483871
2325141,5,B0009VNHAK,"I bought this with the foreknowledge that it was more comedy than serious Sasquatch science however the core of the documentary was based on Scott's life changing encounter back in 1992. It was a pleasure to see that he managed to keep an intelligent sense of humor about the whole thing while still presenting present day beliefs of this wild man of the woods. I believe it's because he has not devoted every waking hour into proving the creature exists and after seeing those who have, it's a good thing. Scott obviously knows natural comedy and how to draw it out of everyday people and A superb job of editing didn't hurt either.  This DVD is worth every penny I spent and I agree with previous posts... I hope he does more of this in the future.",1180483200,,750,4.474452554744525
2325142,5,B0009VNHAK,"This movie is so interesting... With seriousness as well, regarding the mythical creature: Bigfoot. Journey Toward Squatchdom is absolutely great for lots of wild laughter throughout the whole show. I found this documentary so worth every dollar spent, and I really hope Scott Herriott will decide to make very many more...? With alot of the same attributes like this film has.

  Possibly with some more investigations into the area of the 1967 Patterson/Gimlin film.  I think he could pull it off with ease.

 This DVD is great for EVERYONE who enjoys a good laugh! EVEN IF YOU DON'T THINK SASQUATCHES REALLY EXISTS !!!",1170288000,,621,4.980582524271845
2325143,5,B0009VNHAK,"I never laughed so hard about bigfoot before. this dvd is great, the first half is more straight forward but the second half is damn funny! recommended for EVERYONE with a good sense of humor. 5stars!",1167091200,,200,4.583333333333333
2325144,4,B0009VNHAK,"Breaking into two parts, first the ""Squatching"" part gets 4 stars and covers what is a typical foray into the woods on a weekend search for the elusive critters. This is well done albeit a tiny bit lacking in substance. Would like to have seen a bit more about his own 'footage' that was shot with Daryl Owen. Herriott references the video and shows a scrap of it but I'd like to have seen more analysis of it. Still it's good.

Second part is for ""Journey to Squatchdom"" which is a humerous take on the elusive critters. This segment gets a good solid 5 stars as it is quite funny and is willing to poke fun at himself as a ""bigfoot investigator"". I feel this is how most of society would view what sasquatch researchers actually do. It's not but man, Herriott sure makes it entertaining to those people that do do it this way.

Overall both segments are good for different reasons. Worth picking up at any rate.",1154908800,,913,4.396449704142012
2325145,5,B0009VNHAK,"This double-DVD is really well-crafted, and Scott Herriott really uses a good deal of comedic elements to make his point. ""Squatching"" is seriocomic, and describes Scott's true passion for the subject of Sasquatch. It's a little more serious than ""Journey Toward Squatchdom"", but it does have comedic moments. We meet his mom and dad, his girlfriend, even his dog. We also meet other well-known Bigfoot personalities along the way, such as Loren Coleman, William Dranginis, Dr. John Bindernagel and Craig Woolheater, and get to see some really beautiful country in northern California. ""Journey Toward Squatchdom"" is so much funnier than ""Squatching"". It really showcases Scott's comedic talents and is genuinely hilarious. We meet more Bigfoot personalities, such as Ray Crowe, the late Datus Perry and Frank Kaneaster. I laughed out loud more than once watching this documentary. If you like serious, scientific documentaries on Sasquatch, buy ""Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science"". But, if you want to watch a semiserious documentary that will make you laugh your butt off, this is the one to buy!",1129507200,6,1096,5.341040462427745
2325146,5,B0009VNHAK,"I can't remember the last time I laughed this hard!  Absolutely hilarious!  Highly recommended--for the believer or not.

Scott ... please make another BF documentary!",1121126400,,167,5.6

8067511,5,B0009VNHAK,"Thanks Scott Herriott, I appreciated the person note on the envelope. It's a good documentary, and a little known bigfoot story!  :)  The video evidence presented is fairly useless from an evidence standpoint, but that can be said for just about all bigfoot videos. Still very compelling.",1403222400,,288,5.1063829787234045
8067512,5,B0009VNHAK,"Scott Herriott has a great sense of humor, and this documentary shows it. Fun fun fun to watch.  Some serious clips mixed with a little poking fun at some of us in the ""Squatch"" community. A must see.",1390348800,,200,4.2631578947368425
8067513,2,B0009VNHAK,"It just wasn't that entertaining.  I still haven't found stuff that is good.  I did love the tv show In Search Of, when I was a kid.  Some of the Monsterquests are pretty good.  But this movie wasn't memorable.",1385942400,,210,4.3076923076923075
8067514,5,B0009VNHAK,"Absolutely a fantastic disk!  The first series has great dry humor and people.  Well shot and completely enjoyable!  A good, honest break from the usual bigfoot ""B"" movies that proliferate the market, and yet-it does have a story.  The second series-""Journey Toward Squatchdom"" is by itself-well worth the price...  I haven't laughed so hard in years.  A mild warning though:  Don't be drinking hot liquids while watching.  Really-it was just that damn good!  Thanks Scott!!!",1349308800,,475,5.226666666666667
8067515,5,B0009VNHAK,"Even if you're not a Bigfoot enthusiast, this is very entertaining.
The crazy world of Squatchdom in a no BS kinda way... while still having a great sense of humor
about sightings and the people involved.  Wish there we more in this series.
Very Funny. I'd like to check-out the other DVD's by Scott Herriott... the ""Walk"" series.",1323043200,,330,4.689655172413793
8067516,5,B0009VNHAK,"After years of following the Bigfoot phenomenon, its always good to see someone that is not afraid of viewing the evidence and interviewing the ""experts"" while gently rolling his eyes. This is a field where year after year the supposed experts have made outlandish and unqualified generalizations with absolutely minimal evidence to back it up.  Scott has created a clever and fun documentary about a subject that many of us hope is real. Sit back, put your feet up and prepare to laugh a little bit. When its all said and done you will have learned a little bit about Sasquatch and a whole lot about some people who are obsessed by it all.",1307145600,2,640,4.614035087719298
8067517,5,B0009VNHAK,"I love this movie.  Scott Harriott is a comedy genius.  He had a real encounter and believes in Bigfoot, but he made this documentry on how most people perceive the people looking for bigfoot.  It is Pure Gold!!",1296432000,,211,4.5
8067518,4,B0009VNHAK,The first video is actually worth watching.  Interesting to see the difference between the two videos.  The first video he is mocking the BF phenomenon.  The second he is actually changed after having an encounter.,1257724800,,214,5.057142857142857
8067519,5,B0009VNHAK,Both films were very enjoyable.  Scott keeps it fun while making it interesting at the same time.  And the service was excellent.  I ordered my copy one evening and was watching it at home less than 2 days later.,1243209600,,212,4.384615384615385
