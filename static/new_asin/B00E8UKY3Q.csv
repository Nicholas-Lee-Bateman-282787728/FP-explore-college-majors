5897268,2,B00E8UKY3Q,"The success of Peyo's late 1950s Belgian comic book strip, adopted in English as The Smurfs, spawned a successful 1980s animated series - a television show that ran for nearly ten years and is still broadcast as reruns today.  Due to the popularity of the animated series, which many consider to be one of the greatest animated shows of all-time, several movies, music albums, video games, and other countless forms of memorabilia were created, all eventually leading to the 2011 live action feature film.  While the film, starring Neil Patrick Harris, Hank Azaria, Jayma Mays, and Sofia Vergara, was utterly discouraging and painfully awful to sit through, the film still went on to gross more than $560 million.  Naturally, Sony Pictures Animation could not ignore the hefty payday, quickly giving the green light for a sequel, and setting a release date two years later.  Well, two years have passed, and the Smurfs are back in The Smurfs 2.

Raja Gosnell (The Smurfs, Home Alone 3) returns to direct the sequel, which once again stars Neil Patrick Harris as Patrick, Hank Azaria as Gargamel, and Jamya Mays as Grace.  Since the conclusion of the first film, Gargamel has been using his remaining power as a magic act - earning himself fame and fortune.  However, he still has it out for the Smurfs and concocts a plan to kidnap Smurfette (Katy Perry) on her birthday in hopes of extracting the formula from her to make his evil ""naughties,"" Vexy (Christina Ricci) and Hackus (J.B. Smoove), into Smurfs.  Naturally, this would allow Gargamel to create an army of his own Smurfs - of which he would then steal their essence and use the endless power to rule the world.  It's up to Papa Smurf (Jonathan Winters) and a handful of other Smurfs, along with the help of Patrick, Jamya, and Patrick's stepfather, Victor (Brendan Gleeson), to stop Gargamel before he is able to extract the formula.  The voices of Alan Cumming, Anton Yelchin, George Lopez, and Frank Welker also star in supporting roles.

For those wondering if the sequel is just as painful to sit through as the original:  the answer is yes.  However, everyone needs to keep in mind that this film is not intended for the enjoyment of adults.  The film's target audience is kids between the ages of four and ten years old.  After ten years old, the odds of your children calling this film ""lame"" dramatically increases.  Still, the sequel does offer much more comedy than its predecessor, mainly from Hank Azaria's role as the eccentric wizard, Gargamel, and his evil cat, Azrael (voiced by Frank Welker).  Oddly enough, there's something funny about Gargamel getting hit by a bus and having a talking cat ask him if he's dead.  Regardless, their brief cracks and gags are isolated and scattered throughout the flick, adding a touch of enjoyment at timely moments, even though you'll have already lost all hope of enjoyment when they unexpectedly put a smile on your face.  Even though there are brief shades of light with the use of humor, this nearly hour and a half film will still conspicuously feel like three.

Much like the first film, the sequel's cast is much too talented to be used in such a lackluster setting.  Both Neil Patrick Harris and Jayma Mays, two intensely popular TV personalities, waste their craft on roles that relatively no one will appreciate.  The same can be said for the numerous voice actors used in the film, including Alan Cumming and Anton Yelchin.  And, for reasons beyond comprehension, the film uses several other high profile Hollywood personalities, such as Jeff Foxworthy, Mario Lopez, Jimmy Kimmel, and Shaquille O'Neal, in brief voice cameos as many of the Smurf voices.

Speaking of voice roles, there's something immensely annoying about Katy Perry's role in the film.  It's not as though she does a poor job in the role as Smurfette per say, but this is just another occasion where one of the many voice actresses out there should have been cast in the role of Smurfette instead of a recording artist.  Not only do many of these ""musicians"" have to be successful at making their head-pounding drivel, but they also have to cross over into acting to steal a job that would have easily been better suited for someone with more experience...or talent.  Seriously, it's not as if a six year old is really going to care that Katy Perry is voicing one of the Smurfs.  Sadly, this is common practice for the majority of the animated features being released these days.

Overall, it's hard to pick on a film that adults are not meant to enjoy.  The Smurfs are beloved childhood characters and to be honest, it's nice to see they're still popular today.  For many of us, The Smurfs were something we grew up watching, so there's something nostalgic about another generation also having the opportunity to enjoy these tiny, blue characters.  Most young children should get a kick out of this film, especially if the first film's DVD is sitting on your shelf and has gotten plenty of use.  No, this won't be an ideal trip to the movie theater for parents, and the overuse of the word ""Smurf"" will most likely annoy you, but the odds are you'll kids will appreciate that you sat through this generic family adventure.  Think of this film as being courteous enough to provide you with several opportunities to get popcorn refills.  In any event, it would appear The Smurfs are destined for another hefty payday with this sequel - and yet another sequel in the summer of 2015.

On a side note, this was the final role for the late Jonathan Winters, who was the voice of Papa Smurf in both live action films, as well as Grandpa Smurf for three years of the animated series.  He was a beloved comedian that made millions laugh, and inspired the work of some of Hollywood's A-list comedians, including Robin Williams and Bill Cosby.

5897269,3,B00E8UKY3Q,"Smurfette is taken by Gargamel to Paris where he is now a popular illusionist ""with the help from his magic wand."" He wants her to tell him how Papa Smurf made her blue, so he can make the pale Smurfs he made, blue. Then he can use their essence for even more powerful magic.
  Papa, Vanity, Grumpy and Clumsy come to the rescue and recruit Patrick (Neil Patrick Harris) to help, for no good reason. Unfortunate to Patrick, his step-dad Victor (Brendan Gleason) wants to tag along. Victor means well but always messes up. While Smurfette starts thinking of Gargamel and his 2 creations as family, thinking the Smurf's don't want her since she thinks the Smurfs forgot her Birthday.
  Just like the first, the movie is mildly amusing. But despite Neil Patrick Harris and Brendan Gleason having good scenes together their characters weren't necessary.  The movie taking place in Paris was pretty pointless too. The movie was okay I think, but the show is still much much much much better. Since the show show was a fantasy/adventure. Not a goofy comedy/fantasy with the Smurfs constantly in the real world site seeing in NY and Paris.
  If a part 3 is made, they need to just stay in the Smurf land, have new villains and friends from the show, like Big Mouth and Hagatha and have Yo Han and Pee Wee instead of Neil Patrick Harris and Gargamel. We don't need Smurfs 3 in Japan or Iraq.",1375228800,4,1383,4.574898785425101
5897270,4,B00E8UKY3Q,"Feeling Blue? Join the exciting adventures of our stalwart crew as they join forces to rescue Smurfette, who knows a secret....

The opening credits feature pop-up pages in a child's book. Every child in the screening audience recognized them right away. In fact, other than the toddler who was instantly (and vocally) bored, the rug-rats seemed very involved; they were quiet and well-behaved. These opening credits, by the way, are the only time I felt the 3D was used to any special effect. It's lovely for the travelogue/story that follows, but it does NOT enhance the plot.

New Yorkers Patrick and Grace dash off to Paris to help their friends when Smurfette needs to be rescued. To me, the joy was to recognize Montmartre, the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, the Arc de Triomphe, the Champs-lyses, Jardin des Tuileries, and Place de la Concorde, with a few more thrown in for good measure! (Like the ferris wheel that seems to come and go in Paris these days.)

We saw:
  * Neil Patrick Harris (""The Smurfs"") as Patrick, the Smurfs' Number One friend who helps them when sweet little Smurfette is lured away by the evil wizard's cute henchmen.
  * Jayma Mays (""The Smurfs"") is Grace, Patrick's wife, and mother to their four-year-old boy named Blue.
  * Hank Azaria (""The Smurfs"") is Gargamel, the evil wizard who needs two things: 1) The Secret Formula, and 2) the ""Essence"" of a few Smurfs.
  * Brendan Gleeson (""The Guard"") is Victor, Patrick's most UNwelcome step-father, who has all the finesse of a bull in a china shop.
  * Katy Perry (Lots of TV) is the voice for Smurfette.
  * An amazing Computer Generated cat. Technology wins again!

The Smurfs each have their own personalities and are portrayed by ""name brand"" actors. I won't go into that here, as there is nothing distinctive to note. You can review their names and characters when you get the DVD from Amazon.

The message in this movie is that parents love their adopted children as though they are their own. Not a bad thing...",1375056000,10,1997,4.72543352601156

5897306,5,B00E8UKY3Q,"It may sound strange to say this about a Smurf movie, but Brendan Gleeson offers a wonderful performance in this film. Much like Nathan Lane in the Birdcage, Gleeson present the hopeful, loving, desperation that is hard to explain, except maybe to parents in a similar situation. With the exception of the phrase, ""I didn't have to,"" everything about Brendan Gleeson performance rings true, especially about a parent's love being unconditional.
While the other actors did a fine job with performances appropriate to a Smurf film, Mr. Gleeson's performance is worthy of award recognition, in my humble opinion.",1489795200,,609,5.224489795918367

5897364,4,B00E8UKY3Q,"A cute little movie where Smurfette gets to shine. You also get to meet another female smurf(sorta). The cat is, as always, hilarious. Bad influences, peer pressure, obeying adults, right and wrong, friendship and discovering oneself are all in this movie. On the surface though it's just plain cute. A good film for kids and for adults who remember when cartoons only came on once a week!",1450742400,2,389,4.82089552238806

5897378,2,B00E8UKY3Q,I loved the cartoon when I was a kid as it was def a Saturday morning staple and while I am a fan and anxiously awaited the first movie this one did not live up to the first. It seemed at least to me a looong movie...and the jokes fell flat except again for Azreal who again got the best part of the movie just like the first.  Yes this was cute and took me back to a time I loved I just thought to me that the first one was enough and this was just not necessary.,1440460800,3,464,3.7346938775510203
5897379,5,B00E8UKY3Q,"My toddler loves it!
The storyline starts when the first movie left. We can see more of Azrael and Gargamel alone which I think is a lot of fun.

Additionally, it is one of the few movies available in multilingual version, meaning that you can have the audio/subtitles in Spanish, French and English. After all, the Smurfs were created in Europe!

This is from a 4 year-old that loves movies, has watched all of Spectacular Spider-man series, Green Lantern TAS, all Disneys, all Barbie films and particularly the first Smurfs move.

while others in the family watched.",1393200000,,128,4.16
5897556,3,B00E8UKY3Q,"The Smurfs 2 is watchable once, but not the brilliant adaptation of the 80's cartoon TV show that the first movie was.  This was pretty predictable, even before Papa and the other smurfs left the village once again for the human world in pursuit of the kidnapped Smurfette, you knew exactly how this would end, including for the two new Gargamel creation characters.  I did like how we got to see Smurfette as the black haired, non blue being before she became a smurf, and for the new generation discovering the Smurfs who didn't grow up with the cartoon, learning how she came to be would be pretty cool to discover. Besides the predictability factor for me the storyline was a bit flat, Smurfette seemed a lot dumber in this one than the previous film and needed to be for the film's plot to work.  Neil Patrick Harris seemed to have a lot less screen time and Glee's Jayma Mays was hardly in it at all, apart from one trying to find Gargamel's hotel room number scene. She pretty much just looks after her kid in the hotel room away from the action (except to be randomly walking down the same Paris street with the kid at the end of the film which just so happens to be the exact place in the whole of Europe's second largest city where final events took place for a goodbye teary reunion with the smurfs). Why would you bring a young child with you on a quest to save the future of mankind? The first movie had a lot more human characters and actors such as Sofia Vergara to interact with Gargamel and encounter the smurfs than this sequel, which spent a lot of its time inside a hotel room or Gargamel's laboratory. Obviously the budget wasn't as big this time round.  That was a shame as it would have been good to see Parisians' reactions to the appearance of these little blue creatures, to the extent as we did in New York. There's a cool scene involving a ferris wheel but other than that and the Eifel, we don't see much of Paris.  Also the smurfs who went to Paris played no vital role in the plot, they didn't really need to be there, it's only Papa who has some interaction with Smurfette before the end scene so Papa Smurf really could have just left them at home.  They weren't really the best personality smurfs to use either, Vanity, what did he bring to the screen?  No wonder they still used Brainy on the DVD cover, even though he never left the mushroom village.

The biggest disappointment was Azrael, who for me was the standout best and funniest character surprise of the first film.  This sequel's version seemed to lack a lot of the personality and behaved more like a real cat.  In the special features that came with the Australian version of this they show the filming of Azrael and it seems to be they more concentrated on the cat looking real than it being funny.  A lot of the scenes they just used a real cat and animated a face on top of it.  The first film Azrael was moving around like a cartoon cat would, this one there was maybe one or two funny moments for the feline character, but other than that he was really just someone for Gargamel to talk to instead of out loud to himself.  Gargamel too lost a lot of screen time, replaced by his two new creations, the funniest scenes were when he wasn't actually trying to do anything with the smurfs and was just performing at the theatre as a magician, or making the public kneel before him using magic on the sidewalks.  His dream of world domination and milking the smurf essence seemed a bit pointless being he was already the biggest star on the planet and could make anyone do whatever he wanted already.

The sequel is worth watching once, but unlike the first film isn't really worth watching again, thereby owning.",1393113600,,3711,4.4208211143695015

If you liked the first, you will probably enjoy this to a point, but will also feel the sequel-let-down in some way.

5897647,2,B00E8UKY3Q,"The Smurfs were a staple on Saturday mornings in the 80's and I was extremely familiar with them growing up. And the movies revived the characters with the live action aspect.

However, while the cast (including voice actors) is mostly good, the story and writing are just average. Although our kids enjoyed it, the movie was not as funny as I expected (or hoped).

The unique Smurf characters have their moments, although I think more could have been done with them (aside from Grumpy Smurf's temporary positive attitude). The villainy is too cartoonish, as if the writers were trying too hard to make it that way. I would not have been surprised if an ""Acme"" brand anvil showed up. I get it, it's a mix of cartoon with live action, you can't be too ""real"" but it was way over the top cartoon action.

And the story was pretty lame. The story of Smurfette (which had always puzzled me during the heyday of the cartoons) and how she became a Smurf didn't even keep my interest. Blah, blah, blah Gargamel evil....blah, blah, blah, Gargamel wants to capture Smurfs.

If you have kids, they might enjoy it, but as parents, you'll likely groan your way through it like we did and hope the kids never want to watch it again.",1388966400,,1219,4.552511415525114

5897661,3,B00E8UKY3Q,"Yes, it can be a blue Christmas at your house if you have kids and if they tend to like those adorable little creations known as Smurfs. That's because the movie SMURFS 2 has just come out on DVD. In the long run kids will love it and adults will find it slightly amusing. What could make a better Christmas gift?

I'll admit that I didn't see the first Smurfs movie but after watching this one I don't think it matters. We all know a little about them from years of Smurf cartoons and the like. This time around it is nearly Smurfette's birthday. The only female Smurf we know of, the rest of the Smurfs are busy planning a surprise birthday party for her. Unfortunately this leads her to believe everyone has forgotten about her.

Smurfette reflects on how she came to be, how the evil sorcerer Gargamel created her as an evil alternative to the Smurfs. But when she got to spend time with the Smurfs she changed for the better. Now she's afraid of becoming what she once was all over again.

About the same time this is going on, Gargamel is now in our world and playing to sell out crowds around the world as the most amazing magician known to man. The secret of his magical abilities lies in the fact that he is using Smurf essence to power his magic wand. But the amount of essence he has is dwindling so he creates new Smurfs, evil ones called Naughties named Vexy and Hackus. The problem is that they don't provide the pure essence that a real Smurf does so Gargamel sets out to recapture Smurfette and use her to alter his newest creations. If he can capture them all that works too and gives him the ability to rule the world.

A portal is made and Smurfette is brought back to our world in Paris where she spends time with Vexy and Hackus. They become friends and the duo tries to show her just how much fun being bad can be. Gargamel pretends to like her and cater to her needs in the hope that she'll lure the other Smurfs here.

Back in their own world the Smurfs realize Smurfette has been kidnapped and set out to rescue her. The problem is there are only enough special crystals for 4 of them to go. Led by Papa Smurf they head out to the home of Patrick (Neil Patrick Harris), the same human that helped them in the first film. When the explain what is going on Patrick, the Smurfs and his family, including the step father that Patrick has issues with (Brendan Gleason) all head for France.

Confusion reigns supreme from that moment forward as with most movies made these days for the under 10 crowd. The movie does take on some serious topics though as Smurfette must deal with being good or bad. At the same time her new friends learn what it's like to be around someone who is nice. And Patrick and his step father learn that all is not what it seems when it comes to memories of what happened in their past together.

The movie offers some good CGI animation (like most kids movies these days) and the comic moments involving the Smurfs is sure to bring out a number of laughs from the kids. The jokes may not be as amusing to adults, but they aren't so bad as to cause the continuous eye rolls that some movies do. The story lines are sure to create open ends to discussions you can have with your kids about being good or bad and about knowing what really happened in the past versus what they remember happened. Watch and you'll understand what I'm talking about.

All in all if you have kids this is a movie I'm sure you'll want to add to their collection. And if you're a Smurf lover you'll find yourself in Heaven watching their antics once again.

5897675,5,B00E8UKY3Q,"I actually saw The Smurfs 2 in theaters prior to seeing the Smurfs 1 on DVD.  As a child, I was a fan of these magical little blue creatures.  My daughter had an invitation to go to the movies to see the Smurfs 2 and when I told her what she was going to see, she said ""What's a Smurf?""  Ever since then, all I hear about is Vexy, Smurfette, and the rest of the crew.

The Smurfs 2 is primarily set in Paris which is sort of fun.  The movie starts out in Smurf village with Smurfette having a nightmare that she is naughty again (apparently she has this nightmare every year on her birthday).  She thinks the rest of the Smurfs forgot her birthday when really they are planning a big surprise party.  Meanwhile, Gargamel is a famous magician performing in Paris and has created two new Smurfs (called Naughties), Vexy and Hackus (or as my daughter called them, the ""beige Smurfs"").  They are naughty but Vexy is always trying to please Gargamel, with little success.  They also enjoy tormenting the cat, Azrael.  Gargamel opens a portal to Smurf Village but is too big to fit through so Vexy goes instead and brings back Smurfette quickly.  Papa and the others hatch a plan to rescue Smurfette but just as they are about to use Papa's ""Smurfportation crystals"", Clumsy trips and the wrong Smurfs go to find ""Master Winslow"" (Neil Patrick Harris) who just had a birthday party for his child, Blue.

The Smurfs (Papa, Vanity, Clumsy, Grouchy (aka Positive Smurf)), Master Winslow, his stepdad Victor, wife Grace, and Blue all get to Paris where they focus on rescuing Smurfette.  There is a good message in there about accepting your family for who they are and finding the good in people.  At the same time, Smurfette escapes but Vexy (who is her sister) and Hackus (their brother) trick her into helping them.  Smurfette struggles between wanting to be a good, true blue Smurf and her naughty side.

Ultimately, Gargamel is after the formula for how to turn the naughties into real Smurfs so he can extract their essence and use it to make himself the most powerful man in the world.  Smurfette is forced to give him Papa's formula in order to save the naughties as they will die without it.  The rest of the crew eventually gets there and they defeat Gargamel in the end (of course).  The Naughties turn blue and become real Smurfs (and have become good by the end of the movie) and they all go back to Smurf village.

I would recommend this movie as long as you understand that it is definitely a movie for kids and just go in expecting a few laughs.  This is basically brain candy with a sweet message and some slapstick comedy.  Enjoy the nostalgia of the Smurfs updated for modern kids and know that it's just meant to be fun.

5897712,1,B00E8UKY3Q,"I purchased this for my friend's five-year-old son, a kid who falls perfectly into the film's target audience. He was thrilled! He loves the Smurfs (to the point where he will even debate with you as to whether the cartoon show or the CGI movies are better).

Unfortunately, he and I can now agree on one thing smurf-related; the Smurfs 2 really smurfed. For him, it was boring. For me, it was painful.

First, The movie uses the word ""smurf"" excessively. It's smurfing smurfety smurfness was not a pleasure to listen to. In fact, many of the phrases in the film used to cater to adult humor just plain fell flat.

Now, the basic plot is that Gargamel kidnaps Smurfette in order to get the formula that will turn the Naughties - named Vexy and Hackus - into `real' Smurfs. The other smurfs and Neil Patrick Harris want to get Smurfette back. Smurfette spends the movie struggling with whether to help the Naughties and whether she likes being a nice little Smurfette.

This would seem all well and good, if the movie actually vetted out the plot in a slightly less obvious way. The 5 year old predicted what would happen about ten minutes in. And when faced with Smurfette's conundrum, he asked ""Why doesn't she just bring them back to the Smurf Village and be friends. Everybody's naughty sometimes""

Good question...and something I address in the spoiler below.

Yes, the Naughties are amusing characters and they really raise that age-old question of why be good, when being naughty is much more fun. It is the Naughties who supply the only interesting comedic bits of this film, while Gargamel is relegated to slapstick and it is the Naughties who are really the heart of this film. Sadly, watching Smurfette figuring out whether she wants to help the Naughties and thus indirectly help Gargamel, was basically like having viewers watch her argue with mini devil and mini angel versions of herself.

Now, I know this movie is intended for kids. Which is why I normally go into such films with the thought of sit back, relax, and just giggle when you see a talking cat. It's fun to be able to share laughter with kids and see the light in their eyes when they are enjoying themselves, the way you used to enjoy watching this stuff. Kids movies aren't supposed to be crazy complicated. They also aren't meant to cater to adult humor. But they should make a kid happy, or sad, or excited about what's on the screen.

The Smurfs 2 didn't do that for the kid I bought this for. He thought that Smurfette was being ""stupid"" and that Gargamel wasn't any fun this time around. And I have to agree with him.

Spoiler:

The thing that really peeved me and perhaps the main reason this film is getting one instead of two stars from me, is the message this movie sends to kids. The whole movie is about finding a formula to change the skin color of the Naughties because doing so will make them good, not bad. AKA the reason Smurfette can't bring the Naughties back to the Smurfs is because they aren't blue. Because they aren't blue they are bad and it's why they act naughty. And of course, in the end, the Naughties are accepted by the Smurfs village ONLY AFTER THEY CHANGE THEIR SKIN COLOR, and thus, have become good.

What a great message to send to a little boy, right?

In short, it's a sad day for the Smurfs.",1386374400,10,3310,4.535234899328859

I will readily admit to being a big fan of what are generally considered to be kids' movies (Disney, Despicable Me, Shrek, etc.).

5897718,4,B00E8UKY3Q,"It's another time-traveling trip for the Smurfs (though thankfully not in the same fashion as the dreaded final season of the Smurfs cartoon show that pulled its plug), but this time it's to rescue Smurfette, who seems to be having issues over who's her real family -- the Smurfs or her creator Gargamel with his new creations, the Naughties. Again Gargamel is after the Smurfs for stealing their essence to power up his magic (instead of his usual purpose of making the Philosopher's Stone as in the comic books and the cartoon show), and again we have the Winslows along for the ride, this time with their son Blue and Patrick's stepfather Victor Doyle for the respective additions of charm and embarrassment. Throughout the story, Smurfette, Patrick Winslow, and the Naughties get to learn the lesson that family isn't about who brought you into this world, but who really cares for you as a person and who wants to see you grow as a person. Besides this, the movie still has its share of laughs from the previous movie, even if the number of Smurfs that appear in it is still limited to the five that are the main focus of the story, with the others (such as the former leads Brainy and Gutsy) having minor or even cameo roles.

Unfortunately for the movie series, which is now being cancelled in favor of an all-CGI reboot by Sony Pictures, the time-traveling Smurfs-in-the-modern-world story aspect is perhaps in my book its biggest failing, as though the production crew has to rely on that kind of story to justify the budget they were given to create a good live-action/CGI-animated movie of a lesser scope than Peter Jackson's interpretation of the J.R.R. Tolkien Hobbit/Lord Of The Rings medieval fantasy series. Once was pretty much enough, and twice was pushing it. Hopefully with the reboot the Smurfs will be brought back to having stories taking place solely in the medieval fantasy Europe world that they came from, but who knows?",1383436800,,1947,4.794642857142857

Yes, the arch nemesis Gargamel is back and has never more creatively being played by Hank Azaria (The Simpsons, Godzilla) who is masterfully reprising his role and obviously having  a lot of fun doing it too. You see Gargamel wants to harness the magic power of the Smurfs to increase his wizardry powers to the point in which he can control the entire world. (Insert maniacal laugh here.) However, currently he is a now world-famous magician travelling around and  using what is very little left of his Smurf position. They all end up in Paris, France this time!

He ends up creating two new Smurf's that are greyish in color and require the magic Smurf liquid to survive and they are to be considered the `dark' side of what a Smurf can be. Christina Ricci (Sleepy Hallow, Monster) is the voice of Vexy, the spicy and nasty female version of Smurfette. Hackus, the fumbling, not-so-bright `dark' version of a Smurf is voiced by J.B. Smoove (SNL, Date Night).

Vexy kidnaps Smurfette who is once again amazingly voiced by Katie Perry (The Ugly Truth, Madagascar 3), under the orders of Gargamel and the adventure ensues! In his last screen performance, Jonathan Winters (The Flintstones, Davis Rules) just before his passing, again reprises his heartfelt role of Papa Smurf. Also back are the always moody Grumpy Smurf voiced by George Lopez (Rio, Valentine's Day), the never intended to do anything wrong - Clumsy Smurf voiced by Anton Yelchin (Star Trek, Fight Night), the proudly Scottish Gusty Smurf voiced by Alan Cummings (X2, Goldeneye) and we are introduced to the extremely narcissistic new blue Smurf, Vanity Smurf voiced by John Oliver (The Daily Show, The Love Guru).

Yes, Neil Patrick Harris (How I Met Your Mother, Doogie Houser) and Jayma Mays (Glee,Mall Cop) are back as the parents of Blu who is now 6 years old and is played by Jacob Tremblay (The Magic Ferret, Motive).  They are all eventually needed to help Papa Smurf find out where Gargamel has captured and imprisoned Smurfette. Neil does a wonderfully believable job as a father with issues with his own father and coping with being a father himself, is just not easy.

Now here's where the movie takes a turn for the absolute better. Its real story is about family and what children mean to their fathers. How communication can sometimes be miss-interpreted and as often is the case, sometime parents do things that appear cruel to their children in order to protect them. In the long run, love has no boundaries. How is his introduced?

Both Papa Smurf, Neil Patrick Harris and Neil's characters stepfather Victor, played wonderfully by Brendan Gleeson (Gangs of New York, Troy), all learn a valuable lesson of family and parenting. Again, it's extremely heartfelt and coupled with Smurfette learning about her new `sister' in Vexy, the film is a wonderful uplifting family treat. Forget Pacific Rim, see something you'll actually remember and feel good about! Smurf-tacular!",1375660800,4,3345,4.864674868189807
5897726,5,B00E8UKY3Q,This movie entertained my entire family.  Not only did the kids laugh but monm and dad laughed good and hard too.  How can you go wrong with slap-stick and well written dialouge.  What more needs to be said then Gargamel does a spot on impression of Darth Vader!  This was probably the best family film so far this summer.,1375660800,5,322,4.406779661016949
5897727,1,B00E8UKY3Q,"Look, I like smurfs.

I love the iPhone app, the original French cartoons and comics, and the TV show is good too. What I do NOT like are lame jokes, thinly-masked foul language, poor acting, and no semblance of a script.

To me, there is no more embarrassing job than being forced to act with small, computer generated animals. See: Alvin and the Chipmunks (somehow I managed to like that movie), The Smurfs, and Yogi Bear. Watching Neil Patrick Harris, a good comedic actor who had the ONLY funny scenes in the first movie, act like a complete idiot with these CGI creatures crawling around...well, it's just sad.

And what about the thinly veiled foul language? ""I almost smurfed myself"", ""That was ducked up"", ""Are you smurfing kidding?"", ""holy smurf,"" ""we're smurfed,"" ""I really smurfed myself,"" ""son of a smurf"", ""where the smurf are we?"" ""up the smurfing creek without a paddle,"" ""smurf me!"" and ""I'll be smurfed!""

You know, before you know it, your kids will be coming home saying ""I don't want my smurfing dinner, you smurfing SMURF!"" What would you reply to that?

In conclusion, and to speak in a more relevant fashion, Smurfs 2 is pure smurfing smurf. I wouldn't smurfing watch this smurf if my smurf was on fire. It's just smurfity smurf smurf, and what a smurf it smurfing is! I give this 1 Smurf out of 5 Smurfs.

PROS: I guess the least demanding of all kids will like this. Better take them to see this then 2 Guns. And Neil Patrick Harris and Hank Azaria are game as usual. And fans of the first movie will like it too. Just not any one who fancies themselves a fan of good cinema.",1375574400,,1600,4.5190311418685125
5897728,2,B00E8UKY3Q,"I was not a fan of the first Smurfs, 6/10 but he sequel is very disappointing because it never focuses on anything ever , I wanted to no more of the story of where Smurfette slowly becomes a naughty and develops a bond with Vexy and Hagus , but then they would focus on The family aspect and forget completely about the fact that Gargamel is popular and he shouldn't even be well like somebody should of seen him being evil by turning Patricks step dad into a duck (even though it is not that evil but just something that you should not do ) , and the movie has horrible pacing like one scene there flying on hires then there on a rolercoaster then in a sewer . Also since it is a smurfs movie , it should be really light hearted but its really dark here which is disappointing. I give this movie a 5/10",1375401600,3,803,4.1210191082802545
5897729,5,B00E8UKY3Q,"My daughter was anxious to see this, because since childhood, she was a big fan of anything Smurfs. This is a fun-filled, entertaining adventure for children, and anyone who loves the Smurfs. In comparison to other other Smurf movies, we found this one to be quite enjoyable. The colorful characters are funny, and the story is exciting. For those who have been huge Smurf fans over the years, you will not be disappointed. We will watch this one again as she loves anything Smurf. Enjoyable for family fun as well with the young children. Delightful, and sound effects are awesome. Highly recommended!",1375228800,8,602,4.911764705882353

None of us could tolerate more than 15 minutes. It totally ripped off the story arc of Lost Village and the combination of live action with CGI was very difficult to view. Not only that, but the dialogue was bad as was the editing. Dont waste your time or money.",1527984000,,416,4.085365853658536
