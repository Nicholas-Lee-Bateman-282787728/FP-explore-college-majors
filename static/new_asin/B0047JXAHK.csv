8418229,5,B0047JXAHK,"These Rex Allen movies are little gems. Slim Pickens is his side-kick, the comic stunts are a little corny, but so what! It is very entertaining, the plots really keep you on the edge of your seat. The bad guys are really, really bad, and the good guys are the opposite. There is always a message in the episode, with a fair degree of forgiveness extended to the bad guys at times. Rex has a great, great voice. If you don't know, try to guess where you have heard that deep melodious voice of his somewhere. When you figure it out, and if you happen to be a ""Boomer"", you will be pleasantly surprised. It will bring back a few memories.

All in all, it's great entertainment! And most of his movies are on Prime, as well as the Roy Rogers' movies. Another great reason to be a Prime subscriber!",1439596800,,795,4.3
