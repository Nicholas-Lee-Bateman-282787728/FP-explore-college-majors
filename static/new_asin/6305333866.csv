7887849,4,6305333866,"I saw this many years ago, probably on VHS which seems to be its only format. As other reviews attest, it's a low budget and very dark film about two wayward women in the deep South who go on a spree that makes Thelma & Louise look like a Disney film. The great Larry Brown (rip) has a cameo, as does, interestingly, the actor who plays Ernest in those silly movies. There are a few problems with this film, as with any, but they are minor. I don't want to spoil anything but there's a particularly tragic victim of the women who keeps his injury kind of secret, which only adds to the disturbingness of this film. This is not your feel-good, Waltons, poor-but-happy Southern film. This is your Harry Crews, grit lit, dirty, degenerate, abusive South, and I highly recommend it.",1496966400,,778,4.485915492957746

It didn't delve into the relationship between Rae and Carla, which seems to suggest at something more intimate but nothing was answered or confirmed. The ending raised more questions and had no answers to what happened after the shootings and what happened to Rae's father, played by Jim Varney. I can see how suffering all of the physical and mental abuse from her father would drive Rae over the edge but I felt it wasn't explained as thoroughly as it should have been. There were some holes in the plot. With that said, I'll admit that I had my reservations about watching this movie at all, mainly because of Jim Varney's role as an abusive, incestuous father, something I'm definitely not used to. Curiosity won over my hesitation and I'm glad it did. Mr. Varney was truly the most gifted, multi-faceted actor I've ever had the privilege of watching. While he wasn't the star of the show and only had a small part, he completely outshone the other stars. His powerful on screen presence overshadowed Rae and Carla. With only a small role, Varney was able to steal the entire movie right out from under them. He completely blew my away with this role. To go from that affable, lovable funny man, 'Ernest P. Worrell' to Rae's father, and every other character in between, and to do it so proficiently, is a rare talent indeed. If you grew up with 'Ernest P. Worrell', as I did, believe me, you will see absolutely no hint of that humble hayseed in this movie so don't go looking for him here. How Hollywood pigeon-holed Varney into Ernest is beyond me. It's too bad it took them so long to remove the 'Ernest Blinders'. If Varney were alive today, you can bet he'd be acting circles around these so-called big name celebrities. If you do watch this movie, watch with caution. There are some very disturbing moments in this.",1308268800,3,1905,4.6390532544378695

I lived in the Lexington area all my life and can attest to it's dead on accuracy in portraying the dark side of a impovrished, uneducated, and isolated white culture.  It's the side of our society we try to forget when we tell others that we are no longer fit the ""Hatfeild and McCoy"" stereotypes people have of us.  The character's lines in the movie have an eerie familiarity, and the scenes are like places in a vauge memory of my childhood.  In fact, after going through old family photos, I realized the couch in the characters Arco and Sissy's house is exactly like the one my great grandmother had in her living room (in a house that didn't have running water until 1988).  The thought and work that the director has put into the details of this movie are amazing, and could only be done by a person who has seen first hand lives that become the plots of an insane, violent, and disturbing story such as this.",1009843200,7,975,4.3646408839779
