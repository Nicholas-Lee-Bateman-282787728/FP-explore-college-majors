8348505,2,B0020H47DW,This is not even close to being the movie that HBO did with THE WIRE  series  ---  not the sellers fault but I just didn't enjoy this movie at all,1382659200,,146,3.8
8348506,4,B0020H47DW,This movie was cool I liked it. I'll give it 4 stars because I didn't fall alseep on it like I do most low budget films,1323043200,,119,3.6153846153846154
8348507,1,B0020H47DW,"I haven't watched the movie in whole and would like to say that I am not rating the film, just the format. Amazon advertised the format as Widescreen and that is what I was going by when I decided to purchase the DVD. I have an HD LCD TV and a blue-ray that up-converts. The thing that angers me the most is on the back of the DVD is clearly state's and I quote ""THIS FILM IS PRESENTED IN ""LETTERBOX"" FORMAT. THE BLACK BARS ON THE TOP AND BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN ARE NORMAL"". So I can't understand why Amazon has the format posted and advertised as Widescreen, because it clearly isn't.",1270425600,,583,4.214285714285714
8348508,3,B0020H47DW,"This was an interesting movie. The plot wasn't original, but the storyline unfolded gradually with a few good twist, ie Sticky Fingaz actually being an undercover cop.
Movie kept my interest and was defintely worth the purchase.",1269043200,,228,5.1891891891891895
8348509,5,B0020H47DW,"This Is a Sleeper. Great plot and the actors were on their A game. The movie starts in one direction,then twist and turns in another. I don't want to spoil it for potential viewers. Adding it to your collection is a must. I did!",1252713600,5,228,4.204545454545454
8348510,4,B0020H47DW,"I watched this movie last night as it Premiered ob B.E.T. Now, although this movie started off kinda slow for me, it really began to pick up. The plot was solid, and the acting was good. I would watch this movie again, and hope it does well.",1245110400,3,241,4.148936170212766
