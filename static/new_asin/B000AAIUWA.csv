2383734,5,B000AAIUWA,"I had read and watched quite a bit about the Kennedy Assassination - and had been particularly impressed with Oliver Stone's (JFK I) film a few years back - in bringing out some of the back story (the sequence with Donald Sutherland was particularly telling as to what really goes on behind the scenes).

This DVD, though shocking, does a great job of bringing together a number of disparate threads and weaving them together into about as coherent a picture as you are going to get without any official acknowledgement. Though the animations look ""low budget"" I think they actually add to the impact of the video in one sense - because they're pythonesque appearance matches the pythonesque lengths to which the Bush family - and their allies - have gone to infiltrate and sabotage many of the world's power structures. (Hard to believe when their public persona is all cheesy smiles, waves and political double-speak).

Of particular interest is the ""battle"" between J Edgar Hoover and the CIA. Hoover was also a crook - but his deft ability at covering his own backside (ass) in the affair (and standing his own perverse ground) is well-documented in this video.

It's a must watch, as are the videos of Alex Jones and Dr Leonard Horrowitz (though this video punches more succinctly than most of theirs).

The internet is full of government backed DISINFO/MISINFO experts such as the review above this one (I suspect).

Learn what many of us have known for years about the Bush Family and their treasonous behavior.  Learn the parties behind the JFK Assassination (besides the Bush's).  While this DVD does not tell you the actual shooters (and it is not important), it does give you information as to who really killed JFK and why and that is important.

While this DVD was made on a REAL budget the information is accurate and relayed in such a manner as not to attack your intelligence.  In my opinion it is the single most important DVD to come out regarding the JFK Assassination and how it ties into 911, Skull & Bones, and the politics of today.  The individuals that put together this DVD should be picked up by some major production company, but I feel the major companies would be scared to produce this DVD and tell the truth ""point blank.""

Help make America aware and buy a copy and distribute it EVERYWHERE.  I have purchased two thus far even though you need only one to copy it.

The Bushs' have committed treason in more ways than one and should be tried for such.  This DVD ties names and data together and very understandable even for the novice of these conspiracies.

2383736,5,B000AAIUWA,"If you watch this video and do your research. You will find the information in this video to be accurate. There are a few things you should keep in mind when watching this video.

1. There is no official version of what happened that day that ANY expert can agree on.

2. This video was produced on a very low budget and as from as far as i can tell no major distributor has picked it up (no new copies for sale). So very little no money is being made from this.

3. The person who reviewed this video before me skewed data from film to make it seem like it didn't make sense. Like the 12 shots being fired but only three heard, but he fails to mention that those shots would have be fired in a synchronized fashion that would disguise  the number of shooters. Plus there are bullet holes and witnesses that back up that number, but if your busy getting a upset stomach because one of your favorite politician was implicated then you might miss it.

4. If bush sues this video will get exposier and bush doesn't want that, espessialy cause its true. (oh yah Nixon is also implicated)

So that being said keep an open mind to all sides and remember you weren't there so you cant rule out the non-main stream ideas until you disprove the evidence. If you dare you might try to prove to your self that its true.....If you dare.",1132704000,25,1324,4.276
2383737,1,B000AAIUWA,"This ""JFK II"" piece of garbage is more of the same unsupportable and unsupported-by-the-facts conspiracist-created crappola! It takes some monster-sized gonads to place on the open market a piece of trash like this. Amazing guts indeed, to spout such completely-unprovable conspiratorial nonsense. And just think, somebody's actually making MONEY off of this conjecture! Unbelievable.

""JFK II"" -- dramatically subtitled ""The Bush Connection"" -- postulates that former President George H.W. Bush (the 41st U.S. Chief Executive from 1989-1993) was directly involved in the ""plot"" to assassinate President John F. Kennedy in November of 1963.

I'm guessing that the conspiracy theorists who have the gall to produce programs like ""JFK II"" must quite literally be running out of ""suspects"" to point an accusing finger at with regard to the assassination of JFK -- so it's time to start implicating every politician who was over 19 years of age at the time of Kennedy's murder on November 22nd, 1963. (Mr. Bush Sr. was 39, by the way, when JFK was cut down by Lee Harvey Oswald in Dallas.)

I wonder if former President Bill Clinton will be the next one on the ""He Had Kennedy Killed!"" list of assassination candidates? After all, Mr. Clinton DID once meet JFK and shook hands with him. That single handshake probably makes Clinton a potential conspirator too. Kennedy probably grabbed Bill's hand a little too tightly, forcing Clinton into a ""He Must Die!"" rage, resulting in a ""plot"" to do away with the 35th President. (Makes about as much sense as the junk purported by any of the other two thousand ""Kennedy Conspiracy"" plots, including this ""JFK II"" balderdash.)

The front of this DVD boasts this repulsive and unsupported sentiment --- ""A throrough, documented, criminal indictment of George Herbert Walker Bush, establishing, beyond a reasonable doubt, his guilt as a supervisor in the conspiracy to assassinate John Kennedy"".*

* = The word ""conspiracy"" is misspelled as ""conspiracty"" on the DVD's label. Plus, it appears the name ""Kennedy"" is not properly capitalized. Typical childish errors that, IMO, signify the general kind of low-rent production this thing is from start to ugly finish -- right through to the sloppy, obviously-not-proofread grammatical errors on the packaging. (And then there's the offensive cartoonish image on the disc showing Mr. Bush being electrocuted, which plunges this product even deeper into a morass of embarrassingly-distasteful dreck.)

The JFK II website shown on the front of the DVD even goes one passage further down the vile path by displaying this additional putrid gem: ""If we could present this evidence to a jury in Texas, he {Mr. Bush} would pay with his life.""

Stomach-turning indeed. Truly sickening allegations!

""JFK II"" is replete with the usual amount of ""It Couldn't Possibly Have Been Lee Harvey Oswald That Killed JFK"" rhetoric and presumptions and conspiracy-related theorizing. I admire anyone who can get through this whole hour-and-a-half production without vomiting. I barely managed it. (I didn't actually BUY this disgusting piece of pro-conspiracy tripe -- instead, I was able to see it free-of-charge via a weblink off of the Internet. I certainly wouldn't shell out any hard-earned cash for this DVD version.)

The contemptible and disgraceful hunk of speculation at the tail-end of this 90-minute program, which has the 43rd U.S. President, George W. Bush, being somehow ""involved"" in the death of JFK Jr. in July 1999 (which was two years prior to G.W. Bush becoming President), really capped this thing off in fine utterly-offensive fashion. Now what possible reason would Mr. Bush have had for ""arranging"" for Mr. Kennedy's plane to crash (and taking two other lives with him)? Pffttt. Not even worthy of debating, it's so nutty. This program doesn't tell us the ""Why?"" re. the G.W. Bush allegation. It's just a short blurb at the very end of the program. I guess we're just supposed to accept it on face value as the ""truth"". (Yeah, sure.)

The quote regarding that JFK Jr. nonsense direct from this documentary: ""Who did George W. Bush have to kill to get into the 'inner circle'...?"" -- Then it's suggested that Mr. Bush somehow was involved in JFK Jr's plane going down in Martha's Vineyard. Despicable! And it gives you some idea as to the ""type"" of documentary this one is. It's the usual kind of conspiracy program, which proceeds to smear just about everybody in sight, except (naturally) Jack Kennedy's real killer, Lee Harvey Oswald.

This CT Fantasy Show comes complete with the normal sizable cache of unknown hidden gunmen all over Dealey Plaza, as well as theories of JFK's body being stolen not just once by evil conspirators, but TWICE, prior to the dead President's burial.

The standard ""CT Motto"" exists here. That being, of course ---> ""As long as we don't point an accusing finger at that sweet ""innocent"" named ""Oswald"", all is fine and dandy"". (Nauseating, isn't it? It is to me, at any rate.)

This video program claims that there were THIRTEEN (13!!) shots fired in Dealey Plaza on November 22nd. No kidding. 13!

At one point, the ""JFK II"" narrator berates limousine driver William Greer for not speeding up earlier, claiming that ""By this time, close to 12 shots have been fired"". ~ LOL! ~

And yet, miraculously, NOT ONE SINGLE WITNESS (out of dozens and dozens who gave an opinion) heard even CLOSE to that number of shots in Dealey Plaza during the shooting.

And (again, miraculously lucky for these plotters) EVERY SINGLE PERSON who was in a MEDIA position to tell the world about the shooting within minutes of the assassination (Merriman Smith, Jay Watson and his associate, and Jack Bell, plus others) relayed information of ONLY THREE SHOTS being fired -- which, coincidentally, was the EXACT number of bullets that Oswald did fire from his Sniper's Perch and, of course, just exactly the same number of shots that the ""Patsy""-plotters NEEDED to have reported. I guess it's just more amazing luck for these A-1 assassins. Wonder what happened to the OTHER TEN SHOTS?

THIRTEEN SHOTS fired per this ""JFK II"" video -- and, to reiterate, somehow 100% of the witnesses never heard that number (or a number even remotely close to the Baker's Dozen purported). And CTers cannot possibly argue that some of the shots were ""silenced"". Because in order to purport THAT notion, we would not have had even ONE Knoll witness hear any shots from the FRONT (or so some witnesses claimed). And what kind of foolish shooters would silence only a few of the shots, and not ALL of the frontal shots. It's yet another case of the conspiracy theories contradicting each other -- but does that stop them from being put forth? Of course not.

Large segments of this program are culled from the excellent 1988 PBS-TV ""NOVA"" Special, ""Who Shot President Kennedy?"". And that's a shame, too, because that Walter Cronkite-hosted ""NOVA"" program is far too superior a documentary to be affiliated in any way with this ""JFK II"" Conspiracy Show.

Naturally, this program also insists that there was a huge hole in the back of JFK's head after he was shot in Dallas. I'd ask any newcomer to the subject of the JFK Assassination to watch the slow-motion video clip provided below. If you can see ANY back-of-the-head damage to JFK, please tell the rest of the population WHERE it is. Because I see none. ALL of the head damage is to the FRONT-RIGHT, perfectly consistent with an Oswald shot from the Book Depository Building. Plus: ALL the head ""spray"" goes FORWARD, again indicative of a bullet travelling through the head on a Rear-to-Front trajectory. .....

If more assassination ""researchers"" would stick with the actual evidence in the JFK murder case, instead of pointing fingers at everybody from A-to-Z in the U.S. Government and accusing them of conspiratorial intent, then programs like this ""JFK II"" might forever remain unwritten -- which, IMO, would be a major asset to the world of JFK assassination-related material.

2383739,5,B000AAIUWA,"The first time I watched this film, it was not with an open mind. To me the cheap production and utilization of hokey cartoon characters made the film a joke. I didn't even watch the whole thing. But a few points the film made stuck with me, and later I watched it again with an open mind, paying close attention to the arguments that were being made. Turns out the film is well presented, argued, and documented. I am thankful to the filmmaker for opening my eyes. Very interesting revelations about George Herbert Walker Bush and others.",1228953600,6,539,4.56701030927835
2383740,5,B000AAIUWA,"I am embarrassed to admit that I received this DVD directly from John Hankey years ago, but I neglected to watch it until most recently. (I have been focused on the truth about 9/11, and ran for Congress twice on a 9/11 Truth, Peace, Impeachment platform).

I actually became a political activist, after watching Stone's ""JFK"" and discovering over 100 books on the subject at the local library, so I knew quite a bit about the Kennedy assasination and heard some bits and pieces of the material in this DVD before, but I had never seen it put together the way John Hankey has put it together, in a very succinct, clear, powerful way.  He builds a very solid case for the recruitment of George H. W. Bush into the CIA, his involvement with the anti-Castro operations, his presence in Dallas on the day of the assasination.  He also shows how Kennedy was using the FBI to bust the CIA's anti-Castro terrorist training camps, and how Oswald was the FBI's key agent in busting the CIA's illegal, domestic camps.  His analysis of the damning memo noting George Bush's CIA presence in Dallas, as being evidence of the CIA's threat to Hoover, demanding his cooperation in the cover-up is compelling.

John is a High School teacher. This is a low-budget, labor of love. He does throw in some strange songs and language most inappropriate for a serious documentary, but the facts are completely damning, particularly the timing of the Congressional Investigation in the 70's when CIA Director Colby opened up during the hearings, was fired and replaced by Bush as CIA Director, and the subsequent murders of the key witnesses, and the end of CIA cooperation with Congress.

I wish this could be seen by everyone.  Bush and his family should go to jail, at least...",1226966400,11,1755,4.7344262295081965
2383741,1,B000AAIUWA,"Let me say up front that I am an avid reader of JFK conspiracy theories and believe that anyone who is not cognitively impaired and has studied the case would not accept Oswald as the lone assassin from his supposed position in the TSBD.

This DVD argues that George H.W. Bush was connected to the JFK plot, with very little hard evidence.  If he was briefed by the FBI on the case, that's hardly a smoking gun.

I've known that Bush 41 was behind it for 11 years now so I'm glad to see someone has finally put the pieces together for all to see. Hankey is right: The Hoover memo is a smoking gun and so is Bush's habit of naming planes and ships after his wife. Maybe not enough to convict a president of killing a president, but it would be enough to bring the case to trial and get a real investigation if the entire system weren't controlled by Nazis.",1188864000,15,505,4.111111111111111
2383744,5,B000AAIUWA,"The first part of this DVD presents conclusive medical evidence of an exit wound out the back of JFK's head and thus (along with the obvious shot entering JFK's back) proves a conspiracy of at least two shooters.

Any serious attempt to understand JFK's assassination must explain at least the following:
1. the exit wound out the back of JFK's head shown by at least 10 medical professionals who examined JFK's body and depicted in this DVD and in Robert Groden's DVD ""JFK: The Case for Conspiracy"";
2. approximately six medical professionals who have stated they observed JFK's cerebellum exposed in the wound in the large (exit) wound in the back of JFK's head;
3. Oswald's expensive, German, miniature spy camera confiscated by the FBI from Oswald's belongings at the Paine residence and depicted in Chapter VIII of Gary Savage's book ""JFK: First Day Evidence"" (The Shoppe Press, 1993), and elsewhere (though Vincent Bugliosi's book ""Reclaiming History"" has no index entry under 'camera' or ""spy camera"";
4. the fact that the angle of trajectory of the single bullet theory is very different in Warren Commission Exhibit 385 and the Secret Service diagram of the trajectory of the bullet through Connally (see Photo 16 in David S. Lifton's book ""Best Evidence"");
5. FBI Exhibits 59 and 60 (see Photos 17 and 18 in Lifton's book), the coat and shirt of JFK showing a bullethole 5.5 inches below the top of the coat collar and 5.25 inches below the top of the shirt collar, and showing that the bullethole was almost dead center in the back (meaning that on the right to left trajectory from Oswald's supposed sniper's nest in the Texas School Book Depository the bullet would have almost certainly have struck JFK's spine and have been unable to emerge to hit Connally and be almost pristine as the single bullet labelled Warren Commission Exhibit 399 is);
6. Warren Commission Exhibit 856, a bullet deformed much more than Warren Commission Exhibit 399 and yet fired only through the wrist of a cadaver rather than, as the single bullet theory holds Exhibit 399 did, travel through JFK, through Connally's back and chest, through Connally's wrist, and into Connally's legbone;
7. the fact that the Warren Commission refused to have declassified and printed in its 26 volumes all of Oswald's state and federal income tax records;
8. the fact that the FBI ordered Special Agent Hosty to destroy a note, perhaps in code, from Oswald that it received from Oswald directly shortly before 11/22/63;
9. the fact that Jack Ruby, supposedly a lone nut, held down the responsible job of running two nightclubs, had phone records showing he called known mob figures, and was visited in jail first by known mob figures, and that the Warren Commission failed to present Ruby's mob links;
10. the fact that Oswald, supposedly another lone nut, was: a) a married father of two who b) carpooled with another employee to get to his full-time job and who c) never missed a day of work in that job, who d) lived in a boarding house with 17 other people, who e) had numerous friends stretching from New York to Texas to N. Dakota to the USSR and was not a loner but a joiner who joined f) the Civil Air Patrol and g) at the early age of 17 joined the Marines, and h) enlisted the aid of 2 others to hand out pro-Cuba flyers and who i) tried to infiltrate anti-Castro groups and who j) had traveled widely to several countries such as Japan, the Philippines, Finland, USSR and Mexico by the young age of 24, and k) according to Marine health records contracted VD ""in the line of duty"" (unlike a loner);
11. the conflicting official Marine and other records showing that Oswald was 5'9"" and 6'1"" at around the same time;
12. the conflicting junior high school records and Warren Commission testimony of Oswald's brother Robert putting Oswald in two places at the same time;
13. how Oswald had a passport application approved in only one day without any help from any intelligence service;
14. how JFK's violent head snap back and to the left was possible due to a gunshot supposedly fired from behind him;
15. how JFK's skull and brain and blood could be propelled over the back of the trunk and forcefully spray a motorcycle cop located to the left rear of JFK;
16. how the trajectory of the single bullet theory can have the bullet exit JFK's throat given the May 1964 Warren Commission/FBI re-enactment depicted in a KRLD News photo shown as photo 12 in the photographic insert between pages 428 and 429 in the Doubleday 1964 edition of The Warren Report with Louis Nizer's analysis and commentary;
17. how easily Oswald moved in and out of the USSR without being arrested or seriously interrogated on the record or officially used as an asset by American intelligence even though Oswald did all this at the height of the Cold War;
18. how the single bullet theory is consistent with Warren Commission Exhibit 895, depicted on p. 103 of the U.S. Gov. Printing Office version of The Warren Report, 1964, which shows that at Zapruder Frame 225 (when JFK was probably first struck) more than half of Connally's body is to the right of the vertical crosshair of the sniper even though the trajectory from Oswald's supposed sniper's nest is right to left and even though Connally was first struck in the right side of his back (further to the right than JFK's back wound);
19. why the corroborated testimony of medical professionals all stated that JFK's throat wound was so small that it looked like an entrance wound rather than the exit wound the single bullet theory requires;
20. why Warren Commission member Allen Dulles, whom JFK had fired as CIA director, failed to tell the Commission of the CIA's attempts to kill Castro using mafia hit men;
21. why Ruby said on videotape that only he knew why highly powerful people put him in position to kill Oswald;
22. what Oswald's relationship with David Ferrie was, since the two were photographed together at a Civil Air Patrol function and since Ferrie was a known mob investigator and pilot who worked with ex-FBI agent Guy Banister at 544 Camp Street in New Orleans, an address that (coincidentally?) was stamped on some of Oswald's ""Hands Off Cuba"" flyers that supposedly loner Oswald distributed with two other men;
23. why Charles Harrelson, convicted of using a rifle with a telescopic sight to shoot at a federal judge, was evidently photographed in the ""Three Tramp"" photos with a man looking remarkably like known CIA agent E. Howard Hunt;
24. why James E. Files and E. Howard Hunt confessed to participating in a conspiracy to kill JFK on 11/22/63;
25. why 2 CIA employees corroborated each other's testimony to the Warren Commission by saying that they knew Oswald was a CIA employee;
26. why on a sunny day a man with an open umbrella was standing on JFK's side of JFK's limo if not to identify to a sniper which man to shoot at from behind and why this man just happens to be positioned exactly in Zapruder frame 225, which is the first frame showing any JFK reaction to being shot;
27. why 2 police officers corroborated each other's story of encountering an armed man on the grassy knoll shortly after the assassination who flashed secret service credentials, even though the Secret Service confirms that none of its agents was on the grassy knoll at that time;
28. why the Bethesda autopsy said the bullet wound in JFK's back travelled only about 2 inches into his body and stopped and could not be probed further rather than be followed to any exit wound out of the front of JFK's body (which the single bullet theory requires);
29. why the Zapruder film was not shown on TV until 1975;
30. why one of the backyard photos of Oswald did not appear until 1976;
31. why, as Vincent Bugliosi admits in his book ""Reclaiming History,"" the FBI kept secret for many years that Jack Ruby had an FBI file and was listed there as a potential asset;
32. why photographs of Oswald (for example Jack White's analysis of Oswald in the photo between pages 308 and 309 in Jim Marrs's book 'Crossfire') fail to match;
33. why an FBI memo from J. Edgar Hoover expressed concern in 1960 that someone was using Oswald's passport to impersonate him while he was in the USSR.

These are merely 33 reasons (one can produce many more) to believe that even if Oswald was guilty, there was more than one person identified as Oswald, and that there was in any event a conspiracy that killed JFK.",1183507200,29,8419,4.699390656736628
2383745,5,B000AAIUWA,"It is my pleasure to recommend the works of John Hankey: ""JFK II: The Bush Connection"" and ""The Assassination of JFK Jr."" My perspective in evaluating JFK II is as a Harvard-educated, National Board Certified social studies teacher with 23 years experience. From the approximately 100 media sources I use to teach high school US History, my students report that JFK II is among the top few for clarity, impact, and importance. John Hankey has my highest praise for his contribution to our understanding of one of the most significant events in United States history. JFK II shows incisive understanding of broad historical events, then communicates the essential elements through engaging media. Importantly, JFK's information is documented from independently verifiable sources that demonstrate the professional scholarship we want all of our students to learn. This work resonates with intellectual strength, moral integrity, and courage to state the documented truth so boldly. To be clear, I cannot overstate the power and contribution of JFK II to understand the assassination of President Kennedy. This includes evidence linking former CIA Director and President G.H.W. Bush to the assassination and extends to our present ""war on terror"" and rhetoric for war with Iran from the current President Bush.

I encourage everyone to view this important documentary, including high school students. Please allow me a paragraph to provide academic support for your confidence in an assessment of JFK II's historical integrity:

Social studies scholarship employs classical and conservative methods to deduce historical conclusions. The study of history is our best scholarly method to answer the questions of who did what, where, when, and what other facts can help us analyze the more subjective question of why. Historians use academic tools to discover the most compelling evidence, with the strongest being physical evidence that only and always obey the unbendable rules of science. Circumstantial evidence, and multiple and independent non-biased testimony are also crucial. The research in JFK II appropriately uses these tools. The people who disagree have not examined the facts in this work, or will not provide a compelling argument against those facts. They will inevitably resort to ad hominem attacks (such as the ""utter garbage"" of the previous review), falsely the factual presentation of the work, or give the un-American response that we should blindly trust our government's explanations without question. If you encounter such individuals, please place the burden of proof upon them to explain how JFK II is inaccurate. You will discover they have no rational response.

The current President Bush led the spin leading to US war with Iraq, that we now know through declassified intelligence reports, congressional testimony, official documents such as from the Senate Committee on Intelligence and the 9/11 Commission, and other documented and corroborated sources that all of these claims were known by the Bush administration to be false at the time they were told to the American public. There are several books that document this information. I've read three, all of which I also recommend: Elizabeth de la Vega's U.S. V. Bush, Dave Lindorff and Barbara Olshansky's The Case for Impeachment, and the Dennis Loo and Peter Phillips' edited essays Impeach the President: The Case Against Bush and Cheney. Americans need controversial topics to discern fact from political spin, engage in civil conversations that welcome multiple points-of-views, and participate in policy decisions.

American history is a story of leaders who challenge viciousness with a compelling vision of virtue. The Founding Fathers did not blindly trust the British government, made tyranny visible against guaranteed rights of Americans, and fought for social and political justice. Civil Rights leaders made institutionalized racism visible and acted for the higher virtue of all people being created equal, each equally valued and valuable. JFK II makes visible the tyranny of government-supported assassination of a US President. Invest in your education. Buy this DVD and share it.",1179360000,23,4181,5.477519379844961

8077074,5,B000AAIUWA,"At the top of our government, everything is well interconnected, and this video puts that together on the assassination of one our last real presidents. I highly recommend watching this video, and I enjoyed its well done inexpensive presentation. Gerald Ford did his job while on the Warren Commission, and was elected President; Bush did his job on Kennedy,  and was elected President. JFK Jr. ""crashed"" into the ocean, and Bush Jr. was elected President. It makes me wonder about the Black guy, and his Transsexual ""wife"" in the White House, did to get elected; and out of nowhere. Buy this or watch it for free online, but research that James Files made the fatal head shot.

Google ""michelle obama is a man"" and understand that ""they"" are nothing like typical Americans.

His video 'The assassination of JFK Jr.' is also quite convincing to Bush guilt. Another recommendation about the truth of the top of our government.

I re-watch these films.",1398124800,,950,4.881987577639752
8077075,5,B000AAIUWA,"I bought this DVD by mistake but because it was about JFK kept and watched it. Was impressed with what I saw. Some of it I knew about,some of it I did not,some of it was quite shocking,eventually I will get the book Bloody Treason and learn more about. Highly recommend getting it and see for yourself.",1387670400,2,302,4.315789473684211
8077076,1,B000AAIUWA,This is quite likely the shoddiest piece of video ever produced purporting to show answers to the JFK Assassination.  You need more than a memo that suggests that George Bush Sr. was in the CIA in 1963.  Connections and conclusions are made based on the most specious information.  It's part of a revisionist assassination school that lacks professionalism and actually undermines the true quest for answers in the President's murder.  Don't waste your money. Watch it free on Youtube and you be the judge.,1377388800,,506,4.988095238095238
8077077,5,B000AAIUWA,"I saw this documentary by streaming to my PC, and it was an eye opener. It contains the sort of information that helps make some sense out of the state of our country and explains who is really running things.",1371513600,,209,4.25
8077078,4,B000AAIUWA,"This DVD has received some strong criticism for (1) making unsubstantiated claims and (2) ""hokey"" graphics and low-budget production.

First, I want to say how much I enjoyed the ""hokey"" cartoonish aspect.  It reminded me of the TV show ""South Park,"" which somehow seems oddly appropriate in a sad way of this whole horrible chapter in United States history.

Secondly, I am a student of the Kennedy assassination, but not an expert.  I am sure that some of the contentions in this film are open to question.  However, that's not necessarily a bad thing.

The goal of the film, after all, is to make us think.  I think this is a worthwhile documentary to watch and digest in conjunction with other assassination materials.",1371168000,2,722,4.821138211382114
8077079,1,B000AAIUWA,"I loved it - even for it`s light hearted narration at times! Eye-opening and beautifully detailed inter-relationships exposes Bush for what he really was! (and for me, explains why I so distrusted his son`s Presidency so very much). I highly recommend this in-depth and thought provoking insight into George Bush`s objectionable and disturbing background.
No wonder the nation-wide Polls consistently rate their Presidencies so very lowly!",1370995200,3,439,5.666666666666667
8077080,5,B000AAIUWA,"John Hankey's highly intelligent documentary, Dark Legacy: JFK II, The Bush Connection, accurately puts together the pieces of the JFK assassination puzzle. If you want to know who killed Kennedy, this film will point you in the right direction. Hankey's conclusions are sober and not at all surprising. The only bewildering aspect of this abominable crime is not the identity of the perpetrators, but that it has gone unpunished and that the public has tolerated its outrageous coverup for so long. As Hankey suggests, the only explanation is the unfathomable evil and ongoing power of the agents behind it.",1357948800,,608,5.151515151515151
8077081,5,B000AAIUWA,"This dvd JFK II is the original version of John Hankey's other dvd, ""Dark Legacy"".  You should also watch John Hankey's other dvd,""The Assassination of JFK jr."" Suspend your disbelief that a coup could happen in the U.S. and you will find the truth about the corruption that has been plaguing this country for the past 49-50 years.
Worst crime ever. Also read the book ""Breach of Trust"" by Gerald McKnight.",1334620800,3,406,4.71830985915493
