8293278,3,B001DHK82Y,"I love Michael McIntyre but, unless you have specific equipment, you cannot watch this in the U.S.  it is in a European format.  Since I was purchasing from the U.S., that never occurred to me, so I am out of pocket on my shipping cost to return it.  It would be nice if Amazon added programming to pop up a warning if this is shipping to a U.S. address that it is in a non-U.S. format.",1366588800,7,386,4.052631578947368

I am a fan of his and he is such a character. The DVD is brilliant, it's some of his best work and is so worth watching. I am more than happy to give this 5 stars and recommend it.",1354579200,,319,3.63768115942029
