8544786,3,B009WYBU54,"I have given a three star evaluation, which I consider to be neutral, since I have not purchased this item or used it. I am acquainted with Whole Woman and Christine Kent books and DVDs, which I think have value. But I would not suggest going to a ""Second Wheel"" program suggesting that it is not an introductory product if I had a prolapse, but rather would start at the beginning with the first wheel. I have purchased the classic dance DVD from Christine Kent and have found that it is VERY careful about directions and also about respecting your body and being attuned to it, and yoga has in general emphasized not pushing yourself but rather having awareness of yourself. Anyway, I think there is a lot to be said for the Whole Woman system and it has helped many women. Do your due diligence and really check out the website  Saving the Whole Woman. Make up your own mind with as many of the facts as you can and be sensible for your health. All the best to all the women who suffer from POP.",1369094400,8,998,4.336898395721925
8544787,1,B009WYBU54,"I chose this DVD because it is supposed to help with postpartum prolapse, as an alternative to surgery for the rectocele that I have from giving birth.  I am 7 months postpartum and this DVD is way too much for my postpartum body to handle (or anyone's), I can't imagine if I had tried it months ago, I think it does more damage than good, and I really hurt myself doing it more than anything.  They don't explain the movements well and there are no modifications for those of us who need them.  I think any woman looking for help postpartum due to prolapse probably had a traumatic birth and severe tear like I did and this DVD is not good for postpartum healing with all the wide open leg positions and intense exercises, I think it could really do a lot of damage to a postpartum body that is trying to heal.  In addition to the exercises, the longer part of the video is the ""philosophy"" part which is mostly just very random feminine theory that has nothing to do with prolapse or postpartum healing - the DVD is just a platform to get these opinions out on sexuality, feminine power, etc.(not what I was looking to spend my money on) Obviously I am very disappointed in this DVD, it has not helped my prolapse (maybe made it worse), and I spent way too much money of it.",1359417600,5,1276,4.326359832635983
