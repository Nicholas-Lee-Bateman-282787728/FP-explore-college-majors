8170028,3,B000MMJCQ4,"This is just a ""canned ""review meaning I wanted to give some feedback to anyone buying any VHS tape on Bonsai. I have bought about 6 of them and since I still have a couple of VHS players, for the price, each one you learn enough information  about creating Bonsai.
I do not think any Bonsai DVD or VHS tape is going to do the job or really preparing you for the amount of work involved but having These VHS tapes does help.
I do believe that if you want to learn Bonsai, you should seek out some classes near you and attend regularly if you can. these usually repeat themselves every six months but it is possibly the best way to learn---hands on.
Another way would be to join or at least visit some Bonsai clubs.here you have experience indiviudals who know what they are doing
Third, I would look up specifics on You tube.
Fourth, I would join some Bonsai forums where you can ask some questions.
This VHS tape cost me 4 dollars and for the money, it was OK. At a latter date, I will be more specific as the official is like someone describing to you the best chocolate cake in the world using as many emotional laden adjectives for my taste!
As I said, no one has done a review and I believe I should say at least a few words.
I will update this review as soon as I watch each VHS side by side. Sorry if this is too simplistic for most of you!",1374105600,,1347,4.141221374045801
