8165376,1,B000LZ5964,I have been a fan of Bama for 60 years. I hoped this would be like an NFL film. It wasn't even close! I cannot recommend it.,1463270400,,124,3.6296296296296298
8165377,3,B000LZ5964,Some of these players I had forgot all about.  Some of the players were role players. They didn't really impressed me when they were playing. But some did some didn't. But either way Roll Tide Roll.,1342915200,,198,4.5
8165378,5,B000LZ5964,"I bought this for my dad, who Loves the Crimson Tide.  I myself am an Auburn fan, but I think It was my dad's favorite gift last Christmas!  It's worn out from viewing!",1323216000,,168,4.0606060606060606
8165379,1,B000LZ5964,"Video: For recent players, all video was from the ground and appeared to be shot by the school production team.  Lots of unstable camera work.  Much of the video was from the same few games.
Audio: Narration was annoying.  The same phrases were repeated word-for-word for the same player and for multiple players.  It sounded like some sort of promotional video for NFL scouts.
There was very little video from the better known names advertized for the DVD.  Stabler - 3 to 4 plays.  Newsome - 4 or 5.  Namath - 3 or 4.  Starr - 2.
If it weren't for the fact that this was purchased for an 8-year-old, and his expectations are not high, I would be asking for my money back.",1198540800,,673,4.370967741935484
