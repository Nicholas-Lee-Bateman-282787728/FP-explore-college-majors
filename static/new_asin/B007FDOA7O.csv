8515614,5,B007FDOA7O,"Tuya Siempre was an unexpected surprise.  This Spanish film is a look at the dark and gritty side of life, of two people whose relationship is hurtling, inevitably and unavoidably, toward an unhappy ending--the result of the choices they make.  It's the journey to that conclusion which intrigues and captivates and is the essence of Tuya Siempre--the film is well-directed and the actors portray their characters quite realistically.  A great story that moves along and never lags.",1408147200,,482,5.233766233766234
