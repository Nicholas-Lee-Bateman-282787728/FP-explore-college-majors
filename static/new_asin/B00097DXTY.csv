8057835,4,B00097DXTY,"Three high-school boys inhabit an idyllic Danish suburb of single-family homes, empty summer houses just begging to be broken into, tiny clean stores staffed by pretty fresh-faced girls, and dewy soccer fields; they waft from one location to another on bikes, backed by a quirky little soundtrack. Ostensibly about three friends Jakob, Bo, and Mikkel on the soccer team, the movie spends the most time on the fits-and-starts romantic and sexual relationship of Jakob and classmate Mathilde. Meanwhile, Bo drifts away to an older, wealthier crowd, and Mikkel takes his chances with Mathilde when she's on the outs with Jakob. And then there's the consequences of the summer house break-in. The movie is gently humorous overall, but has some disruptive dark moments. In the end, an attractive cast and locations, and a peek at European life, make this a pleasant movie.",1276819200,,867,5.156028368794326
8057836,5,B00097DXTY,"Kick n Rush, a poignant coming of age story set in a small town in Denmark, has quite a refreshing take on the subject matter. The storyline is not complex or innovative but the great acting allows for an interesting character study.

The cinematography is well done and the use of lighting provides for beautiful cinematic moments.

The story basically follows the protagonist, Jakob, as he fumbles through adolescence. It's your basic coming of age premis but with a distinct feel with memorable actors. I would definitely recommend it.",1122336000,,538,5.033707865168539
