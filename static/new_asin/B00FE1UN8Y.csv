5978593,5,B00FE1UN8Y,"This show was really great, obviously it will be the same for everyone that buys it since most likely the buyers already like Angra and know how good they are.

I haven't been in the scene for a while and I was surprised to see that Eduardo Falashi is no longer in the band, at first I saw the singer from Rhapsody Fabio Lioni singing and I thought he was a guess for a few songs, but to my surprise he is the actual new singer.

I love Fabio in Rhapsody, but I thought he was just not going to be able to keep up with these songs, but to my surprise he signs excellent these songs. He signs them so good that even makes the same voice effects as Falashi.

He doesn't let the Angra feeling get lost at all, not even in the Mattos' ones, and he really delivers to the point that now I wish there was two versions of each Falashi albums, one with Lioni and one with Eduardo.

Tarja from Nightwish also sings in a few songs, they obviously gave her the higher pitch songs that only Andre Mattos can do, even she has trouble reaching those highs. But she does good, not as good as Mattos, but good enough to enjoy it, she is a good singer after all. Also they have a famous guitar player from the classics as a guess and a drummer from a now traditional Brazilian band to honor the Brazilian metal industry.

I have a few friends that don't like Fabio, and I can bet even they would tell me they like him better for Angra, I still like him for both.

Also the original drummer Ricardo Confessori is back, which means Aquiles Priester is no longer in the band either.

Felipe Andreoli (the bass guitar player) got fat, which is kind of funny, not too much but a big difference than he was before, he is not an original member, but he has been in the band since its rebirth and is cool to see him play as well.

Rafael Bettancourt is underrated as a guitar player and here as always shows off how good he is, which is a good thing, he looks normal.

Kiko Loureiro is with no doubt an amazing player as well, definitely in the Steve Vai level category, and surprisingly he looks young, I bet he is vegan or something, also working out doesn't hurt.

The audience is great as always is in Brazil from what I've seen in many video concerts, and Angra got a few musicians invited as well, including a cello guy, 3 violin guys and a keyboard player, with the other guesses they turn out to be 13 musicians on the show, all delivering the amazing powerful charismatic and emotional sound that Angra has always made.",1388880000,,2503,4.228511530398323
5978594,5,B00FE1UN8Y,"I was a bit skeptical about Angra's new singer, the italian tenor Fabio Lione, who also happens to be Rhapsody of Fire's frontman.
Fortunatelly, I was wrong.
Mr. Lione brings new stamina to an already powerful band, which, added to the awesome production work and tasteful setlist, results in an epic concert!
This is a must have for Angra fans.
If you don't know the band, this is your chance to get hooked into them.
Get it now!",1388016000,,430,4.5256410256410255
5978595,5,B00FE1UN8Y,"Angra hasn't sounded so good since Ritualive. Oh, wait... that was Shaman, I'm sorry. But yes... they haven't sounded this good since... Angels Cry (1993)!!. Yup, this DVD is that good!! Fbio Lione on the vocals is a million times better than Eduardo Falaschi and almost just as good as Andre Matos himself. Ricardo Confessori is also very welcome back and the rest of the band is in its best shape ever. The guests are also amazing and make this concert epic. Go ahead, buy this because if you ever liked Angra this is just as good as it gets.",1387324800,,544,4.45
8614698,5,B00FE1UN8Y,"Angels Cry 20th Anniversary Live is a 2013 concert Blu-ray by the Brazilian Progressive/Power Metal band Angra. It features the line-up with Italian singer Fabio Lione (ex-Labyrinth, Rhapsody of Fire) on vocals performing material from all eras of the discography passionately  with some interesting guest appearances including Tarja Turunen (ex- Nightwish), Uli Jon Roth (ex-Scorpions), Amilcar Christfaro (Torture Squad) and the Familia Lima string section.

This set has quite high production values. Visually; the thing is an absolute gem. Top notch image quality, great camera work with tasteful editing, and the actual stage show contains interesting video screens with eye catching imagery. Its all just great for the eyeballs, which is why you're getting a video recording and not an audio recording anyway, right? Well this is totally worth every penny in the visual department.

Sonically, the recording is crystal clear. You can hear every single note, every different drum and cymbal. Its like a Rush concert or something  brilliant clarity and definition. The only thing thats not absolutely perfect is that in the stereo mix, the rhythm guitar is not as heavy as some of the studio versions, but it is still a brilliant mix nonetheless.  Best of all; The performance is beyond stellar; Fabio nails it recreating the bands different singers work well and injects some of his own flair into the proceedings. The guitar solos are out of this world and the tireless drumming of Ricardo Confessori sounds great. Listening to and watching the interesting music is an absolute joy.

Highlights include the fantastic renditions of Evil Warning, Nothing To Say and the fantastic set closer Nova Era. The enthusiastic So Paulo audience seem really into it.

Overall; Its an absolutely great concert DVD on a technical level, and better still its a great concert in and of itself. The line-up is strong, the setlist is great and the guest musicians add an extra layer of interest. I highly recommend this to fans of the band, fans of this end of the musical spectrum, and fans of good quality concert recordings. It would be an unquestionable treat for existing fans but would also work really well as a first purchase for newcomers.",1431993600,,2236,5.109589041095891

8614706,4,B00FE1UN8Y,"I've been an Angra fan since the ""Angels Cry"" record first came out. I have most of their records and was really happy to see rthis DVD released. Angra is in top form. The sound and video quality is outstanding. Fabio does a great job fronting the band. Filling some huge shoes. The DVD packaging is nice and Tarja does a nice job singing the songs she does. My only regret is that the dvd I ordered (unknowingly) was the single dvd version, so the encores and ""Sails Of Charon' with Uli are missing. What did I expect fot 12 Bux. All in all a great concert dvd. Worth it for the diehard or any fan of symphonic power metal!",1397520000,,624,4.208333333333333
