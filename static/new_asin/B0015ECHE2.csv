8258176,4,B0015ECHE2,Lol what can ya say the title says it all Gymkata Killer. Nothing to do with the real movie Gymkata. This film released under the title Challange of the Tiger name changed to attract video store rentals in the 80s due to the success of Gymkata in the theater. This has great martial arts fights and a good amount of sex and nudity. If you like 80's cheesy low budget movies this is at the top of the heep for sure. I've seen copies sell for well over 100 bucks on other auction sites due to the rarity,1357948800,,501,4.122448979591836
