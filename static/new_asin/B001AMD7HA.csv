8277972,1,B001AMD7HA,"I'm really pissed off that none of these films are available in the US!!!  LET'S GET LOST is one of my favorite documentaries.  I saw it only once in the 80's at a theater.  Thank goodness for that because it has virtually disappeared from the American landscape.  If the American distribution companies are too stupid, cheap or afraid of releasing these films, why don't the Europeans do NTSC versions for distribution?  Like I said, I'm very upset!!!",1311724800,10,452,4.818181818181818

Wish he would do more movies.",1296086400,4,242,4.902439024390244
