7984629,2,B00008J2EQ,"I'm a B western fanatic. A Tex Ritter western ia a B western. As such, you merely watch it to enjoy. You don't scrutinize plot and story lines, nor even consider how the players act (or not act). It is there for the sheer enjoyment of the nostalgia of those ""western"" days gone past. But if the material you're watching is flawed, it detracts from the enjoyment. This B western by Alpha is not that bad as I've seen worse. But this DVD seems like a transfer from a VHS tape. The details are not good as the film is fuzzy. Then there is the obvious ""ghosts"" and ""stretch shadows"" one sees in a VHS tape transferred from another tape. Alpha came out with previous good releases made from well preserved films. Demand must have been high (due to the good quality and economical price)that they increaed their product offerings but now disregarding quality. This DVD is a case in point. The other Tex Ritter product Hittin' the Trail follows the same mold as with their Roy Rogers releases. I'm waiting for the Ken Maynard Alpha releases but I'll have to take the chance and bite the bullet on those as there is a paucity of Ken Maynard films available.",1067472000,3,1149,4.476190476190476
