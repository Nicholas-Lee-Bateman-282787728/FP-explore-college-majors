8133035,5,B000GIXLWK,"This show broke in on shaky ground, but gradually improved as time progressed through Season 1. However, I genuinely feel that in season 2, the geniuses behind this show really found a groove. Razor sharp political humor layered by random silliness that fit the insanity going around the characters. And of course, the emergence of Chris Edgerly as the voice of Peter Potamus. It does not get any better than this set. From beginning to end, this set makes you laugh. Given, of course, you are appreciative of razor sharp wit, comedic subtlety and pro-democratic points of view. If you are a conservative, right-wing type, you will not laugh at half of the jokes. Not saying liberals are the only ones who will like this, but half of the jokes are aimed specifically at them. The other half are gags aimed at a general, unknowing audience for mere giggles. Enjoy!",1223510400,,863,4.76
8133036,4,B000GIXLWK,"The episodes are uneven, but the concept for the series is great.  I had never seen this series before until I caught the first episode of season 1.  The actors seem to be having a great time with their characters.  Recommended.",1178928000,,228,4.512195121951219
8133037,4,B000GIXLWK,"Most superheroes go from dullsville jobs to exciting planet-saving adventures. Harvey Birdman did the opposite.

Adult Swim's late night programming is full of weird stuff, so a winged lawyer is right up their alley -- as is a world full of superheroes, Hanna Barbera characters, and general goofiness from an earnest lawyer who has more wings than brains. That, my friends, is the first two volumes of ""Harvey Birdman, Attorney At Law.""

Harvey Birdman was once a superhero in ""Birdman and the Galaxy Trio."" But now he's retired from his superheroing, and works for the law firm of Sebben and Sebben, with his purple eagle Avenger as his legal secretary. There's also his clever, mocking clerk Peanut (""Ooh, me likey the oppressive totalitarianism""), and his one-eyed, obnoxious boss Phil. Also a bear. And a hippo.

And Harvey is not a terribly good lawyer, but he bumbles through the various cases: Shaggy and Scooby-doo are suspected of possession, Boo-boo Bear may be the Unabooboo, Fred Flintstone may be a mob boss, Race Bannon fights his partner Dr. Quest for custody of his two boys.

In the second volume, the madness continues: the Jetsons attempt to sue everybody for global warming, steroids at the Laffalympics, Botox botching for Droopy the Dog, Quick Draw McGraw is arrested for carrying a concealed weapon, and getting sucked back in time to the Stone Age through a jacuzzi. I kid you not.

Our heroes have problems of their own: Birdman gets addicted to bronzing cream, gets sued by Murro the Maurader, and struggles to keep his job when a cost-cutting sweep hits the law offices (headed by ""Dvd,"" who took out the vowels for efficiency). And Peanut undergoes ""superty,"" while the crazed alien Reducto finally gets a girlfriend.

""Harvey Birdman, Attorney At Law"" is one of those wonderful series that have absurd jokes, played with a straight face. As if the idea of a superhero law firm (and rival law firms) wasn't funny enough, the creators take the idea and run with it -- by having almost every episode feature a cartoon character in the courtroom.

The animation is pretty standard Adult Swim -- rather two-dimensional, flows nicely, and is full of visual gags, weird running jokes and courtroom scenes that always descend into chaos. It's not unusual for there to be giant spiked maces swinging through one of the offices at Sebben and Sebben, or a disco ball descending from the ceiling.

But the dialogue is pure hilarity, whether it's terrible puns (""I'll be keeping my eyes on you."" ""Eye."" ""I didn't know you were Scottish!"") or just strange (a bazooka-wielding Peanut tells someone, ""It is considered customary in our culture, once a business deal is concluded, to blow something up"").

And Harvey Birdman is the kind of lawyer you would NOT want working for you -- a nice guy, dedicated to his job, but it's basically a matter of chance whether he wins his cases or not (especially since the judges are all insane). He's backed up by an increasing number of giant Apaches, winged people, obsessive fan-assassins,  hammy mind-readers, and paranoid little aliens with shrink guns.

""Harvey Birdman, Attorney At Law"" is a hilarious little comedy series, especially for anyone who likes to mock the judificial process -- and old cartoons. Very fun.",1178496000,,3276,4.9381818181818184
8133038,5,B000GIXLWK,"Harvey Birdman is the funniest cartoon I've seen in years. In this series from Cartoon Network, Mr. Birdman defends other cartoon characters in the courtroom. One of my favorite episodes is when he defends Scooby Doo and Shaggy on suspected drug use charges. I've watched these discs over and over and they never get old.",1178409600,,321,4.8545454545454545
8133039,4,B000GIXLWK,"It doesn't matter if you watched the original, Harvey Birdman takes all members of the Hanna Barbara family and brings them to modern maturity. Fred Flintstone as a mob boss, Inch High Private Eye discriminated at the work place. Classic concepts with adult humor that only the brains at Adult Swim could create.

Not to mention one of the best theme songs!",1168473600,,357,4.758064516129032
