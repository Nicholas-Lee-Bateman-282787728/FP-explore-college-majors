8227338,4,B000X9LQCO,"Ridden is a really good independent film from Dallas filmmaker R. Scott Gully.  Despite being a little over 30 minutes long, the movie is full of suspense and a smart twist.  I've seen many independent first effort short films and student short films, Ridden rises above them all with it's clever plot.  Don't expect a big-budget, Hollywood flick when you buy this, but do expect a great short film with all the right ingredients for a thought provoking suspense.  You won't be disappointed!",1195257600,,491,4.879518072289157
