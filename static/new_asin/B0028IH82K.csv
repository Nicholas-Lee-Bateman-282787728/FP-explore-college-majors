8511139,3,B0028IH82K,I ordered this DVD + CD for my husband.  He was very happy with the surprised but unfortunately all we got on the shipment was a DVD and NO CD :( We never received it with the shipment.  I tried contacting and e-mailing to get the CD but had no luck except a response to contact the third party of where the shipment came from.  It was very frustrating and I am very disappointed that I was never able to get the CD as its advertised by AMAZON but never got help.,1265673600,,463,4.010869565217392
