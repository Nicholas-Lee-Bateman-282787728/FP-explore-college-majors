5462354,5,B00AO05ACE,I love the series. If you like older anime than I would recommend this show. I love the old art style and the story line. The only thing I do not like is the box set format. The cd's are stacked up on each other and it's hard to get the cd's out. Other than that it's fine.,1365724800,5,273,3.7241379310344827
5462355,1,B00AO05ACE,"I want to start off by reiterating the fact that I gave this product a low rating for the Maiden Japan release, i.e. the packaging, presentation, etc. and NOT for the show itself. This series is a wonderful blend of the Sailor Moon-esque magical girl genre and the more gothic horror style anime such as Vampire Hunter D. It has an interesting plot and engaging characters. Miyu is a royal vampire who, as Guardian of Japan, has been tasked with returning evil monsters called Shinma, who prey on the souls of humans, back to the darkness whence they were banished thousands of years ago. I highly recommend this series, especially to fans of other old 90s anime such as Sailor Moon, Cowboy Bebop, Yu Yu Hakusho, Neon Genesis Evangelion, etc.

So obviously, being a long time fan of this series, I was very excited to hear about this new release by Maiden Japan. I had watched the version released back in 2001 by Tokyopop but never actually owned a box-set of it. Therefore, I rushed to buy this version as soon as it was released. However, when I actually opened up the box I was extremely disappointed and I immediately regretted buying it. All I found inside the deceptively large box-set was a piece of protective foam and five DVDs which were rather unceremoniously stacked on top of each other in one DVD tray with no divider in between them. In my opinion this is a serious problem which has the potential of causing the discs to get scratched by rubbing against one another inside the case. Also, considering the MSRP for this item is $59.98 I feel that Maiden Japan was trying to cut too many corners on the packaging of this DVD set. This becomes even more apparent when considering the fact that Maiden Japan was able to use an old dub done by Tokyopop and all they really had to do was repackage it. They didn't add any inserts or special features of any kind on the discs themselves and on top of that the packaging was as barebones as possible. If this isn't an issue for you than this is a great anime and this release features the original Tokyopop dub from 2001, which will be a big draw for fans like myself, as well as the Japanese vocal track with English subtitles. However, if you are interested in this anime I would highly recommend sticking with the old Tokyopop release. Even the single DVDs would be a better alternative to a set with packaging that has the potential to scratch up all your DVDs.

***UPDATE***

After actually viewing the DVDs themselves I found that they were somewhat poor quality as well. For the most part the discs play fine but on a few episodes the motion becomes blurred and fragmented around the edges of moving objects or people. It doesn't skip but the animation just doesn't run smoothly and I know that this issue was not present in previous releases. I'm not sure if this is simply because some of the discs I got are defective and didn't transfer properly or if this is universal to all copies produced by Maiden Japan. Either way this seems to be a very poorly produced set and I would not recommend it.",1364083200,19,3064,4.527075812274369
5462356,4,B00AO05ACE,I love this series.  I watched it on VHS many years ago and wanted it on DVD for the longest time (seeing as I no longer have a VCR).  I'm disappointed by the case however: ALL THE DVDS ARE STACKED ON TOP OF EACHOTHER (isn't that a no-no?) so I had to take them out and put their in their own individual cases (some spare jewel cases).,1363824000,4,335,3.985074626865672
5462357,5,B00AO05ACE,when i saw this i wasn't for sure if this is going to be in english dub so does someone know this for sure?,1357084800,3,107,3.5
8555014,5,B00AO05ACE,Worthy predecessor of the OVA.  A little less atmospheric to include more characters and dialog but still dark.,1448409600,,111,5.166666666666667

8555017,4,B00AO05ACE,I can say I really liked this old anime.  The reviews of this were like bad I know though this anime was made in 1998 so you can give it a little mercy and it seemed like a good plot.  My guess is the designers were really out there and wanted to create a title to bad it was just overly ambitious for the time.,1438905600,,311,3.769230769230769

8555019,2,B00AO05ACE,This is a great old anime. I have recently been buying up all the older anime that I can find and I have to say this is a great dark vampire anime. No one in this show lives happily ever after. I found myself wanting to watch the next episode just to see how tragically it would end. But the package is awful it has all the DVDs stacked on top of each other I had to buy another case just to keep my DVDs from getting scratched.,1425686400,,428,3.875

8555021,1,B00AO05ACE,"This animated series was an abomination. The original 4 episode OVA was thought out, beautifully constructed, and the art was so well executed. The new series is like a mix of Miyu and Pokemon. I am so disappointed by the new series, I would discourage anyone from this one, just get the original four episodes and enjoy the obscure stylization of the manga in animation format. The new series is going to the goodwill. Awful!!!!",1404604800,,429,4.733333333333333
