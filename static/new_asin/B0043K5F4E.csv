It shows people about 50 +
Sorry but this should be marketed to everyone!
I bought it becasue I find the 30 minute LS workouts fit my lifestyle.
They are usually 2 miles and I can get them in almost every day
Well I rarely am displeased with LS workouts but this one might now be my new fav 30 mnut one.
Ok so there is this dr who gives tips and the edits stink but skip over him. you get one mile  in 15 min then aother with weights and then there is an ab workout.
This is a COMPLETE BODY WORKOUT
I don't recall any of her others having all this!
I have quite a few of them and I was so happy with this workout I can't tell you how surprised I was.
It is only 2 miles (so not for the expert runner or workout enthusiast) but I have arthritis in both knees and used to do up to her 5 mile workouts.
I need knee surgery and 30 minutes at a brisk pace is the best I can do right now. It also is a short amount of time that anyone can fit into their daily routine.
Now this is not a seniors  workout so I am little miffed at her background people all being over 50 though they look great!
This could be geared to any age! I will also tell you I did go back and listen to the dr because his health info was notable,
I just wanted to get the workout in qucik the first time ; )
Do yourself a fvor and add this one to your collection. You won't regret it!",1353110400,2,1385,3.7889273356401385

I thought I would try this one and once again I am very happy.  I was pleasantly surprised when my dvd arrived in just two days.  It was previously used, but it is in perfect condition.  This is a great way to really get in shape if you are over 50.  You get a great 30 minute workout. Not to mention, you get a workout with hand weights too.  I highly recommend this particular dvd and anything else from Leslie Sansone.  You will not be disappointed either...",1344556800,3,613,4.2155172413793105
