2268793,2,B000971EO0,"The video and audio aspect was very poor.  The narration was deep and hard to understand.  The color was something I used to see in Junior High school in the late sixties.

As for the tour it was rather disappointing since there were very few interior shots.  Of course it was too fast but producer had limited time.  Since the color was dated it was difficult to appreciate what I am sure are some beautiful structures and gardens.

This experience however, will not stop me from viewing other video tours of other locales.  Apprciez votre voyage!",1395446400,,548,4.645833333333333
2268794,3,B000971EO0,"The Cotswold area looks lovely, and probably hasn't changed much since the film was produced in the 1990s.  The coloring in the film changes as you go.  Often scenes appeared in black and white and then blinked into color, but the color was degraded and over saturated.  One man sported a blue arm and hand, and some young girls legs blurred together in hot pink.  The scenes also changed very rapidly and didn't always coincide with the narration. I normally have no trouble understanding an English accent, but with an overblown, distorted audio and rapid fire speech, I found comprehension difficult.  The film succeeded in giving us a glimpse of the Cotswolds, but that's about the best I can say.",1380067200,4,701,4.808333333333334
2268795,5,B000971EO0,We are planning a trip sometime next fall to the Cotswolds and this video helped me so much to be familiar with this area of England.,1358380800,,133,4.153846153846154
2268796,2,B000971EO0,"Informative.  Gives lots of information on the area, but the video pictures are not crisp.  I particularly like crisp edges and sharp details when it comes to photography so I find this disappointing.  If you don't mind ""soft-focues"" scenes, you might like this one.",1204243200,4,266,5.0
2268797,4,B000971EO0,"No slick production values.  Nices introduction to the villages.  Pacing a bit uneven, but overall a nice view into the history and villages.",1426118400,,141,5.086956521739131

2268801,3,B000971EO0,"Dated and boring narration.  Print seemed faded.  Save your bucks, go to the library and see an old National Geographic.",1417996800,,120,4.95
2268802,2,B000971EO0,"I liked the subject, but the audio was so difficult to understand. I ended up having to turn on the closed captioning in order to understand what was being said. The narration was too quiet compared to the audio in the scenes.",1416182400,,226,4.404761904761905

8057762,5,B000971EO0,A bit dated but still current. Very good information about locale and routes of travel,1461369600,,86,4.8
8057763,4,B000971EO0,"It's old, so the quality is a little scratch and outdated.  However! The depictions of the countryside and villages in The Cotswolds is spot on!  I have been to many of these villages, both in the 80s and again in 2009.  Felt like I was back!",1455580800,,242,4.217391304347826
8057764,1,B000971EO0,Impossible to make it through.  After the tenth description of bricks laid to deflect rain we had enough.  Your mileage may vary.,1452556800,,129,4.818181818181818

8057766,5,B000971EO0,"Interesting and informative. If you travel I think you might want to watch it. If you are like me, I am an arm chair traveler. So I really enjoyed it.",1444867200,,150,4.033333333333333
8057767,5,B000971EO0,"Easy going tour of the Cotswolds.  No fancy camera work or loud music to detract from the gently narrated video tour.  It could easily have been a cameraman's family vacation (cut to the 50 minute mark to see Thomas the Tank Engine in action).  The color hasn't held up well since the film was shot years ago, but I'm old enough not to need everything state-of-the art.  Some reviewers had trouble understanding the narrator's accent.  I didn't think it was too hard to understand, but closed captioning is available.  I watched this free on Amazon Prime late one night and enjoyed it.  Some reviewers called it boring; I call it relaxing.",1438560000,,639,4.702702702702703
8057768,3,B000971EO0,"Kind of dated . . .plus I expected to see a bit of Stratford, which wasn't included.",1433721600,,84,4.0
8057769,3,B000971EO0,A good travelogue but not great film work. Missed a good many of the lesser known villages of the Cotswolds. Would like to have seen Warwick Castle included.,1430784000,,157,4.642857142857143
