2736361,5,B000MKXF46,"This movie was probably the best one next to Lucario and the Mystery of Mew and Jirachi Wish Maker. Pokemon Ranger centers around the legendary Pokemon Manaphy and of course Ash and his friends. Some new and amazing characters include Buizel, Jackie the Ranger, Mantyke, and Chatot the annoying but funny Pokemon. The villian is great, the ending is amazing, and the effects were the best yet!",1175731200,7,393,4.880597014925373

2736408,3,B000MKXF46,"Apparently the people that make these movies don't know their Pokemon. Why are all the legendary Pokemon so weak that they need Ash's intervention? Celebi, Manaphy, Latias, Latios, Jirachi, etc.  What happened to all the supposedly powerful Pokemon kicking you-know-what? That's what I wanted to see in the series. But now the series is becoming way too monotonous, tedious, and lethargic. The stories are the same, rehashed, and predictable ones over and over again. All the movies do now is showcase the new Pokemon. There is no story. There is no display of that Pokemon's power. Hopefully the series will realize its potential with the upcoming movies, featuring Darkrai, Giratina, and Arceus. But for now, I suggest you rent rather than buy.",1291939200,,746,5.114754098360656
2736409,3,B000MKXF46,"Pokemon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea is the ninth film in the Pokemon franchise, and was directed by Kunihiko Yuyama, and it was released as a two-disc set.  On the first DVD, you can play the movie, choose which scene you want to start watching the movie at, and you can choose to have English captions for the Hearing Impaired.  Three special features are included on this disc.  The first is ""Location Scouting.""  This documentary runs for about ten minutes, and it shows the director and the crew scouting out locations in Italy to help inspire the locations in the film.  It also include interviews with the director, the writer, and the composer; however, whenever they speak, an English narrator speaks over them instead of seeing subtitles on the screen.  Next is ""Art Slideshow.""  This feature runs for one minute and ten seconds, and only features production art of the characters that were designed specifically for this film.  Also, the viewer has no control over when the images change on the screen.  The final extra is labeled as ""Interactive.""  It's a splash screen that promotes the official Pokemon website, the Pokemon Learning League, and Pokemon Mobile.

The second disc contains ""Pikachu's Island Adventure,"" the short that accompanied the film when it aired in Japanese theaters.  In the short. Pikachu and the other Pokemon traveling with Ash and his friends are going to play on an island that's full of fun and adventure.  However, they encounter some Wynaut and a couple of Pichu who were chased off the island by Meowth and its gang.  It's up to Pikachu and friends to teach the Wynaut and Pichu how to stand up for themselves.  This was the first of the shorts to be dubbed by The Pokemon Company, and a decision was made to have the narrator give dialogue for the Pokemon in addition to hearing the Pokemon make their natural noises when they speak.  I personally didn't like this, as it felt like the narrator was talking down to the audience.  I also thought it was a little insulting that The Pokemon Company felt the audience wasn't smart enough to be able to figure out what was going on through the images on the screen.  However, this short was the only item included on the disc.  Personally, I thought this was a waste.  It would have been better to include the short on the first DVD, and to have released Pokemon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea as a single disc.

The movie is one of the longer films in the Pokemon franchise, but it's still good viewing if you enjoy Pokemon.  The major downside is how much 3D animation the director tried to include, and just how much the 3D animation sticks out like a sore thumb in comparison to the elements that were animated with traditional animation.  Even with the issues I have with this release, I would still recommend it to Pokemon fans, especially ones who want to have a complete Pokemon DVD collection.",1285632000,,2899,4.663385826771654
2736410,3,B000MKXF46,I bought this for my nephew for Christmas. I think he just wanted to have it to remind him of younger fun times!,1278028800,,112,3.9130434782608696
2736411,3,B000MKXF46,"When I first started watching Pokemon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea it seemed like a dramatic visual upgrade from the previous movies. The colors are extremely bright and it mixes in a lot of nice CGI but the longer I watched it the less impressed I became. The character animation is mediocre at best and the backgrounds are only decent and the whole thing was just overly shiny. I much prefer the art from the Diamond/Pearl series that started with Rise of Darkrai. As with all the movies the plot centers around a hard to get legendary Pokemon, in this case Manaphy who was only available by playing Pokemon Ranger for the DS. Manaphy is the single most annoying Pokemon I have ever seen. I know that the language of most Pokemon is limited to repeating their own names but good Lord, Manaphy just continues to repeat `Mana, Mana, Mana' over and over and over again until it becomes torturous. Adults beware; this is one Pokemon that will irritate you to no end even if you're only hearing it from the next room over. In fact if your child is watching the movie in the next room you'll likely only hear Manaphy's shrill whine repeating Mana, Mana, Mana for what will seam like an eternity.

The protagonist of the story is Captain Phantom (think Captain Crunch with more attitude) and his group of sharp dressed pirates. They're in a quest against the Pokemon Rangers to get Manaphy, who can lead them to the treasure laden Sea Temple. The story isn't going to win any creativity awards. Now normally I like pirates and stories that take place in the Caribbean but this one just did not capture my attention. Maybe it was just the `Mana, Mana, Mana, Happy, Happy, Happy' that just drove me to distraction but I really didn't get into it at all and the ending was just goofy. This is one movie that will probably only appeal to young Pokemon fans. I would suggest skipping this one and heading straight to the Diamond/Pearl movies which are probably the only Pokemon movies that will appeal to viewers older than preteen.",1275609600,,2026,4.581267217630854
2736412,2,B000MKXF46,"The reason for my 2 star review is that as a Pokemon Movie, it doesn't really deliver what id expect. What i love most about Pokemon are the battles, the adventure and the laughs, Though this, like most of Ashs adventures is a big one, the story seemed bland and uninteresting to me, there were not enough Pokemon battles, not enough action and laughs. Me and a friend tried to watch it, but we were bored by the beginning half of the movie, and we just finished it cause we felt obligated, since i had just bought it. If those are the reasons you like Pokemon, pass on this movie, your not missing out on much.",1271030400,,611,4.275862068965517

2736414,5,B000MKXF46,"This movie revolves around May,and Manaphy,a baby Pokemon. Manaphy thinks May is its mother.

It's a rather bittersweet movie,most of the movie May is trying to seperate from Manaphy,but doesn't want to.

However,I still recommend it.",1249430400,,234,5.472222222222222

2736416,1,B000MKXF46,"Im a long time pokemon fan and movie after movie ive enjoyed watching my heroes adventures...However what should of been a great adventure turned out to be a calling for me.

Allow me to explain, The movie is great, the animation is awsome and the story is fresh and thrilling. However as good as it is the voice acting is what drags this film down horribly.

Pokemon Usa's decision to fire the original talented cast after 8 years of pokemon has backfired horribly. The characters have become dull,Boring and life less. Each word out of their mouth brings the quality of this amazing movie down and down.
Fans are fighting back now join them in their struggle to save pokemon and restore it to its former beauty before the giant that is Pusa crushes it for good. [...]",1220918400,3,769,4.565217391304348

Okay there are some parts that make little sense like Ash stealing the spotlight for no real reason but still... This movie is a sign that pokemon will continue to prosper for years to come!

By the way Ignore groups like sova who will try to convince you to boycott Pokemon simply because of a cast change!
The current voices show real potential! (especially when you compare the performances from this dvd to their work on the more recent episodes on tv.) I think if given time they will surpass the old voices!",1203379200,2,614,4.63302752293578
2736418,3,B000MKXF46,"This is part 10/10.  ""Pokemon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea"" seemed too long for me.  Although I think that they upped the ante for cute legendary Pokemon, I really do think that Kyogre could have played a larger role.  This movie definitely seemed more epic.  I felt more grown up watching this.  It was a hole lot of water though.",1200960000,,335,4.338709677419355

2736437,4,B000MKXF46,I love the whole plot of the movie and really wished they had Misty in somewhere because this would be here element.

2736441,4,B000MKXF46,"Well basically this is a movie about how Ash and friends encounter a Manaphy Pokmon Egg from a traveling performers. One of the people there is a Pokmon Ranger who's mission is to get Manaphy back into the sea to find the Sea Temple to protect it from the evil Phantom the Pirate who is after the Sea Crown.

The movie is pretty good, some will think it's similar to how Max & Jirachi became really close; May becomes really close to Manaphy, whom thinks May is it's mother. (kinda like Togepi with Misty)

I myself thought they could've had alot more battling in this movie since the point of Pokmon is to battle and collect Pokmon, this is why I only give it 4 stars, because it could've been so much better.",1178928000,2,710,4.330827067669173

2736443,4,B000MKXF46,A 'must'for all Pokmon fans.  Great for all groups.  So get out your popcorn and sit with your kids through another adventure full of suprises around every corner. I'm not going to give any of the details about this movie away...except that theres a big kid in all of us that want to experience the fun and adventures of Ash and his friends......You're just going to have to watch this to find out what its all about.,1178928000,,417,4.402597402597403
2736444,4,B000MKXF46,"Basically, this movie is decent.  It's not as bad as Pokemon 4ever, but it's not as awesome as Pokemon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew.  This movie is just average.  The graphics are beautiful, but the music isn't very interesting at all.  The voice acting is even worse, but that's only because of the new voice cast (why the heck did they replace the original cast that's been on the show for almost ten years?!!)

I was very upset about the case for these three DVDs (the movie, Pikachu's Island Adventure, and Pokemon Advanced Battle Vol. 1).  As soon as I opened the case, the pressure circle used to secure a DVD in the additional disk flap for the bonus DVDs that came with this set broke into pieces.  That left me with three DVDS, but only two places to put them.  Also, I was disappointed that the Advanced Battle bonus disk didn't come in its own case.  I collect the episode DVDs, and now it will look like my collection is incomplete because my Vol. 1 of Advanced Battle won't be with the rest.  Basically put, the case for this set is VERY generic.  I should have just bought the movie and Vol. 1 of Advanced Battle seperately, even though it would cost more.",1175990400,5,1173,4.409302325581395
