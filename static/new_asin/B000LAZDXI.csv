8160542,1,B000LAZDXI,"Seldom have I seen a worse movie, I mean seriously, this was supposed to be a high-energy sports drama, instead it felt like watching a long music video. The soundtrack was great, Riley Smith was pretty good and always nice to look at, but besides that, this film was poorly written, badly directed, and the acting was nauseating. To say it was a piece of crap, would be an insult to crap!",1361491200,,389,4.416666666666667
8160543,2,B000LAZDXI,"Whilte the movie seemed to have a decent plot, the action was non-existent.  A lot of shots of the main character driving around in his car listening to music.  There was quite a build-up to the final competition, but when it took place, it was over so  quickly (and in such a boring fashion), that I had to rewind and make sure I didn't miss anything.  Very disappointing experience.",1242777600,,384,4.521739130434782
