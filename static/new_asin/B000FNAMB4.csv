8124785,2,B000FNAMB4,"I'd been interested in silat (and other martial styles) for some time, so I finally ordered this dvd. First off, it seemed to be cheaply burned from an old vhs tape onto a disk. Second, there seems to be confusion as to what is on volume 1&2 (breaking and history were to be on 1 but were on 2, etc). When it comes to the juru short hand forms... it gets weird. The practitioner does a couple punches while slapping his arms... then the combat application shows a grab and sweep (huh?). You can pull some useful techniques and ideas from it if you are willing to dig (or are running out of new moves in traditional systems), but as a martial art tape, it looks sloppy, tense, and confused.",1176595200,,689,4.3076923076923075
