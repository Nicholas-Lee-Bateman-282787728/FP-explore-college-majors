251452,4,6300214583,"Used to watch this movie a lot when I was younger and recently discovered it in my ""video vault"".  It had been a long time.  The movie itself, however, still seems very competitive with todays drama/action type movies.

Peter Weller and Christopher Collet do an awesome job especially when Collet has to step up and battle against the drifter (Weller).  Corey Haim adds a view from most kids his age who have to endure this type of household living.

A very young Sarah Jessica Parker also makes her appearance as Collet's girlfriend in the film.  And of course Teri Garr, once again playing a mom in this film, but who nosedives and then realizes that her kids ARE in fact more important!  Good video, worth any price!",1105920000,4,719,4.6141732283464565
251453,3,6300214583,when i watch this movie i go back in time the eighties are so cool christopher collet was good corey haim also was good just the way the film was made i don't know this is a very good movie i will always have it,1057795200,3,211,3.7111111111111112
251454,5,6300214583,"Peter Weller was superb as the low-life riff-raff boyfriend in this film, from the first hung-over moment he appears on the screen to his nonchalant comment, after the kids later catch him and the mom with cocaine, ""Life goes on.""  Living in apartment complexes during the first half of the 1980s, I saw this same guy again and again, preying temporarily on single women, leeching off them for awhile, leaving their lives in varying degrees of shambles and abruptly moving on.  Weller was so good in this movie role, you could almost smell it on him.",1046822400,19,550,4.71875
251455,4,6300214583,"I would recommend this movie to Peter Weller and Terri Garr fans alike. Corey Haim gives a good performance as well, but it is far from the flippant teen idol roles he's favored for later. 'Firstborn' is a realistic look into many lives disrupted by divorce and adolescence. While it won't fit everyone's experience of these, it doesn't gloss over the issues. It's about a woman who is searching for emotional healing after her husband announces he is remarrying, two sons who are trying to deal with what they knew as 'family' dissintigrating, and a loner, small time drug dealer. But each character has one thing in common. Each person is trying to fit into life, and find where his or her life fits in with the rest of the world. You have a lonely, hurt divorcee, a boy who is almost a man, who has to be the man in the family suddenly, and a young boy who is confused by his father's abandonement, and his mother's sadness. Then comes the drifter who promises stability and affection to the family. Only problem is, the oldest boy (who feels the urge to protect his family) figures out real fast that the man offering the missing piece to the incomplete family is not what he seems. The mother, desperate for love and companionship is reluctant to see the man for what he is, bringing violence and drug use/selling into the house. Hollywood often portrays drugs as great entertainment, and the traffic of it profitable and empowering. 'Firstborn' shows the other side. It doesn't always make fast money and good friends. The boys also react in a very realistic way. They are at the age when self-examination and rebellion become a part of school, social life, and family. Further disruption and danger amplify the behavior, and is realistically exaggerated by threat, abuse and lies.",997488000,17,1787,4.730769230769231
251456,4,6300214583,"An interesting movie and one of my ""closet favorites"" that stands up over the years.  Peter Weller (later starred as  RoboCop)presents a very unique portrait of a loner/loser who desperately wants to be accepted as a strong father figure by the sons of his new single-mom girlfriend(Teri Garr).  He says all the things that you would expect a sincere family head to say (""we're going to be a close happy family""), even though his efforts are laughable due to their prematurity.  The oldest son is not buying any of it, and an overt hostility develops between the two.  Teri Garr, in one of her better serious roles, plays a mother who is torn between her need for a personal life and her love for her sons. The younger, 13 year old son (Corey Haim)has problems with fighting in school, and his older brother becomes his father figure as Garr and Weller become more deeply involved in drug usage, causing Garr to become an ineffective mother. A teen-aged Sarah Jessica Parker makes an appearance as the older boy's girlfriend who tries to break through his somber moods which result from Weller's heavy-handed and irresponsible attempts to father the boys.  The ending is somewhat predictable, but never-the-less satisfying as justice finally prevails.  Weller's character carries this story for me, from start to finish.",969840000,4,1320,4.9457013574660635
251457,4,6300214583,"I saw this movie a couple months ago when I disocvered it in the back of my t.v. guide. Unfortunately I had to go somewhere that day, so I  taped it. When I got home I immediately put the tape in the vcr and watched it.  It wasn't as good as I expected but it wasn't the worst thing either. I  think the movie would have been better with Corey Haim as the star and I  also didn't like the guy that played the boyfriend of the mom. I also  thought that the movie wasn't really realistic because when the older  brother hid the stash of coke, he wouldn't have told the guy where it was  and expected him not to hurt him. I thought that part was really dumb. So,  if you want an okay movie to watch for about an hour and forty minutes  watch this, but I wouldn't buy it if I were you.",947030400,,781,3.9235668789808917
251458,2,6300214583,"The one big problem I had with this movie is the scumbag, coke-dealing boyfriend is supposed to be the bad guy when the kids come off as bigger assholes.  Kinda made me wish the boyfriend would've killed her son after  recovering the stolen coke.  While it turns out the boyfriend has some  illegal dealings and comes on too strong, the role portrayed a sincere  effort to reach the kids.  Conversely, the children are either constantly  fighting, mouthing off to teachers and resisting any attempts to get along  (notwithstanding suspicious behavior and ongoings).  Not that black and  white cowboy hats should be used to know good from bad, but through the  large gray area came a sympathy for the boyfriend and thought that the kids  needed a good skullcracking (opposite of what was intended).  Few  adjustments would've taken this from so-so to a good movie.",924393600,,863,4.902777777777778
