The attention to detail is perfect, the length of the workout is great and the scenery is divine! Thank you to Christopher Anderl for making such a quality product!",1346716800,4,334,4.491803278688525
4152969,5,B003LIMWKO,"As an experienced Chi Gung practioner I found this DVD to be an excellent program for at home practice.  It is easy to follow, with detailed instructions and visual clarity.  Both beginners and advanced students will benefit. There are differentiated segments so the viewer can choose to do all the exercises or part as they wish.  It  incorporates tai chi and chi gung in a holistic and integrated manner.  The video is of high quality and the setting is inspirational.

4152970,5,B003LIMWKO,"I found this DVD to be excellent for learning Chi Gung and Tai Chi.  It is very helpful the way the DVD is divided into seven sections.  Each section is useful alone, and together they build upon one another.  A 5 minute healing movement section incorporates learning from the previous sections.  The photography is beautiful and the verbal descriptions of the movements are clear and concise.  There is a wonderful, flowing movement throughout the DVD. Learning Chi Gung for the first time, it was very useful to be able to slow the movements and repeat them as often as I needed.  A more experienced student can move easily to the more challenging sections.  I have tired other Chi Gung DVDs, and this one has progressed my learning the most and was fun and easy to follow.",1274832000,10,775,4.654411764705882

8399667,5,B003LIMWKO,"I am 62 years old but appear to all as a 40 year old. I am an adrenaline junkie, runner, cyclist etc. I have a strained muscle inside knee injury/minor but bothersome and TMJ on top of all this. In the meantime I have to slow down and reduce my workouts which is depressing me. Searching the web came up with Christophers DVD and am guided by
God to try Tai Chi. I know of a Tai Chi  master that has been healed/cured from knee injury and crohns disease...amazing and I know I am in the right place now. Can't wait to try this DVD for healing in all aspects of life.",1403654400,,566,4.053571428571429
8399668,3,B003LIMWKO,I was hoping for more instructions and practice for the qi gong movements.  The part that does show the body movements is brief.,1398470400,4,128,4.565217391304348
8399669,2,B003LIMWKO,"I was hoping to learn tai chi forms. This does not teach the forms, but is more about opening the energy meridians in your body. I ended up ordering Dr. Paul Lam's Beginner's Tai Chi. It goes step by step in teaching the tai chi forms. Much more helpful for what I wanted.",1378339200,5,272,4.150943396226415
8399670,5,B003LIMWKO,I have only progressed through the first two exercises. I'm 67 and wanted to start slow. Imagine my surprise when after only a few minutes I could feel the difference in my body! My right hip was hurting when I first started but after the little stretches  I could feel it start to relax. I'm hooked on Tai Chi! Thanks Mr Anderl!,1359504000,8,329,4.306451612903226
8399671,5,B003LIMWKO,"We enjoyed Christopher Anderl's relaxed yet expert instruction on the ancient healing movement arts. Christopher leads you through flowing movements, gentle stretches, self-massages and other mild techniques which are fun to do and easy to follow.  Each time after completing the seven sections (or most of them) we felt invigorated and relaxed.
Clearly the DVD was professionally made and obviously great care went into selecting the ourdoor hilltop setting which overlooks the ocean. The gentle breeze and music fit the relaxed mood and together with the setting combine to enhance the instructions. We highly recommend this DVD.",1358208000,7,631,5.505154639175258
8399672,5,B003LIMWKO,"This Tai Chi DVD is nicely produced, very relaxing background music and beautiful scenery. It is primarily devoted to Qi Gong series which are well explained with some Tai Chi movements. For anyone interested in holistic therapy, acupressure and/or Qi Gong this is a very nice series which is easy to follow. What it is NOT, is an instructional DVD on how to perform Tai Chi. Consequently it is not for beginners in Tai Chi nor for people primarily interested in learning actual ""physical"" Tai Chi. Rather, this DVD would better for those with basic Tai Chi knowledge who would like to incorporate Qi Gong or those primarily interested in starting to learn about Qi Gong and wish to have a basic routine to follow. The total DVD length is right at 1 1/2 hours and is broken into segments which may be completed at one time or over several sessions.",1348358400,9,848,4.622516556291391
8399673,5,B003LIMWKO,"Christopher Anderl does a great job of presenting Tai Chi/Qi Gong in an easy-to-follow, informative way. And the fact that it's divided into seven parts gives you the option of doing just one if you're feeling lazy or a little sick...or all seven if you're feeling ambitious and have the time. Either way, I always feel more focused and invigorated when I'm done. The outdoor setting is lovely, too, overlooking the ocean. I've tried some of the other follow-along videos on the subject and Christopher's is by far the best.",1347580800,10,524,4.833333333333333
