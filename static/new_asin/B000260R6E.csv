8022608,5,B000260R6E,"If you LOVE Pirates of Penzance, you will LOVE this version. It doesn't replace the Angela Landsbury version that we all know and love. This is the same story, same script mostly. Much much more personality than the Kevin Klein / Angela Landsbury version. A few more songs. SO much fun!  It's a live recording of a performance in Australia. It will have you laughing all the way through. I've seen this version at least 20 times and loved it each time. I wish I could find it again. I'd like to get additional copies to give to family.",1511049600,,535,4.404040404040404
8022609,1,B000260R6E,"I was so disappointed with this copy of the Pirates of Penzance. If you want a good copy, don't choose the play version, choose the movie version.

8022610,2,B000260R6E,Product will not play on a Blu-Ray disc player.  Had to play it on my laptop.  Still -- it is historically a gem to see Patricia Routledge in this role captured on film.,1247184000,,169,4.090909090909091
8022611,1,B000260R6E,"Unbelievably, the sellers of this product changed the credited name on the photo of the cover from ""Patricia Routledge"" to ""Angela Lansbury.""  This is the STAGE VERSION, not the movie version which includes Angela Lansbury in the cast.  If you are looking for that movie, it was not produced as a DVD in the US- you will either need to find a pirated (no pun intended!) copy or a VHS copy.

DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT unless you are looking for the stage version!",1244678400,10,460,4.4523809523809526
8022612,3,B000260R6E,"This is not the production of ""The Pirates of Penzance"" that was described in the Amazon information.  I sought the coveted 1983 production with Angela Lansbury as the maid Jane.  This production is another one which employed Patricia Routledge.  I returned it unopened.",1243641600,2,270,5.232558139534884
8022613,1,B000260R6E,"If you are looking for the 1931 movie (not the Broadway production), this is *not* it.  The product picture (which lists Angela Landsbury in the cast) is incorrect and the text description is describing some other product.  Film quality is also poor.",1242000000,4,250,4.928571428571429
8022614,1,B000260R6E,"this DVD will not play on 4 out of 5 DVD players that we tried, and when we did manage to play it we discovered it to be very grainy and of poor quality.

8022615,1,B000260R6E,"Potential buyers should be warned that this is not a DVD version of the made-for-film production that includes Angela Landsbury in the cast, though her name certainly appears on the box cover in the advertisement, the product description, and the reviews.  It appears that none of the reviewers actually own a DVD copy of this film, and are therefore commenting on a different production than the one being sold (which I already own). As I remember, the production being sold here has sound issues, and the volume fades in and out. Nonetheless, ""Hyacinth Bucket"" gives a very strong performance as the foolish nursery maid, and the production has other appealing features to collectors.",1217894400,36,686,5.070796460176991
8022616,4,B000260R6E,"WARNING

The DVD version of this title (ASIN B000260R6E) stars Patricia Routledge as Ruth and NOT Angela Lansbury, despite the cover.  It is identical to the version recorded live and sold under a different cover (ASIN B00006RCMW)

The VHS version (NTSC ASIN: 6300182762) I hope does star Angela Lansbury - I have it on order!",1213142400,,326,4.890909090909091
8022617,2,B000260R6E,"The cast list on the cover mentions Angela Lansbury, which suggests that this is the film version. I suspect that's a mistake.

The photo on the box shows Patricia Routledge, not Lansbury, and the label at the top says ""Broadway Theater Archive."" In other words, this is almost certainly the well-performed but badly recorded live 1980 performance in Central Park.

That stage production, which later transferred to Broadway, was taped for television. It apparently never aired due to serious technical faults (including a miscalibrated camera that produced overexposed, washed-out images; audio problems, etc.)

To make matters worse, the only known copy of the video -- used by Broadway Theater Archive for their release of the performance -- is a badly copied and timeworn workprint that exacerbates the existing flaws. It is not up to the professional broadcast standards of ANY decade, much less ours.

It's wonderful that a record of this performance exists, but know what you're buying. In any case, the Central Park performance is already available in a Region 1 disc, so there's no reason for people in North America to buy this Region 2 import.",1207785600,2,1154,5.122340425531915
