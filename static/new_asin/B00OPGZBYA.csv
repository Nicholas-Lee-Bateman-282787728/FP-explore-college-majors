6758634,5,B00OPGZBYA,"Even though I have a law enforcement and armory background, I still found it necessary to review this video. It reminded me of steps and precautions to take when building an A/R. I found it very helpful and professionally done. Jim is clear and concise with his instructions and he slows down when the going is tricky. I was able to see all the steps and methods making my build quick and easy. I recommend it to anyone considering a rifle build project.  JSK-Retired Law Enforcement",1442275200,,483,4.616279069767442
6758635,3,B00OPGZBYA,"Let me say I am new to this activity. And I guess I was expecting the ""ULTIMATE"" guide - and for me this is not it.  I do think it is well made and offers a lot of excellent tips like what order to assemble things and when to use duct tape to protect the finish before you start a step.  But I was under-whelmed by this DVD for 3 big (to me) reasons: 1)The camera is always too far away from the action to see what he was actually doing & the closer-ups were all done from a side view so his hands were always in the way.  There was really NO closeup camera work like I have seen in the Brownells videos on this subject. 2) There was no discussion or overview of tools needed - he just grabbed one out of the pile, says what it is and goes to work. Even more annoying is that he tells you that he is using several custom- made tools that I cant get,and no alternative is suggested.  3) This just a rehash of number one, but when he sorts the parts for the lower assembly, its nearly impossible to determine what each part is / looks like as he names them because the camera is 3 -4 feet away.  If I had to sort the lower parts kit with this video alone I would just give up.
 Worth having in the library but certainly not he ultimate build guide video.",1426723200,25,1252,3.9681274900398407
6758636,5,B00OPGZBYA,"I bought this DVD to help me build my first AR.  I don't have all of the parts yet to start my build, but watched the DVD anyway.  It was very well presented and I could tell that I will be able to easily follow along.  The tips and tricks that are included will be very helpful to me, and I can tell they would also be helpful to someone with previous experience building these guns.  The DVD is broken into chapters that have allowed me to easily re-watch certain parts.  The AR-15 facts that divide up the sections are really interesting, and the live fire at the end was cool.  Cant wait to start my build.  This is so much better than the AR-15 stuff Ive seen on You Tube.  This DVD is a great value for the money!",1417305600,,719,4.085714285714285
6758637,5,B00OPGZBYA,"This is a great ""How To"" DVD whether it's your first AR build, or your four-hundredth build!  He tells you all the little tricks as well as what to watch out for in assembling your own AR.  And then there's the trivia that goes along with it and makes it more enjoyable than your average ""put Tab A into Slot B"" how to video. I've been around guns a bit, and it's pretty obvious Jim has too, so if you're looking to raise the bar on your next build, give this a shot.  An excellent bargain for the money!  I'd suggest this as a gift for yourself or maybe for someone you know over the Holidays!  Keep 'em coming Gun Coach!",1416960000,4,622,4.107438016528926
6758638,5,B00OPGZBYA,"I had the pleasure of meeting Jim VanMiddlesworth this past weekend and got to talk with him about some lingering questions I had concerning doing a build.

This video is pretty impressive. Jim explains each and every step of building your AR and offers tips as to to why you're doing what you're doing. He also stresses which tools are essential and which are optional for the first-time builder. The function of the bolt carrier group is explained in great detail. I've saved many AR-15 ""how to"" videos from YouTube but this video helps tie it all together and helps explain some issues I'd not found the answer to elsewhere. The presentation helps explain the ""why"" and not just the ""how"" of building one of these rifles.

Again, this video is geared toward the first-time builder and not gunsmiths. Information on headspacing is limited to taking your finished build to a qualified gunsmith for inspection. A section on cleaning and maintenance would also have been helpful. Otherwise this is an excellent tutorial for anyone doing their first build and would be a worthy addition to one's reference library.",1415577600,11,1112,4.909574468085107
6758639,5,B00OPGZBYA,"Having just completed my third AR-15 build, it is my opinion that Jim VanMiddlesworth has produced the best tutorial of any that I have seen on-line or by way of DVD. Each step of the build process is explained verbally and the camera work is perfect and clear enough to show just how the part is installed. Kudos to Jim, this is  absolutely a five star production in my opinion.

6758648,5,B00OPGZBYA,"great video, as is the first edition that was already out.
I was bummed though as I like to rip my DVDs to watch on my tablet, and this was built with a structure that I'm unable to grab the ""Main Movie"" as it's a series of shorter ""movies"" (chapters?) that combine in the structure to form a complete movie.
Not sure how to explain that but picture opening several videos in Media Player. It'll play one after another till they're done, as though it's one continuous movie, but they're still separate videos. downside is they're more the DVD format so I'd have to convert each one individually.
That's all beside the point though, as the DVD does exactly what it's supposed to.  Good quality, and Jim is an excellent teacher/instructor.  No nonsense of ""Because it says to"", but more practical and necessary information.",1458518400,,821,4.694444444444445

6758658,5,B00OPGZBYA,"I purchased this DVD elsewhere, as it was out of stock on Amazon when I 'needed' it, for my first AR build.
This DVD is just about perfect.  The instruction Jim gives is very clear.  I recommend watching the DVD first, start to finish, then, as you are building, watch it again.  If you are new to this like I am, some of the instruction moves a little fast, I had to pause/rewind a few times at certain points.
One thing that I found confusing, was that in Jim's video, when installing the trigger guard, he uses one that has a detent on one end, so the guard can be flipped open for shooting with a gloved hand.  My kit came with a polymer trigger guard, with no such detent.  It took a few minutes for me to figure out what to do, but I eventually realized that my trigger guard installs with a hex grub screw on that end.
My only complaint on Jim's instructional methods, is that he doesn't zoom in enough on some of the parts so you can't easily see what he's doing some times.  Hence the need to pause/rewind in some places.
My kit was a full upper, so I only used the lower build & final assembly portions of this DVD.  My build was complete in less than 2 hours, would have been less time had I not made a couple mistakes!
Again, I suggest watching this well before you plan to build, if it's your first time.  Jim shows some great tools that make the build go much easier, so you may want to allot time to acquire such tools.",1451520000,,1434,4.1516245487364625
