513824,5,6302800692,"This is a typical movie about a modest banker, a man who needs to ""belong"" somewhere.  That somewhere turns out to be the United States Army.  Mr. Winkle (played by Edward G. Robinson) was drafted, and persisted in making it through Basic Training, after building some good friends in his squad. Mr. Winkle went on to be a heavy equipment operator/mechanic, and was eventually shipped out to the Pacific with his battalion. Even though he was of an age that should have kept him from front line duty, he persisted in staying with his squad. It was during a heated fire-fight that he had an opportunity to start the dozer he was working on, and to lower the blade and over-run an enemy machine gun emplacement with it.  For this heroic and brave action, he was honored, even though he received an injury.  During his return to home life, and to avoid the small-town hero's welcome, he got off the bus one stop earlier, and walked home.
His previously ""stuffed-shirt""  wife now was happy to be the wife he had hoped for.
It's a movie where the hero can now continue in fullfillment of his dream of having a fix-it shop in his back-yard garage.  It's kinda hard to find this VHS movie in such good condition.  Thanks to the someones who did not mistreat either the tape or the cover box.",1297123200,,1284,4.508620689655173
513825,5,6302800692,"I remember watching this back in 1987, and it really didn't hit me too much back then as I was only 19 at the time. However, now nearing 38 I can certainly appreciate the movie alot more. It stars Edward G. Robinson as Mr. Winkle who is an accountant, but secretly longs for alot more than doing accounting, but his wife doesn't even want him thinking of doing anything she would consider foolheartdly. WW2 begins, and Winkle volunteers for the Army, and halfway through basic his sergant calls him out to let him know he's been reassigned to a desk job which crushes Mr. Winkle, and to the point of begging the Sergant at a night club to reconsider, and Mr. Winkle gets arrested. However, some good did come out of it, and Mr. Winkle gets to tell his desire to work in a motorpool, and work with his hands, and being a soldier. The sergant while not necessarily understanding why, he understood what it would mean to Winkle, so he gives him a chance, and Winkle is happy, but during a exercise with a tank Winkle is injured, and has to be hospitalized all to the displeasure of his wife. It took a little boy that Winkle adopted to make Winkle's wife understand that this is what Winkle wanted even though he was in his 40's. I say ""More Power To You Mr. Winkle."" I'm currently enrolled back in school to work on a degree that I had to put aside 11 years ago, and I want to see it through. I have age, my own family, and my own fears working against me, but I'm not giving up. I know if my wife were alive today she would be like ""Why do it now?"" ""You should've had this all done in your 20's."" I use my grandfather as my role model; he was an alcoholic up till he was 40, and then he quit cold turkey because he wanted to learn how to drive a car. There's no such thing as too late as long as you're breathing.",1116547200,13,1812,4.18
513826,5,6302800692,"I'll never get tired of watching this.  WWII, the home front, quitting his job at the bank, opening up a fix-it shop, disapproval from the missus, induction, training, furlough, hooking up with some babes, shipping out to combat, coming home a hero, reconciliation with his wife---and all from the perspective of a guy who could've left the Army anytime because of his age (40+).  How sweet it was!  Not to be missed is Dick Haymes, Jack Armstrong, Dick Lane, & EGR's performance of ""Sweet Genevieve"" at the canteen.",982713600,13,516,4.840909090909091

513853,4,6302800692,"My husband remembered this film and wanted to see it again after many years.  An older man goes to war, and influences a lot of lives through his courage and principles.

His wife (Ruth Warrick of CITIZEN KANE and ""All My Children"" fame), is an overbearing wife who berates him for doing this.  To her he is a fool.  Winkle decides to do his duty and join the Army, only to do construction in the war zone.  His wife sees what a man her husband really is, when he comes back from war a hero, and is no longer a doormat.  She finds she likes him that way.",1393200000,5,516,3.970873786407767

7831495,4,6302800692,"Edward G. Robinson made a lot of movies and the majority of them are above average to excellent. To rate this movie I am somewhat biased due to being a huge fan. Mr. Winkle is a good movie, keeps you interested and easy to follow. The storyline in this movie is hard to put belief in because of the fact that it could not happen in this day and time. But when the movie was made it was different. Again I enjoyed the movie and will watch it again and again but I feel you need to enjoy the older movies and respect the times they were made.",1479859200,,540,4.0092592592592595

7831498,5,6302800692,"This became one of my favorite movies from the 1940s after watching it on TCM.  In my opinion, it's a great reflection of the dedication of the men who served our nation during WWII.  My father, in fact, was drafted in 1943 despite his age, like the character Mr Winkle.",1475107200,,270,4.38
