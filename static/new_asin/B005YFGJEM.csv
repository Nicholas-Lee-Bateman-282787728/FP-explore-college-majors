4906456,1,B005YFGJEM,Not a review but I love the artwork showing the Titanic hitting the iceberg on the PORT side of the ship instead of the starboard side  Hilarious.  I mean ......really???,1335225600,4,170,4.633333333333334
4906457,4,B005YFGJEM,I am a history buff and really found this DVD to be extremely interesting.  The 3D version made it something you have to see.,1378771200,,125,4.208333333333333
4906458,5,B005YFGJEM,This is a wonderful 3D documentary that allows one to see deep into the Titanic with stunning detail. Very high budget dive which which uses remarkable mini ROVs that are able to penatrate the deepest parts of the bow.,1367625600,,218,4.615384615384615
4906459,3,B005YFGJEM,The views of the ship were breathtaking in 3D.What ruined  the  film for me was that we  have heard the story  so many times before  that it would have been  a better  film if all the padding and boring narration were omitted and the film  showed only the actual wreck  and some background music. That  would have been a brilliant concept. Too little  of the wreck was seen.,1362873600,,374,4.352941176470588
4906460,4,B005YFGJEM,We were a little disappointed with this purchase as we thought at the time we were getting the actual 3D Titanic with Leonardo DiCaprio.  This turned out to be a documentary & was still interesting once over the disappointment of not being the actual movie.  Now we have both & are happy with our purchases.,1362528000,,307,4.5636363636363635
4906461,2,B005YFGJEM,"This was not at all what the description had led me to believe. I wish I'd saved my money.

Sad.",1362441600,,96,3.8
4906462,4,B005YFGJEM,"This documentary emphasizes genuine, native 3d cinematography of the remains of the Titanic, supplemented with ok recreations of key passengers, staff, crew, and other characteristics of the original ship.  It's an ideal companion piece to the new 3D
conversion of James Cameron's Titanic.",1351382400,,289,5.72093023255814
4906463,2,B005YFGJEM,"ITs only 45 minutes. And with that only minutes of 3d recording. Its more like a demo bluray
I hope the make a correct 3d titanic bluray with hours of recording. This i just a waste of my money",1348358400,2,193,3.9743589743589745
4906464,5,B005YFGJEM,"I bought mine at Sams for $14 including tax and for that price this was an outstanding purchase.  Yes, some of the visuals are not the best 3d except for the 3D of the ship itself at depth.  But the overall telling of the story was quite good and I found 3D effects satisfying.  Can see why some might not but for me this was very well done and for price I paid I am highly satisfied.  I have the Titanic movie in 3D on order but in meanwhile very pleased I made this purchase.",1346025600,2,477,3.9894736842105263
4906465,4,B005YFGJEM,"Titanic 100yrs History channel in 3D. has some truly great 3D images of the ship resting on the ocean floor. Not just the 3D, but the sharpness and lighting are also top notch. If you're interested in seeing some excellent shots of the wreckage, this is definitely a satisfying view.

Now, as far as the documentary goes, I'd say it's not really much better or worse then the many Titanic documentaries that have been seen on cable since the new millennium began. It's decent enough.

Despite another review, I had no problems playing this on my 3D computer and the 3D was fine. No problems at all. I must say, however, that I saw no way to play this in 2D. I tried just out of curiosity, and just got double images. So, it would seem if you don't have 3D, you'd probably do best to wait on this one. I know all 3D Blu-rays (at least the movies) are supposed to include a 2D version and I'll keep trying. If I can get it to work, I'll update. There is no 2D option on the menu, however.

Again, this review is for the History Channel Blu-Ray titled, ""Titanic, 100 years in 3D"".

Final note, If you're into Titanic history and have 3D capabilities, this IS a good addition to your 3D collection, but mainly because of the underwater 3D. Also note it's only about 45 min long, but it's also (as of this writing) reasonably priced. Not a bad deal at all.",1345161600,6,1351,4.32806324110672
4906466,3,B005YFGJEM,"This movie was mistakenly advertised as the Cameron blockbuster in 3D for $20 with pre-order guarantee.  If you suddenly end up with the wrong film give Amazon a call.  They know about their error, and will fix the order for you!",1342137600,2,229,4.560975609756097

8489302,5,B005YFGJEM,Fantastic views of the Titanic in its current and final resting place. The 3D scenes are amazing and you can see incredible levels of detail. I watched it with my 8 year old daughter and it kept her attention!,1449878400,,209,4.384615384615385

8489304,5,B005YFGJEM,"Astounding 3D, never before seen footage of the wreck site and a satisfying run time combine to make this Titanic documentary arguably one of the best. A must have for both Titanic enthusiasts and 3D fans.",1445990400,2,205,4.722222222222222
8489305,5,B005YFGJEM,thank you,1429488000,,9,4.0
8489306,5,B005YFGJEM,WOW! So many things in the debris field that you never get to see in previous videos and places on the once grand liner and you learn more about the passengers who were masquerading as a married couple but were actually lovers.,1425340800,2,227,4.428571428571429
8489307,4,B005YFGJEM,"The 3D is great, but this thing is waaay too short. Again...Damn! If you're gonna make and release a beautiful, cool, unique experience for your LED, LCD, 3D Smart T.V.....Gimme at least an hour-and-a-half people. 3D's great but you want more. On a more positive note, it was cool having little ""floaty, ocean specs"" flying around the room and around your face"" during the underwater scenes. All-in-all, you really have to get this one for both the 3D experience and the fact that, ""yeah ok...It is a Titanic doc, and it is different, and it is a neat 3D experience afterall. and it's good enough to buy."" Enjoy!",1392163200,5,612,4.675925925925926
