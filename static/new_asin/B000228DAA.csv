8020270,3,B000228DAA,"The DVD was different than what I expected. I still appreciate it for what it is, especially considering there are very little (practically none) DVDs on the SAS. Soldier-1 is excellent but the rest of the documentary needs to be redone. There is some good footage from Operation-Nimrod, and then later, the GSG-9______but it really needs to be re-edited, etc. I don't know if this DVD is out of print, but it wasn't $99.99 when I bought mine_NEW. I think I paid about $9.99 for my copy at Tower-Records, 4 years ago. Don't pay more than $14.99!",1205971200,2,545,4.628865979381444
8020271,2,B000228DAA,"I was disappointed w/ the DVD/video.  It seems more like a glorified CNN report (with rather poor production/editing) than a truly informative, ""behind the scenes"" glimpse into this amazing special forces group.  Save your money and buy something different.",1123718400,13,257,5.564102564102564
8020272,4,B000228DAA,"I enjoy and appreciate this particulat DVD. ""Soldier I"" has no flair for the dramatic and just explains how it was. He even cracks a few jokes. The narrator was a bit annoying but thorough. All in all a good watch.",1108771200,6,214,4.2439024390243905
