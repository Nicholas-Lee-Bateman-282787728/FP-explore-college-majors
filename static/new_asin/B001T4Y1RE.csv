8340574,3,B001T4Y1RE,"I have purchased each Welk Synergy video offered.  This one is a real disappointment.  The video quality is VERY poor on the only ""true"" black and white show.  The other two shows were produced in color, but are presented in VERY poor black and white on this one.  I am a TRUE Lawrence Welk fan, and like most Welkies, the older the show, the better.  We need more 1950s shows, and episodes of ""The Plymouth Show"" aka ""Top Tunes And New Talent"", or the regular 1950s Saturday Welk shows.

If the next collection offered has shows from the 60s again, I will pass on it.",1237507200,11,568,4.3619047619047615
