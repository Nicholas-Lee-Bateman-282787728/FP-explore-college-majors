It was great working that weel at the Disney Gold Oak Movie Rank in Santa Clarita, California. It was Doug McClure's like motion picture before we lost him to cancer. Bob and Delores Hope visited us and Michael Ironside was a great actor as is Bruce Dern and Vondie Kurtis Hall. The movies was made for television and has a credible story line and Levi was a superb director! The pay was good and the food was excellent and no one pulled rank to go ahead of the line, very democratic! By the way, they added the piano music later as their piano was hollow inside!",1395878400,5,651,4.258064516129032
7862562,3,630410880X,"I am very impressed indeed at the quality of the tape, first released nearly 20 years ago!  Crystal clear, plays perfectly.

And I loved the story.  Definitely a TV-movie type, but fun anyway to see the plot unwind.  It was a bit jarring to begin with very grim scenes of murder of a family and then segue into the rest of the Sting-type story but all in all great fun to see MI playing a good guy, and a cowboy to boot.  Obviously his comic skills have been grossly underused in his career.",1280793600,3,491,4.236559139784946
7862563,5,630410880X,"While Randy Travis' small acting parts in the movie leave something to be desired, The overall movie is great!!  This is a great western for all of us who have always wanted to get back at the people who make our lives tougher!  The guy who plays ""Saw"" is in this movie and does a great job with his part as the bad guy's ""right hand"" man.  All the actors are great but you have to give all the credit to the great and powerful Bruce Durn!  He plays a great bad guy!  I love this movie and would recommend it to everyone!!Chris",1202083200,6,527,4.077669902912621

Starring Micheal Ironside and Bruce Dern, this movie is filled with humor and action... amazingly without either  going over the top! I highly recommend!",929232000,4,258,4.863636363636363
