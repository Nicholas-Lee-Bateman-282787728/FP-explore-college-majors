The film 'Camille' which should have appeared on this DVD appears to have been substituted with something called 'Lady Hamilton' staring Michelle Mercier and Richard Johnson.",1109980800,30,313,5.5

8043850,3,B0006Z2NRC,The movies weren't that good and the quality seemed dated. It was cheap but I guess you get what you pay for.,1372550400,,109,4.0
8043851,2,B0006Z2NRC,"The quality of the image is not great and this is a huge minus for me !
Some of the movies in that collection are not exactly ""favorites"" but this is just my taste ....",1323302400,,168,3.8285714285714287
8043852,1,B0006Z2NRC,"I bought this in 2008, and it didn't have the important words, Colin Firth and Camille.  I wrote and complained and they sent me the same dvd again (can they waste money like this?).  Now, I see that they are still advertising the dvds with Colin Firth's name on it.  In the UK, we could take them to court for getting our money under false pretences!  DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU WANT COLIN FIRTH TO BE ON IT - HE'S NOT!!",1293408000,,416,4.098765432098766
8043853,5,B0006Z2NRC,"Romantic Movie Favorites is a collection of nine romantic movies that have only one thing in common: they are all public domain and as such it is possible for them to be presented in highly affordable collections. I paid $9.98 for my set and that comes down to about a dollar per movie. The way that movie tickets cost nowadays, you really cannot complain about this collection.

An added bonus of this collection is the fact that hardly any of these movies are available on other public domain collections.  Romantic Movie Favorites is a great 9 movie collection.

Anyways, here is how I rate the movies in Romantic Movie Favorites:

Great:

Jane Eyre (1971)

Good:

Arch of Triumph (1985)
Lady Hamilton (1969)
Promise of Love (1980)
The Last of the Belles (1974)

Average:

The Gamble (1988)
Lady and the Highwayman (1989)

Bad:

Hazards of the Heart (1987)
The Right-Hand Man (1987)",1206403200,22,885,4.7947019867549665
8043854,3,B0006Z2NRC,I too bought this DVD because of Camille and Colin Firth. I have watched a couple of the films and will keep the DVD but I would like to know how come Camille is written on one of the disc but is not actually on the DVD can someone provide an explanation???,1110585600,11,257,3.9615384615384617
8043855,1,B0006Z2NRC,"I have just received this DVD from Amazon. ""Camille"" is not even on this dvd. I am very disappointed with this. The only reason I bought this DVD is for Colin Firth and Camille.  The word ""Camille"" is written on one of the DVDs but it does not contain the movie.  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!

8043856,1,B0006Z2NRC,"I have just received this DVD from Amazon. The cover looks almost identical except it is missing two very important words,'COLIN FIRTH'. He is not even on this dvd.
