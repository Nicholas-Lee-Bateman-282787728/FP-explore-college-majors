8258379,2,B0015GJ3VA,"The video on this disk is very jerky, so much so that I found it difficult to watch. It appears this is due to a bad conversion from PAL to NTSC - examining the video on a PC, I found that every 4th frame was repeated, and some frames were clearly missing altogether.",1268784000,2,267,4.056603773584905
8258380,5,B0015GJ3VA,"To anyone who winds up on this website looking for this DVD and sees that some idiot is selling it for $500, know that it's easily obtainable from richarddawkins.net for $25. Or, you can use that $500 and buy a round-trip ticket to London and still have some money left to buy this in a Channel-4 store.

$500? Really? Guess I can't blame you for trying.",1239840000,9,354,4.363636363636363
