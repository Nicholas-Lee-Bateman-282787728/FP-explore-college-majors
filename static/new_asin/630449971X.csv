894262,5,630449971X,"Legendary screen star Bette Davis gives one of her finest performances as Esther Cimino, a 73 year old woman who goes off the deep end shortly after being widowed. Hastily diagnosed by a doctor as having senile dementia, the befuddled and clearly confused Mrs. Cimino is adjudicated incompetent and has her home, business, and other assets placed in the hands of a questionable trustee, as her sons ineffectually look on.
Mrs. Cimino's loving granddaughter, Karen, sees to her welfare, usurping her father, Mrs. Cimino's son, who is all too ready to consign his mother to a sterile and expensive institution. Karen places her grandmother in a caring, convalescent home, which is  governed by a director who has a personal rapport with all those in her care. Under the director's patient ministrations, Mrs. Cimino's memory and mind heal, only to discover that her sons have allowed the trustee to sell her home and all her personal belongings, including her beloved piano.
Her dignity and health restored, Mrs. Cimino sets about salvaging what she can of her life. She seeks to regain her independence and assert control over her remaining assets. On the road to self determination, she finds a long lost friend of her youth, Barney (Keenan Wynn), and his love for her inadvertently spurs her on to regain what she has lost.
Ms. Davis gives a powerful and affecting performance in the  role of Esther Cimino, playing her with intelligence, grace, sensitivity, and dignity. Ms. Davis makes Mrs. Cimino a fully three dimensional woman, one whom the viewer comes to admire and respect. Ms. Davis is simply sensational.
Keenan Wynn is wonderful as Barney, a vital, vigorous, and sexy senior citizen in whose heart hope springs eternal. His relationship with Esther suggests to the viewer that the best is yet to come. It is through her relationship with Barney that the viewer discovers the underlying trauma that triggered the breakdown that set Esther on her personal odyssey.
This is an illuminating film on issues confronting the  elderly, and the assumptions that are often made about them by society and family. It allows the viewer to see the fate of so many of the elderly today, given the quality of care for those who may not be able to care for themselves. It also explores alternative possibilities which tantalize the viewer with what could be. This is also not a film that is afraid to explore the possibililty of romantic love among the elderly.
All in all, this is a terrific movie that can be appreciated and enjoyed by young and old alike.",1016236800,10,2553,4.905092592592593
894263,5,630449971X,"An excellent film.  Bette Davis is beyond equal in her betrayal of what happens to elderly people when life creates change and they cannot adapt.  Also focuses on the family, their eagerness to make her appear confused and  put her away in a nursing home for their convenience.  This film depicts  how Mrs. Cimino's granddaughter rescues and rehabilitates her grandmother.  As an AACN board certified RN in Gerontology, I see this happen every day.  Maybe if more people were aware of this movie, we would treat our elderly  in a more caring manner.  You might not be old now, but you will be  someday.",955670400,9,602,4.701923076923077
7873451,3,630449971X,"Sad but interesting film about how a massive loss can plunge older people into dementia, but  also how music can dramatically turn things around for them and make their mind healthy again.  Something to keep in mind re: widows & widowers!!  A little loving interest in them can go a long way.",1505347200,,292,4.576923076923077

Now I am glad to have a replacement VHS to share with friends. The story has a meaningful message for widows, trying to find a place of belonging among family and friends.",1422921600,,300,4.189655172413793

My parents who also were cast as extras did appear briefly in one of the dining room scenes.  Was an interesting experience watching Bette Davis. I thought it was a very good movie.",1374624000,,341,4.328125

She is greatly disappointed.
I can't rate it because we couldn't watch it. Amazon did not notify me that I could no longer return it. I discovered this one week after I  requested return info only by reviewing my previous 6month's of orders.",1360108800,,468,4.131868131868132

They take over her financial accounts and turn them over to a flaky banker.  He doesn't manage the accounts well and she has to go to court to get control of her finances again.  Her granddaughter steps in and helps her to regain her independence and it ends very well and happy for her.

that it was never put on DVD, plus the VHS is no longer produced.
I was very gratified to find an old VHS from Amazon
It is a wonderful Movie that everybody should see. Betty Davis
is the star of how her family assumed because she was getting older, they should
make all the decisions for her.  Families should never assume, because you
grow older, you aren't able to make good decisions that would bring happiness to yourself.",1344211200,,480,4.454545454545454

7873460,5,630449971X,"A Piano For mrs. Cimino is truly a poignant, and heartwarming film that I highly suggest to all.

""One woman's struggle against senility...and the system.

Soon after being widowed a bewildered Esther Cimino(Bette Davis)finds her mind and her world sliping away. Declared incompetent by the court, Esther's home and music store are the first to go as her sons hastily divide up her assets.

But Esther's college-age granddaughter, Karen, won't allow her grandmother to vanish into the oblivion of senility. Karen infuses her grandmother with love and determination, and an innovative convalescent hospital awakens her memory and sense of dignity.

Released fromt he hospital, Esther finds Barney (Keenan Wynn), a long-lost friend whose love gives her courage to fight for her independence. Bette Davis' performance as Esther is sensitive and moving in the tradition audiences have come to expect from this legendary screen star.",1134777600,4,928,5.423611111111111
