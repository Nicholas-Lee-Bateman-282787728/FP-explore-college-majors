1348734,5,B00004SZK6,"I also have purchased other facial exercise videos in the past and none have given results like Face Aerobics. I found it simple to do, and very easy to follow Judith's examples. I was feeling a bit down on my birthday last year as the years were beginning to show on my face. I have now reversed the clock with this program. It is not going to make you look 20 but it will make you look the very best for your age. By the way, a surgical face lift WILL NOT make you look 20 either. You will look unaturally stretched and different. Your skin and/or facial muscles will be damaged, and in 6 to 8 yrs you'll need another lift. With natual gentle Face Aerobics you'll simply be maintaining your results for the rest of your life. So, what would you rather do? Spend [twenty] for a safe, healthy, natural face lift or [fifteen grand] for surgery with temporary results and risks?",1066176000,17,876,4.347560975609756
1348735,5,B00004SZK6,"I have to admit, when I saw Judith Olivia demonstrate the facelift exercises on Good Morning America, I was a bit skeptical at first.  Because of health reasons, cosmetic surgery is not an option for me. So, I decided to give it a try. The results came quickly. Even my husband noticed the difference. With just a little bit of working out my facial muscles, my cheeks and jawline are lifted and my double chin is gone. Face Aerobics may seem like it's too good to be true, but it really does work.",1066176000,7,498,4.354838709677419
1348736,5,B00004SZK6,"I bought the Face Aerobics video after reading about Miss Olivia in Shape Magazine. Exercise works for the body, why not for the face? At first, I was concerned that facial exercises would cause MORE wrinkles- that's what I've heard before. But, Olivia says that in the past, other facial exercises DID cause problems because they were stretching the skin. Face Aerobics exercises were designed to strenghthen and tone up the facial muscles WITHOUT stretching the delicate skin on the face.
So, I took the plunge and followed the video's advice- doing the exercises almost everyday for two weeks. Wow! I don't look tired anymore. The eyebags were the first to go, and then my jawline and cheeks perked up. I do not look ""pulled"" like I've seen on many cosmetic surgery patients. People comment that I have lost weight or look great even without makeup on.
Now I do Face Aerobics 2-3 times a week to maintain my new face. I think I look 10 years younger. (I am 53) But, I feel 20 years younger!
I would say, BUY this video. It's easy to follow along with rather than try to imitate the exercises out of a book. I've learned to do the exercises sowell, that I do them while I wash the dishes, walk the dog and even when I take a shower.
Thank you Judith Olivia for Face Aerobics!",1065571200,25,1277,4.484978540772532
1348737,5,B00004SZK6,"I bought this video because I'm a fitness nut and realized that I should not be neglecting my neck and face. Even though I'm only 30 years old and don't have sagging yet, I figure it's never too early to get ahead. As I watch women in my family getting older, I realize the jowels and chin area tend to be the first to droop. Judith's video works these areas hard! The exercises are intense but it's amazing how quickly you build strength in each area.
I thought my lips seemed fuller when I put my lipstick on... then my husband commented on how much fuller my lips look!! After only 1 full week of doing this video, my lips are definitely plump to the max!! I will continue doing these exercises as I grow older because there is no doubt in my mind that they'll keep my face and neck strong and young!
My only comment is on the video quality...my initial reaction was that it seemed to be done by an amateur and I was immediately skeptical about the exercises. However, as I mentioned, the results are awesome and the look of the video is quickly forgotten. I have sent away for the free sample skin kit, but haven't received it yet so I cannot comment on that. Whether you have an existing problem area to work on or you're like me, just trying to keep sagging at bay, definitely give Face Aerobics a try!",1053475200,11,1308,4.299595141700405
1348738,5,B00004SZK6,"I had seen Miss Olivia on TV about 2 years ago, and bought her Face aerobics for myself. Friends & family have commented about the youthful changes to my face, and wanted to know where they could get the video. It is really that effective. Her skin treatment is an awesome exfoliator- which you get to try for free!",1046044800,11,315,4.3559322033898304
1348739,5,B00004SZK6,I am thrilled to say that my skin is now quite tight! I am grateful for Face Aerobics because I've tried the rest to no avail. My face is showing incredible results which people are noticing. The most important affect is my own sense of vigor and vitality! Lori- age 63,1000944000,11,269,4.294117647058823
1348740,5,B00004SZK6,Not too long ago I purchased the Face Aerobics program as well as the Advanced video. I've been doing the facial exercises and notice a difference in my skin after just a few days! Even my husband noticed the  difference;) The Face Aerobics video is easy to follow with Judith Olivia  leading the way. I have purchased other facial exercise programs and threw  them all in the trash after trying Face Aerobics. This video is simply the  best!,964915200,20,442,4.628205128205129
1348741,4,B00004SZK6,"This video gives you exercises to strengthen and tone all 52 facial muscles which are directly attached to the skin above them.  This 20-minute program will work each muscle group.  The video also contains skin care  suggestions. If you are not willing to pay hundreds of dollars for a Dermal  Tone machine, then this might be a great solution.  These exercises will  increase blood flow and oxygen to the surface of your skin.  Judith Olivia  personally guides you through all the exercises.  I found this video to be  the best one I have tried as far as face exercises go.  The dramatic  effects can be realized in as little as a few weeks. No cosmetic on earth  is going to tone your face the way this video will.

1348742,4,B00004SZK6,"I had purchsed this tape for my library, at a patron's request.  After it was returned, I figured I'd give it a try.  I thought that the first few days doing the exercizes were giving me MORE lines, especially on my forehead. However, after some slight adjustments in the way I did the exercizes, I noticed my face felt firmer and the lines around my mouth and nose have noticably been smoothed out and much less defined! I'm now going to purchase a copy of my own!

I only gave it 4 stars though, due to the slightly blurred video quality (rather amateur production values, but I guess its to be expected due to the year it was made) and especially the LONG infomercial for her face products.

Overall, a great (and cheap!) alternative to BOTOX!",1097366400,24,746,4.463235294117647
1348743,5,B00004SZK6,"My doctor suggested I try Face Aerobics because his wife loves this video. After losing over 40 pounds, the skin on my face was loose and sagging - no more fat to fill out my wrinkles! I never thought I'd look old and wrinkly just from losing weight. I was ready to quit my diet and gain weight just so I could have my ""plump"" face back.

So I did the exercises everyday for about two weeks and the results are incredible. My face is now tight and tone since I ""plumped"" up my face with muscle instead of fat. Thanks to Face Aerobics, I have a firm, strong face to match my body!",1095811200,18,579,4.078947368421052
1348744,5,B00004SZK6,"I have been exercising my face with Face Aerobics for the last month and I am amazed at the difference already! My face looks so much younger! I am especially pleased with the way the exercises have sculpted my jaw line and firmed up my ""turkey"" neck. I still have not completely lost my double chin, but I think I'll have to lose a few pounds for that.

The exercises in this video are easy to learn. Each exercise is demonstrated in a clear and effective manner. I have learned the exercises well and committed them to memory. Now I do the exercises while I'm in the car, watching TV or while I'm one the phone!

Face Aerobics is terrific and has saved me thousands of dollars in cosmetic surgery. I will continue exercising my face and keep recommending this video to everyone!",1095811200,16,780,4.4475524475524475
1348745,5,B00004SZK6,"I just had to comment on the last person who left negative remarks about Face Aerobics. If you look at what ""jwheeler76"" has reviewed, she's left bad comments for everything she's tried! I just can't believe how someone would criticize a program when they haven't even done the exercises! Personally, it's worked wonders for me. I get comments all the time on how great I look. In fact, I've had many people guess me to be 10 years younger than my actual age. However, I didn't achieve these results by doing the exercises once in a while! It takes time and determination, but believe me, it will pay off!",1093910400,15,605,4.559633027522936
1348746,2,B00004SZK6,"I have consistently used these exercises for three weeks since my initial review, and I am seeing good results.  I would upgrade the rating to three or four stars if the Amazon system allowed. I don't see reviews as fan clubs or marketing opportunities:  I read them to find out what I am getting, and I write them to let others know that.  This is a brief but effective set of exercises on a poorly produced, relatively expensive tape.  Sorry I can't be more positive.
(My original review follows, for your reference).
This video begins with a short infomercial for skin creams and ends with a really long one.  In between are a few facial exercises that take about 10-15 minutes and have a very amateur quality to them.  If I want to sculpt my face, I'll have to come up with another $20.00 -- no thanks! The best way to insure that a customer comes back is not to rip her off in the first place.

If I had read all the reviews, I would have realized that several were submitted twice under different names, and that at least two reviewers warned me.  I'm giving it a two star rating, because the exercises as such are not bad (although nothing new).  If they turn out to work, I'll write a second review and acknowledge that -- and I'll use different words!",1093824000,10,1260,4.396551724137931
1348747,5,B00004SZK6,"I would give this video 100 stars if I could. I absolutely love the Advanced Face Aerobics video. I am very happy with the results... pumped up my cheekbones, totally lifted my jawline and even made my lips fuller. The Advanced exercises are challenging, just like any good workout should be. But, the video is easy to follow along with and much easier to understand than reading a book. For those who really want to fight the aging process, Face Aerobics will provide amazing results with very little effort.",1081123200,8,509,4.730337078651686
1348748,5,B00004SZK6,"I have been doing Face Aerobics for 2 years and it is a part of my daily routine. I can't begin to tell you the incredible difference it's made in my life. I feel terrific... even when I look in the mirror. My face is tight and tone. I do the eye and cheek exercises every other day since those areas are the first to show aging. I get comments all the time on how great I look. In fact, most people guess my age to be 10-15 years younger than I am. (I'm age 61) Many friends think I've had a facelift, but I keep telling them it's all Face Aerobics.",1081123200,13,550,3.919642857142857
1348749,5,B00004SZK6,"Wow! I have the 1st Face Aerobics video which really toned up my face. However, with the Advanced version,you can look forward to fixing problem areas with minimal effort. My double chin is gone, though it took a two weeks to disappear. My drooping upper eyelids looked better in just 4-5 days. I wish I found this video 10 years ago.",1075420800,15,334,4.491803278688525

7922149,5,B00004SZK6,"I met Judith years ago at a seminar and bought the video and face products- put them away for several years. Off and on I have been doing the exercises as I remember them. I just put in the VHS tonight and did the entire routine. I completely forgot what I discovered- that there was an option to looking tired .I don't mind the ""poor quality"" of the video one bit, I think that the music is appropriate and soothing and not something that one would tire off. Yes, it's Judith doing the exercises, demonstrating and speaking to us - it's not a paid spokesperson. frankly I am disgusted by the flashy celebrity crazed insincere gunk thrown our way everyday- everything is so slick and overproduced- who cares? Content is and always will be king. Has anyone priced eye cream in a dept store lately, or asked their ""doctor"" ( dermatologist) about treatments -botox injections, etc? Now that's wholesale robbery - AND you do have to keep on buying- forever. Ka-ching Ka-ching Judith could charge triple or quadruple what she does for these videos, and the same for her skin care system, I would say that something with this track record and potential for healing and wellness is PRICELESS. It's YOUR FACE we are talking about.  Squabble not- just get the system, do the exercises and write a positive review so that the good word is spread. Lastly two things : One is that the ""infomercial"" on her face creams comes at the end of the video so you don't have to watch them more than once. If you watch it once and really listen you will learn that many DIY over the counter abrasion creams actually damage the skin- permanently. Once I learned this I was never again to SCRUB my face-ever.  Secondly, I think it was Judith who pointed out in her seminar that much of our facial woes are caused by poor habits- one being sleeping on your face. I taught myself ""dead mans pose "" and stick with it- I do not ever sleep on the side of my face . I would like to see more products and seminars from this intelligent and maverick person .",1172966400,5,2026,4.45822102425876
7922150,1,B00004SZK6,"After reading the glowing reviews, I bought this item and tried it.  Not only did it not work, it seems I have even more wrinkles after making all the goofy faces required to do the face aerobics.  Definitely do not recommend it..save your money.",1158105600,3,246,4.568181818181818
7922151,4,B00004SZK6,"Probably the most cheesy and DIY video that I have ever seen - but by golly - it really does work!

I was somewhat sekptical after reading some of the other reviews. Aplogies to the writers of those reviews - but the sounded a bit sugar coated and I suspected that they might have been written by relatives of Judith Oliver.

But this does actually work.  It won't return your skin to youthfull elasticity - nothing can do that - but toning the muscles fills out the wrinkles beautifully and it does change the shape of your face a little.  It's kind of like botox but with the added advantgage that you can still move the muscles (botox just freezes them) so you still have your full range of facial expressions.

So I can thoroughy recommend Ms. Oliver to everyone - and it is - how they say 'competitively priced' so you don't have a lot to loose.",1127088000,20,850,4.3544303797468356
7922152,5,B00004SZK6,"I first discovered this video six years ago.  I followed the exercises avidly for several years and completely re-shaped my face (I felt motivated because I saw results after a month).  Although I did not tell anyone I was doing these exercises, people would mistake me for being in my 30's--however, I was 48 at the time--and it always amazed people when I would tell them my age.  At 50, I still looked in my late 30's, and no one could believe I was 50!  It was like having a facelift, only more natural.  I got lazy and quit doing the exercises, and I noticed, over time, people no longer said I looked 35--and I began to notice my results fading--jaw started sagging, eyes started drooping, and I started to look my age--just like when you get out of shape in your body.  So, recently, I decided to re-purchase the videos (I had misplaced them in a move) and committed to doing the exercises avidly.  I am now 54 years old, but I am already seeing results again--most notably, my eyes have ""opened up"" and my face is firming up.  I don't expect to look 35 now--since other factors of age are at play--however, my goal is to look in my 40's--and I believe that is achievable with this amazing program.  As a bonus, the exercises are relaxing--and I look forward to doing them each evening.  I have purchased other exercise videos that just demonstrate the exercise, then you have to pause the video and complete the exercises yourself.  With this video, you get to relax and just follow along.  It's great.  One thing I would love to see however--I would like to see what Judith Olivia looks like now--ten years after making this video!  :)",1098489600,28,1644,4.510135135135135
