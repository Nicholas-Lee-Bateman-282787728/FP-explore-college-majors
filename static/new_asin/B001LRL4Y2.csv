3690869,1,B001LRL4Y2,"""Room 222"" was a wonderful show, and wonderful that Shout Factory saw fit to get the first season released on DVD.  That DVD release was today, March 24, 2009, and so I bought it.  There's only one way to say it:  the prints are HORRIBLE!  They are so bad that I'd like to ask Shout Factory, ""Was this a joke? Why did you bother releasing it at all???""

The first episode on the set is by far the worst of the bunch.  It's so fuzzy, color so washed out, that I had to squint at times to see what was on my TV set.  The second and subsequent episodes were a very slight improvement.

This was a landmark show and looking back forty years later it is very nostalgic to see where we were way back then.  It was wonderful to see Lloyd Haines, Karen Valentine, Michael Constantine, Denise Nichols and all the kids in the cast.  But the pleasure is short-lived and marred by the terrible quality of the prints.  Since this series was shot on film and not videotape, surely the negatives must exist somewhere and if so they needed to be restored.  Even if the color cannot be restored surely we could have better prints.

If you're ready to press the Buy button and spend nearly thirty dollars, think again on throwing away a nice chunk of change.  Because I can guarantee your mouth will drop open when you see how awful the quality of each episode is.

Shout Factory is so well known for its high standards in quality that I would really like to know what went wrong here.  And I hope they will provide us with some answers because you can bet customers will think twice about buying any Shout Factory release in the future.  I know I will.",1237852800,13,1635,4.308196721311475
3690870,3,B001LRL4Y2,"Its great that the show is out but why are some shows not taken care of> the prints released on this set are horrible. Washed out scratches dust specs, it looks like your watching a bad tv station copies. What shame however the stories helped keep my attention on the show rather than how it looked, still great drama for a half hour comedy drama. I can't believe there aren't reel negatvies to warrant a half decent transfer. As I once said we are at the mercy of the dvd gods either buy this or nothing. SO I bought it, [...]",1237852800,8,527,4.227722772277228
3690871,3,B001LRL4Y2,"While it's great to see ROOM 222 back in circulation, buyers beware that, perhaps owing to the fact that the show was never in syndication, the video negatives have deteriorated significantly with time.  The audio and video will actually remind you of what it was like to watch TV before the cable era.  The mono soundtrack is badly warped (especially noticeable in the underscoring, which wobbles) and the colors on the video are so washed out that, in some cases, it's hard to discern characters' ethnicity (and ROOM 222, you'll remember, is all about ethnicity).

That being said, it is still a pleasure to reconnect with a show that is so much a product of its idealistic time.  Viewed in present day, there is a poignancy in the unabashed earnestness of the writing and performing, and it's impossible to watch Karen Valentine being slammed in the face by those bus doors and not be transported back to a time when cute really meant CUTE on television.  Given that Shout Factory's other releases are all in pristine shape, we can only assume that the original master tapes of ROOM 222 were beyond restoration.  Such a pity, as the show deserves a better presentation.",1235692800,11,1172,4.7772277227722775
3690872,5,B001LRL4Y2,"""Room 222"" was a well-written, well-acted, well-made comedy drama in the late 60s-early 70s that broke new ground on a number of fronts.

The show was one of the first successful dramas to focus on high school life, and it couldn't have come at a more important time - when race relations, the hippie movement, Vietnam, and women's rights all changed the country's social fabric. Also explored were the usual teenage angst issues - boys, girls, maturity, etc.

The show was also noteworthy in that its lead character was a black man, Lloyd Haynes, portraying Pete Dixon, a history teacher at the high school. Bill Cosby had just broken new ground as Scotty on I-Spy (and won three Emmy Awards as Lead Dramatic Actor in the process), but even the idea of having a black actor as a lead in any kind of series was considered radical and risky. Haynes' Pete Dixon was steady, sensible, and gave great advice to his students.

The show was also bolstered by an outstanding supporting cast, including Denise Nicholas as Dixon's fellow teacher and girlfriend, Liz McIntyre, Michael Constantine as Dixon's friend and school principal, Seymour Kaufman, and rookie teacher Alice Johnson, played by Karen Valentine.

The show may seem dated now, but many truths, issues, and lessons still resonate, and it is more than just a curio piece. It is great news that class is once again in session in Room 222.",1231977600,7,1393,4.815899581589958
3690873,5,B001LRL4Y2,"Glad this is coming to DVD. It was very well written and the cast had a wonderful chemistry. SHOUT Factory has brought back a lot of gems of classic television; this is one of them. I hope that ""Dobie"" is on their radar. It also deserves a release!",1229212800,6,248,4.1875
3690874,5,B001LRL4Y2,"File this under the category, ""good things come to those who wait,"" and brother, has it been a long, long wait for this Classic TV gem to be rediscovered and released on DVD. Now, thanks to Shout! Factory, the complete first season of the iconic comedy-drama, Room 222, is being released for the first-time ever in a four-disc DVD boxed set.

The series, which premiered on ABC in 1969, explored life at integrated Walt Whitman High School in Los Angeles, as seen through the eyes of Pete Dixon, a black American history instructor whose classes are held in Room 222. It's amazing to look back and realize that integration was considered fairly ""new"" in 1969!

(The basic plot was similar to the popular 1967 film, To Sir, With Love, which starred the brilliant Sidney Poitier. In the movie, Poitier portrayed an idealistic teacher-trainee dealing with rambunctious white high school students from the slums of London's East End.)

Room 222 was a half-hour comedy-drama that aired on ABC from 1969-1974. While seldom seen in syndication today, the show broke new ground that would later be developed by the major sitcom factories of the 1970's.

Mixing dramatic elements with traditional TV comedy, Room 222 also predated the ""dramedy"" form by almost two decades! (Note: Director James L. Brooks worked on the series and went on to fame for his efforts in everything from the Mary Tyler Moore Show to the Simpons, as well as countless movies.)

The plots of Room 222 centered around dedicated and student-friendly teacher Dixon (played by Lloyd Haynes) whose mild-mannered style was admired and respected by students. He used American history class as a spring-board to teach real-life lessons in understanding and tolerance.

The series also depended on an ensemble cast of students and other school employees. The optimistic idealism of Pete, his compassionate girlfriend and school guidance counselor Liz McIntyre (played by Denise Nicholas), and student-teacher and later English teacher Alice Johnson (played by Karen Valentine) was balanced by the experienced, slightly jaded principal, Seymour Kaufman (played by Michael Constantine). Among the students were shy Helen Loomis (played by Judy Strangis), Bernie with the wild hair (played by David Jolliffe), militant Jason Allen (played by Heshimu Cumbuka) and genius Richie Lane, (played by Howard Rice.)

These high school employees and a handful of others debated among themselves how to best handle the academic and personal challenges of their students. Each episode also explored serious cultural issues of the day in a realistic way and in a realistic setting, predating later ""relevant"" comedies known for using comedy to do just that.

During its five seasons on the air, the series dealt with racism, sexism, homophobia, war, dropping out of school, shoplifting, drug use among both teachers and students, illiteracy, cops in school, guns in school, veterans' issues, teenage pregnancy and death. In one controversial episode, a young male student contracts venereal disease and an elderly female teacher loses her job because she gave him advice to deal with the problem.

The series garnered a number of community and educational awards for its positive portrayal of important social issues seldom discussed on TV at the time, and won an Emmy for Outstanding New Series in 1969.

The episodes from the first season included a laugh track. However, by the second season the laugh track was gone, emphasizing that the show was now primarily a drama, rather than a comedy.

The series was broadcast on Friday evenings at 9 p.m., following both The Brady Bunch and The Partridge Family, but preceding Love, American Style. Room 222's initial episodes garnered weak ratings and ABC was poised to cancel the program after its first season. But because of the awards the show earned, ABC relented and renewed the series.

The effervescent Valentine became a fan-favorite and a break-out star worldwide. She was frequently depicted in all of the teen magazines of the day.

Include in this four-disc boxed set are all 26 First Season episodes: Richie's Story; Naked Came We into the World; Funny Boy; The Coat; The Flu; First We'll Eat - Then We'll Strike; Teacher's Dropping Out; Out Teacher is Obsolete; Triple Date; Fathers and Sons; Alice in Blunderland; Clothes Make the Boy; Seventeen Going on Twenty-Eight; The Exchange Teacher; El Genio; Arizona State Loves You; Operation Sandpile; Play it Loose; Goodbye, Mr. Hip; One Upon a Time there was Air You Couldn't See; The Whole World Can Hear You; Ralph; I Love You Charlie, I Love You Abbie; The New Boy; Funny Money; and Just Between Friends.

The series' unforgettable theme song was composed by famed film composer Jerry Goldsmith, and written in a 7/4 time signature, which was unusual for the genre.

Thanks to Shout! Factory for this release. Let's hope they keep 'em coming!",1229126400,70,4896,5.125470514429109

Karen Valentine is quirky; I'd transfer out of her class in a heartbeat, not wanting to deal with her perkiness and lack of perspicacity, but that was her character and she did a fair job.

Now I know that this show was one of the first, if not the first, to encourage young people to think things out for themselves, with the supervision of the adult element of course, to question for once the rules that the elders set before them. It was a time when people had grown tired of the status quo and wanted something different. Youngsters were finally asking ""Why""? Why is your way right and mine wrong? The issues of the day were brought out to the light and this wasn't a ""leave It To Beaver"" moment. Times were changing and what better way to bring it out into the open than on television. Room 222 brought the classroom home and the teachers had to give more answers than, ""that's the way it is"". And the  students were listening.",1385942400,2,821,4.366013071895424
3690888,5,B001LRL4Y2,I was so excited to hear the theme song from this show. It was one of my favorites from the 1970s.

3690889,5,B001LRL4Y2,the ideas behind the writing for this show are timeless and still modern really.  it may seem dated as it is from 1969 but i think a modern viewer who can not be fooled by that will see the timelessness of it.  there are lessons in the end.  it is a show about kids in school.  i recommend the other season on DVD too.,1370476800,,318,3.921875

Like it a lot
Episodes are taut - as many from that era are
Always amazes me how 'complete' the writers managed to make each ep

Also like that these shows had Asians even before it was politically right to do so

3690891,3,B001LRL4Y2,"This was a great tv series that hardly ever gets shown anymore. I remember watching this as a child, and again when it was rerun in the early eighties.

Some of the episodes are little dated, but most of the storylines are timeless. The four main players in the series were all suburb in their roles. It's too bad this show is largely forgotten and so underrated.

As for the product itself, I was very disappointed. The transfer is horrid. Faded and washed out colors, audio hiss, and it appears that nothing was done to improve these episodes. There was little to no attempt to fix them up. I realize that there are some limitations with older film or video, but I've seen old video tapes of these shows in better condition.

There is no way I will order season 2 now. I think the series itself, deserves five stars, but due to the quality I could only give three (and that is being extremely generous). It's a shame that it wasn't restored properly.",1346457600,2,952,4.459770114942529
3690892,3,B001LRL4Y2,"That's about what the quality of the print is, but the show shines through anyway.  I wasn't much of a fan back then since I was a child and way to young to appreciate this show, but I did remember the infectiously cute theme song almost note-for-note since watching it on TV back then.

It just made me sad that I'm finally grown-up enough to appreciate how brilliant this show was, but I have to watch it like through a rainy day window, not on a sharp and crisp 13"" Hitachi portable color TV like I had access to back then.

And let's not just heap blame on Shout for this.  Perhaps the original prints weren't stored properly, or they were lost or thrown away.  Perhaps this really is a Beta-max video tape transferred to disk.  Who knows.  Shout has brought some great stuff from the sixties and seventies back, and let's be glad they did at all.",1336694400,,851,4.348101265822785

I happen to find this set one day on amazon at a very cheap prize (of course ignoring all the negative feedback about the quality of the prints) I decided to buy it and after watching it I'm really happy I did. Is such a wonderful show, I loved it from the very first episode. I got so into them that I even didn't mind the picture quality. Too bad Shout! Factory decided not to release anymore sets which means that we would not be able to enjoy more seasons of this wonderful series I guess thanks in part to those that campaign to have these sets stop.

3690895,5,B001LRL4Y2,"Room 222(1969-1974) was a gem from TV's past created by James L. Brooks. The show is an homage to the Sidney Poitier film To Sir With Love(1967), but it has its own style. The late Lloyd Haynes played Mr. Dixon, a history teacher who tries to guide his students and teach them about tolerance. Haynes played an officer on a Star Trek episode. Denise Nicolas played Liz McIntyre, a school guidance counselor and Mr. Dixon's love interest. Michael Constantine played Seymour, the kind, but firm principal. Cute, sensual Karen Valentine played student/teacher Alice Johnson. Valentine played Gidget in Gidget Grows Up(1969). The first three or four episodes of Room 222 had a laugh track, but it was removed for good to focus on the drama, writing and acting. Room 222 was a product of its time. The show discussed topical themes of the time such as civil rights, feminism, the Vietman War, abortion, drug use, etc. The late, great Jerry Goldsmith composed the smooth, jazzy theme music for Room 222. Shout Factory looked for the best master tapes that they could for each episode. The audio/video quality is good in some episodes and not so good in others. The pilot episode has minor negative damage and lines running up the screen. Oh, well, beggars can't be chosers. I saw Gilligan's Island, Star Trek, Hazel, The Addams Family, Mission: Impossible, Gidget and The Monkees in syndication growing up. Too bad Room 222 was rarely ever shown in syndication. The show hasn't lost its sense of fun and entertainment value decades down the road. Heshimu, Judy Strangis, Cindy Williams, Teri Garr and many others played students on the show. Room 222 was ""modern"" when it was made in the early 1970's. There's girls with plaid dresses, mini skirts, go go boots and plastic barettes in their hair. There's boys with afros, sideburns and bell bottoms. The late Lloyd Haynes was superb as Mister Dixon. He's tough, kind, and empathic. He has a moral compass and intelligence. Karen Valentine is very good as Alice. She gives an earnest performance as a student/teacher. Karen Valentine is very good looking, too. She has a cute face and chocolate brown hair that spills over her shoulders. Valentine was a good Gidget in the average TV movie Gidget Grows Up(1969). I hope Shout Factory releases every season of Room 222 on DVD and Blu Ray.",1323043200,3,2330,4.85678391959799
3690896,5,B001LRL4Y2,Room 222 was a great situation comedy for it's day and can be just as good for TODAY. I recommend this DVD set for anyone that wants to take a ride back to when television was good!,1317168000,,181,3.918918918918919
3690897,4,B001LRL4Y2,"I am very sorry to read that Shout Factory will not release any future DVD Box Sets of ""Room 222"" due to poor sales, most likely brought on by poor customer ratings and reviews. Most complaints said that the ""print quality"" of the episodes were less than pristine. Remember,  customers, ""Room 222"" was not in wide syndication after the end of its network run in 1974; thereby making it difficult to find perfect looking prints. Reviews should have focused on the quality and content of the series itself, which is often outstanding.
  The series, created by James L. Brooks (""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"") and produced by Gene Reynolds (""M*A*S*H*"") is, in some ways, a TV variation of 1967's ""To Sir, With Love."" Pete Dixon, superbly portrayed by Lloyd Haynes, is a popular history teacher at fictional Walt Whitman High School in Los Angeles. Dixon, comitted, level-headed, compassionate, and reasonably calm in a crisis, is very much in the mold of Sidney Poitier's character in ""To Sir, With Love.""
Room 222 is Pete's classroom, but the series is not confined there. Other characters include Denise Nicholas as guidance counselor Liz Mcintyre, who is also Pete's girlfriend, Michael Constantine as the harried but caring Principal Kaufman, and a perfectly perky Karen Valentine as student teacher Alice Johnson who, initially, is a bit too anxious and eager to succeed. The series also featured a sort of ""repretory company"" of students. Howard Rice as Richie, Heshimu as Jason, and David Jolliffe as Bernie are especially  outstanding in their frequently featured roles.
  ""Room 222"" was instantly groundbreaking for having, I believe, the first fully integrated ensemble cast in a TV Series. ""Room 222"" was also not easily categorized, and this led to some creative tension behind the scenes. Today, the series would quickly and correctly be called a drama. Back in 1969, however, nervous ABC network kept pushing for more broad classroom comedy. The creative team, writers, and cast, however, pushed for scripts with substance. Early episodes do feature a laugh-track,  albeit a very faint and almost unrecognizable one. The cast successfully fought to have the laugh-track removed, thereby allowing the well-written scripts (mostly involving the ""generation gap"" and some poignant episodes about lonely students trying to make friends and find their place in the world; in school and out) to play much more realistically. ABC still wanted to cancel the show after Season One, but quickly changed their mind when ""Room 222""  deservedly won the Emmy Award as ""Outstanding New Series""; as well as individual Emmy Awards for Constantine and Valentine. I also think Haynes and Nicholas were deserving of Emmy recognition as well. By Season 3, ""Room 222"" moved into its fondly-remembered Friday night time slot (alongside ""The Brady Bunch"", ""The Partridge Family"" and ""The Odd Couple"") where it remained until the end of Season 5 in January, 1974.
  Looked at 42 years later, ""Room 222"" holds up remarkably well. The series works because it was allowed to be what it always was; a drama. There are some comedy undertones, but, despite network protestations, the emphasis was on stories with substance told with sensitivity and restraint. The series also takes a positive view of teachers and students. The daily work may often be challenging, but the teachers sincerely care about their students; the quality of their education and the quality of their lives. And the students, with a few exceptions, are depicted as liking those teachers and their school.  The positive outlook may be derided in today's society and TV landscape , which seems to favor wisecracks and/or cynical and depressing viewpoints, but that is what makes ""Room 222"" so refreshing. It is instantly endearing, which is what makes it a true TV Classic. The entire series run of ""Room 222"" deserves to be released on DVD. Sadly, this is not likely to happen.",1312934400,3,3927,5.101246105919003

I have to say, I personally feel that Room 222 was one of the most significant TV series of its time. It was indeed underrated. It's a pleasure to watch it again.",1312761600,,486,4.282608695652174

This show was a joy to work on, primarily because of two wonderful and unique actors, Lloyd Haynes and Michael Constantine.  I greatly admired both of them because they didn't consider themselves above talking to the extras, which is pretty rare.  Both were excellent actors and, more importantly, human beings.  The scripts dealt with some serious as well as fun issues and, although the quality of the film is pretty bad, it's fun to revisit those days.  I was so pleased that Amazon.com carried this DVD.

3690900,5,B001LRL4Y2,"""Room 222"" appeared on ABC for five seasons from 1969 to 1974, and looked at life at a multiracial high school in Los Angeles.  The series starred history teacher Pete Dixon (Lloyd Haynes), guidance counselor Liz McIntyre (Denise Nicholas), principal Seymour Kaufman (Michael Constantine), and student teacher Alice Johnson (Karen Valentine).

The series appeared just a few years after the Civil Rights Movement, and was very valuable in that era in that it portrayed a black man as a respected authority figure.  The 26 episodes on this set, covering the 1969-70 season (the first year of the series), examined issues topical at the time such as drugs and dress codes, but also looked at issues in teenage life that are timeless.  This DVD set also contains 2009 interviews with Nicholas, Constantine, and the show's creators that look back on the series.

Some have complained about the sound and picture quality on this set, but I didn't mind that at all--I actually thought that the slightly bleached color and snowy picture in some spots made it seem all the more authentic, as if you were sitting down to watch a TV show 40 years ago.  I didn't agree with every position that the show took, but thought that ""Room 222"" was an outstanding high school drama that would likely be enjoyed by teenagers and adults alike.",1309564800,2,1322,4.8533333333333335

The characters are likeable, sincere, and very human: even the very even-tempered Pete Dixon occasionally get annoyed. This series was relevant to the racial integration that began in the 1960s-a phenomenen that has yet to be fully realized. But the ideals and ideas presented and even promoted in this show--tolerance, dialogue, mutual respect, and the value of education--are always relevant, and are nice to return to through watching ""Room 222"" again after all these years.",1301875200,,784,5.28

When I got this DVD set, I planned to watch just a couple of the episodes each week, but after the first one I couldn't resist and ended up watching them all over about 7 days. So much fun and so many memories. Picture quality is fine for me. In fact, I liked the picture being a bit dark and grainy with a few artifacts floating by every now and then. It reminded me I was watching a 40+ year old program that originally appeared on square box with no remote control and all of us huddled around with big grins on our faces. A long time ago, at a high school far far away, we got to peek in once a week as magic happened.

Hopefully Amazon will sell the rest of the seasons in the near future. Been searching for them, but only found Season 2, but the price is too high.",1301097600,,1112,4.0963302752293576
3690903,5,B001LRL4Y2,"I am THOROUGHLY happy to finally have Room 222 on DVD! I loved this show back in my childhood and never thought I'd see it again!

Just seeing Walt Whitman High School during the opening credits brought back memories I had long forgotten. The show addressed deep issues of the times such as racism, drugs, sexism, and teen pregnancy without losing its light-heartedness. The show's main characters, the idealistic yet cool History teacher Pete Dixon (Lloyd Haynes), the equally-as-hip guidance counselor Liz McIntyre (Denise Nicholas), the perky student-teacher Alice Johnson (Karen Valentine) and the often exasperated principal Seymour Kaufman (Michael Constantine) show as much concern for the students as they did for their education.

I have absolutely no issues with the video quality - in fact I don't even consider it an issue. The DVD's are watchable AND enjoyable. If you liked this show and are considering ordering this set, don't be put off by the negative reviews. Room 222 will take you back in time and hold your interest.

There were quite a few recognizable faces (Ed Begley, Jr., Bruno Kirby, Kurt Russell) as guest stars. The late Lloyd Haynes, Karen Valentine & Denise Nicholas were all great. And the plots, though semmingly dated today, were relevant,thought-provoking(!), and a bit poignant(!!) back in the day. Who'd of guessed that one day the prinicpal, Seymour Kaufman (Michael Constantine) would one day be the Windex-wielding father in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding""? And whatever happened to those guys who played Jason and Richie?

3690905,4,B001LRL4Y2,"Room 222 is a forgotten TV show of the late 60's, early 70's. It didn't have an afterlife in syndication, its stars for the most part didn't go on to ultra-illustrious careers, it isn't played on any of the nostalgia TV stations, but it was one of the first TV shows that dealt realistically with teenagers in high school and the problems shared with the faculty.

Created by James L. Brooks (The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Lou Grant, The Simpsons), Room 222 follows the teachers and students of a racially integrated high school, one of the first times in television history (but not the last, Boston Public is an example of show that is a direct descendent of Room 222). I'm one of the original audience of  Room 222 and I remember it more as a comedy, so I was a little surprised to see that it was a little more issues oriented, taking on subjects that at times seem remarkably relevant today. When the first season aired in 1969 you were aware that Room 222 was a ground breaking show that centered on lives of an integrated student body and faculty.

Pete Dixon (Lloyd Hanes) is the always hip history teacher in Room 222. He's open minded and progressive but pragmatic. He's open to the students and their problems and is a guide to the students allowing them to find the solutions to their problems without too many complications.

Liz McIntyre (Denise Nicholas), the school counselor, is Pete Dixon's girlfriend, confidant and accomplice in finding solutions to the students problems.

Alice Johnson (Karen Valentine), the perky ""it"" girl of the late 60's, early 70's who is Pete's student teacher and is full of the bubbly unfettered idealism of the 60's, who says the first thing that comes to mind and which may be the wrong thing to say.

Principal Seymour Kaufman (Michael Constantine) the outwardly curmudgeonly school principal with a hang dog expression who lets himself be talked into the idealistic plans of Pete and Liz on behalf of the students.

The show had a lot of young actors as the students that would go on to more high profile careers Cindy Williams, Rob Reiner, Bob Balaban, Teri Garr, Ed Begley Jr., and Bud Cort. As well as adult actors who either had already had careers on TV or would go on to bigger television success such as Bernie Kopell, Paul Winfield, Larry Linville, Ann Morgan Guilbert, William Schallert, as well as many character actors from the 60's who are instantly recognizable if their names aren't.

Bonus features: There is one bonus feature, a ten minute documentary ""40 Years On"" which has series creator James L. Brooks, writer Allan Burns, stars Michael Constantine and Denise Nicholas talking about the show. I wish there had been a few more bonus features. A commentary track on some of the episodes might have been cool, it would have given a little more insight into the episodes and the making of the show. Or even interviews with the actors who played the students, their perspective, and a little information on where they went after Room 222 would have been a very cool feature since the students were an integral part of this show.

Note on Disc 1: The set I received disc 1 looks like a second generation copy and is a little dark but the other discs looked as clear as the day they were broadcast (although in a few places there were scratches on the film), but they were minor distractions and didn't interfere with my enjoyment of the shows.

Room 222 may be only for those reliving their childhood but maybe a few people will discover a show that's still relevant and entertaining today, even if it is a bit of time capsule.",1288310400,,3590,4.657187993680885

3690907,5,B001LRL4Y2,"Keep in mind this review is written from the persective of someone not around when this show was on the air.  I had never even seen it before purchasing the dvd.  Lately, I've been buying old tv shows since I find it tough to get into current tv.  I read some good things about ROOM 222 & it seemed to represent a unique period (late 60's & early 70's) so I thought I'd give it a try.  I was very young in the 70's but I do remember a certain optimism present in shows of the era.

What a wonderful show!!  The fashions may be wonderfully dated but the content isn't!  Not merely a period piece but a program with relevancy today!  Yes it probably far more optimistic than shows in 2010 but I found that refreshing. The teachers are portrayed as having doubts about the system but still see the possibilities of their profession.  I feel good after watching each episode! This is an absolute classic & I can't believe it's so overlooked.  Lloyd Haynes is superb!

The video isn't great but I've gotten past it because of the quality of the stories.  This just demonstrates the neglect on the part of studios.  I remember seeing a promo for ROOM 222 in the 80's on some channel & I remember thinking the show must be really old because the picture is so faded.  It is acceptable though & some episodes aren't bad at all.  Going in prepared I haven't been bothered by the quality at all.

If you want a show that is uplifting without being preachy or sugar coated, give this show a try.  ROOM 222 is as enjoyable as any show I've watched!",1287187200,4,1536,4.314685314685315

I highly recommend this series to anyone, because it is not korny like many of the Sitcoms of that era, instead it introduces Drama into the Sitcom format, and shows many of the problems that both kids and teachers cope with.  Lloyd Haynes is brilliant as the lead actor in this series and he complemented by Denise Nicholas, Karen Valentine and Michael Constatine.  The series won an Emmy in its first season as the best new series, also Karen Valentine won an Emmy for best supporting Actress in a Comedy.",1283990400,2,658,4.495798319327731
3690910,5,B001LRL4Y2,"Room 222 was about a Los Angeles High School in 1969. The show was one of the first on TV to deal with race, drugs, and protest--all the concerns a young person would have at the end of the 1960s. It may have been the foot that got All In The Family into the door.

Mr. Dixon, a (then) black (now)African American History Teacher. The centerpiece of the show, he related history to what was going on with the kids in his class room--this was when you were either a dove or a hawk, a draftee or a draft dodger: the political and social ideas were very real to all these kids.

Edgey in those days, this now seems wonderfully nieve in the cyber post 9/11 world we and our kids have to navigate. But the humor is great, and subtle, and the charactors are real.

If we had more of this kind of nieve now, the world would be a much nicer place.",1266883200,3,839,4.103658536585366
3690911,5,B001LRL4Y2,"Can anyone out there name a more recent television series dedicated to the efforts of teachers? No? I didn't think so.

Room 222 did for the teaching profession on television what Jack Webb did for the police profession on TV. It just brought the whole thing down to earth and made the people more true to life. I saw Room 222 growing up in Northeastern Pennsylvania, and it was part of that smash ABC Friday night line-up: The Brady Bunch at 8 p.m., The Partridge Family at 8:30, Room 222 at 9 p.m., The Odd Couple at 9:30, and Love American Style at 10 o'clock. Looking back upon it all, I probably understood Room 222 the least. The show was subtle with much more mature conversation than the shows which preceded it on Friday night, and more serious than the two which were to follow. The laugh track was subdued; It didn't hit one over the head. I suppose the ABC execs who programmed the show meant it for a high school audience and their parents, and both had to listen attentively and be thoughtful at that. In a world that seemed to be unraveling in the late '60s and early '70s with Vietnam, the Youth Movement, Watergate, what have you, Room 222 now seems like an island of stability compared with more recent times of what is happening on junior high and high school campuses.

I suppose that Lloyd Haynes was an ABC counterpart to NBC's Chet Kincaid on The Bill Cosby Show. Here was a thoughtful, African-American man who could teach and hold the students' interest while putting history into perspective and addressing current issues. Perhaps we have come so far as to not make color an issue as it may have been when these shows first aired in the late '60s/early '70s, but the issue today seems to be one of quality teaching and addressing the needs of the students rather than of race, and this is where Room 222 scores an ""A."" And, to present this issue on television in a thoughtful and provocative manner moves the score to an ""A+."" Shows like this just do not happen on television anymore, and the only question left to be asked is ""Why?"" The issues and concerns of students during those high school years seem to remain the same, proving that young people are still young people. The more things change, the more things seem to stay the same. Room 222 is as relevant now with issues of students as it was 40 years ago.

Lloyd Haynes is great as Mr Dixon. He remains a calm and level-headed teacher, for that is in his personal character. Denise Nicholas is a bit prissy at times, but she plays a fine supporting role of high school counselor and Mr Dixon's ""shadow"" girlfriend. Karen Valentine plays a bubbly and talkative, if not also a bit naive, student teacher named Alice Johnson. She seems the perfect coed for the year 1968. Michael Constantine is the somewhat exasperated principal of Walt Whitman High School (whose facade is actually Los Angeles High School). This is actually very fine ensemble playing, and the supporting actors of various teaching types occasionally penetrate to several core issues of teacher frustration. Overworked and underpaid? You bet!

All in all, Room 222 is worth one's investment. It takes one back to when there was still something called a bit of discipline in the high school classroom. Young and old may still learn from its provocative and thoughtful story-line and comment today.",1263686400,7,3347,4.648648648648648
3690912,5,B001LRL4Y2,"I loved this show when it came on TV at the end of the 60s. I looked forward to it every Friday night, when it debuted in the fall of '69. I was still in elementary school then. But I really enjoyed this program, about a cool group of high school kids. Walt Whitman High, was a huge HS in Los Angeles. It was a multicultural school, where students of all races attended.

The teachers at Walt Whitman High, were also of various races. Mr. Kauffman, was the dedicated, beleaguered Principal. Pete Dickson, a black man, was the school's American history teacher. He was a caring, patient teacher, who really succeeded in engaging his student's interest in history. Pete Dickson was also someone that the students could come to for advice and assistance, with their personal issues. Ms. McIntyre, the attractive assistant Principal, was also romantically involved with Pete Dickson.

Then there was Alice Johnson, who worked with Pete Dickson as a student teacher. Alice was the often annoying, but well-meaning foil for Pete's self-assured personality. Their classroom featured an interesting menagerie of students. There was Jason, the tough-but-sensitive black kid, with a big 'fro and shades. His friend Ritchie, was the class brain. Helen was the shy, vulnerable girl. Bernie, was the white hippie-type kid, with the red-headed afro hairdo. These students were like real teens, negotiating everyday life in the tumultuous late 60s/early 70s.

The best thing about Room 222, was that it had a fresh, contemporary take on American teens, in an urban high school setting. The values of the show centered on tolerance and diversity, amongst both the students, and the teaching staff. Because of this factor, the series was on the cutting-edge, regarding racial progress in society. The generation gap between the students and their teachers, was also easily bridged due to the open-minded teaching staff.

Yet another thing about this show that was unique, was that it was a drama, yet it also had a laugh-track. It was one of the first shows, that could be categorized as a dramedy. And there was plenty of gentle humor within the show, along with all of the teen angst. Room 222 is on DVD, and can be enjoyed by future generations to come.",1261958400,2,2239,4.931034482758621

However, I had an almost OCD fascination with this show as a teenager.  The first disk in this set is kind of rough but it does get better after about the 5th episode.  The audio is also not so great in some parts, the volume levels go up and down in the middle of a show sometimes.

However, once you pass the first disk and really get back into the content and storylines for the show, you forget about the quality and just watch and enjoy the show.

Room 222 at the time was a ground breaking series.  Have only seen the first disk, but I am already looking forward to the rest of the seasons to appear on DVD.  Seeing them with the little scratches and blips are probably closer to seeing the shows as they appeared originally on TV.

As for the picture quality not being perfect by today's standards - so what, quality is in the eye of the beholder & this is a quality program.",1249948800,3,612,4.066115702479339
3690917,4,B001LRL4Y2,"1969 was a historic year.  A few weeks before Room 222 premiered, Neil Armstrong had become the first man on the moon, taking that `one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind'.  One of the early creations by James L. Brooks (The Mary Tyler Moore Show/Taxi), the series' title comes from the classroom number of Walt Whitman High School, American history teacher, Pete Dixon, played by Lloyd Haynes.  In this role, Haynes projects class and dignity, the perhaps the closest thing to Sidney Poiter to appear on the small screen up to that time.  Dixon comes across as a real person, not a cardboard cutout of perfection.  He has a temper, and a tendency to get carried away.  Michael Constantine, who had previous played many ethnic roles with accents, is great as Principal Seymour Kaufman, the often beleaguered administrator.  Denise Nicholas, as Liz McIntyre, is the kind of guidance counselor everyone wishes they had.  Karen Valentine is perky student teacher Alice Johnson, finding her way in the public school system.  The faculty is complimented by a core student body with some unique members like Richie Lane (Howard Rice), Jason Allen (Heshimu), Helen Loomis (Judy Stangis), and Bernie (David Jolliffe), who we get to know better over time.

Things have changed so much since Room 222 first aired, when segregation was part of the educational experience for many in the country.  Today, some forty years later, when America has recently elected its first President of African-American ancestry, the magnitude of the change is truly monumental.  How significant this change is, may depend on your ethnic background.  Series creator James L. Brooks refers to racial integration, as `the elephant in the room'.  While the series seldom directly address race, being what it was, featuring African-American costars interacting with an integrated student body, Room 222 was making a statement in 1969, that African-Americans, and representing their point of view was important.

While being socially significance was part of the package, Room 222 was before anything else, a drama about high school life.  There again, many things regarding the high school experience (violence and school shootings), have changed radically since 1969, but there are still certain elements that are still relevant today.  The transition from adolescence to adulthood remains a challenge for both students and parents.  The series examines a variety of issues and situations, some serious, others flighty, some school related, and others involving the personal lives of the characters.  Often idealistic beliefs are put to the test in the `real' world.  In an ensemble format, character development proceeds rather slowly, as the writers feel their way around, focusing on different characters, and featuring different settings.

The tone of the stories is all over the map from a little goofy and light, to very serious.  The quality of the writing varies as well, more often in the good to average range, rather than great.  Some notable episodes include, `Ralph' where one of the students in Dixon's night class has an overbearing interest in history, that starts to interfere in Pete's personal life.  `Seventeen Going on Twenty-Eight' is one of the more provocative episodes, where Pete becomes involved in an awkward situation involving a female student.  Liz McIntyre experiences a similar situation in `The Coat', when Whitman student Jason Allen, gives her a stolen coat as a token of appreciation.  In `El Genio', Alice works hard to get a Hispanic student into college, only to find that he has other plans.  Jason Allen is a unique and intriguing character that the writers apparently were trying to figure out.  Sometimes silent and intimidating, other times a rebellious outsider, and still other times one of the social leaders.  He was hip, cool, and enigmatic.  In `Triple Date' Jason enlists the help of classmate Richie Lane, in order to by-pass the father of a girl, who has objections to his daughter going out with Mr. Allen.  The relationship between Principal Kaufman, and Pete is explored in `Just Between Friends', the finale of the first season.

Some TV programs from this time period look fantastic, unfortunately Room 222 is not one of them.  Image quality is definitely an issue.  Almost all of the episodes have washed out or inaccurate colors, often there is a noticeable lack of sharpness, and the presence of dirt on some of the prints.  This is a huge disappointment, but hopefully subsequent seasons will be better.  The featurette, `Forty Years On' is a look back at the series, and features Michael Constantine, Denise Nicholas (who both look great), James Brooks, and Allan Burns.  Of course a longer more in depth feature would have been fabulous, but this is better than nothing.  Lloyd Haynes passed away in 1986, but it would have been great to hear from Karen Valentine, and some of those who played the students.  What did happen to Heshimu, who apparently did not pursue acting after Room 222?

The series gets off to a good start here, taking one small step in the process of the integration of television.  If future seasons are issued, hopefully image quality will be improved, and extras like commentaries will be included.",1247961600,2,5268,5.100350058343057

About half of the Episodes are very poor quality - looks like a bad bootleg.

What strikes me first about the show is how innocent it was.  At the time, we all thought ""222"" was cutting edge and not a little controversial.  To watch it today is to experience an era of idealism among teens which is sometimes hokey, but always endearing.  The big winners here, though, are the teachers and staff of Walt Whitman High School.  Michael Constantine's principal, Seymour Kaufman, is dryer and funnier than I had remembered.  Lloyd Haynes' Pete Dixon is just as cool as I remembered him.  I wanted to be Pete Dixon when I grew up, and now I see why; the guy is everything 1970's hip.  Denise Nicholson is equally with-it, and more beautiful than I realized in 1969, at which time my first crush was Karen Valentine.  It's easy to see why, though.  Beneath the doofiness of her Alice Johnson is comic timing that was destined for TV greatness, and there's no mistaking her hidden grown-up attractiveness.

Honestly, I enjoyed every single episode of this 4-disc set--something I can't say for most TV series I've purchased on DVD (which is many).  I can't wait for Seasons 2, 3 and beyond to be released.  I'll be first on line to purchase again.",1239494400,11,1810,4.60625
3690928,5,B001LRL4Y2,"This show is better than I even remembered. I wish it did have better picture quality, but I still give 5 stars! The stories and cast are superb. It really shows what things were like back in the late 60's and early 70's and was a cutting edge show. I truly do not understand why this show has not been popular in reruns. I want to thank Shout for bringing this show to us. It is hard for me to understand the reason 20th Century Fox would not release the show themselves. But I'm glad, for Shout does a much better job of releasing shows! Now if we can get Marcus Welby, M.D. and the last two seasons of ""The Bob Newhart Show.""",1239062400,3,628,4.1138211382113825

3690930,5,B001LRL4Y2,"People have complained about the bad prints used to produce this DVD box set of the complete first season of ""Room 222.""  I was watching the DVD set and the prints used are not bad as some people are making it sound they are.

The prints are about 40 years old.  (Has it been that long?)

This show seems to have been almost forgotten.  I'm glad to see that there are others besides me that fondly remember this show.

I'm glad that there are prints of the show that are still in existence.  The show ended on ABC in 1974.  It has been years since the show has even been run in syndication on TV.  Because of this fact, the possibilities of this show coming out in a DVD season box set appeared not too good.

However, finally a company has put this show out on DVD.  I was afraid that it was going to end up being one of those TV shows that was a product of the 1960's that reflected teh times and the social and political issues of the times taht would end up being forgotten, considered dated and no longer relevant to today's DVD buyers market.

I'm glad that some company decided to put the DVD set out.  Yes, I definitely would have liked to see better prints used, if in fact better prints do still actually exist somewhere.

Like I said, the prints used to produce the DVD season box set of ""Room 222"" are not as bad as some people are making it out to be.  For the average person who buys and watches DVD's, I'm sure that they will have no problems with the prints.

I'm telling you this,because I don't want people who like ""Room 222"" and were waiting for itto come out to get turned off by the negative comments with regards to the quality of the prints used in the production of this DVD set.  It would be ashame if some people read the negative comments about the prints used and decided to pass up their chance to get the DVD set.",1238803200,5,1844,4.193181818181818
3690931,5,B001LRL4Y2,"Ditto to the previous reviewer's remarks.  Shout brought this excellent series back into the daylight to be rediscovered.  The quality is definitely watchable, so if you are a fan to any degree don't be detracted from adding this classic to your collection.
I was surprised to learn that Los Angeles High, which served as Walt Whitman High in the series, suffered earthquake damage in the 1970's and subsequent fire.  I read that some reconstructing took place on the school. I went to Google maps to get a street view of the current Los Angeles High and realized the entire original structure must have been demolished as the current school has no resemblance to the original.  Wondering if anyone has the story on this...did they have to take out that beautiful, old structure completely?  I'm a native Californian and have no problem asserting that we have little appreciation or respect for any historic structures here.  Really a shame.  All the more reason to preserve and release classics like Room 222, so we can see what we once had.",1238544000,2,1042,4.853107344632768
3690932,4,B001LRL4Y2,"Okay, if you have ordered this series you know that you are getting one of the best half hour shows there was from the late 60's and early 70's.  There can be no argument about the quality of the scripts, the acting, and the fact that while a few things may seem dated, it's amazing how relevent many of these same themes are today. And while today's kids might laugh at the hair styles and clothing of the students then, they would probably be surprised how little other things have changed in many other aspects.

I particularly enjoyed seeing some future stars in these episodes.  I haven't watched them all yet, but it was fun watching a very young Bob Balaban in one episode, and Bud Cort playing a character that will instantly remind you of his role in Harold and Maude.

But there is no doubt that it was the regular cast of the late Lloyd Haynes, Karen Valentine, Michael Constantine, and Denise Nicholas that made this series much of what it was.  I had forgotten how good they were, especially Haynes whose contribution was often overlooked.  (Haynes was nominated for an Emmy but unlike Constantine and Valentine never won. Nicholas was not nominated for an Emmy but did manage a Golden Globe nomination)

As for the picture and sound quality, I think you have to lay much of the blame for that on Fox and not Shout who didn't have much to work with and did the best that they could with not much help from Fox (The series was produced by 20th Century Fox for ABC so I am surmising they actually control the prints) beyond securing the rights to get it out at all.  So place the blame where it belongs and thanks to Shout for even managing to get this released.

Frankly, if these are the best prints available, it tells you what little regard some of these big studios have for some of these classics.  I'm always reading how we should donate money for film restoration, yet some of these television series that are like hundreds of mini time capsules from our past are being left to deteriorate simply because studios can't make a profit off of them.

Maybe it's high time some of these organizations and studios that talk so much about film preservation begin realizing that much of our television history are shows such as Room 222 that are as much a commentary on the times in which they were produced just as much as any theatrical film.

It should be a crime that they would let this series simply waste in some vault the way that they have.  And then they (the big studios) whine and cry about piracy, when they seem to have little regard for much of the material that is probably rotting away somewhere never to see the light of day again, material which will eventually lost forever as much of it already seems to be.

So yes, I would recommend this purchase a lot faster than those series with good but syndicated prints, changed music, and overpriced half seasons, put out by big studios (you know of whom I speak) who really could care less about anything other than squeezing a few extra pennies out of consumers.  And Shout is to be congratulated for even getting this to market, not condemned for their efforts.",1238544000,5,3139,4.511463844797178
3690933,3,B001LRL4Y2,"I was very disappointed in this release. I have only watched the first episode. The picture and sound quality is just really bad!! It is watchable, but the colors seem really faded and dull. I almost wish they had digitally enhanced it, as they did with the Little House series.

I don't blame SHOUT, as they have brought us many quality products. I am assuming this is the best quality transfer they had to work with. I have preordered The Paper Chase (another SHOUT release) and I am hoping it is not plaqued with the same quality problems as Room 222.

It's a shame that a quality show like Room 222 had this kind of a release........",1238371200,3,637,4.435897435897436
3690934,4,B001LRL4Y2,"Ok, my review is going to be a mixture of sorts. First off, this was a favorite series of mine growing up. I was a mere five years old when it came on but it ran until I was nine so I have many fond memories of this series. James L. Brooks, the creator of the series, worked for years in television creating such memorable series as room 222, rhoda, mary tyler moore, taxi and lou grant. That said, this was a cutting edge series that we've never seen the likes of repeated, in part to the extraordinary casting. Lloyd Haines, Denise Nicholas, Michael Constantine, and a perky, Karen Valentine head the cast which is rounded out by regular students, Heshimu, Judy Strangis (electra woman and dyna girl), Howard Rice, and David Joliffee as the lovable red-headed, Bernie. This series, while a bit dated now, brought up relevant issues of the time. Issues that were covered included minority student issues, students living in the wrong boundary for attending one school, trouble making students, exciting foreign exchange teachers, and the topics because stronger over time. Student-Teacher infatuation was explored as well during season one.

Room 222 aired for five glorious years and it was always a top ten series during it's run. This is a series that many will want to own and I encourage you to beg, borrow, steal or buy this series. You will probably want to own it after you've watched all of the episodes. It's that good!

Now for the bad. The quality of the video isn't as good as I was expecting. The quality of the premiere episoded is the worst of all the episodes. The episodes do get better from this point forward but scratches on the print as well as faint horizontal lines are present in some of the videos. The worst quality episode, in my opinion, is the one titled El Genio. It is watchable and concerns a Mexican-American student that Alice takes a personal interest in because she sees the potential for him to go beyond high school to college. The video quality is poor and the episode is a bit shake in the beginning. I wish the company that released season one would have spent a little more time remastering the episodes and giving this series a worthy tribute. It was, and still is a great series that deserves to be enjoyed by future generations.

That said, please don't allow a bit of scratching and noise on the videos to prevent you from buying this powerful series. It was the only series of it's kind in 1969 and, in a way, is still very relevant today.",1238371200,,2488,4.586516853932585
3690935,2,B001LRL4Y2,"After buying all of the That Girl seasons that Shout has released which were beautiful, I almost fell out off the couch watching Room 222. In fact, I thought someone had replaced it with a bootleg copy. It doesn't look like any money was spent cleaning up the video or audio. Compare the video quality to other series that have been released that came out around the same time-Bewitched, Hawaii 5-O, Odd Couple, Patridge Family, and That Girl that have been released on DVD. Room 222 is not even a competitor. One episode on disc 2-Alice In Bluderland was so bad with an annoying high pitched buzz that I had to turn it off. If and when a Season 2 comes out, I will wait before I buy it to see the reviews.",1238284800,6,706,4.315789473684211

This show hasn't been seen since 1974 and we've become a bit long in the tooth awaiting its release. The picture quality is not as bad as some would have you believe. I, in fact, enjoy the episodes. Yes, there are some imperfections but nothing that will prevent you from thoroughly appreciating this rare classic. There are several other concerns that warrant our attention at the moment, so take time out next Friday evening and rediscover a simpler yet entertaining period of television history.

Room 222 in a charming, well written show that needs to see all of its seasons released.  If sales are not good we may certainly not see any further seasons released.  I am very happy to have this in my DVD collection. Of course I wish the video/audio were perfect, but it's completely watchable for a show from 1969.

However, the picture quality on the second disc is much better, as it is of the quality customers have come to expect from ""The Shout Factory."" This unique series is well worth the money as it brings together one of the industry's most prolific writers, James L.

3690941,4,B001LRL4Y2,"After reading some of the recent reviews regarding the picture quality, I was getting worried.  I have to say that it is not as bad as previously mentioned.  The first dvd (there are four in the first season) has the poor video quality you have been reading about, but don't give up on it.  The second dvd in the set had great picture quality.  The color was vibrant and 100% better than the first dvd.  I would bet that the third and fourth are equally impressive.

Please don't be put off by comments from people who only saw the first few episodes and made up their minds.  Give this DVD set a chance and you will be glad you did.  Boy I sure love that theme song!  The picture is just like I saw it when I watched it on tv 39 years ago, this doesn't bother me at all.

Also, it is apparent that the studio did the best job they could--for example, the episodes are about 26 minutes long, not shortened syndication versions.

We wanted very badly for this set to be released; let's not complain. It's not like Shout Factory regularly makes junk, it's normally pristine stuff; they obviously did the best they could with this, and it IS appreciated.

8319634,4,B001LRL4Y2,"The cable network ASPIRE began to carry Room 222 this year.  I DVR'd the series, and watched most of them.  I had seen Season 1 on DVD about two years ago and I really enjoyed viewing this show.  One reason I wanted to see it was as a kid, my older cousins watched it (I remember visiting as a kid during the summer of 1973), but I had to go to bed by the time Room 222 aired in its 9:00 p.m. time slot.  Therefore, the first time I saw Room 222 was about two years ago, and like other reviewers mentioned, it didn't have a second life in syndication.  I don't even remember Nick at Nite carrying this in the 80's and 90's, which was how I viewed Mary Tyler Moore as a young adult.  Other reviewers mentioned that the careers of many young actors of the 70's and the 80's began here, such as Judy Strangis (wow, she was pretty, a petite non-blonde with a ""girl next door type look""),  Audrey Landers (a pretty redhead who had a ""girl next door look"" also), Cindy Williams (aka Shirley Feeney, and auditioned for Princess Leia), Larry Wilcox (Officer Baker on CHiPs), Eric Laneuville, Ed Begley, Jr., Richard Dreyfuss, Richard Hatch (Apollo on Battlestar Galactica), and even Mark Hamill.

I noticed quite a bit, and I was a high schooler in the 1980's.  There were some similarities to the show Head of the Class (which hasn't had a huge following in syndication either) which was my generation.  Like Mr. Moore, Mr. Dixon went the extra mile for his students, and had a genuine interest in not just academia, but also their well being.  Students trusted him, and looked at him as a positive model (Mr. Moore had a few problems, but the IHP students respected him and like Mr. Dixon, trusted him).  It's also evident during the course of the show that the Walt Whitman High School students from the early 70s demonstrated respect for authority, which is something that sadly has gone awry today.  As a 1980's high school student, we were still taught to respect authority.  Another thing I liked about Room 222 was the students (like Head of the Class) actually studied - I can't count the number of movies about high school where the students are seen cracking books and taking exams, and quite a few actors and actresses (Laneuville, Strangis, Landers, and Hamill in particular) looked like high school kids.  Some of the Head of the Class actors were already in their mid-20's, but some of the cast could pass as high schoolers (i.e. when I was 23, I could pass for 17 or 18.)  There was also an enforcement of keeping up grades to participate in school activities, such as athletics.

It was also great to see a guidance counselor go the extra mile to get out of her office and be pro-active.  I went to a large high school, and only saw the counselor twice, and one of those times was a required interview of ""where are you going to college?"" (i.e. college isn't for everyone).  I also liked how it was noticeable that public schools still had a ""dress code"", and this wasn't because it was TV.  The students and the teachers are modestly dressed, with the boys wearing collared shirts, belts, long pants, and decent shoes.  Many of the females had a ""girl next door look"", looked believable, and looked nice in dresses and skirts. It's a far cry today from students coming to school in baggy pants, ball caps, tattoos, jeans with holes throughout, and tank tops and low rise jeans with underwear on the outside.

Mr. Dixon, Ms. McIntyre, Ms. Johnson, and Principal Seymour Kaufman also seemed to have more authority than educators today.  Today, there's always a lawyer looking over a shoulder, or politicians creeping into our school systems and attempting (and in many cases succeeding) in ""watering down"" education and discipline.  When I was in junior high and high school, a basketball or baseball coach had quite a bit of freedom when it came to discipline - yes, I remember coaches in junior high making us run a half mile due to some goof-offs.  I wish the discipline, the dress code, and respect for authority would come back today.",1476489600,,4047,4.579750346740638
