3473307,2,B001AY0FVO,"This DVD is the typical aquarium DVD except on blu-ray.  I was not especially impressed.  I've owned 4 now...still looking for a good one.

I immediately noticed an annoying buzz and pops on one of the sound tracks.

Though it is hi-def, the depth of field is very shallow so much of the image is out of focus.

It appears to be an amateur production.  I'm returning this to Amazon.

It has three aquarium choices...and that is it for the options.  No way to turn off the audio.

Why does every aquarium DVD producer think we want to hear this new age music along with the video?  And why do they never show the whole aquarium?  So you get fish going on and off the screen.  I want a virtual high-def aquarium...which means aquarium sounds and a view of the entire aquarium - minus the edges.  This music is annoying.

My blu-ray player is a PS3, and with many game titles you have the option of playing your own music while you are also playing the game.  That is what I am looking for.  A virtual high-def aquarium with aquarium sounds, mixed with my own playlist of songs from the PS3 hard drive.",1222992000,24,1099,4.3399014778325125
3473308,4,B001AY0FVO,I have a Sony 1080p/24p LCD Tv and the quality on this Blu-Ray is awesome! Its not a pan type shot. It is a still camera pov. Lots of colorful fish. I am having a party at my house next weekend and i plan on playing this during the party. The only thing i did not like is the lack of set-up features-none. The main menu has the 3 locations to play and you check the ones you want to play back to back but you DO NOT get a repeat option unless you have one on your BRD player. Otherwise a perfect display of BRD 1080p!,1221350400,16,517,3.8411214953271027
3473309,4,B001AY0FVO,"I watched this over the weekend. The disc contains three different ""vignettes"" of underwater marine life titled ""Sunrise,"" ""Mediterranean,"" and ""Caribbean."" They all contain the usual reef marine life including, but not limited to, corals, sponges, anemones, clown fish, damsels, angels, and a variety of tangs. Even has the occational sea shrimp.

All sequences are static scenes, no pan & scan, no narration. There is an accompanying musical score which was written especially for this disk by the award winning Gutleut Studios in Frankfurt, Germany which ebbs and flows along with the scenes and the accompanying ocean sounds.

The total running time of the entire disc is 114 minutes. Each of the three scenes last 38, 33, and 43 minutes respectively. It is shot in 4K resolution with the audio track presented in 5.1 DTS-HD High-Res Audio Surround Sound. Picture quality in my opinion is near perfect - you can distinguish the floating particulate and plankton in the water. The near neon color of fish is extremely well represented.

Having owned a 180 gallon saltwater ""marine"" aquarium for 15 years I can say that nothing is more immersive than the real thing! However, having said that, this is the next best thing and is EXTREMELY more affordable . After I initially watched this. I replayed it and sat in my favorite chair to enjoy a little reading. I found myself constantly looking away from my book to enjoy and take in the sights and sounds of the ""virtual"" aquarium being presented on my screen. If you've ever owned an aquarium you know exactly what I am referring to.

At any rate, overall, I would give this a 4.5 out of 5.0 for PQ & AQ and recommened it to all...especially if you want an ocean experience on a goldfish bowl budget!",1221177600,59,1752,4.810631229235881

3473311,1,B001AY0FVO,The name is deceptive and makes you think this is about marine aquariums. Wrong!!! This is a two hour DVD which is virtually created. SO all you see for two hours is fishes moving slowly across the screen. There isn't anything in the description or title to indicate that its just computer animation. So be aware of that when you buy this. If what you want is computer animation then this is the right thing. If you are looking for information about marine aquariums then this is not it.,1097884800,12,487,4.48314606741573

3473313,5,B001AY0FVO,"We recently installed a 7000 series Samsung.  My wife wanted it for cable but I wanted it for an aquarium.  Since the install I have purchased 10 discs (from Blu Scapes series, to Trains, to Carribean, etc).  This is the best one.  The TV renders it very well.  I kept an aquarium for 20 years and my wife and I regularly snorkle off St. John.  This is the disc!  It is the best so far.  It offers 3 aquariums and each are excellent.  The kids love it (age 9 and 11).  We sit in front of it with dry erasure boards and take turn drawing and then guessing what fish was draw.  Lots of fun.  Of my collection ""Carribbean"" by Picture Perfect HD and Scenic Moods 4-Disc Ambient collection are the best (though the ""Space"" disc gets little play).  On weekends we'll run these disks for 5-8 hours at a time.  Enjoy!",1376265600,,809,4.2368421052631575
3473314,4,B001AY0FVO,"I gave this film 4 stars because of the beautifull photography that is a relaxing way to spend ah hour or so.  There is no plot whatsoever and the only action is of marine amimals swimming in their enviroment.  IF you like this sort of thinf(I do, once in a while), then get this DVD.",1354924800,,284,4.1454545454545455
3473315,5,B001AY0FVO,I purchased this blueray disk to test out my HDTV several years ago....It looked great then. I would put it on and leave it running. It was fun just sitting and watching the HD fish swim around. Recently I went to visit my daughter and her new 10 month old twins and took the disk with me...  Both the twins loved watching the fish swim around....  Try it .. you'll like it!,1346803200,2,374,4.180555555555555
3473316,4,B001AY0FVO,"It is surely a great production given different view of aquarium.  As many review have already stated the best usage for this video is to run it on your tv to emulate a live tropical aquarium right on your tv.  Picture is clear, and each clip changes from dim lighted to fully expose lighting is great.  I personally think it will be better if the video can zoom out a bit more since most people are purchasing 46, 52 plus inch TV nowadays and fish would look more into prospective instead of BIG Nemo swing across your TV.  Video seems to just taken shots at center point of the aquarium with plenty of room left over left and right (because the fishes just pass by your screen and some never return).  I would love to have a zoom out clip to give a fuller prospective of the aquarium.  But again I am satisfied at the quality over all.",1276473600,2,837,4.265822784810126
3473317,2,B001AY0FVO,Gets boring after about 2 minutes. Its nice if you want to pretend to have a fishtank!!,1268006400,,87,4.176470588235294
3473318,1,B001AY0FVO,"I was very disappointed with this blue-ray.  it does nothing.  there are three stills of fish life, basically turning your tv into a lame fish tank.  i thought it was a show about fish, not a still.  i read the description too quickly, but even after going back to see what i missed, it wasn't that clear.  NO WONDER this was discounted.  TOTALLY UTTERLY lame.",1252281600,,360,4.461538461538462
3473319,4,B001AY0FVO,"This Blu-ray has 3 ""aquariums"" which unfortunately only one looks really good while the others were OK.  This reminds me of the screen saver application from the yester-years which looked great on a monitor to stop coworkers in their tracks and gaze at your screen.  Here, the concept does not work as well. Why? Well, I was hoping for some diver swimming and taking High-Def underwater footage.  I wanted to feel like it was a personal journey into the great depths.  Granted this is probably as real as it gets to having a fish tank, I was just hoping for something more lively.

On the plus side, there was a blue fish on the first ""tank"" which kept chasing other fish around which provided some laughter.  At times the lighting made it look so real that I had to get close to my TV and stare in awe.  I'm curious to see how it looks on a higher end TV like a 50""+ OLED or LED using a Digital cable.  I'm using a 42"" Sammy TOC with 120Mhz on HDMI hooked up to my PS3.  So overall, it's great for just a virtual ""tank"" to having looping on your TV with guest over or when you need relaxing images and music when alone.",1250553600,4,1120,4.220657276995305
3473320,5,B001AY0FVO,"when we have guest over I put the aquarium on - it does not disturb, but at the same time entertains the otherwise big, black hole in the living room ... the flat screen. Incredible quality - I fully recommend this - you will never get tired of it.",1243123200,2,248,4.081632653061225
3473321,2,B001AY0FVO,"I though this DVD was quite boring. Put in my player upon receipt, but found the aquaria were not very exciting. There are only 3 different scenes on the DVD, of which 2 are dark. Also the fish lacked colors and the whole thing was just much less than expected.

What you see on the DVD cover is probably the best frame on the DVD.
Waisted my money as I looked at it for 5 minutes and will never play it again.",1240272000,2,410,4.0
3473324,5,B001AY0FVO,"Video was very clear, as a blu-ray disc should be. Music was calming. And the number and variety of sealife was large. I would recommend this!",1239494400,2,142,4.5
3473325,4,B001AY0FVO,"Don't get me wrong, this is a quality product. I just wish there were more aquarium blu rays available with more and different fish. The aquarium of the Americas in New Orleans has a Fantastic large aquarium with Fantastic large fish that would make, in my opinion, a truly Fantastic Blu Ray disc. The fasination is not only in colorful fish in high def but imagine really big sand tigers, groupers, drums, hammerheads, ect., swimming by in high definition, for hours on end. I for one, would love it. I think many others would too.",1236038400,4,532,4.610526315789474

3473327,4,B001AY0FVO,"Hooked it to my blu ray ps3 on my 32"" lcd and it looks fantastic . The bigger dlp set was not as great because the fish and tank are just to big... I wish these types of discs would include different tanks for bigger tv's because anything over a 37' will just not look natural because the fish are too big.... a smaller lcd looks great and proportional .",1233446400,2,354,4.071428571428571
3473328,5,B001AY0FVO,"Our living room is tiny and our furniture faces a giant plasma screen TV. It is hard to sit in front of it when it is off and ignore it- it is like a gaping black hole-but when friends are over and it is on, it kills the conversation and steals the attention. The aquarium DVD gives a nice ambient glow and is relaxing to look at, but easy to ignore, much like a real fish tank. There are cute little crabs and lots of other neat aquatic creatures, and the colors are amazing. We watch it on mute because it plays sleepy, ambient music. My niece can't ignore the TV when she is here but when I turn on a show she ignores everything else, and the aquarium DVD entertains and inspires her without being all-encompassing.

3473331,5,B001AY0FVO,"I bought this for a friend after my wife liked this company's Bollyrobics DVD.  If you want something to show off your new HDTV and sound system during parties, you can't do better than this.

It's a great buy as you can watch it over and over and it never gets boring -- you'll have hours of chilled-out fun watching the fish do their thing.  Each has their own unique personality and they seem to play little games with each other.  It's pretty amazing...

Lots of fun and looks great -- either for a party of if you just want to chill out after a long day.",1225929600,2,559,4.186915887850467

The audio consists of some New Age music which is unobtrusive, but not particularly interesting. I think there should have been an additional audio channel with just the sounds of an aquarium tank ( the water bubbling, the pump,etc.) to add to the illusion.",1512864000,,400,4.527777777777778

8280134,5,B001AY0FVO,"I bought this as a natural treatment for insomnia. Got the idea when staying at a hotel in Vegas that had a relaxation channel that was similar to this, just an aquarium with soothing music playing. If your TV or Blu-ray player supports streaming you can also stream such videos off video sites. There are oodles of them. This Blu-ray is very relaxing and includes soothing music and sounds of the beach.
