8351353,5,B0025XW95O,"Critics were not kind to this first operatic effort for Tan Dun.  Many called it ""pretentious"", ""muddled"" and impossible to understand or to follow.
All of which means that it presents a real challenge.  It seems to be linear but it is not.  It does away with our notions of time and space, moving as if it were an extended dream sequence..  In fact, it requires immersion.  I must say that Dun moved away from this first period to simpler stories (Tea) and stronger music (The Last Emperor).  IN this prodction two singers shine: Nancy Allen Lundy and the truly phenomenal Zhan Jun in a role which requires him to sing, dance and do acrobatics, and keeps him onstage the whole time.  Magnificent production by Dun veteran, Pierre Audi.  I love it.",1434585600,,748,4.613636363636363
8351354,5,B0025XW95O,An eye-opener. Convincing integration of Eastern and Western music and a visual treat. Wonderful.,1425859200,,97,6.0
8351355,4,B0025XW95O,"I strongly advice viewers to watch the synopsis before the Opera itself (it's only about 8 minutes long).  The synopsis actually would have been helpful part of the booklet, to facilitate a better understanding of the opera and its detailed symbolism.
The opera separates Marco Polo into two characters -- Marco is the external figure of the explorer sung by a mezzo-soprano, and Polo is his inner being including his memory sung by a tenor. They are united at the end of the Opera into one being. Other characters making appearances include Kublai Kahn, Dante, Shakespeare, Mahler and more.  It makes for a symbolic/philosophical plot with many layers without strongly defined beginnings and ends.
Tan Dun, the composer, is more broadly known for the score of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, for which he won Academy and Grammy honors. His most recent opera The First Emperor debuted at the Metropolitan Opera in 2006.
The music of Marco Polo is a symbiosis of Chinese and Western Classical music. It is highly symbolic and requires focus while listening. For western audiences, not familiar with Chinese music and opera, it requires some effort, but once the essence of each scene is understood the music makes sense and it becomes part of the whole. When you watch this opera for the second time, as I did, it becomes immensely more familiar, interesting, and easy to enjoy.
The staging is somewhat overdone; the customs distract from the music and the meaning of each scene, themselves becoming the center of attention, which I don't think is the purpose of the opera.
This opera is for explorers - those willing to learn and experience something different. I certainly enjoyed the experience.",1420934400,,1697,4.992932862190813
8351356,3,B0025XW95O,"Marco Polo joins The Midsummer Marriage as an opera I really thought I would treasure, only to find that the music put me off from enjoying the fascinating story, intriguing philosophical depths and glorious mounting.

Occasionally the music would veer back into something I could assimilate (quasi-Britten, for instance) only to begin pointless screeching. Particularly from the Jerry Lewis character from the Peking Opera.

I confess that my best watchings of this opera were with the sound turned off, especially in 3x rewind. The strange but intriguing juxtaposition of piazza, desert, Himalayas and Great Wall, illuminated by the costumes, lighting and actors' movements, were a fascinating experience.

I suppose there's no accounting for tastes in music: but as someone who's been excited by recent operas by composers like Ades and Birtwhistle, I have to confess that too much of Tan Dun's score just irritated me.

(BTW, substantially the same impression of The First Emperor: amazing settings and movements, wonderful characterizations by the singers, but too much of the music left me flat (though much of it caught me better than Marco Polo).

Hence a three-star judgment for me; but if you like Tan Dun's music, then this is an experience not to be missed",1368576000,2,1268,5.196078431372549
8351357,5,B0025XW95O,"Tan Dun is arguably one of the most creative composers to come out of modern China.  And in that coming out, he has not left his roots behind.  This work is an early one, but stands the test of time very well.  The production is remarkable for both the costumes and the stage sets.  Certainly, a ""must see"" for modern opera lovers.",1280016000,3,331,4.290322580645161
8351358,5,B0025XW95O,"Remarkable photography, costuming superb, the soloists were of the highest caliber, especially Nancy Allan Lundy, who portrayed water exquisitely.

The fact that this opera has been nominated for a grammy award speaks for itself.  Buy it and see it before the Grammy Awards on January 31st.",1264032000,3,290,5.282608695652174
8351359,5,B0025XW95O,"Tan Dun is probably known best for his film scores to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Hero"".  This DVD is a performance of his 1st opera.  In ""Marco Polo"", the title character is actually played by two people: a woman plays the part of Marco, and a man plays the part of Polo.  The piece transitions between a physical journey and a spiritual journey.

As the orchestra tunes, the players are already on the stage, with others approaching.  The character Rustichello acts as a storyteller, and uses a sort of sing-speak method of telling his story.  The music is a combination of traditional Oriental and avant-garde Western (modern classical).  At one point, a sitarist and a tabla player join the actors onstage.  The staging and costuming are bizarre, and complement the music well.

""Marco Polo"" is very colorful and theatrical, like his opera ""The First Emperor"", which was a huge success when it premiered at the Metropolitan Opera in 2007.  Opus Arte DVDs (such as this one) usually contain an illustrated synopsis, which may be helpful prior watching the opera.  A 25-minute documentary is also included, allowing the viewer to learn more about the composer, players and crew.

8351360,4,B0025XW95O,"Richard Wagner envisioned the theater of the future as a coming together of all the different arts. Certainly for Wagner as for most other composers this ideal remains an ideal. Wagner may have brought together music, word and stagecraft but where is dance in his theater?
  Marco Polo on the other hand seems just such a work where all the different arts work in harmony for the sake of the whole. Most operas use the words to convey the story. Not Marco Polo. The words are few and far between and they do not primarily carry the plot. For plot you have to look elsewhere - the words, the music, the choreography, the stagecraft, everything.
  And for those of us accustomed to rather linear works Marco Polo poses some problems. It may be advisable to play the synopsis before jumping into the work. I preferred to jump in with no cheat sheets. It was hard at first but after a while I could follow the outline of the plot. I think I caught maybe 70% of what was happenning. And that is all right. Marco Polo is a strange and wonderful experience - just as the original story is.
  The music as a blend of East and West. I was a little put off by the Chinese style of singing until I realized it wasn't so different from Western Baroque opera seria. Both styles put the singer's virtuosity first.
  Is Marco Polo for everyone? Hardly. I have seen the three DVDs of Tan Dun operas and Marco seems the most difficult to comprehend. But it is a wonderful sound world and once you take it on its own terms rather than the expectation of what an opera should be it is quite a show.",1246924800,16,1579,4.346938775510204
