8002973,5,B0000TSR2Y,One of the most heartfelt movies I have ever seen.  It is told from the firefighters viewpoint.  It shows the sadness they carry with them and the strength they have to carry on.  You will not be sorry you watched this film.,1379116800,,224,4.285714285714286
8002974,5,B0000TSR2Y,"I live in the UK, and was able purchase this because we'd just been given a TV which can play Region 1 DVDs.

This film is a deeply moving personal account by firefighters themselves who survived 9/11.  I purchased it for our son's 13th birthday, as part of his lifelong ambition to be a firefighter, and how we support and encourage him in that life.  I wanted him to understand not just the glamour, but also the emotion of being a firefighter: the inner strengths that are needed, and for which sometimes your own strength isn't enough, you have to go to God's strength, or you are injured in ways you can't always express.

Finding a film by a firefighter about the single greatest tragedy of any Fire Service career, the loss of a colleague, a brother, combined with the single greatest loss of any Fire Service anywhere, was something that made me trust that even though there might have been language that would not be appropriate for our son, the experiences related would be what he needed to understand.  As it happens, I haven't found any language which I couldn't let his 8 year old sister hear, I have found firefighters who spoke with honesty and respect for each other.  I know that American firefighters in particular have a reputation for playing as hard as they work, but here there is just the open heart of professional lives trying to explain and work through the devastation of unimaginable grief.

So, the format was one satisfaction.  I knew the content would be, that wasn't ever an issue.  But, as I watched the DVD before wrapping it (because we believe in vetting all films as far as possible before we allow our children to watch them) I realised that what wasn't satisfactory for our family were the adverts that accompanied the film, and which came from Vanguard Cinema.  Those adverts were disturbing and shocking for me, because of their sexual content, and I couldn't allow our children to have that DVD.

The solution to this dilemma of a film our children needed in order to understand what happens in tragedy, and how people deal with it, and adverts which do not honour adults, no matter how much pleasure an adult may think they have from them, was solvable one way: copy the DVD and leave the adverts out.  I emailed Vanguard explaining our situation, to find out if they would give me permission to do so, and I was delighted to receive a very kind email granting permission for a single copy to remove the adverts.  A friend of mine arranged the copy of the main documentary, and I watch it now with the second satisfaction of a film production company which listens to its customers, and makes provision for their concerns.",1354060800,,2666,4.634819532908705

8002977,5,B0000TSR2Y,"Needless to say, if you've seen it on TV..You know what your getting.  I wanted to own the DVD, because I'm originally from NY and it was ALL I could think of to hold on to the Towers...My Towers, and I can't believe their gone :(

It was a very sad day in our history, but if you can call it a silver lining, those Fireman were out recording that day.

And for that I Thank them.",1292284800,,380,3.909090909090909
8002978,5,B0000TSR2Y,I was very pleasantly surprised with this video.  I felt that this video brought a very real human element to light in the face of 9/11.  We often hear of those we lost but not so much on the ones left behind and the guilt they often carry for being survivors.  The toll on the fire departments that day was heavy and often we forget about the impact it is still having on people all these years later.  I felt this was very well done.,1285372800,3,435,4.08235294117647

""The most heart-wrenching story in this 9/11 documentary belongs to rookie fireman Tommy Casatelli from Engine Company 226. He wasn't feeling well on that fateful day, and asked to switch places with fellow firefighter Brian McAleese. Casatelli drove the engine to the World Trade Center after the first plane hit and, as a result, he didn't go into the building. McAleese went in instead and, along with three other men from the 226, never came out. Casatelli's sit-down interview for the documentary is riddled with survivor's guilt, though the man is never self-pitying. He talks frankly about how the job of the driver is to stay with the engine and how, left alone in the midst of a disaster well beyond his comprehension or experience, he struggled to decide whether to follow his orders or gear up and enter the building. One can see how his decision to follow orders--not out of cowardice, but out of duty--haunts him, as does the decision to switch places with Brian McAleese. The validation and assurances of McAleese's mother, widow, and brother John, a fireman from Engine Company 219, have brought Casatelli little comfort. His story is a reminder that, for some, the horror of that day hasn't receded with the passage of time.

Brothers...On Holy Ground is the work of Mike Lennon, a retired New York City fireman who'd explored his interest in filmmaking by taking some classes at New School University. This documentary was an act of catharsis for him. Lennon sat down with over a dozen firefighters, a dispatcher, a few Manhattan residents, and a handful of 9/11 widows. With utter simplicity, the piece unfurls in static shots as each of the participants telling his or her story, the tales carefully and artfully intercut. The connections between the stories of John McAleese and Tommy Casatelli, for instance, only come into focus late in the film because Lennon uses no artifice to ensure we understand from the outset that Brian and John were brothers. That fact only emerges as John's and Tommy's stories merge near the end, a seemingly simple feat achieved with rigorous and intelligent editing. It's an effect that heightens the emotional power of the tales and emphasizes the brotherhood of the FDNY more than any explanation ever could. Former New York Daily News columnist Pete Hamill provides narration, but it's sparse and never gets in the way of the powerful first person accounts. What makes the documentary remarkable is the candidness of its interviewees (a result of Mike Lennon being a fireman, no doubt), coupled with their resilience in the midst of intense agony. This is not a weepy affair. Even Donna Hickey and Frances Santore, both of whom lost their husbands, exude a stoic pride and confidence in the nobility of the men's deaths that's as admirable as it is difficult to understand from the outside. (Ironically, John Santore had been interviewed by Lennon in 1999, and pieces of that footage also appear in the film.) What Brothers delivers with a clarity unseen in other 9/11 documentaries is insight into how singular a group of people firefighters are, and how incredibly they responded that day to a situation none of them could have anticipated.

The picture was shot on video and source limitations are apparent. The image is relatively flat, and the occasional artifact rears its ugly head just as one would imagine. Colors are accurate and fully saturated, though, and the overall effect is of high-quality, well-preserved videotape. In other words, the source itself has been treated well in this full screen transfer. The 5.1 audio seems like overkill considering the piece is almost entirely low-key dialogue, but, hey, far be it from me to ever complain about a crystal-clear surround track.

Extras include a small gallery of haunting yet beautiful still images of Ground Zero; a two-and-a-half minute introduction to the film by Rogue Arts' Ron Gilbert, who provides background information on Mike Lennon and the genesis of the film; and a Vanguard trailer reel.""",1257379200,9,4145,5.011611030478955
