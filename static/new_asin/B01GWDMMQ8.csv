8764249,4,B01GWDMMQ8,"A teenage girl has an obsessive crush on a concert pianist who lives in her building. The crush grows into an affair and a life-long adoration. The young girls romance is bittersweet because of the many women in his life. This film is a standard romance/melodrama with good acting and a good story. Nothing truly exceptional here, but it is worthwhile entertainment.",1513728000,,366,4.919354838709677
