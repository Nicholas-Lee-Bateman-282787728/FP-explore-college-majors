8558630,5,B00AWXI8HC,"This is a must see for those caring for the elderly, personally or professionally, and preparing for the future. There are laws that need to be reinforced and laws that need to be changed regarding how easily it is to accept signatures from people that are unable to think clearly due to mental illness. The film has encouraged me to begin to think about my future care plans and how those plans can be legalized and carried out when needed. Found it great for movie stars to share their stories because it shows that elderly abuse can happen to anyone. Whether they were acting or not, this is very important information that needs to be shared. There will always be criminals around to take advantage but awareness can help to minimize the chances of them getting to those who are aware. Thanks to all involved.",1527120000,,813,4.613793103448276

8558633,2,B00AWXI8HC,"Serious problem in USA, but this documentary wasn't convincing. Too much sad music in the background and Mickey Rooney crying so much that I wasn't sure whether he was acting or it's due to the documentary film maker.",1444521600,,217,4.7368421052631575

8558635,5,B00AWXI8HC,Everyone should watch this film and be aware of what is happening to our seniors in this country. Our laws need to be changed to protect our elderly and the abusers punished to the fullest.,1378944000,4,189,4.428571428571429
8558636,5,B00AWXI8HC,"Elder Abuse has become the Crime of the 21st Century with a senior being abused every five seconds in the US. Sadly, seniors lose $2.9 Billion a year from Senior Financial Exploitation. Only 4% of the Elder Abuse and 2.5% of Senior Financial Exploitation Crimes are ever reported. Pamela Glasner does an excellent job of weaving the stories of her family's elder abuse problem, Mickey Rooney's financial exploitation, and facts about the Elder Abuse crimes. I highly recommend this video and the guide SILVER AND GOLD"" to Law Enforcement, Churches, Clubs, and anyone who wants to stop ELDER ABUSE.",1374019200,4,597,5.040404040404041
