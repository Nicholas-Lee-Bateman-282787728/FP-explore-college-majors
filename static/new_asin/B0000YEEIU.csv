1958887,4,B0000YEEIU,"I was stressed out and having heart palpitions.  My doctor knows I don't like taking medicine so she recommended things to me that were natural.  To relieve stress she recommended this specific DVD. My doc is from India.  I bought a different DVD first from Borders, cause the only way I could get this DVD is to order it online and I didn't want to wait to start doing Yoga.  I started using the Breathing DVD from Rodney Yee, which I really really liked.

My doc told me I could just do the breathing part.  The breathing was great.  The other stuff was a little hard to do because he was doing thing very fast.  I'm new to Yoga.  I enjoyed the DVD, but I didn't like when Sampoorna chanted.  It was just a oooommm chant, but it still sort broke my peace, which is what I was going for.

Yogi Hari explains why you are doing everything he asks you to do.  The scenery on the DVD is trees and water.  Since it says ""at Home With Yogi Hari"" I'm assuming that was his back yard.  Nice.

I now use this DVD along with the Rodney Yee DVD and have been please with it's calming results.",1167782400,6,1082,4.159420289855072
1958888,4,B0000YEEIU,"Yogi Hari is an older guy with a long flowing grey beard with voice-over that is soft but stong & isn't annoying. The session is done on a old wood dock near a lake. The music is very light with flute & other soft instruments. The entire dvd is 73 min with no chapters or menu options.
It starts with 16 min of corpse pose neck stretching, chanting & seated breathing.
Next is deeper neck stretching while sitting & great eye exercises for 10 min.
Then the usual sun salutations of forward bends, plank, cobra & downward dogs for about 5 min.
For 30 min you have warrior pose, dolphin, leg lifts, modified headstand w/spread legs as well, boat, fish, torso rocking, seated leg stretches w/spread legs as well, butterly, yogi rolls, cobra, locust, crow, child, simplified angle pose & forward bend.
The relaxation is started w/him telling you to contract muscles individually & then pans to the scenery. You sit up & he chants to end the dvd.
There is a lot of rests in between the poses for a few seconds except during the sun salutations.
I felt stretched out a bit, I felt more relaxed by his slow pace, not annoyed. It was different the most mainstream yoga dvds I own, whereas they most times still make me aware of time passing. This I will do again, but not a favorite.",1147651200,10,1275,4.452991452991453
1958889,5,B0000YEEIU,"I'm surprised no one reviewed this video. This DVD is a perfect yoga workout. I bought this DVD to practice yoga at home. I have taken many classes, in many different styles, and just wanted something to guide me through the postures in the proper sequence. What I got was so much more. This is by far my favorite yoga routine. The instructor is amazing. He is peaceful, meditative, and incredible strong. His instructions are clear, concise and unobtrusive.  You are led through a complete yoga routine from
- Initial relaxation and centering
- Chanting Ohm
- Pre-breath exercises
- Breathing exercises including: abdominal, 3 part breath and breath of fire
- Eye exercises
- Neck exercises
- 6 rounds of the sun salutation
- Shoulder, abdominal, leg and hip strengthening exercises
- A series of Asanas
- Final relaxation
- Chanting Ohm
I've never taken a class that balanced everything yoga has to offer this well.
This yoga DVD doesn't have menu options, it just plays from beginning to end, and I like that.",1101081600,54,1012,4.782857142857143

8004483,4,B0000YEEIU,"This is a great Yoga program. It is of about 70 minutes duration; you must make this time for yourself to do this program. The slow warm up is important. For those who are not avid exercise buffs but have an interest in the matter, Yogi Hari's tapes are a good place to start. Persistence will pay off!",1385769600,,302,4.224137931034483
8004484,5,B0000YEEIU,Best yoga ever! Not some trendy yoga developed this week this is the real thing or as close as I've ever experienced. Im 26 and I've been doing yoga since I was in 7th grade on and off and I purchased this one because I was lucky enough to practice  with some of yogi haris students. Ive gone through many dvds and VHS and attended classes.  This DVD is one of the only ones that really captures the spirit and I improve a little every time I use it! enjoy!,1361836800,,457,4.066666666666666
8004485,2,B0000YEEIU,This wasn't for me. I really liked his Yoga at Home series and I couldn't even get through the first 20 minutes of this video. I like the om chants but the breathing and eye rolling was not for me. After 20 minutes we were still doing meditative postures. I'm a 40 yr old woman from the mid-west who works an average of 50 hours a week. I have always appreciated the spiritual and meditative pieces of yoga but this was too much. I do yoga to stretch after hours of standing on my feet. If I wanted to sit and meditate for 20 minutes and do intense chest breathing I would have bought a dvd on meditation. I would only recommend this for someone who is really interested in delving into traditional yoga and has a lot of time to spend doing it everyday.,1350432000,3,753,4.2
8004486,5,B0000YEEIU,This is my favorite yoga DVD. An authentic calm yoga experience. I have Rodney Yee and Patricia walden but this is the best for me.,1338163200,,131,4.28
8004487,5,B0000YEEIU,"I have been practicing yoga for over 15 years now. I took classes all over in gyms, videos even a college class; but Nothing and nobobys style compares to Yogi Hari's Sampoorna Yoga. When I found Yogi Hari about 5 years ago, something cliqued. I don't need to take any other class.

'Sampoorna' means fullness (Sanskrit). In his series you are working the entire body. All the muscle groups are being trained, heart, massaging lymph system, stimulating digestive sys., etc. But what is even more impressive is how it trains your mind. Building concentration, focusing the mind inward,and especially learning how to properly relax.

His voice on the DVD is so captivating. And the music , from one of his CD's (Shantih), is so relaxing, yet you don't feel tired, rather Alive relaxed.
I love commenting on his products bc its one area that has changed my and my family's life so much for the better. Yogi Hari's approach has taught me how to enjoy yoga, not only as a great physical exercise, but as a way  of life. (Check out his book 'Sampoorna Yoga'. The cover picture of the book makes him seem so serious, but I've seen him and he is joyfully funny and down to earth.) Hope you enjoy it as much as I do. :)",1205452800,8,1210,4.5159817351598175
8004488,5,B0000YEEIU,"Updated: Today is June 19, 2017, and I did this video this afternoon. 10 years after I bought it, I'm still using it, and it's still great.  Thank you, Yogi Hari!
 ========================================================================================================
Original review:

I have lots of yoga DVDs and had never heard of this one--I saw a reference to it on a review for another yoga DVD here on Amazon and checked it out.  I was intrigued by the reviews and ordered it, and it has become one of the most-used DVDs in my collection.

A caveat--if someone has never done yoga before, I would not recommend this DVD. There really is not enough instruction for a total beginner (actually, that is true of most yoga DVDs, period).  If someone wants production values a la Shiva Rea, I would not recommend this DVD.  If someone wants chaptering to be able to slice and dice the practice, I wouldn't recommend this DVD. However, if someone is looking for a deliberatively-paced yoga practice,  taught by a long-time yogi who really knows his stuff, with no show-biz razzmatazz and annoying New Age-isms, I highly recommend it.

It is quite a complete practice, with exercises I have not seen elsewhere (eye exercises); the music is very soothing; it is in an outdoor setting (if you've seen David Swenson's 'Short Forms' ashtanga video, it is like that--shot in a botanical garden) which I like a lot, and Yogi Hari doesn't skimp on the savasana at the end.  One of my biggest complaints about most yoga DVDs is that the final relaxation is only a couple of minutes long.

The DVD is taught in voice-over, with Yogi Hari demo'ing the postures.  He is incredibly strong and flexible; most inspiring!

I've been doing yoga a long time and I am long past the need to push myself to the utmost with grueling power yoga practices on a daily basis.  Yogi Hari's DVD is one that I truly enjoy doing, with zero dread factor, and I feel terrific afterwards.  It gets no better, for me.",1191888000,18,1984,4.811209439528024
8004489,4,B0000YEEIU,"I have always had great difficulty exercising on my own.  Typically, I would buy a video or dvd and never use it; for some reason this dvd is the exception.  I watched it once to get a feel of it, then I woke up early one morning and tried it out.  It was so fulfilling that I have have started reading books about yoga and practising with the DVD more often (at least four times a week).  I am getting better and I love Yogi Hari.  My only complaint is that the DVD is a bit long, so I really have to make the effort to do it early in the morning before my kids get up.  This DVD has inspired me to try out the rest of my exercise DVD collection that has gone unopened and unused.  Try Yogi Hari and be inspired!",1187136000,5,713,3.9097222222222223
8004490,5,B0000YEEIU,"What a great, honest yoga session. I could end up doing just THIS DVD most mornings. I have been using Yogi Hari's first four ""Yoga at Home"" series videos since 2000... and still consider them to be the best there is.

Yogi Hari's videos ARE probably what you're looking for in a Hatha Yoga session, you just don't realize yet. I didn't at first either.

This Level 1 DVD seems to me, to be Yogi Hari's ""Come full Circle"" session, after doing his other four videos for seven years.  This is labeled Level 1, but one could easily consider this to be as well-rounded and fulfilling a session as his more Advanced videos. It's also his most up-to-date video... and it's now the FIRST one in his older series.

Ths invocation, pranayama, asanas and closing sequence are as well balanced as any of Yogi Hari's other videos.

The choice of asanas are very are accessible to almost anyone, but challenging as well.

As YOGA INTERNATIONAL magazine stated years ago, ""If you're looking for the essence of yoga, look no further"".

I've tried all the contemporary DVD's, classes, and styles. I came to yoga from a fitness lifestyle... and it was Yogi Hari's videos, books and conversations with him that helped me to have a better understanding of what yoga is in general.

Get this with an open mind. It truly has more to offer.",1175040000,18,1318,4.602564102564102
