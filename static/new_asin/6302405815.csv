 Max Linder was a early, innovative, comic master that so many copied (including Charlie Chaplin.)
Very Good, rare video!",1407628800,,313,4.396551724137931
7825238,5,6302405815,"This is a wonderful documentary and cavalcade about the life and work of French comedian Max Linder, narrated by his daughter Maud. While having no memories of her father, she puts Max to life through his wonderful films which she carefully has restored.

To the interested, I've written a far more detailed review of this item on imdb. I just wanted to add a few words here as well, inasmuch as THE MAN IN THE SILK HAT deserves all the attention and recommandation it can get. Highly, highly recommended to avid fans of silent comedy and newcomers alike.",1133049600,2,555,4.663265306122449
7825239,5,6302405815,"Max Linder was the grandaddy of movie comedy. Even Chaplin was influenced by him. It's good to see that much of his work survives. I showed this film to some friends of mine lately and while a lot of silent comedy doesn't hold up well, they still found Max amusing. Particularly ""The Three Must Get Theres"" and ""Seven years Bad Luck."" 100 years after the fact, Max is still quite funny. How many of today's comedians will be able to say that?",1011139200,7,442,4.402439024390244
