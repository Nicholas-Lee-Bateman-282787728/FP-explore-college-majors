8335944,4,B000DZ95H6,"I just received this DVD and had to review it. If you are looking to introduce a daughter 5-16 to bellydance, this may be the way to do it. There are a few flaws, but it is Volume 1 so I hope these are improved if they make another.

The exercise section is more of a workout format than instructional. The voiceover explains what they are doing and moves right along. It does keep the kids moving, but might work best if the girls are taking classes or learning the moves slowly with their mothers. It would make a great practice DVD, and even comes with a CD of practice music.

The constant switching between adult instructor, teen students, and child students is a little distracting. The ""creative"" sequences are adorable and amazing - some of these girls have really learned their moves! Definitely inspiring for a young girl to see others her age dancing and having so much fun. There are also interviews with the girls and their parents.

This DVD is worth the low price, but I really hope they get the instructor to make a more focused instruction DVD by the time my girls are ready for it.",1145923200,9,1099,4.45771144278607
