508882,1,6302767911,"First of all, this review is only for the Madacy dvd set ""The Chaplin Collection"".
Wow, is this bad. You get 18 short films, all in incredibly terrible quality, with music that has nothing to do with the films or the era in which they were made. I cannot overstate how bad the quality of these films is. Recreation is actually unwatchable, it appears that somebody spilled their milkshake on the poor-quality 8mm film dub that they had, then put it on dvd anyways.
All the films are missing portions of their footage, some to the point that they are meaningless.
But it gets worse, because Madacy has given us a biography - two whole paragraphs. The description on the box is longer than the biography on the dvds! (My favorite bit of mis-information is that Chaplin started acting at age 9 with a dog-dancing group. It's called clog-dancing. Why the heck would Chaplin, who was human [although it's hard to tell from some of these prints] be dancing on stage with dogs?)
And there is also a trivia feature! Five whole questions, perfect for those who understand broken english and completely inaccurate trivia. (It states that Chaplin made 27 films - that is true, but he made many more after that!)
But the best part is that Madacy, after having put next to no effort into getting good copies of these films, puts on several chunks of high-tech computer animation beforehand, giving us their logo and presenting them as a worthy group to patronize!
This set may be cheap initially, but the you will end up paying much more in trips to the eye-doctor and therapist. Don't buy it. It's not worth it. Not even if you are desperate.",1036627200,6,1630,4.624137931034483
508883,2,6302767911,"Please Note: This review only refers to ""Chaplin Collection by Madacy""  It sometimes appears under other titles that have the same films but it is not intended to describe those transfers.
This set is boxed up very nicely. I thought that it would make a great gift. The quality of the transfer is disappointing but the worst pain is the sound! There is no attempt whatsoever to match any music to the action. If that isn't bad enough the recordings they are using have talking on them! You hear the musicians do some ... little skits about police and firemen. Obviously the individuals who created this collection didn't give the slightest effort to making it even a functionally entertaining experience. Every time the voices start it is like a train wreck to the story you are watching. They must have put this together on their coffee break. You will pay a bit more for other collections but it will be worth it!!",1035158400,2,916,4.654320987654321
508884,2,6302767911,"First of all, this review refers to ONLY the Madacy collection of Chaplin films. It appears on some pages for Image DVDs that were restored by David Shepherd. I like the Image dvds, and this is not about those. This is about the crummy Madacy videos.
Madacy video has some nerve. They provide transfers from the lowest quality materials known, record their tapes in the worst possible (i.e. cheapest) mode, use canned music from jazz records that are irrelevant to the movies being shown, show films at odd speeds, leave out many of the cue cards, and copy films restored by other companies (legal, but rather unethical).
And yet - this is the ONLY place on video to find many of these films easily, other than from Grapevine Video. This is certainly the only collection you will find in the stores that has some of these films.
That's why this collection gets more than one star. If anybody else had this material in better quality, then it would get no stars at all. But, since nobody seems to feel that the earliest Chaplin material is worth restoring and presenting to the public, it will remain available only in crummy dupes on crummy tape, such as this set.
This set, therefore, functions only as a stop-gap.",1015200000,15,1215,4.655813953488372
508885,4,6302767911,"This is a huge Chaplin collection featuring thirty-two of his short films from the 1910s and 1920s.  Be warned that while some of the films have obviously been well preserved, some others have not been as carefully looked after.  There are definitely some signs of aging in this collection, but that is only to be expected.  The poorer quality shorts seem to be randomly distributed throughout the videos, presumably based solely on who was in charge of taking care of each individual film.  A few of the films are of quite poor quality, however, there is nothing that is actually unwatchable.  This does not mean that the collection should be ignored by the silent movie fan.  There is quite a lot of excellent material included in this collection that will leave you literally falling off of your chair in laughter.
Chaplin did a lot of things very well in his films and with thirty-two shorts to view here, you gets to see quite a bit of his filmmaking range.  Some are hilarious, others are touching and sentimental, and a few others are early-film experiments that just do not quite work.  Chaplin obviously enjoyed the sentimental themes that run though his film, however, more than any other filmmaker, he consistently got them right.  The sentiment is not gratuitous and is rarely over the top.  And the beauty of the short format is that if you don't care for the one you are currently viewing, you will not have long to wait until the next one starts (just like Sex Pistols songs).
My personal favourites from this are as follows:
THE ADVENTURER -- the story of Charlie as he escapes from jail and wrecks havoc on some upper-class people at a hotel.  The chase sequences in this are priceless as Charlie jumps off of balconies and dives over banisters with the grace of a ballerina.
THE IMMIGRANT -- Charlie comes to America.  This is an excellent story that manages to be both hilarious and thoughtfully sentimental at the same time.  The downtrodden tramp adds a waiter and an immigration officer to the long list of people he has kicked in the backside.
ONE A.M. -- a drunken Charlie comes home late from a party and does battle with his house.
This collection is highly recommended viewing for any silent movie fan.",985132800,9,2229,4.699228791773779

7830746,4,6302767911,"The eighteen short films on the two-disc CHAPLIN COLLECTION include several ""firsts"" in Charlie Chaplin's career: his first-ever screen appearance, first time filmed without the trademark mustache and Chaplin's first wearing of a ""tramp"" costume (although he was not yet portraying his legendary ""Little Tramp"" character). Included are some of CC's earliest work with Mack Sennett, Edna Purviance, Fatty Arbuckle, Chester Conklin and so many other famous silent-era comedians. There's even a public service short promoting War Bonds.

It's a historic gathering of some of the earliest surviving footage of Charlie Chaplin. These 90-year-old films have not undergone restoration. In spite of less-than-great condition they remain important documents. This DVD set belongs in any silent movie fan's collection.

7830747,2,6302767911,"This 2-disc, 18-film collection of Chaplin shorts is a mixed bag that has been garnering equally mixed reviews. Consisting of 12 Keystones, 5 Essanays, and one promotional short, this ragtag assortment may appeal to Chaplin completists who can tolerate the substandard quality of the prints utilized. But for consumers who simply want to sit back and enjoy some funny films, there are much better collections to choose from.

Here's a brief rundown of the titles included in this set:

Disc One

CHARLOT, GARCON DE THEATRE (Original title: THE PROPERTY MAN; Keystone, 1914) Crude but funny Keystone effort set in a vaudeville theater, with Charlie as cantankerous prop man who interferes with many of the acts. This print is in rough shape, but watchable.

MUSICAL TRAMP (Original title: HIS MUSICAL CAREER; Keystone, 1914): Amusing Keystone entry, with Charlie and Mack Swain as inept piano movers. Some claim this film was inspiration for Laurel & Hardy's classic THE MUSIC BOX (1932); there are some similarities, but the L&H film is not a remake of this one. Print quality is only fair.

CHARLOT ET MABEL AUX COURSES (Original title: GENTLEMEN OF NERVE; Keystone, 1914): Middling entry benefits from energetic performances by Chaplin, Mabel Normand, Chester Conklin and Mack Swain, plus the novelty of being filmed at an actual auto race. Print quality is only fair.

RECREATION (Keystone, 1914): Terrible copy of a lame comedy. To add insult to injury, the actors' heads are cropped off, making it nearly impossible to figure out what's going on. The absolute pits.

CRUEL, CRUEL LOVE (listed on the back cover as CRUEL LOVE; Keystone, 1914): An interesting, offbeat early Chaplin effort. Print quality is better than most in this collection...which really isn't saying much.

A FILM JOHNNIE (listed on the back cover as A FILM BY JOHNNY; Keystone, 1914): This isn't one of my favorite Chaplins, although it's difficult to judge it fairly due to the poor quality of this (incomplete) print.

TRIPLE TROUBLE (Essanay, 1918): A couple years after Chaplin left the Essanay Film Manufacturing Company, the studio cobbled together this bogus effort by combining newly-shot footage (without Chaplin) with stock footage from WORK and leftover footage Chaplin's uncompleted feature project LIFE. Chaplin fans will want to take a look at the scenes from LIFE (notably a grim comic sequence set in a flophouse), but otherwise, it's a mess. Acceptable print quality.

THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING (Original title: HIS NEW PROFESSION; Keystone, 1914): One of the funnier Keystone efforts is notable for an early appearance by Charley Chase, though he's wasted here. Acceptable print quality.

CHARLIE'S RECREATION (Original title: TANGO TANGLES; Keystone, 1914): A so-so entry; the main point of interest is seeing Charlie perform sans makeup. Basically a novelty item. Acceptable print quality (compared to others in this collection).

WORK (Essanay, 1915) This print of one of the better Essanay entries is actually an installment from THE CHARLIE CHAPLIN COMEDY THEATRE, a syndicated television series (from 1965) that showcased early Chaplin films. Purists may balk at the presentation (the action is slowed down, with narration and sound effects added), but since I first saw many of the Essanays via this series, this came as a pleasant and nostalgic surprise. Good (but not great) print quality.

Disc Two

THE MILITANT SUFFRAGETTE (Original title: A BUSY DAY; Keystone, 1914): If you're amused by the mere sight of Charlie in drag, then this one was tailor-made for you. However, if you're expecting a plot, characterization, or structured gags, you might want to skip it. Personally, it's one of my least favorite Chaplins. Fair print quality.

POLICE (Essanay, 1916): This is one of Chaplin's best Essanay comedies, although there are better copies in circulation. Still, this was nostalgic viewing for me as it was taken from an old Blackhawk Films print. In the years before home video, Blackhawk made 8mm and 16mm films available to private collectors (myself included). Fair print quality.

THE BOND (Liberty Loan Committee, 1918): This promotional film was used to sell Liberty Bonds during World War I. It's a series of amusing blackout skits dealing with various bonds (friendship, love, marriage), including the most important bond of all: the Liberty Bond. Unfortunately, the print used here is so washed out that the stark black-and-white photography of the original is lost in a sea of murky gray tones.

KID AUTO RACES AT VENICE (Keystone, 1914): This milestone effort introduced Chaplin's Tramp character to movie audiences. It's basically an extended screen test, with Charlie at a children's auto race, ad-libbing in front of the camera. A simple, very funny short. Fair-to-poor print quality; better copies are available on other collections.

RIVAL MASHERS (THOSE LOVE PANGS; Keystone, 1914): Unremarkable Keystone effort benefits from the by-play between Chaplin and Chester Conklin. Fair-to-poor quality print.

A NIGHT OUT (listed on the back cover as THE NIGHT OUT; Essanay, 1915): This is basically a rehash of earlier Keystone antics, but Chaplin and Ben Turpin make an energetic team. A variable but generally good-looking print.

DOUGH AND DYNAMITE (Keystone, 1914): One of Chaplin's best Keystones is unfortunately represented here by a fair-to-poor quality print. A better copy is available on Delta's ESSENTIAL CHARLIE CHAPLIN series.

A JITNEY ELOPEMENT (Essanay, 1915): This is an amusing Essanay comedy, but the print used for this transfer has title cards that are so dark they're unreadable. Another botched presentation.

THE PROPERTY MAN and GENTLEMEN OF NERVE are not generally available on other discs, so diehard Chaplin fans might want to add these titles to their library. I purchased this collection at Best Buy for $7.99, which I suppose is a reasonable price for two discs that I won't be watching very often. However, if you're looking for some of Chaplin's early Keystone, Essanay, and Mutual films at an affordable price, take my advice and spend a few more bucks to get Madacy's other Chaplin set CHAPLIN: THE LEGEND LIVES ON, a 5-disc, 31-film collection. Though the print quality of several titles still leaves a lot to be desired, LEGEND offers a much better assortment of Chaplin's formative work than what's being offered in this carelessly assembled two-disc set.",1133481600,5,6411,5.264705882352941
7830748,4,6302767911,"I agree with the last review who liked this set more than the rest of the other reviewers. Yes,we all know that the film quality is poor,but it doesn't mean that people can't turn away from this terrific DVD collection. This collection consists of 18 short films,all of which were made from Keystone and a few from Essanay. The musical scores consists mostly of Ragtime,Dixieland Jazz Band,and Hal Roach-style music which fits the bill perfectly,although picture quality at times is dark and grainy as if they were taken from 16MM film prints and used as their best availible sources,which is usually the case with public domain films. Here are the 18 films in the collection released on
two discs:CHARLOT,GARCON DE THEATRE;THE MUSICAL TRAMP;CHARLOT ET MABEL AUX COURSES;RECREATION;CRUEL,CRUEL LOVE;A FILM BY JOHNNY;TRIPLE TROUBLE;THE GOOD FOR NOTHING;CHARLIE'S RECREATION;WORK;A BUSY DAY;POLICE;THE BOND;KID'S AUTO RACE IN VENICE;THE RIVAL MASHERS;A NIGHT OUT;DOUGH AND DYNAMITE;and A JITNEY ELOPEMENT.There are several low points to this set such as RECREATION which is barely watchable with its imagery blurry and sloppy. On THE RIVAL MASHERS,the audio becomes garbled for the first 7 seconds and on A JITNEY ELOPEMENT,the opening title cards are dark and murky looking. Depite these problems,this 2 disc DVD collection is an absolute must-have for any silent-film fanatic or a defiite Chaplin fan and that these films will bring humor and warmth to audiences everywhere. Enjoy four hours of THE
CHAPLIN COLLECTION whether quality is a problem or not!! Thank Madacy for,at least,putting out this terrific set! Just don't buy Madacy's shoddy and horrible-looking version of METROPOLIS.",1071705600,2,1687,5.467432950191571
7830749,5,6302767911,"If anyone wants to know why Chaplin was such a huge star and remains a legend to this day they just need to watch him at work in this series. A graceful, athletic, and uniquely artistic performer he had many imitators but none of them came close to his ability. Many of the films in this series are not available anywhere else. It's also a great historical record that reflects the early 1920's; the autos, clothing, apartment interiors and furniture; the way things were 80 years ago; the way our great grandparents lived.",1071532800,3,523,4.634408602150538
7830750,3,6302767911,"In 1914 Chaplin was involved in 35 films for the Keystone Studio.  Restorer David Shepard once said that there were only eight films from Chaplin's Keystone year that were in good enough condition to warrant restoration work, therefore he decided to start his Chaplin project (published by Image Entertainment) at 1915, Chaplin's Essanay period. Four of the good Keystone films are available on a Kino video, but only one of those four is featured in this Madacy collection.  That means that eleven of the 1914 Chaplin films in this set cannot be found on any of the high-class Image or Kino releases.  The poor quality of the surviving prints has made them unattractive to those high-quality publishers, so the only way you'll see them is if you buy unimproved copies from public-domain publishers like Madacy.  In other words, don't complain about the poor quality of the pictures - public-domain publishers make available many early films which would otherwise not be available at all.  In fact, there is one which has all 34 surviving films available, in four volumes - and I've heard on the grapevine that he is about to retire, and close his business!
Here is a list of the films contained in the Madacy Chaplin Collection (two discs): Charlot, Garcon de Theatre (a.k.a. The Property Man, released 1st Aug 1914); The Musical Tramp (a.k.a. His Musical Career, 7th Nov 1914); Charlot et Mabel aux Courses (a.k.a. Gentlemen of Nerve, 29th Oct 1914); Recreation (THE example of a print not worth restoring, 13th Aug 1914); Cruel Love (actually Cruel, Cruel Love, a.k.a. Lord Helpus, 26th March 1914); A Film By Johnny (actually A Film Johnny, 2nd March 1914); Triple Trouble (more like Triple Theft! An infamous concoction by Essanay of material from two shorts (Work, and Police) and a feature which Essanay would not allow Chaplin to complete.  They shot some linking footage without Chaplin and ""found"" the ""forgotten"" film in 1918!); The Good for Nothing (a.k.a. His New Profession, 31st Aug 1914); Charlie's Recreation (a.k.a. Tango Tangle, 9th March 1914 - no moustache here, and Fatty Arbuckle and Ford Sterling fight over Fatty's real-life wife, Minta Durfee); Work (21st June 1915, marred by a talkover); A Busy Day (a.k.a. The Militant Suffragette, 7th June 1914.  Lost until 1970, this film has Charlie in drag!); Police (27th March 1916); The Bond (rare - this 1918 ""help the war effort"" film was not included in Image's First National DVD!); Kid Auto Races at Venice (8th Feb 1914, an unexpected gem - Charlie uses his famous tramp costume for the first time, but not as a tramp.  All the usual mannerisms are missing, as he plays a camera hog getting in the way of a newsreel crew!  The title cards are later additions, as Charlie was unknown when this film was released, and they spoil the intended effect, that the film should seem like an ordinary newsreel); The Rival Mashers (a.k.a. Those Love Pangs, 10th Oct 1914); The Night Out (actually A Night Out, 15th Feb 1915); Dough and Dynamite (26th Aug 1914); A Jitney Elopement (1st April 1915).
I'm happy with this DVD set because the poor quality prints were what I expected, and I was pleasantly surprised to find so many 1914 films included.  I think it is worth buying just for Kid Auto Races at Venice!",1060992000,7,3276,4.854838709677419
7830751,1,6302767911,"I bought this at Future Shop and was debating for about 15 minutes whether to buy it or not when I saw that it was released by Madacy Entertainment. But stupid me, I gave in and bought it. What a waste. Almost half the films are blurry and jumpy. In one film, you could not read the title cards; the wording was faded. Very bad. Luckily, I paid less for this junk at Future Shop so I'm only out 16.99. I'll invest in some better Chaplin collection in the future.
