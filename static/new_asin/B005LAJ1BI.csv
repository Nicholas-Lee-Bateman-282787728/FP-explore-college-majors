4782356,5,B005LAJ1BI,I am slapping my elbow already! If you are easily offended this is not the show for you. It has the potential to offend just about anyone.

4782358,5,B005LAJ1BI,"If you enjoyed Summer Heights High or any of Lilley's other work, you won't be disappointed by Angry Boys. The series picks up with a (mostly) fresh set of characters, and the ideas keep flowing without feeling recycled. The story even contains more dramatic moments that make you empathize with the characters at times, which only makes the series that much more memorable. Overall, a very entertaining collection worth your time and money if you appreciate Lilley's genius. Solid 5/5.",1322697600,6,486,5.0875

4783419,5,B005LAJ1BI,You always think you have seen it all and someone like Chris Lilley presents life via humor in another way.  His characters are great (he plays a lot of roles) and the large cast of others are great.  This is one of the funniest series we have ever seen.  And the entire household was always there and laughing out loud.,1391385600,,320,4.3

4783422,5,B005LAJ1BI,"Love, Love, LOVE this series! The worst thing about it is that THIS is it- no more after season 1 :( so, that being said- enjoy every moment of it. Chris Lilley is a terrificly talented Australian comedian and character actor who plays various roles in Angry Boys- all of them ingenious, over-the-top, and strangely familiar... wonderful entertainment, slightly off color and definitely my go-to comedy when I'm looking for a good laugh. The series ending is one of the best I've ever seen on television and makes my heart swell. That's the best part about it, sometimes you don't know whether to die laughing or bust out a tear fest! I wish Nathan, Daniel, Gram, Blake & S'Mouse were real people, because they're awesome, and after watching the series several times, it's easy to get attached. Watch it, become a fan, and then explore Lilley's other performance art.",1389657600,,867,4.825503355704698

4783424,5,B005LAJ1BI,"Another Winner, almost like a long awaited follow up to We Can Be Heroes, Chris Lilley doesn't fail to impress while showing off his acting skills through a diverse range of characters.",1388102400,,185,4.8125
4783425,4,B005LAJ1BI,"This is a very quirky but fun series. We were sad when it was canceled. I think the comedic genius of Chris Lilley just isn't understood by all. One of the characters is a skateboarder and his overly controlling mother tells him to ""fat fart"", which is to say that he must fart so that he doesn't get fat. I have tried this, but it doesn't work in reality. If it did, I would clearly give this product five stars, as I am sick of eating right and exercising.",1387584000,,458,4.157303370786517
4783426,5,B005LAJ1BI,"Chris Lilley knows no boundaries in this masterful comedy.  Be prepared for outrageous sarcasm of the immature.  It may seem over the top silly, at first. But the characters develop, quickly.  You will be hooked after the second episode.  Enjoy!",1383436800,,245,5.05

4783541,3,B005LAJ1BI,"But what can we expect?  Chris Lilley is a MASTER.  I think he bit off a little more than he could chew on this one especially because of the cultural references that might be lost on Americans.  However, his tiger mom and son are praiseworthy.
The show is of course entertaining and funny, but it is not as good as Summer Heights High.  BUT I have to give him credit because who else in their right mind is able to commit to playing so many different characters all at once.",1377388800,,475,4.2444444444444445

4783544,3,B005LAJ1BI,"Chris Lilley's acting abilities are very impressive in Angry Boys (as they were in Summer Heights High), but overall, this show is a little more serious and less funny than Summer Heights High.
It is still a funny show, but I was disappointed because I had set the bar so high, and it certainly did not meet expectations.",1373414400,,321,4.551724137931035
4783545,5,B005LAJ1BI,"The comedy genius of Chris Lilley of `Summer Heights High' fame returned with this rocking gem of a series. Chris plays a number of characters including identical twins, Daniel and Nathan Sim. Nathan is going profoundly deaf and reluctantly their mum has decided he has to go to Deaf School. So Daniel decides to throw the most awesomest farewell party ever in the uninspiring backwater where they live called `Dunt'.  They also have a guinea pig loving grandmother, who works in a juvenile correction facility and is simply called `Gran, Chris also plays her.

We also get to see the lives of their `Legends', who are all being invited to the party. These heroes are surfing legend Blake Oakfield, African American rapper Schwayne Jr who is also called S.mouse! and has all the intellect of a door mouse and a girlfriend with the best name ever - Lasquisha. Chris Lilley plays both of these too. Then their third `Legend' is skate boarding hero Tim Okazaki, who has inspired his over controlling mother to turn him into a global brand, based on the fact that he is gay and therefore everything is `Gay Style', problem is that Tim is in fact straight. His mum is played by Chris too and is my favourite character in the whole show, but they are all pretty good if not excellent.

There are twelve episodes and the stories are all woven together really well and this is done in a documentary style, with interview pieces to camera as well as action footage.  The humour can be quite gross in places especially where the twins are concerned and the language can be quite adult, but I just loved it heaps and was totally stoked by it enough to watch it twice. So if a bit of down under humour is your thing then you won't go far wrong with Angry Boys - oh and the opening titles are great too - ripper!",1370736000,6,1799,4.50920245398773
4783546,5,B005LAJ1BI,"I am so happy to have this on dvd, I really like this show.

I would recommend this dvd for anyone who enjoys original character comedy.",1367539200,,298,4.4363636363636365

4783699,5,B005LAJ1BI,"Chris Lilley is a genius and this is his latest masterpiece. Much more involved storyline(s) in Angry Boys than Summer Heights High -- and all resolves in an ending that is so moving I still tear up thinking about it.

I don't think he could have made this in the US - he doesn't concern himself with political correctness, except to make fun of it in his subtle smart way. Chris Lilley is one of my heroes.

My husband just got us ""Daniel"" and ""Nathan"" (the twin brothers featured in the show) coffee mugs - we loved Angry Boys so much! Use them every day! (I'm getting a hat to match my Nathan mug.)",1360108800,,601,4.2631578947368425

4783706,4,B005LAJ1BI,"A show of debilitative male teens in recent feminism-swept Australia embeds a contemporary world trend of sexualisation and infantilism this work parades in Australia, the USA and Japan particularly.

As understood, the same male artist performed different film characters of various genders, ages and behavioural patterns hardly making a reviewer laughing at this kind of transvestism.

Rude, sexist, stupid as environment is by itself the Australian producers know surely the best while having successfully targeted a public attention to their opus.

It's interesting to see the same guy play so many characters and to watch how they edit the show to achieve this without drawing attention to it when he's interacting with himself. It get's more intriguing a few episodes in as more characters are introduced. I especially found the skater kid's plot line interesting.
