4709682,5,B005ION4U6,"I enjoyed all 3 movies. I originally bought The Most Dangerous game on DVD colorized, so now I have two copies. Oh well. I watched all three in color and in black and white. The colorization process beats the tar out of Ted Turner's disasters from the 90s. The black and white is very clean for its age. I feel like Ray Harryhausen should be congratulated for an awesome colorization of all 3 movies. He did the same with his black and white stop motion movies, and they look great. Hope he makes more.",1318550400,27,502,4.351063829787234
4709683,5,B005ION4U6,"If you take the time to review the films and the special features, you'll find tons of interviews and commentary by Ray Harrhausen himself regarding these movies.  He expressly states that he went to his partner company on these films and became the driving force behind the colorization and restoration of the three classic films found on this Blu-ray release: SHE, Things to Come and The Most Dangerous Game.  While he did not do the special effects on the films originally, he did become the primary color consultant on the films, which is why the original DVDs state the films as ""Ray Harryhausen Presents SHE (or) Things to Come""  In this case, since they have taken both films and put them into one package, it's reasonable that they've called it the Ray Harryhausen Double Feature.  It also appears that they are throwing in a bonus DVD of the third film that Ray Harryhausen color-consulted on: The Most Dangerous Game!  Is it possible that we could get two Blu-ray films in both color and black-and-white along with a DVD in both color and black-and-white for $17?  If so, that's one heck of a deal - I don't care what you call the package!  Although I admit I'm confused as to why anyone would be so upset that they've given Ray Harryhausen the credit that I believe he deserves for putting his interest and influence behind giving some of these classic films a new life... he's taking his amazing talent and turning it towards his own varied interests as he expressly states in some of the special feature interviews on this release.)

As a note: I do have copies of the original DVDs and I'd like to follow-up on the one very poor review that looks like it has also come out prior to the release of the Blu-ray. I'll be the first to say that I do not have the Blu-ray because it hasn't released yet, but judging from the DVDs on the films Things to Come and SHE, both the color prints and the black-and-white prints were surprisingly clean considering the age of the films.  There was very little dirt or grain on either film with She being the better transfer.  In each case, the color version was slightly better and I'm not sure if that's a result of color being applied or if it's because there is more restoration done to the film for color, but do not fret if you're a film purist - you'll be pleasantly surprised at the quality of the original B&W.  I'm very happy that this company includes BOTH versions.  It's fun to see the film in color (as the color does look amazingly convincing to the old Technicolor films), but when it comes down to it, I do like to see these films in their original B&W format.

I'm a fan of these movies and for the price I will certainly be purchasing this set.  It's worth it just to see the films in High Definition.  I'll update my review once the pacakge arrives...

UPDATE TO REVIEW: 10/13/2011 --
Received my copy of the Blu-ray in a timely fashion.  This is a two-disc pack with the three films.  You receive the two high-definition films, She and Things to Come, each presented in both color and black-and-white, on a single blu-ray disc.  The second disc is a DVD with The Most Dangerous Game in both color and black-and-white, along with bonus features for that film.  In regards to the blu-ray, this disc includes the following bonus features: Commentary by Ray Harryhausen and Mark Vaz for She, Colorization Process Interviews with Ray Harryhausen, Film Interviews with Ray Harryhausen, roughly 12 minutes worth of nostalgic Sci-Fi Toy Commercials (and trust me when I say that these will take you back in time!), as well as a couple of slides worth of Ray Harryhausen information including a biography and filmography.

I am quite impressed with the quality of the high-defintion films on the blu-ray disc.  As stated in my original review above, She is certainly the better of the two films and that carries across into the blu-ray format.  It is crisp and beautiful in both the color format along with the black-and-white format.  There is an interesting difference between this copy and the original DVD in that the DVD has a deleted scenes bonus feature which is missing from the Blu-ray special features.  Once you watch the film, however, you'll see that the reason why is beacause they've taken these deleted scenes and re-introduced them into the film and given us what I guess would become an ""Extended Cut"" of the movie.  The only issue that I have with this is that the quality of the deleted scene is not on par with the crispness and detail of the rest of the running film, so when you see this deleted scene, you will notice that there is more dust and artifacts in that section than there is in the rest of the film.  Otherwise, it is a superior high-definition version of She that if purchased alone would have been worth the cost.

As for Things to Come, this film is also an improvement from the original DVD format.  You'll notice more detail in both the color and black-and-white on the high-definition transfer.  This film definitely shows its age more than She does, so I do want to warn to keep in mind that the film is over 75 years old.  You will not find the sharpness that is a blu-ray standard on this one, but when considering that you get two very clean and crisp versions of a great film along with some wonderful bonus features, I still feel like it's a great double feature deal at an amazingly low price for blu-ray format.

As for The Most Dangerous Game DVD, my thought on this one is that it's a really nice bonus that they threw in on top of everything else.  The quality on the film in both color and black-and-white is about a C+/B-- (I don't want to stretch the truth on this, don't expect to be blown away by this one).  It's a fun film to watch and it is certainly viewable - perhaps the best copy of the film I've ever seen, but still not anything to to stand up and cheer over.  This is a very old film that apparently was one of Harryhausen's favorites.  However, the quality on this one is just nowhere near the first two, which I'm guessing is why they didn't include it on Blu-ray also.  So please, take this one as it was meant to be, as just a nice little bonus they are giving out with the purchase of a great-priced Double Feature Deal.  I hope this information helps you out!",1316131200,91,6292,4.506161971830986
4709684,5,B005ION4U6,"ray harryhausen authored the colorization of the original SHE. i have the dvd version and it looks incredible!! way better than the original black white version. here's to hoping they add color to every black and white movie ever made!! on my short list: manhattan, schindler's list, and raging bull! i would love to see those films colorized!! that would be amazing!!",1315699200,11,368,4.951612903225806
4709685,1,B005ION4U6,"This particular Blue ray release is an insult to the creative talent of Ray Harryhausen. He was not involved in any of the films included in this package (including the DVD extra ""The Most Dangerous Game""). The effects created for the film ""SHE"" were the work of Vernon L. Walker, Harry Redmond Sr. and Harry Redmond Jr. Linwood Dunn was responsible for the for the optical effects. Ray Harryhausen was still a young teenager when this was was released.

""Things to Come"" (the classic BRITISH productions) had an extensive visual effects crew which included:
Jack Cardiff, W. Percy Day, Peter Ellenshaw, Lawrence Butler, Edward Cohen, Ned Mann, Ross Jacklin, George J. Teague, Wally Veevers, Harry Zech. Again, Ray Harryhausen had no involvement in this production.

And the same is true for the bonus feature, ""The Most Dangerous Game"".

This is crass marketing, and a big lie on top of it. These films are all in the Public domain, and since that limits their marketing potential, these marketing geniuses, decided to claim that they are, in fact films made by Ray Harryhausen, which could not be further from the truth.

The prints used for these transfers, are fine grain 16mm sources, except for 'Most Dangerous Game"" which hails from a badly damaged and worn TV print. Each film shows serious wear(scratches, dirt) especially at reel changes. ""Things to Come"" looks very soft, with limited detail, and is overly bright, causing some whites to bloom irritatingly.
""She"" is probably the better transfer of the batch, but only by a margin. Suffering from numerous splices, and horrific scratches at reel changes, the transfer also has a noticeable tape drop out that proves its source was from tape and not film (and possibly a 1/2"" master). The colorization is laughably inadequate, adding nothing to the films; and only succeeds in trivializing the artistry and talent within these films.

Don't waste your time or money of this release.
It is an insult to the name of Ray Harryhausen, and to the actual craftsmen who made these films.
The producers of this disc should be ashamed!",1315699200,47,2086,4.948571428571428

4709688,4,B005ION4U6,"All these original films have been well restored and the colourising on SHE and THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME is OK but the grainier quality of THINGS TO COME does not lend itself very well to the process.  Although there are many who will watch these films in the coloured versions I preferred to watch the crisp and clear original 'Black and White' films.  As far as the stories are concerned, all the films stand the test of time. Only THINGS TO COME is a bit creaky because of its view of the future from when it was made in the mid 1930s.  However, its predictions as to the start of another war were frightingly correct (although there were many who knew it was coming by then) and the way it was presented would also prove to be fairly accurate.",1407628800,2,746,4.35251798561151

4709691,4,B005ION4U6,"Ray Harryhausen was a true special feature effects pioneer.  What he was able to do all those years ago is amazing! While ""She"" is a note worthy presentation - I primarily bought this set for the Blu-Ray copy of ""Things to Come"".

4709694,5,B005ION4U6,For the sci fi lover in you--Things to Come is a personal favorite film of mine and I was also happy to see this in Blu-ray. My brother loved this one as did his older children--I thought Legend did an admirable job on this one!!!,1395446400,,230,4.133333333333334
4709695,1,B005ION4U6,"Don't let the fact that these films have been released on blu-ray or carry the endorsement of Mr. Harryhausen deceive you. These are NOT the crisp, carefully restored versions released by Criterion and Kino, but ""colorized"" versions of  copies that range from the acceptable (THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME)to the appalling (THINGS TO COME). As an older film buff, I have never seen the need to artificially ""colorize"" a film classic. If a young person can't appreciate films like CITIZEN KANE, CASABLANCA and NOTORIOUS for the writing, the direction, the expert cinamatography and the acting, I doubt that daubing the screen with a few artifical colors will turn cinematic morons into cinesthetes. But if you think you're getting the best versions of these films because they're on blu-rtay, you're not. Pay more (or stream) and see the best versions available.",1377475200,12,855,5.151079136690647
4709696,5,B005ION4U6,"Things to Come is one of my ALL TIME favourite Sci-fi films. In my mind, it sets the precedent for how humans not only perceive themselves but their perception of the world around them along with the idea of needing to control all things around them at any cost.  Granted, it also shows our ability to adapt and change and ""attempt"" to learn from our mistakes YET the majority, as it is in most cases, wins and thus we (as a group) will always choose the road ""more traveled"", which history has shown is not necessarily the best road to take.

My ONLY beef is the lack of a better digital transfer. But I'm not in a position to afford the Criterion version of this film, sadly, so I'll live with this till I hit the lottery (LOL).",1375401600,2,730,4.282608695652174
4709697,4,B005ION4U6,Fairly entertaining early films.  Things to come very entertaining due to its so close to true predictions made and great flying shots.,1374278400,,135,5.136363636363637
4709698,5,B005ION4U6,"I bought this blu-ray without ever having watched these films not only because I'm a fan of Ray Harryhausen, but also for the price. One thing I'm not a fan of is colorized movies; the colors never seem natural and, no matter how much technology has advanced, they seem like a two-strip technicolor film from the 20's to my eyes. Fortunately, they give you the option to watch them in b&w too.
The first movie I watched was""She"". The transfer was excellent. Sharp image and original audio (with its limitations of the time, of course). Very enjoyable film that remindedme a bit of ""Lost horizons"".
The second blu-ray ""Things to Come"" didn't do it for me. Not only the movie is slow, but the transfer seems to come from a muddy print. I don't know if they made the effort to restore the movie nor if that was the best source available, but it looked too dark at times (even worse if watched in color).
The third flick,""The Most Dangerous Game"",is a bonus DVD. It is pretty enjoyable and stars Fay Wray and Robert Armstrong, the two from the original King Kong (no wonder Ray added it as a bonus). My only regret is that it should've been released in HD, but just as a DVD, looks better than the second one.",1371513600,2,1205,4.4324324324324325
4709699,5,B005ION4U6,"This is a B&W and Colorized Blu-ray versions of this old movie, ""SHE""..  Both versions are very nice picture and sound-wise, they did a nice job on cleaning it up and presenting it.  The story is a dated Victorian tale but for an old story it is well done and enjoyable.  Good film making.
""THINGS TO COME"" is a really dated view of the future (the future then, not now) but they did a nice job of cleaning up this film as well.  The colorized version looks very nice and the sound is acceptable, again in Blu-ray.  Not interesting for the story but nice film making again.  I have not seen the Criterion Collection version but they will not release it in a colorized version.
""The Most Dangerous Game""  is a classic tale that has been retold many times in many ways.  Here, again, is a B&W and Colorized version but in DVD, not Blu-ray.  Reminds one of King Kong in the jungle sequences and the acting.
All in all a nice package of old classic films that you can enjoy in the original B&W or in Colorized versions (supervised by Ray Harryhausen [RIP])",1370217600,8,1052,4.381443298969073
4709700,4,B005ION4U6,"Although this partiuar version of  SHE was not the one I thought it was , I still enjoyed it  ,I was looking for the Ursila Andris version. Color seemed very natual for a colorized film,  Print was in good shape as well nice image, The other Film was unusual as well, never heard iof it before,  All in all A good Blueray.",1357430400,,322,4.145161290322581
4709701,5,B005ION4U6,"""Things to come"" is a very interesting film, and for a great many reasons.  But the available versions made it difficult to appreciate.  No more !  Even the colorisation process gives a well adjusted plus-value to the movie.  The sound is good, the image very clear, the contrast well balanced, the colors very well chosen and adjusted.

This film, coming from the mid-30s, give us a strong perspective point on our own world view, on our society and the choices confronting them are mostly the same. Even, one can reexamine his vision of the future in considering how they saw what is now our past ! I would put this film on the required list of any cinema student or enthusiast, with the Citizen Kane, Griffith's Intolerance, Potempkine, Birt of a Nation, Metropolis and other great classics.

""She"" is also a very interesting film, with sequences that could take place into the classics.  Colorization is even better than in ""Things to come"", more efficient and artistic.  A very fine movie, but to be looked at from its time period.",1326067200,7,1036,4.748603351955308

4709704,1,B005ION4U6,"I am almost shameful to write a bad review for a brilliant format. But consumers need to be warned: these are horrendous transfers of these classics on blu ray. She and Things to Come suppose to be 1080p? They may be, but they came from bad prints! She looks to be 16mm at its worst and Things looks to be a VERY high contrast 8mm print. Scratches, dirt, spices abound! She looks the best (and that ain't saying much), where Things is unwatchable...thanks Legend Films for releasing these terrible transfers! I have seen better public domain titles on DVD that looks better.  Maybe these are the best prints available, but this is a travesty! I don't even want to mention the horrible DVD print of The Most Dangerous Game. All these movies should have been crammed onto one DVD, because this is what each one looks like. Pure rubbish!!
And to put Ray Harryhausen's name on this is beyond anything I could imagine!
Blu ray just got a new name: Crap Ray. Stay away from this product. You have been warned.
And to think, I was hoping for the 108 minute version of Things to Come.  90 minutes of this mess, I think I need to have my eyes checked out.
