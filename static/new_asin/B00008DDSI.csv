7981499,5,B00008DDSI,"I am a big fan of Farscape, as is my husband so imagine our annoyance when we bought this from a walk-in store and there were duplicate and missing disks. This purchase through Amazon has allowed us to resume viewing of one incredible show set in a galaxy way away from ours! So glad we bought this! If I could, I would give it 10 out of 5 stars!",1367798400,,346,4.028985507246377
7981500,4,B00008DDSI,"At the end of the second season of ""Farscape"" John Crichton (Ben Browder) was on an operating table with the top of his skull off as Scorpius (Wayne Pygram) has interrupted the surgery to remove the neural chip from his brain and Aeryn Sun (Claudia Black) was killed when she was trapped in her ejector chair that crashed into the freezing water on the planet below. Little did we know that the themes of death and seaparation were going to be so powerfully strong during the third season, but we get a few hints on Volume 1, which has the first two episodes:
Episode 301, ""Season of Death"" (Written by Richard Manning, Aired March 16, 2001) has the good news that Scorpius' neural chip has finally been removed from Chrichton outweighed by the fact he can not speak, a ""clone"" of the personality of Scorpius remains in his mind, and Aeryn is dead awaiting a Peacekeeper's funeral. Although Moya's crew makes a series of touching farewells to Officer Sun, Zhaan (Virginia Hey) has an idea. On the one hand bringing back the leading lady of the series from the dead was a bit too easy, but on the other it is clear in retrospect that we are being set up for a series of much more permanent demises by the end of the season (Four Wormholes).
Episode 302, ""Suns and Lovers"" (Written by Justin Monjo, Aired March 23, 2001), as the title indicates, is a pun on the infamous D.H. Lawrence novel and on target because the lovers end up being Chiana (Gigi Edgley) and Jothee, son of D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe). The main plot has to do with Moya's crew heading to a Commerce Station to spend their spoils, but a violent storm of unnatural origin hits the station. This episode strikes me as more clearing of the decks in terms of stamping out D'Argo's brief period of happiness, which does not strike me as being particularly necessary, although Chiana's motivations for the betrayal are a nice character touch (3 Wormholes).
These early episodes from Season 3 are transitional stories that resolve or reset many of the elements from the previous season. But they also set the stage for the two dominant themes of this third season, both of which will be brought home with some of the show's most powerful episodes.",1067040000,,2203,4.622448979591836
7981501,4,B00008DDSI,"I'm not sure what the reviewer before me is talking about;  this is DVD 3.1, and you do get the first four episodes of season three.  Great episodes, and mostly they look wonderful on DVD, but in places the transfer seems grainy.  Still, a fabulous collection of episodes, from a show that ended much too soon.",1059177600,3,310,4.5
