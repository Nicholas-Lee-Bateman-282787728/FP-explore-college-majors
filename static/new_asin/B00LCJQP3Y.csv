8665205,5,B00LCJQP3Y,"I love how peaceful I feel after Syl's yoga and refreshed!  This is wonderful compilation of movements to energize, relax and invigorate!  Syl helps me really feel the truth of each pose and be present.  Although it's slightly slower than other yoga practice I've done-that is exactly why I love it.  I don't want to be racing but enjoying more!  I feel like I burn more muscle too because of her points of perfection. She is an expert teaching correct form and honoring ourselves exactly where we are.",1490918400,,502,4.659090909090909

I love yoga and Syl has spent so much time thinking about how one asana will flow into the next.  It feels like a mindful dance.",1480377600,,267,4.196078431372549

I have taken the yoga teacher training with Syl and this practice has given me additional tools to teach. The people I work with on a one on one basis and all have been beginners to yoga. This is a gentle guide into the beauty and wonder of yoga!!!",1465084800,,364,3.9324324324324325
