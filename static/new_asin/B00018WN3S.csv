1980890,5,B00018WN3S,This movie was great. I loved it because it was so realistic and I learned a lot from it. I also liked it because it talked about gangsters and I like to watch movies about movies.,1126569600,,180,4.027777777777778
1980891,5,B00018WN3S,This movie was really an eye opener for anybody that does not know what it is like in the streets.  The only thing that I did not like was the fact that these girls were not even 15 yrs old yet and the one was already pregnant.  Then that you had to get pregant to face out of the gang. One other thing these 14yr old girls chillen at a night club and dancing in hooker outfits.  I thought they were supposed to be CHOLAS not PUTAS.,1091491200,,432,3.942528735632184

1980959,1,B00018WN3S,"This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen let me give you an example of some of the great scenes
Two rival gangs having a dance off at club I didn't know hardened gangsters had such good moves really wtf? Don't waste your time and money with this gem",1370131200,,264,3.9074074074074074
1980960,1,B00018WN3S,This movie was so dumb! Hated it! It is not worth the three dollars I paid for it!! You're better off watching anything else!!,1362355200,,126,4.291666666666667
1980961,2,B00018WN3S,The plot was good. The acting was OK. Secondary equipment makes it a bad film. Learning experiance was good not to bad.,1361750400,,119,4.454545454545454
1980962,1,B00018WN3S,Poorly filmed and bad acting is the best way to describe this B movie. I would avoid it if you can.,1358467200,,99,3.761904761904762
1980993,4,B00018WN3S,"I loved the movie,had good dancing,good action,it was probably one of the best chicano movies seen in a while,the two main girls are hot.",1280707200,,137,4.75
1980994,5,B00018WN3S,"The movie is based on the book Party Girl, by Lynn Ewing, a great writer. I had previously read the book,as well as her other books, Daughters of the Moon, & Sons of the Dark, all are great books. This one is actually based on the real lives of the teens she counsels in Los Angeles, The book is very tru to life & the movie followed the book almost to the letter. It gives a very clear picture of what it means to be in a gang. It also showes the lack of love, parental guidance, strenght & understanding, the poverty that leads children to join a gang, where they feel the have a family, & someone that understands & cares for them.
I don't know what lead her to write the book, if it was the despair that she saw in the girls she counseled. but both the book & the movie could certainly be used as a teaching guide to many parents to show them how their lack of love & interest in being a good parent  can lead their children to their destruction.

Since the movie is no longer available, I will reacomend this book is put on the parents recomended reading list, as I have also recomended her other books to teen girls. all her books seem to have a message, & that is to believe in yourself your own strenght & to not make the same mistakes your parents made, & live the best life possible.",1275696000,,1293,4.126984126984127
1980995,3,B00018WN3S,The movies was good but the making of the movie was poor. The lighting wasn't that good it would fade and be to dark in some scenes. It felt like I was watching a homemade movie that never made it to the movies or have been heard about.,1269734400,,236,3.9375
1980996,1,B00018WN3S,"Don't waste your money on this movie, seriously. You can watch free on YT. When you see the cover you expect it to be a ""gangster"" movie, like American me or Blood in Blood Out, but it's not. I mean what kind of ""cholo/as"" do dance competitions? lol it's unrealistic! Nothing to real gang life, there it probably 1 gang conflict in the whole movie and it's in the end, 1 girl gets shot, and that's all the action you get. Don't expect much from this movie.",1265587200,2,456,4.252873563218391
1980997,5,B00018WN3S,I love this movie. Good acting. Good story line. Jay Henandez is the best...overall a good movie glad that i bought it...,1257724800,,121,4.545454545454546
1980998,4,B00018WN3S,"Thia movie depicted the reality of what is going on in LA and in most parts of the world. Gangs are widespread and the violence is escalating because of the pressure put on others who want out of this kind of life. I like the characters in the movie, they seemed so gang like and the way they talk is how I see most latin gangs talk. A good movie.",1257552000,,347,3.9714285714285715
1980999,5,B00018WN3S,both of the women in this movie was very fine. then they was gangsters also. the person that made this movie i hope makes more movies like this. they told it like it really is to me. its worth buying.,1252713600,,200,4.025
1981000,4,B00018WN3S,"The movie was good enough to get the point across. There was a few things that didn't seem to mesh as far as the age issues and a couple of other things that went down. Although I do think that the realistic lifestyles made up for the parts that seemed to be almost filler.
The girls were great they made the story move and you could really see the different CHOICES that they were making.
I have to say that I did appreciate this one just as much as Mi Vida Loca for the different story that took into account the school aspect and really brought the families into the film. Familia is important and they are apart of the struggles that our kids go through and often are why our kids get involved in the gang life.
Effectively put things in a perspective opening up the conflicts that one would go through after the glammer of the Life begins to fade. I also appreciated that there were two gang members who realized that they need to change things and talk to kids about getting out of the life.
Unfortunately many don't get the chance to retire from the life. It's positive that they were able to see that at a younger age and not have to learn it later in prison, like so many of our brothers and sisters.

1981001,5,B00018WN3S,"To put it simply, I thoght this movie was outstanding. Which suprised me a little because I had heard A LOT of negative opinions about it, so when I sat down to watch LTL I wasn't expecting much. This is what I call a story film. A movie made to make you feel and think, and  not so much to entertain. I have not read the novel that this movie is based on, Party Girl by Lynne Ewing. So I don't know if the film is true to it. but to me this movie was so good, i'm not sure it matters. Katrina Gibson, plays fearless and explosive Kata, who believes there is nothing in life beyond the endless cycle of death and retribution that is gang life. Kata has no one in her life that she can count on except for her best Friend Ana(Melinda Prado) who's gentel yet determined spirit is being crushed by the life, not to mention secrets that she's keeping even from Kata.

The story is about the depths that friendship can reach, and what your left with when you lose what matters most. there several stand out perfomances here beyond the two main leads. The beautiful Angela Alvarado plays Pilar, Kata's emotionally absent mother who's been sinking in a sea of alcohol and disappointment for years. Abel Soto Plays Pocho who was abandoned by his mother and uses his gang leadership to hide his pain. and Jay Hernandez who plays the gentle and intense Kikicho. Who wants out of the life But desperately wants to be with Kata, she wants him as well but cannot let her guard down.

Like I said I can't say enough about it, if you liked Mi Vida Loca this is similar. it's addictive Needless to say I recommend Living The life as one you'll want to own.",1188259200,7,1640,4.300970873786408
1981002,5,B00018WN3S,This was an excellent movie and i am so glad that i watched it. the movie was definitly worth the blockbuster fee.  the only thing in this movie that i could have gone without are the accents that at times seemed a little forced.  this movie does a good job showing the lives of two teenage girls having to deal with life in the gangs in the ghetto where there really is no other way to live.  i also liked this movies because of the cast.  the director of this movie introduced many new faces of Latino actor and actresses giving them a chance to shine which i really appreciated.  The actor Abel Soto that played Pocho gave in my opinion a wonderful perfomance ( it also doesnt hurt because of how fine he is.)Overall this was an excellent movie and i recommend it.,1139184000,6,767,4.298611111111111
8008402,5,B00018WN3S,"Awesome movie, Jay Hernandez is really young in this flick. Lost my DVD, so i bought the digital streaming version, quality is just as great. if your into Mi Vida Loca, Mi familia, blood in Blood out, check this out!! Highly recommended.",1479859200,,237,4.666666666666667

8008409,1,B00018WN3S,I didn't really enjoy this film at all. It seemed geared towards 14 year olds and there were awkward pauses in much of the dialogue. Eveything just seemed like such a cliche.,1442016000,,174,4.46875
