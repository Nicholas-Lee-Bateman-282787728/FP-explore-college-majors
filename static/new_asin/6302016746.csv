419823,3,6302016746,Charles solomon makes the best Will Spanner IMO.This has what you expect from the series nudity and cheesy special effects which is in part why I like it. I have the whole series minus part 13 which I can't find yet. If your a fan of WC this is one of the best ones.,1166313600,2,266,3.9444444444444446
7820468,3,6302016746,"WITCHCRAFT 3: THE KISS OF DEATH (1991) begins in a bar / club, or it could be a coal mine, as it would be just as dark, mostly due to the ""cool"" early 90's clothing, which is all black. A woman is killed by what appears to be a demon in human form, or it could be the Fonz (Hey! Whoa!), since he's wearing his clothes. Demon / Fonz gives his victim the lip-lock of the title. After meeting up w/ a female, in very interesting pants, the Fonz / demon drives into the night. Meanwhile, we are re-introduced to Will Spanner (Charles Solomon Jr.) from WITCHCRAFT 2, who is now a defense attorney. During his latest case, he meets Rev. Jondular (William Lewis Baker), who becomes very important to Will as things progress. Later, Will coincidentally meets the Fonz / demon, who goes on to kill another woman w/ his mouth. Will's fashion-designer wife Charlotte (Lisa Toothman) doesn't understand Will's bizarre behavior, lately. She apparently missed the first two installments of this series! She was probably too busy outfitting models in her latest frilly curtain / comforter dress concoctions. When Will needs some ""help"" w/ a ""problem"" at work, Fonz / demon, also known as Louis (Domonic Luciana), and his dippy mystery woman, who is known as Roxy (Leana Hall), offer their services. Oh no! Their idea of assistance involves murder! Will finds himself worse off, and only Rev. Jondular, w/ his mystical powers and hyperbolic voice, can save him! The Reverend knows who / what Louis really is, and that only Will can defeat him. Will Will - see what I did there?- rise to the occasion? Especially, since he must save Charlotte from a killer hickey? W3:TKOD has less story, and more nudity than the prior two movies. The final confrontation sends Will and Louis hurtling through Charlotte's fall collection! Dull in spots, but not terminally so...",1506902400,,1845,4.76875
