5274174,4,B0096RC57O,"While Season 4 of ""Hazel"" isn't necessarily the series' best, the wonderful Shirley Booth and the cast always elevate the material and Shout Factory are to be commended for continuing the Sony-abandonded series thus far. They've gifted us with THREE sets this calendar year (and I hope the final one is released sometime early in 2013), and I've enjoyed each one immensely. Like the old saying goes ""They don't make 'em like this anymore"". Bear in mind, these are not new digitally-remastered transfers taken from the original film elements. Shout had to make due with video masters likely made in the 1980s, so the picture quality is not of Hi-Def Bluray quality here. Still, I'd rather have these than nothing at all. This set consists of 26 episodes that aired originally on NBC during the 1964-65 season:

17/Sep/64  Never Trouble Trouble
24/Sep/64  Luncheon with the Governor
01/Oct/64  Ain't That a Knee Slapper?
08/Oct/64  Marriage Trap (a.k.a.) George's Law Partner (Ken Berry guest stars)
15/Oct/64  The Flagpole (Frank Cady guest stars)
22/Oct/64  Welcome Back, Kevin (Michael Callan guest stars)
29/Oct/64  Mind Your Own Business (Francine York guest stars)
05/Nov/64  High Finance Hits a New Low
12/Nov/64  Just Me, Harold and the Universe
19/Nov/64  Mix-Up on Marshall Road
26/Nov/64  A Lesson in Diplomacy
03/Dec/64  To Build or Not to Build
10/Dec/64  Better to Have Loved and Lost
17/Dec/64  Hazel Squares the Triangle
24/Dec/64  Just 86 Shopping Minutes to Christmas
07/Jan/65  Champagne Tony

21/Jan/65  Love 'em and Leave 'em
04/Feb/65  Temper, Temper
11/Feb/65  Bonnie Boy
18/Feb/65  Stop Rockin' Our Reception
25/Feb/65  What's Bugging Hazel?
04/Mar/65  Hazel's Day in Court
11/Mar/65  Hazel's Inquisitive Mind
18/Mar/65  George's Man Friday (Harold Gould guest stars)
25/Mar/65  The Investor (John Banner guest stars)

This is the least season to star Don DeFore and Whitney Blake as next season Hazel switches families when the original Baxters move to Saudi Arabia (!). It's business as usual here except for a pair of new semi-regulars as a few stories revolve around George's business partner (Lauren Gilbert) and his new bride (Karen Steele). Of course Hazel being herself can't help but get involved in the newlyweds marital issues. This season also brings a new theme song to the series, but it's not really as catchy as the one for Seasons 2-3 or the forthcoming Season 5 theme. Actually, the closing version of it is much better than the opening, but it's still perhaps my least favorite ""Hazel"" theme.

Again, not the best season of ""Hazel"" and the prints are not stellar, but a terrific addition to your library of Classic '60s sitcoms and a nice time capsule of the era. Bring on Season 5!

5274175,5,B0096RC57O,"Yesterday would have been SHIRLEY BOOTH'S 118TH BIRTHDAY. She wasn't the only "" BAXTER FAMILY MEMBER"" to have had a BIRTHDAY THIS MONTH. BOBBY BUNTROCK'S BIRTHDAY WOULD HAVE BEEN ON AUGUST 04, 2016. He would have been 64 YEARS OLD. AND DON DEFORE'S BIRTHDAY WAS LAST THURSDAY, ON AUGUST 25, 2016. He would have been 103 YEARS OLD. This season had some changes. When the season opens, the Opening Credit on the first Episode: ""NEVER TROUBLE TROUBLE"", is the ""Toll Collector"". This Credit Opening was used in the last Episode in Season 3 in 1964. It was also used during the 1964 Summer Reuns. Then one more time for the Opening Credits on the first Episode of Season 4. Every Opening Episode after that one is the ""Keys"" Opening. On some of the Episodes, we see ""Colorful Dancing Sticks"". There is even a ""FORD CAR COMMERCIAL"" during the ""Closing Credits"" on Episode 16: ""CHAMPAGNE TONY"".

Other changes are: DOROTHY'S hair goes back and forth between a little longer to a shorter hairdo. HAZEL'S hair color changed from Brown to a deeper red, fuller, and a bit more stylish hairdo. That seemed to gave happened a few times during this Season. HAROLD is a bit taller. And GEORGE is a little chunkier. Now I know that these are not changes to the show. Only physical changes concerning the cast. Also SHIRLEY'S weight subtlety went up and down a bit, too.

This is the Last Season that has any HOLIDAY EPISODES. Episode 11: ""A LESSON IN DIPLOMACY"", which aired on 11-26-1964, is a THANKSGIVING EPISODE. And Episode 15: ""JUST 86 SHOPPING MINUTES TO CHRISTMAS"", which aired on 12-24-1964. We also find out this Season on Episode 14: ""HAZEL SQUARES THE TRIANGLE"", that ""NANCY THOMPSON"", played in Seasons 1 and 2 by DAVEY DAVISON, GEORGE'S NIECE, has gotten married, except her husband name is never mentioned. THIS IS ALSO THE SEASON IN WHICH GEORGE, AND DOROTHY DISAPPEARS WHEN IT ENDS. After this Season, we also will no longer see: MR. GRIFFIN, MR. EGAN, OR ANY MORE OF GEORGE'S FRIENDS OR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES, GEORGE'S SECRETARY, PLAYED BY MOLLY DODD, MOST OF HAZEL'S FRIENDS, THE JOHNSONS, OR SMILEY,THE DOG. This was also the last year that  HAZEL WAS AIRED ON NBC. It went to ""CBS"" FOR THE 5TH and FINAL SEASON.

BELOW ARE MY INTERPRETATIONS OF THE EPISODES:

EPISODE 1: ""NEVER TROUBLE TROUBLE"" -  George refuses to help his Cousin Fred anymore. Then when ""THE BAXTER'S"" house is burglarized Fred is suspected.
EPISODE 2:  ""LUNCHEON WITH THE GOVERNOR"" - Hazel maneuvers a way for some College Students who are in need of affordable housing, to get to talk to the Governor. NOTE: This was one of the episodes in which George acts like a real snooty snob.
EPISODE 3: ""AIN'T THAT A KNEE SLAPPER?"" - George has to get Mr. GRIFFIN and Mr. EGAN together to sign a BUSINESS CONTRACT. So Dorothy suggest that George invites them both to Dinner for the signing. The trouble is whose ""Dinner Choice"" will Hazel choose to serve.
EPISODE 4: ""MARRIAGE TRAP"" - HAZEL steps in to put her friends Phil and Linda back together after George's Partner ""Harry Noll"" ""Accidentally Proposes"" to Linda and she accepts.
EPISODE 5: ""THE FLAGPOLE"" - George is gifted an AMERICAN FLAG from Washington DC, for Harold. Hazel then gets George to agree to buy a 30 Foot FlagPole.
EPISODE 6: ""WELCOME BACK, KEVIN"" - Hazel wants to help George's Nephew, Kevin Burkett, played by Michael Callen, to get back into society, after his hitch in the Army. But there's a problem: Not anyone who was acquainted with Kevin before he went into THE SERVICE seems to want to have anything to do with him. Of course HAZEL goes about finding out why, so that she could help patch up the situation.
EPISODE 7: ""MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS"" - After Hazel embarrasses George, George then makes it clear that he does not want her to butt into anymore of his business.
EPISODE 8: ""HIGH FINANCE HITS A NEW LOW"" - When ""THE JOHNSONS"" wind up in financial trouble again, George reluctantly assist them, but only if they agree to do what he tells them. And he puts them on a budget. NOTE: THIS IS THE LAST EPISODE IN WHICH ""THE JOHNSONS"" APPEAR.
EPISODE 9: ""JUST ME, HAROLD AND THE UNIVERSE"" - Hazel enters a HOUSEKEEPING CONTEST, hoping to win the Tickets to the WORLD FAIR, with the intent to take Harold for his upcoming BIRTHDAY. She has to have a BAKE-OFF with Mrs. MASTERS, played by PEGGY REA, who was famous for playing the Wife of ""Boss Hogg"" on ""THE DUKES OF HAZZARD"".
EPISODE 10: ""MIX-UP ON MARSHALL ROAD"" - Much to George's dismay Hazel helps to sell the house that's next door, to his Partner ""Harry Noll"" and his New Bride, Rita Linda, played by ""KAREN STEELE"".
EPISODE 11: ""A LESSON IN DIPLOMACY"" - George is asked to Entertain A ""FOREIGN DIPLOMAT"" - on the day before ""THANKSGIVING"". Hazel has a difficult time holding her tongue against his rudeness. Then when the ""FOREIGN DIPLOMAT"" comes back on ""THANKSGIVING DAY"" with the same behavior, Hazel tells him off.
EPISODE 12: ""TO BUILD OR NOT BUILD"" - ""THE BAXTER'S KITCHEN"" is falling apart. Besides not enough cabinet space, there is a need for more Electrical Outlets and appliances that needs to be fixed. So Hazel and Dorothy devices a plan to get George to remodel the kitchen.
EPISODE 13: ""BETTER TO HAVE LOVED AND LOST"" - Rita Noll asked Hazel to help her to become more like Dorothy, in ""Household Duties"". When Hazel comes over and sees a Negligee in one of their trash cans, she gives it to Rita. When Rita confronts Harry about the Negligee he came up with a silly explanation.
EPISODE 14: ""HAZEL SQUARES THE TRIANGLE"" - When Deirdre pushes her husband into a ""Near Separation"" Hazel goes to a few extremes to bring them back together. NOTE: IN THIS EPISODE WE SEE DEIRDRE IN HER MOST CONVINCING EMOTIONAL STATE.
EPISODE 15: ""JUST 86 SHOPPING MINUTES TO CHRISTMAS"" - When George decides that commercialism is spoiling CHRISTMAS for them he starts changing their usual CHRISTMAS PLANS. But Hazel disagrees and sets the wheels in motion to change his mind.
EPISODE 16: ""CHAMPAGNE TONY"" - Hazel has to track down TONY LEMA'S GOLF CLUBS after she accidentally puts them into the wrong car, one that looks exactly like the :BAXTER'S CAR"". NOTE: THE ENDING CREDITS ON THIS EPISODE INCLUDES A CAR COMMERCIAL FOR FORD CARS.

EPISODE 18: ""LOVE 'EM AND LEAVE 'EM"" - Hazel embarrasses Harold by coming to his School Class Party. Hazel is oblivious to the problem until Harold's Teacher points it out to her. She then realizes that Harold is growing up and won't be needing her much longer.
EPISODE 19: ""TEMPER, TEMPER"" - HAZEL'S Boyfriend ""Enzo Martelli"", played by GREGORY MORTON, helps George to smooth over his difficult client ""Bianca Bellini"", played by BARBARA SHELLEY, putting a damper on Enzo's and HAZEL'S Evening. NOTE: THIS IS BARBARA SHELLEY'S SECOND AND LAST APPEARANCE ON ""HAZEL"". SHE APPEARED IN SEASON IN 3, IN THE EPIDODE: ""PICCOLO MONDO"", as ""Anna Forti"". In both times that she appeared her character spoke ITALIAN, and Hazel's Boyfriend, ""Enzo Martelli"", was asked to intervene on GEORGE'S behalf.
EPISODE 20: ""BONNIE BOY"" -  Hazel gets into trouble when she buy a sweepstakes ticket and gives it to George, for his BIRTHDAY, who then wins. The problem is, the ticket isn't legitimate, because it's connected to illegal Gambling Activities.
EPISODE 21: ""STOP ROCKIN' OUR RECEPTION"" - George blames the problems with their TV SET on Harold's Friend's Ham Radio. But it turns out that a faulty cord on a Heating Pad was the real cause.
EPISODE 22: ""WHAT'S BUGGIN' HAZEL?"" - MR. EGAN finds some bugging equipment in his office and is worried that someone is stealing his business secrets. It's Hazel, to the rescue, as she help him to solve the mystery.
EPISODE 23: ""HAZEL'S DAY IN COURT"" - HAZEL goes to jail when she deliberately paints a crosswalk on a corner where it is badly needed. Then she meets ""Donald Burton"" a Newspaper Reporter, played by HUGH MARLOWE, who charms her about helping her. But then she soon finds out that ""Donald Burton"" wasn't very scrupulous. NOTE: HAZEL GETS A CALL FROM HER OLD ""BOYFRIEND MITCH"", BUT DECLINES HIS OFFER OF A DATE. ""MITCH BRADY"" DISAPPEARED AFTER THE 8TH EPISODE IN SEASON 2: ""THE SUNSHINE GIRLS QUARTET"".
EPISODE 24: ""HAZEL'S INQUISITIVE MIND"" - HAZEL tries to get the Houseman who works next door to become an honorary ""SUNSHINE GIRL"", while she tries to drum up some business for George. NOTE: THIS EPISODE IS THE LAST TIME ""MR. GRIFFIN"" APPEARED ON THIS SHOW.
EPISODE 25: ""GEORGE'S MAN FRIDAY"" - When Hazel gets an unwanted proposal from an undesireable, unsuitable man, she had to come up with a way to get rid of him.
EPISODE 26: ""THE INVESTOR"" - Hazel Nephew ""Leroy Burke"" played by WRIGHT KING, pays her back the money she spent to help put him through Law School. She then winds up with 2 jobs after she invest in a Bakery, owned by Mr. Mueller, played by JOHN BANNER, WHO WAS FAMOUS FOR HIS ROLE AS ""Sgt. Hans Georg Schultz"" on ""HOGAN'S HEROES"". She has to not only continue her work with ""THE BAXTERS"", but she has to work at the Bakery too. Though her ""second job"" didn't last long, she couldn't have done better than 100%. WOW! HOORAY FOR HAZEL! NOTE: THIS WAS THE LAST EPISODE IN WHICH ""MR. EGAN"" played by MAURICE MANSON APPEARS. MAURUCE APPEARED IN EVERY SEASON, EXCEPT SEASON 4. Interesting enough, he was the first of all of George's Clients to appear on HAZEL, on the EPISODE: ""HAZEL AND THE PLAYGROUND"", as ""Mr. Pruett"". And he was the ""LAST OF GEORGE'S CLIENTS"" to appear on the show, because ""GEORGE BAXTER"" GETS WRITTEN OUT OF THE SHOW.

DON DEFORE SAID THAT HE FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS LET GO FROM HAZEL'S FIFTH SEASON FROM THE ""TRADES PAPERS"". I DON'T KNOW HOW WHITNEY BLAKE FOUND OUT. IT'S A SHAME THAT THEY WERE TRADED IN BY YOUNGER PEOPLE: RAY FULMER AS ""STEVE BAXTER"" AND ""LYNN BORDEN"" AS BARBARA BAXTER. LYNN WAS CHOSEN BY SHIRLEY BOOTH TO PLAY ""BARBARA BAXTER."" I THINK IT'S RATHER SAD THAT THERE WASN'T ANY CLOSURE FOR GEORGE AND DOROTHY AT ALL.

In fact, though HAZEL had one more season, there wasn't any closure for any of the characters or storylines. So many went unfinished or underdeveloped. ""The Blakes"" disappeared from next door before Stan could find a suitable wife. We don't know if it was Eddy Burke whom Nancy married. Or even if Eddy and Nancy finished College. ""The College Subject"" never came up again. And of course, the most talked about disappearance from the show were George and Dorothy. I think the fans would have wanted to see them brought back and reunited with Harold. I CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE. AND WHAT ABOUT HAZEL?!. I would have wanted to see her finally find happiness. I still think that she and Barney, The Mailman, played by ROBERT B. WILLIAMS, would have been perfect for each other. If they had thought to bring back the BAXTER'S and close the show, I think it would have been time for Hazel to move on.

It's really sad to think that everytime I look at this show almost every one in it is gone. Time passes quickly, but somehow it doesn't seem like it's been just over 50 YEARS since Hazel was last produced, with the very last Episode airing on 4/11/1966. I wonder if a show like ""HAZEL"" would go over well today. They would have to update HAZEL'S language, though. No more ""Golly Mr. B's"", for example. It certainly would be better than anything that is put on television today.",1472601600,4,11494,4.671111111111111

There's no cursing, no sexual inuendos, just goodness, laughter, hearttouching moments and joy.

This dvd set arrived in A # 1 condition and on time.

My only issue is not with the dvd itself but with the prices on the older shows/movies....then you have to pay the higher shipping charges on top of it.  I can't order all of the time or a bunch at a time so I'm not able to take advantage of the free shipping.

5274249,5,B0096RC57O,"As a child, I remember loving this show, along with the other classics of the late 1950s and 1960s. Although too young to remember some of them, I was old enough to remember Hazel. The show revolves around the adventures of this extraordinary Housekeeper/Maid and her uncanny ability to always make things turn out right. The family consists of ""Mr. B"" the attorney and head of the family, although if truth be known, I always felt Hazel was the one in charge. Missy, George's wife, has known Hazel since she was a child and is the perfect complement to her husband. An interior decorator with excellent taste, she and Hazel have a very loving relationship and Missy can be counted on to run interference when Hazel and Mr. B butt heads. Then there is the adorable Harold, better known as ""Sport,"" who is such a sweet little boy who worships Hazel and considers her a hero. The acting is superb and the storylines are anything but sappy. This series proves that wholesome programs have a place in society and with it, there is always a valuable lesson to be learned. Kudos to Shirley Booth, Don DeFore, Whitney Blake and Bobby Buntrock for delivering a beautiful and entertaining story to the viewers in every episode. And while all of them are no longer with us, it is comforting that their brilliance is on record and the days when the simple things were the best can truly live on!",1386028800,10,1384,4.607287449392713

5274258,4,B0096RC57O,"Shout! Factory has become my favorite video distributor. They're not afraid to release titles of classic TV series that other distributors pass on. As a classic TV collector, I really appreciate them taking the rights for ""Hazel"" and ""Police Woman"" and running with it. They've been especially quick with their rapid-fire releases of Seasons 2, 3 and 4 of ""Hazel""...and for that, I can't thank them enough.

This DVD set does contain a bonus feature -- the original pre-production booklet pushed to potential sponsors for the program before its 1961 debut is contained on the 4th and final disc.

Others have given reviews for Season 4 and I can't really add much to what has been written. It was my impression, watching Season 4 unfold on my DVD player, that the series was well past its prime by the time Season 4 started. The first six episodes were quite weak...not what any series would want at the beginning of a new season, especially with tough time slot competition that included national phenomenon ""Peyton Place"".  I didn't really laugh a lot until I got to episode 7. ""Hazel"" did pick up steam as the season progressed but perhaps I had become accustomed to Hazel and her machinations during this season but it just didn't seem as good as the other seasons. That may be why NBC decided to cancel the series after this season; it had run its course and it was increasingly difficult to keep the series fresh. The inclusion of Harry Noll and his wife as semi-regulars was more annyoying than anything else; I'd have rather seen more of the Sunshine Girls and the Johnsons but those supporting characters have only occasional glimpses here. There IS more of Harvey Griffin and his blustery nature...which was a good thing.

That is not to say that Hazel, herself, had changed. She was still the hard-headed butt-insky that we all loved, getting herself into all sorts of messes. And some of the episodes were chucklers. Season 4, though, had more than its share of clunkers, especially early.

All of that being said...I'm glad I have Season 4 on DVD now and I give this season 4 stars...1 for Shout! Factory and three for the season itself. I hope we'll get to see the fifth season out soon.",1369440000,3,2201,4.706493506493507

Of course I always enjoy having ""extras"" on these DVD's and I am disappointed that it doesn't contain any commentaries from the actors .  (Considering all the major actors that starred this season have left us, I guess that's to be expected.)  And, even though the colours are washed out a bit it is still great entertainment.  The only thing that I find annoying is that any time I watch Hazel I always seem to get hungry!  (I would like to try some of those stuffed pork chops and not to mention a cookie jar that is always filled with fresh homemade cookies!)  I'm just sad that this is the last season with Don Defoe and Whitney Blake.  The chemistry between the four major actors is unbeatable.  A must purchase!",1363737600,6,817,4.466216216216216

As has been pointed out, these episodes aren't the most stellar of prints.  The good folks at Shout Factory had to make due with the best sources available (and they tell you so).. and as Kasey G. so appropriately commented, I too would rather have these than nothing at all.  It's a fun trip back in time..  for me, it's just a treat to watch these shows against the all too familiar sets... and Shirley Booth is Hazel !!  Hazel will always be a favorite.  Here's hoping that season five isn't too far away.

5274273,5,B0096RC57O,"We have all seasons now, except for the final season. HURRY with the final season!

There is one thing about these, and how Season 1 was made differently than Seasons 2-4. The encoding on the DVD on Season 1 tells our DVD Player it has reached the end of the DVD and our DVD player turns off after a timeout period.
On Seasons 2-4, this encoding isn't there and the DVD Player remains on, not turning off when it gets to the end. It only happens with Season 2-4, out of all the TV DVD shows we have. So hopefully Season 5 will be encoded, but its doubtful.

5274275,5,B0096RC57O,"Hazel was one of my favorite show when I was growing up. It's great that the first four seasons have now found their way to dvd thanks to Sony (1st season) and Shout Factory (seasons 2-4). The only thing that could've made this set any better would have been if Shout Factory had access to the original negatives to transfer from, maybe they don't exist. The quality on this season 4 set is really not that bad. A few of the episodes seemed to suffer from a bit of color fade and I believe one of the episodes may have been an edited down version, I'm not sure. One of the things I like best is that the original opening title sequences were used instead of that dreadful version seen in a lot of the old syndicated versions. If you like Hazel, I think you're going to like this season 4 set. I don't think we Hazel fans are ever going to see anything better.

Shout Factory's December 4, 2012 release of the DVD set of ""Hazel"" S4 is the latest example of Shout earning deity status among hard-core sofa spuds for releasing sets of previously abandoned shows every few months.

This classic '60s sitcom revolved around the titular character, who was a live-in maid/busybody for successful attorney George Baxter and his nuclear family. Plots typically involved either Hazel, who was played by legendary actress Shirley Booth, undermining ""Mr. B's"" authority, trying to manipulate him, or interfering in the lives of her friends and neighbors.

Much of the humor came from Hazel's common sense and street smarts succeeding where Mr. B's ""book learnin'"" failed.

The nice thing about the fourth season was that the overall friendly disputes between Hazel and Mr. B. had toned down significantly since the more rancorous, but highly entertaining, first season.

One episode had Hazel surprisingly obey Mr. B's order to only respond ""yes,"" ""no,"" or ""maybe"" if the visiting governor of their state asked her a question. Similarly, the Thanksgiving episode included a scene in which Hazel encouraged Mr. B. to eat a piece of pie in contrast to scenes from earlier seasons in which she vigorously and stubbornly denied him sweets.

Similarly, the well done Christmas episode had Hazel gently encouraging Mr. B. to buy his wife Dorothy a relatively inexpensive gift in response to his declared war on the commercial aspects of the holiday. First season Hazel would have likely charged an expensive gift to the Baxter account and shamed her employer into accepting that outcome.

On the other side, Mr. B. was less harsh regarding Hazel and seemed more sensitive to her feelings.

This ""kinder gentler"" tone helped make S4 very tasty television comfort food. Like a well-made macaroni-and-cheese, each episode satisfied without making an unduly strong impression.

These episodes also offer a nice reminder of the ""good old days"" when families seemed to get along better than they do now, people sat down for dinner together, neighborhoods were real communities, and people were not isolated in the forms of constantly being glued to their cell phones, iPods, iPads, or other electronic devices.

One of the better of a good lot of episodes had Hazel getting Mr. B. provide the family's wonderfully daffy and aristocratic neighbors badly needed financial planning. Mayhem regarding missing bearer bonds was very amusing.

Another especially good episode had Hazel and lady of the house Dorothy team up to convince Mr. B. to pay to have the kitchen remodeled. Their chosen technique was much more subtle than the (perhaps literal) sledgehammer approach that Hazel likely would have used in the first season.

Further, S4 Mr. B. was a very good sport. S1 Mr. B. likely would have drawn the line at buying a new toaster.

It is worth noting as well that this was the final season in which Hazel worked for George and Dorothy Baxter. Those unfamiliar with the show must wait until Shout releases S5 to learn of the new format.

Shout's extras for the S4 set are entertaining vintage promos for the series.",1353974400,12,3367,5.032374100719425
