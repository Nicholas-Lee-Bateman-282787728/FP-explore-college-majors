3544597,5,B001DZOCKU,"I am 59 years old and grew up in Nashville.  I discovered ""Route 66"" in the fall of 1960 and very quickly became addicted to the program.  I just read a synopsis of the episodes for the 1961-62 season.  My mind flashed back to the time I saw them on television.  ""Route 66"" was a superb program and quite realistic--to a point.  What makes me scratch my head in wonderment is the fact these two fellows were just run of the mill working stiffs yet each fall they would be driving a new Corvette.  I would guess there is no co-incidence one of the sponsors of ""Route 66"" was Chevrolet...  I am really glad the show has been put on DVD!  Brings me back to the days of my innocent youth...  As an aside, I was all set to watch ""Route 66"" on Friday, November 22,1963, but an event that took place in Dallas precluded that evening's program...

3544598,4,B001DZOCKU,I was a teenager when Todd and Buzz fill the airwaves with adventure and travel. For a young man living in rural Louisiana their show gave an escape to places far from my little town. The show aired on Friday evenings and I could not wait to view it. The release of this second season was delayed for some reason and I was concerned that it would not go to print. I can tell you that if you don't mind black and white television you are in for a real treat. The parade of stars for the episodes read like a who's who for future years in both television and the movies. This is classic 60s TV!,1224201600,9,592,4.068376068376068
3544599,5,B001DZOCKU,"The five-star rating is for the series itself, thanks in large part to the exceptionally realistic storylines from Stirling Silliphant and guest scriptwriters. The on-screen chemistry between Martin Milner as Tod Stiles and George Maharis as Buz Murdock is superb as they criss-cross America working odd jobs in search of themselves and helping others find their purpose in life. Great show from television's golden age. Highly recommended.

Roxbury Entertainment's mastering of the series to DVD remains to be seen.  Whether the series will be digitised to wide screen format -- as was the case in Season 1/Volume 2 - remains merely a guess.",1221609600,53,5132,4.657047724750277
3544600,5,B001DZOCKU,"This extremely well-written series was at its rip-roaring finest in season 2. As always, we get a unique and nostalgic authentic glimpse at specific American locales in the early 1960s, back when the country was prosperous, the economy was growing in bounds, and gas was CHEAP! Episodes 1, ""A Month of Sundays"", in which Buz falls head over heels for a dying young actress in Montana; 3, ""Good Night, Sweet Blues"", in which Tod and Buz are dispatched across the country to round up a sick elderly jazz singer's old band members for one last memorable performance; and 24, ""Even Stones Have Eyes"", in which Buz is accidentally blinded on a construction site and must attend a school for the blind in Texas where he falls in love with an actual blind girl, are some of the finest moments in the entire history of television.

Episodes were filmed in crisp black and white cinematography, on location in various states.  Episode 5 for example, features guest star Robert Redford in an early television role.  Episode 25 features wonderful character actor Harry Townes, Tuesday Weld, Cloris Leachman and Burt Reynolds.  Season two is truly television drama at its best.

3544620,5,B001DZOCKU,"""Route 66"" was a Top 30 hit in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/its-first-season/dp/B0088W1Z0Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">its first season</a>.  Tod Stiles (Martin Milner) and Buz Murdock (George Maharis) came back the next year to drive the country again in Tod's Corvette, and found danger, romance, and adventure while working odd jobs in places like Montana, Cleveland, Boston, Pennsylvania, Texas, Southern California, and elsewhere.  This DVD set contains all 32 episodes of Season Two that were originally broadcast on CBS from September 1961 to June 1962.

In these well-written, absorbing, and sometimes moving episodes, Tod and Buz deal with a wild horse, car theft, kidnapping, murder, death, strained family relationships, and rescuing those in danger, among other things--the two even see a jazz band and a rodeo along the way.  This season touched on some issues not widely discussed in early 1960s America such as drug addiction, mental illness, gangs, and disabilities.  The season finale looked at the state of gender relations in marriage, and would likely be nothing less than shocking to those who subscribe to today's commonly promulgated memes about pre-1965 America.

Society has of course changed for better and for worse in the half-century since these episodes aired, but those living in the early Sixties thought that their own society had changed greatly vis--vis their past--it was startling from the vantage point of 2014 to hear one character set in the JFK era talk about ""the days when a dollar was a dollar"" and another talk about being ""a prisoner of the bureaucracy.""

Quite a few notable guest stars appeared this season, including Anne Francis, Suzanne Pleshette, Robert Duvall, Robert Redford, Ed Asner, Al Lewis, Martin Sheen, Peter Graves, and Cloris Leachman.

Two other huge stars in ""Route 66"" are the scenery, which looks gorgeous even in black-and-white and in an era when the United States had many more wide-open spaces, and the old artifacts of a long-gone America--the viewer gets to see period cars, trucks, downtown areas, highways and highway signs, bridges, record players, hospitals, clothes, taverns, business signs, elevators, jails, airports, hotels, and newsrooms.  Texans especially will be shocked at how different Austin looked then.  Buz made a reference to ""timeless towns and lost roads,"" but from today's standpoint a lot of the roads that Tod and Buz traveled are long lost.

""Route 66"" was a hit adventure-drama not just because of the good stories and good writing, but because it aired in an era when the average person was much less wealthy and likely hadn't seen all that much of the country.  The series was filmed on location and provided a window into what other parts of the country were like, portraying cultural differences across regions, local customs, and ethnic subcultures.  One episode even included commercials that aired with the show, and the show's theme song is one of the best in television history.  This classic series would be enjoyed by anyone with an interest in good adventure and drama or in mid-century America.",1407110400,2,3151,5.365111561866126

3544629,5,B001DZOCKU,"I was thrilled to find ""Route 66 - Second Season"" in the Amazon lineup for a couple of reasons: First, ""Route 66"" was one of my favorite shows from the 60's, along with ""77 Sunset Strip"". Secondly, my late Father, William F. Brill was one of the actors in the episode ""Once To Every Man"", filmed in Gloucester Massachusetts. I skipped school to go up to the filming location with him and got to meet George Maharis (he asked me to hold his jacket while he filmed a scene from the episode and I didn't want to give it back to him) Martin Milner, ""Guest Star"" Janice Rule (and her Husband Ben Gazzara who wasn't in the show but was there with her) the Director Arthur Hiller and the rest of the cast.... For a 10 year old boy, this was the ULTIMATE experience of my life, up to that point.
  So, 50 years later, I ordered the Dvd from Amazon, put the disc into my player with ""Once to Every Man"" on it and watched the episode for the first time in 48 years... Seeing my Dad and the rest of the cast after all this time was kind of exciting and bittersweet at the same time. Being there to watch the filming of one of my favorite TV shows of the 60's was an experience I'll never forget.
  I've watched the complete ""Second Season"" set many times since. Great picture and sound quality! The writing and acting is light-years ahead of the garbage that passes as ""Dramatic - i.e. Reality"" television these days.
  ""Route 66"" was, and remains a great entertainment experience! And if you want to get away from ""Honey Boo Boo"" or ""America's Got Talent"" for awhile, this Dvd set is JUST what the Doctor ordered!",1372377600,4,1603,4.326666666666667

It is also interesting from a historical reason e.g. THE STARS smoke in just about every episode. A few of the episodes were humorous fluff but most of them were interesting dramas that are self contained stories and the only recurring theme is that Buzz and Todd are travelling around the good old USA a la Jack Kerouak's ON THE ROAD. They stop at a gas station and ask the attendant how to get to their NEW jobsite. There is usually a future FAMOUS star before they became well known (Martin Sheen, ED Asner, Ann Francis, Tuesday Weld, Burt Reynolds to name a few) A great trip down Memory Lane !!!",1310083200,,723,4.484848484848484
3544648,5,B001DZOCKU,"Season Two was released prior with altered music and a cropped screen. Why? Because the company didn't spend the time and money to go studio 35mm master transfers and ensure the quality. Also, using the alternative music meant avoiding paying music royalties. Sadly, a number of companies have been doing this over the past few years and yet EVERY time this happens, fans complain and with the internet, they complain BIG time. So why haven't the companies learned that they cannot insult the fans? Well, it seems Infinity heard the cries and like CBS, went back to the original masters and didn't use the syndicated (alternate) theme music. If you have been worried about reviews for prior ROUTE 66 TV DVD box sets, buy this one. It's the version (original version) and the one you want. Buy with confidence but buy directly from Amazon because a few sellers might not know the difference and make a mistake and sell you the prior set in it's place.

I was happily watching until I came across a bad sector in the final scenes of Blue Murder; I had to ship it back, and will re-order as soon as Amazon refunds my money.

3544650,4,B001DZOCKU,"I really enjoyed Route 66.  I was pretty young when the series first aired. I had remembered it but didn't remember much about specific episodes.  It was a great value for the money.  All the shows had good optical quality and were easy to view.  The writers took on some difficult subjects like mental illness, juvenile crime, and blindness that I doubt few other shows addressed then or have since then.  The scripts didn't reflect any of the racial prejudice or other stereotypes that one would think common during this era.  The dialog is excellent - even better than some shows today that rely more on special effects than language to get the story across.",1267574400,4,661,4.7043478260869565
3544651,3,B001DZOCKU,"I wasn't born yet when this show originally aired and I do recall it vaguely being in syndicated reruns when I was a young child. Since I am a fan of the old black and white TV shows and I heard that this program was truly a classic, I decided to rent it.  I wasn't dissapointed and neither will you.  The program follows the adventures of Tod Stiles (played by veteran actor Martin Milner) and Buzz Murdock (played by George Maharis)as they wander aimlessly across the USA along route 66 in their sporty Corvette.  Each episode tells a new story regarding who they come across in a new State (Nevada, Ohio etc..) and how their lives become intertwined for 60 minutes. The stories range from boring to very interesting to classic.  My favorite so far is the one when Tod has his drink accidentally spiked at a party and he starts to take on a wierd personality.  Another memorable one is when both Tod and Buzz volunteer to teach at a rural school.  I like the the fact this show is not filmed on a lot and you get to see the real locales of the places that Tod and Buzz visit.  i wish there were a few other locales like my homestate NJ.  You can't tell me Atlantic City would not be a great place to have a Route 66 story.

3544653,5,B001DZOCKU,"""How Much a Pound is Albatross?""

Stirling Sillipant wrote this episode and you can tell. He puts himself in this show throw the dialogue of Vicki (Julie Newmar) and Todd.

The first image is a lone cross on desert hilltop. That's the first clue to explain the girl we see on the motorcycle.

In Tucson, Arizona, Vicki smiles at the police officer who has a bored look on his face, and then she runs the stop light. The police follows and soon a gaggle of policemen swarm around her. Our heroes (Buzz and Todd) swerve to avoid run running her over and crash into a window.

""You knew we would catch you"" the police officer says. ""I feel sorry for you, nothing to listen to but code numbers and peoples troubles. You looked so bored"" the lady on the motorcycle responds. Her first meaning is that she felt sorry for the cops because they caught her and she's an Albatross and next she means she feels sorry for his hum drum life that probably will remain unexamined for years to come. Buzz is totally taken with her upon first sight. He knew exactly what she meant when she told the cops ""I feel sorry for you"".

They take her to the sheriff's office and he has interesting pictures behind him. The wall has a photo of what looks like a hanging from the not too old west of Tucson. The picture is juxtaposed with a photo of President Kennedy and what looks like a model rocket. The old with the new. The sheriff does not understand Vicki at all. He offers her a cigarette and she takes the cigarette and smokes it as if it's the first time she ever smoked. She replies that her name is Vicki and the sheriff says ""Vicki what"" and Vicki replies ""aint that the truth"". Telling you that she doesn't know who she is any more. Giving us the second clue to who she really is.

She's probably the first hippie character ever on TV. She has the beat nick style but she definitely is not beat nick. She's more interested in learning, discovering and sharing. She is not only looking inward she also looks outward and is just as grateful to share with others as to take from others.

She carries no papers. She says, ""they are snapshots of who we were not who we are. They are by default invalid"".

All men in the show who see her become smitten with her. The man who's window is smashed up seems to want nothing more than for her to smile at him as he smiles at her.

A shrink, Dr. Jane Bell, visits her in jail. No mess, no fuss, Vicki is just grateful to be alive. Her father and family had died from a boating accident, ""let grief ride outside on a motorcycle on its own, let it try and catch me, let it catch shadows of its own, I left a trail of buried Albatrosses from coast to coast"". Dr. Bell asks ""how much a pound is Albratross"" and Vicki responds ""nobody can afford it, so every day I grow lighter and greedier for life"".

Vicki in her leather motorcycle pants and nice top makes for lovely images alone. I fully understand why all men swarm around her.

Buzz wants to bail her out. He's still completely smitten with her as all the men around her seem to be. He places the 500 bucks bail for her. Vicki states ""I have no money. I've never been in jail before. The pattern has been that people in authority just banish me to the next place"". She has no worries about what will happen.

Todd puts up his Corvette as collateral for Vicki's bond for Buzz. Todd now has a vested interest in watching her.

Buzz buys her a dress for her court appearance and she takes 45 minutes to try it on. Todd asks Buzz ""do you know what Parataxic distortion (check Wickipedia's article, it is very good) is? He goes on to explain that it's all the people that we bring with us to every situation that we're in and how it can change how we perceive what's happening to us in the now. Also, the scene looks like it had brilliant product placement since Todd holds up his pack of Marlboro repeatedly. ""Vicki is in the bedroom and in our minds, so we already have four people with us. The calculating Buzz, the voodoo Todd and so on"". It must be noted Vicki comes out of the bedroom and looks even more like a girl as she herself says. She tells Buzz a Zen saying and later you see how Buzz doesn't understand it at all.

They decide to go dancing. Vicki regales the boys at the bar and a harmless drunk comes up to them. He realizes that she's a princess in spirit. Buzz is ticked off. The drunk's wife hates the drunk and he has nothing to show for his whole life with his wife. All he has to show for life is expensive cuff links and a wife that hates him. Buzz shoves the drunk on to the floor. Vicki sees the drunks pain and at that moment she really wants nothing to do with Buzz anymore.

Todd and Vicki go bike riding in the desert. They run out of gas and are completely lost. She is not bothered in the least. They will most likely be late for her court appointment. The sheriff comes looking for them and asks Buzz where are Todd and Vicki. Vicki has completely mastered the situation and environment as always. She knows exactly how much water they need, how to proceed and the pitfalls of the desert. She thoroughly enjoys the new situation and harsh environment for the newness of it all.

She tells Todd, ""suppose I were to be honest with you as I possibly could be, fooling you no more than I fool myself. Still, you wouldn't know me and I wouldn't know you, because no matter how much we cry for light, we are all sleepwalkers fumbling in the dark. Sometimes we manage to touch for a moment, than we pass"".

The judge admonishes her when they reach the courtroom. He blames her for all of societies wrongs. He represents the old established order. She represents the new changes that are coming. The first time we hear her whole name, Vicki Russel, is when the judge mentions it. He mentions that she is a sole heir to a large estate. He finds her incomprehensible and bizarre and inexcusable and he goes on and on and states dedication to non-conformity is anti-social. I saw her crimes (reckless driving, getting lost in the desert and missing her court appearance) as fairly trivial. The judge goes way beyond her actual crimes and because she is rich she has even more responsibility the judge states. She tells the judge that she is rich because of the love her parents gave her. He tells her ""if everyone did what they wanted society couldn't function"". (Using his logic, I guess we all can't be judges, because who would be the defendant)? As predicted by her earlier, the person in authority suspends her sentence and banishes her to the next county. Our heroes drive with her and bid her farewell together. She appears in another episode. I can hardly wait to watch it!",1254873600,,6676,4.336538461538462
3544654,4,B001DZOCKU,"Looking back at these season two episodes, it's the characters and the car I most enjoy.  Tod Stiles (as played by Martin Milner) was a real role model for me - smart, well-dressed, well-spoken, honest and clever.  He had a way about him of being able to size up situations and usually get an accurate read on them.  Buz was a better guy than I gave him credit for but the friendship between them is a healthy one.

And ah, the Corvette - it still looks better than most any sports car ever made.  Love watching the car move and hearing that Nelson Riddle theme music played over and over again.  That never gets old for me.

I was a kid when these shows first aired but the premise of traveling the country in a sharp car left a strong impression in my mind.  The impression was so strong that after getting out of college and working full time for three years, I did a solo 7500 mile cross country trip in my own new car - a Dodge Challenger.

The stories are pretty dramatic and the characters seem a little overplayed but watching these old shows is a  look back at America and how it was in the early 1960s.  The language is dated by trying to be very hip and having used all the vernacular of the time - especially from Buz.

---
Technically, the quality of the DVDs is somewhat uneven. Video is quite good but there are momentary dropouts of the audio in each of the 6 episodes I watched so far.  The last show I saw had a title card left in that read ""BILLBOARD - COMMERCIAL"".

As you can see in this amazon ad, the cover art on the box is noticeably flipped left to right so that Tod and Buz's whole faces are like looking in a mirror with their hair parts switched from the left to right side of their heads.  It's a small point but indicative of the lack of overall attention given to detail in packaging these shows.

Overall, a DVD set worth buying that makes you feel young again, yet older and wiser - all at the same time.",1248912000,6,1938,4.197297297297298

3544658,5,B001DZOCKU,"What a bittersweet pleasure to have ""Route 66"" available at last -- a pleasure because of the show's extraordinary quality, and bittersweet because you just won't see a show like this on TV today. It's very much a product of its time, capturing a unique period in American history, just between the Beats & what became the 60s ... a time when literate, often deeply personal writing could be found on a weekly TV show.

And what a show! Something of an existentialist anthology, it gave us Tod & Buz, two friends with opposite personalities, united by their need to explore, experience, and learn. In fact, the show was originally going to be called ""The Searchers,"" but the classic John Wayne film of the same name had been released just a couple of years before, necessitating the change to ""Route 66."" And while the show seldom travels down that actual road, it doesn't matter, because it's the spirit of the road, its essence, that they follow.

The series was in top form during this second season, with all the elements firmly in place: strong leads in Martin Milner & George Maharis; evocative location shooting that brought the full scope of America into clear view; a guest cast of nearly every up-&-coming major American actor; and writer Stirling Sillipant's intelligent, poetic scripts.

I want to focus on the writing. It's been said that real people don't talk like that, with so much philosophy & literary allusion. And that's probably true, especially today -- although it wasn't entirely unknown in the early 1960s. Some younger viewers accustomed to what modern entertainment calls ""realism"" may have trouble adjusting to this richer, slightly artificial style, more like that of a playwright than an ""average"" person.

Well, it's an adjustment worth making. TV once reveled in the power of language & symbolic dialogue, and it was exceptionally well done on ""Route 66."" If it strays from literal realism, it excels in emotional & psychological realism. Quality TV back then had a strong allegorical component, and most viewers had no trouble accepting & responding to it. ""Route 66"" was only too happy to delve into Big Questions -- even better, it did so thoughtfully, while never failing to provide plenty of entertainment.

While even the occasional so-so episode is still good, you'll find some especially moving stories in this second season. My own favorites: ""How Much a Pound is Albatross?"" with Julie Newmar as a free spirit haunted by personal tragedy; ""A City of Wheels,"" set in a hospital for disabled veterans, examining one unsparing in his bitterness & despair; ""To Walk With the Serpent,"" a frighteningly timely examination of the right-wing mentality; ""Love is a Skinny Kid,"" with a kabuki-masked young woman arriving in a small Texas town & stirring up buried ghosts; ""There I Am - There I Always Am,"" with Buz struggling to save a young woman whose foot is caught in the rocks on a beach, with high tide coming in; ""The Thin White Line,"" which finds Tod on a hellish, drug-crazed odyssey through a city at night, after his drink is spiked with an experimental hallucinogen. But each viewer will have his or her own favorites.

What strikes me is the intense & wide-open emotional lives of the two leads. It's a mixture of the traditional model of American manhood -- strong, self-reliant, a little old-fashioned in the best sense of the phrase -- and a questioning, sensitive modernity, which allows them to sob or cry out in anguish when the situation demands. They experience their emotions deeply, at the very core of their being, but they're never paralyzed by them. They question, they argue, they act when necessary ... and they often learn something because of it.

As a window into an earlier mode of life, a more optimistic worldview, a pre-Starbucks/Wal-Mart/shopping mall America, it's invaluable. And for a TV show that's closing in on 50 years now -- half a century! -- so much of it still rings true. The fashion & slang may change, but those Big Questions remain the same for every new generation. Most highly recommended!",1236729600,19,4075,4.897101449275362

3544662,5,B001DZOCKU,"I was young, but my Friday nights consisted of watching ""The Blue Angels"", Route 66, and ""The Twilight Zone"".  Boy, those were some days.

I didn't really get all the adult themes of Route 66 in those days, but I couldn't wait to see that car on tv each week, hear that theme song, and just think of those two guys driving all over the country with their luggage strapped on the back.  For me, that probably equated to living the life of a pirate for boys a few generations earlier.

When Route 66 was on the air, that was the exact time the very first new freeway was being blazed through the center of the city and I still have images of the enormity of that project when we would pass by.  Those were the days were the contruction area torches were actual lit fires in smudge pots rather than blinking battery-driven warning lights.

It all seems a lifetime ago and as I was watching this new Route 66 set, I was taken right back there in glorious black and white.  Those little towns they keep hitting and every so often, the construction areas they pass by look exactly like the freeway project I remember as a kid.  And many of the stories are right up there with themes that could be from now.  Some things never change.

This is a great show and the dvd quality is perfect for me.  More than ever, this show seems to bridge the gap from ancient times to the modern computer and space age.  It was right there at the moments of that show, that the entire world was transforming.

By the way, does anyone know this? ...  there is an episode that was in the third season (I believe called ""King' something or other) that was never shown because it would have aired on the day Kennedy was assassinated.  Has that episode ever been seen?  Will it be on the third season set that is on the way?",1232841600,3,1796,4.28486646884273
3544663,4,B001DZOCKU,"In this season, there was less of the gratuitous punch-throwing melodrama of the first season, and more thought-provoking drama and character insight.  It truly was a splendid season for the show.  Cast and crew were at the top of their form, and the guest stars were probably the best of the entire run of the series.

HURRAH to Roxbury Entertainment for releasing the entire season in one package!  (Not-so-hurrah for apparently going back to the one-volume-at-a-time way for the upcoming Season 3, however.)  And HURRAH for abandoning the phony letterboxing of the earlier attempt at Season 2!  The show was shot and broadcast in 4:3 aspect ratio, that's how the scenes were originally composed, and that's still how it looks best.

And yet, there are technical shortcomings on these DVDs--especially, flaws that were not present in the original film medium--and it is hard to comprehend why they are present; it's not as if DVD mastering is still a poorly understood art.  Not just a few, but MANY scene changes are accompanied by inexplicable breaks in both video and audio.  Audio levels are poorly managed; entire episodes require cranking up the volume control, while yet another requires a quick downward adjustment and apologies afterward to the neighbors.

The packaging is a puzzlement as well.  The complete Season 1 set gave us the air dates of each episode, but not a clue where they were filmed.  Season 2 gives us the locations, but leaves the broadcast dates a mystery.  Although this is a secondary issue and does not detract appreciably from the joy of watching this great series once again, having both types of information available at the same time would be a plus.  And speaking of information, the ""cast bios"" special features would be far more informative if they did include a little actual biographical information--not merely the names of other shows in which the person appeared.

Overall, a good set that I'm glad to have in my collection; but it could have been great with just a little more attention to detail.",1229558400,6,2044,4.935672514619883

Todd and Buzz where the epitomy of cool, and the fact that, much like Richard Kimble in the Fugitive, they helped people with life problems from town to town, state to state was riveting and endearing. They do not make shows like this anymore, nor is there a want for them. It is a shame. Yes, there was Highway to Heaven and Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman recently, but this show, along with the Fugitive, showed the human and emotional side to the caring American spirit that is sadly, vanishing right before our very eyes.",1228953600,7,921,4.3604651162790695
3544665,5,B001DZOCKU,"Kudos to the people at Infinity for the release of this fine treatise of American entertainment.  I love the film prints and audio qualities which comprise this product.  I have viewed all of the Season 2 episodes and I remain impressed with the story lines and the world famous guest stars who appear.  This season is the true strength of the series.  George Maharis had just hit his stride with the Buz character and he and Milner had great chemistry.  Maharis earned an Emmy nomination this season for his intense, charismatic performances.  The most compelling episodes of the series are contained in Season 2.  Among them are A Month Of Sundays, Goodnight Sweet Blues, Birdcage On My Foot, The Mud Nest, The Thin White Line, A City Of Wheels, Aren't You Surprised To See Me?, and Even Stones Have Eyes. George Maharis was conspicuously absent on disc 8, episodes 59-62, due to a bout with hepatitis.  Martin Milner went solo, pausing at times to ""place a call to Buz"" in Santa Monica Hospital.  The episodes were not as strong during this time, which might have led some of the Nielsens to believe that the series had lost its steam.  More to the point, the only thing the series was missing was its ""Buzz"".  Overall, the writing was great, though at times a bit poetry laden.  There are fewer original commercials in this Second Season package than there were in the First Season.  But DON'T let that stop you!  The Second Season is finally on DVD and rightfully so.  It's been a long time coming now and the show still does not get it's due.  In my mind, Route 66 might be among the top 10-15 dramas in TV history.",1228176000,6,1621,4.557093425605537

Which brings us to this full season 2 release . . . . . Infinity has finally delivered a set that most fans of the series will be happy to own.  No, the visuals don't have that eye-popping, razor-sharp ""CBS/Paramount sheen"" found on vintage television releases like ""The Fugitive"" or ""The Untouchables,"" but they're quite good, in the correct full-screen aspect ratio and, unlike some CBS/Paramount releases, the original music is all here . . . . . no modern synthesized replacement music on this release, thank you very much!  Can anyone imagine watching ""Route 66"" without Nelson Riddle's memorable theme and orchestrations?

""Route 66"" is one of television's all-time great dramatic series and season 2 finds protagonists Tod Stiles (Martin Milner) and Buz Murdock (George Maharis) continuing their cross-country road adventures in a wide variety of early 1960s locales.  The guest star list for season 2 is impressive, including the likes of James Caan, Robert Duvall, Anne Francis, Peter Graves, DeForest Kelley, Lee Marvin, Suzanne Pleshette, Robert Redford, Marion Ross, Martin Sheen, Jack Warden, Ethel Waters and Tuesday Weld, among others.  Infinity sticks to the same formula for extras used for the season 1 releases with the inclusion of vintage 1960s commercials (limited this time to a single episode ""You Never Had It So Good"") and short clip profiles for each episode's guest stars.  However, one does wonder as to whatever happened to the George Maharis episode commentaries that were reported by ROUTE 66 NEWS in early 2008 to have been supposedly recorded, but have yet to surface on any of the ""Route 66"" season releases to date.

A public thanks is in order to Infinity Entertainment (the DVD releasing company) and Roxbury Entertainment (the series' rights owner) for actually listening to their customers and delivering a season 2 release that is befitting a series of this high caliber.  While, perhaps, the extra features could have been a bit better, the episodes in this season 2 DVD release look very good and the mistakes of the past split season 1 releases have been corrected.  Here's hoping that Infinity/Roxbury will release the remaining two seasons; I'll pre-order on the day that they are announced.",1226534400,29,3382,6.054393305439331

8295699,3,B001DZOCKU,"The following is in reference to the false flag scene in the episode, To Walk with the Serpent.  In a nutshell, a psychopath who makes skin tone his idol arranges a false flag as a way to act out (communicate) his frustration over not coming to terms with not having had the chance to pass through the Oedipal phase of development, and as a result is stuck with an unconscious ""Oedipal complex.""  ""Not all momma's boys are fascists but all fascists are momma's boys."" (Alice Miller)

We are told that it's his pain which fuels his hate that has turned him into a hate monger (agent of hate) and has given him an identity, that lies at the root of his actions.  The following is an attempt to add to this.

A professor from Minnoesta, Charles Andrew Peterson, wrote an interesting article that describes two basic types of family systems: Oedipal and Odyessan.  In the former type, there's constant jealousy and rivalry between family members, a classical dysfunctional family where parents are the children and the actual children suffer as a result.  In the latter, not only is the father not resentful or jealous of his son but he also protects him and supports his advancement (not as a magic gesture, but out of generativity). Such a father doesn't hurt others, but rather protects and builds.  Peterson writes, in the context of his article:

 Oedipal: Within the Oedipus myth, conflict, murder and incest are the norm for the family. We witness an inevitable hostility between the generations (Lederer, 1967, p. 52). Generations are full of pathology. Rivalry and competition rule. War is inevitable. Sacrifice is absolute, automatic, unconditional. Blum (1997) points out that Laius sends children to war to avoid relinquishing power (cf. Frey-Wehrlin, 1992, p. 180). It is me or you, father against son. Mother is seductive and regressive. Father is aloof, threatened and threatening, disloyal. The patriarchy is terrible. Murder is primary, not reactive/protective. Laius and Oedipus are locked in inevitable, mortal conflict. It is not clear Laius loves his son. The father wants to kill the son. The son wants to kill the father. However, whose wish was primary is not in; it was Laius who first injured Oedipus, cruelly drilling holes in his ankles, before abandoning him to his fate in the wild.

 Odyssean: Odysseus, his father Laertes and his son Telemachus relate to each other in ways unimaginable to ... Oedipus, Laius and Freud. For Odysseus, the next generation is a joyous extension of the self (Kohut, 1982, p. 404). It is clear that Laertes, Odysseus and Telemechaus love each other.  Affiliation and continuity color the generations. The father provides support for the next generation. Father is protective, not murderous. Sacrifice is relative, conditional, if the terms are right. Odysseus will put his own life in peril to save his son. Murder is replaced by nurture. Children are precious.  Their exertions are a source of pride, amazement, joy. The patriarchy and the matriarchy share. Father and son work together. It is me and you, father and son. Odysseus and Telemachus fight shoulder to shoulder. The childs emerging powers are welcomed, not extinguished in fear and competition.

(International Journal of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies, Feb 2014, pg 44)

Peterson provides additional examples from literature, and song lyrics of these two types.  The man who performs the false flag in the TV show clearly belongs to the first type.

Peterson says that literature teaches us that humanity's path is to learn from the pain of Oedipus to become Odysseus and generative.

8295700,4,B001DZOCKU,"To be fair, this Herbert B. Leonard (of ""Naked City"" fame) series was no television masterpiece but remains as one of those iconic, fondly remembered shows of the early sixties.  I particularly liked this David Bianculli description in his book ""Dictionary of Teleliteracy"": ""Like the 1961 Corvette around which this series revolved, ""Route 66"" embodied male adolescent fantasies in almost undiluted form.  Cool car.  No job.  Just a good buddy, an open road, and women and adventures down the road to nowhere.""
Mind you Tod and Buzz were no bums as they always landed work wherever they parked the Corvette and were always clean cut with neat clothes when they encountered local intrigue including some quite bizarre, and plenty of romantic situations.
The terrific location shooting (usually shot by old Republic Pictures stalwart Jack Marta), very rarely filmed on the actual Route 66, made up for a few dud and sometimes improbable storylines.  Always fascinating to look back at cities and towns as seen more than fifty years ago.
Generally though, the Season Two episodes were mainly of a high standard and were always boosted by the presence of well cast guest stars and reliable character actors, to support the two likable regulars: Martin Milner as the blond, freckle faced Ivy Leaguer Tod Stiles and George Maharis, usually stealing every scene, as the dark, sultry ""raised in Hell's Kitchen"" , Buzz Murdock.
Some of the great guest stars included: Anne Francis, Ed Asner, Emmy-nominated Ethel Waters, Robert Duvall, Lee Marvin, Robert Redford (who just missed being cast as Tod), Nehemiah Persoff, Dan O'Herlihy, Janice Rule, Keenan Wynn, Albert Salmi, Julie Newmar, Pat Hingle, Beulah Bondi, Betty Field, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., David Wayne, Bethel Leslie, Inger Stevens and Martin Sheen.
Nearly two-thirds of the episodes were penned by the prolific  (and co-creator with Leonard) Stirling Silliphant who seems to have spent more than the allotted  twenty-fours a day, scripting endless television episodes and films, including his Oscar winning screenplay for ""In the Heat of the Night"".
David Lowell Rich directed 11 of the 32 episodes in this batch with Arthur Hiller and James Sheldon, helming five each, and among the other directors, Sam Peckinpah and Robert Altman!
