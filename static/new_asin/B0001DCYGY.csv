8010425,4,B0001DCYGY,"I don't remember how I came across this movie, but I remember it and seen it on Amazon. I had to order it and add it to my collection. This movie is in German with English subtitles. It's a story about a girl who meets a handsome man with dark secrets. The story goes on to tell about the girl finally meeting the guy of her dreams, but as she learns more and more about him, she puts herself in danger. The guy has some really messed up issues, and well the movie tells it best. The acting was pretty decent, and it kept me interested throughout the whole time.",1363996800,,562,4.118181818181818
8010426,4,B0001DCYGY,"This movies in Dutch with English sub titles.  It's a pretty good story--despite some improbable events and Eva who must be one of the most naive women alive. (Dieter is caught on tape at the ""suicide"" scene--and later her friend is killed only a short distance from Dieters yacht--but Eva somehow doesn't put these two events together)  One of the unlikely events-is the accidental videotaping of not only a car break in--but a suicide/murder--in a matter of just a few minutes.  There's a bit of violence and more nudity than was probably necessary--though nowhere near pornographic.

A patient is murdered in a faked car accident/ the girls (Patti and Eva) are later videotaping and catch the two previously mentioned events, the car thieves attempt to steal the incriminating video tape--and Dieter comes to their rescue.

Dieter and Eva soon become romantically involved--but things aren't quite the way they seem.

You know Dieter isn't quite right--but the movie keeps you in a fair amount of suspense about him and ""mother""

Pretty interesting story--though I haven't seen a lot of Dutch movies--after this and ""The Vanishing""--I have to think the Dutch have some innate fear of being buried alive!  It may not be one of the all time greats--but the movie will keep you interested and entertained!",1125964800,4,1305,5.037209302325581
8010427,2,B0001DCYGY,"This is not the popular TV show, despite Amazon's linking it with DVD box sets of the series, etc.  In this film two friends, Eva (Hilde De Baedermaeker) and Patti (Veerle Dobbelaere), are at the wrong place at the wrong time when they capture the suicide of a girl on videotape.  Be sure you know what you're buying.",1097107200,61,317,4.448275862068965
