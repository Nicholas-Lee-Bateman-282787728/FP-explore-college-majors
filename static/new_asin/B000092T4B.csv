7988610,2,B000092T4B,"i can't believe the companies can get away with advertising movies as uncut with their running times only to get the dvd and realize it's cut.
don't get me wrong, i love these movies, but i already had them and i only got this double dvd because slumber party II was supposed to be uncut.
it says right on the back of the dvd that the running time is 90 minutes, but when you check the movie out it's STILL 75 minutes!
this has happened before with other movies and i'm sick and tired of it!
it's plain out LYING to get people to pay out big bucks for these dvd's when they think they're getting something they aren't !

that's all i gotta say :')",1307145600,3,647,4.134920634920635
7988611,5,B000092T4B,"Slumber party massacre is a must have. quite possibly the best 80's slasher ever made. perfect in almost every way.(slumber party 2 pretty much picks up where slumber 1 leaves off but takes a slightly diffrerent approach-although it's  convenient to have them both on the same disc). you know when your watching one of those off-beat weird old-school movies but can't take your eyes off the screen, and are completely absorbed, can't explain why but love every minute of it. this is one of those movies......go ahead indulge!",1240790400,2,525,4.965909090909091
