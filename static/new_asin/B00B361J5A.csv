8561922,4,B00B361J5A,"While checking out where to buy Fire of Conscience, a film I'd watched a number of times on Netflix and wanted for myself, I came across it for about $10, but then also came across the film in this collection with two other films: Clash and Life Without Principle.

Fire of Conscience is a well written and directed crime thriller with Leon Lai and Richie Ren. Plots twists and exciting action make for a 5 star movie and I highly recommend it for Chinese Hong Kong variety fans. The acting is very good, the plot is intriguing and suspenseful and the ending quite colorful, and bloody.

Life without Principle I had hopes for because it stars Richie Ren and Ching Wan Lau (make sure you see him in RUnning Out of Time, and Mad Detective), directed by Johnny To who I am a big fan of To (Vengenace my favorite of his), but this meandering slow drama which does have some interesting moments but overall I found it boring and not worth keeping.

Clash is a martial arts crime movie starring Johhny Tri Nguyen and Ngo Thanh Van. A group of criminals gathered for the first time together (you do get the different types of criminal behavior dynamic) to steal a briefcase, contents unknown. But things go awry and the villain in the movie is a nasty piece of business. I didn't think the crime particularly clever nor the acting particularly well done. I didn't care for the overt violence and internal conflicts of the gang. Ultimately for me, this  movie was also discarded.

So I am left with Fire of Conscience and not any worse off financially for having looked at the other movies.",1382486400,,1583,4.540350877192982
