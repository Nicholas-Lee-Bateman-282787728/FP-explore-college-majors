8628387,3,B00GXG5668,"Evil come, Evil go, was exactly as the old original one with a better picture, and color (99% soft core). The second move ( Oh you beautiful doll) has so much cuts from the original that they lost the movie story, and it was worth nothing. The third movie has sex including gay sex, which turns anyone off, and the picture was not clear at all. I expect that they will remaster the second movie and bring back the cut parts, but they did not.",1419724800,2,442,4.211764705882353

  Cleo O. is certainly no Babe, But as movie progressed found myself warming to her charactor
  Could have had more blood content. At the most an amusing movie  < 3 Stars >

 Oh You Beautiful Doll.
  What can I say? a mish mash series of events, could not wait for movie to end, One hour of my life wasted.

  Widow Blue.
  From the start movie left bad tast  I am certainly no prude, I enjoy a good F- - K movie with a story
  < no substitute for real thing > But why oh why, was the homosexual scene so long & graphic? It did nothing for the movie
  Even wife cringed & left the room. I stayed with it till end, but found that one scene for us very sickning.
  Will not be watching again.  < 3 Stars >
