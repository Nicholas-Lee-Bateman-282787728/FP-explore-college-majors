8631402,4,B00HASHXFU,"You probably have not heard of this film; Dreyer actually withdrew it after it was released because he thought the two actors were not good enough. While it is stylized in its presentation, almost like Kabuki theater, I think the actors depict it well. The story is one that is based on coincidences and sudden revelations that are nearly eye-rolling in their convenience; until one realizes that is what the film is about. Murder, deception, suicide, and love are all used like chess pieces. I think it's a lost treasure that rounds out the later work that Dreyer did in Danish cinema, and shouldn't be dismissed.",1444003200,,614,4.80188679245283
