957858,3,6305071594,I thought the video was pretty good but I think the director and editor (George Martin?) must be in love with the tamborine player. He's in more shot the all the performers combined. What a distraction!,940809600,2,202,4.638888888888889
957859,5,6305071594,"I loved this.  Even though these fantastic musicians are in the twighlight of their careers their music is as young and vivrant as it must have been when first written.  Brothers in arms, Hey Jude, Yesterday...Great songs.  These are the Beethovens of the twentieth century and will be remembered  that way.  Fantastic......",934761600,2,324,5.153846153846154
957860,3,6305071594,"I enjoyed watching this video but had a couple of complaints.
- The sound at times seemed to come and go. One minute it was clear and loud, the next it was soft and garbled.
- Since this was filmed in London it was  awfully Anglo-centric. I understand that, but why only one song from Jimmy  Buffett? If anyone can capture the spirit of the Islands, it is  Buffett.
- Who is the idiot playing the tambourine? We sure could have  used less footage of him.
Overall this is a good DVD, especially if you  are a fan of McCartney, Clapton, Collins and Sting. If you are a Jimmy  Buffett fan looking to add to your collection beware: the price may not be  worth the admission,",934502400,6,670,4.26984126984127

958000,5,6305071594,"This terrific 1997 concert, complete with a cadre of British rock aristocracy, was put together by producer extraordinaire, Sir George Martin.  A couple years earlier the huge, long dormant volcano on the Caribbean island, exploded, destroying much of the island nation.  Many, including most on this concert bill, had recorded there in years past.  A couple of Americans (Carl Perkins, Jimmy Buffett) sing a tune but this show is a wowser for the Brits.

Phil Collins takes the lead and acts as a co-host.  He also shows up on drums for most of the performances shown on the DVD.  While I liked everything, my favorite numbers were by former Dire Straits leader Mark Knopfler, Elton John, Eric Clapton and Paul McCartney.  John does one of my favorites in ""Your Song,"" perhaps his earliest hit.  ""Live Like Horses"" is another song he does well.  When I first saw this concert, I had never heard it before.  Clapton is at his blues belting best, especially on ""Same Old Blues"" with help from Collins, Knopfler, piano man Jools Holland and entertaining percussionist, Ray Cooper.  McCartney looks like he's 25 and does a great job in his closing numbers which includes everybody on ""Hey Jude"" and ""Kansas City.""

If there is a quibble it might be that the songs are all very familiar.  But let's face it, this is what the audience wanted to here.  The concert, filmed at famed Royal Albert Hall in London is one of the earliest DVDs and has some quirks.  This version doesn't seem to have a top menu.  Load it up and off it goes.  Dolby Digital 5.1 is the only surround option on this disc, but it is very good.  The picture has an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 but looks pretty good.  The concert has aged gracefully, like most of the performers.",1376611200,,1739,4.642622950819672
958001,5,6305071594,"This video was fantastic. Great audio and video effects. Great line-up of talented artists.
Amazing to watch Knopfler, Sting, Phil Collins, and Eric Clapton all playing and singing together.
I bought it because I am a huge Mark Knopfler fan, but I totally enjoyed all the artists on this video.
It is a ""must have"" for all music lovers.",1373846400,,336,4.711864406779661

958004,5,6305071594,"I'm a fan of Phil Collins especially when he had hair and when in concert.  He really gives his all and I also like when the ""guests"" on other artists' records or concerts like he did on Money for Nothing which also had Eric Clapton and Sting.  Until I saw this video I never knew Sting had been a part of the original though I always thought it was him.  Way cool.",1368057600,,365,4.041666666666667

958006,4,6305071594,This fundraising concert has the most amazing collection of artists you would hope to see in any concert.  I saw a more recent documentary about the career of Sir George Martin that actually showed his Air Studios in their derelict state in Montserrat today after the cyclone all those years ago.  Such a pity given the historic music that was produced there.,1361577600,,359,4.774193548387097

I was 18 when the Beatles hit the US and this is without a doubt the closest I've ever come to seeing the Beatles live.  Golden Slumbers, Yesterday and Hey Jude were incredible.  But 14 of the 18 songs are terrific...",1327536000,,340,4.265625
958069,5,6305071594,"Music for Montserrat is an exceptional DVD.  Every artist, Eric Clapton, Paul Mc Cartney, Elton John, just to name a few are wonderful and the sound is amazing.  A great addition to anyone's DVD collection.",1325635200,,206,4.857142857142857
958070,5,6305071594,"I recently watched this at a friend's house. He has an excellent surround sound setup and this DVD has DTS. amazing.
as a habit I don't like live concert video - rarely buy them.

the guest artists are phenomenal - Paul McCartney at the end is lots of fun/great songs.

How many times are you going to see Clapton and Knopfler playing together, filmed well and in DTS?

you just can't go wrong with this DVD.",1324512000,,408,4.342105263157895
958071,5,6305071594,"I have a $20,000 stereo with DTS, SACD 3100 watts. This is far and away one of the best content, musicians, songs etc... that I own. The sound quality is a 4 out of 5 but the songs and musicians more than make up for it. A definite must for any audiophile.",1323388800,,256,3.9423076923076925

958073,5,6305071594,"I own nearly 100 different live concert DVD's and this one is the best by far.  My favorite track is Mark Knofler's ""Brothers in Arms"" which is simply jaw dropping; an incredibly haunting and moving performance accompanied perfectly by the full orchestra.  Eric Clapton and Elton John also bring the house down with staggeringly good performances, and later on its just a full on jam with some of the world's premier musical artists.  What a night of music!

Word of advice: ONLY BUY the DTS version of the DVD...it makes a MASSIVE difference in the quality of sound - you won't regret it.

Enjoy.",1298764800,,597,4.701923076923077
958074,5,6305071594,"I have a pretty decent collection of concert DVDs. This is easily one of the best. For me the highlights are Brothers in arms, Same old blues, Jey jude, and Kansas city. Easily the best renderings of Brothers in Arms and Same old blues that I have heard. I do not know how many times I have listened to this DVD, its just an amazing experience every time.",1297468800,,355,4.235294117647059
958075,5,6305071594,"I first viewed a portion of this event on Youtube and liked it enough to look for the entire event. That event is Music for Montserrat, an event staged for the intent of generating aid for the Volcano stricken island of Montserrat. It deals with several musicians including Elton John, Sting, Eric Clapton and Mark Knopfler who each do from two to four songs and the others accompany them during the performance. My favorite bits were Mark Knopflers Brothers in Arms and Money for Nothing with Phil Collins on Drums, Eric Clapton and Knopfler on Guitar and Sting doing backup vocals.
 All in all a worthwhile DvD. I enjoyed it immensely.",1294963200,,637,4.738738738738738
958076,5,6305071594,"I really enjoyed this concert. Sting, Collins, Clapton, Knopfler, Elton and McCartney are great together. They just missed
one little great guy, Midge Ure (ULTRAVOX) is there playing the guitar at the end, but where is his performance? I wish they
had included his performance that night on this DVD. One of the creators of LIVE AID with Mr. Geldof. Would have been a 110% great!!!",1288742400,,381,4.787878787878788
958077,5,6305071594,Okay some reviews say this DVD has bad sound quality.  All I can say is you need a better sound system.  This DVD is incredible for the talent and the audio.  The video is a little rough in places but I've wowed many a guest with this DVD.  Try it you'll be glad you did!,1260316800,,271,3.8727272727272726
958078,5,6305071594,"I almost sent this item back because the sound was so uneven going back and forth between loud and soft for no reason.  luckily I ran across a comment by someone who mentioned you had to use 5.1 or DTS in the sound setup to get it to work right.  Sure enough, Doby sounds awful, but when I selected 5.1 the sound was perfect.  After that I enjoyed a really great concert with some excellent cuts from Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler-Dire Straits, Sting, Paul McCartney and many others.  Brothers in Arms, Money for Nothing, Layla, Hey Jude and a great rendition of Kansas City with everyone joining in.  If you think you might like this DVD you will, so buy it, just be sure you use 5.1 or DTS!",1255219200,,690,4.317829457364341

958110,3,6305071594,I wanted to see Sting and Dire Straights so that is the best of this dvd for me.  a good buzz at the concert too.,1247529600,,113,3.52
958111,4,6305071594,"Well here it is some 12 years after the event and I've only just found out about this amazing little concert, I only discovered about it because I came across Mark Knopfler singing ""Brother in Arms"" on You Tube, this version gave me goose bumps being supported by the The Foundation Philharmonic Orchestra!!...oh what a wonderful sound met by Knopfler's unique guitar style, but then I discovered this was only one part of a much bigger get together, so thanks again to Amazon.com I found a copy and promptly purchased it, excellent vision and the sound, well lets see, I have read elsewhere that the sound is a bit dodgy, yes it was and I was immediately disappointed, however the DVD gives you the option of three sound formats, Dolby Stereo, Dolby 5.1 Surround and DTS Surround, well in Dolby Stereo the sound brakes up badly, select Dolby 5.1 and it is %98 percent perfect and DTS was even better, every instrument was well mic'ed, mixed and recorded, the grand piano just sounded fantastic when Elton was on, the percussion the sound of the Kick Drum was just right through to Ray Cooper on the Tambourine and boy wasn't great to watch him...if you haven't seen it do yourself a favor and buy a copy, it maybe 12 years ago but it feels as if it was only yesterday.",1236124800,2,1269,4.545851528384279
958112,4,6305071594,"Wow, this was a shock to see rock mega-stars like Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney and Mark Knopfler side-by-side-by side on stage for a couple of numbers. Add in Phil Collins on drums, Ray Cooper on percussion, Elton John and Jools Holland on keyboards and more good backup musicians, plus an orchestra and big choir and it all made for a memorable night, I'm sure, for those at Royal Albert Hall in London in 1997.

The benefit concert in September of '97 for the residents of Montsserat, a Caribbean island which had been devastated by a volcano the year before. Many of the aforementioned artists had recorded some of their famous songs on that island at the Air Studios at Montsserat.

In addition to the above, there was Sting, Jimmy Buffet, Arrow & His Band and Carl Perkins. It's always a thrill to see and hear rockabilly legend Perkins doing ""Blue Suede Shoes,"" which he also was wearing! Sadly, Carl died a little over two years after this concert.

My personal likes of this concert included Buffet's catchy number ""Volcano,"" with new lyrics covering what happened at Montserrat; Phil Collins' entertaining ""Take Me Home;"" John doing his first hit, ""Your Song;"" a wonderful low-key collaboration between Clapton and Knopfler on ""Layla;"" Clapton's guitar solos and some good keyboard work by Holland on ""Same Old Blues;"" and the rousing finish of ""Kansas City,"" led by McCartney, who seemed to be the featured performer in this galaxy of rock stars.

With almost two hours of music, anyone can find enough material here to give them an entertaining night of music and when all of these guys get together for the final couple of songs.....well, that has to be seen to be believed. This is a real collector's item for music lovers.",1226448000,,1736,4.815436241610739
958113,5,6305071594,I had been looking for this DVD since I listened to it thru a set of noise cancelling headphones at the Bose outlet store in 2003. Bot the headphones and have been searching online for this DVD so I am very happy to have found it on AMAZON!!! You can't beat these rocker friends together - it is very powerful! Excellent buy!,1213142400,,325,4.258064516129032
958114,4,6305071594,"Phil Collins singing ""Take Me Home"" and Mark Knopfler performing ""Brothers in Arms"" and ""Money for Nothing"" are fantastic; heck, Elton, McCartney, Sting, Eric Clapton, Sting, Jimmy Buffett, Carl Perkins and Arrow are all great.  This is a wonderful concert; I just wish I could have heard it in person.

This DVD looks fantastic and sounds terrific--especially on a DTS capable system like mind.  I buy music DVD's only if I can see that they have DTS encoding on the disk (Amazon please take note).  However, in a few places--just a couple--the sound quality of ""Music for Monserrat"" falls down a wee bit compared to other music DVD's I have; otherwise, I would have rated it 5 stars.

That said, this is a great DVD for those like me who love these artists.",1210291200,,759,4.676691729323308

Beatles producer George Martin kicks off the concert and probably had a hand in the DVD production. The sound quality is superb. The Albert Hall ambience is right on. The musicians are at their best. Phil Collins kicks off with a great number. The concert then sags a bit until it's revived by Mark Knofler. If you watch the backup group closely you'll notice that the excellent session guitarist is quitely joined by an old guy named Clapton. From that point on the music soars as Knofler, Collins, Sting, Clapton, Elton John, and finally McCartney put on a show that can be watched over and over again.",1183852800,3,766,4.681481481481481

""Brothers in Arms"" by Mark Knopfler (Dire Straits) is the most exquisite song on the program and Knopfler's ""Money for Nothing"" with Sting and Eric Clapton is the most rocking.  Clapton's mostly-acoustic guitar set (with Knopfler backing) is superb, and I can't complain about Elton John on solo piano.  He is truly an outstanding performer. The finale with Paul McCartney leading endless choruses of ""Hey Jude"" with all the performers was way, way better than good.

958201,5,6305071594,"This is what the British singer Elton John told the public that overcrowded the famous Royal Albert Hall, in London, before he sang and played Live like Horses, a song he composed to be played along with the Luciano Pavarotti. Unfortunately Luciano could not come up so Elton John did both his part and Luciano's! The outcome you will see when you buy this DVD but I may tip in advance that the audience in the back, composed of musicians from the Royal Orchestra, was totally overwhelmed by the solo performance of the pop singer Elton John. The venue of the show is an attraction in itself, being one of the most sacred temples both to classical music and to recent pop history if we remember the former Beatle John Lennon asking the noble audience to shake their jewels.

This superb September 1997 show was done to raise funds to help the people from Montserrat to rebuild their lives after a volcano eruption almost completely devastated the tiny Caribbean island it in the same year. The performers were mainly British and one after the other they convey to the audience and to home spectators the sheer intensity of their devotion to music. Sting, Eric Clapton, Phil Collins, Mark Knopfler, Elton John and the former Beatle Paul McCartney, just to name a few of the pop stars present at the performance, with a little help from the British Royal Orchestra, play some of their most famous songs and, in the end, band themselves together in a final jam session not to be equaled in sheer intensity by anything done before in pop story. Just figure out what is to have in a single session the likes of Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney, Elton John, M.Knopfler, etc..., and to top it all, with background orchestra and vocals conducted by sir George Martin, the man who made arrangements to almost all Beatles songs!!

It is a must buy to anyone who enjoys music played by the best performers from the 60's trough the 90's; this DVD will bring you a lot of the pleasure you may be looking for. Enjoy it!!",1096848000,6,2002,4.605042016806722
958202,5,6305071594,"This concert was held to benefit the island of Montserrat after it was largely destroyed by a volcanic eruption. The show is good overall, and the sets by Mark Knopfler and Eric Clapton are sublime. All performances are backed by such luminaries and Phil Collins and Phil Palmer and a full orchestra, which has never done better work than they do here on ""Brothers in Arms.""

The best performance of the show comes from Dire Straits founder Mark Knopfler. Dire Straits recorded the album ""Brothers in Arms"" in Montserrat, and here he performs the title track more perfectly than the on the original recording. He finishes his set with the help of Sting and good friend Eric Clapton with ""Money For Nothing."" Clapton returns the favor by having Mark sit in on ""Layla"" in what may be the definitive version of the song. These two master guitarists alone justify the purchase of this DVD.

I didn't really care for the Elton John or Paul McCartney sets. I don't know why the orchestra sat unused on ""Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me"", but it was not for the better. Likewise, McCartney is a great performer, but I have seen way too many singalong versions of ""Hey Jude"" at this point. McCartney's version of ""Kansas City"" though is one of the highlights of the show.

Everyone onstage does a competent job, but the performances of Knopfler and Clapton really do steal the show.",1093564800,8,1373,4.6419753086419755
958203,5,6305071594,"I originally came across this DVD while searching for material from Mark Knopfler.  After looking at the set list, I tried to find it but it had gone out of print.  I was thilled to see it available once again and bought it immediately.  All I can say is this is an excellent show! The only drawback to me (but not enough to drop this rating to a four) is the flow of the music early on....Phil Collins does an excellent job on the opening track with Take Me Home, but then we shift to Hot Hot Hot, Blue Suede Shoes and Jimmy Buffet.  Just seemed kinda screwy.

However, this is the turning point of the show with no weak performances the rest of the way.  The highlights being Brothers in Arms, Sting, Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me, Layla and a great medley from McCartney to wrap things up.

The DTS recording is solid, but not at the level of Clapton's 'One more Car, One more Rider' or the Eagles 'HFO' but not many are. Still, it's well done and not a detriment to the disc whatsoever.

The bottom line is it's a legendary lineup for a very worthy cause...BUY IT!",1092960000,3,1070,4.21078431372549

958205,4,6305071594,"I'd love to give this 5 stars, but I thought the initial Phil Collins track, the Arrow and Jimmy Buffett tracks could have been eliminated. Phil is stellar on the drums throughout, but he takes his solo appearance on Take Me Home, the first track on the DVD, and hams it up so much he ruins it. Jimmy and Arrow, while not exactly outclassed, just don't seem to have the stage presence of the legends that follow. So I usually start with Carl Perkins (track 3), and then cut to Mark Knopfler (track 5?), then the rest of the show.
That said, there are not less than 3 or 4 literally goose-bump inducing moments when the performances and/or the combined stature and command of these legends just takes over and you have a kind of magic. One is the effortless showmanship of Carl Perkins, wearing blue suede shoes to sing his timeless classic (rather see him do it than Elvis, honestly). The crowd reaction when Knopfler introduces Clapton to play along on Money for Nothing. Then Elton John completely filling the hall with just the piano and his powerful solo vocals on Live Like Horses (an appreciative member of the orchestra sitting behind Elton is seen shaking his head in awe and admiration).
And of course, as others have said, McCartney singing Hey Jude when Elton comes in on the second verse. Chilling. The sing-along with everyone is spectacular. I even thought Ray Cooper was a hoot. I've never seen a guy get so much joyous mileage (or style) out of a tambourine and a pair of sunglasses.",1073347200,4,1499,4.597014925373134

958223,5,6305071594,"I just finished watching this for the first time, and was completely blown away.
I could tell you that seeing Carl Perkins rip through his rockabilly standard ""Blue Suede Shoes"" is worth the price of this entire DVD, but (with the exception of Jimmy Buffet) it just gets better and better from there.
Mark Knopfler's breathtaking rendition of ""Brothers in Arms"" is immediately topped by his performance of ""Money for Nothing"" where he's accompanied by Sting AND Eric Clapton.
Sting offers a couple of Police tracks which he's slowed down to that modern contemporary housewife Jazz he's now renown for.
Elton then steps up, and with only a piano and his voice offers three more deeply moving classics to the list of ever improving numbers...thankfully none of which are any version of ""Candle in the Wind"".
 How much would you pay for this incredible list of performances!?! BUT WAIT!!! There's more....
Enter, yet again, the man himself. ""God"", as some have called him, I prefer the term ""Slowhand""... ERIC CLAPTON sits center stage, with trusty Martin 6 string in hand, and gives one solo number before being joined again by Mark Knopfler. The two perform the best version of acoustic ""Layla"" I've ever heard....and after that, Clapton gets real good...
And just as you think it can't get any better..out comes Sir Paul McCartney...and with 40 years of material to draw from, pulls out the trump card and gives three Beatles numbers which evolve into all star jams featuring all of the afore mentioned artists.
With this amazing spectacle you also get Phill Collins, Montserrat native; Arrow, George Martin, an entire symphony orchestra, an enormous chior and ivory tickler extrordinare; Jools Holland,.... who even shows up Elton John's piano playing during the monumental ""Kansas City"".
While watching this film I didn't know whether to laugh out loud or cry like a baby...so I just sat dumbfounded...
If I had anything negative to say about this masterpiece, it would be only that Jimmy Buffet should have been selling paradisian cheeseburgers in the lobby, because on that stage he was out classed, out ranked, out played, and outshined...I'm not even sure what his useless carcass was doing up there in the frst place. If there was an option to add half a star..I would have given this film 4 and a half instead of five only because of him....

Kudos to Sir George Martin for staging this incredible benefit. (Too bad they couldn't show the whole concert.) I'm very glad to have the video of Carl Perkins(just before he died). He had a lot of fun out there. I was a little disappointed in Clapton's playing but there were just so many great performances. Knopfler's Brothers in Arms (with those amazing kettle drums...sounded like the blitz over our heads!)left the audience literally weeping. Money for Nothing was fabulous. Sting was in great form. If that wasn't enough, Elton John (who had just finished the Diana tribute only weeks before)doing ""Your Song"". I'd never seen him live before and I now understand why he is such an incredible performer. Just him and a piano. If that still wasn't enough.. Paul McCartney playing Albert Hall (34 years to the day) that he was last there. When he came out solo and strummed the first few chords of ""Yesterday"", there wasn't a dry eye in the place.

958273,5,6305071594,"As usual, in no two performances is Mark's work ever the same.  Compare the same song on different albums and you will see this.  What further distinguishes him from pretty much every other performer is his use of fillers in his music.  He doesn't use them.  Every note has a purpose, and never does he sing the same way or play the same way.  He is truly creativity at its best. His performance of Brothers in Arms was breathtaking, his voice even deeper than usual. Backed by an orchestra full with composer and a good percussionist for a mystical effect unmatched on all previous albums, live or studio.  You have not heard this song until you hear this version.
Money for Nothing was good, with Clapton playing some lead, Phil Collins on drums, and Sting on backing vocals.  However, in my opinion it was a bit too crowded for the sound technician, and he could not do it justice.  It was still great though.
The icing on the cake would have to have been Layla, track 15, which was Clapton on acoustic rhythm guitar with Mark playing lead.  The communication between the two was incredible, as the song gracefully swayed between one and the other as Clapton extended his rhythm sections for Mark to play lead.  Likewise, Mark toned down his riffs to make way for Clapton's vocals and finalee.  It is noteworthy that both solos on the track were played by Mark, and both were his own interpretations.
If you like the version of Layla on Clapton Unplugged, prepare yourself to fall in love.
On the above only the dvd is worth having.  The other guys were good, but I'm here for the MK fans.  Incidentally, I saw him on the Philadelphia tour in the Albert Hall this June.  He was good then, but he was waaaaaay better here.",1000425600,4,1724,4.519354838709678

Mark Knopfler's 'Brother in Arms' alone makes this DVD worth owning.  There are three sound options, the default 'Dolby' has issues and is the worst of the three.",1496016000,,322,4.732142857142857
