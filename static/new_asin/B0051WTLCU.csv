8453333,5,B0051WTLCU,This show was my first introduction to Eva Cassidy. It is basically a repeat of Nightline UpClose presented on 8-14-2002. There are a few differences but if you have one you don't necessarily need the other. It is very good and it introduces you to Eva and her music. I recommend it to fans new and old alike. You have to remember the material is old (Eva passed in 1996) so it is not the quality we are used to seeing but if you a fan or just getting to know her I highly recommend it.,1327708800,8,486,4.072916666666667
