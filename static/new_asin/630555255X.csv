1048021,4,630555255X,"this is a really good movie I thought. its about this small town in the desert, Kate Hudson(Almost Famous) and her father John Heard(C.H.U.D.) come to the town for a visit. in the town there is Brendan Sexton III(Boys Dont Cry) who plays Blue, Christina Ricci(Pumpkin) who plays a pipebomb addict and her boyfriend Casey Affleck(Oceans Eleven2001), Sara Gilbert(Rosanne) and her boyfriend Peter Sarsgard(The Salton Sea) and Ethan Suplee(Mallrats). Hudson and Sexton start to have a connection, the town is seiged off by cops because a truck spilled and they don't know if its radioactive or deadly and the 2 start to fall in love and Hudson bonds with his friends who think shes too pretty and shes an actress who some of the people in town saw her on a show. Michael Ironside(Starship Troopers) appears as well as the one of the cops who seige the place up. its filled with comedy, drama, romance and haunting secrets. one of 1999's best",1066953600,6,938,4.796296296296297
1048022,3,630555255X,"This movie was not as good as i thought. I think the story is solid but could have more to it. The cast is excellent and each of the characters have their own personalities and goals in life, which add to the way the story turns out. The acting is great - i just think more of a story would have made a more entertaining movie. But overall a good movie I would watch again!!",1004054400,2,374,4.0

ALL  IN THE SAME MOVIE... if you get as excited over a casting call as i do, you  already expect the movie to be unbelievable before you've even watched it.  i predicted the ending, but even so, the ride was still fun.  i am  especially impressed with ethan's performance- its about time he was given  a good role like this one!",949449600,4,613,4.4324324324324325

So is all the others in the film. How many movies have you seen  where 10 minutes into it you know the ending? To many to name for me. That  is why I am not going to refer what happens in the movie, I just say if you  want to see a new movie, not told told another way, please see this movie  and you WILL add it to your collection.

Based on the reviews, I expected to like this film a bit more than I did. I love quirky independent films and I am a big fan of Morgan Freeman. So, it pains me to say that the writing (dialogue) was clunky.  The characters were interesting and offbeat but some of the relationships that developed did not seem credible.  Casey Affleck, Christina Ricci, and Brendan Sexton III were all very good. That said, I thought that the idea of portraying the struggle of people in a small town and the juxtaposition of the quirky (ice cream cone, beach in the desert) with the clear tedium and pain of life in an economically depressed and largely abandoned town was interesting.",1481932800,,691,4.609756097560975

1048450,5,630555255X,"Quirky and charming with a surprisingly deep soul, Desert Blue sneaks up on you. This is independent filmmaking at it's finest at the twilight of an era before digital cameras and Final Cut Pro forever changed (and flooded) the indie scene. Supported by an all-star cast before they were stars, Desert Blue is both a coming of age and nostalgia for a glorious past type of story. Not just the glorious past of the fictional California desert town of Baxter's gold mining days, but nostalgia for the days when a passionate writer and director and producer and crew and cast would venture out to an abandoned town with canisters of film and toil to create a visual experience that is equal part whimsical fantasy and an observation of the shared experience that makes up everyday life. The young, glamorous television actress Skye (Kate Hudson) is forcibly placed into a very small, nowhere desert town by her well intentioned, road tripping father (John Heard). Neither Skye nor the varied array of local townspeople want to be there. Events unfold and while reluctantly at first, the characters get a chance to spend time together, each seeing their worlds in a different way as they bond against the distrustful federal agents that have placed the town under quarantine. Desert Blue is not entirely free of some predictable story cliches, but the amazing cast, funky locations, and deft pacing make this one turn down a forgotten lonely highway in the middle of nowhere that is not to be missed.",1481587200,7,1496,4.870588235294117

Why rate it so low then write about it at great length with so many compliments.  Well I'll be frank with my review, no puzzlements here:  Desert Blue was a great film, great direction, great acting, great writing, great actors and actresses.  Morgan Freeman did a fine job in directing and writing this movie and I think he should do more writing and directing.

1048494,3,630555255X,"'Desert Blue' is an indie movie, and like many indie movies it features many quirky characters played by good actors whose names should be more famous than now.  This is also the debut for Kate Hudson, whose acting is the strongest here, proving that she was on the way to a bigger thing.

Kate Husdon is Skye, TV starlet and daughter of the professor John Heard, who studies the roadside attractions in America.  Now they are going to watch 'the biggest ice cream corn' in the small, very small town of Baxter, Calfronia, with the population less than 100.

In this Nowhereavill, you see some young kids spending ainless time -- still they don't look so unhappy as you think.  Among them you see Casey Affleck, Brendan Sexton, and Christina Ricci, the last one's hobby being blowing up the things with her hand-made explosion device.

Because of the situation you don't have to take seriously, the father/daughter are trapped in this town, which is a familiar device to make them meet the local kids.  Skye gradually comes to like them, especialy one of them, but at the same time she has to go back to the city, where she could possibly get a bigger role in the film (unexpected co-incidence that reflects the future career of Kate Hudson herself).

The film is not as unique as it thinks it is, but very cozy to see at the same time, especially when you see the realistic locations and the two ladies -- Hudson and Ricci, both of whom manage to impress us in a quite different way.  Hudson (or Skye if you like) cannot hide her amiable nature even if she initially hates to be detained in this 'desert' while Ricci, as usual, steals the scenes with her trademark 'WHO CARES?' attitudes, which conceals her tender side deep inside.  Fans of the stars should watch this.

You may not remember the film very long, which itself is not remarkable as it should be.  In fact, after the film is over, not many are memorable, perhaps because the film is too good-natured, or weak some might say, to impress us.  Still, it's a good thing to see the earlier work of Kate Hudson, who is, as the name of  Skye suggests, about to reach the stardom.",1091145600,,2137,4.53125
1048495,3,630555255X,"Someone created jobs, putting a lot of actors and studio people to work, and also endorsed (perhaps indirectly) some pretty good products. Other than that, there's really not much to say about this movie. While it does have its moments, it's not one I'd knock down the doors of the video outlet to get to. In fact, this is one of those movies you'd watch when you've already viewed everything else in the store.
It's the story about people who live in the small town of Baxter, California (population 87). A truck has overturned spilling a mysterious chemical, and the driver of the truck dies. Investigators believe he died from whatever the chemical is. Soon the FBI arrive and quarantine the entire town, leaving everyone wondering whether or not they are going to live or die a horrible death. A man and his daughter who came to sort of sight see while on their way to an audition, end up along with the townspeople, unable to travel further since the FBI have set up road blocks around the area. What will happen to these people? You'll need to get the movie and find out.
The film does have an array of interesting characters. One of them, a deputy who wants to be a sheriff in another town tends to make mountains out of mole hills. It's ironic in that I actually know policemen and women who are just like his character.
If you're a Christina Ricci fan, you're sure to love this movie in that she is peppered throughout it. Roles are played well, and hers is the most unigue of the bunch. She's definitely a girl you would not want to make mad, and when you see the movie you'll understand why. In a way, the movie has two plots. One of course is the story of what's going to happen to the quarantined people, the other is finding out the facts concerning a mysterious fire at a motel. I did like the dialogue in that it was at times thought provoking. As the people tried to go about their daily activities as normally possible, they brought up interesting outlooks on life, and on what could be their last days alive.
There is a minimum amount of action in this film. It is a movie for people who enjoy dialogue. There is no nudity, no overt sexual situations, but it does have strong language. There is romance, but not to the point to where you would want to cover the eyes of your kids. One of the ""highlights"" of the film is where the teens of the town get into an orange war, then one part where someone gets shot trying to leave town. I own the movie, and I've watched it once, and perhaps I will again, still, this is not a grand epic action packed film.",1085529600,,2571,4.369519832985386

7891646,1,630555255X,29 minutes in and the characters are so interesting and the plot so mundane and predictable that I couldn't care less what happens to any of them.  One star.,1508630400,,157,4.413793103448276

When it finally comes out on Blu ray, I'll revisit it because the premise sounds interesting and quirky.",1498953600,,190,4.457142857142857
7891649,5,630555255X,"An ensemble film; Fun, surprising, subtle, with a lighted-heart attack on the long minutes of destruction of action thrillers; here the various single booms are integral to the emotions, actions, values, and characters. The booms announce change in a place that never seems to change. The booms blow up the movie's ennui; the booms mirror and complement the expression of the kiss. I loved the rippling themes, too many too mention, that lie along and under the surface of this film, and its characters including the goth girl who is the sheriff's daughter living in the desert.",1498003200,2,578,4.969072164948454
7891650,1,630555255X,"Do not waste you time on this movie. Terrible acting and terrible dialogue. At one point they say ""save a donut, kill a cop."" Whomever writes this crap needs to be stopped. It is awful.",1497744000,,185,4.314285714285714
7891651,3,630555255X,The well-known actors/actresses in this flick are its only redeeming quality. I love a good low budget film but this is just not good.  And the FBI involvement is just over the top and ridiculous. I really wanted to like this.,1497571200,2,226,4.512195121951219

7891653,4,630555255X,"Charming, funny, unconventional, and oddly delightful. The reason we like independent movies began with films like this. Cristina Ricci rocks the town with her wit and fire. Kate Hudson moves from snark to comrade. The rest of the town's characters shine in their own idiosyncratic ways. An enjoyable saunter in the desert for a Saturday night.",1494028800,2,344,5.160714285714286
