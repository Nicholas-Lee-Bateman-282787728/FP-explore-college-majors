  While initially Romero & Argento were going to do a series of these for TV with other Horror Directors (Craven & Carpenter), they had to pull out.

450740,4,630229374X,"George Romero and Dario Argento are undoubtedly two of the most iconic directors in the world of horror, yet for some reason, Two Evil Eyes has usually played last fiddle in comparison to either director's more prolific works.  Both helm separate tales with Two Evil Eyes, which is based on the works of Edgar Allan Poe.  Romero's is ""The Facts in the Case of Mr. Valdemar"", in which a trophy wife (Adrienne Barbeau) and her doctor lover (Ramy Zada) plot to rid themselves of her old, wealthy husband.  Then things end up taking a supernatural turn for the worse, naturally.  This segment is far from the best you'll see from Romero, but it is a fun dirge nevertheless.  Argento tackles one of Poe's finest and most renowned tales with ""The Black Cat"", in which a photographer (Harvey Keitel giving a great performance) is driven to murderous lengths after his girlfriend takes in a stray black cat.  This segment is definitely the better of the two, as it showcases just what made Argento such a celebrated horror director in the first place with some spectacular camera work. In essence, Two Evil Eyes are Poe tales with more modern twists, featuring some pretty good gore effects by the great Tom Savini.  And now that Blue Underground has released the film on Blu-Ray, it is more than worth discovering or re-discovering all over again.  Look for a young Julie Benz (TV's Dexter) in a blink and you'll miss her role as Keitel's girlfriend's violin student.",1262822400,3,1460,4.765873015873016

450742,4,630229374X,"It was only fitting George A. Romero and Dario Argento would team up for a project. They first worked together on George A. Romero's masterpiece Dawn of the Dead. Two Evil Eyes was the first time they worked together since. Two Evil Eyes takes two stories written by Edgar Allan Poe and are adapted for the screen. Originally Two Evil Eyes was going to be a collaboration between not only Argento and Romero, but John Carpenter and Wes Craven, another idea was a cable based show, but the other scripts were written but sadly never produced.

When George Romero and Dario Argento are involved together on a project interest among fans will pick up and there will be really high expectations. Both are two of my very favorite filmmakers, George Romero would have at least 2 films in my top 10 and 3 films in the top 20. And some of his others would crack my top 50. Dario Argento would also have several films in my top 20 and probably the most films in my horror 100 than any other filmmaker. So upon seeing Two Evil Eyes I was quite excited.

Some people say this project was on their downside of their career. I have to disagree in particular with Argento, at this point he was still going strong and his next 2 feature films were very solid, it was after Trauma and The Stendhal Syndrome his career would be mixed. Romero may have taken a slight step down, but was still a solid horror filmmaker at this time. Both may have peaked, but were still at the top of their game.

First up we have George A. Romero's The Facts in the Case of Mr. Valdemar; this part has taken some heat among the viewers as being the weaker of the two segments. While I understand why it's seen that way I have to disagree. The screenplay by George Romero was quite solid the basic plot is a very common theme. A woman and her lover plot to steal millions from her dying husband. We have seen many variations of that concept done, but to Romero's credit he's able to keep things interesting despite most of the movie made up of dialogue until the very end.

He benefits from a solid cast led by Adrienne Barbeau who like always gives an excellent performance. All the actors are solid in this installment and help make The Facts in the Case of Mr. Valdemar interesting. As a director George A. Romero is able to keep the pace moving even if it's a little slow at times and is able to build upon some good tension. The Facts in the Case of Mr. Valdemar only runs at about 55-minutes, but it doesn't really drag despite the lack of action. The script and acting are solid and again Romero is able to keep things moving along at a pretty good pace.

What brings this down though is the fact like I stated earlier the concept has been done so many times. The only real twist is the dying husband has to stay alive for a certain amount of time for Adrienne Barbeau's character to get the money. I understand this is based off a story that came before a lot of the films and TV shows that used this concept, but nothing here really stands out.

Towards the final act there were certain aspects I personally felt didn't work all that well. The corpse being able to communicate with the characters I felt just didn't quite work in my opinion. It was an interesting twist in the story, but that is basically the only downside for me. The final few minutes is when all the action kicks in. George Romero delivers and a solid final act and he closes his story out on a high note.

To be honest this feels a little like an extended version of Tales from the Crypt only without the campy humor. But overall I found The Facts in the Case of Mr. Valdemar a solid segment and much better than some reviews might lead you to believe. Don't expect any violence until the end. And I think that is why it's disliked most people were probably expecting more action. Ramy Zada, E.G. Marshall and Bingo O'Malley also star and Cult Icon Tom Atkins appears in the final few minutes as none other than a cop.

For the 2nd and final segment we have Dario Argento with The Black Cat, which is the more popular of the two segments among the fans. The Black Cat is a rather popular story in the horror genre, sometimes it's a straight up telling of the Poe story and other times there is a twist put on it or some how worked into the plot even if it doesn't always seem to fit.

The Black Cat was written by Dario Argento & Franco Ferrini and like Romero's story suffers from being too much like other movies just like it. The Black Cat was overall well written though and the characters were quite interesting for the most part.

When it comes to Argento you can expect a great visual ride and he delivers that in The Black Cat; his camera shots are excellent and there is even a POV shot from the cat, which was an interesting touch. In my opinion Argento delivers the best POV shots in film. His use of colors is toned down at times, but from a pure visual side this is Argento so you know it will be a great looking piece.

The pacing here for The Black Cat is slightly better; there is a little bit more action and more stuff going on and that is why it's the favored of the two stories. But again like Romero's we have seen this story played out so many times and quite honestly, Argento really doesn't offer us anything different from what we have seen before with his take on The Black Cat, but I have to admit I very much enjoyed it.

The Black Cat also benefits from a solid cast led by Harvey Keitel; his character was quite cruel and even creepy at times. Madeleine Potter as Annabel also provides a solid performance, but unlike Keitel she is sympathetic. The two actors work quite well together and really add to the story. Martin Balsam appears in a brief role and steals the show as the nosey neighbor. John Amos appears though out as a detective and it was great seeing him. I have always liked his work.

Overall despite the clich&eacute;s of The Black Cat it was a lot of fun to watch, there is some decent suspense and tension, Argento has done better work, but The Black Cat is still a solid project in his career. Again it's only brought down by the fact we have seen this story played out so many times in TV and film. My only real complaint with this segment is the sudden and anti-climatic ending. It seems Argento and Ferrini didn't quite know where to end it and just simply thought of something on the spot. The build up was excellent; the final few minutes are quite strong, but the ending there isn't much of a payoff.

Two Evil Eyes may not be the strongest work in the careers of George A. Romero and Dario Argento, but it does provide great fun if you are fans of these two Iconic filmmakers. Between the two I found The Facts in the Case of Mr. Valdemar to be the better written of the two and had characters with a little more depth, but I prefer Argento's The Black Cat for the sheer fun of the story.

A lot of the times when two great filmmakers work on a project together for some reason it doesn't always work; I don't just mean product, but more financially. Two Evil Eyes didn't really get over that well and thus this was the only installment. I think we the viewers go in with such high expectations. As much as I did enjoy Two Evil Eyes it was a slight letdown since it was Romero and Argento. But if you are a fan of these two filmmakers I would highly recommend this. Again it may not be the best project in their career, but it does prove for a solid and good time.",1193529600,2,7462,4.293532338308458

Romero, felt like a competent but uninspired network TV compilation episode. So it's a real surprise just how much dark fun Argento has with The Black Cat, playfully riffing both on Poe's other short stories and classic movies (there's even a subtle Psycho moment where Martin Balsam's nosey neighbor finds himself at the foot of another staircase looking for another missing woman) as Harvey Keitel's crime photographer - first seen photographing the aftermath of a Pit and the Pendulum incident - finds his life going to Hell when he gets rid of the girlfriend's cat.

450777,3,630229374X,"Edgar Allen Poe stories modernized by George A. Romero and Dario Argento.  Sounds like it can't miss, right?

The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar is George Romero's part.  At only an hour the film somehow seems overlong.  It looks like Romero's on a sedative here, the pacing is way too slow and in the end nothing much happens.  There's one decent zombie scene near the end and the finale is quite horrific but I'm sure Mr. Romero could have spiced things up somewhat.  It looks like his heart wasn't all together in this project.

Dario Argento's The Black Cat is way better than Romero's film.  Loosely adapting Poe's original story and splicing in numerous references from other Poe stories, The Black Cat has moody and creepy atmosphere to spare along with some solid suspense.  Harvey Keitel gives a good performance in the lead, Tom Savini serves up some great gore effects and Dario, fresh from his insane camera-acrobatics in 1987's ultra violent Opera, is in top form with some great stylistic touches left and right.

This Blue-Underground 2 Disc Special Edition is really the only way to go, some great extras included here.  An interesting documentary with intetviews with both Argento and Romero and some very entertaining behind the scenes footage, along with Blue-Underground's usual high standard in terms of audio and visual quality.

450778,3,630229374X,"So what happens when you draw two masters of cinematic horror together to each provide their own, particular take on a couple of Edgar Allen Poe stories? Two great tastes that taste great together? Not exactly...but it is kind of fun. Originally titled Due occhi diabolici (1990), and then later called Two Evil Eyes (1991) for the American release, is comprised of two hour long segments. The first, titled ""The Facts in the Case of Mr. Valdemar"", was adapted and directed by George A. Romero (Night of the Living Dead, Martin), and features Adrienne Barbeau (Swamp Thing, Creepshow), Ramy Zada (After Midnight), Bingo O'Malley (Knightriders, Creepshow), and E.G. Marshall (12 Angry Men, Tora! Tora! Tora!). The second, titled ""The Black Cat"", adapted and directed by Dario `Visconti of Violence' Argento (The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, Suspiria), features Harvey Keitel (Reservoir Dogs, The Piano), Madeleine Potter (Slaves of New York), Sally Kirkland (Fatal Games), Martin Balsam (12 Angry Men, Psycho), and John Amos (The Beastmaster, Die Hard 2), probably best known to 1970s television fans as the no nonsense patriarchal figure James Evans, Sr. from the series ""Good Times"".

The movie starts with a short dedication to Poe, including a shot of his grave (or, at least a reasonable facsimile), just so we, the audience, are aware the material featured in this film was stolen...er, I mean, adapted from the works of Edgar Allen Poe. After this we kick into the tale titled ""The Facts in the Case of Mr. Valdemar"". Adrienne Barbeau plays Jessica Valdemar, an older, still highly attractive woman who is currently scheming with her sickly husband's physician, Dr. Robert Hoffman (Ramy), to bilk the her dying husband Ernest (O'Malley) out of as much money as they can, by using hypnosis to get him to sign important documents and such. Well, things go slightly awry after the old codger croaks sooner than expected, so the pair put him in cold storage, namely the freezer in the basement (who's up for some ice cream?) until they can see their plans all the way through. Only thing is, the geezer died while still under hypnosis...so what? Well, it also seems now, besides being a Popsicle, he's stuck between two worlds, that of the living and that of the dead. After Ernest starts vocalizing his predicament and freaking everyone out, Jessica decides to take matters into her own hands, which raises the question how can you kill what's already dead? The next story, titled ""The Black Cat"", features Harvey Keitel as Roderick Usher, a photographer who specializes in still life, often working with the local police documenting gristly crime scenes. Anyway, one day his live-in, witchy woman girlfriend Annabel, played by Potter, brings home a black cat. Well, turns out Roderick and the cat don't get along, as the cat has an unnerving habit of sitting and staring at Roderick. Soon the cat goes missing, Annabel is inconsolable, and Roderick is less than sympathetic. After a bizarre medieval dream sequence, one in which Roderick is punished with a sharpened pole inserted into a very uncomfortable place, the couple's relationship deteriorates quickly, not helped by Roderick's love for the drink, eventually leading to Annabel deciding to split...and split she does when Roderick comes home with a snootful and takes to her with a meat cleaver. After a bit of creative dry walling, Roderick conceals his crime, but the cat, which has since returned, sees all, and remembers even more...

Of the two tales featured here, I enjoyed Argento's more...both include better than expected production values, strong performers, and solid source material, but where Romero's piece seems a little tired and, well, trite, Argento's piece is a bit more substantial, flowing, and visually entertaining (not to mention visceral). I can't help but wonder if perhaps Ms. Barbeau taking one for the team by popping her top would have helped Romero's story...it couldn't have hurt...as far as the story itself, it's sort of similar to that segment titled ""Something to Tide You Over"", featuring Leslie Nielsen and Ted Danson, from the 1982 film Creepshow, as both included a re-animated corpse slumping around, seeking vengeance from those who wronging it prior to it becoming a corpse. The effects are excellent, but the adaptation lacks the punch I was expecting. There did seem a half-hearted effort to create something meaningful between the two main characters, specifically in terms of the pair seeing each other at their worst, and the subsequent effect this had on their relationship (murder's always been a turn off for me), but it never really developed into anything noteworthy. Seems like George had a couple of novel ideas, ones that he then filled in the rest of the story around. The bit at the end was definitely fresh, with the apparitions and the lighting, but not worth the price of admission. E.G. Marshall and Tom Atkins make limited appearances as a lawyer and a police detective, respectively. Argento's piece, on the other hand, comes across a bit stronger, despite the fact it includes an outlandish dream sequence, a tactic I generally despise, as it usually comes off as an effort to pad out the running time or introduce some crucial aspect to the story in a ridiculous manner. This one's set during medieval times, as we see a lot of people running around in ratty clothes, bad hair, and even worse teeth...oh, and look, there's a little person (is that the correct term nowadays? I'd say dwarf, but I need no blowback from the various midget/dwarf support organizations out there). Everyone knows a dream sequence just isn't a dream sequence without a little person, clad in strange garb, running around and cackling like a little a-hole...if you feel this way you should see the film Living in Oblivion (1995), but I digress...one of the reason's Argento's piece comes across as well as it does is because his eye towards hideous detail, his focus on vivid imagery, and his willingness to draw the audience's attention towards nasty, unpleasant things we might normally steer away from...overall the performances are solid, but I had a hard time swallowing Keitel's stereotypical beret wearing, pretentious, jazz listening, booze swilling, bohemian artist type character. The funniest bits for me were after the fact, as he tries to explain the subsequent absence of his girlfriend to the neighbors and her friends (apparently she was well-liked). Keitel's character was about the worst liar I've ever seen. The story flowed along nicely, and ended with a few, gruesome and welcomed twists.

The picture quality, presented in widescreen (1.85:1) anamorphic, on this Blue Underground DVD release, is very sharp, and the audio excellent. There are a few different audio tracks to choose from, including Dolby Digital Surround EX, 6.1 DTS - ES, and Dolby Digital Surround 2.0. As far as extras, it depends which version you purchase (there are two). If you buy the single disc version you'll get a theatrical trailer, a poster and still gallery, and biographies for the directors. If you get the double disc version, you'll get what I've already mentioned plus four featurettes. The first is titled `Two Masters' Eyes', and it's basically series of interviews strung together, lasting about a half hour, followed by a bit about Savini's effects (12 mins), At Home with Tom Savini (16 mins), and lastly Adrienne Barbeau talking about George Romero (5 mins). There's some interesting stuff in the two disc version, but not interesting enough for me to recommend to someone to pony up the extra cost over the single disc version...at the end of the day both versions feature the exact, same film.

450779,5,630229374X,"""Two Evil Eyes"" is loosely based on Edgar Allan Poe's stories ""The Facts in the Case of Mr. Valdemar"" and ""The Black Cat"". The first one was directed by George Romero and the second - by Dario Argento. Romero's segment came out to be pretty poor to my opinion. He always specialized on low budget trashy horror and among the pictures he did really well I can only mention his ""...of the dead"" quadrilogy. So here he did his usual job and as a result we have received a rather midiocre novel.
Argento's segment on contrary is outstanding. This was the first working experience on American soil for the Italian master. Dario's genius and American money and scale did their best. Although ""The Black Cat"" is different from previous Argento works it's still very remarkable. Dark and gruesome, this story will give you creeps for sure. It tells about a crime scenes photographer who commites a terrible crime himself and tries to cover up all the traces. Although we know he's a criminal we feel compassion towards him and watch anxiously how his lies get him deeper and deeper into new lies and how police circles him tighter and tighter. The story is extremely intense and is aggravated by terrible nightmares the photographer suffers at night. Of course I have to mention Harvy Keitel's work. Without any doubt it's one of the best of his roles.
""Two Evil Eyes"" is rather little-known and that's a pity, I can't understand why it is so underestimated. If you haven't seen it, buy it - the film won't be a disappointment. Romero's half will be a decent appetizer while Argento's - a real main course.",1128729600,4,1598,4.670212765957447

450781,4,630229374X,"George Romero and Dario Argento. Two names instantly recognizable to the horror fan. Romero, of course, is the guiding light behind the ""Living Dead"" Trilogy. His 1968 film ""Night of the Living Dead"" set a new standard in the flesh-eating zombie genre, and Romero followed up this groundbreaking film with two amazing sequels, ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Day of the Dead,"" both of which mix jaw dropping gore with black comedy and wicked satire. One of my favorite low budget apocalyptic films, ""The Crazies,"" is an early Romero effort. It's great news to hear about him working on a new zombie film, ""Land of the Dead,"" which will hopefully open sometime next year. Just as important of a contributor to the horror genre is the Italian director Dario Argento. He's best known for his gialli films--based on cheap Italian paperback murder mysteries employing multiple suspects, bloody murders, and numerous plot twists and turns--that rank as some of the best of that exalted genre. Fortunately for us, someone decided to bring these two powerhouses together so they could direct two shorts based on Edgar Allen Poe stories. The result is ""Two Evil Eyes,"" a highly underrated DVD that horror fans should watch immediately.

Romero's effort, ""The Facts in the Case of Mr. Valdemar,"" sees Jessica Valdemar (Adrienne Barbeau) in quite a fix. She's a relatively young woman who married the elderly Ernest Valdemar (Bingo O'Malley) for his money. Jessica suffered under the onerous behavior of her husband for years, putting up with a lot because she knew she'd strike it rich when he passed away. That day is quickly arriving, but it doesn't seem to come fast enough for Jessica and her husband's physician, Dr. Robert Hoffman (Ramy Zada). They want to put this guy in the ground as quickly as possible, inherit Valdemar's wealth, and head for greener pastures. Jessica even goes into town in an attempt to convince her husband's lawyer to cough up some funds, an action that arouses more suspicions than dollars. When the attorney insists on talking to Ernest himself, Hoffman hypnotizes the ailing man and tells him what to say over the telephone. Still, it will take some time to acquire the funds, so Jessica and Hoffman ponder whether or not they should help the poor guy along. In the meantime, Ernest Valdemar dies while under hypnosis and begins talking from beyond the grave. And wouldn't you just know it? It appears that there are quite a few souls on the other side interested in using Valdemar as a sort of psychic telephone. The results are predictably horrifying.

Argento's film incorporates several Poe elements in his overall take on ""The Black Cat."" Set in New York City, the film follows the activities of crime scene photographer Roderick Usher (Harvey Keitel) and his musician lover Annabel (Madeleine Potter). We see, for instance, Usher capturing the aftermath of a gory pendulum murder on film while yucking it up with the investigating cops. We also see the sensitive Annabel teaching a few youngsters how to play instruments. Both are artists in their own way, and both are a bit high strung since they possess the temperament of creative types. Roderick is the worst of the two. First, he's a suspicious sort of chap that doesn't seem to like anything his girlfriend does. Second, and more importantly in terms of the plot, he absolutely loathes Annabel's cat. And the cat loathes Roderick. Who can blame the little critter? You certainly won't when you see Roderick brutalizing the animal every chance he gets. The cat retaliates when it can, leading to an unfortunate incident that throws Annabel into a rage. One thing leads to another, resulting in a brutal murder and an attempt to cover up the crime--an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to cover up the crime, I should add, as we all know that murder will out every time.

Despite a few minor caveats, I quite enjoyed both films on the disc. Romero's entry is probably the lesser of the two for the simple reasons that the acting isn't that good and it takes awhile for the story to ramp up to eerie levels, but the end result is definitely one that will send chills up your spine. To hear Ernest Valdemar's asthmatic observations about what he sees on the ""other side"" should frighten most viewers. I also got a kick out of the grand finale when we finally see (sort of) in gory detail exactly what Valdemar witnessed in his excursions in the realm of the dead. Argento's contribution is better because of his classic cinematographic style. For example, he swings a camera across a room to simulate that pendulum swooping down on the hapless victim, a nice touch that will have Argento enthusiasts cracking smiles. There's also a massively cheesy dream sequence involving Roderick that ends on a particularly gruesome note. Finally, Argento injects a bit of black humor into the proceedings. So many people start nosing around Usher's apartment trying to find out where Annabel went that he resorts to some outrageous tricks to try and prove she's still alive.

Check out those extras! Lots of stuff here for the horror nuts. While I don't think either of the films on this disc rank anywhere near the best we've seen from these two directors, fans of both men will find plenty to appreciate with this DVD. Rumor has it that Wes Craven and John Carpenter were supposed to contribute a couple of shorts to the film but dropped out at the last minute. Too bad. Still, what we do get makes this one worth watching. You're probably better off just checking out the feature length films of Argento and Romero if you're new to their work, but completists will want to add this one to their collections.",1099526400,2,5672,4.838311019567456
450782,5,630229374X,"Despite being a big fan or Romero's zombie films and of Argento's more famous mid 70's to late 80's work it took me a while to get up too much enthusiasm for getting this movie, largely because of the primarily negative response to this film. And, though I generally like what Poe I've read, adapting him for film doesn't seem like such a hot idea, and not particularly wise use of these director's varied talents. (though I understand that these adaptations are, shall we say, very liberal with the source material)  A couple days ago, however, frustrated with the late or non-arrival of some things I'd ordered I decided I needed to buy something, and this came to mind.  Needless to say, it surpassed my expectations and was definitely worth the cash.

Romero's segment, 'The Facts in the Case of Mr. Valdemar', is much maligned, virtually always sighted as being the weaker of the 2, and generally being accused of being 'boring'.  While it is the weaker of the 2, I still find it highly entertaining and genuinely creepy.  It involves a trophy wife and her ex-lovers scheme to steal money from her terminally  ill, elderly husband's estate by forcing him to change his will through hypnosis. Unfortunately for them, he dies before the change can go through, and they have to stuff him in the freezer in order to buy time, at which point the story takes a supernatural turn. It is frequently described as being like an extra-long episode of 'Tales from the Crypt', with the conniving, utterly selfish characters and the poetic and/or ironic fate of the villains.  This is a pretty apt description, though it is certainly far better than what you'll see on that show, and more straight-forward and serious as well.  And as for the accusations that it is boring, well, I think it's atmospheric.  Sure, not much happens, but it's got a real air of menace in my mind, although it is extremely low-key.  Rather than creating atmosphere from an excess of style, Romero creates it with a lack of it, making the camera movements slow and deliberate, the sets relatively low-key, and keeping it largely free of any out and out shock attempts until we're already most of the way through the segment.  I can see why people would find this boring, but I just don't.  Many people have complained about the acting in this segment, particularly by Barbeau and Zada, but I think they're fine.  They aren't fantastic either, but they don't really ham it up the way so many have claimed.

As you'd imagine, Argento's segment, 'The Black Cat', is quite a bit more lively from a stylistic standpoint, though it is still fairly slow moving.  Harvey Keitel is Usher, a crime-scene photographer who is clearly at least a bit deranged, who has run-in's with his girlfriends hated black cat, leading to his murdering it.  Naturally, the cat mysteriously returns repeatedly, and he is driven mad and to murder and so on.  As you'd presume, style is the real point of this segment, and it is impressive, as always.  Stylistically, it's reminiscents of Argento's previous film, 'Opera' in that it has a particular wealth of unconventional camerwork, and uses upper-class, modern day architecture rather than obviously artificial architecture of no particular era. There are some particularly flashy camera movements, as they display every nook and cranny of Usher's cavernous, ominous house, and there are some expertly executed, if rather senseless cat pov shots.  There is also a very odd and hallucinatory dream sequence, apparently in the middle ages, and an even more trippy and unusual encounter between Usher and a barkeep who has a black cat similar to his girlfriend's.  The film is even more self conciously stylish and flashy  than his previous six films, almost as if he felt the need to get everything he'd have in a feature length film into the 60 minute time frame.  This is perhaps slightly distracting at a few points, but not too often, and it's always cool.  The segment also has a surprising amount of grue from Tom Savini and his crew.  We've got a corpse bisected by a pendulum, a corpse with it's teeth ripped out, a really brutal murder with clever,  a very odd and disturbing impalation, a partially eaten corpse and more.  The execution is generally excellent.  Not as good as what you'll probably see today, but still quite nice, and definitely impressive for 1989.  They also have some fairly convincing and nicely done animatronic cats.  And what's this, we have a great actor in an Argento film?  Keitel is generally very good, as you'd expect, although he over does it slightly in a few of his 'angry' scenes.  The supporting cast is generally strong as well, better than in the first segment.(It's largely a one man show, however)

Yeah, these movies are good.  Come in with an open mind, discard the negative predisposition you might have and and be patient.  I'll bet you'll like it.",1098576000,11,4893,4.806451612903226
450823,4,630229374X,"While George A. Romero and Dario Argento worked together on the production of Dawn of the Dead, this was the first movie the two actually 'worked' on together as directors.  Each contributed a short film based on a story by Edgar Allen Poe.  Romero adapted The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar while Argento chose The Black Cat.  Romero's comes first and it is routine EC comic style stuff, solidly made yet hampered by pacing that is a tad too methodical.  But the payoff is worth the trip and the cast (Adrienne Barbeau, Ramy Zada, and Bingo O' Malley) contribute nice work.  Argento's segment is far more energetic, a surreal trip into madness as a crime scene photographer (Harvey Keitel) is driven by his art to kill his live-in girlfriend's black cat.  Of course the cat returns, again and again, and things get even worse in that surreal nightmare way that only Argento can pull off.  Not content to just adapt The Black Cat, Argento also tosses in references to other Poe stories; namely The Pit and The Pendulum, The Tell-Tale Heart, Bernice, and several characters have famous Poe names (Usher, Pym, etc.).  If he didn't go overboard, then he wouldn't be Argento, now would he?  Blue Underground has done another first rate job with this wonderful disc.  The maligned movie has never looked or sounded this good and the extras are more than worth the bonus disc.  Romero and/or Argento fans will love it.  Recommended.",1080259200,3,1428,4.7368421052631575
450824,4,630229374X,"When directors get together, they have the potential to make interesting things happen. When great directors join forces and decide to take on a project, even better results areexpected. It honestly doesn't matter what type of material they're doing or if the viewing population has tasted it time and time again. They, the silver screen's version of power coupling, know their art, understand the little versions - or perhaps perversions - of atmosphere that balance the viewing scales, and have the most cards to play when it comes to forging complete pictures. Unfortunately, both don't always deliver a knockout punch like you'd like.
In this initial piece, it's a story you've heard before. An older fellow with dollarsign-laced pockets decides to marry a younger woman. People jeer it in the community and friends seem appalled by it, but attraction is attraction and a little IWantATrophyWife-itus is sometimes what wealth is all about. In our tale, we join an ex ""airline hostess"" and her much older husband as he's teetering on that painful plateau just outside of dying. Plans are in the works on how to acquire some of his fortune before his estate and the long years of ""settling"" are addressed, with hypnosis and the application of falsified doctor reports working fairly well. It all seems to be going splendidly, too, and three million dollars is all set to arrive in two weeks - providing the wife, Jessica, can keep her husband around that long. As movies would have it, however, he dies and the planning gets worse and worse and worse until....
This Romero addition to the power duo has some serious flaws in it. The plot is thin, the effects are a little drowsy, and what seems to start off well dances down the corridors of lackluster architecture. Honestly, it's a good thing that things happen the way they do in these tales, because the atypical plan thrown into this type of movie would normally end up with someone going to jail for a very long time. Money or not, you wouldn't want to bury someone in your own backyard with a couple of bullet holes in them and you wouldn't want them kicking it with you ice-cream and getting freezer burn. This is worse than that in some ways, however, because it seems to say that a master in his field and Savini can't get together and make something that hasn't been seen a hundred times over. Instead of illustrating a story the way an audience knows they can, they take a Poe idea, splash a little effect work on it, and somewhat go through the motions.
In Argento's version of The Black Cat, things play out a lot better. Our focal point, a man with a gruesome day job, brings home a little hatred and finds himself in a not-so-happy position of trying to conceal what he's done. When things get a little stressed and push come to shove (and hack and slice), it seems that things can get a little ugly at home. This seems especially when you're the owner of a cat you hate and don't want to keep up with, and moreso when you're half of a marriage that will ultimately self-destruct. Without giving all the gray matter away, this ultimately becomes a testament to revenge going awry, why you should treat animals a little bit better, and why post-it notes are a good thing if you don't want to leave out any small details to a crime.
In my personal opinion, the Argento piece is a short film made in gore heaven. Not only does it make a show of force with all its little pieces coming together and working out all-too-well, but it also gives little shout-outs to other Poe stories as well.
And then the eye candy begins to make its rounds.
The first effects, mutilated bodies, birth even better effects. The deaths seem to get worse and worse until, in one place, I saw something that I could almost feel because of the way the image evoked words like ""pain."" Still, it didn't stop there.  With little kitties doing things little kitties shouldn't do; hairless, nasty, and bathed in the debris brought to you by a mind that has imported images of this variety time and again, it gets even more graphic. And that's all I really ever wanted.
Combine that with build, a good plan that twists until it morphs into something horrific that the main character couldn't foresee, and nice acting and you can even overlook Romero's shoddy addition to this collection. Simply be warned that it does have a little kick in the ""gruesome"" department.",1071532800,8,4401,4.649550706033376
450825,3,630229374X,"I have to confess: I was thrilled beyond words when I heard Blue Underground was releasing this 1991 collaboration between two of my favorite horror masters, George Romero and Dario Argento. I bought the DVD sight-unseen, having only seen a few snippets of sequences from the second story in this two-movie collection, Argento's adaptation of Edgar Allen Poe's ""The Black Cat"".
I had seen those snippets as part of a larger Argento documentary called ""Dario Argento: an Eye for Horror""---and they were ghoulish indeed! Harvey Keitel impaled on a stake? Mewling, hairless baby cats walled up with a gore-caked corpse, 'Cask of Amontillado' style? The gruesome final finishing touch---death by merciless, razor-sharp pendulum---that even Poe himself had shied away from?
I had to have it, just for the Argento work alone! As for the Romero adaptation of ""The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar"", well how could you lose, with the evil mastermind behind ""Night of the Living Dead"" helming up a short movie about a miser left in hypnosis after death?
Blue Underground has done an excellent job with their Limited Edition DVD: the DVDs themselves are nicely decorated with two of the more chilling sequences from the film, and the material on the bonus DVD (including---hey!---a tour of make-up guru Tom Savini's home!)is worth the price of admission alone. It's a handsome DVD, and a nice addition to any horror movie aficionado's collection.
As for the movies---well, they're not what I had expected, highly uneven, and not the best examples of either Argento or Romero's work. But they're enjoyable, gory, ghoulish fare, with Romero's piece more subtle and stylish and Argento's entry an over-the-top assault on the senses that pays tribute to some of the nastiest of Poe's nuggets, including ""The Black Cat"", ""Lenore"" (ah yes, her lovely 32 teeth! nice touch, Dario!), ""The Pit and the Pendulum"", ""The Cask of Amontillado"", ""The Tell-Tale Heart"", and even a glib nod to ""The House of Usher"".
Taken together, the two pieces that comprise ""Two Evil Eyes"" give the film a ""Creepshow""-like feel, not surprising given that Romero helmed that movie. Romero's piece here has been unfairly savaged, and while it seems sedate in comparison to Argento's gory Italian Grand Opera, it's a stately, stylish little chiller. Adrienne Barbeau plays the crafty youngish wife of financier Valdemar (played to the hilt by Bingo O'Malley, who gave me the creeps!---he also shows up as Stevie King's dad in the Meteor episode of Creepshow), who plots with her hypnotist lover to get rid of the sick old man and abscond with a fortune.
Not surprisingly, things don't go as planned; look for an opening shot right out of ""Night of the Living Dead"" and a scene-chewing contest by movie veteran E.G. Marshall and Barbeau (who holds her own).
But it's really Argeno's sanguine little number you should check in for. Ostensibly an adaptation of ""The Black Cat"", it features Harvey Keitel as a demented crime photographer whose lifestyle and pre-occupations would make his ""Bad Lieutenant"" character cry for his mommy. It's not Dario at the height of his game, but it's wicked, depraved, gory stuff.
All told, these two shorts make a jolly, gory little evening of Poe-vian goodness. Break out a nice cask of Amontillado from your cellar (don't mind the knocking from the other side of the wall), open up a tin of caviar for your trusting black cat, put a blanket over your pet raven's cage, and enjoy two horror masters having some fun with their medium.",1065312000,7,3523,4.983022071307301

However, Dario Argento's The Black Cat is able to make you watch it on the edge of your seat, a gut-wrenching horror episode wonderfully enacted by the always great Harvey Keitel. The Blak Cat is brought to life thanks to Argento's talent, who knows like no one else the right way to move his cameras, bringing to the screens an original and classy art, and how to add sharp tension and suspense to his pictures. Although very short, The Black Cat is reminiscent of Dario's masterpiece Deep Red. In conclusion, Two Evil Eyes is a good buy for horror fans, because even with the boring episode by George Romero, Argento's work saved the picture.",1041292800,,940,4.773006134969325

450830,4,630229374X,"Okay, let's get something straight...George Romero's episode wasn't THAT bad.  It just pales incomparison with Argento's episode (AKA: the second story).
Romero's simplistic episode is genuinely creepy (""Wake me!"").  Adrienne Barbeau's energetic performance, as the adultress gold diging wife, and a cool set design make for a very entertainingly spooky horror episode.  What hurts this episode is perhaps the fact is that the story is a very tired one.  A revenge of a dead husband plot is one story that's been overused to death(no pun intended).
The second story, however, takes a Poe story that is known to be overused and takes it to another level.  With the help from a script by Dario Argento and Franco Ferrini, brilliant direction from Argento, an exellent performance from Harvey Keitel, and an above average supporting cast you've got one hell of a story of a man obsessed with crime, murder, and a black cat with a white mark on it's neck.
