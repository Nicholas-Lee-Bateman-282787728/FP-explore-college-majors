469070,5,6302458900,i have no clue what they were talking about i watched it many times when i was little and i loved it then a little while ago i watched it again as an adult and i still loved it i completelly understood what was going on it makes perfect sence and anyone who didn't understand it needs to get their brains checked or suttin because thats a good ass movie for kids and for ppl in touch with the kid inside us all.i mean they are thinking lojically like how can a boy become a cat and u cant always analyze movies like thati mean i don't hear them saying the wizard of oz didn't make sence about some girl flying over a rainbow into a land of farytales and everything,1077667200,5,664,4.076335877862595
469071,5,6302458900,"When I was about 3 or 4 years old, I remember going to the video rental store with my mom and getting this movie. I loved this movie and it was one of my favorite things to do as a kid. I reccomend it to anyone with a small kid.",1060732800,6,228,3.58
469072,4,6302458900,"I watched this movie as a small kid, and I loved it. To an adult, this film makes no sense, and sure is pointless. But, when I was little, it was full of danger, fun, music and bravery. I used to beg my mom to let me watch it again. I loved it. A kids movie.",1048377600,4,258,3.625
469073,1,6302458900,I rented this movie awhile back for the kids I babysit for.  The plot just doesn't make sense.  It's just a series of events that happen.  I wouldn't recommend anyone to watch it.,1024963200,2,179,4.363636363636363
469074,1,6302458900,"None of Don Bluth's movies, the exception being The Land Before Time has been very good. Bluth was a former Disney animator, but the Disney magic he tries to hard to duplicate simply isn't there. A story of a Rooster who leaves a farm after a rejection by his fellow farm animals when he fails to ""bring up the sun"" leaves him to pursue his true calling (as Elvis-esque lounge singer no less) and a small band of his still-faithful friends to look for him and bring him home. The plot itself is reason enough not to watch. It's so unbelievable ludicrous, and even in an animated world where anything is possible, this premise is hard to swallow. The songs are cringingly bad, someone please dial 911 for composers Alan Menken or Tim Rice please! The characters are so two-dimensional and phony that the viewer fails to become attached and care for them, even as they get themself into dire circumstances. Yes, I know this may sound preachy and self-important for a review of an animated movie, but since I have a great passion for them, one that is this poorly made infuriates me greatly. If you MUST watch, rent it, don't buy it.",970272000,6,1130,4.544117647058823

I never got to see it and this DVD has been discontinued for years since I've looked for it.

I finally saw it on Amazon streaming and IT WAS WORTH IT! I was so glad to see this movie. Don Bluth is a master storyteller. I don't know why this bombed in the theatre, but what a fun story.

470440,2,6302458900,"I loved Don Bluth's movies as a kid, every single one up until Rock-a-Doodle.  It didn't interest me then, I found it to be quite boring and a jumbled mess when compared to his other films.  While searching for something to watch with my two girls (ages 5 and 7), I came across this and was hoping time would be kinder.  The movie is still a hodgepodge mess.

This is a mishmash of the classic play about farm animals and the rooster that crows the sun up, Chantecler, and an Elvis musical.  These two things should have gone together better than the execution here.  If it had stuck more to the plot of Chantecler, it could have been a much more entertaining film, and again, if it had decided to be more firmly rooted in musical territory, it would have also succeeded more.  As it is, the plot is as weak as the limp-as-a-noodle songs.  The movie is heavily narrated by the basset hound farm dog (voiced by Phil Harris - who previously was the voice of Baloo in ""The Jungle Book"" and appeared in other Disney films).  He narrates over the songs, which kind of ruins the musical feel of the movie, not that the songs were worth noting in the first place.

The characters are forgettable and the designs even worse, from Sandy Duncan's voice coming out of an unattractive mouse with huge glasses and bloomers to the avian rejects from The Secret of NIMH. Killer from ""All Dogs go To Heaven"" is reincarnated here as a tiny owl, the nephew to the main villain named The Duke.  The same voice actor doing the same character (Charles Nelson Reilly) and still just as useless and unamusing.  Our lost ""hero"", Chanticleer, has an Elvis pompadour hairstyle, huge upper body and comically tiny from the hips down.  Despite a great voice, both speaking and singing by Glen Campbell, his character comes off as being rather one dimensional and doesn't get a lot of screen time.  The story is more concerned with where he is, and where he should be than actually following its main character.  Most of the screen time is based around a real live boy turned kitten and thrown into his fairy tale book.  Apparently the rooster quitting his day job of singing the sun up, has not only affected the story world, but the real world as well.  The inclusion of the boy/kitten from the real world (who goes on and on about how small and useless he is) is a strange subplot that detracts from what's going on.  Why is he here?  Why are the animals helping him?  Why can the villainous owl shoot shapes out of his beak, grow to huge sizes and turn children into animated animals?  Why is the cat wearing a fringe jacket and a raccoon cap and looking like Davey Crockett?  None of this is particularly explained... despite the rambling narration that tries to fill in the gaps.

The ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" connection doesn't show up in just the live/animated mixtures (which are seldom used, and when done, it's awkward to see).  The rooster's romantic interest is a watered down Jessica Rabbit with feathers and a squeaky voice.

The stage rock productions could have been a saving grace, but even those are saddled with poor songs, and interruptions.  The plot is silly, the resolution isn't much better, none of the characters are likeable (even Sandy Duncan's mouse isn't memorable, and she always comes off as being as sweet as can be).  Rock-A-Doodle is sadly a film that has little direction in what it wants to be, and ends up being good at none of the thing it strive for, making it easy to see why it flopped in the first place.

However, from a kid's perspective, my 5 year old enjoyed the movie, and went to bed with a smile on her face after watching it.  While little of the movie made sense to me, she had no problem with the bare bones of the plot and had few questions afterwards (why question a magic owl that wants eternal rain and night?).  The kids enjoyed it, and that's all that really matters, just don't expect a masterpiece with this one.",1339372800,2,3946,4.516901408450704

The seller was professional and kept in contact with me through email when my package didn't arrive on time. Because of the holidays and no fault of his own he replaced the dvd with a 2nd dvd and refunded my money for the expedited shipping I paid for.

Even in the worst of times, those three items were guaranteed from Santa Claus because he would never ever let a GOOD little boy or girl go without anything! I found ""Rock-A-Doodle"" in a bargain bin at some discount store, like Kmart or Walmart.  It looked like a cute movie, and had a great cast -  it was on VHS then; everything was, I believe!  My son LOVED it!  From that Christmas forwardm it became a tradition to watch the movie at Christmas. My son shared that movie with dozens of his friends over the years, until finally, in high school, his biology teacher wanted to see it, too - she, like me, loved animated films.  That year, his Senior year, the entire class got to watch the movie after finals.  It was a huge hit but by then, the VHS tape definitely needed replacing.  So, finally, this Christmas, nearly 20 years after getting him the original, I'm buying the DVD!  I have a feeling it will be one of his 'best presents' ever!

If anything, I think that it's harder for adults to explain it than children. This movie was wonderful and easy to follow (if you don't question things like an adult, but rather look at them from a childish perspective). In the movie, the cartoon world of Edmund's book clashes with his real life world when he calls for Chanticleer the Rooster to help bring the sun out to stop a flood overtaking his family's farm. In the process, he also brings the evil Owls to his world, the leader of which turns him into a cat because he is going to eat him.

As always, he takes a simple, childish story and adds bizarre, adult elements, jazzy colors and terrible musical numbers.  But that's all part of the fun.

The animation isn't bad, but it's definitely gritty and unpolished.  Like All Dogs Go to Heaven, it looks sort of old and grainy.  Anastasia and The Secret Of NIMH did not have that problem (and made decidedly MUCH MORE sense).  The female characters are awful stereotypes: we get some ugly, fat, busty chicken women, a whiny and beautiful (but TRICKY!) peasant and a feminist mouse (complete with a lisp and some classic huge glasses for the perfect Smart But Ugly woman look).  However, the guys aren't much better. I swear, this movie is full of hopelessly stupid characters. The only intelligent one seems to be The Grand Duke of Owls, the vast and easily worked up villain, voiced by the great Christopher Plummer... but even he randomly will do things like spew colorful shapes and use magic that will leave you wondering what in the heck you're looking at, an acid trip or a children's movie.

Oh and the live-action scenes are scarily bad. The acting is forced and the color is off.  The mom gives a lot of evil looks to the camera, too.

The plot is very loose and there are a lot of things thrown in like long chase scenes and dream sequences that seem to only be there to take up time. Everything is very ugly and it gives me a bad feeling.

BUT, please don't think I'm being ""mean"" or ""too harsh."" My opinion is just as valid as anyone's even if this isn't a glowing review.  I watch this movie still, and I love it despite its oddness. It's entertaining, and some of the characters pull some great one liners, especially the villains (the Duke and his nephew). I would say that 3-7 is a good age group to watch this movie, but also adults, because it's a great one to analyze (if you're on of those types who pleasures in finding strange grown-up references in kiddie films).

However, if you've never seen this and are therefore non-nostalgic, I must say that I brought this over to watch with a three year old that I was tending, and she constantly was asking me what was going on.

470597,2,6302458900,"I don't know what Don Bluth was thinking when he made this silly, nonsensical animated musical about a singing rooster, but I know what I'm thinking:  ""Why?""  ROCK-A-DOODLE isn't as depressing or dreary as Bluth's previous ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN, but it's not much better.

The film tells the story of Chanticleer, a barnyard rooster with a golden voice whose crooning -- sorry, crowing -- makes the sun rise every day.  One morning, however, Chanticleer is attacked by a bully rooster; in the process he neglects his crowing duties and the sun comes up anyway.  After being laughed at by his friends, the disgraced rooster heads off to the city.  Then it starts to rain, and before long, all the animals are terrorized by both floods and the evil Grand Duke of Owls, who, it turns out, actually set up the whole thing simply because he dislikes the sun.  In arguably one of the few memorable lines this movie offers, he also sneers, ""I positively LOATHE rock and roll.""

Naturally, the animals head off to the city to find Chanticleer, who, by this point, has become a famous star dubbed ""the King,"" with a greedy manager and a reluctant girlfriend, Goldie.  If the animals can bring Chanticleer back to the farm, the sun will once again rise and the floods will stop.  To prevent this, the Duke sends his clumsy (and unfortunately not very funny) nephew, Hunch (whose vocabulary mostly consists of rhyming with the word ""annihilation"") after the animals.

The plot, such as it is, doesn't make the least amount of sense and is likely to baffle even the most intelligent of grown-ups.  Working against ROCK-A-DOODLE as a whole, however, is the haphazard and confusing execution.  It also suffers from the problem of a major identity crisis:  on one hand it tries to be a simplistic fairy tale, on the other it attempts to be a musical parody of Elvis (Chanticleer's rock star persona and his songs are very closely modeled after the legendary singer, from the slick hairdo to the deep voice and the mannerisms). However, it ultimately comes across as a hodgepodge of ideas crashing into each other.

Furthermore, the characters, in addition to being unattractively designed, are not particularly compelling.  Chanticleer, while supplying a dead-on impression of Elvis Presley down to the voice and the singing (courtesy of Glen Campbell), is a two-dimensional lead.  His barnyard friends, which include Patou, a droopy canine unable to tie his shoes, Peepers, a bespectacled and lisping mouse, and Snipes, a zany magpie, do little to emerge as anything memorable, although the first two are well voiced by Phil Harris and Sandy Duncan, respectively.  Hunch, as mentioned, is unfunny, and useless.  That leaves the character of Goldie, Chanticleer's love interest, who is supposed to be a tough girl that eventually falls in love with our hero, but the screenplay doesn't give her much to do.  One suspects that she was included in this film just for the sake of a love interest.  As for the Grand Duke, he's little more than your typical scary, nasty, scheming bad guy, despite having the voice of Christopher Plummer.  And don't even get me started on where his supernatural powers (that enable him to grow to enormous size or transform anybody) came from.

Where ROCK-A-DOODLE really falls apart is in its attempt to bookend the movie with live-action sequences.  The idea is to include a real-life little boy, Edmond, as one of the story's major protagonists.  Actually, he spends much of the film transformed as an animated kitten (a transition that feels very awkward and unnatural).  And whining about how he is unable to do anything as a result of being small.  Constantly.  This subplot feels like it was tacked onto the story, hence one gets the feeling that it came out of nowhere.

There are also two live-action/animation sequences in the movie, but unlike WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT, they come across as very patchy and unconvincing--the real-life surroundings don't mesh well with the drawings, and it looks especially bad at the song and dance finale when the kid actor playing Edmond, Toby Scott-Granger, is brought back to the cartoon world.  Speaking for the animation itself, it's pretty much below par, even for a Bluth production.

Equally distracting is the narration that supplies most of the film.  Phil Harris has a great voice and does a credible job (although some might find it strange that the dog is recounting the whole thing).  The problem is that he narrates CONSTANTLY, even going far to chime in over some catchy songs sung by Chanticleer.  Considering that this film is supposed to be a musical, having Harris chime in every two minutes proves to be very distracting.  (The narration was apparently added on to prevent audiences from being confused, but why did they have to overdo it?)

Probably the only things that come clean out of this mess are the voice work and the musical score by Robert Folk.  Campbell, Harris, Duncan, Plummer, and squeaky Ellen Greene (as Goldie) all do the best they can with their characters, although Toby Scott-Granger's childish speech impediment does get in the way of his portrayal of Edmond (although considering how weak his character is, it's no surprise he doesn't give a memorable performance).  The underscore, as mentioned, is also beautiful, far better than this movie has any right to be.  T.J. Kuenster's dozen songs, on the other hand, are mediocre to bad, particularly the owls' Bach-style numbers, although the ones for Chanticleer are admittingly a lot of fun.

As entertainment, ROCK-A-DOODLE is mostly harmless fare for younger kids.  It has its funny moments, but anyone else older will find this to be uninspired and chaotic.  Considering that this is from the director of THE SECRET OF NIMH, AN AMERICAN TAIL, and THE LAND BEFORE TIME, though, its a disappointing endeavor.  Regrettably, after this movie, Bluth's output would only get worse, with the exceptions of THUMBELINA and ANASTASIA.",1179446400,5,5979,4.948897795591182

Dont believe Amazon's review.  I was 11 years old when Rockadoodle was released and while the plot certainly isn't airtight, I never had a problem following the story.  If nothing else, Rockadoodle succeeds in what should be animations highest goal... fostering the use of one's imagination.

I miss these type of animated movies and don't get me wrong I like Shrek and other CGI movies but the fact about rock a doodle is you got the sense of good action at that time was usually in that time. The part that really got me and will get you if you ever see this movie is the scene close to the ending because it is so ironic and yet so obviouse. You know it's a good movie when you see the ending and slapping yourself upside the head saying it was so obviose and that's because you get into the movie and forget about the beginning and totally focuse on the future parts of the story and just are surprise by the ending. This is good for little kids but this is a must for writers of animated movies and want it to be funny, adventurouse and consider what you think is touching.",1121558400,,866,4.040697674418604

470629,3,6302458900,"When I was little, I watched this movie. Even then, I found it creepy. But the irony of this tale is the fact that I aspired to be the Duke. Those familiar with the film know that he is the villainy owl who likes to dine upon small animals. Not because fo that fact, you cad, but because he has style, wit, and a cool spectacle- thingy. I know, I know.. I'm crazed... But so is ""Rockadoodle.""

The plot is stupid, the songs are about ten seconds each and it is stereotypical as the day is long. But it makes up for it by not trying to disguise itself as anything else.

And it's got a great villain.

But, I'd like to know- has anyone else noticed that the Duke takes something out of his cloak that appears to be a mushroom, eats it, and then the room turns funny colors??? Please.. Don't tell me I'm insane. I think all of these animated films secretly want to drive us mad.

Anyway, it is highly disturbing but I'm certain you'll be pleased. (And no, I don't need a drug test! Though perhaps the owl does..) *cough* Oh, and there's a sexy pheasant. What more could you ask for?",1109808000,3,1080,4.202898550724638

Like eighty-five percent of Don Bluth's movies it features extraneous story development, grotesque character designs and the worst songs in the history of the animated musical. Anyone who lists it as more than two stars needs to have a drug test. But, if you enjoy watching an animated film on the level of a movie from USA Up-All-Night(circa 1988) then this is the animated movie for you. You have to Bluth some credit though, anyone who would try to turn the classic story of Chanticleer into an Elvis Musical has balls, too bad his weren't big enough to pull it off successfully, ""Rock-A-Doodle"" is the beginning(and the best) of a downward spiral of Don Bluth's movies into the depth of B-movie oblivion.",1105056000,6,808,4.6573426573426575
