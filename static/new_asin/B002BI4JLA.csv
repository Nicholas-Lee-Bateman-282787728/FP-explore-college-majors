8361405,5,B002BI4JLA,This is very educational and informative. Pandas in the wild are very beautiful and surprising to watch how this animal lives in the wild. I never knew what they sounded like/what noises they made nor anything about them but that they are just cuddly-cute. Watching this gave me a new perspective and a new respect for this precious animal.,1333238400,3,340,4.779661016949152

As I looked at the DVD cover, I realized it was produced by a well known Japanese TV company. I'd not say the image quality is extremely high, but the rest of it is just so well done.

This is a very educational film that takes the viewers into wild Pandas' lives. It explains the panda's natural habitat in China, a panda's journey from birth to becoming independent and their struggles against humans, the major reason to their declining number in the wild.

It is really awesome to be able to see pandas in the wild without human influence and how they interact with one another.",1321747200,6,604,4.574074074074074
