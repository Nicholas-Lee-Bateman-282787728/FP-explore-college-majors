But once you have this tape and watched it - I could not believe my eyes.

I saw fights boring, and in addition - even battles were not fully!

Each of the 70 minutes I was looking for an interesting battle, but not ... There

were no interesting matches, unprofessional matches!

Bottom line: You should not spend your money and buy it!",1360281600,,422,4.428571428571429
8233363,1,B00005AUEK,"NO COMMENTS. That tape should deserve below 0 stars.
Believe me don't waste your money at all.
Look for ECW and FMW DVD's much better.",1014768000,,134,4.4
8233364,3,B00005AUEK,This was the first tape I bought from XPW home video and at first I thought it was horrible until I saw XPW Baptized In Blood which is really good. If you want to see what XPW is all about than buy this tape and you should also buy XPW Baptized In Blood.,999561600,,254,3.811320754716981
8233365,2,B00005AUEK,"I was extremely disappointed with this video.  I'd heard that there would be matches like Supreme vs. Axl Rotten vs. Kronus, and Candido vs. Homeless Jimmy, but all they showed were clips.  The only full matches were Candido vs. Damien Steele (the exact same one from the much better Babtized in Blood) and the Messiah vs. Johnny Webb, which was less than spectacular.  Everything else was just match clips and clips of people in the fed saying stuff or showing off...  If you want an XPW video, get Baptized in Blood...",989452800,2,520,4.681318681318682
