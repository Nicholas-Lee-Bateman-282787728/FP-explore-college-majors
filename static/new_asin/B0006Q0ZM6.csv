There's not much to it, but if you've stayed at any of the Disney World resorts, you will be able to appreciate it probably more than you would if you haven't. Kids will love it regardless, especially the parade scene. My 2 year old requests this and watches it over and over and over (read: quality cooking, cleaning time). I definitely recommend.",1514764800,,369,4.606060606060606

8042242,4,B0006Q0ZM6,This is an adorable look back to the early days of Walt Disney World. You see the park in all its holiday finery.  My grand son loves it. Only wish Walt Disney World produced more like this. I would recommend this as part of the holiday show lineup.,1201651200,2,249,4.1875
