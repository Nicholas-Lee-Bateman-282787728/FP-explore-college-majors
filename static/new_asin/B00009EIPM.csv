7990775,5,B00009EIPM,"5 of the most known Haunted places in California are shown and talked about in detail:
~ The Winchester Mystery House in San Jose, Ca. (A tour guide takes us inside the Mansion and discusses Sarah Winchester.)
~ Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay (A park ranger talks about the different cells and who was in them as well as a ""Ghost Investigator"".)
~ Old West Mining Town in Bodie, Ca. (A park ranger tells of the stories from the town and shows us various places such as the cemetery there.)
~ The Del Coronado Hotel in San Diego, Ca. (The Beautiful Stranger ""Lottie Bernard"" haunts the Hotel after taking her own life and is discussed.)
~ The Whaley House in San Diego, Ca. (A Curator of the House discusses the 24/7 haunts that occur from those that lived there in mid 1800s.)
  A slideshow of the Whaley House spirit photos are shown in the ""extras"" section. Very good!

I found this program to be really good and although it is not an ""Investigation type"" of DVD whereas ghost hunters go into a location and spend the night doing research, I give it high marks. The information provided on each segment is well done as to the historical aspects of each place and who actually lived there and what took place over the years.

Running time about an hour and has a few extra features with slideshow pictures of ""ghosts"" or what appears to be paranormal activity.
Good Menu with spooky background music and easy selections.",1436659200,3,1427,4.5625
7990776,4,B00009EIPM,"The dvd approaches you on two levels. The obvious first, telling you of 'Ghosts' and a few specific locations. It is not a series of indepth paranormal investagations, but rather a telling the stories of the apparent hauntings, both how they originated and what is being experienced now... which leads into the second, as a tourism DVD. What will you see if you travel here? What will you here if you stay the night there? Will something be watching you after you watch the DVD?",1084838400,18,478,4.635294117647059
