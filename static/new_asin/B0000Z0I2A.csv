I enjoyed it very much and have been looking for a copy on DVD that is designed to be played in the U.S.  So far, all I have found is PAL.",1161216000,,259,3.508771929824561
8004716,5,B0000Z0I2A,"I by accident found out about his WW II P.O.W. drama while looking for another movie online. It sounded interesting, so I purchased it (from the UK). It consists of 6 episodes (about 45 min. each).

The story starts in the 1940 and takes you back to a prison camp for british P.O.W.'s in Germany, where soldiers of different rank, character and background have one duty to fullfill: make a run for it... and get out of the camp.

Great acting and a good story makes this movie/series one of my favorites !!! Anybody who likes WW II/P.O.W. related movies should purchase this one ! I wish Amazon would offer it here in the US, since I am certain a lot of people would enjoy it.",1138924800,2,676,4.357142857142857
