You can tell it was transferred from an older VHS, as lines run across the screen from poor video quality. The sound is equally bad. It says ""enhanced audio"". I'd hate to hear the original, if it really was enhanced. It also claims to be ""digitally remastered"", I doubt it. If you leave the film while playing & go the ""Main Menu"", there are only two options ..Play Movie & Scene Index. It does not retain your stopping point. Try to go back to where you were & it returns to the beginning. One good pint is it's Region Free! The copyright is by Wham! USA. I don't recommend this product.",1321228800,6,744,4.173611111111111
333045,5,630133292X,"I agree that the quality is terrible: transferred from an old videotape, no doubt. Regardless, this film is HILARIOUS!!! After a while, I didn't notice the poor quality, and just roared with laughter at the antics of these connivers. Sandy Dennis's ""John Dean"" steals the show, and Melina Mercouri's take as ""Henry Kissinger"" is nothing short of brilliant - and what a treat to see the husbands (Rip Torn, Eli Wallach, Jerry Stiller) also in the film with their wives (Geraldine Page, Anne Jackson and Anne Meara, respectively). Hopefully, the studio will process a new DVD that is worthy of this film, which is really funny.",1174262400,9,625,4.90566037735849
333046,4,630133292X,"Glenda Jackson, Sandy Dennis and Geraldine Page are all excellent in this little seen film from the 70's.  The script and the acting are very good. The main problem is that this DVD transfer is terrible.  Poor picture and sound.  If you've never seen the film, I recommend it.  If you have seen it, skip this DVD and hope they come out with a better quality DVD in the future.",1084579200,19,376,4.328571428571428
333047,4,630133292X,"Imagine a convent as Watergate and Glenda Jackson as Richard Nixon. Nasty Habits is a parody of Watergate that Lampoons everyone from Sandy Dennis as the John Dean character to Melina Mecouri as Henry Kissenger. It has however been called a ""one line movie"" (You won't have Alexandra to kick around anymore). But I think you have to appreciate it for what it is, a thinly disguised political lampoon of a time that wasn't that funny. I highly recommend it if you're a democrat....",1057622400,16,480,4.726190476190476

7812352,4,630133292X,"The DVD quality is awesome, but extra features may have helped more in the overall package. Even a trailer would've been nice. There are some minor deficiencies in picture quality, but that's more due to the source print than the DVD itself.",1465344000,,241,4.761904761904762

7812354,3,630133292X,Hard to find film.  Movie was in abysmal condition - a fault of the original VHS pressing.  Got right away though.  Thanks,1395878400,,122,4.454545454545454
7812355,5,630133292X,"I remember seeing this when it first came out, just a few years after the Watergate business. Living and working in DC at the time, all my friends were very up on all the nuances unfolding during the scandal, and this movie was so spot on, you could identify pretty much every major player's counterpart in the movie. So many years later, it is still a funny movie, even if you never heard of Woodward and Bernstein, Ehrlichman, Haldeman, or any of the other key people involved.

It's funny, but this movie kind of fell off the radar very quickly and, for years, I thought I may only have imagined that I saw it - I don't recall that it ever hit major theaters or made it to HBO or was on TV. Hmmm, do you suppose that some person or persons in the realm known as ""higher up"" had a hand in burying it?",1393200000,2,802,4.174193548387096
7812356,5,630133292X,"This movie is great fun for those of us who remember Watergate and the whole mess. It takes place in a convent and each character is represented by a nun. Nixon, Kissinger, Dean, all of them are there and it's funny as the day is long. Watch it and have a wonderful time with one of the darkest events in our modern political history.",1372723200,,334,4.234375
