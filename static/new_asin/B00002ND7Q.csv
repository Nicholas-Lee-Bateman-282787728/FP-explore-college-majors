1255669,4,B00002ND7Q,"If I had to pick the greatest band of all time - one that consistently put out great music and great performances for 25 years, it might just have to be Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.  I saw this tour at the Gorge and it  was one of greatest shows I've ever seen.  This band just rocks.  But,  having said that - the DVD could have been better.  This was the 5th night  at the Fillmore West and they looked a little stale. The band mixed it up  with a few different songs that they probably didn't normally play - like  ""Mona"" with Bo Diddley on stage.  I thought the performances were  great - but my dissapointment stems from the songs that aren't on here.  One of the best moments in the concert was when Tom did a version of  ""Gloria"" for one of his encores.  He told a very funny story  during the song.  I was really looking forward to seeing that again.  On  the plus side, he included several new tunes from ""Echo"".  I'm  giving 4 stars instead of 5 because of the songs left off and because the  filming/lighting could have been a little better. And oh yeah, how about  adding some extra stuff in there - like lyrics.  I guess it's good to be  king...Buy this DVD.",944611200,3,1175,4.212669683257919
1255670,3,B00002ND7Q,The selection of songs are very good and the 5.1 is alittle above average.  This dvd is in widescreen only and in this format I thought it was done poorly.  At times Tom's head was cut off creating a distraction.  Also  the  image was blurred throughout with too much color saturation. For the most  part though the performance made the disc enjoyable. You can turn off the  tv and listen to good rock & roll when you tire of watching the video.,943833600,,445,4.353658536585366
1255672,1,B00002ND7Q,"Unwatchable unless you are into strobe lights.

I don't know what kind of Meth this editor was on, but he decided that the longest cut he would allow for one camera angle is like 3 seconds. Seriously, some cuts are like barely 1/2 a second. As a viewer you are constantly being bounced from one camera to another It makes me dizzy trying to watch this concert. I'm glad it is not available anymore.

I was actually at the show at the Fillmore and haven;t watched this since it came out a year or 2 after the show. I pulled it out upon news of his death tonight hoping it wasn't as unwatchable as it once was, but it actually seems worse.",1506902400,4,637,4.213114754098361

I am a new Tom Petty fan and I am not yet familiar with many of his songs.  I enjoyed watching and listening to the songs performed in the film which I am not familiar with.

1255699,5,B00002ND7Q,"I bought 5 copies for friends for x-mas this year as an excuse to buy another copy for myself.  This is the favorite of my collection and I've seen the guys perform many times.

If you claim to like rock and roll then you need this album.  I believe this is the quintessential album.  Here you have the second (or 3rd) iteration of the band and a final glimpse of Howie Epstein.  I first fell in love with this disc in 2000.  I watched it almost daily.  I've weened myself to once every two weeks.

The sound is incredible.  The video is shot differently than you are going to be used to.  I don't want the production to be done as if I'm at the concert.  I want a glimpse of what I missed out on and a carrot for showing up to the next show.  This provides that proper enticement.  It seems like it was an intimate show and the DVD captures and conveys that to the viewing audience.

This DVD is by far one of my favorites in my collection.

The concert has a good mix of old and new tracks and shows how tight the band are and Mike Campbells great guitar work. If you're looking for a Tom Petty Live album and are unsure what one to go for, I'd say this is a good place to start. Love the music, love the band, loved the DVD.

1255713,3,B00002ND7Q,"Heavy emphasis on his Echo material and there were some glaring omissions from his hits.  I also would have preferred a rocking (rather than acoustic) version of ""Even The Losers"".  Still they rocked hard and played a good variety from each period of his career.  Howie Epstein died in 2003 (2-3 years after this gig) but he looked frail and drawn even in this performance.",1265587200,,373,4.707692307692308
1255714,5,B00002ND7Q,"High Grass Dogs is Tom Petty and the Hearbreakers at their best and in their element - LIVE!  The versions of Jammin' Me and Running Down a Dream have a harder edge and really jump start the performance.  I also loved their cover of Mona w/Bo Diddley - really a classic moment.  It is also nice to have a video record of Swingin with Howie Epstein singing the bridge.  The Fillmore is a wonderfully intimate setting creating a much different atmosphere than arena shows.  Two things jump off the screen.
The first is how much these guys enjoy playing with each other.  Second is their versatility and range.
If you like slick video productions this one may not be for you.  At times the music and the video don't sync up.  Also, the video bridges between songs a confusing at times.  Overall, this is a great dvd.",1254873600,4,813,4.476190476190476
1255715,4,B00002ND7Q,"Tom Petty is as good a songwriter and performer as you'll find. This is his best concert DVD, by far. It's not flashy, it's just your straight-forward concert with strong performances from many stops along his illustrious career. He lets each of his bandmates deliver their performances without gimmicks and without over-production. The guitar work by Mike Campbell is stellar as you would expect from Petty's co-captain. The rest of the hearbreakers deliver as well.
This is a great DVD for either the casual Petty fan, or the die-hard. As the years go by, I find myself listening to Tom Petty (and the Heartbreakers) more and more, and appreciating his writing and musicianship and understated singing more and more as well.
Tom is like a comfortable garment that just fits better and better and gets more comfortable with each wearing. No disrespect intended here, please understand, I think Petty is a genius. He has grown over the many years he has been entertaining us into something greater than we imagined possible.
There are some good performances on this disc, and some great performances. ""Jammin' Me"", ""Swingin'"" ""Mary Jane's Last Dance"" and ""You Wreck Me"" are all incredible performances, caught forever on this DVD for repeated viewing and listening. With the original Hearbreakers lineup included, this is a definite keeper for your concert collection.",1229817600,,1368,5.139013452914798
1255716,5,B00002ND7Q,"I've watched all the various Tom Petty and Heartbreaker's DVDs available, and this is the best of the bunch.  The whole set Runnin' Down a Dream taken together may be better, but otherwise, this is the best concert footage of Tom Petty that I've found, and I find myself watching this one over and over.  The Bo Diddly visit for Mona is just awesome, the respect that this band pays him is fantastic to see and puts them on the level of the Rolling Stones in that sense of paying proper dues to the blues.

In every other way, this is a band so happy to be playing together in this footage, right from from the fantastic first track (Jammin' Me) that it's really a great DVD to watch.  Order this, you will not regret it.",1220140800,,721,4.279411764705882
1255717,4,B00002ND7Q,"Tom Petty's concert at the Fillmore was to promote the new Echoes album back in '99. Great year and great performance. This is one of the last times that we get to see Howie Epstein play with Tom, and he does an amazing job performing. The setlist is great, but a bit lacking compared to Tom's recent shows. Scott and Steve also make fantastic additions to the Heartbreakers along side ""co-pilot"" Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench. DVD quality is not the best (remember that this is a '99 DVD), but direction is fantastic. I love the little behind-the-scenes parts in between the songs. The camera direction really gives an intimate feel to this small arena. All in all, it's great eye and ear candy for the average Tom Petty fan.",1219622400,3,728,4.607692307692307
1255718,4,B00002ND7Q,"I thought the sound was fantastic, earthy and clear. Every instrument could be heard. I enjoyed it immensely. However watching it? I could only take it in small doses because the quick cut style got to be really annoying after 3 songs. Some great moments were captured, and Tom's smile is worth the price of admission, but I tend to like the Martin Scorsese style in The Last Waltz...keep the camera still and let us absorb the charisma of the artists.
Still.... an exciting show which included the super talented bassist ( sadly missed) Howie E.",1197936000,3,546,4.697916666666667
1255719,3,B00002ND7Q,"All Tom Petty things are great, but this wasn't my favorite. Its good, but not the best Ive seen. Still worth buying if you're a big Tom Petty fan like I am, but I'd go for the Runnin Down A Dream video if you want something really cool from Tom Petty. This video was kind of different because it would show random things happening back stage while the concert is going on, and I think that detracted from the concert. Still great songs and great performance by Tom & The Heartbreakers though.",1196380800,5,493,4.369565217391305

My friends and I went to night after night of this historic run at the Fillmore (one of two long runs in a couple of years that they did). I don't think Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers were ever before or have since been so good! And I've been seeing them since I was 15 (now 42!). Unbelievable shows. Rock and roll doesn't get any better! It was a shining moment for both the Fillmore and TP and the HB's. Get your copy of this.....kind of like a little slice of rock and roll history. Not quite ""The Last Waltz"", but still amazing! In fact, it was one of the last shows where we slept in line for the tickets.....before the computer took the social aspect out of waiting in line with your fellow fans! Nowadays the tickets would be ""auctioned"" to the highest bidder......at the Fillmore, it was those of us who really wanted to be there bad enough to sleep on a cold sidewalk and get in the front rows to be included in the DVD!",1181520000,4,1079,4.217391304347826

1255728,5,B00002ND7Q,EXCELLENT !!! It puts you in the front row.  A must have concert.,1121212800,4,65,4.0
1255729,5,B00002ND7Q,"I have seen Tom Petty and the boys live many times and I'm a naturalist fan - that is, I don't just like the hits and often feel the overlooked stuff is better or as good as the standards.  Petty and Co. make great albums, but where they shine is live, so when I say this is the best of the live DVDs I am basing that on three things.  1)The accuracy to which it captures a true Heartbreakers show, 2)How many times one would watch/listen to it and 3) should anyone other than Petty die-hards need apply.

First, the performance takes place at the Filmore which is a theatre/club.  This does not allow the band to play as they do in arenas, but the whole thing works.  There is energy, but also a intimate feel - very nice.  It also does what good concert DVDs should do and makes the viewer feel, if not like they are there, at least what it must have been like to be there (to be fair, this is an eassier feat given the club setting vs, say, a stadium).  This also reminded me of Petty's hilarious performance on VH1's Storytellers from around the same time.  Anything that makes me think of that is aces in my book (if only that were on DVD).

The songs are great and great to hear live.  Since there is no recent live Petty album this can double as such.  The opening one-two punch of ""Jammin' Me"" and ""Runnin' Down a Dream,"" kicks ass!  This how a show I saw on that tour began and as far as I'm concerned its how every show should begin.  And while we're talking about it, this version of ""Jammin' Me"" is so good it gave me a new found respect for a song that always seemed like an oddity in the Heartbreakers stash.  Don't get me wrong, it rocks (love Mike's guitar and the more agressive vocal from Tom), but it doesn't jive well inserted with their hits - chronologicly it falls somewhere between ""Don't Come Around Here..."" and ""Free Fallin',"" but its not just that; it feels rather 80s-ish, whereas most of their other singles have more of a timeless feel.  But here the tune is loose, loud, and we are having fun watching it because the boys are having fun playing it.  We also get great songs from the underrated ""Echo,"" and thank God for some tracks from ""She's the One.""  There is something of a lull just before the encores where they play at least one too many slow songs in a row, but they soon ralley for a set of rockers, including a harder ""You Wreck Me.""

There are of course too many Petty Hits to fully include them all here so some may be bummed their favorite song didn't make the cut, but that alomst goes without saying for any long-running act at a live show; that's the way it goes, but what is here is all done so well, the set feels complete.

Second, I have had this since it came out in fall of '99.  I'm writing the review now because I am watching it again, as I do often.  It doesn't get old and DVD is great cause you can jump right to the ""Jammin' Me's"" and the ""Mary Jane's"" of the set.  I use it as much as a live album to listen to as I do a concert to watch.  I wish it were available on CD.

And thirdly, fans, and I obviously am one, won't be disapointed; and non-fans may just be converted.  The guys had their A-Game on this night.

I have seen some reviews complaining about the filming; cuts, shakiness, etc...  I may have comented on that myself way back when, but I honestly haven't thought twice about it.  In my opinion its neither a plus or a minus.

The other Petty DVDs are good as well, but this is the only one that depicts a typical live show.  The Soundstage one is filled with covers and light on Heartbreakers hits (which isn't a bad thing, I rather enjoy hearing some of that stuff, but its from PBS so there is a slow, artsy-fartsiness to the whole thing) and ""Live at the Olympic"" is a run-through of the ""Last DJ"" album cover to cover with 5 or so bonus past hits at the end as encores.  I like ""Last DJ,"" but many didn't.  If you are one of those, skip that DVD.

Regardless, this Filmore one would be the one to have anyway.  Simply put, It's Great.",1107216000,69,4017,4.18075422626788

THE CAMERAS JUMP AROUND AS IF THE EDITOR HAD JUST DRANK ABOUT 50 CUPS OF COFFEE BEFOR ENTERING THE EDIT ROOM.I DON'T THINK THERE IS 1 CAMERA SHOT THATS STAYS ON THE SUBJECT FOR MORE THAN 5 SECONDS. VERY HARD TO WATCH. SECONDLY, THERE ARE A LOT OF FILL SHOTS. EVERYTHING FROM THE BASS PLAYERS BOOTS TO THE BACKS OF PEOPLE OUT OF FOCUS AND TOTALLY OUT OF FOCUS SHOTS OF WHAT I DON'T KNOW. I'M SURPRISED TOM PETTY SIGNED OFF ON THIS PROJECT AS BAD AS IT IS.TOM AND THE BAND PLAYED THEIR COLLECTIVE BUTTS OFF ONLY TO BE RUINED BY BAD, BAD, EDITING!",1055548800,6,714,4.218978102189781
1255734,5,B00002ND7Q,This is a great concert in a very historic place. The sound quality on the DVD is incredible. The camera work is to bring the fan closer into the performance and what it takes backstage to make it happen.  If you been to his concert you will recognize all his moves and if not then you are in for a show. The only thing I can criticize is the packaging is very cheep. What would it cost to include a CD of the songs along and liner notes? I bet pennies on the dollar. I say all his fans should write Tom and tell him to make the record company include these on his next DVD.  He must feel the same way about them for he tells the story of the record company's greed with his latest CD.,1050710400,2,685,3.9565217391304346
1255735,4,B00002ND7Q,"As someone who has seen Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers live almost a dozen times in various venues, I can say this DVD does a great job of capturing the essence of the band in concert, particularly their shows from the past five years. The most consistent live act I have ever seen, The Heartbreakers are in typically outstanding form in the shows recorded for the DVD. The sound on the DVD is great, and the presentation of the material is well paced. While this DVD is a MUST have for true Tom Petty fans, casual fans will enjoy it as well. For those somewhat familiar with the band's work, the DVD will show them what they have missed if they have not seen the Heartbreakers live.
I love this DVD and am sure I'll watch it a few thousand times, but there were a few things that kept me from giving it 5 stars. First, I would have liked to have seen more focus on Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench. Their musicianship is a big reason why the Heartbreakers are one of the greatest American bands of all time and head and shoulders above most other bands touring today. Aside from a nice scene of Campbell tearing up the solo on ""Running Down a Dream,"" there are few shots of his work. I found this disappointing since his six string IS the guitar voice of Tom Petty, and anyone who has seen the band live knows what Campbell can do with the instrument and how big a part he plays in the live shows. Second, I think the directing could have been a little less ""heavy handed."" There's a few ""artsy"" shots and cut-aways I would have preferred seeing replaced by wide-screen stage shots that would have given the viewer a greater sense of being there. Finally, I would have liked to have seen more ""extras"" on the DVD. One of the nice things about the format of the DVD is you get material you can't find anywhere else. I would have liked to seen some band interviews, lyrics, behind the scene stuff -- anything else. All the DVD offers is the concert, with the option of choosing songs. I found that surprising since Tom Petty has always been at the cutting edge of music video.
Those shortcomings should not detract anyone from buying this DVD, however. Overall, it is a good look at one of the best bands in the world.",1044835200,12,2217,4.37046004842615
1255736,4,B00002ND7Q,"I am evaluating this as a small part of an old Tom Petty collection.  I wish more of my music collection was on DVD so I had more opportunity to see who was producing the music, and how it was done.  On this DVD, the guitar solo by Bo Diddley while Tom Petty is singing ""Mona"" is filmed well enough to convince me that Bo Diddley was doing plenty of notes, even when he wasn't singing.  Musically, I was trained to understand Mozart and his ilk, a standard selection of melodic phrases that sound like a single composer always had the tune in mind, so I am amazed that Tom Petty can sing that song like it has a tune, which it does, but in a blues idiom that never sticks in my mind firmly enough to whistle, while there is so much else going on.
There is some audience interaction, with Tom telling the crowd, ""I have to sing a song right now,"" when some introduction gets some of the people excited enough for Tom to feel it, too.  2003 might be a big year for me to witness how people recover from mistakes.  The beginning of ""Even the Losers,"" (selection 11) starts with a nice guitar part, but the first verse wasn't perfect, so it went into a few attempts, and a lot of the trouble seem to fall on expecting any one person to accomplish so much within a short period of time.  Music can be great when it is simple, but Tom Petty is the kind of creative genius who would rather startle people with something way beyond whatever was expected.  Anticipation is such a large part of appreciating his music that ""The waiting is the hardest part"" became a favorite line in the video ""Pack Up the Plantation.""  That was a long time ago, and I might not like anything that has been recorded since 1999 as much as I liked ""Needles and Pins,"" an old tune that was a big reason I bought ""Pack Up the Plantation"" as a double LP before discovering that it wasn't on the Plantation video.  What is great in ""Needles and Pins"" was ""I saw her face, it was a face I loved.""  I think people who listen to music feel that way so often that I'm surprised how often I had to ask myself, *whose face was that?* before I knew that only four of the faces in this DVD concert were older versions of people on the ""Pack Up the Plantation"" tour.
""Jammin' Me"" is not one of my favorite songs, but it names enough people to show what kind of society we live in, in a way that might even hurt, if people don't know what you're doing.  Tom Petty found a way of using people's names in his song ""Swingin' "" that must have been new in 1999, but which I seem to emulate in a lot of reviews.  Sonny Liston and Benny Goodman went down swinging to different beats, and too many of my reviews have come out like ""Mary Jane's Last Dance.""  I don't think people should make up their mind about that song by the weird video that introduced it to MTV viewers.  This performance reduces the song to its musical elements, and this kind of DVD is best for people who are most curious about how they do that on a musical level.  It's not creepy when they are just singing it.  People who freaked out ought to lighten up already.",1044057600,,3088,4.208474576271186
1255737,5,B00002ND7Q,"Petty and his band improves with age. Everytime I buy their newest CD or see Petty and his 'Heartbreakers' in concert I say- these guys are at the top of their game. And 'High Grass Dogs-Live from the Fillmore' is no exception. Captured on the final night of a five night gig at the Fillmore, Petty gets the proceedings off to a rousing start with 'Jammin Me' and 'Runnin' Down a Dream' great songs of course, but let's get the more tired tunes out of the way to make room for the exceptional material from the 'Echo' album. Doing just that Petty intros 'Swingin', which is simply, a rock masterpiece. After that, Petty keeps it easy, casually moving into 'Breakdown', and 'Listen to her Heart'. These guys are having fun- one gets the sense that they are still doing this because they love music, not to throw another million or two into the bank. Petty forges a connection with his audience that is real. Never one to get lost in elaborate sets, props or costumes, you still get the feeling that you are in the middle of a full blown rock concert- with real musicians. But Petty gets to have fun too, hamming it up as he introduces Bo Diddley. They perform 'Mona'- and the aging legend has no problem keeping up with the rest of the band- and the result is glorious. Peppered with footage from a camera filming backstage while the band plays on, the idea is to document the event- not to try and create a mood- it's already there. When a female roadie is asked how the show went- she says simply 'It was a great show- any other questions?' It's a real moment, not scripted. And that's what Petty is. Real.",995673600,10,1607,4.4324324324324325

I have bought this one six months ago, and believe me, I still listen to it as if I had bought it yesterday. It's a great show indeed, which proves how talented Tom Petty is with the Heartbreakers playing the most  simple instruments. On the other hand the image is not superb,I don't think that the widescreen format was a good idea, but in overall the DVD is fantastic.",990576000,4,524,4.346938775510204

Overall, the DVD had great atmostphere, partially due to backstage cutaways of the production crew.

Plus it was energetically directed, with great shots of all the band members, back up singers, etc...One of the best concert videos ever. Compared to that, and many other live concerts on the market, this one is a drag. Overall it's a lackluster performance, the camerawork, editing, and overall pace of the production is sluggish. The greatest insult is the cutaways of individual bandmembers that are not even in sync with the soundtrack. Tht tells me that this show was undershot, and consequently over edited. Essentially sucking the life out of what was probably a good show in person, but feels amd looks tepid on DVD. One highlight: The inclusion of ""Listen to Her Heart"".

Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers have been going at it for almost 25 years, and they can still put on a live  show that keeps 'em dancing in the aisles and shouting for more. You'll  start jumping at the first sound of Petty's Rickenbacker as the show starts  with that great rocker, ""Jammin' Me"".

1255745,4,B00002ND7Q,"The performance that Petty puts on in this DVD is wonderful.  What some don't realize about Petty's songs is that they aren't ment to have much bass behind them at all.  That is one thing that fit well into this DVD.  In Petty's songs, the bass is there for a little bit of hidden life, and if  you try to put more bass in the songs than it already has, than you're  ruining the style that Petty has always had with him.  Petty knows what  he's doing when overlays instruments, and you can trust that bass was ment  to be hidden.  If you know what to listen to then you can hear the bass.  When Bo Diddley comes out onstage, his presence is heard round the world.  While Bo is onstage I love how Petty is gawking at him while he's soloing  over his song.  Not only is Bo's stage presence felt, but Petty is well  received by the audience, too.",952992000,,843,4.15527950310559

This is an up close and personal filming of the concert...no bells,  no whistles.  No fancy lighting or pyrotechnics.  Just the band, the music,  and the crowd.
The sound is incredible. it has Dolby Digital 5.1, and  with surround the crowd noise is behind you, the music in front of you...it  really feels like you're in the front row.

Opening with an incredible ""Jammin' Me"", Petty and his ultra-dependable Heartbreakers tear through a set of standards and ""Echo"" rockers that put you in the front seat.  Soundwise, this can't be beat. Visually, there's none of the herky-jerky  style that some directors favor (see REM's ""Road Movie"" for a  dizzying example of that genre). From the tour of the summer last year  (sorry Bruce) comes this souvenir of great rock and roll and Petty's  dedication to his craft. Well worth the cost and well worth watching a  number of times.",948672000,3,564,4.946808510638298

1255749,4,B00002ND7Q,"It's too bad this wasn't released as an audio cd or double live album.  It really has some terrific songs -- all of Petty's finest -- and a few overlooked or retooled gems.  However, the direction of the concert film is  slipshod.  While the widescreen presentation is nice, there are too many  artsy cuts and a tired overuse of extreme closeups of unnecessary scenes.  Do I really want to get a gander of Tom's posterior filling the screen?  I'd have much rathered some tight, uninterrupted shots of Mike Campbell's  fab guitar manipulations or Benmont Tench's killer keyboard work.  Instead,  there is a distracting, frenetic pace that doesn't let you focus on any one  thing too long before it cuts to another.  Someone should have told the  producers that this wasn't a pop video.  A more lingering view of the stage  and wider shots of the band going through their excellent setlist would  have been far preferable and afforded the viewer a ""you are  there"" sense of belonging.  Instead, you get the feeling that you've  stumbled on an Oliver Stone attempt at a 90-minute music video.  There are  good moments:  Seeing Bo Diddley on stage with the guys for  ""Mona"" was great fun and Petty did have some lighthearded moments  before ""Even the Losers.""  However, this DVD is hamstrung by the  visual masturbation of the director.  As a diehard Petty fan, I love the  sound of this concert film but I can't give it a fifth star.  Buy this for  the music.  That aspect is a five star for sure.  The video brings the  whole experience down a notch.  And that is saying something when  discussing the Heartbreakers' ability to mesmerize and enthrall.

1255750,3,B00002ND7Q,"Tom Petty is one of the best ever. People leave his shows awestruck. A film of a concert should make you feel as if you were there, as part of the audience. It should not make you feel as though your head were a ping pong  ball being bounced about at two-second intervals by nine different  cameramen, none of whom seem to be able to get a decent view. Why oh why  must the filmmakers try to upstage the band when they are making these  things? It never, ever works. To the powers that be: Please, please, please  release Tom Petty's Pack Up The Plantation film on DVD. It is a wonderful  perfomance and a much better film than this one.

You really get the sense that you are in the Fillmore looking at the entire  stage rather than just a portion of it.  The director also manages to bring  out the personality of the Fillmore by letting a camera roam around the  hallways and back rooms between songs.  Petty and the Heartbreakers turn in  an incredible performance taking songs mainly from their last 3 albums but  with enough classics to please everybody.  And never once does the band  look like they are performing for the cameras.  Highly recommended!,945648000,,663,4.769911504424779

Anyway ...buy this ...it's full of emotion and raw room acoustics.  You also see Tom as so so ...kindhearted as he is lovingly candid with his audience as he restarts ""even the loosers"" 3 times as he tries to reach the high vocal late in the set with just he and his guitar.
