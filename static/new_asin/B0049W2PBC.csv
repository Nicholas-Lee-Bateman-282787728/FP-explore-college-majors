I am reviewing this particular video for only one reason and that is the content. I thought it was excellent and informative and for my older kids, completely appropriate. In an attempt to answer my 7 year old's question about the workings of the inner eye, I ordered this and we watched it together.

There is one segment that the video explains about a glass eye. The guest lost an eye in childhood and so they were fitting her with a glass eye. While I found it absolutely fascinating, my daughter was a little overwhelmed with the empty eye socket it showed and became very worried about the guest on the show. Had I known the content was there, I would have either prepared my daughter for it or skipped that segment all together.

So, to summarize, it is wonderfully informative. Just be aware of the empty eye socket segment and prepare your child for it if necessary.",1383177600,,1036,4.357512953367876
