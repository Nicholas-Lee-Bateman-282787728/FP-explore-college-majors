1350378,4,B00004TJGC,"Panda Kopanda (Panda! Go Panda!) was a 30 minute movie made in 1972. Animation super-creator Hayao Miyazaki created the original idea, the script, the layouts, and did key animation, and Isao Takahata directed the film. A 1973 sequel, Panda Kopanda: Amefuri Saakasu no Maki (Panda Kopanda & the Rainy-day Circus), continues the story and was made by the same people who made the first movie. The literal translation of the title Panda Kopanda is ""Panda, Baby Panda"", but it's been released as ""Panda Go Panda"" (basically because that's what the song sounds like.)
The movies were made at a time when ""panda fever"" was sweeping Japan. China donated a pair of pandas to Japan, and the public was very into them. These two movies are considered by many to be prototypes of Miyazake's My Neighbor Totoro due to the similar character designs and child-friendly nature throughout the films.

The story goes something like this: Mimiko's grandma is leaving to visit some friends, and must leave little Mimiko by herself. (I guess they can do that in Japan, eh...) After finally persuading her Grandma to leave, and seeing her off on the train, Mimiko returns home to find by her house a tiny, baby panda. It turns out he's not a toy, but real (named Kopanda), and they quickly become friends and then big Panda (Papanda-San) arrives. He's VERY big and very friendly. Since the house had a beautiful bamboo forest (pandas eat bamboo), they decided to live with her. The three became a family. Wacky adventures ensue...

The sequel, ""Panda Kopanda and the Rainy Day Circus"" is quite similar, with Grandma away again, (where is she going?) but this time with a circus arriving (complete with a cute baby Tiger who becomes friends with Kopanda), and a rainy day that rains so much that the rain floods up to Mimiko's house. Mimiko and the Pandas save the animals who are trapped in the circus train underwater.
The Panda Go Panda DVD combines the two features on one volume. If you liked Totoro, then there are elements here you will enjoy too. Although nowhere near as complex (visually or in narrative) Panda! Go Panda! has overwhelming charm and storybook simplicity. The features were made just for children, so keep that in mind. They're just plain fun.",1005696000,8,2247,4.833766233766234
1350379,4,B00004TJGC,"My 2 1/2 year old son is rapidly wearing out the tape.  It features cute animals with exciting (but not too dangerous) adventures, befriended by adorable Mimiko.  The circus train scenes are great.  If you're a die-hard anime fan, it will probably disappoint, but if you're a parent looking for a truly gentle G-rated film this is it.  It also gives glimpses of typical Japanese life (school life, curry-and-rice dinners, etc.) which might be interesting for older viewers.",973641600,9,473,5.0256410256410255
1350380,4,B00004TJGC,"This one is a bit difficult to rate because there are certainly some  faults that can be leveled at it.  While Miyazaki is world famous for  creating works for young people that will be equally enjoyed by adults,  Panda! Go Panda! does not quite live up to that standard.  Some of these  parts will only be enjoyable by the 6 year olds they are aimed at, but this  is relatively infrequent.  Also, the plot is at times seemingly weak for  Miyazaki, while still being above standards for this sort of film.  Personally I found the original soundtrack (not the new one used in the  dub) to be very enjoyable, and the entire film has a wonderful  whimsical-like quality that is to be found only in classic children  literature.  And mentioning children lit, Panda is steeped int references,  though some may be more obscure (in the second short, there are a few  minutes that seem directly taken from one of Jansson's Moomin books,  something relatively unknown in the US but nonetheless quite well known in  the international scene.)  Where the film falls short is in the low level  of animation (but it is still quite identifiably the people who would later  make Totoro) and the sometimes pedestrial plot, but still delivers  consistantly enough not to dissapoint.  This will be true especially for  people who have enjoyed Totoro or other works by Miyazaki.
Lastly, while  this certainly isn't the release I had been hoping for, with so much of  Miyazaki's/studio Ghibli's work unavailable in this country or caught up in  lengthy delays, this may be the fix to get you through the long months  ahead.",965952000,8,1602,4.769230769230769
1350381,3,B00004TJGC,"This movie is just like all the other reviews say: Cute.

People are going nuts, saying Miyazaki did such a good job. He only wrote it, and recycled it from stroyboards for some of his other movies. Made in 1972, this was directed by Isao Takahata, the other prolific director at Studio Ghibli (he did Grave of the Fireflies). It has two shorts on one disc, both being just under 40 minutes, with a run time of something like 75 minutes.

It's the story of Mimiko, a little girl who lives in a bamboo grove with her grandmother. In the first episode,""Panda Family"", Her grandmother must attend a memorial service for grandfather, and leaves for Nagasaki with Mimiko taking care of herself. She has no fear or knowledge of the bad in the world, being trusting and kind to all. Once she gets back from seeing Grandma to the trainstation, she is surprised to find a baby panda, and soon meets his huge father, Papa Panda. So, little 'Panny', Mimiko, and Papa make a deal. Mimiko wants a dad and Panny needs a mom. So, they all become a family. Mimiko tells Panny he must stay home while she goes to school, and convinces Papa he has to go to work like all fathers do. He does, with hat and briefcase, bento and a smile. But Panny follows Mimiko to school with disatrous results. In the second episode, called ""Circus in the Rain"" the ringmaster and his lacky follow the tracks of a baby tiger to the Panda family house, and when the family finds the two, they are ecstatic to finally meet 'bandits'. But more mayhem when a flood ensues, and Papa must rescue the family.

The transfer is pretty crummy, looking about as it probably did in '72-'73, on TV. The audio matches, and background voices and sound effects are hard to notice unless you've got the subtitles on. Make sure and stick to the cuter japanese version (i think the vhs is only english, as though anyone still uses VHS...).

Geneon has left out any special features, and barely has a menu. This and the poor TV quality is what takes these Ghibli and anime vets hard work and shaves one and a half stars. Overall, rent it. But, if you have kids or went nuts over this one, you might get one used for a good price. If there are kids in the house (under five) though, you need to start them here, if you want them to experience some quality kids animation.",1129593600,,2315,4.414519906323185
1350382,5,B00004TJGC,This DVD contains two early short films by the two men Hayao Miyazaki & Isao Takahata that would form Studio Ghibli.  Many fans consider the two Panda films to be the prototypes for My Neighbor Totoro.  Pioneer has done a good job on this DVD release.  The old school character designs might turn off some modern anime fans though.,1114128000,,331,4.576271186440678
1350383,5,B00004TJGC,"I got it new from Amazon with vary little info about the movie. (two short ones together) I heard that the movie is kiddy crap and not good for older age people like myself. I also read some reviews about the DVD on Animeondvd.com and they highly recommended it. And since Hayao Miyazaki had a hand in this movie I went on and buy it. The DVD menu is well design, but the most im happy about is the Jap dub being so original; even the music is original and not the same as the Eng dub. (with some anime DVDs they just put the Jap dub voice but not the original music) The story is short but simple and the characters are likable from the start. Im glad I got it and as for it being ""kiddy crap"".... its not. All ages will enjoy this flick.",1113696000,2,739,4.034013605442177
1350384,4,B00004TJGC,"I saw this film twice and its really cute.  I'm an adult, so its not something I would watch as often as Spirited Away or Castle in the Sky.  Its great for kids, but doesn't quite satisfy adults.",1051488000,3,195,4.105263157894737
1350385,4,B00004TJGC,"One of my daughter's favorites. And I read the synop. above and don't be fooled, the animation here is not that high quality,beautiful animation that you see with Kiki's Delvery Service or Totoro. However, the stories are very cute and sweet and young kids will love the independent little girl who befriends a Panda Papa and his Little One.
The stories are about a little girl who meets the pandas and takes care of them. This is not a Kratt Brother's show,the animals are much more human-y than Panda-y. The little girl cooks for them and they eat Curry. There's lots of adventure when the young Panda follows the little girl to school. The second story is about a train of Circus animals and a flood, but there's nothing frightening, as Papa Panda comes to the rescue and everyone is safe and sound.
The animation is simplistic, but still good and the stories are interesting but won't over-excite or frighten your child. And you'll find yourself humming the theme song over and over again, whether you like it or not . . .",1047600000,13,1026,4.612021857923497
1350386,5,B00004TJGC,I bought this item solely based on the fact that Hayao Miyazaki was involved in its production. It is a very cute story and there are hints of his later work here. If you enjoy cute non-action oriented animation you will probably love this title. If you need lots of fight scenes and supernatural powers in your anime then why are you even reading this review? Just buy it.,1031529600,,373,4.420289855072464
1350387,4,B00004TJGC,"I picked this up for my niece and nephew (ages 4 & 5), who are both devoted ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" fans.  I was pretty excited that they loved Miyazaki, and wanted to keep them interested.
Well, they loved ""Panda! Go Panda!"" just as much as the other films.  I was told they watched it five times in a row.  Yay for Uncle Zack!
Of all of Miyazaki's films, this one is truly aimed at the younger crowd.  There is very little of the multi-level storytelling that you will find in his later films.  The pandas (who talk, by the way.  I was pretty surprised by this, as Totoro does not talk.) are bundles of cuteness.  The animation is decent, with lots of bright kid-friendly colors.  The DVD is great, as it offers both an English and Japanese soundtrack.  (It's a good film for people learning Japanese, because the vocab is limited.) This is very rare for imported kid's films.
And, I liked ""Panda! Go Panda!"" too.  It's fun, light fare.",1019692800,32,965,4.494252873563219
1350388,5,B00004TJGC,"Well Hayao Muyazaki did it again, or not quite again seeing how old this is.
I got the DVD a few days ago and I sat down and watched it.  I can't say that I was surprised, but I was very happy with the purchase.  Its a very cute 2 30 minute movies, VERY VERY cute.  Some might find it too sugary, but if you like classic anime, this is where to go!  The animation is SO ahead of it's time, like all of his work. It looked like it could have been made in the early 80s.  The other great thing about this DVD is the menus, the are so alive and  well animated.
If you like Miyazaki, or cute stuff, or have a young child in the house. GET THIS DVD!
Heck show your kids the Subtitled version, it will get em reading, and it is SO much better than the dub.",1019347200,4,750,3.8376623376623376
1350389,5,B00004TJGC,"Panda Go Panda will now be added to my family's growing collection of children's Anime titles. Along with Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, Secret of the Seal and Prince Mononoke (I'd call this PG-10 for violence), we have fallen in love with the odd characters and quirky situations posed in all of these movies.
Each of these movies underscores appreciation for the balance among man and nature.
Even my 4 year old son will sit through subtitled Japanese cartoons now!
Night on the Celestial Railroad is also in this vein, only much darker.",1015372800,6,541,4.891304347826087
1350390,5,B00004TJGC,"I guess I'm a kid at heart as I'm > 30 and I love it.
I've got the DVD and of course can't stand the DUB, and I always watch it with the SUB.  Hora! Hora! Mitte! Mitte! Tabemasho ka?
Panchan, Papandasan and Mimikochan are the bomb.  Torachan is pretty cool too.
Japanese is in mono audio, English is in stereo.  2 episodes.
I think I like it less than Kiki and more than Totoro.",1012348800,3,378,4.013333333333334

7922535,5,B00004TJGC,this is a pretty good movie. i rented it from the libary not knowing what it was. i watched and was impressed on how well it was made. this is a great movie for the whole family. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do,1305763200,,234,3.795918367346939
7922536,5,B00004TJGC,"""Panda, Go Panda!"" was created by Mr. Miyazaki and Mr. Takahata before their Studio Ghibli days.  This movie is old (1972, I believe), and you can pretty much tell by the simplistic animation quality and sound quality.  However, it's cuteness really shines through--and I personally think that it doesn't look too bad even by today's standards.

Anyway, ""Panda, Go Panda!"" is actually two 30-minute tv episodes rather than one long movie.  The first episode (""The Panda Family"") tells the story of how the pandas came to live with the Mimiko (the main character).  Episode 2 (""The Circus in the Rain"") involves a lost baby tiger from the circus who happens to wander into the panda's house.  Anyway, both episodes are delightfully amusing and fun, and I only wish they had made more of them.  I think the one thing I like most is Papa Panda's voice in the English dub--it's hilarious!  That might be the entire reason I love this movie so much!

Overall, I can't recommend this enough.  While I think this is a great children's movie, I think it can be enjoyable for adults too who are open-minding and just looking for some silly fun.",1232928000,,1135,4.715736040609137
7922537,5,B00004TJGC,"This movie is pure goodness and joy!

Trust me, it's equivalent to years of psychological therapy, working like a pill against pessimism of all degrees!

Mimiko's everlasting euphory sticks to you as you're watching this funny piece. Witnessing the way she and the other characters deal with everything that happens to them, so lightly and without any trace of resetment, is a true inspiration to life!
This is how we should live as well, as children who can be infinitely happy just by standing on the top of their heads!
This is actually the message of this film and of the movie ""My good friend Totoro"", which is a sort of an evolved version of this one: both of them command us to laugh and be cheerful no matter what happens (don't forget Mimiko is an orphan), because life can be so magical in every small detail of it.
It's only up to us to brighten our minds and take the whole world with us, upon our train of humorous existential extasy!

Just a note for those of you who wonder whether this movie is meant only for kids:
I'm 24 y/o and I feel this movie can appeal to each and every heart that wishes to crack its bitterness and open to love with no limits.

Lastly, you must admit that papa panda's smile on the cover is unmistakably irresistible :)
(and the opening song will also become a welcome guest in your memory )

So go and rent the blessed thing! You won't regret it!",1224374400,,1389,4.389105058365759
7922538,4,B00004TJGC,"`Panda Go Panda' is not only one of the earliest works by animation film maestro Hayao Miyazaki; it is also a lovely, delightful and imaginative story about a cute little girl and two pandas. Meet a feisty little girl named Mimiko living with two pandas in a little house surrounded by bamboo forest. The DVD has two episodes, both of which are about 30 minutes: ""Panda Family"" and ""The Circus in the Rain.""

[PANDA FAMILY] You will see Mimiko's grandmother reluctantly boarding a train, leaving her granddaughter behind alone. But Mimiko is not lonely, because she finds a baby panda in her garden. Soon after Mimiko becomes a friend with the little panda, another (much bigger) panda arrives, who turns out the baby panda's daddy. Mimiko asks the bigger panda to be HER daddy, too because, as it turns out, she is a child with no parents (the situation repeatedly seen in Miyazaki's works), and wacky adventures begin.

[PANDA FAMILY] was released in 1972 when Japanese people were all into two pandas in Ueno Zoo in Tokyo, sent from mainland China to promote friendship between two nations. This short film was theatrically released as part of Toho's triple-feature show (the other two were monster flicks, including the one featuring Godzilla).

[THE CIRCUS IN THE RAIN] was released in 1973. It introduces a strayed baby tiger who ran away from the circus troupe visiting Mimiko's town. The short film has notable characteristics, Miyazaki's wild imagination and creative ideas - for example, railway train running underwater - and Mimiko's unpredictable adventure story is always amusing and comical, something you will see only in Miyazaki's imaginative world.

Both films share the same traits as Miyazaki's later works like `My Neighbor Totoro' - see the movement of the characters in the opening credits, the face (and the mouth) of the daddy panda, etc. - and of course, a girl who can live independently reminds us of Mei and Satsuki in `Totoro' or Kiki in `Kiki's Delivery Service.'

One interesting fact is that before making two `Panda' films, Hayao Miyazaki (who provided the original idea for the film, the script, and basic image designs) and Isao Takahata (who directed the film) were planning to make an animated version of `Pippi Longstocking' with Yoichi Kotabe (later known for his illustrations for Super Mario Brothers), but Astrid Lindgren refused to give the permission. It is a regrettable decision, but still Miyazaki and Takahata managed to create a unique character of Mimiko, tactfully using some elements seen in Pippi's image (Compare Mimiko's hairstyle with Pippi's, for example).

But all these things are not really necessary to enjoy watching these simply-told and very charming animations. True, these pre-Ghibli works from Miyazaki and Takahata look too light and too short, but their signatures are already there. And you will love this little girl Mimiko who is so adorable.

By the way the original Japanese title of `Panda Go Panda' is actually `Panda Kopanda, which means 'panda (and) little panda.'",1164499200,,3044,5.0881763527054105
7922539,5,B00004TJGC,Oh my god!!!! I would never have thought that I would end up doing this. My three year old loved this movie sooooo much that she  watched it so often that when it was scratched I had to drive all over town looking for a replacement. No one had it and at the time it wasn't available on Amazon too. This is a great movie for young children and the story is simple and entertaining enough that you probably wouldn't mind watching it more than once. Definitely a good BUY. I still can't get the music out of my head!!!,1147478400,,515,4.15
7922540,5,B00004TJGC,"Panda! Go Panda! is an anime cartoon made for television in the early days of the partnership between Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata. There are two c 37 minute episodes: ""Panda! Go Panda!"" and ""Rainy Day Circus"". The first shows how a little girl named Mimiko meets a baby panda and his father who come to live in her house, and the second tells how they all survive a big flood. The atmosphere throughout is bright and funny. Even when the baby panda is lost for awhile in the first episode and when a train runs away in the second episode, the situations are presented in such a way that they are not likely to upset the average child.

In this world, Mimiko's grandma can go away for a ""little while"" (she doesn't come back, but she stays in touch) and leave her granddaughter to take care of everything - because the granddaughter is the most amazingly competent kid in the world. In this world, pandas talk and are super strong and when little girls are really, really happy they stand on their heads. It is a very silly, very cute world.

No one can say for sure how a 3 year-old will react to a story, and I am not guaranteeing that every 3 year-old will be as enthralled by these two stories as my grandson is, but I would reccomend this DVD to just about anyone - kiddies and grown-ups too. It has the charm and cleverness of the later Studio Ghibli film, MY NEIGHBOUR TOTORO - even though the animation is only of made-for-tv standard.

(This review is based on the Australian DVD release).",1143072000,,1502,4.415162454873646
