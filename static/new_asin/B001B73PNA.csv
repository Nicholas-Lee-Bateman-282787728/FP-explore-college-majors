3484343,2,B001B73PNA,this dvd is not funny its slow! it seems like smoked one to many joints before getting on stage the only funny part is when the fat guy plays paino. people that think this is funny should check out a real comedian like jimmy carr sean lock or sarah silverman.,1293408000,,259,4.2
3484344,5,B001B73PNA,This is from a TV broadcast I saw once on Comedy Central. It is sooo dang funny! I highly recommend it. It is not sold in stores. My favorite stand up!,1282003200,2,151,3.903225806451613
3484345,4,B001B73PNA,"Wife even watched it with me. There was not a lot of continuous laughter from us, but the few things we liked we still quote from time to time..... ""Cookies are a sometimes snack!"" YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!",1277164800,4,210,5.0285714285714285
3484346,5,B001B73PNA,"This DVD proves the very fact that Jeff Ross is indeed the RoastMaster! He's very quick on his feet with insults and creative as well. I actually saw him perform a week ago and it was great. I had the honor to be roasted by him on stage, and got to meet and speak with him after the show too! Support Jeff Ross!",1245801600,6,311,3.9523809523809526
3484347,5,B001B73PNA,"Jeffrey Ross is great! If you have seen him on any Roast on Comedy Central and thought he was funny,then you have to get this!",1226361600,4,126,4.08
3484348,5,B001B73PNA,"i really only knew jeffrey ross from his appearances on the comedy central roasts, and just as funny as he is at roasting people, i found out his stand up act is no different. he's especially funny when he grabs individuals out of the audience and lays into them. he's quick on the draw. and dead on. i'll definitely recommend this special to anybody.",1219363200,12,351,4.5
8282033,5,B001B73PNA,It's hilarious! I wish Mr.  Ross would do another one!,1466899200,,54,4.4
8282034,5,B001B73PNA,good product,1463961600,,12,5.5
8282035,4,B001B73PNA,Pretty funny. If you like to laugh.,1452124800,,35,4.142857142857143
8282036,5,B001B73PNA,This is the king of roasting people's stand up.  A major mix of him roasting people and just jokes.  The only bad part is I wish it was longer.  I laughed so much my stomach hurt.  Of course kids can't see this.  Adults will love it.,1433203200,,233,3.9782608695652173
8282037,5,B001B73PNA,If you like Jeffrey Ross and enjoy his routines this is the one to buy. I enjoyed this and so I gave it to someone who would also enjoy it.,1369094400,,139,3.6666666666666665
8282038,2,B001B73PNA,"I love Jeff's roasts but that is his limit. Unlike Greg Giraldo who has a huge range comedy beyond the roasts, Jeff is all about the insults. It is funny for a while but then gets boring.",1360281600,,187,4.081081081081081
8282039,3,B001B73PNA,"If you're like me you've seen Jeff Ross on the Comedy Central Roast, and if your reading this you probably really liked him on them, as did I, he is great in them. But in his own stand up special just average.",1356307200,,209,4.0
8282040,5,B001B73PNA,"If you like insult comedy you'll really like this dvd! I had originally listened to the audio cd of this stand up event, so when I saw the dvd was available I bought it. Jeff Ross is hilarious, and if you like him on the comedy central roasts you definitely won't be disappointed. I saw a couple negative reviews for this dvd and it baffles me. I consider myself a comedy connoisseur, I've been watching/studying stand up comedy most of my life, and I really enjoy Jeff's style, and this dvd is definitely worth the money.",1336780800,2,522,4.447916666666667
8282041,1,B001B73PNA,Not Jeffrey Ross's best. I was very disappointed with this video. He needs to stay on comedy central with the celebrity roasts.,1325980800,,127,4.818181818181818
8282042,1,B001B73PNA,I don't really like comedians who roast the audience members unless he/she is a heckler then by all means let 'em have it. I feel that is a cop out for not having funny jokes and a bit shallow. The only REAL funny part of this catastrophe was at the end when he brought up the piano players. Other than that I would rate this a negative. He may be good at roasting celebrities but his stand up SUCKS!!! All through the DVD he just leaves you hanging and waiting and waiting for the funny/laughs but they NEVER come. Unless you need a coaster to put your drink on I would advise you to save your money.,1312588800,,601,4.145299145299146
