8429291,3,B004H2S8ZG,"This DVD is what I call a choreography DVD. What I mean by this is that each of the four segments contains more than 3 eight count combinations of moves that do not repeat themselves, neither in the same 8 count nor in the full segment. This type of format is quite challenging for a non-dancer. Your movement memory and coordination need to be very good to enjoy this type of exercise, otherwise you'll feel a bit frustrated. On top of this, Devora does not include a detailed instruction on the moves and what she is doing with her arms and legs. She just sometimes says things like ""stomp, stomp, turn"" during the choreography (at full speed), but never explains in detail how to place your feet to make the turn or in which direction you should do it, so you need to watch and mimic.

Additionally, Kari introduces feet movements first and then gradually adds arm movements and embellishments, whereas Devora introduces feet, arms, head and body movements together from the beginning. I put this DVD away and thought I had wasted my money.

Since I really liked how some of the moves in this DVD look, I decided to keep trying. Devora includes several ""from the tops"" and the individual moves in themselves are not too difficult, so I must say that if you stick to it, you'll get the moves sufficiently good to dance along. Whether you catch all the details, like head tilts, etc. is another story; but at least you can dance through the full choreo. I own this DVD for a year now and I can dance through the first of the four segments. Once you master the segment it is fun, this is why I only use the first part (I am postponing going into the pain of the other segments). Had Devora included a detailed tutorial section, I would have rated this DVD with 4 stars.

Street Jazz and Hip-Hop Dance with Karen Gayle: Dance choreography, Hip-hop dance instruction, Jazz dance how-to</a>&nbsp;is also a choreography DVD but the movements and combinations in themselves are much more challenging than Devora's (it looks great, so if you are a good dancer, give it a try). The difference is that Karen included an excellent tutorial. Since I can also dance along the first choreography of Karen's DVD which is much more complicated than Devora's, I can tell you that if Devora had included a similar tutorial, her DVD would not be so unnecessarily discouraging. It took me definitely longer to follow Karen, but the difficulty level is not at all comparable; Karen included travel steps, synchopated moves and a lot of accents.

If you prefer a dance based workout try ""Dance off the inches"" DVDs in which each 4 count is repeated several times as an exercise and then changed to another 4 count, etc. in each segment, so the full segment has a couple of different moves that are easily managed.

CARDIO CHALLENGE: Medium TONING: Low CHOREOGRAPHY DIFFICULTY: Intermediate INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY: Scarce MUSIC: Good FUN FACTOR: None until you master it, then it is very good

CONTENTS:
1) Warm up - Dancy warm up which is good and at the same time fun to do, although a bit short (this is my favorite part). By the way, the warm up uses a different song than the rest of the routines.
2) Four different dance segments each of similar difficulty
3) The four routines are combined into a full choreography

MUSIC:
The song is good (Round up by Lady May) and also matches perfectly to the routines. What is not so good is that all four dance segments use the same song, which is repeated over and over, so if you do it often it gets quite monotonous.

EMPHASIS:
This is a choreography DVD, not a fitness or workout type of routine, so there is no specific fitness emphasis, except for a bit of cardio.

WHAT IS BETTER THAN IN OTHER DVD'S:
+ Nice routines, well suited for social dancing (you dance basically in the same place as opposed to performance style choreos). Although mastering the full routines with all the different moves following in quick succession is quite challenging, you can learn the individual moves, which are not too difficult in themselves and use some of them even for the club.
+ If you like to dance from the beginning (warm-up) till the end and you can master it, then this DVD is for you.",1383696000,3,4927,5.075308641975309
