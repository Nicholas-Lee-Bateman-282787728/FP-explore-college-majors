8504855,5,B006V3AU2S,"This is an excellent resource, I wish it were more widely known in the US. It is a welcome alternative to hospital-led prenatal classes, which sometimes focus too much on procedures & interventions and too little on providing emotional support/ healthy alternatives for the expecting parents, in particular for the mother. This DVD provides a lot of useful advice on recovery during postpartum, and hints on how to emotionally adapt to life with a new baby.
Also, there is an edifying post-natal component ,which is often missing from regular prenatal classes in the US.",1420761600,,570,5.074468085106383

I liked the group setting in the dvd, seeing that the couple's shared questions and concerns I also had...which were answered. This is a great video and I definitely recommend it to fellow preggers :)",1420243200,,329,4.7894736842105265

The DVD series offers the opportunity to watch the whole film as if you were sitting through a childbirth education class or choose from a number of educational topics - all in the comfort of your own home.",1332892800,5,380,4.861538461538461
8504859,5,B006V3AU2S,"Whether you need a great childbirth class from start to finish or just a review and refresher, whether you want the flexibility of a class in your own space on your own time or arrange popcorn viewing parties with pregnant friends, whether you are planning to birth at home or in a birth center or in a hospital, Birthwise meets your needs. The facilitator is an entertaining and gifted teacher. The format is well-organized. The cross-cultural dimension (UK) is part of its strength and charm.
