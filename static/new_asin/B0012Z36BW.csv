8248315,5,B0012Z36BW,"If you are a fan of Shakespeare and have always wanted to visit Stratford Upon Avon but can't afford the plane ticket -- this DVD is for you!

I really enjoyed this documentary, which takes the viewer through  historical sites  and gives a real feel for what daily life must have been like. Do not expect excitement or rollicking entertainment, and do not expect a biography. (There are other DVDs for that -- I would recommend 'In Search of Shakespeare' for  a great biography, and for exciting entertainment -- heck, just watch his plays!!)

But if you are a bit of an Anglophile or a historian and you like to find out the nitty gritty of specific time periods, I highly recommend this DVD. I have visited Stratford more than once and I learned a few new things. It  is very thorough, giving the latest up to date information, a bit of relevent/ changing/ re-examined history. The interviews from local townspeople were quite interesting --  those that live and work among the hype and take much pride in their native son.  Beautiful cinematography of the English countryside too!  At 3+ hours long it is a great investment, one I am glad to have in my permanent collection.",1389052800,,1177,4.647342995169082
8248316,4,B0012Z36BW,"This is a very good, thorough tour of Shakespeare's home town and surrounding environs, using a real tour guide who's well-versed in her subject - she speaks of the history of Stratford-Upon-Avon, from its beginnings, goes inside Shakespeare's birthplace, as well as Mary Arden's home, and other local points of interest, speaks to the knowledgeable tour guides who work there, talks about many various details such as wall-hangings, clothing, children, work, floor mats, etc, etc.  It's all accompanied by a single cameraman who simply documents what each location looks like, and what the tour guides offer to visitors.  It's basic, dry stuff, but I learned several things I never knew before, and was able to see in good detail what is available in Stratford for tourists.  It's just like going on a private guided tour, and the length of the program - 2-1/2 hours, means you get a LOT of detail for the price you pay.  I enjoyed it, although I wouldn't call it ""riveting entertainment"" by any stretch - but being a Shakespeare buff, (and a bit of an Anglophile) I highly recommend it.",1380499200,,1088,4.864864864864865

It helps to give my students a visual intro so they better understand the plays we read (Hamlet, Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, The Taming of the Shrew).",1371340800,,282,5.0212765957446805
