8035695,5,B00030DIQK,"I had never seen the original TV pilot movie when it was first televised. It certainly brought back memories of that wonderful Knight Rider series.
The cast, including Richard Basehart and Edward Mulhare, was excellent; and the effects quite good, even by today's computerized standards.  And to give credit where it's long overdue, William Daniels was the perfect choice as the voice of K.I.T.T. and the main reason I watched the series.  The dialogue between Michael Knight and K.I.T.T. (thanks to the work of an excellent film editor) was always sharp and fun in each episode.  It's nice to see the origin of that relationship.  The story for the pilot kept moving at a good pace.
No one could have envisioned at that time how the phrase about One Man Making A Difference would eventually impact on Mr. Hasselhoff's life personally as well as on the lives of the many young people who watched the show or met him later (through car shows, hospital visits, concerts, etc.). Many remain his fans today and have, in their own way, incorporated that credo into their lives.

8035696,5,B00030DIQK,"I won't go into my usual big review of the show as someone already has.  I will just say, that this episode is included with Set 1 of 4 (most of which I bought here at Amazon), so what could there possibly be in this single disc that is not in the opening 4 bagger (whose 4th disc by the way is the sequel movie from 2000)?  Buy the sets, and ignore the single entries you see on this page, you'll be 1,000,000% better off. In this case (to paraphrase Wilton Knight as played by Richard Basehart) ""THIS ONE DVD DOES NOT MAKE A DIFFERENCE.:-)",1120953600,4,541,4.142857142857143
