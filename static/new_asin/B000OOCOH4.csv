8185715,2,B000OOCOH4,They are all sitting around talking about how the supplements are the best and that's what they took to get huge. They do mention a little about training and diet.,1358812800,,163,4.466666666666667
8185716,3,B000OOCOH4,"You get descent tips from world class bodybuilders and trainers, but offers little in way of variety. Honestly you'll get much better info from a Bodybuilding magazine than this DVD. All the bodybuilders have little to no personality (except Branch) and you get rather bored pretty quick into it. I have it 3 stars because they explain basic movements and show how to perform them with perfect execution so there is some substance to this DVD, but not much. Don't waste your money unless you can get it for cheap.",1315872000,,513,4.711111111111111
