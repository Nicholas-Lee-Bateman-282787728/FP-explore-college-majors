ask yourself do you really think these moves will work in the street? my 41+ years and over 30 violent confrontations says #%@% no",1469145600,,1054,4.523560209424084

8269896,1,B0018JV22M,"i bought both volumes thinking i would see good silat . every defense method shown was unscientific and unrealistic and would be dangerous to attempt in a real encounter  against a determined attacker. i have now practiced and taught pencak silat for over twenty-two years, anyone with real fighting experience will tell you that you cannot atempt difficult jointlocks and restraining holds on a skilled fighter especialy when there are more than one attacker from the beginning of my training i was told ALL AUTHENTIC SILAT ASSUMES THAT THERE IS MUTIPLE ATTACKERS, this is the reason for sambuts and body leaveraging ,these componants are strangly missing from these dvds .the performers don't take into consideration the human reaction of the opponant when struck. the sequence of their  techniques don't flow smoothly from one to the other like good silat always does if. you look closely, many times the techniques leave the defender dangerously exposed , such as when the performer of the bahkti-nagara style is demonstrated the performer lunges unprotected into her attacker to throw a front thrust kick with her hands extended behind her. another guy flanks a punch without takeing his opponants centerline,leaving himself  wide open to a attack from the other hand, rediculous methods that look like they were thought up on the spot in many cases. all good high level silat aims to DESTROY ANY ONCOMING WEAPON, that is any kicks or punch;s the jointlocks are a millitary tactic to restrain an enemy officer on the battlefield and bring him in for interrigation you don't do this to a street attacker . also there were no methods shown to develope the raw internal power needed to stop a much larger attacker this is essential because generally speaking the indonesian people are small in stature . look at the size of the people in these dvds and ask yourself if you really beleive they could defend themselves against a linebacker? if you want to stay in shape doing acrobatics these dvds are for you if you want to learn to fight and be really effective ,get bob orlando,s dvds",1451347200,3,2087,4.923295454545454
