8265530,3,B00179WB0U,"First of all, the photo and credits on the DVD cover is incorrect. The fake Bruce Lee in this movie is Bruce Lei, not Bruce Le, and not to be confused with Bruce Li or Bruce Lai. Not that it really matters, as they are all equally silly doing their Bruce imitations. Other than that, the plot pretty much follows the standard formula for this type of movie.

Bruce's teacher gets killed in the beginning. He marries the teacher's daughter and has a kid with her. But he can't find a normal job because he's uneducated. He ends up working for the ruthless boss of a gang. After a while, he decides he doesn't want to work for the boss anymore. The boss lures Bruce away from his family then sends his henchmen to kidnap Bruce's wife and kid in order to blackmail him into eliminating a rival gang. The henchmen screw up and end up killing the wife and kid. Bruce finds out it was his former boss who was behind it and vows revenge. Then the mayhem ensues.

The only thing missing from the formula is there's no Bolo Yeung.

The quality of the movie is mostly good with a few spots where the scenes are blurry, but the blurriness doesn't last too long so it's watchable. Also includes the standard bad English dubbing.",1382659200,,1216,4.371681415929204

Did not have to communicate with the vendor, so I cannot rate their communication skills. Only criticism I have is the price. This is a 30 year-old martial arts flick that was one of many that the Orient decided to flood the cinema market with. Be that as it may, $7.00 was rather steep, but I could not find it on dvd anywhere else. In conclusion, my experience was overall outstanding.",1309824000,,499,4.4945054945054945
