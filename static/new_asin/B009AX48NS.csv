5311467,5,B009AX48NS,"If you're a beginner to exercise, or just returning to it, or if you just can't do a high intensity exercise video any more, this is a great DVD. I am delighted that the exercisers in this video are over 65 and don't appear to be right out of a glossy fitness magazine.  When I exercise along with this DVD it's easy to tell myself, ""Hey, if they can do this, so can I"".  The program is not difficult, focuses on aerobic walking, balance and muscle strength.",1366848000,257,458,4.252873563218391

found it to be a good hour-long workout, and by the end, I have worked up a sweat. I am 71, and I don't find this to be a difficult workout.

5311512,4,B009AX48NS,"It's a good workout, offering various cardio combinations. It's good for beginners or for those who want to go a little more slowly. There's not much here that isn't in other older adults workout DVDs, but that's okay. It makes for a good variety.",1495929600,3,247,4.636363636363637

5311514,4,B009AX48NS,"We (octogenarians) were looking for a DVD to replace the 1 hour sessions we used to take at the local community centre, which consisted of a few minutes of unstructured dancing around to jive music followed by stretching and strength type exercises. We find that the last option of the programmed choices on the DVD fits our needs except that it only lasts half an hour. Doing that every day would probably be more useful than the 1 hour a week that we used to do, but we seem to have too many other commitments to do it every day. For us, the last choice on this DVD would seem to fit our needs better if it lasted an hour. We have sort of settled on this for the first half hour, followed by a Moving with Mike DVD for the second half hour, twice a week when we do not have other commitments.",1495497600,2,794,4.162337662337662

5311524,5,B009AX48NS,"I found this video very useful. I am 78 yrs old and more active than most- this is not the only exercise that I do, but it's easy and can be divided into 20 minute periods. I see that various people have commented that it's either too easy or too difficult. The three participating seniors have variable functional levels and Angie makes clear that she offers an outline which can be adjusted to your own level. Those with problems could benefit from just doing the warm up and moving on to more routines later when/if the warm up becomes easy.",1492300800,,544,4.45

Being 62 , and younger than the seniors in the tape exercising, I thought this would be a very simple way to keep in shape.  But the first time I followed along, I was actually sweating!  I realized that just walking was not enough for me.  This tape is making me use different muscles during the cardio and weightlifting, so it is actually challenging.  I love it.  Very easy to follow, and no equipment other than a small set of weights and a chair is needed.",1491177600,,516,4.378947368421053

5311530,5,B009AX48NS,"An Absolutely wonderful video for Seniors needing a non brutal workout! I personally do not like to work out, and have bought other video workout videos that I have hated. A friend of mine shared this one with me and I loved it and had to have one of my own. There are many workouts on this DVD, so you can workout at many levels. I prefer the shorter version where you can be done in 30 minutes including your cool down. Who can't find 30 minutes to work out? It is an easy, wonderful, and fast work out, and I feel so good afterword. I have been doing this workout for 3 months now, and have not gotten bored with it at all. I look forward to doing it and have noticed increased muscle strength, more flexibility, more endurance, and I just plain feel better. This is the ONLY workout for me!",1491004800,2,794,4.196078431372549
5311531,5,B009AX48NS,"Great workout. I'm not an exercise expert, and I find these exercises easy to follow. I sometimes add more arm movements to increase the intensity, but in general, this is a good workout. Angie does a good job of counting out the reps and warning of upcoming changes. She also gives modifications for different range of motions. My only complaint is that you can't ""Play all"" workouts without watching (or fast forwarding through) the intro. Wish there was a way to just play the workouts.",1490918400,,489,4.764705882352941

5311535,4,B009AX48NS,"This 65 year old, with no health or flexibility issues, was looking for an exercise DVD that wasn't too strenuous, but would give my muscles and heart a somewhat mild workout.  I didn't want to have to get up and down from the floor, or have fast dance type steps that got my feet tangled up. After much research online at others reviews I picked this one and do use it a couple times a week. From beginning (warmup) to end (cool down)  it is one hour. But, as Angie, the trainer, says -- you can do as many or as few of the segments as you want, if you don't want to do the whole hour.  If you're looking for a DVD that will really get your heart pumping then this one probably isn't for you. I do the whole hour without breaks without my heart rate raising much, or without shortness of breath. But if you're looking for a mild workout that exercises every muscle group, with cardio and some weights, then I recommend Cardio & Strength Training Workout for Seniors. Angie, the trainer, has 3 seniors with her, all performing a different level of intensity and the viewer can follow the one they want. I follow Angie  for some exercises, and Judy for others. Overall I do like the DVD; the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that there is much repetition in the different cardio segments. But this being the first exercise DVD I've purchased, I don't know if that is typical or not.",1489708800,2,1389,4.290076335877862

This video builds up my endurance, core strength, and muscle strength, and allows me to pursue a wider variety of more intensive workout videos available (after I've built up sufficient endurance and muscle strength). Angie has just the right amount of conversation, mostly to guide, inform, and cue.  She explains exactly how many more sets and repetitions remain, before she cues you into a different move.  Her class attendants range in age from 68 to 75 (inspiring group).  The class includes an introduction, warm-up, walk aerobics, muscle toning, and cool-down. The pacing is good and you will work up a sweat.  She works all muscle groups while offering modifiers for those just beginning.

What happened to me is that even though I started slowly with this program, following the person who did the gentlest workout, I began to have terrible sciatic pain (low back and hips).

Who the hell cares about your needs? You're only in my living room because of MY needs!
And the music is that God-awful bass-driven, porn-movie music that plagues so many low-budget workout productions. I guess they assume we can't hear it anyway.
The search continues. God, I miss Jane Fonda.  At least her videos had good production values and she seemed to be having fun. Though her videos might kill me today.

Plus, I want to ease into exercising with something that provides cardio and stretching, and then move onto something more rigorous.

This DVD - Absolutely Beginners - Cardio & Strength Training Workout for Seniors - is exactly what I needed. The DVD has a good selection: a warm-up, 3 ""sets"" that concentrate on cardio and stretch, and a cool down. The viewer and utilize these sets in a combination they feel comfortable with. This DVD also includes 3 pre-arranged ""sets"" that are between 20 and 30 minutes, that combine elements from the free-standing options. Example: Warm-up, Set 1, Set 3 and Cool Down.

This DVD provides a low-impact, smooth movements that are easy to follow, provide cardio movement that can be kind to a body that either doesn't move as it used to or is trying to get back into an exercise regime. The DVD has participants on it that age from 68 - 75, and each of these individuals are following the movements of the instructor with slight modifications. One participant provides a slightly more intense work-out, while another provides little ways to increase intensity, and the last participant provides for modifications that will assist those with stability issues. The instructor is motivating, moves at a pace that, while providing cardio, is easy to follow along and keep up.

I am very pleased I purchased this DVD and would recommend it to not only seniors, but anyone wanting to start getting back to exercise who needs a very elemental experience.",1469664000,2,1653,4.813380281690141

5311605,5,B009AX48NS,"I've spent 18 years trying to find something that inspires me to actually exercise.  Am amazed I finally found something i.e. this video. A lot of it has to do with the delightful teacher, Angie Miller. who is very pleasant to look at as well as hear and she never stops a gentle talking encouraging you to keep going.  Also the exercises are easy and basic but enough to give you a workout and build muscle strength.  She uses weights in part of the strength training.  I had picked up a couple of five pound weights from a neighbor who was tossing them and after doing the exercises on the video realized that a couple of the arm movements were too difficult for me with the five pound weights so went to the local thrift shop and picked up some 3 pound weights for a few bucks and they are perfect for the two arm exercises I was having difficultly with so use them just for those.
The cardio aspect I skip because I dance a lot and what little I viewed looked like boring dancing.  But the strength training is excellent for me as I'm of the age where those muscles are really going.  The the ""cool down"" segment has some easy but effective stretching moves.

5311624,4,B009AX48NS,"I am not a senior, but I am carrying extra pounds, am unfit, and have a back problem. So my doctor suggested a DVD like this one so that the exercises wouldn't have me overdoing things. My hubby does squeak into the senior category, and he has been doing the exercises with me.

I have found that the exercises are good at getting my muscles warmed up and the joints moving, but it isn't too taxing. I can make it more difficult by simply stringing together more sections - there is a warm up, 3 cardio segments, a strength section and a stretch/cool down.
It is a comprehensive DVD and aside from the younger presenter, the other participants are in their 60's to 70's, so no being intimidated by lycra clad super-fit models!

I do find the background music a bit repetitive and annoying, but that is probably a personal thing - it doesn't bother hubby. Angie Miller, the instructor, is encouraging, and for the most part keeps things well paced, although she does say a few inconsistent things such as ""stay with us!"" followed immediately with ""go at your own pace""!

I have not had any issue with my back doing this exercise DVD, and have even dropped a few pounds. I know it is working me out because after doing a routine I have slightly stiff muscles the next day - nothing serious but enough to let me know I did indeed get a workout even though it was gentle.

I'm glad I took the punt on trying out this exercise DVD and I am yet to get bored with it :) I have seen improvements in my health and I plan to keep on exercising, as I am still an ""Absolute Beginner""! ( But an improving one)

It says ""easy-to-follow program of exercises designed especially for senior citizens just starting to exercise."" Not true. I don't believe it's for beginners. It reminds me of a Jane Fonda workout I used to do years ago. Ms. Miller starts right away with a warm-up that's not easy to follow. The warm-up! She tells you to go at your own pace while she goes really fast through the routine. She has three seniors with her that have probably been exercising and practicing with her for a long time. I do not recommend this unless you're in excellent health, your knees do not hurt, and you're definitely not a beginner.",1454284800,33,759,4.547445255474453

It is very similar to what we had experienced with Silver Sneakers, and now that we are back can be used when we are not up to getting out as early as needed for our local SS.

There are four trainers in the video, each doing the steps in a slightly different way. I sometimes liked to follow one or the other of them instead of Angie, and that worked great. Angie offers a mix of short cardio and strength training segments, so one can put together different mixes for different days, which worked great. I just wish I knew of other workout videos, also of similar difficulty, with which I could alternate. I did purchase two four pound weights for the strength segments, but these while helpful are not required.

5311743,3,B009AX48NS,"Being over-the-hill, I was skeptical of this, but needed some new material.
Pro:  It is divided into several segments--as well as introduction/warm-up--so you can pick & choose, or go all the way through.
  The hand movements are very basic & the footwork is standard AND varied; again, you could just do one movement for your routine
  until you get the hang of it.
  They do give shots not only from the front, but from the side.
Cons:  While the instructor is not too ""gun-ho"", she IS a Chatty Cathy!  I found it very hard to know what/when the next step was coming
  because she talked CONSTANTLY!  Without this, I would have given it 4 stars.  (She should take a cue from Gilad--New
  Beginners Workout; he tells you just before the next move & only ""compliments"" at end of a segment or while in the middle).
Overall, for those not Fred Astaires, over the hill, and/or overweight, it's not bad at all.  I would recommend it, but keep the sound down &
  simply practice/learn ea. step one at a time.",1424908800,7,1003,4.5083798882681565

Especially want more strength and flexibility. I added this video for Strength but it really only has one routine for strength and lots of other exercise routines.

The name may be *Absolute Beginners"" but that doesn't mean you cannot get a good workout even if you are in shape. It certainly works for beginners, but  by selecting the appropriate weights (dumbbells) and the amount of energy exerted, we believe anyone can get  a very satisfying workout.",1400544000,5,391,4.720588235294118

5311824,5,B009AX48NS,"I found this video ON DEMAND and I LOVE IT.  I am not quite a senior...rather I am an uncoordinated out of shape middle aged woman with severe arthritis.  It should be called Video for Klutzes!  I actually LOVE doing this video and feel accomplished afterwards.  She gives GREAT cues... and when I feel extra klutzy I can watch some of the other folks doing the moves.  It's broken up into very short segments that once you get used to them you just march in place till the next one.  My body monitoring system shows a huge spike in physical activity when I do this video.

I have found that I started small.. do the warm up and then stop.  Day one...  then you can add the next segments as you feel ready.  On days I don't feel up to doing the entire hour I will do as many segments as I feel I can handle.  With other videos if I stop in the middle I feel bad, not with this one since there are nice spots to take breaks and not feel guilty.

The instructions at the beginning are clear and give you a great visual overview of what's coming.  The organization makes great sense... the warm up uses the moves for cardio but in smaller ways,... then each cardio session builds on the warm up moves... then the FINAL cardio session uses ALL the cardio sessions.. I guess you could go from warm up to Cardio Session 4 and still do all the cardio moves.

While NOT a great workout for someone who is not physically compromised by age,injury or impairment, it's a PERFECT workout for getting started regardless of your age.  And you can do just legs without arms or add arms as Angie suggests...

I actually LOOK FORWARD to doing this when I get home from work every day and I find myself making a game out of seeing if I can do it BIGGER like Judy or if I'm having a Marilyn  (use my chair) kind of day...

THIS video makes an out of shape klutz like me feel GOOD and ACCOMPLISHED... KUDOS to Angie Miller,  and SportsSkools for an awesome gateway to fitness.",1397088000,10,1956,4.252032520325203

I sit a lot when working so decided walking the dog wasn't adequate exercise and went on the search for for an easy to follow exercise DVD that covered all the basics; cardio,  strength, and core. This fit the bill and I don't trip over my own feet trying to keep up. The music is suited for elevators so I've added my own now that I have the routine down.

It was discontinued in January, 2014, to my dismay, but I discovered it was available via Amazon.  I purchased it and have continued to use this workout several times a week.  Angie Miller gives concise directions and the timing is perfect for someone like me, who hasn't done a regular workout in many years.  With the video, I have the ability to customize my workout based on my level of exercise required as well as time available.  I often opt for the warm up, Cardio session 3 and 4, along with the Strength and Cool Down sessions when I don't have the full time available.  This is an excellent beginners work out for those of us hitting 60!

There are several variations shown during the workout-easy, intermediate and advanced. Sometimes he gets tripped up when they start moving around, but he says it's fun to laugh about how his feet can't keep up!
He can't make it through all 4 (I believe he said there were 4 ""rounds""), but he said he is working up to it and he likes that there is something to look forward to.

My wife has consistently told me that she feels that my problems are due to inactivity. I noticed that significant walking on several cruise vacations resulted in improved mobility and decided to try an exercise video. I ordered five dvd's from three different instructors and I will tell everyone that this video is by far and away the absolute best exercise video available for both senior citizens who have been inactive and for anyone that would be considered an ""absolute beginner"". I found that several of the other video's that gave the impression of being for beginners, were too intense. So, if you want to purchase one video that will get you started, I highly recommend ""Absolute Beginners - Cardio & Strength Training Workout for Seniors"".",1390262400,43,914,4.941558441558442

5311848,5,B009AX48NS,This is great beginning workout.

5311849,5,B009AX48NS,"Ms. Miller is pleasant & instructive.  This is an excellent video in that It truly is fast enough & safe enough to keep your heart pumping while burning off the pounds.  The warm up introduces all of the steps that are going to be implemented in the upcoming cardio aerobic segments.  There are four cardio aerobic segments lasting a total of 22 minutes so you can stop & rest if need be. There are 4 people demonstrating different levels simultaneously & you are encouraged to go at your own pace.  Then there is a 24 minute strength training segment followed by stretches.  Weights are needed for the strength training; however, Ms. Miller states that you do not have to use the weights.  Strength training & stretches are done either from a seated position or standing next to the chair.  I especially like the weight training & stretches as I feel that they are safe, effective, & they feel good & more importantly because I can do them.  I do not use the weights because of a health condition.  I am 55 years old & I have been exercising for awhile.  If you are looking for a video that is very slow, I would recommend the Older & Wiser Workout for Seniors for aerobic segments only especially if you have been inactive & have knee or back problems.  If you have good endurance & like a slightly faster pace, then this is the video for you.  Even though I am not athletic I can fully participate in this DVD & enjoy it as well. I own both videos mentioned & enjoy them both.  I am just so glad to find exercise videos suitable for seniors.",1388966400,328,1544,4.394366197183099

I dread working out and I'm too out of shape to start out with a more intensive exercise program which will undoubtedly make me short of breath and sore to the point where I won't do it again.  This ""Absolute Beginners"" DVD has a few different workouts to choose from the menu to shorten or lengthen the time it takes to exercise.  As well, I wasn't sore.  I moved enough to limber myself up so I don't have to feel like I'm over  60  when I'm only  54.  I feel better.  This is a very nice beginner DVD.  Only negative - and it's not really negative - comment is that the instructor referred to a stretch in the quadriceps as a ""hamstring"" curl.
