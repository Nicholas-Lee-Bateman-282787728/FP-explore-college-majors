7926509,2,B00004Y55Z,"There are nine shorts on this DVD, so here are nine short reviews.
1 - ""Animated Corpse"" - 4 stars: It's a music video, so you can't really expect much. It gets it's job done... what else do you need to say?
2 - ""Dinner"" - 3 stars: A modern fairy tale that had some good ideas and an interesting set design, but fails because of a poor script. When it tries to be funny, it fails, and when it tries to be dramatic, it is laughable. It's the sort of thing that would probably be good to remake.
3 - ""Every Night and Twice on Sundays"" - 2 stars: Yet another independent documentary that's meant to be funny. I thought it was boring as hell. Sort of like what happens if you take a Christopher Guest mockumentary and then sedate it with a thousand pounds of tranquilizers.
4 - ""Flying with the Angels"" - 1 star: This is the sort of crud that gives independent cinema a bad name. It is a pretentious, boring, pseudosymbolic music-video-wannabe that the filmmakers took way too seriously. The woman who made it claimed that she was trying to do something surreal and meaningful, but ended up just shooting a bunch of random images that don't fuse together--sort of like a really bad poem by W.B. Yeats.
5 - ""Iceman"" - 2 stars: This was so forgettable that I can't even remember the plot involved. I only remember being bored.
6 - ""Hidden Child"" - ? stars: I tried to watch this one, but the DVD wouldn't let me. Make up whatever rating you would like.
7 - ""The Passage"" - 1 star: This movie also pretended to be really intelligent, meaningful, and symbolic, but it was just a plotless waste of film. Supposedly, this one is supposed to be about a writer's struggle between reality and insanity. Instead, a guy has a beer, smokes a cigarette, and stares off, blankly. It lasts for twenty minutes and achieves nothing.
8 - ""Today's Life"" - 4 stars: A pilot in a deep space research vessel struggles to understand his existence. ""Today's Life"" is the only movie on this disc with impressive special effects, but the reason it is good is because of a very interesting plot (actually, the fact that it has any plot at all is a welcome change from the rest of the movies) and a decent pace. It is heavy-handed, which might cause you to wish they would have extended the movie, or even made it feature-length, but it as a short, it is still pretty good.
9 - ""Zitlover"" - 1 star: Disgusting for disgustingness's sake. It's like ""South Park,"" only it's awful and not funny.
The greatest tragedy of this DVD is that the worst of the movies are also the longest. I'm not the type of person who requires an explosion to hold my interest--I just like to watch movies that actually have some content, or a reason to exist. The problem with Fusion ONE (other than being boring) is that all of the movies seem like the filmmakers are practicing and not actually doing any real work. These are all like the first drafts of better works, except that there aren't any revised, final drafts that you can watch later.",1012435200,7,2991,4.420289855072464
7926510,3,B00004Y55Z,"I'm known by my friends and students for loving strange, short, indie films. So you'd think this collection of very strange, very short, very indie films would be my favorite. However, even I, hardcore lover of weirdness that I am, started to long for some good old fashioned plot and hollywood-style drama after watching these. Some on this disk are excellent filmmaking acheivements (Passage is comparable in style and cinematic quality to the classic cult film Eraserhead, and Today's life has some stunning sci-fi effects for a small-budget short), some are just badly-scripted, badly-acted fun (The female lead in the fairies-in-modern-LA story ""Dinner"" isn't what she seems in more ways than one), and some are only for those under 12 and/or with strong stomachs (if you can watch more than 1 minute of ""Zitlover"" then you are the type of person who will think it's hilarious and wonderful. If you can't, you aren't.)
I'd like to see you buy this DVD just to support the concept of indie short-cinema on DVD. However, I have to be honest and say that all the discs in the ""Short"" and ""Film-fest"" series are much more impressive and enjoyable introductions to the delights of modern small-budget short films. The one thing that IndieFusion does have that beats all other short cinema DVDs is a director's commentary track for EVERY feature, and the commentaries are much more creative, fun, and interesting than most commentary tracks on big hollywood feature-film DVDs, too.
So go ahead. Try it. If you're a teenager, you'll love it. If you're not a teenager, maybe you should consider becoming one. This DVD will help.",978739200,11,1625,4.956043956043956
7926511,5,B00004Y55Z,"I borrowed this DVD from a friend of mine because they liked it.  I liked it too.  My favorite was a music video from Tilt.  I really like Tilt, they are a really good punk band.  The video was really good because it had a zombie and it was really funny.  I liked the other films on there too.  They were really good.",971827200,3,317,3.9523809523809526
7926512,5,B00004Y55Z,"Its nice to watch short film, they are unfortunately not recognized all the time - and this is an example that they should be. We have some talented filmmakers out there doing great stuff. I especially enjoy Hidden Child, this eerie look into a long time secret. The cinematography was beautiful, and the acting was really first class!",970099200,5,335,4.793103448275862
7926513,5,B00004Y55Z,"My favorite on the disk was ""Dinner,"" a weirdly dark gothic  fairy-tale that reminded me of Tim Burton or Terry Gilliam.  Really cool.",969235200,3,134,4.782608695652174
7926514,5,B00004Y55Z,"This DVD kicks a**.  I could watch Zitlover everyday, my mom can't really  handle it though.  Worth every penny.",968889600,2,112,4.7894736842105265
7926515,5,B00004Y55Z,"I just received my copy of Fusion One and I would like to start off by  saying that it the best short film compilation on the market today.  The  special feature that stood out for me was that every film that might not be  suitable for children lets you know on the film's sub-menu, and why it may  not be acceptable.  For example Hidden Child had a warning for violence and  based upon the age of my children I knew that this was okay for them to  watch, and when Flying With the Angels gave me the warning for nudity, I  just skipped that one.  The people that put this disc together really had  the consumer in mind by allowing my family and I to pick and choose which  film we wanted to see, and when.  I must admit that I did go into the red  room and watch Zitlover, it was extremely disgusting, but I can't say that  I wasn't warned, or that I didn't like it.",968889600,6,866,4.071428571428571
7926516,5,B00004Y55Z,"There are a few things about this DVD that I could say were my favorite.  One being the filmmakers' presence on the disc, sharing their stories and  giving tips on how they made such great films. Another favorite feature are  the fantastic films, every film on this disc is exceptional yet different.  For example, there is a music video from Tilt, and a ""gross-out""  film, Zitlover, with special effects created by guy who did the Fly 2 and  the X-Files (Zitlover has become a classic in my dorm).  Then, there are  films that are just beautiful like Today's Life which is a cinematically  gorgeous sci-fi and Every Night and Twice on Sundays which is about the  ""I've fallen and I can't get up"" lady, it is very funny.  And,  last but not least, IndieDVD splits all of the proceeds with the filmmakers  without taking away all of the rights to their films.  This is practically  unheard of in this business, and truly innovative.  This is a fantastic  piece of work that everyone should buy, not only because it has great films  with special features, but also to support the independent film community.",968803200,9,1105,4.666666666666667
