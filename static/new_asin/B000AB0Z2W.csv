2384166,4,B000AB0Z2W,The video documentary gives a over view of the US submarine activity in WW2. It is surprisingly thorough for the casual observer. Not much film was made of submarine actions but the film has collected most of it. I found the video very good to excellent.,1372291200,,254,4.543478260869565
2384167,3,B000AB0Z2W,"This dvd is made up of various U.S. Navy short films documenting service aboard World War II submarines.  Some of these documentaries were shown to recruits as they began training for the Silent Service, while others were made mainly for civilians, arguably to boost morale at home and to sell war bonds.  None of them show the complete picture of life aboard submarines, but that's understandable given the secrecy in which they had to operate.  The dvd could have been made better if it included some more detailed post war films after they were de-classified.  If you're looking for an action/adventure film, this one isn't for you.  However, if you like history and want to see the kind of fare the Navy was producing during, and shortly after, the war, this dvd provides some good examples.",1327536000,8,795,4.8161764705882355
2384168,1,B000AB0Z2W,"This is an interesting dvd, but a seriously overpriced dvd.  Should be $10.00.  I watched it all in one afternoon, and was extremely disappointed.",1315872000,2,146,5.041666666666667
2384169,5,B000AB0Z2W,My husband was pleasantly surprised by this DVD - he loved it. My 8 year old son sat and watched it too. I thought it might be a little old for him but he sat through the whole thing and shushed us if we made any noise.,1231804800,9,219,3.6808510638297873
2384170,5,B000AB0Z2W,"This beautifully packaged DVD is a revelation because it includes several different B&W films including actual full-color footage taken on the USS SCULPIN with its, then, Cmdr. who was later killed while on deck shooting at the Japanese enemy; Submariners between War Patrols relaxing at The Royal Hawaiian on Waikiki, etc.  Also, the reproduction availability of WWII Fleet Type Submarine manual and supplement, as well as other products beautifully demonstrated.  All in all, a great issue/find!",1213488000,21,497,5.526315789473684
2384171,5,B000AB0Z2W,We showed this at our last dive club meeting and everyone really enjoyed it.  Excellent background info for the history of diving.,1154304000,9,130,4.909090909090909
2384172,5,B000AB0Z2W,"Without exception, ""The Silent Service in World War II"" is the absolute best depiction of the United States submarine fleet during this period. None of the footage that you'll see in this DVD is a Hollywood conception of what was. This is the real McCoy. As a veteran submariner and old smoke boat sailor, this is a DVD that you won't be able to stop watching. This is a must have for the any Naval historian, submarine sailor, school or anyone that would like to see how it really happened.

You'll see the exciting capture of an actual German U-boat and it's recovery. View the rescue and recovery of the USS Squalus and it's crew. Hear accounts from Japanese regarding the massive damage inflected by our pig boats after they attacked Pearl Harbor. I highly recommend this DVD to everyone. You're library just isn't complete until you own this one.

2384173,5,B000AB0Z2W,"I just recently bought the ""Silent Service in WWII"" DVD and spent the better part of an evening watching it.  If you're a fan of books like ""The Hunt for Red October"" or ""Run Silent, Run Deep"" -- or the movies of the same name -- this DVD is for you.  It has five interesting films made by the U.S. Navy and featuring real-life footage of some of the most historic submarines of the 1930-1945 era.  The ""Submarine War Story"" film is a special treat, in that it shows how the U.S. fought Japanese surface forces throughout the war with subs.  It has some amazing footage from 1945 of subs sinking sampans and junks, and rescuing pilots whose crippled planes could not make it back to Tinian and Iwo Jima.  Some of the other films show how sub crews were trained, and there is a short, silent newsreel that shows rare material from the Squalus accident (profiled in ""The Terrible Hours"" by Peter Maas).  The DVD is one of a planned set of five discs, and I look forward to getting the other four when they are available (looks like only a couple have been released so far).",1124582400,35,1071,4.383838383838384

8077486,1,B000AB0Z2W,most inept bunch of put together fake war footage i ever saw some footage was from movie with cary grant as sub captain,1488326400,,119,4.217391304347826
8077487,5,B000AB0Z2W,"Not the 1950 TV series, but better!  The interviews with the Japanese business leaders on how successful our subs were was outstanding. This video got the point across about why the secrecy (silence) on how effective our submarines actually were in the WWII Pacific. The Japanese still had many spies in and around Hawaii that kept watch over our fleet, hence the refueling and rearming of subs at sea or Wake and Guam. Excellent video, full of tactical information about submarine warfare.  I love it!",1479945600,,502,4.894117647058824
8077488,1,B000AB0Z2W,"For the cost it was way too short and showed limited footage. It was expected to run far longer than it did. One ""scene"" was all of 3 minutes long  I thought I missed something. It was certainly a major disappointment.",1453939200,,218,4.317073170731708
8077489,1,B000AB0Z2W,I thought it was a bit of a rip off.  Plus they market more movies (at extra cost) that you thought you should have got in the first place with this purchase.,1448409600,,158,3.9375
8077490,3,B000AB0Z2W,"When I ordered this product, I anticipated receiving the black & white television series ""The Silent Service"". What I received was a lot of docementary-type films from WW II, which I still enjoyed, but we're not what I had anticipated.",1430006400,,235,4.9
8077491,3,B000AB0Z2W,"I agree with Sam Shapiro's 3 star review for the reasons he gave.  I would add that I have seen parts of this film (the shorts) in other WWII movies so I do not believe this DVD is worth the $ 25.00 price the seller wants for it.  Rent it at your local library , if they have it or view some of the the other WWII dvd/s on submarine activity during WWII",1429401600,,353,3.8219178082191783
8077492,4,B000AB0Z2W,Wonderful. All original military film colorized. Great video archive. Very entertaining. Very glad I purchased.,1428883200,,111,6.466666666666667
8077493,5,B000AB0Z2W,"Best of the videos about WW11 warfare I have found.  Might be because I was searching for information about the Wahoo, my uncle's boat when it was lost/",1420761600,,152,4.428571428571429
8077494,5,B000AB0Z2W,"I thought this was a very good look at the real life daily experiences of the Silent Service. My father was a submariner in the Pacific during WW2 but he rarely spoke of his service time, save for some routine things. I was hoping to get even a glimpse of his boat, the Sea Robin, SS407 but that didn't happen. Still, this was a fine film and very well worth the price, not to mention seeing over and over again.
Dad's boat was reported missing in action for 10 days during the course of his second combat patrol but after repeated questioning from the family about it, all he would ever say was, ""I knew exactly where I was"", and the subject was dropped without another word. Now I have a feel for why he was the way he was about his time in combat.
An excellent film that leaves you wanting to know even more about the Silent Service.",1400371200,2,836,4.23125
