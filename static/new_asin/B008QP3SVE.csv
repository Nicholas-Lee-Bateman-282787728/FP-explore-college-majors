5178488,4,B008QP3SVE,"Donna Morton (Karen Grassle) is a beautiful young girl who is having an affair with the President: they meet regularly for their assignations in a safe house in Washington. For both security and discretion, Morton is always picked up by car driven by a Secret Service agent. Meanwhile in Moscow, a Russian agent gets hold of a document that seems to suggest that Morton is a Russian spy who has inveigled her way into the president's affections. This document gets into the hands of the security services, so they put Morton under surveillance.
Meanwhile Donna's brother Ben (Beau Bridges), who does work for the secret service on a freelance basis, arrives back in town. When Donna is found dead in her apartment, not surprisingly Ben begins to investigate using his official connections. He discovers that she was having an affair with the President, and that a secret service agent was seen leaving her apartment building around the time of her death.
Realizing that the Agency seemingly had Donna killed, Ben confronts the head of the organization who, of course, blames the Russians. Ben interrogates a real Russian agent at gunpoint and the truth emerges - that the whole thing was a set-up designed to weaken the president's standing in crucial talks.  This is a quite enjoyable thriller with a fair amount of action and tension in the plot.",1369612800,,1348,4.912280701754386

8529670,2,B008QP3SVE,Really bad made for TV movie - Thankfully I was on my laptop during most of this.  I usually like Beau Bridges but this was such a poor quality video or movie or Super 8.,1461024000,,170,3.857142857142857
8529671,2,B008QP3SVE,It was just OK,1427068800,,14,2.75
8529672,2,B008QP3SVE,"This movie didn't have an ending. It just stopped with the detective saying that he had a potential suspect. It didn't even say how he planned to proceed in his investigation. It just stopped, and they began showing credits of the actors and the productions staff.",1418601600,,264,4.760869565217392

8529674,2,B008QP3SVE,"It's an old movie, may have been good in it's time but rather a little slow and corny for today.  I did manage to watch till the end even though it hadn't passed my 10-minute rule (if not interesting within 10 minutes, watch something else).",1415491200,,241,4.355555555555555
8529675,1,B008QP3SVE,"Beau Bridges can't act for his life. The storyline is so far out there, that it's not even believable. Absolutely boring movie.",1414108800,,127,4.818181818181818
8529676,1,B008QP3SVE,"Unfortunately, there is no rating lower than one star.  This movie makes ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", which for years was considered the cheesiest movie ever made, look like an Oscar winner.",1410825600,,188,4.875
8529677,2,B008QP3SVE,"Same production values as a cheap TV movie from the 1980s. Wooden acting, poor plot and ridiculous pacing. Avoid it.",1407974400,2,116,4.85
