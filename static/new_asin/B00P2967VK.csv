8686162,5,B00P2967VK,"An amazingly tender and gritty story all in one. A young girl accidentally picks up a fallen pistol and it goes off. Shes suddenly alone with an abusive father. She runs off with a black housekeeper that defied a redneck bully and got herself beaten. Their trek takes them to a bee farm where a house of four black females take care of hives to support themselves in the South Carolina rural community in 1964. Secrets are kept and slowly emerge as viewers are taken into the family of very well developed characters.

The 60s music, costumes, cars, and more make it a very fun visual period drama. The heartbreaking story grips like another fantastic movie, The HELP. Lily is played by Dakota Fanning, and many future leads can be expected from this young actress. Sophie Okonedo (must see her in The Slap and Mayday) as May steals every scene shes in.
Certainly a movie not to be missed, and
NOW Blu-ray available. Highly recommended.",1459382400,3,936,4.672727272727273
