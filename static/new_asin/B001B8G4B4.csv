3486755,2,B001B8G4B4,"I thought that Remastered & Restored would make the copies better, but it seems that its just a hype to get you to purchase the DVD's. The picture quality is POOR at best; it reminds me of a copy of a VHS on SLP speed that was copied again. The sound was just adequate at best, not what I would expect from a digitally Remastered & Restored copy.  Don't waste you money.",1370563200,9,370,4.138888888888889
3486756,3,B001B8G4B4,Sound was not so good. Background sounds were too loud. Couldn't hear dialog very well. Picture was very clear though.,1359244800,2,118,4.95
3486757,3,B001B8G4B4,"I loved this show when I was a kid. It had an edge not found in the usual afternoon cartoons...starting with the concept of the hero: a detective, mortally wounded by gangsters; whose dying consciousness it transplanted into a super fast/strong robotic body (that can also assume the form of any human).

The protagonist, Tobor was never at ease with being trapped in a robotic body...no matter how human it looked. Especially when it prevented him from being able to express feelings of love.

Second, there was a real element of peril in many of the episodes. Death, dismemberment and mortal danger to innocents were commonplace happenings; and, made this show a stand-out.

That's not to say that it was deeply scripted, or brilliantly animated...it wasn't. It was an early Japanese import, and suffered from the choppy 'anime' traditions that were the norm for Japanese television cartoons. It was further hampered by terrible voice-over work; and, even remastered, the images are foggy, and the animation's limits are all the more telling today.

Despite these shortcomings, ""8th Man"" is a show that was way ahead of its time, and deserves a 2nd look from real fans of significant animation. The most shocking thing about ""8th Man"" is that is was never remade as a modern cartoon; where superior animation and voice-overs would give animation fans an amazing show.",1353369600,20,1369,5.0176211453744495
3486758,3,B001B8G4B4,I bought this just because I haven't seen 8th Man since 1971.  I should've known that because this anime was 40 years old it wasn't going to be anything like the anime of today.  I got it thinking that because it was digitally remastered it would be cleaned up a bit.  I was kind of disappointed because the sound effects were on the loud side and didn't quite fit with the whole anime.  If they want to do it right they should best research on all the sound effects and not slap a band aid and pass it off as such.  I actually bought all three volumes but didn't get past the first one yet.  Will eventually watch the rest when I got nothing else to do or watch.,1330214400,6,663,4.10077519379845
3486759,3,B001B8G4B4,"I was thrilled to see this product when it came out. Yes, I've had it since Amazon released it but I felt, as a verified buyer, that I finally give a review vs. some of the opinions I have read in the reviews. I have to agree with the other verified reviewer that the sound quality is the pits. At first I thought that I may have gotten a defective copy but I have such fond memories of this series as a child that I refused to send it back. A mono track would have been more acceptable than what you get. The video quality can only be considered acceptable. I too had problems with video pixilation as well. I currently have volume 2 on my wish list. It would have to drop to $9.99 or less before I even consider buying it due to the poor quality of the first release from this company.",1314144000,5,787,4.083870967741936
3486760,3,B001B8G4B4,"I gave this product a 2-star review because at least SOMEONE is taking some very minor effort to put this awesome show on dvd.  However, it is clearly done by a bootleg artist rather than an official company like Sony or Buena Vista, which is obvious by the TERRIBLE sound quality, cheap looking dvd case, tons of blotches and pixilated gook in almost every screen, and the amateur dvd menu that looks just like the tons of bootleg 60's-90's cartoon dvds I bought off ebay in the early and mid 2000's.  The poor picture and sound quality (although I guess it's better than on previous bootleg releases), unreasonably high price of about $[...] for 5 episodes that are only 15 minutes each (which is pure insanity in today's ratsoup economy), and the overall lackluster casing and presentation of this dvd deserve 1 single star.  But, because this show is now available on dvd - despite numerous flaws - I must give it an extra star.  If only this show would be released in a more official manner, it would easily deserve 4 or 5 stars.  Whatever thieves downloaded this and put it on dvd-r's ([...]),  should be put on trial for falsely advertising it as being ""remastered, restored, crystal clear"" and selling it at such a high price.  I want my money back, but I know some die-hard nostalgic animation fans out there will still appreciate this because of the greatness of the original material.  This dvd looks and sounds like garbage, and only because some clever Japanese animation studio put this together in the 60's is this show worth your time.  This DVD itself is nowhere near as great as I thought it would be when I read the product description.  Whats the deal Amazon.com, why are you letting all these bottomfeeders sell their illegal products through your once-great website?",1254355200,12,1788,4.720257234726688
3486761,2,B001B8G4B4,"Sorry but, I was real disappointed with the overall quality of this DVD. The picture was NOT clear, it looks out of focus. The sound is horrible! I could barely watch the dang thing, like what has been brought to attention in other reviews ,the effects sound is so loud you cant hear the dialog. The only reason I gave 2 stars is I just love this cartoon, one of my favorites. I had an old store bought VHS and it way better quality. I just hope the VOL. 2 is better.",1240963200,12,467,4.086956521739131
3486762,5,B001B8G4B4,"First off I own several of the old VHS tapes and was able to do a full comparison and this set rocks!!!

The video is near perfect (I didn't see any green blotches) smooth rendering and obviously taken from the original film. The audio is perfectly fine, no problem with ""bad mixing"" or anything else. I also love the photo gallery!

Highly recommended, makes a great xmas gift!",1229299200,9,378,4.544117647058823
3486763,1,B001B8G4B4,"This poor excuse for a remastering of classic anime is apiece of junk ! Here are my reasons. 1. Why would anyone choose to colorize the image of 8th man and put it on the d.v.d. cover? Everyone knows the series was produced in black and white. Obviously an attempt to attract an audience that would not be interested in this product anyway. Other classic anime series have been remastered using their original black and white artwork for the covers and they look superb. 2. When the d.v.d. arrived I needed to spend one hour cleaning black ink off of it. Probably due to the producers fautly label maker. 3. Ten minutes into watching it the picture broke up into a pixilated mess of blue and green smears. 3. Whoever mixed the 5.1 audio made the effects in the two rear channels so loud that the center dilogue channel could not be heard . The effects even if they weren't so loud were misplaced, annoying ,and laughable. The original mono track is all any fan would want. Anyone looking for a decent version of the series should check out the original commercially produced V.H.S. tapes.",1225238400,14,1088,4.584615384615384
3486764,2,B001B8G4B4,"The Dolby sound is awful; in fact, you can't even hear some of the dialogue on the dvd.",1216339200,7,87,3.888888888888889

8282211,1,B001B8G4B4,This is amateurishly produced and terrible quality. Why is Amazon selling this trash? They are going to ruin their reputation if they keep selling garbage like this. Save your money.,1492560000,,182,5.1
8282212,1,B001B8G4B4,Apparently this is not from the masters of Tezuka Productions because the video is foggy and not clear. Do not buy this to avoid disappointment.,1484611200,,144,4.8

8282214,4,B001B8G4B4,I enjoyed this cartoon as a kid. This is a pretty decent copy.  The stories are very good. The picture quality is good on some episodes and better on others.,1463356800,,157,4.233333333333333
8282215,4,B001B8G4B4,"This was the only cartoon I liked as a child.  My guess it might have been pulled because the ""energy booster"" 8th Man  needed looked & smoked like cigarettes; something one would not encourage a child to do.  Still, I liked the character names:
1. Chief Fumble-thumbs
2. Professor Genius
3. Jenny Heart-sweet",1441929600,,309,4.7924528301886795

8282218,3,B001B8G4B4,"It pretty much follows almost exactly as I remember it.  However, being about 6-7 years old when I first saw this series, well,
let's just say that time can distort some memories.  Pretty campy, for one.  But, all in all, I would definitely recommend this
for anyone who can remember the series.  When comparing it to today's animated fare, DON'T!",1386201600,5,347,4.733333333333333
8282219,2,B001B8G4B4,"No. It does not appear to have been remastered (at least not by anyone who knows what the term means) at all, video or audio.",1374537600,3,125,4.04
