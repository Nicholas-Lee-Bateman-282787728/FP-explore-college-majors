7013023,5,B00TLXIQ1W,"Blame nostalgia for my favorite band and one of the best years of my life, but this film was brilliant. I only watched for the Roses, but the coming of age love story was entertaining even if predictable. Will watch again just to dance....",1455408000,2,239,4.454545454545454
7013024,5,B00TLXIQ1W,I honestly only bought this movie because I'm just becoming a Nico Mirallegro fan and have been binge watching everything he's in. I didn't expect to like the movie that much but I really did. The guys in the cast came off as actually being close and interacted really well. It felt like I was actually watching a group of friends go thru an adventure to travel to see their favorite band and go thru ups and downs together in the process. I've told maybe 3 people now to watch this movie because if you like music or the Stone Roses (who I'm also a fan of now after this movie) then you will most likely find this entertaining!,1453507200,,628,4.285714285714286

7013028,2,B00TLXIQ1W,"I like and am drawn to stories like this one.  However, while many good elements were present, they did not seem to come together cohesively for story telling.",1440028800,,159,4.678571428571429
7013029,4,B00TLXIQ1W,"Loved this movie from start to finish. Excellent performances by all, especially Elliott Tittensor, who plays Tits, and Emilia Clarke who is endearing in this girl next door role. The chemistry between them is perfection - young-love, high school romance as it should be! The music is a lot of fun, gets you in the concert going mood. I enjoyed the antics and moving back stories of all the band characters. Not really for the under 16 set as there are lots of f-bombs flying around and the expected references to drugs, and sex.",1431561600,2,529,4.638297872340425
7013030,4,B00TLXIQ1W,"Really good performances and awesome music! If you like Emilia Clarke from Game Of Thrones & Terminator Genisys and/or the music of The Stone Roses, you should watch Spike Island. The movie provides an entertaining & energetic look at the lives & times of a band (literally) of high schoolers from Manchester in the UK.  A must for any fan of indie movies and indie rock. The songs really stay with you after the credits roll...",1431129600,2,428,4.631578947368421
7013031,5,B00TLXIQ1W,"The music + sweet coming of age romance = a great combination.

7013032,5,B00TLXIQ1W,"Just loved watching SPIKE ISLAND -- Loved listening to the music from THE STONE ROSES!  Emilia Clarke (Game of Thrones) is just perfect in this movie and so is Elliott!  A bit of romance, music and life and the drama that comes along while your living life.",1430870400,4,257,4.446808510638298
