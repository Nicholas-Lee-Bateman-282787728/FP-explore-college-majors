1862320,5,B00008V2US,THis is one of my favorite films of all time.  It has a Godard/Breathless quality to its reckless abandonment of stultifying mainstream cinematic convention.  Instead it careens into a hilarious paralell universe where anything can happen.  Im totally charmed and entertained by its playful charismatic energy.  Retarded brilliance.,1176940800,4,332,5.854166666666667
1862321,5,B00008V2US,"I had the pleasure of meeting Ray Dennis Steckler in 2001 at his store in Las Vegas. I found him to be a funny, modest, well mannered, wacky, generous and very, very knowledgeable man during our three hour visit, so please bear in mind that I am not a totally objective reviewer, as I personally like and respect Ray. During the visit we discussed all his films, particularly ""The Adventures of Rat Pfink and Boo Boo,"" and my personal favorite of the Steckler collection, ""The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living And Became Mixed Up Zombies"" (TISCWSLABMUZ), two films particularly dear to his heart.
In Rat Pfink, the three principals are Ron Haydock (Rat Pfink, the alter ego of a popular singer), Titus Moede (Boo Boo, alter ego of a mild mannered gardener), and Ray's then wife, the lovely and gracious Carolyn Brandt (as the heroine in peril). The plot is a Batman-esque good versus evil story of general mayhem, kidnapping, and fisticuffs. There is music (do not miss the quirky title song, sung by Ron Haydock), and even a special guest appearance by Kogar, the Swinging Ape! Truly this movie has everything that a camp classic should have and more.
A special bonus of the DVD is a director's commentary option, in which you can listen to Ray discuss varying aspects of the film, but please watch the movie once through without that feature first as the audio track is inaudible when the director's commentary feature on. The insights Ray shares into low budget film making are interesting and revealing. It interested me especially how Ray bought the superhero outfits from Sears, and conceived the plot for the film after hearing Ron Haydock's song 'Rat Fink' and thinking that would be useful in a movie. Ray is (correctly) unapologetic about the low budget devices in his film, and has a disdain for mainstream Hollywood which, as he correctly points out, can make a horrible film for $100 million.
This film is a camp classic, and I hope that we see more of the Steckler collection on DVD (hopefully with commentary from Ray) soon. Ray Dennis Steckler is an American original, and I salute his creative energy, ingenuity, and love of his craft. I wish as many people in today's Hollywood genuinely loved movies as much as Ray!",1079654400,11,2249,4.798969072164948
1862322,1,B00008V2US,"""In a world populated by quite a billion souls, there are quite a few who are bound to stand out from the rest...""
Not surprisingly, among those exulted few are the dynamic duo Rat Pfink and Boo Boo.
Released under the mispelled title RAT PFINK A BOO BOO (the budget wasn't big enough to have the error corrected) and filmed in ""Regularscope Black And White"", this unbelieveably bad cult item from Ray Dennis Steckler is best described as an ""exploitative"" parody of the old  60s BATMAN TV show. The majority of this picture looks like someones bad home movies which somehow hit the jackpot and achieved minor cult status. In fact, the ""plot"" in which Rat Pfink and Boo must rescue a beautiful woman who is kidnapped by Korga, ""The Swinging Ape""  (a guy in a bargain basement gorilla suit) only begins to form in the last half hour!  The dubbing is so bad it makes the old GODZILLA movies look like Oscar contenders.
The store I rented this from ...  said ""This isn't bottom of the barrel, this is under it!"". I agree. Grab a shovel and start digging. But movies this bad only come along every once in a while, so it's worth seeing as a curiosity; but don't say you weren't warned. And believe me: There is NO WAY this movie could be rated higher than 1 star!",1050364800,6,1259,4.437229437229437
7986981,5,B00008V2US,"My friend was the one who showed me this movie and he swears that the first time I saw these two ""heroes"" in costume, I laughed out loud for 15 minutes. I believe him. There's no plot to speak of, but there is a gorilla in the film, and everyone knows that gorillas make ANY movie better!",1463616000,,288,4.0701754385964914
7986982,5,B00008V2US,"I first heard about this wonderfully bad movie on the comedy audio commentary on The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living And Became Mixed-up Zombies and knew one day I would have to get it.

I finally broke down and got it and I was so glad I did.  The movie is bad but bad in a cheesy good way.  I mean what can be said about a singer and a gardener with no super powers becoming superheroes, and those costumes that were clothes purchased from Sears and put together as a crimefighter costume.

And as Rat Pfink told Boo Boo we only have one weakness....BULLETS.  So grab a bag of popcorn, pour yourself something to drink, sit back and enjoy yourself to Rat Pfink, Boo Boo, Cee Bee and even a gorilla.",1461024000,,716,4.353383458646617

7986985,5,B00008V2US,Excellent DVD!!!,1415232000,,16,7.5
7986986,5,B00008V2US,"The film is devided in two parts. The first half is a dark creepy thriller. The second half is an adventure comedy-a super hero parody. I loved the first part more. The music-soundtrack from start to finish is fantastic, i adore it! Amazing tunes. The magnificent intro theme seems to be influential on Tarantino. Actually the first part has been copied by many horror films (Black Christmas), giallo films and Brian De Palma!! The Thrill Killers was also, another highly influencial Steckler film. The virtuoso camera work is tremendous, once again. The photography is hard to describe! Never seen anything like it! It's black and white with color tinting! Wow! Unique cult film. 4.5 stars",1387497600,,690,5.008695652173913
7986987,3,B00008V2US,"You do not need to consult your doctor: the sound of your jaw hitting the floor while watching Ray Dennis Stecklers Rat Pfink A Boo Boo (1966) is perfectly natural. Even the titles origin is enough to numb you, from head to toe, in disbelief. The original title was supposed to be Rat Fink and Boo Boo, but in the editing Fink was misspelled Pfink and somehow the ND from AND was left out. With a threadbare budget the producers could not afford to change it, and the misspelled title stuck.

Director Ray Dennis Steckler claimed that the film was shot on a $20.00 budget and that he made it because of his love for the (dreadful) serial, Batman and Robin (1949). I believe him. Remarkably, this was Stecklers sixth film. His first was Wild Guitar (1964), which became something of a cult hit despite starring would-be teen idol Arch Hall Jr. (who was cast because daddy produced). For years, The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies (1964) was thought to be more legend than actual film. Sinister Cinema dug up a print and released it, I think, before anyone else did. There went the legend. Unfortunately, its a dull unimaginative affair about a psycho, with nary a zombie in sight. The Thrill Killers (1964) starred Steckler himself under his pseudonym Cash Flagg (chosen because he made his checks out to cash!) Again, Steckler seemed to put more effort into a name than he did he actual plot. Steckler was Cash again, this time doing a second-rate imitation of the second-rate Bowery Boy Huntz Hall in The Lemon Grove Kids Meet the Monsters (1965).  Steckler claimed that he made the film as a kind of fans valentine to Hall. One must give him some kind of credit for authentic obsession and affection, even if the finished product was nothing more than a series of loosely assembled shorts, with Cash pitted against the Green Grasshopper and The Vampire Lady From Outer Space.

A crazy title is no guarantee of an entertaining flick, but Rat Pfink A Boo Boo obtained its odd moniker unintentionally and, for once, the sheer lunacy of the movie matches the name. Lonnie Lord is a multi million selling rock singer who likes to ply his trade on the street corners (it probably goes down easier if you don't ask). His girlfriend Cee Bee (Stecklers wife Carolyn Brandt) is terrorized by the Chain Gang thugs. (Steckler seemed to get a thrill watching Brandt terrorized, because even after the two divorced he continued hiring her to play a perpetual victim).

Midway through, the film switches gear and becomes a comedy with our heroes finally appearing as the title characters. Throwing on ski masks and long johns, they chase the Chain Gang through the neighbors backyards (Steckler must have put on a hell of a barbeque). The final, elongated chase scene takes place in the middle of a local Christmas parade, which Steckler and his ragtag team crashed. The cherry on top of the icing on top of the cake comes in the guise of a guy in a gorilla suit showing up for the finale.

Lack of money for a sound team necessitated all the dialogue being added in post-production. Predictably, it doesnt always sync up and, upon hearing the dialogue, one might question their having gone to the trouble: We have only one weakness: bullets. Lets go fight crime. The sound effects match the absurdity of the slipshod fight scenes. The weirdness level is even more off the meter since Steckler tinted the film, possibly as an homage to silent serials. Rat Pfink A Boo Boo is available in both black and white and the color tinted version, with a blue first half and orange second half. It actually makes the film stranger: impossible, but true.

In a making of interview Steckler tells us that if we knew what he and his team had gone through to make the film, we would watch it 100 times. I don't know if I have enough time in this mortal coil to throw a 100 more weird movie parties, but I will take Steckler at his word and try to make room for Rat Pfink A Boo Boo during the next one.

7986988,5,B00008V2US,"Besides ""ATTACK OF THE 50 FT. WOMAN"" this has got to be my second favorite movie. Sure it is goofy and
dumb, but that's what makes it so good.  The acting is quite stupid but very fun. (Dig those gas prices.)
I don't think you won't be sorry to add this one to your collection.",1286323200,,277,4.036363636363636
7986989,3,B00008V2US,"I was a good friend of Titus Moody, who plays Boo Boo.  He was a wonderful person and , sadly, has passed on.  I am so glad Ray's films are out now so everyone can see Titus.  Though I know these films are pretty bad, you have to be a fan to understand and enjoy them.  If you are not a fan you will sit there in a totally confused state wondering what is going on.  But that is the charm of it all.  And remember Boo Boo, you only have one weakness.  Bulllets.",1274486400,3,461,3.8404255319148937
