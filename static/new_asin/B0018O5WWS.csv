John Oliver is best known for his mock news reporting on The Daily Show with John Stewart. John Oliver follows in the footsteps of Stephen Colbert and Steve Carrell and easily lives up to expectations. Oliver's special focuses largely on politics, newscasting, and some classic commentary on the differences between Britons and Americans (Oliver was born in Britain and educated at Cambridge). His ability to take the ""outsiders"" perspective on American life while fully embracing it is unique. I was thrilled to see him get his own 1-hour comedy special on Comedy Central (reproduced here uncensored and with additional features). Highly recommended for fans of the Daily Show and Colbert Report!",1218067200,22,822,5.134328358208955
3418001,5,B0018O5WWS,John Oliver has become the master observer and elucidator of contemporary American politics and society. Most people consider him entertaining; I consider him essential to awareness of chicanery underway in high places.,1415750400,2,219,5.875
3418002,5,B0018O5WWS,What more is there to say...we are in love with John Oliver!  Any additional content with him that we can get is golden!,1410998400,,120,4.217391304347826
3418003,3,B0018O5WWS,"My family, who are big Oliver Fans found this DVD to be not quite up to the standard set by John in the last 2 years.  He can do better.",1398729600,5,136,3.533333333333333
3418004,4,B0018O5WWS,I heard John's routine on Satellite radio and had to buy the stand up routine. I was not disappointed. Worth buying if you love good comedy and love John Oliver.,1392508800,,161,4.4
3418005,5,B0018O5WWS,Another standup from one of my favorite comedians to add to the pile. This show was VERY enjoyable and worth every penny spent.,1375833600,4,127,4.565217391304348
3418006,5,B0018O5WWS,"Others have commented on John himself and on the main feature of the DVD, so I thought I'd comment on the overall package. The main show's a bit over 50 minutes long, but John manages to pad the disc out to somewhere around 2 hours of content when you include all the other clips included. Heck, the menu screen's video loop is over 10 minutes long just by itself. Other bonus materials include four clips from the Daily Show, another shorter stand-up routine (though admittedly, a few jokes are repeated), some banter with the incredible Andy Zaltzman, and a few other miscellaneous fourth-wall-breaking monologues.",1257465600,11,616,4.9326923076923075
3418007,5,B0018O5WWS,"A funny take on America and Americans by British comic John Oliver.  He's a writer and ""correspondent"" on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.  It's something that I can watch over and over again.",1233100800,3,192,4.617647058823529
3418008,5,B0018O5WWS,"He is not as funny as John Pinette or Jeff Dunham, but still good comedy.",1231113600,2,73,3.933333333333333
3418009,5,B0018O5WWS,I saw bits and pieces of this on Comedy Central and decided I had to buy it.  I bought it and what do you know it is hilarious.  I can't wait until John Oliver gets his own show.,1227571200,4,178,3.6578947368421053
3418010,5,B0018O5WWS,"John Oliver has a hysterical perspective on the world's current position in history.  My wife is a high school history teacher and she wants to try to show segments of this to her class because they are so funny, yet so true to historical fact.  I watched the show when it originally aired on Comedy Central and have watched the DVD twice, and still laugh at it.  John Oliver is young and I hope he has a great future in comedy so that we see much more of him.  This DVD should be a great start on that path.",1221696000,7,508,4.101010101010101

8270328,5,B0018O5WWS,John Oliver has never done anything that I didn't find entertaining and informative that I know of...I love seeing him in person and this DVD has just been like the cherry on top...thank you...if you have any way to obtain tickets to one of his HBO broadcasts...I would buy them and travel to see it.,1432512000,2,300,4.472727272727273
8270329,5,B0018O5WWS,"John Oliver has become my favorite comedian.  He is incisive without being abrasive, highly perceptive and intelligent and, most of all, very, very funny; and he is all of that without being obnoxiously abrasive.",1424304000,,212,5.235294117647059
