8706530,5,B00UGQABCA,"Not having the quality of comedy of YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, MY COUSIN VINNY was breaking ribs in its opening release. Marisa Tomei Owns this film. The Oscar she won for her performance declares that. Paring she and Joe Pesci was nothing short of genius. Released in 1992, MY COUSIN VINNY is a laugh-and-a-half gem. Haven't seen it, what are you waiting for?",1501286400,,353,4.80327868852459
8706531,2,B00UGQABCA,"Substantively, this is a great movie.  This Blu-ray disc is not so great because the image for the movie is both letter boxed and pillar boxed.  This causes the image to be much smaller than is necessary on your television.  Effectively it eliminates at least 1/3 of your television screen.  This sort of technical issue is unforgivable in a Blu-ray DVD and I recommend that you pass on purchasing it.",1496707200,2,401,4.685714285714286
