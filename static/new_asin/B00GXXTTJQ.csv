6123888,5,B00GXXTTJQ,My first cardio workout was yesterday. Wicked fun! The time flew by. I didn't even realize I was working out so hard until I went to climb stairs afterwards. I can't wait to do it again tonight.,1390867200,40,194,4.27027027027027
6123889,5,B00GXXTTJQ,"This is by far my favorite Richard yet. I  LOVED this so much Ibought one for my niece, my friend and my sister. I am also thinking of another one as a birthday gift :-)",1389657600,2,169,3.8285714285714287
6123890,5,B00GXXTTJQ,The panning has been done for you. Just pop in the dvd and go. Easy to follow and doesn't stress your body.,1389484800,5,107,3.909090909090909
6123891,3,B00GXXTTJQ,"I just received the Richard Simmons Project HOPE from amazon and it comes with 3 DVD's, a nutritional guide and a success guide but no foodmover. you have to go onto the Richard Simmons site and buy the foodmover. I ordered from amazon because I didn't want to deal with the Richard Simmons site. I have read on the internet many people complaining about extra charges on the bill and not be able to cancel if they change their mind while ordering. I will still use the DVD's but just wanted to alert the buyers on Amazon that the foodmover is not with this offer!
I do like Richard Simmons DVD's he always makes working out fun! I only gave this a 3 star rating because it was not clear that the foodmover didn't come with the DVD's.",1389312000,42,734,4.326086956521739
6123892,5,B00GXXTTJQ,I was seriously out-of-shape and needed a program that started gently and became more challenging as time went on. I am two weeks away from finishing the last month and I can see a huge difference in both my strength and stamina.,1389312000,69,229,4.476190476190476
6123893,5,B00GXXTTJQ,This is a great set of motivational information and low-impact exercises designed to start you out slowly and carefully increase in intensity as you get  in shape.  Richard Simmons is the best!,1388793600,5,193,5.0
6123894,1,B00GXXTTJQ,"I used to teach line dancing so I thought - this should be a piece of cake, right? Wrong. I really wanted this to be good...it's not, not for me anyway. I so need to exercise. I so do not want to. I so wanted to find something that would be entertaining enough to help me get/stay motivated.

The very first part is going through the moves that will be used in the workouts. These were presented too quickly - and with too little explanation of steps - to pick up without stopping/starting multiple times - not a good start. The actual workout routines [at least the first and only one I attempted] moved too quickly with little to no instruction.

Glad I didn't spend a lot of money on this - it will end up in a yard sale...",1519603200,,726,4.178571428571429
6123895,2,B00GXXTTJQ,I am disappointed in the contents.  Instead of a list of what you can eat like in his previous systems its more of a menu recipe book type.  I already have the food mover but had lost the books for it and I was hoping to use it with this system but there is no real chart.,1518998400,,272,3.754385964912281

Have ordered lots of Richard Simmons DVD's, this is the only one that didn't work, rest were wonderful.  My fault for tossing the packaging so  did not return.",1512172800,,281,4.384615384615385

6123905,5,B00GXXTTJQ,"I used parts of this video during my spine/neck surgery recovery.  Most of it is low impact, and he frequently reminds you ""neck up"" which was perfect during my recovery.  Plus Richard is always so happy, you cannot help but to smile all the while.  A gentle and fun video to get back into shape :-)",1500595200,,299,4.303571428571429

6123927,3,B00GXXTTJQ,"I should have read the description further, but be aware this pack does not inlcude the actual Food Mover device, only a nutrition guide based on the system.  The first DVD has a long, long intro where Richard shows how each individual exercise move is performed and its name.  I was hoping to just start in exercising like his other videos, but after about 20 minutes, I gave up and put in a different DVD from another series.  And sadly, Richard is showing his age in this video.  I admire him for keeping at it all these years, but he didn't quite seem to have the energy and physical ""wow"" that made him so famous; it was actually a little saddening.  After watching the video, I think I see why he's gone into seclusion.  This set might not be an integral part of my New Year's weight loss plan. :(",1482969600,2,803,4.32

6123941,3,B00GXXTTJQ,"Theres 3 cd,s,, the first 2 were fine,liked the music,the workouts. Just wish it were only people needing to lose weight working out with Richard ,not very motivating watching thin people workout when they don't need it like us who do need to lose weight. The 3rd Cd the workout is good but the music isnt. The music is really bad bad cant barely hear it and not fun to work out to. And only a few over weight people and the rest all in good physical shape. Some so thin it looks stupid watching them workout. Not very motivating at all. Cant wait to finish this last Cd. Whats motivating for me with a workout CD is people who are working hard to lose weight like myself cause we are overweight. Not to skinny people or in people who are already in good shape. I like Richard,his CD,s are fun and he,s motivating,funny and cares about people.",1475280000,6,843,4.341772151898734

6123958,5,B00GXXTTJQ,"This is a great, 3-month program for jump starting your weight loss. There are 3 dvd's in the folder, and 2 booklets. The booklets are a ""success guide"" which explains how the program works, offers tips for success, and provides a workout rotation calendar for each of the three months. The other booklet is the ""foodmover nutrition guide."" It includes instructions for using the food program, setting your weight loss goal, meal program tips, a 7 day ""blast off meal program,"" a 90 day meal program with calendar, and complete menus for 30 days of the food program. There is also advice on how to maintain the program, a food substitution list, and information about ""portion distortion."" There are 9 workouts on 3 dvds. Each DVD contains a cardio workout, a toning workout, and an extra challenge workout. The month 1 dvd is called ""Commit"", month 2 is ""Push"" and month 3 is ""Burn.""

Unlike the ""Sweatin to the Oldies"" videos he is famous for, this is a more contemporary style of fitness and exercise program. If you prefer the oldies workouts, you can probably use one of those in place of the monthly cardio workout on these dvds (or just alternate this program with your favorite ""oldies"" workouts).

I suffer from a bad knee myself, so I sympatize with Mr. Simmons' recent knee difficulties. I don't know if he has a soft tissue injury or some other kind of knee problem. I periodically experience bursitis of the knee, which is an inflammation of the soft tissues around a pinched bursa. It is painful like nothing else I've ever experienced in life! Also, soft tissue injuries take a very long time to heal. Once I pinch a bursa, I can expect to be on crutches for 6 to 8 weeks at a time, which is really depressing, since I do like to stay fit, and by the time the knee heals, I'll be very out of shape and have to start over from square one. A good workout program like Richard Simmons Project H.O.P.E. is a great program to get back into your exercise routine after an injury, or just after a long sedentary period in your life.

I hope that Mr. Simmons will recover well from his knee problems. I realize it's difficult to bounce back from an orthopaedic injury in your seventies, but it is possible. I remember taking a dance seminar once, many years ago, from a seventy-something instructor who had just had knee surgery. I don't know what pain meds he was taking, but he was able to get around somewhat gingerly, with the aid of a chair, to teach a choreography to a class of ardent fans. His name was Mahmoud Reda - of the Egyptian Reda Troupe fame, and cinema star of Egyptian movies in the 60s and 70s. As far as I know, he's still out there teaching dance! I saw a video of him being interviewed on Youtube not long ago, and he doesn't seem to be in a wheelchair, so never give up!",1465603200,5,2801,4.466796875
6123959,5,B00GXXTTJQ,Given it 5 start just cause I like richard Simmonshow he enjoy helping people ......always thought he was funny but now I have decided to try his workouts for the first just got it in the mail....

6123961,5,B00GXXTTJQ,"This is an easy workout to follow.  Richard includes a learn the moves section, but I didn't use it, just jumped right in and was able to follow along just fine and learn the moves without difficulty.  The only part that caused me any problems at all was the challenge/balance portion.  But, I suffer from vertigo, and the difficulties I suffered were, I am sure, related to that.  Trying to maintain balance caused me more physical distress than the aerobic and toning exertion.  However, with certain strategies, I can make it through the balance exercises without undo difficulty.",1463702400,5,583,4.908163265306122

It does not come with the calorie counter gadget but that's ok when I do count calories I use my Weight Watcher calculator I still have as I am a drop out I hit my goal & gained it back after 2 years & have been up & down with weight every since! I have a thyroid issue that doesn't help either! It's not Weight Watchers fault it really does work if you stay with it!!,1462752000,2,538,3.769911504424779

There is a workout calendar that tells you exactly which workouts to do each day - no individual workout is more than 30 minutes but since you do up to four workouts per day you might be spending as much as 90 minutes ""sweatin""/""tonin"" in a day. I like that I can break it up into smaller pieces because I have two small children in my house! Some have complained that it's not intense enough... remember who Richard's main audience is. I'm 5' 2"" and over 300 pounds (starting weight) and I can do everything he does, although it is challenging. It is VERY low impact - no jumping, very little bouncing- and it does a great job of stretching you out and cooling you down so you don't get sore muscles.

6124040,5,B00GXXTTJQ,"I didn't see a detailed review when I ordered about what this exactly is so I came on here now that I have had it a while to share the details.  I love Richard Simmons and what he stands for.  I have many of his old and several of his newer DVDS.  I asked a question on Amazon about Project HOPE before purchasing. I hesitated to order since I had so many of his DVDs, yet I love Richard.  I decided to go for it and purchased it from Amazon.  Other reviewers are correct, you do not get the electronic food mover.  (See what all is included in my review below).  No biggie, I had one (the standby old plastic one with windows) from another Amazon purchase (search ""Sweatin' for Life"" on Amazon)  It's just a good tool if you do have it but not imperative. Seeing things visually helps me.

Here is what you get from Amazon:
THREE DVDS:

I feel the main difference between these and his other DVDs (like Sweatin) are the cardio minutes.  You get a workout in a shorter time with these (cardio).
The first month (COMMIT!):

1.  The cardio is about 20 min.  2.  Toning 1 is with weights for 15 min.  3. A Balance section (challenge) for about 10 min. They have their own warm-up/cool down.  I know in some of my old Richard Simmons workouts (like Sweatin to the Oldies, the original) you may have 45-50 min. of cardio.  So, there is the main difference I see.  Some of his other DVDs do have some toning worked in as well, so it just depends what you want.  Personally, I do feel like he uses the arms more effectively in the Project HOPE DVDs.  It may not be true, but I felt like to me I had my arms waving or moving in the air the whole time on this and not quite as much on some of his other older ones.  Therefore, in Project HOPE, your heart rate is kept up and there are some different moves.  He is ""no nonsense"" and as always encouraging.  The music and songs which is a major appeal to me in ones like his Disco Sweat or Sweatin ones is subdued here.  Another important note: You hear counting over the music. The music seems quite low to me compared to this others.  In fact, I really don't notice the music that much at all.  That could be both a pro and a con.  If you love him for mainly the 60's or 80's music blasting..... you will be surprised by the music on this one.  However if you are a no nonsense kind of person and just want to get in, do your workout and get out, then this is the Richard Simmons did for you.  It is modernized.  He has a lot of people doing the workout with him.  You'll see someone that's your shape type in it because he has lot of people in it with him all having fun and showing lots of energy.  The camera seems to focus on a couple of people in month 1 a lot and that is a little annoying, but you see those of all shapes/sizes.

Month two (PUSH!):
1. The cardio is bumped up to 25 min.  2.  Toning is again 15 min and, 3. The challenge section is  abs. (classic crunch, the plank and the Superman).

Month 3 (BURN!):

1. Cardio is about 30 minutes 2. Toning is again 15 and, 3. Challenge is endurance (nine exercises that target your upper body, in between,  plus standing core moves to sharpen balance skills and tone your tummy.)  This challenge is very well done.  In fact, all three months challenges are well done.

SUCCESS GUIDE & FOODMOVER NUTRITION GUIDE (with menus)

Important note!  The FOOD MOVER is NOT included in this set at Amazon.  It does come with:
1. A Success Guide: This is a 27 page booklet that has the schedule in it.  He does not do all three exercise sessions most days so it is important to read this!!!!!  So, if you do not read instructions, you are missing the rotation he has in this for you. You exercise 6 days a week with one day off (he uses Sunday, you could modify for you.)  For example, on week five on Monday, you do ""Cardio 2"" (25 min) and Toning 2 (15 min).  On Sat., you do Cardio 2 (25 min.) and Challenge abs (10 min.) Another example is in week 11, he does Cardio 3, then Toning 3 two times that day.  So, this is the rotation key to making the plan work as intended!

2. It also comes with a Food Mover nutrition guide which includes a 90 day menu calendar with menus for meals.  So, if you can read the menu and list on what to buy and read when to eat it, you can follow this program if you choose to do the food aspect of the program.  It is an EXCELLENT food guide, using ""real"" foods not hard to find (like chicken, turkey, oatmeal, yogurt, etc.).  You won't find any thing that cost a fortune to make like you'd get on some plans.  I could easily use my normal grocery budget to purchase these foods in other words.  You won't see exotic hard to find items.

It says on the back that you get one month free of VIP membership to his site, but I have not tried that yet.
This is an excellent FULL program at a great price on Amazon if you want to give it I a try.  It's not as flashy as some of his by any means, but  he treats the entire body with Project HOPE if you do it as he intended. His older dvds give the exercise portion but Richard puts all aspects in an easy plan here.  I'm happy I purchased it.",1401840000,156,5110,4.101010101010101

On each CD, there are 3 different workouts, one being cardio, the second toning, and the third, challenge and balance. I am only on month one, and have not moved past cardio. Each work out is 20 minutes, and I do sweat and barely get through. I enjoy how I can modify my workout, but most times do not need to, as I am not jumping on the floor. Richard Simmons has updated his studio, and his music, but the results are there. I would recommend this as the workout exercises are easy to learn and fun too.
