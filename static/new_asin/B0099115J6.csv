5277693,5,B0099115J6,As I feel about most of Maya's yoga dvd's-I loved it. It is really alot of fun! The music is great. I do alot of Kundalini yoga and do this one at least 1-2 times per week just because it's a fun change. Really lets out the inner child in you!,1360540800,8,243,3.784313725490196
5277694,5,B0099115J6,"Yoga for Energy is a unique hour-long Kundalini yoga practice which is dance-inspired. The practice starts by ""tuning in"" with a mantra, proceeds to a series of at least one exercise/movement (or ""kriya,"" as they're called in Kundalini) for each chakra, and ends with some stretches and a mantra closing. Many of the exercises require chanting or singing aloud, which might be a concern for people (like me) with shared living space. All but a couple of stretches and exercises at the end (forward bends, savasana etc.) are done standing - which I liked - and I found it had a lot more of an aerobic effect than most yoga practices, even active kundalini practices. There is at least one move that is high impact (essentially running in place), which could be an issue for some people, especially since the practice is done barefoot, but I just modified to marching in place when I started to feel some pain.

Many of the exercises in this practice will likely seem a little strange to most people, especially if you've had no previous exposure to kundalini yoga. For example, the very first exercise involves bouncing up and down on the heels for five minutes while freely moving your upper body around, eventually also making gibberish sounds aloud. I did find them very energizing, however, and I felt great after finishing the practice. That said, there are several kriyas that are repeated for around five minutes, and I found time was really dragging by the end of it.

Overall, I quite liked this DVD. Beyond a couple of sections where the exercises dragged on too long for me, the time went by fairly quickly, and I had fun and felt happy and energetic at the end. I enjoyed the music Maya Fiennes composed to go along with the practice, which ranged from tribal drumbeats to vocal singing to upbeat reggae-ish music with guitars. I have several of Maya's earlier self-produced works, and the quality is similar here with the exception of one thing: on her new Gaiam releases they didn't do a good job of somehow adding some contrast to the white-clothes-on-a-white-background aesthetic. While you can see everything she does clearly on the older releases, she fades into the background here. Many of the movements here are full body, creative, and have room for self-expression, so there was only one point where the filming actually obscured what it is I should be doing.",1358812800,26,2381,4.804878048780488
5277695,4,B0099115J6,"I love Kundalini yoga but don't have time to practice in the studio. Thats why I own some DVDs to do it at home as soon as I wake up. I love Gurmukh, Ana Brett and Ravi, and of cause Maya. They all have different styles and it keeps it interesting. I was worried about this DVD even though I own Dance through chakras by Ana, so I knew I liked the idea. In the begining I was disappointed because the background and Maya clothes are so white, they literally blend together. But its actually no big deal as I soon realized it still easy to recognize the movement. Overall I loved this DVD. The dance is very refreshing alternative to traditional movements. Maya goes through chakras with different dance moves. I absolutely loved heart chakra as it adds tai chi elements. After the dances are finished Maya does a bit of stretching, relaxation and Sat Nam closing. Overall If you like Kundalini I think you would enjoy this DVD, especially if you want something different in your practice. Its a good cardio as well. Enjoy.",1355702400,18,1022,4.5

8537778,4,B0099115J6,"I have done other videos by Maya and I really enjoy them. This one is no exception -- it's very enjoyable and has nice music too. I did feel more energized after doing this video! It incorporates dance, mantra, meditation and yoga asanas. You can see the joy and peace radiating out from Maya -- she just makes you feel happier and calmer somehow. It can sometimes feel a little repetitive, but if you do the correct number of repetitions you will feel better. I wish there had been even more dance in it. But I recommend it for a different type of yoga video, and a way to feel peaceful yet energized.",1451952000,,602,4.336283185840708
8537779,1,B0099115J6,"I hate the fact that you buy something and then it starts out with ads again.  it seems like a lot of her stuff is like that.  I DON""T WANT THE ADS!!",1414713600,,149,3.625
8537780,2,B0099115J6,"no yoga exercises here,it's all about dance; meditation has been recycled, you can find it on you tube.  If you look for kundalini yoga kriyas and pranayama, this dvd is not for you",1389312000,,181,4.484848484848484
8537781,4,B0099115J6,Fun DVD to workout with.  Not sure if I would like this for everyday but it is a nice change from the everyday workout.,1384300800,,119,3.9583333333333335
8537782,3,B0099115J6,"I like Maya Fiennes, but this wasn't as much fun as I was hoping. I found some of the moves to be a bit boring and repetitive and I wasn't left feeling like I got much of a challenging workout. I did have to modify one of the moves which was the running in place, since I live on the third floor of an apartment building. Easy low impact cardio but I like the way she integrates the mantras.",1374796800,2,391,3.962025316455696
8537783,5,B0099115J6,"there really are no words for how amazing this work out is.  It connects the spiritual and cardio and yoga and the music is sublime..After I do this routine I feel incredible and truly joyful...The filming of her in white is a bit off, but it doesn't matter in the long run...this routine is gold!!!!!! I have a lot of Maya Fiennes stuff (she's a great teacher).  I think this along with the ""detox and destress"" and ""be happy"" dvd is my favorite...I cannot say enough good things about this routine though.  It really does hit all the bases for what I need from yoga (pumps my blood, meditative, centering, opening, and grounding).  Thank you Maya..you are a gem!",1371945600,11,664,4.554621848739496
8537784,5,B0099115J6,"I consider myself an expert on all Maya Fiennes workouts that Amazon sells, as I have and use them ALL, daily.  That being said, this one is the most unique of them all.
It is formatted more like a tantric dance workout than a kundalini yoga routine, (similar to the one by Shiva Rea, if you are familiar with that).
I really appreciate this workout, it is mostly standing and really gives you permission to sway and move and do your own thing.  I feel that sometimes with asanas, it is easy to stagnate into the pose. It's almost as if you need permission to move your head a different way that would feel better than is shown.  With this video everything is very freeing and aerobic in nature.  It is very joyfilled and I love it.  It is a must have for the Maya Fiennes Kundalin yoga collection.",1368403200,10,798,4.328859060402684
8537785,5,B0099115J6,Love all of Maya's videos just purchased this for variety. Theres no way you can lose by purchasing anything she does.,1362355200,5,118,4.666666666666667
