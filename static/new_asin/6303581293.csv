8448296,4,6303581293,"I enjoyed this movie very much.  Michael Beck's portrayal of the alcoholic, overly possesive, violent husband is great to watch.  All his fans should have this movie in their collection.  Robert Ulrich is the quiet reluctant hero, caring father and concerned new friend. Markie Post is believable as a strong woman in over her depth. While the plot may be somewhat predictable, there are enough twists and character developments to make this a worthwile view and a welcome addition to any fan of any of the stars.",1103932800,2,513,4.873563218390805
