8381361,4,B002UOMGVA,"Great animation, love the voice acting. Interesting plot. Just an all around fun show to watch. I've just purchased season 2, so will wait to see how this turns out! The millenium earl is creepy in a cartoonish sort of way, but not sure if I like the clan of Noah idea or not yet.",1285372800,,280,4.109090909090909
