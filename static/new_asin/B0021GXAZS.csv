8349022,4,B0021GXAZS,"Having been deeply involved with movies for longer than I care to mention here, I am always surprised and thrilled to discover a ""new"" and notable director from the ""golden age"" of cinema.  Two years ago, it was the truly great Mikio Naruse.  Last year the powerful melodramatist Rafaello Matarazzo.  This year's find is the Finnish Teuvo Tulio who made a series of amazingly intense films from the thirties to the fifties, described by one online commentator as ""sagas of sex and suffering"".  That was enough for me, and I immediately ordered this first of three sets of his complete surviving works.  This box includes three films from the thirties and one from the forties, all with English subtitles and interesting extras.  Added to The Way You Wanted Me, the best of the four, is a simultaneously shot Swedish version which comes from a better print than the Finnish, with more clearly visible and sometimes important detail.  Each disc also has an informative short on Tulio's life and career.  As I write this, I am eagerly awaiting delivery of the second Teuvo Tulio set which covers the rest of his forties work, including The Cross of Love and Restless Blood.  If these titles sound appealing, Tulio is your man!",1333324800,,1223,4.813397129186603
