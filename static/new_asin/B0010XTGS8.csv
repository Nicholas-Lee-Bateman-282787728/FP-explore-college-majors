8276603,3,B0010XTGS8,I'm a dance teacher and love to stay educated through instructional dance dvds. I purchased this dvd but wasn't totally satisfied.  I found it more of ballet than contemporary dance.  The teacher didn't break down counts well and honestly I felt lost at times. I did however pick up some choreography I could use.,1381104000,,313,4.777777777777778
