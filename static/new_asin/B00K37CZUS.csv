8655662,4,B00K37CZUS,"Lots of very good dancing! Kaya, of Sadie and Kaya fame, looking quite Suhaila-like in what seems to be one of her earliest performances caught on camera (no dates listed).
  The biggest and best! surprise is the dancer simply listed as ""Eva""! She is surely the fabulous Eva Cernik!
  This dvd is a hidden gem for the dance enthusiast. Great price and lots of content!
  Only 4 stars simply due to video resolution. It's somewhat grainy.",1404950400,2,437,4.684210526315789
