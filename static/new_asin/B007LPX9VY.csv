8519451,5,B007LPX9VY,"Excellent instruction. This isn't a technique dump, this DVD goes through thought processes and tiny adjustments that high level BJJ practitioners must make. Roy gives you a chain of options as opposed to 1 technique. Roy's analysis and dissection of BJJ positions and theory is priceless. Worth a watch at any belt, maybe not whitebelt, but hey, he's got a great DVD for whitebelts too.",1502755200,,387,4.969230769230769
8519452,1,B007LPX9VY,This DVD isn't near as good as Mr. Dean's Blue and Purple belt DVD's which are easily five star instruction dvd's.  In this set Mr. Dean re-hashes a lot of the techniques shown in Blue/purple with very little new insight.  I was hoping to see some of his views/techniques on throws and takedowns but none were included which is funny because on the dvd case he is perform a throw.  So this dvd is a waste but I definitely endorse buying the blue and purple belt dvd's.,1416787200,,468,4.35632183908046

8519454,5,B007LPX9VY,"Again Mr. Dean has put together another GREAT video. His video's are the right info at the right time. If your honest with your self you'll know your skill level and can use these video's well. This  Brown blt vid is very well laid out. A good amount of techs but more importantly how's and why's and what we should be working on at this level. Being I have the Blue, Purple, and Brown Belt video and I know the info on the bl-ppl vids is perfect for me and the info in the Brown Blt vid is cool it is above my skill level at this time. But it gives me an idea on what to be looking for as my knowledge improves. The good thing is now that we have it and seen it we know what we are working towards.",1399248000,,699,3.888111888111888

8519457,5,B007LPX9VY,"""Brown Belt Requirements: Pressure and Efficiency"" by Roy Dean focuses on refining one's practice of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.  As the title of the set indicates, it's about pressure and efficiency.  The set includes 3 DVDs and an Audio CD.

DVD 1 contains instructional footage on: pressure; footlocks; the top game; the bottom game; passing the guard; and counters and escapes.  It also includes an introduction segment and a demonstration titled expressing the technique.  Although a number of techniques are shown, the purpose is not simply to advocate an accumulation of techniques.  Rather, the techniques are shown as examples of creating pressure and/or improving efficiency.

DVD 2 contains rolling examples and a brown belt evaluation.  This footage is great because you can see the principles of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu brought to life during the sessions.  Mr. Dean provides voiceovers during the sessions describing what is going on both on the mat and in his mind.  The brown belt evaluation features Mr. Dean's instructor, Roy Harris, who gives great advice on how to create pressure and improve efficiency.

DVD 3 contains five purple belt demonstrations.  Much like DVD 2, you get to see the principles of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu brought to life.  The demonstrations contain a technique segment and a rolling segment.  It is interesting to see how each demonstrator performs their techniques and weaves together their combinations.  This time you don't get Mr. Dean providing a voiceover, but you should be able to begin your own analysis of the demonstrations.

The Audio CD contains the musical tracks composed by Mr. Dean.  These are tracks that Mr. Dean uses as background music during the demonstrations, trailers, etc.  It is great to listen to during training sessions.

""Brown Belt Requirements: Pressure and Efficiency"" is well balanced between being advanced and being accessible.  Although much of it is beyond my current skill level, it provides a reference point of where I would like to get to and how to get there.  This set has changed the way I practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and I'm glad that I purchased it.",1337385600,5,2128,5.181818181818182
8519458,5,B007LPX9VY,"I'm a fan of Roy Dean's clean style and his clear communication.  If you've seen his previous DVDs and any of his online videos, you will be familiar with his smooth style and his straightforward approach to BJJ.  This disc set is for the purple belt student who is looking to up his or her game.  The techniques and philosophies espoused in this set are for the BJJ player who has already developed their intial, personal game and is now looking to put together a more fluid approach to offensive and defensive scenarios.

This is another fine production by Roy Dean which serves as another valuable resource in my library.  I highly recommend it.",1336435200,5,648,4.649122807017544
