Lines you didn't get when you were younger, now are funny.  Too bad it took Steven so long to release this, Animainiacs were clearly his favorite.",1342483200,8,321,4.406779661016949
3820649,5,B001VB8UG8,"Super-teen extraordinaire
Freakazoid! Freakazoid!
Runs around in underwear
Freakazoid! Freakazoid!

Rescues Washington D.C.
Freakazoid! Freakazoid!
Unless something better's on TV
Freakazoid! Freakazoid!

His brain's overloading
It has a chocolate coating
Textbook case for Sigmund Freud
Freakazoid! Freakazoid!

Check out Dexter Douglas
Nerd computer ace
Went surfing on the internet
And was zapped to cyberspace

He turned into the Freakazoid
He's strong and super-quick
He drives the villains crazy
'Cause he's a lunatic

His home base is the Freakalair
Freakazoid! Fricassee!
Floyd the Barber cuts his hair
Freakazoid! Chimpanzee!

Rides around in the Freakmobile
Freakazoid! Freakazoo!
Hopes to make a movie deal
Freaka me! Freaka you!

He's here to save the nation
So stay tuned to this station
If not, we'll be unemployed
Freakazoid! Freakazoid!
Freakazoid!!!",1299974400,36,866,5.88

3820719,5,B001VB8UG8,"Good deal on both seasons.  DVDs are good quality (believe me, you sometimes get companies that use the cheapest media they can find).  Audio commentary is a little brief, only on the first episode or two.  Would have preferred it on ALL the episodes.  Each episode is actually two, so some repeat (Candlejack is part of the first episode and also the last on this).",1355529600,2,366,4.584615384615384
