1716215,4,B000067J17,"It takes real dedication and confidence in one's craft to rise above the leering nature of the script and deliver a layered, subtly nuanced performance. Ms. Welch's sacrifice for art is evidenced by her willingness to flatten her chest and let her leg hair grow for the stunt scenes involving a mad bull.
Seriously, though, I enjoyed the film. A lot. It had some good twists in the silly yet straightforward manner manner of many 60's caper-ish films, a fast pace, some decent writing, some suspense, and nice location shooting.
But it probably would not stand up so well to repeat viewings, as what I enjoyed the most was definitely the skimpy outfits on display. There's nothing like a green bikini to gloss over a movie's shortcomings.
But you knew that.",1039737600,14,757,4.786259541984733
1716216,4,B000067J17,"Raquel Welch is delightful in the sexy spy spoof FATHOM.  FATHOM has just been given its long-awaited DVD release along with the similarly-themed MODESTY BLAISE, OUR MAN FLINT and IN LIKE FLINT.
Fathom Harvill (Raquel Welch) is a dental hygienist-turned-skydiver who is recruited by a bumbling investigator and his young sidekick Timothy (Richard Briers) to uncover a man  (Tony Franciosa) and his Chinese girlfriend (Greta Chi), who have reportedly stolen military secrets and encoded information that could potentially end in the earth's destruction.
Fathom ends up in a series of near-fatal encounters as the enemy changes at every turn.  Fathom, to her horror, discovers that in order to survive she can trust no-one.
The comical script is played dead-seriously with this stellar cast which also includes the fabulous Clive Revill as Fathom's masterly-foil Serapkin.  Welch is luminous in what is regarded as her best film of the 60's, and the film is ably-directed by Leslie Martinson.  (Single-sided, single-layer disc).",1037145600,28,1026,5.427672955974843
1716217,5,B000067J17,"I just got my copy of ""Fathom"" on DVD ..being a huge Raquel Welch fan,and of 60's spy capers i have patiently waited for this movie to finally come on the market. I saw this movie originally when i was 14 years old,and i tried to see if i could get it on video & DVD,but it wasn't avalible.
Probably because of the nastolgia for 60's spy movies,in part due to the sucess of Austin Powers,these gems are finally being re-released i couldn't be happier!
I really enjoyed this film alot,beautifully shot in Spain,i enjoyed chracters,the sets,cars,the costumes,gadgets,and the music..and ah-em ... Raquel Welch,especially in the lime green bikini peddaling the catamaran.
In today's very graphic, sex-voilence action films,Fathom is refreshing,a throw back to the care-free 60's.
I've been turned on to alot of 60's movies,because of the current tastelessness.. of contemporary Hollywood films,Fathom,the Avengers,early Bond flicks,are the perfect antidote for me.
The whole time i was watching Fathom i could image Austin Powers sitting down next to me saying ""yeah baby"" whenever Raquel would appear on film.
This movie is a must have for any collector of 60's spy movies,and of Raquel Welch.
Definatly recomended.
The plot is easy to understand,no complicated Tom Cruise ""Mission Impossible"" here,the bull chase is definatly original in Fathom. Greta Chi who is also very sexy like Raquel in this film is her nemesis,and pulls it off very well...",1029196800,16,1445,5.153191489361702
1716218,4,B000067J17,"The first entry in the FATHOM franchise has all the action and sense of good fun that later entries in the series  so often lacked.  Iconic sex symbol Raquel Welch is in fine form as a skydiving dental hygienist (!!!) recruited by a top-secret government agency to (what else?) save the world.  It doesn't bode well for the defenders of all that is honourable and decent, but with Welch on the case as Fathom Harvill, Mother Earth is in good hands.",1027987200,2,448,4.506172839506172
1716219,2,B000067J17,"It's nothing but a vehicle for Raquel, and a very bad one at that. She's shown in bikini a lot, so if you like the idea of that then it might be worth a watch, if you can tolerate bad acting for 99 minutes. The acting by everyone is very stiff and phony, the script is ridiculous, and there's not a single laugh to be found in it, even though it's allegedly a 'spoof' (the villain looks like the eye-patch guy from ""Thunderball"", so maybe it's supposed to be a Bond spoof, but if so, it fails even more than words can describe.) This movie involved both the director and writer of the 1966 ""Batman"" movie, but the humor and cleverness in that film is not in ""Fathom"", although they obviously tried for the same type of film. I didn't figure on much from this movie, and I like and appreciate sixties films in general, but it delivered even less than I expected. Their first problem was casting Raquel as a skydiver. We see the obvious stunt double doing the hard stuff, then shots of Raquel in a parachute, her hair blowing, against a phony background. Instant disbelief. This is not Fathom the rogue skydiver, this is Raquel Welch, the actress who doesn't have a clue how to skydive. I like to have at least SOME belief in the characters when I watch a movie, but to watch this one, you have to shut off your mind completely and become a total idiot. Raquel looks fantastic, and the soundtrack contains some very good music (almost non-stop, and the only reason for the 2 star rating), but the terrible acting put such a damper on the thing that I could barely make it through it. All the actors recite their corny dialogue as if they're reading from cue cards, with a little bit of 'acting' thrown in, because, well, they're actors (I guess). Raquel tries, but there's nothing good to work with and frankly, I doubt anyone cared - she's just there to look good, and boy does she. It's a shame there's not even a bit of intelligence, sophistication, or successful humor in this film, with the notable exception of the music, which is at various times all of the above. I doubt that even diehard sixties fans and cornball lovers can put up with this failure, unless they're just watching it to look at Raquel, and that was probably the motivation then as now. Skip it unless it's given to you for free.",1027209600,4,2302,4.431603773584905

1716361,4,B000067J17,"Lightweight but highly enjoyable comedy/spy picture features every guy's favorite bikini-wearer Raquel Welch in a role that was clearly designed to exploit her, um, assets more than anything else involved in the movie, but what's wrong with that? Today's pictures really are intense, and not in emotionally positive ways either. Watching this offering from 1967, it is easy to see why it's so enjoyable, nowadays especially. Watching Raquel strut around in that little green bikini, it's hard to focus on the aspects of the movie, but as a spy plot it's not that bad at all--just don't expect this to add up to very much content wise. But let's be honest here. What we really watch movies like this for are the scenery, and there is plenty of that kind of visual splendor on display here, from the great outdoors to the beautiful women (but it's mainly Raquel's show, no complaints from me). Visually, it's an amazing movie. Also, there is a bit of violence since it's a spy movie, but it's a movie that almost anyone can watch and not be emotionally taxed by. Larry Forrester's novel ""Fathom Heavensent"" was apparently never published (according to Wikipedia) but his initial book ""A Girl Called Fathom"" is probably still available at used bookstores (if you happen to be interested in this character).
The picture and sound on the DVD is very good indeed, it all seems clear enough to me. I only wish that Fox would release other hard to find titles from this period, such as ""Hello Goodbye"", ""Justine,"" ""The Secret Life of an American Wife,"" and others. Still, Raquel has never looked as vivacious as she does here, and this a movie that can be enjoyed anytime. B+",1423699200,4,1667,4.771626297577854

As it turns out, the fault is NOT (as one might have ignorantly guessed) Raquel's.  Though hardly one of our greatest actresses, Ms. Welch was capable of a lot better than this, and she proved it on more than one occasion.  The fact that most of the rest of the cast is guilty of bad acting (or bad overacting) reinforces the point.  (The only actor in this movie who knows how to overact really well is Clive Revill as the ludicrous but lethal Sergi Serapkin.)  Ms. Welch is as always charming and beautiful,...

but director Leslie H. Martinson fails to give her much of anything else to do.

The nearly incomprehensible, well nigh (dare I say it?) unfathomable plot doesn't help.  Ms. Welch plays a dental hygienist and amateur skydiver, in Spain for a skydiving competition, who is recruited by a couple of British spies for a very simple task: ""accidentally"" parachute onto a Spanish estate with a radio transmitter in her helmet designed to activate a recalcitrant electronic eavesdropping device they planted there.  Piece of cake, really,...

but it isn't, of course.  Soon she's running for her life, dodging bullets, bulls, BS (the spoken kind), and spearguns, trying to figure out which (if any) of these lying lunatics can be trusted and just what the mysterious MacGuffin they're all after, the Fire Dragon, really is: stolen national treasure or potential trigger to World War III?

Among other things, this makes Fathom look (and the viewer feel) dumb because we never know what the heck is going on.  Not until the very end, when a fully fed up Fathom takes control, do we see glimmerings of what Raquel might have made of this character if given half the chance.  This also pretty much eliminates any possibilities for romance.  What with virtually the entire male cast alternating between drooling over her and trying to kill her, the only way Fathom is even going out to dinner with one of them is to be blackmailed into it.

Much like the last film I watched which mostly exists to display the ample charms of Jennifer Connelly (CAREER OPPORTUNITIES), this is a showcase for the 27-year-old Raquel Welch, clad in a variety of bikinis, one-piece swimsuits, and typically 60s bizarro bright-colored mod miniskirts and short dresses.  I'll tell you right off the bat that if you're not watching this for her, or because you're obsessed with seeing every 60s film that got made directly as a result of the James Bond craze, you could well end up being a little bit disappointed.

Raquel plays Fathom Harvill; her first name gets explained a couple of different times as having different meanings, a joke which has some ramifications in the film (nobody - except, it seems, Fathom - is telling the truth about anything) but gets old quickly as does most of the humor here.  The actual storyline is complex without being really very interesting: young dental hygienist/skydiver Fathom is recruited as a one-time agent to recover a sensitive piece of nuclear equipment from wealthy arms merchants on the coast of Spain, but quickly finds out that the British agents who hired her (Ronald Fraser and Richard Briers) may not be who they seem to be; the nuclear device may in fact not exist, but there's a valuable Chinese antique that these guys and an American who might have defected to China during the Korean war (Anthony Franciosa) are looking for, along with a Russian antiquities collector (Clive Revill).  Everybody's lying, and Raquel's on the run most of the time, but it never feels very compelling and director Leslie H. Martinson, mostly known for his TV work, just doesn't seem to be able to build any excitement.

Still the location work on the Mediterranean coast is nice enough, and Raquel is pretty stunning, and shown off to great advantage throughout.  And there are moments where it seems like the film is going to go deeper into it's ""who is lying to who and for what reason"" plot, and one thing we do keep wondering about is whether Raquel's own character is in fact something more than just a pretty face.  There's a cute little twist at the very end, after a too-long airplane chase, for example, that had me imagining that it might have been intended as the first in a series of films starring a more and more confident Fathom as a real Bond competitor.  It never happened of course, and this is far from the best of the films that followed in Bond's wake so it has largely fallen by the wayside - had it been anybody but Raquel or someone with a similar level of sexy superstardom (Brigitte Bardot?) I suspect it would be totally forgotten.  I liked ogling Raquel enough to not be too bored, but I doubt I'll ever bother with a rewatch; more likely I'll head back to James Coburn in the Flint movies, or Dean Martin's Matt Helm when I want a dose of goofy 60s spy stuff.

This DVD, now apparently out of print, is fine; the colors seem just a touch muted at times but are certainly acceptable, and sound and Cinemascope image are very clear.  No extras worth mentioning.",1264118400,10,3092,4.653211009174312
1716541,3,B000067J17,Raquel's ravishing as a skydiving dental hygienist in this 60s spy spoof that may not be anything special but is still kind of cute. There are three action set pieces that are better than anything in the Flint movies.  Wonderfully dated score by John Dankworth.,1214352000,5,261,4.8
1716542,3,B000067J17,"The spy parody has become revitalized in recent years, particularly because of the Austin Powers series. In the late 60's, however, filmmakers were still trying to capitalize on the popularity of the James Bond pictures. After last year's Casino Royale, the Bond genre is alive and well. Perhaps more spy-spoofs are in order, but I can't fathom why Raquel Welch was never a Bond girl, other than the fact that she simply refused. In Fathom, no bond girl ever looked better than Ms. Welsh. Seeing her in a lime green bikini is reason enough to purchase this film. At the risk of sounding sexist, I can't think of a more beautiful woman ever to grace the silver screen. You simply can't take your eyes off her--and why would you want to? I also didn't wince too badly while wathing Ms. Welch sprint around the Spanish countryside in her little red dress. The use of color in the film adds to the eye candy. The acting here is nothing extrodinary, but one doesn't watch Ms Welch because of her skills as a thespian (although she is underrated). If truth be told, Welch is an icon on the screen because of her stunning beauty. She seemed to be having fun while making this picture, and there's nothing wrong with smiling along with her. Note to guys: If you happen to be watching this one with your girl or wife, try to refrain from mentioning the green bikini. Wait for her to ask you about it (don't worry, she will), and when she wants your opinion, simply say, ""Well, she looks good, of course, but you'd look even better in that bikini."" Smile and enjoy the rest of your evening.",1200787200,8,1580,4.508710801393728

Tony Franciosa definately had some very good Karma to be able to achieve this.  Outside of the obvious...  This is a wonderful movie with terrific acting.  Tony Franciosa is probably the most under rated actor of all time.  He has a great intensity that  shines beneath the smoothest ""one of a kind"" voices on this planet!  Raquel Welch is indescribale...  So Beautiful.. and so Talented!  A fast moving fun movie not unlike a good  James Bond movie with a cute and funny twist.  And  the period in which this was filmed was such an innocent sweet period in our world.  I highly recommend this film for pure escape and great entertainment.",1142899200,11,793,4.625899280575539

Someone took great care to cast lots of colorful eccentrics in the supporting roles, and the beauty of the location is perfectly captured. Of course it's a sub-James Bond fluffball, but the aerial stunts and blue-screen effects are fantastic and the script is a charming collection of witty one-liners.",1119916800,19,524,5.730769230769231
1716546,5,B000067J17,"Fathom open in Finland on December 1, 1967 and open 12 days later in New York City on December 13th 1967. Fathom is a 1967 British spy comedy film directed by Leslie H. Martinson, starring Anthony Franciosa and Raquel Welch. Fathom Harvill (Raquel Welch) is a dental assistant and an American skydiver touring Europe with a U.S. parachute team. A Scottish agent to recover an atomic triggering mechanism approaches her. The film was based on Larry Forrester's second Fathom novel Fathom Heavensent then in the draft stage but never published. His first Fathom novel was 1967's A Girl Called Fathom. The film was one of three 1967 20th Century Fox films about female spies; the others being Doris Day's Caprice and Andrea Dromm's Come Spy with Me.

Summary: The movie opens with a body shot of Fathom pounding in a post. Then Fathom starts to unroll her parachute. She then repacks the parachute. Fathom then heads for the sky to parachute in competition. After winning the skydiving championship in Spain, Fathom Harvill is abducted by a man named Timothy and taken to Douglas Campbell, a Scotsman who claims to be working for NATO intelligence. He enlists her aid in outwitting two teams of foreign agents who are after the ""Fire Dragon,"" a nuclear trigger device that was lost in the Mediterranean following the crash of a bomber plane. Representing Communist China is Serapkin, an eccentric Armenian millionaire. Peter Merriweather is acting for the United States, aided by a glamorous Asian, Jo-May Soon. Fathom parachutes into Merriweather's villa and learns that the ""Fire Dragon"" is a priceless jeweled figurine stolen from a Peking museum by a Korean War deserter who is being pursued by a private detective. Although she now realizes that Merriweather and Campbell are the deserter and the private eye, she cannot determine which is which.

Questions. Who was behind the bull being in an empty arena? Who was behind the harpoon attack on the hotel owner? Who was behind the two knife attacks? What did Fathom find in her makeup case? Why did two men try to grab Fathom? Why was Fathom forced in an airplane?

My thoughts: Fantastic movie right from the start. Anthony Franciosa was good in his role as Peter Merriweather. Now for the star of the movie Raquel Welch who was just Fantastic. Her role as Fathom Harvill was great. The outfits she wore in this movie were out of this world. It started with the tight parachute outfit. From there the green bikini never fit a body better than it did Raquel Welch. I'm use to seeing Raquel in stupid comedy that wastes her talents. However, in this one her talents were used to perfection including that gorgeous body. Because of Raquel Welch and her talent, I give this movie 5 weasel stars.

1716547,4,B000067J17,"It's not possible for me to think clearly when I'm watching a film starring Raquel Welch.  However, when it comes to Raquel, I don't mind a befogged state.

Of course, I'm exaggerating.  But FATHOM is a film I've truly enjoyed the five or six times I've watched it so far.  She's a pleasure to watch here.  And that I would like this film this much surprised me, as I obtained the DVD as one of the films included in the 5-disc&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raquel-Welch-Collection/dp/B00018D418/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raquel Welch Collection</a>, which I bought mostly for MYRA BRECKINRIDGE, about which I'd heard so much but had never seen.  My sheer enjoyment of FATHOM, then, was lagniappe.  It's a delightful farce, very light entertainment, featuring an exotic locale.  It's typical of the escapist, pop-flavored feature films of that period, and it doesn't pretend to be anything other than a Raquel Welch vehicle.  As that, if you're a fan, it succeeds.  Her almost constant screen time, combined with the fact of her jaw-dropping pulchritude, makes this an easy film to watch again and again.  Admittedly, my affection for FATHOM is slightly nostalgic, as it is so fluffy, it reminds me of my own innocence during the time this film was released.  Also Raquel was the reigning Hollywood siren of my generation, her rise to stardom synchronous with my own coming of age.  Therefore, when I'm watching it, it's a different kind of escapism than originally intended.  I assume if you're considering buying this DVD, you're motivated by similar affections.  You're definitely not buying it as part of a study of cinema.  Let's face it: This is not LAWRENCE OF ARABIA; the only art on the screen is what Nature itself embodied in the person of Ms. Welch.

And that's enough art for me.  The rest of it is just plain fun.  To my taste, this is a sort of extended video, and, instead of it showcasing some MTV rock star, it permits me an uncluttered appreciation for this phenomenally beautiful and graceful woman.  If you're a Raquel fan and you're looking for an opportunity to indulge your membership among her fandom, this is a film you'll enjoy.  You'll find it a very relaxing, G-rated, escapist fantasy starring the premier screen goddess of any time.  It'll be time well spent.",1086912000,21,2336,5.060209424083769
1716548,5,B000067J17,"Maybe I'm in the minority here, but I have always liked this film! Raquel Welch (a very under-rated actress IMHO) is very good here as a amateur sky-diver who gets caught up in the spy game in Spain. The new DVD has a wonderful anamorphic widescreen transfer. It is sharp and colorful and sounds great (the music is quite good). The only extras is a poor looking trailer for this film (full screen) and trailers for Fox's other spy spoof releases, ""IN LIKE FLINT"", ""OUR MAN FLINT"", etc. I think it is time to re-evaluate Miss Welch's career and admit that the lady has talent. Start by checking out this film and the wonderful ""THREE MUSKETEERS"" and ""FOUR MUSKETEERS"" from Anchor Bay and ""FUZZ"" with Burt Reynolds and Yul Brynner on MGM DVD.
