6289529,5,B00IRH8J92,"This DVD is amazing!  I love to walk and zumba.  This video is easy to follow, but still gets your heart rate up.  This is my first Jessica DVD and I will be buying more. Great job Jessica!",1404950400,2,189,3.9210526315789473
6289530,5,B00IRH8J92,"Dance Walk lived up to its name plus it's  fun -- which i have never said about a walk tape. You can do both workouts  in the time it takes to watch Rookie Blues. Their twist and turns really help you get pretty close your 10,0000 steps a day - plus you feel good..",1404518400,2,265,3.888888888888889
6289531,3,B00IRH8J92,This video had some extra moves that were new to me since I usually always use Leslie sansone DVDs .....I'll keep it on hand to switch off ....,1403568000,2,143,4.142857142857143
6289532,4,B00IRH8J92,"I did the Dance Walk session on this dvd, and I did like it.  The moves are varied enough to keep it interesting, the music is decent especially the last song, and it's quite doable for me (it's good for beginner-intermediate depending how much bounce and jump you put in) but I still worked up a sweat.  One thing that confused me though is that about 3/4 of the way through she seems to be getting ready for the cooldown, the music slows, there are even a few stretch like moves..then it picks up again, and she has jogging intervals and talks about wanting to spike our heart rates, then a couple brief stretches and its done.  I was thinking each walk would be all inclusive warmup and cooldown.  I still like it though.

I've now also did the Latin Dance walk.  I liked this one a bit better, worked up more of a sweat too and the music is great.  This one does have a bit of a cool down stretch.  Not a long one, but it's probably sufficient for this workout. Very nice.

I would love a time count down and a music only option, but those are minor things.  Jessica talks a lot through it, but not a lot of fluffy false perky chatter, she just seems pleasant and like she'd be really nice in person. Its kind of awesome she has her mom on her. In her youtube videos she often has a really adorable dog with her ""helping"".",1401148800,3,1326,4.205533596837944
6289533,5,B00IRH8J92,"I have now done both workouts on this dvd twice and can I just say how fun they are?  I bought these as an alternate to Leslie Sansone (who I adore, but I have to listen to my own music).  These are low-impact aerobic workouts that really sneak up on you.  Im not much of a dancer, but I used to take Zumba classes and enjoyed it.  I don't think they are too similar, but feel I get in a great sweat-inducing workout in 30 minutes (you get what you put into it).  They are not too dance-y, so do not let the title scare you off.  I work out first thing in the morning, so I cant follow complex choreography or fancy footwork, and even doing these new out of the package, wasn't wandering around lost (Jessica is a GREAT instructor!).  Plus, I feel like Im working out with Jessica and her mom live outside in Sarasota, FL, as these are shot straight through.  Very happy to have these in my collection.  I like the other two workouts in the Walk On series just as much.  Jessica is a gem!",1399852800,8,988,4.12565445026178
6289534,5,B00IRH8J92,"This is one of 3 walking workouts recently released by Jessica Smith.  It's a lot of fun and a good 30 minute workout.  Like the other DVDs in the series, it's mostly low impact moves, with modifiers whenever a more high impact move is included.  Jessica Smith is a good instructor who explains all the moves she includes.  There are 2 separate 30 minute workouts, both focused on easy to follow dance moves.  One is a latin walk, with salsa inspired moves.  The second is a walk including a variety of different dance moves.  The music is lively and each workout gets your heart rate up.  I'm a big fan of exercise programs that don't have complicated choreography and lots of jumping.  This one is just right--fun, but gives you a great workout!",1399334400,4,747,4.556390977443609
6289535,2,B00IRH8J92,"I bought this as a break from Leslie Sansone (who I like, but tired of the same ol' thing). But it's not much fun - I've done it twice and I'm already bored with the routine. Stick with Leslie or Kathy Smith.",1398988800,4,208,3.9761904761904763
6289536,5,B00IRH8J92,"In this 2nd installment of Jessica Smith's ""Walk On with Jessica Smith"" series, featured are TWO fun, energetic Walking routines, each 30 minutes each and including their own warm up and cool down.

This DVD was shot outdoors in BEAUTIFUL Sarasota Florida.  The gorgeous background is complete with gorgeous skyline, boats passing by, and playful sea birds to add to the flavor of the DVD.  At the request of Jessica's fans. this DVD was done in one take, and live, so it does feature the occasional ""oopsie"" moment, which is completely overshadowed by Jessica's friendly, ""can-do"" mentality and bubbling personality.  (her occasional quips during the routines had me laughing out loud).  Jessica's workout top, as well as Debbie's are BRIGHT PINK, and enhance the upbeat mood of the routines.  The workouts are simply, easy to do routines, without ANY difficult choreography.  The majority of the routines are low impact, but Jessica features her lovely Mother, Debbie, as modifier for any higher impact moves, making these routines excellent for any level.

The first workout on the DVD is Latin Dance.  This ""Zumba-esqe"" routine includes your basic salsas/samba/merengue steps, set to upbeat Latin rhythms, and is PERFECT for the backdrop of the workout.  Nothing confusing or high impact.

The second workout on the DVD is Dance Walk, a fun combination of various dance styles and rhythmic techniques and sounds spanning from the 1960's to today.  Included are disco moves (pointed fingers), jazz hands, and a short barre segment that gets the buns and thighs burning!

All in all, this is an excellent DVD, in my opinion for all levels.  I am an advanced exerciser (Insanity/P90x etc), but do enjoy these routines frequently, and as a supplement to my existing programs.  I can easily burn 200+ calories in a short amount of time doing these routines, and have fun doing it!  For those interested,  Jessica features a FOUR WEEK workout plan using all three of her Walk On with Jessica Smith DVDs (Strength and Balance, this DVD, and Tone Your Trouble Zones) and it can be found at Jessicasmithtv.com

I have been very pleased with my purchase of this series of DVDs and look forward to using them regularly.",1398643200,13,2212,4.997267759562842
8644745,1,B00IRH8J92,To much hopping for me. Love to exercise but too much hopping.,1430697600,,62,4.25
8644746,5,B00IRH8J92,I absolutely love it!  I'm 63 and getting in shape and I hope she makes more of them,1423440000,,84,3.6666666666666665
8644747,5,B00IRH8J92,"I am so happy to have discovered Jessica. I first started doing her YouTube workouts as my second workout of the day. I am an advanced exerciser who usually does intense weight training or cardio. I am now officially a ""walking"" convert.

This DVD has two dance workouts, a Latin walk and a dance walk. It's Jessica and her Mom, Debbie with a pretty backdrop of a Florida harbor. Jessica and Debbie are wearing pretty hot pink tops and black tights. Debbie is doing an easier version of the moves.

Why I love this workout:

* Jessica. What can I say? She is just so sweet and encouraging and funny. It's as though she is your best friend and you are working out together in your living room. I especially enjoyed Jessica's comments about the ""roach"" stamp step.

* The pretty scenery. It's fun to watch the boats going by in the background. It's fun to see palm trees and water. I live in New England and it is fun to pretend that I'm somewhere warm and sunny.

* The fun moves. Jessica is always coming up with fun, new moves and these workouts don't disappoint.

These workouts grew on me. The first few times I did them, I thought they were very easy and I didn't like them very much. Well, I have changed my mind. I use these workouts on recovery days or on those days when I just don't have much energy. Both are pretty much steady state cardio.

LATIN WALK
The music, no surprise, is some fast Latin beats, it can't help but make you start tapping your toes and smiling.
Some of the fun steps: shimmy plie heel tap; cha cha; can can kick; squat reach jump; spicy march; choo choo arms 123.

DANCE WALK
This workout has a little bit of everything; 60's, disco, hip hop and even ballet. What fun.
Some of the fun steps: double punch up at an angle; step clap tap; cross over squat; disco hands; jog and wave hands in the air.

Even if you have absolutely no rhythm, you can do these workouts. Jessica breaks down the moves.

These workouts don't feel like exercise, it's just moving and grooving and having fun.",1422576000,,2016,4.366310160427807
8644748,5,B00IRH8J92,Jessica knows what she's doing.  I enjoy her dvd's.  Beautiful Miami set.  Mom does the low impact version.  Time flies.,1420675200,,120,4.85
8644749,5,B00IRH8J92,"This is a great DVD. Gets you moving, nothing fancy, but for 30 minutes you are dancing and feeling great. Jessica Smith is a fantastic trainer. I have many of her other DVDs. This is work but fun while you are doing it. Highly recommend",1418428800,,237,4.288888888888889
8644750,4,B00IRH8J92,"This workout is easy to follow and gets your heartrate going.  Personally, I would enjoy different music - a little too techno - but the background scenery is calming.",1416873600,,167,4.758620689655173
8644751,5,B00IRH8J92,"This is a fun, easy workout.  I use this often on days I work or days I need a little extra exercise in.  As usual in her workouts, Jessica Smith combines moves to work several body parts at once and makes everything easy to follow.  I love her easy-going style and wit.  In this particular video, her Mom joins her to demonstrate some lower impact moves.  The scenery is beautiful in the video.  I think this is a video that a person of any fitness level can do.  There is nothing exceptionally challenging, but I think a person that is in really good shape would benefit from it also.",1413331200,,586,4.321100917431193
8644752,5,B00IRH8J92,It was fun and a great workout.  Glad the mom is showing alternative ways to do some of the exercises,1413331200,,101,4.05
8644753,5,B00IRH8J92,"I love Jessica!  Her movements are not hard and pounding, and she has her mother exercising with her like on many of her videos and she helps give alternate moves.  There are two 30 minute walking videos on this DVD, and I loved them both.",1411862400,,239,4.288888888888889
