5374308,5,B009ZNUKYY,"Ernst is a bit conservative. Toby is flamboyant. But it's love at first sight and the two men can't get enough of each other. Ernst believes they are soul mates. But then Ernst's old friend Uta comes to town. If she can't have her gay friend to herself, she's determined that no one else will.

Soon she's plotting to destroy their relationship. But then, Toby, fully aware of the threat to his happiness, has friends of his own. And they know how to get even.

This delightful romp bubbles over with joie de vivre. Frank Christian Marx as Ernst also wrote, produced, and stars. If this is a vanity production, then please give me more of the same! And what delicious eye candy Herr Marx is! He gets wonderful support from Udo Lutz as the campy Tobias, and Alexandra Starnitzky as the beautiful but diabolical Uta.",1372723200,3,814,4.568493150684931
5374309,5,B009ZNUKYY,"German comedy MEN TO KISS ('Mnner zum Knutschen' in the film's native language) is the best of all worlds when it comes to comedy, farce, and even a touch of romance. Tobias (Udo Lutz) is a flamboyantly gay performance artist who earns the attraction of the more strait-laced, seriously handsome Ernst (Frank Christian Marx), a banker recently relocated to Berlin from his job. Together only a short time, Tobias and Ernst seem to be growing closer as a couple ... until Ernst's childhood friend Uta (Alexandra Starnitzky) comes to town. All Ernst wants is for his best gal pal and his boyfriend to love each other as much as he loves each of them, but from the beginning Uta seems determined to antagonize Tobias (who, in turn, quickly grows to dislike her) ... and when she gets Tobias alone, proves herself to be an insane bitch who threatens Tobias with bodily harm if he won't break up with Ernst for good. Sure that Ernst won't believe his best childhood friend is a psychopath (and Uta IS, as viewers soon find out), Tobias instead enlists the aid of his best friends to get Uta off his back - and out of Ernst's life for good.

If you liked 'La Cage Aux Folles' - or maybe even its American counterpart, 'The Birdcage' - then you'll like this too. The comedy sometimes is way over the top, situations a bit outrageous, but that's both part of the fun AND it also works very well in the context of the film. Even better, this is a film even straight people can enjoy/find funny; it doesn't focus on the erotica/sexuality (with the exception of one love scene) or nudity many gay films fall back on - in fact, the two leads both being male is almost incidental; their relationship is handled just like any other would be, gay or straight ... and that, in fact, is one of the things I loved about this film best, because that's how the world should be.

And what, at its heart, makes this film so charming.",1371081600,4,1911,4.488505747126437
5374310,5,B009ZNUKYY,"I just saw the film at the filmfestival in washington. Oh my god, I have to say it's really amazing.

Fresh and funny, this hilarious and touching german film is a fast-paced comedy about how opposites attract.

Serious-minded Earnest has arrived in Berlin to begin his new job at a prestigious bank and a new life in the big city. That new life includes meeting and falling in love with flighty, unpredictable performance artist Tobias. Everything goes well until Earnest's friend Uta arrives, turning an innocent visit into an insidious attack on their relationship.

The story is unpredictable, the acting is excellent (the three leads Frank Christian Marx, Udo Lutz and Alexandra Starnitzky have a perfect chemistry) and the music is classical ""hollywood"" style. In washington it was a real crowd pleaser.

As I heared the company TLA Releasing is bringing the film to america in 2013.

Watch out for this really lough-out-loud comedy with sexy leads and feel good vibe which everyone will enjoy.",1353283200,15,1000,5.036363636363636
5374311,1,B009ZNUKYY,"I've been really eager to see Men to Kiss, hoping it might finally be a German comedy I could enjoy. Nope. I'm starting to think - after at least two dozen tries - that I just never will get German humor.

To me it always seems heavy-handed, loud, grossly exaggerated, totally lacking in subtlety, intelligence, gentleness, depth and warmth. It's like The Three Stooges.

So if you love The Three Stooges and can't imagine anything funnier than The Three Stooges as German gays in love, then this is the movie for you; it's not for me.

Unfortunately, it's awful in every other way too. Every character is like a cartoon character, a shallow overblown caricature of a human being, with nothing inside its hard and garish shell. The direction is cartoonish too, with an extreme close-up of someone's mugging face in nearly every shot.

There is NO credibility or chemistry in the relationship between Ernst and Tobias, which is the core of the movie. They're not even credible human beings. If I can't believe that those two love each other, or even that they're real, how can I care what happens to them? I don't.

Early in the movie I started thinking the actors and even their characters seemed very familiar, and I finally realized that many of them (actors AND their characters, and even some of the sets) were in an earlier movie called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alex-Leo/dp/B004MUHOSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alex & Leo</a>, which I also hated for exactly the same reasons.

Someone named Andre Schneider wrote (and produced, and acted in) both movies, so I'm going to add his name to my surprisingly short list of people whose work I will avoid like the plague from now on.

But if you saw and loved Alex and Leo, you doubtless will love this, its apparent sequel, too. Or, as I said, if the idea of the Three Stooges as gay Germans in love sends you rolling in the floor, you must not let this gem pass you by.",1397347200,,1970,4.862686567164179
5374312,5,B009ZNUKYY,I love this movie and have already watched it three times. Its sweet movie about trust and forgiveness with some truly crazy and funny stuff in between. Highly recommend this film.,1388361600,,180,4.838709677419355
5374313,3,B009ZNUKYY,"Not a first-class gay film, but I liked it.  I'll watch it again sometimes.  The actors are good, and Frank Christiian Mark, who plays Earnest, is very hot and a good actor.  Some of the supporting characters are pretty strange.  But there is a good chemistry between Earnest and Tobi and Uta (a nod to Uta Hagen?) is a funny character - the nutcracker scene is cool!  I will admit, I somehow missed that this was a foreign film before I bought it.  I'm cool with subtitles, but the ones on this DVD were very hard to read and I had to watch every one of them because I don't know German.  Anyhow, I enjoyed it and would recommend it.  3 1/2 stars.",1388188800,,648,4.211382113821138
5374314,1,B009ZNUKYY,"What were they thinking??? This is not a comedy...but a trial to even watch it! It is not in the least bit funny, but such a downer, that I couldn't recommend it to even my worst enemy. It is BLAAHH!!!",1387929600,2,201,4.05
5374315,5,B009ZNUKYY,"Alright, here is a romantic comedy in a German setting(Yes, I said German and not European).  It has very romantic interludes, spiced with delicious comedy.  All I can say is, the theme of this film  ls 'Loves' trials and tribulations.' Take the one you cherish with you when viewing this flix.  LOVE IS NEVER AN EASY STRUGGLE!  NJMJr!
PS  You must visit Berlin and a gay person or persons it is an absolute must!!!  NJMJr!!!",1384214400,,425,4.586666666666667
5374316,5,B009ZNUKYY,"Funny, romatic, and sexy! absolutely the best movie I saw in the theatre in 2012 and now I have my own copy.",1382313600,,108,3.9545454545454546
5374317,5,B009ZNUKYY,"The refreshing cast of sharply honed characters in Germany's gay romantic comedy ""Men To Kiss"" has pushed this subtitled film beyond its low-budget roots, with a universal tale of love, friendship and loyalty -- and knowing when it's time to fight dirty.

Archetypes abound in this battle-of-the-hearts narrative set in Berlin, with lead characters, straitlaced banker Ernst (Frank Christian Marx, sexy and very talented, who also co-produced and co-wrote the screenplay) and his fun-loving opposite, philosophy student boyfriend Tobias (Udo Lutz, damn funny) creating a genuinely realistic chemistry on screen.

Not the stereotypical lusty kind, mind you; even the film's single sex scene is a gentler, more believable depiction of (slightly) normal 30-somethings getting it together in a big city like Berlin.

Throw in Ernst's long-lost school friend, the wicked Uta (a sadistic Alexandra Starnitzky) with her devilishly severe costuming, lack of scruples and her ability to communicate soo much with just a parting of her thighs, and it's a hysterical game-on for Tobias, his mother (Marcus Lachmann) and a crew of devoted friends.

One of the film's funniest laugh-out-loud scenes takes place with Berlin artist Ades Zabel and her film partner, who play bumbling shopkeepers, totally unaware of the frustration they're causing Ernst. Think Little Britain at its best -- a delicious contrast of the absurd and the mundane.

Wordplay and verbal stoushes are a hallmark of the film's humour which appears to translate well into English.

And audiences will no doubt pick up on the updated subtitled reference to a certain famous tennis player.

Heading squarely into fairytale territory, the film's soundtrack by Daniel Behrens is used to great effect, sprinkling sugar plum fairy-esque orchestral notes alongside hardcore dance music, as the film takes you from the historic streets of Berlin to the pumping nightclubs for which it is famous.

This really has the potential to become a cult movie.",1376438400,3,2000,5.387820512820513
5374318,1,B009ZNUKYY,"I got this sub-titled DVD and started watching it. When I fast forward through the movie looking for any shred of relevance or interest and I'm glad when it ends, then I know I've found a movie that is definitely not going to ever be watched again. This is one of those movies, as far as I am concerned.  There are far better choices than this, I recommend you keep looking.",1374796800,3,374,4.267605633802817
5374319,4,B009ZNUKYY,"Released as ""Mnner zum Knutschen"", this is a gay comedy from Germany. It tells the story of Ernst played by the rather good Frank Christian Marx. He has met the man of his dreams in Tobi (Udo Lutz), they are living a happy if turbulent life but all of the new friends that Ernst has made are all friends of Tobi's and then Ernst hears from his bestest childhood friend Uta who is coming to visit and he is thrilled.

She is glamorous, self confident, speaks a lot of English and is a total biatch. She just wants to split the happy couple up and get Tobi out of the way, one way or the other. What develops are some truly funny if farcical situations where everyone can see what is going on except the poor Ernst.

This is not a rip roarin' comedy, but it made me laugh on a number of occasions and the out takes in the end credits are really good. The acting is all good especially so from a young and mostly inexperienced cast, who I hope we see more of especially Frank Christian Marx and the gloriously evil Alexandra Starnitzky who played Uta.

It is only 83 minutes long but still long enough to be satisfying - no pun intended. In German with a smattering of English and some very good sub titles. Director Robert Hasfogel has made an accomplished and entertaining film and this is his first credited on IMDb so I think we should be hearing more from him too. This is yet another German film that proves they do have a sense of humour and if you need more evidence check out `Fashion Victims' or the wonderful `Summer Storm'.",1374796800,2,1532,4.3125
5374320,5,B009ZNUKYY,"I waited with vast anticipation for this movie to come out on DVD ever since I saw and watched the trailers etc as I am a huge fan of foreign film... I was NOT disappointed in the slightest. This film is a maze of fun with some touching moments, it is a colourful journey through the lives of Earnest and Tobi which undulate and romp with a very fresh funny direction.

If you want an alternative jolly which seeps comedy and is an easy on the eye viewing then this is the film for you. I truly recommend it! Fabulous!",1374019200,5,518,4.18

Somehow the same passion that was believable in the first film doesn't quite carry over in this one.  Toby wasn't my favorite character the first time around and he still isn't.  'Alex and Leo'  just has more heart and soul.  Besides I miss Philippe.",1411344000,,377,4.651515151515151

8545746,3,B009ZNUKYY,Romantic comedy. A serious banker type falls in love with a less than serious performance artist. Best friend tries to break it up. Nothing new here in the plot.
