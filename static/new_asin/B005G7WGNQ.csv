8522683,5,B005G7WGNQ,I'm just going to rate it 5 stars because I know the director (Dan Glasser) and Steven Maloney,1445558400,,94,4.277777777777778
8522684,4,B005G7WGNQ,"Alex(Steven Molony) and Murphy (Timothy J. Meyer) play an unlikely Brit and a Scot in Fargo, ND (seriously?) who decide to go on a crime spree to support their consumerism. Not being too successful, they team up with Teddi (Ginny ""cleavage"" Glaser) who knows the Fargo underground crime scene. They end up kidnapping a girl named ""Penny"" (Lauren J. Wertz) thus giving us our duo meaning title.

While waiting for the ransom, Alex needs money so he can buy stuff. At this point Teddi introduces our guys to the Fargo counter culture drug dealer who also sell clean urine to users and dabble in some freelance kidney removal, the stuff of urban legends.

If you don't like bizarre, British, or grindhouse style, this movie is not for you. At one point the film was moving so fast, I lost track of what was going on and was questioning what happened to characters I haven't seen in while. It is a fun fast moving quirky grindhouse and definitely not the Coen's Fargo.

8522685,4,B005G7WGNQ,"Usually when you hear that a bunch of young college kids are making a feature length film, you cringe. At least I do. But, like always, there are exceptions. Pinching Penny is one of those exceptions. This midwestern indie film is something to watch. Not only did these young cinema enthusiasts pull off getting their own feature from script to screen, but they did it really well. The writing, directing, acting and cinematography are done so well that it easily can be misconstrued that those involved have been doing this for the duration of their careers. I just can't for wait more from all involved. Good movie. Great time. Well worth your fifteen dollars.",1314316800,4,662,4.815789473684211
8522686,4,B005G7WGNQ,"Pinching Penny's production team is miles ahead of others trying to break into the film business. Instead of just sitting around thinking of how great it would be to make a cool movie, these guys (directors, writers, actors) went full throttle into their ideas from paper to the editing room, and created something very promising. From what I've read and seen, the production was not easy by any means. The crew had a plenty of ups and downs, but the came running to the finish line with something they're all ready to share with the world. Director Dan Glaser was able to create a full feature length film before he's even half way through his twenties, doing something like this is not even close to easy.
The story may seem a little familiar to some, but there are personal qualities that Glaser has added that are visible, audible, and memorable throughout the movie.
The film is remarkable, and for me, the comedy elements were the strongest elements of the film. The ""attempt at and escape from the botched robbery"" scene at the beginning was easily the strongest part of the film. Really showcased the actor's dedication to their characters, the director's talent of pace, and foreshadows the story's ""one botched situation leads to an even more difficult situation"" for the characters.
The film is sharp, funny, and prognosticates promising futures for all involved in the film.",1313539200,6,1386,4.877118644067797
8522687,5,B005G7WGNQ,"I was at an advanced screening for this movie in Fargo, and became an instant fan. It's gritty and raw...everything I want from an independent flick. I really look forward to seeing Dan Glaser's career develop - if Pinching Penny is any indication, he'll slip in to my list of favorite directors easily. The three main actors (Steven Molony, Timothy J. Meyer, and Ginny Glaser) show a lot of promise as well and I look forward to following them for years to come.

Pinching Penny was one of my favorite movie experiences in 2010, I look forward to adding it to my collection (and seeing the finished product!).",1313539200,4,610,4.648148148148148
8522688,1,B005G7WGNQ,"The acting in this movie seems wooden and amateurish even for an indie movie. I was immediately put off by its essential inability to generate new story ideas. Indie movies are about making something new and pushing the limits, not re-packaging every heist movie in the last ten years. I'm a fan of movies like ""Primer"" that combine brilliant writing with a unique plot. All in all, it was an underwhelming waste of my time.",1313280000,8,424,4.666666666666667
8522689,1,B005G7WGNQ,"Have you seen Snatch? How about Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels? Then you've seen this movie, except with competent writing, directing, and acting. Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage.",1313193600,9,201,5.121212121212121
8522690,5,B005G7WGNQ,"If you are looking for a gritty indie film, this is the movie for you! I am impressed with any movie that can make me like a main character that I know I should hate. Dan Glaser did so much with his first film and I cannot wait to see what he produces next! I am also stoked to see more of Steven Molony and Timothy Meyer!",1313107200,8,322,3.8208955223880596
