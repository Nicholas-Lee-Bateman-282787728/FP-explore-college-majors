7613934,5,B01AXGCWCY,"Though I've been a fan of film noir for a while, WOMAN ON THE RUN was one picture I hadn't heard of until I saw a screening at Noir City Hollywood in 2015.

I hadn't seen the film in well over a year when I popped this disc in for the first time, and I'll admit that the big reveal halfway through - which is smartly placed and subtle but obvious if you've been paying attention - took me by surprise, again! I love when a movie provides that kind of thrilling experience, even when it's one I've already seen before.

While I have some minor issues with this story, I find it a unique one in the world of noir, especially concerning the lead characters and their journey throughout the film. I'm usually not the biggest Ann Sheridan fan, though I do really enjoy her performance here (even if I am sometimes baffled by her). Her rather bizarre actions at the very beginning, right after her husband runs off after witnessing a murder, add that much more intrigue to the plot; we have no idea why she is being so mysterious or what she is hiding about her relationship with her husband (and why she is doing so), but it really makes you want to figure it out, and that stinging, sarcastic, hard edge of hers certainly reeled me in. My only real concern with this story and this character is that I've never been 100% satisfied with the way she reconciles her husband's actions and shifts her attitude towards him (and the various differing accounts of his character are never really explained either).

As with TOO LATE FOR TEARS, the care and detail taken with the physical presentation of this set is stunning, from the visuals included in the booklet to the poster used on the backside of the cover piece. The special features don't disappoint either, and there are a total of four included here (not including the audio commentary), two more than found on TOO LATE FOR TEARS. Both movies include a short doc on the restoration (which I'll talk about more below) and a behind the scenes peek of the production. I took issue with the title of this behind the scenes feature in the TOO LATE FOR TEARS set, and I do here as well; some great info and insights are provided in both pieces, but it's more of a general overview on cast and thoughts on the picture, not necessarily as behind the scenes look at the production itself, which I was thinking it would be. The content itself is great, just a small wording issue on the title. The other two special videos included focus on San Francisco's Noir City festival, where this film was first shown in 2003 (which is a great experience for noir fans), and a look at the San Francisco locations used in the film, then and now. For the latter, it was quite fun to see how much some locations changed...and how similar some others appeared!

I recall Eddie Muller telling the story of WOMAN ON THE RUN's rescue and restoration at Noir City, which is an epic roller coaster ride in and of itself (teaser: it involves a fire and an illegal copying of the movie that was eventually used to help in the restoration). I'm glad Muller shared that tale again in his piece in the DVD booklet and also in the restoration featurette, because you have to hear and/or read it to believe it! Muller also supplied the audio commentary, which was right up his alley as he played a huge role in rediscovering this film, and he's a San Francisco native himself.

Along with TOO LATE FOR TEARS, WOMAN ON THE RUN had unfairly flown under the radar, unnoticed and unseen for decades. I enjoy the film more with each viewing, and I'm happy UCLA, the Film Noir Foundation, and Flicker Alley worked together to bring this restoration to DVD/Blu-Ray. This is a must-see for noir fans!

(Note: While I would normally rate the movie a 4, I have to add 1 more star for the terrific set, the fabulous restoration and recovery, and the extras.)",1466121600,4,3861,4.485064011379801
7613935,3,B01AXGCWCY,"All 5-star reviews? For the restoration, I agree; for the film, not so much. Aside from night scenes on a rollercoaster, in what sense is this film noir? The final shot, husband and wife reunited with a kiss, gives us a heartening happy ending. The crusty but benign copper saves the day, the dissembling villain floats face down off the pier, and marriage, temporarily derailed by cynical misunderstandings, is restored and reaffirmed. My impression of these laudatory reviews is that story and character matter less to noir than cinematography and mood -- any b/w hard-boiled melodrama shot at night can qualify. Certainly noir has a look, shadowy settings, screenplays involving crime, but its essence is alienation, absurdity, fatalism. The unheroic protagonist, tangled in senseless circumstances, or undone by a femme fatale, ends up lost, numb. Good does not triumph with swelling music and a kiss. Doom prevails. In WOMAN ON THE RUN, there is no protagonist. The husband-on-the-run comes closest, but we're never really in his shoes, it's never his movie. I like Ann Sheridan's arc of love gone sour rediscovered and redeemed, but at both extremes, cynical or tender, her character projects resilience, forward momentum, her own crackling sort of clarity. She's fine in the film -- it is, after all, Ann Sheridan --but her character seems to me too sturdy and functional to make a noir anti-heroine.",1465862400,4,1407,5.148471615720524
7613936,5,B01AXGCWCY,"If you're not a film noir fan, you've probably never heard of WOMAN ON THE RUN. The story of how the film survived (told in the disc's supplements) alone is worth the price of this superb edition from Flicker Alley. Even if you have little to no interest in noir, this film works on multiple levels: it's a mystery, a thriller, a ""woman's picture"" as they used to call them, and a showcase of great acting, directing, pacing and atmosphere, taking full advantage of the wonderful San Francisco locations. The film also includes a commentary by Eddie Muller. Listening to Muller is like sitting at the feet of a master; they don't call him ""The Czar of Noir"" for nothing. The restoration work here, made possible by the Film Noir Foundation, is spectacular. I hope you'll explore the wonders of WOMAN ON THE RUN and another great Flicker Alley release, TOO LATE FOR TEARS.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Too-Late-for-Tears-Newly-Restored-Blu-ray-DVD/dp/B01AXGCW9W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Too Late for Tears (Newly Restored) [Blu-ray/DVD</a>]",1464998400,,1087,5.674846625766871
7613937,5,B01AXGCWCY,"I had not seen this film until released by Flicker Alley.  It is a very enjoyable Noir.  Not only is the story good, but there is a good deal of mid-20th century cinematography of San Francisco, giving the film a gritty feel to it.  The restoration work is outstanding, and given one of the extras  describing the restoration (more like rescue), it is amazing that the film not only survives but is available.  Definitely recommended.",1464307200,7,434,4.733333333333333
7613938,5,B01AXGCWCY,"I only ever managed to get through this film once before because the picture and sound were so bad I had difficulty getting lost in the story. At the time, I thought it was an interesting noir, but I didn't feel the need to struggle through the poor quality public domain copy again. In its restored version, I can finally appreciate the mid-century San Francisco location shooting and the nuances of Sheridan's performance that were previously lost because the technical issues were so distracting. This is one of Ann Sheridan's best roles, because she gets to discard some of that big studio glamour and fully display the grit and sharp wit that made her an intriguing star in the first place. I feel like it'll take a few viewings to truly absorb all this film has to offer.",1464134400,2,777,4.63768115942029
7613939,5,B01AXGCWCY,"Very good little film noir with an interesting plot twist in the middle of the movie. There may be some questions about this plot twist, but this is the movies, right? Ann Sheridan does a good job of disposing of her usual glamorous persona and acting like a bored, cynical housewife. The ending includes a suspenseful roller coaster ride with some noir tropes.",1464134400,2,361,4.746031746031746
7613940,5,B01AXGCWCY,"Woman on the Run is a Great film. Great acting, snappy dialog, suspense galore, twists and turns, great San Francisco location shots. I don't know what the previous reviewer thought was lacking.
Saw a bad print years ago and was delighted to see this had been restored. The writing of Alan campbell making sharp barbns about marriage stands out, as does the deglamorized performance of Amm Sheridan. The photography is very much in the trandtion. The director does set up some great shots and the rollercoaster sequence is worth the look alone.
Thank god someone slavaged this. It is great Noir and great entertainment.",1463443200,7,619,4.961538461538462
7613941,5,B01AXGCWCY,"Flicker Alley describes WOMAN ON THE RUN as "" a lost gem"" and. as usual, they are telling the truth. I had never heard of this film although I was familiar with Ann Sheridan but I learned about her in reverse. I first saw her on TV in an old CBS comedy called PISTOLS & PETTICOATS. This was back in 1966. My mother knew her from her Warner Brothers days during WW II and told me all about her. Later I watched some of her 1940s movies like KING'S ROW, THEY DRIVE BY NIGHT, and THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER. By the end of the 1940s her career was in decline but she could still rise to the occasion when given a good part like the one in I WAS A MALE WAR BRIDE (1949) with Cary Grant or this film which she secretly co-produced.

There was a lot of top drawer talent involved with this film. in addition to Sheridan, the writer was Alan Campbell (Dorothy Parker's husband), the director was Norman Foster who had worked with Orson Welles, and the cinematographer was Hal Mohr who had won a write-in Oscar (the only time that has ever happened) for A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM in 1935. The camerawork is perhaps the biggest star as much of the film is shot on location in San Francisco. But this is the San Francisco of 1950 before it really became a tourist destination and Mohr makes it look as dark and as dangerous as New York or L.A..

The story is routine as Sheridan's husband witnesses a murder and then goes underground while the police try to locate him. To their surprise Sheridan could care less about his whereabouts as the couple have become estranged. Enter Dennis O'Keefe as a tabloid reporter who senses a story if he can find her husband before the police do. Enlisting Sheridan's aid by offering money, they set out and along the way she finds out things about her husband and herself. To say anymore would be giving too much away but there is an exciting (if somewhat abrupt) conclusion involving a roller coaster. What makes WOMAN ON THE RUN ""a lost gem"" is not the story but the performances and the crackling dialogue along with the aforementioned photography.

Flicker Alley has worked in conjunction with the UCLA Film & Television Archive and the Film Noir Foundation to restore this and another forgotten film, TOO LATE FOR TEARS with Lizabeth Scott and Dan Duryea, Both are now available in DVD/Blu-Ray combo packs which come with lots of special features on the backgrounds and making of the films and a comprehensive booklet. One of my favorite features is ""locations then and now"". WOMAN ON THE RUN is not a great film and has no pretensions about being one but it is solidly made and is very entertaining and sometimes that's all a movie needs to be.",1462579200,19,2676,4.468302658486707
8748813,5,B01AXGCWCY,"Wow! The restored copy is great!! I have only watched the dvd copy , I am sure the Blu-ray will be even better!! I have several PD copies that are awful! Its like this is the first time I am s I omg this movie! Great job!",1526947200,,221,3.723404255319149

8748816,4,B01AXGCWCY,"It was nice to see San Francisco before the collapse. Not a ""full"" restoration.

The word ""Restoration"" is thrown around a lot in the movie business.  For example, if you purchase the UCLA Sherlock Holmes restoration you'll see a frame-by-frame restoration with every defect removed from each, and every frame. That was not done for ""Women on the Run"".  Don't get me wrong, the picture and sound are good, but not excellent. Definitely watchable.

I will confirm with others here have written. This is an excellent movie and well acted by Ann Sheridan.  Ann's best movie is ""Navy Blues"" made in 1941.  (Can be hard to find, you may need to record a DVD of it from Turner Classic Movies.)

The Blu-ray transfer I would rate 3.5 stars, the movie itself 5 stars.",1480982400,3,759,4.661654135338346
8748817,5,B01AXGCWCY,"In the early 2000's, we purchased this movie on SD from a company called: Alpha Video aka Oldies.com (that is still here)
The quality of the transfer was very poor BUT, at least we got to see it. We could tell right away it was an incredible little gem. When Blu ray came along, we kept hoping that some entity would take it out of Public Domain and restore it.

This version, restored by the UCLA Film & Television archive ALMOST does this great movie justice. But, it does NOT go all the way in the Restoration process (as it seems that other ""restorations"" by UCLA also slightly miss the mark). By this I mean that, for one thing, obnoxious reel-change markers still show up in gigantic distraction in the top right frame. Also, you know how Criterion, Masters of Cinema, Arrow Video used to always state ""Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed...""? Well, on this Blu ray the ""thousands of instances"" are still there... maybe not glaringly, but they have NOT been removed.

Now, to put this in perspective, this is a MONSTEROUSLY magnificent improvement audibly and visually from the prior versions in Public Domain. I just find it a tad disappointing that this Blu ray did not go all the way. I do not, in any sense, mean to say this Blu ray is not worth purchasing because there is NO QUESTION AT ALL that this transfer is, most likely, THE best we'll ever see and... bottom line, it is WONDERFUL to see this ""restored"".

Ann Sheridan, master of the snappy come backs, is as incredible here as she is in ""They Drive by Night"" when George Raft and Bogart are ogling Ann Sheridan's bod and Raft agrees ""It's a classy chassis!"" and Sheridan replies ""You couldn't even afford the headlights!""",1478649600,4,1762,4.641025641025641
8748818,5,B01AXGCWCY,"Nearly lost to history and a vault fire, this excellent film noir is a great gift to film fans from UCLA and Flicker Alley. WOMAN ON THE RUN is an atypical noir, in that the woman is the hero. Ross Elliott is out walking his dog at night when he witnesses a murder. When the police arrive and tell him that this was a mob hit, Elliott's character quickly escapes from police custody. The police find his wife, played by Ann Sheridan as wise-cracking, cynical woman who has drifted apart from her husband. She will have none of their protection either. She alerts her husband to the dragnet, and has to give the police the slip herself. With the help of a newspaper reporter, Dennis O'Keefe, she is one step ahead of the police and the killer as they all hunt her husband. She quickly learns that there are plenty of people who know her husband better than she ever has, and begins to wonder if she shouldn't give their marriage a second try. Directed by Norman Foster, who worked with Orson Welles on JOURNEY INTO FEAR (1943) and other projects, this is a minor masterpiece of suspense. Although adapted by Alan Campbell, several of the crew were also writers (like Robert Keith, Dennis O'Keefe and the director) and they apparently rewrote much of the dialog on the set. The film reveals the killer half-way through, greatly increasing the suspense. This film has effective photography by Hal Mohr, and striking low-angle and Dutch tilt shots to convey the atmosphere of 1950s San Francisco. This is the kind of role that Ann Sheridan longed for, and she is excellent as she changes from a cynical almost-ex-wife to a woman fighting for her husband. There is literally a roller-coaster of an ending at an amusement park. If you are a fan of Film Noir, don't miss this film!

Picture quality is very good, but not excellent. This was transferred off of the mute dupe negative at the BFI, which was the last surviving 35mm copy of the film. There is plenty of grain, so it still looks like a film. It is much, much better than other PD disks of the title on the market. Hal Mohr's excellent photography still shines throughout this film. The sound isn't great either, as it is from a digital copy of the now-destroyed American print. The commentary track by author and Noir City Film Festival organizer Eddie Muller is excellent. He fills us in on the many character actors who appear in the film. Muller spends a lot of time describing the fascinating history of this independently produced film, and the winding story of the film's loss and rediscovery. There are a hand-full of short special features including a documentary on the making of the film and another on the restoration of the film. A then-and-now feature shows us filming locations in Los Angeles, Santa Monica and San Francisco. There's also an extended promo for the Noir City Film Festival in San Francisco. Finally, the disk includes a nice booklet that also covers the loss and rediscovery of the film, and it is illustrated with many beautiful stills. The BluRay and DVD disks have English closed captions available.",1472342400,5,3087,4.695571955719557
8748819,5,B01AXGCWCY,"Oh, those film noir classics! The quintessential American film genre, tales of menace and dark alleys, nail-biting suspense and wicked detours. Usually shot in magnificent black and white, where the shadows are dagger sharp or creeping like evil wraiths. Men in fedoras and belted trench coats. Women, always beautiful, running in high heels, clutching their handbag, so a lipstick touchup was ever handy. Everybody smokes, as if the endless white puffs were smoke signals trying to ward off danger.

Woman on the Run, made in 1950, bears all the film noir qualities. Yet it is surprisingly relevant for todays audiences. An ordinary woman, not a male loner detective, is the main character. The dialogue is snappy, often subversively funny. Most importantly, the film, in addition to its required thriller veins, is also a poignant look at the difficulties of modern marriage.

Its post-WWII San Francisco. Frank Johnson (Ross Elliot), an unhappy artist, is walking his dog when he witnesses a mob assassination. When the police arrive, they are full of questions. Are you married? Frank is asked. In a way, he answers, summing up in one line how hes feeling about his marriage and bewildering the cops. When Frank learns that the gunman saw and shot at him, too, he realizes he is next on the kill list and disappears.

Inspector Ferris (Robert Keith) interrogates Eleanor Johnson (Ann Sheridan) at the couples apartment. Eleanor shocks the police, and the audience, too, with her blas attitude about her husbands disappearance. A tall, pushy reporter Dan Leggett (Dennis OKeefe) gains Eleanors confidence and together they search San Francisco for her husbandalong the wharves teeming with sailors from all over the world, in a Chinatown nightclub, in a department store where Frank made mannequins, some of whom look like Eleanor, and finally in a beach-side amusement park where the roller coaster becomes a hellish, twisting monster.

As they get closer to Franks hide-out, from the people they interview, Eleanor learns more about her husband than she ever knew before. Hes not the aloof loser, her anger had turned him into, but rather, a good man, revered by the people who know him, and one who is still madly in love with her. Will her changing opinion of him come in time to save him? Or, being a noir film, will he still have to face the gunmans bullet?

The making of The Woman on the Run movie is as fascinating a story as whats on the screen.
Ann Sheridan, wanting to escape from the Oomph Girl label that defined her for many years, took producer reins on the movie, a rare event in Hollywood at the time. Based on a short story named Man on the Run by Sylvia Tate, Sheridan changed the story to make the woman the main character. Director/co-writer Norman Foster was a veteran Hollywood filmmaker. Most noted for his later TV work (such as the Loretta Young show, 1953), at the time of Woman on the Run. Foster was a top-notch feature film director. Journey into Fear (1943) was a stylish thriller, starring Orson Welles. Another was a western, Rachel and the Stranger (1948), starring William Holden, Robert Mitchum and Loretta Young. Sharing the writing duties was Alan Campbell, a solid writer who was most known for his long relationship with the wise-cracking writer Dorothy Parker. Parts of their real-life tumultuous relationship no doubt slipped into the script for Woman on the Run.

Unlike many other movies shot in San Francisco, Woman on the Run disdains the fancy socialite view of The Golden City and instead presents the citys seamier, blue collar side: the neighborhood dives, the second-hand clothing stores, the ugly morgue. Occasionally, there are shots of the citys architectural wonders in a rare day of sunshine, but mostly shadows prevail. Woman on the Run was shot by legendary cinematographer Hal Mohr, whose work, over a 50-year period, was responsible for the memorable beauty of many Hollywood films.

Despite the quality of Woman on the Run, it died a quick death at the box office and eventually disappeared, almost entirely. Like a phoenix however, it was brought back to life by the Film Noir Foundation who deserves eternal film noir kudos.",1472342400,3,4191,4.953058321479374
8748820,5,B01AXGCWCY,"Ive never been a fan of Ann Sheridan. Indeed Ive always thought of her, rather unfairly it would seem, as a so-so actress, a poor mans Rita Hayworth, if you like. But here as the frazzled, worse-for-wear housewife she hits it out of he park. Ive certainly not seen all her movies but cant imagine shes ever been better. She captures lots of emotional nuances with always an undertone of humor. BTW she has an uncanny resemblance to Lucille Ball in this film. Her banter with wise-guy detective Robert Keith is maybe the highlight of Woman on the Run. I remember Keith mostly as an old codger from roles later in his career, Written on the Wind being an example. Here he does such a terrific job that he almost steals the movie from Ann, though not quite. And Dennis OKeefe as Sheridans (sort of) leading man, also does his usual strong work.

A great deal of the success of Woman on the Run must be credited to under-appreciated director Norman Foster; he deserves much credit for the wise, witty script, great pacing and terrific visuals, which bring us to an added bonus: the on-location backdrop of San Francisco, always a favorite environ of noir filmmakers. I think Woman on the Run does an even better job of lovingly presenting those Frisco locales than such noir classics as DOA and Lady from Shanghai.

My only criticisms might be that some scenes go on a tad too long and the ending is on the truncated side.  Still, Id rate Woman on the Run a pretty solid five stars.",1469577600,,1478,4.52808988764045
8748821,5,B01AXGCWCY,"To my knowledge this is the first Film Noir movie that Flicker Alley has released (actually they are releasing two at the same time). But it does fall in the purview of what they do best  make available rare  usually recently restored  films in deluxe packages with lots of great bonus materials.
This is really a collaborative effort between Flicker Alley and a San Francisco film group called the Film Noir Foundation which shows films at the Art Deco Castro Theater and uses the proceeds to fund film restoration. In the case of this film, The only known 35 mm print was destroyed in a fire and the British Film Institute had a 35mm print but without sound. A privately owned 16 mm SOUND print was located and the magicians of film restoration at UCLA were able to match that sound to the nearly pristine 35mm silent.  If youve read my other amazon DVD and BD reviews youll know I hate spoilers but I thought telling you about how the project came together would be helpful. Youll learn more about it in one of the special features.

Yes, this is a film noir thriller so I won't say much about that either. I read no reviews or even a plot outline before w3atching it and it was the best way to see it. As youll learn from the interviews in the bonuses (as well as full-length commentary by film historian Eddie Muller  one of the most informative commentaries Ive heard in a while), there are connections between the crew on this film and Orson Welles Mercury Theater company. Youll notice this from the start and will find the background interesting (after you see the film of course). The title is a bit confusing  and the reason for the change is never quite explained adequately (at least for me). This is the story of a MAN on the run (his wife the woman  Ann Sheridan  is trying to find him) and the story it is LOOSELY based on was titled Man on the Run. But thats not as important, really. The important thing is that the film  which, when last shown at the Castro, filled the huge theater  is now available for anyone to see and enjoy and will live on an on with the image and soundtrack permanently together.

The package contains both a BD and DVD version of the film with all the same bonus features. There is also a 24 page booklet with ephemeral images from the films ad campaign and a four page essay by the aforementioned Muller.

Now Im off to watch the other noir film from Flicker Alley.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8748822,5,B01AXGCWCY,"Thanks to Flicker Alley and the Film Noir foundation, perhaps this worthy film will have a chance for a little exposure. It was produced by an independent studio that soon went bankrupt; in the chaos and over the years all prints were lost track of and no good prints were thought to remain. the Film Noir Foundation was able to find one to restore and create this Blu Ray.

The film itself is remarkable. There is more than plenty for any Noir or old movie fan to savor, from Ann Sheridan's wonderfully pithy performance, to the amazing location shooting in San Francisco, to the terrific sharp dialogue, to the terrific climax with shades of Hitchcock and Welles...this is a feast for any cinefile.

Flicker Alley's presentation is terrific. Yeah, it's a bit pricey, but they are not going to sell all that many of these, the restoration work that was needed was extensive - AND it's for a good cause - if these sell well enough, there may be incentive to restore more of these old gems. The picture quality is a little scratchy here and there, but it's a wonderful restoration with great depth and clarity to the image, it looked GREAT shown through my projector on a large (110"") screen. The sound quality is more than adequate, dialogue and music are clear and having watched it yesterday, I can't really recall any hiss or other distracting issues. The extras included are fascinating, short documentaries regarding the hunt for a decent print (after a fire destroyed what was believed to be the only print in existence!!), efforts of restoration, and the making of the film itself. I haven't listened to the full length commentary from Eddie Muller of the Film Noir Foundation, but there is not a more passionate and knowledgeable Noir fan out there, so looking forward to that.

Buy this so that more obscure Noir can be restored!",1466467200,11,1838,4.719626168224299
