6135422,4,B00H7172WO,"I watched this primarily because Imran Khan is in it, and I like looking at him!  He plays a spoiled, self-absorbed, and selfish character, juxtaposed with an obsessed do-gooder and social activist played by Kareena Kapoor. The scenes are also easy on the eyes, varying from hip urbanity to remote villages. I liked the movie.",1409788800,,326,4.927272727272728

good songs, nice acting, strong message. Absolute one time watch and has return value because of its songs.

I loved it, not sure why this movie didn't work as in box office. But for sure it is a better movie compare to some of recent hits.",1393804800,,303,4.315789473684211
6135427,5,B00H7172WO,I usually enjoy most Hindi films and this was no exception. Kumar is just a very fine actor. You can always learn more about India from watching these films.,1392163200,,157,4.448275862068965
6135428,4,B00H7172WO,Good movie. I like to be entertained and this one filled the bill. Imran Khan was a good as he always is and Katrina Kapoor was much better than she has been in her previous movies.,1391990400,,181,4.055555555555555
6135429,3,B00H7172WO,"- Dia (faced with the daunting task of transporting a pregnant woman across a flimsy bridge): ""Hospital canceled. I will deliver Laali's child.""
- Incredulous village woman: ""You?""
- Dia: ""Who delivered Chanda?""
- Bemused village elder (under his breath): ""But Chanda was a goat.""

If you dial down expectations, then you'll survive GORI TERE PYAAR MEIN! Heck, you may even enjoy it. As in most Bollywood pictures, it's a tale of two halves. In this instance, the worth it moments are found post-intermission. Until then, it's a slog.

No big revelation in how the plot unfolds. GORI TERE PYAAR MEIN! adheres strictly to formula. Take the callow boy, take the virtuous girl. ""Send you to America to study and you return an alien..."" rants Mr. Venkat who's had it with his irresponsible son, Sriram (Imran Khan). And how do you fix it when your child is in dire need of an attitude adjustment? I guess, in Indian culture, you fix him up with an arranged marriage. So, now, here's Sriram in dialogue with his lovely intended bride, Vasudha (Shraddha Kapoor). You'd think he'd be the one railing against convention, but it's Vasudha who exhorts him to break off the nuptials. See, she loves someone else. In the course of conversation, Sriram shares memories of his past, the year and a half he spent with this crazy Punjabi girl, Dia Sharma (Kareena Kapoor Khan).

The film's first half is primarily an exercise in flashback storytelling as it details Sriram and Dia's contentious relationship. Dia was a Punjabi from Delhi. Sriram, a Tamilian from Bangalore. And maybe, culture-wise, that was too wide a gap to bridge. Or maybe the rift that eventually developed was more because Sriram was an incorrigible loafer while Dia was a compulsive social activist determined to better the world. Opposites do attract. They also repel. Their clash of ideologies was an inevitable thing.

Post-interval, the film sustains most of its rom-com sensibility, but it also takes a more melodramatic shift, as well as a shift in scenery. Post-interval, Sriram embarks on a quest to find his ex-girlfriend, Dia. He finally tracks her down to a remote village named Jhumli somewhere on the Gujarat border. And if, somewhere along here, you're struck with a sense of deja vu, maybe it's warranted. The film's second half trajectory comes off as if&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lagaan-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B003YR0GRI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lagaan, Anniversary Edition</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Swades/dp/B00078JZ74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Swades</a>&nbsp;had a child. In the dirt and poverty of Jhumli, Dia has embraced her missionary work. Her latest project is to replace the flimsy rope bridge that so isolates Jhumli's 270 woeful villagers from civilization. And, oh yeah, she's moved on from Sriram.

So what now for the perplexed Sriram, him what doesn't value things such as family, friends, relationships, life or country? Will Sriram storm off in a huff or stay to remedy that wedge driven between him and this crazy Punjabi girl? I wouldn't dare imply that erecting the bridge is some sort of metaphor...

If only the script weren't rife with banality. Despite that the narrative follows a non-linear path, it's still predictable. But predictability isn't what's wrong; the execution is. The plot is weighed down by the lack of a strong story conflict. It's disheartening that Sriram is drawn so unpleasantly, that by the time his moment of redemption came along, it was too late for me to give a what. Imran Khan is powered by his easy smile and relaxed composure and impressive eyebrows. This doesn't mean he can pull off roles requiring a certain gravity. I dunno, maybe he's destined to specialize in nothing but lightweight Bollywood rom-coms. But since I first saw him in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jaane-Tu-Ya-Jaane-Na-2-DVD-Set-Bollywood-Movie-Indian-Cinema-Hindi-Film/dp/B001IDMLPK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na (2 DVD Set) (Bollywood Movie / Indian Cinema / Hindi Film)</a>, I've expected bigger and better from Imran.

Kareena Kapoor Khan fares better as the spirited good girl activist, barking her slogans and tweaking the noses of those corrupt in their authority. Dia's latest target is the malicious regional collector (Anupam Kher) who obstructs Dia's plan to build a bridge. Anupam Kher, by the way, demonstrates yet again why he's in such demand as a supporting actor. As mentioned before, the worth it moments are in post-interval, and Anupam Kher's performance is a comic highlight. I like the village setting, like its old world charm and the endearing simplicity of the villagers. Such a refreshing departure from Sriram Venkat's self-absorption and urban sophistication (read: cynicism). And I was bobbing my head to two of the six musical tracks - ""Moto Ghotalo"" and the forehead thumping ""Dil Duffer,"" so there's that.

This movie can be played with an option for English sub-titles. The DVD's bonus stuff:

- 14 Deleted Scenes (no English sub-titles available)
- Making of the Movie featurette, chunks of it in English (00:22:49 minutes)",1391904000,,5239,5.514321295143213
6135430,5,B00H7172WO,"Though Gori Tere Pyaar Mein did not fare very well at the box office, I found the movie to be very entertaining with a strong social message. Sriram (Imran Khan) is Tam-Bram settled in Bangalore who falls for Dia (Kareena Kapoor), a Punjabi. But their differences are more than the North-South divide. Sriram is happy-go-lucky guy, while Dia is strongly involved in fighting for social issues and demanding justice. How these two bridge the gap and overcome differences forms the crux of this movie. Another reason to watch this movie is because it is very rare nowadays to come across a movie that you can watch with the entire family.",1389139200,6,636,4.790909090909091
