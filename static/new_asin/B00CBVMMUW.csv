5713262,5,B00CBVMMUW,So real it felt like a documentary. Sex scenes are taken to another level in this gay forward film! Any self respecting gay man should not miss this film.,1371513600,11,154,4.344827586206897
5713263,4,B00CBVMMUW,"I'm not going to even try to post the link because I'm sure it will get yanked, but, while Amazon would have you believe otherwise, this film (which apparently doesn't meet their ""standards,"" because we live in a country where it's totally fine to watch people get their heads blown off, but god forbid you see someone have sex) is readily available in in print.  Google the film title, go to their official page, and they have a link where you can either buy a stream or download of the uncut movie, or purchase the DVD through their distributor (a company which normally specializes in adult films, but provided some of the financial backing for the making of this movie).",1403222400,16,674,4.616666666666666

5713266,4,B00CBVMMUW,"I live in San Francisco. I know or have met real people like these characters and found the film realistic, true-to-life, and, at times, gritty, like some who live in this beautiful city metropolis.

The most amazing aspect about the film is that the sex is real. It's not a common deliberate, directorial decision.  Personally, I do not consider it pornography, but am aware that the characters in this film are unlike those who simluate sex in other films. It is a gay film about gay men and clearly, made for a gay male audience.

So, if you are sexually squeamish, pass on it. If not, buy it and encourage others to buy it for its truth and honestly...something seldom seen in American filmmaking.",1389052800,8,701,4.637096774193548
5713267,2,B00CBVMMUW,"Annoying characters, cliche situations.  Save yourself the time and just search the web for the short film that this was made from (the main char is in it and his partner is much cuter anyway).  It will leave you free to enjoy your life and not have to listening to the droning on of some vapid queers.",1386892800,2,302,4.280701754385965
5713268,1,B00CBVMMUW,"I was expecting to set back, relax in my sofa and enjoy a nice gay movie, like the cover promises. Wrong, totally. There is nothing to enjoy out of the ordinary. Why it is so difficult to make gay movies enjoyable, showing healthy people and real good lives? Don't buy it.",1378512000,3,272,4.352941176470588
5713269,2,B00CBVMMUW,While the characterising of cast seems genuine and appealing I didn't quite understand the directors motive behind the film.  It lacked any kind of depth apart from the main characters turmoil of his supposedly fruitless years in the city and a couple of other characters personal turmoils.  The main object of my wanting to view this film was the curiosity of wondering why the Australian film censors had banned its screening from the gay film festival.  People should have the right to be able to voice their own objections.  I would ask others to watch this film only to see what they themselves thought of it and to get their point of view.  I would have to compare this film to a slight step above a porn film.,1378166400,4,716,4.5625
5713270,5,B00CBVMMUW,"So glad I bought this disc, especially if the Amazon Thought Police have censored it as too blatantly sexual, making it unavailable now.  No movie in my experience has so completely and realistically integrated frank sexuality into a plot; every other film I have ever seen suddenly seems dishonest and coy.  Not only is sexuality a character, but this must be the first time that the erect male organ has had more than a cameo or a walk-on role in a legit picture.  I mean, violence is a character in mainstream cinema, but until, now sex has just been an understudy.  That is sex, has been understudied.
The sexuality is between the characters however, and is not aimed to titillate the audience; nobody's body is idealized or shaven, porn-style. These are just people trying to love each other and understand themselves, or vice versa.
Every actor plays a character with his/her own name.  What does that mean?  The actors appear in an audition reel -- they do not seem to be the same people they are playing. Main character is Jesse Metzger, who seems like a nice Jewish boy -- although the hostile voice of his father on the phone ain't no jewish Dad.  Jesse is leaving behind the welcoming gay SF scene he has lived in for 10 years, and returning home back east .  Like American Graffiti, the film takes place on the last night of youth.  Jesse is leaving (we think) because he realizes he has been avoiding himself; sex is comfort food that he has outgrown.  But, what awaits him at home?  I hope there will be a sequel, but i bet there won't be.
It must be noted that a porn house produced this movie -- so this is less a regular filmmaker going into the netherworld than a porn studio taking what it has learned about sex and turning that into a work of art.  PLUS, it must be noted that the ubiquitous James Franco has entered a project with the director, Travis Matthews.  I've always been a Franco fan, but my respect for him went up when i read about this.",1376697600,15,1969,4.466480446927374

5713272,5,B00CBVMMUW,"This is a great racy movie.  It is exactly what sometimes we feel like doing as individuals but because of fear we do not go out and make a change; we stay in our comfort zone.

8580036,3,B00CBVMMUW,"I'm surprised that some have given this film 5 stars because really, it isn't any sort of masterpiece or even a particularly good story.  It really is just an OK movie with the best part being some overt sex outside the standard confines of pornography.  The actors are all average looking guys with a touch of scruffy grunginess who some may find attractive, but the eponymous characters they portray and the story they tell are not captivating.

The main character, Jesse, generally comes across as rather insipid and nave and you never come to care about him or what happens to him.  The same is true with all the other characters, none are fleshed out (no pun intended), they are all just set pieces.  The plot revolves around 2 days as Jesse prepares to return to his Midwest hometown after realizing that his 10 years in San Francisco as a dilatant performance artist have amounted to nothing.

The end is strange and doesn't make any sense as after receiving several messages from his seemingly disgruntled father who all but says that he doesn't want Jesse to come home, Jesse curiously says that he's excited at the prospect of going home - it just doesn't make sense. Other than that, there is no great drama presented, no deep truths revealed, no real fun had and very little entertainment on display except for the sex which will titillate some - but really, one could get better shots and better lighting by just hunting down some authentic porn.  It's really just a story about a group of seemingly inept 30 somethings doing average things over the course of two days.  Really, I came away thinking the plotless film was just a showcase to present graphic sex cloaked as a mainstream film.",1454716800,2,1703,4.691275167785235

8580038,3,B00CBVMMUW,"Now this movie is NO LONGER available from Amazon, ....(deemed too ""pornographic"" perhaps?), but you can get it on eBay, and for the open-minded it's worth looking for.

Where to start with this one....?
OK first up, it must be said that there IS very high and very explicit sexual content here.
If this is in any way likely to offend then be VERY assured here that THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR YOU!
Everything men do together is clearly and graphically shown completely and uncompromisingly....FULL ON!
Start, middle ...AND END!
NOT simulated at all but the real deal...far more than say ""Shortbus"" was prepared to show.
(Certainly off-limits for your Maiden-Aunt, or any ""god-botherers"" either!)

All that having been said, yet it manages to remain non-pornographic, ...or at least to me it does.

The sex is integrated into the narrative, (such as it is) in a most natural way, and not photographed in the usual porn-vid style. Nor is it Hallmark Greeting Card prettiness.
The actors are certainly not porn-stars either.
And for a group of gay men it must be said they are a remarkably scruffy lot.
They all have beards or very scraggy facial hair, and some of THE most appalling tatts ever to be created with a needle gun, (did they actually let six-year olds loose with those damned things?), but they appear so ...so....unkempt that you can almost smell them from the screen.
Surely this must be a conscious attempt to dis-associate them from the over-buffed-&-polished porn-stars?
Although the tatts are just as bad....both in concept, execution and that cancerously creeping invasiveness that the process itself seems to engender.

Anyway, to the story, or what there is of it.
A 30 something gay bloke who has lived in San Francisco in the full-on gay scene for quite some time has decided to pack it in and move back home to the Mid-West to live with Dad, who apparently knows little of his son's lifestyle....and probably understands less. Or even wants to.
Now the gay son has been working(?) as a ""performance artist"", ...something which I don't think there's going to be a great call for back in the sticks. He's run up big debts on a few loans and his credit card, which he's hoping to pay off by living free for a while.

Cue much angst, soul-searching and pondering on the meaning of life, love and the pursuit of happiness, as his friends prepare to throw him a farewell party....which the ungrateful bastard doesn't even bother to attend in the end!

That's pretty much it, ...with lengthy interludes as he and his male friends all eventually have sex in various and highly detailed ..(AND SHOWN!) permutations....but he seems to have some difficulties with the casual sexual act itself. He is aroused enough, but seems unable to ....er, ....""finish""?
Quite a truncated film actually.

Now it's certainly better than that execrable Brit. offering of ""Week End"" if you're familiar with that turkey, ....but only just, despite sharing some similarities.
The time frame of the action is only about two days, ...and VERY little happens, and both films hand out some fairly hackneyed kitchen-sink-style philosophy on what it means to be gay.
I think I also detected some ""aging"" issues .....ALWAYS a great fear in the gay community apparently, ...along with the dawning knowledge of the fact that you need to make money to be able to support yourself? (It took him THIS long to figure that out?)
However some of the dialogue is a little hard to understand at times, and the actors also mumble a bit, even when their mouths aren't full!

Now obviously all the cast ARE actually gay, ...or prepared to go to admirably GREAT ""lengths"" for their roles....and I DO mean exactly what I just said!
Cannot imagine any of the current Hollywood leading men being at all willing to go quite THIS far for their art....Ahem!
No simulation here!
There is also some expression by the lead character of the need to have the love/approval of one's Father, despite despising his world and views.

It all reeks ""Gay Film Festival"" entrant, and I guess that was probably the original idea.

As a film I'd like to be able to say that the total means more than the sum of the graphic sexual scenes, but if you compare the screen time spent on the narrative to that devoted to those sex scenes, ...the sex wins out pants down!
Draw your own conclusions from that.....

Will you enjoy this movie more above the waist, ...or below?
Well prurient interests aside, I'd have liked a little more character development and certainly more narrative.
You start to invest in the characters, and their situations, begin to wonder what will happen ...and then it just stops!

Some of the couples/trios are introduced, we learn a small bit about them from party chat, then they proceed to have full-on sex and that's it. Their story ends with the sex and we see no more of them.

This film is undoubtedly a very brave attempt to show REAL gay people doing REAL things, ...there's none of those over-waxed, orthodonticly enhanced, silly preening effeminate twinks here, ....but it's a bit like that apocryphal Chinese meal really .
Interesting enough while it's happening but ultimately leaving you wanting a little more?",1421193600,2,5193,4.808295964125561
