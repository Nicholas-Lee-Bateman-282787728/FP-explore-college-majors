1628604,4,B00005N5UT,"The set of 5 tapes arrived in an insulated box but the tape box itself had

a dent in it. That first tape on that side of the box had split in two on

the plastic. I did write the company about it and they answered very quickly and said to send the tape back and they would replace it. My husband decided he would try to clue the broken piece. Fortunately it

worked so we decided to forgo the mailing back of the tape. The outer box

that this set was mailed in was not dented and we think that the box with

the tapes was damaged before it was put in the mailing box. Accidents do

happen and it would not prevent me from ordering again from this company.

1628606,5,B00005N5UT,"Abba Eban was not only the most accomplished and articulate of all Israeli diplomats, he was also a person of immense learning and intelligence. Had he wished he could have taken a different road in life and become like his close friend, Bernard Lewis, a great scholar. Instead he made a certain sacrifice and devoted his life to the cause of helping the Jewish state come into being and survive.

This nine- part series is not concentrated on Israel but rather is a survey of Jewish civilization. Eban tries to show us how Jews interacted with the surrounding world, both learning and giving to the larger native socieities. From Babylon and Egypt to the Western Civlization of the present day Eban relates a story of a small people's long journey and meetings with others.

This is an illuminating survey and will give anyone who wishes to know more about Jewish life and history a real opportunity to do so.",1148774400,17,910,4.716981132075472

1628608,5,B00005N5UT,"It takes 9 hours to watch a complete set and it worths it. It interesting that my 6 years old daughter was watching some parts with me and we both enjoyed. There are a lot of reasons to watch the program. First, it gives a good overview of the western civilization from sumerians. Second, the quality of the material is superb. You'll see a lot of beautiful places around the globe. Third, you'll learn about the jews.

Some things are quite surpising. The program is focused on dates, places and events. It tells you what happened and where but not much about why. Also it doesn't tell much jewish religion or traditions. If you want to know about jewish holidays, what kosher is etc, you'll need to look for other sources.

Overall, it's a great history program!",1114560000,16,764,4.569343065693431
1628609,1,B00005N5UT,"AND THAT IS BORING AND SNOBISH!  I watched the first two hours of this and coudn't keep awake.  The narritor's voice was monotone. I wanted to shout at his pompous, snobish demeanor SHUT UP!!  In my opinion is not the proper way to educate is to entertain at all god's peoples. With the narritor, granted he is educated but does he have to shove his creditals and his attitude from the gecko. When you take people on a educating journey (such as nine hours long) invite them like you would invite into a warm a loving welcoming home. I felt with his demeanor and atitude felt beat up and like I was crawling on my hands and knees through out the first two hours. I am not watching the rest of the seven hours and returning this DVD set back to the library and saying ""Check Please"".",1112227200,6,782,4.3061224489795915
1628610,5,B00005N5UT,"This nine-part documentary is not only a history of the Jews, it's a history of the western world! Hundreds of thousands of dollars were probably spent in the production of this series. Abba Eban takes the viewer all over the world to examine one of the world's most gifted and intriguing people - the Jews. These tapes will not put you to sleep. The music and images allows the viewer to relive Jewish history. And consequently, come to understand the world we live in today much better. I know the tapes are pricey, but own this documentary if you ever have the chance. You'll never regret it.",1047513600,44,595,4.570093457943925
1628611,5,B00005N5UT,"WOW!  This is an incredible set to have.  The DVD is a reprint from a PBS special in 1984 (Peabody winner, at that).  Abba Eban is an incredible, captivating speaker.  My only problem is that there is so much information, I can only watch about two hours at a time.  This is a must have whether you are Jewish or not.  The series pulls together world history unlike any class I took in college.  The addition of the DVD-Rom with tons of maps, historical documents, and video clips is awesome.  It has answered most of the questions I had, and let me view a moving graphical history by sliding the scroll bar.  Super buy for a history buff!",1012953600,56,639,4.3474576271186445

1628613,5,B00005N5UT,"This DVD is a re-issue of a 9-hour mini-series that first aired in the 1980s, and was recently (Nov-Dec. 2001) aired again on PBS. Each segment is 1 hour long, making it a useful tool in history classes covering many different periods.  Since the ""history of civilization"" textbooks rarely mention what the Jews were doing in the 1900-year period between the rise of Christianity and the Nazi Holocaust, this series plays an important role in helping to make the curriculum more inclusive. Plus, The DVD version has a lot of additional resource materials not in the original PBS series.
Regarding classroom appropriateness in public schools, this is a documentary, not a ""religion"" series. Yes, the series does talk about religion in some places, but it's called ""Civilization and the Jews"" for a reason. To be Jewish is not just a ""religion,"" it is also a culture, with its own art, music, literature, etc.  The approach is a mix of history, theology, archaeology, art, architecture, etc. that is intended to inform, not preach.  The series clearly shows how Jews have contributed to the various civilizations where they lived, and how, in turn, the Jews benefitted from interaction with many of the different cultures where the Jewish communities were located. Yes, it also covers the pesecutions of the Jews, but it's well-balanced with positive experiences and events.  Highly recommended!",1006905600,99,1393,5.1233480176211454

1628616,5,B00005N5UT,"An impeccably created documentary on the four thousand year history of the remarkable people called the Jews, that have now returned to their ancient homeland, a narrated by the illustrious Abba Eban.
The film is jam packed with footage of towns and ruins, monuments etc of the places under discussion in Israel, the Middle East and Europe. It is divided into 9 episodes , and provides the background history of the world in which the Jewish people found itself, the experiences of the Jews and their vast contribution to world civilization.

Some very palpable points made such as the thousands year unbroken connection of the Jewish people with Jerusalem. With the destruction of the Temple Jerusalem retained a centrality in Jewish hearts and minds that never ended. He quotes Jewish scriptures : 'There is no wisdom like the wisdom of the Land of Israel. There is no beauty like the beauty of Jerusalem'.

Jews lived in Jerusalem at various times during the two thousand year exile and there has been a Jewish majority in Jerusalem since the 1860s.
A thin but continuous line of Jewish continuity , this digest illustrates remained in Jerusalem, Safed, Jaffa and Hebron, before the rebirth of the modern Zionist movement. Every one of the conquerors of the Holy Land had its origins elsewhere, Palestine was never the birthplace of any people other than the Jews, . The idea of Palestine as their homeland was never
Penetrating an analysis of Jew-hatred including those from so-called enlightened rulers and philosophers, begging the question today when Jew-hatred in the form of anti-Zionism (hatred of Israel and Israelis down to the last child) pervades governments, media, educational institutions , governments and NGOs and we have to ask now as in three hundred years ago, how those who claim to be enlightened can remain silent about this hatred in their midst.
Episode 8 with harrowing footage takes us through the horrors of the Holocaust (Shoah) and the last Episode discusses the rebirth of The State of Israel, its conflicts, achievements and struggles to survive with beautiful footage of the land and people as well as the ruthless persecution of Jews in the Soviet Union and the situation of Jews today in the USA-their achievements and struggle for identity.",1370908800,,2278,5.023809523809524

Not only is Abba Eban a scholar of history and a master narrator, I found out that the product is more than just some DVDs that you insert into a DVD player.  The entire DVD narrative, along with supportive articles, maps, and other information can be installed on a computer, which made it extremely easy for showing to my students.  I was able to pick specific points of importance to show to the students, for emphasis.  The product turned out to be a lot more than I had anticipated!",1353715200,3,641,4.5
1628620,5,B00005N5UT,"These DVDs are my favourites of all documentaries I own, and among my top five favourites of all documentaries I've seen. Abba Eban makes the history of Israel interesting and even, at times, fascinating. The footage on each and every DVD is sometimes captivating, other times stunning, and rarely boring. I learnt so much history and culture of the Jews and their civilization and religion from these DVDs. The Jews are one of the foundational components of Western civilization. Without studying their history and culture, you cannot satisfactorily know and understand Western history and culture. Plus Eban has a sense of humour that made me laugh on a few occasions. He is eloquent and the research behind these DVDs is excellent and was obviously extensive. I go back to these DVDs occasionally, and still enjoy them each time.

This is an excellently produced documentary in several series which explores the development of the cultural, historical, social and religious contributions of Jews throughout history. Abba Eban's narration is stellar.  As mentioned,  ""using paintings, artifacts, modern cinematography of ancient sites, readings and theatrical music"" presents a dramatic and splendid setting for this ""masterpiece"". It is presented with all the mellifluousness which we have come to expect from PBS. Bravo!",1304812800,3,588,5.905882352941177

Despite a few production values which are a bit dated even in this restored dvd, it's entertaining and visually rich.  The content is true to the title, and this IS the history of the Jewish people, but Heritage is also very much about all of western civilization.  Abba Eban is the perfect narrator,and also part of the Jewish history on which he expounds.  It's not apparent from his scripted role, but the late Dr. Eban was an extraordinarily articulate scholar turned politician.  I remember him as Israel's ambassador to the UN, and his ability to speak extemporaneously, clearly, and persuasively stood out in the 60s, and would still today.",1249257600,4,725,4.869918699186992
