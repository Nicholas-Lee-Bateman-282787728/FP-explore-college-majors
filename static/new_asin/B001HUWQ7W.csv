3644534,3,B001HUWQ7W,"I was expecting something technical and interesting but instead got what I feel to be a bunch of fluff. There is good footage of the 2008 season and it is interesting to hear Lorenzo's bit on mental preparation and Colin Edward's and Valentino Rossi's segments on braking and overtaking but everything else seems pointless (a segment on managing w/ the media? Really?!).

There are no interesting special features (the supposedly interactive feature w/ Stoner's bike is awful. just one picture and a few words) and the DVD seems to just scratch the surface of being in Moto GP while offering no real ""riding secrets"", the description and title are very misleading. Not at all worth the money.",1231200000,5,692,4.914529914529915
3644535,3,B001HUWQ7W,"Firstly let me say that I have seen (and done) quite a lot of motorcycle racing and instruction. I am also a subscriber to motogp.com and follow all the content on this site.

So this DVD have interviews with many of the great riders from MotoGP. Unfortunately the format is informal chatting with the riders and they describe how it is to ride and race in MotoGP. These interviews seem like longer versions of what is posted daily on the MotoGP.com website, but not really in more depth.

I guess I am disappointed because the recent 15 minute internet video with Andy Abbott and Valentino Rossi on a Yamaha R6 is so much more instructional that the entire DVD.  The new riding video is produced to celebrate 10 years of the Yamaha R series and is posted on [...]

If this is your first introduction to MotoGP its a good DVD otherwise its mainly rainy afternoon entertainment",1229644800,13,876,4.560509554140127

8309734,3,B001HUWQ7W,The video is too basic. There is no secret at all on it. But its cool to see the MotoGP pilots at work anyway.,1424908800,,110,3.625
8309735,2,B001HUWQ7W,"If you're looking to become a better rider, look elsewhere. There's not a whole lot of info that will help you. You get some helpful hints like ""ride smoother in the rain"", and ""winning feels really good"", but there isn't much here that will help you improve your technique.

As another reviewer pointed out, this DVD should really be named ""MotoGP: Behind the Scenes."" It's basically a collection of interviews with various riders, all who give their opinion on various aspects of riding. Loris Capirossi and Rizla Suzuki get a lot (and I mean a lot) of screen time, much more so than the likes of Stoner and Rossi.

My favorite part of the movie is the incredibly awkward conversation between Nicky Hayden and Dani Pedrosa about setup and riding style. You can tell that neither of them want to be there. At one point, Nicky snaps a plastic cup in half and continues to saw away at it. The conversation continues as he grinds the cup into dust, with the microphones picking up all the nasty crackling. They're barely making eye contact by the end. Fantastically amusing stuff.

Jorge Lorenzo does give some insightful comments about his race prep. In fact, he gives some of the most insightful commentary of the movie.

Final verdict: buy it only if you're a GP nut, and get it as cheaply as you can.",1397779200,,1302,4.623376623376624
8309736,2,B001HUWQ7W,"This dvd is not technical at all

Just riders disussing generally about their riding

You will learn nothing really usefull to improve your riding skills

After viewing the video i felt like having lost my money

From my point of view you should pass on this one!",1396742400,,263,4.531914893617022
8309737,5,B001HUWQ7W,"I recommend buying this DVD, because I it helped me a lot and It was interesting listening to the pro's about what they do and don't. You can learn from them...
Ride safe!!",1360195200,,172,4.242424242424242
8309738,1,B001HUWQ7W,"Outside of the segment on Lorenzo's mental preparation, this video has no redeeming quality.  These guys are the best in the world at what they do, but a skill they do not possess is the skill of a teacher.  They are just inept at providing useful instruction.  They have been doing the basics their entire lives, so they take everything for granted that most people would like to know who are purchasing this.  They perform at such a high level, they're beyond ""technique"", so they don't even discuss it.  There were multiple references to ""your style"", ""everybody has their own approach"", etc.  Sure its great to know which riders use two fingers and which use three on the front brake, but does that help at all?
It does give an outsider a glimpse of what some of the less interesting aspects of MotoGP riders lives are like.  If this is the only MotoGP related DVD you have, you probably won't find it as useless as I did, but if you have any of the season reviews, ""Faster"", ""The Doctor, The Tornado, and The Kentucky Kid"", et al, you have no use for this.
The biggest mistake this video makes is that it has no audience.  A beginner won't learn anything from it because it doesn't even mention the basics of body position (it mentions body position, but it doesn't explain what good body position is), shifting, etc.  And an advanced rider has no use for this either because all it tells someone who already knows what they are doing is, 'you need to do what works for you'.
It's really better than the one star I gave it, but not by much.  To see anyone give this five stars is upsetting the true average of a sub-standard product.  Its about a two star video.  Don't expect much, but better yet, don't be disappointed with the purchase and just pass on this.",1333584000,,1766,4.4672897196261685
