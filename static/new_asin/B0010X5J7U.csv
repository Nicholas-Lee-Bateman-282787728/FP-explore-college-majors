8238810,2,B0010X5J7U,"This was a rather disappointing biographical survey of Modest Mussorgsky's life. I purchased this DVD to use with one of my classes as an introduction to his life, and in our discussion of some of his work like ""Pictures"". Having spent a good deal of time reading up on the composer, I was disappointed in the lack of detail of this DVD. Although it hits major points like the Balakirev circle, and the nationalist aspect of his career, it leaves out very important musical works and personalities. The only two musical examples heard on the DVD come from ""Boris"" and the promenade theme from ""Pictures"". Mussorgsky wrote a great deal more than this! Also, I was not impressed with the video footage used. Most of the time, all that is shot are images of Russian forests. Perhaps they could've showed an orchestra playing one of his pieces, maybe places that Mussorgsky lived or theaters his works were played in. This was just a disappointing, limited film. I had intended to buy the other ones in the Great Russian Composers series, but I think I shall stop here.",1239667200,,1065,4.7005347593582885

American authors often speak about writing ""The Great American Novel,"" but many audiences often forget how important national issues are to artists.  This work says Modest was very interested in reflecting and promoting Russia.  In the same way that Frida and Diego Rivera were miscegenated artists with financial resources how strongly identified with indigenous folk, Modest was raised in a wealthy home and seemed interested in the former serfs.  In the same way that Schubert was a composer who died young due to syphilis, Modest died young due to alcoholism.  This work never mentions if he was married and I wondered if he had a rainbow flag persona like Russian composer Tchaikovsky.  Though he worked pre-Lenin, the work mentions that the Russian government censored or condemned some of his work as seditious.  The work shows Modest in a drunken state and it almost reminded me of a frozen Jack Nicholson in ""The Shining.""

This documentary starts off really dull.  Later, you see more minarets and fur caps.  There seem to be clips of Russian performances that I imagine were filmed in the 1970s.  The work tries to showcase the music and biographical facts equally.",1205193600,,1299,4.962962962962963
