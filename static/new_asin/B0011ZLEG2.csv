8243179,1,B0011ZLEG2,"Funny,I don't know why I watch these DVDs but I get a good laugh. Very typical Christian videos Rock Music is Evil,Dungens and Dragons,Every other Religion,Etc. Rock band Kiss stands for Knights in Satan Service? Worth checking out this DVD",1510272000,,240,5.025
8243180,4,B0011ZLEG2,Both films were very good and still very relevant to our society today. I would like to see an updated version of these films made for 2017.,1502236800,,140,4.222222222222222
8243181,5,B0011ZLEG2,Dave Hunt is well-read and true to the Word!,1489449600,,44,4.0
8243182,4,B0011ZLEG2,"This was a well put together video on the occult. The only real negative I have is it is rather dated, however the message is still very contemporary. My class enjoyed this video and learned from it. I recommend it for teachers as good basic source material for this subject.",1329868800,,275,4.52
8243183,4,B0011ZLEG2,"Two documentries on one DVD.

The Cult documentry maybe old footage, however it provides good information exposing the cults & their false doctrines. Testimonies from Ex-Cultists.

The Occult documentry, also old footage, are people involed in darkness
and worship the devil (only recommend Christians who are very strong
in the faith to watch dvd WITH others).

Good dvd for Apologetists.",1208390400,7,389,5.45
8243184,5,B0011ZLEG2,"This is a remarkable effort and should be in the library of every Christian who dares witness.  And if you do not love Him enough to be his witness why call yourself a Christian.

If you are not a believer in Biblical Christianity, but are caught up in ""another Jesus"" or some sort of other spiritual journey this may be the light that will illuminate how dark the darkness is that is you - and me - and every other soul absent the saving power of Jesus Christ, is sitting in.  Some of the cults covered in this video include Mormons, Jehovah's Witness, Scientology (look out Tom Cruise), Unity and even some of the really remote cults like Jim Jones and the People's Temple and the Charles Mansion Family.

This is not a 21st century production in the sense that the hair and fashions are out of date and the two scholars who are featured in this DVD have probably passed on.  Dave Hunt and Dr. Walter Martin are two men who have devoted themselves to understanding the allure and the pitfalls of cults and pseudo religions.  I started reading their works more than 30 years ago and do you know what - nothing has changed.

I applaud the courage of the makers of this tool.  The production qualities are solid and the cases made are solid enough to use with confidence.

8243185,4,B0011ZLEG2,"Brian's video work is outstanding. He is extremely knowledgeable in the area of christian cults and the occult. This video is very pertinent for our culture today in exposing the lies that are so pervasive.
Some of the content is dated but is still relevant for all of us today.
A great resource for your video library.",1205193600,11,319,4.614035087719298
8243186,5,B0011ZLEG2,"This was an excellent film with a timely and important message.  I used it as a series at our Wednesday evening devotional with Scripture references and a question and answer period, it was a hit with congregation from the youth to the seniors.

8243187,5,B0011ZLEG2,"These are real ""classics."" They are extremely informative & can give an historical perspective of how things have progressed since the early '80's. They all are well edited and move through a lot of very interesting content. I especially enjoyed the Bonus Material - ""Is There Life After Marriage."" I found the couples interviewed very open & honest about the stresses on their marriages that almost broke them up and then the healing that took place to revive their marriages. Great value for the price!",1201305600,3,504,4.9411764705882355
