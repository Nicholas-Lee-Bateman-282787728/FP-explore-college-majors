4994924,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I just saw the part 2 of ""Breaking Dawn"" (in my country it opened on November 14) and I was very impressed. I loved this skillful and very faithful adaptation of the final chapters of ""Twilight"" saga. WARNING: this review contains limited SPOILERS and also some slightly dirty jokes...

As probably everybody already knows, this film begins with Bella Cullen (former Bella Swan) making her first steps as a newly created vampire, very soon after the extremely difficult birth of her daughter Renesmee. Things that happened at the end of the previous part are discreetly reminded to us by the extraordinary opening scene, in which we can enjoy the beauty of state of Washington, listen to the perfectly adapted music and finally watch how the nature changes when winter comes - and all of this is somehow connected to Bella's transformation. I was very impressed by those first scenes - it is rare to see the opening credits put to such a good use.

Bella's first days as newborn vampire are a delight to watch. Unlike many Kristen Stewart haters I think she is a pretty talented actress. However until now Bella's character was less active than others and therefore Kristen Stewart did the right thing adopting a discreet, introverted approach to this role in previous parts. But as a vampire Bella is paradoxically more ""alive"" than ever before and in this film Kristen Stewart acts in a much more assertive way - and she does a great job! Also, with the help of some make up and computer improvement of images, she is suddenly more beautiful than ever. Clearly the un-death becomes her... She also can finally let her husband make love to her without fearing that she will end as Bella-jelly on the rocks... (sorry I couldn't resist). And finally, as a newborn, she is also the strongest vampire in the coven, for a time at least - something that Emmett will learn in great detail...)))

The joy of other members of Cullen clan who see Edward finally happy with his recently deceased young bride and his newborn half-undead daughter (yes, I know this sounds complicated, but really, this is how the story goes) is a very pleasant thing to see. There is of course one enormous elephant in the room - the weird attachment Jacob (your friendly neighborhood werewolf) developed towards Renesmee, to great annoyance of Edward (no father appreciates a potential son-in-law who can lick him) and an even greater fury of Bella, as no mother wants her precious daughter to be an underdog...))) Jacob's ""puppy love"" was considered as very shocking by many reviewers of books - but here it is shown as something perfectly safe and quite respectable...

But soon appears a threat to Edward and Bella's happiness and in fact to the very existence of the whole Cullen coven. As we already know since the part 2, between the vampire royalty, the Volturi and the Cullens there is bad blood (pun very much intentional). In this episode the escalating tension will finally reach the breaking point...

The description of the developing crisis, the mobilization of hostile armies, the confrontation and finally the rather unexpected but clever resolution of the whole problem were well described in the book and are even better shown on the screen. Volturi-Cullens conflict is a great moment of cinema!

Those who read the second part of the last book in the series certainly remember that there are NO action scenes in it - and those who saw the trailers had to notice that there is one HUGE battle scene, with the Volturi Guard fighting Cullens, Denalis and their other vampire and werewolf allies. The film however remains a VERY faithful adaptation of the novel... Confused already? Well, I can not reveal details, but believe me, there IS an easy explanation. Also, adding this extremely well shown furious battle helped this film - in fact it helped it very much...

The way this huge battle is described reminded me very much of Iliade and the fights between heroes of Troy War. I will not describe here anything from the battle in ""Breaking Dawn, part 2"" but it is somehow similar to the description of events by Homer. In Iliad, we can read that Sarpedon, a valiant Trojan ally, was killed in fight by Patroclus. Later, Hector avenged Sarpedon by killing Patroclus, but then was himself slain by this latter's best friend, Achilles. After that Paris, Hector's brother, killed Achilles with a poisoned arrow, before being himself shot and killed by Philoctetes. In the great battle scene in this film, fights between successive heroes and champions follow a somehow similar logic. I loved this long scene greatly.

There are many other delights in this film, especially when vampires invited by the Cullens arrive. American and European nomads are very little shown, with the exception of Alistair - on another hand the Egyptians and the Irish coven appear a little bit more, and the powers of Benjamin are particularly impressive in the film...

Amazonian amazons are absolute eye-candy - especially Zafrina is an impressively hot creature. In the film only two amazons, Zafrina and Senna, are present (the third one, Kachiri, is not even mentioned). The girls from the Denali coven are even hotter, especially Kate and Tanya. All those who liked ""Dexter"" will be delighted to see Christian Camargo playing Eleazar, the only male of the Denali coven. Garrett, the nomad who will later join the Denali coven, provides tons of humor as a vampire who never fully recovered from the Independence War (he still passionately hates everything British).

And then there are of course Vladimir and Stefan from the Romanian (or rather Transylvanian) coven. Those two are a show in the show! In principle they seem to be very serious and even deadly dangerous - but their faces and their speech are simply irresistible! Every time they appear, the whole theater would puff and giggle... Oh, it may come as a surprise to you, but if you really want to FULLY appreciate those two vampires, read ""The cat in the hat"" before going to cinema - no, this is not a joke and I am not crazy - believe me, there is a connection...)))

All those characters provide great fun, especially in the scene preceding the great confrontation, when something like twenty vampires and one werewolf sit around a campfire at night and tell scary stories!!

There are however some characters missing in action. When the Volturi appeared I was very surprised that unlike in the book the wives, Sulpicia and Athenodora, were absent. Even worse, Felix, the hulking chief enforcer/executioner of Volturi does NOT appear in this film - and this is a great pity! Also, Wendell Pierce, who plays the somehow mysterious Mr Jenks, should have more screen time - at the very least a couple of minutes...

I would greatly advise to watch the final credits to the end as they are a farewell for all the series. Many girls in the cinema were very moved by those last moments - and that included my wife...

I positively loved this film - it is a very, very good conclusion to the extraordinary adventure that was watching ""Twilight"" series. After surviving James, Victoria, Riley, the army of newborns, the conflict with the werewolves and even the confrontation with the Volturi, at the end of this film the two recently married lovers could finally begin what is the REAL GLORIOUS adventure, both for the mortals and the undead - spending life together and raise the children...

""And now forever?"" asked Edward. ""And now forever"" whispered Bella. The Fate didn't say anything this time - she was having a busy working lunch with the director of the next ""Hunger Games"" film...",1352851200,354,7622,4.847809377401998
4994925,5,B006JM1ZTI,I read all of the books and loved them. I have watched all four movies that have been put out so far and loved them. They have taken so much time with the development of characters and sticking to the basics of the book. I can only imagine that the last movie will be just as awesome as the ones before. People who give this movie one star are not true Twilight fans.,1342396800,27,367,4.041095890410959
4994926,4,B006JM1ZTI,"Bella awakens to a new world. Her senses are sharpened, she's beautiful, and she's strong. As a newborn vampire, she should be blood-thirsty, so the Cullen family won't let her see her baby. Although she can feel the thirst for blood burning in her lungs, Bella's will power and self-control prove so strong that they eventually let her see baby Renesmee. The baby needs her, too. When Bella learns that Jacob imprinted on her baby, she snaps and attacks him, but is restrained by Edward and Seth.

Esme has renovated a cottage on the property for Bella and Edward to give them some privacy. They again make love, which Bella enjoys even more as a vampire. She misses Charlie, yet is lost as to how to break the news of her transformation to him. Jacob takes the matter into his own hands by first exposing himself as a werewolf to Charlie. He tells him that Bella has also undergone an ""unusual"" change but wants to have him in her life, if he can handle it. Bella manages to control her blood thirst when Charlie visits. He falls in love with his ""special"" grandchild.

In a matter of weeks, Renesmee can talk and grows big enough to walk and hunt. When Bella and Jacob take her on a hunting trip, Irina, a sister of the Denali clan, misidentifies Renesmee as an ""immortal child,"" which is one of the highest crimes under Volturi law. Alice sees Irina telling the Volturi this news and predicts that they will come and destroy the Cullens. Shortly after, she disappears with Jasper.

Bella receives a note from Alice that leads her to a man named J. Jenkins. She asks him to create fake travel identification for Jacob and Renesmee, so they can flee together, in case none of the Cullens survive the fight against the Volturi.

To stop the Volturi, the Cullens call in their friends to witness that Renesmee is not an immortal child, but is half-human. Training for a possible fight against the vastly superior Volturi army, Bella discovers that she can use the power of her ""private mind"" as a shield that can expand to protect others from the mental powers of even the fiercest Volturi.

Upon confronting the Cullens and their allies, the Volturi discover that Irina was wrong, and they immediately execute her. However, they remain undecided on whether to consider Renesmee as a threat to the vampire world's secret existence. Enter Alice and Jasper with a young man named Nahuel, another vampire-human crossbreed. He demonstrates that the crossbreeds pose no threat. His immortality also puts Bella's worries about Renesmee's disturbing growth rate to rest. Faced with the evidence as well as Bella's powerful shield, the Volturi take their leave. Bella, Edward, and Renesmee return to their home in peace to live happily ever after.",1342137600,172,2739,4.770042194092827

4995045,4,B006JM1ZTI,"I saw these movies because I read the books and was curious as to how they would compare. This last movie was somewhat better than the other movies in the series. The make up was much better (Edward and Carlisle's faces didn't look like white chalk like in the first movie) Edward's fluffy (rather off putting for me, especially because the character in the book is supposed to be divinely beautiful - as are all the Cullens) sideburns were better groomed. I liked how they made Alice show Aro what his future would be and the fight scenes much better than the descriptions in the book. I also liked the fact that Jacob and the child actually started to escape, rather than all the futile preparation to this end described in the book. That is why I give this a mild ""I like it.""",1494547200,,779,4.416666666666667
4995046,2,B006JM1ZTI,"After watching Twilight, the movie, a box set of the series was purchased by me.  Yes there are other vampire romance stories out there but why people feel compelled to compare them is beyond the understanding of mine.  I adored both the movie and the book for Twilight.

This two part movie fails to be worthy of the series, believe do I. They both barely resemble the books and the attempt was obvious that they 'tried' to do a literal translation form novel to movie.  They would have been better off ""basing"" the series off the books, such as ""Queen of the Damned"" by Anne Rice, or as they are doing for the Marvel movies... or even the D.C. movies though they are inferior.

First off the Director and/or the screenwriter responsible for the translation failed to read the novel series... or maybe they failed to 'enjoy' what they read and so they forgot half of it.  The special effects themselves were good, but just the way the effects added to the story failed to mesh.  Adding a monologue of 'Bella describing what is going through her head would have made a world of difference.

The movie seemed entirely too dependent on the audience to have read the books, and yet the majority who have done so would find it severely wanting.  For instance, the scene of Bella's transformation, the visuals failed to come remotely close to the amount of pain the books described her being in.  Having Ms. Stewart simply read a short passage from the book as a monologue would have done more.

This BluRay film was excellent with great video and and audio output. The film is good and this is one of my favorite films of the Twilight saga. The special effects were very good and I liked the fight scenes.

In addition to getting the BluRay disc we also got a digital copy of the film that we can stream to our computers, tablets and our ROKU box. We can even stream the film on our WIFI or download it to our tablets or our computer so we can view it without using a WIFI while we are mobile.  We like the digital capability and when we stream it to our TV using the ROKU and VUDU the HDX quality is excellent.

This is a good film and if you like the Twilight saga then this is a must have film. Get it in the BluRay format with the digital copy and you won't be sorry. I rated it at 5 stars.

We have enjoyed watch this film and it is a great film to add to your personal video library.",1483574400,8,1053,3.9295774647887325

4995272,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I read the Twilight saga back when it first came out and I loved the love story that it is.  I told my mom and my sister to read the books and they loved the love story, too.  When I saw the first movie, I was initially disappointed and thought it was too cheesy.  It was not what I pictured in my mind.  However, as time has gone by, the movies have become endeared to me as well.

I recently put many of my DVDs into sleeves and could not find my copy of this movie.  Of course, I found it right after I purchased a new one so now I have two.  There are worse things.

By the way, I created a bit of a monster since my mom has read Breaking Dawn over 20 times.  She has probably seen the movie more than that.  We had a great time on our trip to Forks a couple years ago with my daughters.  Oh, and my dog's name is Bella.  :)",1469923200,2,828,3.7777777777777777

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!!

She doesn't always say the book was better. Sometimes she likes the movie better. In this case, she thought they complemented each other. The movie follows the book closely. It has to condense some for time allowed, that why so many movies are cut up in two parts these days. The YA genre is full of paranormal romance. This story was a refreshing spin off the usual formula of teen angst with supernatural/futuristic elements. I have to say, that I watched it too and while I wasn't as engrossed in it as my girlfriend was, it was easy to follow, well-written, and had a strong leading player. I recommend this movie whether you have read the book or not.",1458000000,4,791,4.387755102040816

4995398,5,B006JM1ZTI,"So I also live in Spain and mostly buy my movies on Blu-Ray. Have been looking at an option to purchase movies online in English without needing a VPN to pretend I am somewhere else. The Apple ecosystem seems like the best, but I hate the closed Apple Ecosystem. I am a Microsoft grunt, in the sense I have a Windows phone, Xbox, Windows 10 PC etc., but the Windows store also has this retarded only in Spanish system where movies are not available in their own original language. I just went to Google Play to check out the Google option and they too have a retarded system. I see what Paolo says about the content owners, but I do not give two hoots about the content owners. At the end of the day, it is Apple, Microsoft, Google or some other company which is licensing me the content. If they cannot be bothered to license me digital content with a plethora of language and subtitle options, well then I cannot be bothered to purchase the content. Either give me something which is a value proposition or shove it, and trust me there are plenty of other options for obtaining the content for free in the languages I want.

The companies involved, content producers and licensing re-sellers need to smarten up and improve their game or they will never attract customers like me. I have no problem paying for the content, but I will not buy or ""license"" a shoddy product which I cannot even view in its original language. NO NO NO. Wake up and smell the coffee that we live in a multi-language world where people are travelling and interacting with different cultures and languages more so than at any other time. E.g. I am British, living in Spain with a Brazilian girl friend. I want to watch stuff in English , she wants to watch stuff in Portuguese or at least with Portuguese or Spanish subtitles. The online options available from the three major companies are all pretty poor. Stop locking down language options, and make it easier for the customers to get the content they want and are willing to pay for. These language restrictions are dreamt up by retards at the content producers who have a scant understanding of the markets they are selling too.

Aside from that, the content producers currently have an oligopoly in place with the artificial licensing restrictions by country which stop us from playing our content whilst travelling etc., Again, this is a Kafkaesque system drawn up by idiots who have no understanding of what their customers actually want. The EU is slowly coming around to realising what these retards have put in place and there is talk of removing the license restrictions by country and creating a homogeneous EU zone. Bring it on. Then there will actually be proper competition in a more normal marketplace rather than the current artificial monstrosity which as users we currently suffer through.

Sadly, right now, Apple appears to have the ""best"" system in place for language optionality. Disappoint Google! Google and Android have the most open architecture and I would much rather have bought into the Google ecosystem for movies.

4995874,2,B006JM1ZTI,"As a Adult male I have always been inquisitive why this movie/books attracted so much attention. I also enjoy a variety of vampire and werewolves movies. I am not afraid to enjoy a ""chick flick"", as this and all of the five movies are the targeted audience, females that is. So I didn't mind taking a chance. My review will apply for all five movies.  A little less drama on the love scenes, could have been implemented, and the fact it wasn't is a reason these movies get a low rating! Its hard to find a critic who knocks the special effects and action scenes. Very well done.  If the over whelming over done drama love scenes were shortened, but yet still proving the back bone of this movie, it would have been perfect. I can not give it a one rating simply because i have scene worse movies, and the special effects/action scenes and suspense was well done.",1426896000,,862,4.415094339622642

Man, couldn't Kristin have worked on attempting to make herself appear to be a loving, caring, MOM?! Even just a little?!? There was obviously NO connection whatsoever between the child and Bella. The story reading at bed time was ridiculous and totally artificial as well as all the interactions she had with her ""daughter"" throughout the whole move. Disappointing, to say the least. Ummmm...it's called acting Kristin. Maybe she should have done some research at a daycare center or something. geez. Turn-off.",1425945600,,623,5.117647058823529

4995992,5,B006JM1ZTI,"Okay I'll admit it in public & in front of John Cassavetes (may he still RIP) - I thoroughly enjoyed the entire ""Twilight Saga"" Thing.  Such Incredibly Pretty people set in one of my all time favorite scenarios...human female falls for male vampire.  (we're talkin' big time Buffy fan here folks)  It was compellingly romantic w/such magical/contemporary ""special effects"" I couldn't fight it & lord knows I made a real effort!  Besides these two just having too much of what used to be called ""screen presence"" - there were those huge/magnificent wolf creatures.  So, by the time they made a baby - I couldn't help myself.  Can I ask why the girl-child had to look quite that weird tho?  She made my skin crawl.  But it makes no never mind...Edward & Bella got to rock 'n' roll their socks off for all eternity & Jacob got to babysit...",1424044800,,837,4.608108108108108

Beyond cheesy (I vomited in my mouth at least a dozen times), horrible acting (they could have cast a mannequin to play Bella and it would have been dead on the same)  and everyone lives happily ever after. Which doesn't even make sense. Then at the end we're supposed to be happy about the other love interest (I call him pig nose) who's a werewolf, becoming a child molester. Then my wife informs me there's more of these, What? We need to make our prisoners of war have to watch these. Hands down worse than waterboarding.",1419984000,3,600,4.405405405405405

I would love if this Saga continued forever, as long as the story stayed with quality.
Bella was a surprisingly strong young woman, just turning 18 years old and knew where her heart should be,
I liked that Bella used the word ""we"" when describing her situation. The writer did an excellent job but the producers tripled the experience with the movie.
The end could be the end of the Twilight Saga's or could have one believe their is more to come.
I enjoyed the cast and was pleased that no one was replaced and remained until the end.

There is plenty of life left in the Twilight Saga, and the story can go anywhere from here. If your a person who has never seen any of the Twilight movies, I highly recommend watching them. It's not just for the romantic or for the teen following, it's a well told story with plenty of action and suspence. At the core, the relationship between Bella & Edwood, reminds me of the old classic love stories of days gone by. And as time passes, will remain a classic. Well acted by all the cast. From the interviews I've seen, the case members wanted to stay true to the book's and help bring the story to life on the screen.

4996391,3,B006JM1ZTI,"Warned: Spoilers

While yes, I do love the movie, but the fight scene really made me mad.
Many beloved characters, vampires and wolves alike, die in the scene that WAS NOT IN THE BOOK.
I love the books, they remain my favorite and I've read them 9 times.
But it really irked me that the major fight scene happened.
Sure, there was little to nothing happening, but it DIDN'T HAPPEN, AND IT COULDN'T!
It finished as a vision of Alice's, which couldn't have happened because of these reasons:
1. Alice is unable to see the wolves' futures, due to the fact that shifting plays such a massive role.
2. She can't see Renesmee either, since she is something that Alice has never encountered.

4996467,2,B006JM1ZTI,"Alas, the Twilight Saga ended not with a bang but with a whimper. The attempt to emulate the Harry Potter series by stretching out the last episode to two films failed fairly miserably, due to simple lack of material. If Breaking Dawn had been condensed into a single movie it would still have had to be shorter than this to hold the viewer's interest.

This version departs quite dramatically from the book. I have no problem with that provided the film holds together as a stand-alone piece of work, but it doesn't. It drags on and on and is only saved from complete mediocrity and a one-star review by an exciting and well-realized battle scene at the end. All the intrigue and sense of wonder in the first movie has gone and it's hard to feel any emotional involvement with the characters.

The book, which I have read, is considerably better. Stick with that and leave this film in the bargain bin where it belongs.",1406073600,,920,4.569696969696969

I guess the appeal is young people getting to live forever and have lots of power.  I almost can't stand the meshing of the fake English 1820s vampire and woods groups with the modern world of humans.  But I got through it somehow because the effects were interesting.  Somehow this annoys me much more than X men which is similar in it's level of ridiculousness.  I think because X Men has a lot more action and interest.

I think too many studios are doing that not out of necessity but knowing the fans will pay to see both movies.  I remember first seeing this in the theater and seeing the new ending - the entire theater cried out in disbelief (literally!).  I had been nervous after BD Part 1 - I didn't think they had done a great job with that one.  I was pleased that they seemed to do better with this final movie.,1403827200,,528,4.188118811881188

She developed an imaginative story with full-fleshed complex characters that readers could relate to using their own vivid imaginations.

The special features/discussion of the movie alone is worth the price you pay.

Maybe it made me wistful for my youth (without the vampires of course) but if you're a fan of Twilight, I say no more.  It was great, but bittersweet.

Diplomacy trumps bloody conflict in the final face-to-face encounter between the Cullens and supporters with the vengeful Italian vamp originals. Well, maybe there's a little bit of Hollywood after all. Enjoy!",1394928000,,497,5.552631578947368

4996614,1,B006JM1ZTI,With every other Twilight movie there has been a wonderful collectors addition that gives you a little something extra. I have to say I am far from happy with the last movies offerings. I paid $30 for this particular set and would have been better off paying the $10 for the regular. Didn't even get the poster that is suppose to come with it. Lesson learned only buying instant video from now on.,1394841600,,397,4.4520547945205475

4996628,5,B006JM1ZTI,A great wrap up to all the Twilight movies. Action-packed and very exciting. A very sweet ending that you will find yourself amazed that you are sad to see it all end!,1394150400,,167,4.25
4996629,5,B006JM1ZTI,Movie was exactly what you expect ... Good. I bumped it up to 5 stars for offering Dolby Digital 7.1 HD when so many other releases only give you 5.1. Trust me that's a very big difference. But as for the story (not a spoil alert here) they manage to follow the book and staying true to spathe story while letting us imagine un-comprehendible alternative scenarios which was a entertaining change to say the least.,1394064000,,414,4.533333333333333

4996632,1,B006JM1ZTI,"I don't know why I bothered. I think I just had to see what the end of the train wreck looked like... and holy crap, it was awful. If you're a mom and you want your daughter to have a good teen movie to watch - this is NOT the one. Take her to see the Hunger Games (granted, it's way more violent and has very heavy themes, but that's good; and the main character has a purpose beyond keeping her boyfriend happy and being selfish about everything in her life) or just about ANY OTHER MOVIE EVER.",1393977600,2,496,4.071428571428571

I have to admit there was lots of things I was wondering how they were going to make work. The whole blood sucking thing for instance and the vampires and the sun. It is worth at least watching it once just to say you have seen it even if you don't want to admit it.",1392076800,,432,4.034883720930233
4996663,5,B006JM1ZTI,I was looking forward to this saga ending and they did it with a bang.  I must say Bella was a more convincing vampire than a teenager. She was b/a!,1392076800,,148,3.933333333333333

When I watched it, it had some skips, but I think that is just because of the really old TV I watched it on. No dents or scratches anywhere. Really glad I can have the full Twilight sega now! Plus, At target, its around 21$ where as here I got it for practically a steal! Let alone part 1 was the same price as part 2 at target which would have mean that I would have spent around 40$, but I got part one and part 2 on amazon, with shipping it only added up to 27$ So I saved a bunch of money!
I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars, because while I think it was my TV that caused the skips, I don't quite know for sure.",1391558400,,689,3.693877551020408
4996677,4,B006JM1ZTI,"It was a long haul but I enjoyed every minute of the Twilight Saga. BD Part 2 brought the storyline to an end, albeit a surprising end for someone who did not read the books. I will continue to revisit this story whenever I need a Jacob vs. Edward fix or when I need an escape from reality as these movies help accomplish that very well!",1391558400,,337,4.121212121212121
4996678,2,B006JM1ZTI,"After a slew of epic fails, I finally reach the end of Twilight. This final piece of this true horror story was kind of interesting.

'Breaking Dawn Part 2' actually takes the viewer on a journey into the true world of vampires. Exposing other characters from all over the globe coming together for a war. It was very interesting that each of these vampires are unique with their own special abilities. Also Kristen Stewart must have been waiting for this part of the story since she began this journey, because she actually shows life in her performance as a vampire. The battle sequence is entertaining, but of course I have seen so much better. Also, the story that envelopes Renesmay is also very intriguing but, that is as far as I will go.

As a whole this saga was dreadful. It had no substance, no talent, no nothing. People who say that this is better than Harry Potter need to share what they are smoking with me, because I found no value in this story. The fact that rumors are spreading about a re-creation of this saga just shows that the creators put no effort into making something great out of this story and cared more about how much money they could run away with.

Oh please wondrous Hollywood, I beg of you. Can you please bring vampires back to the way they use to be? I am blinded by all the glitter.

It will not let me chose either one, in fact, it is stuck at this point. I can not go to the menu, I can not play, all I can do is eject.

Where is the acting, the comedic relief or better yet just a simple script. Thank goodness this was only a rental and not a purchase.",1390521600,,285,4.296296296296297

4996749,3,B006JM1ZTI,"I despise this series. I have refused to take my daughter to see it after being forced to sit through the  over dramatic horrific acting and  bastardization of all things vampire  that was the first movie. I do not understand the popularity and likely never will. However, this video gets me out of having to go to the movies and sit through this mess. So I give it 3 stars just for that.

 However, if you like this series, then of course its a movie you will like and you need not log in to tell me how terrible I am for not liking it.

I will say I was a bit shocked at how much more racy this specific one was than the others and I likely would not allow my daughter to watch this one had I known ahead of time and not relied on an Aunt who likes this stuff to say if it was appropriate or not.",1388793600,,798,3.9254658385093166

4996754,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I know in the Twilight world there are only lovers and haters of the series, but either way you look at it, Breaking Dawn Part 2 was a great movie. It sped along at a brisk pace, never slowing down. We finally got to see Bella as a vampire, and this also helped her character evolve more from the awkward, somewhat boring high school girl she was, into a predator ready to do anything to protect her family.

The face off between the Cullens and the Volturi led to a tense and action packed plot twist, and I enjoyed the ""curtain call"" feature in the credits. It was nice to reflect on the actors and characters who made such an impact in peoples lives.",1388707200,,653,4.266129032258065

4996777,4,B006JM1ZTI,One I guess I should read better. Because I swore this said it was a blueray - DVD combo and come to find out it's just blueray. Which is fine. But we can't watch it anywhere we go. It doesn't come with the airstream where you can watch it anywhere you go. Besides that we would've gave it a 5. But since it didn't come with 2 of the features that we thought we were getting have to give it a 4. I guess that's why it was so reasonably priced.,1387843200,,443,3.879120879120879

Though my favorite will always be the first one, I'd probably say this comes in second. It's a great movie and I highly recomend it to anyone who likes Twilight and wishes to see a much deserved happy ending.",1387324800,,450,4.369047619047619

In my opinion, this movie can stand alone, even though all of the other movies provide more background information.  I loved the storyline, the action sequences, and especially how nicely this movie completed the series.  I have to wonder if there will be a ""Jacob and Renessme (sp)"" spinoff.",1387324800,,386,4.818181818181818

4996804,2,B006JM1ZTI,"Wow. If you've committed yourself to reading all the books and seeing all the movies, it's at least worth your while to finish that dubious goal. However, this movie is not very good. The CG baby/child is creepy. The acting is mediocre, the whole non-existent fight scene is a ridiculous departure from the book (which might be necessary, considering how action-empty the book actually was). It's not worth watching if you have no pre-existing investment in the franchise.",1386547200,,472,5.064102564102564

4996813,5,B006JM1ZTI,"Love this movie!  A must have for the Twilight fan! The final chapter in the epic saga doesn't leave fans of the book disappointed! There's a twist in in the final fight scene that's not in the book that they did an amazing job on!  I was wondering how they were going to give it the Hollywood type ending because the book fight scene, although it was perfect drama for the book, could not be captured well in a movie.  They also did a phenomenal job with the ending!

Also, definitely consider buying the the Blu-ray, Digital, and DVD combo pack.  I use the digital copies on my iPad, loan the DVDs to friends when they want to watch it, and use the Blu-rays for myself.",1386201600,,671,4.2936507936507935

4996821,2,B006JM1ZTI,"Breaking Dawn Part two is the second installment of the last book of the Twilight series, and is probably the best of all of the Twilight movies. I would still give the movie a 3 on a 1 to 10 scale. I know that there are a lot of people that love to bag on this film for many valid reasons ranging from the acting, to the plot, to the character development. Although I agree with all of those sentiments, there is one element of the films that if a few changes would have been made, the whole series would have been much better and could have transformed this franchise is into something respectable to people other than teens and lonely middle aged women. My biggest problem with the film is the lack of development and sacrifice by the main female character Bella Swan.
Again I am going to try and stay away from critiquing the acting in this film because I think as awful as it was there is a much bigger perpetrator here that ruined the series. It was the story of Bella. I focused on the last movie because this is the one when all the questions are answered, all loose ends are neatly tied up and all conflict is resolved. Yet in the end, after five movies and four books Bella has not grown or sacrificed as a character, not even once. She literally gets everything she wants in life without having to sacrifice one thing, all by the age of 18. She wanted to become a vampire for several years but Edward would not let her because of the great sacrifice she would have had to make, that all vampires have to make in loosing every single person they knew before...nope not Bella. She gets to be a vampire and keep the relationship with her family. Speaking of family, one of the things that pains a secondary character in the film is that she can never have children, just like ALL vampires, again not Bella. She gets to have child, a child who is perfect, grows up insanely fast, and yet stops growing when she reaches adulthood. She gets the joy of raising a child but without the 18 year struggle. How much richer would the story have been if the child aged quickly into adulthood then old age and death? Not only does she get to keep her family, and have a child, she gets to keep both men in her life that she loves. She is not even forced to choose for love, the thing she is souly powered by. She gets to live her dream life without ever having to struggle, work, go to school, or even worry about bills! Even the part about being a vampire that sucks the most, changing from being a human was easy for her compared to everyone else. Most vampires that change in this series talk about how painful it was, how confusing, how they couldn't control their thirst for blood or their powers. Again Bella wakes up from her coma like state and barley struggles with any of these things. Any struggle she could possibly have to face in life is diminished by Stephanie Meyers inability to write. The one part of the movie that was outstanding was the fight scene. All the characters battled literally, to the death to defend their family. Big important characters where killed, even Bella got up and fought and was powerful for once. It was by far the best 10 min of the entire movie series and shocker, it was not written by Stephanie Mayer. It was written by a 3rd party, and it was so good, because there was loss and suspense. It was the good writing the movie desperately needed. Thenit was all a vision. Awful, just awful. If you're a big fan you will enjoy this film because even with the sub-par plot and acting, out of all the films this one is defiantly the best. Its too bad the person that wrote the fight scene did not write the entire series.",1385856000,2,3660,4.336734693877551

Please Bella just die already or get laid . Maybe you'll show some emotion . Oh wait! She does . Nope she still as boring as her cold blood . Maybe the kid will make it interesting on the next one . Not looking forward to it . I rather vampire of underworld . They have more class more ambition . These vamps don't do nothing all day but obsess over cold boring Bella .

She is not an actress in any sense of the word and her male lead Robert Pattinson is even worse. But the story is a good one and the rest of the cast supports the film well enough to allow the two leads to pull it all off.

4996852,5,B006JM1ZTI,The movie was exciting at the end and when I first saw it there were many surprises.  I think this movie is the best of the five.,1384387200,,129,3.7777777777777777
4996853,2,B006JM1ZTI,"I came into this movie cold.  It was on a movie channel and knowing about the Twilight phenomenon, I thought ""what the heck?""  I was confused, creeped out, and bored at the same time.  The movie relies on having faithful knowledge of the series already.  I'm a firm believer that even movies based on books should stand on their own logic and plot without insider knowledge. Anyways..spoilers...

New Vampire Bella and Edward have a baby girl Renesme who is gifted with the ability to see memories? (not really explained).  She has been IMPRINTED on by 18 year old Jacob who will be ""whatever she needed.""  I don't think they meant this in a ""godfatherly...take her fishing..."" way but as a ""they will be a couple...and have sex.""  Whoa..she has no choice?  She's basically  a child bride to her Mom's hanger-on as a newborn.  What? She grows very quickly.  They never explain the timeline.  Has 2 years lapsed? 1 year? But Renesme looks about 5.  So the Volturi, an ancient powerful ruling sect of vampires, think she's a child-made vampire...a big no-no.  The Cullens recruit support from vampires around the world... a big non-fight ensues and everyone lives forever after.

It's a good movie to sit on a cold night and riff with your friends...but not really made for non-Twihards.",1384387200,,1285,4.799086757990867

4996855,1,B006JM1ZTI,"Honestly, as someone who was a fan of all the books and the first few movies, this movie was absolutely terrible. This is coming from someone who is easily entertained and usually enjoys cheesy romance movies!",1384300800,,209,4.833333333333333
4996856,5,B006JM1ZTI,"...or did Lee Pace steal every scene in which he appeared?  I was thrilled beyond measure to realize he was in this movie as I have so enjoyed him in other things, notably Pushing Daisies and Wonderfalls.  Either they gave him the funniest lines, or he just delivered them the most memorably for me.

There are so many things I loved about this movie, especially the surprise the twist at the end (I can imagine the *gasp* THAT must have induced at the first screenings!), and  the many brilliant special effects such as aging  Renesmee so believably from babyhood to adulthood, and the brilliant battle scenes which took a full year to complete.

The cast was an absolute delight (did I mention Lee Pace?) and I believe most of the original cast has  actually upped their game from one film to the next.  The soundtrack was  truly splendid (shout out to Paul McDonald who has a track on there with his wife Nikki, who played Rosalie in the series.  Loved him on his American Idol  season).

I rarely listen to film commentary, but I did this time and found that there were nuances I had missed while watching the movie, that enhanced the whole experience for me.  All in all, a beautiful effort from these talented film makers and I'm very glad to have purchased the whole set.  I am sure I will watch BD2 multiple times, as I have the others.",1384300800,,1344,4.5

The story, the actors, and the great production of these movies was a must have for my library.

I'll say out of all the movies that has bee made so far for the saga, the last 3 movies are more true to the book than the first 2, likely for the more involvement of the author in it and the great directing work",1383350400,,326,4.109375

Is it a good story I don't know because really really isn't Jake a firefighter and Edward like a lawyer so Stephanie Meyers was in some love triangle and wrote this book about it changing the names and then of course she says "" I was born to be a vampire "" really ? are you sure because leaches don't have legs but lawyers do.

I saw this about a month ago, I can't really remember much about it, there was a twist that was funny with Voltori and of course you knew whether your read the books or not, nothing would happen to the Cullens, etc, but the daugther Renesemee, could not look more like a digital doll, it was so fake. Wow! They need update the graphics.. oh know it is all coming back to me..still will not watch it again. Glad it is over. Twillight has a lot of damaging undertones to it, that are subliminal, I know it is fantasy but still...",1380153600,,586,4.1946902654867255

4996937,5,B006JM1ZTI,I ENJOYED ALL THE MOVIES.  THE LITTLE GIRL AT THE END WAS A GOOD ACTRESS BUT SHE OBVIOUSLY HAD A WIG ON THAT WAS TOO BIG.,1380067200,,121,3.6538461538461537

4996942,4,B006JM1ZTI,I liked it. Breaking Dawn was my first Twilight movie. Just felt there wasn't much of a story to break it up into two parts. Felt it would have been more powerful and intense in one movie.,1379808000,,188,4.108108108108108
4996943,5,B006JM1ZTI,"Purchased this movie locally, it was everything I expected, I loved the movie just as I have loved the whole series. The storyline is one I fell in love with right off the bat, as I am a romantic type soul anyway being a Leo the Lion. I love the characters in all the the movies, and this one was especially great having purchased Breaking Dawn One some time ago I couldn't wait to see this one, although it was bitter sweet as it was the last of the series. I wish it could have kept going forever, but all good things must eventually come to an end, and they did a wonderful job on this final part of the story. ""I loved kick ass Bella in this one."" I liked her more as a Vampire then as before, as it seemed she was always the poor helpless Bella in the others, but this one she finally gets to kick some serious butt! I will cherish this series forever!! Being a fiction writer and a huge fiction fan. Please pick up your copy today, it is well worth it for all you Twilight fans like me out there!

I was afraid they had made too many changes when I saw the previews of the battle, but after seeing the movie I was so delighted with action that I was glad they used the battle scene.  All of it was wonderful.  The only thing I would love to have in the Breaking Dawn Part 2 movie is about 5 to 10 minutes from the end of Breaking Dawn Part 1...just to set the scene for all the excitment that was coming.",1379635200,,456,3.9347826086956523

Well, I was so wrong.  It's one of the best series and certainly most interesting story line I have experienced so far.  The movies and the books run very alike - I read and watched the entire series.  I am so glad I did.  I couldn't seem to get enough of the story and very much wish there was more...",1379203200,,463,4.215909090909091
4996962,3,B006JM1ZTI,I thought the movie was rushed in what appeared to be an attempt to condense as much from the book as possible. They should have put a little more in part 1 and elaborated on the training that took place more in the book. They showed very little of that. Kristen Stewart's acting was also really underwhelming.,1379203200,2,310,4.456140350877193

OK OK....so yea Kristen Stewart is the WORST actress of this generation, but if you read the books it is nice to see the whole story wrap up.  The cg was not so good - I mean cant you just get a baby that looks a little like Edward and Bella?  No need to cg that little girls face on a baby - that was dumb.  Other than that - and the fact that they ripped off Carlile's head in the battle scene (that was reminiscent of a Dallas scene where Bobby was supposed to be dead but wound up in the shower the next day) (ok so this shows my age) but really - an ok movie.  If you liked the books and feel the need to have a great drinking game with the movies...get the whole series.  its a fun game night!!!",1378857600,,801,3.9440993788819876

I own all 5 (?) of them now.  I also have the books (Twilight),  as well as the digital copies (e-books) and I'm not a kid...I am well into my 50's and LOVED it!  I think it was enjoyable for any age.  My husband & I as well as my daughter & her husband all watched it together!  This one kept you on the edge of your seats!

The DVD came very quickly, it seemed to  arrive in only a few days...(2 or 3 I believe...)  The packaging was protective and well packaged as I also expected it would be.  I have been very pleased with Amazon.com for approx. 99.5% of all that I have ordered, since purchasing products at Amazon.com.  I also have ""PRIME"" which is also offers good incentives if you do order fairly frequently from Amazon...(Otherwise you'll end up spending MORE on the shipping !)

I'll be honest...if Amazon isn't  competitive enough for me (price-wise) and someone else offers a  better price with the S&H...then I will stray occasionally, for the better deal!  BUT...Great overall!",1377129600,,1088,4.396984924623116

4997039,5,B006JM1ZTI,"When the Twilight books came out and became a phenomenon I avoided them like the black death.

When the movies came out I actively avoided watching them.

A couple of weeks ago that all changed when my family got cable and I got stuck watching The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 with my nephew.  I was shocked at how much I enjoyed the movie and ended up going to my brother's house to watch the previous movies in a fun little marathon.  Once I was caught up I rented The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 from Amazon and I felt it was a sweet conclusion to the series.

Now I have to actually read the books and eat some major crow since I've loudly told my friends I would never, ever, read Twilight anything.",1376697600,,719,4.257352941176471

4997046,5,B006JM1ZTI,"My 13 year old grand daughter got me hooked on ""Twilight!"" I have all five movies. This finale ""Breaking Dawn 2"" was just fantastic. It was a great way to finalize everything that went on between the main three characters. I had sooo many favorites through out this saga. I read some reviews on the novel series and some weren't so good. But I think what some people fail to realize is, this is a fantasy created by the author's imagination. Being a fiction writer myself, I understand the concepts of fiction. The author creates a fictitious plot and make it. . . BELIEVABLE!! I didn't read the novels and novels are always claimed as being better than the, ""MOVIE."" I feel the movies were excellent. Each series took us deeper into the relationship between the three, and what each character's world entailed. One a human, one a vampire, and the other a werewolf.  I mean, even-though some felt the novels wasn't realistic, for me the movies were believable. I could relate to Bella because I already know what it's like as a human. Therefore, if had I met a vampire that could put me on his back, climb and fly me to the highest tree branch, and didn't have to worry about falling, oh yeah! Not to mention being able to view all of God's beautiful creations, then take me there! Or to have a huge werewolf protect me and when he was in human form looked as sweet as Jacob did, then he would be my BFF too! I wouldn't mind not having to eat, sleep, or being pale, and cold, if I could live in that house with the Cullen's. . . I know, but I'm just saying. You have to admit, that house in the woods was simply gorgeous. I loved Bella's Dad, he was just too cool. When writing a novel, sometimes the writer can't or shouldn't write and tell all. Sometimes we have to let the reader or viewer figure somethings out. For instance, in BD Part 2. . . When Bella decided to see Charlie, I noticed something. When he was hugging his daughter, he had this look on his face as to say. . . ""Why is she so cold?"" Along with a small gesture.  However, he didn't mention her being cold except by his expression. I don't know if anyone else noticed that but I did. And I think other's did too if they were paying close attention. I feel the same when Leah died helping Esme in the make believe fight. We know that in BD part one, Esme offered Leah a sandwich, but the wolf girl declined. She didn't care for the Cullens. I could see the disappointment in Esme's eyes. Yet, in the fight, Leah gave her life to help Esme. No words to say, ""I'm so sorry about the way I treated you."" Only a gesture. The same goes along with reading a novel. We have to pay attention to what we read and sometimes have an open heart. Last but not, least I feel the author used a formula that we all need whether fiction or reality. . . She wrote about three people being in love and all of the mentionable. The supporting cast all had someone to fight for and in the end, love conquered all. . . I really loved the way the fight went down because I was salty when some of the vamps and wolves went down. So, in conclusion, I think all five movies were a smash hit and now I can look at them whenever the. . . FEVER SETS IN!!!!",1376438400,,3194,4.217320261437909
4997047,5,B006JM1ZTI,"Ok ok...so I'm a closet Twilight Saga watcher. Oh God I feel so ashamed! lol This last installment of the trilogy was most certainly it's finest. It was well thought out and presented surprisingly well. Like the actors/character development grew, so too did the plot and story line.

The only down side is that we will never get a fully realized finished product with the newest character in the story, Ezmay. That would be worth one last movie imo...especially if it meant taking down that council!

4997058,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I enjoyed this movie better than the others because Bella's character was more believable.

Part 2, does a great job of pulling at your heart strings, and never letting go. This is why I watched the movie, this is why I enjoyed it.

All the little tid bits that a lot of people seem to like to poke at it are meaningless, If you want a fantasy styled-young adult-love story, This is what you will find.",1376092800,,482,3.9587628865979383

That goes without saying that this movie was a huge disappointment. The events, scenes, and display of the entire movie were awful and didn't correspond with the book in the least. Even if I hadn't read the book first I'm sure I wouldn't have liked this movie. It went through events too fast. It was as if someone had piled a big mound of nonsense into a movie.

No, I am not a fan of Twilight. I read the first book, watched the first movie, loved it. Began the second book, watched the second movie, closed the second book and never opened it again. Baywatch for twelve-year-old girls was a bit too much for this 36-year-old. That said, I am so happy to own this movie. I went to the theater and shelled out big money to see this conclusion and I was not in any way disappointed. This movie, in itself, is a great stand-alone movie.

4997144,2,B006JM1ZTI,"My mother and I are true Twi-hards, so this rating is nothing against the film.  Rather it is about the Ultraviolet format that this Blu-ray and many other current films feature standard on their Blu-ray editions.  I gifted this to my mother for her birthday who has a Sony Blu-ray player, a few years old.  It plays standard DVDs and Blu-rays without any problem.  However with Ultraviolet it would say there was an error.  In one case I was able to keep restarting the player until it played my UV Hunger Games copy.  However for Breaking Dawn it would not.  I looked it up online and it seems that it the player may need to have a firmware update, which will require me to hook it up to the internet etc blah blah blah.  Tough to do since it is at my  mother's house.  So my mother ended up renting the movie from her cable company and is awaiting me to come fix her tech.

My only issue if that's the right word is the digital effects on baby Renesmee looked a bit too cartoony, but the movie as a whole was romantic, & cool pretty much what you expect to see with this movie series & finally seeing Bella as a fully realized Vampire with awesome powers made it extra fun though there were some sad touching moments as well

Blu-ray picture quality good, but not amazing & Blu-ray extra's include audio commentary from the director & a behind the scenes look at making the film, there may be other extra's but I'm not sure if I viewed them all yet so I'll have to update this review at a later time, but I hope this review helped a little.",1373414400,2,717,4.343283582089552

4997200,5,B006JM1ZTI,I am thrilled with the dvd and have enjoyed the entire series...wish it would continue-there is definitely a possible storyline,1372550400,,127,5.4
4997201,2,B006JM1ZTI,"Very boring.  If you like a ""feel good"" Vampire movie that violates all the Vampire rules you'll enjoy this one.  A story needs conflict.  It is non existent. Oh there is a big confrontation but then you find out it was only the example of a big fight and they chickened out.  I wish they had all fell down the crack in the earth that opened up in the middle of the Non existent battle.  Don't bother unless you have your insulin ready for the sugar overload from the good will and happy spirits that abound.",1372550400,,508,4.25

I'd recommend it to anyone who likes the series. As with the other Twilight films, there are substantial differences to the books.",1372550400,,261,4.574468085106383
4997207,1,B006JM1ZTI,I read all the books. Movie leaves much to be desired. Don't waste your time or your money on this lame film.,1372464000,,109,4.0

4997209,3,B006JM1ZTI,"Yes, I am one of those people who likes the books much better than the movies.  I don't know, the movies just seem kind of flat.  I do love that Lautner boy, but that is about it.  Fun, entertaining story though.",1372377600,,212,4.121951219512195
4997210,5,B006JM1ZTI,"This was great, and true to the books.  The author of the Twilight series kept true to her books, and fans, not allowing her fabulous books be turned into trash when made into movies.  I admire her so much for that alone.",1372377600,,221,4.238095238095238
4997211,4,B006JM1ZTI,The recipient of the gift was very excited as he's a big fan of the books and movies.  I think I got a great deal and a very happy grandson.,1372377600,,140,3.6666666666666665
4997212,5,B006JM1ZTI,Having read the books I felt the movie did a good job following the storyline and kept in important details.,1372377600,,108,4.45

4997221,5,B006JM1ZTI,I was a fan of the book series from the start.  The movies brought the books to life.  Loved the beautiful CG baby.,1372118400,,115,3.9565217391304346
4997222,2,B006JM1ZTI,This felt to squished in terms of what the book was trying to convey. Too rushed through the scenes with little that felt like it was accurate to the book itself.  Eclipse was the closest without getting lost in artistic interpretation.  This did not have the closeness and so much of what the the book good was lost.  The acting did tip off anything that the characters were going through.  So many small points that would have tied this movie together.,1372118400,,454,4.567901234567901
4997223,1,B006JM1ZTI,"This was the absolute worst of the Twilight films. The acting was wooden. It went on too long. The scenery was the best thing about it. Truly, when it was over, all I could think was that was a huge waste of time I will never get back.",1372032000,2,235,3.9166666666666665
4997224,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I am a fan of the series so this being the last movie, I cherish it.  It is a movie so there is really nothing to be said about the packaging.  The movie is beautifully shot, the plot is very close to the book and the ending is an ode to the entire series and the actors who brought Mrs. Meyer's characters to life.  Great ending to a wonderful story.",1372032000,,351,3.9857142857142858

4997231,5,B006JM1ZTI,I could watch this movie over and over they just keep getting better I wish the story would keep going,1371945600,,102,4.15
4997232,5,B006JM1ZTI,finally a part of the movie with some action which is not as much focused on the relationship. this is one of the better ones,1371945600,,125,4.04
4997233,4,B006JM1ZTI,"Liked the twist at the end. Seems like they leave it open for future prospects. The streaming worked wonderful, nice clear picture.",1371945600,,131,5.0
4997234,1,B006JM1ZTI,I had missed the last one thankfully but my stupid curiosity eventually got the better of me until I finally watched the darn thing. Big mistake don't bother it sucks the only good part was the fight scene and spoiler alert it was godd*** dream. Head my warning don't bother.,1371945600,,275,4.52
4997235,5,B006JM1ZTI,"Movie is great, enjoyed finally getting to see the end of the last book. Don't waste your time and money pre- ordering movies from Amazon though. Unless you upgrade the shipping you won't get the movie for 5-7 days AFTER its release. I also could have gotten an equal or better price locally.",1371859200,,292,4.528301886792453

4997239,5,B006JM1ZTI,Downloaded to watch on my Kindle during an international flight. Excellent picture and sound and I loved it on the Kindle.,1371772800,,122,4.857142857142857

4997243,2,B006JM1ZTI,"This was a bland and boring movie. It was filled with long lingering glances between Bella and Edward, and understanding smiles and nods from the other vampires. This has got to be one of the boringest vampire movies I've ever seen. Even the Volturi and heads being torn off failed to make the movie any more exciting or lively. It was just long, drawn out, and so dull. At least the series is finished.",1371686400,,403,4.45945945945946
4997244,4,B006JM1ZTI,"Pretty much sums up why I watched the final one.. I had watched the others and thought, ""What the heck? Why not finish the last one."" Not as good as I thought it would be, but still enjoyed it.",1371686400,,193,3.9743589743589745
4997245,4,B006JM1ZTI,"The item arrived earlier then expected which is always nice. The packaging was perfect as were both discs and the case. I think this is a bargain as you get three versions. A normal dvd disc drive, a digital to put on any computer or tablets, and last but not least the ultraviolet version which allows you to store it in the cloud. This allows you access to it from any where as long as there is internet. If I needed another I would definitely get this exact item again.",1371686400,,472,4.2555555555555555
4997246,4,B006JM1ZTI,"The actors were good as always and the film was excellent overall.  However, after reading the book, there were several small things that occurred that would have carried the story much better.  If you haven't already, read the books!

Of course the final scene where Bella finally lets Edward see things....lovely...cry every time :) I bought a used copy and I wish I would have saved up for a new one so I could have the behind the scenes stuff.

4997289,5,B006JM1ZTI,I have seen all of the twilight movies and i'm going to say that this is by far the best one. Kirsten did such a better job in this one than she did in the first one. I was surprised she put a lot of heart into this last movie. I like her better as a vampire. and like all the rest of the cast did a great job. I think mackinze foy will be a great upcoming actress she did a wonderful job at her role as resnemee. just to let everyone know that the ending is not what you expect I was surprised at it myself. I was glad and disappointed about what happened(people who have seen this movie you know what i'm talking about) I don't want to say much cause I don't want to spoil the film. I thought that all the twilights were good and to be honest this may be the best but new moon is my favorite. now that I've seen all the movies now I have to read the books. well hate to see it go but all good things come to an end. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do,1370908800,2,973,3.7745098039215685

This one starts with Bella as a newborn vampire meeting Renesmee and discovering Jacob has imprinted. Renesmee grows at phenomenal speed and the Volturi are alerted to her existence, so a major confrontation is foreseen by Alice. This final chapter brings in a whole bunch of actors as supporting vampires. Robert Pattinson occasionally manages a real smile; Renesmee just looks vaguely creepy; Dakota Fanning as Jane has lost her impact somewhat; Taylor Lautner is still beautiful to look at. The ending is rather an anti-climax and with the songs becomes far too soppy.",1370649600,,704,4.92436974789916

Closure is sometimes hard with a series like this, having been over years time. Breaking Dawn Part 2 made me feel okay that it was the end. We know it can't go on forever. I felt happy at the end. The fight sequence (which I'll not detail if you haven't watched) was so clever. I was glued to the screen, eyes filled with tears -- which surprised myself.

I am referring to gather all of their allies, it basically commits the writing sin of adding a ton of new characters right before the end. Were these thrown into make it a better effects movie, or to have more characters for follow on books or spinoffs?

I'm not certain, but they all felt tacked on. The witnesses were fine, just the extra special characters seem forced.

I really liked the very end, its been a trend since the ancient greeks that people who can see the furture are powerless to change it, I really like how that really old story cliche gets subverted here.",1370563200,2,716,4.335820895522388

4997314,4,B006JM1ZTI,I have to confess to liking the Twilight books and movies - essentially they are a romance with a twist. I can understand how it would have been hard to turn the last section of Breaking Dawn into a movie since much of the book action was mind power as opposed to physical conflict - hard to translate that into a movie - they did an OK job and it held my attention.  I think they could have made Breaking Dawn parts 1 and 2 the same movie - this one was actually fairly short,1370476800,,476,4.010526315789473

the fighting scenes were not in the book, they were introduced for commercial/marketing purposes, and although they ""fix it"" so it wouldn't change the movie, i still don't like it.  Acting: fair to poor as always. The baby.... so fake... too obvious that it was a computer generated baby. Otherwise... it is okay to spend your time if you don't have anything else to do.",1369958400,,506,4.622222222222222

4997354,5,B006JM1ZTI,I love this just like and the other four movies. The only sad part you knew this was the end. I think Stephanie hit a gold mind with her dream. I'm just so grateful she shared with us. Her choice for  Edward and Kristin was right on! I know everyone has really  given Kristin a hard time  just get over it she's just a young girl and will make some bad judgements but so does everyone else. Just look at your like before you are so quick yo judge. Love the whole cast of Twilight and appreciate the joy you brought into my life with first the books  Thank you Stephanie Myers and then the movies.,1369872000,,596,4.112068965517241
4997355,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I'm a guy and I'll admit, these movies are pretty good.  I never read the books, but my wife made me watch the first one and I was hooked",1369785600,,137,3.7241379310344827
4997356,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I finally got to see that Kristin stewart can act/ who knew? Has some unexpected humor in just the right places. best battle scene at the end. I loved it and absolutely adore Mackenzie. She is terrific and plays Renesmee exactly right. Kudos to the casting dept. She looks like a perfect combo of both Edward and Bella, as a child and an adult. great movie!!",1369785600,,358,4.4393939393939394
4997357,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I'm 66 years old, so the Twilight Saga is not just for the teens. I read all the books and adding a little more of the back and forth between Jacob and Rosalie would have been awesome for the movies. As the movies followed the books closely, they were very well adapted to the screen. Bella's wedding dress was perfection. Those are the kind of stories you don't want to see end.",1369785600,,379,4.277777777777778
4997358,4,B006JM1ZTI,"Read all the books so had to see all the movies, kinda glad i waited until they were out before seeing the last 3. It was good but all the hype about the actors ruined the going to movies experience for me. Not my favorite book to movie series but will watch them again.",1369785600,,270,4.018518518518518
4997359,3,B006JM1ZTI,There were parts of this movie that I enjoyed and some that I didn't.  If you have followed the movies all along you will want to see this last chapter otherwise don't bother.,1369785600,,175,4.303030303030303
4997360,4,B006JM1ZTI,"I loved the Twilight Series, although I really liked the 3rd movie the best. I guess the fact that Stephanie got a little bit away from the last book bothered me.  But, it was good and ended like the book, just a few in-between additions.  After watching it for the 3rd time, I'm happier with it.  Definitely buy it.  You won't regret it.",1369785600,,338,4.317460317460317

4997363,1,B006JM1ZTI,Kristen Stuart has one character in her entire acting collection and its Bella. She has no depth and about 3 expressions. This is material for tweens and teen girls who who be better served by watching something that was actually creative rather than so manufactured. Ug! The things we let our daughters watch. Please shoot me now.,1369699200,3,331,4.824561403508772

4997369,4,B006JM1ZTI,"Almost as good as the first movie, and that's hard to do once they've set such a high bar on the first.  Why?  The sheer number of upside surprises in the firsat movie of plot quality, with acting to match.  Of course, in this trilogy closer there is the maturation of their interactions within the characters and as actors, and a nice twist to the final ""battle"".",1369699200,,364,4.402985074626866

4997388,4,B006JM1ZTI,"I ordered this movie for my wife because she wanted to watch it and in the end I enjoyed it better than I thought I would.  My wife has read all of the books and said this is one of the rare times that the movies were better than the books.

There was a lot more action than I would have expected and I did enjoy the Epic Good Vamps & Wolfs vs Bad Vamps, though in the end there is a plot twist that I didn't expect and I won't post the twist here so that I don't spoil it for anyone who may not have already seen the movie.",1369440000,,524,3.7117117117117115
4997389,2,B006JM1ZTI,Bad acting. Story line is incredibly fractured. If you like pouting and whining...this is the movie for you! If you like plot and action...pick something else.,1369440000,,159,5.153846153846154

4997396,5,B006JM1ZTI,I believe they have kept the storyline true to the book except for the ending that doesn't happen!  It was great and everybody gasped in the audience when it happened but applauded when you realized it was only in their minds.  I enjoyed all of the Twilight movies but this is my favorite one.,1369353600,,293,4.407407407407407

4997402,5,B006JM1ZTI,I love Twilight (not more than Harry Potter) but I really thought this movie was going to be really good and well... lets just say some parts were. I know movies never really stay true to the book but I wish this one did. I wanted to see more action but the best action was the fight scene. I also do not like the fact when they are running through the woods when she first becomes a Vampire you can tell its all edited and done on a green screen. For a movie that has done so many and how great the wolves and stuff have looked I thought this would be done a lot better than what it was.,1369267200,,588,3.908333333333333
4997403,3,B006JM1ZTI,"This was a nice way to end the saga, but honestly I thought there would be more content in it.  This movie has a circular plot that almost ends in the same place it started.",1369180800,,173,3.942857142857143

4997406,5,B006JM1ZTI,"Let's face it...if you're not a Twilight fan, you don't get what all the fuss is about, and I understand that.  From a cinematic standpoint are these the best made movies ever - no.  But if you're a fan, you appreciate seeing the story you fell in love with depicted visually.  I also appreciate that the quality of the movies has improved over the series, with the final installments, BD 1&2 being the best of the bunch.  It's always fun to check out the extra features on the DVD versions too.",1369180800,,495,4.406593406593407

4997410,5,B006JM1ZTI,"This last movie in the Twilight saga does not disappoint. At last a vampire, Bella revels in the start of her new life. All is not perfect though as a new danger asserts itself on the Cullens and Edward and Bella's child. New faces from foreign places as well as old ones from before round out this last Twilight film. You'll watch it over and over again.",1369094400,,355,4.313432835820896

I watched it and immediately fell in love. I had to purchase all of the movies. This really is quite the love story. It is not extremely gory and bloody as other vampire movies can be and I just love the characters. I may even read the books lol. If you have never watched a Twilight movie you should start from the start.

4997416,5,B006JM1ZTI,This movie was  great ending to the Twilight series although I hated to see it be finished.  The second part was definitely better than part 1,1369008000,,142,4.423076923076923
4997417,5,B006JM1ZTI,That was a really great movie! A little more than what I expected! I was curious how they were going to play out since it was the last Twilight movie.

If you were disappointed by all the others - as I was - go ahead and give this a shot to wrap up the series with a little redemption. KS is still perhaps the least talented actress of her generation; so don't expect anything more.",1368921600,,485,4.34065934065934

4997431,5,B006JM1ZTI,Love it!  I'm a big fan of Twilight and think this is the best movie ever!  I own all of the movies!,1368835200,,100,3.5
4997432,4,B006JM1ZTI,Good move to rent similar to the book. Just do not forget the popcorn and the blanket on the couch,1368748800,,98,3.95
4997433,5,B006JM1ZTI,"Ending with a twist.  hate to see it end.
the story line was pretty good though.  Hopefully they decide to make more.",1368748800,,117,4.2727272727272725
4997434,5,B006JM1ZTI,"Great movie, like that I can watch it any time any where. Very easy to use. Thank you very much",1368748800,,95,3.8
4997435,4,B006JM1ZTI,The final book comes to a close in this epic finale.  Action and intrigue portrayed through forbidden love blossomed.  Plus the costumes and cinematography are great.,1368748800,,166,5.346153846153846
4997436,5,B006JM1ZTI,"Enjoyed it at the movies and also at home!  Ending fight scene is amazing, even when you know the outcome.  Could see it again.",1368748800,,127,4.25
4997437,5,B006JM1ZTI,"my family and I love this movie is super good good, I recommend that if you have not seen, have a chance to see it, they will not regret it I assure,",1368748800,,149,3.6875
4997438,5,B006JM1ZTI,"The e move was so close and keeping pertinent detail in, it was great to see the characters in this book come to life. The plot twist was great (I won't spoil it for you)  A great addition to your Twilight library.",1368748800,,214,4.095238095238095
4997439,5,B006JM1ZTI,I feel for everyone that has been forced to watch this movie by a loved one.  But the good news it finally is worth all the investment with this final movie.  Bella finally shows some teeth and acts with vindication.  There is an epic fight that truly is entertaining for any fan of monsters and super heroes.  Anyways I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie after how much I hated just hated Breaking Dawn Part 1.,1368748800,,430,4.3375
4997440,5,B006JM1ZTI,"Others have covered the details of this movie so there is no point in me going there, I have yet to read the books (although i have been reading Midnight Sun online).  First let me say i got suckered into Renting the first twilight movie and yes i thought it was a little silly but the story line hooked me, So i continued watching these movies with my wife. (P.S. IM 37)  WITH THAT SAID, Breaking Dawn part two was a very good movie, i admit that i thought it got a little dry in the middle while they were looking for there witnesses and the fact that Bella was so controlled as a newborn seemed kinda fake,  I wish they would have made it longer and got more into the back stories of the new characters more.  Honestly i think my favorite part of this last movie though is the extra's the making of the movie, Its a real treat !  Im disapointed that this is where the story has stopped, i want to see how things go on with bella. Obviously they cant stay in Forks very long as people would not understand why the family including bella are not aging, Id like to see How things play out with Jacob and Renesme, i think another story or even a few more stories are in order to help us along.  if the Fast and the Furious can come back with a 6th movie why cant Twilight :) ?  Oh obviously Aro would be intrested in Alice and Bella's Skills.. this would be another excellent plot point.. or what about Charlie figuring out whats happend to Bella aand the Vult finding out and then there after bella for being exposed ??  I can think of alot of ways this saga could continue and go on..  There's been enuff money made that surely they can see the fans want more..  I think they would be foolish to stop here.
Breaking dawn part 2 wrapped things up pretty nice for now, i have enjoyed these movies and am glad i got suckered into watching the first one.  Im plannig to get my hands on these books and give them a go.",1368662400,,1914,4.145945945945946
4997441,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I love Renesmee! She is so beautiful! This movie is just like the book, which I love! I love the wolves!! Go Bella with your shielding!",1368662400,,135,4.230769230769231
4997442,5,B006JM1ZTI,IF you are a Twilight fan this is a must have. It ends the saga as the books have been written but opens up the what happens next questions. Very well done and a keeper.,1368662400,,169,3.857142857142857
4997443,4,B006JM1ZTI,"I prefer the books to the movies since they've left out quite a bit of detail but for what they pulled off, it did keep me interested and on my toes.",1368662400,,149,3.838709677419355
4997444,3,B006JM1ZTI,"I have watched all of these with my niece.  This was the best one IMHO, maybe because it's over now.
Had a little more action.",1368662400,,126,4.04
4997445,2,B006JM1ZTI,"I am a fan of the books, only reason it got 2 stars.  The directing, acting, casting and just about everything about the movies was completely horrible.  They all seemed like budget films with budget actors and were made for tweens.",1368662400,,232,4.634146341463414
4997446,5,B006JM1ZTI,"Depending upon your TV and Blue Ray player you get the image quality but yes, there is a difference between plain DVD and Blue Ray. Very pleased.",1368576000,,145,4.407407407407407
4997447,5,B006JM1ZTI,This Amazing Movie is action packed romantic and dramatic all in one and it was great for the whole family.,1368576000,,107,4.4
4997448,5,B006JM1ZTI,this is one of my all time favorite movie series you have to see all the movies to appreciate this one,1368576000,,102,3.9047619047619047
4997449,5,B006JM1ZTI,"Coming from a guys perspective, I felt like this one had a lot more action and fight scenes, which every guy likes right? Don't get me wrong, I don't mind a little bit of romance mixed in, but I felt the balance of action to mushy was good on this final take.",1368576000,,259,4.0
4997450,5,B006JM1ZTI,"Read the books, had to have the movies. Great mailing and geting to us. Thanks for being fast we were waithing for it to come",1368576000,,125,4.04
4997451,5,B006JM1ZTI,This movie was the perfect ending to a great spellbinding saga. I would highly reccommend for almost any age group,1368576000,,114,4.75
4997452,5,B006JM1ZTI,My wife kept trying to get me to watch it but I kept saying I wasn't interested. Was bored one night and gave in. I have to say she was right. I had grown tired of the other installments about who loves who the most. This one had great fight scenes and some pretty cool effects.,1368576000,,278,3.982142857142857
4997453,5,B006JM1ZTI,The last one of the series was a great movie but not as great as the other 4...but is still worth seeing.,1368576000,,105,3.8181818181818183
4997454,1,B006JM1ZTI,"giving this a 1 because i simply do not like this series and the fanfare it has caused...my wife rented this, not me...no really!  i swear!",1368576000,,139,4.346153846153846
4997455,5,B006JM1ZTI,I do not normally like this genre but I we had Twilight free on HBO and watched it. We liked it enough to want to watch the rest however the Breaking Dawn movies I liked so much I decided to buy. They are in my group of favorite movies.,1368576000,,236,3.836734693877551
4997456,4,B006JM1ZTI,It was entertaining and has the action that is lacked in the book. Nice twist and surprise even to the fans of the book series. Worth seeing even if you don't like the books.,1368576000,,174,4.147058823529412
4997457,5,B006JM1ZTI,"Didn't think this series could surprise me, but it did! Those who love the Twilight series will enjoy this ending!",1368576000,,114,4.75
4997458,5,B006JM1ZTI,I love the whole Twilight series.  My biggest wish is that somehow they could write another book in the series and do another movie.,1368576000,,132,4.5
4997459,3,B006JM1ZTI,"I feel like, even though Breaking Dawn was split into two movies, they tried to put too much into the film.  I felt like it was missing some background information and moved forward in a choppy way in some places.  Maybe I need to watch part 1 and part 2 back-to-back.",1368489600,,268,4.235294117647059
4997460,5,B006JM1ZTI,we (my family) have enjoyed the movie over and over again! Glad that we purchased online... Will be back when we want something else,1368489600,,132,4.541666666666667
4997461,5,B006JM1ZTI,I was a late comer to the Twilight Saga but got hooked and now am sad to see it end. Both movies held my interest and I will watch them again...,1368489600,,144,3.6774193548387095
4997462,5,B006JM1ZTI,"Purchased all and will say it was great. Kristen truly grew into Beautiful Bella, fought for the life of her love and into motherhood. Robert was Robert throughout, Taylor became the man taking charge and giving us a glimpse into his future love. I've seen the movies but the discs gave so much more into the making of the film. The actors went through quite a lot of stunts to give us this memorable story. The entire story I rate 5 stars.",1368489600,,440,4.378048780487805
4997463,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I'm a grandmother for goodness sake and fell in love with The Twilight Saga back in 2010 and still can't put the books down or stop watching the movies, but Breaking Dawn 2 is the best one of the series to me. It refreshes your memory from the first movie until now and then ends it in a way to make you keep hoping for more.",1368489600,,325,3.9393939393939394
4997464,2,B006JM1ZTI,"Just not good.  I knew it wouldn't be but I'd watched all the others so figured why not?  I was able to constantly leave the room, come back and feel like I missed nothing.",1368489600,,172,4.029411764705882
4997465,1,B006JM1ZTI,I hated it.  Nothing happened that wasn't a rehash - including the montage at the end. [Spoiler alert] The only scene of any import was only a dream - a projection - into Aro's mind.  And even then I didn't care about any of the exotic characters because they were never developed.  Blech!,1368489600,,289,4.415094339622642
4997466,5,B006JM1ZTI,Action filled. Awesome ending and they did a great job making it close to the events in the book! Watch!,1368489600,,104,4.25
4997467,5,B006JM1ZTI,i read the books and had to have the movie o accompany them. now its time to get a dvd player,1368403200,,93,3.4761904761904763
4997468,5,B006JM1ZTI,"So glad to get this at home!  My girlfriend and I had a day-long marathon and watched the entire series when I got this DVD!  I liked the change in the ending, my girlfriend is still unsure.  A very different take on the books, but great cinema!",1368403200,,245,4.170212765957447
4997469,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I am a big fan of this series, the movies as well as the books. I found them both very entertaining. With this being the last movie, I did think that they could have done just a bit more. But even with that said, I loved it.",1368403200,,224,3.7872340425531914
4997470,5,B006JM1ZTI,this movie is real great i have watched it alot it shocked me with the fight scene didn't expect that,1368403200,,101,4.1
4997471,5,B006JM1ZTI,This is the best movie of all times! I love it!! I recommend watching the whole series before you watch this one.,1368403200,,113,4.181818181818182
4997472,5,B006JM1ZTI,"First, if you are a fan of the Twilight Saga films, you will love this film. I gave only 4 stars to Part I because I waited until Part II was available to watch both films. Part II is a wonderful conclusion to the Twilight Saga.",1368403200,,228,3.9782608695652173
4997473,1,B006JM1ZTI,I love the twilight movies but cant really rate something I never received so I guess I only gave it a 1 because I didn't get it,1368403200,,128,3.7777777777777777
4997474,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I loved this film because I loved seeing Bella as a vampire--finally!  However, say what you want about Kristen Stewart, but her rendering of Bella after the ""big change"" is fantastic.  Bella is stronger, sexier, more confident and secure in her own (cold) skin, and absolutely decisive about where her heart belongs and why.  The only part that made no sense is when Jacob phases in front of Bella's father, Chief Swan.

Otherwise, I liked that Part 2 turned into a vampire convention--multiple vampire covens plus the Volturi.  However, since I'm also partial to ""Team Jacob"", I didn't like the fact that most of the New Moon wolves were not in this film excepting ""Sam"" (Chaske Spencer), ""Leah"" (Julia Jones) and ""Seth"" (Boo Boo Stewart).  If you watch the film, make sure you stay for the closing credits, which are a beautiful homage to the cast in all 5 films.  If you're like me, you're thinking ""there's gotta be a sequel"" just based on Aro's (Michael Sheen) last words when he looks at Alice and then at Bella, ""What a prize.""  Between the special effects and the way this last leg of Bella's journey is told, Director Bill Condon and his crew have done a fantastic job.  Bravo!",1368316800,,1187,4.668269230769231
4997475,5,B006JM1ZTI,"Great end to a great saga, highly recommended! Great movie for Tweens and adults alike. I along with my daughter really enjoyed our movie night!",1368316800,,144,4.8
4997476,2,B006JM1ZTI,"The film was fine. I knew what I was buying. However, I have had to buy this and two others, Breaking Dawn Part 2 and Eclipse, twice, as the disc quality is so poor. In all three cases the movie would freeze and eventually say that the disc was scratched or otherwise unable to view. They were clean and barely used. Tried additional cleaning and even took them to the library to have them use their disc cleaning machine. Tried just using the scene selector to get past the unviewable  part, but nothing worked. I would have preferred to pay more for each disc and only have to buy it once. I know it is not my machine, as I buy many sets of dvds and only this series is defective. Anyhow, I am hoping that the new ones are better than the old ones.",1368316800,,750,4.172413793103448
4997477,4,B006JM1ZTI,"You have to watch the series and be somewhat of a fan, but if you follow the story this is a nice nightcap to the whole shebang.  I hate to admit it but I'm a twi-fan and liked it.  Could it have been better?  Maybe, but it was worth watching to tie up the loose ends.",1368316800,,268,3.75
4997478,2,B006JM1ZTI,"I haven't wanted to purchase this to watch, glad I just rented it instead.  This could be a really cool storyline but the acting is so stiff and non-feeling even for a vampire. This could have been such a better movie.  The book was a whole lot better than the movie.  Not impressed with the Kristin Stewart's performance as Bella.  Everything seemed so forced.",1368230400,,361,4.59375

4997481,4,B006JM1ZTI,I actually made myself watch this to finish the Saga.  I'm a little OCD.  The product quality was fine and downloaded without incident.  Movie?  Well......maybe I was just tired of Kristen Stewart.,1368230400,,197,5.0625
4997482,5,B006JM1ZTI,Rented this on Amazon cuz I had only seen the movie once. What a treat! The quality was great & my boring Saturday brightened up quickly as I watched it with the family & a big bowl of popcorn :-D,1368144000,,196,3.925
4997483,3,B006JM1ZTI,Not as good as previous in the series.  Just OK in my opinion.  Glad I did not go to see it at the theater.,1368144000,,107,3.4166666666666665

4997486,5,B006JM1ZTI,I have enjoyed all of the movies in the Twilight series.  This movie was no exception.  It was a good finale.  I think some of the scenery and mood of the movie is great. I'm glad I purchased the whole series.,1368144000,,209,4.048780487804878
4997487,5,B006JM1ZTI,I felt that this was another great addition to the saga.  I would recommend it to young teenagers and adults.  I wanted to watch it again as soon as it was over.,1368144000,,161,4.0

4997489,5,B006JM1ZTI,I liked the movie because Bella did not die she became a vampire instead i would recommend this movie to family and friends.,1368144000,,124,4.434782608695652

4997491,4,B006JM1ZTI,"I read the books more than once & loved them even as an old retired person. I was disappointed in the movies because I don't think the script did them justice. If it wasn't for Robert Pattinson, Taylor Lautner, & Kristen Stewart the movies would not have been as good as they were. That said it was the books that sold the movies. This one was the best of the 5 but still needed more work.",1368144000,,389,4.131578947368421

4997511,4,B006JM1ZTI,I like how they did the end. Much like the book and still not at the same time. It is hard for me to watch a movie after getting so invested in the books. It is just not the same. You cannot get the same detail in there. But for what they had it was good and I would watch it again.,1368057600,,282,3.564516129032258

4997515,1,B006JM1ZTI,"My friends talked me into watching this movie, so, against my best judgment, I bought this. It was a terrible mistake. The movie SUCKS!!! The acting is awful as are the effects. The plot is even worse.
If you have any respect for women, cinematography or human intelligence please don't watch this.",1368057600,2,298,4.75

4997520,5,B006JM1ZTI,IT WAS A GREAT ENDING TO THE SERIES. IT IS TOO BAD IT HAS TO END. BUT IT DOES LEAVE IT OPEN FOR ANOTHER MOVIE,1368057600,,109,3.4
4997521,1,B006JM1ZTI,To bad no one in these movies can act. The special effects are laughable. My friend who watches every movie that comes out talked me into this one. Oh well......,1368057600,,161,4.4
4997522,4,B006JM1ZTI,"Getting this DVD was a great investment/addition to my library.
The UV/VUDU aspect sounded better than the reality. The movie is registered as only SD, HD+ costs another $22.",1368057600,,174,5.0344827586206895
4997523,1,B006JM1ZTI,one i hate Bella and Edward there love story is just plain boring and gross. 2. Bella and Edward have no chemistry which so ever. I can't stand this movie at all. I hate this movie and there stuiped fake love story. nothing happends in this movie no real fighting seens . I loved Jacob alot better in this whole movie. I disagree with people giving this movie 5 stars for being the best movie. I never like any of the twilight books or movies there so lame and boring . Don't waste your money or time on any of these. I don;t recommened anyone to buy this movie and save your money on a really good vampire movie another then twilight. I wish Bella would of died for good cause Kristin Sweart is an bad actress in every movie. this movie has bad actors in this movie. My favorite all time vampire movie is UnderWorld and Blade And Priest there alot better for your money. This whole love story on Twilight was being forced on our throats. And Bella just tried to kill her self to get ugly vampire boyfriend Edward back in her lame boring $$$$ life.,1368057600,3,1048,4.271356783919598

4997526,5,B006JM1ZTI,The twilight series would not be complete with the final installment  Breaking Dawn. Miss McKenzie Foy is an excellent Renesme. The the CGI are a little touch and go in places. The Movie is otherwise brilliant.,1367884800,,210,4.833333333333333
4997527,5,B006JM1ZTI,This was by far the best Twilight series movie.  The actors were very into their roles and did a great job.  I lopved how they acknowledged everyone at the end of the movie.  It was a beautiful closure.,1367884800,,202,4.2631578947368425
4997528,5,B006JM1ZTI,Movie was great. Very much excitable. The volume was great and lots of action of course. We love it very much.,1367884800,,110,4.285714285714286
4997529,5,B006JM1ZTI,Have read all of Stephanie Meyer's books and the movies live up to the quality of the books.  If you like vampire stories you'll like the movies.,1367884800,,145,4.37037037037037

4997531,4,B006JM1ZTI,"Not my fave of the series, but if you've been watching all along, you've got to wrap it up, right?  Not sure how much I like the ending, but the wedding certainly was beautiful.",1367884800,,177,4.205882352941177
4997532,5,B006JM1ZTI,it was a great buy although in stores you could find it for the same price when it was on special. cam in 2  days. no fees. awesome movie. everything went smooth,1367884800,,161,4.03125
4997533,5,B006JM1ZTI,"Many would insert a joke here about it being the best because it's over but really, it is the best of the five. I found that it was more on par with the images my mind conjured while reading the book. In the other films, I was let down and thought that most of what I thought was important in the books was left out. They did the ending justice though.",1367884800,,352,3.971830985915493
4997534,5,B006JM1ZTI,"Loved this in the theater and love it now.  Interesting twist and not exactly like the book, but great movie.",1367798400,,109,4.45

4997536,3,B006JM1ZTI,"I am such a huge Twilight fan and Breaking Dawn was my favorite book. Particularly the last part. And they left out so much of the really wonderful bits of her as a new vampire  Instead they spent all this time on a gory battle that didn't happen. So yes, I was disappointed. I might have liked it more if I hadn't read the book and known what it could be.",1367798400,,356,4.014084507042254
4997537,5,B006JM1ZTI,"Love, Love, Love this movie.  I sure hate this is the end of the Saga, I hope Sephanie Myer decides to continue on with Jakob and Renesme's relationship.  Afterall, vampires never die!",1367798400,,184,4.71875
4997538,5,B006JM1ZTI,I have read the entire series and have seen all the movies.  This one was the best of all.  On a big screen TV the best part was the fight between the good and the bad.  It made it so real that it was real only to find out that it was what would happen.,1367798400,,253,3.5636363636363635

4997541,3,B006JM1ZTI,"I couldn't pass up renting it. It is terribly fun to watch, but it is like a B movie that someone accidentally gave excessive funding. The grandness of it all makes up for the bad acting and dull story.",1367712000,,202,4.205128205128205
4997542,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I love this series.  I hated to see it come to an end.  I have all the movies.  If you haven't watched it, you really need to.",1367712000,,126,3.5925925925925926
4997543,5,B006JM1ZTI,"But, in this instance, I thought the movie was great. I'm not sure the book was not better, but I was still very impressed with the movie! I enjoyed all of them, but the others were definitely not as good as the book. For whatever reason, this last installment was far and above the others. The characters were better, the acting was better, and I believed the characters were spot on what Stephanie created on the page! If you've never seen the others, see this one, you won't regret it.

Spoiler alert:

Even though toward the end I felt like my heart was ripped out, they made up for it and it added something special.",1367712000,,621,4.391304347826087

4997554,2,B006JM1ZTI,"The books were great.  Each and every one of the books were beautifully written;  they each kept me wanting for more.  The movies on the other hand were horrible.  From the acting to the specials effects, they were all a major let-down.",1367625600,,236,4.5476190476190474

4997557,5,B006JM1ZTI,I loved this movie at the theater and was quite amazed at the quality of the blu ray which delivered outstanding audio and video.  It looked and sounded great on my home theater and I would recommend it to any fan of the series.,1367625600,,228,4.181818181818182

4997586,5,B006JM1ZTI,This is my favorite movie from the series. It was done better than any of the others. You have to have this one in your collection if you are a fan. Packaging was great as well.,1367366400,,177,3.9444444444444446
4997587,5,B006JM1ZTI,"Well, I have seen the whole story - in fact many times now and it all ended really well and left me feeling complete seeing even Jacob had a promising and lovely future. Knowing Jacob as a protector, I can tell you I was not the least bit getting an EWWW factor when Jacob imprinted on Bella and Edwards baby to protect her. To me that was the ultimate sacrifice, as ultimate as the sacrifice Bella had endured to carry the child - so to me it was the perfect solution and it gave Jacob the outright best outcome there could have been in the love triangle when Bella and Edward married in part 1.

I also loved the fact that the story touched on the the side of newborn vampires that even surprised the other Vampires - that Bella really was born to be one of them, but in a far more graceful and non-threatening manner than any Vampires previously had known. I loved the battle and was glad it was what it was and not what it could have been. If that line is confusing - it will only be confusing to thise who have not yet seen the movie.

Even though I felt the story at the end was complete - I am fully satisfied and will see myself rewatched the whole 5 disks many times to come and be entirely happy with the final outcome - a small part of me can't help but wish perhaps Stephani Meyers might reconsider and pick up the story again some 10-12 or so years in the future - focusing on the story of Jacob and his possible happy ending as well. I think it would be cool to see these lifelong enemies be united finally in a legal and permanent marriage. I would also like to see a future for Sam and Emily as well as for Seth and that his sister does find the love of her life. You know focus a bit more on the tribe and them dealing with Jacobs imprinting on this very different little girl. I would also like to see Bella and Edwards daughter come into her own. It would be nice to have all the original characters, but change the focus more on the tribe and hopefully their acceptance of Jacobs choice.

But as far as Breaking Dawn goes it was an extremely satisfying ending for me and I loved the extras that came with it. The dance surprise for Bill and all the characters speaking about their part in the story as well as the acting. So I suggest make sure anyone who buys this movie, get the version with all the extras - it is hours more fun.",1367366400,,2352,4.131004366812227
4997588,1,B006JM1ZTI,"I'm a fan of the books but the movies continue to disappoint. All the movies were bad, but in an acceptable way, if that makes sense. This was just bad bad. The cgi was terrible and the acting worse than ever. The adaptation to a movie from the book was pretty awful, too, from what I recall. The online rental, however, worked perfectly.",1367366400,,338,4.380952380952381

4997590,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I have watched Breaking Dawn Part 2 too many times to count,however there were flaws in the movie that could have made it much better. It would have only taken maybe 10 to 15 minutes more of the movie to really clear those parts up and twihards would  have watched with no problem. However, when I heard the movie was given a ""Rassie"" I was appalled!!! That's just not right at all! I loved watching Bella kicking butt! Kristen Stewart played the part so well. She got better with each movie.
I have the whole set. I will keep on watching these movies for many years to come. Hopefully someday another movie will be made and they can continue on with the Cullen Family. I don't feel others want to give them up either.",1367366400,,718,4.358208955223881

Funny, one rainy day I decieded to have a movie marathon. For some reason the first movie was missing (just moved). So was very happy to find another copy of the first movie in the Twilight series.

DVD came as described by seller, quality is great & I wouldn't hesitate to purchase from this seller again.

4997618,2,B006JM1ZTI,"Well, it took a while but I finally caught up to this final chapter of The Twilight Saga.  After seeing all those that came before, let's face it, I just wasn't interested.  I was a bit curious about this whole idea of Jacob (Taylor Lautner) ""imprinting"" Renesmee (CGI, then Mackenzie Foy), the child of Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson) as Part 1 closed.  Although I'm not sure about exactly what ""imprinting"" entails, I was thinking that this fast growing child of a vampire and a human would soon catch up to Jacob, age wise.  Now that would be interesting.  Alas, it wasn't.  Nor was anything else.

The film is chock full of lame dialog.  So much so, I don't know how the actors - most of which are excellent in other work - kept a straight face.  Others will have to decide whether this is the screenwriter or the original author's fault.  From a technical viewpoint, this isn't very good either.  Let's start with baby Renesmee.  We first see her as a CGI created baby that is, well, ugly.  Not to mention the fact that the use is very primitive.  Then we have the Bella and Edward hopping around the Washington mountains and valleys looking for blood.  This is so badly produced that it's laughable.  As usual, the movie has a fine soundtrack and some nice sets.  All of the houses are to die for, and I guess the characters did.  Pretty dumb movie.",1367107200,,1377,4.528455284552845

I don't care, 'cause I just love the Twilight Saga.  In this final installment, there were some deviations from the way the book dealt with the story.  But it didn't matter because the story ""tracked"" perfectly well in the movie, too.  Watching the incredible technological prowess in this particular movie was impressive.  The baby who rapidly becomes a child, the improved look and movement of the ""wolf pack""...s'all good.  If you've chosen to read this review, you either are looking to confirm what you already know, or you've lived under a rock for the past 5 years if you're unsure what this movie is about!  True love conquers all, in a fantasy world of good and evil vampires, a few curious and fearless humans, and a pack of wolves who are also a close-knit Native American clan.  Add to that an impossible birth and a case of mistaken identity, and you've got the final installment of the Saga that had many of us choosing ""Team Edward"" or ""Team Jacob"" for the past few years.",1366934400,,1130,4.633165829145729

The feelings of guilt, shame and remorse after having experienced the Twilight movies will probably haunt me for the rest of my life. I have finally found a good therapist that has me on the right medication to ease the suicidal thoughts, but now when someone asks me if I want to see ANY movie, the question triggers something dark in my mind and I have a panic attack.

The only thing I would have like different was to see more of Jacob's wolf family in this last movie.

4997764,1,B006JM1ZTI,"Seven of us watched the movie, and the votes were unanimous: REALLY BAD MOVIE.
We had our popcorn and drinks ready and we were not expecting Academy Award quality. (After all, it won a Razzie).

Still, it was stunningly wooden.  How Kristen Stewart could make a cold unmoving vampire look even more hollow and vacuous is a feat in itself.

The story line was changed somewhat from the book, and for those of us who read the series, we felt this movie did not create the tension, characters, and excitement of the novel. Here we FINALLY had the BIG vampire showdown and it was so anticlimactic.

Michael Sheen admirably chewed the scenery, but since there wasn't much to look at (yes, scenic forests, stunning hillsides...meaningless), there was little he could do. Pretty much everyone was one-dimensional, but, except for Stewart just being the worst ever, I think the weak script and uncoordinated direction did the rest of them in.

This was a real whimper ending to a not-that-bad series.",1366156800,5,992,4.846153846153846

But this movie outdid itself. I don't know why it was on the razzy list for being a horrible movie unless it had something to do with Kristen's affair w the director and her cheating on Robert Pattison. I hope it wasn't judge due to that scandal bc it's really a good movie.,1365897600,,442,4.034090909090909

4997805,5,B006JM1ZTI,"Item arrived fast, brand new. Love this movie!!! So much better than the book. The movie is very dramatic, explores deep interesting themes, like all of the twilight movies. In this one, the fight scene is particularly impressive. It poses a question - is it really worth fighting, or better resolve issues politically? Because - are you willing to pay the price? Yes, you would destroy the ""bad guys"", but are you ready to lose some of your own? And at the same time, how it is important to stand your ground and defend your principles and your way of living. Also, what being together as a couple means (again), how it is importand to always stay together, no matter what. Example - ""spoilers"" - Bella and Edward run to attack Aro. Aro gives Bella a kick, and she flies high trough the air. Edward, because he cares more for her than to give another kick to Aro, is all about catching her first. When he does that, they are able to overcome Aro together, quite easily. Because there's two of them. A couple bound by mutual love and care for each other - nothing can be stronger than this!",1365811200,,1090,4.455

I love the fact that there is not blood and guts all over the screen and I love that not only are the women beautiful and talented but the men are excellant actors and so good to look at.

I thought for the longest time in the movie the little girl was mute-she only had about 4 lines-and that's pushing it. She's a beautiful girl and there is no doubt that's the reason she was cast for the role. Ends fairly abruptly which was mildly disappointing.. actually kind of confusing to me really. I haven't ever read the books so it's likely this movie made more since to those who have. If you are a casual movie viewer like me who isn't overly interested in reading the book before the movie then you might be some what disappointed especially based on the other films level of entertainment. The actors sort of seemed to muscle their way through this movie, almost like they were sick of filming this series (kind of board)...",1365724800,,821,4.516778523489933

4997836,4,B006JM1ZTI,If you have all the movies it would be silly not to own this one also. I did like it better than the part one and I did rented it before I bought it to make sure that I wanted it in my home. I was not with the out come of part one but then I guess it made money for those who made a movie of it. I do have all of them and if you didn't see part one you should before you see part two. I am glad that I do have all of them as a collection.,1365638400,,438,3.303921568627451
4997837,1,B006JM1ZTI,"Any move that has a dream sequence make up two thirds of the movie is not worth watching. That's to bad because I almost liked the first three; almost. Twinkling vampires need I say more?? Edward vs Tinker Bell, Tinker Bell wins hands down.",1365638400,,240,4.4772727272727275

4997841,3,B006JM1ZTI,After having read the books and watched all the movies there wasn't a chance I'd miss the final installment. I'm glad to have gotten to the end but I guess there was just to much of the books story to be conveyed to really love this movie. Most of the 'facts' are present so there's no real loss there except there was no way to include the heightened tension. The most disappointing thing for me was the odd or poor graphic with the baby. The Twi-hards can rest easy cause there's always the books.,1365638400,,499,4.319148936170213

4997843,4,B006JM1ZTI,"As a middle-aged mother of three, I am not the target demographic for these books or movies, but I make no apologies for enjoying them, as we all need our escapes. To be sure, this movie, like all the others, has many problems. I have always found both Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart wooden in their delivery, although I've grown fond of them in these roles anyway. The special effects in these films have ranged from great to downright campy (the wolf transformations have always been pretty comic-book to me.) But this film has the best material to work with, in terms of Bella FINALLY being a vampire, FINALLY being married to Edward, and having a beautiful daughter to boot. The climax with the Volturi is very well-done, by far the best scene on all levels done in any of these movies. It has a real epic (and not at all campy) feel to it when the 2 forces come towards each other (won't share much more so I don't spoil it.) So if you're a fan of these books and movies, you're bound to like this one. And if not, but your partner/spouse/friend is, this might be one you can stand to watch with him/her:-)",1365638400,,1117,4.427184466019417

Right now there just hard cover. :(",1365638400,,230,4.634146341463414
4997845,3,B006JM1ZTI,"I'm no Twi-hard but I really liked the movie Twilight for all its kitsch and the feel of the movie. I thought the next movies were done pretty well and enjoyed them enough to be entertained. Then I read the books and thought the last one was ridiculous. But BD pt 1 was ok to watch. BD pt 2 had nothing to work with because the plot of the book was so ridiculous. A bunch of new characters, preparation for a big showdown, then nothing. I don't care about all those new characters. I didn't care about meeting them in the movie, either. Too many to keep track of. So the movie was a whole lot of nothing and even though the director did try to make it exciting visually and through the screen play, it didn't work. The movie fell flatter than the book. blah.",1365638400,,758,4.198630136986301

4997852,4,B006JM1ZTI,"I bought 2 copies of this movie as gifts.  I was surprised to get a gift myself, when I was given the opportunity to rent it and watch it on my computer.  It was a fitting close to this series and the special effects were pretty good.  The acting of the main heroine is slightly better than the first 4 pics, but still a bit wooden.  Overall, the fans will be pleased.",1365638400,,368,4.069444444444445
4997853,2,B006JM1ZTI,"Much to about nothing, really. It was a waste of my time, and, background music so loud that it drowns out the characters lines. After all, the character, Bella, does not speak louder than a whisper at any given time. And if she did, the background music drowns her out anyway. I expected more, in that it was the conclusion of the series; however, what I got was not worth what I paid for the film.",1365638400,,399,4.2631578947368425

4997862,5,B006JM1ZTI,"OMG! Nothing,what I had expected. Thank God Bella gained some personality when she became a vampire . I love how Alive showed the Vultori what exactly they were in store for. That was a pretty sick fight.

I am interested to know if we will be seeing Jacob and Renesma in the future..",1365552000,,284,4.3584905660377355
4997863,2,B006JM1ZTI,"Is it really over?

Breaking Dawn part 25, in which Bella dies and turns into something nasty (or just plain nasty).  Seriously, an arm wrestling contest!?  A cartoon baby.  And yet another vampire with a grudge who goes to Italy to squeal.

Weirdest performance/performer Michael Sheen.  Most real character/person Billy Burke.  Almost subliminal appearance in a thoroughly wasted role, Dakota Fanning.  And Lee Pace was in this movie!!?!?!?!?  Where?

Cheat.  This is a movie that proves you can't have your epic battle and expect it to be real.
No surprise, a music video ending.
Who would name their kid Renesmee!?  Nickname: Smee.  Didn't he work for Captain Hook?

In my own defense, I bought all the movies in this series before I knew what they were about, based solely on their popularity.  I won't make that mistake again!  None of them are keepers.",1365552000,,859,4.9020979020979025

4997866,5,B006JM1ZTI,"Yes, Breaking Dawn Part II was excellent - a perfect ending to the series - I particularly like the fact that Jacob was so involved in the

The acting from most of the cast members has finally caught up to the expectations of the script, Kristen Stewart puts on her best performance of the whole series.  Robert Pattinson is better, less mopey and emotional than he has been in previous installments, and even non-fans of the Twilight series will probably enjoy this movie to some degree.",1365465600,,506,4.538461538461538

I would recommend it to anyone.",1365379200,,358,4.202898550724638

I have watch both the 1st and 2nd about 10 times now and never get tired of them. I am really hoping that she will finish Midnight Sun and also put it into a movie.

4997929,3,B006JM1ZTI,I think they tried too hard to make this a spectacular ending to the saga.  What they ended up doing is making it only so-so.  I was disappointed by it.,1365379200,,152,4.033333333333333

I have an iTunes copy and a Vudu copy (not very familiar yet with Vudu) so there is a possibility that I can upload my iTunes version to the cloud on Amazon but there is no Vudu app for the kindle. Since music I buy on Amazon automatically has it stored in the cloud I thought movies would be the same. Wrong.
Not going to really review the movie, although I think it was done very well, great ending to the series and probably the best of all of them.",1365379200,,586,4.060344827586207

I hope they will offer the complete set as an anniversary edition with special DVD on each actors with movies and gallery.

4997949,2,B006JM1ZTI,"I haven't followed the series so that may be partially why I felt totally lost viewing the film.  Most of the actors were beautiful, all were attractive, but for me, not knowing what came before, I couldn't understand why the characters behaved the way they did, so not really a stand-alone viewable film in my opinion.  I saw the first film, and I think I read the first book in the series, and one of my sisters loves this series and I believe told me parts of some of the other books but I've either forgotten or just never knew enough of the series to follow this film conclusion.  Bella seems to be saying in this story that though she is not human, she doesn't deem her new life as a vampire in a negative light, but I don't know enough of the series story to understand how the change impacts her quality of life.  As a stand-alone film, didn't care for it.",1365206400,,864,4.282208588957055

4997965,5,B006JM1ZTI,I love the Twilight Saga books - most of the movies have not lived up to the scenes I created in my mind when reading the books.  This one was very close though.  Without giving away too much - the cottage was exactly how I pictured it!  When Stephanie Meyer said in the extras that she wanted the cottage to look like it had grown from the ground - I knew just what she meant as I am looking for just that type of house in real life now.,1365120000,,438,3.898876404494382

The 'two-parts' use of time satisfied for revealing the depth of events maturing the characters and relationships (teen marriage, at-risk pregnancy, reluctant (albeit immortal) teen father hangs in there, heroically through childbirth and death)... loved the 'wink' visual storytelling allowed the writer, director, et.al to play as the fantastic battle scene.

4997997,5,B006JM1ZTI,It was one of the best twilight movies nxt to beaking dawn part 1 and the very first twilight I would recomend this to a vampire lover or a twilight lover,1365033600,,154,4.0
4997998,5,B006JM1ZTI,I loved the little twist @ the end with the Cullen Family & The VolturI? It was a good fight ;-),1365033600,,96,3.619047619047619

4998002,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I am a huge fan of the books and the movies. I was very sad to read the last page of Breaking Dawn, and very sad to know that the last movie would be out. Went to the marathon on release day and sat through all of the movies. Breaking Dawn Part 2 has a twist that you don't see coming at the end. I will say no more so I don't give anything away, but it is soooooo worth it. The producers really did the fans good on this movie finale!",1365033600,,435,3.739130434782609
4998003,5,B006JM1ZTI,"Seriously, I didn't want to see this franchize end.  Forget the gaffs and cinematography ""challenges"", (even some questionable acting performaces), It was good fun, a great movie and for my money, the best of the Twilight Saga---the ending caught even ME off guard!!",1365033600,,266,5.186046511627907
4998004,5,B006JM1ZTI,In my opinion the first movie and this movie are the best ones in the series. I really liked the twist at the end.,1365033600,,114,3.7916666666666665

4998006,5,B006JM1ZTI,"And I'm not just saying that. Although they left a lot out, they really took creative licence with the fight scene. I know there's people who get so mad when writers don't stick to the book. Hey, I get that way sometimes, too. But in this case, they did something amazing with it. It didn't take anything away at all, and it almost adds to the book in a sense. I loved it.",1365033600,,372,4.109589041095891
4998007,4,B006JM1ZTI,"If you have watched the rest of these Twilight movies you must watch this one also. The movie moves at a pretty good pace but maybe too fast. While I have not read nay of the books it seems that they tried to fit in too much of the book stuff with not enough time and it ended leaving a lot of dangling plots out there. It would have been interesting to understand some of the side plots. The scene with the big battle has a very interesting twist to it. While it was a good movie, I feel it could have been better.",1365033600,,515,3.9615384615384617
4998008,5,B006JM1ZTI,The finale to the awesome twilight saga. While they try to fit in all the necessary parts. I was disappointed with the many holes and disjointed scenes definetly not the best but it finishes the series.,1365033600,,202,4.638888888888889
4998009,5,B006JM1ZTI,This is the best Twilight movie of them all! I was super excited to have it pre-ordered. If you're not a Twilight fan than obviously you won't feel the same and have no reason to be reading this review. If you are then you know you must own this DVD along with all of the others! Way cheaper than buying it elsewhere and it shipped in less than a week!,1365033600,,352,4.042857142857143

4998012,4,B006JM1ZTI,this one seemed to have a fake side to it. it was not as good as the others at all. I felt like it looked like they justdid a quick job on this one.,1365033600,,148,3.3823529411764706
4998013,5,B006JM1ZTI,Saw it at the movies but had to watch again. Really good. Breaking Dawn 1&2 were the best of the movie series.,1365033600,,110,4.045454545454546
4998014,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I loved this one too..just like the ones that preceeded it.  I was bummed when I first wached this one, an I don't wanna ruin it by saying why..but it kept my interest the whole way through.  It does, however, leave the audience wishing they would continue the saga, (for me personally anyway) to see how Renesemme grows up with Jacob...I would definately recommend this to any wilight fan or anyone who likes suspense Drama's and the vampire thing.",1365033600,,449,4.670886075949367
4998015,4,B006JM1ZTI,Good ending to the series.  I am not a book reader but got hooked on this series.  Definately like how it all came together!,1365033600,,124,4.125

4998018,5,B006JM1ZTI,now this is one movie that you don't want to miss out on. It's not as good as the book but with this you get to see what some of the story line is about without having to imagine it. Way Good Movie,1365033600,,197,3.604651162790698

I recommend this entire series to anyone that enjoys a good romance, warning, this is not your conventional romance, but a good story.",1364947200,,303,4.206896551724138
4998021,4,B006JM1ZTI,"There was less teen angst in this film, but for me it still had way too much of a moon-eyed love fest at the end. The young girl that played in this movie was very sweet, it was also nice to finally see all the characters in grown up roles and not trying to play teenagers. Also was it just me or did the Collins forget to bring grenades to the fight at the end of the movie were they were out numbered twenty to one or something, kind of hard to tell.  Also why is it when they pull the vampires heads off that blood didn't go squirting everywhere?  Maybe they ran low on cash and couldn't afford the blood because of all the other CGI effects?  Oh! Well! Happy movie going and enjoy.",1364947200,,685,4.059259259259259
4998022,1,B006JM1ZTI,"*mutters in almost incoherent rage* They ruined it. RUINED IT. Although I don't know why I'm surprised. I cannot STAND screenwriters and directors of movies made from books that feel they have to change the story in order to ""put their own take on it."" That's just spitting in the face of the fans who made the book popular enough in the first place for there to *be* a movie. I've said this before, but if you've only watched the Twilight movies and haven't read the books, you are seriously short-changing yourself. If I had to make a comparison, it's like - especially with this final movie - as if they are two boxes that are identical in every way on the outside, but completely different on the inside. And that utterly ridiculous fight scene!! Wasted 30 minutes of screen time on something that didn't even exist in the book, while they completely butchered the rest of the book. UGH!!!! I seriously, SERIOUSLY hope Stephanie Meyer got a lot of money for this - I'd hate to think they got to butcher her wonderful storyline for a mere paltry sum.  The first movie was the closest to the book, but it just went downhill from there.  Rent it if you must see it, but don't waste your money on a permanent copy - and don't say you weren't warned.  /rant over",1364947200,6,1261,4.45021645021645

The movies did the books justice. I wish Ms. Meyers would continue the Saga, but am very satisfied with what she gave us. I would recommend this series to anyone who is a hopeless romantic like myself. It is very entertaining. Not just to the teens it was aimed at, but to women and some guys also. It is a love story, but also action packed enough for the guys. I LOVE vampire movies and books, but sorry Edward (Robert), I was definately with team Jacob (Taylor). Don't get me wrong, I loved Edward, but was rooting for Jacob and Bella. :) Thank you guys. Oh yeah, I almost went into shock  when Aro beheaded Carlyle!!! Oh my goodness!!!

I ordered it on a Saturday and was able to view it as an instant video on my iPad before it arrived 2 days later. Love that instant gratification. On to the movie. It just seemed like a terrible B movie. I know the script didn't give them a lot of options but it just seemed like nothing happened. The first movie had the wedding, honeymoon, pregnancy and birth. This had the growth of a child and gathering of vampires for an hour and a half. Not enough of what true twilight fans love-live story and moments between the family. Save time and watch the original-still the best.",1364947200,,720,4.380597014925373

It's a movie i'd see again, and so that's a selling point.  Of course there's nothing like the books, but picking out what to put in a movie and then adding special effects and dialog is an art in itself.  I didn't give it 5 stars as i felt some key parts could have gotten more time and depth, but that's just me.",1364860800,,477,3.8469387755102042
4998071,1,B006JM1ZTI,"I'm going to start out with how horribly cheezy this movie was, and how horrible of an actress Kristen Stewart is. She makes me want to choke my self. I read all the books, and hated them. But I was told by a friend who is overly obsessed with the series that if I wanted to hate on it, I had to read it first. The whole series sends out a horrible message. It disgusts me that 12-13 year old girls were lined up for blocks to watch this film, that pretty much states vampires have better sex than humans. Weird.

But enough about the movie. I could go on all day.

I watched it on Amazon's video player, and it froze every 10 minutes so I had to refresh the page and start watching again. Amazon's player does this to everything I try to watch. And it's not my internet connection, I have the fastest wireless connection you can get. Netflix and other video streaming services work perfectly fine.",1364860800,,898,4.276470588235294

The last ten minutes made the entire thing worth watching.  My poor husband has been dragged to all of the movies, and he would say that he didn't like the first three.  But he actually enjoyed this last installment, and said he was glad I made him watch the first three otherwise the last one wouldn't have made any sense.",1364860800,,472,4.0978260869565215

I went to all the trouble to do all of that, but then found out that I can't watch the movie on my Kindle Fire.

4998121,2,B006JM1ZTI,"First of all I will say that it was entertaining and beautifully shot. The film crew and director deserve a lot of credit for making this super fantasy overly fictional seem some what serious. Now the reason why I gave this series a such a low rating because the writer just let her pin flow where ever it wanted to go with out any laws, or reason what so ever. Why are these kids vampires any way? They're doing everything that vampires traditionally can't do. They're walking around in broad day light enjoying the sun in a flower filled meadow, they can procreate even though they're technically dead, they can live off animal hemoglobin be best friends with creatures that eat them and have sex with humans they traditionally have looked at as food. They go to school graduate and get married and have creepy vampire kids that kill their mothers. Not to mention Did any one besides me think that Bella was just plain crazy.  Did anyone think that she obsessive, selfish, inconsiderate and just plane stupid over this creepy dude that was what 106 or something? Why isn't it perverted that he's dating a child and ultimately marries het that's like a faction of his age? Why is it romantic that a she tries to kill her self, give up everything including her family and friends and change her entire being and any chance at having a normal life and family and even becomes dead for this dude? But the writer had that worked out didn't she? She had a team of enablers that make poor Jacob the only voice of reason look like an antagonist? But we can call him a misogynist because this chick doesn't have any regard for him what so ever? She doesn't care that she wants him to risk his life for her but tells Edward not to? She says her safety was more important because Edward said so its ok for the one person who liked her just the way she was selfish and inconsiderate as she was to die for her as long as her dear creepy goes unharmed when she caused the whole thing on first place and continued to play with his emotions for her benefit? Was I the only one who thought that was cruel? And what about the team of enablers they has that went along with all the problems this relationship caused? Is that likely that one person can have that many enablers? And one chick who does what ever she wants, and endangers how many people and disregards her poor father has that many people supporting her? For all the teenagers that are watching this self degrading Romeo and Juliet Disney princess fantasy please don't get any ideas about love from this movie.",1364774400,,2557,4.463675213675214

There's also a ""making of"" featurette showing how some of the action scenes were shot. A satisfying package for those who have been following the series from the beginning. The book is better, though.",1364601600,,455,4.7

I only read the first hundred pages of the first book in the series and put it down as I have a rule: If I can't get into the book 100 pages in, it's not worth my time to read it. However, my mom is a fan and has dragged me to every Twilight movie. They were all okay. Nothing I would buy and add to my movie collection, but not were I felt I needed to burn my eyes out to get the awful movie out of my head. I was entertained, however, it wasn't until I saw the last movie, Breaking Dawn Part 2 that I finally felt Twilight did something good. Needless to say I found out from those Twilight fans that most of this movie was nothing like the end of the last book. Figures and totally explains why I actually enjoyed it over all the others. Now if the whole Twilight saga was written like this last movie, I might have actually become a fan. At least the screen writers knew how to end the saga.",1364515200,,920,3.9251336898395723

4998230,4,B006JM1ZTI,"We saw this movie in the theater and liked it so much that we bought the DVD. The books were very good and the movie follows the story line pretty well. Since it's impossible to convey everything in a book in movie form without making the show hours long, the twist they added  was an excellent way to close the story-line without making the movie too long.",1364428800,,357,4.3283582089552235
4998231,5,B006JM1ZTI,"And I had only gotten around to ordering it maybe 3 days before the release!?!? It was wonderful! Plus a GREAT price for the DVD/Digital Copy/UV! I was able to buy Part 1 at the same time even because of the great prices! And the movies, cases, codes all in great shape and order even through the shipping!

As for the movie, it was amazing! I had heard talk about the surprise ending (which I won't spoil for anyone) and I was very concerned that maybe they would have taken it too far or done something with it that really led it astray. BUT as jaw-dropping surprising as the surprise ending is, I still loved it!

4998255,4,B006JM1ZTI,The movie was great but downloading the ultraviolet copy was terrible and there was no directions on how to download. Next time I'll reconsider ordering just the DVD.,1364428800,,166,4.964285714285714

4998261,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I Love the twilight series, this movie was awesome, I recommend it to anyone who has seen any of these.
I wish they could go on for awhile longer. I normally don't watch movies like these, but I got into them, it's like you are there
with the characters, living the moments with them. Great movies!!!!",1364428800,,301,4.392857142857143
4998262,5,B006JM1ZTI,I would give 10 stars for this one the completion of the series? I think not would like to see a movie of the future of Edwards child.,1364428800,,134,3.8214285714285716
4998263,5,B006JM1ZTI,Great movie! Love watching on my iPad. Just like being in the theater. Would recommend to every one. Enjoy watching,1364428800,,115,4.8

4998266,3,B006JM1ZTI,"Soy admiradora de la historia y esta entrega es fenomenal. Me encant el tratamiento tan delicado de los crditos, tanto al inicio como al final de la pelcula. Esta consideracin, como amor sobre el trabajo realizado, no lo he visto en ninguna saga hasta ahora estrenada. No obstante, el CD trae algunos bonus track que no sirven para nada.",1364342400,,337,4.728813559322034

4998268,2,B006JM1ZTI,"I thought this was a really cheesy movie. To me, it didn't contain much substance. I came really close to not finishing the DVD but being that I paid for it, I suffered through the remainder of the movie. In my opinion, Twilight and New Moon was the best!",1364342400,,255,4.224489795918367
4998269,4,B006JM1ZTI,I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT! WONDERFUL WAY TO END A LOVE STORY...TO BE TOGETHER FOREVER. IF ONLY REALITY WAS SO WONDERFUL AND WE COULD BE WITH OUR TRUE AND ONLY LOVE FOREVER.,1364342400,,169,4.3125
4998270,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I just recently watched the first twilight movie and was hooked. My husband isn't real interested in ""girly"" type movies, so maybe thats why it took me so long to see the first.  I have now purchased all of them. I ordered this last one and waited because it was not released yet. I love the first original movie, and this last one the best. The middle movies are not as inspiring/romantic, and effects and plot are less impressive. This last one Breaking Dawn part 2 really sums up the series, has neat fantasy details I like, etc. I guess you did need the middle movies to reach this finale, but I kinda have interest in just watching one and four over and skipping the middle ones. As always delivered quickly and safely from Amazon. And haven't tried it but the ultraviolet copy for streaming the movie sounds neat too. I have heard some people say they don't like this feature or the way it works or something, and I haven't actually tried to watch it that way, but it is still a neat bonus that came with my hard copy.",1364342400,,1024,4.361256544502618

4998273,2,B006JM1ZTI,I've enjoyed all the books so I have to watch the movieseven though I know they will be lame and low-budget. And it was. What was with the weird computerized baby? 2 stars.,1364342400,,172,4.242424242424242
4998274,1,B006JM1ZTI,"Only reason anybody watches this is to check out the actors, the plot sucks, the animation sucks, and its soooo boring!!!!",1364342400,,122,4.857142857142857
4998275,1,B006JM1ZTI,"While watching I had the impression the director said to himself he could deliberately make the most absurd, worst movie and still make a zillion dollars. And he did. The plot was so far beyond absurd words fail me. Acting was just awful. Dialogue so idiotic I still can hardly beiieve it. The make-up atrocious. The climatic battle was without doubt the dumbest battle scene in the history of cinema. If the movie was meant as a joke, I give it one star. If it was meant as anything else, the scale doesn't allow for an accurate rating.",1364342400,2,537,4.489795918367347

4998278,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I enjoyed this movie and the entire saga.  I have read all four novels and have seen all the movies.  And I own them all, too.  I do secretly hope for another book and movie, but only if it uses the same characters.",1364342400,,215,3.953488372093023
4998279,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I saw this movie in the theatres and while it strayed from the way the book was written, it was extremely well done.  There were twists and turns that were shocking and emotionally devastating, building an emotional tension that was rivoting, only to be broken later with surprisingly joyous sighs of relief once the mystery unfolded.  The emotional rollercoaster gave each of the characters more depth, and took viewers along for the ride.  The movie was so well done that the audience in the theatre actually applauded. Loudly.  I'm sure most would agree, It was the best movie in the series.",1364342400,,594,4.851485148514851

4998282,5,B006JM1ZTI,Have watched it again &again. Do wish they had chosen a different look for the old camps but still brest.,1364256000,,105,4.3
4998283,1,B006JM1ZTI,Such a letdown. The script was awful the actors struggled and the effects looked amateur. Too much green screen and not enough location. It felt as though the producers where just going for the cash in. Shame on them.,1364256000,,217,4.589743589743589
4998284,5,B006JM1ZTI,A great moive for a Twillight fan.  I have all of the movies for my family collection.  A great movie for anyone collection,1364256000,,123,4.304347826086956

4998289,4,B006JM1ZTI,Bella really was born to be a vampire and should have been turned 2 movies back! This movie does a great job bringing closure to this saga and it gives you some great action sequences.,1364256000,,184,4.285714285714286

This movie, Breaking Dawn Part 2, just makes you want to watch MORE! I have a feeling, even though they said it was the finale, I think they should make another one! If you're a TRUE Twilight Fan, I'm sure you're with me! I'd like to know more, even after Alice's future being shown...I think they should make another movie, watching Renesmae grow with Jacob, what The Cullen's life turns out to with the Voltory! They DID say, ""We will not fight today!"" ...So, what happens as Renesmae gets older? Jacob and Renesmae's life? Bella and Edward? So many unanswered questions!!

I had preordered my copy through Amazon and hoped it would at least be here by March 4. To my surprise and delight, the movie was in our mailbox the morning of March 2. When my daughter came home from work that afternoon I teased her with the fact that I already had my copy and she still needed to go to the store to purchase hers. I love the movie and have already watched it numerous times. This was a fantastic transaction.",1364256000,,591,4.147826086956521

A moving love story that plays out to the end with an amazing action sequence towards the end.

All the other 4 collector's edition come in a beautiful thick cardboard, almost thick cover book like finishing, but this last movie was done like an after thought.

Buy it for the movie but forget about having a beautiful complete DVD collector's edition set for your collection to go with the books.",1364256000,,509,4.593406593406593

4998338,5,B006JM1ZTI,I saw this at the cinema and had to get one for my home collection. It didn't actually watch the Twilight Saga until recently. I finally checked out what everyone was talking about and really enjoy the series. It arrived quickly and as advertised. This one has some great moments in it that keeps you on the edge of your seat!,1364169600,,326,4.360655737704918
4998339,5,B006JM1ZTI,I like the whole twilight saga. Unlike the other Twilight movies this one is a little different from the book.,1364169600,,110,4.55
4998340,3,B006JM1ZTI,"Girlfriend wanted to watch it.  Honestly, I'm sick of vampire movies.  Good acting and good story line and it of course looked amazing in HD on my 55 inch plasma!  Oh Ya!",1364169600,,170,4.25
4998341,5,B006JM1ZTI,Loved it!! Great love story and action all in one. Was great final movie. Sad see it all end. Everyone that is into twilight should see this movie.,1364169600,,147,4.285714285714286
4998342,5,B006JM1ZTI,I like the whole series.  This was the ending for now and it was done quite well.  The little girl played an excellent part also.,1364169600,,129,4.12

4998345,2,B006JM1ZTI,"Boring. Hated the end and the middle part. Can't Kristin Stewart were anything except sneakers? I guess it more or less tied up the ends, but I only bought it because I have the rest of the series.",1364169600,,197,4.2105263157894735
4998346,5,B006JM1ZTI,"It was great seeing Bella come into her own. The new Vampires were great to see. The ending was a surprise, but great to watch. The ending in a book doesn't always translate to film, but I think they captured what we are seeing and what was written great.",1364169600,,255,4.224489795918367
4998347,5,B006JM1ZTI,Bought this for my wife. She's really into Twilight. Never had a chance to take her to the movies. Waited until it came out on DVD and bought it as a surprize.

4998350,5,B006JM1ZTI,I'm a huge Twilight fan so I had seen this movie in the theaters. But I enjoyed watching it again at home. Amazon doesn't disappoint when you pre-order a title and get it the day it releases.,1364169600,,191,4.1891891891891895
4998351,2,B006JM1ZTI,"The books were soooo much better. K Stewart can do mopey human, not breathtaking vampire. If you've seen the first 4, you might as well finish it.",1364169600,,146,4.444444444444445
4998352,4,B006JM1ZTI,"I am a huge Twilight fan, I waiting to so long to see this movie.  I was a little dissappointed, maybe I was expecting more, not sure.  It was very good...I guess I just like to read better than I like movies.  All in all, good buy.",1364169600,,232,3.893617021276596

4998354,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I almost didn't buy this one because of the previews. that big battle  didn't happen in the book, loved the book. it took a couple of times to really get that the battle we see was a vision of Alice of what would or could happen IF he held the course he was on.",1364169600,,261,3.8333333333333335
4998355,5,B006JM1ZTI,Omg it was a really good movie. my husband liked it too and he is not even into movies like these.,1364169600,,98,3.7142857142857144

4998358,4,B006JM1ZTI,Great movie BUT.. if I wish it came with an Amazon digital copy and not iTunes or Vudu. I like all my digital copies to be in one place. I guess if the movie is made by Universal you get a choice of Amazon. Otherwise.. I LOVE this movie! Great end to a saga!!! :),1364169600,,263,3.8

4998361,5,B006JM1ZTI,"Excellent! Particularly liked learning how the movie was made. Would recommend to anyone who does not have the two disc copies of any of the Twilight movies, that they get them. Learning what goes into to making ""movie magic"" makes the movie much more interesting.",1364169600,,264,4.888888888888889
4998362,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I couldn't wait for this last movie to show up, I have read the series over five times, trying to seem if I missed anything. Stephanie Meyer has done a brilliant job with all her books, can't wait to see what she is doing next.",1364169600,,227,4.066666666666666

This movie is by far the best one and the director did a great job making it interesting. From reading the book it made me wonder what movie you could make out of the second part of the book because the book did drag on.",1364169600,,354,4.071428571428571

My 24 rental, however, did not work on my kindle and in order to view the ultra-violet copy I had to jump through a bunch of hoops compared to when I bought the Hunger Games and all I had to do was download it.",1364169600,,291,4.0
4998367,2,B006JM1ZTI,A mild improvement in a flaccid and lackluster series that was forgotten seconds after the looooooong credit sequence. And there were so many emo songs I thought I was watching a musical about vampires.,1364169600,,202,4.970588235294118

4998380,4,B006JM1ZTI,Loved the books.  Thought the first 2 movies were kinda cheesy. So... I didn't even bothered seeing #3 & #4. I heard the last movie was the best so I decided to rent it.  Liked it!  Special effects were much improved!  The end-of-the-movie acting credits were awesome!  Who knew credits could have such great cinematography?,1364083200,,324,4.818181818181818

4998387,2,B006JM1ZTI,"Okay the graphics on this one could have been much better. I get that the baby is growing at a significantly fast rate but seriously the child looked like an alien, when she was supposed to be this beautiful half-breed creature. The effects that they put on her was just creepy.
The back and forth between Bella and Edward was most of the movie and incredibly too much. Nutshell, ooh we love each other, oooh I'm stoked about new powers, ooh I love the baby, ooo we love each other, oooh I'm stoked about new powers, ooooh I love the baby...oh yea I'm crazy hungry but I'm more talented than other vamps in that I can immediate turn away human blood. Oh and there's a threat coming. Then super crazy fight and oh wait...psyche...it was all a vision that didn't really happen...everyone is happy in the end. All of which equals a huge wast of my time.

However, all that being said, the best part of it was the exposure of the wolf clan to Bella's dad and the epic dream sequence fight that they actually did get right (until you learned it was a vision)",1364083200,,1053,4.372448979591836

There were no comments of awe and wonder, but a strong sigh when the twist was ""it was all a dream (vision)"".

4998392,3,B006JM1ZTI,"They Bobby Ewing'ed us at the end.  (Look it up, kids.)  We were, of course, pleasantly surprised by that.  Other than that, we had to pause it pretty often to exclaim how cheesy it was.  But hey, that's part of the charm of the Twilight movies, right?  And now we can say we've seen them all...or we could if we were actually willing to admit that to anyone we know.

4998397,1,B006JM1ZTI,what a stupid show and waste of money to rent it. This movie should have stopped with the second one and not made any more. For awhile I thought I was watching the Xmen show with the wolverine and all his helpers.,1364083200,,213,4.095238095238095

4998404,2,B006JM1ZTI,"You wait and wait to see this and at the very beginning when Bella pushes Jacob it was way way overdone.
More of the character Aro played by Michael Sheen should have been in these movies, I don't think anyone else could have played Aro, but then the character Aro (Michael Sheen) might have stolen the show from Kristen & Pattison in the older viewers eyes. I would have liked to have known more about Alice's character also.
It seemed like this finale was thrown together quick so everyone could get on with their other new movies, this was a shame for it's younger audience (if they noticed) who read the books and went to see all of the movies making this a money making record breaking movie.
Being an older viewer I never thought I would like ""Twilight"", after I rented it, I was hooked and looked forward to the rest, a love story with vampires flying through the air and people turning into wolves, it was different alright but this finale a big let down.
This may sound crazy but I wouldn't mind seeing a movie about the Volturi with Aro, Alice, Jasper, Carlise and the rest of the vampire crew it would most likely be a bigger hit than this one. Thumbs down on Breaking Dawn Part 2.",1364083200,,1192,4.398190045248869

Wanting to make sure it was the disk, I played it on a different DVD player and TV,,,same result.  The cost to return plus the oriuginal freight charges made it to costly to return.  Just bought a new one at Walmart instead.  Won't order from this company again.",1363996800,,414,4.48

4998419,4,B006JM1ZTI,"In this final installment of the ""Twilight"" series, the saga ends. I am sorry to see it go. I have read/listened to the ""Breaking Dawn"" book four or five times and never seem to get tired of this final installment.

The resolution of the Cullen clan's rift with the Italian ""vampire royalty"" is accomplished in a fascinating way as the Cullens gather a group of witnesses from around the world to attest to the fact that Renesmee is intelligent and not a threat to the secret of their existence among humans. I found the gifts exhibited by the witness group to be fascinating and the portrayal of them onscreen effective.

I would like to see Stephanie Meyer pursue the relationship between Jacob and Renesmee as she matures.",1363996800,,725,4.700787401574803

4998421,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I had read a review that said Breaking Dawn could have been done in just one movie, but I disagree. The story would have lost alot. I think the directors did a very nice job of discribing the battle but it did change the story plot and ending from that of the book .  I hope we will get another series about the future of the Cullens and the new vampires that were introduced in the final chapter!",1363996800,,397,4.089743589743589

4998442,1,B006JM1ZTI,"Movie seemed to be thrown together and did not flow as well as some of the other movies.
It took multiple movies to get Bella to finally become a vampire and it felt as if that area was not explored well.

The twist however was a plus.",1363910400,,235,4.0

Don't the vampires know that if they pet the Werewolves on their stomachs they will have a friend for life?  They could also get a leash out and promise a walk, but really talk them to the Vet.  That would teach em.

If the acting and writing were worse it could maybe have been an ironic funny B movie but the fact that so many pre-teens base their life around Twilight has me depressed and not bothering to lift the toliet seat in such a cruel and bizarre world that proclaims this garbage as a movie.  Give me Fright Night or Dusk Till Dawn as worthwhile vampire flicks.  Even The Lost Boys is several steps up from this.  RIP Corey Haim.",1363824000,,729,4.2773722627737225

With all of the movies - they didn't compare to the perfection of the books.  Praise goes not to the directors with the exception of Twilight New Moon -  but to Stephanie Meyers who wrote an incomparable series for young and old alike about love and honor and family.  The movies made fade out in time but the Twilight story will last forever.",1363737600,,513,4.141414141414141

4998504,5,B006JM1ZTI,Enjoyed the last part of the Twilight Saga.  It was definitely better than what I expected it to be. Gave the book Justice.,1363737600,,123,4.3478260869565215
4998505,5,B006JM1ZTI,"This completes my wife's collection.  She is a Twilight Saga ""fanatic"".  She says the movie is great, but has a sad ending.  I haven't watched any of the Twilights, only bits and pieces.  Parts I did watch were good.",1363737600,,216,4.461538461538462
4998506,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I love the movie. It made me cry at the end. I thought that everybody was going to die, but they didn't because it was only Allison's future vision of what will happen.",1363737600,,168,4.121212121212121
4998507,5,B006JM1ZTI,Very good ending and big surprise.  Liked that they left it open at the end so you might have to guess as to what will happen next.,1363737600,,131,3.8518518518518516
4998508,5,B006JM1ZTI,"The entire Twilight Saga - I read all the books and these movies are just as good as the books.  Breaking Dawn II has a different ending but it captivates the person watching, so you get the scare of your life and then a peaceful ending.  This movie deserves six stars!",1363737600,,269,4.254901960784314
4998509,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I find the series amazing, well done, superb acting. This is, in my opinion, the best of the series. I have watched it twice and will probably watch it again.",1363737600,,158,4.3
4998510,5,B006JM1ZTI,What can I say?  I am a Twi-mom and loved the whole series - all the books and all the movies!  It was great to be able to share this series with my teenage daughter.  I was genuinely surprised at the twist in the end of the movie (as it was a departure from the book) but I think it really helped make the movie better and added action to what could have been sort of bland in a movie.  A very satisfying ending to the story.  I love that everyone gets their happy ending and will happily revisit these movies for years to come.,1363737600,,529,4.0

4998513,5,B006JM1ZTI,I really enjoyed this movie I think it was the best out of the trilogy. I was a little disappointed that I had to wait till the following Monday after its release for it to arrive. I won't pre order again I can get it faster after release at the store,1363737600,,251,3.9411764705882355

4998516,5,B006JM1ZTI,The twist at the end was almost more than I could bear watching it for the first time in the theatre.  It still got me both times I viewed it after.  Loved it.,1363737600,,159,3.787878787878788

I watched them so I could say I'd seen them but I can't really recommend them. The acting was ok, the dialogue was ok, the characters were ok.  It was all just ok.  I did like the twist they ended at the end of this last one though.",1363737600,,388,4.092105263157895
4998518,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I watched this series because my girlfriend asked me to. I don't do horror. I found out this is much more than that. A Love story, wrapped with friends, and topped off with destruction for a reason. No unnecessary blood and gore. Just a nice blend of all. Really glad I watched it.",1363737600,,281,4.320754716981132
4998519,2,B006JM1ZTI,"I really only watched this because it was the end of the series, I'm not a rabid Twilight fan. The movie didn't stand at all by itself. The acting was poor (not surprised). And the end fight scene with all the heads flying just got weird. The wolves once again looked amazing and the scenery was beautiful. The little girl was well cast and perfect for the part. It's not something I would bother watching again.",1363737600,,412,4.434210526315789

4998523,3,B006JM1ZTI,Happy conclusion to the series.  The movie moves along without cutting out points in the plot to a bad effect.  Fans of the book should approve o the screen play.  Speaking of effects - the special effects were well done without being over powering.  I misdeed  it in theaters but glad to catch it on Amazon.,1363737600,,308,4.428571428571429

When I sat down to watch the movie that I was so excited to watch since it's the last part of the saga, it started freezing and skipping!!!!!! This has never happened with previous movies I have purchased through Amazon. You can not imagine how disappointed I am with this purchase and how upset I am. I purchased a brand new, just released dvd and it does this? Not happy at all and I hope someone from costumer service reads this review.",1363651200,,521,4.2727272727272725

4998534,1,B006JM1ZTI,I suppose right off the bat you should know that I'm a male writing this review. My wife forced me to watch it with her. I started off just like any other cap movie. bad acting and ridiculous overdramatization. It started off hard to watch and ended up being impossible to watch. I had to leave the room and vomit a little. I didn't go back.,1363651200,,341,4.181818181818182

4998541,5,B006JM1ZTI,"THe only downfall is I subscribed to Amazon Prime to receive our favorite movies, dvds, and video games on release date. Amazon stated because the twilight movies come out on Saturday that I can't receive them until the Monday after.  I was very upset.  I honestly subscribed because of that receive on release date feature. I know both UPS and Fed Ex and the good old USPS (right now) alll deliver on Saturday and that was my biggest down fall about this.  I was going to go out and get a midnight but Amazon had already taken the money out of my account by then.

4998556,1,B006JM1ZTI,"I waited FOREVER to watch this since I'd read the book and was disappointed in the slow ending. The movie has become too Hollywoodish..meaning..the tender, innocent beauty that Bella showed in Twilight is long gone. Why did everyone who had blond hair in Twilight have black hair and only wear black clothes in the last 2 movies? The best part of the movie was the imagined scene that Alice showed Argo..that was a nice Hollywood vampire fight..very nice..but as Bella showed Edward a steam of memories of their relationship from beginning to end..the most beautiful moments were from Twilight and New Moon.",1363564800,,607,4.96078431372549

It is a pain to buy a set thinking you are getting one thing and then hear that another store has completely different stuff on their video. This is not an amazon complaint. Movie shipped quickly and we had a digital rental to tide us over until it came. I love that this version did come with an iTunes version.

Next gen, especially girls, this kind of love doesn't exist.  I know you want an amazing out of this world super-intense love, but it doesn't exist.  It's not real.

This series from the very beginning has been trolling young twihards into thinking that their fantasies are actually being taken seriously, and then simultaneously mocking said twihards.  This applies even more so to the last two movies- it's obvious that the writer & director (and especially Michael Sheen) are intentionally in on the joke.  Well, it's safe to say that they succeeded (by over $3 billion, in fact).

4998583,1,B006JM1ZTI,"Wow, this is such an awful movie. Note to script writers: If these vampires had lived for centuries, they would be educated, interesting and wise - and probably have a sense of humor. To live for centuries and be that boring would truly be a fate worse than death. How could such a dull plot and expressionless acting (except for the wolves) possibly have received such high ratings? Eye candy? When it's clear that the movie had some visual imagination and a huge budget, it's too bad the producers couldn't spring for some equivalent dialogue.",1363478400,,545,4.747368421052632

Even though there may be a lot of negative talk about this movie or whole saga, but don't let that talk get to you. If they were really bad than why are they continuously making millions and then some?This comment is just my OPINION just like EVERYONE else on here.

Looking at the plot of the final book and how the last two movies played out I can only say, after seeing them both, that this is no way warranted two separate films.  They turned what could have been a passable movie into a disgusting killer of 5 hours of my life purely for the sake of $$$.  Movie ratings should be on the story of the film, the acting, and the execution of the idea.  We already know the story, so at this point we're left with the acting and the execution.  Both of which failed.  Being a fan of this book series in no way justifies rating this movie beyond what it deserves.",1363478400,,667,4.1640625
4998596,2,B006JM1ZTI,"Watched this with my sis as she really likes the series. The cinematography is stunning. The story is still topical, with the feel of a cliff notes outline. Also, subtle emotions are missing. When someone calls her daughter 'Nessy' the lead screams with deadpan seriousness at him, ""You named my daughter after a sea monster!?"" where was the wry sarcasm in that to make it work? It was as if he'd called the baby a whore instead of something totally silly.",1363478400,,456,4.6419753086419755

*No more dating drama- Bella has her guy and there is no more teenage competition.
*The  fight scenes are pretty cool.
*There is finally resolution and you don't have to see another twilight movie again.

Negatives:
*Not the best acting
*stupid vampire sex scene- i don't care to see that. The last one had enough to last a lifetime.
*The movie is geared more for teens and doesn't really impress or captivate most adults.

Overall, if you have watched other twilight films watching this on is worth it just to see how it all wraps up. If you haven't watched any or watched one and hated it, then don't waste your time with this one.",1363478400,,681,4.475806451612903

4998610,1,B006JM1ZTI,"An insult to the intelligence of the sub-average human.

Bella is unable to see her newborn baby for the first two days as she's enduring the vampire transformation.  When finally untied with her 2-day old daughter, she doesn't weep.  She does kiss her.  She holds her like a chubby baguette for roughly 60 seconds and then passes the child on so she can lay down this way more important line:  ""You named nick-names my daughter after the Loch Ness monster?""

And from there on it's arm wrestling and close-ups of most nauseated-looking Englishman you'll ever see outside a methadone clinic.  And who knew vampire sex was so much like baptist congregation building?

All together, this movie should be taken as an attack on the female youth of the nation.  We adults should rise up in their defense.  I'm sure Kirsten Stewart is a sweet boy, but he's not the right role model for a generation of girls who will some day rule the world.",1363392000,,935,4.646341463414634

Anyone who likes the Twighlight series would love this movie. My only complaint is with the digital copy (seems only available for iPad, or idevices) and the ultraviolet. The new Kindle fire hd does not support the software to use this. It's extremely frustrating.

4998633,5,B006JM1ZTI,"They REALLY needed to include the extra fight scene that wasn't part of the book.  In Breaking Dawn, I admit, I was so disappointed that more wasn't done when the entire Volturi entourage head all the way across the ocean from Italy to Washington state to confront the Cullens about an immortal child and the Cullens talk their way out of it yet again.  Lol
Not a very earth shattering climax and like me, left the reader wanting more.  Throw a punch for cryin' out loud.  Blah!

Sorry Stephenie, but Summit Entertainment was right on the money adding this scene.  Like me in the theater, when it got to the part of realizing that Aro was only being shown a ""this could be you"" scene if he chose this path, I gasped liked the rest of the audience and Summit knew we all would do that and therefore, this move was extremely successful.

I think each installment had it's moments, but like many many other reviews, the first movie and then this one, the last, were the best.
No.  Not everyone has to like it and there have been so many insults hurled at this saga but whatever....

It was nice watching Kristen grow up through the movie.  Her acting improved somewhat and when they show her in a montage scene at the end, she really had a baby face in the first Twilight and you don't realize that she matured and seemed older until you see different clips from each movie.
She grew up right in front of our eyes.

I would love a continuation of the series going in the direction of Jacob and Renessmee.  In the books, the Cullens would still be a part of the story of course, but I don't know how they'd do a movie because the vamps don't age and Jacob and Nessie do naturally.
If I were Meyer and raking in all the glory from all of this, I'd be writing a surprise continuation of Twilight.

Like I have said on a few other reviews of this saga, I have always given high praise and credit to Michael Sheen for stealing all the scenes he's in.  He and the other two of his Volturi buddies do a great job of creeping you out.  Marcus, (Christopher Heyerdahl) does that slow turn with his head and he does this strange long exaggerated sigh that works perfectly for him.  He has the smallest role, yet manages to freak a person out because he's that good.
Jamie Bower's deal was that wonderful sinister look he'd give with that very slight curve of a smile (Caius).  All three of them took the small amount of screen time they had and made it fantastic.

I had always always wished the Volturi had a bigger part in the entire story.",1363305600,,2529,4.333333333333333
4998634,4,B006JM1ZTI,"Entertaining.  Not worth buying but a good watch.  Liked the twist at the end.  If you are looking for great acting, this is not the movie, but it's entertaining if you are into Vampires.",1363305600,,187,4.4411764705882355

4998636,2,B006JM1ZTI,The reason why I gave this two stars instead of one was because it didn't go by the book and there was a nice surprise at the end.

Some ppl never learned the first time i guess. How many times did it take you sticking your hand on a hot stove before your figured out it was hot? Anyway, the movie was great.

They already made two movies out of it, why not make the second one a little longer than two hours anyway. The beginning especially was awkward and rushed, and the characters all lacked depth (especially since there were so many just thrown in with hardly any introduction). Definitely the worst movie out of the whole series.",1363305600,,416,4.712328767123288

4998676,5,B006JM1ZTI,"This is by far the besty Twilight movie!  BEWARE SPOILER ALERT!!

I believe in a movie the twist that was added made for a better experience than in the book.

In this movie some of the major problems from Breaking Dawn Part 1 were corrected, I am speaking about the appearance of the Cullen's.  They all look more like the first 2 movies which is an improvement over BD 1.  During the fight I did have some questions.

Zaphrina was supposed to use her gift to keep everyone away from Bella, but she didn't, once the fight started there was no sign of Zaphrina or Senna.  If Zaphrina had accomplished her tasks Jasper and Carlisle would have faired better.  Also, I feel the illustation of Bella's shield could have been better displayed if Aro would not have stopped Alec from using his gift.  I also was happy with the illustration of Renesme's growth from a baby to the girl during the fight and also with the adult that was shown in Alice's vision towards the end of the film.  I could go on, but there is no need.  This movie showed even in the openning how much more money and effort went into the production .

Now to the Blu-ray.  The video was exceptional.  That should sum it up.",1363219200,,1189,4.36986301369863

4998680,3,B006JM1ZTI,The downloading was quick and easy but the actual movie was terrible. Poor acting and bad special effects. Books were better for sure.,1363219200,,134,4.869565217391305
4998681,4,B006JM1ZTI,There was no easy way to turn the last part of this book into any kind of easy movie for viewers with the books you have alot more detail but all in all they did a great job at showing Bella's transition from a human to a vampire and the actress Kristen Stewert who is always getting slammed for being such a bad actress did a very good job as the mother of Renesmee you could tell the actress was protective of her young co star and indeed she played a convincing vampire . The story is now over and it ended with a nice twist that was unexpected and very compelling < that should have been in the book somehow> Buy it its good to have the whole collection .,1363219200,,659,4.038167938931298
4998682,2,B006JM1ZTI,"Well, I'm not a teenage girl, for whom this kind of thing is done. From a young woman's point of view, perhaps this would meet her expectations for a romantic story.  But when sequels are done, so often there's a sense the plot and theme (if there is one) are treading on the same ground; it's just repetitious.  The problem from my personal perspective is that I hardly cared for the characters, especially for Stewart's character.  Why should I care for a girl who goes around with a bored, self-obsessed look on her face?  The best way the whole thing should end?  The vampires and werewolves should have a big fight and destroy themselves in it.  That would've been satisfying!",1363219200,4,681,4.633333333333334

4998693,1,B006JM1ZTI,"i was wrong. plot-wise, this thing is ridiculous. you have a villain who's a joke, 'recruiting' without success and leaving empty handed - no real casualties on either side and a fake battle. i'm not a bloodthirsty viewer but i feel something should really be at stake. there's a high of characters being able to do cool stuff but this is rookie simple.
seriously, the 'hidden' message for bella (is that her name) is laughable. sure, no one else would think to look at the book. she's super intelligent that way. oh btw she gives birth and instead of hanging out with her fast maturing child she goes off to have endless sex with edward (that's his name, right?)
and here's the real creeper: jacob 'imprints' himself on the baby girl, who he will eventually (in 7 years) make wonderful love to. i can't understand, ever and at all, how america and the rest of the world can think this is an ok plot twist. 'oh, i couldn't have your mother... well, i'll have the fruit of her loins'. why did i pay to see this? i teach college and it's been said that this is the film series of the 21st ct. tragic.",1363219200,13,1098,4.387254901960785

4998704,1,B006JM1ZTI,"Wow.  Where to begin?  Obviously, every Twilight movie up until now has been horrendous, in large part because they're based on, you know, the Twilight books.  Horrible writing, horrible messages (if your boyfriend leaves you, you should get all depressed and then try to kill yourself to bring him back; it is so romantic when your boyfriend is super controlling of your life; it is also SO romantic when, the morning after your wedding night, you wake up covered in bruises, because your boyfriend-turned-husband can't even control how attracted he is to you, resulting in actual physical damages; etc.), and horrible cinematography are par for the course with this series.  And yet . . . somehow this movie is even worse.  Maybe it's the creepy, computer-generated baby they use (apparently because no baby could ever be as cute as they wanted Renesme to look?); maybe it's the fact that a good 90% of the dialogue is spoken over dramatic music (apparently to hide the fact that they're not saying anything interesting); maybe it's the fact that the storyline is so halting and confused that it almost feels like a series of vignettes, especially with all the ridiculous flashbacks and flash-forwards; or maybe it's just, you know, these things and a million other horrible things.  I admit, my friends and I actually wondered aloud at several times whether the filmmakers had realized that these movies are sooooo bad and that such a large percentage of the audience is made up of people who are just there to make fun of it--and whether they had just decided that they would go ALL OUT and give us lots of material to work with.",1363219200,9,1633,4.814285714285714
4998705,3,B006JM1ZTI,This movie seemed like it was forced.  I don't think the director had enough for an entire second movie so there are a lot of pause's and moments to draw time out and make it seem longer.  It shouldn't take more then a few seconds to turn a light on...but this movie makes you watch it over the course of a few minutes.  The over all plot was ok...and the action was good.  The lighting on the movie seemed really bad...and this was in HD and SD.  I would not run out and pay for this movie but watching it via a 1 night rental was fine.,1363219200,,537,3.9813084112149535

The video got stolen from my front door, so I called Amazon and they sent me a new one the next day.  Gotta love Amazon Prime!",1363132800,,307,3.765625

4998733,5,B006JM1ZTI,"Although I'm a late comer to the Twilight Saga and outside of the typical demographics, (I am a retired professional and grandmother of 4), I read the books and and watched the movies upon the urging of my daughter who loved them.  I was skeptical but ended up loving the story.  For those who provided such harsh criticism, I would have to remind them that they are watching a fun teen/young adult love story, not Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.  I believe it was very effective in providing great entertainment to it's target audience as well as a nice escape from reality for the rest of us.  Sometimes it's nice not to take life so seriously and just allow yourself to enjoy something mindless without looking to find all it's flaws.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and found it to be the best of the series.  The actors have matured quite a bit and Bella as a vampire is much more entertaining than her mopey human self in the previous movies. The twist in this movie that deviated from the book was an added success as well.  If you've seen the first 4 movies, you will love this one.  If you haven't seen the others, start at the first one.  Developing a ""relationship"" with the characters make it even better.",1363132800,,1218,4.525114155251141

Will make anyone forced to watch with their daughter cry in general and hope it just ends.  I enjoyed it.  Ok, not really, but then you know It is so bad I couldn't stand the negatives.

4998742,3,B006JM1ZTI,"I think enough people have reviewed the actual movie - I didn't expect an Oscar contender, but I wanted to finish the series.  The thing I wanted to comment on specifically was the ability to order and view online on-demand.  The convenience of ordering online to view a movie immediately is super-convenient; but I don't think the technology has quite caught up with the concept.  I have a good fast solid internet connection, but even so, I had to tolerate the  ""sudden pause spinning wheel"" loading issue at least 3 times during this one movie.  It does reduce the enjoyment factor when you're having to wait for the movie to catch back up.  I had an issue with this whole series of having too many uber-dark scenes, but whaddya gonna do?",1363046400,,741,4.6183206106870225
4998743,1,B006JM1ZTI,"I really tried to give this series a fair chance at wowing me but in the end the movie ended in a most disappointing way.  I am sure this series was mostly created and directed for the teen age group but at least they could have made this a little more entertaining instead of the long stretches of nothing happening and the longing gazes made by Bella to her vampire ""boo"".  This series lacked the action that it seemed to promise in the beginning and instead ended with some imaginary battle that didn't in reality happen with the predictable ""they lived happily ever after"" ending.  To me, the acting lacked some real emotion and seemed flat and uninterested.  I thought this series had so much potential but in the end, it left me feeling deeply disappointed.  I realize there are lots of fans of the books and series, but seriously, you couldn't give it a more dramatic wrap up than that?",1363046400,6,893,4.521739130434782

4998753,5,B006JM1ZTI,"Like everyone else I could not WAIT to get this into my player. was I disappointed???? NO WAY. Kristen Stewart played a sweet schoolgirl in Twilight. with each new Twilight Saga movie she played the maturing Bella who had a few more problems todeal with than her fellow students did...to say the least! Some reviewers of Kristen claim she is not a good actress. I have followed her career since Panic Room wih Jodie Foster. I think I own every movie she ever made and there are MANY. Rach one more diffetent than the next. But I have to say that her portrayal of Isabella Marie Swan Cullen throughout the Twilight Saga is my favorite Kristen Stewart role (except perhaps ""The Cake Eaters"") (available on Amazon) which shows the range of her acting ability most aren't aware of) anyway I am just a 66yr old Grandma TwiHard. Just sorry the Twilight Saga has come to its end with this movie....come on Stephanie....how about more??!!

No, the books are not literature, and not particularly well-written, but they are romantic and fun.  I looked forward to the movies to see the characters I enjoyed reading about come to life.  Each movie had its disappointments. If a person was not a fan of the books, or hadn't read the books, the movies literally would have made no sense.  Having said all of that, I did enjoy this movie for the reasons stated, it brought to life the characters I enjoyed.  Was it a good movie? No it wasn't and I don't think any of the movies were ""good.""  I can't quite figure out why they couldn't make a decent movie from these stories but across the board they were slowly paced, uneven, and they missed so many wonderful moments from the books.

If you are a fan of the books, like me, you may get a kick out of watching the characters and some of the moments from Breaking Dawn come to life, but don't look for much more than that.",1363046400,2,1057,4.28643216080402

At first I didn't like the idea of these minor changes but as with everything else when you have time to think about it you realize that movies can't be exactly like the book or they would go on for hours more, plus some things just can't be translated to the big screen.  They can only be formed inside our heads as we read and it is a one on one personal translation of the words we are reading.  That is why I ended up liking the movies.

My roku isn't hooked up for HD.  Also the digital could only be viewed within 24 hours once started.  I'm not sure how ultraviolet truly works, but I suspect that my choices will be few since my TV/set-up is out of date.

I'm hoping that they don't come out with a newer version down the road that includes a few extra minutes.  Case in point: I knew from the get go that Lord of the Rings was going to have a full set and I assumed that there would also be extended versions (not by only a weak 7 minutes, LOL) so I waited for that set and was quite happy that I did.

I think Kristen Stewart finally gave a believable performance so guess she grew into the role.  Now I realize that the baby was supposed to be growing/aging faster than normal but the CGI face they put on her (and name, seriously?) was so ridiculous I thought for a second I was watching the baby in the E-Trade commercials - and the commercials are SUPPOSED to be funny.

4998813,4,B006JM1ZTI,"I am one of very few men in the world who actually find ""The Twilight Saga"" to be watchable. Most are dragged to the theater or plopped down on the couch at home against their will while their girlfriends or wives view them. My experience is the exact opposite. My wife hates the films and I'm forced to see them either alone or with my son amongst a sea of teens and their mothers whooping over Jacob or Edward.

Sometimes it can be hard to evaluate a film accurately sitting at a midnight screening surrounded by fanatics of the franchise. Surpisingly, my opinion of ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2"" didn't change much between seeing it in the theater and in a home entertainment environment. I would say it's by far my second favorite of the movies right behind ""Eclipse.""

""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2"" picks up with Bella awakening as a vampire and trying to control her powers and thirst. Edward and Bella's child, Renesmee, is growing at an incredible speed. This makes the Volturi nervous, which in turn causes Aro to investigate the child and decide if she poses a danger to the existence of vampires.

Meanwhile, the Cullens travel the globe and gather witnesses to prove to the Volturi that Renesmee isn't a threat to the vampire's way of life and anonymity. When the Volturi travel to Forks to confront the Cullens, Jacob and his werewolf friends join Bella and her new family in what could be a battle to the death for many.

Director Bill Condon does a good job with pacing for ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2."" Although most of the real action doesn't come to the very end, he keeps things interesting through international travels and the suspense of what the Volturi are going to do to rid themselves of Renesmee and the Cullens.

I do have a couple complaints about the movie. The CGI is less than spectacular. Most sequences with CGI are overly glossy and way too noticeable. Renesmee as a baby is a perfect example of this problem. Edward and Bella's run through the woods tests the limits of the movie's budget for more green screen work as well.

Some of the acting comes across as a bit awkward and over-dramatic at times as well. However, it fits with the soap opera-like tone of the movie. Let's just say it will find a nice home on the Lifetime Movie Network a few years from now after FX is done with it.

Special features for the Blu-ray version of ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2"" kick off with audio commentary by Director Bill Condon. Twi-hards will be happy to know there is an in-depth one and a half hour documentary on the making of the film entitled ""Forever Filming 'The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2."" There's also a six minute featurette about shooting two films at one time entitled ""Two Movies at Once."" Green Day's video for ""The Forgotten"" is included as well.

The audio and video high definition transfers are picture perfect. At times, this works against it as it exposes the limitations of the CGI work. It's much easier to cover some of those flaws up on the big screen. The dialogue, special effects, musical score, and soundtrack all use the full extent of the 7.1 surround sound mix to their advantage.

""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2"" is a fitting end for the franchise. It ties everything up quite nicely while not completely shutting out the possibility of another movie at some point. A rather smart twist in its third act elevates this movie above the rest of the entries in the series. Although I do have to say that as a whole, ""Eclipse"" is still my favorite with this coming in at a close second.",1362960000,,3622,4.551459293394777

4998831,2,B006JM1ZTI,"**Spoilers**I was really looking forward to this movie.  My friends promised me that it was much better than Breaking Dawn Part I.  Unfortunately, the bar set by Part I was not high.  I LOVED Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse.  Breaking Dawn Part I was a huge disappointment.  I was not able to see this in the theaters . . . or, who am I kidding?  I could have seen it in the theater for date night.  However, Part I was so bad that I could not stand the idea of my husband having more fodder to make fun of me.  So, I waited until the family was asleep to watch the movie.

OMG - what was up with the CGI baby.  It was so creepy.  Damn, just hire an alert looking cute baby.  It is not that hard.  There was very little verbal interaction between Edward and the child (I refuse the use the ridiculous name).  I personally think that the movie should have stayed much closer to the book.  The movie was only 115 minutes.  There was more time to develop the new characters and show more of Bella's vamp training.  The back story needed to have been developed more.  All of the additional (not in the book) scenes were completely unnecessary. The clue from Alice should have been done better.  J Jenks should have been done better.  So much could have been done better.

I think the anticipation and test of wills in the final showdown would have been much better as it is written instead of what happened.  The necessity of the witnesses for the Voultari was barely discussed.  The surprise from South America was barely discussed.  And Kristen Stewart looked like a total hot mess.  She really looked like she needed to snack on some fatties so she would not look so anorexic.  Don't tell me that she has to look similar to how she did right when she was changed.  Meyer screwed with the mythos already.  Least that could have been done was to make Bella more attractive was to give her some extra fleshyness.

As someone who read and re-read these books, I am so disappointed.",1362960000,7,1976,4.3812154696132595

4998848,4,B006JM1ZTI,"I've always thought the Twilight books were better than the movies and that some movies resembled their respective ""books"" more than others- I liked them all anyway even though there was often a ""why did they change/do that!?"" factor to the adaptations. Breaking Dawn part 2 was, in my opinion, much closer to Stephenie Meyer's version than part 1 was. The big battle sequence at the end, while visually impressive, minimized Bella's ""power"" and gave Alice a greater role. It looked good but i liked the book better. Not bad for an adaptation- considering what Hollywood usually does to a book.

Some of the reviewers- I think must not have read any of the books. The whole Twilight series of movies seems to have relied on the fans knowing what's going on- which leaves the casual viewer completely lost at times because they haven't read the relevant book. I, and so many others, have read the books- we can recognize a scene even if it isn't in book form- we understand the bits left unexplained to the uninitiated. Breaking Dawn part 2 will go better if you've read at least the second part of the book.
I liked the closing credits better than the opening credits, nice touch- sort of a last salute to so many past cast members (including both Victorias).

Very nice set of extras with this one, as good as any in the series? Fascinating how they achieved everything although I did think the process of adapting Mackenzie Foy's face to the other girls bodies didn't work very well (the computer generated baby(ies?) especially awkward). Well worth watching this stuff. One extra not listed on the packaging but present is the Green Day video for ""The Forgotten"", I'd seen it listed either on the UK or Australian editions and wondered why we weren't getting it- maybe it's present on all editions, listed or not. One good reason not to buy a foreign release just for one little extra.

4998863,3,B006JM1ZTI,"""Breaking Dawn Part 2,"" directed by Bill Condon and written by Melissa Rosenberg, brings the adaptation of Stephanie Meyer's Twilight series to a conclusion, giving fans a glimpse at the ""forever"" life and love that their favorite vampire couple and their incorporated families will be experiencing without the intrusion of cameras rolling. Achieving all the peak moments of the novel within a film version of over two hours is asking a lot.  It has a lot of ground to cover with issues building and snowballing from the other three novels to resolve--each of which could be a film in itself.  In order to meet fan expectation, Bella and Edward must be seen as the lovers and partners they were meant to be; they must get their romantic happily-ever-after amidst the stress of immediate parenthood to a hybrid child whose destiny as either a vampire or human is unknown. As Bella's jilted suitor, Jacob must discover a love of his own.  Bella's father must be primed to accept her rebirth as a vampire and Bella herself must come to understand herself not only as a new vampire with powers and strengths of which she never dreamed, or as a member of the Cullen family that will exist forever, doing whatever it is they do for eternity, but as a 19 year-old wife and mother, the responsibility of which sends many ""normal"" and much older women into a tale-spin.  Add to all these abrupt changes the advent of the Volturi who impose a direct threat on the lives of Bella's new family because the nature of her daughter Renesmee may eventually harm the entire vampire race.  It is no wonder Meyer's novel (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breaking-Dawn/dp/8876250441/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breaking Dawn</a>)spans over 750 pages.

Does this film version successfully show the outcome of Bella's decision to become a vampire as the positive resolution of all of her struggles regarding herself depicted in all of the novels?  It really tries.  However, the climatic ending of the film devotes much time, energy and action to an exciting battle scene of grand proportion, visually pleasing the eyes, but leaving little time to concentrate on more mellow themes with any real depth.

Fans may disagree that the first Twilight film directed by Catherine Hardwicke did not portray the characters correctly for die-hard Twilight fans. At least, that first Bella and Edward franchise accomplished its mission and depicted the angst of a 100-year-old vampire and his wannabe girlfriend as high school students experiencing first love even if one of them has the temperature of a dead fish and the other looks as if she cracked a smile her face would freeze. The Twilight soundtrack (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight-Soundtrack/dp/B001ED7C58/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight Soundtrack</a>) puts together some great alternative music and Carter Burwell's Bella's Lullaby captures the sense of forbidden love in one of the most beautiful piano pieces written in a long time.

""Breaking Dawn, Part 2"" in comparison seems like an afterthought, with just a slight nod to the all important theme of the once klutz-y and introverted Bella of Twilight finally coming into her own and finding her place as a mother, wife and protectress to her newfound vampire family.  Instead this film seems like a vampire Who's Who for fans who simply cannot bear to not know how Hollywood depicts Twilight author Stephanie Meyer's global cavalcade of supernatural characters who decide to aid the Cullens by protecting Edward (Robert Pattinson) and Bella's (Kristen Stewart) hybrid offspring Renesmee from the Volturi who declare that any `Immortal Child' poses a danger to the tribe and must die.

The audience already knows from the ending of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Twilight-Saga-Breaking-Dawn-Part-1/dp/B006TLFPKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1</a>&nbsp;that Jacob (Taylor Lautner who, of course, predictably shows off his bare wolfcake chest in a sequence where he reveals his ""otherness"" to Bella's father (Billy Burke)) has imprinted (it's a wolf thing) on the infant Renesmee and, thankfully, as both Meyer and the filmmakers understand that big boy Jacob's fixation on a baby could be interpreted as pedophilia, allow the tot to be a victim of what soap opera shows call rapid aging syndrome.  What else could they do? Nonetheless, her growth spurts do not sprout fast enough; the child, a disturbing and distorted amalgam of digital graphics and actual children, is safely shown mostly with Jacob in CG wolf form--this girl and trusty dog version most likely considered more tasteful than the hybrid/human alternative. Courtesy of an Alice vision, the audience gets a glimpse of Jacob and an older more glamorous Renesmee caressing each other while Bella and Edward look on.  All are forever young, in love and complete as a foursome now rather than an awkward trio.

Although the other films, Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse, depict the Cullen's in a cheerfully humorous manner--the clan cuts up together and roast each other with the same aplomb as any real family--in Breaking Dawn, Part 2, the goofy Brady Bunch camaraderie aspect of this seems more evident, more a substitute for an actual storyline and definitely not as well-received or forgiven. Every one of the vampires seems overly stylized and uber-Botoxed with neatly trimmed eyebrows and carefully selected Eurotrash clothes.

As one of the newly initiated, Kristin Stewart perpetually sports her signature frown; her status as vampire does not change her uncomfortable demeanor no matter how polished a skin her rebirth affords her. Understandably, her family is in dire jeopardy, but Kristin's Bella doesn't smile enough to validate her very serious decisions or the fact that she is really happy.  Her ability to ""shield"" is explained too quickly and without the momentous impact it should have on a girl that is so awkward she can barely walk in high heels.

Bottom line? ""Breaking Dawn, Part 2"" tries so hard to resolve all the issues and loose ends of the previous films, but ends up, battle scene aside, as a glossy photo album whose theme is ""All's well, that ends well."" Sure, fans get to see Bella and Edward living in happily wedded bliss in their fairytale cottage and later watching on as an older Renesmee and forever-young Jacob enjoy their mutual feelings. And this may be enough.  However, much of Bella's conclusions about herself as expressed in the novel are skimmed over rather than focused upon.  Again, those who are fanatically extremely familiar with the novels will fill in the blanks and revel in this final segment of the saga of their much beloved characters.  Recommended only for those who need to see Bella as a vampire, or want to watch a vampire battle extraordinaire.

4998885,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I chose a 5 star rating on this movie because it was the best of all 5 movies in this saga. Bill Condon did a fabulous job directing plus all of the actors from the very famous to the not as famous gave it their all to make this the best movie I have ever seen. The people who created the houses, rooms in the houses, wolves, scenery, music, all of the clothing actors wore, the writing of the screen play as well as the book itself was outstanding. Of course, you have to watch all 5 movies to be able to give any opinion at all. At first, as I was reading the books, waiting for the DVD's to come out, I thought the writing was geared more towards early teen to late teens. Stephenie Meyer is no Stephen King as far as her writing goes, sorry. But, what people generally want in a movie is to feel good while and after watching them. They want to be entertained and leave their own problems behind them for 2 hours. The story in all 5 movies and books does just that. They leave you feeling good over the sweetest love story I have ever seen and you feel good after you watch them giving you the intense feelings of impatience waiting for the next movie to come out. This movie ends greatly and you feel sad it's all over, you still want more. I would recommend this to everyone, as well as the first 4. I am not telling the story as I have seen others do, in the event that there is someone out there who actually has not seen The Twilight Saga, and wants to. Good investment, go for it. I loved it, obviously.",1362873600,,1513,4.114864864864865

4998892,4,B006JM1ZTI,the movie was good but you can definitely tell a different director did these last 2 parts of this Saga.  All the hype up to this one isn't exactly what I would have wanted to see.  I personally like the very 1st one of this saga (twilight) & loved the 4th one( Breaking Dawn part 1) and I think this last last one could have been shortened & included with Breaking Dawn pt. 1.  Still love the entire saga and I recommend it to anyone looking to see fantasy/love story.  I never thought I would like any of this until I saw the previews of Breaking Dawn pt. 1 and realized there was a human having a vampire baby & I just couldn't possibly understand that so I had to purchase the first 3 before I went to the movies to see these last two.  What can I say....  It kinda sucked me in.,1362787200,,783,4.0519480519480515

I am not going to spoil the movie for people who have not seen it but there are going to be parts your mouth will drop to the floor!! Enjoy as I did.

4998895,4,B006JM1ZTI,The reason I rated The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2  4 out of 5 is because it says UltraVoilet copy which it is but I also thought all & I mean all UltraViolet movies comes with a 2 or 3 dollar that adds to your UltraViolet account to rent a movie but this Movie didn't come with one. Also if you don't use your money for Movie rental to buy or Rent a movie ULTRAVIOLET TAKES THEM FROM YOU I DON'T THINK THATS RIGHT AT ALL. ONE OTHER THING I DISLIKE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CREDIT CARD ON FILE AFTER 60 TO 90 DAYS AFTER MAKING YOUR VUDU ACCOUNT. YOU STILL GET TO KEEP MOVIES YOU ALREADY HAVE ADDED TO YOUR ACCOUNT JUST HAVE TO ADD CREDIT CARD ON FILE TO ORDER MOVIES OR WHATEVER DON'T LIKE THAT FEATURE. For those of you who don't know when you go to WALMART and get your old movies put on VUDU WALMART STAMPS ITS LOGO ON ALL YOUR MOVIES WHEN YOU PAY THEM TO PUT IT ON VUDU I DONT LIKE THAT YOU PAID THEM TO PUT YOUR DVD ON VUDU NOW THEM STAMP THERE LOGO ON IT THAT SOUNDS FISHY ON WALMARTS PART SOMETHING DOESNT SOUND RIGHT THERE I THINK I SEE A LAW SUIT COMING SOON THERE. I would recommend this to anyone tho this movie is a good movie somethings i would have made different but they wrapped the end of the series good.,1362787200,4,1226,3.943548387096774

Characters are flat and cartoonish, the plot is thin and predictable, and the execution revolves around adolescent-minded lust that conquers all.  The long cameo-studded credits at the end were more captivating than any of the action or ""dialogue.""  The whole charade is perfect for anyone who enjoys an immediately accessible, passive movie-going experience.  There is nothing profound and lingering to this storyline.  It's not a storyline so much as a long list of visually exaggerated details punctuated by occasional trite banter masquerading as heartfelt affection and empathy.  A discussion of how accurately the author portrays provincial or pubertal fantasy is worth two hours; this film is not.

If you're a fan of the original Dallas you'll know what I mean when i reference the Bobby Ewing shower scene.

Overall the movie was good, some exciting scenes, some humorous ones as well. Romance...eh. Not so much. Characters remain likeable, especially Kellan Lutz (Emmett - gets hunkier with each episode). Wish more human wolves made appearances. They were mostly in wolf form throughout. Great to see Valturi's asses getting kicked. Wait, did that happen? Cast has good chemistry and nice to see a semi-degree of Jacob and Edward almost liking each other. Jackson Rathbone (Jasper) continues to have the best posture in the movie industry.

4998926,5,B006JM1ZTI,I get sick of all the crappy reviews making fun of the Twilight Saga's. I have read the books two times and watched the movies numbers of time.

4998931,1,B006JM1ZTI,Was not a huge breaking dawn fan to begin with but I stomached the prior movies. This movie felt rushed from the beginning. So many gaps in storyline compared to book. The dialogue was seriously laughable. The acting sub par. At the end I felt confused like what did I just watch. Only one good action scene. Was frankly quite bored almost stopped watching.,1362787200,4,357,4.59375
4998932,4,B006JM1ZTI,"If possible, I would have given it 3 1/2 stars. I rounded up since I liked it equally with the original one. (For different reasons.) Also know that I have read all the books and so it might be skewed on that premise.
I was really looking forward to the final movie(s) as I liked this book the best and felt the series should have been a trilogy with 'New Moon' and 'Eclipse' being one book. I was, naturally, disappointed with the decision to split it into 2 individual films, but understood the move. There was simply too much information to squeeze it into a single film. (Of course being able to split it and get more profits played into it as well, I'm sure.)
That being said, it is not a standalone movie, as anyone who has heard of 'Twilight' might guess. There are just too many things that don't make sense without, at least, the original one. I really liked the way the original one assumed a lot and let your mind do the work, where the others seem to rely more on the effects and actions. (Usually the difference between an indie-style film and a block-buster.) For a movie where the 2 primary characters (Bella and Edward) both have powerful gifts with an internally-based prowess, it seems ironic. I was really looking forward to the fight scene at the end and was not disappointed, though a bit surprised that they did not include (given their tendency in the movie) a visual representation of Bella's powers as described in the book. That was the one place I think it would have improved the scene.
In all, I enjoyed it and felt it was on par with the first one in emotion (though exceeding it in presentation) and was quite enjoyable throughout. It was very clear that they were trying to include as much of he book as possible, but still trying to fit in the blockbuster-style filming. A difficult task at best.",1362787200,,1829,4.479041916167665

And yet I found myself waiting and waiting for Part 2 to come out so I could rent it.  There's just something irrationally and irresistibly compelling about these Twilight stories, even though the writing in the books is awful, the plot is often thin, and the acting in the movies...yeah.  Anyway, I expected more of the same from this last movie in the series, but having gone this far, I felt the need to finish all of them.  I was actually pretty pleasantly surprised.  I think the screen writers looked at the turd of a book Stephanie Meyer handed them for this movie and decided to write it the way she should have.  I really enjoyed the twist they added to her original story, and the entire movie was less painful to watch than the previous four.  I would actually watch this again.",1362787200,,946,4.556213017751479

I'm not rating part one, but my biggest disappointment there was the lack of hearing so many of Jacob's thoughts.  It adds so much humor, so it's not so boring.  As for Part 2, my first disappointment came when Bella wakes up to her new life.  There was some great humor in this part of the book as well as several other places, and I felt the movie needed that.  Secondly, in this day and age, there are better options for making an infant look real.  Why not use a real one since Renesmee was supposed to look months old by the time Bella sees her anyway?  I'm okay with all the other parts, and even the ending.  I enjoyed the action that was added to the movie that we couldn't see in the book.  Even though that action was missing in the book, it was never lacking.  I bought the entire movie set, but I will continue to read the books more often.",1362787200,,970,4.161290322580645

4998948,5,B006JM1ZTI,"First off, let me say that I knew what I was getting before I ordered this. Yes, the special features are lacking but I knew they would be lacking when I purchased this. I read the description and I knew that there would be no deleted scenes or anything else special really except for the 7 part documentary. I think we all know that they might release another version with more special features in the future. I just wanted to enjoy the movie and whatever else is on the DVD for now.

My opinion on the movie itself? I loved it, and it just may be my favorite one. The special effects were great,and I love the twist they put at the end of the movie. I always recommend that you read the books before you watch the movies. Books are always better than the movie.",1362700800,,763,4.226027397260274
4998949,3,B006JM1ZTI,"This review is about the content of the home release.  The movie itself is fantastic.  I absolutely loved it.  I was looking forward to the Blu-ray release.  However, it is missing some things that are very disappointing.  There are no deleted scenes or extended scenes.  Every other movie in the series had these.  Perhaps they will release an extended version in the future but they should have had the deleted scenes here.

Also, there is only one audio commentary with director Bill Condon.  There is no audio commentary with any of the actors.  This makes three out of the five movies that lacked any actor's commentary at all.  I love the director's commentary and hearing how he made the movie.  However, the thing I really want to hear most is the actors stories and anecdotes about things that happened during filming, how they played certain scenes and the emotions and thoughts that they brought to the film, etc.  Even if certain actor's could not or did not want to participate, there were plenty of actors to choose from to do an audio commentary.  This was one of the most successful film franchises in history.  I am sure it was not the cost that prevented this.

As a comparison, the lord of the rings extended edition DVDs had three different commentaries for each film, one with the writers/director, one with the actors (many of them) and one with the effects people.  It was great.

As for the rest of the content, it was wonderful.  The feature on the making of the film was excellent.  I suggest watching it both stand alone and picture in picture.

I hope that they put out a special edition boxed set of the whole Twilight series with many extra features that were lacking in the already released versions.",1362700800,,1731,4.6655629139072845

4998971,1,B006JM1ZTI,"So it's finally over and thank God for that.  The most over-blown, over-hyped, over-extended movie series ever made has at long last limped to a close.  They even threw in a fake battle scene to try to liven up the moronic book ending.  Not that it helped very much.

""Breaking Dawn 2"" feels like a bunch of scenes that don't have much relation to each other strung together by a disjointed voice-over.  It doesn't even feel like a whole movie.  It's as if there was too much book for one film, but not enough for two.

I can't see what was the purpose of making these movies except to send a bunch of pre-pubescent Twihards into fits of joy and make some mediocre actors into instant gazillionaires.  Kristen Stewart gives her usual lip-biting, mouth-breathing, one-note performance as Bella, trying to look fierce during the climactic fake battle scene and managing only to look somewhat constipated.  Robert Pattinson, a much better actor, does what he can with the excruciating lines he has to say (""We're the same temperature now.""  Really?)  Billy Burke does his usual superb acting job as Charlie, Bella's dad, but some of the other supporting roles (Rosalie, for instance) have been so truncated they hardly have anything to say.  Except for Jacob, the wolves don't do anything but act wolfy.  And the Volturi are nowhere near as menacing as they were in ""New Moon"" and ""Eclipse"".  Jane, for instance, was a truly diabolical character, meting out excruciating pain with a baby-faced simper.  Now she's just standing around wearing too much eyeliner looking as bored as the viewer feels watching her.

(A few people asked that I put in the following caveat, so here goes a ***SPOILER ALERT***):
As for the fake battle scene, it did help to liven up a stupefyingly boring confrontation between the good guys and the bad guys, but why did it have to be fake?  It would have been infinitely more satisfying to see Alice really handing Jane a taste of her own medicine, or Bella and Edward handing Aro his head.  But as in the book, it's all a cheat.  Nobody dies, nobody even gets hurt; Aro sees the future through Alice and decides this is something that can wait a few millenia, and he and the rest of the Volturi run off with their tails between their legs, leaving the good guys to...

... to what?  What do these undead folks actually do all day?  Carlisle's an exception; he's a doctor, out doing some good in the world.  Esme keeps house.  But what about the rest of them?  Besides laying around and occasionally decimating the native wildlife population, what are Rosalie, Emmett, Jasper, Alice, Edward and Bella going to do for the rest of their endless existence?  We get through Alice's vision that at the ripe old age of seven, when she will be fully grown, Renesmee will run off with Jacob and they will settle down and breed a bunch of little werevamps and live happily ever after, so that leaves Bella and Edward facing empty nest syndrome for eternity with nothing ahead of them but the same ole same ole day in and day out and sooner or later probably boring each other into a coma.  Doesn't sound like much to look forward to.

So it's finally, finally, finally over.  No more sparkly vampires.  And please, Stephenie Meyer, no more godawful books to turn into godawful movies.  Peace out.

4998979,1,B006JM1ZTI,"I have to start by saying that I love Twilight and I love Stephanie Meyers. Her books are amazingly written and the entire series was so unique and different: page turning.  The first four movies I really enjoyed because I saw the books come alive on the screen- all of the scenese, conversations, people that I had imagined from Meyer's writing.  For the first four movies I saw each of tehm in theatres and purchased on DVD.  BD part 2 was the only movie of the series that I sat in the theatre watching with utter disappointment and even embarassment and did not see in duplicate.  I debated whether or not I should even purchase DVD, but after a shelf full of multiple copies of the Twilight books, the movie companions, and the DVDs, I thought ""well, let's give it another shot.""  Oh. It's still bad on DVD.

What I didn't like:
*the deviation from the novels. (by now you can figure it out from the trailers the whole ""new scene"" which wasn't entirely bad per se- but I felt betrayed because the first four movies were so similar to Meyer's original tales. But there is some new dialog that I really didn't like- and scene changes (Nessie's room full maxed out instead of empty like in the book). these might seem like sublities but to a Twilight fan.. I'm not amuzed.

*the acting. I felt that Kristen Stewart was really good as Bella-human but watching her try to portray Bella-vampire really made me doubt her as an actor. Bad. really bad translation. some of her moments are so stiff and starch and her dialog seemed forced- even off at times.  Some of the other Cullen's performances were less than what I grew to expect... and I couldn't stop thinking how sickly Stewart looked- her dramatic weightloss looks unhealthy and I'm supposed to believe she is this diamond hard strong vampire. Ugh.

*love scenese felt forced. I kept thinking, these two are/were a couple in real life during these scenes and- wow- I really didn't believe it. I didn't believe that they were Bella and Edward from the books let along Robert and Kristen real life couple.

*the baby. Rennesme looked almost animatronic at times. The baby was creepy- really creepy. There were points in the movie where I didn't want to even look at it- with the amazing CGI they did for the wedding adn the wolves from the previous movies- I really had high expectations- they were dropped.

*the music. I have all four soundtracks from the first movies with most of the mp3 tracks ripped onto my iphone and ipod. The songs selected for t his movie were really dull and monotone. I definetly didn't buy the sountrack this time around but I didn't even like the music or score in the movie- the songs seemed forced.

I wouldn't buy this DVD. I wouldn't bother watching the movie.  For those that are Twilight critics to begin with, please do not judge the whole series or the novels based on this movie.

to note: I still absolutely love some of the amazing actors and actresses that performed in BD part 2. I'm sorry, there presense wasn't enough to lift this one up for me.",1362614400,4,3045,4.553113553113553

4998993,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I wish there was not an end to the ""Twilight"" saga.  This was the best series that I have seen by far.  I also feel this series followed the books closely and tried to put in as many aspects as possible.  My boyfriend and I went to see ""Breaking Dawn Part 2"" together in theaters.  He is not as into the saga as I am, he just goes with because I make him.  He enjoyed the crowd more than the movie.  He laughed at the crowd's reaction to Alice's vision. He said you could hear everyone sigh with relief.  I think this movie was great.  It always kept you on your toes, never knowing what to expect next.  After seeing this video in theaters I was extremely confused.  I loved how the movie took you off course, but I had a hard time keeping track of who was killed.  I was almost in tears seeing everyone get killed.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  This is one where I could watch it over and over and never get sick of it.  ""Breaking Dawn Part 2"" was the perfect ending to the story.  Knowing that Bella and Edward can finally live in happiness and peace together is elating.  I would highly recommend the entire series.  It might be about vampires and werewolves, but you have to look past that and catch the love story.",1362614400,,1225,4.211206896551724

4999001,5,B006JM1ZTI,"If you're a Twilight fan, you're going to love this movie.  Simple as that.  I believe they did it up just right to satisfy all of us that have loved the series from the beginning.  For the ones that already hate the series, why would you change now and like this one?  If you already hated it from the beginning, hey guess what?  You're not going to change your opinion.  However, the effects in this one are truly amazing. That's what's so funny to me when reading reviews of any Twilight movie (or book).  If you already know you've hated the other 4 in the series, what exactly did you expect in the final entry?  If you already think the acting is terrible, what exactly did you think you'd see in Breaking Dawn 2?  Being a true and die hard Twilight Fan from the very beginning, I was so pleased with this movie!  I loved it so much.  I am a 45 year old married woman, and my husband thinks I am CRAZY regarding my love of this series.  I saw it in the theater alone with my big bucket of popcorn and I enjoyed every second, and not ashamed to admit it.  I then watched it on Instant Video the day it came out, too.  That's what we do as Twilight Fans.  We also watch it on the tube every single time it airs.  We love the music, too.  (And oh, by the way, we don't really care about all the haters, either.  Just saying.:)

The ending could not have been more perfectly done.  I am sure Stephenie Meyer was pleased, too.

Love it or hate it, it's been a whirlwind for the actors and they've enjoyed a lot of success with the movies.",1362614400,,1539,4.149152542372882
4999002,5,B006JM1ZTI,"Who hasn't seen Twilight & not liked it?! Well, I purchased this to complete my set! I have seen this movie & it is a lovely ending to a great saga! Any film in this series is amazing! I do tend to always like the 1st film where vampire meets girl, wants to kill her but falls in love with her-it's my fav! But to sum the last 1 up is- Edward(the Vampire) & Bella(the now Vampire) had an immortal child together before Bella was turned-At the babies birth Bella came very close to dying is why Edward had to turn her into a vampire so she would live! Well to sum it all up in a few sentences- Baby is born- growing rapidly, which the Volturi is told is a child turned by being bitten (not Born)! The Volturi forbids this- so they come to take Edward & Bella's family down which with the help of several other vampire friends & werewolfs doesn't succeed! They live happily ""'til the end of time""!  Buy it for a great love story!!",1362614400,,928,4.155555555555556

I have read all 4 books at least twice and the last DVD departed quite a bit from the book where as the others stayed within the story line as best as could be considering all the details.  Was very disappointed and returned movie, did not purchase DVD with Amazon either.  Overall was expecting more details from all the DVD's as was with the ""Pirates of Caribbean"" for instance.

4999038,3,B006JM1ZTI,"Ok I admit that I love the books... I usually don't like books made into movies because they usually throw out all the good stuff that was in the book and you never get to see it on screen.  *Spoiler Alert* That being said this addition to the franchise has only one redeeming quality and it turns out to be a battle scene that never happens in the book.
It was ingenious how they put it in there and got away with it.  It made perfect sense.  The problem is it takes away from the point of the end of the book, Bella finally comes into her own, not just as a human, human loving vampire, or a vampire but just as a woman in love and protecting those she loves.  The movie completely side tracks you (if you've read the books) from the journey that she started.
Admittedly the first movie was a disaster and the characters were developed in ways that went opposite to the character development in the books but the second and third movies seemed to try and make up for it a little bit. Now I'm left with a movie that leaves me with less of an ending and more of a 'hmmm... perhaps a spin-off or sequel?' feeling.  Some may want that but I have seen enough of Bella and Edward for a while thank you.",1362528000,3,1198,4.146551724137931
4999039,4,B006JM1ZTI,"I really enjoyed the Twilight books in spite of myself, so I was curious to see how the movie versions would end.  I have to say that I enjoyed it.  While it didn't follow the book to the letter, I thought it stayed pretty close.  There were a few twists that really had me going for a while, but they did not detract from the overall experience, and in the end they may have even added to it.  My only complaints are a) the makeup, but for me that has been an issue in all but the first movie,and b) some of the additional scenes were very long. These people were described as being incredibly good looking, but their makeup and hair just made them look odd to me.  Almost as if someone tried to make attractive people less so.  Also, the timing seemed off, especially in the embellished areas.  They probably could have shortened them in the interest of adding some of the many parts of the book that didn't make the final cut. All in all though, I think they did a very good job, and was satisfied with it as a closing chapter to the series.",1362528000,,1044,4.21608040201005

Even better than the book (SPOILER: because it was never in the book).  It was the ultimate scene that everyone's been waiting for (aside from the Bella & Edward consummation scenes in Part I).  This is what I wanted to see: vampire vs. vampire. vampire vs. werewolves.  Heads and limbs being ripped off, vampires being burnt.  YEAH!  Very satisfying.",1362528000,,491,4.6395348837209305

Going to watch part 1 and then part 2.  Love that it has the digital and ultra violet too.  Can't wait to watch it. :) The shipping was great as well and came earlier than expected. :),1362528000,,328,3.8507462686567164
4999049,4,B006JM1ZTI,"I watched this series with my daughter.  This last one is just as consistent in quality and entertainment value as the previous releases.  However, I will say I was somewhat disappointed with the cheesy ""fool'd ya"" ending.  Echos of J.R., Bobby, Dallas and dreams, if you're old enough to remember that!  In any case, they've hit their target market and the conclusion to the series was overall satisfying.",1362528000,,406,4.926470588235294

I got so into the movie that I found myself really angry, then the twist happened and felt kind of guilty for feeling the feelings.  If you have liked all the other movies you will love this one as well.  I know a lot of the movie characters are software generated, but to me you shouldn't be able to tell.

4999074,1,B006JM1ZTI,"Twilight part II was a predictable, trite, boring mess, that managed to ruin such universal themes as love, parenthood, growing up, loyalty and a good ole happy ending and turn them into a Kristin Stewart appearance at a celebrity function: awkward, uncomfortable and a smirk/frown that is permanently out of place.

It is the motion picture equivalent of a duck face.

Still it was good to watch the end of a long painfully dull and sophomoric story.

So glad it is over.

I am sure Kristin Stewart can move onto ruining other movies with her wax face such as the rest of Snow White movies.",1362528000,8,591,4.6
4999075,3,B006JM1ZTI,"My girlfriend has every DVD in this collection and I got this for her for Valentines Day. She's watched it twice since it came a few days ago.

The second part of BD IMO was not as interesting as the first simply because the focus was less on the three main characters, Bella, Edward and Jacob and more on the kid and the numerous vampires from around the world who come to the aid of the Cullen family. Still the movie was much better than the book (absolutely horrid) and of course the battle scene is the best part.",1362528000,,518,4.232323232323233
4999076,3,B006JM1ZTI,"The movie was good.

I am unhappy with Amazon and the UltraViolet Digital Copy.  The website only gave a VUDU or ITunes option to stream and I could find no way to get it into my Amazon Video Library.  I am ready to upgrade my Kindle but with this problem I wonder if the IPad would be a better choice, it seams that Apple has a better way of selling videos. Amazon will give you a 30 day rental in your library but once you start you have to finish watching in 24 hours.  You can watch it in your Kindle through the APP for Flixster, if you sync UltraViolet, VUDU and Flixster.  You can also download to your Kindle but it does not show up under your video tab and I am still trying to see how I can remove it from the Kindle when I am finished.  I tried to stream from Flixster in my Kindle but it buffered frequently, a problem I do not have with Amazon streaming.  If Amazon is going to sell for these other streaming services they should link their library with them or go back to providing a way to get the video permanently in your library.",1362528000,,1047,4.102941176470588

It was brilliant, and I really think the cast credits were classy.

The first Twilight was a grea read and a great movie version of that book. The second and third installment is a toss up between  book or movie but the last I will say is definitely the movie being better than the book.

On the technology side of things, be aware that this will not play in HD on every device (not even on a computer).  There are only certain devices that it will stream HD for.  It's a good thing we bought the blu-ray through Amazon.

4999110,2,B006JM1ZTI,"A few years ago I was assigned to review the ""Twilight Saga"" books in anticipation of the release of the first film. Since the one and only true vampire is Bram Stoker's ""Dracula,"" I was under whelmed to say the least. Once I was able to wrap my brain around teenage ""vegetarian"" vampires, and shirtless shapeshifters, I must be honest and admit that I enjoyed the novels. Then came the films...these were a bit more difficult to review - I am not twelve years old - but once I dug deep into my 'inner child,' I saw them for what they were - 'Tween Erotica!' I could get behind neither ""Team Edward,"" nor ""Team Jake."" Perhaps if there was a ""Team George Clooney,"" I would have been hooked! I gave the first four films fairly decent reviews, with the exception of Kristin Stewart - the one note wonder (one look: sullen, one voice: monotone; okay, that's two notes). This brings us to ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2."" I was actually looking forward to the film, the ending of Part I left even me wanting more! I should have subscribed to the saying ""less is more!"" It won the ""Razzie"" award for ""Worst Picture of the Year,"" and Stewart won for ""Worst Actress"" - both well- deserved! In the beginning there was a freaky CGI baby - it was so awful, it made a ""Cabbage Patch Kid"" look adorably real! Fast forward, and a battle is brewing between the ""Volturi"" and the ""Cullens and company"" over the validity of this child NOT being an Immortal (the ultimate vampire crime!). BTW, this, as in all the other ""Twilight"" novels and films, is being perpetrated under the nose of Bella's father, the most clueless cop since ""Inspector Clouseau"" (and not nearly as entertaining)! As for the Cullen's company, these vampires are utterly ridiculous - bad acting, bad accents...just bad. I found myslef laughing out loud, and I'm sure that was NOT what the director intended. All this being said - I could say more, but I don't want to give away any ""spoilers"" - if you have the rest of the ""Twilight"" movies, you have to add the worst film of 2012 to your collection. It closes the series, and the ending montage is beautifully done. It's just a shame that the film doesn't get it right until the closing credits.",1362441600,5,2212,4.5187032418952615

 I read all of the books. I gasped out loud at the huge change from the book's story line toward the end.
It gave me headache, then when they revealed that main characters did not get beheaded, I could rebound from the shock.",1362441600,,267,4.34
4999153,4,B006JM1ZTI,"A satisfying / fitting end to the Twilight Saga which was always ""lower key"" than Harry Potter. Yes, there was ""drama"" but never on the scale of HP. At its root this story was always about an awkward, run-of-the-mill teenager living in the backwoods of ""generally dreary Washington State"" who falls in love with a similarly awkward but nice Vampire and the more jockish but still simple descendant of a shape shifting tribe who doesn't quite understand what she sees in him. This is the final chapter of the story, will the child of Bella (human) and Edward (vampire)'s marriage be accepted?  Nice story and thankfully the 1967 film ""Guess who's Coming to Dinner?"" (touching on the same theme) was probably more dramatic in its time ;-)",1362441600,,736,4.7952755905511815
4999154,1,B006JM1ZTI,"To be clear, I loved this movie when I watched it in the theater. I was excited for it to arrive and watch with my boyfriend, visiting from the the UK and who wanted to see it for the first time. As soon as the movie began, the picture-in-picture feature kicked in, which takes up nearly half the screen, and no matter what he or I did, we could not get it to go away. We tried every setting, turning off the feature, turning it on and off again, skipping ahead... you name it, we tried it. We gave up after about 20 min of messing with it and decided not to watch the movie and will return it. I know of one other person who had the same problem.  Very, very frustrating and has created a hassle.",1362441600,,697,4.050724637681159
4999155,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I read the books, loved them too, but how they put the change with Alice and showing Aro what could happen, that was great.
Loved all the new actors and actresses, hated to see it end.....",1362441600,,188,4.25

4999161,4,B006JM1ZTI,"The movie surpassed my expectations, however; the fight scenes looked like they were borrowed from Breaking Dawn One.  The wolves were not as much portrayed in their human form in this last saga.",1362441600,,195,4.909090909090909
4999162,4,B006JM1ZTI,"A pretty impressive finish to the series.  The extra little surprise at the end was very well done.

4999166,1,B006JM1ZTI,The effects were awesome but that one scene ruined it for me. if they wouldn't have highlighted the wolf dying that much then i would be giving this movie a higher rating. i hate to see animals hurting. movie or not. i will never watch this movie again.,1362441600,3,253,4.291666666666667
4999167,4,B006JM1ZTI,like all of the movies in the saga they are great. my only complaint about this one is how super fake they made baby Renesme look,1362441600,,129,4.0

4999169,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I loved the finale for the Twilight movies. If you are new to the ""Twilight"" life, do not watch this movie before you watch the prevoius movies! You must watch the series in order to fully enjoy the grand finale.",1362441600,,212,4.325
4999170,5,B006JM1ZTI,"This is it! The finale of the Twilight series. If you are a fan this is the best of the entire set of the Twilight saga series. But wait! Even if soft hearted sparkling vampires aren't your thing, you will love this movie. It will make you laugh and have your heart pumping like watching Rocky for the first time. Take adversaries such as Vampires and Werewolves/Shape shifters and force them together to fight a larger adversary and you have an abundance of action a great battle royale at the climax. It will will have you cheering and leave you with a smile on your face.",1362441600,,574,4.4245283018867925

4999172,3,B006JM1ZTI,"Maybe it's because the books are so amazing and detailed, but the movie did not live up to the hype surrounding it. The last chapter of the series when innocent and naive bella turns to the vampire she was meant to be should have shown her more aggressive and blood thirsty dark side which in turn would have taken away from the extremely mushy love saga. Ending this  fantastic story with a little more flare.",1362441600,,410,4.466666666666667

4999177,5,B006JM1ZTI,"As Bella awakens from her subtle transition, she emerges with incredible power and beauty and confidence. The conflict of this chapter evolves around Renesme being a bitten child vs. born half immortal/half human; as historically the former has caused grave consequences and is viewed as the ultimate taboo by the Volturi and vampire culture. Jacob's imprint status brings on the expected reaction from Bella and some rather humorous moments. Once resolved, all the primary characters focus on how to protect Renesme, as Jasper and Alice flee the homestead .... for the protection of the clan. This sets up the conflagration of the final showdown with the Volturi and their followers. As one might expect, the Cullen clan have a host of supporters garnered from extended family and a host of universal tribes. Rather than say more, suffice it to say that the final film in the Twilight series will not disappoint. A fitting climax with incredible CGI. I truly enjoyed it.",1362441600,,971,5.037267080745342

And for suspense, the Voltaire, seemed to reluctantly tuck their tails & headed back across the sea, none to happy, I might add!

It really helps if u have read the Twilight books. While the movie does an amazing job there is so much more detail and explanation in the books, which helps clarify numerous points of confusion. We had to stop the movie to explain a few points to those who didn't read the books",1362441600,,434,4.3580246913580245

Breaking Dawn 2 was a great movie, of course the first movie, plainly entitled ""Twilight"" will always be my favorite.  which I also have bought on my Kindle as well as video.

There are only a couple of parts where they are similar in any way.  I think this is the shortest installment of all and it leaves out alot of important scenes.  From the very beginning where she wakes up to the ending scene they are almost 2 different stories.  This movie is only a little over 1 1/2 hours long and could have easily been over 2 hours if they put alot of important scenes in.  If I paid $1 for this movie, it is $1 too much and since I paid more than that I am very disatisfied.  I don't know why so many Twi-hard fans love this movie, unless they didn't read/like the books.  Granted every movie made is different from the original book there are 2 totally separate stories here and the movie is just really bad.

The movie was available at Wal-Mart for $15.00 before I got it after paying $23.00+. I felt cheated and embarressed for even ordering it early.

4999234,4,B006JM1ZTI,"While not the vampire movie franchise I would prefer, I do like TWILIGHT for what it is. However, Kristen Stewart gets worse in each installment.  She can not act her way out of a paper bag. Her emotions run the gambit from A to A sub 1.  Justin Bieber has more talent...and that is not saying much. This would be much better if Edward and Jacob just did it and created vampire-wolf babies. Stewart is a horror and solely for that reason I have given each installment 4 stars and not 5. It is painful watching her try to act.  And it is not just this franchise, as she is the same in everything she does. I know people will disagree, and if you do, please provide constructive criticism on why you do and not insults. My insult is about Stewart, not about anyone who replies.",1362355200,,775,4.294520547945205
4999235,3,B006JM1ZTI,"I just finished watching the movie.  I watched it twice.  I gave it a good 12 hours between viewings to give me some time to think and reflect.
I can't help but feel ripped off.  It was a very slow film from the time Bella gets to meet her daughter to the end of the movie.  There was hardly any hair raising action until about an  hour 20 into the movie.
When that huge battle happened I felt myself finally immersed into the story and felt the loss of those that lost around them.  The problem is that the whole fighting and on edge, what going to happen? took about 20 minutes if even that of the whole time alloted for the movie.

 Before the final confrontation there was all this meet and greet various with vampires friends.  That left me thinking/questioning, after they've been alive well over 100 years why could they not come up with more then 18 friends to fight for them.  That really seemed silly and just not logical. I would hope if you've been alive for longer then 100 years and have a family of Vamps that are over 100 years that as a family they would have at least 100 or so friends and extended family that would fight for them.

 Then her reaction how Jacob imprinted with her daughter.. She already knew the deal with how imprinting works.  For her to suddenly be violent with Jacob to the point of hurting him  was just plan fraudulent. At first I thought maybe I had forgotten the last movie and their push to make it clear what imprinting was, also checking back with the actual books too didn't fill in the part of why she was so upset.  The only thing I really thought about was maybe she was jealous he didn't love her like he did before.  Again though none of that was clear.  Just the fact she was upset he imprinted on her daughter.  It was just another notch in the stick of things that didn't make any sense.

There was a lot and I mean a lot of filler of scenic pictures,  from mountain tops to various parts of the world. They could have used more of that time to show more of the relationship with her father after her change.

The ending was so drawn out.  Not fun at all really or even really romantic.  It did not pull me in like I wanted to be pulled in.

I read the series and have watched all the movies.  This was by far the worst of all the genre.
I can say it did feel like the story line was finally drawn to a close.  It did leave it open to see what happens to Jacob and Renesmee in the future.  A story could come from that for sure.

Just very disappointing.",1362355200,,2510,4.172916666666667

Over the series, there's in-depth development of all the major characters, the Cullen family and the Quileute tribe, as well as their respective histories.  In this last film of the saga, there's plenty of action, intrigue, and a new level of love betwen Bella & Edward.

4999251,3,B006JM1ZTI,"Pros

Loved the end credits with the book pages/introducing the major cast credits from all the 4 movies. Very touching and a tribute to the books. And pertinent in that this was a series of movie adaptations that, due to fan pressure, really had to stick to the books. In fact the five minutes of the end/credits sung to ""thousand days"" was perfect and almost worth watching the whole movie for.

Love the battle scene, a great twist improvement.  I found it quite shocking.

Love the CGI wolves.

The cinematography of the NW scenery was beautifully done.  Titles and credits were great.

Billy Burke great as always. He did a fantastic job through the series as Bella's dad.

Sets, interiors of the Carlisle mansion looked great.  Just what intellectual, artsy vampires would collect around them.

Cons

The sappy dialogue at the beginning (first twenty minutes) was almost too much to bear. Sorry.

Bella's ""sheild"" was poorly displayed in the end scene. Very hard to tell that it was there or working, or what her motivations were - for example as she pulled it back from Edward, etc. Unless you understood what she was doing based on the book, but the movie should be able to explain this, since it was a key plot point.

The battle scene -- good grief, the writer should have had them go into that scenario with some battle tactics planned. Given Bella was the sheild and also the newborn and thus the strongest, why wasn't she doing either effectively?  Why didn't they plan to take out Jane and her brother first, and then Aro.  Why wasn't Bella shielding and going after Jane?  And why would Jane run from Alice?  Jane could immobilize her, and the wolf that got Jane as well.  The whole battle scene looked like it was written by someone who had no idea of strategy. Jasper and Carlisle would have been better prepared in case it came to that. And as the strongest, Bella should have put in a better show.

I didn't hate the CGI baby as much as some, but I didn't like it.

soundtrack was really bad. No new catchy songs. No new love songs. In general these are not great soundtracks, and the first movie, I think was the best. Also, I miss the old days of film, when each major character in a movie had a ""theme"", a few bars of which played briefly when they appeared (at times). Seems to me this series cried out for a theme for Edward, Carlisle and Esme, etc.

The makeup on the Carlisle family vampires has been so bad since the first movie. They are supposed to look attractive. Most of them just look really bad and all the extra budget has not improved this - the shoestring budget first movie got it done better. Here Carlisle's white face looked bloated, Esme's hair was MUCH more attractive when it was caramelas the books specify, not dark as in the last few films.  Emmet too looked odd. Jasper was okay, but Rose definitely did not look spectacular as her book character specified.

Since Bella had so little trouble controlling herself around JAcob and Ness, all the worry over her meeting Charlie seemed unreal.

Also, Bella didn't really look that different to me, as a vampire as she did during her wedding, when she was made up, etc. So Charlie's ""you're my daughter and not my daughter"" didn't fly.

It would have been nice, given this was the last movie, to have some more defined ending for the relationship between Cullens and the wolfpacks.  A sort of wrap up.  They just wandered off.

Dings at the book, that it is not fair to ding the movie for, since it has to be faithful, but still.

Why is Carlisle the only one that seems to do something productive with his days?

Bella is still a very unlikable character. The only nice thing she really does in the whole series is to move to Forks to benefit her mother. And take over the cooking/housekeeping for Charlie. In the beginning of the first book, I liked her for that. But the rest of the series, she  too often has seemed a whining, complaining, ungrateful brat, and a user of too many people (Jacob particularly comes to mind).

I don't really understand the whole vampire attraction thing.  Even sparkly vegetarian ones. And Bella's constant worry that she'll be a day older than Edward seems really shallow.

But kudoes to Meyer for tapping into a teen theme, and making a success of it.",1362355200,,4281,4.545691906005222

4999259,5,B006JM1ZTI,"The final installment was well worth the wait.

4999262,3,B006JM1ZTI,The CGI was annoying they couldn't use  a real baby? Acting wasn't that good either. I remember liking the other films.,1362355200,,119,4.666666666666667

4999265,2,B006JM1ZTI,"Was cheesy. They didn't have to split in two parts. Acting was an over kill. The scenery was very nice. Vampires with special powers! Ok.
Wish the Avengers showed up in the movie then it might have been better.
No directing at all.",1362355200,,231,4.395348837209302

4999267,3,B006JM1ZTI,"I'm surely not the target audience for the Twilight series, being a guy, not reading any of the books, and being over 16 years old.  However, I have enjoyed the series -- if ""enjoyed"" is the correct word, more like ""been amused"" would be the correct phrase -- and I have seen everyone of these films.  But this one to me is surely the worst of them all.

This thing is really a PC mess, what with the Amazonian vampires, the Romanian vampires (or were they Russian, what with the ""I vill this"" and ""I vill that"") and the themes about not discriminating when others are different.  This theme is pounded into the viewer like a stake through the heart with such force that it's difficult to actually enjoy the film, and that would be the point of any ""Twilight"" movie, now wouldn't it?  Because surely, you're not going to learn much by watching any of them.

Supposedly, KStew has promised her love to RPat (ha!  Sorry 'bout the nicknames but I just couldn't help myself from poking a little fun) for 1000 years, or maybe at least until one of them makes a sequel to another film that caused issues in the past.  Personally, I don't understand the millennium thing; aren't vampires supposed to live forever?  Or until at least their heads get ripped off?  Oh, well.  I didn't even love this film after the first five minutes.  I groaned, laughed a bit, and then endured this bloody mess.",1362355200,,1386,4.5
4999268,4,B006JM1ZTI,"I'm not going to lie i'm not a big twilight fan my husband is so when he got the movie i expected it to be as good as the first part but the animated baby face killed it for me her face as a child even look worse, but i still watched. i'm not going to be a spoiler but the amazon girls were amazing loved them! the end was quite interesting :) enjoy it it's the end",1362355200,,365,3.6923076923076925

4999270,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I love this movie. I would recommend this to anyone I have the whole collection series now. This is it! I must admit that the last movie was the best Twilight and finally made me a fan. Well, this final movie is all about Bella the new vampire and the baby! Bella is so pretty.! I didn't think she could get any better than in her last movie, but she did it. Well, at least we can say that she has perfected her character, whether it's acting or not I'll leave it up to you. So, now she's a vamp running through the woods, feeding on animal blood and saving the occasional helpless animal to keep our affection. Oh, if only life could continue to be so blissful. Alas, it's not to be. The Volturi get pissed off in this movie when they find out that Bella and Edward have a child, which can only be achieved with miraculous precision and vampire family planning. I had a blast and I'm sure you will too. They spared no expense and this one turned out to be pure entertainment.",1362355200,,976,4.224598930481283
4999271,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I have read all of the books, so I was anticipating this last installment.  It really needed to be longer to encompass all of the nuances of the characters and plot.  The ending almost had me furious as it diverged from the book's story line, but it redeemed itself before conclusion.  I hope Stephanie decides to write more about these characters.  I will miss them.",1362355200,,367,4.6
4999272,2,B006JM1ZTI,"I have always thought the Twilight movies were good as long as you had read the books because there is simply too much content and backstory to fit into any individual film. I see the movies as a way to bring the books to life and if you've read the books your brain can automatically fill in content where needed as you watch. That didn't really work in Breaking Dawn 2. I thought this film was choppy, no scene every felt complete. Also, the emotional connection from the characters was lacking in this film. Kristen Stewart has taken a lot of bashing but I thought she looked stunning and did a good job with the material she was given. Pattinson did an okay job as Edward but I didn't think he looked as good...odd. Lautner was solid as Jacob.

I hated the ending! SPOILER - I loved the way the book ended and the way Bella came into her own power but that was minimized in the film. Like many other people, I fell in love with the characters in the book and I did not want to see them killed so the battle scene wasn't something I enjoyed. It also didn't feel as though it really fit with the plot...it was more like something the studio and Director put in because they wanted a big budget battle scene. The ending was too short...as the last film we needed more of a good-bye to the characters. All in all, I think it was a disappointing effort by a director with the wrong vision.",1362355200,,1388,4.277566539923955

4999275,5,B006JM1ZTI,"If, like me, the ending of part 1 left you screaming at the movie screen, then this is the part 2 that you could only hope for. And the scene where the Volturi arrive was probably one of my favorites in the entire series. I would recommend this to anyone out there who is a twi-hard fan and wants to see it at its best.",1362355200,,319,3.923076923076923

4999277,4,B006JM1ZTI,This was by far the best Twilight movie next to Eclipse. The fight scene at the end was the highlight of the movie in my opinion. I would watch again.,1362355200,,150,4.033333333333333

4999280,4,B006JM1ZTI,"Warning, some spoilers may follow:

This is probably the best of the Twilight movies.  While it lacks some of the humor of the previous films, the story is great and it doesn't have the lulls of the previous movies.

The only annoying thing I found in the movie was the CGI baby (Renesmee).  Why they felt it necessary to use CGI for an infant is beyond me.  I get the child was growing quickly, but really?  I couldn't get past it and it ruined the scenes she was in for me.

Otherwise it was a great sendoff to the series.  The effects otherwise were great, the ending was a bit of a cop out, but overall I'd highly recommend it.",1362355200,,631,4.2

As much as the first ""Twilight"" film strayed and improvised off of the book it was based on, Meyer's final film in what's turned out to be a lucrative dream followed VERY well, with one minor sidetrack the viewer will definitely by degrees love and/or hate.  It's also nice to see the most character-laden of the stories fleshed out with new people.

Assuming you're a fan of the series, of the BOOK series that is, buy this and ""Breaking Dawn 1"", watch 'em back to back.  You'll have a good night.",1362355200,,622,4.3826086956521735

I really did enjoy the movie and loved the ending and that is all I will say without spoiling it. The only down side is that it seemed as if we were going through the movie really fast. Bella wakes up. She's hunting. She meets Jakes. The baby. Her dad.....Etc. It was like Bam. Bam. Cut n dry.

The only reason I will take off 1 star (and I should take off one more,) was the ridiculous and distracting CGI face they gave Renesmee while she was an infant and young girl.  It was really weird, creepy and made us laugh the entire time the baby/child was on screen.  Really?  That was the best they could do?

I can't put my finger on why the books didn't feel cheesy to me but the movie/movies did.  I think the other movies did a better job depicting the book than this movie.

I guess I should have known this movie would NOT live up to those reviews.  This is most likely because I am not a twleve year old girl, who enjoys watching douchey vampires in love.  For starters, the opening credits were ridiculous.  Obviously the producer/director was going for a very unique style of crap.  This was further underlined by the following scenes (for the entirety of the rest of the movie.)  This is unfortunate due to the fact that the books were not bad at all if a little anti-climactic.  I understand the, SPOILER ALERT (you're welcome), reason they decided to show the battle at the end (even though it never happened.)  Just when I thought, ""okay, they changed some stuff around in the movie to make at least the last 15 minutes semi-watchable,"" I got a nice wake-up call that the last 20 minutes of my life (not to mention the all-encompassing 1hr 56min total I spent watching this garbage) were completely wasted on something that had no bearing to the completion of the movie at all.  And, when you think, ""it's finally over,"" you get to spend another 10 mins watching Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart continue to look adoringly into each other's eyes (which they've done for the entire ""saga"") while practically dry-humping.

I'm not going to say this is some cinematic masterpiece, but I think it satisfies those who wanted to see Breaking Dawn come to life on the big screen.  *Spoiler Alert*  I love how they fit a good battle in the movie without messing up the story the way it is read.

4999376,2,B006JM1ZTI,"The book from which this movie was taken was wonderfully complex.  Unfortunately, that complexity simply didn't translate to the screen in this final installment of the saga.  I realize that they had to keep it short - but ENORMOUS amounts of detail that made the book what it is were left out (far moreso than Breaking Dawn Part 1 - the movie version of the first portion of the book).

If you've already read the book (and most have at this point), don't expect the exotic natures of the ""foreign"" friends of the family to be explored in any more than a passing way - and that's a major flaw in this movie, in my opinion; even Bella's new-found powers, and the unique abilities of Renesme (surely two central figures) are given little more than a mention.

I realize that the target audience of ""tweens has a comparatively short attention span, but an extra half-hour of detail would have made this a MUCH better movie.  Please tell me there's a (good!) director's cut out there somewhere????

Some changes to gather the Hollywood masses were anticipated, but these were too many to count. Throughout the entire movie, clever and interesting points in the plot were changed or warped as to be very rushed, if not entirely meaningless. Actions that should not have been credited to certain characters were without reason. Character development was practically non-existent, which is a huge shame because in the text Meyer introduces about a dozen new characters and brings life to at least half of them. Some of the new characters we so over-looked that they might well as have been written out entirely for the pathetic treatment they were given in the movie. Though I was annoyed throughout the movie, the last 10 minutes are the worst and most offensive. Then in the final 2 minutes, they added back shades of  Meyer's original ending which were then meaningless given what had transpired in the previous 8 minutes and just insulting. Had I seen this in theaters, I would have walked out of the theater. Now I'm tempted to delete the movie from my collection. If you didn't read the book of have a really poor memory, you might enjoy this movie for the last few scenes but given the poor character development and rushed story line, I doubt it.",1362182400,8,1346,4.703389830508475

I don't want to give anything away, so I'll leave it at that.  I recommend this to any Twilight fan.  You won't be disappointed!  Awesome!!!

And, I couldn't disagree more with the reviewer who said to stay away from this movie if you like the books.  I love the books, but I also love the movies.

4999402,1,B006JM1ZTI,"It's over. It's finally over. After five movies of stone-faced melodramatic drivel, the ""Twilight"" movie series is finally over... until Stephenie Meyer churns out a few more books.

But until that happens, ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2"" marks the end of this irritatingly omnipresent series about sparkly vampires. Bill Condon is doing what he can with what he has, but even a brilliantly violent climactic battle can't cover up the fact that this entire movie is like a faked orgasm -- a lot of buildup with a awkward, empty denouement.

Having been made a vampire, Bella (Kristen Stewart) wakes up and is instantly perfect -- perfect super-strength, perfect superpowers, perfect skin, perfect hair, a perfect vampire pseudo-family with a perfect (creepy) CGI baby. There's only one non-perfect thing: Jacob (Taylor Lautner) has imprinted on baby Renesmee, meaning that they are soulmates. How wonderfully pedophilic.

But don't worry. Bella gets over it, and retires to a perfect luxury cottage in the perfect woods to have perfect sex with Edward (Robert Pattinson), complete with perfect sparkly orgasms. I wish I were kidding. Sparkly orgasms!

But then another vampire spots Renesmee, and reports to the Volturi that the Cullens have made an ""immortal child,"" which is forbidden. So the Cullen clan does the only logical thing: it starts calling in random vampire buddies to come hang out at their house, so they can fight if and when the Volturi attack. If this sounds exciting, I can assure you that it's not.

You would think the build-up to a battle between two vampire gangs would be pretty awesome. Sadly, it's not -- most of the movie consists of people standing around talking, while reminding us that the Volturi (who are basically how Stephenie Meyer sees Catholics) are cartoonishly evil and just want a reason to wipe out the vampire Mormons.

But the slow build-up is tedious rather than intense -- most of the plot is just about random vampires hanging out at the Cullens' mansion, and showing off their OMG-SO-KEWL powers. The dialogue is clunky (""If we live through this, I'll follow you anywhere, woman"") and the dramatic/romantic moments are delivered with such clunky awkwardness that it's impossible to take them seriously.

And I feel bad for Bill Condon, who tries to wedge action and excitement wherever he can. He's trying so, so hard. In fact, he deviates sharply from Meyer's sludgy book near the end, and for a brief few minutes, we are treated to a gloriously violent, acrobatic battle scene -- major characters are brutally killed, chasms open in the earth's crust, and heads are torn off at random. It's absolutely brilliant...

... until we find out that it was all a psychic vision. Yeah. The big exciting climax? It never happened. Everybody just wanders off home and nothing is ultimately resolved.

In fact, the climax is so unsatisfying that two minor characters actually start yelling about how stupid it is. Instead of an epic battle, we get a final massive dose of diabetes-inducing treacle, which just shows us why the ""Twilight"" series is not, and never has been, a ""saga.""

As usual, the acting ranges from bored (Pattinson) to wooden (Lautner). Kristen Stewart is the worst one here, because after four movies of mumbling and biting her lip... she's finally trying to ACT. The scene where Bella yells, ""You nicknamed my daughter after the Loch Ness Monster?!"" is absolute comedy gold, and I couldn't help but wonder if Pattinson's chuckling in the background was just because of how BAD she was.

The worst part is that most of the new vampires are actually potentially interesting characters, and are played by some decent actors. Don't expect much backstory, though. You'll be disappointed.

""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2"" is build up as an epic clash to finish off the series... but instead you get a massive puff of stale-smelling air. Bill Condon tries, but this is only worthy of a Rifftrax viewing.",1361750400,15,3977,4.981900452488688

4999410,5,B006JM1ZTI,Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 2 is the best one in the entire series. The fight scene is fantastic and is unlike any other fight scene. There is some dead time leading up to the scene but the special affects used are unimaginable. All the vampires come together to save Bella and Edwards daughter. She is believed to be a danger to the vampires which causes the leaders to become suspicious of her. Part 2 does not focus on the love story as much as the other series did. I enjoyed part 2 most of all because of the nonstop action and the uniting of vampires never shown previously. Great family entertaining!,1361577600,4,607,4.4774774774774775

Much of what is explained in the book is filmed as Bella ""thinking,"" but still left unexplained.

There were probably 5 of these confusing, emotionless scenes within the first 30 minutes. The concept of imprinting was sort of touched on, but left unclear, and Jacob's sudden interest in the baby seems almost creepy.

I was worried that they wouldn't becuz of the very intimate scenes of Bella and Edward and the gory birth scene of Renesmee and Bella.

I must admit I didn't care for the other books or movies, just Breaking Dawn. I think they did an excellent job in Breaking Dawn part 2, and part 1 was really romantic.

This last part marks the end of this entire ""Twilight"" movie series ... finally! Bella is now able to open her mouth more often than usual and is able to string more sentences together with each scene. She's not a mute after all! I'm somewhat relieved! She looks better too, fresher face, creamy smooth make-up, excellent foundation. How about an Oscar award for her? Does anyone recall her sweating after all that running around?

The computer graphics have improved a bit, a little more realistic this time round. I wish they've better software for those wolves, instead of just pasting them over a faulty green screen.

I won't be collecting this DVD. My curiosity with this movie series has ended.

4999457,3,B006JM1ZTI,"In 2007, Chuck had started and ended in 2012 with the core of that story being about love and family. Breaking dawn part 2, in its final 2 hours, tries to replicate the same core that it fails and sends it to hilarity.

Like the first 4 movies, BD part 2 is another cinematic pinata that gets whacked in every direction it gets hit. In traditional words, part 2 picks up where part 1 left off. Bella finally gets what she wanted. ""I was born to be a vampire."" Jacob seems to come to terms with Bella's ""transformation."" The story picks up when an elite group of vamps from Italy, headed by Aro(played by the ever awesome Michael Sheen) gets word that Edward and Bella's half-human/half-vampire child is born. Threatened, the volturri, as they're called, assemble to Forks to possibly launch a battle over the little girls future. There are few things to credit in the twilight finale: 1 would be the battle sequence that occurs towards the end of the flick, and the other would be Michael Sheen, who proves that it is fun to be a psychotic bad guy. The issues with this movie are still the same with the other movies leading up to this. Hilariously bad dialogue still exists, and the characters still fail to give us any reason to care about them

Even though the series is out the door, and Stephanie Meyer is still making off this, with Stephanie's new adaptation The Host materializing in theaters at the end of next month, I guess 1 would have to wonder if that one's gonna have any brains to impress us. I'm sure Meyer's fans are gonna be pleased like they were with this movie. Just saying.",1360108800,2,1596,4.481099656357388

I'm just saying (no offense) that if you aren't a twi-hard then something is definately wrong with you. Even though Stephenie Meyer is the author AND producer, you're not actually giving her the credit, you're giving the love to the actors who are like basically working for Stephenie. And Breaking Dawn Part 2 is like the best movie I have ever seen (next to the other 4 movies). And of course, the fight seen put me in hysterics. I would recomend you to at least take the time to watch it a few times. I have wached all 5 movies more than 20 times each, and enjoyed every single one of them. And please, I'm just saying, stop complaining about Kristen's preformance because she is doing a great job with her acting skills. Sometimes I kind of wish I could play Zafrina or Senna. Their powers look cool. And then sometimes I wish I could play Renesmee, Mackenzie Foy is really lucky. All I have to say, is: THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN PART 2 IS TOTALLY COOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It's so noteworthy that one of the screen shots that Amazon shows in the product description she has that very look on her face.

I'll admit I'm not a huge fan of the series in general, but my wife truly loved the books and even she finds it hard to deal with Bela and her unbelievably stiff one-look acting all the time, and when I watched the movies I found it absolutely jarring to the point of barely being able to focus on what was going on.

If you like the books, then odds are you're going to want to watch these movies regardless, and I can totally understand that, but it doesn't change the fact that they have some pretty major issues.",1359676800,22,821,4.34640522875817

4999470,3,B006JM1ZTI,"This is the grand finale of the very successful ""Twilight"" saga, and the most entertaining entry as some say. But be patient with the film's ruefully uneven first half, where we meet the new Bella Swan, fully transformed, capable of running and jumping like a Marvel Comics character. Effects are pretty cheesy at times, and Bella develops her prowess as a vampire too quickly, but at least she is not dull some campy moments during her ""training"" as a vampire.

Still, not many things happen to advance the story. Characters are often standing and delivering lines to each other. Jacob is taking off his shirt again (done with some self-awareness) and you know that's a staple of the series. Please wait for a Volturi leader Aro, played by scenery-chewing Michael Sheen, shows up with an evil smile on his face.

Now that Edward and Bella are married and their baby Renesmee is born, what we want to know is, ""Who survives?"" ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2"" answers the question in a surprisingly violent way. The over-the-top combat sequence includes decapitations, though they are done in a not-so-graphic fashion that is made intentionally to look cartoonish.

Probably this is the least romantic ""Twilight"" installment, and the final chapter attempts to satisfy both those who want to see blood spilled, and those who don't. I find it pretty entertaining though avid fans of the series might feel otherwise.",1359417600,3,1423,4.945606694560669

4999482,4,B006JM1ZTI,"We may be edging near the saturation point of vampire-related entertainment, however, as brooding, Washington-state-based, vampire/werewolf romance films go, Breaking Dawn: Part 2 easily ranks in the top five.  Twi-Hards have been waiting over four years to finally see how the cinematic adaptation of the Stephenie Meyer series of books will end.  All things considered, the end result is actually rather exciting.

Breaking Dawn: Part 1 left us staring into the (red) eyes of Bella post-pregnancy and post-transformation.  Part 2 begins at this same moment as Bella adapts to her new vampiric life-style and her new role as mother to the half-human, half-vampire child, Renesmee.  Now if you haven't managed to suspend your disbelief at this point, leave the theater; I'm sure Lincoln is playing right next door.  Regardless, as Renesmee rapidly grows, the Cullen clan finds themselves in new territory, raising a natural newborn.  Furthermore, word spreads to the Volturi that such a unique child exists and that it might be immortal, and therefore, illegal.  This looming inevitability of a final showdown between the Cullens and Volturi drives the plot unlike any of this film's predecessors, and as climaxes go, this one is by far the best.

In spite of this, there is certainly no shortage of excessive melodrama or corny moments of tepid dialogue.  While Stewart and Pattinson have reached an iconic status as leads Bella and Edward, they continue to fail to deliver powerful performances in these roles.  Throughout the series, both leads seem too comfortable resting on the idea that these characters do nothing but whisper, stare, and have sex.  If you buy Kristin Stewart as a caring mother in this film, I have the actual bowie knife that killed Dracula to sell you.  Taylor Lautner holds his own as Jacob, who's scene with Bella's father Charlie Swan (Billy Burke) steals the movie.  Nonetheless, no one goes to see this series of films to be wowed by the range of its actors.  In fact, this film introduces so many characters that none of them have much time to shine (sparkly or otherwise).  What these characters do bring is a host of new X-Men-style super powers, which are enjoyable elements to the film.  Thus, the film delivers in other ways.  Its pacing is strong as it does not dwell on any one moment in its journey to the final showdown.  Additionally, its action is crisp and deliberate; there is very little to distract from the story's momentum.  The cast does their job, but these successes are the result of writers Melissa Rosenberg and Stephenie Meyer along with director, Bill Condon.

The vampire craze that started all of this may be starting to show some signs of declining slightly, yet this is a fairly strong send-off to an epically successful series of adolescent-aimed pop culture.  It is clearly the best of the series, which adds a significance to all five of the films.  The closing credits illustrate this as they celebrate the entire cast of the films together.  Pop culture vampires may be in their eclipse rather than beginning their new moon, but Twilight certainly lived to see the break of dawn.  B

4999483,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I adored ""Breaking Dawn: Part 2."" I thought it was the perfect ending to the Twilight Saga. They even throw in a heart stopping twist that will throw even those who have read the book. But, I really do wish Stefanie Meyer would think hard about doing ""Midnight Sun"" because I would love to see Jacob and Renesmee's story told. Some people say they're disappointed or dislike Twilight completely, but I have loved every part of the entire saga. I own and have read all the books over and over again :) I think they are wonderful. I honestly think it's time for people realize and accept that movies made from books are never going to be 100% the same. There is always going to be more detail in the book because it can't all fit into the movie. They even broke up ""Breaking Dawn"" and things were still left out. I don't think that makes any of the movies bad because of that. As I said, I enjoy both the movies and the books. I've heard the same crap about the ""Harry Potter"" Series. And the same thing applies. There's simply too much detail in the books for it all to make it into the movies. But again, I enjoy both. Anyway, this will be another one of my favorite movie collections. It's very bittersweet. I'm happy to see onscreen Bella and Edward get their forever, but at the same time, I'm sad that the Saga is over. Definitely go for this movie, even if you didn't get to see it in the theater.

Compared to other actresses from her generation like Jennifer Lawrence or Ellen Paige, Kirsten Stewart  sucks as an actress. But she didn't really have to act, being a vampire is right up her alley: cold, frigid amd void of emotion. Thats all her personality seems to entail anyway. The cheesy one-liners like ""you named my daughter after the Loch Ness monster"" didn't make me laugh either. Movie had too many unnecessary characters that served no true purpose! The best acting came from the Amazon chicks that never spoke. Why do so many people like the Twilight series, they're not original, not exciting, and just an all out waste of time.",1358467200,14,812,4.71830985915493

This one has the best action moments despite the unexpected plot twist, the best pacing that it doesn't waste too much staying at place for a long period unlike the last picture that was slow even its nearly two hours, the humor is more funny than ever, at least Kristen Stewart as Bella Cullen gets something to do more this time around now that's she is in full vampire mode that she has powers, the postcard ending before the closing credits with the whole entire cast from all five films thanking the fans despite how much people like or dislike them. I have seen this one five times actually three times buying a ticket each week and the two times theater hoping, the first time seeing it which me and my best friend went to see it which then we sneaked into Rise of the Guardians, the next week, we bought another ticket, then we theater sneaked into the film immediately that showing ended which I fell somehow, asleep, then the next week, we bought one last ticket and we were the only two people in the theater and I fell asleep then we sneaked into the next showing which even I'm a guy that can withstand 4 other screenings with my friend who is a woman. But, if guys are reading this, you all would say if you can withstand Twilight, wooooooooooow, you've risked seeing it five times or the haters, you would say, the poor woman tortured the poor guy by seeing it five times but, it was nothing like that at all, so suck it up and I'm just a fellow moviegoer and just having fun with my friend that just thinks this whole series could have been worst but happy and sad at the same time that this movie series is over until the reboot which it had only had some material cut out of the film not going to be on the DVD or blu-ray special features that was in the book and or created for the film which many fans know that they were filmed that was deleted.

4999489,2,B006JM1ZTI,"So the wife finally dragged me to the final Twilight movie.  The series has had its ups and downs, but the final installment encapsulates the roller-coaster in and of itself.

Breaking Dawn I left off with Bella (Kristen Stewart) ultimately choosing necrophilia over bestiality, knowing she couldn't get pregnant.  Uh, about that, Maury Povich is on line one for you.  So she went through a skeletal phase where the baby, unfortunately, didn't kill off Bella's character.  But it was close enough that Edward (Robert Pattinson) had to turn her into a sparkly vampire.

The positives of this film are minimal.  It slightly extends the love saga between Bella and Edward, producing a child with her own story (put the pen down, Stephanie Meyer) while bringing a finalization to their tale.  Vampire folklore continues to get trampled, but within the framework of Twilight it stays consistent.  There's even a small development of how/when/why the werewolves begin to turn as a result of vampire presence which I thought was an interesting take.  Pattinson turns in a decent performance, but Ashley Greene continues to simultaneously be the most attractive and best actor in the entire series.  Last but not least, the climax had a very interesting twist that no doubt has M. Night Shyamalan slamming his head into a brick wall for not thinking of it first.  Oh, and no baseball scenes.  But that's about it.

The negatives are too numerous to mention, but to start...

The special effects in this film were really hokey.  In previous films the vampires abilities were realized with subtle, powerful grace, and the wolves posed menacing figures with strength and honor.  This time, however, it's a bunch of blur motions to show how fast the vampires run.  Add that to a poorly done baby (Renesmee) that looked more robot than vampire, and it became distracting.  Making it worse was the disconnect between events and dialogue.  At one point Bella is walking and talking normally with everyone else, but before meeting her father she has to be given a lesson on how to act human, as if she wasn't controlling her physical movements perfectly fine mere moments earlier.

The script is straight up braindead.  It's very clear little thought was put into any of this, and it's not even remotely hidden.  Character is a vampire, ""Wow, you're cold.""  Character is strong, ""Wow, you're strong.""

The other actors in the film are fairly bad.  Jacob (Taylor Lautner) fulfilled his contractual obligation to take off his shirt at least once, and that's about all he did.  Stewart is so bad she looks constipated in at least 50% of the movie.  She literally has no clue how to emote.  And if you haven't already seen/heard the ridiculously bad laugh from Michael Sheen (as Aro of the Volturi), then do yourself a favor and look it up on youtube.

Unfortunately for the great twist at the end, there is a twist near the beginning (for those who haven't read the books), that got creepy immediately.  Without a full blown explanation, Jacob has ""imprinted"" on Renesmee, an infant.  And that's the explanation for why he was attracted to Bella all this time.  Yes, that means he was attracted to an egg inside her body.  Well, good thing they cleared up the whole nepiophilia issue.

Overall, it's a fittingly bland end to a bland series that entranced teenage girls worldwide into concentrating on a poorly wrought love story while ignoring the fact that immortal vampires would rather spend time going to High School for eons than using their time productively to do something like cure cancer.",1358467200,12,3579,4.8887043189368775

other clans that played a major role in the book.  They waited too long and showed too many reruns of the first
4 movies on TV, as to build up the climax....they forgot to tell the actors to keep there pants on and zippers fastened

That and, as far as I could tell, all of the most memorable scenes from the book were presented wonderfully. Bella's transformation to a vampire - and her first hunt with Edward - are beautiful and eerie. The different vampires who come to support the Cullen family were so cool! But I'll shut up about that and let you enjoy everything yourself! (I have to add that the actors were all at the top of their game!). But now for the warning. `Breaking Dawn Part 2' is much more violent than the other `Twilight' movies. There are a few disturbing scenes (one as a flashback) and then there is the battle at the end. Had I not been warned, I would have been horrified. BIG SPOILER: there is a battle between the Volturi and the Cullen allies. Many of the main characters are brutally killed, people (good and bad) have their heads ripped off and the heads are shown close-up. But, this turns out to only be a vision of the future which Alice shows Aro, and so the movie ends the same way the book does. It's a pretty amazing battle scene. But as the Twilight movies have been very mild thus far, the violence was rather startling. In conclusion, a great movie, with excitement, romance, horrible deaths (most of which aren't real) and great vampires from around the globe. What are you waiting for?",1356480000,8,1576,4.494773519163763

4999507,5,B006JM1ZTI,"The fifth and final movie in this series was absolutely amazing! Even as a fan who read the books, I got caught up in the twist that Director Bill Condon placed in the movie! It is a beautiful story about the love of family and friends, and it has it's heart-wrenching moments that help make it an Epic 5-star movie. WARNING: Not for young children. There is a very mild sex scene (not really anything terrible) and a scene near the end of the movie might terrify little ones a bit too much.",1355702400,16,491,4.290322580645161
4999508,1,B006JM1ZTI,"It's hard to defend a movie that keeps insisting on having such insipid dialogues (""We're the same temperature now"", ""I Didn't Think You'd be so... you""). I want to defend it because there's a cheesy part of me who is attracted to the world that Stephenie Meyer has created. A world that is mostly aimed at the hearts of the young.

But it's time for this series to come to an end. Cause it's becoming harder and harder to see the qualities in it. Movie wise, the special effects aren't the best, the acting level is debatable and the intelligence of the dialogues and intentions is more than ever reaching the level of a Michael Bay production.  For the first time I felt the financial greed behind the reality of this two-part story.  ""Breaking Dawn"", the novel, was a bit unnecessary, I thought. To my great surprise, ""Breaking Dawn Part One"", the movie, was very entertaining. But ""Breaking Dawn Part Two"" is the proof that the fourth novel didn't possess enough ""juice"" to break it in two movies.

When Anne Rice finished ""Queen Of The Damned"", the third and final novel of the legendary trilogy of her vampire chronicles, she surprised us with a fourth novel (""The Tale Of The Body Thief"") which didn't necessarily continued the story but rather brought it to new and interesting levels of depths. But this fourth Twilight story is nothing close to bringing these vampires love stories to new and profound levels. It's simply stretching a trilogy that didn't need an epilogue cut in two films. The two main ideas of ""Breaking Dawn"" (the transformation of Bella and the birth of Renesmee and its effect on Jacob and the Volturi) could've been easily incorporated in ""Eclipse"", at the end, in a kind of epilogue that didn't show too much but let us wanting more, which is the way all good stories should end.  That's what ""Breaking Dawn"" is: an overlong, unnecessary epilogue.

It's not that ""Breaking Dawn Part 2"" is dull or completely uninteresting. It has its moment and there are scenes that hit home. The end is truly fun and the homage to the books (the flipping of the pages at the end) is touching. I even had regrets that they didn't spend enough time with Charlie and Bella's mother, especially showing us their reaction to what has happened in their daughter's life. But ultimately, that wasn't what ""Twilight"" was all about. What it was about was settled and delt with in the third movie (""Eclipse""). What this fourth novel (and two more movies) has brought is the acknowledgment that Stephenie Meyer's world, contrary to the universe of Anne Rice, for example, has its limits. I was never tired during the screening of ""Breaking Dawn Part 2"". Simply, I was finding the whole thing empty, like we were squeezing all the juice out of the story. And that there was not one single adventure left to tell in this world.",1355184000,20,2831,4.686116700201207
4999509,5,B006JM1ZTI,"This movie ends the Twilight saga in a very action-filled way! After reading all the books and seeing all the movies in this Stephenie Meyer's series, I have to say this movie was very impressive and has an interesting twist towards the later part of the movie that is not in the book.

I like the characters, and this movie has the most action of the whole series. As you know if you've seen Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 1 movie, which was a set-up for this movie and the confrontation with the Volturi clan, Bella turns into a vampire and finally becomes an animated and fully-developed character who really enjoys her new life and role as a mother!

This is a great movie, the characters are great and the action is unbelievable, and the wolves are even more cuddly! A must-see for a Twilight fan!",1355184000,,799,4.503448275862069

4999511,3,B006JM1ZTI,"I wish I had seen this on opening night with a theater full of Twihards (they at least entertain me). I'll admit they are enthusiastic and are passionate (but please take a joke, no book/film/TV is free of this), unlike when I saw Harry Potter 7 Part 2, there was never one reaction from the audience except when Julie Walters kills Helena Bonham Carter. So I settled for an audience of nine (myself and my cousin included) this past Wednesday and I while I still think this franchise is an uninspired piece of crap, I was entertained by the sheer badness of it. Twilight and New Moon were horrible, Eclipse was OK and Breaking Dawn Part 1 was everything I hated about the first two movies times ten. This half was paced better and it seemed to go by rather quick for only an hour and fifty six minutes (I'll concede that Harry Potters 1 & 2 drag and are a chore for me to sit through and I enjoy that series). And like my complaint with Deathly Hallows being split in two, Breaking Dawn could've easily been one movie (it's bad enough that Hunger Games final book will be split in two). The cinematography was also very good but that's where my compliments end.

To get this out of the way; Edward as boring as ever and he needs to speak louder than a whisper so that way the audience can understand what he is saying. And for the love of god say it with a sense of urgency so that way you can sell the Voltori (did I spell that right) as a legitimate threat! Jacob just comes off as being a pedophile, waiting for when Renesme (did I spell that stupid name right) to grow older. Speaking of the child growing older; do several years pass in this movie as we see her grow or is she growing in real time before our eyes! The other vampires really don't do much of anything, same goes for the werewolves. And what's with the random super-powers some of these sparklers have? One has the power of Captain Planet (minus heart because this is Twilight), another has zappy powers and another has the powers of illusion. Any explanation? The CGI baby is the worst piece of CG I've ever seen (was it so hard to find a real baby or did it want to much money? Couldn't have been as costly as that fake baby)! And last I come to the open-mouthed, stuttering wonder herself; Bella! This girl has sacrificed nothing to get where she is and I mean nothing. She gets what she wants. No character arc, she's the same selfish girl she was when we first met her. People are risking their lives for her and she could care less if they die in the process. Edward was right to use her as a human shield during the ""climax"". I'd make a Kristen Stewart joke but that'd be like beating a dead horse.

And now to move on to the more controversial part of the film: the ending. I hear the book pissed off a lot of people when it was released. There was a build up to a confrontation and that never happened. This movie gives us a climax that's pretty impressive for this franchise. You have main characters getting offed, Dakota Fanning (after giving her one word of dialog, again money well spent) who was supposed to be this bada** character runs like a coward. My cousin, who I spoiled the ending for a few days earlier, was still in shock seeing Carlisle's severed head in Aro's hand (who made both of us die with his out of nowhere laugh scene, which rival's Voldemort's in Deathly Hallows 2). If only I could've cared about all of those werewolves falling into the earth but I had no idea which one was which other than Jacob who was running with vampire-Jesus girl in the opposite direction. Then Edward and Bella both have their only bada** moment in four films after taking down Aro and... it's all a dream. Yup you read that right, this movie pulled a freakin' Dallas for a lame copout (in all seriousness, no one I talked to got the Dallas reference but my sister got the comparison when I brought up an episode of Batman: The Animated Series. Even people who grew up and watched the show didn't get it and I've never even seen Dallas). This fight was the only time in all the films where I felt invested in what was going on and this one moment ruined it for me. There was this lady a few seats away from us who said ""What!?"" and the people in front of us weren't all that pleased either with conclusion. And then when they started the end credits and started showing every single character (and their actor) who's been in this franchise, I couldn't help but think of another book-to-film series that ended the same way. I understand why they did it but I also don't understand it. I had to ask my cousin who half of these characters were (like the three evil vampires from the very first movie or Bella's friends who never featured that much).

So out of four films (like Deathly Hallows, I count this as one) I think one and a half are OK. But overall, the franchise is pretty bad with boring characters and a bad plot (Bella and Edward's romance better than Scarlett and Rhett's? Seriously Stephanie Meyers?). I can't understand how these books/movies became so popular when there is much better vampire lore out there like Dracula or Dark Shadows (not the Johnny Depp movie). Though now that there's no more Twilight movies anymore, I've nothing else to look to forward to. Except the Hobbit Trilogy (an unnecessary trilogy but I'll take it over this any day). Les Miserables. Iron Man 3. Thor 2. Man of Steel (wow there's a lot I'm looking forward to over the next several months).",1354320000,3,5473,4.395463510848126
4999512,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I'd actually some time ago suggested that Breaking Dawn's Fatal Flaw was that it didn't have a BIG ENOUGH showdown at the end and also informed the naysayers that Edward & Bella would eventually equal a Six Million Dollar Man & Bionic Woman (Steve & Jaime) for 2012 and would (at saga's end) retroactively justify the last 3.5 books feeble unempowered co-dependent misery + whining which were a sort of estrocentric version of The Female Empowerment + Reproduction Dilemma + Odyssey.

Evidently Summit and Stephenie did their R & D because Battlefield Bad-Ass Bella was SO worth the wait -- Take THAT all of you ""You Disempowered My Daughter!"" Whiners! -- and restructuring The Entire Final Scene around information that Alice's Precognitive Abilities would TOTALLY have given her access to was Utterly BRILLIANT and a nice ExpandoCon vs a RetCon. Also, showing what would have happened in it's entirety and Jane getting her butt-kicked both mentally and physically was awesome.  As was the end-of-film wrap-up and that more-addictive-than-crack Christina Perry song all of my friends are Voo-Doo Dolling me for introducing them to it.

All that said, the rest of the movie disappoints for predictable reasons...

- KStew's Adulterous Harlotry is in the audience's unconscious and some scenes and lines are unintentionally funny + distracting.

- The Renesmee CGI is Horrible Beyond Belief and they should drop some coin to fix it.

- The Build-Up to Battle is boring and there's too many New Characters we have insufficient time to get to know or care about injected that are injected into the mix.

- The Feelings + Drama-Over-Logic is worthy of one of those Lifetime Chick Cop/Procedural Shows/Movies you can't quite take seriously as characters spend too much time emoting and reacting and too little time thinking, planning, and doing.

- We the audience lost a lot of momentum waiting to see what Bella 2.0 would be like and there was insufficient time at the start of Part 2.

All that said, short of making a 6-8 hour movie, I'm not sure the Filmmakers + Stephenie could/should have done anything differently and what they did they did very well.  In any event, like the end of Lord of the Rings it was nice to have my life back considering how much energy I invested in this saga.",1354233600,3,2289,4.891472868217054
4999513,4,B006JM1ZTI,"The ultimate chick flick series has come to an end. The moody Bella, smells good to both vampires and werewolves. She gets to live forever with the man she loves, hunt puma in a slit dress, and have a special child that she only has to raise for seven years. The child is both Edward's and Jacob's (My cat has litters that way.) and maybe the producer's kid too. Bella has her ultimate chick moment when she arm wrestles a guy and wins, then uses her special power and becomes a real head turner.

The highlight for me was when the Cullens sat Kristen Stewart down and gave her acting lessons. Yes I was howling at that point, yelling ""facial expressions!"" at the screen. What we found out is that Italian vampires are the bad guys. Eastern European vampires still have bad accents and Irish vampires eat British tourist. I didn't recognize Dakota Fanning (Jane) in this until after the credit roll. I need to get out more.

Similar to the Harry Potter series, people who don't read the books sense there are plot points missing or glossed over. I know I did. I had to have my niece once again rescue me with the details. Let me say again, this is a chick flick with a fight scene thrown in at the end for the guys. Not as emotional or ""gushy"" as first and fourth films. Better than the second film, but then what wasn't.

4999514,5,B006JM1ZTI,"No, I have never read the books yet, but was looking forward to the finale (?) part of the storyline.  Honestly, I think a movie should stand on it's own anyway. You should not have to read a book before you see the movie.

I thoroughly enjoyed the show.  The child was born last time and she grows so quick.  Even as an infant, you can see she is different, with a very ALIVE look about her. She grows remarkably fast and can do things like fly/leap into the air.  In this segment, the Voltare find out about the child and think the Cullens are hiding a child vampire.  They do not believe she was born of Edward and Bella.  Since Jacob has imprinted on the baby (and saved the whole Cullen family in doing so), the werewolves are bound to protect the child.  Of course, there is a conflict in the story and it was well accomplished. I was also happy to see the same Cullen folks returned to the movie.

As you watch this flick, you will notice several references that set this movie up for a follow on movie.",1353801600,,1010,4.21875

4999518,5,B006JM1ZTI,"If one had to describe one word about Twilight the Saga:  Breaking Dawn Part Two, unpredictable.  For fans that have followed the previous installments of the Twilight film series and the never-ending romance between Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), changes have taken place since Part One of Breaking Dawn.  Edward and Bella married and conceived an addition to the Cullen vampire clan, daughter Renesmee (Mckenzie Foy), and there is no longer tensions between Edward and Jacob (Taylor Lautner) who has become godparent to Renesmee; there are light-hearted moments throughout the film, especially Bella not taking a liking to Jacob calling Renesmee by the nickname of ""Nessie,"" which Bella somewhat snidely comments its relation to the Lochness Monster.  Aside, from the tongue-in-cheekiness, the premise of the storyline continues with the quest of the main characters to defeat evil so that good will prevail.  And now having Nessie as a part of the picture, things become a bit delicate within the vampire order when word reaches to the Volturi thousands of miles away of Nessie's place in the Cullen clan.

Breaking Dawn Part Two contains a series of surprising moments that viewers may not have expected.  A few of the characters that may have had subtle moments or parts in past installments will indeed share the spotlight with Edward, Bella, and Jacob.  One of the most notable is Alice Cullen (Ashley Greene), whom possessed the ability and power to predict the future, and by the conclusion of the film, the most eye-popping moments flash before viewers' eyes; the scenes are amazingly done and much credit to the screenwriters and Director Bill Condon and of course, the cinematographers.  But other observable moments are the addition to other characters within the vampire order, which provides a somewhat international flare to the storyline.  Vampire patriarch Carlisle Cullen bands together cohorts to attempt to defeat the Volturi, and they are a mix of so-called ""Hall of Nations"" of vampires that have had their share of war stories.  For example, Garrett (Lee Pace) who had fought during the Battle at Yorktown and the Revolutionary War and sarcastically comments of having gone through the first and second British invasions and did not quite like the Beatles, two Amazonian women, Vladimir (Noel Fisher) and Stefan (Guri Weinberg) trailblazers within the Romanian terrain, and several other vampire nomads.  Without revealing so much of the climax of the film, there are moments that suggest the premise beyond good versus evil that stretches to the point in this film of survival of the fittest within the vampire hierarchy of immortality versus the mortal world.  The Native American figures that are presented near end of the film show the symbolism and ironic undertones.

The film appears to be the end of the Twilight series of films.  By the end of the last scene, Christina Perri's ""A Thousand Years"" plays and accompanies a montage of close-ups of Edward and Bella from the previous films, and thereafter, the film credits roll and the names and faces of the entire cast of this film and the previous three films; For diehard Twilight fans, the credits appear to be a farewell address.  And may this be the conclusion to the Twilight series?  With the last concluding scene, the possibilities loom in the balance.",1353628800,7,3379,5.114545454545454
4999519,3,B006JM1ZTI,"I could say that I've never been a fan of the Twilight series, but as a gamer that would be untrue - I've always been a fan of Twilight before Twilight existed.  The similarities between the Twilight series and White Wolf's World of Darkness setting are too numerous to count, but suffice it to say before the whole ""vampires, and werewolves, and faeries, oh my"" craze took off, White Wolf had a rich campaign setting where all of these races not-so-peacefully coexisted.  With the exception of perhaps Anne Rice, the proliferation of gothic romance and gothic superheroes has its origins in the structure of White Wolf's games.  Ironically, White Wolf's sole attempt to capitalize on its own creation failed as a television show.  Horror fans might not like the current crop of sparkly vampires, but they are direct descendants of vampires in role-playing games.

The RPG vampire branched the genre into new territories. Vampires were no longer content with just sucking blood. They now can read minds, fly, shrug off sunlight, control the elements, create illusions, zap people with a touch - they're gothic superheroes, basically.  This is a long-standing criticism of the White Wolf series of role-playing games, which ended up being less about horror and more about cool powers wielded by amoral beings. Even the enmity between vampires and werewolves was established in the World of Darkness - because vampires need someone to feel superior to and werewolves make for an excellent lower-class foil.

All those elements are in full force in Stephenie Meyers' ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn"" final chapter. There's the Volturi clan (a lot like the World of Darkness' Ventru clan) who enforces the rules (like White Wolf's Masquerade) that keep vampires hidden from society at large.  There's the specialization accompanying each vampire's abilities (like Bella, AKA ""trampire"" Kristen Stewart).  There's questions of loyalty to one's mate, one's fledglings, and one's clan.  And it all centers on Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy), the half-vampire child born of Bella and Edward when she was human. Or in other words: Blade.

Fans of the series won't care about any of this of course, which is why Twilight focuses on Stewart's sleek new vampire form and husband Edward (Robert Pattinson).  The only interesting high point is that awkward moment when everyone realizes that third wheel werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner) has ""imprinted"" on Renesmee, which supposedly explains why Jacob's been attracted to Bella all this time - he was actually attracted to her future daughter. If this sounds a bit squicky, it is. The movie doesn't shy away from it, complete with Bella threatening Jacob in a screaming match that's the most emotion Stewart shows the entire film.  And in case there's any doubt as to Jacob's future intentions, he asks Edward, ""so now can I call you dad?"" It sounds an awful lot like an arranged marriage.

There's a lot of female under-empowerment throughout Twilight: Bella's stronger than everyone else but doesn't fight; she only shields (she's basically the cleric/buffer of the group), Renesmee's aforementioned older male counterpart has been assigned without her consent to protect her from harm. And there a lot of ""native""-style vampires who clearly identify their cultural affiliation by dressing in outdated attire.

There's also a lot of loving gazes, a lot of talking about the future, and not much else - this is a paranormal romance, after all. The big payoff is in a massive vampire/werewolf battle that delivers on all the pent-up frustration that builds through the first half of the film. It almost makes it all worth it.

The producers split ""Breaking Dawn"" into two films in hopes of making twice as much money. You'd think that they could have tossed a few grand to a writer and had that person refine the script a bit. There just isn't a whole lot of substance here. Things do pick up a bit toward the end, and the big fight sequence is okay. The best part of the film is the girl who plays Renesmee, though. I have no idea where they found that kid, but she totally looks like she could be the love child of Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart, if they'd reproduced when they were like 13 years old. Also, this movie should win Stewart a Razzie, hands down. In every single scene, she scrunches up her face and looks like she is super constipated.

4999525,4,B006JM1ZTI,"While I enjoyed the twist at the end of the movie, I must say the thing that stood out to me was the fact that the wolfpack was completely dropped from the story. There was a blink you missed it shot of Sam, Seth and the back of Leah's head during a Christmas gathering. That was it! They show up in their wolf form at the finale but aside from Jacob hanging around to babysit his future bride he didn't have much importance here either. Why was this?? I will say Breaking Dawn was always my least favorite of the books because I did not agree with the direction the storyline took. So I do think the director did the most with the material. I also have grown fond of all the actors playing their characters and think they all did a fine job.
*********MILD SPOILERS*********

I was also baffled by Jacob's about face. 'You guys look great together' when he sees Bella and Edward after her rebirth. Wait...wasn't this the girl you would have died for a few days ago? I'm sorry, the whole imprint thing just never resonated with me. I would have liked to see Jacob have to pick up the pieces and find his own happiness (with someone who could relate, like Leah), not settle for the ex love of his life's daughter. And does he no longer attend school? He just hangs around the Cullen's mansion full time now?

I did like some of the vampire friends and think they made some great casting decisions. The actors playing Alistiar, Kate, Tanya, Benjamin, and Eleazar were surprisingly interesting and added some depth (though the movie had no clear beginning, it just felt like it left off where the other one ended, kind of like a to be continued on a tv show).

I also felt sentimental and a little sad when they showed the ending montage of all characcters throughout the series. As a fan from back when New Moon was originally published, I'm sad to see things come to an end.

But the Cullens are horribly disgusting and immoral. They stand by and watch one of their ""friends"" kill a human just because he was singing a song he didn't like. This monster Garreth is one of the good guys???? Yeah right! Then there is still the fact that most of the vampires they invited to witness were killing people and were not told that they had to stop killing while visiting. Honestly, is their really any difference between these ""good"" vampires and the Volturi? Yeah, yeah, I know what you are thinking: The enemy of my enemy is my friend. But theyd idn't have to embrace them and tell them to come back any time they chose to. They acted selfishly and they chose what humans died by bringing them.",1353196800,11,1039,4.411458333333333
4999529,3,B006JM1ZTI,"I gave it 3 stars only because I'm rounding up from the 2.5 it probably deserves.  The first hour and a quarter the movie was cheesy and with horrible lines (""you nicknamed my daughter after the loch Ness monster?)  but in my opinion the acting was at least better than the rest.  The CGI of the baby and little girl was so horrible I was actually embarrassed for the actors in the scenes who couldn't have known during shooting how silly they would look interacting with it.  It was simply awful.

Now, what saves the movie is the last 20 minutes.  I thought it was an incredible twist only truly able to be appreciated by readers of the books.  I bet it made Stephanie Meyer wish she wrote it that way.  It was fun to experience the audiences astonishment as events unfolded... And to be honest, I wrestled with my own unexpected feelings as I watched it.  In the end though,  those last 20 minutes and the great performance
(as usual)  by Michael Sheen saved the movie from being a wasted night.  In fact,  the last 20 minutes alone ALMOST makes me want to see it again.",1353196800,,1073,4.385786802030457
4999530,3,B006JM1ZTI,"Saw it and it was good, not great. Good twist towards the end. But it would seem the story should end with Bella and Edward and be picked up by Jacob and Renesmee, but that may not happen for a while, since Stephenie Meyer hasn't written anything in a while and kinda seems she doesn't want to either. I get no sense of closer with this movie/series as I did with Harry Potter, yes longer series and all. But it(HP) really gave you that feeling it was the end. The Twilight Saga feels like there could be more out of it. I would love to see a spin-off and think it would do well. But overall with all the movies in this series, I felt let down. I read a few of the books including Breaking Dawn and it just seemed they tried to get a lot in a short time. This was a two hour movie and they could've made it easily two and a half. So if you loved the series all together before this movie, you might wanna brace yourself. Cause the end doesn't feel like a ending at all and you maybe kinda ticked off at the end, like I was.",1353196800,2,1023,3.995121951219512
4999531,5,B006JM1ZTI,"They movie was really great. I am really only writing this to let you all know, when you go to see the movie and the very shocking thing happens near the end that makes you think they ruined Twilight forever, don't storm out of the theater like I wanted to, it's all worth it in the end!!",1353110400,3,288,4.0701754385964914
4999532,5,B006JM1ZTI,"Breaking Dawn - Part 2 was a great ending to the Twilight series. The screenwriter did a great job of trimming down the last half of the book into a concise and action packed movie. Thankfully, there are no cheesy wolf talking scenes like in the first Breaking Dawn. However, I was not a fan of baby Renesmee. The director digitally imposed actress Mackenzie Foy's face onto all the younger versions of Renesmee. The result was unrealistic and creepy, especially when Renesmee is still the size of an infant. I think just using a real baby's face would have been fine.

This movie introduces several new vampires that come to help the Cullens confront the Volturi. The casting of these new vampires was superb. They all looked just like I would have expected from their descriptions in the book. Seeing how beautiful the female Denali vampires are just underscored in my mind how miscast Nikki Reed is as Rosalie. Since Rosalie is supposed to be one of the most beautiful vampires ever, she should look like these women. Something is especially wrong about Rosalie's hair in this movie - I'm pretty sure it's a wig and it's really bad. I think a natural blonde should have been cast as Rosalie from the beginning.

You may have heard there is a twist in the movie that is not in the book. It's true and it took my breath away. I've heard that purists who are not happy with the twist have been walking out before the movie ends. STAY! You must stay - that is all I will say about that.",1353110400,3,1485,4.496296296296296
4999533,2,B006JM1ZTI,"I read all the Twilight series books and I own all the Movies except the latest one which is only out in the theaters right now. I loved all of the Twilight Series books.  I did not like all of the Movies.

I thoroughly enjoyed Twilight the first movie in the series. I found it to be a very pleasurable and there was never a dull moment. It gave the characters of the book the uniqueness and personalities of what I expected from the book. The movie gave life to the book in a way that was very pleasurable and made me want more. I could not wait to see the next movie in the series.

New Moon the second movie in the series kept the story moving while not giving away all that will be happening in the future books or movies. It showed the intensity of the love between Bella and Edward. It also showed the intense relationship of Bella with Jacob. I loved the scene in the movie where time went by month by month and you could feel Bella's pain and aloneness. There were some really good scenes that were touching and added to the love story of Edward and Bella while leaving you wanting to see more of the story of Bella, Jacob, Edward, and the rest of the characters in the book.

The third book and movie Eclipse was also exceptionally enjoyable. I found all the Characters personalities were brought out even more and it made you understand and love the Cullen family even more. It brought the story to a new level of intensity. It gave us more information about the characters themselves. I was impressed with the Wolves and the fights. This movie also left us wanting to see the rest of the Twilight Story.

Then the fourth book and movie Breaking Dawn part 1 came out. Within the first 30 minutes of the movie I was totally disappointed. They had changed the story or added to it.  They had put information in the movie that did not add to the story itself. What they added made me wonder if the director understood what people that read the books enjoyed about the Twilight Series books.
I wondered if they just needed to add time to the movie to make 2 movies out of the one book.  I really felt they could have done the last book all in one movie and when the last movie came out they proved that they could have done a much better movie by using the original story of Breaking Dawn.
There were so many moving moments in the book Breaking Dawn that were left out of the Movie. The Characters in the book and their stories were left out of the breaking Dawn movies.  There were so many moving moments in the book that were left out of Breaking Dawn part 1 and part 2. Both of he Breaking Dawn Movies were a total disappointment.
In fact I was so disappointed and bored with the movie that I did not even want to see the end of the Movie.
With the first 3 books and Movies I reread orI rewatched the movies several times thoroughly enjoying them. The fourth movie Breaking Dawn part 1 I tried to watch it a second time before I went to go see Breaking Dawn part 2. I didn't get all the way through the movie and I just turned it off.
I really feel the first 3 movies are the real stories of the lives of the people in the Twilight Series books and that the last 2 movies are not from the same Twilight series books and I was totally disappointed with both Breaking Dawns.",1353110400,6,3282,4.231629392971246
4999534,5,B006JM1ZTI,Saw Breaking Dawn 2 last night and it was everything I hoped it would be and more! Kristen did such a great acting job as vampire Bella. A lot of action! Also loved seeing other Vampires. The ending tied in all of the movies and completed the series. But Alice's vision left the ability for a sequel if one is made. We are going to see it again with friends this weekend!,1353110400,,371,4.166666666666667
4999535,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I won't spoil the movie by telling readers about the new part.  You will have to go see the movie for that.
I will say that I cannot imagine a better way to end this story.  It was everything I could have hoped for, except the promise of yet another book and movie!
It was so thoughtful to include the full cast of all the movies in the credits at the end of the movie.  So great to see all those faces again.
What an amazing four years this has been for all of us fans!  After reading the books, I dreamed about having them made into movies. I even pictured Kristen Stewart as Bella! None of it has been anthing but delightful.
Thanks to Stephenie Meyer for writing the only love story I've ever been able to appreciate, to Melissa Rosenberg for turning it into fabulous screenplays and all the other magical movie people for giving us the lovliest fairytale of our time.
Go see Breaking Dawn - Part II",1353110400,94,903,4.2631578947368425

4999538,5,B006JM1ZTI,Just saw the movie and I was very very happy with it. I've read all of the books and think they did an amazing job! Sad to see it end but I have all the books and movies so far. Loved it loved it. And Kristen's acting was very good!!,1353024000,3,233,3.68
4999539,5,B006JM1ZTI,"First, I have to say this, people who review a movie before it even comes out irritate the HELL out of me. They basically write a synopsis of the book, why?! It AIN'T the MOVIE!! I wish Amazon would review the 'reviews' better and delete the ones that have zero relivance to the actual movie/book, whatever. Also...ANY SPOILERS should be deleted....not everyone wants to read a rant about 'this and that' in a film they haven't seen yet. i've had many a movie ruined bc someone just couldn't keep their yaps shut. Wish those would be deleted as well.

Ok, NOW, I saw the film last night, and I WILL NOT BE PUTTING IN SPOILERS, so you can read on and not worry about having it screwed up for you.

It was very well done. The action, the script, the detail, was all excellent and it did follow the book well. There were several differences, which I won't go into, but believe me, if you're a fan of the books you'll def notice them. ;)

I would love to say more, but being a person who hates spoilers I won't...once you see the movie you'll know what I'm talking about...lets just say, you'll be talking about it when you leave.

My only beef, when you have movies that are two parts, and the second part begins, you almost feel like you're in a limbo. In essence, you're starting a 'new' film in the middle of the story and feel a tad off balance. I would've really liked it, and it would've only added about 5 minutes or less to this installment, if they'd added in the last scene of the first movie (when she's on the table and Rosalee and Alice are cleaning her up and she's changing)...just to blend them better and make you feel like you're on more solid ground. I think it would've been a nice add; and would've made the audience happy to see a bit from the first part to seamlessly blend into the second. Even if it was from the birth on....I think it wouldn't have taken anything away from it, only adding to it and making the transition more complete.  I def felt like I was watching two different films. That being said, I can understand why, to an extent, because they were ending one chapter and beginning another. I just would've like it better the other way.

Good conclusion for the movies, but I feel a tad sad, too. You really don't know how much you've invested in characters until the series comes to a close. The Cullen's were a tigh-knit family that loved each other and were devoted and loyal.  Traits that aren't overly apparent in todays society of divorce, anger filled family lives, discontent and so on. Strangly, it's a family I wouldn't mind marrying into if it existed.  I'm sad to see them go...

4999540,5,B006JM1ZTI,"I thought that the story came out excellent, I was glad that the trio was able to get things fixed between them. The fight scenes were excellent as well and very believable, and if you like possible futures this gives off some very good, but heart-wrenching ones. For werewolf fans you get some very good scenes and vampire fans, this is going to really going to get your interest. I am looking forward to getting this on dvd when it comes out. For series lovers see this you're going to love it.",1353024000,73,496,4.4021739130434785
4999541,5,B006JM1ZTI,I saw this tonight when it came out in theaters and it was amazing and very accurate to the book. The part I loved was that they added a HUGE action scene at the end of the movie that was not in the book. It was even more intense then the action scene they had in Ecllipse. I think this helped the movie a lot. Awesome movie. Great conclusion to the Twilight Series. Well Done,1353024000,16,376,4.026666666666666
