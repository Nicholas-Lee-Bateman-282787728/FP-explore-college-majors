The video is fun, energetic and instructive. Free style is one of the hardest dances to become comfortable with; however,  Christy is a wonderful teacher and she makes it fun and easy to learn!
P.S.
****It will really grab the kids attention.*****",1243036800,,384,4.892307692307693
8129820,3,B000GAKNA6,"I rented this at my library. Christy looks a bit cheesy & is so earnest that she also sounds cheesy, but she can dance pretty well. As she says, she's a good teacher, so I can ignore the cheesiness mostly. There aren't that many dance videos at all that break it down as well as she does.
It's basically what you see on the cover, her & 4 dancers showing you many diff dance moves each only 1 min each. She breaks it down, doing the upper body & lower body separate going slow a few times & then speeds it up to normal speed a few times. This may seem too short a time, but the most import things are what I listed above that you don't get elsewhere. She even first does it at it's rudimentary level so you can see how easy the move is before you add all the style, speed & fluidity.
The camera stays far away to see all 4 dancers mostly, but zooms in when you need to & especially on the feet during the tutorial.
There is some lame early 90s computer graphics, but that can be ignored. One of the dancers is really fluid & talented & I concentrate on him only.
The moves are:
Step stomp, Big slide, Sidewinder, University stomp, Hammer kicks, Jumpin' jacks, Funky jump, Breakin' it, Skeeter, Full skeeter, Stop & go, Wavin', Tickin', Egyptian, 2 Plus 2, Kick & out & Kick kross in about 20 min.
There are also 3 practice routines for about 5 min total.",1185494400,,1354,4.17175572519084
