8674156,1,B00MR9HMQ2,"Trashy rerun of my favorite west coast band.  Marty and Grace must not be singing the same song (Somebody To Love).  The interview is shallow and worthless.  Signe at least made the cover, if not the actual footage.  This is a sour deal that doesn't even belong in my Airplane ""Flight Log"".  Nothing but an anxiously awaited preordered ripoff.  Stay away from this.",1415750400,7,365,4.714285714285714
8674157,1,B00MR9HMQ2,"I'm sorry to say that everything on latest film release by a once proud band has been previously available on other J.A.  DVDs except for ""Somebody To Love"" at Woodstock.  Before anybody gets exited about that the picture and audio are not in sync.  Then to trash the band worse original female singer Signe Anderson is pictured on the disc itself and back cover.  She not  shown  whatsoever in the film presentation.  Talk about borderline false advertising. Another bummer is the picture quality is a major drop off compared to the official ""Fly Jefferson Airplane"" DVD.  To all old fans save your money and skip this until the band itself and RCA consider a possible 50th Anniversary release.  Until that possibility a better companion DVD to ""Fly J.A. "" is the uneven ""Happy Landing""..... ONE FOLLOW UP NOTE: Getting back to Signe Anderson.  She can be seen as a back-up singer for Jefferson Starship in the VHS tape ""Troubadours Of Folk Music"" that came out in the 1990s that also featured Paul Kantner, Jack Casady and Marty Balin.  She also can be heard in a radio interview bonus track on Marty's DVD plus JA's ""Fly"" presentation that was mentioned above.",1415664000,8,1163,4.765
