3847674,3,B0024OW1IO,"I found this to be a good alternative to my workout routine.  It was fun and engaging.  And you really do get a good sweat and workout.  Besides, it brings back some fun memories with the dances.",1264377600,,195,4.216216216216216
3847675,5,B0024OW1IO,"I usually go running outside, but now that it's too cold to be outside I decided to start using exercise DVD's for regular workouts. Sarita Lou's Hip Hop Cardio program is awesome and really fun! I thought that I might get bored doing a video, but her funky moves and positive attitude kept me going the entire time!!!",1262649600,6,318,4.5
3847676,5,B0024OW1IO,"I'm a daily exerciser so it is very important for me to A)have workout variety so my muscles don't get used to the same old routine, and B)Must be something I find enjoyable and satisfying.

I do many types of workouts, pilates, yoga, step, kickboxing, but dance has a special place in my heart because I grew up taking lessons and I love anything that is dance oriented.  This routine is fun, no doubt.  The routine has body rolls, chest pops and lots of fun moves that keep your heart rate up.  I did both the old school and the sexy sculpt together to make one longer work out and that was just right for me.

I felt Sarita Lou did a good job cuing the moves but this is not all about a perfect way to do a move, you take the base move and you add in your own flavor, so it is not important that you do it ""exactly"" like she does it, just learn the move and then add your own style to it...that is what dance is all about.  The less uptight you are the better. Just go with your body and have a good time.

The workout is comprised of a 7 minute warmup, two workouts of approx. 20 minutes and a 5 minute cooldown.  I would say this is an intermediate workout.  A beginner to dance may need a few times to catch the steps, but someone that works out with dance videos or has a background in dance would catch the moves fairly quickly.  I did break a sweat doing the workout and felt much like I would after I had been just out on the dance floor having a good time.

I also liked the instructor's style-she is not chirpy, overly enthusiastic, etc.  She looks like she is just having a good time. Her form is good and the stretches at the end felt great.

I like this addition to my dance videos and would definitely seek out more videos where she is featured as the instructor.

Let yourself go a little and dance in the livingroom....it's good for you and it is a whole lot of fun!",1262476800,19,1884,4.098092643051771
3847677,5,B0024OW1IO,So much fun and really easy to get into. Love Sarita Lou - does she have any more DVD's?,1261008000,3,88,3.6842105263157894
3847678,5,B0024OW1IO,"Sarita Lou's energy got me up and off the couch.  Although I couldn't keep up with her the first few days the video was fun and I found myself doing the moves around the house.  The intensity of the workout was a challenge at first, but now I enjoy it!",1260835200,8,252,4.02
3847679,1,B0024OW1IO,"I ordered this video for myself and my daughter to work out- we thought it would be fun. The music was lame- not anything that got us wanting to get up and go- more like boring background music. The video only features the same girl working out, and it feels like a traditional work out- not like a dance routine. We were hoping to dance, have fun, and get our heart rates going- instead we turned it off after about 20 minutes and were sad we had wasted our money on it!",1340150400,,471,4.130434782608695
3847680,2,B0024OW1IO,The music on this video is generic hiphop beats---no familiar songs on it so the workout quickly becomes monotonous. I also found the workout a bit hard on the knees.,1339977600,,166,4.566666666666666
3847681,1,B0024OW1IO,If you are the least bit overweight & haven't exercised in while  - don't start with this video.  The warmup was more energetic than I thought a warmup should be and I found the routine very hard on the knees.,1328400000,,209,4.2
3847682,5,B0024OW1IO,"I first saw this workout on the FIT TV channel.  It is worth the money. I only wish there were more like it.  It beats those high priced workout exercise videos advertised on the television, anyday.",1319932800,,198,4.472222222222222
3847683,5,B0024OW1IO,"I'm a relatively fit person and do a lot of Zumba, but can't always get to the gym.  I have been looking for a dance fitness video that I could do at home that gave me a similar workout and this one was great!!  You can do this at a lot of levels, toning the movements down if you're not as fit, or doing the full moves and really getting a good workout in.  I loved that there were both cardio and strength sections,and the strength section was wayyyy more fun than lifting weights in a gym, but I truly am feeling it my legs especially.  The instructor was awesome, motivating and not annoying.  I was feeling really proud of my ability to master the steps in just one go, and then I saw her ""freestyle"" section at the end where she was doing ""real"" dancing and was blown away - she's an awesome dancer.  Anyway, I'll definitely add this one to my regular rotation.  Thanks!",1298073600,3,876,4.240963855421687
3847684,5,B0024OW1IO,"Bought this the same time as another hip hop style workout.  This one is much better.  It is enjoyable, gets your heartrate up, and allows for some of your own variation on moves.  It is not so dancy that you have to learn a choreography sequence prior to working out like other videos, rather she just gradually has you add on to some basic moves as you go along.  Good upbeat music too.",1291075200,,388,4.273972602739726
3847685,2,B0024OW1IO,"From the reviews, this workout seemed great. However, it's possibly the most boring video that I've tried. Of perhaps the first 20 minutes, 15 of them are spent on the same basic move. When she does mix it up, again, it is repetitive. There are maybe 8 different moves in this video, that are simply done over and over again. On top of that, the cuing could be better, and the moves could be detailed a bit more. She kind of just jumps into them.

I will say, she seems lovely, and some of the moves can be fun. However, this video is simply too repetitive, and too easy (I hardly broke a sweat, I may as well have gone on a walk outside) to be worth the $15. I gave it two chances, both times I could hardly get through the first portion before putting in a different dvd. While I would love to add hip hop into my routine, unfortunately, this isn't the video to do that.",1275609600,2,872,4.159763313609467
3847686,4,B0024OW1IO,"Your instructor, Sarita Lou, a lively & energetic dancer will lead you through 2 light-aerobic dance workouts: 20 minutes of OLD SCHOOL and SEXY SCULPT.  You will have a basic, key move and you will return to that move once you add on.  OLD SCHOOL seemed to focus on the lower body with deep plies, sliding, and hops among others.  There are moves that are based on the single, single, double beat, which Sarita failed to cue us on.  She did cue us in SEXY SCULPT, though.  In OLD SCHOOL, Sarita didn't really focus on the arms, not until SEXY SCULPT. SEXY SCULPT includes body rolls, squats, step it out plies, et al.  Overall, the music was appropriate in helping with rhythm and the dance steps, the choreography was generally easy to follow,  uncomplicated, and fun to do.  The only thing I found was the lighting was a bit dim.",1275350400,,832,4.5
3847687,3,B0024OW1IO,"As someone who works out with dance DVDs regularly, I was pretty disappointed by this one. I barely broke a sweat and the instructed had regular ""break"" periods where you are just supposed to swing your hips.

To me, this is simply not a real work out. I did the entire DVD and didn't really feel like I had worked out at all.

This DVD would be more suited for beginners who don't have much dance experience and aren't really in good shape.",1270512000,4,441,4.301204819277109
3847688,5,B0024OW1IO,"The instructor is enjoying herself, and the music isn't terrible, plus the kids love to do it with me! A fun workout for the whole family!",1268352000,2,138,4.346153846153846

8350813,5,B0024OW1IO,Super fun dance workout~! I split up the workout & do old-school on Sundays & sexy sculpt on Wednesdays so that I don't get bored,1467849600,,129,4.2

8350815,2,B0024OW1IO,"I guess the instructions are okay, but the ""music"" seems to be nothing but an electronic beat which drives me crazy after awhile.  I was expecting hip hop music.  I no longer use it.",1452988800,,182,4.323529411764706

8350818,1,B0024OW1IO,"This tape was SO boring, the routine was beyond terrible and you won't work up a sweat. I turned it off half way thru.",1391904000,,118,3.9583333333333335
8350819,4,B0024OW1IO,I'm not particularly well-coordinated and was happy to find a dance workout that I can keep up with.  It will get your heart pumping without making you frustrated with the steps.,1390089600,,178,4.741935483870968
8350820,4,B0024OW1IO,"I liked it, Sarita Lou, took me back ""old school"", the dances were so EASY/FUN! I had a ""blast"", no you don't really
break a sweat! But I guarantee, you will get your heart rate up, which is as important!",1370476800,,204,4.125
8350821,5,B0024OW1IO,"What I really like about this video is the way Sarita teaches. It is step by step, so it is easy to get the moves fairly quickly. It is way more fun than doing any regular aerobics class. As for intensity, I found myself at a good level with the first workout; I was sweating and breathing heavily. The second section was much more low-key. I only rented this one. I imagine it might get a little boring after a while. It would be great though if Sarita had a series of DVDs, so that you can have fun, get the exercise, as well as the variation. I'd buy it! But this dvd was a good one to rent.",1341705600,,594,4.0
