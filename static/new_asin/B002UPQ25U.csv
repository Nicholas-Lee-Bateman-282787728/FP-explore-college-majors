3992261,1,B002UPQ25U,VERY low budget.  I had to get this because my friend is in this but wow I couldn't even finish the movie.  If the music would have been quieter during some scenes it would have been better. The price was right for this though. Story was cheesy but I think if they would have had more to work with it would have been better.,1304380800,7,324,4.046875
8381427,2,B002UPQ25U,"A man and his girlfriend in a car discuss college aspirations before kissing.  He asks if she wants to go somewhere that's quiet.  They meet up with another man and his girlfriend.  The low budget way this movie is written has the music too loud so you can't hear the cliched conversations these characters are having with each other!  When a man and his girlfriend are making out in a car they feel a loud bump.  No, the boyfriend wasn't big in the pants or anything.  An actual bang on the car!  The teen gets out and looks for the guy who's stalking him.  Suddenly something invisible smacks him and drags him into the darkness.

A man visits his wife at a graveyard when his daughter shows up.  He says thank goodness she has her mother's looks and not his.  The daughter says she woke up this morning and had a feeling her father was in trouble.  The daughter wishes she had gotten to know her mother.  Two guys sit at a diner talking about coffee.  The one guy says he loves the peace and quiet.  He came from Chicago and doesn't miss the paperwork.  They say they make their own coffee because Darlene's way of making coffee isn't great.  She's the waitress or owner of this diner.  She says the sheriff snores so loud the walls rumble.

They get a phone call from someone naked Hank.  He's freaked out because he thinks he sees a body hanging on his tree.  When the cops visit the scene we hear frantic 80's-style synth music that I like a lot for one thing but yeah... that IS definitely a body hanging on a tree branch!  Hank says the body wasn't here last night.  The cops want Hank to cut the body so nobody in town knows about this.  What?  That's not what cops are supposed to do!  After a discussion the cop changes his mind and says to cover it with a blanket instead.  The cop tells Hank to get Doc and say it's an emergency.

By the lake the cops see a deserted red car with the doors open.  In the glovebox he finds that the car belongs to a Mr. McCallister.  He describes the condition of the car.  We see a young woman walking down a road by herself surrounded by fields.  A man drives by and asks if she's alright.  She passes out so he places her in the car and takes her to the hospital.  The doctor asks the guy questions he doesn't know the answer to.  The woman wakes up in her hospital bed and appears frightened.  She walks down the dark hallway and pulls a blanket off a patient.  Her eyes open and the girl.... wakes up.  It was just a dream!  But when she wakes up she sees a little girl say ""He's coming for you all"".

Two little girls play on the sidewalk when their toy lands in a nearby bush.  The one girl jumps in the bush and screams as the scene ends.  The sheriff visits the woman at the hospital.  The sheriff reminds her that she passed out with bruises on her body and that the doctor said she's suffering from dehydration.  The doctor tells the sheriff that he got a phone call concerning the two little girls who went missing behind the bush but their toys remain where they played.  While the doctor is explaining this a man in the back hallway disappears.

The autopsy doctor removes body parts from a patient.  Several body parts, haha.  The woman who passed out leaves the hospital unannounced, but leaves behind a small stick of barbed wire on her bed.  The autopsy report says that the body hanging from the tree bled to death.  He was hanging for 20 minutes before he died.  The doctor removed all the wire from his body and found the cuts are horizontal due to the barbed wire, but oddly he detected vertical cuts as well.  The doctor opens up the dead body and sees the word ""Ravage"" on the dead body's chest. The cops think the barbed wire lying on the woman's bed is related to the guy hanging from the tree trying to stop the killer from getting her last night.

The sheriff drives out to talk to a man.  He shows him the barbed wire and the man gets uncomfortable.  The cop says ""It's starting again!""  The barbed wire maniac is haunting this Kansas town!  Wait no, haha.  Actually edit- yes!  The cop says we'll be in serious crap if we don't get this taken care of fast.  The girl in the beginning who lost her mom brings her friend over to her home.  I was hoping something would happen to them but no!  I guess I need to think small.

We see a woman watching TV on a couch and drinking out of the bottle.  Her friend wants to know what's going on.  We then hear a loud scream.  It's the next day and her friend asks if everything's okay.  They want to call the one friend's dad.  We see a man in the diner asking for someone named Rob.  This story's starting to get messy, but this pales in comparison to how messy the story's going to *really* get pretty soon!  I hope you're good at keeping track of several names because I'm not!  The sheriff says he found Rob's red car.  There was no indication it was an accident.  The sheriff says he's dead, but the man says he probably got drunk, did something stupid and is too afraid of his old man to come home.  The sheriff says he was murdered protecting his girlfriend Becky.  The man asks if they caught the killer but the sheriff says not yet.

The cops want to have a town meeting tonight.  A cop gets a phone call about the screaming from those girls in the previous scene.  The girls say a man named Ravage took Mary.  A mailman walks by and sees a man fall through his front door.  He calls for help while the man coughs up blood.

That's the first half of the movie.  It's MUCH better than the significantly more confusing and story-heavy second half.  Like I say, make sure you're paying super close attention to each and every character that's mentioned.  I failed.  I couldn't understand the story because it just became too much.  It was literally one character being linked to another one... and then another one... while more names popped up along the way.  The low budget feel of the movie doesn't help matters because the music is often louder than the conversations the characters are having with each other.  If that's not bad enough, the characters often mumble.  But in the end, trying to keep up with the story and characters isn't something I can say I accomplished.  It's too big of a story.  Yes it's possible to inflate a story to the point of being a ball of confusion.

Here we go *shakes!*

We see a story about a man's great grandfather who was the first mayor of Hamilton 100 years ago, the town these people live in.  We're now taken back to see the great grandfather's story.  His daughter wants to know if she's going to die because her mom died.  He promises she won't die like her mother did.  The father/great grandfather wants his daughter to promise she'll stay right here in Hamilton to take care of him.  She starts coughing, and the doctor doesn't know if there's anything he can do for her.  She asks again if she's going to die like mom did.  The doctor tries everything to lower her fever but he's out of luck.  He hasn't given up on her though.  We see a woman named Bata and her father Ravage.  The music being so loud drowns out the conversation but he basically says he has the medicine to cure the girl.

The father/great grandfather lets Ravage cure the girl.  It's obvious the background isn't really there.  Just look at that barn when they're outside!  A reverend approaches the father/great grandfather and says the family can't bring that kind of witchcraft into this town, but the father/great grandfather says that girl will die without a miracle.  Ravage is that miracle.  The reverend thinks Ravage is sent here by the devil to bring damnation to this town.  He recommends going to the store to grab some barbed wire and shovels and to pray for this evil the town is about to persevere.  The reverend talks to two boys and says he needs the help of God's work to lead the fight against the evil they're about to face.

Soon after a doctor sprinkles dust on the daughter's body and forehead.  Just then the reverend intervenes and punches him.  The reverend says the doctor is weak with his medicine and that's why he allows this evil to come into this town.  The father/great grandfather says God didn't answer any of his prayers so he didn't have a choice.  Just then the daughter dies.  I guess Ravage's magic didn't work.  The reverend says that's what happened when you violate God's laws.  The reverend doesn't want the father/great grandfather and his friend to be known as devil worshippers and participants of witchcraft to the people around town.  The Lord is for guidance- not the devil, or you'll be treated accordingly.

The man who buys barbed wire and a shovel approaches the reverend.  People end up getting their throats cut, a man strangled and a magic beam makes someone disappear.  Ravage says the reverend will pay for their crimes and the daughter will belong to him.  A man shoots Ravage in the forehead during an exchange of magical beam power.  Ravage burns alive and goes back to the devil.

Quite the story, but that's the easy part.  Now these cops mention their descendants, compare how they're related to their fellow cop friends while having a discussion around a table (since everyone in this town is a descendant of someone who used to live here) and the  cops even mention these descendants by name, so understanding the story from this point forward just got WAAAAAAY harder!

Back in present time the cops say the reverend wanted to let people know that he fought a demon and won.  He went around town bragging about it.  The story goes that Ravage would take all the daughter descendants and kill them.  5 years after the great grandfather story, the illness came back to town and nearly half the female population was wiped out in one summer.  A man says everyone at this table except the sheriff are descendants of the men who were there when Ravage was killed.  The town kept a book of all the names of the women and those who were born since then, and when something happened to them their name was crossed out.

There's only 6 women left alive in town.  One cop suggests giving Ravage the 6 women and he'd go away, but that won't work because the male descendants are still alive, and thus the possibility that more females would be born by the men's sons.  The men wonder how Ravage came back since they thought they stopped him permanently last time.  The reverend's grandson documented his encounter with Ravage and described everything he knew about it.  He came up with a theory on how to end the curse before he died 20 years ago.

We're now taken back 20 years ago.  We see a cop talking to Ravage in the forest.  A cop tries to shoot him but Ravage turns the cop's arm into a burning hot ball of fire.  The guitar rock here is very good!  The cops exchange more magical beams with Ravage.  Whenever they shoot Ravage he retaliates by shooting a beam of fire their way.  One cop manages to get close enough and touches Ravage's forehead with a hot coal before he's tossed backwards and disappears.  The cops say they need a new sheriff.

Back to present time.  The cops mention that word got around about the cops intentions and people locked their doors.  One man never married because of the curse and because his sisters were taken by Ravage.  The cops discuss how it's possible Ravage is back.  This story just got *really* elaborate in the last 20 minutes.  A phone call from Hank.  He had 3 girls with him, but the other 3 are gone.  The three ladies enter the autopsy room and have to stay there until the sheriff says it's time to go.  They mention Ravage and that he takes women.  One woman gets angry ""How typical- men do something bad and we have to pay the price!""

The autopsy doctor mentions that Ravage is going to come to any girl who's a descendant of the men who killed Ravage all those years ago.  One girl says ""Great, I'm going to get killed for something some stupid people did a long time ago"".  The doctor informs the women they're the last ones left.  The women start drinking alcohol when the lights in the room flicker.  When the lights come back on a woman is seen dead in the corner of the room.  The cop accidentally shot her.  A black ball of mist appears and smacks the doctor against the wall. The mist turns into a dimension and the one girl walks through it.  The doctor asks Ravage where he takes the girls, and when Ravage won't let go of his hand the doctor cuts it off.  The only bloody scene in the movie.  On a side note it's hilarious when the doctor tries to have a conversation with Ravage.  Ravage speaks in a voice so low you can't understand a single thing he says!

The cops break into the autopsy room and see the dead doctor and woman.  They conclude Ravage got all the girls and mentions the deaths that have happened in this room.  During a car ride the one cop mentions to the sheriff driver that there's another name not on the list- the sheriff's daughter.  She was not related to the line, but the other sheriff was.  The sheriff got married after he became sheriff.  Anna, the sheriff's wife, broke it off with another man before she started dating the sheriff.  Before they confronted Ravage, they had one final moment.  This is supposed to mean something but... I don't get it.  The story's too big for me!  Wow wow WOW is this story confusing!  Way too many characters being mentioned and it's impossible to keep track of them all.  Somehow Ravage tapped into the cops subconscious.  The sheriff and other cop decide to keep the conversation they're having between the two of them.

The sheriff tells her daughter to go to the church.  The cops meet up somewhere outside and play a coin flip game to see who gets to keep the amulet.  After they recite words Ravage appears.  He brings the hard rock music and the fireball shooting with him, but the cop has a blue laser beam.  The cop is hit in the back with the fireball.  This is hilariously bad and it's probably done that way on purpose.  The one cop makes an announcement- he works with Ravage.  His great grandfather is the other cops brother.  So confusing.

With this evil cops help Ravage can take the whole town if he so chooses.  He's been waiting for this opportunity for a long time.  We see a man get his head chopped off.  Awesome guitar riff.  It's over for Hamilton but with he (the evil cop) at Ravage's guide, Ravage and the cop can do whatever they want.  The one cop was holding out.  Ravage whispers something but we can't hear it.  Not sure if that was done on purpose either.  The cop says ""We're not going to let you just do what you want"" but the Ravage supporting evil cop says ""That's what you think!""  They exchange gunfire while the other cop shoots fire from his arm.  A flamethrower hand!

Somebody drives away.  The cops help a guy up.  This guy was trying to stop Ravage from taking a woman named Janet when he entered a dark hole and winded up here.  Ravage didn't leave- he's heading for the sheriff's daughter!  The other cop recommends using the amulet.  The girls in the church think it's creepy here.  They hear whispering in the darkness.  The lights turn on and a girl says a guy was after her but he's gone.  The man next to the girl says he's bleeding and wonders what happened.  The cop missed Ravage and shot the man instead.  They all see the sheriff's daughter in the corner with glowing eyes.  Ravage wants something with her but he mumbles with his evil voice so it's hard to tell what it is he wants.

The girls realize the one cop is helping Ravage.  She says ""You going to shoot me now?  You b******!"" in a poor acting performance.  The sheriff says to his daughter ""It's me.  I need you to walk over to me"".  The sheriff pulls out an amulet and a ball of fire shoots at her body.  ""If you want my daughter you have to come through me"".  The daughter repeatedly smacks Ravage.  The sheriff says to Ravage ""I know what happened to you.  What those guys did to you and your daughter was wrong but that's a long time ago and you had your revenge.  Can't we come to some kind of agreement?"" The sheriff then says ""Deal's off!"" and throws a ball of fire from his hand right at Ravage.  The daughter says ""They had their pain- it's time to come home"".  Ravage disappears and the sheriff and his daughter hug.  The movie ends with one cop sneaking up and attacking the other so it's not over like we think it is!

Wow, a tale of two halves.  The first half is a mystery related to a murder.  It's pretty good.  But the second half is some super confusing and elaborate history lesson concerning descendants and trying to keep track of a long list of names pertaining to how these cop and town characters are related to each other.  There's *way* too many characters being mentioned whenever the cops have discussions on the past events involving this Ravage creature, and it's crazy to expect anyone to actually absorb every one of these people's names.  It's quite confusing  trying to figure out the whole story.  Otherwise, appreciate the mystery story in the first half and laugh at the really poor magical powers used by the cops and Ravage!",1500768000,,17119,4.404929577464789

8381432,3,B002UPQ25U,"This is part of Prime now. So, if you have nothing else on the agenda, give it a try. First of all, be aware that this movie is very low budget. It's like a school play done with members of the town as actors. No, the acting isn't that good. No, the special effects aren't good. No, the sound isn't good in certain places. But, there is a story in there that is decent and with a bigger budget, probably would have been seen by a lot more people. Anyway, the basic premise of the movie is that way back when in the 1800's, the mayor's daughter fell ill and seemed like she would not make it. The Indian Shaman offered to help heal her since he had seen this disease before. Halfway through the healing, the local PREACHER MAN, who looked at this as witchcraft ordered some of the locals to kill both the Shaman and his daughter. The Shaman, before he was killed put a curse on all those that were involved that he would return and take their daughters as they had taken his. There are a few twists and turns, but that's the basics. Again, the feel of the movie is like you are watching a school play with the townspeople as actors. If you can deal with that, then go for it. I'm going to give it three stars for basically the storyline. And on a side note, as is today, as was then...things like this always begin with the words of a PREACHER MAN....a regular man just like you and I who thinks his interpretation is the only right interpretation.",1405382400,,1447,4.246376811594203

It probably could have been a decent movie if the filmmakers hadn't searched high and low to find the worst actors to ever live.  It's absolutely amazing just how bad each and every performance is.  There is not a single good actor, good moment, or redeeming quality about this film.  Save your time.  Ravage is the spirit of a native american wrongly killed by pioneers who seeks revenge; the sheriff's daughter banishes the ghost in the end by impersonating (channeling?) Ravage's daughter.
