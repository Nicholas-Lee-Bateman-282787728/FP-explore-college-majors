8267409,5,B0017VG5XC,"This is a solid Shaw Brothers film, definitely worth watching if you're into the rest of their catalog. It's through Celestial Pictures, so the image quality is great. Anybody giving this film less than 4 stars either didn't know what they were getting into with a Shaw Brothers film, or has bad taste.",1503446400,,302,4.716981132075472
8267410,4,B0017VG5XC,"A touch of the supernatural, madness, murder and kidnapping pretty girls! Yes, it's the Bat without wings... or is it? Fairly good offering from the Shaw Brothers, with a trio of heroes in pursuit of the villain. Betrayal, conniving, and then some! Manages to entertain.",1502928000,,270,5.022222222222222
8267411,4,B0017VG5XC,"It's a Shaw Brothers movie. That alone gets 2 stars before I even watch it. Image released it. That gets another star before I even put it in the player. It's in the original Mandarin, not dubbed, with Spanish or English subs. that also earns another star. I watched it. A great Shaw Brothers movie. Go look it up on IMDB, pay no attention to these idiots who have not educated themselves about the difference between good and bad movies. Didn't John Woo's entire kinetic aesthetic hinge on the balletic quality of his action sequences? Of course it did. nuff said. I rest my case.",1408665600,2,581,4.542857142857143
8267412,1,B0017VG5XC,"This movie had the plot to be good but it wasn't.  The kung fu scenes are not done well it literally looks like all the characters are doing a slow balerina dance.  I didn't even finish the movie.  It couldn't hold my attention for longer than five minutes.  This move is not worth buying at all. And anyone who didn't find this review helpful probably had something to do with the production of the movie, because the movie sucks, and there is no other way to put it.",1271721600,2,468,4.284090909090909
