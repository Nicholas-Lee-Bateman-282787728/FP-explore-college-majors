5777095,4,B00D7NRP8W,"The fourth volume of ""Regular Show"" has lurked its way onto a new DVD volume.  Yeah, it's a single-disc random assortment, but this one is special.  This volume has the two half-hour ""Terror Tales from the Park"" Halloween specials as seen on the Cartoon Network plus the following other episodes that each have a terrifying theme:

""Grave Sights"" - Rigby and Mordecai organize a fundraiser involving a 3-D horror flick.  However, the plucky pair has also let loose a horde of zombies !
""Ello Gov'nor"" - Rigby is becomes absolutely paranoid after watching an old horror movie involving a scary taxi driver.
""Skunked"" - The two find a skunk they think is dead, but springs to life right in front of them !  And it sprays Rigby turning the little raccoon into a hideous were-skunk !
""Meat Your Maker"" - Our duo is left in charge of the park's annual barbecue, but they accidentally ruin the hot dogs.  Now they must look for more in the meat locker they accidentally get locked in.
""The Best VHS in the World"" - The guys rent a VHS tape, but they soon discover it's no ordinary tape when they return it to the rental store.
""Skips' Stress"" - Their friend Skips discovers his stress level is dangerously high.  Therefore, the gang must embark on a quest to ring the legendary Stress Bell, and their quest becomes a rather difficult one.

As a bonus, there's a special feature you can watch called ""Villains Gallery"" if you dare.

Compared to the previous collections, this volume seems a little more on topic because of the scary themes involved, so it's pretty cool.  And creepy.  And see if you can find any other scary themes in new episodes of ""Regular Show"" on Cartoon Network and kaboom! comics.",1380499200,5,1697,4.623333333333333
5777096,5,B00D7NRP8W,ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!!!! ITS LIKE ABSOLUTELY THE BEST SHOW IN THE WHOLE WORLD AND I LOVE JG QUINTEL SOOOOO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:),1378425600,2,132,5.65
5777097,5,B00D7NRP8W,"This was my family's first time watching the cartoon series Regular Show.  Rigby the Hyperactive raccoon and Mordecai a six-foot tall blue jay, are grounds keepers at a park and find their jobs incredibly dull.  They'll often make up games like roadkill bingo to make it fun or avoid their work altogether. Since this is a Halloween themed collection, there are many scary stories shared like the one about a possessed ventriloquist doll that desires to draw on it's owner's face.  My kids were more entertained than scared so I didn't have to worry about them getting nightmares or anything.  My kids now walk around jinxing themselves, fortunately without actually punching each other when they speak.  Like many cartoons there is violence and since this is a fright pack, references to zombies and the undead are plentiful.  When it comes to language there is one instance of ""friggin"" and one of the characters says ""What the H!"" without completing the word. Overall my family enjoyed this 176 minute bundle.  While the retail price is $19.82 I have seen it selling for $11 or less.",1377302400,4,1086,4.869565217391305

5777102,5,B00D7NRP8W,"While my family and I are very hesitant in buying any composition of ""random"" episodes, on DVD or VHS, we could not resist this ""holiday/scare"" packaging of one of our favorite shows. While one can find most of these episodes on other collections or even on streaming services, it is always cool to have the ""scary shows"" on one disc. I have had Halloween Marathons for years and years. This makes it a little easier.",1385942400,,417,4.573333333333333
5777103,5,B00D7NRP8W,"I love regular show and some reviewers maybe right about going too far with so many little dvds when there are seasons but hey I love the halloween one.  Its all halloween type shows so instead of looking thru my seasons for one specific Halloween episode they are all conveniently in this one dvd, and also when u think about it these are cheaper than a boxed season so for a quick gift for a regular show fan or for someone who may not of heard of it and u feel its something to give to get them hooked.  I feel the company does this for people who don't or cant spend $20 to $30 on a season set but would rather pay $7 to $10 on a dvd mix
If you think about it if this company was really money hungry you would see a whole lot of regular memorabilia that is crap or useless like a deck of cards, napkin dispenser, bottle opener, tissue box then that would be selling out,
my opinion anyway, I think they are doing great with what they dispense as far as memorabilia",1385164800,4,968,4.089473684210526

5777105,4,B00D7NRP8W,"Regular Show is the best adult/kid cartoon of them all- a blending of Rocky &Bullwinkle, Seinfield and 3 Stooges. The older shows like these are wittier than the ones coming out now, although with weaker graphics. I'd rather watch this than anything else on network TV. As Mordecai and Rigby would say-Hmmpf.
