1843201,5,B00008G6JZ,this is a movie for all animal lovers everywhere. We love bart the bear and his owners .The only con to this film is brad pitt he seems so artificial and he does not have the right to be in this film. We highly hope you love this as much as we do.,1317427200,,247,3.6792452830188678
1843202,5,B00008G6JZ,I am so impressed by the stature of Bart--plus the personality of these animals demands that mankind consider the soul of people and animals before causing harm.,1293753600,,161,5.0
1843203,5,B00008G6JZ,"Doug Seuss' performance as a bear trainer is incredible!  He's able to make himself the two-legged equivalent of a grizzly while participating in their never-ending rough-and-tumble play and maintaining control.  The death of Bart is a sad moment; fortunately the Seuss' also obtain two new grizzly cubs at about the same time, and this video documents their growing up and learning to be movie actors.  A side impact is that it destroys any belief that grizzlies are uncaring, unthinking and beastly.

Brad Pitt's narration was also impressive - not some dry, condescending reading, but that of a person who is also quite impressed with the Seuss's and their bears.",1214784000,,666,5.08256880733945

1843205,5,B00008G6JZ,This is by far one of the most incredible wildlife films I have ever seen (and I have seen alot).  It has forever changed the way I see these amazing animals.  I have seen it several times and it never ceases to touch my very soul.  A must see for all ages!,1165536000,4,257,3.9038461538461537
1843206,5,B00008G6JZ,"Although short, 47 minutes, Growing Up Grizzly is packed with scenes showing Doug and Lynne Seus working and playing with their grizzlies, Bart, Little Bart, Honey-Bump, and Tank. Little Bart and Honey-Bump's first year of life, which even includes home movies of the Alaska state trouper who first adopted the two tiny orphans, is the spotlight of this film, but ample space is given to Bart the Bear (of movie fame, and who died during filming) and Tank, grizzly star of Doctor Dolittle 2. For better or for worse, Brad Pitt's narration and cameo appearance are minimal.

If you are fascinated by wild animals and their interactions with humans you will be amazed with shots of Doug playing around with his head in Bart Senior's mouth, rehearsal and training of the charismatic Tank for his role in Dr Dolittle 2, the orphans first trip to town and ice cream cones, and the whole family's voyage to Hollywood where you see bears and humans interacting on the set and in the studio lot. Doug and Lynne bring you into their home and life-long love of animals with memories and photos of their first animals and small children, interviews and shots with their daughter Sausha working with the little cubs, and their family's establishment of Vital Ground, a foundation that acquires private land to protect America's wilderness and wildlife. You come to understand that Bart, Tank, and the cubs are truly a part of the Seus family and Bart's death causes as much grief as a human child's would. But mostly, Little Bart and Bump steal the show with their youthful rough housing, their day-to-day transformation from lap size teddy bears to formidable adolescent bears, and their discovery of man's world and that movie sets do come apart. An inspiring film for any animal lover.

More information on the Seus's foundation, Vital Ground, can be found at vitalground.org.",1116460800,8,1867,4.905063291139241

7982605,5,B00008G6JZ,There was so much love and such a deep emotional bond between Doug Seus and Bart the bear that you will be forever touched by this documentary. I'm so happy I was able to experience a little piece of the Seus family and their incredible world!,1484092800,,243,4.304347826086956
7982606,5,B00008G6JZ,Doug Sues is unbelievable. This documentary is awesome. I only live an hour away from him and had no idea about his life with Bart.,1469750400,,131,4.28
7982607,5,B00008G6JZ,"These CD's ... Growing Up Grizzly 1 & 2 need to be republished.  They are the best wildlife programs I've ever seen.  I very much appreciate the work the Seus family has done to show how humans and grizzly bears can have a relationship.  Doug Seus states that he doesn't want a trained grizzly bear... but that he wants a relationship with a grizzly bear.  I have been a huge fan of the Seus family and the love and respect they have for all their animals. Their love for the grizzly bears has also been expressed by the establishment of the Vital Ground Foundation.  This is an organization that acquires private lands to protect America's wildlife, and they work with private landowners to conserve wildlife habitat for grizzly bears and other wildlife.  Lynn Seus sums it up perfectly ... ""Where the grizzly can walk, the earth is healthy and whole"" ... explaining that the grizzly bear is an umbrella species.  So that where a grizzly bear can live and thrive... then all the other animals can live and thrive.  This CD shows the love that can exist between humans and animals.  This will not come as a surprise to people who have animals in their lives and know the joys of a loving relationship with an animal.  Unfortunately there are too many people that don't open their hearts to an animal and will never know that kind of love.  This CD gives shows how Doug Seus and his family raise their beloved grizzly bears (Bart I, Tank, Little Bart and Honey Bump) as well as giving a glimpse of just how painful it is to lose one to cancer.  If you follow the Seus family you will know that they never forget that grizzly bears are wild animals.  They are the first to state it is better for the grizzly bear to live wild.  Their bears however come from sources where it is impossible to release them into the wild.  It is wonderful to see how Doug Seus raises his grizzly bears.  If you are lucky enough to get a copy of Growing Up Grizzly 1 or 2 then don't hesitate.  It is one purchase you'll be lucky to get... and a CD you will never want to get rid of.",1446508800,,2060,4.364829396325459
7982608,5,B00008G6JZ,"I'm a fan of bears and have studied them for years due to the fact that I love to play in their land.  Just truly enjoyed learning about Bart's Story as well as his keepers and the other bears in the family.  Excellent show for those that enjoy learning about the big bruins.  Also very interesting to see how bears are trained and the enormous devotion given to the training of these animals by the trainers.  Truly beautiful people that have also made it a point to make a difference in helping to preserve Grizzly and Brown Bear habitat.  I would love to get my hands on the 2nd show, but haven't had luck getting that one.",1410566400,,626,4.316239316239316
7982609,5,B00008G6JZ,Gives an up-close view of what love & dedication can do for the animals in our care. Doug Seuss is a unique human being we should all envy.,1379894400,,139,4.0
7982610,5,B00008G6JZ,I have looked for this for years!!!  Saw it when it was originally aired on Animal Planet and looked for it forever as I was soooo touched with the bond they have with that incredible Bart the Kodiak bear.  I just love bears and love these people!  Sooo thrilled to have found it!  :),1370649600,,284,4.203703703703703
7982611,5,B00008G6JZ,"I was really excited to find it at an amazing price, i have been searching for this DVD and the only ones that i found were almost $100. I actually contacted Vital Ground and they said they did not own it so they did not have any DVD's, then i contacted Animal Planet and they said they did not have any DVD's either. its not a very long show but it is a classic in our house, we also got the 2nd DVD with Brad Pitts wife (at the time) Jennifer Aniston, Growing up Grizzly 2 (from Vital Ground).  The Seus's are amazing people and should be commended for all that they do. I actually used some of their training tips to train my pit bull and he is as loving and trusting as a bunny.  Doug Seus was right when he said ""when you stare into an animals eyes, you are staring into their soul'",1354838400,,787,4.038461538461538
7982612,5,B00008G6JZ,I love this story. I have watched about 10 times over the years. A great story. I now follow Doug Seus and the bears in the movies.,1331424000,,131,3.888888888888889
