6582986,5,B00MIA0M5I,"I bought the Bruce Lee collection from Amazon on DVD a few years ago that looks like a bookcase with 5 DVD's , pamphlet , details and probably a rare item and all I was interested is Bruce Lee on Blu Ray for a superior picture and sound , This Blu Ray comes with 4 movies : The Big Boss - 1971 with a pretty good picture transfer and not a bad sounding movie : B. Lee's first film  who moves to Thailand with his uncle and gets him a job in an ice factory but once a block of ice falls to the ground and shatters drugs are found inside seen by a couple of B. Lee's family members who end up going missing and after an employee strike more people end up dead including some of B. Lee's family members and when B.Lee realizes the factory is just a front for a major drug trafficker he takes out the drug lord and his gang with good action fighting stunts , picture , sound and special features , Approx. 1,40.14 - R .

Fist of Fury - 1972 Would have to be one of my favourite and better than the Big Boss :  B. Lee returns to his old  martial arts school to be married only to find out his old master has died of a mysteriously illness , At his funeral a rival Japanese martial arts school shows up at the mourning and begin mocking Lee and everyone there and this does not go down well with B. Lee so he goes to the Japanese martial arts school and kicks everyone's ass with some of the best martial arts fighting I've seen and  than the Japanese master wants B. Lee out of the way and when B. Lee finds out that his master was poison by the Japanese school he takes revenge by kicking everyone's ass at the Japanese school leaving a path of blood  with some of the best martial arts fighting on film with a pretty good transfer picture , sound and special features , this is the movie that made B. Lee a superstar , Approx. 1,46.42 - R .

The Way of the Dragon - 1972 B. Lee  Produced , Directed  , Wrote and Stars in this film with Chuck Norris , The story about a man who travels to Rome to help his uncle and niece with their restaurant  because is being targeted by a local mafia being bullied into paying protection money and the rights to the restaurant so B. Lee befriends everyone there and teaches them martial arts and beats up some of the local mafia hoods so the mafia boss sends his man to kill B. Lee but he kicks their asses a few times over till the mafia boss sends three deadly martial arts experts in different styles to kill B. Lee with some excellent martial arts fighting especially on the last fight between B. Lee and Chuck Norris , this is another great Transfer with a pretty good picture , sound and especial features , Approx. 1,39.12 - R .

Game of Death - 1978 : I agree with some critics that this film shouldn't have been made because they use what little footage they had of B. Lee with some close up shots of The Way of the Dragon and another look a like actor playing the part of B. Lee , The story about an actor who is being bullied for protection money by a crime syndicate and is shot on the face , survives and after plastic surgery comes back to take out the syndicate and his hoods with only three original B. Lee Martial art fighting sequences , one against another martial artist with sticks & non chucks & another against a martial artist in a white karate uniform with a gold belt and the best part of the film against 7ft 2 inches basketball player Kareem Abdul Jabbar with an ok transfer & special features , Approx. 1,40.50 - R .

The only movie missing is Enter The Dragon just to make this Blu Ray collection perfect , I have Enter The Dragon on HD DVD and Blu Ray so I was only interested in the Blu Ray picture and sound of The Big Boss - Fist of Fury and The Way of the Dragon so for those 3 movies rate this Blu Ray collection 4 & half as for  Game of Death : Two & half , All up rate this R rated Collection a Five , running time approx. 405 minutes , 1080 P - HD - Widescreen - English Dubbed - Mandarin with English Subtitles - DTS , HD - MA and for those of you who maybe interested this collection is A region locked for North , Central and South America only .",1422921600,18,4121,4.047911547911548

6582988,5,B00MIA0M5I,exactly what I wanted in a Bruce Lee Blu-Ray set,1420243200,,48,3.9
6582989,4,B00MIA0M5I,A great collection but,1417651200,2,22,4.75
6582990,5,B00MIA0M5I,"This set is pretty much just the 4 main blu-ray discs from the Bruce Lee Legacy Collection packaged into a standard 4-disc blu-ray case. You don't get the fancy book-style packaging, the 4 (redundant) dvds of the 4 movies, or the 3 bonus dvds (""Bruce Lee: The Legend""/""Bruce Lee: The Man, The Legend"", ""I Am Bruce Lee"", and the exclusive Legacy Collection bonus disc).

For me this is not an issue as I already have the UK Hong Kong Legends dvd of ""Bruce Lee: The Legend""/""Bruce Lee: The Man, The Legend"" (with more extra features). You can get ""I Am Bruce Lee"" separately on blu-ray. The last bonus disc on the Legacy Collection is exclusive to that set, but some of the extras (""Legacy of the Dragon"" and ""Fist of Fury Interviews"") are already on the UK Hong Kong Legends/Cine Asia 2-disc version dvds of ""Fist of Fury"" and ""Game of Death"", which I also already have.

Bestbuy's website currently has this set for $14.99 so that's why I got this instead of Legacy Collection.

I can confirm that this set doesn't have the problems that were found on Legacy Collection, so the transfers are HD and ""Fist of Fury"" does have the Mandarin mono track.

This is a very good set with full-HD picture, a staggering amount of audio options (the most I've ever seen for these films on any dvd/blu-ray) and lots of good extras like:

-the rare unused alternate English dub for ""The Big Boss""
-the English dub for the Japanese version of ""Way of the Dragon"" with Bruce's real war cries and extra music
-the English dub for the Japanese version of ""Game of Death"" with Bruce's real war cries
-the full-HD Japanese version of ""Game of Death""
-""Game of Death Revisited"" which is a 40-minute edit of the pagoda scenes from the unfinished original 1972 version of ""The Game of Death"". This was originally part of the film ""Bruce Lee in G.O.D. Shibotekiyugi"" only released in Japan, and later included in the UK Hong Kong Legends/Cine Asia 2-disc dvd versions of ""Game of Death"" as a bonus feature. However, it is anamorphic widescreen on this set (where it was windowboxed on the UK dvds). ""Game of Death Revisited"" is similar to the pagoda scenes in ""Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey"" but the picture here is cleaned up, the missing audio is reinserted, different dubbing (Bey Logan dubs Bruce), different music and they used slightly different sequences.

The only thing I don't like is the blu-ray case they packaged it in. They used the type of case where each hub holds 2 discs stacked on top of each other, so you have to take out the disc on top to get the one on the bottom. I might switch out the case with one that has separate hubs on swing trays.

6582991,3,B00MIA0M5I,"I give it 3 stars only because this compilation has been released already in so many versions. The other reviewer complaining of not having Chinese soundtrack for Bruce's voice, well don't worry, you might as well watch it in English because Bruce's voice is dubbed in the Mandarin and Cantonese versions anyway. Chinese films in those days were shot silent and the voices were dubbed in afterward. In the Chinese(I think the Cantonese dub) version of Fist of Fury, Bruce's voice was used to dub over Robert Baker's one line in the movie ""I'll take care of him"". That's the only time in these 4 films that you'll hear Bruce's real voice. For Bruce Lee's real voice, watch Enter the Dragon(English version) and the extented footage of Game of Death in the documentary ""A Warrior's Journey"".",1413072000,35,789,4.8088235294117645
6582992,2,B00MIA0M5I,"I am really disappointed that the discs do not include the original Cantonese sound track even though the Blu-ray disc should have sufficient capacity. I hope I can collect the ""complete"" Bruce Lee collection including his original voice.",1411171200,10,238,5.2894736842105265
6582993,5,B00MIA0M5I,"This isn't really a review, but as I found the product description sorely lacking, I decided to compile this list of product information for the benefit of prospective buyers. I hope you find this information useful.

THE BIG BOSS (1971) - 99 minutes - Director: Wei Lo - Starring: Bruce Lee, Maria Yi - Genre: Action, Kung Fu - Plot: A young man sworn to an oath of non-violence works with his cousins in an ice factory where they mysteriously begin to disappear. R

FIST OF FURY (aka THE CHINESE CONNECTION) (1972) - 107 minutes - Director: Wei Lo - Starring: Bruce Lee, Nora Miao - Genre: Action/Kung Fu - Plot: A young man seeks vengence for the death of his teacher. R

THE WAY OF THE DRAGON (1972) - 90 minutes - Director: Bruce Lee - Starring: Bruce Lee, Chuck Norris - Genre: Action/Kung Fu - Plot: A man visits his relatives at their restaurant in Italy and has to help them defend against brutal gangsters harassing them. R

Now lets crunch some numbers. This box set costs $41.98, and contains 4 films. When we divide to find the price of each individual film, we get a price of $10.50 per film.

6583021,5,B00MIA0M5I,"Huge fan of Bruce Lee, so great for me!

About the product, you get 4 DVDs, you can fast forward by Chapter in each movie, it's really convenient if you have already seen them many times.  The quality of the BluRay is really good considering how old these movies are.  Also, I was initially really disappointed when I heard different voices from the ""originals"" which I remembered in Way of the Dragon, but then I noticed you can change the voice settings and I found the ""correct English"" that I was used to, so that I can hear the thugs talk the way I remember.

6583023,5,B00MIA0M5I,"Awesome!!!  I bought this primarily for Way of the Dragon (also known as Return of the Dragon) and I was BLOWN AWAY.  Having endlessly watched the dubbed and heavily edited version in the U.S. on cable and VHS (including a version that had even its very mild profanity blanked out), I was not at all prepared for how great the transfer was going to look and especially how much extra footage there is.  So many slightly cryptic scenes are now explained!  And so much more goofy humor!  I must mention, that hot Italian lady that puts her arm around Bruce - well there's more footage with her and it includes nudity (did I mention she was hot?)... so that was an extremely welcome surprise!  But just being able to see the entire frame of what they filmed instead of various reformatted aspect ratios (even compared to the DVD), so many little details are now there for you to see and more fully understand the drama of the particular scene.  And the color, particularly the REDS, just such vivid and wonderful REDS!  Lots more little shots around Rome, too, which I greatly appreciated now that I've actually been there.

As for the audio - I can happily say there are EIGHT tracks, four in Chinese and another four in English (one of which is full dts HD multi-channel glorious sound where you can hear every detail of background noise, traffic, etc yet crystal clear dialog... but occasionally some of the additional sound effects during fight scenes are a bit weird; the eighth is a commentary track).

There are also captions in English if you want those, but I know every word of the dubbed English dialog (I fell in love with its goofy charm long ago) and there are some subtle differences in translation that are interesting, but also a bit distracting sometimes, just for me anyway.  Still, I think every Blu-ray should have them.

Goes without saying that I am VERY pleased!!!  I can't wait to check out the other 3 discs (yes, they did cram all four into a normal-sized case, it has double spindles so two discs can stack on each side).",1485216000,2,2046,4.587912087912088

This is not the movie I saw in theatres back when it first came out. Bruce Lee had died before the film's completion so there was another person who did a few scenes at the end. The movie was still 80-90% Bruce Lee, This version has someone else throughout most of the movie, is a completely different story and movie, and only seems to splice in a few of Bruce Lee's original scenes. Thumbs down on this presentation of what had still been a great movie originally. The other movies are great, even though re-named.",1472256000,4,653,4.352459016393443

6583066,5,B00MIA0M5I,"What we have here are the four famous movies starring Lee under the Golden Harvest umbrella (""Enter The Dragon"" is not in this package, because it was a joint production between Warner Bros / Golden Harvest).

The four movies are:

a. The Big Boss (shot in Thailand),
b. Fist of Fury (my favorite),
c. The Way of the Dragon (shot in Rome, directed and scripted by Lee)
d. and the phony ""Game of Death' (released in 1978, five years after Bruce's death).

The first three movies are classic even nowadays and, in my opinion, they aged gracefully, and no doubt the viewing experience is enhanced due to the superb transfer quality to Blu-Ray.

The movies have English and Chinese audio, and English subtitles, besides some good extras.

6583072,5,B00MIA0M5I,A must for Bruce Lee fans - and to-be Bruce Lee fans like my kids. Great quality and basic features. Only wish Bruce could have been recorded in full HD back in his time. Try and slow-mo one of his fight scenes (which in cases are already slowed down) and you'll understand my desire even more. :-),1432339200,3,298,4.245614035087719

6583074,5,B00MIA0M5I,"This is an excellent collection for Bruce Lee fans.  Bruce Lee made 5 movies (well technically 4 1/2) and these are excellent copies of all except for Enter The Dragon (not included).  If you want all Bruce Lee movies, I'd recommend buying this set and the Enter The Dragon Blu Ray separately and you'll have everything.  I really like being able to watch in the original language with subtitles and having the movies altogether here.  I wasn't crazy about the packaging.  There are 2 discs on each side of the case (one disc on top of the other), which may eventually cause scratches, but so far so good.  Also, the case itself doesn't close anymore.  I'm not sure if something broke off, but it happened the minute after I opened it.  There are also very nice additional features that come on each disc, but I haven't watched all of them yet so I can't really rate them.  Bruce was the greatest martial artist who ever lived - you can't go wrong with this set!",1429920000,3,962,4.482758620689655
6583075,4,B00MIA0M5I,"Excellent transfer to Blu ray & I also prefer the Mandarin language version - more elegant than the rustic original Cantonese. Sound quality is also greatly enhanced when played on a home theatre system.  I've had repeat viewings (as have many fans) over the years but this transfer has allowed me to pick up little things & notice colour palates not remembered - part of the Blu ray experience - it's a wonderful collection.  I won't review the movies because that's pointless, nobody watches these movies for anything other than their visceral content. For under $30 & 4 movies plus features this is a MUST have for a Bruce Lee or any Kung Fu genre fan.",1429833600,,655,4.637931034482759

6583082,2,B00MIA0M5I,"I'm wondering why no one has mentioned the new sound effects during fight scenes?  If you're a true fan of Bruce Lee's movies, you'll notice right away that during fight scenes, they have changed the sound effects, and often Bruce Lee's voice as well. The sounds coming from Bruce in these films were as much a part of the magic as the images! If you're a fan like me, you know every sound and detail from years of enjoying Bruce Lee's movies. If you're a fan like me, watching these versions will leave you feeling let down. The picture is fantastic!  But without the original sounds during the action scenes, its disappointing. I have only watched ""The Way of The Dragon"" and ""Game of Death"", but I'm sure the other movies in this collection have the same changes as well.  I hope I'm wrong.",1428019200,10,793,4.493055555555555

Compression problems during an airport scene in Way of the Dragon. Picture becomes a blurry mess.

6583091,5,B00MIA0M5I,"Blu-ray format - The Bruce Lee Premiere Collection is a super deal at the $15.00 price I paid for it.  It was his four main movies put out by Golden Harvest films on blu-ray, The Big Boss, Fist of Fury, The Game of Death and The Return of the Dragon.  Enter the Dragon is not included, because it was a Warner Bros. release.  I own the DVD box set and let's just say this Blu-ray version is better quality sound and picture for much less than I got the DVD's for.  A must have for Bruce Lee fans.

Please see other people's reviews for what each disc has of doesn't have, but let's say there are many language options including English, Cantonese and Mandarin = dogs.",1426809600,4,667,4.261904761904762

Much better picture quality than my old DVDs. I also like watching these films in the original Chinese Mandarin language soundtrack and English subtitles... rather than dubbed English.

This is how Bruce Lee films were supposed to be experienced. A must have for Bruce Lee fans.",1426636800,4,452,4.782051282051282
6583093,4,B00MIA0M5I,"great 4 movies on 4 discs.  Excellent video quality as expected for Blu-ray and Shout! Factory.
My only one and really one BIG complaint:  why the crappy plastic case?  Each inner side of the case has a central hub with multiple snapper-type spokes.  Each hub holds TWO discs 1 lying on top of the other.  Wouldn't that scratch the top disc?  I think this case was intended to hold 2 discs maybe, but NOT FOUR.  Both of my hubs had multiple spokes broken off during shipment so now I have to go and buy a replacement case.  Shout! Factory needs to choose better cases for their quality discs.  Definitely has room for improvement here.",1425686400,2,635,4.5

The Fox Home Video DVD is better.  The biggest issue I had was the audio soundtrack.  The opening queue for the movie was cut and the soundtrack tempo has been sped up.  Granted this is not the best ""Bruce Lee"" movie, but what made it good ... for me anyway ... was the John Barry score.  With both the video and audio issues, I saw no reason to keep these versions of the films.  I'll stick to the DVD versions until someone does decent Blu-ray releases.",1424131200,3,625,4.460176991150442

All of these movies allow you to choose language and subtitles. The video and audio quality are not as good as you get with modern movies, but I really can't expect much better for films that were from the early 70's.",1503964800,2,529,4.343434343434343
