5957556,5,B00EZ227DW,"Not quite your run of the mill perverted harem anime. With out spoiling anything you'll go from watching it for the ""plot"" to watching it for the plot. If you catch my drift.",1453593600,3,174,4.303030303030303

5957563,5,B00EZ227DW,"This is a great show with 12 episodes in total. Not going to spoil the plot since its been said over and over. This show is in Japanese with English sub so reading is required. Good animation, good soundtrack, great Japanese voice cast and good fan-service as an added bonus. Enjoy",1438646400,,281,4.529411764705882
5957564,2,B00EZ227DW,"What started off as a decent ecchi/action anime quietly turned into a fairly lackluster snoozefest with an extremely boring ending. If you like anime like High School DxD, you'll probably be directed to watch this. The beginning starts it off on the right foot, and the ecchi portions, while totally in your face almost all the time, are used more in line with the fighting and the action, as opposed to the outright major side-note it is in other anime like High School DxD. I felt like it was used as a sorta plot device, (almost punishing those who were losing the fights), than it was just an outright ecchi-fest. However that part is quickly lost on the characters themselves and just the generally dull story, especially the ending where almost everything is thrown out the window to end on an extremely boring note. It should be noted that I didn't have high expectations for this show in the first place and I certainly won't be revisiting it in the future. This kinda felt like a wasted opportunity to do something extremely entertaining and fun.",1436659200,4,1055,4.708108108108108

5957570,5,B00EZ227DW,"I enjoyed it, and will defiantly watch again. Now, that being said, this anime was nothing special, you could basically predict where the story line was going. Still enjoyed it though.",1422057600,,184,4.967741935483871

5957572,5,B00EZ227DW,"Call me crazy, but I love pervy main characters in an anime. His local thoughts really made me laugh as he justified his actions. Still, the storyline was interesting and I enjoyed the episodes. It was the typical harem setting, but I like how the main characters connected. I hope it makes a season 2 because I can't wait to see what happens next.",1412208000,,348,4.453125

5957576,5,B00EZ227DW,at first when i bought this one i was disappointed because it wasn't in english like i thought but that was on me i didn't read to see if it was dubed anyway after watching a few episodes i got into it i had never seen this anime before was just going off what i have heard and wanted a new one to watch but again like most animes its flashy but look past that (unless thats the only reason you watch them) and it has a pretty good story to it! i would recommend,1404864000,,462,3.873684210526316

5957579,4,B00EZ227DW,Watch this series. I highly recommend to anyone who like a series with plenty of fan service. It has a fair amount of action as well.,1395792000,2,133,4.153846153846154
5957580,3,B00EZ227DW,It is a typical Japanese anime except for the very annoying ink blots that are used for situation changes. Those blots block out scenes that would be more interesting if we could see them. Other wise it's pretty boring and predictable. Not one of my favorites.,1395705600,,260,4.673913043478261

5957585,5,B00EZ227DW,"Ryoske is your typical teenaged boy, he has dreams and also the more than normal hormonally driven desires.  HIs mother works overseas and his father has died so he is on his own.  But on a rainy day he sees a pretty red head standing outside his house, he offers her shelter and to get warm, where she stabs him with a broken sword.  However this fiery redhead is more than she appears, she is a Grim Reaper and she is on the hunt for a powerful soul to help her in a mission to save both her world and the mortal realm and she takes our hapless prevert to be her contractor while on our side of the gate.  However when they are attacked by an unusual monster she learns that there is more to this young man than meets the eye, and maybe he can be the answer she is looking for.

This is a cross of High School DXD and Sekerei.  Despite his nature, like in HSDXD, our hero does have a good side and is willing to not only help out, but also shows that he cares for not only Lirissa, but the other girls as well - to the point of taking hits on their behalf.  The show is still full of panty shots, chest flashes, bath scenes, and other things that an ecchi action comedy is full of, but it does have a good story, enjoyable characters, and that feeling that despite everything a little romance.  A good series to watch and one that also deserves a new season (becuase you know there will always be new bad guys to fight).",1390348800,36,1422,4.108303249097473
5957586,4,B00EZ227DW,"It's a ""fanservice"" Ecchi anime, with lots gratuitous and unneeded upskirt pantie and boob shots. These add little to the show except eye candy. In High School DXD these added humor (sometimes clever, often slapstick) - here it's mostly during battle scenes and changing outfits. Think ""Sekirei"".

Overall the series IS entertaining for Ecchi fans, the animation is good and the plot, while not unique, is enjoyable.  It's not Harem, and it is supernatural.",1385078400,44,457,5.162162162162162
5957587,4,B00EZ227DW,"This is my favorite anime and I would purchase it right now if it were only dubbed in english.

5957590,5,B00EZ227DW,"Finally this day has come... epic series coming in a BD release, just I was expecting. Fanservice, ecchi, harem with a little bit of romance and a well developed plot. Character design, and everything you have imagine.",1378598400,11,218,4.918918918918919
8610486,3,B00EZ227DW,"Bought on a whim from a recommendation. The story is good but the obvious fanservice is distracting. I just feel as though they weren't trying very hard and the plot is just a vessel for their perversion. Don't get me wrong, fanservice can be enjoyable if done correctly. Prison School is among my favorite anime, albeit not for the fanservice.",1531872000,,344,4.75
8610487,4,B00EZ227DW,"Decent story line, didn't like that there was no English audio.
A fair amount of fan service in this so if cartoon nudity bothers you this is not for you.
overview in description is accurate so not going to reiterate the details of the series.
This story line somewhat reminds me of the High school DXD however the main male character is less nave.
That said I enjoyed watching this and would recommend it however as stated earlier I wish it would have had English dub.",1522108800,,469,4.465116279069767

8610490,3,B00EZ227DW,"The stock description is woefully inaccurate. The male lead Ryosuke makes a pact with Lisara. But she's not a goddess or demon, but a grim reaper. From a parallel world inhabited by reapers. The description makes it sound like he would lose his pervy-ness, be surrounded by a hot harem that he's unable to perceive as attractive, but aware that he should be turned on ... thus hilarity ensuing.

That is NOT what happens.
Ryosuke doesn't lose his lasciviousness. Lisara drains his energy to power up for battle. He just gets tired and spent (like he just ran a sexual marathon) until he can recover by either sleeping or getting aroused again. He's a horny teenager though, so that doesn't take long at all. And then she can power up for battle again.

It plays out like a tamer version of High School DxD, but with a more drawn out parallel world subplot halfway through. It also suffers by leaving several dangling plot-threads and unanswered questions by the end.  If this is a genre you like, I'd recommended watching a better series such as High School DxD or Heaven's Lost Property instead.",1498694400,5,1096,4.697916666666667
