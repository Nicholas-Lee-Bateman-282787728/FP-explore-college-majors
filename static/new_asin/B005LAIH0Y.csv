4723160,2,B005LAIH0Y,"Paranormal Activity seems to have started this trend of recent horror movies done with footage from home movies or mockumentaries.  Paranormal Activity, however, got it right for at least a couple of their movies.  The Devil Inside got it all wrong.  If you've seen the theatrical trailers, you've seen the best parts of this movie. While the filming is intentionally choppy, the plot is even more full of gaps.  The basic idea is that a young woman has gone to an insane asylum in Italy to try and see her mother who was committed years ago after she murdered 3 church officials during an exorcism.  The young woman is befriended by two young priests who are rogue exorcists - they perform exorcisms which the church does not sanction.  You can pretty much fill in the blanks for the rest.  There is really only one affecting scene in the entire movie which is when the two young priests are attempting an exorcism on a young Italian woman who is tied to a metal frame bed in her family's basement.  It has a true horror which the rest of the movie lacks.  The final insult for this film is the ending which I won't spoil in case you do decide to see this movie.  But let's just say that it makes no sense in relation to the rest of the plot.  I'd say you'd do best to skip this one unless it shows up as an option on Netflix and you are really bored.",1326240000,5,1352,4.325396825396825
4723161,5,B005LAIH0Y,"The film is about Isabella Rossi. She is the daughter of Maria Rossi, a woman who killed three people while they were performing an exorcism on her.
To know the truth about her mother, Isabella and her cameraman, Michael, start doing a documentary about exorcisms with the help of Ben and David, two priests that perform exorcisms on people that need it without the churche's permission.
The film itself is very creeeeeeepy, especially Rosa'a exorcism, it was scary and bloody in some parts.
Regardless of the ending, in the car crash, it's fantastic, and it really fits the movie, because at the beginning, in the exorcism class, they mentioned that in the case of multiple demonic possesion, the demons can jump through person to person. The idea of putting a link at the end of the film wasn't that neccesary, but it makes you feel the movie was real, which is very good.
So overral, the film will ""be home of moments that will shake, scare and disturb you"", until the very ending.
Recommended.",1326240000,3,997,4.735632183908046
4723162,1,B005LAIH0Y,"My honest opinion of this movie is that t is just completely horrible. The movie had so much potential and had such a big following from just the trailer and of course when a trailer is that good there is always a little let down, but i don't think anyone expected for a let down like this. The movie is seriously set up like a show on national geographic exploring the art of exorcism and getting your first period, it captures that part perfectly, and it is just so boring. Yes exorcism movies typically have a lot of talking and stuff like that but this was unbearable, all it was, was talking and trying to be scary, which at some points was actually pretty funny. There was like 5 times during the whole movie that i jumped, the rest i sat there in my seat struggling to stay awake and to not yawn so loud. The camera was very shaky and i had a hard time seeing certain things or concentrating on certain things during the movie cause it was shaky or moving too much. And the ending, made the whole movie a horrible waste of time. the worst ending i have ever seen next to the ending of The Mist. If you like those dumb scary movies then this is the perfect movie for you! but this movie lives up to no expectations to any horror fans, i expected something way better from such a good trailer.",1325894400,18,1298,4.237903225806452
4723163,1,B005LAIH0Y,"Initially, from watching previews and hearing the buzz about ""The Devil Inside,"" the film appeared to put a twist on the exorcism film genre, and that would have been a good thing, because these types of films have been done to death in recent years. But as it turns out, the film stumbles out of the gate, and just when it finally gets going, it abruptly comes to one of the worst endings in recent memory.

The plot is a familiar one; a young girl becomes interested in having an exorcism performed on her mother, who has been locked away in an institution for two decades. She inlists the help of a few clergymen, who of course go against the wishes of the church to help a total stranger. Not surprisingly, the woman is in fact occupied by evil spirits, and when the priests and camera/film crew (sound familiar?) attempt to film the exorcism, things go terribly wrong.

The camera angles attempt to add suspense and intrigue to the film, but just end up giving the viewer a headache. The best ""action"" scenes in the film are filmed in such poor lighting and so cluttered that it is impossible to tell what is going on. The acting is an absolute abomination, as the cast fails to scare the audience or to emote in any way to the tragic and shocking events that are taking place.

The horror film genre has had two awful years in a row now, with ""Insidious"" being the only half-decent attempt at modern horror in that span. If ""The Last Exorcism"" was a lame attempt to combine ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" with ""Paranormal Activity,"" then this film is a muddled, half-hearted attempt to cash in on that concept yet again. What do they usually say about horror films that are not released during, or at least close to October? They say that the film never should have made it out of the cutting room to begin with. I was nearly ""possessed"" to walk out of this film, but it ended before I had the chance.",1325894400,5,1905,4.437142857142857
4723283,5,B005LAIH0Y,"I am a real fan of great quality independent, foreign,  sundance, documentaries, and horror films.  I am hard to please because I feel that most horror movies today are pretty awful,  using more sex, blood and predictable naked stupid women to draw 13 year olds.  This was an excellent movie.  Kept my attention from beginning to end and the acting was exceptional. Really scary freaky exorcism scenes!!  A person who likes quality would love this film, but I think a lot of maybe men who were expecting the usual boobs and blood, even in an exorcism movie, would hate this film and call it boring.",1522195200,,598,4.647619047619048

4723994,4,B005LAIH0Y,"I gave this movie 4 stars because for this type of movie, I thought it was quite good. Shot as a mockumentary, it will appeal to those who enjoy the type of raw stabilized camera work used in Paranormal Activity and Cloverfield. As far as the concept goes, it focuses more on the Holy See/Catholic Church and ordained exorcist branch of things rather than the more typically explored run of the mill ""random girl becomes possessed"" movie. The plot line is underdeveloped, but this is to be expected in the fake documentary horror genre. Documentaries themselves don't really have plot lines, they just follow people around looking for information and asking questions, so to complain about the plot line I feel is just silly and nonsensical. The best way you can figure out if you would like this movie is to compare it to other movies in this context as follows:
1. The Devil Inside: Fake documentary with a focus on the Catholic Church and an ending that will leave you with more questions than answers
2. The Last Exorcism: Fake Documentary with a focus on those crazy southerners and an ending that will leave you laughing angrily at it's ridiculousness and the fact that you wasted precious time of your life watching it. Precious time that you will never get back.
3. The Possessed: Mainstream movie with a developed plot line and a focus more so on Judaism and a cameo by Matisyahu

Overall, if you like this type of movie you will enjoy this movie.",1399075200,,1456,4.665369649805448
4723995,1,B005LAIH0Y,Not what i expected in a possessed demon devil movie.. This movie should have been cultivated more for the hardcore horror fanatics.. It was lame modern day horror with no thrills whatsoever..,1398902400,2,192,5.03125
4723996,5,B005LAIH0Y,I have not watched it yet because the cover is too scary and evil looking. This movie is still in the packaging and faced down on my video shelf with a sticker detailing what movie this is......sad huh,1398556800,,201,4.315789473684211
4723997,5,B005LAIH0Y,"It's exactly as the caption says at the bottle of the movie cover: ""This is the film The Vatican doesn't want you to see."" Well, it's true. Even if you're not religious, this movie could possibly make you a believer that demonic possession can happen. The question isn't IF it will happen, it's WHEN it will happen.

If this film was not filmed as a documentary format, it would not be nearly as believable.",1397520000,,407,4.5
4723998,3,B005LAIH0Y,I was hoping for something more fearful.  It was an okay movie and  recommend it to others to watch.  For those who are scared of scary movies it will be scary enough.,1397347200,,167,4.15625
4723999,2,B005LAIH0Y,It was supposed to look like a documentary. It looked more like a bad mockumentary. Very disappointed in this movie.,1396656000,,116,4.85
4724000,5,B005LAIH0Y,Absolutely loved my product! This movie scared the crap out of me and it was awesome! It was in great condition and arrived on time.,1396224000,,132,4.32

4724002,3,B005LAIH0Y,"It was ok. Very predictable movie. The mockumentary style in the beginning was lost when they showed you different camera angles. It's ok for a jumpy scare but it's hard to compete with ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" or ""The Exorcism"" .",1395878400,,234,4.595238095238095
4724053,1,B005LAIH0Y,I decided to watch this film over Amazon Prime streaming because of the trailer I had seen in the theater a couple of years ago.  There were some moments in the trailer that definitely had me interested.  I'm glad I didn't pay anything because all the big scares were the ones in the trailer and having already seen them not once did I jump during the film.,1395705600,3,357,4.313432835820896

4724055,5,B005LAIH0Y,I enjoyed this movie because it was different from the rest and unpredictable. Great special effects!!! If you enjoy scary movies... This is a must see!!!,1395187200,,154,4.961538461538462
4724056,2,B005LAIH0Y,I love horror movies.  Always have.  This movie looked very promising from the trailer and I was even a little freaked out to watch it by myself initially.  There was such potential in the storyline and the movie just failed to produce.,1394841600,,236,4.571428571428571
4724057,5,B005LAIH0Y,This movie was pretty realistic and the animation on how they got some of the possessed peoples bodies to bend the way they did was amazing. Def worth seeing,1394323200,,157,4.448275862068965
4724058,1,B005LAIH0Y,Same old story with nothing new other than an awful ending.  Do not waste your time.  Tired of the documentary style filming.  Doesn't make the story any more real.,1394150400,,164,4.586206896551724
4724059,4,B005LAIH0Y,Much better than expected. Unpredictable. Would have gave it 4.5 but it won't let me. Definitely one of the better possession movies,1393632000,,132,5.045454545454546
4724060,3,B005LAIH0Y,"So hardly any questions ended up being answered but at one point there was a scene that said ""THIS IS A CRUCIAL PLOT POINT, PAY ATTENTION BECAUSE THIS WILL TELL YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT HOW THIS MOVIE IS GOING TO END"".

Long story short-girl's mother kills 3 people during an exorcism attempt and is found insane.  She is sent to Rome (to which the daughter is like, ""Wha?"").  The girls father is ""not in the picture"".  The girl just wants answers and off we go to Rome with a cameraman to film everything.

In Rome, we learn basically nothing except it was possibly an exorcism attempt.  The girl hooks up with one priest and layman that basically do 'illegal exorcisms' because the Catholic Church just has no clue how many possessed people are really out there.  They do it (chest thump here) for the greater good!  We get to see a class where the teacher talks about exorcisms etc, then we get to see the two dudes go on an actual exorcism where the chick bleeds like she's having her monthly and contorts in gymnast ways in the bed and runs across the ceiling.

Back to mom...girl gets to go see mom in the hospital. Mom starts talking all possessed and what not, telling the girl one thing about her that really freaks her out.  She goes back, discusses with the priests and they decide it's time for us to do our 'moral duty and exorcise this woman!'  They put on their capes and they are off to the hospital.  As predicted, it all goes wrong.  Strange but wrong.

They leave and it's all downhill from there.  Even the ending of the movie, where the viewer is left guessing-what the hell just happened?

And remember that freaky nun on the front of the movie?  Yeah, she's just some random nun they walk by with crazy blue eyes.  That's it.  Does she possess them? Nah, just does the ""Look crazy american tourists, I must show them how big and crazy blue my eyes are while I'm in the middle of a conversation!""

I wanted to like this movie so much but it left too many things unanswered for me.  Way too many things and the ending was so abrupt, I had to stop washing dishes and rewind the movie-thinking-did I miss something when I rinsed that glass off?  yes, I watch dvds while I clean the kitchen.  Hey, it's better than in the bathroom and it makes the cooking and cleaning oh so much more interesting.",1393545600,,2328,4.38785046728972
4724061,4,B005LAIH0Y,"The movie was quite interesting. It kept me watching, even at the slower parts. But the main focus of the movie, along with the stimulatory scenes, was the discussion between science and religion and the archaic actions of the catholic church and it's unwillingness to face issues head on; in this case demon possession. Can't say I don't believe",1392768000,,346,4.88135593220339
4724062,1,B005LAIH0Y,"This movie was not funny... And I'm afraid of watching scary movies.  The documentary style is tired.  The acting is awful and the ending is a cop- out, like they ran out of budget and had to cut it short.  Thank goodness this movie was a free one.",1392422400,,248,4.125
4724123,3,B005LAIH0Y,Pretty good exorcism scene and a decent twist that kept me watching until the end.  The acting brought my rating down.,1392422400,,118,4.619047619047619
4724124,1,B005LAIH0Y,Another fake documentary. They lead you to believe it's based on a true story but that's not the case.  Not worth the time.,1391990400,,123,4.3478260869565215
4724125,2,B005LAIH0Y,"Very few movies get a huge range of opinions like horror films. 'The Devil inside' is a great example; a number of Amazon reviews give this latest pseudo documentary/demon possessed flick the highest possible grade. If you stopped after reading those, you might be ready to move The Godfather down on your all time best list. However, there are just as many viewers who apparently only gave 'Devil inside' one measly star because the site makes a rating mandatory. After perusing these blistering pans, I wondered if the producers of the Police Acadamy sequels might be holding their chins a little higher lately.
  At the risk of appearing wishy-washy, I came down right about the middle. Unlike most moviegoers, I still have an affinity for the Fake Doc style. When used properly (Blair Witch, the first 3 Paranormal Activity films) it's still a terrific way of creating tension through a transferred feeling of realism. 'Devil' begins promisingly enough, with enough suspense, gore, and potential in the first 5 minutes to make me wonder what all the naysayers had been thinking. Unfortunately, the rest of the film's first act drags. The main character's mother is locked up in an asylum in Italy after murdering three people during an attempted Exorcism. Naturally, the evil-inhabited lunatic's lovely young daughter wants answers to the bizarre slaughter and decides to investigate, heading to Vatican City with requisite skeptical cameraman in tow.
  Knowing these basics, those who have seen more than one of these kinds of movies can probably predict the ensuing content. Daughter and camera guy attend Exorcism with 2 rebel priests. Shocks and weirdness abound. Daughter convinces the maverick do-gooders to take a look at mom, resulting in occurances that would instantly land on every country's newspaper front page instantly while becoming the most twittered/Googled event in history in the real world.
  There are some genuinely scary moments in 'Devil inside', as well as the usual reliance on shock value. But not nearly enough. Much of the dialogue is laughable, and the characters' decision-making during an obvious time period of extreme stress wouldn't be believable in a Jean Claude Van Damme flick. The acting is mostly decent, but any goodwill the film may have engendered is thoroughly erased by an abysmal ending. As reliable as the genre has been since 'The Exorcist', a true masterpiece, 'The Devil inside' suggests that it may be time for young filmmakers and eager producers to set their next fright films in a locale other than H-E-double hockey sticks.",1391904000,,2583,5.1380952380952385
4724126,2,B005LAIH0Y,Just not my kind of movie.  Didn't choose myself however.  Not sure if my girl liked it either.  This is on us--not you.  We picked it.,1391212800,,135,4.076923076923077
4724127,3,B005LAIH0Y,"This movie is filmed documentary style for the most part.  It is pretty creepy and has some good jump moments. I have seen better, but it was engaging.  You want to yell at the people, as in most of these movies, no one knows when to just run or stop what they are doing. A young woman, whose mother was involved in a failed ""sanctioned"" exorcism years before in America, sets out to do a documentary and figure out if the things that happened during the exorcism were really caused by a medical problem, her mother is now living drugged up in an asylum near Vatican City, or if she is really possessed. She attends an exorcism and convinces the priest to visit her mother. Maybe it is just me, but if the Vatican is afraid to try another exorcism, maybe they should have let it go. It is a pretty good lazy afternoon movie.",1390435200,,824,4.309677419354839
4724128,1,B005LAIH0Y,"terrible,however got to see a little of Rome...acting terrible the story is terrible seen on tv movie of the week",1389657600,,113,4.7
4724129,4,B005LAIH0Y,"I would really rate this at 3.5 stars because it is a decent movie. I expected it to be along similar lines to say ""The Conjuring"" for example. However this is more along the lines of Paranormal Activity meets Blair Witch. Granted those movies are quite popular these days and I do love the Paranormal Activity series. All of that being said this movie has a very simple plot that can be very easily predicted and followed. It is not overacted as some people say. If you have some free time and want a decent horror movie to watch try this one. It is not groundbreaking nor is it anything fresh, but it is decent.",1389052800,,613,4.339130434782609

4724131,1,B005LAIH0Y,"This isn't a true review because I only got 2 minutes into the film before rolling my eyes and turning it off.  It could be a 5 star film, but I doubt it.  I'm going to go with my gut and call it just another 1 star, stale, formulaic, boring Mocumentary.",1388707200,,254,3.9607843137254903

4724174,5,B005LAIH0Y,"We all need to get over ourselves...this was one hell of a suspenseful film. I liked it. This movie was captivating from the beginning. Starting with the real news cast and 911 call supposedly made by Marie Rossi was a brilliant way of bringing in the plot and story line right off the bat.
(More research I did on this Maria Rossi showed it was all creative fiction, but based on a real UK murderer of the same name) The pseudo documentary style is hard to pull off if your a director and producer, and they did a great job of putting it together seamlessly as to not draw too much attention to the camera.
Story: became very fresh when Isabella has to confront her mother, the twists in the writing was very clever, such as the exorcist priest invoking the evil spirit upon himself and hurting a baby at a baptism, as the cops get involved.
Plot: Is rather original, a girl wants to find and meet her long lost demon possessed mother who supposedly killed people.
Acting: lead girl was great, very well played a part of a lonely girl in Rome. The Priests both were very good actors, and believable.
Role players: such as the camera man, did act a bit and had to do little to convince the viewer of much emotion. I'd say the real actor is the possessed mother, wow, very hard to pull off all that intense rage...
Direction: if anything the direction was seamless, and the exorcisms were very realistic and quite frightening; the smutty talk in another language made it sickening and the blood splattered and sprayed.
Production and effects, looked to be as professional as the paramount name suggests, this is not a B rated film, it had a low budget, but you as the viewer never once noticed it that way.
I believed in the exorcists and put this at the top of these types films here on Amazon...",1386460800,17,1796,4.445454545454545

I will have to say that the lady who played maria rossi did an excellent job she was the only decent actor in this movie. all in all it was okay nothing to bad and nothing great. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you don't,1381795200,,519,3.8598130841121496

4724234,4,B005LAIH0Y,"Pretty good, I like the ""documentary"" aspect of it.  The acting makes it pretty suspenseful. There are far more scary movies but for something scary without gore I would recommend it.",1380758400,,183,4.903225806451613
4724235,4,B005LAIH0Y,"This movie has a good premise and is well executed.  If you don't like movies with the hand held camera, documentary style filming - then don't watch it.  If you don't like watching movies with hand held camera filming because it gives you a headache, or makes you dizzy, and you watched the movie anyway - maybe there's a lesson in there for you.  I would guess that if you spend your time watching a movie trying to discern how predictable it is, that's probably a good way to waste your time and not enjoy it, again if that's how you watch movies and you found this movie predictable and unpleasant to watch - good for you, but don't forget, that's an hour and 24 minutes you won't get back.  At least you stuck it out to the end.

  The movie tells an interesting story.  For a demon possession film it was pretty good, was reasonably creepy, with some uniquely disturbing scenes.  I wouldn't consider this a top ten horror movie, but I enjoyed it and did NOT find it a waste of time, or get a headache due to delicate sensibilities, or strange bio-rhythms related to a hand held camera filming.",1380412800,,1099,4.400990099009901

I don't know if the situation in this film ever took place, but if it didn't it is very good story telling.

It advertised itself as the most terrifying movie of the year, sadly that was not the case. The movie starts off with nothing out of the ordinary, an eerie phone call to the police Marria Rossi(Suzan Crowley) admitting that she killed three people. Followed by the police entering the home where the victims were killed during and exorcism being performed on her. The police then head downstairs to where the victims were killed, they find nothing way out of the ordinary in terms of gruesomeness but at the same time not completely boring. Fast forward, the daughter after twenty years goes to find her mother in an asylum in Rome(the film location is a plus). Where it transitions into a terrible documentary hand held camera for the rest of the movie. The daughter goes on several unauthorized exorcisms to find an answer to what happened. The film eventually climaxes with an extremely predictable and clichd ending finding myself asking ""was that it?"". The acting was sub-par accompanied by lax special effects leaving me somewhat unamused most of the movie.  I do not know of anyone that this movie would appeal to, audiences are looking for an original horror and after seeing this they are going to have to keep looking.

""The Devil Inside"" (2012 release; 83 min.) is another one of those ""fake documentary"" movies along the lines of The Blair Witch and Paranormal Activity, which is fine by me as I happen to generally like those movies. The plot matters little. All you need to know is that Isabella is investigating/making a documentary about her mother, who 20 years earlier murdered three clericals, supposedly while being possessed. Her mother is now in a mental institution in Rome, and so Isabelle goes out to Rome, where she gets to know several priests who are exorcist experts. To tell you more of the plot would be pointless.

Couple of comments: for the most part, the movie plays the ""less is more"" card, and pretty effectively at that. However, as has been commented by many other reviewers, I can only echo that the ending indeed is ""as bad as promised"", and just negates the previous 80 minutes in the movie, which is really a shame. You'll just have to see for yourself why. On the plus side, most of the movie is shot in and around Rome and Vatican City, which definitely adds some character to the movie. As  furthern aside, what is with the cover of the DVD jacket? It doesn't even have a real connection with the movie, and surely as about the ugliest cover I've seen in a long time. Bottom line: this movie is not bad per se, but the ending is inexcusable, begging the question ""what were they thinking""?

This film is presented as a documentary following the main character Isabella (Fernanda Andrade).  This tactic has been adopted by Grave Encounters and The Last Exorcism, though neither included testimonials or expert opinions of individuals that weren't involved in the story.

Twenty years ago this Isabellas mother brutally murdered some of her congregation members during a church group exorcism (her own exorcism).  After being found innocent (insanity plea) she is sent away to a very special facility specializing in exorcisms in Italy operated by the Vatican.  Just like a show on the History Channel we hear Isabellas testimonials and experiences as well as those of medical professionals and priests on the topic of mental illness and/or demonic possession.

The Vatican denies all involvement in exorcism but evidently has a graduate school program dedicated to the age-old practice just like in The Rite.  Exorcism stock footage is observed and followed by open forum diagnosis of the patient.  The priestly students are just like uber-academics; they think they know everything, they're irritatingly argumentative and they're suspiciously passionate about their work.  Being an attractive young girl with a life Isabella responds to them appropriately: like they're a bunch of good-intentioned, awkward geeks.  They give her some useful input, though, on coming to ones own terms with that which is mental illness and that which is possession.  How will I know, she asked.  Annnnnnd, cue the clich:  Youll know it when you see it.

Isabella visits her mothers special facility and the doctor denies the possibility of possession in lieu of abnormal mental function.  When visiting hours come, she is warned to make no mention of God, religion, fate or the like, as these things elicit violent outbursts.  Mom is quite sedated, wearing vacant expressions that randomly trade out for discomforting tones, a healthy compliment of different voices (as if harboring multiple personalities) and self-destructive commentary.  I was just waiting for her to do something messed up at any moment.

Back with the young exorcists they analyze the footage of her visit, during which Isabella's mother seemed to know something she couldn't possibly have known.  We also learn that these rogue exorcists are performing exorcisms without the churchs support.  To help her mother she must learn about exorcisms, not in a class but in person.  Possession scenes are complete with painful contortions, blood in all the wrong places and threats in multiple languages.

I feel like this film started out with so much promise.  I liked the semi-satirical documentary approach.  I liked that we got to know the characters through their own narrative via video log entries as much as by their actions.  I really thought I was finally in for a good possession movie.  Lord knows, its been a while.  But almost as soon as the possession scenes begin the film slowly falls apart until ""the ending that wasn't there.""

4724650,2,B005LAIH0Y,"Isabella travels to Italy along with a documentary filmmaker hoping that together they can unravel the mystery behind her mother's failed exorcism, which resulted in the deaths of three clergymen in the basement of her childhood home. What they discover will be more shocking than anything they could have imagined as they enlist the help of two newly-ordained exorcists to help free her mother from demonic possession. THE DEVIL INSIDE exacerbates an already unlikely scenario using the popular ""found footage"" technique, which works as a disadvantage just as much as it aids in the realism on screen. It is difficult to accept that the governing bodies in the hospitals and churches would allow a cameraman to enter, let alone the fact that he would jeopardize his well-being for the sake of the film. The style does produce some truly unnerving moments, however, particularly in the disturbing basement exorcism in which contortionist Pixie Le Knot performs several gut-wrenching maneuvers. The story quickly loses focus and asks way too much of its audience as we near the final third of the film, at which point it becomes entirely unbelievable. The filmmakers then have the audacity to hock the film's website for updates on the case, as if anyone would visit after being left with such a jumbled and inconclusive ending. Momentary shocks are not enough to win over modern audiences, who crave convincing characters and storytelling with their scares.

4724651,5,B005LAIH0Y,"You're darned right I'm going to defend this film because it's the best exorcism film I've seen in a long time.  I loved every minute of The Devil Inside, and that includes the ""controversial"" ending.  Did it end the way I would have wanted it to end?  No, but neither does Gone With the Wind, so boo hoo.  Never have I seen such a crybaby reaction to a movie scene, with scores of people heaping one-star calumny on an entire film - which some will actually admit they liked up until that point - purely because a director actually did something bold (the ending is not a cop-out) and threw viewers a wicked curveball at the very end.  Some of the criticism in the media is to be expected because William Brent Bell did not allow those pampered prima donnas to preview the film before it hit theaters, but I would hope that viewers can see fit to give this film a chance.  It's not as if the ending doesn't make perfect sense.

The Devil Inside is presented as a documentary of twenty-something Isabella Rossi (Fernanda Andrade) and her attempt to find closure regarding her mother's possible possession.  Some twenty years earlier, Maria Rossi (Suzan Crowley) murdered two priests and a nun as they were performing the rite of exorcism upon her.  Isabella hopes to learn whether her mother was really possessed or if she just went insane.  This takes her and her film crew to Rome, where Maria Rossi was mysteriously transferred after her acquittal of murder by reason of insanity.  It's definitely not normal for an insane murderer in America to be shipped off to a Roman Catholic mental institution just outside the shadow of the Vatican.  Isabella also takes the opportunity to visit the newly established Vatican school for exorcism, which leads her to two young exorcists who do not agree with the Church's policy of ignoring so many cases featuring all the hallmarks of actual demonic possession.

The exorcism scenes on display here are extraordinarily impressive - short and powerful.  A female contortionist who can twist her body into unimaginable positions makes for a much more realistic possession visual than a head-spinning, spider-walking Linda Blair.  These are some intense scenes with a pretty convincing vessel of unholy malevolence spewing out untold evil, and the supernaturally dangerous consequences of any exorcism attempt play out most dramatically as the film works its way toward what I consider its pretty bold and courageous ending.  The fact that our exorcists are Church-trained priests operating outside the narrow confines of Vatican policy only raises the thrill factor up a notch.

I know the whole documentary-style horror movie is in the process of being done to death, but I think The Devil Inside is an example of the genre done right.  The fact that the demon-spawned horrors and the exorcisms are presented so well gives the film a necessary dose of realism, and that is why The Devil Inside may inspire chills, creeps, obviously some boos at the end - but not laughter or ridicule.  It's definitely one of my new favorite horror films.",1359417600,4,3080,4.865900383141763

4724693,3,B005LAIH0Y,"Many who have seen this film have had terrible things to say about it. There are certain negative comments I agree with, and those I don't.

- I agree that the ending was a let down. There was so much in the film that was left too unresolved. There was a lot of good material the film couild have explored more. What ultimately happened to Isabella's mother? What ultimately happened to the other characters? This movie was okay, but it could have been really good if they had went farther with those story lines. And what about the eerie comments Isabella's mother made to Isabella and one of the priests about things she couldn't have known about? All interesting material that the film never uses.

- I don't agree that the movie wasn't scary. I thought that all of the scenes of demon possession were very intense and disturbing visually.

- Speaking of visuals, I got sick of how shaky the camera was. Are you really going to tell me that the cameraman couldn't keep the camera still for the WHOLE movie???? It made sense in certain scenes for it to be shaky, but not for the entire film. Blair Witch did it better, even when the camera was shaky. Even Paranormal Activity did it better.

- I disagree that the acting was bad. I thought all the acting, esp. the girl who played Isabella, was great. They conveyed the fears of their characters very well. I'd love to see all of them in more roles in the future.

Overall, good but not great. 3 stars.",1359244800,,1454,4.451127819548872
4724694,2,B005LAIH0Y,"Everything about these kinds of movies (The Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity, The Last Exorcism, etc.) is really low rent. The acting, the production values, the plots, and special effects are really low budget and it shows. I'm not sure why or how these films became so popular. You could shoot one with a few friends on the weekend and call it a movie. My problem is not that they exist. My problem is that movie theaters and film companies charge full price to see them. Granted, I only watch them for free on Amazon Prime or on Netflix, but lots of other people spend the $11 (or more) to go see them at the theater. They can, I guess, be fun for teenagers. However, I find it hard to believe that anyone above 12 actually finds these movies scary. I've sat through a lot of boring air time watching these movies. Essentially almost nothing happens for over an hour and then they try to pack a scare or two in the last 30 minutes. I can only assume that the makers of these films are laughing all the way to the bank. I sincerely hoped The Last Exorcism would be The Last exorcism or that Paranormal Activity would end all activity when it comes to these kinds of movies, but, alas, no. I suspect as long as people keep paying for them, they will continue to be cash cows for the film studios. Here's the thing, I want to be scared. I want a movie to actually make me turn on the lights, but these movies are don't supply any real scares. I'm not a slasher fan (aside for Silence of the Lambs, which was truly disturbing). I like the supernatural stuff. The reality is that exorcisms have been done a lot better in lots of other movies. The bottom line is that I didn't have to watch any of these movies (hence the title of my review), but I figured I should give them a fair chance by actually trying to sit through a few of them. I have to tell you, it's pretty hard.

Pet peeve: When people give movies like this 4 or 5 stars. I have to wonder if they've ever seen any other movies, like The Shining, The Exorcist, The Silence of the Lambs, or The Turn of the Screw, or The Omen. Not all of them were 5 star worthy, but surely, they were much better than any of the movies I've listed in the first sentence of this this review.",1359072000,,2242,4.238317757009346

It forces us to question everything!!!  Anyways, I digress.  Okay, it's not award winning acting or production.  I liked the possession scenes. The mock documentary thing is a little played out, but it's not too annoying or distracting.  I can't believe people are saying ""It's the worst movie ever!"", but one guy didn't like Everything is Illuminated, so I guess it's a matter of taste.  I thought it was entertaining.  I jumped in some parts.  I love the demon possession premise, so I didn't think this movie was too bad.  It's worth watching.

4724735,1,B005LAIH0Y,"The Devil Inside follows Isabella Rossi as she tries to find out what caused her mother, Maria Rossi, to kill three people; according to her father, Isabella's mother committed these murders while possessed by a demon and during her exorcism. Isabella documents her journey to Rome where she meets two priests and personally experiences several exorcisms. The Devil Inside is a missed opportunity to create a truly terrifying possession film simply because it was too generic- simply because it never tried to be different. It doesn't help that it's also riddled with flaws.

The Devil Inside has a very simple story: Isabella tries to find out whether her mom was actually possessed, or is her mom actually mentally ill? It really isn't anything special or new, which is a problem. The bigger problem was the failure to create an immersive world, or have engaging dialogue/conversations. The exorcisms in this film didn't feel intense or frightening- I didn't feel sad for the possessed character, and it really didn't focus on the possessed characters at all (it probably would've had more impact and significance if it did.) The ""twisted body, popping bones"" possessions have gotten old, and have lost their effectiveness. It's not really a scary film, either. All of the jump-scares are literally loud shouts. And, the ending was extremely unfulfilling; it just ends without any closure. I realize filmmakers occasionally have trouble finishing up their films, and finding an ending that will be universally loved, but rushing the ending and telling people to visit a website isn't the answer (recent examples would be ""Insidious"" and ""The Pact""- although I liked these endings/third acts, I understand why many found them underwhelming)

And, when I say ""too generic"", I mean it follows the same structure we've seen in found-footage films for the past few years. The same type of dialogue; characters get mad at each other, the main character complains about being filmed although she agreed to be documented, etc. Then, there is the finale, which is similar to those in [Rec] and Paranormal. Activity; the lights go out, characters panic, someone suddenly appears and scares everyone, etc. ([Rec], however, did this right since it build tension.) It's basically the same film/structure we've seen plenty of times before.

Overall, The Devil Inside is not a scary film; it lacks the character and innovation to create a truly terrifying and impacting possession film. If you still plan on watching this film, I strongly recommend you avoid the trailer as it gives away most of the film. As of 12/31/12, this film is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video and Netflix Streaming, I highly recommend streaming before directly paying for this film (I.e. Renting/buying).

4724741,1,B005LAIH0Y,"This movie was completely pathetic. I know I'm almost a year late on the band wagon but what I find just so f***ing offensive about this film is that if they even put a little bit more effort into at least the ending then it would've been a better movie.

I'd be willing to ignore some of the stupid crap they did throughout the short running time, such as the characters whining about each other over things we never get to see and have to just go along with, I'm willing to accept the stupid 'demon jumping' crap that's like a wannabe zombie infection thing with demons, I'm willing to accept the half assed acting and the fact that a rogue priest is suddenly s***ing his britches over fear of punishment by the Catholic Church, EVEN THOUGH HE'S ALREADY EXORCISED LIKE SIX PEOPLE. Yes, I'd be willing to let all this bulls*** slide if they didn't put up a giant middle finger for the ending.

There was some good potential with this film, the main character's plight about saving her mother for example, her mom got locked up years ago and she wanted answers, especially because there was no other family for her. Also a daughter seeing her mom who's gone completely insane is sad, people who's parents have gone through dementia can probably relate to that. Also two priests that became rogue exorcists was a neat-o concept, it took the old boring exorcist formula and made it more interesting, it actually gave the film momentum instead of most wanna be Exorcist movies where it's a priest reflecting on his faith or whatever crap for half the movie.

Even an abrupt ending could've worked if done better. How about say, they kidnap the mom, bring her to their house or something, and she winds up killing them all and is loose on the streets of Italy. A little more open ended instead of ""GOOGLE THE F***ING ENDING BECAUSE WE STOPPED GIVING A S***"", has more of that creep factor with ""oh snap a possessed woman is wandering the streets"", or at least have the cast die trying instead of all of them being wiped out when they're caught with their pants down.

Just, f***ing, pathetic. It's not even bad enough of a movie where you can just laugh at it's terribleness, it's just a lazy slapdash scam that could've been something substantial if they just put a little bit more effort into it.",1351987200,4,2294,4.547215496368039

And if this was inspired by true events then where is the proof? It wasn't in the news and they didn't mention the people's real names that were involved in such an incident/s so overall it's some damn good acting because they even said in the credits that they hired contortionists to do the body twisting scenes - that one scene where the woman dislocated her arm is pretty hard to watch and where is the proof that people really died from these things if they're inspired by real life true events. - I do love that DVD cover though that shows the nun as if she's blind or possessed (but whoever heard of a possessed nun?) and it gives a creepiness to the actual effect of the overall film. It draws your attention to it.
 There's another movie out there called The Rite with Anthony Hopkins in it where this was supposed to have happened to a priest but I never saw anything in the news on it either and I don't know if these two movies were derived from the same story lines. The movie The Rite claims in it that the vatican had over 500,000 (half a million) reported cases of demon possession in the last year and they have an exorcism school at the vatican now, if this is true then why is it not reported in the news?

Yet... here I went...

I have to say, it was believable... even the ending. I love realism when it comes to horror... which is why The Devil Inside interested me to begin with... also that, and I am addicted to Exorcism movies/articles/documentaries.

Don't go into this expecting Green Pea Soup to be spit everywhere and a lot of gore. Go into this movie expecting to see some things that would FREAK YOU OUT if they happened to you in real life. If you can do that, you'll enjoy this movie. If you can't you might as well skip this one. You have to look at it from a stand point of real life to truly enjoy it.

I am so immune to scary things it's unreal, however, a ""normal"" person would probably have a freaking heart attack.

Now make no mistake about it... the ending SUCKS. But aside from that... the film is tolerable for those of us who like EXORCISM subjects.

""The Devil Inside"" was theatrically released and hit the No. 1 at the box office, displacing Tom Cruise's ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol."" While the commercial success of ""The Devil's Inside"" proves the popularity of the found footage genre, the film itself is a huge disappointment because, simply put, the film is just boring.

""The Devil Inside"" begins with a murder case involving Maria Rossi (Suzan Crowley), who apparently killed two priests and a nun during the exorcism performed on her. Twenty years later, her daughter Isabella (Fernanda Andrade) travels to a hospital in Rome, where Maria was locked in. Isabella attempts to find the truths about the murder with a help from young priests Ben (Simon Quarterman) and David (Evan Helmuth), who perform an unauthorized exorcism.

""The Devil Inside"" is not scary. That itself is not a real problem. ""The Last Exorcism"" was not particularly scary, but it at least had a few interesting characters. In ""The Devil Inside"" you have none. We relate to none of the characters that keep talking, and then yelling. The storyline seems contrived. Some of the questions are left unanswered (for the sequel, perhaps).

Actors are so desperate trying to look real that it is obvious they are acting. The acting is amateurish, and so is writing.  The abrupt ending (with a brief note from the filmmakers) has been already criticized. What really amazed me is the end credit that rolls so slowly. In short, we feel short-changed.

Apparently the film was really shot in Rome. That is good because this is the only thing I found convincing in the entire film.",1343260800,,1642,4.956363636363636

I've seen my fair share of movies on the subject and I almost always find something worthwhile in them. When I started the movie, I had no expectations, which I suppose is good, since it wouldn't have lived up to any of them.

Aside from a creepy (but very brief) performance by Suzan Crowley, the acting teetered between uninspired and over-the-top. The characters were uninteresting and under-developed, the story itself was extremely ""ho hum,"" and the ending literally made me laugh out loud. Not because it was funny, but because it was so abrupt and unsatisfying, that all I could think of was, ""Is that seriously the end of the movie?""

4725019,5,B005LAIH0Y,"The Devil Inside is both the latest exorcism movie and the latest found footage from an incomplete documentary film to hit cinemas, which smashed the US box office when it opened in January to the tune of $33 million dollars. Not bad considering it cost less than a million to make and eventually went on to gross 83 times that worldwide and hasn't even opened in the UK until today.

The setting for our press screening of the film was a suitably spooky Round Chapel in Hackney, which provided incredible acoustics for the film and having actual nuns and priests acting as Ushers and singing hymns in Latin added to what was already a great, Gothic setting for the screening. Odd considering the fact the film begins with the same tagline that is splashed across all the posters, `The Vatican does not endorse this movie'.

Isabella (Fernanda Andrade) travels from America to Rome to visit her Mother whom she has not seen since she was declared insane and mysteriously sent to an asylum in Vatican City after murdering three members of her local church that were trying to perform an Exorcism on her. Isabella's life has been haunted ever since and she finally wants to get to the bottom of the mystery surrounding her Mother and determine whether she is insane or is in fact possessed.

She attends a class on Exorcism where she meets Fathers Ben and David who are both ordained exorcists and rebels against the strict rules the Catholic Church now has in place around performing an exorcism; in essence it is the very last resort and can only be taken into consideration if all forms of mental illness can be absolutely ruled out.

Isabella meets her Mother (Suzan Crowley) and it's clearly the woman she meets is not the one she called `Mommy' as a little girl. She speaks in several different voices and languages, has upside down crosses scratched into her arms and gums, possesses super human strength and knows dark secrets about Isabella that she never shared with her. Is she possessed? The church doesn't think so, but Isabella, Ben and David certainly do and take it upon themselves to perform an exorcism, which does not go to plan.

Made as a mockumentary, with a camera crew following Isabella on her trip, The Devil Inside sounds like just another exorcism movie that will draw a crowd off that alone. However, I was pleasantly surprised (and terrifyingly shocked) by the result. The Exorcist aside, I am not a fan of exorcism movies. Since starting writing for What Culture I have given caustic reviews to other movies that have attempted to take on the exorcism as a subject matter - The Rite and The Last Exorcism, classing them as clich&eacute;d and above all ineffective. And while on second viewing I found the latter of the two had some virtues (The Rite is a film I wish never to be in a fourty mile radius of) and used the mockumentary/ lost footage style of filmmaking to some effect I was left wanting, ultimately because it didn't offer any new insight into exorcism. The Devil Inside, however, does just this.

I really enjoyed learning about the ways in which patients are now carefully studied and all aspects of mental illness taken into consideration before an exorcism is even considered. It paints a picture of the new Catholic Church, jaded in bureaucracy, for better or worse. It was also an excellent tool to make us root for this crew of people fighting against the odds of a huge organisation to do what they felt was right and free a woman from her inner turmoil.

Apart from this original and new to me - at least - information on the Catholic Church's stance on exorcism the film is also exceptionally well made. Characters are well constructed, their motivations clearly laid out and the plot excellently set. The latter is well paced and unfolds in the style of a classic horror narrative, with a healthy dose of shocks, some gruesome, some unnerving, some just clever visual tricks that are nicely interspersed. The shaky camera is used to great effect and actually adds a real sense of realism to the exorcism scenes. But the real success is the sense of mood that is created and maintained. It's atmospheric, edgy. They manage to make Rome very gothic and devoid of any real beauty. It looks dark and grey and miserable. The sun is absent from this Rome.

In the Eli Roth produced The Last Exorcism they started to play with the way a victim contorts their body in ways that boggle the mind, turn the stomach and cause a viewers face to scrunch up. As of course William Friedkin did in the original with the classic - and oft-comically lampooned - head turning scene. And here they take it a step further. Apart from there now being multiple occasions of extreme contortion, the execution is far more effective and cringe-inducing to the point I had to look away.

The cast are solid, with particular mention going to Suzan Crowley who plays the possessed mother. Crowley's performance is as haunting as it is terrifying; her facial expressions, the way she throws her voice and the way she moves her body are deeply convincing and very affecting. Fernanda Andrade also holds her own in the leading role; she's expressive and very genuine. It's a performance of great restraint, but when she is called upon to be vulnerable or aggressive she comes through with great aplomb.

The ending is rather abrupt and lacks creativity; it does feel like the filmmakers ran out of steam and couldn't find a good ending so decided to choose a smash-grab-get out while the audience are still reeling from the events that have come before, which is in keeping with the `lost footage' genre that this sits in. I'm not sure whether this is a shame or a virtue. While they dodge the exorcism movie clich&eacute;, they fall into the `lost footage film' clich&eacute; and ultimately pull short of doing something really creative. This is the film's greatest flaw.

The ending aside, however, The Devil Inside is a thoroughly successful movie as both a horror film and a mockumentary.

Also since ""The Blair Witch Project"" and more recently the ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise more and more horror films have tried to be creative by presenting their material in first person/documentary style filmaking often with varied results.

Exorcism movies have become much more popular in the past few years, especially the psuedo documentary style some display though ""The Last Exorcism"" was the worst of them in my opinion and you again always have to take this ""real story"" presentation with a grain of salt. Such is the case with ""The Devil Inside"", where we start in 1989 with footage showing police going through a house after three clergy members were murdered and a woman confessed to the murders via a 911 call.

If it stopped there we would've had a short movie but flash foward 20 years later, now we see the daughter of the killer who wants answers for why her mom did what she did years back. What follows is the usual jump out of your scares, the daughter's own questioning about whether its in her genes to snap and go mad like her mom. There's also the great debate throughout about whether its demonic possession or simply a degenerative mental disorder.

While it may have sounded like I was slamming the film and its by no means great it does provide a few good jolts, the acting is at least acceptable and it does have some good elements to its story. For those wanting more than one exorcism in an exorcism film you get your fill here, so fans rejoice.

The film had such a good story, pretty descent shooting/editing, and the angles that were shot were just magnificent! What a lot of people didn't notice was that the acting was very good!!! Horrors don't creep me easily, but those exorcisms all looked real. Noone seemed to appreciate that all because the movie was rated 'worst movie ever made' due to the ending. Come on, yes the film could've been longer but I feel like the ending and the whole plot itself of the movie was highly unpredictable. I feel for an exorcism found footage film it was better than The Last Exorcism

People don't also realize that films like these take time to think before they even start filming. Usually ""found footage"" films spend more time in Pre-Production(rehearsal and planning) than they do with Filming, and Post-Production(editing) (which most Hollywood films they spend more time on shooting, and Post and less on Pre-Production).

People don't seem to appreciate a film like this because of the way it ends and that they want to see real facts and proof that the movie is real. If the movie doesn't end the way it ended then it would seem like the film was fake!

 Found-Footage films like these have lots of thought put into them and it takes a lot of creativity to do films like these and that's why I love films like this so much.

Throughout 99% of the movie I was very impressed and actually thought that it was one of the best horror films that I had seen in a long time. But then the end came. I have NEVER been so incredibly disappointed by the ending of a film I think ever.

So, in conclusion (see, there is such a thing), the so-called ""ending"" to The Devil Inside was soooooo incredibly bad and lacking that it does not make the movie worth seeing in the least.

While I felt the entire cast acted well, I greatly enjoyed Simon Quarterman and Fernanda Andrade's performances.  Isabella's quest for knowledge before jumping into a new exorcism for her mother, to me provided a great amount of scientific and religious background for the viewer, while others may have found this to be a bore, which is why I feel this movie better targets a more mature and intellectual audience.

If I'd known The Devil Inside wasn't a movie, but someone holding a camera, jerking, to boot, I'd never have rented it. Thankfully, it was only 1.00. 1.00 lost.

The errors!

In the beginning it's stated Maria killed three people. While Isabella, 'Maria's daughter' is telling the story, she says her mother killed two people.

I can't count the number of times the actors laughed during a serious scene. Probably didn't realized the 'one' camera was directed at them.
Their laughter was contagious..felt like I was watching Bloopers.

In one scene, Father David Keane is performing Baptism. In an earlier scene, he says he's in trouble with the church. Why then, would be be allowed to Baptize a baby???

Stupidity!

Father Keane cuts his wrist. There's blood everywhere. A second priest, Father Rawlings, has a baffled/dumb look on his face and mumbles, 'What should I do?'  Duh, call for an ambulance or get the *ell out!

4725119,1,B005LAIH0Y,"While it's certainly not the worst movie ever made (if you think so you haven't seen enough movies), ""The Devil Inside"" is pretty bad. Whatever possessed the makers of this film to think this was a good project hopefully has been driven out of them by the bad press, bad box office but, more importantly, a good priest performing an exorcism rite. Perhaps the entire inspiration for this film is the fact that the filmmaker bit the inside of his lip and noticed it resembled an inverted cross and the entire film sprang from that.

This faux documentary focuses on Isabella Rossi (Fernanda Andrade from The Glades: The Complete First Season and Sons of Anarchy: Season Three)as she and a film crew try to uncover what happened when an exorcism involving her mother went horrible wrong resulting in the murder of three people. The film crew discovers a pair of priests (Simon Quarterman and Evan Helmuth)who are willing to assist them in their pursuit of the truth which, ultimately, results in an attempted exorcism of Isabella's mother (Susan Crowley).

The problem with the film isn't the acting nor the production values (although it was produced for a reported $1 million) but, instead, the weak writing/direction itself. There is the germ of a good idea here and it's different enough from all the other films about possession to make for a better film in someone else's hands (and clearly there's enough interest in the material itself as the film made $52 million in theaters).

The faux documentary genre has worn thin with increasingly pathetic films. This is the type of junk that I would expect to see on the grammatically challenged Syfy channel.

The DVD image quality is, as one would expect, a bit rough but that's part of the look of these type of films. Audio sounds fine with some nice directional use of the 5.1 mix particularly during some of the more action driven sequences.

Nothing worthwhile in the special features department although if you do go to the website listed at the conclusion of the film there are some youtube videos that look as cheap an inauthentic as the film itself.

""The Devil Inside"" has an interesting idea but poor execution. The actors do a fine job with what they are given to work with and the practical/visual effects aren't bad.

This is another one of those shaky-cam movies that are all the fashion these days in the horror business.  The plot is really unoriginal and very predictable.  If you have seen several recent horror films over the past few years, you can probably predict what is going to happen while this movie unfolds.  The ending has to be the lamest I have ever seen.  The audience groaned through out the theater when I saw it and apparently that was the typical reaction at many other screenings.  Don't pay attention too much to the cover art.  The woman on the cover appears for only about one or two seconds and is not actually possessed.  Sure she looks strange but she is not a major character in the movie.  She's more of an extra really.

I say might have died because the end was a cliffhanger. But not even a good cliffhanger where you can't wait for the next movie to come out so you can find out what happened. No, in the movie when the movie ended, I was just so happy that it ended, that I don't care at all what happened to any of the charters. I can only fantasize that they all died.

Despite how the majority feels about this movie, I thought it was a pretty good movie. I found it to be alot more interesting than The Last Exorcism. What amazes me is that The Last Exorcism recieved positive reviews from the media(I assume because it was the first found footage movie concerning Exorcism). Heck, I liked this movie even more than the third Paranormal Activity(and I love those movies).  I've seen quite a few 'found footage' movies since Blair Witch Project came out years ago and, believe me, I've seen far far worse movies. I'll admit, I didn't like how the movie ended either but, given thought about it, that was a worthy conclusion to the story. I suppose viewers would've wanted to see someone else become possessed with their eyes rolling back in their head and then the camera fading to black or something to that effect(leaving things open for a second movie) or actually seeing the demon appear itself? Still, It was an entertaining movie to me. It held my interest through til the end and that's all that really matters. I'd recommend it but I guess it all really depends on your taste in movies.

 footage films. Well, it kind of is. The Devil inside was clearly influenced by
 paranormal activity to some degree just in the way the camera work is done. The
 entire movie is presented as if it were a documentary. Personally I feel a real
 documentary about exorcism would be much cooler to watch and I'm now making a
 note that I should do such.

The movie opens with a message I personally found so hilarious I have to
 share it with all of you. It states the movie is not endorsed by the Vatican.
 Has there ever been a movie about demonic possession that was endorsed by the
 Vatican? Has the pope ever seriously said ""in the name of all that is holy
 I command you to go see (insert movie title here)""? I don't think so, but
 it does conjure some fairly amusing imagery.

My final thoughts are this movie is bad, not bad as in pisses you off, but still bad.
This movie much like its predecessors will become
 a cult classic over time. The exorcism scenes are fun if you aren't looking for
 anything new. The Entities have dialogue that is clever at times. It is an okay
 party movie and something that would be enjoyable to watch with friends

I agree with the controversy of it was not for everyone because it wasn't a PARANORMAL ACTIVITY (yes, I brought out the big boy) type of scare, but more of a physcological thrill as it makes you wonder if being possessed is really being possessed or if it is a mental illness. There were just a few problems with the movie....

Number 1: I thought this was about MARIA ROSSI? That's what the trailer said, that's what it said in the beginning. But In the movie, she is hardly there at all. We see her what, twice? Through the movies entirety. The rest of it is trying to prove whether or not she's possessed. The other exorcism with the double jointed girl was very interesting (If not disgusting) but I didn't care about her, I wanted to see Maria.

Number 2: The nun on the case. Dont buy the movie for her. She's in the movie for like 5 seconds. I'm so sick of people being like ""Ooo I love this case! It looks creepy! Let's get it"". She's not a huge character. Get over it.

Number 3: The reason why my review had 3 stars. THE ENDING. Yes, I am one of the many that hated the ending. I was so into the movie at that point that I was hoping that we'd see the priest actually exercise them and see the demons continue to fight over their human hosts, but instead, it's almost as if the director got bored and decided, ""Well, screw it!"" and just killed them off. I did not check out the website on the credits because I bought the movie to learn about the case of Maria Rossi, not to have to go to a website to learn.

This is a story about a young woman searching for the truth about her mom and trying to ultimately help her recover and come home to the USA. It has a choppy storyline and the filming of the movie is poor for many reasons. Too many scenes are in the dark and the camera filming is jumpy the entire movie. Such filming gives me a headache.

The script is written like it is the story about a documentary and the acting is about as poorly portrayed. This film had so much potential to be a much better film but it seemed to me that the director did everything possible to be cute with the filming and make it over dramatic that it simply missed its mark. That includes the black screen when all of the lights and the camera go out in the middle of the exorcism. Who wants to look at a black screen while watching a movie in the one scene that the entire movie is about?

To get possessed by a demon there are two ways for this to happen, first you have to open yourself up to the demon through witchcraft, satanism, sorcery, new age spiritualism ect, if your doing that your obviously not a Christian and you will become possessed but to engage in black magik the only way to move in the supernatural is to be in communion with it. Now one other way is through the bloodline there is bible scripture to back this up, don't have the verse off hand but if you reply back and want it, I can provide it later, do if your ancestors or parents or grandparents and do on, we're involved in the activities listed above and never because a christian afterwards and never broke the curse or bondage to the demons they had been in communion with, that demon has legal right to possess the desensdents through the bloodline, look at paranormal activity 3 (spoiler Alert for PA3 if you haven't watched that movie please don't read)there was a lot of truth in that movie about a demon been passed down through the family because the mother was a witch that ""thought"" she had control of the demon when she was only a puppet. That's why the demon kept falling the family. The Last Exorcism had a lot of truth to it as well because it was a satanic cult involved and the ending was not the greatest but it was more believable the. This movie The Devil Inside, u actually liked the movie until the 3rd act and I hated the Idea of the demon passing from person to person as a contagious disease, that is a stupid idea and is not an accurate look at possession, if that were to be the case we would all be possessed, I don't like from any of these movies how the powers of darkness are stronger than God in these movies, rubbish I have encountered demons before and they have no authority over me and I'm not scared of them, I have also encountered possessed people before and the only way for them to be free from that possession is through salvation through Jesus Christ and months of counseling and prayer for delivering the demons from them, not ""exorcising"" them. In the book ""he came to set the captives free"" I think that's the right title a lady was a head of the largest witch coven in Europe and she became a Christian, it took several months of prayer and fasting with a minister that does counseling to be delivered of several hundred demons, this sometimes can take a long time. And not a sensational event that heppens with Hollywood flair, if you want a look into real ministries that deal with this stuff check out the documentary Ferious Love it's really good and eye opening, thanks for reading",1337385600,2,2887,4.480075901328274
4725372,3,B005LAIH0Y,"In the recent years following the success of the runaway hit The Exorcism of Emily Rose, movie studios can't seem to get enough of demonic possession.  It seems that with each passing year, the Devil picks another young nubile lady to claim as his own and another young priest must get with his inner Father Merrin to try and save her.  In keeping with this new trend, Paramount has delivered to the public The Devil Inside.

  Here we meet Isabella de Rossi whose mother Maria murdered three clergy members during a routine exorcism gone bad. Found insane by a jury, Maria is sentenced to spend the rest of her days in a mental hospital. But, for some odd, unexplained reason, the Vatican has her moved out of the States and shipped overseas to Rome in what has to be the only case in history where the Church has the power over the Court System to do so.  Convinced that her mother is not crazy and is in fact under demonic control, Isabella teams up with a documentary filmmaker and goes to Italy where she meets two rogue priests who want to help her case. Of course the Vatican, in all it's hypocrisy, has no desire to actually help out does everything it can to sweep Maria under the rug. But than things turn for the worse and the Devil begins to not only target Maria but also Isabella's team as well.

  Once again we are led to believe that what we are seeing is a true story which means that this is found footage. Of course it is never once explained who actually found the footage or why anyone thought that the public needed to see it in the first place. There is no score which, for me, really hampered the movie's overall effect. And of course we get the usual cliche moments that we come to expect from a exorcism movie: the speaking in various languages, the use of a double jointed contortionist, superhuman strength, and the usual camera drop to let us know when the movie is over and this time it's a really big drop.  While its no Emily Rose, it is light years beyond the bad The Rite and the worst The Last Exorcism.  As for the controversial ending, I didn't mind it do much as wanted a little more. There were still several loose ends left that I guess will be explained in the sequel which I'm sure is in the making such as what one priest supposedly did that was so bad that God won't forgive him. Also, if this was a true story why are we just now hearing about it?  Too many things happen in full public view such as an American priest attempting to drown a baby in a baptism or Isabella's attack on one of the doctors in the hospital near the end that would have newspapers all over the world flocking to Rome to put their own spin on the story. But my biggest complaint is that I found the movie very predictable in terms of how it would play out and was found to be correct. Still, I'll recommend it if you have about 90 minutes to kill and nothing better to do. Rent though before you buy unless you find it under $8.",1337385600,,2950,4.2859712230215825

Though there are the basic irritants such as the hand held camera documentary style that is begining to get pretty old by now, and the fact that while the acting is pretty good it feels a little bit off the mark at times, it does contain some genuinly realistic possession and exorcism sequences that did manage to get under my skin. No floating bodies here. Nearly no silly deep demon voices, and no cheesy special effects. What you do see is extra special detail paid to what it might be like to witness an actual authentic exorcism. I have seen probably more than 2000 horror films in my lifetime, and have seen everything from the Christopher Lee vampire films to the most taboo horror films such as the very sick and twisted fact based movie 'Cannibal' about a man who puts and add out on the internet looking for someone who is willing to be killed and then systematicaly eatin by him, who then finds a willing subject. So I have seen it all, and I must say this movie did manage to creep me out several times. This is not groundbreaking to any extent but much of it did seem to cross the borders into a rather realistic and often unsettling little movie about exorcism, the catholic church' position on it, and the more realistic look at what real demon posession might be like.

I have to admit that I was actually kind of excited to watch this. I don't scare easy and the last few that got me were ""Insidious"" and ""Emily Rose"" and this one I expected to be more like ""Emily Rose"". I was severely disappointed. For those that have seen the ""Last Exorcism"" you will know what to expect. This is yet another fake documentary type movie and I really think that that genre has run it's course. My big problem with it is that it went from a movie about exorcisms to a type of ""Real World"" movie with each person taking their turn complaining about the others on camera. I expected to be scared and would up trying to stay awake and stop laughing. Overall, nothing like I expected or even wanted. I give it a C-",1333411200,,1057,4.510416666666667

However, I do enjoy movies about exorcisms as well as possession so I figured I would give it a chance.  After all, I didn't think it would be any worse than the ""Last Exorcism"" that was out last year.  After watching it I can say that I honestly enjoyed the film, granted it was not the best movie ever made, but it was far from the worst crap I have seen.  Maybe since I have interest in the subject matter of Psyche vs Possession debate that the slower parts of the film still held my interest.  Definatetly not a film for serious Michael Bay film fans, not enough explosions to hold their attention.  As for the ending of the film, I felt that it was a fitting way to wrap it up as any.",1333324800,27,839,4.116564417177914
4725440,1,B005LAIH0Y,"Over 20 years ago Maria Rossi (Suzan Crowley) places a breathy call to 9-1-1 in which she professes a recent triple homicide and her apparent asthma.  Fast-forward to the present, and her ""sorta-cute, but not cute enough to headline a movie""-daughter Isabella (Fernanda Andrade) travels to a hospital for the criminally insane in Italy to see if her mother is literally crazy, or actually has become multi-lingual and enjoys the flavor of her own urine.  Along her path of discovery, she encounters two priests trained in the ""art"" of exorcism:  Fathers Ben Rawlings (Simon Quarterman) and David Keane (Evan Helmuth).  The priest pair performs unauthorized exorcisms on the people the church deems ""contortionist crazy,"" both a clinical and religious term.  Will they open Pandora's box too far?

Simply put, the movie is boring, highly unoriginal (enough of the ""found footage"" films), and as predictable as the next Paranormal Activity flop.  Instead of actually developing the characters and providing compelling actors - only Quarterman really provides a decent, anguished performance - the faux documentary just shaky-cams as a plot device or to cover storyline inadequacies.  Additionally, I neither associated with nor liked the characters at all; luckily enough, however, several other kindred spirits in the theater shared a prolonged groan of disappointment when the film's credits rolled.

Films like this are supposed to end abruptly, but so do car crashes, and I don't particularly want to experience another one.  The same goes for this film or any possible sequels.",1333065600,4,1580,5.334677419354839

I'm so intrigued by exorcisms and murders and horror, it was like a documentary for me with exorcisms with a great story line. I thought they did an EXCELLENT job with Maria's exorcism, I've never seen a movie with that intense of an exorcism. I loved how the demon passed onto it's next victims, that's something I haven't really seen in a lot of those kinds of movies.
I know everyone is disappointed by the ending, but really, HOW ELSE IS IT GOING TO END? There is no other way it could have ended. I absolutely loved it. I also know that everyone is complaining about the way it was shot, but you also have to be the kind of person that loves that kind of filming, like The Blair Witch Project, The Zombie Diaries, Cloverfield (even though that movie was horrible), and the Paranormal Activity movies.
I think this movie is just for a certain type of person, someone that loves documentaries, loves horror, and doesn't mind a dialogue every once in awhile. And not everyone is going to like that stuff, they were all hoping for a fun, scary movie, but this isn't for everyone.

4725494,5,B005LAIH0Y,"Actually, many people are considering this as the worst horror movie of 2012 thus far, still the movie reached blockbuster status, reaching roughly $100 million on a $1 million budget. I personally don't get all the bad reviews this movie has, according to Rotten Tomatoes only 5 critics gave this film a good review, when they actually have forgotten some ( Movie Fanatic, Best-Horror-Movies, Bloody Disgusting [...]/, (review N2)), etc. ) In 1989, emergency responders received a 9-1-1 call from Maria Rossi (Suzan Crowley) confessing that she had brutally killed three people. 20 years later, her daughter Isabella (Fernanda Andrade) seeks to understand the truth about what happened that night. She travels to the Centrino Hospital for the Criminally Insane in Italy where her mother has been locked away to determine if her mother is mentally ill or demonically possessed. When she recruits two young exorcists (Simon Quarterman and Evan Helmuth) to cure her mom using unconventional methods combining both science and religion, they come face-to-face with pure evil in the form of four powerful demons possessing Maria; as I said before, I don't get the bad reviews for this movie because for me it was goddamn scary, the acting was great, especially Suzan Crowley who was a freaky Maria Rossi, the way the story unfolds is beautifull, the film constantly scares the hell out of you when you least expect it, and the ending was good enough for me, it leaves you wondering about the fates of this characters, and most of all, makes you return for the sequel. Overral, this film I can consider the best horror film from actual times since 2010's Insidious, and maybe the best exorcism film of the present century. Without doubt, a great follow up to what The Exorcist started in 1973.

4725496,3,B005LAIH0Y,"The Devil Inside opens with footage of a 1989 news story about an eerie 9-1-1 call made by Maria Rossi (played by Suzan Crowley) where she calmly confesses to brutally murdering three people. Twenty years later, her daughter Isabella is filming a documentary about exorcism in an attempt to understand the truth about what happened to her mother, and she travels to the Centrino Hospital for the Criminally Insane in Italy where her mother is a patient. Along the way, Isabella stops by a school in Rome and recruits two young priests to assist her in determining whether her mother is just mentally ill or demonically possessed. When the group attempts to treat Isabella's mom using unconventional methods combining both medicine and religion, they come face-to-face with four sinister demons who have possessed Maria, and one of them may even be the Devil itself.

This film opened very strong at the box office but dropped drastically in its second week, likely due to extremely negative (and in my opinion somewhat undeserved) reviews. I saw this film on opening night and I could tell that the sold out theater did not enjoy this movie. People may have even booed at the end. However, even though I didn't absolutely love this movie and it *completely* falls off the rails in its final minutes, there are a few things to really like about this movie. Even other horror film directors like Ti West are bashing The Devil Inside in interviews (even though Mr. West's own new release The Inn Keepers fails to deliver originality, decent acting, or scares), so I feel like I need to defend this film a little because Crowley was incredibly strong and scary as a possessed Maria Rossi, and the movie had great potential with some really original and interesting concepts, even if those ideas were not supremely executed.

There is a scene in this movie where Isabella first visits her mother in the asylum that I found extremely tense and chilling. Maria has awesome upside down crosses carved into her arms and even her bottom lip, and when she speaks she comes off very menacing, even though she is merely pacing slowly around the room and talking in a very calm and quiet voice. Maria knows things about Isabella that she could not know, and she repeatedly mutters an unintelligible phrase under her breath that you eventually come to realize is ""connect the cuts"" (referring to connecting all of Maria's upside down crosses cut out all over her body). This scene was perfection and really stuck with me. I found myself uttering ""connect the cuts"" a million times and I know I annoyed my boyfriend for days after seeing this movie with my ""connect the cuts"" outbursts. I couldn't help it, though; it is addictive and feels really good and creepy at the same time as it rolls off the tongue. You should try it and you'll see what I mean. It takes some practice and isn't easy to master either, which makes me appreciate Crowley's acting even more. She was so effective in this scene and I really would have liked to have seen more of her character in this movie. I could have done without the other cookie cutter exorcism Isabella attends with her two priests and could have used a lot more of Maria Rossi.

I also really enjoyed watching Isabella, her two priests, and her cameraman slowly devolve into madness after performing an exorcism on Maria Rossi. Instead of just having the demons instantly jump from Maria to the others during the exorcism as you would typically expect from this kind of film, Isabella and her cohorts appear to be just fine after the exorcism and instead slowly start to display signs of mental illness in the days following the exorcism. Even though movies rarely present it this way, I imagine in ""real life,"" possession would come on slowly and the demon would start taking over the possessed person's thoughts and behaviors gradually over time, leading observers to think the person was just mentally ill. Here, we can tell that something isn't quite right because Isabella is acting agitated and bitchy inconsistent with her normal personality, and the generally righteous, patient, and optimistic priest named David is acting uncharacteristically cold and anxious. Things of course escalate and all hell breaks loose in the final few minutes of the film, but I really liked the film's concept of possession. We learned things about Maria Rossi during this film that also seem to suggest that Maria was a little uncharacteristically depressed and distant in the months leading up to the night she killed those three people, so it would appear that Maria was taken over slowly as well. There is a lot of potential with this unique idea, even though it wasn't executed that well in the film's final scene, and I enjoyed The Devil Inside for that reason.

If I had made this movie, though, I would have taken this concept a little further and would have had the four demons fight each other for dominance and territory while inhabiting the bodies of Isabella and her companions. I would have had each demon trying to subtly ""one up"" the others until the four characters in the film had to battle it out to see which demon would prevail and which three would be left without a host when their human shells were ultimately destroyed. Since demons are always incredibly evil and just want to inhabit the innocent and wreak havoc on the world, I imagine they would not like each other very much either and wouldn't want to share one body. Maybe the four demons who possessed Maria Rossi for so long were all just itching to find new and younger bodies to inhabit on their own so they could then take out the competition. Just a thought.

The exorcism ritual is a very serious issue that doesn't allow bystander or cameras or people just filming. There is a great risk of things going wrong.  The scene where an italian teen is tied to a bed is believable, intense but there you have this Isabella Rossi standing there doing nothing as the demon started to flirt with her.... and the exorcists just allowed it.  Hmmmmm! From this point on the movie got wrong until it ended upo with the worst ending I have seen in recent horror films.

Besides, demonic entities do not jump from one human being to another as if it was a flea. Wrong! There are at least 3 stages of demonics possession: Infestation, Obssession and Possession. In this film they all skipped to Possession. If you want to get acquainted with the first 2 my recommendation is ""Drag me to Hell"" although no possession takes place here.

4725500,3,B005LAIH0Y,"I can understand some of the other less discerning reviews on this film.  It isn't film making at its best, but it certainly isn't film making and its worst, either.

The story starts out in New Jersey with ""actual"" footage from a crime scene.  A crime scene involving an exorcism--and three very dead people.  A survivor is then found and she is alleged to have killed a priest, a nun, and her husband while in the throes of exorcism.  There's a twist here, because for some reason the woman is sent to a hospital in Rome, Italy for her rehabilitation.  What follows is a ""documentary"" by her daughter, who is in search of some answers.

""The Devil Inside"" does not rely on cheap thrills or shocks to keep the audience's attention.  Anyone who has seen any film regarding this subject matter always goes in hopes of seeing the ""second"" Exorcist.  As I've said many times before, don't waste your time if that's what you have in mind.  This film can stand on its own.  It offers some actual medical reasons for what may (or may not) be possessions.  When Ms. Rossi decides to join two priests on an actual exorcism, some very creepy and unnerving things start happening.  I enjoyed everything BUT the ending which, to me, was a complete cop-out.  Had the film makers given any thought, they should have come up with something much more believable.  Perhaps they were thinking about a Part 2; I don't know.

4725501,2,B005LAIH0Y,"The trailer looked good and scary, but I thought the movie was a let-down.  Let me begin by saying that some of it was so shaky, I actually started feeling sick on the stomach.  I was expecting to like it, but . . .

On October 30, 1989, Maria Rossi called the police to tell them she just killed 3 people.  They were actually 2 priests and a nun, trying to perform an exorcism on Maria.  They were, obviously, unsuccessful.

Maria was subsequently found not guilty due to insanity and later transferred to an asylum. Although the archdiocese stated they did not authorize Maria's exorcism, they somehow got involved and had her transferred to their facility in Italy.  Daughter Isabella later states that Mom started changing when Isabella was age 6.

It is now December 2009 and Isabella is in her early 20s.  She sets off to the Vatican's school for exorcism, to learn more about the subject, and intends to stop by and see mom at the Centrino Mental Hospital.  Isabella also meets some guys who perform exorcisms for the church, but also perform some ""unauthorized"" ones on the side.  It seems the church only authorizes exorcisms where there is proof of possession, but the proof often is not displayed until an exorcism is performed.  These individuals (priests, I think), try to help the poor possessed folks the church turns down.

Like I said, the jerkiness of the film made it real hard to watch.  I do not recommend it.  It was entirely too distracting.  If you really have to see it, I suggest you rent it from one of those $1 booths.",1326672000,4,1546,4.587591240875913
