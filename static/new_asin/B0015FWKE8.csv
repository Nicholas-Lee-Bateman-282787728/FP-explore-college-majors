3144439,5,B0015FWKE8,VERY INTERESTING Piece of History that I was unaware of.  The use of hand held camera was a bit distracting and the audio was a bit hard to hear the voices over the ambient noises however all in all it was NICELY DONE!!!,1445558400,,220,4.116279069767442
3144440,5,B0015FWKE8,Very good. Video quality fair.,1444867200,,30,5.2
3144441,5,B0015FWKE8,"A dear friend of mine, Bella, was 14 when she was interred in Belsen.  She was stricken by Typhus and was rescued from certain death by the British in much the same stories as shown in the film.  She just turned 90 and I have nothing but admiration for her.  Your film paints a realistic portrait of this unforgettable moment in history.",1444867200,14,337,4.403225806451613

3144443,5,B0015FWKE8,"The BBC really knows how to make made-for-television movies that grip your attention, regardless of subject matter. This is no exception. The way the title characters are portrayed liberating a concentration camp would bring most of us to the brink of insanity. The characters are riveting and are also portrayed with real news footage. The resemblance of the Jewish dentist to the actress is unreal. The main hero/actor in this is such a hero facing the most inhumane conditions and trying desperately to deal with the situation. Films like this on Amazon Prime have made me such a happy subscriber but have expanded my knowledge about this terrible and dark period of Europe.",1444089600,8,677,5.0
3144444,4,B0015FWKE8,"This is an interesting story because it focuses on what occurred in the concentration camps after they were liberated.  I have not seen any movies or documentaries from this perspective.  So, I found the movie enjoyable.  It contains actual war and post war footage intertwined in the movie.  I think the movie is effective in telling it's story because it seems it is trying NOT to embellish anything.  Very informative for those that are interested in this part of history.",1443225600,19,475,4.8875
3144445,4,B0015FWKE8,This had some actual war footage and some Hollywood scenes.  Not a bad movie could be better.  My father was one of the British soldiers and some of this is good others not so.,1398729600,,176,4.147058823529412

3144452,5,B0015FWKE8,"An excellent reminder to those who like the excitement of victory and the profit of war......No matter what treaties are signed, the war isn't over until the humanitarian and institutional work is completed.

The movie was decently done' the message us critical.",1483056000,,262,5.238095238095238

3144457,1,B0015FWKE8,"The handheld camera effect was excessive to me, I was unable to watch it, I couldn't keep a focus, it was like being on boat on the high seas in a terrible storm, all the movement started to make me nauseous with a headache.  I really wanted to watch it, I bet it's good if you can handle the camera work.",1481846400,,305,4.0
3144458,5,B0015FWKE8,"Well done. Intertwining actual footage is highly effective. The truth of history should always be remembered. This film gives a viewpoint not often seen. The reality faced by the men and women who were there. Bravo,",1481587200,,215,5.0

3144460,5,B0015FWKE8,I thought this was an amazing movie other then the wierd camera perspective. It was a intense movie from the beggining to the end,1481241600,,129,4.416666666666667
3144461,4,B0015FWKE8,Good Movie worth the time.,1481241600,,26,4.4
3144462,4,B0015FWKE8,"Rarely seen documentary of the relief of the Bergen-Belsen Nazi concentration camp by a British medical team.  Portrays the heartless horror of the German effort of mass extinction of Jews and others along with the arrogance of the German commanding officer as well as the unfeeling German guards.
We need  reminders now and then of what is possible in the hands of a zealot madman and his ability to control his people as a mob.  The effort of the british in the overrunning of this camp and attempting to save the remaining prisoners were very understandably difficult.  The image of the German commandant casually drinking his wine while prisoners were dying daily was disgustingly typical of some of the old elite Prussian military officer clique.  If I were there, I would have shot the bastard as he raised the glass to his lips.
Yes, I carry a grudge. I lived in Germany through the beginnings of the pogroms.  Many relatives were killed by them.though I escaped..",1480982400,,971,4.819277108433735
3144463,5,B0015FWKE8,"Absolutely unbelievable that humans, if you can call the Nazis that, could do this to other humans. I am well read on most wars, and always like to read about an angle I did NOT know about.....this movie was one of those. Bless those people for trying SO hard to save the people of Belsen.  Well done.",1480723200,,301,4.280701754385965
3144464,3,B0015FWKE8,A well done sorry of the relief of the Belsen Concentration camp.  The movie should be watched by anyone who wants to know what was found and how the camp prisoners were saved.,1480636800,,176,4.333333333333333
3144465,3,B0015FWKE8,Camera work is poor and at times annoying to watch,1480636800,,50,4.1
3144466,4,B0015FWKE8,"A fascinating look at the problems the British faced when liberating Belsen.  Limited resources, uncaring Nazi guards and rampant disease were just a few of the problems.  Meanwhile watching inmates die under their care made solutions urgent.",1479859200,,242,5.513513513513513

3144471,5,B0015FWKE8,Any one who can say this never happened is a fool and a liar. I have family who fought in WW2 and WW1 the atrocity's that man can do to another are proven criminal I don't know how some could be able to sleep at night. After witnessing this. The diet of the work camps were designed to starve some one while the Germans worked them to death the more suffering the better was their idea. What most Americans don't know were the famous American family who profited from all this suffering and who in part helped designed the death camps was Prescott Bush the same family involved in the Death of JFK yes the Bush family Bush Sr. IBM made the counting machines to number and count all the People heading for the ovens so we in America can say we never knew well most of us never knew but their were some working for IBM they knew some even traveled to Germany to run the counting machines. The White House knew but not many knew to what extent the killing was being done. I only wish we as humans could of done more faster.  Their are some who plan to do this again the NWO,1478995200,,1070,4.169082125603865

3144481,3,B0015FWKE8,This is not a picture based in fictitious horrors. This was a reality and I.just didn't have the nerve to continue watching. Based on WW2 .The combination with documentary segments let's the viewer know events that happened.,1476662400,,224,5.081081081081081

3144485,5,B0015FWKE8,"An important story we should all see.  Actual news footage makes it real, as does showing the actual characters and brief bios at the end. It brings to light that the suffering and dying did not end with liberation of the death camps.",1476144000,,234,4.441860465116279

3144491,3,B0015FWKE8,This is a docudrama based on the events of occupation of Belsen concentration camp by the British at the end of the 2nd World War.  Very informative.  Actual photos and film of the occupation are woven into the fabric of the story. I found it moving at times and very informative.,1474934400,,280,4.470588235294118
3144492,3,B0015FWKE8,Have never read anything about this happening. A piece of history almost lost. Movie hard to watch.,1474848000,,99,4.882352941176471
3144493,5,B0015FWKE8,Everybody should see this movie and understand what the war against Germany was all about and never forget.  With some of the original footage of Belsen it was depressing and heart rendering to watch.,1474848000,,200,4.882352941176471

3144505,3,B0015FWKE8,"The re-enactment details were very impressive. The only reason I cannot give this video 5 stars is due to the filming technique. In an effort to make it appear as if you are witnessing in the first person the camera switching from actor to actor is dizzyingly annoying. Annoying to the point where I felt like I was the one having seizures and not the cameraman.
Interesting video to watch and worth the time. Just make sure you ride a rollercoaster first or have plenty of antiemetics on hand.",1473724800,,494,4.561797752808989

3144513,5,B0015FWKE8,Shocking! A horrible story that has not been told often. Even more poignant because my wife's aunt was one who died weeks after liberation from typhus.,1473379200,,151,4.846153846153846
3144514,3,B0015FWKE8,"The story that the movie introduced regarding the typhus epidemic at the Bergen Belsen concentration camp was interesting, informative, sad, horrifying, encouraging.  I found, however, the narrator of the documentary left a lot to be desired.  It was hard to follow at times due to the way he covered it.  It's definitely a documentary worth watching, though.  It brings to light another aspect of the horror of the treatment of human beings under Nazi rule.  It also shows the beauty of compassion the Brits exemplified toward those very same human beings.",1473292800,,557,5.076923076923077
3144515,5,B0015FWKE8,"Without voyeurism, without sentimentality, with straight forward facts and truth, this is the incredible story of the British army, soldiers and officers, who liberated Belsen and who fought to keep the remaining 40,000 starved, sick, terrorized prisoners, most of them women, alive.  Belsen is where Anne Frank died, supposedly of typhus, which was raging in the camp when the Brits arrived.  You don't need actors playing starved terrorized prisoners to make a haunting, painful, terrifying movie about the camps.  The producers didn't do that, thank God.  They just used black and white 1945 British army footage intercut with the actors playing the British.... and it was brilliantly done.  An unforgetable film.  An incredible story never told like this before.  Share it with everyone you know who knows this could happen ANYWHERE if we do not stay vigilant, always.",1473292800,,872,5.27536231884058

3144517,4,B0015FWKE8,"There were many things I didn't understand about the way things were done,however all I can think was the utter shock and horror at what they were faced with may answer the questions as to why the germans remained in barracks and at liberty when they first arrived ,and why the Nazi parphenalia wasn't immediatly torn down. I think it was an incrediable undertaking to make this movie .To undertake to study and daily deal with how to portray this for months at least and I am sure for years for some of them,they shall be praised in history and by me now. It is about all I can take to see it these 60 some years later, those who lived it and were able to work through it need to be remembered they are the best of humanity",1473206400,,724,4.215827338129497

3144520,3,B0015FWKE8,This is the first documentary I've watched about the medical crises that allies had to deal with when the camps were liberated. I think we all thought it was a happy ending when they marched in and freed the prisoners..but that is NOT the case. I gave it a three because I don't know all the facts but I'll sure look into it more because of this documentary. Maybe I gave it a three because I didn't feel the medics took it seriously enough and people were dying still!,1472947200,,469,4.280898876404494

3144529,4,B0015FWKE8,"Another little-known aspect of WWII is well told here. Just because a concentration camp is freed doesn't mean the dying ceases. This video shows the horror (in modest amounts), the irony (German/SS allowed to openly work, function, consume wine while the Brits try to save the dying) and the aftermath (what happened to the characters after the war). It is a bit too fast paced. The bouncy camera angles angles and spooky lighting, you can adjust. What's hard is hearing some of the dialogue, understanding the euphemisms (like for sanitary napkins and sex). Too much happens simultaneously that you lose track. All that said, it was an intense, worthwhile investment in a part of inhumanity/recapturing of humanity that are lost in today's easy political blustering.",1472428800,,768,5.152

3144536,4,B0015FWKE8,"Absolutely incredible account of one of the LEAST publicized relief efforts of WWII.  Shocking, grisly images!  **SPOILER**Enormous odds overcome by the British to save thousands of Jewish and other European prisoners at the Belsen DEATH CAMP.  The Germans called it a prisoner camp; it was a hell hole where prisoners were routinely murdered by the Nazis and tens of thousands died of starvation, torture and other forms of brutality.  The docudrama is based on written accounts by the British doctors, nurses and soldiers who worked relentlessly for weeks to save the prisoners who were dying at the rate of hundreds a day (and for a short period of time thousands a day).  The film intersperses actual footage of the dead and living prisoners and British care givers, which adds to the sense of desperation felt by the rescuers -- and, of course, the prisoners themselves.  I've watched more than a hundred documentaries about Hitler's Final Solution but never before heard such shocking and dreadful details of the Belsen camp.  I also never had known that any Allied relief effort of Nazi death and concentration camps had been done while German officers and soldiers were allowed (for at least several days) to remain in charge of the camp and continue killing prisoners.  Don't expect to see an all-star cast with high quality filming and acting.  IMO, that would have detracted from the impact and the importance of this production.",1471219200,,1440,5.016806722689076

COMMENT:  THE SUBJECT MATTER WAS HANDLED VERY WELL CONSIDERING HOW HORRIBLY THE NAZI'S TREATED THE JEWS AND ALL THOSE WHO WOULD STAND IN THEIR WAY. THE NAZI'S HEADED BY THE SS  WERE THE VERY EPITOMY OF EVIL WHICH HAD TO BE VANQUISHED.

3144705,5,B0015FWKE8,"When I was fifteen years old my mother gave me a copy of Leon Uris' recently published EXODUS.  Although we were (are) ""Gentiles"", my parents thought it was important that their children learn about the Holocaust.  EXODUS was my introduction.
I had Jewish friends and in my innocence, I questioned them about ""what had happened"".
Shocked, I learned that almost all of them had had relatives who had been in concentration camps during the war.
Most had lost relatives.
Perhaps because of my Jewish friends and the realization that people I actually personally knew had been touched by it, I began a lifelong interest.
I always felt the typical sense of relief that came with knowing that the camps were finally liberated....my father's best friend had been in Germany with George Patton when some of the first camps were discovered......and in my naivete assumed that tra-la!  The war ended and the inmates marched triumphantly back home!
Having read about the bureaucratic quagmire that bogged down rescue attempts of the inmates, I was not totally unprepared for the premise of THE RELIEF OF BELSEN.  However, this docu drama with its superb cast and writing brings home all the various forms of opposition that those who were trying to save thousands of desperately sick and damaged patients were faced with.
I cannot recommend it more highly for anyone who cares about that indescribable period in world history when, as has been said, ""Satan ruled the earth"".",1446508800,22,1463,4.983606557377049

And, you will wonder how those involved in the incarceration could even willingly treat people with such disdain and cruelty.  There were so many camps and the accounts made by survivors and liberators will make you weep for mankind.  This also shows how much in denial the rest of the world was as to what was going on in thee camps.  The disorganization in being able to liberate and care for thousands as hundreds were perishing daily from typhus really is unimaginable.  And, as mankind never learns these types of inhumanities are going on today before our very eyes.  We should all refuse to be complacent in our comfort zones.

Being born in the US shortly after the war I grew up hearing of the concentration camps and the horrors that existed but only a few of the most well known camps were mentioned. Belsen was a completely new name for me. As the last of this great generation passes on, my hope is that films such as this can keep the past from being forgotten or worse, rewritten. Many movies touch on the agony in the camps, this one only touching the incarcerated victims very slightly, but I've not encountered one that looked at the people that were attempting to save the survivors. A touching tale that looks at just a slice of what was going on and the immensity of it all, but more than other films of this era. It doesn't try to overwhelm your senses with special effects but lets your imagination fill in the blanks. Could it have included more detailed information of the camp, the doctors and nurses, the options tried to save the survivors, yes, but to do so would have made the film too long or restricted the different glimpses that were shown.

We need  reminders now and then of what is possible in the hands of a zealot madman and his ability to control his people as a mob.  The effort of the british in the overrunning of this camp and attempting to save the remaining prisoners were very understandably difficult.  The image of the German commandant casually drinking his wine while prisoners were dying daily was disgustingly typical of some of the old elite Prussian military officer clique.

Belsen is where Anne Frank died, supposedly of typhus, which was raging in the camp when the Brits arrived.  You don't need actors playing starved terrorized prisoners to make a haunting, painful, terrifying movie about the camps.  The producers didn't do that, thank God.  They just used black and white 1945 British army footage intercut with the actors playing the British.... and it was brilliantly done.  An unforgetable film.

I think it was an incrediable undertaking to make this movie .To undertake to study and daily deal with how to portray this for months at least and I am sure for years for some of them,they shall be praised in history and by me now.

This video shows the horror (in modest amounts), the irony (German/SS allowed to openly work, function, consume wine while the Brits try to save the dying) and the aftermath (what happened to the characters after the war). It is a bit too fast paced. The bouncy camera angles angles and spooky lighting, you can adjust. What's hard is hearing some of the dialogue, understanding the euphemisms (like for sanitary napkins and sex). Too much happens simultaneously that you lose track.

Shocking, grisly images!  **SPOILER**Enormous odds overcome by the British to save thousands of Jewish and other European prisoners at the Belsen DEATH CAMP.  The Germans called it a prisoner camp; it was a hell hole where prisoners were routinely murdered by the Nazis and tens of thousands died of starvation, torture and other forms of brutality.  The docudrama is based on written accounts by the British doctors, nurses and soldiers who worked relentlessly for weeks to save the prisoners who were dying at the rate of hundreds a day (and for a short period of time thousands a day).  The film intersperses actual footage of the dead and living prisoners and British care givers, which adds to the sense of desperation felt by the rescuers -- and, of course, the prisoners themselves.  I've watched more than a hundred documentaries about Hitler's Final Solution but never before heard such shocking and dreadful details of the Belsen camp.  I also never had known that any Allied relief effort of Nazi death and concentration camps had been done while German officers and soldiers were allowed (for at least several days) to remain in charge of the camp and continue killing prisoners.  Don't expect to see an all-star cast with high quality filming and acting.  IMO, that would have detracted from the impact and the importance of this production.",1471219200,,1440,5.016806722689076

Starring Iain Glen, this award-winning movie recalls the actual events that transpired at Belsen as the British fought typhus, starvation and their own humanity. .

COMMENT:  THE SUBJECT MATTER WAS HANDLED VERY WELL CONSIDERING HOW HORRIBLY THE NAZI'S TREATED THE JEWS AND ALL THOSE WHO WOULD STAND IN THEIR WAY. THE NAZI'S HEADED BY THE SS  WERE THE VERY EPITOMY OF EVIL WHICH HAD TO BE VANQUISHED. I COMMEND THE PRODUCERS AND DIRECTORS WHO CHOSE THE ACTORS WHO PORTRAYED THE DR'S AND NURSES DEDICATED TO SAVING THE LIVES OF THOSE  POOR  EMACIATED HUMAN BEINGS.  WELL DONE.

3379194,5,B0015FWKE8,"This was a very eye opening account on what went on behind the relief efforts of Belsen.  I was shocked what really happened including why the German's were allowed to leave who oversaw the camp.  I was amazed how just a handful of people took on the daunting task to try to save as many survivors with limited resources.  Overall, this is one on the best docudramas I have ever seen.",1447977600,2,384,4.380281690140845

3379198,3,B0015FWKE8,I thought it was a good look at the problems the Allies faced as they liberated the concentration camps at the end of the war. The portrayal of the frustrations encountered in trying to help starving people on the edge of death were very well done. I feel like it may have actually been worse than was depicted in the film but we should all watch and learn so that it never happens again.,1447027200,,388,4.256756756756757
3379199,5,B0015FWKE8,This is a well done film about a lesser known WWII concentration camp called Belsen.  It's a story that needed to be told.  It's presented from the point of view and stories of the men and women who were there to help and to survive.  The film contains a lot of real life footage that was taken at the camp after it was discovered by the allied troops.  Highly recommended.,1447027200,2,373,4.285714285714286

3379202,5,B0015FWKE8,"When I was fifteen years old my mother gave me a copy of Leon Uris' recently published EXODUS.  Although we were (are) ""Gentiles"", my parents thought it was important that their children learn about the Holocaust.  EXODUS was my introduction.
I had Jewish friends and in my innocence, I questioned them about ""what had happened"".
Shocked, I learned that almost all of them had had relatives who had been in concentration camps during the war.
Most had lost relatives.
Perhaps because of my Jewish friends and the realization that people I actually personally knew had been touched by it, I began a lifelong interest.
I always felt the typical sense of relief that came with knowing that the camps were finally liberated....my father's best friend had been in Germany with George Patton when some of the first camps were discovered......and in my naivete assumed that tra-la!  The war ended and the inmates marched triumphantly back home!
Having read about the bureaucratic quagmire that bogged down rescue attempts of the inmates, I was not totally unprepared for the premise of THE RELIEF OF BELSEN.  However, this docu drama with its superb cast and writing brings home all the various forms of opposition that those who were trying to save thousands of desperately sick and damaged patients were faced with.
I cannot recommend it more highly for anyone who cares about that indescribable period in world history when, as has been said, ""Satan ruled the earth"".",1446508800,22,1463,4.983606557377049
3379203,5,B0015FWKE8,"This is not for viewing pleasure.  It is to show the horrors of war and the barbaric inhumane treatment of inmates at Belsen.  Your heart will break for the victims.  And, you will wonder how those involved in the incarceration could even willingly treat people with such disdain and cruelty.  There were so many camps and the accounts made by survivors and liberators will make you weep for mankind.  This also shows how much in denial the rest of the world was as to what was going on in thee camps.  The disorganization in being able to liberate and care for thousands as hundreds were perishing daily from typhus really is unimaginable.  And, as mankind never learns these types of inhumanities are going on today before our very eyes.  We should all refuse to be complacent in our comfort zones.  None of us are immune.",1446508800,5,824,4.627586206896551
3379204,4,B0015FWKE8,"I have never reviewed a movie before but something compelled me to do so now. Being born in the US shortly after the war I grew up hearing of the concentration camps and the horrors that existed but only a few of the most well known camps were mentioned. Belsen was a completely new name for me. As the last of this great generation passes on, my hope is that films such as this can keep the past from being forgotten or worse, rewritten. Many movies touch on the agony in the camps, this one only touching the incarcerated victims very slightly, but I've not encountered one that looked at the people that were attempting to save the survivors. A touching tale that looks at just a slice of what was going on and the immensity of it all, but more than other films of this era. It doesn't try to overwhelm your senses with special effects but lets your imagination fill in the blanks. Could it have included more detailed information of the camp, the doctors and nurses, the options tried to save the survivors, yes, but to do so would have made the film too long or restricted the different glimpses that were shown. This is a film that leaves you thinking of the mental anguish that existed long after this point in time.",1446508800,5,1223,4.415929203539823

It was the most thought provoking presentation about the liberation of the concentration camps that I have ever seen.  Well done.
