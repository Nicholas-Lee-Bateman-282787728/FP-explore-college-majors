There are many reasons why I love this movie and among these are the great supporting cast like Will Geer and Julie Adams. It's a bit unfortunate that this picture's title can be confused with the Bette Davis picture ""Dark Victory,"" but after you watch this movie, you'll see why the title fits the story so well.

I wish someone like TCM would issue this fine movie on DVD along with some other favorites like ""The Farmer's Daughter"" with Loretta Young. Hopefully the powers that be have future plans to do just that.",1445126400,3,742,4.66412213740458
8685154,5,B00OWA2GKQ,"This is a very good movie that deals with a subject that should have been dealt with in another movie; ""The Pride of the Marines"" with John Garfield. Actually It deals with two subjects, the second an off shoot of the first. Well acted with a very good story line. If you haven't seen it do so.",1419638400,,294,4.175438596491228
