1690354,1,B000063K45,It's been a long time since I've seen a piece of dung as bad as this stinker.  The 2 love interests of the main character couldn't act their way out of a paper bag.  It was an extremely painful 90 minutes.  No redeeming qualities.  Ripping my toenails off with a pair of pliers would have been more enjoyable.,1022025600,6,309,4.275862068965517

1690357,5,B000063K45,If you are a flyfisherman this is the movie for you! These folks take you to some the greatest locations and show some of the greatest footage of this great sport that we love so much. It's not just a video it's an experience!

If you show me big fish being caught on fly, in exotic locales using fine cinematographic skills, and don't obviously and repeatedly plug your main sponsor, I'm going to give you a thumbs up. So I'll come right out and say it - Drift (produced by Confluence Films) does it all right, and gets a thumbs up, five stars, or a 10 out of 10 (whichever you prefer). Quite simply, the movie rocked! If you are about to travel/fish and need a primer while sitting on the plane that will assuredly have you bouncing off cabin walls, this movie is it. But I'll warn you, practice casting in a mid-flight Boeing is against FAA regulations.

I'm making this quick, because the DVD is a must have and I don't want to be the spoiler...

The movie starts off at the Deschutes with spey casting to steelhead. ""Fish beautiful water well"" is the takeaway for steelie success. It moves on to Turneffe Flats and Punta Gorda, with exposes on permit and the Garbutt brothers. Winter follows, with a tour of one of my favorites, the Green River A-section, and then on to the Frying Pan and the Bighorn. Weather then subsides with a trip to Andros Island - you'll hear some of Charlie Smith's banjo playing, and a few reels singing to the sounds of bonefish. And for the finale, the crew travels to Kashmir, finding fat rainbows, professional `netters' and a whole lotta paperwork.

It should come as no surprise to sports/action film buffs that Drift is a high quality production - the team that created it is top notch. Writer Tom Bie is the publisher and editor of The Drake magazine, one of the finest grassroots publications anywhere for the fly fishing enthusiast. Producer Jim Klug is another veteran of the fly fishing world - and `world' indeed...he's the founder of Yellow Dog Flyfishing Adventures, which puts fish in the freezer by organizing fly fishing trips from Costa Rica to Kamchatka and beyond. And last but certainly not least, there's director Chris Patterson - if you find yourself feeling like you are watching the aquatic version of a Warren Miller snow flick, that's because Chris spent 16 years working as a director/cinematographer for the famed ski movie magnate.

By ELIZABETH LADEN

""Drift"" is the best fly fishing documentary I have ever seen, and I watch many. I love to fly fish, and enjoy viewing films about the sport just for the eye candy of a perfect cast, a drift boat's oar slicing the stream's surface without a splash, the fish ripping through the water after it's been hooked and slinking away, alive for another time, after the release. I love to watch a good angler tie on a fly he knows will work, and I love the scenery. Fly fishing waters are always in beautiful, interesting places, with mountains, wildflowers, birds, and wildlife to soak up when the fish aren't active.

""Drift"" has all these images, filmed and edited with perfect rhythm -- a delicious, coffee table book of a film. Fast motion getting to the water -- don't we all do that? Slow motion when there's something wonderful happening that we never want to end. Black and white at times in India when a world besieged by conflict seems off color and even frightening.

""Drift"" has no chatter about fishing techniques, hatch-matching, and gear to interfere with the enjoyment of its images. Don't you hate the canned electronic music that so many outdoor films use? I do, and watch them with the sound off. ""Drift's"" soundtrack sports the acoustical folk music of the places where it is filmed, with just a small but appropriate burst of jazz in one segment.

My favorite -- Bonefish Charlie, owner of the Bang Bang Club in the Bahamas and a world renowned guide, entertains us with folk tunes sung with his bluesy, raspy voice accompanied by his twangy banjo. I want to wake up there tomorrow!",1227571200,9,3797,4.6906906906906904

It's boring enough that my partner and I actually were talking back to the characters in order to keep our interest up.  There are parts, however, that really make you feel for the characters.  They are way too depressed though and it drags this movie down.  All the repeating of scenes is also pretty strange and waste of probably a third of the movie.",1178064000,,480,4.6
1690361,4,B000063K45,"I started out watching this film not really impressed at all. I was in fact tempted to shut it off, but I paid for the thing so I was determined to watch it. I'm glad I did. The synopsis of the film is a young gay couple approaching their third anniversary, one still madly in love and the other very confused. Ryan decides to break up with his mate Joel, and explore a  relationship with a new friend with whom he shares a lot of things in common. He is in search of someone to share the little magical world that exists only in his mind. But will his new friend feel the same way he does, or will their own little worlds collide? At that moment this was a mediocre film, but then something magical happens. The scenario plays out as if you are watching the end of the movie. All of sudden, as you expect the story to end, the film starts over at the moment Ryan moves out of Joels apartment, and begins going in a totally different direction from what you just seen. I was thinking: ""ok, that was a fantasy, now we're seeing what really happens"". As it plays out however, it all goes back once again to Ryan leaving Joels apartment and yet another scenario begins to play out as Ryan drifts in thought to explore several fantsies trying to find one that would best explain his real dream in life. As you watch this film, you will surely find one ending you like. All in all, the only thing he discovers is that in any scenario, his lover Joel is steadfast and loves him unconditionally. This is an indie of course so the quality could have been better, but all in all, even on the VHS copy I have, it wasn't too horrible. I would recommend it on DVD however for best picture and sound quality. The casting was great and the acting was superb. I was quite impressed once the whole production began to take off. Don't get in a hurry to shut it off and discount it as a failure. It really does make a strong point and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. I will want to see this again and again now that I have some sense of what is going on. Ryan's little world is a really twisted place with a lot of darkness in it. Way too much darkness for me personally, but in the end, it is as if this adult man is finally coming of age so to speak after he has already experienced life. If you give it a chance, you will get something out of this film. I recommend it, but at first I already had my review in mind for only one star. A slow start, but a nice save by Canadian filmmaker Quentin Lee. Two thumbs up in surprise!",1160870400,2,2512,4.158110882956879

Poor filmography.

1690375,1,B000063K45,"Usually, I am a big fan of Indie films. I'm not attracted to most of the cinematic drivel that mainstream film companies produce. But... this was one of the worst Indie films I've ever watched. Unfortunately, being a diehard Indie fan, I bought it rather than renting it. Anyone want to buy a copy? Cheap?

Technically, it would rate about three stars, but the characters are two dimensional and exceptionally boring. The central character, Ryan, is so pretentious (no one understands him on a ""visceral"" level) that I hated him after the first five minutes. Seldom am I moved to actually hate a film's characters. Maybe that was the director's intention, and if it had been only that character and you could sympathize with the others, it would have been a good thing. However, it doesn't work out that way.

The new love interest, while not inspiring the same degree of loathing, is a pretentious novel-writing effeminate virgin. The very much put upon boyfriend, Joel, acts as though he has no depth of emotion beyond superficial fretting that Ryan is going to break up with him after three years together.

The two supposedly straight supporting characters are also shallow and vapid as a flat beer - Ryan's guy friend does little more than talk about his high school girlfriend that got away and lift weights. In what might have been the film's best moments, Ryan asks him if he would sleep with him and cuddle and mess around and the straight friend says of course he would if it would make him feel better and says that that's love of a kind, isn't it? Ryan responds in the fashion we have come to expect by that point - with about as much emotional depth as an eggplant (my apologies to the veggie kingdom) - and the film's one actual moment of emotion is over.

Indie films about gay characters have advanced tremendously in their ability to portray them as just average people with average problems. This one doesn't. It's hard to put your finger on, but maybe it's the fact that not one of these people is someone you'd really like to know once you've met them. I don't know what the director's intention was, but if he set out to portray his gay characters as shallow and unlikeable, he succeeded admirably.

Don't bother with this one, folks. If you must watch it, rent it. If I can't find any takers for my copy, I'm going to use it as a coaster.

I only gave it one star because I couldn't give it a zero.",1123977600,4,2420,4.551724137931035

Disjointed and uninteresting are understatements.  I had trouble getting through it and felt unsatisfied at the end.  It should have been named ""Immaturity In Action.""

1690384,1,B000063K45,"Ryan, a twenty-something aspiring screenwriter is in a rather complacent long-term relationship with Joel. They share a bed and an apartment, but not much else. When Ryan meets Leo, a young college student, at a party, they feel an immediate spark in many shared common interests. Just before his anniversary with Joel, Ryan impulsively leaves his lover of three years for a chance at true love with Leo. And then, we back up and Ryan decides to stay with Joel and work through their problems. Then we back up again and see things from yet another perspective.
The concept of the movie is that we get to see Ryan choices, and the consequences of those decisions, played out before our eyes. The reality is you don?t really care what happens the first time, let alone the second or third time around.
In the extremely poorly filmed commentary, Quentin Lee, the director, reveals that he never originally intended to turn his screenplay based on a very personal experience into a movie. Then, it seems he received a grant to make the screenplay into a film and he just couldn't resist the opportunity. Good for him, unfortunate for the rest of us. The film's premise has promise, but the movie itself just never lives up to it. Poorly filmed, poorly edited, and poorly acted, it feels more like a student film than something that was made to be distributed. Don't bother. Not Recommended.",1051574400,4,1386,4.755186721991701

I'd like to make an open plea to all directors, writers and producers - PLEASE, somebody make a gay film with characters that are not totally emotionally retarded.  I mean, Drift features pre-pubescent angst the likes of which no weepy high school short story has ever known.  It rambles on endlessly mired in the nobody-understands-me-can't-my-soul-be-free theme until the viewer tunes out from either frustration or sheer boredom.
I have to admit, I didn't see the end.  Halfway through the film I turned to my partner and stated that if I heard the word ""visceral"" one more time I was turning off the DVD.  Not 45 seconds later, one whiny character or another vomited the aforementioned word and I decided to watch something more realistic, like Friends.  Indie films don't have the luxuries that big studio pictures have.  They can't throw in spaceships or cars exploding to divert attention from a substandard script.

At times the movie is incredibly thoughtful and moving, and sometimes it's laugh out loud funny - but in a subtle way. Other times it's downright sad and ultimately left me feeling depressed (not a bad thing). The film is basically about the choices that we make along the way, and how those choices affect those around us, as well as ourselves. It's not a new concept, surely, but it's handled here in a fresh and clever way. Even the ultra-low budget feel of the piece works in it's favor in creating a very REAL atmosphere. Most of the acting (with the exception of one actor) is pretty amazing for a low budget indie. I especially connected to the actor playing the part of the jilted boyfriend Joel. He's both funny and moving at the same time. I also enjoyed the work of the two best friend characters - Matt and Carrie, who happen to be straight (a clever twist on the usual movie stereotype where the plucky best friend if often gay). Though the themes of this movie are certainly universal, I think that it would probably only appeal to those interested in gay and/or indie films.",1034985600,11,1251,4.443478260869565

I found myself falling in the really LOVE it camp because I find that I've kept thinking about it days after my boyfriend and I actually sat down to watch it. Sure the dialogue is too cerebral at times, but the cool ""Reality TV"" feel of the piece more than makes up for it. All the actors embody their characters with such conviction that I never once thought that I was even watching actors. It makes the veiwer feel like a total voyeur, which I really liked.
If you're gonna compare this film to big budget gay fluff like ""The Birdcage"" then do yourself a favor and skip this one. But if you like experimental work with a real point of view and a voice, then I recommend it!",1034899200,7,830,4.326923076923077

Otherwise, dialogue was quite realistic, and the storyline was believable, albeit a bit abrupt at the first ""branch."" With a mostly unexperienced cast, this film is indie at its most -- dare I say -- visceral? Acting is somewhere between ""cheesy porn"" and ""good B-movie,"" but this is not a reflection on the actors' abilities -- only their experience and that of their director. All in all, give Quentin Lee another few years and few films, and expect greatness from him. This is a filmmaker to keep your eye on.

This movie was OK.  It has a ""Sliding Doors"" premise - how will my life be different if I do or don't make the choice to end my relationship?  The premise is interesting, and given a small budget, the film is passable.
The acting, aside from brief and rare moments of talent, is as wooden as I've ever seen.  I'd have given my eye teeth for a decent drama queen to say or do something that showed some emotion or feeling behind the dialogue.  Speaking of dialogue - it seemed to be forcing itself to some sort of gay intellectualism - but by re-using the words 'visceral connection' about 10 times (and not during the 'repeated' scenes) it came across as monotonous and boring.
I applaud anyone who has the ability to get an indie film made, and this one wasn't necessarily BAD, but I don't think it offered any new perspectives or thoughts on the issue of relationships or compatibility, it just rehashed old ones in a completely unemotional way.

Racism is a very real force in the gay world and gay asian men in particular seem to support the notion that happiness and sexual pleasure is only found amongst white men.

The protagonist, Ryan, meets potential soulmate Leo at a party one evening. The hurdle? Ryan's boyfriend Joel, who together are approaching their third anniversary. Ryan is then forced to stand on a very narrow ledge, to make a terribly difficult decision: what to do about this new, intriguing ingredient thrown into his life. The rest of the movie plays out the different scenarios, each one coming to a surprise ending, of sorts.
What marvels in this movie are two aspects. First, the acting is superb. It is so understated, that you really do believe Quentin Lee set cameras up in people's homes, left, and just filmed reality. All of the actor's inhabit their roles realitisically, especially Leo, played by Jonathon Roessler, who's role as ""the other man"" is so subtle you don't mind him getting involved with Ryan. Secondly, the script and story treat each scenario with respect and reverence. There is no cheap humor, or overdrought drama. Each scene is played with the correct tension, making for pleasant, intrguing viewing.
One flaw I found involved the use of the camera. I noticed from the beginning that camera seemed to be uncomfortably close to the actors. Throughout the movie, we see an unusual amount of close ups, and one shots. While it may have been the director's decision to isolate characters on the screen to emphasize their individuality, or possibly true aloneness in this world, I found it becoming distracting. Some of the scenes would have been better served with the camera farther away, to allow distance between us and the characters.
At any rate, I did enjoy Drift. Quentin Lee has made a wonderful contribution to gay cinema by writing a script and directing a movie that avoids the usual stereotypes, and casting a wonderful cast of actors that pulled off his vision commendably!",1029974400,5,2038,5.014749262536873

Ryan who has been in a relationship with Joel for three years and is very much in love with him one night meets Leo at a party. And his preception of what his life is supposed to be changes.

It's very low budget and there is absolutely no Hollywood glitz or glamour here, just raw emotion.

The boyfriend (played by Greyson Dayne) is completely sweet and naturalistic and the college kid (played by Johnathon Roessler) is hilarious. The entire cast, for that matter is great, especially the coffee shop owner (with a couple of the best lines in the film).

I can't remember the last time that I watched a movie that had as much of an emotional impact as this movie. It is partly because I felt completely connected and understanding of every senario. That made me realize that this movie would touch many others in the same way. The power of some of the most simple words (Passion always dies, but I live for passion) and scenes such as R.T. Lee's crying scene when he is packing his bags to leave are nothing short of brillant. Personal experiences always translate beautifully into film (as it does for director Quentin Lee). It shows that he is in touch with true human emotion. R.T. Lee's crying scene showed the reality of a ""necessary"" breakup...pain. From every angle and for both involved a breakup is painful no matter who intiates the process. I can't say that I have ever taken the time to write to about a movie, but this deserves a response. Although it is a gay movie, the emotions are applicable to any relationship where choices about that realtionship have to be made. Get past the blant performances of the supporting cast and focus on the script by director Quentin Lee and the powerful, emotional and real performance of R.T.

The documentary feel of this film is especially compelling, almost making the viewer feel as though they're peeping in a window they shouldn't be.
The cast is amazing and their work is so natural that you almost have to wonder if director Quentin Lee just found these people and shot their true story (kind of like a homo-Real World). It's so nice to see actors in a gay film who are smart and sexy without being West Hollywood steroid clones. The chemistry between RT Lee and Greyson Dayne is hot, to say the least - though a little nudity would have been very welcomed.

1690530,2,B000063K45,"""Drift"" is a small scale, intimate, gay relationship film from writer/director Quentin Lee, produced with Canadian funding.
Set in contemporary Los Angeles, ""Drift"" stars R. T. Lee as Ryan, a mid-20s screenwriter/ coffee shop worker.  Ryan is within days of his third anniversary living with Joel (played by Greyson Dayne), a worker in a gay community center.  Having dragged Joel to a cocktail party, Ryan meets Leo (played by Jonathon Roessler), a younger college student who turns out to share Ryan's interest in serial killers and horror movies.  Ryan soon is thinking that, although Joel is comfortable and a good provider, Leo is the one who understands what Ryan is all about and could be his true soulmate.
Ryan decides the honorable thing to do is move out of the apartment until he sorts out what to do.  Luckily Ryan has friends, one a straight man and the other a woman, who volunteer to help him out.  After moving out, Ryan wants to get closer to Leo, and Joel gets to try out his own options.  Leo meanwhile casts an eye on Joel.  Old loves might not be dead loves either.
Ryan realizes he is generating a mess for a lot of people as he drifts along but doesn't have much perspective until he tricks with a character who finds some of the right words.  The movie goes on to its conclusion.
The basic story with its emotional tangles has promise.  The difficulties I had came from the script or from the acting.  The film focuses on Ryan, leaving the other characters less developed.  Why had Ryan and Joel stayed together for so long?  Why would low-income Ryan decide so quickly to leave an apartment he didn't even pay rent on without first having a secure long-term landing spot?  Why would there be no thought to the economic impact on low/mid-income Joel?  Some speeches are deliberately recycled, sometimes to telling effect (especially one asking serially for devirginization; some live life as a script). The viewer can go along with most of the words, although the portrayals of some of the emotions may lack conviction.
I liked the pithy reflections Ryan had on himself as he walked away from his last trick.  He later concludes with a sentiment that the key to happiness was living a life without regret.  The audience will have to weigh this with all the emotional damage done to self and others and with what Ryan's final situation is.",1022284800,9,2363,4.699029126213592

Would highly recommend to the experienced fly fisherman to the person who has never been fishing.  Will watch over and over for years to come.  Actually meet one of the guides in the movie and he was our guide for 2 days in Montana fly fishing.  Did not know he was in the movie when we went but makes this a even more special now.  The beauty of the first part of the movie is simply breath taking.  I am now going to check out other films by Confluence Films.,1296172800,3,546,4.142857142857143
7959311,1,B000063K45,"Don't get me wrong, the content of this DVD is a great film - the photography is stunning and the subject engaging and stimulating.

But on my copy, the 16x9 aspect ratio video was framed as a letterbox on a 4:3 picture - I thought DVDs like this had been dumped years ago, so it was a shock to find all that high quality photography living on an island in a big sea of black.

Sure, I can zoom in the picture on my TV and eliminate the black bars, but the quality drops and the picture now looks similar quality to VHS.

Come on Confluence Films, I expected much, much better. You shot this on 16mm, to get a high quality picture, then you author the DVD to murder the output?",1294963200,5,677,4.113636363636363
7959312,5,B000063K45,"If you are looking for a entertaining video showing fantastic locations, this is it, don't expect to learn any techniques becuase that's not what this video is about. It's about different people fishing different species in different parts of the world. I'm giving it 5 starts becuase it is well shot, entertaining (and just plan relaxing to watch). Don't think I'll ever have the opportunity to fish half the places they show though. Having spent two and a half years in Iraq and Afghanistan I can certainly appreciate the Kashmir fishing trip; don't ever plan on travelling there though. I am very happy with this video and will undoubtably watch it many times over the years.",1285372800,,678,4.853448275862069
7959313,5,B000063K45,"Awesome fly fishing movie!  I've watched it many times already, and will continue to do so.  Can't wait to get ""Rise"", the next movie that these guys made.  I would highly recommends this movie to anyone with a passion for fishing or anything outdoors!",1283126400,,252,4.681818181818182
