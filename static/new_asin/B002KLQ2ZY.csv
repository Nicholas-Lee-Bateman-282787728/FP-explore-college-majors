3942612,5,B002KLQ2ZY,"I really enjoyed this series.  Dhani has the ""great host"" quality to him.  It is very easy for him to bring you into his journey.  I thought that the show would be more about the sports than the culture of the country.  The show has a very good balance of showing the sports, culture, food, and the people of each country Dhani visits.  Don't just write this one off as another sports-junkie show.  Check it out, you'll be surprised at what you find.",1278115200,2,450,4.36144578313253
3942613,5,B002KLQ2ZY,"This series has easily become my favorite show on TV! Dhani's unabashed approach to learning about different cultures is awesome. He is down to try anything, and his competitive fire drives him to want to win at every sport he tries. I am currently enthralled with the 2nd season even more, but the first was absolutely amazing. No other reality TV shows compare,",1277337600,,363,4.777777777777778
3942614,5,B002KLQ2ZY,"This series has a compelling blend of sport and culture, with the sweat and smiles to match. Dhani does a yeoman's job in both exploring the places he visits, as well as competing at the local pastimes which can all be quite dangerous in themselves. Well done and highly recommended!",1271462400,2,283,4.68
3942615,5,B002KLQ2ZY,"I saw these episodes when they premiered on the Travel Channel last Spring and it is such a smart, funny, energetic and educational show.  Dhani is the perfect host to take you on these journeys as he gives you a revealing glimpse into each culture while he trains to compete in that particular countries native sport. He really inspires you to get out and travel and discover something new in each episode of the show and he is really funny and seems truly humbled by his experiences and the people he encounters at each turn.

Each episode has a different feel and mood and that is in large part due to the varied cultures and beliefs held by each country and how they regard their sport at the highest level and Dhani has an amazing respect and thirst for knowledge for each sport he tackles.  I picked up on little things that I missed the first time I saw each episode after watching the DVDs and there are additional scenes as well.  Great buy and highly recommend ""Dhani Tackles the Globe""  I am equally excited for the new season to air April 19th!",1265328000,,1056,4.450777202072539
3942616,5,B002KLQ2ZY,"Dhani Jones really makes this program.  Great personality, sense of humor and a natural in front of the camera.  Locations are interesting with a novel approach to learning about other locations from a sports angle.  Dhani completely throws himself into each cultural experience. I especially got a kick out of the extra challenges he faced, good-naturedly, in the Cambodia episode.  This man has a whole other career waiting for him once he leaves football. I predict we'll be seeing a lot more of him in the future.

Interesting locales, challenges, beautiful photography and a host who feels like a best friend--how can you go wrong?  Highly recommended!!",1262131200,2,658,5.102803738317757
3942617,4,B002KLQ2ZY,"Great show. I really enjoy the production values, but most importantly you can really see that Dhani Jones absolutely loves what he is doing. Whether he is training in the local sport, eating the local cuisine, getting beat up, gasping for air cause he sucks at a sport, or visiting a landmark of cultural significance, he shows a sense of humor along with a but of competitive edge. I also like how he gets drunk in a couple of episodes. Plus as a man, I can take a few fashion cues from Dhani. This guy is pretty stylish. More so than Bourdain and Zimmeran. If Dhani needed to improve on something it would be his voice overs. They need to sound more natural and less scripted. But thats a nitpick. And at $19 for a whole season, you can't beat it. I wish Travel would put out blu rays as I know this show rocks in hidef!!! There's more countries and sports to tackle so I am definitely lookin forward to season 2. If you watch this I'm sure you'll agree.",1261094400,3,957,4.292817679558011

8372100,5,B002KLQ2ZY,"This was a fantastic series, reminded me of MTV's Road Rules in its heyday. Never understood why it didn't go past two seasons. It was great to see another black male traveling the world & experiencing different cultures. Dhani is so cool & charismatic; he easily fit in no matter where he went.",1406505600,,295,4.584905660377358
8372101,5,B002KLQ2ZY,"Meet my expectations, very satisfied. I am waiting for Season 2 so I can purchase that as well. Thank you for the prompt exchange.",1393804800,,130,4.458333333333333
8372102,5,B002KLQ2ZY,"I didn't know about this show while it was on the air, so I purchased the DVD to see how Dhani handled trying many different sports. It's a great example that you don't have to pigeonhole yourself doing only one thing in life. Be willing to branch out, take chances and have a good time doing it.",1390521600,,296,4.2105263157894735
8372103,4,B002KLQ2ZY,"This dvd set is good...but like most things, the book is better. This review could very well be a plug for the book (its that good). The dvd journey is inspiring though. I love to travel to places I've never been, so to see the places Dhani traveled is really cool. Overall the series is good...but the book is better.",1376611200,,318,4.316666666666666
8372104,5,B002KLQ2ZY,I liked the dvd if your into travel and adventure you will love this. I know there was a season 2 I wonder why its not available on dvd. I liked the pace of the shows i wish more travel shows were like this.,1372550400,,207,3.727272727272727
8372105,5,B002KLQ2ZY,"I am sad they cancelled Dhani's show after this first season.  He gave his all when exploring the sports of these foreign countries and he was super funny doing it. Personable, charming and for the ladies.... really nice to look at too LOL.",1346889600,,240,4.5813953488372094
8372106,5,B002KLQ2ZY,I love football! Love the NFL.. and Dhani Jones is the best of both worlds when it comes to traveling the globe and visually describing what the rest of the beautiful planet has to offer. I ran into this show on Netflix and loved it so much I had to buy the season. If you love Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern I think you'll Enjoy this!,1336953600,,338,4.136363636363637
8372107,5,B002KLQ2ZY,"Before Dhani Tackles the Globe, I had NO IDEA who Dhani Jones was. Thank God for the Travel Channel! I watched this show during primetime, and having this on DVD was a must have. I also enjoyed watching it all again. Now if only Amazon would carry Season 2 of Dhani Tackles The Globe. It's awesome so see football player with a brain, a conscience and saying something other than reaping the bling bling. If you have not heard of Dhani Jones, get into him; he's an amazing human being.",1335744000,,485,4.4
