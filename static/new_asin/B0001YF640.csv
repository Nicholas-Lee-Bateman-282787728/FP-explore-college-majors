2043201,5,B0001YF640,"I love her, I love her workout and I feel accomplished after it's done! Very challenging but pretty easy to follow. Music that goes with the moves is very helpful! She is fun but tough! As with all the ""classic"" Firm workouts 1-6, they all are extremely great workouts!",1342137600,,269,4.510204081632653
2043202,5,B0001YF640,"If you are really serious about getting back into shape, the Firm Classic Workout Series is the BEST! This was the first program to use step aerobics and weights with cardio. These tapes (DVDs) have kept me in shape into my mid-40s. I started using them when I graduated from college in the early 90s and nothing has worked better for me!",1332547200,2,338,4.467741935483871
2043203,5,B0001YF640,"I have always rated firm videos much higher than the rest (especially the older tapes/videos).  This is a great head to toe video that's lots of fun.  I love her energy.  Just like other firm videos, you really do see results within 10 days.",1331510400,3,241,4.431818181818182
2043204,5,B0001YF640,this is the first firm workout i bought 16 years ago and i still love it.,1204848000,2,73,3.625
2043205,5,B0001YF640,"I've been doing the Firm for about 20 years. I own or have tried just about every workout they've ever put out.  This volume is still, in my opinion, the all-time BEST overall tape. It KICKS BUTT aerobically AND with weights.  No time is wasted.  It's an hour long and when you finish (IF you finish) you feel like you have worked HARD. I have to admit I haven't done this tape in a while because if I haven't been working out consistently, this one is daunting! That's how good it is. I love Sandahl's presence, the cuing is excellent, and I for one actually prefer the older music and sets.  This tape will work every part of your body and you will feel it.  Highly recommended, especially for Firm devotees. Do not let the old date of this video shy you from it, it's safe and very effective.",1156377600,5,795,4.308724832214765
2043206,5,B0001YF640,"I enjoy this video because it's fun and challenging. Ms Bergman keeps you motivated, especially when she tells you to ""Get tough!"" I highly recommend this tape--do it three or four times a week and you'll have your dream body in no time!",1143072000,6,237,4.534883720930233
8018209,5,B0001YF640,Love it!! great work out I am drench by the time am done working out. Like that you do cardio with the option to use weights. Have lost weight and firmed up.,1446076800,,157,3.9375
8018210,5,B0001YF640,"This workout is KILLER!! Great cardio and weights! The first 3 original FIRM tapes,  this one, the Susan Harris one and Janet Gretsky video are all excellent. I feel so good after these! If you want a challenge and great results, try it!! I promise it'll tone you up and slim you down.",1423612800,2,285,4.377358490566038
8018211,5,B0001YF640,The best exercise video I've ever used! MY FAVE!,1417737600,,48,4.444444444444445
8018212,5,B0001YF640,"This is the most amazing workout I've ever done. All you need is a few weights, a two foot 2x4, and a DVD player. When I started at 46 I weighed 190 and now at 53 I weigh 150 with six pack abs. It truly is a TOTAL BODY workout. I started with two rolls of quarters as my weights and have progressed to using 15lbs at a max weight. I do this workout 3 to 5 times a week along with a two mile walk every day. It's a program I've stuck with and have experienced visiable results. Thank you Susan and the FIRM for a workout  that works.",1374537600,,532,3.8363636363636364
8018213,5,B0001YF640,"I love The Firm workouts! They are intense and very challenging; you can 'grow into' them. I have all of the VHS videos from then 80's and they are just as great now as they were then. If you want a killer body, then The Firm is for you!!!!",1374105600,,240,3.9183673469387754
8018214,5,B0001YF640,Got this tape to replace an old one that my mom and her friend have been using for years. Glad I could find it for her.,1371859200,,119,3.6153846153846154
8018215,3,B0001YF640,I was looking for a different video I bought a group hoping to find the one I wanted and I found it,1369612800,,99,3.5454545454545454
8018216,5,B0001YF640,this 62 minute workout is difficult but doable. I love the beautiful set and the pleasant music. I use my mini-trampoline as my step and I do the jogging aerobics on the trampoline also. The instructor is calm and encouraging. I rotate this workout with other firm workouts. I purchased this used on vhs tape so I paid very little for the workout.,1359849600,,347,4.523809523809524
8018217,5,B0001YF640,"This is the third copy I have purchased of this video, because it works. great workout, don't get tired of it.",1354838400,2,110,4.285714285714286
8018218,5,B0001YF640,"Not as tough as some of the other review claim, but if you've been doing any of the other Firm tapes, you know what to expect and are probably already somewhat conditioned. She keeps you hopping that's for sure though.",1354665600,,218,4.475
