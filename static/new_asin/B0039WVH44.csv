This film shouldn't exist.

Let's go over the plot.  You've got your titular wand-toter who goes on magical adventures with his two chums; a smarty-pants girl and a doofus-yet-loyal boy.  They have a bumbling-yet-wise magical older mentor (played by Roddy Piper, the best part of this film,) and their parents, who are in on the whole thing and fine sending them into eminent danger.  You also have your not-so-nice teacher, and a fat bully.  If none of this seems familiar to you, then you somehow dodged the entire Harry Potter craze and represent the exact demographic this film was aiming for.

It missed.  Let me repeat: there were two people, likely in an Amish community, that this was aimed at AND IT STILL BLOODY MISSED.

How did it manage that?  Well, let me start out by saying that while I am not much of a Potter fan, I can understand why it did well.  The castles, the dragons, the wizards and witches and ghosts and owls... the whole franchise practically dripped whimsy.  This... welll, you've substituted an awesome magical castle for a modern Canadian suburb, riding on brooms for riding on bikes, Dumbledore's robes for Roddy Piper's hobo outfit, and magical classrooms with, I crap you not, a chalk board hung from a tree. The charm of the 'hidden world' theme, be it Harry Potter or Narnia or The Goonies is the hidden world itself.  It's unique; it's fantastical, it's mysterious. It's everything a Toronto suburb is  not.

Still think you want to watch this fim?  Well, I hope you brought a bailing bucket, because this film has plot holes a'plenty.  See, the film opens with our heroes learning magic.  But then they go to the carnival.  Only they piss off a lady in a gypsy costume, who somehow casts a curse on their teacher despite the fact that she's never seen with him or, for that matter, ever heard from again.  The only way to release him is to insert a gem into a scepter, which will lead them to the Treasure of Loki; an ancient Norse God who for some reason settled down near Toronto.  But that's not all!  We also have an evil teacher and bully kid who are after the treasure, and they can shape-shift for some reason!  See, the treasure, a plot device that will never be resolved, is not really what Billy is after anyway.  He wants his teacher back.  Maybe.  But we need the treasure  to exist because otherwise the bad teacher and bully would have no logical motivation to follow them!  Did I mention the magical ceremony can only be performed at a lighthouse and within three days and only by kids because.... magic??

Perhaps the most atrocious feature of this film is the writing.  While I wouldn't call Rowling the best author ever, she could at least fashion likable, three dimensional characters with believable motivations.  These characters are generally a single character trait that occasionally gets a line  or two.  The lines are interchangeable, really.  Pretty much any character in a scene could swap their lines with any other character, and the story wouldn't be any the worse for it.

Basically, what it comes down to is this.  You're likely looking at this movie because you've seen a review, it said it was bad, and you want to view it for yourself.  Buyer beware.  If The Room or Birdemic were the cinematic  version of a tran wreck, this is the cinematic version of jury duty or the DMV.  It's dull, annoying, and not generally memorable in any way.",1411171200,,3504,4.660130718954249
8392477,1,B0039WVH44,"Here I am again, posting about a Billy Owens movie.  Once again I say... Ugh.  I walked out to finish housework by the half hour mark.  Next thing I know, my kids turn it off and say they are going to bed.  Even THEY couldn't finish it!  That's saying a lot.  Save your money!  Don't let curiosity get the best of you!",1393804800,,318,4.032258064516129
8392478,2,B0039WVH44,"Sometimes B-movie studios want to capitalize on a successful film franchises, and do so by making similar, low budget versions of these films. The DVD release of Snakes On A Plane was accompanied by Snakes On A Train. Every time a Transformers movie comes out, it is joined by a direct-to-video film called Transmorphers. Billy Owens is the B-movie comparison to Harry Potter and as far as the films go, they don't match up very well. In the first Billy Owens film, the budget was very low, the special effects bordered on laughable, and the acting was terrible, but the story was actually really good. As I watched the second film, little has changed. The story was still terrific and would make for a tremendous book series, but the film, just doesn't cut it. In The Secret of The Runes, we see less of the ridiculously bad special effects, but the acting doesn't get much better. The lead, Dalton Mugridge, is really the only actor who shows a marked improvement and does a much better job in the second film than he did in the first. As for the other kids, they are just terrible, and don't get me started on their master wizard, ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper. If this wasn't just a simple companion playing off Harry Potter to get viewers, if someone had actually put some money into these stories, these films would have been really good! The writing is terrific and it's the only reason I had any interest in these films at all. When you take the story, add a bunch of newcomers, and combine them with a former pro-wrestler, and special effects that look like they were made on a Windows '95 PC, the result is a film with a great story that is virtually unwatchable. Maybe if this film were made in the early 80s, when people were used to awful effects and bad acting, it would have been successful, but in the computer age, Billy Owens is sadly obsolete.",1389139200,,1852,4.53134328358209
8392479,5,B0039WVH44,"Be careful when watching this movie.  Watching it is not a move that I would suggest to be honest.  Good movie?  Yes!  Too good?  Yes!  You may ask yourself, ""how can this movie be too good?  It looks bad!""  I will tell you something though, after watching this movie no other movie has been as good.  This movie and a normal life is like Pepsi and Cake, both are good but not together.  This movie will make the rest of your life rank with bitterness, because this movie is so good that everything else will taste like ash compared to how amazing this movie is.  Take care of yourself out there, you will need to because life isn't always about morals or right or wrong, sometimes it is about this movie.  Godspeed.",1387497600,2,716,4.340909090909091
