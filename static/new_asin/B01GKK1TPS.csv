7764076,5,B01GKK1TPS,"Regardless of your fitness level, you will appreciate this DVD!  This is a must have for all.  These workouts are low impact, yet effective & energizing.

I consider myself an advanced level exerciser; however, I had an unexpected procedure done recently & I was restricted from exercising for one month. My doctor finally gave me the green light to start doing yoga and low impact exercises, and this DVD is perfect!  Jessica released her new workouts just in time for me to get back on track.

Don't let the term ""low impact"" fool you, I was sweating during each workout & I was quite sore after the Poise & Grace workout (in a good way).  The Core Control workout is probably my favorite because I love doing standing abs exercises & I felt that my waist was worked from all angles.  I can't wait to start the Phase III calendar of the Walk Strong: Total Transformation program.

Jessica is so creative & I just love her personality as a trainer.  Her workouts are realistic, fun, effective, and time efficient.",1467504000,21,1014,4.620111731843576
7764077,5,B01GKK1TPS,"Ill admit, I often have reached for higher intensity workouts, and heavier weights, because Ive always thought they were what I needed for a good workout.  After completing this workout, its clear that I was wrong.  This DVD is subtle in its sneakiness, and its promise delivers.  Fans of Ellen Barrett, as well as fans of Jessicas Cardio Barre and Total Body Balance will enjoy this DVD.

I began my health and fitness journey, 6 years ago, and 35 pounds heavier.  I first discovered Jessica Smith thru a free DVD out of a Special K cereal box, starting with 10 minutes a day, and graduating to longer, more challenging routines adding each new (and collecting every old) Jessica Smith DVD as I went along.  Through the years, Jessica Smiths routines have never failed to deliver on their promises and through some feat of fitness magic Jessica Smith has YET to create a DVD identical to one before, always delivering on variety and challenge.  This DVD will be a welcome, and regularly implemented addition to my growing (and complete) collection of Jessica Smith workouts.

Build Balance + Inner Strength delivers what it advertises, although I will caution you, the DVD heading Walk Strong is a bit of a misnomer, as there is very minimal walking/marching in place on this DVD and the work is more fusion in nature.  If you're seeking a walking DVD, this is NOT one.  For that, I would recommend one of Jessicas earlier releases, like Walk On: 6 Mile Mix, or the Walk On: 5 Fat Burning Miles DVDs (you will find my reviews to these DVDs also on Amazon)

This DVD includes (3) fusion style sessions on one DVD and arrives, as pictured, in a hard shell case with artwork as pictured.  The combined running time of all three routines (plus introduction) is approximately 90 minutes.  The workouts featured included a variety of options for advanced and intermediate levels (and demonstrated by Jessica) and feature modifications (mainly decreased range of motion and less balancing) from Jessicas Mother Debbie, who has been featured in MANY of Jessicas recent releases.  This DVD, unlike the last few releases, is set within a beautiful home in front of a set of French doors which look out to a beautifully landscaped back yard with a pool.  You will see Peanut in the introduction, although sadly, she is off-screen throughout the workouts (if you look close though, you can see her reflection in the glass of the French doors, where she is doing what she does best.napping.  The music is soft, and does not distract from the on point cuing and bright personality of Jessica.  And believe it or not, we do hear Debbie talking quite a bit during these routines!!!!  Glad I was not the ONLY one feeling the burn as I worked my way thru this DVD.

The three routines are best done barefoot, with a yoga mat, or supportive surface to help cushion the feet.  You will also need a set of light hand weights (2-5 pounds) as well as a medium strength resistance band for two of the routines.  All routines are done standing.
The routines are 30 minutes each and include:

Session 1 Core Control:  A fusion style combination of standing barre work (swan arms, plies, arabesques etc), fused with Pilates and dance.  The routine states its for the core, but there is plenty of arm and leg work to be had in this routine.  This routine requires no equipment and challenges the entire body, by engaging your core strength with balance postures and poses using the arms to create a safe instability, working the muscles of your core (and back) from the inside out without ANY crunches.  LOADS OF VARIETY AND NEW MOVES!

Session 2 Poise and Grace:  This second fusion style routine incorporates a light set of hand weights to sculpt the entire body, while continuing to engage your core muscles to build core strength.  The recommended weight range is 2-5 pounds.  I started light, and am glad I did!  Jessica uses super sets, doing longer sets with multiple repetitions in pairs of two, then the series is repeated.  This routine REALLY WORKS THE SHOULDERS AND UPPER BACK!  Plus with the addition of plie and baby squats, you engage the legs many times while working the upper body at the same time for maximum toning and calorie burn.  Its the sneaky part warned you about earlier in the review.  Ill admit, I had to stop and catch my breath a few times.  Of all the routines, this one made me sweat the most!

Session 3 Balance and Agility: Incorporates the use of a medium strength, flat resistance band.  The routine starts with a few minutes of standing work using the band as a marker on the floor to help build functional agility, and proprioception.  Then its on to MORE WORK for the shoulders, upper back, triceps, and biceps and lets not forget the legs too!!!  This one HURT SO GOOD!  As with the other two routines, the balance and posture is worked with several moves having the option to be done on one leg, or with one toe lightly tapped.

Each routine on this DVD was challenging, which says a lot, as I tend to associate myself at an advanced fitness level, but the routines are great for ALL LEVELS.  This was a surprise from what I expected.  When I was finished I did not feel wasted, and my muscles did not feel overly taxed.  It was just right for me!!!  This DVD will make a welcome addition to any Jessica Smith collectors library, and would be excellent for someone looking to try a low impact, fun, yet challenging routine from Ms. Smith for the first time.",1467331200,169,5473,4.642411642411642
7764108,4,B01GKK1TPS,"Item came quickly and just as described.  I enjoy the setting,  music, trainer, and low impact exercises. I purchased this following hip arthroscopic surgery (Nov 2017) since I feel my balance and core can use some work. Great addition to my daily physical therapy exercises. Jessica explains each movement clearly,  is motivating,  and I LOVE the face that she is working out with her mom. There are 3 different workouts with a countdown clock in the righ-hand corner. You can pick each workout separately or play all 3 in order. I appreciate that Jessica says to listen to your body when doing the exercises as some I cannot do yet. I am so happy with my purchase!",1522800000,5,666,4.666666666666667

7764113,5,B01GKK1TPS,"Jessica Smith knows her stuff for whole body workout. I did workout 2 & 3 (see the Amazon DVD description) and found using light (5 lbs) weights and a band, my arms were fatigued. I went down to 3!!  I am not a beginner, so this is a good fatigued. knowing your body is being challenged and conditioned. Jessica gets it for older women too who want to maintain body health and maintain muscle health. using this DVD as a compliment to cardio & strength training will improve balance, work your core, and maintain muscle strength.",1520208000,2,529,4.510416666666667
7764114,5,B01GKK1TPS,"I really like this dvd.  Three, 30 minute sessions so don't take a lot of time.  I'm really out of shape but these are do-able for me.  Like how she gives options on how to do routines.  I'll buy more of these.",1519689600,2,210,3.9285714285714284
7764115,4,B01GKK1TPS,"Gives a nice workout.  I find some of the moves difficult to do but hopefully I will get better.  I wouldn't recommend this for a beginner but you don't have to be a fitness pro either.  I am over 60 and began an exercise regimen last year, slowly working my way.  I needed more challenge and this dvd definitely gives me that.  I really like that usually the modifier is doing the harder version rather than me having to watch behind to modify though I do try the harder version when possible.  This regimen will require some balance ability which I struggle with so be prepared for that but over all it's a really enjoyable way to get more fit.",1519084800,3,646,4.341666666666667

7764117,5,B01GKK1TPS,"Jessica is really good at combining yoga, pilates and ballet moves to make a fun, gentle workout. Gentle doesn't mean you don't sweat or ""feel the burn"" though! I like that it's not jumping up and down vigorously because in the mornings I prefer yoga or something more gentle like this. There is an intro and three workouts: Core Control, Poise & Grace, Balance & Agility. The first one is nice to get you moving, the second picks up hand weights to go along with the moves and the third uses resistance bands.
Jessica's instruction is good as she does the workout with you and her mom joins her to show a modified workout. There is a timer in the lower right corner to show how long you are working out (and how much time is left).
I'm happy with this DVD.",1518739200,3,757,4.338028169014085
7764148,5,B01GKK1TPS,Jessica Smith is an excellent instructor.  Her mother provides the beginner/senior modifications. I really love this video!,1517270400,,123,6.235294117647059

7764150,5,B01GKK1TPS,"This DVD served all my current needs. I hesitated to purchase it at first because I thought it might be too easy. Ive been working out pretty hard and consistently since my early thirties - Im now 64 years old and feel as though Im more intermediate/advanced in what I can handle. However, because I slacked off with my workouts over the past three years due to a major lifestyle change (we were full-time RVs between 2015 and 2017), I thought it would be best not to think I could go back to intense exercise (LOL). So, I gave this DVD a try. To my surprise, it turned out to be a perfect transition and balance of heart pounding and smooth-move workouts for me. I love that palates and yoga moves are integrated into the three workouts, and that each are a little different (she uses small weights, bands in two of them) but they all provide aerobic, strength and balance moves. She does a great job of explaining and preparing you for each move and Debbie (her mom) provides a less intense option for those that need to start out a little slower. Very happy with my purchase!",1517184000,16,1078,4.422110552763819

Even though there are some basic steps, Jessica makes her workouts fun yet challenging.  She provides modifications for all levels with mom demonstrating the less intense moves.  As a senior, I follow mom and can still get my heart rate up. I enjoy finding new refreshing and inventive instructors.  Jessica is definitely an instructor to follow.

Love the pace and how effortlessly she guides you through the moves. If you are also an Ellen Barrett fan, the exercises will feel familiar but Jessica's sequencing is more dynamic and she has much less repetition.

Great for body strength and muscle which is something aging people lose and need to work on.  with that said, I have osteopenia in my lower back so I do need to strengthen my core.  This is it!!  Some of the moves may be a little too much at the beginning so just modify.  It's only been a few weeks and already I feel a big difference.  ",1501286400,14,669,3.8814814814814813

I wasn't so sure about the fusion style work outs at first as I have zero dance or pilates background but they are growing to be some of my favorites, thanks to this video!  They are ""sneaky workouts"" as she calls them, and they are perfect for the days when I feel like I don't have energy to work out and want to trick myself into it.  :)  I put one of these on and soon, I am sweating and getting a great workout.

7764216,5,B01GKK1TPS,"These are the toughest workouts I've ever done. I am currently in week 2 of Jessica's Walk Strong 2.0 program, and I've never sweated so much or worked so hard. I really feel like I'm making great changes to my body, and each day, I feel a little stronger than the day before.

I started out about 100 pounds overweight. I've been working out daily for the past couple of months, but have seen more positive changes in my body in the past couple of weeks with these DVDs than the rest of the workouts I had been doing. I don't like going to the gym, so the fact that I can do these in the comfort of my own home is huge for me. I enjoy Jessica's positivity and daily mantras. If you plan on doing the entire program, you will need a small playground ball, a 6 foot medium resistance band, an aerobic stepper, a yoga mat, and two sets of handweights, one lighter and one heavier. I use 3 pound and 5 pound weights.

Please do not be fooled by reviews that these workouts are easy or boring. For someone who is very advanced, these may not be enough, but for beginner to intermediate, these will make you work like you never have before.",1494979200,16,1135,4.225806451612903

7764232,5,B01GKK1TPS,"I bought this after a breaking my shoulder and tearing my rotator cuff in a fall off a horse. I hoped it was exercise I could ease into doing as I recovered. The fact that I wouldn't be required to get up and down from the floor like so many other exercise videos -- but still get a little cardio work -- was a big plus. I figured I could use the segment that was only movement (no weight or resistance band) until I felt stronger.

Even though I had to start with doing only half of that segment at a time, due to shoulder pain, it felt great to be moving more freely again! I was happily surprised that it was so emotionally satisfying too. Jessica's method of easing into the next routine by starting with only moving the feet, then adding the arms, then going to a bit more challenging work in some cases, was less intimidating than many routines. It is fluid movement, like dancing, that is emotionally relaxing, even though physically you may work up a bit of sweat! It feels good all over! Having Jessica's mom modeling less challenging ways to do a routine is helpful too.

Now I can do all three sessions for the full time and am building the weight and resistance level I can handle. What I LOVE is that I can really feel that my balance has improved! I can stand on one leg in various positions now even though originally I had to keep a toe on the ground. HORSE RIDERS -- you gotta try this! I wish somebody had told me about this long ago because it has made a huge difference in my ability to continue to rebalance on my horse! Maybe I'll avoid falling next time. :-)

This is still  the video I enjoy the most, even though I use others as well for more strength and more intense cardio work. It's hard to think I will ever quit it because it is rare to find something that is mentally relaxing while physically challenging. So glad it is a regular part of my life now!",1492128000,8,1883,4.236768802228412

I did the first workout yesterday morning and the second workout this morning. The second workout uses hand weights... and I think I'll be feeling this workout tomorrow. Both the first and second workouts were definitely sweat-inducing for me. If I can move tomorrow, I plan to do the third and final workout. I will honestly say that I was cursing out loud during the second workout. I don't have very strong muscles in my shoulders and this workout used them a lot.

My heart rate soared and I could not finish to the end the first time around doing the workouts.
I've become a big fan of Jessica Smith.  I like the variety she gives and the attention to good form. Before working out with Jessica,  I had bought into the Beach Body mystique, I'm a big sucker for their infomercials, and have tried a few of their workout programs.  I think Jessica gives better.

Because of a genetic collagen defect, I have unusually hypermobile joints and flat feet.  This is exactly what I need to strengthen and realign my feet, ankles and knees.  I expect the standing core strengthening and balance exercises will also help advance my karate training.  Jessica has an easy to like personality, and I love that she has her mom as a workout partner.

7764289,5,B01GKK1TPS,"I just love Jessicas fusion workouts.  I feel so graceful and relaxed when I am done.  Even if I don't feel like working out, I pop in a DVD like this one and before I know it I am smiling and moving and having a fun time.

This DVD has 3 different workouts: Core Control, Poise & Grace and Balance & Agility.

Its Jessica and her Mom, Debbie, working out barefoot.

The workouts are:

CORE CONTROL

Mantra: Your inner strength is your outer foundation.
Outfits: pretty purple tops and black bottoms.
Equipment: none.

The theme for this wonderful workout is flowing and circles.  There are lots of relaxing arm circles which just feel so good.

Some of my favorite moves include:  arm circles, plie with alternating side reach, triple toe tap, cross arm chop with plie, side to side step with figure 8 arms and the Pilates moves of thread the needle and standing 100s.

POISE & GRACE

Mantra: Good posture reflects a proper state of mind.
Outfits: blue tops with black bottoms
Equipment: a set of light dumbbells.

This is one of those sneaky workouts, as Jessica likes to say.  You feel so good while doing it; it doesnt feel like a workout. But, by the end, you are sweating.

Some of my favorite moves include: rear lunge with rotating overhead press, balancing upper back row, alternating knee lift with front arm scoop, single leg raise with front arm raise and balancing cross chop.

BALANCE & AGILITY

Mantra: Balance is not something you find, it is something you create.
Outfits: Orange and blue tops with black bottoms.
Equipment: flat resistance band.

Some of my favorite moves include:  plie pulse with band scoop, dead lift with band row, chest fly with leg lift, squats with bicep curls, plie cross chop and the balancing moves at the end.

I love this DVD and I use it often.  If you are looking for some relaxing and flowing workouts that have no dread factor, this DVD is for you!",1485043200,4,1899,4.589285714285714

At 30 minutes they are very easy to fit in to a schedule. Debbie (Jessica's Mom) does the modifications.

Each of these workouts really did stretch me, and I ended up winded and sweaty!  Granted, I am not a heavy duty exercise queen, but I work out daily, even if for a short time and I am in pretty good shape.  This was a nice alternative to my usual cardio walk.  I like that each session was different and had a different focus as I tend to get ""bored"" with my workout DVDs fairly quickly and when I get bored, I end up making excuses not to exercise... This one has enough variety to keep me interested for a while.  I especially liked the second session that almost had a ""mindfulness"" feel to it - a Yoga, pilates, Thai chi kind of thing going on - relaxing, yet invigorating and challenging. Jessica and her mom work well together and are fun to watch - Jessica is encouraging while still being ""genuine"" and I don't get the forced ""cheerful cheerleader"" vibe I do from some other instructors. It can't be easy to encourage folks to do something many of us do not necessarily enjoy, so kudos to her for managing to do so and to do it without repeating the same platitudes like ""excellent"", ""great"", or ""good"" over and over ad nausea.

I really enjoy Bob Harper and Jillian Michaels and if you do, too, this is NOT the DVD for you.  I am 67 and love exercise and like to work up a sweat- this was just not for me.  This is a great introduction for your out-of-shape and or overweight friends or folks with poor balance.  it is TOO much for my 64 year old obese, couch potato brother but would work great for his inactive but non couch potato wife.  Recovering from an illness- a great tape folks in this category who want to start exercising again.  The tape is very well done, just slow.  If you want to work on balance (I have a bosu and a balance ball), this tape would help with that when you are starting out.

I discovered Jessica's walking DVDs with her first (to my knowledge) Walk On series.  I have purchased all but one that followed and I not been disappointed by any. Jessica has developed an innovative exercise program that incorporates all aspects of fitness.  It is clear to me that she has put her heart and soul into developing a system of total fitness for people.  She cares about weight loss and muscle fitness, but also agility, balance, flexibility, and holistic fitness--including brain fitness. I own many, many exercise DVDs but nothing come close to the comprehensive program Jessica has developed. You can find plenty that make you breathless while beating up your body, but hers are in a category of their own. She is a welcome break from the average cardio or muscle toning work our.

Furthermore, she has a most encouraging demeanor and sincerely-- this can't be faked--seems to genuinely care about the wellbeing of her audience.  I can't imagine how anyone would not be thrilled to add these four new DVDs to their library.  Thank you, Jessica!",1471046400,21,1188,4.96969696969697

7764337,4,B01GKK1TPS,"This is a nice addition to Jessica's workout series.  Workout #2, with weights, is my favorite of the three. It feels a lot like Ellen Barrett's weighted workouts, but with Jessica's particular personality.  It's a nice blend.

Workout #1, Core is what she refers to as ""sneaky"".  You're working harder than you think, but it is still - to my mind - a recovery day or active rest day workout.  It isn't quite cardio intense enough to make it a truly efficient combination of strength and cardio. For a more intense cardio core, I'd choose Jessica's core workout from her 21 day dvd, or one of Ellen Barrett's workouts.

Workout #3, Balance (with exercise band), is a nice all over workout, but not strenuous unless you're a beginner.  Its emphasis on balance, however, makes it helpful if one of your goals is to move from unfit to ""functionally fit.""

There are three completely different workouts.
All three are fun and different.
I enjoy kicking off my shoes and working out.
Core Control is low impact and works your abs. But don't be fooled, there's a cardio effect going on.
Poise & Grace uses light hand weights and your entire body gets worked out.
Balance & Agility uses a resistance band. You get to tone your body in a gentle and fun way and it incorporates cardio.
I couldn't pick a favorite out of the three.
They are all fun and best of all, there's no dread factor here.

7764345,5,B01GKK1TPS,"Balance is like a muscle, Jessica always says and I think she's right. These programs are designed to help with agility, balance and core strengthening in a fun and easy way. They fuse together traditional workout methods, as well as Pilates and Yoga to create a gentle, yet effective workout.

The core control one uses cardio to boost the calorie burn of targeting the abs and you'll sweat, even though it doesn't feel like work!

Poise and grace uses hand weights, but you can always do it with body-weight only. It's a tough one for me, but I feel super strong when I'm finished.

The balance and agility is my favorite workout because it uses a resistant band, but also works a lot on your balance. Jessica's mom, Debbie does all the easier options, which is what I used the first few times I did the workout.

I like that she is personable and has her mom do the easier adjustments so that I can get used to the workout. With summer being crazy with the kids out of school, I find this works well so the kids can watch their shows while mom works out in the basement. I definitely feel the workout and am sore from it which is great. She works all different areas of the body from circuit lower, upper and total, to walk aerobics, yoga, and more circuit training in these. There only about 30 to 35 min long and she tells you on the back what you need for extra equipment. Mostly hand weights, stretch band, ball, and step is what you need but her mom does the workout without sometimes so you can still do it until you get the added equipment. I loved that she added the step this time. Overall very happy with this purchase. I am not in the best shape and have lots of work cut out for me to lose weight and be healthier.

It was clear that these workouts were thrown together tho & she just asked her mom to show up. Her mom was constantly clueless of what was going on & was having to look at her constantly & starting the moves late.  It seems if you are producing a DVD to sell to the mass public it seems you would at least go over the workouts before hand.  Plus, her mother seemed to be in pain half the time (especially in the band workout) and her form was terrible. I wouldn't want my mother following her. I just didn't  feel I got a good workout for my time. I am about Jessica's age tho & I feel her DVDs markets to the older generation.  It would be nice for her to go back to more challenging workouts that targets her own age group & then we can continue following her as we age.  I really wanted to like this one because this is my favorite kind of workout but I was bore & the music was poorly selected. For example, until about half way thru the band workout the music sounded like it came from an 80s video game.  I did like the last half of the music with the middle eastern sound.  I am still a huge fan of Jessica & love her personality but maybe the DVDs are coming out to soon after each other & she needs to slow down a bit.",1469404800,9,1405,3.992857142857143

7764361,5,B01GKK1TPS,"This a must for those that like fusion style workouts that incorporate moves from yoga, pilates and ballet, etc.  All three on the DVD are very low impact but I was dripping in sweat nonetheless!  Core control's focus is just that: your abdominals and back muscles.  Everything is performed standing and although I feel I get more out of floor work this was effective in a different manner, especially since you're using your entire body and there is a cardio effect.  With Poise and Grace (of which I have neither) you use a set of light weights; the back and shoulders are really targeted and I loved that since while I normally lift heavy five pounds was perfect for those two areas and even the chest.  In fact, by the time Jessica began her ab segment my shoulders we so fried that I couldn't even reach them overhead anymore.  You do quite a few wide plies and plies in first position while doing the exercises so that increases the calorie burn (and sweat!).  I probably shouldn't have tried the final routine, Balance and Agility, after finishing Poise and Grace since your upper body once again is worked but this time a medium strength resistance band is used.  The moves were very creative and no muscle group was left untouched!  I loved the runner's drill in the beginning (hopping back an forth over the band to increase coordination) and almost every exercise included a balance challenge.  These three workouts are great for days whenever you want full body, low impact routines that are effective, get your heart rate up and cause a surprising amount of sweat.",1468800000,24,1577,4.701818181818182

7764363,5,B01GKK1TPS,"Love, love, love this video!  Jessica is a wonderful instructor and the time flies by whenever I workout with her videos, but this one is my absolute favorite because it is challenging and relaxing all at the same time.  The music is wonderful, which also helps boost my mood.  I feel wonderful after these workouts - they are invigorating, not irritating!!",1468454400,4,357,4.819672131147541
7764364,5,B01GKK1TPS,"These are great fusion workouts...each one incorporates toning, cardio and stretch, which I love!  I love Jessica's creativity in each of these workouts...she simply is the best!  I actually look forward to working out since getting Jessica's new DVD's!!!",1468195200,,255,5.512820512820513
7764365,5,B01GKK1TPS,"I love all of Jessica's workouts so of course I had to buy this, since it's brand new. These workouts for sure test your balance and make you realize how uncoordinated you are, lol. But I know the more often I do them the easier it will get.",1467763200,7,241,4.041666666666667
7764366,5,B01GKK1TPS,"When I first got this DVD, I thought the workouts would be pretty easy. Having done many of Jessica's workouts though, I should've known better. These are low-impact workouts, but you will get a lot out of them. Jessica shows you options for a more advanced move, while Debbie shows modifications for those who need an easier option. I love the workouts on this DVD because they are low-impact, but are very effective. I definitely felt it in my muscles after doing them. It was fun doing the workouts too, so the time flew by. I'll be getting a lot of use out of this one.",1467763200,9,573,4.415094339622642
8763177,5,B01GKK1TPS,"My butt is sore, my back is sore, my shoulders are sore, my thighs are sore....and it feels amazing!
I had this dvd for a year before I tried it, now I wish I had started sooner. I have back and shoulder issues and am always concerned that working out will hurt me. Well, after finishing the entire dvd, doing one work out per day, my body feels amazing. What hurts, hurts in a positive way.
Im 42 and my body was feeling the lack of use, I could feel my body decline from weakness. I had a lot of shoulder/neck pain from what I can only describe now as atrophy....I moved that little.
After only 3 days, my neck pain is virtually gone, the pressure in my lower back is gone, my shoulder doesnt hurt when I take off my shirt!
The work outs are fun and fly by. The music is not my favorite, but once you get going, you don't really notice it.
Jessica is not annoying and is very kind in her guidance. Love to see her mom workout with her, I love that she doesnt make perfect movements all the time like Jessica and that makes me feel better...knowing that it isn't about being perfect, its about being better.

Thank you Jessica! I look forward to ordering more and more of your dvds!",1537833600,,1183,4.18859649122807
8763178,5,B01GKK1TPS,This has three great low impact workouts all running just over 30 minutes. There is a countdown in the corner of the screen so you.always know how much longer I have in the workout.  I look forward to trying the other two DVDs she has available.,1530921600,2,245,4.326086956521739
8763179,5,B01GKK1TPS,"The exercises are challenging, but you can vary your stance as well as the weights you use. I have also split some of the videos by doing 15 min. of one and the complete video of another. They run about 30 minutes so I try to do at least one session every other day. The exercises have also helped control my neck and shoulder pain.",1530576000,4,332,4.123076923076923
8763180,5,B01GKK1TPS,I finished Total Transformation 6 Week System about a month ago. Then I completed the Walk On: Walk Off The Weight 30 Day Program and decided it was time to repeat Walk Strong! Im now on day 3 and cannot put into words how amazing I feel! I have never been able to stick with a program! I weigh less than I have in 15+years! I have gone down a pant size! Thank you Jessica for continuing to inspire us to keep going!,1530057600,2,416,4.024096385542169
8763181,5,B01GKK1TPS,"I wanted to improve balance as well as do a full body workout. I started with this cd and I really like it. It is low impact, I work up a light sweat and my core is getting stronger which is improving my balance in anticipation of beginning a weights work out.",1528934400,2,260,4.019230769230769
8763182,4,B01GKK1TPS,"This is the third DVD Ive bought from Jessica. One of the things I really like about her is she shows theres always room to improve your fitness level. Her mom did a modified version of the exercises while Jessica does more intense moves. I like that Jessica tries new workouts. This is all done barefoot which is a nice change. These 3 workouts pack a punch. I almost think the resistance band workout is better than one with weights. Who knew a piece of plastic could do so much?

The one thing I didn't like was the timer during the whole session. One of her other DVDs I own has a 10 minute timer to the end and that seemed better to me. This DVD was harder for me and I didn't like looking and thinking oh my. I still have .... minutes to go. It could discourage.",1525392000,3,768,4.154362416107382

8763185,5,B01GKK1TPS,"I have a lot of workout video DVDs and this is one of my favorites. I love that you work out barefoot and her mother, who is the same age as me, works out right next to Jessica. I'm a big fan of Ellen Barret workout videos and now Jessica Smith videos are right on top for me. With three 30 minute videos you get a lot for your money. I think that amount of time is perfect for a workout and my massage therapist says I'm more toned than most 20 year olds she sees. That says something for these videos.",1523664000,,503,3.9411764705882355
