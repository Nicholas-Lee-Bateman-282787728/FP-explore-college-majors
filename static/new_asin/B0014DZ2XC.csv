3130429,5,B0014DZ2XC,"Well, I saw it on opening night (in IMAX - I wasn't aware that it IS being shown in ""regular"" theaters, as well), and am still stunned and euphoric. It was better than my wildest dreams, one of the few movies that actually lives up to the trailer, and is now one of my five fave movies of ANY kind, all-time.

Musically:
The band may be sounding better than ever: Charlie, God bless `im, is nearly flawless, and his kit sounds incredible. Ronnie plays better lead than I've EVER heard him play, from Faces through all of the tours & albums he's done as a Stone. Keith's soulful feel always amazes, and he sings stronger than in some time. Darryl J. is SO locked in with Charlie. Lisa & Bernard sound gorgeous (and she LOOKS that way, too). In a rehearsal scene, I learned that Chuck is the de facto musical director (Damn him; he's had my dream gig for WAY too long!) - he kills, too. The horns are spot-on, as well, from the bluesy arrangements to the precision parts they play on ""All Down the Line."" Mick may have done the best live singing of his life - his tone is true to what he's sounded like on recordings, which has not always been the case in concert... ditto with pitch, phrasing and interpretation. Needless to say, he's still the most riveting front man in rock n' roll. Perhaps the most pervasive thing: Everyone on stage seems to be having the greatest, most fulfilling time of their lives, and they are performing as if those lives depended on it.

Technically:
God bless Marty Scorsese, too - he loves the music & presence of the Stones enough to LEAVE THEM THE F*** ALONE! This is a jaw-droppingly good film, from shooting to mixing & editing. Speaking of the mix (concert segments done by the great Bob Clearmountain), from a surround standpoint, it is astounding, at least in IMAX. I was happily blown away by this technique: Whomever is on camera, their instrument/voice is up front in the mix for the duration of that shot - PERFECTION! Between Scorcese's visual choices and Clearmountain's audio ones, I truly felt as if I had the best seat ever at a Stones concert. ONE GRIPE: I could have used more of Darryl's bass, and at times, Chuck's keyboards.

Guest spots:
Jack White: Okay. He's got the right idea.

Christina A: She, on the other hand, doesn't. She wails too much, especially for a GUEST. Great pipes - seems to me like she doesn't know when NOT to use them. Note Keith's reaction as she leaves the stage.

Buddy Guy: Try to take your eyes off of his - I dare you! Scorcese couldn't. A brilliant moment in time.

Viscerally:
My legs never stopped moving to the beat, at times, I shut my eyes and let my body sway, out of sheer tranquility. Ever since we left the theater (after midnight last Friday), I have felt more inspired as a musician; I've been writing more than I have in months. These are the effects the Stones' concerts have always had on me - as I wrote to 40 of my closest friends, ""Go. Go to the soonest showtime that you can possibly make.""",1207526400,32,2990,4.437158469945355
3130430,4,B0014DZ2XC,"If you know enough about The Stones that you're reading reviews to see if you should see this movie, then the answer is, ""Yes, you should see this movie.""

If you don't know much about The Stones, this movie will show you more about what all the fuss is about.

Watching Mick Jagger is amazing (and exhausting).  Most teenagers could not exert themselves as he does most nights.

Watching this film, you get the impression that if Rock n' Roll hadn't already existed when Mick came along, he would have willed and forced it into creation.

You get the impression that if Rock n' Roll wouldn't last until tomorrow unless we found a hamster able to run on a wheel all through the night, Mick would volunteer to be the hamster.

I think the movie clearly shows what it means for all members of a band to be necessary to create a band's chemistry.

We see the band members transform from fairly quiet and unassuming boys (with clips of interviews from the 1960s) into coordinated and widely heard protesters (still with their boyish grins and boyish charms) through their combined musical creations and performances.

We're reminded that Rock n' Roll used to be considered dangerous because it discussed sexually explicit topics with teenagers and anyone else listening in.

We're persuaded that The Stones' version of Rock n' Roll isn't just a style of music or a certain rhythm and tempo, but rather it is an extension of a coordinated force of wills.

I do have some critiques about the film, which lead me to give it only 4 out of 5 stars, but life's short and my critiques are not important, and you're probably not reading this review to hear about one critic's ideas about how to make a better concert movie.  I'm still waiting for a truly great Rock n' Roll concert movie, and unfortunately, this movie, like many others, falls just short.

The Stones do great performances of many of their famous songs, from ""Start Me Up"" to ""Satisfaction"" to ""Brown Sugar"" to ""Sympathy for the Devil"" to ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" and many more.  I particularly loved  their performance of their 1978 song ""Far Away Eyes"" and their cover of The Temptations' ""Just My Imagination.""

The movie and The Stones' lives suggest it takes regular hard work, rare chemistry, and a driving will to artfully publish our dissatisfactions if you want to shine the lights of Rock n' Roll.",1207440000,10,2358,4.70316301703163

3130433,5,B0014DZ2XC,"Shine a Light is a great movie. The Stones are great on the stage. Far Away Eyes, Just My Imagination, She Was Hot, As Tears Go By.... all wonderful versions.

3130434,2,B0014DZ2XC,"Have you seen the ""Bodies Exhibition"" that has been touring museums all over America? Its an interesting concept, real human cadavers (minus the skin)posed in various positions, shooting baskets, conducting orchestras- doing things dead bodies don't do.
Well if you add some bland remakes of some great Stone songs to these lifeless skeletors, you have an idea what Martin Scorceses zoom lens on the Rolling Stones looks like in this film.

There's several Rolling Stones movies. Two are really good- ""Ladies and Gentleman:the Rolling Sones"" (curiously unavilable on DVD) and ""Gimme Shelter"", the others hardly mentionable. Unfortunately, ""Shine a Light"" falls into this latter category. Age isn't the worst thing about the Stones in 2008. It's scary how creviced their mugs are today and jokes about their withered flesh are hard to resist. The worst thing about the Stones is they have clearly lost their edge as the bad boys of rock and roll and instead of rocking out their energy with raw, ballsy versions of the tunes we all love, they fortify their stage band with quality session men and other ringers and play some versions of songs that I find absolutley bizarre. ""Shattered"" in particular was a great studio masterpiece, complete with a beat that smelled rock,punk and maybe a little disco all in one and a guitar solo/bridge with Ron Wood pedal steel guitar that was very imaginative and ahead of its time. ""Shine a Light's version of this great tune starts with a mutated and unrecognizable guitar riff and and worsens with a Jagger vocal that defies the original cadence and rhythm. Bizarre, sloppy and bad.
Also know that Keith apparently only rarely contributes backup vocals, handing duties over to a trio of backup vocalists. Keith does sing lead on two vanity numbers ""You Got the Silver"" and ""Connection"", completely wasted efforts. Keiths vocals never were really good, but at least the effort was appreciated. The Stones also waste our time with songs like ""Start Me Up"" (which I'm sure is not a fave of true fans at all), ""She Was Hot"" and a cover version of ""Just My Imagination"" that sounded far better on vinyl. Put this all together with a self-censored take of ""Some Girls"" and you don't have much of a rock concert. It's more like one of those Hall of Fame Induction shows where the music takes a back seat to celebrating the fact the performer is just alive.

Suprisingly I really like the guest apparences, something which is usually contrived and lame. Buddy Guy didn't bring a lot of notes to the stage but plays them with taste and soul. Jack White enjoys doing a better Mick than Mick on ""Loving Cup"" and Christina Aguilera (who I never knew could sing) lets go with some great belting on ""Live With Me"". Keith does show some life with his axe, but Ron Wood seems to grab the zestier leads, and though he is no Mick Taylor, he proves a competent guitarist.

I hope the Stones did this for the music and not for the money, because I am sure not buying it. Scorcese is a great director, the Stones were a great band, but at this stage all has been done, what's the point? I know they don't NEED the money, but apparently they do WANT the money. IF you want good Stones, go elsewhere.",1207180800,11,3216,4.708703374777975

Though the actual track 'Shine a Light' from Exile on Main Street is not played during the (film version of this) set, it is an excellent title for this rock documentary as Martin Scorcese is shining a light so to speak on the Stones themselves, and this light shines mighty bright and mighty close. But Scorcese is not as invasive as you might expect. And this documentary/concert film does not feel like an expose as much as a celebration of a band that still has some kick left in it. Instead of being overly reverent and even elegaic (as perhaps he was in The Last Waltz) Scorcese, takes a lighthearted & lighthanded approach. The first thing that Scorcese documents is the planning of the show itself and the miscommunications that took place between what the Stones wanted (a big venue) and what Martin wanted (an intimate one); miscommunications that could have been avoided had the band been available to actually meet face to face with Scorcese, but these and other miscommunications are treated more as running jokes than as genuine problems. Another running joke is that meticulous detail man Martin Scorcese (perhaps the only living director with a fame that rivals the Stones own) wants to know ahead of time what the set list will be or at least what the first song will be so that he can plan his first shot, but the Stones keep it a secret until seconds before the show begins. Its funny even though no one really thinks for a second that with his arsenal of cameras on and off stage there is any chance that Martin Scorcese will not get the exact shots he wants. But even while having some laughs with the band (at the bands and at his own expense), Scorcese is excellent at capturing what an immense task it is working with a band that is not used to surrendering control nor opening up on camera (and Scorcese inserts several old interviews into the concert footage to document Mick's ability to dodge questions with charm and Keith's utter refusal to play the q & a game at all). The irony is that the Stones have been public figures for over four decades now but we really still don't know them very well. Scorcese does a very good job at remedying this situation by peeling back the Stones mystique and allowing us to see the real personalities behind the public performances. As with his Dylan documentary, he does this by going though the immense Stones Interviews archive and coming up with some very rare interview footage (much of it from Asian and European tv programs). We get to hear the notoriously reticent Charlie discussing an alternative career as a painter, and Ron Wood discussing Keith and how he is nothing like his public image, ""Keith's a very decent and very moral guy"". The interviews are culled from all phases of their career and are very brief and very selectively inserted between the live songs. Most of them are humorous and/or ironic. Notably absent: any mention of Brian Jones or Mick Taylor or Bill Wyman.

No doubt there will be Stones fans who wish that Scorcese had teamed up with the '72 or '76 or '78 Stones, when the band was a bit more like Scorcese's screen outlaws, but better late than never.

For Stones fans the thrill (and it is immediate and lasts the entire show) is having the feeling of being onstage with the Stones. Jack White, Buddy Guy, and Christina Aguilera all do guest stints onstage but we as audience members feel like we are onstage as well and this is the truly brilliant thing about this film. The cameras are so close that we actually get to see the band play (and see who plays which guitar lines) and hear the between song banter between band members. Scorcese allows us to affirm or reaffirm that Mick is without a doubt the leader of this band and his relentless energy and seductive charms seem to wow his bandmates as much as they wow the crowd. Micks age shows in the close-ups but his real instruments, his voice & his body, seem completely immune from the ravages of time. Keith, at times, seems a bit lost (as when Christinsa Aguilera steps onstage) and he misses chords in a few places, but Scorcese's intimate style really serves Richards well. He is an intensely likable guy who loves what he does and still seems to feel adorably awkward when he takes center stage to sing ""You Got the Silver"" & ""Connection."" He is in many ways Mick's opposite. The chemistry of the band and especially the chemistry that exists between the Glimmer Twins is the thing that continues to fascinate and continues to evade documentation.

The show is intense and intimate and revealing. The guest appearances are well chosen. And the ending (which I will not reveal) is perfect.

Note on the soundtrack: The 2 cd edition of the Shine a Light soundtrack will contain four bonus tracks (""Paint it Black"", ""Little T & A"", ""I'm Free"", & ""Shine a Light"").",1207094400,123,5227,4.581818181818182

3130492,2,B0014DZ2XC,"Let me preface this by saying I'm a musician, a huge fan of Rock and  of an age (63) where I was onto the Stones from the beginning. Saw them in LA in '69. I love their records thru all of the Brian Jones and most of the Mick Taylor era; occasionally since. This is a well shot film as you would expect from Scorcese. The question I have is does it offer anything compelling? To me the answer is no. Why? Well first and foremost is, I don't think the Stones are now or have been for a very long time, a good live band. Let's be honest here, Keith and Woody are sloppy, undisciplined players who are not good improvisors and take a 'devil may care' attitude towards the arrangements. Mick is and has always been preoccupied with bebopping around the stage, dancing and waving his arms while shouting out the words to each number. Never a great vocalist to start with, he has no intention of singing seriously. I've often described his live performances as, 'hollering' He hollers the lyrics. It's too bad really because I truly love so many of their early recordings. But they are who they are. There was a time way back when (early 70's) when Keith would keep the arrangements tight and leave the lead parts to the gifted Mick Taylor. Now with his own grand persona outside of the band as well as in (mostly for just still being among the living) he has a whole schtick which includes a lot of guitar playing outside of his expertise. Ugh! If you're interested in seeing a good performance of the Stones live, pick something on film from the early 70's. If you want to see Keith at the top of his game, choose a concert film of him with the Expensive Winos recorded at the Hollywood Palladium in the 90's. If you want to admire the Rolling Stones still doin' it in their 60's, then this movie is for you",1437955200,2,1803,4.334319526627219

3130501,3,B0014DZ2XC,"Martin Scorsese's concert footage of The Rolling Stones shot at the Beacon Theater in NYC is a decent representation of what it feels like to see the post-2000 Stones live.  He's a cinematic master, and this piece is technically well done.  Sound, lighting, editing, all good stuff.  Where this film falls down is in the clash-of-the-titans undertone that does not serve the greater purpose.

This is especially true because I assume Scorsese owns this work and had final say on what was used and what was edited out.  When you wield editorial power, you must understand that your wise viewer also knows this.  Because while I can assume that Mick Jagger is a bit of a ""diva,"" Scorsese works so hard to prove this that it comes across as uncomfortably defensive, especially when the director shoots himself as the helpless victim ""I sure would like to see the set list!""  This would make a fascinating documentary -- but it creates uncomfortable tension in the intro to a concert film.  We get to hear every one of Scorsese's whiny, neurotic complaints about the band and the theater.

For a 40-year veteran of stadium rock concerts, Mick does his share of moaning about lights and cameras, as well.  All this complaining actually does take away from the show.  For instance, I hardly would have noticed the two big Pana-Plex cameras in the second row if it weren't for Mick's complaints. But now they're all I see, and it's not necessary.  Concert have obtrusive cameras - that's rock & roll!  Until you make them a plot point.

Marty should just smile and say ""Action!""  I don't want to think, ""E-gads!  Will this show come together?!  Will Mick be on time?  Will the cameras be blocked?""  It's a Stones show!  I want a inevitable build up to be positive!  The battle of the egos is an unnecessary distraction.

Also, I had no idea this was a Bill Clinton production until I got to the part when he walks on stage during set up.  The awkwardness of the band around this business-suited entourage makes you feel for Keith and Ronnie, and to his credit, Scorsese shoots this in a manner that makes you feel like part of the band listening to Keith's muttered wisecracks and Charlie's good humored placating of politicians.  For a bunch of bad boys, they sure are polite!

Hillary makes a cameo as the most uncool girl in the room, trying to make the band laugh at Bill's expense. (spoiler alert - she fails.)
I love behind the scenes footage as much as the next guy, but it was all so unexpected, I felt like I had walked into the wrong ballroom.

However in the end, boy these Stones roll - and how!  When you view this show, turn it up loud.  No LOUDER!  Now it's a Stones concert!",1434326400,,2683,4.566037735849057

3130534,5,B0014DZ2XC,"For beginners, this review is written by Eve's husband, Neil Quiros. I think I'm The # one Stones' fan in Venezuela.

I'd acquired this video on BD disc but I saw the DVD format and was amazed by the brightness and resolution of the picture that are almost as good as the Blu-Ray disc, so I decided to get it on DVD too. It's important to consider the wide screen format and the illumination of the setting as well which make the video very enjoyable. This video is iconical for marking the end of an era in the Stones career, It was their last performance documented in their first half century span. It was a very exclusive and intimate performance which had not been seen before on video for beig on behalf of the Clinton Foundation with the attendance of his family and closest friends and for the details shown about the preparations by Scorsese.

The song versions are full of energy as usual and the score was an excellet sellection. The special guests were incredible. I,m in love with Cristina Aguilera's voice, Jack White's Versin of Loving Cup, and the jokes and anecdotes on Buddy Guy. His voice was an important contribution to the show, too; I like the idea of having blues, American black players in their shows so we don't forget the Stones' origens and supporting  these musicians this way. As a matter of fact, I think this is the best sellection of special guests in a Stone show.
There was too much cursing by Mick, though. But I think this is one of the best videos by the Rolling Stones along with LET'S SPEND THE NIGHT TOGETHER and BRIDGES TO BABYLON and never get tired of watching them, Hope other fans enjoy them as much as I do, too.",1401321600,,1660,4.471947194719472

3130543,5,B0014DZ2XC,"I just recently purchased a Blu ray player and ""Shine a Light"" is one of the first Blu ray disc that I have watched on my Sony TV. This is an excellent concert if you like the Rolling Stones.

Video: The picture quality is excellent.
Seeing Keith Richards up close in 1080P isn't for everyone as blu ray displays every single wrinkle of his face like a very dry dirt road. It's amazing that he is still rockin'.
There were many cameras filming the action and the overall feel is that you attended a concert and were in the crowd rockin' with Mick Jagger. Cameras also effectively catch action on the stage up close as they perform.

Audio : Excellent Sound quality of the concert.
I have a Pioneer receiver that drives 5 speakers in surround sound. My Pioneer plays analog and I is not digital. The blu ray disc allows about three options to choose from so you can select which audio performs best with your sound system. The recording is very alive and catches the energy of the concert. The mix is good as you can hear Mick's vocals while also hearing the drums of Charlie and guitars of Richards and Ronnie Wood.

Performance: I'm amazed that after all these years, these guys can still take the crowd into their hands and rock them.
They effectively breath new life into songs that they have performed countless times over the years. While doing ""Brown Sugar"" Mick leads the audience like a conductor as they sing  ""ye, ye, ye, wooo!"" You have to see and hear it. Awesome.

They cover ""Just my Imagination"" a tune associated usually with the Temptations version of a happy sounding song. However Mick captures the anger and frustration of the song which completely makes sense. After all, the object of his affection doesn't even know he exist and this romance is a thing he was forced to manufacture in his mind. At one point in the song Mick exclaims, ""she doesn't even f-ing know me!"" in a heavy British accent.  I loved it and the once beloved Temptations version is now lame next to this.

Guest appear as the blues guitarist Buddy Guy joins Mick on stage to perform a tune about getting high and Buddy appears that he just might be. The performance is very raw and blues at its finest.

Chistina Aguilera sings a rather saucy suggestive tune with Mick and they are good together. They seem to enjoy the performance. It is soulful and their styles provide contrast.

There are old news clips of the Stones mixed in from over the years. They are short, interesting, and not over done. The blu ray moves at a good pace from start to finish.

""Shine a Light"" is an excellent Blu ray that combines clear video with well mixed audio while capturing one of the best rock bands ever, doing what they have done for generations and they can still bring it. Enjoy",1391817600,,2762,4.517034068136272

Bobby Keys on sax, Mick a firecracker on guitar for ""Some Girls."" Keith plays a weird 12-string guitar solo on ""As Tears Go By"", song suits Mick's voice very nicely now. Short series of bad interviews, like one in Japan:

""How old are you?""
""Twenty-nine.""
""Same age as me.""
""How nice.""

""What question have you been asked the most?""
""That one you just asked.""

And how many times were they asked ""so, how much longer are you going to keep doing this?"" A bunch of older songs - ""Jusy My Imaginations, "" ""The Girl With Faraway Eyes."" Mick `n' Keith hugging and harmonizing. Muddy Waters comes out for ""Champagne And Reefer"" with Buddy Guy. Keith intimidated Buddy onstage, gets him to stop spazzing, Mik plays the mouth harp at him. ""Tumbling Dice"", introduces the band. Keith's schtick: ""It's good to see you all. It's good to see anybody."" Keith sings ""You've Got The Silver"" with no guitar, Ron on slide. Still has the voice. ""Keith sings ""Connection."" Keith talks about him `n' Ronnie: ""We're both pretty lousy, but together we're better than ten others."" Overly-long lame intro to ""Sympathy For The Devil"", with Mick strutting around stage left. Ho hum... Christina Aguilero omes out for ""Live With Me,"" really shouldn't have (does she fill the cheese gap that Cher has left behind her?) She would have been better doing ""Gimme Shelter"". Similarly lame intro to ""Start Me UP."" That as ""last song""? Come on!! ""Brown Sugar,"" Keith's guitar zomms in and out of the mix. ""Satisfaction."" Closing credits is the audio for ""Shine A Light."" The song is in memory of Ahmet Ertegun - it was this show where he slipped and injured himself in the backstage area, never to recover. Suppplementary video - ironic media statements: why have you stayed together so ong? Top of the ""to die"" list (""I'll let you know"").

""Why do you keep on doing what you're doing?""
""That's a stupid question.""

Mick on slide guitar. Shows Mick on the other side of the call with Scorsese. Ron, Mick and Keith acoustic jam with Charlie - Mick on harmonica. Bonus songs: ""Undercover of the Night"", intro sounds weird without the stupid electric drum jazz. ""Paint It Black"" near-identical to the studio version.

3130558,5,B0014DZ2XC,I'm back on a Stones kick after reading Keith Richards' autobiography. These guys do not let you down. They've had some bumps along the way but their dedication to rock music and their ability to still put on a great show make them a treasure.  Scorsese does a great job and his production doesn't get in the way of raw energy. Guest appearances are a delight.  My only issues was with the Amazon instant video itself. It paused and had to reconnect several times during the movie even though I had plenty of bandwidth.,1368144000,,519,4.51063829787234

3130564,4,B0014DZ2XC,"If the Stones cast a bright light who better to reflect on it than Scorcese?  Seeking to revisit the greatness of his rock 'n roll opus The Last Waltz Scorcese turns his talents to what is, perhaps, the greatest rock 'n roll band of all time.  Nothing wrong with that, and in this viewer's eyes a welcome addition to music history.  If there is a weakness it could only be said it is a good twenty years late, but really that's splitting hairs.  Great music trumps all and it truly almost does here.  You get a truly later day impassioned performance at the ornate Beacon Theatre.  While the performance is constantly interrupted by myriad news clips there is a path of a great intimately photographed Stones fantastic performance.  And it is the talent of Scorcese documenting this incendiary performance that rises above all.  The factor, besides the fantastic cinematography, that makes this compelling is the song selection with inspired performance.  The viewing audience gets a great insight into the music which even if long in tooth is some of the greatest rock ever penned.  If there is a greater example of a timeless rock band it is almost impossible to imagine.  Objectively it doesn't reach the pinnacle of The Last Waltz but it comes damn close.  With reference sight and sound it may be the finest concert ever presented on video in spite of the aforementioned limitations.  For all Stones fans as well as the general music lover...This is not to be missed.",1365897600,,1472,4.770750988142293

3130571,4,B0014DZ2XC,"I am the Stones Authority. And reluctantly I must agree with a number of the negative reviews of this DVD. When I first heard about Scorsese making this film I was quite excited. A documentary of the band working up to a show at the Beacon, but as it turned out - it really is not a documentary, it is just a concert film - of a concert pulled together for the purpose of shooting a documentary. You know, Martin, make it one or the other. The documentary aspect of it starts out well enough, but then is abandoned for the concert film and we never return back to the documentary. Too bad, because the documentary aspect was fairly interesting. And I really don't need Bill Clinton or any of that Global Warming crap. Is this a big thing for Scorsese? Does anyone know? And what the hell do either have to do with the Stones and a documentary about them preparing for a show? Since this ""documentary"" is so contrived - it is anything but a documentary. So it is little wonder that the performance is not that inspired. It is not bad, but just look at the faces of the girls pulled in from the Elite Modeling Agency to stock the front row. This is not the Stones fan base. These hot little brats have never heard of the Stones, and couldn't name one song if their lives depended on it. Kind of a shame really, because the Beacon Theater is a great place to see a show. I saw Keith there with the Expensive Winos back in '89 or '90, and this could have been a great DVD, but I don't think Scorsese put a lot of brain power into this one - figured it would just work out, because it is the Stones. Now, on the plus side, it is nicely shot. The audio is actually pretty damn good, but for the annoying tendency in the mix to ""focus"" a solo or other instrument when we cut to its respective ""close up"". And the set list is pretty good and I don't have a problem with the guest appearances. I don't care about Jack White and his presence doesn't add anything. I don't really care about Aguilera either, but her duet with Jagger on ""Live With Me"" is actually one of the DVD's hi-lites, as far as I am concerned. Buddy Guy is great. I wish Jagger had sung ""Connection"" - an old favorite of mine - but was happy that it was there even with Keith singing it. All in all it is not that bad, it is actually pretty good, but it could have easily been so much better if Herr Director had made up his mind about what kind of film he really wanted to make. Scorsese kind of wings it and the whole thing suffers as a result.",1357776000,2,2507,4.160493827160494

I won't even bring up the fact that, if Mick Ronson had gotten the gig after Mick T quit, they might have still been viable.  ""Shine A Light"" is simply pathetic.

3130575,3,B0014DZ2XC,"Not a bad show, considering when it was filmed.  Strange though, in some ways, after reading Keith's book.  The film starts out with Bill Clinton and a charity speech.  Seems odd since Keith goes on and on in the book about not bowing to the establishment that spent years trying to put him in jail.  Plus, in over 500 pages, Keith never once mentions charity.  But the really strange part was watching the Rolling Stones perform an edited version of ""Some Girls.""  Trying to look badass at 70 years old and yet obviously omitting controversial words comes across as petty self-censorship.

Too bad, there was so much character in the venue, the audience, and the performance, when all wrapped together, you were worn out by nights end....sounds like a title to a
movie doesn't it?  Worn out by nights end......if you want to enjoy The Stones in a small venue, this is your only chance.  Have a bunch of friends over, have a few cocktails and snacks, talk about your concert going days...hopefully those days aren't over, hook up your HDMI cable to your large flat screen surround sound television...in a big room....turn out the lights...turn UP the sound....have a nice big comfortable couch and chairs around...and don't worry about a thing.
You might just feel like you are there.....don't over analyze the thing.....it's The Rolling Stones....not a stringed quartet comprised of virtuoso's.  You are going to see The Rolling Stones in concert in their 60's NOT in THE 60's....and it's just amazing.....warts and all.....absolutely amazing.

3130588,3,B0014DZ2XC,"I have a soft spot in my heart for Rolling Stones concert DVDs.
""A Biggest Bang"", ""4 flicks"" and ""Lets Spend the Night Together""
all showcase a band playing to the edges of their ability
and doing a very creative job of it. Also the personality
of the really band stands out. That's what makes watching a Stones DVD such fun.

How is it that the Stones have come to censor themselves so severely?
To be fair,some of the ""Shine a Light"" concert film delivers great interaction:
the Buddy Guy scene is great as well Mick and Keith interacting during ""Far Away Eyes"";
but the fact that certain curse words are masked from the DVD belies an urge to play it safe.

That is evident in the way the certain scenes in the film are shot as well.
On more than one occasion dialogue is cut or masked.
Also the song ""Some Girls"" is performed with certain lyrics missing.
I know, they've been changing the live lyrics to ""Brown Sugar"" for years.
Now this editing for a PG-13 rating seems to have reached a tipping point.
I buy DVDs to get unedited performances; otherwise I could watch this on cable.

Maybe the Stones have mellowed and Scorsese has captured the simple truth.
Charlie Watts, Ron Wood, and bassist Darryl Jones

It's no secret that Scorsese is a huge Stones fan - their music is featured in many of his films.  But the way this concert is shot is a little strange...the sound is highlighted in the shot.  So if Keith Richards is featured on the screen, you primarily hear his guitar.  If it's Charlie Watts, you hear his drums.  Not just a little louder than the rest of the music...like the rest of the band is in the background.  Maybe there's a way to turn this off?  The soundtrack doesn't do this.

Overall, the Blu-ray is very clear, the setlist is great, the featured artists like Jack White are cool, but Scorsese's attempt to reinvent the live-concert-film wheel takes it down a couple notches.  Give it a rent before you buy.",1323561600,6,861,4.467948717948718

3130596,1,B0014DZ2XC,"One of the great things about being human is that you can always reinvent yourself. You change with the times and, if you are artistic, repackage yourself in a new and interesting ways that takes into account the new you and what you have to work with. The Stones don't get this. They simply try to be who they were when they were kids and it really doesn't work. They look like a cover band of themselves except kind of old and ridiculous, and they can't even get the guitar parts right. You'd think after years, day in and out, of playing the same songs, they'd only get the guitar parts better, or change them a bit in new and interesting ways, but, in fact, they only play sloppy versions of the same old stuff. There is nothing new, no fresh takes on anything except to include some guests that, for the most part, don't really add anything interesting. They just don't really care about the music anymore. It's all about cashing in and showing everyone that they still can do it. I'm not really interested in seeing old men prove to me they still can move around on stage like they used to. I'd rather have old seasoned men show me that they still care about the music they play, and show me they still care about playing good music. I'd like to see the Stones perform new good songs, or at least the old songs, in new and interesting ways that show me they still care about being creative musicians instead of proving to the world that rich white people are still willing to shell out tons of money to see some kind of endurance record and pretend they are young again. Young people love the Stones because, let's face it, they haven't come up with anything better or different. Embarrassingly, these old guys are more interesting than anything the younger generation has managed to come up with.  I know many people will enjoy this, and I can't fault them for it, but for me, it's just so boring, and worse, depressing. It's depressing that one of the greatest Rock bands that wrote so many wonderful songs are now willing to forget what they are capable of doing that really matters, write and play good music, and simply ape themselves in a pathetic attempt to be who they once were forever.

3130598,5,B0014DZ2XC,"Since the other reviews cover content & experience of the film/concert, I'll just add the uncovered aspects here, except to say that the price is well worth the purchase for a DVD one will watch again & again, a must for any Stone's fan, or NEW fans. I don't own any Stone's albums or DVD's, so this was my 1st real glimpse of the band in their real lives & history, chemistry together, as well as their performance. I've heard & loved many of their songs, an old one not included in this concert that was a favorite of mine was ""Under My Thumb"". I've become a fan late in life, as a result of the energy & stellar talent revealed in this performance/DVD & would definitely buy it again.

The single disc (another said only 4 extra tracks on 2 DVD set) DVD included the 6 bonus tracks, behind-the-scenes featurette, other film previews & credits. I wish there had been more content but am satisfied with my purchase, knowing I will watch this DVD many times over without ever being bored; there's so much going on in every scene one doesn't dare look away for fear of missing some important angle, perspective, action or tidbit. The concert is about 2 hours long, the special features about 30 minutes; from experience (Pink Floyd's Pulse 2 DVD set for example, had 15+ hours) I know DVD's hold at least 7 hours of content each and would have liked to see much more of the behind-the-scenes, historical & lifestyle as well as musical content that probably ended up on the cutting room floor.

Perhaps other fans know the reasons & answers for this question & I'm going to offend by asking, but why do they need 5+ guitar players? Keith, Ronnie & Mick all play guitar together for many songs, plus the bass player, and a 5th guitar to the left of the 2 back-up singers/dancers, and then out comes Jack White with guitar, and Buddy Guy with guitar, with all the additional instruments played by stand-ins rather than band members. Why doesn't one of the band play keyboards or bass? How many lead guitarists does one band need??? Mick seems to use his guitars as props, rarely actually strumming the strings, nor can one hear the sound his guitar makes, if it makes any. When Jack White comes out, it's clear he has some type of injury to his right upper arm or elbow, as he has some sort of black wrapping or brace and a short/no sleeve on that side, with a full long sleeve on the left arm, so why did he need to play guitar when all the other members (besides Charlie the drummer), including Mick, were playing guitar too??? Jack White is an awesome musician playing just about any instrument, and his vocals are as good if not better than his guitar, so he could easily have just sung with Mick & rested his injured arm. White did the best job of harmonizing with Mick of the 3 featured guests (Buddy and Christina), and one could easily see that White was living his fantasy of being on stage with his idols, he could not stop grinning & seemed to be having the time of his life, as did all the band members. Buddy Guy played fantastic guitar, but his vocals were way too loud & overwhelmed the other band members voices/tone; maybe his mic was turned up too high? Christina danced & used her voice to full DEEP belting effect, at times too loud but for the most part doing a great job harmonizing with Mick--there was definite chemistry between them both, as there was between the band and all the guests on stage. A definite MUST SEE for any classic rock or Stone's fan.

One weird note, on the left stage were 3 people, 2 of whom were back-up singers, and a 3rd person in their section to the immediate left, whose face was NEVER shown, who was it & why weren't they included in the film or introduction by Mick later in the concert? That bit of mystery distracted me, and I was surprised that there were a male and female back-up singer only, no others--with the band members doing vocal I wasn't sure why they needed a male back-up singer & had expected there to be several female singers instead. No matter because the one female singer, Lisa, made up for at least 2 or 3 others of inferior talent or ability, her voice & dancing, her energy, amazed me! As did her fellow singer/dancer to her right. As other's have stated, the bass guitar is barely heard, and the keyboards rarely heard or featured, and lastly, why were there NO solos, especially Charlie on drums who seems to be portrayed as a supporting cast member who rarely gets any attention, recognition or face time in this DVD. The guest members received more face time than did the drummer, which is a shame for an original band member to be largely ignored (just a couple close-ups and interview bits compared to the rest).",1313193600,,4695,4.463329452852154

Needless to say the day is long past when anyone, at least anyone that I know, will dispute the title of ""the world's greatest rock band"" that has been attached to this group. In the old days an argument could be made, and rightfully so, that Jim Morrison and the Doors on their good nights secured that title but that was then. Off a viewing of this production it is east to see why the Stones carry that title, without hype, even today.

Director Scorsese has made a very good decision to go light on the filler (early Stones interviews, press conferences, etc.) and the technical aspects of putting on such a tour (and the compounded problem of filming it). The center of the documentary is the Stones' concert from Chicago (a Bill Clinton charity benefit concert) complete with all the classics, ""Sympathy For The Devil"", ""Satisfaction"", ""Brown Sugar"", Girl With The Faraway Eyes"", etc. Clearly these sixty-something guys still can rock and one best keep that AARP membership offer at arms length. But, to finish, here is the ""skinny"", one must always remember that the Stones started, heart and soul, as a white blues cover band (Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, and so on) and so the scene that steals this production is when old Chicago bluesman, Buddy Guy, comes on to fire up ""Champagne and Reefer"".

If the astonishing longevity of The Rolling Stones has taught us anything, it's that rock'n'roll is no longer just a young man's game.  In fact, after nearly a half a century of rocking out, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood - all now in their 60s - offer proof positive that youth is indeed just a state of mind.

More than twenty years after his seminal rock film ""The Last Waltz,"" director Martin Scorsese turns his cameras on the Stones, recording a concert they performed at the Beacon Theatre in 2006 (as part of their ""A Bigger Bang Tour"") to benefit The Clinton Foundation (Bill and Hillary are both present at the event and are seen mingling with the fellows in the opening moments of the film).  I'd say that at least 70 percent of the film's running time is devoted to the concert itself, with the rest made up of backstage stuff (mainly early on) and  footage from interviews the band members gave throughout their career when reporters were (ironically, as it turns out) always predicting the band's demise within a few years - snippets obviously designed to contrast the boys` younger selves with what they look like today.  The most humorously prescient moment comes when Dick Cavett asks Jagger, in 1972, if he can envision himself still doing this when he's 60.  (Jagger's answer, by the way, is yes).

With camerawork that is fluid without calling undue attention to itself, ""Shine a Light"" is essentially a straight-forward concert film featuring some of the group's most instantly recognizable standards (""Jumpin' Jack Flash,"" ""Shattered,"" ""Start Me Up,"" ""As Tears Go By,"" ""Brown Sugar,"" ""Satisfaction,"" etc.) as well as songs that are less well known - a feast for diehard fans of the band, to be sure, though probably less gratifying for those who aren't.  For despite the presence of Scorsese in the director`s chair, ""Shine a Light"" is not really all that remarkable as a piece of filmmaking, but the sight of a bunch of astoundingly agile sexagenarians strutting their stuff on stage as if they were still in their twenties does give hope and encouragement to the rest of us fighting against our own fast-approaching golden years.  It's obvious that these boys - clearly the true survivors of the rock era -  are one day going to be taken off the stage feet first, going out doing what they love best.  And, if nothing else, the film gets these rock'n'roll legends on the record for future generations to enjoy.",1272931200,,2469,4.797169811320755
3130610,5,B0014DZ2XC,"I do love me some Stones, but I admit I didn't see this in the theatres, nor was I entirely certain what it was about.  I knew it was Scorsese and that there would be plenty of concert footage, but that's true of the Last Waltz too, and that was much more than a concert film.  ""Shine a Light"" is the gem that answers the question, ""How much would I like to have the best seat in the house at a Stones club concert?""  The boys may have been a lot more relevant when they made ""Gimme Shelter,"" but you simply can't deny the quality of concert filming possible these days, with advanced audio recording, multi-cameras on tracks, digital film editing, 5.1 sound... getting copies of these even at full retail is just a ridiculous steal for the experience.

Plenty of other reviewers talk about the performances, which are fantastic, and prove that unlike athletes, musicians never really get too old to do their thing.  This film illustrates better than ever how hard Mick Jagger works when he gives a concert.  That man is relentless.

But I want to move on to technical comments.  The sound is very interesting and beguiling.  The first thing you notice is that the overall blend sounds great.  The second is that it is the most pro-Keith live audio I've ever heard.  He clearly has his own channel in the master tapes, and you can clearly hear everything he plays and sings.  Thanks to the wonders of home theatre these days, you can also always get a clean read on the bassline.  But every other instrument seems subject to whether or not Scorsese wants you to hear it.  It's like outside of Mick and Keith he's constantly moving around the volume to the featured notes and then mixing them back down.  You can't hear Ronnie Wood half the time.  And the person who gets the worst treatment is Charlie Watts, who you can barely hear the whole time, and what you can hear is not miked well.  Overall, I like it better than most Stones audio, but it has its oddities.

Visually, I don't know how he does it, but Scorsese's concert film technique is fantastic.  He's got the same look as the Last Waltz again... sharp light that manages to never be harsh, spotlights through the smoke creating art in the air.  The film editing is amazing, flipping from one angle to the next on the same person but perfectly synced and not jarring.  It's better than a front-row seat... it's a constantly moving best seat in the house.

Great stuff.  No wonder people rave.",1268179200,3,2454,4.5147392290249435

I have to admit I was drawn in by the film, the Stones and Mick Jagger in particular and thoroughly enjoyed them all.  The film is fantastic and fully portrays the energy and vitality that made Mick Jagger famous. Watching him, you slowly come to realize that Jagger's power is that he is more of a modern dancer than a vocalist. His graceful and complex body movements are captivating to watch. He totally blends dynamic energy with body movement and music. The movie is a rare change to appreciate Jagger's magnetic charm without paying the high price of a concert ticket. He truly gives an outstanding performance.

The movie also features the other members of the band: guitarists Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood, and drummer Charlie Watts. Kieth Richards is one of the greatest guitarists of all time (ranked number 10 on the list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time). It is a treat to watch this artist in action. These performers are so into their music you feel the sounds are coming out of their bodies rather than the instruments. They are perfectly in tune with their music.

Stones are old enough and drug-addicted enough to give even a good live (not to talk about great live). I watch the concerts and see how they killed and thrilled their music. Rolling Stones became a SHOW-ORRIENTED band. Quite similiarly to Madonna. Well... we all know Madonna can't sing, she hasn't voice and looks like old b**ch, thus puts everything in the show and stage-design to attract people.

If you are a MUSIC FAN, the music you listen must be GOOD TO LISTEN, not good to watch. The only thing I like in todays Stones, is their stage set, light effects and the number of crowd they attract. what about MUSIC? musically this is probably the WORST band from the list of Stones' cover bands.

the ONLY band, which comes from the sixties and MUSICALLY remains ABSOLUTELY GREAT, is DEEP PURPLE. Deep Purple & Rolling Stones are maybe worlds greatest Rock'N'Roll bands and true and greatest legends of rock. But musically only Purple remains as great as they were 40 years ago.

All in all, if yuo like great show, great stage-set and light effects, buy Rolling Stones, or Madonna, or Justin Timberlake's DVD...

but if you think that MUSIC comes first, and you love MUSIC & TRUE ROCK'N'ROLL, go and buy Deep Purple - Live At Montreux 2006, or Live In Birmingham 2002...

3130634,4,B0014DZ2XC,"One thing which has been (surprisingly) overlooked in the many reviews here is the fact that Mick was obviously in poor vocal shape at the time of the filming. He can't hit the high notes or hold a note, particularly in the earlier part of the concert. He has to resort to half talking/half singing and sounds somewhat like a rather poor Mick Jagger imitator.

One plus of this is that you can actually make out the words to the lyrics when he's in this mode.

Later in the concert he loosens up a bit vocally, but never reaches the 'normal' Mick sound.

Keith gets a couple of vocals and has never sounded better, IMHO. His usually reedy, thin voice has some uumph this time out.

Shine A Light is crap filming at its best, and Scorsese should be embarrassed for calling it his own.
The description is way off in that it leads one to believe Scorsese is going to chronicle the great and mighty careers of the Stones, with great behind the scenes footage of their tour, but in fact it's obviously a video project he made for the 'ego'-driven Bill Clinton.  Why not just state what it is, a video of a benefit concert for Bill and his global warming BS, and let the renting public decide whether they want to view it from there???  Why lie (or excuse me, let me restate that for the Libs out there, 'misstate'.) about the contents???
Audio mixing is terrible, and his cuts to the overly-used snipets of past Stone interviews seem to be hastily and shoddily thrown in without any rhyme or reason.
Camera shots are typical, little if any 'great behind the scenes footage', and jeez, do ya think the Clinton's need more air time????
Also, why is it that Scorsese feels he needs to get his mug in this 'crapumentary' at every chance he can find?
Anyways, the good is;
Mick is great at being Mick in that he cares not even for the great Scorsese.  He really doesn't seem to care when, or even if, he will provide Scorsese with a set list, but ends up capitulating and provides one to the great director as the lights are coming up on the show.
The Beacon looked awesome and seeing the Stones in such a small setting is cool.
Keith Richard's made me laugh when he disses Clinton after shaking hands with him with his' Boy am I Bushed' comment.
I loved Charlie Watt's response and expression when finding out that he'll have to endure a receiving line of 30 of Bill's buddies.
Some good appearances, but one of the biggest downers was Mick's voice was no where near ready for this show, and who the hell tuned Keith's guitars????

3130644,4,B0014DZ2XC,"For over two hours these guys make you forget they've been going at on stage for more than 45 years.  Mick is as silky smooth as ever.  Keith and Ron work their magic on stage and Charlie keeps the rhythm as always.  The energy level is so high that Mick takes a break at one point, turning the concert over to Keith and Ron who do a little trip down memory lane with ""You Got the Silver"" and ""Connection,"" before he struts back on stage for ""Sympathy for the Devil.""  Many of the cuts are off their 1978 album, Some Girls, including a very nice version of ""Far Away Eyes"" with Ron Wood on dobro.  Buddy Guy joins the boys on ""Champagne and Reefer,"" with other guest appearances by a sultry Christina Aguilera, who Mick can't resist feeling up on ""Live with Me,"" and Jack White on ""Loving Cup.""

This is first and foremost a concert film, and Scorcese did little to interfere with that.  He interweaves the concert with some nice fill-ins of vintage interviews and short concert takes, having fun with the thematic question, ""How Long Will You Guys Keep Going?""  There isn't the backstage banter between songs that characterized his wonderful rendition of The Band's Last Waltz.  You get a little pre-concert black and white footage as Martin, Mick and the boys argue over how best to capture the performance, but then the Stones never were that revealing, preferring to crack jokes or dismiss questions all together as we see in the snippets of interviews.

The Stones still capture the spirit of their early anarchist days when everything they did seemed to rock the establishment, whether they meant it to or not.  There are references to Mick getting arrested and having to face a board of distinguished British gentlemen as to the morality of his conduct.  Also, a reference to their notorious Altamont concert that was the subject of ""Gimme Shelter.""  The funny part is that if Mick was ever an anarchist he was a reluctant one, as he dodges question after question in the vintage interviews with an amusingly respectful tone.  Keith is more brusque, and Charlie simply doesn't say anything at all.

They let the songs speak for themselves.  Some sound better than others over the long haul.  Mick takes ""Just My Imagination"" back to its Temptations roots, giving it more of a Doo Wop feel.  He emboldens ""Sympathy with the Devil"" with a hard driving rhythm and closes with a rousing rendition of ""Satisfaction,"" the only times these guys seem to show their age as Keith appears visibly relieved that the show is over.  Martin gives the camera to Mick as the guys leave through the back door of the Beacon Theatre, pulling back from upper Broadway to a moonlit light over New York.",1230595200,,2687,4.678723404255319

Highlight would be Buddy Guy's appearance if there is one.",1230508800,3,371,4.636363636363637

I have been a Stones fan for 75% of my 6 decades, which implies that I am the right age for this movie, which is easily the best of the century so far. In its genre and from my perspective, ie as a fan, not as a movie critic. One of the nicest scenes of the film is the piece of the TV interview with Jagger in 72, when he is asked if he can see himself doing what he does still at 60. He smiles and says: easily! yes, that's the spirit!
Another favorite snippet: Jagger asks Watts to say hello to the audience. Watts takes the mike and says: hello! Jagger jubilant: he speaks!
2 hours of a concert interrupted by brief scenes from old TV coverage. 2 hours of unadulterated fun with Britain's most durable export item. Well, almost unadulterated. There are some Americans here. Some stars like Bill Clinton and Buddy Guy. Or greater stars like Jack White and Christina Aguilera. Of course the competent background choir and band.
And let's not forget, quite frankly, the main cast looks straight out of a prequel to Pirates of the Caribean. The Mystery of the Everrolling Stones. As Keith says, alone they are quite lousy, but together, they are better than ten others. Typical British understatement.",1229299200,3,1238,4.53125
3130647,5,B0014DZ2XC,"This film is a brilliant documentary/concert depicting the Rolling Stones as still one of the most enduring popular music acts. The great thing about this film, besides being another fantastic effort from Martin Scorsese, probably the best music-documentary filmmaker of all time (he should have done the Chuck Berry 60th birthday gig), is that the viewer actually feels that they are part of the film and on stage with the Stones! This well constructed film follows the Stones, who are on tour, to a charity concert in New York. It's in an intimate theater setting which was specially designed for this movie. Not at all like some of the previous Stones concerts at Stadium venues!

The photography and sound are first rate. Guitarists will love the close-ups of Keith and Ronnie, as well as the selection of guitars (Telecasters, Gibsons, a Guild and others) that Richards uses. The song selection is superb and well recorded and while the film is a documentary it is full of personal touches regarding the making of the film, old interview footage, conversations and even a few problems.

My only criticism of this film is that they didn't get Bill Wyman to return for it as a retrospective and that they didn't include at least some historical footage of Brian Jones - who really founded this band and got the Blues going in England. Ok, you can't have everything.

The band is truly amazing. The Stones modernized their sound by augmenting their live shows with horns, background vocals and even strings. However, a highlight are the vocals of the lovely Lisa Fischer, whose brilliant LP ""So Intense"" (check it out) won a well-deserved Grammy in about 1991 and then mysteriously disappeared from the scene, because of many problems - some business- only to reappear with the Stones. She also sang with Tina Turner.

There of course have been a lot of reviews of this film as you would expect, so I won't go through the entire set list. I feel the three best tunes in this film are (1) ""Just My Imagination"" - I have always respected Mick Jagger as vocalist who would do covers of the great soul artists. He did early versions of Wilson Pickett, Solomon Burke and Otis Redding tunes (that takes GUTS). In the late 1960s the Stones did a cover of the Temptations ""My Girl"", after it had already been a number one tune. Wow! It was not that good. This tune, a later hit by the Temps, is just brilliant. A great arrangement, tasteful solo by Keith, and a great overall rock-soul feel. This is the best tune in the set.

(2) ""Champagne and Reefer,"" with Buddy Guy is also fantastic. Buddy plays in tune (great) and the song is really dedicated to Muddy Waters who originally recorded it. Buddy was a longtime session man at Chess Records in Chicago and played for years with Muddy. I also liked Mick's blues harp in this tune, it recalls the first two Stones' LPs when he did some of the first Blues harmonica heard by white kids in America on tunes like ""Little By Little"" and ""I'm A King Bee"".

(3) The third best tune, I feel, is the Brian Jones influence in this concert. It is ""Paint It Black"". This is the best of the bonus tunes and shows the Stones great writing ability. They pegged this tune in the late 1960s with the ""Flower Power"" days and of course, Brian, the multi-instrumentalist, learned to play sitar better than George Harrison did. Anyway this tune still sounds fantastic today!

This is a must have DVD for all Scorsese, Stones, Rock or Blues or Film fans. Great price, great production, good history and a personal feel that we always get from Martin's films. This will be a classic in years to come.",1227916800,7,3623,4.642745709828393

3130650,5,B0014DZ2XC,"This film begins with a farcical look at preparations for the upcoming Beacon Theatre show in New York but once the Stones storm the stage it's all about the music. From the opening notes of Jumping Jack Flash it's clear this music is in their blood. Whether it's Ronny's machine gunning the audience with the neck of his guitar. Or, the anger in Mick's face when he burst on stage ripping into Jumping Jack Flash, everything about this band says ""let's go!""
While it's mostly lesser known '70's era songs, there are the '60's classics as well. Sadly, the most recent release is '83's ""She was Hot"", with Ms. Lisa Fischer and Mick gyrating wildly to this song. It's much better live.
The three cameos are good. Jack White is adequate. But it's Buddy Guy and Christina Aguilera stealing the show. During Guy's cameo, ""Champagne and Reefer"", we see Keith and Buddy's duelling guitar act. Then, Ronnie on third guitar and Mick on harmonica, all four legends standing in a circle, toe to toe tearing the house down. Ms. Aguilera surprisingly belts out the duet on ""Live with Me"" that should make any queen of soul proud.
The Beacon Theatres' intimacy is magnified during ""Far Away Eyes"", when Keith botches the lyrics and a fan ribs him. He laughs back ""Shut up"". Fans should watch for several instances of clever reworking of some lyrics. The preacher in Far Away Eyes now asks for twenty dollars, up from ten. Inflation I guess.
Martin Scorese's best known rock documentary is ""The Last Waltz"". It was the final performance of Dylan's former touring band, ""The Band"" in 1976. His latest foray into rock documentaries is a resounding success. He does a wonderful job interweaving obscure ancient clips of interviews and performances of the Stones, bringing perspective to their amazing longevity.
The last song of the encore is ""Satisfaction"". Near the end it sounds as if Charlie is about to lift the song onto a new level and continue to rock on, but it turns out to be a classy way to end a classic. Satisfaction indeed.",1227312000,,2020,4.7252124645892355
3130651,4,B0014DZ2XC,"... but geez, they're looking OLD. Mick Jagger was born the same year I was, and he has ten times the energy I do, but I have to say their act is getting a bit tired.  As others have noted, this is an ""oldies"" concert, with nary a new song in the mix. Mick's duets with Buddy Guy and Christina Aguilera add a bit of freshness, and Keith Richards' uncanny resemblance to Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp reportedly based his character on Richards) is entertaining as well.  A fun time overall.",1227139200,,493,4.406593406593407
3130652,5,B0014DZ2XC,"One notably good movie I've seen lately, on Blu-ray. Martin Scorsese's ""Shine a Light"" filming of some live Rolling Stones concerts is not only great, good music, but one of the best examples of the possibilities of HD 1080p TV and Blu-ray. Mick Jagger (and Ron Wood) look like gargoyles. Mick is amazingly thin and spry for some one who is 65 years old, if memory serves, and bounces all over the stage, like he did in his twenties, like a cricket who drank a lot on coffee. Keith Richards looks like a zombie undead superannuated version of Captain Jack Sparrow. Charlie Watts, who must be nearly 70, now looks the youngest of the lot. But it's all about the music!

Beautiful, sexy guest Christine Aguilera and sings and jumps around in the highest pair of spike heeled boots I've ever seen a woman be able to stand on - must be 5-6 inch heels? While she looks really sweet, she shrieks the lyrics.

The music in the film, despite the guests, is much better when Jagger sings alone. Typical of the great Rock concerts the Stones have been doing for 40+ years. We never thought they would be when they started out, but the Stones have become the default Kings of Rock after the breakup of other groups like the Beatles, Doors, CSNY etc. That having been said, their best tunes still come from the sixties and early seventies, best from their period on London records and when Brian Jones was alive, ""Let it Bleed"" and before.

Intercut in this is parts of a mid `60's interview with Jagger and the Stones, like Scorsese used in his definitive Dylan documentary ""No Direction Home""!

Buddy Guy helps Mick sing the Muddy Waters blues song ""Champagne and Reefer"". Unfortunately, Guy shouts the lyrics, overloads the mike and makes the anti-cocaine message nearly unintelligible.

 The Stones music is loud and concert-like and the Blu-Ray sound will test the limits of your sound system.

But the most amazing thing is the video effects, the huge array of high intensity lights and strobe lights which Scorsese shoots off repeatedly and uses to backlight and then solarize Mick Jagger to a complete white.
This is what Blu-Ray can do!

3130654,3,B0014DZ2XC,"""Can you picture yourself doing this at the age of 60?""

""Yeah, sure.""

I thought that was the neatest line in this concert-documentary when Mick Jagger gave an honest and prophetic answer to that question, some 30 or more years ago (maybe closer to 40!). We see that short interview here on this concert DVD.

Not only Mick but Keith Richard, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood just keep going and going and going. Anyway, this film is 95 percent concert and five percent talk, so those who think this is a documentary are going to be disappointed. The talk includes old interviews and an opening segment with the director trying to work with the group which, as we see, isn't easy. For those who want more documentary material, check out the 16-minute featurette which comes with the DVD. There is some great material on that, reflections by a few of the guys, some nice acoustic guitar work and a better chance to see what they guys are like in rehearsal.

As far as this concert - held at the Beacon Theater in New York City - goes, it's about average for the Stones. The 2003 concerts at NYC's Madison Square Garden and the earlier ones in London, Berlin, Turin, and other places around the world seem more dynamic than this one, because of the bigger stage and audience. At the smaller venue of the Beacon, we couldn't enjoy the big props, neon scoreboards, the boys walking down the long aisle for a small set in the middle of the crowd, Mick prancing down long sides of the stage, etc. The prancing and all that is still here but it's in a confined area, almost claustrophobic at times.

It was fun here and there to see old clips of the band being interviewed when they were only in their second and third years of touring. You get an idea of the inane questions reporters have probably asked the rock group a thousand times over. The Stones, especially drummer Charlie Watts, don't exactly sound like Rhodes scholars, either! Watts seems out of place, too, but - being the family man he is - that's always been the case. Everyone loves Charlie, though, and respects him - maybe because he is different from the rest.

I thought I would prefer to hear new material instead of the same old/same old, but as it turned out, this two-hour concert was best in the last 40 minutes when the band did the familiar upbeat songs. The concert seemed to come to life with ""Sympathy For The Devil"" and four or five other old-time favorites. Earlier, the electricity was missing on a bunch of the numbers that you don't usually hear. Maybe this would have had a much higher impact on me had I seen it in an IMAX theater, instead of a TV on a small screen.

There were sparks flying, however, when the three guests sang and played with the group. Jack White, Buddy Guy and Christina Aguliera all brought life to the concert. Being a blues fan, I liked Guy's number best. One of the strangest moments - and maybe the most revealing - was the closeup shot of drummer Charlie Watts yawning after one number and looking very tired and bored. Hey, after all these years....he's entitled but it gave us a quick reminder just how old these guys are (mid '60s). I don't think director Martin Scorcese, whose slick cinematography in his films is fun to watch, did these guys a favor, in that regard. He makes them all look and sound as old as they really are and, hey, that's not the Stones. They jump around like 20-year-olds. They'll go on forever, right?",1226448000,3,3437,4.507223113964687
3130655,1,B0014DZ2XC,"My problem with this is in both the performance and the filming. I can understand that The Stones have played some of these songs to death, But when they just slop through the parts, ignoring the original precision of how they put they notes together to create such great songs, its just disappointing. If you hear a performance of Beethoven's 9th Symphony where the musicians just having fun ""estimating"" the original written parts, it would suck. As much as I hate to say it, I'd rather listen a sound-alike Stones copy band who still respects the original music play these songs than the Stones themselves.
  And the audience? Where the long hair freaks? Is this really the Stones audience? A bunch of hot young girls and stock broker types in the front rows? I guess they either got invited by Scorsese because they'd look good on film or were rich enough to get tickets from the scalpers
  Watch the Altamont perfommance or RnR Circus, C***Sucker Blues to see these tired old impostors when they were THE STONES!!!...and an audience that was into the music, not into looking cool,

As concert footage goes, the pictures are sharp and clear and creative, as one would expect from Martin S, but one is left thinking it could have been so much better.  I was fortunate enough to see the Stones during the Bigger Bang tour and the film does not begin to capture the raw energy of their live show---perhaps because this film was shot in the Beacon Theater in front of a small, obviously wealthy and pampered crowd rather than the blue-collar folks who made the Stones what they are.
As John Lennon once said---those of you in the cheap seats, feel free to applaud, and those in the front, feel free to rattle your jewelry.
This show does not capture the sheer joy of a Stones concert because it is so atypical of a Stones concert.  The Stones played better in front of a million in Rio than in front of a few hundred in the Beacon.",1224201600,4,1114,4.393203883495145

This is not a documentary on the Rolling Stones but rather an extended dvd of one concert. Nothing really stands out here. All in all very avoidable.

If Mick is so strapped for cash he can sell 5 or 6 of his homes.  I have only watched about 1/2 of the movie and am having a hard time finding a reason to finish it.  Sure the video is very clear (should be for an IMAX) and the sound is good but not great.  They really are way past their prime, like 15 years or more past.  The songs at times are sloppy and unrecognizable until they do actually sing a line clear and you go oh that's it.  That Jack White dude was down right bad.  They should have edited him out of the film.  It may have been better with Jack Black singing and playing guitar.  Buddy Guy was pretty good and I wish he had stayed out there longer.  It seemed to wake up Keith from his coma.  At times it looks like Mick is not happy at all and I think he knows they do not sound good at all.  Can Keith actually play his guitar anymore???  Keith doing You Got The Silver was real bad.  Like your drunk cousin at one of those karaoke bars.  So sad.

I wish they would just hit the studio and do a couple more albums and by then you'll all be 70 and time to hang up the guitars for sure.  Do an oldies rock n roll cover album.  Do a blues cover album.  Just don't hit the road again.  It looks like Keith may very well hit the road...face first real soon.  Your legacy is written in stone forever.

Some of the film shows a benefit concert hosted by President Clinton, who seemed so excited and happy to introduce the Stones on stage.

It's much cheaper than seeing them on stage.  But, there's nothing like seeing the greatest rock-n-roll band live.  My husband wouldn't take me to see them recently here in the 'Vegas area (but then again, he doesn't like my music).  I, however, managed to see the Stones a few years ago---and all I could say was it was money well spent.

3130675,4,B0014DZ2XC,"Scorcese and the Stones are both titans in their vocations.  With this stature comes a natural creative tension, humorously played up in the start of the film as Scorcese begs for a set list and the Stones mischeviously hold out on him.  The show itself is very good, but we have all seen Stones films before.

The biggest, baddest band of all time can still crank out the energy and volume, but it is in the quiet moments that Scorcese's efforts really pay off. He sprinkles in old interview footage that is ironic, funny and insightful, particularly in the present day follow-up.  I have been a Stones fan for a long time and the film only enhanced my belief that these guys are really talented and very smart, often toying with all of us as they do their thing.

Do not miss the extra footage: Great footage of the soundcheck; despite the reputation, these guys are consumate professionals who really love their work. Scorcese requested Factory Girl, which did not make the movie, but Ronnie, Keith and Mick jam on it with no one around. Funny and real exchanges with the band and Buddy Guy and Bill Clinton.  Keith quietly noodling on stage, pleased to be doing what he loves to do; eyes closed, picking away. Now that is something  I could watch all day.",1221091200,3,1259,4.568888888888889

However, what makes this film outstanding is the sound quality; it's so much better than in other DVDs of their concerts that I own. You can crank it up if you want to rock out but you can also pick out subtle remarks between the players, as when Keith gives Buddy Guy his guitar at the end of the show-stopping 'Champagne and Reefer'.

I have the latest BluRay player (as of Aug 2008): the Pioneer Elite BDP-05FD, with the latest firmware (1.02). This BD takes FOREVER to just give me the splash screen (over a minute: a minute in fact to the ""loading"" animation). THen about half the time, it freezes: no pause, no chapter skip, nothing but a blank screen. Ejection and restarting is the only cure. This might be a defective BD, but there is no message. The same issue occurs on my Playstation 3...

BluRay is still just getting started, and there continue to be teething issues. I have about 10 other BDs now, and Shine a Light is the ONLY one with these sorts of issues. Sigh.

although the stones sounded pretty much like i thought they would, not great; i was disappointed with scorcese, because i expected something in 'the last waltz' vein, but this doesn't come close. this is not a concert dvd that i will be going back to very often. my expectations were too high, but i should have known better. in 'the last waltz' ""the band"" knew when it was time to go their separate ways; the stones should have also realized that a long time ago. it would have saved them the embarrassment of playing at the super bowl. have they no pride? i guess, for them,especially in the recent past, it was always for the money.

3130690,3,B0014DZ2XC,"First off, I am a world class Stones fan. I am also a Scorsese fan. I don't see what this great director added to the Stones legacy. There are plenty of Rolling Stones concerts from the last twenty years on DVD. The last two tours were heavily documented by the Stones themselves. This production is nothing special. I think some of the concerts filmed by the Stones are better. The only thing to sell this particular product with is the inclusion of songs not previously on DVD, such as Tears Go By and She Was Hot. Jack White's duet was not particularly good. Christina Aguilera's was better, and Buddy Guy was probably the best of the star turns. But this is not riveting stuff. The fans need a more historical documentary, since 25X5 has never been issued on DVD. There has to be a ton of interesting footage from Brian Jones onward. Go ask Bill Wyman, he's probably got the motherlode squirreled away. As for 'Shine A Light', I don't get it. What did Martin Scorsese add?",1219708800,4,976,4.519774011299435

3130693,5,B0014DZ2XC,"I have been a Rolling Stones fan since the 60's when I first bought and wore out my ""45"" of 'Honky Tonk Women'. Being a musician, it's hard not to criticize the playing of Keith now, as it seems he is playing when and whatever he ""feels"" live, but who am I to say anything negative about a guy in his mid 60's who still rocks as good as anyone!....and that goes for all the original members!

 The boys are having a grand old time and Mick's energy is amazing, even though some of the lyrics seem rushed, but once again.... who can say anything to a man who has sang the same songs thousands of times! While the band is solid, I do miss Bill Wyman's unique bass playing and Jack White's vocals on his duet with Jagger are embarrassing! Buddy Guy's ""sit in"" seems natural and is very good and although Christine Aguilera can sing, she has no business being on stage with these guys! Watts is great as usual and he keeps the band in sync.

I probably would have liked this set even more if I didn't have so many other DVD's from the same time period to compare it to. First off, there is nothing really new in this film, that wasn't done as well or better in 'Biggest Bang' or 'Four Flicks' DVD sets except a few welcome rarely done songs. The sound quality is excellent, but the mix is horrendous! Buried guitars one minute and then a big crunch from the decrepit finger's of Keith slugging along his guitar neck the next! Even with it's flaws, I completely enjoyed watching this film, as it shows one of the most important rock bands of all time still doing their thing the way they choose to do it!

Rock on boys!

3130694,3,B0014DZ2XC,"...with no visible baby boomers in the audience!

Not bad, but there are problems with this film:

1. Not a single song more recent than 1983, in spite of the fact that the Stones have released 5 albums since then. As someone who became a fan of the band while in high school in the 80s, I've always seen them as a still-working band and creative entity, not as a nostalgia act. How many live versions of ""Satisfaction"" do we need?

2. Fooling with mix levels; so that if I'm looking at Keith Richards his guitar suddenly jumps out of the mix and becomes louder, then fades back into the band when the camera cuts away. Lame. As if to tell viewers, ""see, this guy plays the sound you're hearing now!"" The height of this lameness is when you see someone in the audience hold up a camera (probably a digital camera) and the filmmakers have actually OVERDUBBED the sound of a vintage camera shutter being clicked...as if you could hear that over the band at full volume.

3. Audience seems to be stocked with young model-types, not real fans.

4. Offers nothing new that other recent Stones concert videos have not already provided. 4 Flicks is better than this in every way...and more honest.

5. Not enough long, lingering close-ups of the lovely Lisa Fischer.

3130699,5,B0014DZ2XC,"Martin Scorcese is hitting on all cylinders lately. With the exception of his PBS Blues series which he fumbled by out-placing (it should have been more like Burn's Jazz), Scorcese has produced some of the best music documentaries/concerts ever: ""The Last Waltz"" (Muddy was amazing but The Band was brilliant behind everyone, especially the Staples on ""The Weight""), Lightnin' In A Bottle (which made up for what he did not do in ""The Blues""), ""No Way Back Home"" his brilliant Documentary (done as he should have done ""the Blues""), ""Shine A Light"" (The high point for me was Keith spontaneously and appropriately giving Buddy Guy his guitar as if only Buddy deserved to play the next note on it), and even his short documentation of The Band in ""Woodstock."" The only thing left to do is to dig deep and unearth the full story of Sonny Boy Williamson II -- I have 300 hours of oral history revealing his amazing story and Reelin-in-the-years has the AFBF footage of him in brilliant performances. Call me Martin and you can complete the cycle. Muddy, Honeyboy, Pinetop, Robert Johnson, Junior Wells and Buddy Guy have been done to death but all connected with Sonny Boy Williamson and Robert Lockwood Jr. But who was really at the crossroads with Robert Johnson?",1218931200,,1261,4.815668202764977
3130700,5,B0014DZ2XC,"This is a fascinating ""live concert"" movie.  Martin Scorsese, who also directed The Band's ""The Last Waltz,"" does a nice job of simply capturing the spirit of this concert.  There is a gritty reality to this concert and ancillary material; it is clear to all viewers that the Rolling Stones have lived a long time, as their age shows on their faces. The fact that they can still rock and roll is truly amazing.

There are some welcome guests on this DVD--Jack White, Christine Aguilera, and, most welcome of all, the legendary Buddy Guy. There are also the keyboard players and horn section, featuring golden oldie Stones' partners, such as Bobby Keys. And, of course, Darryl Jones, who is the bass player. But it's the four Stones, three of whom have been around since the very beginning, that make this concert work. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, and Charlie Watts are still rocking in their mid-60s; Ronnie Wood, relative newcomer, keeps up with them nicely.

The DVD opens with grainy black and white footage of Scorsese and the Stones discussing the movie.  Scorsese wants to begin nailing down details, and the Stones don't even give him the playlist until just before the concert and its recording take place at ""The Beacon,"" a fairly intimate setting. The Stones, in short, only appear grudgingly to cooperate with Scorsese.

The concert is recorded in color, with guests such as Bill and Hillary Clinton. Interspersed throughout the movie are old interviews with the Rolling Stones over time, providing some sense of who they are as individuals.

Maybe the best way to proceed is simply to note a sampling of songs and provide my impression of what I observed and heard.  The concert begins, in classic fashion, with one of the glorious rockers of all time--""Jumping Jack Flash."" Mick looks old, his voice does not have the range of his youth, but he can still sing a compelling version of this song.  Keith Richards' guitar licks, Ronnie Wood's playing, Charlie Watts' drumming (sounds like a series of controlled explosions), Darryl Jones solid bass work all blend well together. It is stunning to see the energy and even pleasure that the old timers have playing this iconic song. The cameras do a nice job of capturing this and other songs.

""Shattered."" One of my favorites (I like to juxtapose this with another song about New York City--""Hot Stuff""; the tone and atmospherics are so different!). Jagger can still prance around with high energy.

""Some Girls."" Toned down for the concert!  Mick Jagger joins Ronnie and Keith on guitar and it looks like they're enjoying the moment.

""Champagne and Reefer,"" an old Chicago blues song.  Buddy Guy, the great blues player, joins the Stones.  His guitar work is spare but powerful.  It's fun to watch him exchange licks with Keith and Ronnie; it's also fun to listen to his singing, joining Jagger on vocals. Mick's harmonica work adds a nice element, too.

Other cool performances abound (other reviewers list the actual songs played, so I won't duplicate). Some random thoughts.  The audience spontaneously singing ""woo woo"" during ""Sympathy for the Devil""; interactions of the backup singers with Jagger on several songs; the group's version of one of the Temptations' greatest works, ""Just My Imagination.""

And, one final brace of songs--""Brown Sugar."" The guitars start this off with the great guitar sound and riff.  Jagger joins in with the lyrics speaking of slavery in the old South, with lines like ""Gold coast slave ship bound for cotton fields"" and people being ""sold in a market down in New Orleans."" Then, finally, ""Satisfaction."" As soon as the listener hears the fuzz tone, you know that Keith is going to kick this song off.  Over forty years after its release, this rocker sounds as great as when it first came out, although the singers' voices are not as youthful as then and although their faces are deeply lined with evidence of the years that have passed.

The extras are nice, but I never pay much attention to those on DVDs.  Scorsese has nicely captured a Stones' concert and the group's spirit.  They can still be cantankerous, but they can also still rock.  All in all, a fine DVD.",1218585600,7,4169,4.862800565770863

3130702,3,B0014DZ2XC,"This concert video was fine, and I suppose people like the fact that it was directed by a famous director. The director's name alone catches the casual fan's attention. I really like the Stones and have watched plenty of concert footage. But this is most definitely not their best performance on video. Jagger's voice is a little rough and unsteady and the band just does not sound very tight on this night for some reason. Plus, the expert concert videographers have done much better jobs than Scorsese at capturing the energy of the Stones. If you really want to see some great Stones concert action and hear the band at its very best, check out the multi-disc set ""Four Flicks"" captured during the worldwide Forty Licks tour. The band's performances and the filming blow this little concert out of the water.  Go ahead and rent ""Shine A Light"".  If you like what you see, then you owe it to yourself to BUY ""Four Flicks"" and spend some real time with the Stones on the road at their very best.  The bonus materials on ""Four Flicks"" include plenty of behind the scenes action as well.",1218499200,,1086,4.587628865979381
3130703,3,B0014DZ2XC,"The Good: the film is staged, shot, lit and (visually) edited extremely well; Mick Jagger has emerged from his tunnel of self-parody and carries the film on his energetic old man shoulders, his voice as strong and as accurate as ever, his lithe little body defying all the rules that apply to most sixty-plus year old bodies; they don't play any of the crap music they've written in the past few decades, sticking to oldies and standards.

The Bad: the Rolling Stones suck as a rock and roll band now, a guitar driven rock and roll band, that is; Keith Richards is mesmerizing in a ""What is that thing?"" kind of way, but as a guitar player, nope. The unfriendly way to put it would be to say he's lost his chops or has forgotten how to play all the riffs that made him one of the greatest rock songwriters of all time. The friendly way to put it would be to say he doesn't know the difference between what he feels and what he plays--all the riffs and rhythms circulate through his bloodstream perfectly but the technology doesn't exist to send them through the sound reproduction system so all we get is what pulses to his finger tips--all we hear is his accompaniment to his inner self. His approximations to the riffs of ""Tumblin' Dice"" and ""Brown Sugar"" are almost forgivable but his butchering of ""Start Me Up"" is not.

Ronnie Wood. He may be a fine guitar player but he doesn't play well with others. It's as if he doesn't listen to, or hear, what other members of the band are doing. A couple of the film's highlights are the two songs Keith sings featuring Ronnie as the sole guitarist. He plays great acoustic (slide) guitar on ""You Got the Silver"" and rocks well on ""Connection."" Throw him into the mix and he plays junk. As soon as you want to excuse either Keith or Ronnie because they are old, Buddy Guy, seventy-plus years old, comes on stage and makes clear what it sounds like when the first thing a good guitar player does is listen to what other people in the band are doing.

The Beautiful: Mick singing ""As Tears Go By"" accompanied by Keith on 12-string acoustic. Perfect.

The Bizarre: with the caveat that I watched and listened to this film on a standard television set so I don't know what the Dolby 5.1 sounds like, the audio mixing practice of boosting the sound level of the performer in the visual edit, down to single notes sometimes, sounds ridiculous. Luckily, Mick was the visual focus of most of the film, his vocals out front and clear.

The Disappointment: ""Lovin' Cup"" sans piano. Terrible.

The best parts of the film, and by that I mean the best songs in the film, are the minimal, simpler ones. It's too bad there aren't enough of them. Mick Jagger can channel himself channeling himself all night long, he can be double-plus-good, but he doesn't have a band behind him any more. By showcasing the band's relationship to its music as product delivered to an audience, an audience of hand-picked, paid extras that also includes Bill and Hilary Clinton, Scorsese doesn't shine a light or bring any new insight to the Rolling Stones in this film.",1218240000,,3082,4.544144144144144

3130705,4,B0014DZ2XC,"The film portion of Shine a Light (documentary style old interview clips et.) is woven nicely into the surprisingly theatrical set of live music.  The guest spots are hit and miss, Buddy Guy steals the entire show, and walks away with Keith's guitar in the process.  Martin Scorcese ""character"" director gets his personality into more than just the lens this time and is a character in the film at the beginning at least.  The music hums along and it takes awhile to get going but by the middle of this set when Mick starts to really perform (Far Away Eyes) that this film turns into a truly theatrical and cinematic experience.  At moments a true rock show that encompasses a gargantuan career on both sides of the camera, it might not be lightning in a bottle but its some kind of thunder in a jar at the very least.

3130706,5,B0014DZ2XC,"If you are a Stones fan, then just buy it and enjoy; the negative reviewers miss the point. Towards the end of a long and fantastic career it's all about the band having fun; for the viewer its all about watching them experience that joy. And if you feel the need to quibble about the price or production values, then you shouldn't be buying such a DVD in the first place. The BluRay looks wonderful and the concert is nice and 'up close'. One of the most interesting aspects is watching how MJ tries to control the band with a raised eyebrow or nod here and there, or moving to gently push KR back to center when he goes 'off the plot'. It beats me why anyone would quibble on little details that aren't relevant to the central theme - its a celebration of one of the world's true entertainment super-groups. Relax.",1217721600,43,816,4.375
3130707,4,B0014DZ2XC,"As a concert video Shine A Light does ok.  Yes it looks very nice on Blu-ray, though I would quibble a bit about the sound, or specifically the tone of the sound in the audios.  I'm sure I'm more used to the over-produced and over-compensated sound that comes from the studio mixing that happens before songs make it to the radio air waves, but the tone in several of the Mick Jagger vocals here just seemed off.  It's also, of course, entirely possible that Jagger's voice has changed over the many years that he's been singing these songs and others.

Getting back to the video quality on the Blu-ray (I can't speak for the DVD releases, having only seen the Blu-ray version), someone elsewhere had quipped that most people probably wouldn't want to see this film on Blu-ray as Keith Richards and Mick Jagger are not images that one would normally want to see in HD.  The softer images of say VHS might be much better and more forgiving for the facial features that have long since aged, as well as the boney arms and other signs of all of the various wear and tear the Rolling Stones members have endured. Outside of Charlie Watts, who looks fairly normal, the rest of the Stones look like they could be extras in the latest mummy movie (extras as in mummies themselves).  Jagger has long since looked more and more like the crypt keeper.  Keith Richards, well, he's Keith Richards.  His physical embodiment is truly that of a walking corpse, having spent many of his years on Earth living a life of excess.  Ron Wood is a less obviously worn than either Jagger or Richards, but he too is no spring chicken.  Seeing any of them in HD can be a relatively shocking sight {the reviewer smiles wryly as he types this...}

On the other hand the guitar work is interesting to watch and Jagger still demonstrates an energy level that is nothing short of phrenetic.  As noted in the quick summary for the product page, Keith Richards actually delivers a nice solo performance despite his own appearance.

What brings this film into a more valued range isn't the wasted footage of Scorsese fretting over not knowing what the song list will be, or his concerns for where the cameras will be (or the concerns over the band members for same).  It's also not the included meet & greet with the Clintons.  It's the archival interview and news reel type footage that is included and intermixed within the concert footage.  Seeing some of those images shows stark contrast of the Stones in their youthful days and appearances compared to the shells we get to see in the performances here.  Images such as Jagger's boyish looks that hint at what was come, but just as easily seem unbelievable for anyone that has seen the Stones in the last 20 years.  There's a bit of playful banter and discussion about the guitar skills of both Wood and Richards that is interesting as well.

3130708,4,B0014DZ2XC,"It's hard to go wrong here - Great band, great director and a great venue. But I just can't give it 5 stars. 4.5 would be just about right.

I would have preferred that this was just a straight up concert film. Interviews and clips before the show are fine, but once the music starts why not just focus on what the band does best - rock the stage? And why was the one truncated song Keith's Connection? That just wasn't right.

I was also disappointed in the mix. The overall quality was fine, but someone in the editing bay just couldn't resist toying with the levels. As the camera focuses on different players during the show there really is no need to bump their volume. A straight-up mix would have been better and less distracting.

Buddy Guy and Jack White were fantastic, but Christina Aguilera just didn't fit with the Stones well. My biggest quibble is that, like many current pop stars, the fashion is to sing flat. I've never liked it and it resulted in an off pitch duet here. I would have rather seen Sheryl Crow on stage for a reprise of Honky Tonk Women from the Four Flicks Garden show, but that's just me.

Boy, has the music suffered. My daughter asked me why all the songs sounded the same. Sympathy for the Devil had Mick trying to do the ""who who"" vocals and they came out more as ""whee whee"". Well, and what can you say about Keith? He tried hard and came up short. The numerous closeups did't help either. Mick tried continuously to bring up the level of the crowd to that wonderful point when the band and audience become one organic whole, and he almost succeeded with Brown Sugar. But then it died.

I can't accept a music DVD with poor sound and that's what this one had. Poor, very poor. Poor to the point that I had to strain to indentify the songs. I'd like to blame it on the DVD producer but they had all the technology there to capture what the band pumped out. So what happened?

The audience at a rock concert is suppose to get into the music, to sing the lyrics at the top of their lungs, to sweat and be tranformed. This audience was more frightened about getting run over by the umpteen moving cameras that had usurped the good seats in the front row. Stuffing a lot of young, beautiful people in the front row didn't help one bit either. Their reaction to the music looked, and probably was just a show.

3130711,3,B0014DZ2XC,"""Shine the Light"" is a concert film of The Rolling Stones at New York's Beacon Theater October 29 and November 1, 2006, directed by Martin Scorsese. It starts off with some footage of planning the documentary and chatting with celebrity guests, including the Clintons, pre-show. After 12 minutes of that, The Stones launch into ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"". They perform 19 songs, including 3 with guest artists Jack White, Buddy Guy, and Christina Aguilera. The camera is usually on stage but sometimes behind or in front of the audience, always taking care never to focus on any particular audience member. Archival interview footage of The Rolling Stones from the 1960s until recently is intercut with the concert footage.

The selection of interview footage is curious. It follows the band's responses to the same tired old questions over the years, questions about controversy, success, fame, drugs, longevity. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, and Ronnie Wood have always had the same matter-of-fact answers. Scorsese is trying to make a point. Point taken. But...

The Rolling Stones are not very exciting in concert anymore. Jagger and Watts are lively, and they all seem to be enjoying themselves. But these men lack the sexual energy, taunting rebelliousness, and bad boy demeanor that made them interesting to watch. They're old. Their influence and relevance belong to a bygone era. ""Shine a Light"" drives that home. I was bored. Almost by necessity, the theme is The Rolling Stone's longevity. I am as much in awe of the stamina and continued success of these 4 sexagenarians as anyone. But where Scorsese's 1978 film of The Band's farewell concert ""The Last Waltz"" was richly textured and featured musicians near their peak, ""Shine a Light"" documents a show without cultural significance by musicians well past their prime, and it shows.

The DVD (Paramount 2008): There are 4 bonus songs and a ""Supplemental Featurette"" (15 min) on the disc. The featurette is in the same style as the film, with archival interviews intercut with new footage, but it focuses on rehearsals for the concerts and includes some short conversations with the musicians. Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish, and French. Song lyrics are not subtitled.",1217462400,4,2264,5.146739130434782

3130716,5,B0014DZ2XC,"""Shine a Light"" captures the Stones at the end of a long tour and even longer career.  I saw them in Vegas about a week before this concert, and they were at their best.  Mick Jagger's father had just passed.  It's a great concert.  I also saw this film the day it opened.  I've seen the Stones four times, since the 69 tour, and all of their DVD's and/or movies.
Don't believe all these film school losers reviewing the film or wannabe rockers putting down the Stones because they're old.  Imagine film school students without credits putting down Martin Scorsese!  The guest stars, Christina, Buddy Guy, Jack White, rock.  One might wonder why they should buy ""Shine a Light"" as they already own Stone's DVD's, a fair question.  This film features songs from ""Some Girls"", the best Stone's album for 30 years:  ""Some Girls"" (but without the lyrics about black girls who just want to get...""; ""Just My Imagination""; ""Faraway Eyes"" (country song with hillbilly humor); and ""Shattered"".  Christina and Mick make the best Stone's duet since Tina Turner and Mick mixed it up for ""Live Aid"" on the ""Let it Bleed"" album classic, ""Live with Me"".  Buddy Guy gives the movie a party rousing ""Champagne & Reefer"", an old Muddy Water's song.  How appropriate, as the Stones took their name from a Muddy Water's song.  Never before on DVD have we seen the Stones perform Keith's song, ""Connection"", a very old song from the sixtie's ""Between the Buttons"" album.  Classics from ""Exile on Main Street"" also spice up the film:  ""All Down the Line""' ""Loving Cup"" (Jack White); ""Tumbling Dice""; and ""Shine a Light"".  Two of my favorite old Stone's songs from the 60's are here:  ""I'm Free"" and ""As Tears Go By"" from the ""december's children"" album.  Never before have we seen the Stone's play the 80's classic, ""She Was Hot"".  Beyond that their big hits, the standards, are all included:  ""Start Me Up""; ""Brown Sugar""; ""Paint it Black""; ""Satisfaction""; ""Little T&A""; and ""Jumpin Jack Flash"".
No, Mick doesn't jump as high or shout as loud as he did back in 1981, at his peak. But he still projects more energy onstage than most singers half of his age.  Time may no longer be on the side of the Stones, but I am.  I've been a Stones' fan since the 60's, and I see no reason to stop.  The Stones roll with style, power, and flair.  It's only the Rolling Stones, but I like it, like it, yes I do.  Reading some one these reviews, you'd think the Stones came out onstage on walkers and couldn't play their instruments.  Nothing is further from the truth.",1214352000,45,2535,4.612975391498882
3130717,5,B0014DZ2XC,"SIMPLY PUT, I LOVED THIS FILM AND ITS SOUNDTRACK!!!!  You can not treat yourself to a better experience than this!  From the opening introductory vignettes to the dazzling ending, I was just mesmerized.  I'm not the world's biggest Rolling Stones fan, though I am a fan of their music (not so much their lifestyles), and I have never been able to see them live, but this has to be the next best thing!  I was completely wowed by the stunning visual angles used in this movie, and felt that the soundtrack was an incredible overview of an amazing career.  I saw the movie four times, including in two different IMAX theatres and each time saw and heard new things!

The Rolling Stones are quite an amazing group of people and watching their chemistry onstage was just awesome.  I've seen a lot of rock concerts up close, and this one compares most favorably!  What charisma these guys have, even in their sixties!!!!  Everyone knows their musical and songwriting talent which spans decades, but watching this birds-eye view of their performing skills will knock you out.  Every member of this group seems to have such a unique and interesting performance personality, and their intriguing on stage relationships with each other only add to the excitement.  Buddy Guy, Jack White and Christina Aguilera were also amazing, each in his or her own right, providing clever and unusual foils for Mick jagger and Keith Richards.  I will never forget the trancelike expression on Buddy Guy's face as he traded guitar exchanges with Keith and vocal lines with  Mick.  Even Keith Richards was clearly moved, as he gave Guy the guitar he had just finished playing at the end of the song. Maybe my favorite moment though, was the explosive introduction of Mick Jagger into the theatre during the introduction to Sympathy for the Devil.  Gives me goosebumps thinking about it!

Even the backing members of this band were a true joy to watch and hear.  Each an accomplished musician/vocalist, they added a depth and range to this experience that I don't think I've ever seen in a live performance before. Even if it is too late to catch this masterpiece in IMAX, see it on the big screen if you can.  See it more than once if you can!!!!

They take Rock n' Roll they have done over the past 40 years and perform it in a way that allows it to be relevant Rock in 2008.  It is primal and strong.  Shine A Light even has country and of course, some great Blues.  Buddy Giles number with the Stones, ""Champaign and Refer"", is amazing.  Mick moves and rocks and Keith shows how he is a caring pirate.  Ronnie is amazing and of course, the Stones drumming is constant and on track with Charlie.

3130719,3,B0014DZ2XC,"The Rolling Stones are one of the greatest bands of all time and Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest directors of all time.  For those two reasons, this film should have been fantastic.  Well, at least the sound was fantastic, but why were the cameras on Jagger 95% of the time?  Okay, if they were on him 50% of the time I might have been okay with it, but there weren't enough shots of Keith and barely any shots of Ronnie and Charlie.  Plus, there were almost no shots of the rest of the musicians.  A band is much more than it's lead singer, and the Rolling Stones are much more than Mick Jagger.  At least Keith, Ronnie, and Charlie should get a sufficient amount of camera time.  It's especially frustrating when Keith and Ronnie are playing riffs or solos and the camera is focused on Mick.  I would expect more from Scorsese and I think most others would too.  The highlight of the movie for me was ""As Tears Go By"" and the old interview footage.  It was also great to LISTEN TO songs such as ""Shattered"" and ""All Down The Line,"" but almost every single performance could have been filmed better.  Four Flicks in my opinion is so much better and their are so many more shots of Keith, Charlie, Ronnie, and the rest of the musicians.  Scorsese should have gone through some of the Stones archives to find older concert footage from the late sixties and throughout the seventies.  I swear that so many of these bands need to release DVDs like the LED ZEPPELIN DVD, the BEATLES ANTHOLOGY, THE KIDS ARE ALRIGHT, and TOM PETTY'S: RUNNIN' DOWN A DREAM.  The Stones should really think about going through their archives as a treat for their fans who weren't around to see them in the late 60s and 70s.  Anyway, if you are a Stones' fan and don't care about the camera focused almost entirely on Jagger, then you will love this film.  However, if you require many shots showing Keith, Ronnie, Charlie, and the rest of the musicians playing their instruments, I think you may want to take a pass.",1210204800,9,1999,4.450549450549451

Christina whats'er-name and some fat kid named ""Jack"" attempt to duet w/ Mick on ""Live With Me,"" and ""Loving Cup.""  It's more embarrassing than Cheryl Crow's performance (I certainly misused that noun there) of ""Honky Tonk Women"" from that HBO special thing.  And why, oh WHY did they have to completely ruin the dad-blamed ""mood"" by trotting out the greatest embarrassment in American history, the Clintons?  But so I won't be totally negative: it IS nice hearing ""She Was Hot"" live, and that duet with Buddy Guy, ""Champagne & Reefer"" almost completely makes up for the rest of the shortcomings of this...thing.  Yes, I'll purchase it when it becomes available, because I have a 30+ DVD collection (mostly legitimate) of Stones' performances since Brian, but...well, to be honest, a quote from Ian Hunter is appropriate here: ""Rock and Roll's a loser's game, it mesmerizes, and I can't explain...""

3130722,5,B0014DZ2XC,"Going to see a concert nowadays takes all one's resources.  Ticket prices often go up to three digits, and most likely the best view is watching the band perform on a video screen.  Sometimes people (myself included) are willing to travel long distances to see one's favorite acts perform onstage.  Getting to see the biggest bands, like Paul McCartney, U2, and The Dave Matthews Band is difficult at best.  Ironically, the cost of a ticket to see The Rolling Stones play in Martin Scorsese's documentary/concert film 'Shine a Light' is about the same as it would cost to see a live concert when many of their featured songs were popular.  It ain't like it used to be.

However, the sheer power and able musicianship haven't gone stale nor retro, so the film is a real treat for those of us who have all but given up on seeing them in person.

It is a testament to Scorsese's directing abilities that the prologue, the intermittent vintage vignettes, and the conclusion are uncluttered.  We get our introduction to the band and the various methods of setting up the stage, the play lists, and the operating procedures of the filming.  Mick Jagger and Martin Scorsese go at the logistics in a way that has tension, but never garners animosity or loses affection for the project.  In many ways, it is a labor of love for both sides, but it is Scorsese who seems the most piqued by the end.

On stage it becomes a celebration.  There's no arguing these guys are dedicated.  After an exuberant rendition of ""All Down the Line,"" an early song, Charlie Watts looks directly into the camera and with a few facial gestures lets us know without pretense how demanding it is to be one of the nimblest drummers of one of the most celebrated rock bands ever.  Equally flexible is a slender Mick Jagger who still struts his stuff as well as ever.  Rising to the occasion is the guitar interplay of Ron Wood and Keith Richards, whose camaraderie outmatches Keith and Mick.

There's good will and good vibes all around that never seem forced.  The concerts draw from San Bernadetto and New York City, and the former concert is a benefit for The Bill Clinton Foundation.  Near the end of the introduction, we get the former President, his senator wife, Hillary, and several relatives who get a chance to meet and have pictures taken with the band.  On stage, they've never seemed happier.  The energy has always been there, but the warmth between the band members seldom has seemed more cohesive.  This concert shows them having fun, almost like they've taken themselves too seriously in the past.  Never has Mick Jagger seemed so willing to share the stage.  There are moments that Keith is front and center with Mick off of the venue.  Then, Mick gets almost deferential with guest guitarist, Buddy Guy, and singers Jeff White III and Christine Aguilar.  Even the back up members in the brass section, the dancer-singers, and the other musicians get the spotlight.  As Keith says in a fairly recent interview, ""I don't THINK when I'm up there.  All I can do is feel,"" and more simply, ""We love what we do.""  (Yet, I couldn't help but notice Mick stop in the middle of the stage while he was singing ""Jumping Jack Flash"" as he was in the sites of a pretty fan's picture cell phone.  Some things never change.)

After a huge catalog that forty-five active years can garner, they bring a lot during their vintage performances.  The play list?  Well, there will always be a bone to pick, but what makes the ""light shine through"" is their ability to play any song and make it really rock.  I was surprised, for instance, by the number of songs they drew from `Some Girls,' which happened to be my first Stones' album, but while I don't think it's their best selection, I loved what they did with it in concert.  Besides several tracks from `Some Girls,' they take highlights across the board, but showcase variety in their repertoire.  ""Jumpin' Jack Flash, as an opener, ""Tumbling Dice,"" ""Brown Sugar,"" and ""Start Me Up"" are The Stones playing big, but, then, ""Far Away Eyes"" is a sample country serving that is contrasted with blues numbers like ""I'm Free"".  Acoustically, they play just fine with ""You Got the Silver"" and ""As Tears Go By"".

For a concert movie, they still know how to show everybody a good time.  They are vintage rockers:  smooth, seasoned, but still with a kick after all these years.",1209340800,78,4386,4.654096228868661
3130723,5,B0014DZ2XC,"Just saw the movie in IMAX. What an amazing and phenomenal experience ! So much energy, so much joy, such incredibly vibrant music. Anyone who thinks they are too old, is missing the point. Yes they are scary looking, but their music, performance and soul has aged perfectly. Like fine wine that only gets better the older it gets.

As I watched them I felt I was watching the living embodiment of the spirit of Rock & Roll. Forget the Plastic Four and any other recent contenders, they can't hold a candle to the Stones.

What came across was their enjoyment of the music, the audience and each other. They were having fun, and as simply the best at what they do. They have such musical depth, as well as talent and skill: jazz, blues, country, as well as rock. You could listen and watch forever.

The film was done so well. The concert footage was exciting, and made you feel that you were there. You were also up close with the band. The sound was great, the movie brought the concert into the movie theater.

The movie was mostly focused on the concert in NYC, but there were also clips of past concerts, TV appearances and interviews. It was so funny and it brought out their sly wit and wry outlook very well. The clips were seamlessly integrated and complemented their musical presence. Great job Marty !

Even though I have just seen it, I want to go again, and I can't wait for the DVD. Hopefully it will have all kinds of background goodies. Oh, and I can't wait for the Stones to hit the road again. If you get a chance, go to see them in concert. Its the best show you will ever see (and Marty has captured it).

My only complaint is that they waited until the end to use the song, Shine A Light, it was played over the start of the credits. But it stopped in the middle of the song. Boo. It should have kept playing until it was done (the credits were long enough).",1208131200,9,1879,4.308781869688385

I always hate when something of quality becomes a caricature of itself. Being what they ""are supposed to be"", perhaps in this case. What would make an amazing rock band care so little about being amazing, and just rest on the idea of ""if we just show up, and plug in, they will applaud.""

This is what was captured on this film.

This is more disappointing than Vegas Elvis. At least Elvis shined, even at  the end, and even with the understanding that he was a ""Vegas act"".

Would Tom Waits turn into this? Would Neil Young? Would Leonard Cohen?... Even if they could? Bowie almost did with ""Glass Spider"", but he quickly bailed, thank god.

Keith, Mick, & Ronnie actually are bad in this performance. Charlie is great. Daryl is great also. Scorcese brought nothing to the table, in my opinion.

I truly wish I had seen something special. I have great respect for their career. Perhaps more than they do...",1207526400,17,1041,4.564516129032258
3364926,5,B0014DZ2XC,"Well, I saw it on opening night (in IMAX - I wasn't aware that it IS being shown in ""regular"" theaters, as well), and am still stunned and euphoric. It was better than my wildest dreams, one of the few movies that actually lives up to the trailer, and is now one of my five fave movies of ANY kind, all-time.

Musically:
The band may be sounding better than ever: Charlie, God bless `im, is nearly flawless, and his kit sounds incredible. Ronnie plays better lead than I've EVER heard him play, from Faces through all of the tours & albums he's done as a Stone. Keith's soulful feel always amazes, and he sings stronger than in some time. Darryl J. is SO locked in with Charlie. Lisa & Bernard sound gorgeous (and she LOOKS that way, too). In a rehearsal scene, I learned that Chuck is the de facto musical director (Damn him; he's had my dream gig for WAY too long!) - he kills, too. The horns are spot-on, as well, from the bluesy arrangements to the precision parts they play on ""All Down the Line."" Mick may have done the best live singing of his life - his tone is true to what he's sounded like on recordings, which has not always been the case in concert... ditto with pitch, phrasing and interpretation. Needless to say, he's still the most riveting front man in rock n' roll. Perhaps the most pervasive thing: Everyone on stage seems to be having the greatest, most fulfilling time of their lives, and they are performing as if those lives depended on it.

Technically:
God bless Marty Scorsese, too - he loves the music & presence of the Stones enough to LEAVE THEM THE F*** ALONE! This is a jaw-droppingly good film, from shooting to mixing & editing. Speaking of the mix (concert segments done by the great Bob Clearmountain), from a surround standpoint, it is astounding, at least in IMAX. I was happily blown away by this technique: Whomever is on camera, their instrument/voice is up front in the mix for the duration of that shot - PERFECTION! Between Scorcese's visual choices and Clearmountain's audio ones, I truly felt as if I had the best seat ever at a Stones concert. ONE GRIPE: I could have used more of Darryl's bass, and at times, Chuck's keyboards.

Guest spots:
Jack White: Okay. He's got the right idea.

Christina A: She, on the other hand, doesn't. She wails too much, especially for a GUEST. Great pipes - seems to me like she doesn't know when NOT to use them. Note Keith's reaction as she leaves the stage.

Buddy Guy: Try to take your eyes off of his - I dare you! Scorcese couldn't. A brilliant moment in time.

Viscerally:
My legs never stopped moving to the beat, at times, I shut my eyes and let my body sway, out of sheer tranquility. Ever since we left the theater (after midnight last Friday), I have felt more inspired as a musician; I've been writing more than I have in months. These are the effects the Stones' concerts have always had on me - as I wrote to 40 of my closest friends, ""Go. Go to the soonest showtime that you can possibly make.""",1207526400,32,2990,4.437158469945355
3364927,4,B0014DZ2XC,"If you know enough about The Stones that you're reading reviews to see if you should see this movie, then the answer is, ""Yes, you should see this movie.""

If you don't know much about The Stones, this movie will show you more about what all the fuss is about.

Watching Mick Jagger is amazing (and exhausting).  Most teenagers could not exert themselves as he does most nights.

Watching this film, you get the impression that if Rock n' Roll hadn't already existed when Mick came along, he would have willed and forced it into creation.

You get the impression that if Rock n' Roll wouldn't last until tomorrow unless we found a hamster able to run on a wheel all through the night, Mick would volunteer to be the hamster.

I think the movie clearly shows what it means for all members of a band to be necessary to create a band's chemistry.

We see the band members transform from fairly quiet and unassuming boys (with clips of interviews from the 1960s) into coordinated and widely heard protesters (still with their boyish grins and boyish charms) through their combined musical creations and performances.

We're reminded that Rock n' Roll used to be considered dangerous because it discussed sexually explicit topics with teenagers and anyone else listening in.

We're persuaded that The Stones' version of Rock n' Roll isn't just a style of music or a certain rhythm and tempo, but rather it is an extension of a coordinated force of wills.

I do have some critiques about the film, which lead me to give it only 4 out of 5 stars, but life's short and my critiques are not important, and you're probably not reading this review to hear about one critic's ideas about how to make a better concert movie.  I'm still waiting for a truly great Rock n' Roll concert movie, and unfortunately, this movie, like many others, falls just short.

The Stones do great performances of many of their famous songs, from ""Start Me Up"" to ""Satisfaction"" to ""Brown Sugar"" to ""Sympathy for the Devil"" to ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" and many more.  I particularly loved  their performance of their 1978 song ""Far Away Eyes"" and their cover of The Temptations' ""Just My Imagination.""

The movie and The Stones' lives suggest it takes regular hard work, rare chemistry, and a driving will to artfully publish our dissatisfactions if you want to shine the lights of Rock n' Roll.",1207440000,10,2358,4.70316301703163

3364931,2,B0014DZ2XC,"Have you seen the ""Bodies Exhibition"" that has been touring museums all over America? Its an interesting concept, real human cadavers (minus the skin)posed in various positions, shooting baskets, conducting orchestras- doing things dead bodies don't do.
Well if you add some bland remakes of some great Stone songs to these lifeless skeletors, you have an idea what Martin Scorceses zoom lens on the Rolling Stones looks like in this film.

There's several Rolling Stones movies. Two are really good- ""Ladies and Gentleman:the Rolling Sones"" (curiously unavilable on DVD) and ""Gimme Shelter"", the others hardly mentionable. Unfortunately, ""Shine a Light"" falls into this latter category. Age isn't the worst thing about the Stones in 2008. It's scary how creviced their mugs are today and jokes about their withered flesh are hard to resist. The worst thing about the Stones is they have clearly lost their edge as the bad boys of rock and roll and instead of rocking out their energy with raw, ballsy versions of the tunes we all love, they fortify their stage band with quality session men and other ringers and play some versions of songs that I find absolutley bizarre. ""Shattered"" in particular was a great studio masterpiece, complete with a beat that smelled rock,punk and maybe a little disco all in one and a guitar solo/bridge with Ron Wood pedal steel guitar that was very imaginative and ahead of its time. ""Shine a Light's version of this great tune starts with a mutated and unrecognizable guitar riff and and worsens with a Jagger vocal that defies the original cadence and rhythm. Bizarre, sloppy and bad.
Also know that Keith apparently only rarely contributes backup vocals, handing duties over to a trio of backup vocalists. Keith does sing lead on two vanity numbers ""You Got the Silver"" and ""Connection"", completely wasted efforts. Keiths vocals never were really good, but at least the effort was appreciated. The Stones also waste our time with songs like ""Start Me Up"" (which I'm sure is not a fave of true fans at all), ""She Was Hot"" and a cover version of ""Just My Imagination"" that sounded far better on vinyl. Put this all together with a self-censored take of ""Some Girls"" and you don't have much of a rock concert. It's more like one of those Hall of Fame Induction shows where the music takes a back seat to celebrating the fact the performer is just alive.

Suprisingly I really like the guest apparences, something which is usually contrived and lame. Buddy Guy didn't bring a lot of notes to the stage but plays them with taste and soul. Jack White enjoys doing a better Mick than Mick on ""Loving Cup"" and Christina Aguilera (who I never knew could sing) lets go with some great belting on ""Live With Me"". Keith does show some life with his axe, but Ron Wood seems to grab the zestier leads, and though he is no Mick Taylor, he proves a competent guitarist.

I hope the Stones did this for the music and not for the money, because I am sure not buying it. Scorcese is a great director, the Stones were a great band, but at this stage all has been done, what's the point? I know they don't NEED the money, but apparently they do WANT the money.

Though the actual track 'Shine a Light' from Exile on Main Street is not played during the (film version of this) set, it is an excellent title for this rock documentary as Martin Scorcese is shining a light so to speak on the Stones themselves, and this light shines mighty bright and mighty close. But Scorcese is not as invasive as you might expect. And this documentary/concert film does not feel like an expose as much as a celebration of a band that still has some kick left in it. Instead of being overly reverent and even elegaic (as perhaps he was in The Last Waltz) Scorcese, takes a lighthearted & lighthanded approach. The first thing that Scorcese documents is the planning of the show itself and the miscommunications that took place between what the Stones wanted (a big venue) and what Martin wanted (an intimate one); miscommunications that could have been avoided had the band been available to actually meet face to face with Scorcese, but these and other miscommunications are treated more as running jokes than as genuine problems. Another running joke is that meticulous detail man Martin Scorcese (perhaps the only living director with a fame that rivals the Stones own) wants to know ahead of time what the set list will be or at least what the first song will be so that he can plan his first shot, but the Stones keep it a secret until seconds before the show begins. Its funny even though no one really thinks for a second that with his arsenal of cameras on and off stage there is any chance that Martin Scorcese will not get the exact shots he wants. But even while having some laughs with the band (at the bands and at his own expense), Scorcese is excellent at capturing what an immense task it is working with a band that is not used to surrendering control nor opening up on camera (and Scorcese inserts several old interviews into the concert footage to document Mick's ability to dodge questions with charm and Keith's utter refusal to play the q & a game at all). The irony is that the Stones have been public figures for over four decades now but we really still don't know them very well. Scorcese does a very good job at remedying this situation by peeling back the Stones mystique and allowing us to see the real personalities behind the public performances. As with his Dylan documentary, he does this by going though the immense Stones Interviews archive and coming up with some very rare interview footage (much of it from Asian and European tv programs). We get to hear the notoriously reticent Charlie discussing an alternative career as a painter, and Ron Wood discussing Keith and how he is nothing like his public image, ""Keith's a very decent and very moral guy"". The interviews are culled from all phases of their career and are very brief and very selectively inserted between the live songs. Most of them are humorous and/or ironic. Notably absent: any mention of Brian Jones or Mick Taylor or Bill Wyman.

No doubt there will be Stones fans who wish that Scorcese had teamed up with the '72 or '76 or '78 Stones, when the band was a bit more like Scorcese's screen outlaws, but better late than never.

For Stones fans the thrill (and it is immediate and lasts the entire show) is having the feeling of being onstage with the Stones. Jack White, Buddy Guy, and Christina Aguilera all do guest stints onstage but we as audience members feel like we are onstage as well and this is the truly brilliant thing about this film. The cameras are so close that we actually get to see the band play (and see who plays which guitar lines) and hear the between song banter between band members. Scorcese allows us to affirm or reaffirm that Mick is without a doubt the leader of this band and his relentless energy and seductive charms seem to wow his bandmates as much as they wow the crowd. Micks age shows in the close-ups but his real instruments, his voice & his body, seem completely immune from the ravages of time. Keith, at times, seems a bit lost (as when Christinsa Aguilera steps onstage) and he misses chords in a few places, but Scorcese's intimate style really serves Richards well. He is an intensely likable guy who loves what he does and still seems to feel adorably awkward when he takes center stage to sing ""You Got the Silver"" & ""Connection."" He is in many ways Mick's opposite. The chemistry of the band and especially the chemistry that exists between the Glimmer Twins is the thing that continues to fascinate and continues to evade documentation.

The show is intense and intimate and revealing. The guest appearances are well chosen. And the ending (which I will not reveal) is perfect.

Note on the soundtrack: The 2 cd edition of the Shine a Light soundtrack will contain four bonus tracks (""Paint it Black"", ""Little T & A"", ""I'm Free"", & ""Shine a Light"").",1207094400,123,5227,4.581818181818182

3364989,2,B0014DZ2XC,"Let me preface this by saying I'm a musician, a huge fan of Rock and  of an age (63) where I was onto the Stones from the beginning. Saw them in LA in '69. I love their records thru all of the Brian Jones and most of the Mick Taylor era; occasionally since. This is a well shot film as you would expect from Scorcese. The question I have is does it offer anything compelling? To me the answer is no. Why? Well first and foremost is, I don't think the Stones are now or have been for a very long time, a good live band. Let's be honest here, Keith and Woody are sloppy, undisciplined players who are not good improvisors and take a 'devil may care' attitude towards the arrangements. Mick is and has always been preoccupied with bebopping around the stage, dancing and waving his arms while shouting out the words to each number. Never a great vocalist to start with, he has no intention of singing seriously. I've often described his live performances as, 'hollering' He hollers the lyrics. It's too bad really because I truly love so many of their early recordings. But they are who they are. There was a time way back when (early 70's) when Keith would keep the arrangements tight and leave the lead parts to the gifted Mick Taylor. Now with his own grand persona outside of the band as well as in (mostly for just still being among the living) he has a whole schtick which includes a lot of guitar playing outside of his expertise. Ugh! If you're interested in seeing a good performance of the Stones live, pick something on film from the early 70's. If you want to see Keith at the top of his game, choose a concert film of him with the Expensive Winos recorded at the Hollywood Palladium in the 90's. If you want to admire the Rolling Stones still doin' it in their 60's, then this movie is for you",1437955200,2,1803,4.334319526627219

3364998,3,B0014DZ2XC,"Martin Scorsese's concert footage of The Rolling Stones shot at the Beacon Theater in NYC is a decent representation of what it feels like to see the post-2000 Stones live.  He's a cinematic master, and this piece is technically well done.  Sound, lighting, editing, all good stuff.  Where this film falls down is in the clash-of-the-titans undertone that does not serve the greater purpose.

This is especially true because I assume Scorsese owns this work and had final say on what was used and what was edited out.  When you wield editorial power, you must understand that your wise viewer also knows this.  Because while I can assume that Mick Jagger is a bit of a ""diva,"" Scorsese works so hard to prove this that it comes across as uncomfortably defensive, especially when the director shoots himself as the helpless victim ""I sure would like to see the set list!""  This would make a fascinating documentary -- but it creates uncomfortable tension in the intro to a concert film.  We get to hear every one of Scorsese's whiny, neurotic complaints about the band and the theater.

For a 40-year veteran of stadium rock concerts, Mick does his share of moaning about lights and cameras, as well.  All this complaining actually does take away from the show.  For instance, I hardly would have noticed the two big Pana-Plex cameras in the second row if it weren't for Mick's complaints. But now they're all I see, and it's not necessary.  Concert have obtrusive cameras - that's rock & roll!  Until you make them a plot point.

Marty should just smile and say ""Action!""  I don't want to think, ""E-gads!  Will this show come together?!  Will Mick be on time?  Will the cameras be blocked?""  It's a Stones show!  I want a inevitable build up to be positive!  The battle of the egos is an unnecessary distraction.

Also, I had no idea this was a Bill Clinton production until I got to the part when he walks on stage during set up.  The awkwardness of the band around this business-suited entourage makes you feel for Keith and Ronnie, and to his credit, Scorsese shoots this in a manner that makes you feel like part of the band listening to Keith's muttered wisecracks and Charlie's good humored placating of politicians.  For a bunch of bad boys, they sure are polite!

Hillary makes a cameo as the most uncool girl in the room, trying to make the band laugh at Bill's expense. (spoiler alert - she fails.)
I love behind the scenes footage as much as the next guy, but it was all so unexpected, I felt like I had walked into the wrong ballroom.

However in the end, boy these Stones roll - and how!  When you view this show, turn it up loud.  No LOUDER!  Now it's a Stones concert!",1434326400,,2683,4.566037735849057

3365031,5,B0014DZ2XC,"For beginners, this review is written by Eve's husband, Neil Quiros. I think I'm The # one Stones' fan in Venezuela.

I'd acquired this video on BD disc but I saw the DVD format and was amazed by the brightness and resolution of the picture that are almost as good as the Blu-Ray disc, so I decided to get it on DVD too. It's important to consider the wide screen format and the illumination of the setting as well which make the video very enjoyable. This video is iconical for marking the end of an era in the Stones career, It was their last performance documented in their first half century span. It was a very exclusive and intimate performance which had not been seen before on video for beig on behalf of the Clinton Foundation with the attendance of his family and closest friends and for the details shown about the preparations by Scorsese.

The song versions are full of energy as usual and the score was an excellet sellection. The special guests were incredible. I,m in love with Cristina Aguilera's voice, Jack White's Versin of Loving Cup, and the jokes and anecdotes on Buddy Guy. His voice was an important contribution to the show, too; I like the idea of having blues, American black players in their shows so we don't forget the Stones' origens and supporting  these musicians this way. As a matter of fact, I think this is the best sellection of special guests in a Stone show.
There was too much cursing by Mick, though. But I think this is one of the best videos by the Rolling Stones along with LET'S SPEND THE NIGHT TOGETHER and BRIDGES TO BABYLON and never get tired of watching them, Hope other fans enjoy them as much as I do, too.",1401321600,,1660,4.471947194719472

3365040,5,B0014DZ2XC,"I just recently purchased a Blu ray player and ""Shine a Light"" is one of the first Blu ray disc that I have watched on my Sony TV. This is an excellent concert if you like the Rolling Stones.

Video: The picture quality is excellent.
Seeing Keith Richards up close in 1080P isn't for everyone as blu ray displays every single wrinkle of his face like a very dry dirt road. It's amazing that he is still rockin'.
There were many cameras filming the action and the overall feel is that you attended a concert and were in the crowd rockin' with Mick Jagger. Cameras also effectively catch action on the stage up close as they perform.

Audio : Excellent Sound quality of the concert.
I have a Pioneer receiver that drives 5 speakers in surround sound. My Pioneer plays analog and I is not digital. The blu ray disc allows about three options to choose from so you can select which audio performs best with your sound system. The recording is very alive and catches the energy of the concert. The mix is good as you can hear Mick's vocals while also hearing the drums of Charlie and guitars of Richards and Ronnie Wood.

Performance: I'm amazed that after all these years, these guys can still take the crowd into their hands and rock them.
They effectively breath new life into songs that they have performed countless times over the years. While doing ""Brown Sugar"" Mick leads the audience like a conductor as they sing  ""ye, ye, ye, wooo!"" You have to see and hear it. Awesome.

They cover ""Just my Imagination"" a tune associated usually with the Temptations version of a happy sounding song. However Mick captures the anger and frustration of the song which completely makes sense. After all, the object of his affection doesn't even know he exist and this romance is a thing he was forced to manufacture in his mind. At one point in the song Mick exclaims, ""she doesn't even f-ing know me!"" in a heavy British accent.  I loved it and the once beloved Temptations version is now lame next to this.

Guest appear as the blues guitarist Buddy Guy joins Mick on stage to perform a tune about getting high and Buddy appears that he just might be. The performance is very raw and blues at its finest.

Chistina Aguilera sings a rather saucy suggestive tune with Mick and they are good together. They seem to enjoy the performance. It is soulful and their styles provide contrast.

There are old news clips of the Stones mixed in from over the years. They are short, interesting, and not over done. The blu ray moves at a good pace from start to finish.

""Shine a Light"" is an excellent Blu ray that combines clear video with well mixed audio while capturing one of the best rock bands ever, doing what they have done for generations and they can still bring it. Enjoy",1391817600,,2762,4.517034068136272

Short series of bad interviews, like one in Japan:

""How old are you?""
""Twenty-nine.""
""Same age as me.""
""How nice.""

""What question have you been asked the most?""
""That one you just asked.""

And how many times were they asked ""so, how much longer are you going to keep doing this?"" A bunch of older songs - ""Jusy My Imaginations, "" ""The Girl With Faraway Eyes."" Mick `n' Keith hugging and harmonizing. Muddy Waters comes out for ""Champagne And Reefer"" with Buddy Guy. Keith intimidated Buddy onstage, gets him to stop spazzing, Mik plays the mouth harp at him. ""Tumbling Dice"", introduces the band. Keith's schtick: ""It's good to see you all. It's good to see anybody."" Keith sings ""You've Got The Silver"" with no guitar, Ron on slide. Still has the voice. ""Keith sings ""Connection."" Keith talks about him `n' Ronnie: ""We're both pretty lousy, but together we're better than ten others."" Overly-long lame intro to ""Sympathy For The Devil"", with Mick strutting around stage left.

Similarly lame intro to ""Start Me UP."" That as ""last song""? Come on!! ""Brown Sugar,"" Keith's guitar zomms in and out of the mix. ""Satisfaction."" Closing credits is the audio for ""Shine A Light."" The song is in memory of Ahmet Ertegun - it was this show where he slipped and injured himself in the backstage area, never to recover. Suppplementary video - ironic media statements: why have you stayed together so ong? Top of the ""to die"" list (""I'll let you know"").

""Why do you keep on doing what you're doing?""

3365055,5,B0014DZ2XC,I'm back on a Stones kick after reading Keith Richards' autobiography. These guys do not let you down. They've had some bumps along the way but their dedication to rock music and their ability to still put on a great show make them a treasure.  Scorsese does a great job and his production doesn't get in the way of raw energy. Guest appearances are a delight.  My only issues was with the Amazon instant video itself. It paused and had to reconnect several times during the movie even though I had plenty of bandwidth.,1368144000,,519,4.51063829787234

3365061,4,B0014DZ2XC,"If the Stones cast a bright light who better to reflect on it than Scorcese?  Seeking to revisit the greatness of his rock 'n roll opus The Last Waltz Scorcese turns his talents to what is, perhaps, the greatest rock 'n roll band of all time.  Nothing wrong with that, and in this viewer's eyes a welcome addition to music history.  If there is a weakness it could only be said it is a good twenty years late, but really that's splitting hairs.  Great music trumps all and it truly almost does here.  You get a truly later day impassioned performance at the ornate Beacon Theatre.  While the performance is constantly interrupted by myriad news clips there is a path of a great intimately photographed Stones fantastic performance.  And it is the talent of Scorcese documenting this incendiary performance that rises above all.  The factor, besides the fantastic cinematography, that makes this compelling is the song selection with inspired performance.  The viewing audience gets a great insight into the music which even if long in tooth is some of the greatest rock ever penned.  If there is a greater example of a timeless rock band it is almost impossible to imagine.  Objectively it doesn't reach the pinnacle of The Last Waltz but it comes damn close.  With reference sight and sound it may be the finest concert ever presented on video in spite of the aforementioned limitations.

3365068,4,B0014DZ2XC,"I am the Stones Authority. And reluctantly I must agree with a number of the negative reviews of this DVD. When I first heard about Scorsese making this film I was quite excited. A documentary of the band working up to a show at the Beacon, but as it turned out - it really is not a documentary, it is just a concert film - of a concert pulled together for the purpose of shooting a documentary. You know, Martin, make it one or the other. The documentary aspect of it starts out well enough, but then is abandoned for the concert film and we never return back to the documentary. Too bad, because the documentary aspect was fairly interesting. And I really don't need Bill Clinton or any of that Global Warming crap. Is this a big thing for Scorsese? Does anyone know? And what the hell do either have to do with the Stones and a documentary about them preparing for a show? Since this ""documentary"" is so contrived - it is anything but a documentary. So it is little wonder that the performance is not that inspired. It is not bad, but just look at the faces of the girls pulled in from the Elite Modeling Agency to stock the front row. This is not the Stones fan base. These hot little brats have never heard of the Stones, and couldn't name one song if their lives depended on it. Kind of a shame really, because the Beacon Theater is a great place to see a show. I saw Keith there with the Expensive Winos back in '89 or '90, and this could have been a great DVD, but I don't think Scorsese put a lot of brain power into this one - figured it would just work out, because it is the Stones. Now, on the plus side, it is nicely shot. The audio is actually pretty damn good, but for the annoying tendency in the mix to ""focus"" a solo or other instrument when we cut to its respective ""close up"". And the set list is pretty good and I don't have a problem with the guest appearances. I don't care about Jack White and his presence doesn't add anything. I don't really care about Aguilera either, but her duet with Jagger on ""Live With Me"" is actually one of the DVD's hi-lites, as far as I am concerned. Buddy Guy is great. I wish Jagger had sung ""Connection"" - an old favorite of mine - but was happy that it was there even with Keith singing it. All in all it is not that bad, it is actually pretty good, but it could have easily been so much better if Herr Director had made up his mind about what kind of film he really wanted to make. Scorsese kind of wings it and the whole thing suffers as a result.",1357776000,2,2507,4.160493827160494

I won't even bring up the fact that, if Mick Ronson had gotten the gig after Mick T quit, they might have still been viable.  ""Shine A Light"" is simply pathetic.

3365072,3,B0014DZ2XC,"Not a bad show, considering when it was filmed.  Strange though, in some ways, after reading Keith's book.  The film starts out with Bill Clinton and a charity speech.  Seems odd since Keith goes on and on in the book about not bowing to the establishment that spent years trying to put him in jail.  Plus, in over 500 pages, Keith never once mentions charity.  But the really strange part was watching the Rolling Stones perform an edited version of ""Some Girls.""  Trying to look badass at 70 years old and yet obviously omitting controversial words comes across as petty self-censorship.

Too bad, there was so much character in the venue, the audience, and the performance, when all wrapped together, you were worn out by nights end....sounds like a title to a
movie doesn't it?  Worn out by nights end......if you want to enjoy The Stones in a small venue, this is your only chance.  Have a bunch of friends over, have a few cocktails and snacks, talk about your concert going days...hopefully those days aren't over, hook up your HDMI cable to your large flat screen surround sound television...in a big room....turn out the lights...turn UP the sound....have a nice big comfortable couch and chairs around...and don't worry about a thing.
You might just feel like you are there.....don't over analyze the thing.....it's The Rolling Stones....not a stringed quartet comprised of virtuoso's.

3365085,3,B0014DZ2XC,"I have a soft spot in my heart for Rolling Stones concert DVDs.
""A Biggest Bang"", ""4 flicks"" and ""Lets Spend the Night Together""
all showcase a band playing to the edges of their ability
and doing a very creative job of it. Also the personality
of the really band stands out. That's what makes watching a Stones DVD such fun.

How is it that the Stones have come to censor themselves so severely?
To be fair,some of the ""Shine a Light"" concert film delivers great interaction:
the Buddy Guy scene is great as well Mick and Keith interacting during ""Far Away Eyes"";
but the fact that certain curse words are masked from the DVD belies an urge to play it safe.

That is evident in the way the certain scenes in the film are shot as well.
On more than one occasion dialogue is cut or masked.
Also the song ""Some Girls"" is performed with certain lyrics missing.
I know, they've been changing the live lyrics to ""Brown Sugar"" for years.
Now this editing for a PG-13 rating seems to have reached a tipping point.
I buy DVDs to get unedited performances; otherwise I could watch this on cable.

Maybe the Stones have mellowed and Scorsese has captured the simple truth.
Charlie Watts, Ron Wood, and bassist Darryl Jones

It's no secret that Scorsese is a huge Stones fan - their music is featured in many of his films.  But the way this concert is shot is a little strange...the sound is highlighted in the shot.  So if Keith Richards is featured on the screen, you primarily hear his guitar.  If it's Charlie Watts, you hear his drums.  Not just a little louder than the rest of the music...like the rest of the band is in the background.  Maybe there's a way to turn this off?  The soundtrack doesn't do this.

3365093,1,B0014DZ2XC,"One of the great things about being human is that you can always reinvent yourself. You change with the times and, if you are artistic, repackage yourself in a new and interesting ways that takes into account the new you and what you have to work with. The Stones don't get this. They simply try to be who they were when they were kids and it really doesn't work. They look like a cover band of themselves except kind of old and ridiculous, and they can't even get the guitar parts right. You'd think after years, day in and out, of playing the same songs, they'd only get the guitar parts better, or change them a bit in new and interesting ways, but, in fact, they only play sloppy versions of the same old stuff. There is nothing new, no fresh takes on anything except to include some guests that, for the most part, don't really add anything interesting. They just don't really care about the music anymore. It's all about cashing in and showing everyone that they still can do it. I'm not really interested in seeing old men prove to me they still can move around on stage like they used to. I'd rather have old seasoned men show me that they still care about the music they play, and show me they still care about playing good music. I'd like to see the Stones perform new good songs, or at least the old songs, in new and interesting ways that show me they still care about being creative musicians instead of proving to the world that rich white people are still willing to shell out tons of money to see some kind of endurance record and pretend they are young again. Young people love the Stones because, let's face it, they haven't come up with anything better or different. Embarrassingly, these old guys are more interesting than anything the younger generation has managed to come up with.  I know many people will enjoy this, and I can't fault them for it, but for me, it's just so boring, and worse, depressing. It's depressing that one of the greatest Rock bands that wrote so many wonderful songs are now willing to forget what they are capable of doing that really matters, write and play good music, and simply ape themselves in a pathetic attempt to be who they once were forever.

3365095,5,B0014DZ2XC,"Since the other reviews cover content & experience of the film/concert, I'll just add the uncovered aspects here, except to say that the price is well worth the purchase for a DVD one will watch again & again, a must for any Stone's fan, or NEW fans. I don't own any Stone's albums or DVD's, so this was my 1st real glimpse of the band in their real lives & history, chemistry together, as well as their performance. I've heard & loved many of their songs, an old one not included in this concert that was a favorite of mine was ""Under My Thumb"". I've become a fan late in life, as a result of the energy & stellar talent revealed in this performance/DVD & would definitely buy it again.

The single disc (another said only 4 extra tracks on 2 DVD set) DVD included the 6 bonus tracks, behind-the-scenes featurette, other film previews & credits. I wish there had been more content but am satisfied with my purchase, knowing I will watch this DVD many times over without ever being bored; there's so much going on in every scene one doesn't dare look away for fear of missing some important angle, perspective, action or tidbit. The concert is about 2 hours long, the special features about 30 minutes; from experience (Pink Floyd's Pulse 2 DVD set for example, had 15+ hours) I know DVD's hold at least 7 hours of content each and would have liked to see much more of the behind-the-scenes, historical & lifestyle as well as musical content that probably ended up on the cutting room floor.

Perhaps other fans know the reasons & answers for this question & I'm going to offend by asking, but why do they need 5+ guitar players? Keith, Ronnie & Mick all play guitar together for many songs, plus the bass player, and a 5th guitar to the left of the 2 back-up singers/dancers, and then out comes Jack White with guitar, and Buddy Guy with guitar, with all the additional instruments played by stand-ins rather than band members. Why doesn't one of the band play keyboards or bass? How many lead guitarists does one band need??? Mick seems to use his guitars as props, rarely actually strumming the strings, nor can one hear the sound his guitar makes, if it makes any. When Jack White comes out, it's clear he has some type of injury to his right upper arm or elbow, as he has some sort of black wrapping or brace and a short/no sleeve on that side, with a full long sleeve on the left arm, so why did he need to play guitar when all the other members (besides Charlie the drummer), including Mick, were playing guitar too??? Jack White is an awesome musician playing just about any instrument, and his vocals are as good if not better than his guitar, so he could easily have just sung with Mick & rested his injured arm. White did the best job of harmonizing with Mick of the 3 featured guests (Buddy and Christina), and one could easily see that White was living his fantasy of being on stage with his idols, he could not stop grinning & seemed to be having the time of his life, as did all the band members. Buddy Guy played fantastic guitar, but his vocals were way too loud & overwhelmed the other band members voices/tone; maybe his mic was turned up too high? Christina danced & used her voice to full DEEP belting effect, at times too loud but for the most part doing a great job harmonizing with Mick--there was definite chemistry between them both, as there was between the band and all the guests on stage. A definite MUST SEE for any classic rock or Stone's fan.

One weird note, on the left stage were 3 people, 2 of whom were back-up singers, and a 3rd person in their section to the immediate left, whose face was NEVER shown, who was it & why weren't they included in the film or introduction by Mick later in the concert? That bit of mystery distracted me, and I was surprised that there were a male and female back-up singer only, no others--with the band members doing vocal I wasn't sure why they needed a male back-up singer & had expected there to be several female singers instead. No matter because the one female singer, Lisa, made up for at least 2 or 3 others of inferior talent or ability, her voice & dancing, her energy, amazed me! As did her fellow singer/dancer to her right. As other's have stated, the bass guitar is barely heard, and the keyboards rarely heard or featured, and lastly, why were there NO solos, especially Charlie on drums who seems to be portrayed as a supporting cast member who rarely gets any attention, recognition or face time in this DVD.

Needless to say the day is long past when anyone, at least anyone that I know, will dispute the title of ""the world's greatest rock band"" that has been attached to this group. In the old days an argument could be made, and rightfully so, that Jim Morrison and the Doors on their good nights secured that title but that was then. Off a viewing of this production it is east to see why the Stones carry that title, without hype, even today.

Director Scorsese has made a very good decision to go light on the filler (early Stones interviews, press conferences, etc.) and the technical aspects of putting on such a tour (and the compounded problem of filming it). The center of the documentary is the Stones' concert from Chicago (a Bill Clinton charity benefit concert) complete with all the classics, ""Sympathy For The Devil"", ""Satisfaction"", ""Brown Sugar"", Girl With The Faraway Eyes"", etc. Clearly these sixty-something guys still can rock and one best keep that AARP membership offer at arms length. But, to finish, here is the ""skinny"", one must always remember that the Stones started, heart and soul, as a white blues cover band (Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, and so on) and so the scene that steals this production is when old Chicago bluesman, Buddy Guy, comes on to fire up ""Champagne and Reefer"".

3365106,3,B0014DZ2XC,"***1/2

If the astonishing longevity of The Rolling Stones has taught us anything, it's that rock'n'roll is no longer just a young man's game.  In fact, after nearly a half a century of rocking out, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood - all now in their 60s - offer proof positive that youth is indeed just a state of mind.

More than twenty years after his seminal rock film ""The Last Waltz,"" director Martin Scorsese turns his cameras on the Stones, recording a concert they performed at the Beacon Theatre in 2006 (as part of their ""A Bigger Bang Tour"") to benefit The Clinton Foundation (Bill and Hillary are both present at the event and are seen mingling with the fellows in the opening moments of the film).  I'd say that at least 70 percent of the film's running time is devoted to the concert itself, with the rest made up of backstage stuff (mainly early on) and  footage from interviews the band members gave throughout their career when reporters were (ironically, as it turns out) always predicting the band's demise within a few years - snippets obviously designed to contrast the boys` younger selves with what they look like today.  The most humorously prescient moment comes when Dick Cavett asks Jagger, in 1972, if he can envision himself still doing this when he's 60.  (Jagger's answer, by the way, is yes).

With camerawork that is fluid without calling undue attention to itself, ""Shine a Light"" is essentially a straight-forward concert film featuring some of the group's most instantly recognizable standards (""Jumpin' Jack Flash,"" ""Shattered,"" ""Start Me Up,"" ""As Tears Go By,"" ""Brown Sugar,"" ""Satisfaction,"" etc.) as well as songs that are less well known - a feast for diehard fans of the band, to be sure, though probably less gratifying for those who aren't.  For despite the presence of Scorsese in the director`s chair, ""Shine a Light"" is not really all that remarkable as a piece of filmmaking, but the sight of a bunch of astoundingly agile sexagenarians strutting their stuff on stage as if they were still in their twenties does give hope and encouragement to the rest of us fighting against our own fast-approaching golden years.  It's obvious that these boys - clearly the true survivors of the rock era -  are one day going to be taken off the stage feet first, going out doing what they love best.  And, if nothing else, the film gets these rock'n'roll legends on the record for future generations to enjoy.",1272931200,,2469,4.797169811320755
3365107,5,B0014DZ2XC,"I do love me some Stones, but I admit I didn't see this in the theatres, nor was I entirely certain what it was about.  I knew it was Scorsese and that there would be plenty of concert footage, but that's true of the Last Waltz too, and that was much more than a concert film.  ""Shine a Light"" is the gem that answers the question, ""How much would I like to have the best seat in the house at a Stones club concert?""  The boys may have been a lot more relevant when they made ""Gimme Shelter,"" but you simply can't deny the quality of concert filming possible these days, with advanced audio recording, multi-cameras on tracks, digital film editing, 5.1 sound... getting copies of these even at full retail is just a ridiculous steal for the experience.

Plenty of other reviewers talk about the performances, which are fantastic, and prove that unlike athletes, musicians never really get too old to do their thing.  This film illustrates better than ever how hard Mick Jagger works when he gives a concert.  That man is relentless.

But I want to move on to technical comments.  The sound is very interesting and beguiling.  The first thing you notice is that the overall blend sounds great.  The second is that it is the most pro-Keith live audio I've ever heard.  He clearly has his own channel in the master tapes, and you can clearly hear everything he plays and sings.  Thanks to the wonders of home theatre these days, you can also always get a clean read on the bassline.  But every other instrument seems subject to whether or not Scorsese wants you to hear it.  It's like outside of Mick and Keith he's constantly moving around the volume to the featured notes and then mixing them back down.  You can't hear Ronnie Wood half the time.  And the person who gets the worst treatment is Charlie Watts, who you can barely hear the whole time, and what you can hear is not miked well.  Overall, I like it better than most Stones audio, but it has its oddities.

Visually, I don't know how he does it, but Scorsese's concert film technique is fantastic.  He's got the same look as the Last Waltz again... sharp light that manages to never be harsh, spotlights through the smoke creating art in the air.  The film editing is amazing, flipping from one angle to the next on the same person but perfectly synced and not jarring.  It's better than a front-row seat... it's a constantly moving best seat in the house.

Great stuff.  No wonder people rave.",1268179200,3,2454,4.5147392290249435

I have to admit I was drawn in by the film, the Stones and Mick Jagger in particular and thoroughly enjoyed them all.  The film is fantastic and fully portrays the energy and vitality that made Mick Jagger famous. Watching him, you slowly come to realize that Jagger's power is that he is more of a modern dancer than a vocalist. His graceful and complex body movements are captivating to watch. He totally blends dynamic energy with body movement and music. The movie is a rare change to appreciate Jagger's magnetic charm without paying the high price of a concert ticket. He truly gives an outstanding performance.

The movie also features the other members of the band: guitarists Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood, and drummer Charlie Watts. Kieth Richards is one of the greatest guitarists of all time (ranked number 10 on the list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time). It is a treat to watch this artist in action. These performers are so into their music you feel the sounds are coming out of their bodies rather than the instruments. They are perfectly in tune with their music.

Stones are old enough and drug-addicted enough to give even a good live (not to talk about great live). I watch the concerts and see how they killed and thrilled their music. Rolling Stones became a SHOW-ORRIENTED band. Quite similiarly to Madonna. Well... we all know Madonna can't sing, she hasn't voice and looks like old b**ch, thus puts everything in the show and stage-design to attract people.

If you are a MUSIC FAN, the music you listen must be GOOD TO LISTEN, not good to watch. The only thing I like in todays Stones, is their stage set, light effects and the number of crowd they attract. what about MUSIC? musically this is probably the WORST band from the list of Stones' cover bands.

the ONLY band, which comes from the sixties and MUSICALLY remains ABSOLUTELY GREAT, is DEEP PURPLE. Deep Purple & Rolling Stones are maybe worlds greatest Rock'N'Roll bands and true and greatest legends of rock. But musically only Purple remains as great as they were 40 years ago.

All in all, if yuo like great show, great stage-set and light effects, buy Rolling Stones, or Madonna, or Justin Timberlake's DVD...

but if you think that MUSIC comes first, and you love MUSIC & TRUE ROCK'N'ROLL, go and buy Deep Purple - Live At Montreux 2006, or Live In Birmingham 2002...

3365131,4,B0014DZ2XC,"One thing which has been (surprisingly) overlooked in the many reviews here is the fact that Mick was obviously in poor vocal shape at the time of the filming. He can't hit the high notes or hold a note, particularly in the earlier part of the concert. He has to resort to half talking/half singing and sounds somewhat like a rather poor Mick Jagger imitator.

One plus of this is that you can actually make out the words to the lyrics when he's in this mode.

Later in the concert he loosens up a bit vocally, but never reaches the 'normal' Mick sound.

Keith gets a couple of vocals and has never sounded better, IMHO. His usually reedy, thin voice has some uumph this time out.

Shine A Light is crap filming at its best, and Scorsese should be embarrassed for calling it his own.
The description is way off in that it leads one to believe Scorsese is going to chronicle the great and mighty careers of the Stones, with great behind the scenes footage of their tour, but in fact it's obviously a video project he made for the 'ego'-driven Bill Clinton.  Why not just state what it is, a video of a benefit concert for Bill and his global warming BS, and let the renting public decide whether they want to view it from there???  Why lie (or excuse me, let me restate that for the Libs out there, 'misstate'.) about the contents???
Audio mixing is terrible, and his cuts to the overly-used snipets of past Stone interviews seem to be hastily and shoddily thrown in without any rhyme or reason.
Camera shots are typical, little if any 'great behind the scenes footage', and jeez, do ya think the Clinton's need more air time????
Also, why is it that Scorsese feels he needs to get his mug in this 'crapumentary' at every chance he can find?
Anyways, the good is;
Mick is great at being Mick in that he cares not even for the great Scorsese.  He really doesn't seem to care when, or even if, he will provide Scorsese with a set list, but ends up capitulating and provides one to the great director as the lights are coming up on the show.
The Beacon looked awesome and seeing the Stones in such a small setting is cool.
Keith Richard's made me laugh when he disses Clinton after shaking hands with him with his' Boy am I Bushed' comment.
I loved Charlie Watt's response and expression when finding out that he'll have to endure a receiving line of 30 of Bill's buddies.
Some good appearances, but one of the biggest downers was Mick's voice was no where near ready for this show, and who the hell tuned Keith's guitars????

It Starts out a little slow with background on filming then gets into the concert arena..
The mixing on the first couple sets could have been better but from there on the sound was great, with good close-ups of the band members, revealing their emotions and the enjoyment they obviously experience on stage.
The short interviews from the past and comments from the present were both enlightening and entertaining.
If you want to look into the stage lives of the greatest Rock-N-Roll Band of all, I highly recommend this DVD.
I intend showing it again as a party treat over refreshments with friends.

I just loved the vignettes at the beginning, the patience in which Scorcese waits for the set list is commendable and offers some wry humor right from the start.

Did they forget to plug in the bass player?  No depth to the sound track at all.  My mid-sixties original copy (in mono)of the Stones first US release (The Rolling Stones: England's Newest Hitmakers) is far superior in sound quality than this waste of money.

3365141,4,B0014DZ2XC,"For over two hours these guys make you forget they've been going at on stage for more than 45 years.  Mick is as silky smooth as ever.  Keith and Ron work their magic on stage and Charlie keeps the rhythm as always.  The energy level is so high that Mick takes a break at one point, turning the concert over to Keith and Ron who do a little trip down memory lane with ""You Got the Silver"" and ""Connection,"" before he struts back on stage for ""Sympathy for the Devil.""  Many of the cuts are off their 1978 album, Some Girls, including a very nice version of ""Far Away Eyes"" with Ron Wood on dobro.  Buddy Guy joins the boys on ""Champagne and Reefer,"" with other guest appearances by a sultry Christina Aguilera, who Mick can't resist feeling up on ""Live with Me,"" and Jack White on ""Loving Cup.""

This is first and foremost a concert film, and Scorcese did little to interfere with that.  He interweaves the concert with some nice fill-ins of vintage interviews and short concert takes, having fun with the thematic question, ""How Long Will You Guys Keep Going?""  There isn't the backstage banter between songs that characterized his wonderful rendition of The Band's Last Waltz.  You get a little pre-concert black and white footage as Martin, Mick and the boys argue over how best to capture the performance, but then the Stones never were that revealing, preferring to crack jokes or dismiss questions all together as we see in the snippets of interviews.

The Stones still capture the spirit of their early anarchist days when everything they did seemed to rock the establishment, whether they meant it to or not.  There are references to Mick getting arrested and having to face a board of distinguished British gentlemen as to the morality of his conduct.  Also, a reference to their notorious Altamont concert that was the subject of ""Gimme Shelter.""  The funny part is that if Mick was ever an anarchist he was a reluctant one, as he dodges question after question in the vintage interviews with an amusingly respectful tone.  Keith is more brusque, and Charlie simply doesn't say anything at all.

They let the songs speak for themselves.  Some sound better than others over the long haul.  Mick takes ""Just My Imagination"" back to its Temptations roots, giving it more of a Doo Wop feel.  He emboldens ""Sympathy with the Devil"" with a hard driving rhythm and closes with a rousing rendition of ""Satisfaction,"" the only times these guys seem to show their age as Keith appears visibly relieved that the show is over.  Martin gives the camera to Mick as the guys leave through the back door of the Beacon Theatre, pulling back from upper Broadway to a moonlit light over New York.",1230595200,,2687,4.678723404255319
3365142,3,B0014DZ2XC,"I've never been an overly huge fan of the Stones because I've never been that big on the guitar players, but to me they sound sloppier than ever. They tortured ""Undercover of the Night"", one of my favorite Stones studio recordings, and the cavalcade of wrong notes emanating from the guitars is too much to take. Highlight would be Buddy Guy's appearance if there is one.",1230508800,3,371,4.636363636363637
3365143,5,B0014DZ2XC,"Please allow me to introduce myself. I have been a Stones fan for 75% of my 6 decades, which implies that I am the right age for this movie, which is easily the best of the century so far. In its genre and from my perspective, ie as a fan, not as a movie critic. One of the nicest scenes of the film is the piece of the TV interview with Jagger in 72, when he is asked if he can see himself doing what he does still at 60. He smiles and says: easily! yes, that's the spirit!
Another favorite snippet: Jagger asks Watts to say hello to the audience. Watts takes the mike and says: hello! Jagger jubilant: he speaks!
2 hours of a concert interrupted by brief scenes from old TV coverage. 2 hours of unadulterated fun with Britain's most durable export item. Well, almost unadulterated. There are some Americans here. Some stars like Bill Clinton and Buddy Guy. Or greater stars like Jack White and Christina Aguilera. Of course the competent background choir and band.
And let's not forget, quite frankly, the main cast looks straight out of a prequel to Pirates of the Caribean. The Mystery of the Everrolling Stones. As Keith says, alone they are quite lousy, but together, they are better than ten others. Typical British understatement.",1229299200,3,1238,4.53125
3365144,5,B0014DZ2XC,"This film is a brilliant documentary/concert depicting the Rolling Stones as still one of the most enduring popular music acts. The great thing about this film, besides being another fantastic effort from Martin Scorsese, probably the best music-documentary filmmaker of all time (he should have done the Chuck Berry 60th birthday gig), is that the viewer actually feels that they are part of the film and on stage with the Stones! This well constructed film follows the Stones, who are on tour, to a charity concert in New York. It's in an intimate theater setting which was specially designed for this movie. Not at all like some of the previous Stones concerts at Stadium venues!

The photography and sound are first rate. Guitarists will love the close-ups of Keith and Ronnie, as well as the selection of guitars (Telecasters, Gibsons, a Guild and others) that Richards uses. The song selection is superb and well recorded and while the film is a documentary it is full of personal touches regarding the making of the film, old interview footage, conversations and even a few problems.

My only criticism of this film is that they didn't get Bill Wyman to return for it as a retrospective and that they didn't include at least some historical footage of Brian Jones - who really founded this band and got the Blues going in England. Ok, you can't have everything.

The band is truly amazing. The Stones modernized their sound by augmenting their live shows with horns, background vocals and even strings. However, a highlight are the vocals of the lovely Lisa Fischer, whose brilliant LP ""So Intense"" (check it out) won a well-deserved Grammy in about 1991 and then mysteriously disappeared from the scene, because of many problems - some business- only to reappear with the Stones. She also sang with Tina Turner.

There of course have been a lot of reviews of this film as you would expect, so I won't go through the entire set list. I feel the three best tunes in this film are (1) ""Just My Imagination"" - I have always respected Mick Jagger as vocalist who would do covers of the great soul artists. He did early versions of Wilson Pickett, Solomon Burke and Otis Redding tunes (that takes GUTS). In the late 1960s the Stones did a cover of the Temptations ""My Girl"", after it had already been a number one tune. Wow! It was not that good. This tune, a later hit by the Temps, is just brilliant. A great arrangement, tasteful solo by Keith, and a great overall rock-soul feel. This is the best tune in the set.

(2) ""Champagne and Reefer,"" with Buddy Guy is also fantastic. Buddy plays in tune (great) and the song is really dedicated to Muddy Waters who originally recorded it. Buddy was a longtime session man at Chess Records in Chicago and played for years with Muddy. I also liked Mick's blues harp in this tune, it recalls the first two Stones' LPs when he did some of the first Blues harmonica heard by white kids in America on tunes like ""Little By Little"" and ""I'm A King Bee"".

(3) The third best tune, I feel, is the Brian Jones influence in this concert. It is ""Paint It Black"". This is the best of the bonus tunes and shows the Stones great writing ability. They pegged this tune in the late 1960s with the ""Flower Power"" days and of course, Brian, the multi-instrumentalist, learned to play sitar better than George Harrison did. Anyway this tune still sounds fantastic today!

This is a must have DVD for all Scorsese, Stones, Rock or Blues or Film fans. Great price, great production, good history and a personal feel that we always get from Martin's films. This will be a classic in years to come.",1227916800,7,3623,4.642745709828393

3365147,5,B0014DZ2XC,"This film begins with a farcical look at preparations for the upcoming Beacon Theatre show in New York but once the Stones storm the stage it's all about the music. From the opening notes of Jumping Jack Flash it's clear this music is in their blood. Whether it's Ronny's machine gunning the audience with the neck of his guitar. Or, the anger in Mick's face when he burst on stage ripping into Jumping Jack Flash, everything about this band says ""let's go!""
While it's mostly lesser known '70's era songs, there are the '60's classics as well. Sadly, the most recent release is '83's ""She was Hot"", with Ms. Lisa Fischer and Mick gyrating wildly to this song. It's much better live.
The three cameos are good. Jack White is adequate. But it's Buddy Guy and Christina Aguilera stealing the show. During Guy's cameo, ""Champagne and Reefer"", we see Keith and Buddy's duelling guitar act. Then, Ronnie on third guitar and Mick on harmonica, all four legends standing in a circle, toe to toe tearing the house down. Ms. Aguilera surprisingly belts out the duet on ""Live with Me"" that should make any queen of soul proud.
The Beacon Theatres' intimacy is magnified during ""Far Away Eyes"", when Keith botches the lyrics and a fan ribs him. He laughs back ""Shut up"". Fans should watch for several instances of clever reworking of some lyrics. The preacher in Far Away Eyes now asks for twenty dollars, up from ten. Inflation I guess.
Martin Scorese's best known rock documentary is ""The Last Waltz"". It was the final performance of Dylan's former touring band, ""The Band"" in 1976. His latest foray into rock documentaries is a resounding success. He does a wonderful job interweaving obscure ancient clips of interviews and performances of the Stones, bringing perspective to their amazing longevity.
The last song of the encore is ""Satisfaction"". Near the end it sounds as if Charlie is about to lift the song onto a new level and continue to rock on, but it turns out to be a classy way to end a classic. Satisfaction indeed.",1227312000,,2020,4.7252124645892355
3365148,4,B0014DZ2XC,"... but geez, they're looking OLD. Mick Jagger was born the same year I was, and he has ten times the energy I do, but I have to say their act is getting a bit tired.  As others have noted, this is an ""oldies"" concert, with nary a new song in the mix. Mick's duets with Buddy Guy and Christina Aguilera add a bit of freshness, and Keith Richards' uncanny resemblance to Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp reportedly based his character on Richards) is entertaining as well.  A fun time overall.",1227139200,,493,4.406593406593407
3365149,5,B0014DZ2XC,"One notably good movie I've seen lately, on Blu-ray. Martin Scorsese's ""Shine a Light"" filming of some live Rolling Stones concerts is not only great, good music, but one of the best examples of the possibilities of HD 1080p TV and Blu-ray. Mick Jagger (and Ron Wood) look like gargoyles. Mick is amazingly thin and spry for some one who is 65 years old, if memory serves, and bounces all over the stage, like he did in his twenties, like a cricket who drank a lot on coffee. Keith Richards looks like a zombie undead superannuated version of Captain Jack Sparrow. Charlie Watts, who must be nearly 70, now looks the youngest of the lot. But it's all about the music!

Beautiful, sexy guest Christine Aguilera and sings and jumps around in the highest pair of spike heeled boots I've ever seen a woman be able to stand on - must be 5-6 inch heels? While she looks really sweet, she shrieks the lyrics.

The music in the film, despite the guests, is much better when Jagger sings alone. Typical of the great Rock concerts the Stones have been doing for 40+ years. We never thought they would be when they started out, but the Stones have become the default Kings of Rock after the breakup of other groups like the Beatles, Doors, CSNY etc. That having been said, their best tunes still come from the sixties and early seventies, best from their period on London records and when Brian Jones was alive, ""Let it Bleed"" and before.

Intercut in this is parts of a mid `60's interview with Jagger and the Stones, like Scorsese used in his definitive Dylan documentary ""No Direction Home""!

Buddy Guy helps Mick sing the Muddy Waters blues song ""Champagne and Reefer"". Unfortunately, Guy shouts the lyrics, overloads the mike and makes the anti-cocaine message nearly unintelligible.

 The Stones music is loud and concert-like and the Blu-Ray sound will test the limits of your sound system.

But the most amazing thing is the video effects, the huge array of high intensity lights and strobe lights which Scorsese shoots off repeatedly and uses to backlight and then solarize Mick Jagger to a complete white.
This is what Blu-Ray can do!

If you have Blu-ray and 1080p capable HD TV, this is really a demonstration DVD!",1227139200,10,2215,4.676092544987147

3365151,3,B0014DZ2XC,"""Can you picture yourself doing this at the age of 60?""

""Yeah, sure.""

I thought that was the neatest line in this concert-documentary when Mick Jagger gave an honest and prophetic answer to that question, some 30 or more years ago (maybe closer to 40!). We see that short interview here on this concert DVD.

Not only Mick but Keith Richard, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood just keep going and going and going. Anyway, this film is 95 percent concert and five percent talk, so those who think this is a documentary are going to be disappointed. The talk includes old interviews and an opening segment with the director trying to work with the group which, as we see, isn't easy. For those who want more documentary material, check out the 16-minute featurette which comes with the DVD. There is some great material on that, reflections by a few of the guys, some nice acoustic guitar work and a better chance to see what they guys are like in rehearsal.

As far as this concert - held at the Beacon Theater in New York City - goes, it's about average for the Stones. The 2003 concerts at NYC's Madison Square Garden and the earlier ones in London, Berlin, Turin, and other places around the world seem more dynamic than this one, because of the bigger stage and audience. At the smaller venue of the Beacon, we couldn't enjoy the big props, neon scoreboards, the boys walking down the long aisle for a small set in the middle of the crowd, Mick prancing down long sides of the stage, etc. The prancing and all that is still here but it's in a confined area, almost claustrophobic at times.

It was fun here and there to see old clips of the band being interviewed when they were only in their second and third years of touring. You get an idea of the inane questions reporters have probably asked the rock group a thousand times over. The Stones, especially drummer Charlie Watts, don't exactly sound like Rhodes scholars, either! Watts seems out of place, too, but - being the family man he is - that's always been the case. Everyone loves Charlie, though, and respects him - maybe because he is different from the rest.

I thought I would prefer to hear new material instead of the same old/same old, but as it turned out, this two-hour concert was best in the last 40 minutes when the band did the familiar upbeat songs. The concert seemed to come to life with ""Sympathy For The Devil"" and four or five other old-time favorites. Earlier, the electricity was missing on a bunch of the numbers that you don't usually hear. Maybe this would have had a much higher impact on me had I seen it in an IMAX theater, instead of a TV on a small screen.

There were sparks flying, however, when the three guests sang and played with the group. Jack White, Buddy Guy and Christina Aguliera all brought life to the concert. Being a blues fan, I liked Guy's number best. One of the strangest moments - and maybe the most revealing - was the closeup shot of drummer Charlie Watts yawning after one number and looking very tired and bored. Hey, after all these years....he's entitled but it gave us a quick reminder just how old these guys are (mid '60s). I don't think director Martin Scorcese, whose slick cinematography in his films is fun to watch, did these guys a favor, in that regard. He makes them all look and sound as old as they really are and, hey, that's not the Stones. They jump around like 20-year-olds. They'll go on forever, right?",1226448000,3,3437,4.507223113964687
3365152,1,B0014DZ2XC,"My problem with this is in both the performance and the filming. I can understand that The Stones have played some of these songs to death, But when they just slop through the parts, ignoring the original precision of how they put they notes together to create such great songs, its just disappointing. If you hear a performance of Beethoven's 9th Symphony where the musicians just having fun ""estimating"" the original written parts, it would suck. As much as I hate to say it, I'd rather listen a sound-alike Stones copy band who still respects the original music play these songs than the Stones themselves.
  And the audience? Where the long hair freaks? Is this really the Stones audience? A bunch of hot young girls and stock broker types in the front rows? I guess they either got invited by Scorsese because they'd look good on film or were rich enough to get tickets from the scalpers
  Watch the Altamont perfommance or RnR Circus, C***Sucker Blues to see these tired old impostors when they were THE STONES!!!...and an audience that was into the music, not into looking cool,
  But that said they'es still pretty good. Unfortunately they have their own legend to live up to and that's probably impossible to achieve.

As concert footage goes, the pictures are sharp and clear and creative, as one would expect from Martin S, but one is left thinking it could have been so much better.  I was fortunate enough to see the Stones during the Bigger Bang tour and the film does not begin to capture the raw energy of their live show---perhaps because this film was shot in the Beacon Theater in front of a small, obviously wealthy and pampered crowd rather than the blue-collar folks who made the Stones what they are.
As John Lennon once said---those of you in the cheap seats, feel free to applaud, and those in the front, feel free to rattle your jewelry.
This show does not capture the sheer joy of a Stones concert because it is so atypical of a Stones concert.  The Stones played better in front of a million in Rio than in front of a few hundred in the Beacon.",1224201600,4,1114,4.393203883495145

Mick Jagger - over 60 years old - wow - he still has it!

seeing the band, up close and personal, I kept saying to Norman - wow - they all have all their HAIR! and a lot of hair.

Ron looked good. 'ol Charlie looked good. Keith Richards, still can play guitar. wow - he is one ugly dude. I loved how he'd spit out his cig when done, cracked me up.  the back up singers and sax players all great.

the song with Jack White - Keith playing acoustic - wow - I could cry, so lovely. and Jack - what a hottie!

the song with Buddy Guy - OH MY GOSH - that was sooooooo GOOD! I got chills. that was wicked cool.

Christina Aguilera singing with Mick - amazing. sexy. cool.

But it's mostly damp squib with the entire movie being about just one concert (all songs shown are played fully) with very few titbits from backstage and fewer clips from Stones' earlier years. This is not a documentary on the Rolling Stones but rather an extended dvd of one concert. Nothing really stands out here. All in all very avoidable. Hugely disappointing as earlier works like ""The Last Waltz"" and ""No Direction Home"" are like collectibles that can be watched several times over the years with their timeless quality...""Shine a Light"" is nowhere near that..one watch and you can toss it in the bin...oh well...",1223164800,6,783,4.894736842105263

But at Altamont, it was dark and crazy and there didn't seem to be any security. People were all over the stage, at one point a dog walks across in front of Mick.  At Altamont, the band was sounding great.  Anything could happen at Altamont.

It's nice that nobody was killed during the filming of Shine a Light.  But all the IMAX cameras in the world couldn't make this performance fun to watch.

Well I hate to sat it but the reviwer ""THE DUDE"" is right.  I love the stones music but it is like you say, time for retirement.  Do they really need to keep on making money???  If Mick is so strapped for cash he can sell 5 or 6 of his homes.  I have only watched about 1/2 of the movie and am having a hard time finding a reason to finish it.  Sure the video is very clear (should be for an IMAX) and the sound is good but not great.  They really are way past their prime, like 15 years or more past.  The songs at times are sloppy and unrecognizable until they do actually sing a line clear and you go oh that's it.  That Jack White dude was down right bad.  They should have edited him out of the film.  It may have been better with Jack Black singing and playing guitar.  Buddy Guy was pretty good and I wish he had stayed out there longer.  It seemed to wake up Keith from his coma.  At times it looks like Mick is not happy at all and I think he knows they do not sound good at all.  Can Keith actually play his guitar anymore???  Keith doing You Got The Silver was real bad.  Like your drunk cousin at one of those karaoke bars.  So sad.

I wish they would just hit the studio and do a couple more albums and by then you'll all be 70 and time to hang up the guitars for sure.  Do an oldies rock n roll cover album.  Do a blues cover album.  Just don't hit the road again.  It looks like Keith may very well hit the road...face first real soon.  Your legacy is written in stone forever.  We have all of those great albums up to Some Girls to play and enjoy. - Jim still sad after watching 1/2 of this show.",1222041600,3,1710,3.9154518950437316
3365164,4,B0014DZ2XC,"Martin Scorsese directed the Rolling Stones in this magnificent recent concert footage.

It's amazing that the Stones are still playing and agile after years of the rock-and-roll lifestyle.  I hope I can bounce around like that when I'm in my 60s!  Keith Richards even seemed ""alive"".  To me you could clearly see how Johnny Depp patterned his pirate character (Pirates of the Carribean) after Richards when you watch this.

Some of the film shows a benefit concert hosted by President Clinton, who seemed so excited and happy to introduce the Stones on stage.

It's much cheaper than seeing them on stage.  But, there's nothing like seeing the greatest rock-n-roll band live.  My husband wouldn't take me to see them recently here in the 'Vegas area (but then again, he doesn't like my music).  I, however, managed to see the Stones a few years ago---and all I could say was it was money well spent.

3365172,4,B0014DZ2XC,"Scorcese and the Stones are both titans in their vocations.  With this stature comes a natural creative tension, humorously played up in the start of the film as Scorcese begs for a set list and the Stones mischeviously hold out on him.  The show itself is very good, but we have all seen Stones films before.

The biggest, baddest band of all time can still crank out the energy and volume, but it is in the quiet moments that Scorcese's efforts really pay off. He sprinkles in old interview footage that is ironic, funny and insightful, particularly in the present day follow-up.  I have been a Stones fan for a long time and the film only enhanced my belief that these guys are really talented and very smart, often toying with all of us as they do their thing.

Do not miss the extra footage: Great footage of the soundcheck; despite the reputation, these guys are consumate professionals who really love their work. Scorcese requested Factory Girl, which did not make the movie, but Ronnie, Keith and Mick jam on it with no one around. Funny and real exchanges with the band and Buddy Guy and Bill Clinton.  Keith quietly noodling on stage, pleased to be doing what he loves to do; eyes closed, picking away. Now that is something  I could watch all day.",1221091200,3,1259,4.568888888888889

The cinematography is very good, the featurettes are interesting as are the old recorded interviews (although older Stones fans, like me, will have seen them all before in decades past). However, what makes this film outstanding is the sound quality; it's so much better than in other DVDs of their concerts that I own. You can crank it up if you want to rock out but you can also pick out subtle remarks between the players, as when Keith gives Buddy Guy his guitar at the end of the show-stopping 'Champagne and Reefer'.

I have the latest BluRay player (as of Aug 2008): the Pioneer Elite BDP-05FD, with the latest firmware (1.02). This BD takes FOREVER to just give me the splash screen (over a minute: a minute in fact to the ""loading"" animation). THen about half the time, it freezes: no pause, no chapter skip, nothing but a blank screen. Ejection and restarting is the only cure. This might be a defective BD, but there is no message. The same issue occurs on my Playstation 3...

BluRay is still just getting started, and there continue to be teething issues. I have about 10 other BDs now, and Shine a Light is the ONLY one with these sorts of issues. Sigh.

although the stones sounded pretty much like i thought they would, not great; i was disappointed with scorcese, because i expected something in 'the last waltz' vein, but this doesn't come close. this is not a concert dvd that i will be going back to very often. my expectations were too high, but i should have known better. in 'the last waltz' ""the band"" knew when it was time to go their separate ways; the stones should have also realized that a long time ago. it would have saved them the embarrassment of playing at the super bowl. have they no pride? i guess, for them,especially in the recent past, it was always for the money.

There are plenty of Rolling Stones concerts from the last twenty years on DVD. The last two tours were heavily documented by the Stones themselves. This production is nothing special. I think some of the concerts filmed by the Stones are better. The only thing to sell this particular product with is the inclusion of songs not previously on DVD, such as Tears Go By and She Was Hot. Jack White's duet was not particularly good. Christina Aguilera's was better, and Buddy Guy was probably the best of the star turns. But this is not riveting stuff. The fans need a more historical documentary, since 25X5 has never been issued on DVD. There has to be a ton of interesting footage from Brian Jones onward. Go ask Bill Wyman, he's probably got the motherlode squirreled away. As for 'Shine A Light', I don't get it. What did Martin Scorsese add?",1219708800,4,976,4.519774011299435

3365190,5,B0014DZ2XC,"I have been a Rolling Stones fan since the 60's when I first bought and wore out my ""45"" of 'Honky Tonk Women'. Being a musician, it's hard not to criticize the playing of Keith now, as it seems he is playing when and whatever he ""feels"" live, but who am I to say anything negative about a guy in his mid 60's who still rocks as good as anyone!....and that goes for all the original members!

 The boys are having a grand old time and Mick's energy is amazing, even though some of the lyrics seem rushed, but once again.... who can say anything to a man who has sang the same songs thousands of times! While the band is solid, I do miss Bill Wyman's unique bass playing and Jack White's vocals on his duet with Jagger are embarrassing! Buddy Guy's ""sit in"" seems natural and is very good and although Christine Aguilera can sing, she has no business being on stage with these guys! Watts is great as usual and he keeps the band in sync.

I probably would have liked this set even more if I didn't have so many other DVD's from the same time period to compare it to. First off, there is nothing really new in this film, that wasn't done as well or better in 'Biggest Bang' or 'Four Flicks' DVD sets except a few welcome rarely done songs. The sound quality is excellent, but the mix is horrendous! Buried guitars one minute and then a big crunch from the decrepit finger's of Keith slugging along his guitar neck the next! Even with it's flaws, I completely enjoyed watching this film, as it shows one of the most important rock bands of all time still doing their thing the way they choose to do it!

Rock on boys!

3365191,3,B0014DZ2XC,"...with no visible baby boomers in the audience!

Not bad, but there are problems with this film:

1. Not a single song more recent than 1983, in spite of the fact that the Stones have released 5 albums since then. As someone who became a fan of the band while in high school in the 80s, I've always seen them as a still-working band and creative entity, not as a nostalgia act. How many live versions of ""Satisfaction"" do we need?

2. Fooling with mix levels; so that if I'm looking at Keith Richards his guitar suddenly jumps out of the mix and becomes louder, then fades back into the band when the camera cuts away. Lame. As if to tell viewers, ""see, this guy plays the sound you're hearing now!"" The height of this lameness is when you see someone in the audience hold up a camera (probably a digital camera) and the filmmakers have actually OVERDUBBED the sound of a vintage camera shutter being clicked...as if you could hear that over the band at full volume.

3. Audience seems to be stocked with young model-types, not real fans.

4. Offers nothing new that other recent Stones concert videos have not already provided. 4 Flicks is better than this in every way...and more honest.

5. Not enough long, lingering close-ups of the lovely Lisa Fischer.

3365196,5,B0014DZ2XC,"Martin Scorcese is hitting on all cylinders lately. With the exception of his PBS Blues series which he fumbled by out-placing (it should have been more like Burn's Jazz), Scorcese has produced some of the best music documentaries/concerts ever: ""The Last Waltz"" (Muddy was amazing but The Band was brilliant behind everyone, especially the Staples on ""The Weight""), Lightnin' In A Bottle (which made up for what he did not do in ""The Blues""), ""No Way Back Home"" his brilliant Documentary (done as he should have done ""the Blues""), ""Shine A Light"" (The high point for me was Keith spontaneously and appropriately giving Buddy Guy his guitar as if only Buddy deserved to play the next note on it), and even his short documentation of The Band in ""Woodstock."" The only thing left to do is to dig deep and unearth the full story of Sonny Boy Williamson II -- I have 300 hours of oral history revealing his amazing story and Reelin-in-the-years has the AFBF footage of him in brilliant performances. Call me Martin and you can complete the cycle. Muddy, Honeyboy, Pinetop, Robert Johnson, Junior Wells and Buddy Guy have been done to death but all connected with Sonny Boy Williamson and Robert Lockwood Jr. But who was really at the crossroads with Robert Johnson?",1218931200,,1261,4.815668202764977
3365197,5,B0014DZ2XC,"This is a fascinating ""live concert"" movie.  Martin Scorsese, who also directed The Band's ""The Last Waltz,"" does a nice job of simply capturing the spirit of this concert.  There is a gritty reality to this concert and ancillary material; it is clear to all viewers that the Rolling Stones have lived a long time, as their age shows on their faces. The fact that they can still rock and roll is truly amazing.

There are some welcome guests on this DVD--Jack White, Christine Aguilera, and, most welcome of all, the legendary Buddy Guy. There are also the keyboard players and horn section, featuring golden oldie Stones' partners, such as Bobby Keys. And, of course, Darryl Jones, who is the bass player. But it's the four Stones, three of whom have been around since the very beginning, that make this concert work. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, and Charlie Watts are still rocking in their mid-60s; Ronnie Wood, relative newcomer, keeps up with them nicely.

The DVD opens with grainy black and white footage of Scorsese and the Stones discussing the movie.  Scorsese wants to begin nailing down details, and the Stones don't even give him the playlist until just before the concert and its recording take place at ""The Beacon,"" a fairly intimate setting. The Stones, in short, only appear grudgingly to cooperate with Scorsese.

The concert is recorded in color, with guests such as Bill and Hillary Clinton. Interspersed throughout the movie are old interviews with the Rolling Stones over time, providing some sense of who they are as individuals.

Maybe the best way to proceed is simply to note a sampling of songs and provide my impression of what I observed and heard.  The concert begins, in classic fashion, with one of the glorious rockers of all time--""Jumping Jack Flash."" Mick looks old, his voice does not have the range of his youth, but he can still sing a compelling version of this song.  Keith Richards' guitar licks, Ronnie Wood's playing, Charlie Watts' drumming (sounds like a series of controlled explosions), Darryl Jones solid bass work all blend well together. It is stunning to see the energy and even pleasure that the old timers have playing this iconic song. The cameras do a nice job of capturing this and other songs.

""Shattered."" One of my favorites (I like to juxtapose this with another song about New York City--""Hot Stuff""; the tone and atmospherics are so different!). Jagger can still prance around with high energy.

""Some Girls."" Toned down for the concert!  Mick Jagger joins Ronnie and Keith on guitar and it looks like they're enjoying the moment.

""Champagne and Reefer,"" an old Chicago blues song.  Buddy Guy, the great blues player, joins the Stones.  His guitar work is spare but powerful.  It's fun to watch him exchange licks with Keith and Ronnie; it's also fun to listen to his singing, joining Jagger on vocals. Mick's harmonica work adds a nice element, too.

Other cool performances abound (other reviewers list the actual songs played, so I won't duplicate). Some random thoughts.  The audience spontaneously singing ""woo woo"" during ""Sympathy for the Devil""; interactions of the backup singers with Jagger on several songs; the group's version of one of the Temptations' greatest works, ""Just My Imagination.""

And, one final brace of songs--""Brown Sugar."" The guitars start this off with the great guitar sound and riff.  Jagger joins in with the lyrics speaking of slavery in the old South, with lines like ""Gold coast slave ship bound for cotton fields"" and people being ""sold in a market down in New Orleans."" Then, finally, ""Satisfaction."" As soon as the listener hears the fuzz tone, you know that Keith is going to kick this song off.  Over forty years after its release, this rocker sounds as great as when it first came out, although the singers' voices are not as youthful as then and although their faces are deeply lined with evidence of the years that have passed.

The extras are nice, but I never pay much attention to those on DVDs.  Scorsese has nicely captured a Stones' concert and the group's spirit.  They can still be cantankerous, but they can also still rock.  All in all, a fine DVD.",1218585600,7,4169,4.862800565770863

I really like the Stones and have watched plenty of concert footage. But this is most definitely not their best performance on video. Jagger's voice is a little rough and unsteady and the band just does not sound very tight on this night for some reason. Plus, the expert concert videographers have done much better jobs than Scorsese at capturing the energy of the Stones. If you really want to see some great Stones concert action and hear the band at its very best, check out the multi-disc set ""Four Flicks"" captured during the worldwide Forty Licks tour. The band's performances and the filming blow this little concert out of the water.  Go ahead and rent ""Shine A Light"".  If you like what you see, then you owe it to yourself to BUY ""Four Flicks"" and spend some real time with the Stones on the road at their very best.  The bonus materials on ""Four Flicks"" include plenty of behind the scenes action as well.",1218499200,,1086,4.587628865979381
3365200,3,B0014DZ2XC,"The Good: the film is staged, shot, lit and (visually) edited extremely well; Mick Jagger has emerged from his tunnel of self-parody and carries the film on his energetic old man shoulders, his voice as strong and as accurate as ever, his lithe little body defying all the rules that apply to most sixty-plus year old bodies; they don't play any of the crap music they've written in the past few decades, sticking to oldies and standards.

The Bad: the Rolling Stones suck as a rock and roll band now, a guitar driven rock and roll band, that is; Keith Richards is mesmerizing in a ""What is that thing?"" kind of way, but as a guitar player, nope. The unfriendly way to put it would be to say he's lost his chops or has forgotten how to play all the riffs that made him one of the greatest rock songwriters of all time. The friendly way to put it would be to say he doesn't know the difference between what he feels and what he plays--all the riffs and rhythms circulate through his bloodstream perfectly but the technology doesn't exist to send them through the sound reproduction system so all we get is what pulses to his finger tips--all we hear is his accompaniment to his inner self. His approximations to the riffs of ""Tumblin' Dice"" and ""Brown Sugar"" are almost forgivable but his butchering of ""Start Me Up"" is not.

Ronnie Wood. He may be a fine guitar player but he doesn't play well with others. It's as if he doesn't listen to, or hear, what other members of the band are doing. A couple of the film's highlights are the two songs Keith sings featuring Ronnie as the sole guitarist. He plays great acoustic (slide) guitar on ""You Got the Silver"" and rocks well on ""Connection."" Throw him into the mix and he plays junk. As soon as you want to excuse either Keith or Ronnie because they are old, Buddy Guy, seventy-plus years old, comes on stage and makes clear what it sounds like when the first thing a good guitar player does is listen to what other people in the band are doing.

The Beautiful: Mick singing ""As Tears Go By"" accompanied by Keith on 12-string acoustic. Perfect.

The Bizarre: with the caveat that I watched and listened to this film on a standard television set so I don't know what the Dolby 5.1 sounds like, the audio mixing practice of boosting the sound level of the performer in the visual edit, down to single notes sometimes, sounds ridiculous. Luckily, Mick was the visual focus of most of the film, his vocals out front and clear.

The Disappointment: ""Lovin' Cup"" sans piano. Terrible.

The best parts of the film, and by that I mean the best songs in the film, are the minimal, simpler ones. It's too bad there aren't enough of them. Mick Jagger can channel himself channeling himself all night long, he can be double-plus-good, but he doesn't have a band behind him any more. By showcasing the band's relationship to its music as product delivered to an audience, an audience of hand-picked, paid extras that also includes Bill and Hilary Clinton, Scorsese doesn't shine a light or bring any new insight to the Rolling Stones in this film.",1218240000,,3082,4.544144144144144

3365202,4,B0014DZ2XC,"The film portion of Shine a Light (documentary style old interview clips et.) is woven nicely into the surprisingly theatrical set of live music.  The guest spots are hit and miss, Buddy Guy steals the entire show, and walks away with Keith's guitar in the process.  Martin Scorcese ""character"" director gets his personality into more than just the lens this time and is a character in the film at the beginning at least.  The music hums along and it takes awhile to get going but by the middle of this set when Mick starts to really perform (Far Away Eyes) that this film turns into a truly theatrical and cinematic experience.  At moments a true rock show that encompasses a gargantuan career on both sides of the camera, it might not be lightning in a bottle but its some kind of thunder in a jar at the very least.

3365203,5,B0014DZ2XC,"If you are a Stones fan, then just buy it and enjoy; the negative reviewers miss the point. Towards the end of a long and fantastic career it's all about the band having fun; for the viewer its all about watching them experience that joy. And if you feel the need to quibble about the price or production values, then you shouldn't be buying such a DVD in the first place. The BluRay looks wonderful and the concert is nice and 'up close'. One of the most interesting aspects is watching how MJ tries to control the band with a raised eyebrow or nod here and there, or moving to gently push KR back to center when he goes 'off the plot'. It beats me why anyone would quibble on little details that aren't relevant to the central theme - its a celebration of one of the world's true entertainment super-groups. Relax.",1217721600,43,816,4.375
3365204,4,B0014DZ2XC,"As a concert video Shine A Light does ok.  Yes it looks very nice on Blu-ray, though I would quibble a bit about the sound, or specifically the tone of the sound in the audios.  I'm sure I'm more used to the over-produced and over-compensated sound that comes from the studio mixing that happens before songs make it to the radio air waves, but the tone in several of the Mick Jagger vocals here just seemed off.  It's also, of course, entirely possible that Jagger's voice has changed over the many years that he's been singing these songs and others.

Getting back to the video quality on the Blu-ray (I can't speak for the DVD releases, having only seen the Blu-ray version), someone elsewhere had quipped that most people probably wouldn't want to see this film on Blu-ray as Keith Richards and Mick Jagger are not images that one would normally want to see in HD.  The softer images of say VHS might be much better and more forgiving for the facial features that have long since aged, as well as the boney arms and other signs of all of the various wear and tear the Rolling Stones members have endured. Outside of Charlie Watts, who looks fairly normal, the rest of the Stones look like they could be extras in the latest mummy movie (extras as in mummies themselves).  Jagger has long since looked more and more like the crypt keeper.  Keith Richards, well, he's Keith Richards.  His physical embodiment is truly that of a walking corpse, having spent many of his years on Earth living a life of excess.  Ron Wood is a less obviously worn than either Jagger or Richards, but he too is no spring chicken.  Seeing any of them in HD can be a relatively shocking sight {the reviewer smiles wryly as he types this...}

On the other hand the guitar work is interesting to watch and Jagger still demonstrates an energy level that is nothing short of phrenetic.  As noted in the quick summary for the product page, Keith Richards actually delivers a nice solo performance despite his own appearance.

What brings this film into a more valued range isn't the wasted footage of Scorsese fretting over not knowing what the song list will be, or his concerns for where the cameras will be (or the concerns over the band members for same).  It's also not the included meet & greet with the Clintons.  It's the archival interview and news reel type footage that is included and intermixed within the concert footage.  Seeing some of those images shows stark contrast of the Stones in their youthful days and appearances compared to the shells we get to see in the performances here.  Images such as Jagger's boyish looks that hint at what was come, but just as easily seem unbelievable for anyone that has seen the Stones in the last 20 years.  There's a bit of playful banter and discussion about the guitar skills of both Wood and Richards that is interesting as well.

Worth a viewing at a minimum.  Found at the right price, probably a nice addition to a video library.",1217635200,,2966,4.581439393939394
3365205,4,B0014DZ2XC,"It's hard to go wrong here - Great band, great director and a great venue. But I just can't give it 5 stars. 4.5 would be just about right.

I would have preferred that this was just a straight up concert film. Interviews and clips before the show are fine, but once the music starts why not just focus on what the band does best - rock the stage? And why was the one truncated song Keith's Connection? That just wasn't right.

I was also disappointed in the mix. The overall quality was fine, but someone in the editing bay just couldn't resist toying with the levels. As the camera focuses on different players during the show there really is no need to bump their volume. A straight-up mix would have been better and less distracting.

Buddy Guy and Jack White were fantastic, but Christina Aguilera just didn't fit with the Stones well. My biggest quibble is that, like many current pop stars, the fashion is to sing flat. I've never liked it and it resulted in an off pitch duet here. I would have rather seen Sheryl Crow on stage for a reprise of Honky Tonk Women from the Four Flicks Garden show, but that's just me.

Boy, has the music suffered. My daughter asked me why all the songs sounded the same. Sympathy for the Devil had Mick trying to do the ""who who"" vocals and they came out more as ""whee whee"". Well, and what can you say about Keith? He tried hard and came up short. The numerous closeups did't help either. Mick tried continuously to bring up the level of the crowd to that wonderful point when the band and audience become one organic whole, and he almost succeeded with Brown Sugar. But then it died.

I can't accept a music DVD with poor sound and that's what this one had. Poor, very poor. Poor to the point that I had to strain to indentify the songs. I'd like to blame it on the DVD producer but they had all the technology there to capture what the band pumped out. So what happened?

The audience at a rock concert is suppose to get into the music, to sing the lyrics at the top of their lungs, to sweat and be tranformed. This audience was more frightened about getting run over by the umpteen moving cameras that had usurped the good seats in the front row. Stuffing a lot of young, beautiful people in the front row didn't help one bit either. Their reaction to the music looked, and probably was just a show.

3365208,3,B0014DZ2XC,"""Shine the Light"" is a concert film of The Rolling Stones at New York's Beacon Theater October 29 and November 1, 2006, directed by Martin Scorsese. It starts off with some footage of planning the documentary and chatting with celebrity guests, including the Clintons, pre-show. After 12 minutes of that, The Stones launch into ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"". They perform 19 songs, including 3 with guest artists Jack White, Buddy Guy, and Christina Aguilera. The camera is usually on stage but sometimes behind or in front of the audience, always taking care never to focus on any particular audience member. Archival interview footage of The Rolling Stones from the 1960s until recently is intercut with the concert footage.

The selection of interview footage is curious. It follows the band's responses to the same tired old questions over the years, questions about controversy, success, fame, drugs, longevity. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, and Ronnie Wood have always had the same matter-of-fact answers. Scorsese is trying to make a point. Point taken. But...

The Rolling Stones are not very exciting in concert anymore. Jagger and Watts are lively, and they all seem to be enjoying themselves. But these men lack the sexual energy, taunting rebelliousness, and bad boy demeanor that made them interesting to watch. They're old. Their influence and relevance belong to a bygone era. ""Shine a Light"" drives that home. I was bored. Almost by necessity, the theme is The Rolling Stone's longevity. I am as much in awe of the stamina and continued success of these 4 sexagenarians as anyone. But where Scorsese's 1978 film of The Band's farewell concert ""The Last Waltz"" was richly textured and featured musicians near their peak, ""Shine a Light"" documents a show without cultural significance by musicians well past their prime, and it shows.

The DVD (Paramount 2008): There are 4 bonus songs and a ""Supplemental Featurette"" (15 min) on the disc. The featurette is in the same style as the film, with archival interviews intercut with new footage, but it focuses on rehearsals for the concerts and includes some short conversations with the musicians. Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish, and French. Song lyrics are not subtitled.",1217462400,4,2264,5.146739130434782

3365213,5,B0014DZ2XC,"""Shine a Light"" captures the Stones at the end of a long tour and even longer career.  I saw them in Vegas about a week before this concert, and they were at their best.  Mick Jagger's father had just passed.  It's a great concert.  I also saw this film the day it opened.  I've seen the Stones four times, since the 69 tour, and all of their DVD's and/or movies.
Don't believe all these film school losers reviewing the film or wannabe rockers putting down the Stones because they're old.  Imagine film school students without credits putting down Martin Scorsese!  The guest stars, Christina, Buddy Guy, Jack White, rock.  One might wonder why they should buy ""Shine a Light"" as they already own Stone's DVD's, a fair question.  This film features songs from ""Some Girls"", the best Stone's album for 30 years:  ""Some Girls"" (but without the lyrics about black girls who just want to get...""; ""Just My Imagination""; ""Faraway Eyes"" (country song with hillbilly humor); and ""Shattered"".  Christina and Mick make the best Stone's duet since Tina Turner and Mick mixed it up for ""Live Aid"" on the ""Let it Bleed"" album classic, ""Live with Me"".  Buddy Guy gives the movie a party rousing ""Champagne & Reefer"", an old Muddy Water's song.  How appropriate, as the Stones took their name from a Muddy Water's song.  Never before on DVD have we seen the Stones perform Keith's song, ""Connection"", a very old song from the sixtie's ""Between the Buttons"" album.  Classics from ""Exile on Main Street"" also spice up the film:  ""All Down the Line""' ""Loving Cup"" (Jack White); ""Tumbling Dice""; and ""Shine a Light"".  Two of my favorite old Stone's songs from the 60's are here:  ""I'm Free"" and ""As Tears Go By"" from the ""december's children"" album.  Never before have we seen the Stone's play the 80's classic, ""She Was Hot"".  Beyond that their big hits, the standards, are all included:  ""Start Me Up""; ""Brown Sugar""; ""Paint it Black""; ""Satisfaction""; ""Little T&A""; and ""Jumpin Jack Flash"".
No, Mick doesn't jump as high or shout as loud as he did back in 1981, at his peak. But he still projects more energy onstage than most singers half of his age.  Time may no longer be on the side of the Stones, but I am.  I've been a Stones' fan since the 60's, and I see no reason to stop.  The Stones roll with style, power, and flair.  It's only the Rolling Stones, but I like it, like it, yes I do.  Reading some one these reviews, you'd think the Stones came out onstage on walkers and couldn't play their instruments.  Nothing is further from the truth.",1214352000,45,2535,4.612975391498882
3365214,5,B0014DZ2XC,"SIMPLY PUT, I LOVED THIS FILM AND ITS SOUNDTRACK!!!!  You can not treat yourself to a better experience than this!  From the opening introductory vignettes to the dazzling ending, I was just mesmerized.  I'm not the world's biggest Rolling Stones fan, though I am a fan of their music (not so much their lifestyles), and I have never been able to see them live, but this has to be the next best thing!  I was completely wowed by the stunning visual angles used in this movie, and felt that the soundtrack was an incredible overview of an amazing career.  I saw the movie four times, including in two different IMAX theatres and each time saw and heard new things!

The Rolling Stones are quite an amazing group of people and watching their chemistry onstage was just awesome.  I've seen a lot of rock concerts up close, and this one compares most favorably!  What charisma these guys have, even in their sixties!!!!  Everyone knows their musical and songwriting talent which spans decades, but watching this birds-eye view of their performing skills will knock you out.  Every member of this group seems to have such a unique and interesting performance personality, and their intriguing on stage relationships with each other only add to the excitement.  Buddy Guy, Jack White and Christina Aguilera were also amazing, each in his or her own right, providing clever and unusual foils for Mick jagger and Keith Richards.  I will never forget the trancelike expression on Buddy Guy's face as he traded guitar exchanges with Keith and vocal lines with  Mick.  Even Keith Richards was clearly moved, as he gave Guy the guitar he had just finished playing at the end of the song. Maybe my favorite moment though, was the explosive introduction of Mick Jagger into the theatre during the introduction to Sympathy for the Devil.  Gives me goosebumps thinking about it!

Even the backing members of this band were a true joy to watch and hear.  Each an accomplished musician/vocalist, they added a depth and range to this experience that I don't think I've ever seen in a live performance before. Even if it is too late to catch this masterpiece in IMAX, see it on the big screen if you can.  See it more than once if you can!!!!

Shine A Light even has country and of course, some great Blues.  Buddy Giles number with the Stones, ""Champaign and Refer"", is amazing.  Mick moves and rocks and Keith shows how he is a caring pirate.  Ronnie is amazing and of course, the Stones drumming is constant and on track with Charlie.

3365216,3,B0014DZ2XC,"The Rolling Stones are one of the greatest bands of all time and Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest directors of all time.  For those two reasons, this film should have been fantastic.  Well, at least the sound was fantastic, but why were the cameras on Jagger 95% of the time?  Okay, if they were on him 50% of the time I might have been okay with it, but there weren't enough shots of Keith and barely any shots of Ronnie and Charlie.  Plus, there were almost no shots of the rest of the musicians.  A band is much more than it's lead singer, and the Rolling Stones are much more than Mick Jagger.  At least Keith, Ronnie, and Charlie should get a sufficient amount of camera time.  It's especially frustrating when Keith and Ronnie are playing riffs or solos and the camera is focused on Mick.  I would expect more from Scorsese and I think most others would too.  The highlight of the movie for me was ""As Tears Go By"" and the old interview footage.  It was also great to LISTEN TO songs such as ""Shattered"" and ""All Down The Line,"" but almost every single performance could have been filmed better.  Four Flicks in my opinion is so much better and their are so many more shots of Keith, Charlie, Ronnie, and the rest of the musicians.  Scorsese should have gone through some of the Stones archives to find older concert footage from the late sixties and throughout the seventies.  I swear that so many of these bands need to release DVDs like the LED ZEPPELIN DVD, the BEATLES ANTHOLOGY, THE KIDS ARE ALRIGHT, and TOM PETTY'S: RUNNIN' DOWN A DREAM.  The Stones should really think about going through their archives as a treat for their fans who weren't around to see them in the late 60s and 70s.  Anyway, if you are a Stones' fan and don't care about the camera focused almost entirely on Jagger, then you will love this film.  However, if you require many shots showing Keith, Ronnie, Charlie, and the rest of the musicians playing their instruments, I think you may want to take a pass.",1210204800,9,1999,4.450549450549451

It's more embarrassing than Cheryl Crow's performance (I certainly misused that noun there) of ""Honky Tonk Women"" from that HBO special thing.  And why, oh WHY did they have to completely ruin the dad-blamed ""mood"" by trotting out the greatest embarrassment in American history, the Clintons?

3365219,5,B0014DZ2XC,"Going to see a concert nowadays takes all one's resources.  Ticket prices often go up to three digits, and most likely the best view is watching the band perform on a video screen.  Sometimes people (myself included) are willing to travel long distances to see one's favorite acts perform onstage.  Getting to see the biggest bands, like Paul McCartney, U2, and The Dave Matthews Band is difficult at best.  Ironically, the cost of a ticket to see The Rolling Stones play in Martin Scorsese's documentary/concert film 'Shine a Light' is about the same as it would cost to see a live concert when many of their featured songs were popular.  It ain't like it used to be.

However, the sheer power and able musicianship haven't gone stale nor retro, so the film is a real treat for those of us who have all but given up on seeing them in person.

It is a testament to Scorsese's directing abilities that the prologue, the intermittent vintage vignettes, and the conclusion are uncluttered.  We get our introduction to the band and the various methods of setting up the stage, the play lists, and the operating procedures of the filming.  Mick Jagger and Martin Scorsese go at the logistics in a way that has tension, but never garners animosity or loses affection for the project.  In many ways, it is a labor of love for both sides, but it is Scorsese who seems the most piqued by the end.

On stage it becomes a celebration.  There's no arguing these guys are dedicated.  After an exuberant rendition of ""All Down the Line,"" an early song, Charlie Watts looks directly into the camera and with a few facial gestures lets us know without pretense how demanding it is to be one of the nimblest drummers of one of the most celebrated rock bands ever.  Equally flexible is a slender Mick Jagger who still struts his stuff as well as ever.  Rising to the occasion is the guitar interplay of Ron Wood and Keith Richards, whose camaraderie outmatches Keith and Mick.

There's good will and good vibes all around that never seem forced.  The concerts draw from San Bernadetto and New York City, and the former concert is a benefit for The Bill Clinton Foundation.  Near the end of the introduction, we get the former President, his senator wife, Hillary, and several relatives who get a chance to meet and have pictures taken with the band.  On stage, they've never seemed happier.  The energy has always been there, but the warmth between the band members seldom has seemed more cohesive.  This concert shows them having fun, almost like they've taken themselves too seriously in the past.  Never has Mick Jagger seemed so willing to share the stage.  There are moments that Keith is front and center with Mick off of the venue.  Then, Mick gets almost deferential with guest guitarist, Buddy Guy, and singers Jeff White III and Christine Aguilar.  Even the back up members in the brass section, the dancer-singers, and the other musicians get the spotlight.  As Keith says in a fairly recent interview, ""I don't THINK when I'm up there.  All I can do is feel,"" and more simply, ""We love what we do.""  (Yet, I couldn't help but notice Mick stop in the middle of the stage while he was singing ""Jumping Jack Flash"" as he was in the sites of a pretty fan's picture cell phone.  Some things never change.)

After a huge catalog that forty-five active years can garner, they bring a lot during their vintage performances.  The play list?  Well, there will always be a bone to pick, but what makes the ""light shine through"" is their ability to play any song and make it really rock.  I was surprised, for instance, by the number of songs they drew from `Some Girls,' which happened to be my first Stones' album, but while I don't think it's their best selection, I loved what they did with it in concert.  Besides several tracks from `Some Girls,' they take highlights across the board, but showcase variety in their repertoire.  ""Jumpin' Jack Flash, as an opener, ""Tumbling Dice,"" ""Brown Sugar,"" and ""Start Me Up"" are The Stones playing big, but, then, ""Far Away Eyes"" is a sample country serving that is contrasted with blues numbers like ""I'm Free"".  Acoustically, they play just fine with ""You Got the Silver"" and ""As Tears Go By"".

For a concert movie, they still know how to show everybody a good time.  They are vintage rockers:  smooth, seasoned, but still with a kick after all these years.",1209340800,78,4386,4.654096228868661
3365220,5,B0014DZ2XC,"Just saw the movie in IMAX. What an amazing and phenomenal experience ! So much energy, so much joy, such incredibly vibrant music. Anyone who thinks they are too old, is missing the point. Yes they are scary looking, but their music, performance and soul has aged perfectly. Like fine wine that only gets better the older it gets.

As I watched them I felt I was watching the living embodiment of the spirit of Rock & Roll. Forget the Plastic Four and any other recent contenders, they can't hold a candle to the Stones.

What came across was their enjoyment of the music, the audience and each other. They were having fun, and as simply the best at what they do. They have such musical depth, as well as talent and skill: jazz, blues, country, as well as rock. You could listen and watch forever.

The film was done so well. The concert footage was exciting, and made you feel that you were there. You were also up close with the band. The sound was great, the movie brought the concert into the movie theater.

The movie was mostly focused on the concert in NYC, but there were also clips of past concerts, TV appearances and interviews. It was so funny and it brought out their sly wit and wry outlook very well. The clips were seamlessly integrated and complemented their musical presence. Great job Marty !

Even though I have just seen it, I want to go again, and I can't wait for the DVD. Hopefully it will have all kinds of background goodies. Oh, and I can't wait for the Stones to hit the road again. If you get a chance, go to see them in concert. Its the best show you will ever see (and Marty has captured it).

My only complaint is that they waited until the end to use the song, Shine A Light, it was played over the start of the credits. But it stopped in the middle of the song. Boo. It should have kept playing until it was done (the credits were long enough).",1208131200,9,1879,4.308781869688385
3365221,2,B0014DZ2XC,"Most of the reviews I see here are positive......and I cannot believe it. I was very excited to see this film. Legends, you know....

I always hate when something of quality becomes a caricature of itself. Being what they ""are supposed to be"", perhaps in this case. What would make an amazing rock band care so little about being amazing, and just rest on the idea of ""if we just show up, and plug in, they will applaud.""

This is what was captured on this film.

This is more disappointing than Vegas Elvis. At least Elvis shined, even at  the end, and even with the understanding that he was a ""Vegas act"".

Would Tom Waits turn into this? Would Neil Young? Would Leonard Cohen?... Even if they could? Bowie almost did with ""Glass Spider"", but he quickly bailed, thank god.

Keith, Mick, & Ronnie actually are bad in this performance. Charlie is great. Daryl is great also. Scorcese brought nothing to the table, in my opinion.

I truly wish I had seen something special. I have great respect for their career. Perhaps more than they do...",1207526400,17,1041,4.564516129032258

The mixer seems to have attempted to alter the audio to reflect the perspective of the camera they were on in each shot, so each instrument slides around on the sonic stage and just sounds freaking weird. Ugh. Great visuals but the awful mix ruins it.",1525219200,,308,4.618181818181818
