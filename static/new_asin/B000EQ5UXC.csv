8361632,5,B000EQ5UXC,I looked all over the internet for this anime since it didn't get published here in the region for a while. I finally found the first season of it here in this disk set. The DVD's themselves are organized to have four ep's each and the menu's are all neat and even include extras. I recommend this anime and this set for those who really like it.,1167868800,8,346,4.17910447761194
