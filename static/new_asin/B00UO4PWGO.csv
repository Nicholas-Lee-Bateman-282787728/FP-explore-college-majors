7064339,4,B00UO4PWGO,"Go Man Go is the best of the Globetrotter films. Dane Clark is utterly believable as Abe Saperstein, even though he looks nothing like him. It's nice to see Sidney Poitier even though his role is not much. Still, he helps make Saperstein more believable. I have had the hots for Patricia Breslin for six decades. I was glad to see individual focus on Nat Clifton, Goose Tatum, and Marques Haines. They were the core of the 'Trotters when I was growing up. Even though the film is not historically correct, the emotional plot of the film is, and the struggle of the team to reach recognition is real. I thought this film was lost forever. I even had a conversation with a Trotters staff member about where and when I had last seen it. I am delighted someone found it. I had trouble with the DVD repeating itself at one point, but eventually it worked out. The technology is what kept me from adding the fifth star.",1437350400,4,913,4.440476190476191
7064340,4,B00UO4PWGO,"Have long waited for dvd release of this 1950s movie. At last ......but about 10 minutes in, the movie restarts! We returned for another copy. Same defect, though the movie then plays to conclusion. We'll take that just to see this movie again. Now ....any hope of the second Globetrotter movie will be available on dvd?",1436054400,3,320,4.732142857142857

7064342,3,B00UO4PWGO,"Good film, spoiled by poor DVD-R copying by Mr. FAT-W Video, Long Island. 17 minutes into film, the film begins over. It plays to end but video & audio are out of sync. Also, film is cropped, slicing off title info & some game scores. Picture mostly is clear & clean.",1434758400,4,267,4.254901960784314
7064343,1,B00UO4PWGO,"Defective dvd. After a few minutes, the film returned to the opening credits, and began again. This disc should never have left the factory in this condition. I returned it to Amazon for a refund.",1434672000,5,196,4.628571428571429

8707703,5,B00UO4PWGO,"I saw this in 1964 and have been looking for it for decades.  The story is absolutely true except for two items:  1)  Saperstien is made nicer than he really was.  African Americans could not play in the NBA at that time so he had no competition and he took advantage of this. 2)  The scene close to the end, I think, is a little bit of ""Hollywood.""  However the rest is on the money.  The star players play themselves.  That would be Goose Tatum, Marcus Haynes, and Sweetwater Clifton. The game footage is real.  There is one scene that will blow you away.  I will not spoil it for those who are not aware of it.  The last game footage is, again, real and the announcer is Marty Glickman.  He was a beloved announcer of New York teams.  I heard him for six years and I never heard him once say a word about his past, which he could have easily slipped into any game he did.  That past?  He was on the USA 1936 Olympic track team as one of the relay runners--the same Olympic in which Jesse Owens participated in Germany.  Because he was a Jew, Avery Brundage banned him from running in Germany, given Hitler's hatred.  Brundage was a racist himself, so it was easy for him to comply.

I cannot believe this DVD only cost $10.  I do not want to over sell it.  That can cause expectations to be too high.  I will just say, if you have any interest in basketball, get the film.  You will not be dissapointed.",1496275200,4,1406,4.206766917293233

8707705,4,B00UO4PWGO,Very satisfying print and a lot of fun to watch. I first saw this in the theater when I was 11 years old and it really impressed me. I remembered it many times over the years and was delighted when I realized that a print had been preserved. As a piece of our cultural history it is fascinating. There is not one remark in the entire film about the fact that the Globetrotters were all black whereas everyone on all of the other teams were white. Everything is implied and the messages of the film are still valid and probably important for us to ponder. Acting by Clark was generally very believable and consistent. Sidney Poitier playing a not terribly demanding supporting role is also fun to watch. The conclusion is very exciting. Basketball players were a lot shorter then. I recommend this highly.,1467072000,3,804,4.590277777777778
8707706,3,B00UO4PWGO,"I like the movie (Dane Clark was my second cousin), but the video quality itself was poor.  The video looked like someone created it from a blurry and grainy VHS tape. That was a big disappointment.",1462838400,,198,4.5

8707708,4,B00UO4PWGO,"Whilst I didn't care much for the film itself I had always been curious to see Go Man Go, the only film directed by James Howe Wong. I note that some earlier comments state that after the film has been playing for about 20 minutes that it goes back to the beginning. I didn't have this problem. The film played fine from start to finish and for such a old film that has not gone any restoration the picture quality was very good.",1446595200,,429,4.180722891566265
8707709,3,B00UO4PWGO,"I noticed that the movie restarts at the beginning of the story after about 15 minutes in. It was not a problem to re-edit the movie via software, (trim the extra minutes) but this is very unusual for a Amazon title. I love the movie, but the manufacturer leaves a lot to be desired. The quality of the transfer is as good as one could expect for a movie this old.",1445472000,2,364,4.140845070422535

8707711,3,B00UO4PWGO,"THE FIRST DVD AMAZON SENT DID NOT WORK PROPERLY.  ABOUT 30 MINUTES INTO THE VIDEO, THE MOVIE JUMPED BACK TO THE OPENING CREDITS.  TO VIEW THE REST OF THE MOVIE,  IT WAS NECESSARY TO FAST FORWARD PAST THE 30 MINUTE MARK.  HOWEVER, AT THIS POINT THE AUDIO TRACK WAS OUT OF SYNC WITH THE LIP MOVEMENTS OF THE ACTORS.
AMAZON PROMPTLY SENT OUT A REPLACEMENT DVD - THIS WAS TO AMAZON'S CREDIT.
HOWEVER, THE REPLACEMENT DVD HAD THE SAME FAULTS AS THE ORIGINAL.  THE MOVIE JUMPED BACK TO THE OPENING CREDITS,  AND THE AUDIO WAS OUT OF SYNC FROM THE 30 MINUTE MARK TO THE END OF THE DVD.",1438387200,4,578,4.256880733944954
