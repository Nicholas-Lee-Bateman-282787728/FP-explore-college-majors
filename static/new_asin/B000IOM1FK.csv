8146584,3,B000IOM1FK,"I'm a big fan of Tom Savini and low budget horror in general, especially from the 70's and 80's, but the first 2 movies in this set are so bad and boring I actually fell asleep numerous times trying to get through both of them. The third movie in this set turned out to be a great redeemer, Revenge is the cheesy, gory fun I'm always hoping for when I order a set like this, really well done low budget horror with fun characters, horrendous acting a good pace and decent gore, I liked it a lot, the other 2 movies in the set are amateurish drivel reminiscent of a high school av club assignment.",1350000000,,596,4.191304347826087
8146585,5,B000IOM1FK,"some of the best crap movies ever these are so bad you gotta give em a try

8146586,5,B000IOM1FK,"I'm so glad to see ""The Ripper"" and ""The Revenge"" together on DVD. I was an actress (Andrea Adams) in both of those movies and have fond memories of working with the cast and crew. The special effects for my death scene in ""The Ripper"" were really fun and involved a body mold. I was the tragically disemboweled girlfriend in ""The Ripper,"" and the anxious but unfortunate reporter in the ""The Revenge."" Enjoy them both. And if you want more 80's gore see me in ""Slaughterville"" made entirely on 8mm film, and maybe the worst horror movie ever made ""Blood Lake.""

8146587,5,B000IOM1FK,What you get here is a trifecta of movies directed by Christopher Lewis. All are shot on video which gives a feeling of seeing the movie in the present even though these three movies were released in the mid-1980's. The Ripper is by far the best of the three movies. Blood Cult and its sequel Revenge are decent movies. If you haven't seen them then it is worth it to buy this set since it is so cheap. You get three movies for the price of one. Lots of blood and guts in these movies.,1286496000,,485,4.11578947368421
8146588,4,B000IOM1FK,"Thank goodness that all Horror films are not as good as 'Halloween' and 'ALIEN'!  I have to have my cheesy indies!  Anywho, gotta love those 80's-strait-to-video Horrors, well, maybe not all of them.  This however, is an exception because from what I've read/heard/seen on various websites, not to mention the commentary for this, is that 'BLOOD CULT' is the very FIRST Horror film to be crowned a strait/made-to/for-video release!  In my opinion,  just that alone deserves every Horror fans attention and to have added in his/her Horror movie library.  Like it hints in my title, do not buy this package unless you are able to handle/like low-budget Horror films and can forgive films done on a steadicam, ok acting, cheesy FX, or you're interested in having some early footage of Tom Savini's acting career.  Oh, and I mustn't forget the late, great John Carradine who humbly stars in 'REVENGE' - his last role.  I urge you Horror film enthusiasts to check out these titles if you haven't already!  'BLOOD CULT' has a simple but cool story and has enough blood shed to keep it moving.  I enjoyed watching the faceless-who-done-it murders going in and out of dorms slicing up the ladies while leaving satanic/symbolic coins on their bodies as a way to represent their cult.  Its sequel, 'REVENGE', unfortunately is not as bloody as the first one - in the commentary, the creators for the first 'BLOOD CULT' even admit that it was a BIG mistake to lessen the gore for the sequel.  By cutting out the gore for 'REVENGE', they were desperately wanting it to air on cable TV and to gain a bigger audience - this idea turned out to be a big disappointment to the already, small 'cult' (pun intended), following!  The good news for the sequel, in my opinion, is that it explains, or should I say, gets more in-depth on the murderous cult.  Plus, we get to see the cult (John Carradine) leader's true identity, which is a ghoulish demon! The ending to this is the reward.  On to 'The RIPPER' - a great, modern take on a Jake the Ripper story!  This flick has nothing to do with the 'BLOOD CULT' series - it does have some things in common besides it being a low-budget-shot on steadicam film with cheesy music score and FX.  'The RIPPER' also takes place in a small town, uses an important item (in this case, a ring instead of a coin), as a clue to the killer, has an evil being for a killer, and has a college professor playing detective.  In my opinion, this alone is a three-star film.  I think Tom Savini played a wicked, evil-looking Jack - the eye color is his idea, and boy does it work!  I loved the idea about Jack's ring.  The killings are great, not ground breaking, but good for what it is.  All in all, I enjoyed these three films.

Now about the product itself! For the price to own your on copy of 'Blood Cult', followed by its sequel, 'Revenge' -aka- 'Blood Cult 2', plus, 'The RIPPER', starring Tom Savini, (a cool take on Jack the Ripper!), isn't a bad deal!  Each movie contained in this fat, double-decker keepcase has its own disk, so no flip-floppers - see, isn't that nice to have three disks!?  Plus, each disk has its own artwork, so no boring, silver, shiny, bootleg-looking DVDs here.  Come on, just the product itself deserves a 2-star rating (haha).  The cover art is pretty awesome!  I like how all titles are conjoined together in a hack 'n slash style.  To all you serious Horror Film Collectors out there, 'The Ripper Blood Pack' must be in your library.  It is an important piece of Horror Cinema History!!!",1285804800,7,3536,4.575516693163752
