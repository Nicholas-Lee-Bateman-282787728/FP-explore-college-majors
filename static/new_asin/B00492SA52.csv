This is a quiet O'Henry-eqse 18 minute short detailing the inner working of a long forgotten department that has kept us safe for years.

Fans of Gorgo will love it! Others, maybe not so much but it *is* well made made and enjoyable. YMMV.

I wish it were an extra on the Gorgo Blu-ray but it isn't. So. Be the first to see at Dorkins! Or, well, your DVD-PAL player.",1444003200,,429,4.271604938271605

The D. M. O. A. sits and waits for Gorgo to come back up the Thames.  They've been vigilant now for several decades, possibly longer than you have been alive.

This is an adorable film about bureaucracies AND monstrosities that I first chanced to see when it was shown on the SHORTS channel on DirecTV.  I'm glad to have my own copy now, and I've sent a couple as gifts.

Be sure to watch the EXTRAS section!

A word of warning: this DVD-R disc did NOT play on my Blu-ray player.  It did play perfectly well on my backup DVD player.",1380585600,,577,4.238532110091743
8418815,3,B00492SA52,"A cute short film but there really isn't much to it, get it if you are a real Gorgo fan. NOTE It did not play on my Blu-ray player I had to play it on my computer.",1368057600,,163,3.4324324324324325
8418816,4,B00492SA52,"If you're a fan of Gorgo, I would definitely recommend this short film.  Not to give away the ending, so I will simply say is this was absolutely LMAO funny.  Although it is an all region disc, it is in PAL format so make sure your player can play PAL discs.  That's why it won't play in my blu-ray player, but will play in my JVC DVD players and my computer.  A must have movie for any fan.

8418817,3,B00492SA52,"A very low-budget, silly, predictable little sketch (about a quarter of an hour: the making-of documentary is twice as long), but I can't imagine any fan of the great monster movie Gorgo failing to be amused. A hapless young lady tries to get a couple of older men (one middle-aged, one well past that) to explain the function of DMOA, the Department of Monsters and Oversized Animals, a well-hidden virtually one-room component of the Defence Ministry. They explain. She in the most polite possible manner tells them they're nuts. There is a very mild surprise ending (which no, does not entail the appearance of Gorgo or any other monster).",1297900800,5,642,4.89908256880734
