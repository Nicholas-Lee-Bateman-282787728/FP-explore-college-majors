1917890,5,B0000CBL7G,"Listen Otakus !!!! At last we'll be able to enjoy Kenshin's adventures in a DVD set box!!! In my opinion, everyone who enjoyed reading the ""manga"" and watching the TV series should buy this collection!!!",1063065600,2,203,4.828571428571428
1917901,5,B0000CBL7G,"Rurouni Kenshin... Also, another Anime I caught on Cartoon Network's Toonami section. A story about a wandering samurai repenting for his past anyhow he can, but mainly helping anyone who is in need of it, and he finds some people he can actually settle down with, if only for a while, but he grows very attached to them all, and cares for them so very deeply. Don't wanna spoil the rest of the story for you, so I'll just continue on another subject. I never got to see but 55 or so episodes on Toonami (they stopped there for some reason), but those episodes were beyond magnificant, and I just fell in love with the whole concept of the Series, and bought it, as well as the OVAs and Movie, only after viewing all 95 episodes, and I must agree with most people that the 2nd Season is the best, by quite a bit, and the last Season the worst, but still be able to be called good (at least, in my opinion). And of course, the 1st Season was still really, really good. Both OVAs are exceptional, as well. Though... A lot of people like the OVA (Trust & Betrayal) better for some reason... Maybe because it's more ""Adult"" Themed, and A LOT more serious... Actually, there is not a single bit of Comedy in there... at all. At any rate, this is the best samurai Series, in my opinion, anyway. You should just buy a DVD, maybe one later in the Series, since most like the 2nd Season best, try it, and buy it, if you like it, that is. As for my age rating for this Series, it is: 16+ (Graphic Violence, Gore, Profanity, Sexual Situations, and Adult Complex Themes).",1122336000,6,1559,4.324232081911263
1917902,5,B0000CBL7G,"this first season is what they showed on Cartoon Network but it was edited at least some of it cause even on CT it look more like a show aimed at ages 12 older examples:

Yahiko was showen nude when a boy walked in on him, Yahiko even said (he saw me butt naked).

Kaoru and Megumi were about to bath in a hot springs water and she told the guys not to walk in on them that would sound more like sexual humer.

When Kenshin first meat Kaoru he saw her taking a bath

Kenshin stepping in the women's bathing hot springs but naked he didn't even realise until Megumi and especially Kaoru being so shocked kept stairing down at his private.

Even now and then very little blood would apear.",1119052800,3,687,4.174242424242424
1917903,3,B0000CBL7G,"I'd first like to say that I love this anime, as it is extremely well-done. As to why I am giving this set 3 stars, it regards how it got packaged. For some reason I wasn't all to sure about what awaited me if I looked at the back of a disk, so I looked. The first was dusty, and the same with the second. I wiped them off, and started watching. First disk worked fine, then I got to the second. The picture either A) got pixelated or B) paused for roughly 10 seconds then picked up at another scene. That caused me to look at the other disks and brought about shock at seeing scratches going down one side of the disk. Needless to say I wasn't very happy with that. =/",1107993600,2,669,4.0

Also, check out the OVA's and the Samurai X movie.  This whole set is so beatifully drawn!",1093392000,5,397,4.458333333333333
1917910,5,B0000CBL7G,"A great anime show and these first 27 episodes are great considering they're ice breakers to introduce the concept of the show and the characters.  Quick overview:
Its been 10 years since the Meji Revolution and when the legendary Hitokiri Battosai, the 1 man who tiped the balance of power during the bloody feud, was last scene.  He reapears in Tokyo in time to encounter a martial artist in need, Miss Kaoru, whose style of swordsmanship was being tainted by a fake Hitokiri Battosai.  He then befriends a number of others; Yaiko, son of a samurai whose family was forced into service by a local gang.  Sanoske, who was part of a group working for the Imperialists during the revolution but was inevitably betrayed by them.  Miss Megumi who came from a family of doctors but was forced to develop opium for an underground businessman.
You also meet a bunch of other characters you'll see later or their precense and/or impact is felt later like Aoshi of the Obiwan group.  A lot of the episodes in this 27 pack are linked to a bigger story you seee in the second collectors box containing episodes 28-46.
The animation is excellent, very beautifally detailed.  Fight scenes are lacking but are quite amazing when you see them but this show isn't about fighting rather the story behind fighting.  I highly recommend this for anyone from ages 12+",1092614400,3,1347,4.726495726495727
1917911,5,B0000CBL7G,"Japan, after a long and bloody civil war, is now trapped between the ideals of the past and the promise of the future.  Swords have been outlawed yet the survivors of the revolution are waiting in the shadow.  The defeated wait for their chance to strike back while many of the winners now use their power within the government to gain power and wealth.
Kenshin Himura, once a Imperial assassin, is now the only man the stands between peace and renewed war.  Can a former killer with an outlawed weapon be faithful to the new ways or will his violent ways take control again?
Six DVDs with 27 episodes, outtakes, art work, notes on Japanese history and terms, this is a great collection to have.  Includes the English voices of the very good Richard Hayworth, the independent Dorothy Melendrez, the young Elyse Floyd, the serious sounding Lex Lang, the sexy Wendee Lee, the delightful John Billingslea, the always sweet sounding Rebecca Forstadt (also known as Reba West) and the evil Steve Cannon (the voice of Harry McDougall from the Outlaw Star).  Please note that Elyse Floyd is ALSO Wendee Lee and the cute sounding Sandy Fox also sings the English version of the opening song.
And while not a fan of any ONE Japanese voice actor, the Japanese voices are good too!
I got it used, in so-so condition, so I got a REAL deal.  Some of the episodes are stand alone, but many of the stories are two or more episodes long, with lots of cool fights and tons of humor.  The artwork is so-so, but the rest of the features found on the DVD make up for it.",1088812800,19,1550,4.514285714285714

This is about a man named Himura Kenshin. He was one of the best assasin in Japan during the Revolution he became the Hitokiri Battousai, but when it was over he became a rurouni (wanderer). But when a young girl named Kaoru was getting angry at a imposter who also was named the Battousai she get's mad at the wrong person.

Sorry Amazon I was just about to get this right on this website but reading all the reviews I just couldn't take the chance. This great box set has the first 27 episodes of rurouni kenshin which make up the ""Tokyo Arc"" it's good but not as good as the Kyoto Arc. I don't have the Legend in Kyoto box set but i'm saving up my money. If you get this box set be very careful with the way u handle it because you might get deep scratches in it. This is a great season but u would rather get the second because that's the best I only this first because I want to see the first episodes and I want to get it in order.

1917914,3,B0000CBL7G,"i know fans are going to kill me, but i don't get it.
the first season is...well entertaining don't get me wrong but the action scenes are not that great. theres too much ""monster of the week"" phonemenon. the battles are very...lots of strobes, lots of close-ups, inexplicable stops in the middle of battle to explain your stance. it reminds me of dbz to be quite honest. there's more actual fight choreography in ranma 1/2! and speaking of which, the non-existent but ever-persistent love connection between kenshin and kauru really bugs me. either they get it together or they dont, stop bugging me with what they feel but are afraid to express.
thats my critiques, however the characters are fantastic. my favorite is sanosuke. and the plot really picks up in the 2nd season (kyoto) and has even got me hooked. but the show takes a long time to get going, and for such a recent anime the animation didn't really impress me. the music is overall pretty great though.
i have mixed feelings, but i think everyone should at least check it out. maybe its just not quite for me, but i can appreciate its style nonetheless.",1086480000,7,1119,4.656565656565657
1917915,5,B0000CBL7G,"It's rare to find an excellent series of anime. While Evangelion and Trigun are great animes, there's usually something wrong with them. Whether the series is too complex, too simple, or too slow.  Definately not the case with Rurouni Kenshin.
Back in the 19th century, Japan was in an era known as the Tokugawa shogunate, when a power hungry man defeated the Imperial forces and became more powerful than its Emperor.  Many Japanese imperialists wanted to bring the Emperor back into power.  A man named Kenshin Himura was a samurai known as Hitokiri Battousai, a deadly assassin who helped groups overthrow the government. While the imperialists succeeded, creating an era known as the Meiji Restoration, Kenshin stopped being a hitokiri after a tragedy(watch the Trust/Betrayal OVA's cause there's no way I'm spoiling that). Kenshin decides that he's not gonna kill anyone ever again and wanders around Japan for 10 years.
This is where the series starts.  Kenshin runs into a woman named Kaoru, who's angry at a man calling himself Battousai and killed her father.  Kenshin gets tangled in this and saves Kaoru, and so begins their friendship, with Yahiko, a young ex-pickpocket-turned-student under Kaoru's Kamiya Kasshin Style fighting and Sanosuke, a man who was once in a group that helped in the war and hates the Meiji government for trampling over his group.  Also joining later on is Megumi, a talented doctor who likes to flirt with Kenshin(which ticks Kaoru right off).
This series will reach its peak with Season 2 but this is still a good series and starting point. You'll meet several memorable characters including Azume, Sazume and Aoshi, a commander of another group who's got just as much skill as Kenshin does(and one of the coolest swordsmen on the show).
Not as overtly complicated as Secret Experiment Lain or Evangelion, just as funny as Trigun and Excel Saga, and as much action as Dragon Ball Z(albeit more realistic), Rurouni Kenshin is often mentioned in people's Top 10 Animes including mine and stick around after this set, Season 2 is beyond masterpiece level.",1082937600,4,2093,5.034682080924855
1917916,4,B0000CBL7G,"This is the best anime out there. I also have all the Samurai X movies. Samurai X if you don't know is the an anime of everything that happened before the series. I highly recomend them too. But they are both great because they have fighting, Conflict, freinds, and Romance. I watch the series on tv every time it comes on. I got this mainly to see all the stuff that they didn't let on tv and so I can watch it whenever I want.",1076371200,2,428,4.047058823529412
1917917,5,B0000CBL7G,"Rurouni Kenshin is my favorite anime series period. Everything in my opinion is superb. The story is well thought out and paced very well. The music is terrific, as is the art work and animation. This box set includes the frist 27 episodes in the series.
The series starts off buy giving you insight on who Kenshin used to be and how hes trying to repent for what he did. It introduces the main characters and builds their relationships. There is a lot of action to be found here, but quite a lot of humor too. The humor is typical anime fashion and might turn some people off, but you would be a fool to do so.
If you do decide to get this box set be sure to check out the OVA's Trust and Betrayal first. These two dvds will show you Kenshin when he was ""Battousai the Manslayer"" and you will understand why he wants to repent for what he did in the TV series.",1073779200,7,861,4.161676646706587

I would suggest viewing this series to any anime lover.",1072828800,2,284,4.480769230769231
1917919,5,B0000CBL7G,"This is the first of three box sets (one season in each) of Rurouni Kenshin, THE best anime I know of. This box sets serves as a good introduction for the REAL Rurouni Kenshin, which is on the second season The Legend of Kyoto. This is the greatest series, featuring  amazing animation, good plots, interesting characters, and a perfect mix between comedy and action, UNLIKE Trigun. The action is very, very well done, and never bores you like in DBZ (in which they spend an episode looking at each others' faces). Oh, and the soundtrack is breathtaking. I have seen this box set three times now, and it never fails to entertain me. You should watch it subbed, because altough the dubbing is pretty good, the original is MUCH better, giving it more emotional impact. The characters are very cool and interesting, some you'll love (Ayame and Suzume), others you'll hate (Hiruma Gohei)and others will make you cry (Seta Soujiro). This series is about Himura Kenshin, as he tries to atone for killing a lot of people during the Bakumatsu (Revolution). Back then he was known as Hitokkiri Battousai and was an assasin beleiving he could help build a better world. After the Bakumatsu ended, he swore never to kill again and got a Sakabatou (reverse-edged katana) to protect and save people. Eleven years later he meets with Kamiya Kaoru and thus begins this amazing and unforgettable adventure. Whoever sees this series will never forget it, and I guarrantee you'll enjoy it. Its a long series, but every DVD is worth it, altough I prefer the box set for collectible reasons. The best part is the second season Kyoto Arc, but get this one as well, and also the ending (if you got as far as 2/3, why not finish? plus, altough the last season is not as cool as the second, its worth seeing if you liked the first two) Also get the OVAs Trust & Betrayal and Seisouhen (Reflection) to understand better and also you can get The Motion Picture for those who can't wait for the next box set (like me!). The only complain I have is of the packaging of the DVDs. The cardboard sleeves can scratch the disks and are easy to fall off them, but you can always just put them on jewel cases. Other than that, this is a perfect product, and is worth buying. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE LEGEND OF KYOTO BOX SET!!!!!!!!",1071964800,20,2292,4.563106796116505
1917920,3,B0000CBL7G,"The Rurouni Kenshin wandering samurai -premium box set is a great addition to anyones anime collection, but its mared by poor disk packaging (the disks come in cardboard sleeves).  The Content of the show is excellent and is a great mix of of humor and action. What saddens and fustrates me is the decision by Media Blasters to package the individual disks in loose cardboard sleeves,the disks fall out of the sleeves during shipping and cause really large scratchs on the actual disks, which in turn leads to some of them being unplayable if the box set has been man handled enough.
Take my box set for example disk one was basically ruined with deep scratchs along the outer edge of the disks and a large scar on the centerline of the disk.  So please for the next kenshin box set ask media blasters to include either traditional/ double Amaray type cases or atleast slim CD-ROM/CD cases to prevent shipping damage. Great series tho just be happy that amazon.com has a great return policy.",1069804800,11,991,4.689655172413793
1917921,5,B0000CBL7G,"I decided to pick this boxset because of my growing interest in Rurouni Kenshin. The Bento Box design is a very nice touch, with a gorgeous picture of Kenshin on the front. Inside, each DVD is kept in a CD sleeve that holds two DVD's total. Just be careful how you hold it. If you hold onto it the wrong way, the disc slides out of the sleeves. This set contains all the episodes for season one. Not a bad deal and an amazing boxset design to boot.
PS: Please don't buy the bootleg DVD's on ebay. Show your support and purchase the legitimate copy. Not only will you get this beautiful boxset, but the DVD video and audio quality will be much better.",1069286400,3,650,4.25

1917926,5,B0000CBL7G,"Hey.... for all of you reading this wondering, "" hey if the box set hasn't been relased then how can you give it 5 stars""
- Well I seen both the first and second season on cartoon network and I have all of the ova ( or movies) and all I can say is WOW!!
It has suspense, romance, murder, it has it all!! You see..
Kenshin is a wondering smarai type guy in the late 1800's ( this is a fictional story but it is based on a real time period in Japan)
He was the best assaisin for the rebel army ( they were fighting with the government because it was corrupt) In an attempt to help the suffering powerless citzens of Japan, kenshin joined the rebel army to become hitokiri battosai. This was a name given to him showing that he was the best at assasination. If you rent the movie trust and betrayal you will find out why he changes his view about murder andl ife... but to make a long story shorter the first season and series for that manner is about him ten years after he vows never to kill again..........
I just got the boxed set... and its just wonderful. The artwork is georgeous on the box and sleeves. But its cardboard so that is a major minus. Be very careful about the cd's falling out.. you don't want all that money crashing and falling on the floor do you? But the box is not only pretty , but I fit all of my kenshin cd cases in there( i was bored) so now i won't loose them.
Bonuses
Also they have this funny bloopers section... you gotta see them its funny!!
They have artwork from the artist that did the box and other viewrs that send that stuff in
They have the serise in the english dubb, and jappanese, plus you can get the theme songs ( i think its like 3 total) without subtitles!!
the best part that it has language and japanese culture notes with was really informative and educational ;)
Then it goes from there...
So........
I'm certainly going to get my rurouni kenshin box set.....

7998619,5,B0000CBL7G,"Picture this: a feminine-looking, goofy swordsman who has vowed not to kill, but is secretly a lethal ex-assassin known as Battosai the Manslayer.

Yep, the title character of Nobuhiro Watsuki's ""Rurouni Kenshin"" is a pretty unusual lead for an action series, but then this series is really rather unusual -- a meditation on changing times, and on fighting to preserve peace and life rather than to bring death. ""Rurouni Kenshin - Season One"" is a brilliant combination of sword-swinging action, delightfully wacky humor and a teeny hint of romance. Okay, more than a hint.

Searching for the legendary manslayer Battosai, a young dojo owner named Kaoru assaults a sword-carrying stranger whom she assumes is the one she's searching for. Turns out his sword blade is upside-down, and he insists that he's just a wandering swordsman who won't kill anybody. Unfortunately someone using the name Battosai is disgracing Kaoru's dojo -- and they have their eyes on revenge for an old wrong.

It's only then that the mysterious Kenshin shows what he's really capable of, and who he really is -- the true Battosai. Kaoru asks him to stay on, and they're soon joined by Yahiko and Sanosuke, a teenage ex-pickpocket and a young ""fight merchant.""

Among the other problems: a corrupt assassin who is murdering officials, corrupt police, a bogus faith healer, a sumo wrestler being bullied by his peers, a teacher being forced to take up his sword again, a band of treacherous pirates who capture Kenshin, train robberies, circus sabotage, an old friend of Sano's who is bent on vengance, and a fanatical swordsman who wants to make a warrior kingdom. On the grimmest note, they clash with an amoral businessman who is forcing a young doctor to create a super-potent opium... and has hired the Oniwaban Group (ninjas) to enforce his will.

Based on Nobuhiro Watsuki's manga, ""Rurouni Kenshin"" has become a classic for its story about overcoming the past, fighting for the sake of peace, and for the setting of the early Meiji era -- when Japan awkwardly leapt forward technologically and socially. But on a less epic scale, it's about one young man with a terrible and bloody past, who is now atoning for his past deeds by using his sword to protect instead of to destroy.

The first season starts off fairly light-hearted, but gradually gains some darker shadings (the whole opium subplot) and explores the sociopolitical corruption and strife of all these sweeping changes (Sanosuke's tragic captain Sagara). And obviously any series with a swordsman is going to have some action, and these scenes deliver a whirlwind of sword blows and superhuman leaps, which can do anything from smashing an opponent's arm to hammering a crowd of people to the ground.

But there's also plenty of comic relief in here, usually supplied by Kaoru's short fuse (and her perpetual spats with Yahiko and Sano), and Kenshin's sheepish space-cadet attitude and tendency to get in trouble by doing the right thing.

Kenshin is a lovable, rather odd hero -- he's goofy, spacey, eager to please and polite to a fault, with rumpled red hair and threadbare clothes. But when he fights seriously, he gets creepy empty eyes. Kaoru is blunt and strong-willed but also quite kind, while Yahiko is a sharp-tongued, good-hearted kid. And Sanosuke makes a good addition to round out the cast -- he's got a tragic past as part of the unjustly-maligned Sekihotai ""false army,"" but with Kenshin's influence he begins to move on.

The first season of ""Rurouni Kenshin"" is a mixture of more lighthearted filler and darker, bloodier arcs from Nobuhiro Watsuki's manga. A brilliant classic anime.",1263686400,,3647,4.985197368421052
7998620,5,B0000CBL7G,"Ahh, this was the series that started it all! My love and fascination for anime! True, there are far better animated and written samurai anime series since, but Rurouni Kenshin is easily one of the most popular and recognizable anime ever.

For those few not in the know, Himura Kenshin is a Rurouni - a wandering samurai. He was the Hitokiri Battousai: the most feared swordsman in 19th century Japan during the waning years of the Tokugawa era. After taking countless enemy lives during the revolution, he decides to atone for his sins by living a life of peace and virtual anonymity wandering the countryside.

Now sworn to protect life, Kenshin uses the sakabatou (a reversed blade sword.) But ghosts from his past come back to haunt him, and he must fight to save his his soul, new found friends (Kaoru, Yahiko, Sanosuke and Megumi all have very interesting stories themselves), and for the future of Japan.

In my opinion, this series is one of few if not one of the best English dubbed anime out there. All the American voice actors did a superlative job but Lex Lang as Sanosuke and Richard Hayworth (Cansino) as Kenshin are outstanding.

Rurouni Kenshin deserves to be on every anime fan's list of must have dvds.",1154995200,2,1222,4.723004694835681
7998621,5,B0000CBL7G,"Thanks to someone that provided a picture above you get to see what the box really looks like. A perfectly put together Box set you get the first 48 episodes of Rurounie Kenshin Wandering Samurai but the only problem is this set will leave you with a hunger for more. I hear some reviews saying that if you buy this used and new from a seller than most likely you'll get a bootleg and that's true in a way but you just have to make sure whom you buy from has good reviews from other buyers. If Cartoon Network replays this series again don't watch it because they take all of the good stuff out.

I also have seen some reviews that say this set only contains the first 27 episodes and wow did those guys get cheated cause this is a set with 48 episodes. If you've never seen the series this is a perfect place to start, you save so much money on this box instead of spending tons of cash on those individual volumes fans love so much and won't sell for a nice price. The first episode introduces the kind hearted Kenshin who bumps into his future named Kaoru but neither know it and you have to buy it to know the rest cause saying anything else would ruin this masterpiece. The subtitles are a little off but the voice actors do a pretty good job so I would recommend just watching the English dubbed version.",1140220800,7,1310,4.24
7998622,5,B0000CBL7G,"I got my set of this for 83 dolalrs on another site, so i recommend you look elsewhere.

I review the discs and episodes on my reviews for those sepecific standalone discs.

The packaing is nice and the discs are nice, buy it.",1136160000,5,226,4.232558139534884
7998623,5,B0000CBL7G,"It is an uncontestable fact that Rurouni Kenshin is a great, great series; and I will say up front that this box set is worth buying despite its faults. The show has everything; silly comedy, political intrigue, real, complex emotion; fascinating character development and conflicting purposes; and of course crazy-beautiful over the top, landscape-destroying, bouncing-off-the-ceiling swordfights.

But: there were several issues with the box set that buyers should know.

One: the DVD encoding quality is not great; it doesn't get in the way too often, but you can see it.

I preface Problem Two by saying that it is not worth buying this OR ANY ANIME (only exceptions being Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away and Kiki's Delivery Service) if you are only going to watch the dubbed version. The American voice actors are all completely atrocious; please disregard anything you have heard to the contrary, and imagine a bad porno movie with no sex. The American voice actors have apparently never heard of Japan, or listened to the Japanese dialogue they are dubbing over; the DVD's ""outtakes"" consist of the voice actors demonstrating their inability to pronounce japanese words,  and these outtakes are not much worse than the takes that made it into the presentation. Regardless, none of the characters in Rurouni Kenshin can be separated from their original voice actors except for an occasional generic villian; the show makes no sense when Kenshin is played by a gravelly-voiced caucasian punk trying to sound badass and not succeeding. I'm sure Richard Hayworth has his talents, but he has no business trying to be Himura Kenshin when he can't pronounce his own name.

On to Problem 2: Only 95% of the dialogue is translated into subtitles. This is irritating. Someone will be saying something and you read the line underneath and understand. Then they will follow with a setence that inexplicably lacks a subtitle. This seems to happen at least once almost every episode. Definitely not worth switching to English for. But sometimes you can just tell that what that guy just said was pretty important.

Problem 3: Partly my fault for not researching a little better, but this box set cuts off before the end of the major story arc, the Kyoto Arc (Shishio). It stops after Sanosuke fights with Anji in Shishio's fortress, which those who know the series know is a painful place to have to stop.

Problem 4: If you buy from a customer ""used and new"" because you don't have 145$ to burn, expect to get the bootlegged version (like I did). Bootlegged anime is very common and the quality is still good; I hear it is somehow legal in Hong Kong and Korea where this happens, but whatever, lower prices, woohoo! This is the version shown in the ""customer photos"" above; it has all the episodes, but not all of the extras that the legitimate version has. It has a sort of crappy photo gallery/character bios feature (only Aoshi and Megumi have bios and the gallery is really pathetic) and the aforementioned outtakes: essentially nothing worth checking out. No character greetings, no attack list and no liner notes. To me, that's worth the difference of 80$, though.

And one last thing: the second half of the first disk and the first few episodes of the second disk are filler episodes in the series. While hardcore fans might make themselves endure these, they are not canon, they are not in the manga, and they are really terrible. The animation in these is the worst you will see in the series and you will skip them if you value your time. :) Knowing the quality of the series overall makes it painful for a fan of ""good Kenshin"" to watch Kenshin foiling a band of train robbers on horseback, or teaming up with circus sideshow actors.

All that said, the Kenshin box set is still 5 stars because the quality of the show--much like _true love_--conquers all.",1131667200,26,3863,4.849772382397572
7998624,3,B0000CBL7G,"It's ok, great quality (video), poor quality in the box, printing not even plastic all is cardboard (shame, I simply expected more for the price). 3 stars 'cause of the quality of the playing/viewing only.",1127433600,2,205,4.885714285714286
7998625,5,B0000CBL7G,"I throughly enjoyed the 1st season of Rurouni Kenshin: Wandering Samurai. I have been a fan for a long time and have searched hard to find a good copy of the first season. This season explains all the characters and introduces us to the wonderful story of Kenshin & company. If you like this I recommend seasons 2 & 3 as well as Samurai X: the Movie & the Samurai X OVA (which explains Kenshin's past, cross-shaped scar, & eventual conclusion to all the cast). Amazon is a fine place to find all if your anime needs with wonderful customer service should actually have a problem.",1123545600,,579,4.471698113207547

It focuses on the life of Himura Kenshin, who is a wanderer, determined never to kill again after a life as an assassin.  He meets Kaoru and that is where the adventures begin.  There are fantastic fight scenes in nearly every episode, and in each episode you learn more about each character.  LIghthearted and funny, but also with some sad points as well this series is one of the difinitive anime series to have in any collection.  It has a hero determined not to kill, but just as determined to protect innocent people, a hero that cries for those he hurts.  Intensely compelling, bringing you through the entire range of human emotion.",1122768000,2,706,4.608
