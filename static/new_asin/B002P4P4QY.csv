Intend to finish it over the summer.  However, once again Daniel Auteuil delivers a remarkable performance.  His versatility and ability to conform to any role given to him, makes him one of the most outstanding French actors.  This movie is truly a gem when it comes to teen appeal.  It is funny and so up-to-the-minute with today's teen culture.  My only disappointment was that there are no subtitles and even my most advanced French students will not understand more than half of the dialogue. I am still looking for a subtitled version!",1278547200,,682,4.991150442477876
