1407830,3,B000059H9X,"I like car films and this is a good racing film, not brilliant. The people who have said that this film is better then Fast and Furious, well they are entitled to their opinion, but may be they have a soft spot from HK flicks bcz in my opinion, Fast and Furious is the daddy.
This film is about SKY, a spoilt brat who loves himself and thinks he can beat anyone in a race. Due to an accident during a race, his girlfriend dies and he goes away and meets his long lost father, this is where the film gets good, the camera shots and acting are of a higher caliber for some reason. His father advises him and schools him to enhance his driving/riding abilities. He then heads back to HK from Thailand.
He prepares for a showdown with Hung, a street racer who was king of the street before he went to prision and then SKY took over. Their 1st race ended with the accident and their 2nd race was breath taking, again not Fast and Furious level but still fun to watch. SKY is more mature while hung feels invincible again.
For me as a car fanatic, I watched this movie mainly bcz of MITSUBISI vs SUBARU. Sky in the EVO and Hung in the WRX. These are top cars, probably the best 2 affordable sports cars in the world, great stuff.",1076889600,,1223,4.186440677966102
1407831,5,B000059H9X,"The film is the best, i buy it and i love it, Fast and furious is a kid, this film is the men",1050624000,2,93,3.0869565217391304
1407832,4,B000059H9X,"Ekin Cheng, (Chinese pop sensation), stars as Sky a spoiled 20-something whose wealth, and parental neglect have left him speeding out of control. Instead of love, his parents buy him cars, and Ekin does his best to live up to the rep as the  city's baddest boy on the block.  When an old rival is released from prison, and a tragic accident occurs, Sky is forced to confront his own shortcomings. (None the least of which is his own superficiality). Can Sky defeat his enemy and regain his title? Or is he destined to be a has-been?
 Okay, I'll admit it, I'm not a big 'car' fan, I don't know a Mitsubishi from a Mazda, nor do I particularly care for the irresponsible 'sport' of street racing... But Ekin makes it all worthwhile as the handsome lead in this shallow HK classic. While I could've wished for a lot more character development, and a little more remorse for some of his actions (such as the deaths which Sky inadvertently causes due to his racing), Legend of Speed delivers big time in other areas, especially as an action flick. I recommend this for fans of Ekin's who don't mind a shallow and at times remorseless protagonist.",1050019200,4,1142,4.560975609756097
1407833,4,B000059H9X,"In the streets of Hong Kong, a familar sight of street racing is going on. In this fast pace movie of the Mitshubishi Lancer and the Subaru MRX, this movie a completly awesome. The fast and furious have nothing on these guys. This is truly THE LEGEND OF SPEED!!!!!!!!",1004572800,2,267,4.469387755102041
1407834,5,B000059H9X,"rich-punk kid Sky (played by Ekin Cheng) is known as a street racing god in hong kong, and he races a legendary racer Teng Fung's lil brother and wins, and for winning, he breaks teng Fungs brother's leg so he won't be able to race anymore.
Teng Fung comes back from jail later and races Sky and makes him get into an accident. Sky loses his car and his girlfriend dies in the accident(Kelly), and he also gets framed for Drug possession.
this is all im going to write about this movie because i don't want to kill it.
it's a must see for people interest in import cars. this movie is not all about racing
its also about a rich punk kid growing up to be a real man.
Lancer Evo 5 VS Impreza WRX race...one of the best racing scene i've ever seen in my life.
the first motorcycle race is also great.",1003795200,7,797,4.148387096774194
1407835,5,B000059H9X,"thats what this movie is from top to bottom.by the title and opening sequence you think its just going to be an action movie but it goes much futher. It shows a wide variety of motivations for his racing from a way to release his aggression ,to making someone look stupid to doing something he loves .its a study of sky as his life goes through some crazy turns some for the very good and others for the very worst. In the begining of the movie sky is a little rich kid punk, but by the end of the movie he learns what is important(racing and cars) and becomes a man. So in the end it shows that everything we go through is for a reason and makes us better people .",994032000,,665,4.045454545454546
1407836,5,B000059H9X,This movie is a must see if you are into racing. The racing scenes in this movie are the best i have ever seen.,991526400,2,111,3.6666666666666665
1407837,5,B000059H9X,"I have enjoyed every collaboration between Director ANDREW LAU and Actor EKIN CHENG.  Every single time they come out with a new movie it is extremely entertaining.  I have enjoyed Lau and Cheng's past films:  Young and Dangerous 1-6, The Storm Riders, A Man Called Hero, The Duel, Mean Street Story, and Born to Be Kings.  OK, about the movie... if you like cars, bikes, and speed, than I highly recommend you try this one out.  I picked it up, not expecting much and was completley compelled by the story and races.  Their is a large amount of adrenaline pumping through this movie, but also great seens between Cheng's character, SKY and his father, BLACK TONE, whom also was a dare devil in his time.  SEE THIS MOVIE!!!",986428800,,723,4.6015625
1407838,4,B000059H9X,"The latest collaboration of actor/singer Ekin Cheng and director Andrew Lau, ""The Legend of Speed"" follows ""Storm Riders"" and ""China Hero"".  All great movies, this one has a much less noble protagonist, who's more difficult to sympathize with.
Basically Ekin is a street racer ""God of Cars"" of Hong Kong, has ups and downs- ending in a glorious final car duel with the hardened antagonist, Simon Yam.
Highly modified Lancer Evolution 5 and Mine's Impreza WRX STi,  which are many guys' dream cars; racing on the setting of Princess Road in HK.
Nice soundtrack, and a great storyline considering basic plot.  The lives of important characters such as Ekin's mechanic/friend, girlfriend, and father add to the drama of Ekin's seeming sudden change from punk into Luke Skywalker-esque hero.
To be fair I'll rate it 4 stars, but I've probably seen this movie a dozen times, and still love it.",985305600,4,888,4.946308724832215

7933832,5,B000059H9X,"I'm a long time fan of this movie, especially as it PRE-DATES the FAST AND FURIOUS movies which some malcontents here have decided to compare it to. Judging it solely by the standards of Hong Kong cinema -- and NOT by the standards of bigger-budgeted American action movies that came afterwards -- THE LEGEND OF SPEED is near-quintessential viewing for anyone wanting to seriously study populist Hong Kong cinema: this is popcorn entertainment designed for the widest common denominator (widest, not lowest) among Asian markets, not North American. As such, it contains all the themes, tropes and character dynamics common to, and inseparable from, the greater whole of Hong Kong cinema, that unique packaging of localized elements that make Hong Kong cinema so beloved at home and abroad.

Sure, they've given us Stanley Kwan, Fruit Chan, Wong Kar-wai, Ann Hui and even festie-fave Johnnie To for our film festivals and art houses over here, but movies like LEGEND OF SPEED are the ones that put bums on seats IN Hong Kong and across Asia, especially during the 80's and 90's heyday of Hong Kong's cinema industry, when it still held its own at the local box-office (something it has started doing again in recent years, thankfully).

The main influence behind LEGEND OF SPEED is obviously the anime series INITIAL D, which would itself be turned into a licensed live-action Hong Kong movie many years later, but every review here on Amazon to date, makes no reference to the ""2"" in the Chinese title (as seen on the DVD sleeve). In Hong Kong as here in North America, this is the indicator of a SEQUEL. In this case, not a direct sequel, but a new movie in the same vein as a justifiably famous box-office smash from a few years prior: the Andy Lau-Gigi Leung starrer FULL THROTTLE (1995). Check out both titles at the HKMDB; the Chinese names are the same. While THROTTLE is only related to this film via its theme of illegal street racing (souped-up motorcycles, as such) and its romantic entanglements, it's nevertheless an ideal companion piece, and as highly recommended as LEGEND OF SPEED.",1345161600,2,2097,4.854748603351955
7933833,5,B000059H9X,"Can't say most people will be able to connect with this movie the way I have, but its a fun movie.",1314403200,,98,3.7142857142857144
7933834,5,B000059H9X,"I bought this movie because of watching Initial D live action and loved the different approach to car films, as opposed to movies like Fast and Furious. F&F was completely fake, and lacked a decent storyline from beginning to end, where as this film is more towards developing a decent storyline mixed in with great race scenes and wonderful camera angles. The camera angles made it feel as if you were right there, up close, instead of huge far away shots. The stars were the stars in this films, instead of the cars, and it made it much more enjoyable to watch and get in to.",1193788800,,577,4.452830188679245
7933835,5,B000059H9X,This is way better the only reason fast n furious could be considered better is because of all the visual candy they give you in the movie. Atleast in The Legend of Speed we have a solid plot to enjoy while watching racing and it does have it's funny moments especially Sky's dad. N e ways give this movie a bigger budget and then I bet you wouldn't think F&F was better then this movie,1089072000,3,386,4.16
7933836,2,B000059H9X,"i love asian films, so i rented this with very high hopes after the reviews i'd read, i was so dissapointed.  its just not that good of a film, i can't understand the high star ratings some give it.  as far as being compared to F&F, well, imo this flick doesn't come close.  its just so bad, he looses his girl and never really seems upset by it.  oh yea, breaking limbs if you loose a race?  kinda silly.  and the stupidist thing is a guy goes to attack the star of the flick with a needle that is infected with AIDs.  thats just bad tasted.  the only reason i gave this film 2 stars was because of the EVO and WRX.  although the race scenes don't delievry the same sense of speed as F&F, it wasn't bad to watch.  i recomend renting before buying.",1086652800,,748,4.096551724137931
