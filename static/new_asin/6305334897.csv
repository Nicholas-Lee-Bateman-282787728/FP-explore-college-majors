7888627,1,6305334897,"This review has to do with the format of this dvd. It was manufactured in Korea, and the cover is all in Korean, so there is no helpful information. Also, the chapters are non-existent. One can't look at titles of chapters then click and be at that point in the film (often dvds include a picture above each chapter title that will help the viewer to pinpoint where the chapter is in the overall plot). This film, bought to be used in a film course that I teach, is just about useless. If this is the only version of this French-language classic film, I would suggest that you save your money.",1434326400,,593,4.351351351351352

7888629,5,6305334897,"In a working class seaside town, the bored bourgeois wife (Jeanne Moreau, whose performance here won her the best actress prize at the Cannes film festival) of the town's factory owner (Jean Deschamps) takes her child (Didier Haudepin) to his daily piano lesson (which provide the film's title). One day, a woman is murdered by her lover in a local cafe and she becomes obsessed with the killing and finds herself attracted to a witness (Jean Paul Belmondo) to the murder. Based on the best selling novel by Marguerite Duras (HIROSHIMA MON AMOUR) (who co-wrote the screenplay), the film is a detailed look in the week of the life of a ""woman under the influence"" to borrow from Mr. Cassavetes. I couldn't help but be reminded of Antonioni's RED DESERT, the similarities between's Moreau's and Monica Vitti's discontented characters and situations are too analogous not to. This is a cerebral rather than tactile film which may frustrate the casual viewer but there's a near mesmeric quality that compensates for the lack of fire. The stunning B&W CinemaScope images are courtesy of Armand Thirard (DIABOLIQUE). Directed by the theater director Peter Brook (MARAT/SADE).

The German DVD from Colosseo Film is a crisp anamorphic wide screen (2.35) transfer in both French and German with optional English subtitles.",1357430400,4,1313,5.1069767441860465

In the opening shots of the film be the start of immense parable of abandon, hopeless , loneliness and search of a reason to live.

Maybe, I say it again, maybe this story was a pivotal reference for Polanski in Repulsion.

Moderato cantabile is a gem of this brilliant director Peter Brook and also deserved to Moreau her only Prize in Cannes as best Actress in 1962.",1107648000,8,557,4.388349514563107
