7978994,1,B0000844LC,"I should have learned my lesson with Ground Zero's ""Black Belt Theater"" series, but I didn't.  Their ""Animal Masters Collection"" is even worse.  I made the mistake of ordering five of these double-feature DVDs on Amazon, only to be stung--painfully--just as many times.

Dragon Lee appears on the cover of this DVD and nowhere else.

First, the movie billed as ""Dragon Snake Fist"" is actually ""Dragon Fist Dynamo,"" and it is horrible: horribly acted, horribly directed, and horribly produced.  There is little action and almost no evidence of martial arts skill from any of the actors.  A real piece of garbage, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  The fact that Ground Zero rip-off artists are guffawing as they rake in my money only makes me loathe this deceptive dump heap of ""Grade C"" movies all the more vehemently.

""Killer Elephant"" sports no--zilch--martial arts action at all!  A bunch of incoherent gunfights and lousy acting is all the viewer sees.  I ended up scanning through this entire film and found no kung fu fighting to speak of (at least Dragon Snake Fist had lousy kung fu scenes)!

If I could award this travesty of a DVD--and everything else in the Animal Masters Collection--no stars, I certainly would.  Even worse is the blatant lying and false advertising of Ground Zero.  I've learned my lesson the hard way: DO NOT BUY ANYTHING MARKETED BY GROUND ZERO.  If I can spare you the related anger, frustration and theft of your money, then my mistake will not have been in vain!

Outfits like Ground Zero should be exposed for what they are: charlatans and thieves.  And informed buyers should join forces to put them out of business on Amazon.",1122940800,6,1671,4.851590106007067
