7938236,3,B00005IBMY,"The ""Hondo"" TV series premiered on ABC in September of 1967. While it was a sturdy effort with good credentials, it simply came too late in the dwindling cycle of TV westerns and lasted only 17 episodes. This ""movie"" has been fashioned from the series' first two episodes and fans of westerns will probably enjoy watching it. The better-than-expected cast includes Robert Taylor, Michael Rennie, John Smith, and Michael Pate, and it's headed by Ralph Taeger in the title role. Taeger was a ""man's man"" with an engagingly crooked grin but his career unaccountably never caught fire and after ""Hondo"" he virtually disappeared. Whatever happened to him? His highlight scene here comes when he's staked out, spreadeagle-style, by the Indians who intend to pour of scoop of burning coals onto his bare chest. These ""stake-outs"" were a popular form of ""beefcake bondage"" in TV westerns and allowed muscular actors to show off their sweaty physiques. (For some reason the Indians always stripped off the hero's shirt before staking him out but modestly allowed him to keep on his pants!) Among the actors who found themselves spreadagled across TV screens were Richard Boone in ""Have Gun Will Travel,"" Robert Horton in ""Wagon Train, and Peter Brown and William Smith in ""Laredo."" Taeger's stake-out, however, is one of the best and not just because of those hot coals. In all other cases the actors' legs were spread apart at only a discreet angle but in ""Hondo"" Taeger's legs were spread apart to such a maximum degree that one can almost hear his tendons creaking from the strain. Needless to say, this inevitably drew attention to his crotch, barely contained under tightly-stretched cloth, but maybe that was the whole idea. So much for TV westerns being wholesome entertainment for the family!",1116288000,4,1791,5.0134228187919465
7938237,3,B00005IBMY,"This is a well made 1960's Western based on the earlier 1953 John Wayne film. Ralph Taeger does very well as the laconic scout entrusted as peace emissary to the Apaches by General Crook. The film is compiled from  episodes of the short lived TV series but the continuity is fine apart the  odd piece of abrupt editing. In some ways this version of the Louis L'Amour  novel is more enjoyable than the earlier classic film in that the Native  Americans are more sympathetically treated, and there is a good supporting  cast including Noah Beery jr and Kathie Browne, with guest appearances from  Robert Taylor and Michael Rennie. The action moves along nicely to a rousing  climatic battle with renegade Apaches and a satisfyingly upbeat ending. For  animal lovers Hondo's dog Sam survives in this version!
