8171154,2,B000MRA56A,"I love ""B""/Low Budget movies!  That is EXCEPT this one.  It is just poorly made and makes no sense at all.  The main characters of ""Acid Eaters"" are 30ish, too old for this kind of movie.  They're a completely unlikable, mean collection of dirt-bags.  Except for the time period which I love, there's nothing to hold on to/like in this film.",1377129600,3,341,4.524590163934426
8171155,1,B000MRA56A,"This review is for ""The Acid Eaters"" only:

Films that focus on the psychedelic side of the 60's are always something that will leave most people scratching their heads at some point, with linear thought not a major concern of the film-makers. But this sexploitation attempt at doing so will more likely leave you bored out of your skull!

The basic plot, if you can call it such, is about a group of 9-to-5 workers, who spend their weekends getting high on LSD and having body-painting sex orgies at the lake. That is, when they don't go looking for a giant white pyramid of LSD and end up trapped inside by ""the devil."" No, really. That's the story here.

Director Byron Mabe is no stranger to the sexploitation genre. His work on films like ""A Smell of Honey, A Swallow of Brine"" and ""The Head Mistress,"" while certainly not award-winning material, at least had some of the sleazy and entertaining charms one expects of this brand of film. With this one he over-reaches his bounds, as the attempts to marry the drug culture to soft-core porn is a mix that just does work here.

None of the characters ever really get developed. You don't really learn enough about anyone to care or understand what's going on with them. In fact, only the script seems to outdo them in the underdevelopment department. If there was some kind of coherent plot here, I surely missed it. Nothing in this film gels together. One scene we're watching them get high and frolic at the beach, then someone is killed, and then we go to the white pyramid. There's no rhyme or reason to any of it. The camera work isn't all that great, as we get ""treated"" to an over use of looped segments of the gang riding on motorcycles and scenes that just drag on way too long, or pathetic attempts at being psychedelic, with some swirling colors and the like. Really, it's like they just took every tired clich of these kinds of films, slapped in some boobies jiggling around, and called it good. At just around an hour long, it easily feels four time that in length as you are watching it. Even the ample curves of the delicious Pat Barrington can do nothing to make this piece of garbage watchable. The fact half the cast of this film never did any others after it, I think pretty much says all that needs to be said about the quality and worthwhile value of this bomb. Heck, I don't even think getting stoned could help you to enjoy this pointless and pandering mess.

It is possible to make an interesting and entertaining psychedelic film. ""The Acid Eaters,"" however, will never be one of them. It is a blatant and obvious cash-in on the drug culture of the times, that does nothing to advance any insights into it and only insults the intelligence of the audience that watches it. I really can't say enough about how horrible this movie is. It really gives stoners a bad name... even worse than the one they already have. Avoid this turkey at all costs, as I'm pretty sure it'll do more to damage your brain cells than actual LSD will.",1375574400,3,3005,4.506422018348624

8171159,5,B000MRA56A,"""Acid Eaters"" is trully a 'b-movie' classic. Does it get any better than this?
The plot is the same old story. 4 guys, 4 girls, motorbikes and matching shirts. The gang is out for a fine day of frivolity, foolishness, fondling, and underwater f***ing. They arrive at the secluded beach hang-out and commence to the debauchery.
 One must thoroughly appreciate Artie's jump (he's the short, hairy, long-armed, fruity-beast, who reminds you of a stout young Mel Brooks) from atop the floating party barge and into the water during the gang's initial freak-out. A cinematic highlight to be sure.
Later, after a promiscuous display of lust, one big-titted b*t*h seemingly slays another. (The victim disappears beneath quicksand, leaving to a heroic, one-fingered salute. Then, later, re-incarnates as the pettin' pal for the buffoon, Artie.)
 Soon the gang finds their way to the ""White Pyramids"". (Or at least one of them.) Here, they frolic brazenly within the inner stairways and balconies. At this point, Artie mysteriously transposes into the devil, hands out giant slabs of LSD, and starts granting the gang their individual fantasies.
 One such fantasy sequence features an extended focus on Ms. Barrington Biggums' character as ""Chicky"", during her writhe towards ecstasy. This undoubtedly is thrown in for the young, the virile, and the vivrant to enable them a few frenzied pulls on thee ol' cock. Regrettably too short to allow the viewer sufficient time to ""rub one out"", (unless you are an unschooled, premature ejaculatin' youth) be sure to have your rewind button handy, if you went into this planning on gettin' the one-eyed snake ta spit :)
Next, we are treated to a group acid orgy, which has got to be the most brutal fun imaginable.
As ""Acid Eaters"" shudders to a halt, we see in the end that these wild buxom hussies are actually mild-mannered secretaries during their day jobs. Brilliant.
I found the brief ""cut-in"" scenes and comical usage of mood music to be both visionary and hillarious. This is a journey into the provacative and bizarre. I see direct influence in this movie for cult favorites like ""My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult, esp. their ""Hit 'n' Run Holiday"" LP.
I will go out on a limb and vouch that nobody got an Oscar here, but taken in whole, with the right viewing company, this is horribly good fun.
 The documentary ""Weed"" gives the viewer an insightful look into the state of things concerning Mother Nature's Miracle Herb during the Vietnam era, both stateside and abroad.
 Much of the info contained herein has since been ingrained into our culture concerning the dangers and menaces which afront the users of this beautiful, medicinal herb. Still, ""Weed"" is, none the less, an important historical piece, abtly dealing with the legality issue.
 As nothing has changed since that time, except for the worse, I must again ask, ""How long must these tyrants prevail against personal freedom?""",1194998400,18,2932,4.985685071574642
8171160,5,B000MRA56A,"This double feature from Something Weird begins with 'The Acid Eaters'. If this review was based solely on this film then the rating would have been zero.

The plot (for want of a better word) is: A gang of not particularly attractive women and some ugly guys cruise around on motorbikes interspersed with nonsensical scenes where they strip off. Not even enjoyable after sinking a few tinnies.

The second feature 'Weed' is a gem and gets a thoroughly deserved 5 stars. This 1972 documentary by Alex de Renzy is totally enthralling. He interviews everyone from US law enforcement agents to GIs serving in Vietam to hippies backpacking in Nepal.

It becomes apparent through the course of this doco that 35 years on, nothing has really changed and that all the arguments for the legalization of marijuana in 1972 are just as relevant today as they were back then.

I highly recommend watching this doco to everyone irrespective of your view of the war on drugs.",1188691200,18,961,4.806060606060606
