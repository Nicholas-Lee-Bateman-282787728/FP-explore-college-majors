3643443,3,B001HQ8RMO,"Fun for people who live along the route, or history buffs, or car travel enthusiasts. Television quality - good production values etc.  Can't imagine watching it again, so I'll donate it to our county historical society or library.",1315958400,,231,5.078947368421052

3643445,5,B001HQ8RMO,"This is a nice, friendly, well-edited, informative DVD produced by PBS.  99.9% of the time PBS produces great material, and this one is no exception.  I purchased this one for my dad, and he loved it.  I bet you will, too.",1241654400,4,222,4.365853658536586

3643456,3,B001HQ8RMO,"a really nice video. if you live in PA along Rt 30 you see a lot of very familiar  sights. they used Duppstadts store and western Bedford county a lot. Schellsburg, PA was there a lot also.",1378425600,,189,4.108108108108108
3643457,5,B001HQ8RMO,"It is an excellent DVD about a very interesting subject.  Anyone who is interested in the early
history of automobiles and travel in this country should see this DVD.",1378339200,,166,4.724137931034483
3643458,5,B001HQ8RMO,Never knew about this incredible highway. Now I have added it to my bucket list along with the more famous Route 66.,1375401600,,116,4.318181818181818
3643459,1,B001HQ8RMO,"I was looking forward quite a bit to this, as I love documentaries about roads and trains and things. But this is the most jumbled-up, disconnected piece of boring confusion I have ever had the misfortune to watch. How hard can it be? The highway starts in New York City and goes straight to San Francisco, right? So, FOLLOW IT. East to west, west to east. But no; instead, filmmaker Sebak skips around from one coast to another and everywhere in between: I had to monitor the landscape to try to figure out whether we were in Ohio, Nevada, Utah, Pennsylvania or wherever, because he'd have a little snippet in one state and then backtrack five states for the next little snippet. Drove me crazy. It made me carsick just watching. Photography was lovely, though.",1375142400,11,762,4.651851851851852
3643460,1,B001HQ8RMO,"This video falls so far short of its title, I don't know how PBS put their name on it.

The only other video I know of on this rout of travel is Ken Burns recreation of the first journey from coast to coast via what would become the Lincoln highway with some detours.  This is a fantastic video on the adventure, hardships, disappoints and the triumph of being the first to achieve this incredible road trip.  ""Horatio's Drive""

I recommend you PASS on Ride Along.....",1373846400,7,468,4.470588235294118
3643461,5,B001HQ8RMO,"Here is another DVD in the PBS series written and narrated by WQED's Rick Seback that meets the high standards set by others in this series.  Mr. Seback's gift of narrating as if he was sitting in your living room telling you about his wonderfully interesting journey makes this DVD an excellent gift for anyone interested in American history.  The Lincoln Highway was the first highway to stretch from East Coast to West Coast and now it comes to life through the people you will meet along the way.  The photography is excellent, bringing you face to face with some unique characters and little-known places.",1368748800,5,610,4.79047619047619
3643462,5,B001HQ8RMO,"I am a big fan of Rick Sebak, who quite frankly makes some of the best programming on PBS. As a certified ""road geek"", I love these travelogues. We live in a big, beautiful country and this video makes you want to get out and explore more of it. Yes, you will get a good dose of history, but the video will not bore you. Well worth the money!",1366761600,4,342,3.971014492753623
3643463,5,B001HQ8RMO,"People and stories are the key. History was awesome. I am always happy to see the scenery. I'd like some more one man band. I've watched many road shows this one has done it the best. Video that was in the beginning and during the credits, would've been wonderful to watch, with just music and w/o the graphics. Bernie's story and the scooter dudes were great by themselves.
Rick make more road trips like this one, drop Pittsburgh and go big! The AlCan, Rt 66, Natchez Trace, Oregon Trail, Santa Fe Trail.",1356134400,4,506,4.510869565217392

8309321,5,B001HQ8RMO,"This film is as close as you can get to a great road trip without leaving home.  Anyone who has enjoyed Rick Sebak's other charming films will love this one.  Whenever there are times that I just want to get away but can't actually do so, this film is a perfect substitute.  Don't be surprised if you find yourself watching it multiple times.  It's especially entertaining for anyone who has traveled the general path of the Lincoln Highway in Illinois or elsewhere.",1469232000,,466,4.646341463414634
