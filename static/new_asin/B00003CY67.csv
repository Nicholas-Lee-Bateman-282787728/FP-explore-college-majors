1322997,2,B00003CY67,"Even the most ardent fan of Kevin Smith's films would have to be a little disappointed with his latest offering, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. While tying up (and in) with a few loose ends from his previous films, Smith's latest seems to lack any other purpose. Granted, Jay and Silent Bob are probably the most base of all Smith's characters, and being that they were the stars of this film we should expect the film's humour to reflect that baseness. But the jokes lacked the humour and creativity we have previously seen spout from the mouths of Jay and Silent Bob. The script lacked the intelligence of Smith's other films, and combined with a multitude of laboured cameos, flat dialogue, wasted action sequences (even the most jaded Star Wars fan could have put Mark Hamil to better use) and repetitive camera stares, the audience was treated to two hours of blandness. Not at all what we have come to expect from Kevin Smith.
One has to wonder how a film that involves the likes of Kevin Smith as writer, along with actors such as Ben Afflek, Matt Damon, Chris Rock, Jason Lee and so on, could be so undeniably average. Perhaps it was with the intent of trying to bring closure to his previous films that Smith lost sight of providing a new and individual film for his audience.
The characters of Jay and Silent Bob deserved a far better swan song than what Smith has provided here. Perhaps the DVD will offer some insight into why the final cut of the film was so listless. But special features aside, this film does not seem worthy of sitting alongside your copies of Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma.",1012176000,3,1618,4.582758620689655
1322998,2,B00003CY67,Yeah let's take the 2 most annoying charecters in every Kevin Smith movie and give  them their own movie  .Jay and silent bob make Bill and Ted seem almost cool .The problem with the movie it takes too many shot's at things that have been made fun of a ton of times already. Take the she's all that joke  I mean it is pretty easy to pick on a corny movie from 3 or so year's ago .Also I think the film maker has one too many issues with gay people .Not that I  was offended or am any kind of gay right's activist its just that if your 20 or so minute's through the movie and you've  heard about a dozen or so... and gay jokes it makes you wonder what the film maker is hiding in his closet. Also  too many jokes that try to pretend to be insider hollywood jokes that just are not that funny. The only thing that saves this movie from being all bad is a few choice laughs from Will Ferrel and Chris Rock.,1012003200,2,903,3.9613259668508287
1322999,5,B00003CY67,"Being a huge Kevin Smith fan I of course had to go see this movie one its first showing of the day, I couldn't wait.  I saw it several times after that as well, and it was just as funny as the first time I saw it.  So if you liked Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, and/or Dogma you will enjoy this movie (and come out with several quotes to belittle your friends with) So check out Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back, at least once.",1011225600,4,423,3.9647058823529413

1323003,5,B00003CY67,"This movie had me rolling in the aisles of the cinema. Many say Kevin Smith the genius behind Clerks, Mallrats, Dogma and Chasing Amy (also the actor who plays Silent bob) was accused of being a sell out for putting so many hollywood stars in this film... frankly I think it only makes it better to play star spotting inbetween the many laughs. Some cameos include: Carrie Fisher, Mark Hammil, Sean Willam Scott, Judd Nelson and many more. This movie is well written and ties up all lose ends from previous movies... it's the perfect way to finish up the Jay and Silent Bob characters...

1323178,3,B00003CY67,"Not a great film, but not a bomb either.  Kevin Smith seemed to really think Jason Mewes funny enough as his off-screen troubled buddy to think he could carry this film. I'm afraid he gave it a good shot but the Jay character is too unlikable and harsh to really care about him.
So it's a Cheech and Chong paring for the new millennium with plenty of cameos and eye candy to keep you interested.  I do think Smith knows how to make a film move and the direction is very good.",1502582400,,475,4.1521739130434785

1323545,1,B00003CY67,"I couldn't watch it.  It's not even cut-out bin worthy IMHO.  I mean nothing is worse than predictability, which this film has so much of that I was bored within the first quarter of it.  Yeah, so the writers knew the word F***.  In fact, it makes up a huge portion of the dialogue, if you can grace it with the word :""dialogue"".  One woman uses it around her kid so much that the first word he utters predictable.  Then, woah!  Big surprise, we flash forward in time and child has aged into a character that makes his entrance sing-songing F*** so many times, it slips at once into annoying.  Yeah, yeah, we get it already!  I expected at least a half-hearted attempt a humor, not an utter abandonment of it.  Those who find this kind of thing funny are likely to be that one weird guy who shows up at parties and who laughs loudly at inappropriate moments, entirely unaware of how much of how much others wish he could be uninvited.  Now perhaps I've become slanted by the cartoon, which was quite enjoyable, but all in all, this is a movie that seems to require altered states to enjoy.",1458691200,,1089,4.3681592039801
1323546,2,B00003CY67,"I love Kevin Smith.  He's smart, funny, and I find his best work endearing and full of insight about people and their motivations.  He has directed two films that may always be on my list of favorites, Dogma and Chasing Amy.  I liked Clerks and always laughed at Jay and Silent Bob in those movies.  I thought in ""An Evening With Kevin Smith"" that he himself may be even funnier than his movies.  I'd watch that again as well and recommend it to people I know.  I did not like this one however.  ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" did not have the same spirit as the Kevin Smith films (and the Kevin Smith) that I enjoy so much.  The Jay and Silent Bob characters have always been funny to me until this movie and Clerks 2.  In the last few films the characters just seemed to be pushing the gross-out envelope without the content to back it up.  Kevin's still a favorite and I am still a fan but this movie needs chemical enhancement to be enjoyed.  Maybe that's the point.",1458518400,,972,4.285714285714286

1323618,2,B00003CY67,"I can't imagine that this movie would be worth a watch if you haven't seen Kevin Smith's previous works in this particular film universe.  Because this movie was an attempt to be a celebratory love letter to the movies he had made previously, and also a way to wrap things up while he went and pursued other career paths.  Like comic books.

Thing is, even if you'd seen the previous films that the bulk of this movie calls back to, like I did, it's still not a particularly good movie.  It's basically an hour of callbacks and inside jokes, which are really hit or miss, and about 30 minutes of original content.

This movie basically follows the two title characters as they attempt to stop a film based on them from being filmed.  Not a terribly complex plot, but it's serviceable for what it is.

The jokes are pretty much all gags and dirty sex and drugs jokes.  Some if the humor is actually pretty good.  But a lot of it did fall pretty flat.  And as I mentioned before, a ton of the humor in the movie relies on knowledge of the film's that proceeded this one.  Which even a lot of jokes just were not that funny.  More of a 'Hey, remember this line of dialogue from Chasing Any?  Well here it is again out of context!'

There are also a ton of cameos, mostly from Kevin Smith's older films, and also just some straight up celebrities and industry types.  Some of these cameos are kinda fun, but for the most part they serve as yet more callbacks to older movies.

And that is ultimately the film's biggest weakness.  Even with the callbacks and references, and even if you get them all, it's just not a particularly funny or compelling movie.  It plays out like a career celebration, but feels lifeless and desperate.  And while there is some genuinely good stuff buried in here, I just don't think it's really worth digging through to try to find.  That stuff is better suited for YouTube compilations or memes to abuse on social media.",1456963200,,1946,4.443502824858757

I consider Jay the funnest white dude on Earth since John Belushi..... really///... so off the wall funny.  Also, Silent Bob maintains his perfect character with the Charlie Chaplin routines (but does break the silence at perfect times), Great silent actions,,,,... so cool.

And Chris Rock's work is unreal.... Silent Bob acknowledged that his performance was totally and absolutely unscripted (as the Director, Bob was smart enough to just turn Chris loose and let him go), just spur of the moment off the wall banter. Toooooooo Funnnny . Ride on Rock, no you are Da Man.

Also the great cameos by Ben Affleck and Matt Damom are fantastic .So spoof... and crazy. And as a bonus....there are so many well known actors they are too many to mention.

They play off of each other so well that I am very surprised that they are not in more movies together. This is a comic geek's film with so many laughs in it that I literally split my sides laughing. The title characters are on a revenge road trip to stop a movie about them from being made and on the way they encounter even more bizarre characters even more bizarre than themselves if that's possible. This a Kevin Smith Universe film about characters created by Kevin Smith ( Silent Bob) himself. The acting is just as excellent as the humor running through every minute of the film.

This will prove that you can throw money into a project and get some top name (I did not say ""talent"" 'cause there is not any) and still produce garbage.

Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back is hilarious and doesn't miss a beat; even though the story sidetracks itself from time to time to follow up on multiple story arcs within the movie, it stills keeps the hilarity on track to balance it all out. Overall it's just a great movie. If you're a Kevin Smith fan, well, you've already fricking  seen this like a hundred times.

Some of the jokes are lame, but I think the jokes for the most part hit the notes (especially around the end of the movie).

I remember seeing this in the theater with high hopes.  I was incredibly disappointed.  While very humorous and somewhat enjoyable for the cameos, the writing is not up to par with some of Kevin Smith's past efforts (except maybe Mallrats).  The storyline is silly but would have been OK had the characterization been better.  It's fine for a few laughs but not one I return to often.

I will say the Blu Ray version provides an excellent picture and sound so if you are a big fan (of the film or Kevin Smith) that is a worthy upgrade.",1409616000,,839,4.4868421052631575

1326901,4,B00003CY67,"Believe it or not, this is the first Jay and Silent Bob film that I have seen.  Well, at least that I can remember.  I have to say I was intrigued by their characters although somewhat confused at times too.

In this particular edition, some comic book superheroes that have been modeled after Jay and Silent Bob are going to be hitting the big screen.  And of course they want a piece of it since its about them.  But in finding out about this, and subsequently the internet, they also discover that there's some terrible things being said about the movie and them.  Which makes them angry.  Angry enough that they decide to go out to Hollywood and stop the movie.  They have several adventures along the way including taking up with some strange girls and befriending an orangutan.  But at every corner, there's someone trying to stop them.

Characters:
 Jason Mewes as Jay
 Kevin Smith as Silent Bob
 Shannon Elizabeth as Justice
 Will Ferrell as Federal Wildlife Marshal Willenholly
 Eliza Dushku as Sissy
 Ali Larter as Chrissy
 Jennifer Schwalbach Smith as Missy
 Ben Affleck as Holden McNeil / Himself
 Matt Damon as Himself
 Chris Rock as Chaka Luther King
 Brian O'Halloran as Dante Hicks
 Jeff Anderson as Randal Graves

Jay and Silent Bob are interesting characters.  Being that they're stoners they have a warped sense of humor.  I do like that Silent Bob is indeed silent, it adds an interesting touch to his character.  Jay I found a little more annoying but I guess he provides contrast to Bob.  All of the girls (Sissy, Chrissy, Missy, and Justice) weren't that great and rather unbelievable as characters actually.  There were a lot of guest celebrities as well, which in a movie is kind of odd to me.  It's like they're saying ""hey look how popular we are.""  I always feel its a little conceited.

The plot was rather funny.  They threw together a bunch of unusual circumstances, strange people, and made a movie of it.  Some aspects were a bit unbelievable but I've been led to believe that this is something that can happen quite a bit in these Jay and Silent Bob movies.  For those not familiar with the movies, you should know, there is a ton of cussing and sexual innuendo in the film.  It may not be appropriate for all viewers.  In fact, its probably why I wouldn't rank it as a five star as I think that they went above and beyond what they needed to as far as crudeness.

I'll probably take a look at the rest of the Jay and Silent Bob movies.  They were mildly entertaining.

Then you can get rid of the unneeded disc dvd (or buy a 3 disc case if you want to keep it). You will have all of the feature from the DVD itself and save room on your shelf for more DVDs.

Despite these issues, this movie is fun to watch, but it's not for everyone considering the type of comedy that it does. 8/10",1270166400,,414,4.4605263157894735

1326976,5,B00003CY67,"Am I officially a Kevin Smith fan now?  OK, I wasn't crazy about ZACK AND MIRI MAKE A PORNO; and I haven't seen JERSEY GIRL yet; but I have to say that on the whole, I like all of his other films (yes, even MALLRATS) and frankly am kinda looking forward to both what's coming up next and to rewatching some of the earlier stuff.  Yes, me, a snobby fan of classic Hollywood and the French New Wave - I'm a Kevin Smith fanboy.  Why?  Maybe because some of Smith's growing-up memories as refracted in his films remind me of my own; maybe because Smith himself bears an uncanny resemblance to my best friend in college (who was from...New Jersey); maybe because I've been struggling to escape the low-life myself and Smith sometimes makes me feel sort of OK that I haven't yet.

OK that's going a little far.  But without getting into hyperbole, I think this might have been the most outright fun Smith movie for me since CLERKS.  The cool thing about it to me, having grown up in the 70s and 80s myself, is how much the film played out like any number of crazy chase/road movie comedies of the mid-60s to mid-80s or so era - from IT'S A MAD MAD MAD MAD WORLD through a whole bunch of Disney comedies through the CANNONBALL RUN films.  Loads of guest stars - George Carlin, Judd Nelson, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Wes Craven, Gus Van Sant, etc; a bevy of beauties (Eliza Dushku, Ali Larter, Shannon Elizabeth and Smith's wife Jennifer Schwalbach), and even a damn orangutan.  Only the somewhat large amount of profanity and scatological and drug humor keep this from looking very much like a trip back in time 30 or 40 years.

The basic storyline in fact comes out of any number of such films - our eponymous heroes Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (director Smith) have just 3 days to get across country from New Jersey to California to stop the movie that's going to be made, unauthorized, from their story as pictured in the ""Bluntman and Chronic"" comic.  Along the way they have to deal with the leather-clad jewel thief babes mentioned above, cops, a wildlife marshal, annoying folksingers, and various movie industry types.  I'm telling you, substitute Burt Reynolds and Clint Eastwood for the two of them, get rid of the drug humor and cut the language down, and this could've been done in 1977.  Or heck, just use Cheech and Chong and update the topical references.

But it never feels like a rip-off, and most of the time it barely even registers as an homage - Smith is good at alternating between the really obvious jokes on his childhood loves (the ""Scooby Doo"" van, the flight over the Moon in E.T.) and his own trademark lowbrow humor, and the various elements are integrated seamlessly enough that to me it felt like a giant parodic reworking of the whole ""family comedy"" concept that has largely been replaced by high-concept Steve Martin vehicles today.  I was longing for some ""Herbie"" and some of those Kurt Russell Disney comedies by the end; but I was also pretty continuously amused by the way in which Smith seems to create a whole universe that revolves around all of those innocent memories and transmutes them into something raunchy - and yet, still, somehow just as innocent in a strange way.

Despite the potty humor, there's no nudity - and there's no real violence, after all; the few people that Jay and Bob really do beat up on are, well, Internet geeks.  It's as if Smith is trying to say at the end, damn why can't we go back to these innocent days when people didn't have to obsess over every single thing that every celebrity and filmmaker is doing.  And why do filmmakers have to take themselves seriously - one of the great joys of JAY AND SILENT BOB is that for all the references and knowing winks, you feel like it's a throwaway, like Smith really doesn't care if it falls flat, and really doesn't think he's doing anything special.  And Jay and Silent are his tools to get that across - while at the same time, creating even more of a buzz around themselves and the View-Askewniverse, and Kevin Smith the God of it all.

The DVD is, like all of the DVDs of Smith's films I've seen, absolutely loaded with extras.  I don't personally get much out of the bloopers, and I can see why most of the many deleted scenes in this case were in fact kept out of the original release, but the director commentary is entertaining as usual and the package as a whole is great.  Even if you have mixed feelings about Smith - or, like me, just have trouble admitting you're a fan - and have avoided this film, I'd suggest at least giving it a rental.  You might be surprised, especially if like me you're old enough to remember the 70s and can appreciate Kevin Smith's particular kind of loving - if sometimes deliberately stupid - tribute to some of the films he grew up on.",1264809600,,4823,4.49942726231386
1326977,3,B00003CY67,"I love this movie so I'm not going to bother reviewing it, I knew what I was getting when I bought it, except for one thing...

My beef is with the severe lack of ""bonus"" content on this blu-ray release, there is director commentary, that's it...nothing else.  The price was not bad ($15 at the time I got it) but for a blu-ray disk from a Kevin Smith movie to not have any bonus material is pretty pathetic if you ask me. Major bummer, would have liked more stuff included, I would have paid more for that opportunity as well...

I only buy movies I watch all the time, and when I do buy them I prefer for them to have tons of extras for when I get bored.",1262649600,2,656,4.069767441860465

1326980,4,B00003CY67,"This is one of my favorite comedies of recent years, so I picked up this Blu-Ray edition recently.  A little ways into viewing, I decided to compare with the standard DVD version.  I'm disappointed to say that, I really don't see any significant difference.  I compared a couple of different scenes, notably the early scene in the comic book shop, which offers alot of detail in the background, etc.  I honestly wonder if this truly a 1080p transfer, especially since this is a relatively recent movie.  I did a similar comparison with my Poltergeist Blu-Ray disc (a film made in 1982), and the difference is obvious.....

This, combined with the fact that this release has none of the great special features on the standard DVD except one commentary, make this particular Blu-Ray disc somewhat of a misfire in my opinion.  If you have the standard DVD, I would save your money.

Oh, and in case anyone cares, I'm viewing on the new Panasonic DMP BD60 Blu Ray player, on a Samsung 50"" DLP set.  Pretty much all my other Blu-Ray discs are looking fantastic.

Anyway, I still give this review 4 stars, since the movie is so great, in my opinion.  Packed with laughs, and much more intelligent humor than in many recent comedies of this genre (OK, quite a bit of moronic, base bathroom humor as well!)  It's all good.....cheers!",1244505600,2,1325,4.688311688311688

This is a very funny movie with an awesome plot. At the time, I had never seen the previous Jay and Silent Bob movies, but this is one of my favorites because they get their own movie! They find out that a movie is being made based on them, so they try to travel to Hollywood to stop it from being made. Along the way, they meet some hot women who reluctantly help them on their journey. It turns out that they are jewel thieves and use them to take the blame, but Justice, one of the thieves feels bad about it. They become wanted by the police, and receive help from an orangutan named Suzanne. They finally arrive in Hollywood and find the set of the movie they came to stop. There's more to the story, but that's all I'm telling you. If you love comedy, stoners, and the View Askewniverse, you'll love JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK!!!",1234742400,,970,4.137566137566138

Added to the fact that my big gigantic brain spends all of its waking hours throbbing away trying to stop foolish mankind from destroying the planet from my Castle lair in Wexford, well, sometimes I like some ""no thought required"" downtime, and this delivers in spades. The humour is self indulgent and ridiculous, but it so silly, it is brilliant. They must have almost said to themselves ""can we physically make this scene any more ridiculous? Hell yes, lets try this..."" and away we sink to yet another ""low"". Which is invariably a comedy high. Mark Hamil is ""Cock-knocker"" in possibly his most important role since Star Wars.

This is a great price for what stands up to be a pretty funny flick -- and even though it's not loaded with extras the commentary was worth the pricetag for me. I just love hearing the dude pal around with Mosier and Mewes etc...Is this the best Viewaskeniverse movie? In my book, far from it. But it's also not the worst...

If anyone's wondering, my ranking would be: Chasing Amy/Dogma (tied depending on my mood), Clerks 1, Jay & Bob/Clerks 2 (tied), Mallrats

1327037,4,B00003CY67,"Talk about self-referential, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is just about the most self-referential piece of cinema or pop culture since the theme song for The Monkees. The View Askew universe, or the 'viewaskewniverse' is nothing but a collection of inside jokes, with celebrity cameos galore that are not only self-referential, but self-parodies.

Just when I thought it couldn't get any dumber, I just gave in and went with it, and was actually entertained as a result. I think it was when the van load of hot chicks that picked up Jay and Silent Bob revealed that they were actually a gang of international jewel thieves, got into skintight latex cat suits and began to bend over and stretch in preparation for the big heist. Sure, the wish fulfillment principle was at work, big time, but so what? That is the secret of Kevin Smith's whole oeuvre: every under or overweight kid in the audience can identify because he has had the exact same fantasy.

The only difference is Kevin Smith did something about making those fantasies a reality, even if he has to cast himself as the most self-deprecating character of all in this self-referential self-parody of a flick.

Two thumbs up.

PS: Shannon Elisabeth is really hot in this, though I'm not buying that she could fall for Jay. She looked especially smokin' in those glasses. It was her idea to wear them, because her character was named Justice, and Justice is blind. At first they wanted Heather Graham but she turned it down because she couldn't fathom how her character would ever fall for Jay.

PPS: Jennifer Schwalbach Smith (Missy), one of the international jewel thieves, is Kevin Smith's real-life wife, making her film debut. Several scenes of her making out with Ali Larter (Chrissy) were among those cut to prevent the film from getting an NC-17 rating.

hitching from New Jersey to Hollywood, you're guaranteed to see some interesting faces. this movie is full of big names. Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Chris Rock, Will Farrel, Jason Biggs, Jason Lee, James Van der Beek(er somethin like that) Shannon Elizabeth, Wes Craven, and others.

Strike Back is much less dialogue heavy than Kevin Smiths other movies. this may be a good or bad thing depending on your perspective. i kind of wish there were more drawn out conversations. still, this is just as great as anything else in the chronicles.",1189641600,4,987,4.72093023255814

The uncompressed PCM track though is where this disc shines. It is far superior to the DVD edition and I was more than happy enough with this purchase simply from that. The audio track provides crystal clear dialogue which never hurts in a Kevin Smith movie.",1188864000,2,610,4.350877192982456

1327117,5,B00003CY67,"Kevin Smith proved with J.S.B.S.B. that he is no longer just a glorified independent film maker. In past films, Kevin Smith seemed to have a limited appeal, mostly among arm-chair directors (such as myself)who had become jaded with the Hollywood film industry, but with his slap-stick-like middle finger to the movie industry he seems to have branched out and struck a note with the ""MTV audience"" (10 to 16 year olds). Smith's grade-school humor, delivered mostly by Jay, is nothing new to previous movies, but with the focus on Jay & Silent Bob this humor became more evident AND more inviting to a younger audience.

Nonetheless, Smith has not alienated his core audience who are, ""...over and underweight guys who can't get laid."" (See Holden McNeil in ""Chasing Amy""). The simple visual affects, as in his past movies, are FAR overshadowed by the fantastic dialogue he writes which has Hollywood stars chomping at the bit to deliver. If anything, the only disappointment was a very thin plot. But as he did in Mallrats, for what J.S.B.S.B. is lacking in plot, Smith sure as hell made up for it in laughs.

Too stupid to realize these people don't even know them and are commenting on their characters, Bluntman and Chronic. They decide to go to Hollywood to stop the movie from being made.

On their trip Jay falls in love with Justice played by Shannon Elizabeth. She and her three friends convince the guys to steal a monkey from a testing lab as an animal rights protest. The real reason is as a cover so the girls can steal diamonds from a nearby building. After stealing the monkey they are pursued by a federal wildlife marshal played by Will Ferrell.

The middle part with the jewel thieves and stealing the monkey almost grinds the film to a halt, it's that stupid. The beginning and the end however, are very funny. This a self-indulgant film but for me they were the funniest parts. I love inside jokes and people who can make fun of themselves. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are very good as themselves acting in Good Will Hunting 2: Hunting Season, as well as directors Gus Van Sant and Wes Craven. There are a lot of good cameos: George Carlin, Chris Rock, Judd Nelson, James Vander Beek, Jason Biggs and scene stealing from Star Wars legends Carrie  Fisher and Mark Hammill.",1159056000,,1455,4.61003861003861

Almost every joke in this movie that didn't center around profanity or flatulence was a nod to one of Smiths other movies. Maybe if you are a great filmmaker you can get away with that, but if you have only made 4 other films (very poor ones too by cinematic standards) then that just means you have the worlds biggest ego.

The film looks as if it was written by a highschool kid, although the humor really dosen't reach even that level. Here is a recap of the types of humor in this film. Making fun of fans, fart jokes, scatological jokes, profanity (yes this is actually supposed to be funny in and of itself), making fun of miramax, making fun of the viewers for actually being stupid enough to pay to see this film (I swear I am not making this up), and any number of inside jokes involving the cast and crew.

This movie comes across as crass, tasteless, profane and generally an abject debacle in all respects.

And Jay and Silent Bob get angry because everyone is dissing them on the internet due to how stupid their comic book characters are. So the two clueless drug dealers go out and try to stop the movie but they don't really stop it...the plot kinds of just stops when Jay finds the love of his life, Justice, who is supposly in a lesbian jewel their gang.

One of the great things about the film are the cameos. Mark Hamil, Carrie Fisher, Chris Rock and the list goes on and on. On almost every scene, you will see a new cameo. The story itself rocks and is Jay & Silent Bob at its best.

The deleted scenes from the film are fantastic. The best thing about them is that they are all introduced by Kevin Smith, Jason Mewes and others from Kevin Smith's comic book store ""Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash"". My personal favorite scene is when they are in the bus restroom, that part is hilarious! Many of the scenes that were deleted are extremely funny and should have been left in, in makes some of the story make a little more sense, not that it doesn't already, but it just gives more of a back story to the characters.

The Secret Stash is more deleted scenes and add-lib lines by Jon Stewart and Will Ferrell. All of them are introduced by Kevin Smith, Jason Mewes and others.

Mallrats sucked because it was just Clerks in a mall, Chasing Amy sucked because it was a romantic version of Clerks, and Dogma had most of the cast and charecters from Clerks in it.

First of all, this movie comes with a prerequisite that is required to fully enjoy this movie.  That's right, watch the earlier Smith movies, but trust me it helps with the jokes.  That's because, although Smith likes to have fun with his movies, this time he just went all out.  Parody after parody of his movies and, once the comic duo is in Hollywood, parodies galore of other people's movies.  So, if you understand the parodies then you should enjoy the move a whole lot more.

However, I personally wanted something more from the movie than that, and felt disappointed when I saw it was just a long gag reel.  Smith usually has a serious side to him, which keeps his movies winning awards, but this time he, deservedly, cut loose.

In my opinion though, Jay and Silent Bob, no matter how good the characters are for a few off an on laughs, probably should not be the basis for a whole movie.  The humor was crude and way too slapstick, makes sense, but I still wanted more from it.

1327315,5,B00003CY67,"Kevin Smith's `Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' strikes me as being the closest Smith has come to doing a movie in the style of Woody Allen. Like Allen in many of his films, he uses the same basic character, in this case, the Jay and Silent Bob duo, in situations which parody some other major movie genre. The target in this film is both Star Wars and movies based on comic books.

The story is very much a continuation of the background situation in `Chasing Amy' where Ben Affleck and Jason Lee play two cartoonists who create a comic `dynamic duo', Bluntman and Chronic, based on Jay and Silent Bob and their exploits in the movies `Clerks', `Dogma', `Mallrats', and `Chasing Amy'. Many stock Smith characters and actors from these movies appears in this film, including Matt Damon appearing as himself, Jason Lee appearing as both the cartoonist and the owner of a local comics store who clues Jay and Silent Bob into the fact that Mirimax is making a movie based on the Bluntman and Chronic characters. Affleck also appears in two roles as cartoonist and himself, in a scene out of `Good Will Hunting' which he plays with Damon, with Gus Van Sant playing himself as director of same. Chris Rock from `Dogma' plays the director of the `Bluntman and Chronic' movie. Two `Star Wars' veterans, Mark Hamil and Carrie Fisher appear in brief roles to beef up the `Star Wars' theme. Even Alanis Morrisette appears briefly as God, based on her role in `Dogma'. About a half dozen other Smith chronies also appear here and there in cameos.

Before you write this off as a quirky exploitation of earlier Smith material plus a generous amount of larceny involving both George Lucas and Stan Lee material, just think about how many times you laughed at the latest toney romantic comedy like `Laws of Attraction' and `Irreconcilable Differences'. If much of the humor in this movie is `cheap', at least it's funny. Some of the other cameos are funny just by their showing up. Casting Jon Stewart as a news reporter is worth a chuckle just by the sheer obviousness of the casting. Will Farrell, of course, does a terrific job as a clueless wildlife marshal and Dietrich Bader does a good job playing the role of the keystone cops as the leader of the security forces at the mythical Miramax studios. As Smith points out in the commentary track, Miramax does not have a studio.

Running gags abound. The interaction between Jay and Silent Bob is one long gag. The only problem with that is that Silent Bob breaks silence twice, which may be once too often. This worked better in `Dogma' where he also spoke only twice, but with only two or three words each time. Smith copies Woody in having at least three sly bits of business where the cast looks knowingly at the audience, generally with the intention of wondering why we the audience are so dim as to be watching this very silly movie.

But that's the point. This is an intelligently silly movie, very much in the spirit of the Marx Brothers and Woody Allen of `Take the Money and Run' and `Sleeper', but not so dumbly silly as the three stooges or `Dumb and Dumber' or `Rolling Kansas'. It appeals to people who are `in the know' in much the same way as James Joyce's `Ulysses' or William Faulkner's `The Sound and the Fury' quote Homer and Shakespeare respectively. This makes the movie eminently watchable a second and third time, even before you get to the excellent Kevin Smith extras.

I think Smith does a better job than just about anyone else in providing good extras and good full-length movie commentary. This one is done with his constant partners in crime, producer Scott Moser and Jason Mewes.

This movie shares with all of Smith's movies a superficial vulgarity overlaid on a depth of sight, casting, and verbal gags that I challenge you to catch all on the first viewing. I would sooner own this DVD than just about any other comedy done by anyone other than Smith or the Woodman himself.",1095724800,10,3948,4.632857142857143

1327317,5,B00003CY67,"Kevin Smith is known for making all kinds of different films, but no matter how deep his meaning or serious he gets he's still mostly loved by teenagers and stoners alike.  Unlike most pretentious directors who think they are above their fans, Smith gives his fans exactly what they want.  This movie is a pure laugh fest from start to finish starring our two favorite stoner creations to date: Jay And Silent Bob.

Jay and Silent Bob need to get to Hollywood because someone's making a movie about Bluntman and Chronic and they want it stopped.  What's their reason?  People are badmouthing them on the internet.  The result is a wild ride including most of the characters from all of Smith's films in this hilarious addition to Smith's already unique library of movies.

I had a few doubts about this movie because I thought it would be a stupid film with no depth starring the two popular characters just making stupid jokes.  Honestly, that's exactly what I got only I LOVED it!  There's something about the weak writing, almost sheer lack of a plot, but just loaded slapstick witty comedy that just kept me hooked throughout the entire movie.  Couple that with enough celebrity guest stars to pack an awards ceremony and you now have a phenominal success.  Any fans of the series should check this movie out.

From the deleted scenes to the commentary, there's no doubt about the fact that this DVD delivers enough extra features that they compete with the film.  If Jay and Silent Bob make you laugh and you've loved Smith's jokes from the Chewley's Gum Representative in ""Clerks"" then there isn't a thing on this DVD you won't enjoy.

Along the way an uncountable amount of cameos appear and offer comedic appearances to keep the film moving when Jay and Bob aren't in it.

The Special Features are far superior than any other Kevin Smith film, 42 Deleted Scenes that would have been great in the film. Damn you MPAA, ruining a movie that had to be cut down for you!!!! But Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is still a good movie without some of the cut stuff.

Plot Summary: Jay and Silent Bob must travel to Hollywood to stop production on the movie adaptation of Bluntman and Chronic.
Review and Comments: Don't ask why, just sit back and enjoy the ride. Or don't enjoy it. This movie is one huge ""in joke"" for people who enjoyed the movies Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, and Dogma...particularly the first three. And it helps if you have a working knowledge of Hollywood inside jokes and United States Popular Culture. This isn't just a ""Jay and Silent Bob"" movie, it's a send-up of movies and filming in general.
Basically, what happened here was that Kevin Smith decided to make one long movie about the characters of Jay and Silent Bob, the annoying stoner and his usually silent sidekick that will be familiar to fans (and anti-fans) of Smith's films. If you've watched the movies and you know that the characters annoy you, it's a safe bet that this movie will annoy you even more. If you think the movie might be fun, watch it. Jay and Silent Bob aren't alone here. There's a long list of actors reprising their various roles from earlier Smith films, and they appear at different points throughout the journey.
Oh yeah...the journey...there is a story here, however slight. There's a movie being made about the Bluntman and Chronic comic. Jay and Silent Bob find out that people on the internet are bad mouthing the movie and the characters, so they travel to Hollywood to stop production on the movie before it can ruin their reputations. Or something like that. Along the way, they meet up with various side characters, including a group of girls traveling in a van fulfilling virtually every Charlie's Angel's joke you ever dreamed of. Jay falls in love with one of the girls. She loves him. There's an orangutan involved...
Listen. If you've read this far, you know what kind of movie it is. It's not pretending to be good (in fact, there's a running joke about just how bad this movie actually is that continues throughout the actual movie). It's one joke after another, a lot of them miss, but there's enough jokes to ensure that some of them will be funny. After watching several serious movies and immersing myself in Kevin Smith films for the past few weeks, I appreciated this movie. What else can I say?
The Bottom Line: Strictly for those who are fans of the characters.",1086048000,2,2791,4.838912133891213

I own it simply because it was a gift, if I had the choice, I think I would have returned it for something better.  Don't get me wrong, the movie is really good, in the Hollywood Comedy sort of way, but I'm sadly disappointed that it's not funny in the Kevin Smith sort of way like I (or anyone for that matter) would have expected.
I'm really sad to see the end of an era with Kevin Smith, it seems that he's really run out of steam and has now succumbed to Hollywood just for the sake of making a buck. Clerks, Chasing Amy, Mallrats, even Dogma all contain that funny movie with extremely intelligent undertones, this however is sadly just a comedy.

That kind of thing would really come in handy for the morally conflicted viewers like me when watching Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. This film was a huge source of guilty pleasure despite my offended ears. Not since South Park the Movie have I snorted and chortled so much at a cheap budget flick (or any kind of flick).
The plot is purposefully so thin as to be lucicrous:  Jay and Silent Bob, two drug dealers with minor roles in other Kevin Smith movies, hear that a movie is being filmed that is exploiting characters based on their real-life personae.  The hapless duo find out that not only have they been cut entirely out of the deal financially, but that internet weenies all over the country are bad-mouthing them (as internet weenies are prone to do).  More than anything else, this is what enrages J&SB to take action, embarking on a journey to Hollywood to stop the film.  They must defend their reputation with the ladies, after all!
The best moments of this movie, though are:
1. The way J&SB's journey takes them to all the major movie characters they've dealt with before, tying up a few loose ends and showing ""where are they now"" in  tongue-in-cheek cameos.
2. The running joke involving abuse constantly being hurled at Miramax from every direction.
3. The fantasy ""sequel"" to Good Will Hunting's famous ""how d'you like them apples"" bar scene.
4.  Ben Affleck taking obvious pot shots at stupid things fans say in reference to his character(s) in past Kevin Smith films
5. Instant classic one-liners too raunchy to repeat here
If only Jason Mews (Jay) could refrain from the F word every other phrase I might be able to proudly display my J&SB with the rest of my DVD collection.  As it is, this mom of two boys can't set a decent example and have her comedy, too.  So until that explevator is invented I'll just have to get my fix of Kevin Smith the old-fashioned way; sneaking, cringing and laughing in the dark.

I wasn't keen on Jay to start with, but I grew to like him, after watching a full 90 minutes worth! He seems like every typical young teenage guy - doesn't cut his hair, uses words that would make a sailor blush etc. He would be quite nice looking if he cut his hair, but I suppose that's part of Jay's image now. And watching him in the extras, he looked really feminine - until he faced the camera, and we saw a lovely moustache. The rapping bit at the start is fantastic. And believe it or not, you do become immune to them saying the F-word!
I prefer Silent Bob to Jay, although he was better in Dogma. Some of his facial expressions are great, and he manages to rival Jay, without having to say a word. In Dogma, he used a cigarette as a prop and one scene in that made me laugh, but there wasn't any of that in this. It was mainly waving his hands, and gesturing wildly.
Kevin Smith seems to like having the same celebrities in each film - Jay & Silent Bob, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, George Carlin to name a few. But this film seems to rip off every film under the sun - Charlie's Angels, Entrapment, Matrix, Jumanji, Planet Of The Apes, Winnie The Pooh, Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, Scream, Mission Impossible and ET, are the ones that I managed to spot.
Also, the number of celebrities that make cameos in this - Carrie Fisher, Seann William Scott, Ali Larter, Shannon Docherty, Wes Craven, Shannon Elizabeth, Jason Biggs, James Van Der Beek, & Jamie Kennedy, among many others.
The scenes between Matt Damon, and Ben Affleck are absolutely brilliant, cos there are so many references (even with scenes where Ben Affleck is alone), and they totally slag each other off.
Shannon Elizabeth plays the same character I've seen her play in every film - the beautiful, if not slightly ditzy girl and she'll annoy the hell out of the girls watching it!
This is definitely one for the guys, to drool over Shannon Elizabeth & Ali Larter in tight black PVC suits. I did enjoy the film, and I did find myself liking it more towards the end, but it's a total rip off. And you also have great fun playing spot the celebrity & spot the movie rip off.

Gross-out humor is fine every now and again, which is why I bought the DVD after watching it in the theater. I still get a kick out of the Silent Bob outburst, and the reunion at the end was a fun surprise for someone who has seen all the ""Jersey Films"". But on the whole: my least favorite View Askew Production.
I buy DVDs for the goodies, and this one has quite a few. The one great flaw I found with this DVDs goodies (like all other Kevin Smith DVDs I've seen) is that in order to get to the truly funny bits, the cut scenes, you have to listen to him and a cast of others describe the scene you're about to see, why it was cut, talk about Ben Affleck, and pimp the brick and mortar store, THEN you get to see a 25 second scene and start the process again. I have yet to find a way around this annoyance.

Previously featured in all four of Smith's prior films (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma), the comedic duo, played by Jason Mewes and Smith himself, return for one last ""d-ck and fart joke"". This one marks the finale to the Jersey saga.
When our title characters find out there is a movie being made about comic book heroes based on their likeness, they attempt to cash in. When they discover that it is causing several militant movie fans to diss them based on it, they make it their goal to stop the production before it can even get started. Along the way, they meet up with a clan of lipstick lesbian jewel theives (led by leather-clad bad girl Eliza Dushku) who are posing as animal rights activists. Jay ends up falling in love with Justice (Shannon Elizabeth), one of the girls in the gang but when they blow up their van as an escape, he believes that she has been killed.
While ""Strike Back"" puts on a good show with more cameo appearances than you can shake a stick at and some very cool visual flare, its writing falls a bit short. The witty Kevin Smith who I came to know and love in ""Clerks"" seems nowhere to be found in this one. Smith seems to have taken a break from doing his clever back and forths between characters. His best written work here seems to be reserved for venting his frustrations with the Internet community and dispensing an endless barage of toilet humor.
If you're a die-hard fan of Kevin Smith, there's no point in arguing with you, you probably own the movie and have seen it more times than you care to count.

Jay and Silent Bob, who played roles in each of these movies, were a highlight, which probably gave Smith the idea to feature them as stars of his next movie.  Bad idea.
Jay and Silent Bob were like the pickle with your pastrami sandwich.  It's a really enjoyable part of the meal.  But what happens when you make an entire meal out of nothing but pickles?  There, in a cellophane wrapper, is what you have with J&SBSB.  I laughed maybe three times during the entire movie, mostly at Will Ferrell (who plays a clueless Forest Service agent).  Jay and Silent Bob were absolutely unfunny.  The romantic line (Jay falling for a beautiful jewel thief) is utterly unbelievable, and the diaglogue completely unfunny.  I enjoy good cussing as much as the next guy, but you will enjoy this movie only if random cussing and guys telling people other guys are gay, by themselves, are riotously funny.  In short, this movie primarily appeals to 12 or 13 year old males with less than average intelligence (or the equivalent).",1062460800,9,1135,4.686868686868687

1327623,3,B00003CY67,"""Strike Back"" has to be the best of Kevin Smith's movies in the Jay and Silent Bob series.
As with all his previous flicks, Strike Back is not for everyone. Start to finish, it is filled with profanity and sexual vulgarity. But it's funny. Jay and Silent Bob are, for once, the lead characters in the comedy. In the plot, they decide to travel from New Jersey to Hollywood to stop a movie about the comic ""Bluntman and Chronic"" (which was based on their own pot-smoking/selling lives) from being made. A silly yarn typical of Kevin Smith movies.
What really makes this movie worth seeing is the number of cameo roles put to excellent use - recognisable actors (Shannon Elizabeth, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon etc.) appearing in cameo roles and simply making fools of themselves is a lighthearted break from standard Hollywood blockbuster.
To really ""get"" Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, you do need to watch at least a couple of Smith's older movies (Clerks, Mall Rats, Chasing Amy, Dogma), especially to catch some of the jokes.
So in short, if Kevin Smith's vulgar humor is what you enjoy, then it's definitely a worthwhile buy, but if you didn't appreciate the crudeness in some of his other movies, perhaps it's best to pass on this one...",1060473600,2,1238,4.709677419354839
1327624,1,B00003CY67,"I recently saw ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" at the home of an older sibling and I must say that this film is downright disgraceful!! Basically, it's a 10-minute film that is expanded nearly ten times the length by being padded out with an endless stream of profanity and useless innuendo.
Although there are some noteworthy cameos from some well-known actors in this film, their appearances do not save this film quick enough. Unfortunatley, this film is a failure from the very first 'f-word'-this occurs less than a minute after the film has begun.
How ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" made it onto the big screen is beyond me. How it made it onto DVD is even more questionable. There is no acting and there really isn't much of a storyline either. However, there is one scene in the film that sums up the entire movie. It is where Jay and Silent Bob are reading bad reviews on a film they recently made. Basically, what they were reading is correct of THIS film.
""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" is a complete waste of time and money. Thank goodness I saw this film before even considering to buy it. This film does not even deserve the 'one-star' rating above. I give it 'half a star' only because the cameos are the best thing about this film. As for the rest of it? I'd recommend setting up a video camera, recording yourself and a silent friend saying roughly 90-minutes of foul language with lewd behavior, and you'll more than likely have made something as equal, if not better, than ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"".",1059955200,5,1530,4.547101449275362

Jay:Just your average stoner who hung out in front of a store with his friend Silent Bob.

Silent Bob:He doesn't talk much, but he's Jay's best friend.  He agrees on everything Jay does, and he goes with Jay to stop the movie, so he won't be called him names, for the rest of his life, as well as Jay.

1327679,2,B00003CY67,"Kevin Smith has had a pretty varied career in terms of quality product. His first feature Clerks, which is my own personal favourite of his and something that I think he's never matched since, was brilliant because it was razor sharp, superbly written and actually quite insightful. It tapped into a gen-x underside to small town life, made up of people who are too intelligent to waste away their time in low-rent, boring jobs but find that's what they choose to do rather than make the attempt to really better themselves. More than anything it demonstrated that you don't NEED special effects and egotistical A-list stars to make a good movie, you just need raw talent and ingenuity. Mallrats is much more of a fan-boy picture. It's funny, hilarious at times, but the humour felt somehow stretched, as though Kevin had simply been asked to do more of the same on a bigger budgeted, studio outing with better actors. It's really just an escapist, feel good romantic comedy. Chasing Amy on the other hand, made for only about 250,000 dollars, was superb, a funny yet poignant and acutely observed film about contemporary sexuality and relationships. Dogma: an interesting failure, good ideas and intelligence let down by excess and sloppy direction.
All of which leads you to conclude that Kevin Smith is a genuinely good filmaker, but his talents lie best in writing, and if he must direct, then he should limit himself to low-maintenance, understated indie movies. Give him a huge budget and he tries to cram in too much, too many visuals and too many inconsequential details. He doesn't have any real sense of cinema aesthetics or mise-en-scene which means his films can look badly shot and put together. But he's a very funny guy, with a knack for realistic and erudite dialogue and situations. It's a shame therefore that as far as some people were concerned his major contribution to contemporary cinema was the creation of Jay and Silent Bob. Many have noted that the guys are fine in small amounts, as comic characters designed to temper the more normal people we meet in Kevin's films (lets face it, they could have been left out of Chasing Amy without any major repercussions) but too much of them and we begin to see that they really can't carry 90 minutes of screen time on their own.
Not that they're forced to. At least Kevin managed to secure the talents of many quality actors for this film, including cameos from just about everyone who's been in a previous View Askew production: Chris Rock, Jason lee, George Carlin, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Joey Lauren Adams, Brian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Carmen Lee etc. He even manages to dredge up Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill for a couple of scenes (Mark Hamill has to have, amusingly, a onscreen caption with his name when he appears, due to the fact that he hasn't done anything noteworthy for about 20 years and is therefore unrecognisable to Star Wars fans). Unfortunatly that's one of the movies most signifigant drawbacks. It's very much an insider film, full of self-referencing and in-jokes from other films by the director, and if you haven't seen these movies then you might be a bit non-plussed at times. Then again, if you haven't seen these movies you're unlikely to be rushing to see this one. People say he made it for the fans, and that's fair enough, but I think the fans deserve better.
That's the second problem and probably, now I come to think of it, a more important one: the movie isn't actually very funny. Oh it has its moments, it is Kevin Smith after all, but nothing like the volume of quality gags we saw in any of the earlier films. There's an amusing Scooby Doo parody which, to be fair, gets more laughs in about 5 minutes than the recent feature did in an hour and a half. There's Jay's impassioned speech on behalf of the Coalition for the Liberation of Itinerant Treedwellers (geddit?). There's even a very welcome 'Good Will Hunting' sequel: 'Hunting Season', and it's nice to see Ben and Matt send themselves up so freely. But a lot of the movie grates. Jay isn't a marvellous character to listen to for over an hour, some of the material is obviously recycled from the comic books (which fans will presumably have read), then there's a lot of redundant ... jokes and profanity just for the sake of being profane i.e. that swearing alone is somehow inherently amusing.
It's not a total disaster, and the quickfire approach to the gags means that while little is set up or developed sufficiently to make the jokes really funny, if a line or visual hook falls flat, there'll be another one along in about 15 seconds, so you ought to be able to find something amusing in there. By the way the film, I noticed, came under a lot of fire from certain pressure groups due to accusations of obscenity, homophobia etc, but if you actually watch it you'll realise that it in no way condones anything Jay says; he's like a five year old with tourrettes and it's funny because he has no idea how stupid and offensive he comes off.
Flawed, but Kevin Smith is now working on a more mature and intellectualy challenging project, so hopefully this kind of low-brow, juvenile slapstick is behind him now.",1048118400,4,5187,4.707370737073707

This is in the same class as movies like Strange Brew which take familiar characters and give them a simple plot line to follow.  No great surprises but surprisingly witty in parts.

His endearing tale of love and homosexuality won back the critics again, with his bittersweet ""Chasing Amy."" Then Smith truley earned his wings as one of the top filmakers of the 90's with his controversial ""Dogma,"" which finished the decade off with a bang.
All four of these films in the ""New Jersey Trilogy"" featured the often silly, usually crude, dimwitted stoner duo, Jay and Silent Bob. Now since these two comodic clowns had been Smith's trademark supporting characters in his previous films, Kevin (seemingly against his will) must have felt obligated by his fans to cast them in leading roles. Thus, the creation of his worst effort to date, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.
The story, which I'm sure you already know by now, features Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith) in a road trip buddy vehicle en route for Hollywood in the efforts to stop ""the Bluntman and Chronic"" film with their comic book character likeness from being made. The rest ins't even worth mentioning.
The thing that is lacking from this film is the cutting edge, witty-but-crude diologue that Smith is so richly famous for.(Smith is an avarage director, at best and he's gone on record in admitting so.)
Instead of the contruction, and the ultimate  deconstruction of a Dante Hicks or Holden McNeil, we get an endless barage of fart jokes, stoner gags, and homophobic dialogue that would make Archie Bunker cringe. Not even the usually funny (but not in this film) Will Ferrell or the rest of the endless supply of celeb. cameos can save this dump of a picture (What the hell is Jules Asner doing in a Kevin Smith film anyway?!?!)
""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" was supposed to be the last harrah for two characters that, long ago, recieved more on-screen time then they ever deserved.

Too many junior high jokes for me, and you also get the feeling in this movie that Kevin Smith really begins to take himself seriously and believe all the hype, and you think that he may be laughing all the way to the bank.
I'd like to see him get back to what he did in the other movies and leave the acting to the actors like Jason Lee and others.

Shannon Elizabeth was so great during American Pie, then turns on this good girl routine here, and just gets really annoying, cheasiest ending. Ben Affleck was okay, but he's not really as good of an actor as people say he is. He was good in Changing Lanes, but that's it! Chris Rock was one of the best ones here, but he only had one scene, which shouldn't have got him on the front cover. Matt Damon is just like Ben Affleck, only worse. Eliza Dushku is the only one besides Rock and Smith who actually has character, and she's the reason why I watched this movie. She was sexy, evil and delightful to watch.

I watched this movie with my friends and they all laughed at the ongoing sex-jokes, but they never laughed at the parts with the old Kevin Smith characters like Dante and Randal, Brodie, or even the part with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. There is a reason for this. Because they didn't see Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, or even Dogma. So of course they all thought that this was hilarious. But me, having seen the other movies first, did not laught that much because of how good the others were. Clerks was by far the best, Mallrats was funny, Chasing Amy was pretty funny, and Dogma was the second best. But the problem with Jay and Silent Bob in their own movie is that it loses the funniness because we see too much of them. In the other Smith movies, they are just shown in certain scenes which makes them even more funny. Now it is just all about them. Kevin Smith also loses his ear for good dialogue in this movie. He went from really funny conversations in Clerks with the use of great dialogue, to a bunch of slang words that only immature teenagers laugh at. If you are a true Kevin Smith fan, only buy this to complete the New Jersey collection. But other than that, you might now like it.
""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" runs fro about 1 hour and 40 minutes. It is rated R for non-stop crude and sexual humor, strong language, drug content, and some cartoonish violence.",1042848000,,1552,4.392361111111111
1327746,5,B00003CY67,"I hate to imagine that anyone has seen this movie without knowing anything about Kevin Smith or the movies he has produced over the years.  But in most people's cases I think that holds true.  For instance, while I was working this past summer I heard a co-worker say something to the fact that ""Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back"" was the worst film she'd ever seen.  Being that it's one of my favorites, I asked her if she'd seen the popular movie ""Clerks"".  She said no.  I then asked her if she had seen either ""Mallrats"", ""Chasing Amy"", ""Good Will Hunting"", ""Dogma"", or any of the ""Star Wars"" movies.  I didn't even bother asking if she'd seen ""Drawing Flies"", since most Kevin Smith fans haven't even seen that one.  But she replied no to all of them, although she'd heard that ""Chasing Amy"" was bad.  Hmmm...that's interesting.  Actually, it's funny, considereing that every one of those movies makes this one that much better.  She looked at me as if I was a colossal moron, or at least a skeevy stoner.
I realize that Kevin Smith tried to make a movie that anyone not privy to his previous movies could enjoy, but let's be serious.  If you haven't seen the above mentioned movies you won't truely appreciate this one.  And that's fine.  If people want to be that shallow and/or one-dimensional that's their problem.  I'm sure there's plenty of die-hard Smith fans who can honestly say they 'got' this movie.  Take for example the episode of the movie where Jay and Silent Bob hitch a ride with Scooby-Doo and the gang.  Now, if you had not seen the 1996 B&W comedy ""Drawing Flies"", you wouldn't really understand why (or how) they came to ride with Scooby.  Because in the movie Jason Lee makes reference to who the leader of the group should've actually been.  I believe it was Shaggy, but that's neither here nor there.  Or how about the part where Holden opens the door and says 'look at these morose m*therf*ckers right here; it smells like someone sh*t in their cereal.  Bunnggg!'  Let's see, wasn't that a line that Jay used in ""Chasing Amy"" when first seeing Holden?  Yes it was.  Do you see where this is going?  Let's not forget Jason Lee's chocolate-covered pretzel quote he says while in his comic book store.  I believe you'll find it at #2 or so of my BEST 25 MOVIE QUOTES listmania list; but anyway, if you never say ""Mallrats"" you would have no idea what he's talking about.  On the other hand, if you did see ""Mallrats"", I'm sure (at least I'm hoping) you got the joke.  The point is I could go on forever listing ties between those films and this one.
Anyway, if you hadn't seen any of those movies, one thing you can enjoy is the talent of the cast.  Aside from the two stars Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith, you have Ben Affleck (Holden McNeil/himself), Matt Damon (himself), Jason Lee (Banky/Brodie), Will Ferrel (Federal Wildlife Marshal Willenholly), Chris Rock (Chaka Luther King), Shannon Elizabeth (Justice), Seann William Scott (Brent), Brian O'Halloran (Dante Hicks), along with many many more.  And when I say many more, I'm not kidding.  Just check out the cast list and I'm sure you'll be mildly impressed.
For those of you who were wondering if this movie has any sort of plot, it does.  Forget what anyone else might tell you, but the plot is good.  And once again, you must know some key facts from other Kevin Smith movies to understand this movie's plot.  The Bluntman & Chronic comic is based on the characters Jay and Silent Bob, but not their real-life characters, if that makes sense.  Holden and Banky Edwards (""Chasing Amy"" co-stars) designed the comic and payed both Jay and Silent Bob likeness rights for their involvement in the comic; although it is not directly.  Consequently, had you not seen ""Amy"" you wouldn't know anything about this.  Another thing I hear a lot is that the movie is nothing but swear words and stupid jokes.  And in response to that there's not much you can say.  That's who Kevin Smith is.  He uses curse words, whether people like it or not, to make his movies.  He's not making excuses and he's certainly not apologizing.  But come on, show some respect.  Coming from a guy who's first movie cost downwards of 28-grand to make, he's come a long way.  And he does it by using those infamous dick and fart jokes; again, whether you like them or not.  And for those of you who don't really enjoy those jokes, you should look forward to Smith's next production: ""Jersey Girl"".  I think it comes out early summer 2003.  It is supposed to be a new type of Smith film; without the 'snootchie-bootchie' lingo we are all used to.  It stars new Hollywood couple Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez, along with Liv Tyler, George Carlin, and Jason Biggs (who played himself with a small role in ""Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back"").
But really, the point I'm trying to make is simple.  You must see ""Mallrats"", ""Clerks"", ""Chasing Amy"", ""Dogma"", ""Good Will Hunting"", ""Drawing Flies"", and even the ""Star Wars"" movies to fully understand, and enjoy, this movie.  I could go on and on all day with similarities between the movies, but I've only got so much time (and a 1000-word maximum).  Once you've viewed all those movies ""Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back"" should do a little bit more for you.  If it doesn't, well, then you're not a Kevin Smith fan.  What can I tell you?  But before you go knocking a brilliant piece of film, make sure you know what you're talking about.  That would be like watching the third ""Scream"" movie before the first or second.  Come on, it's just common sense.",1042588800,2,5540,4.58087487283825

One the flip side.  I laugh at this flick each and every time I watch it.  Jay and Silent Bob are by far the most charismatic characters Kevin Smith ever cam up with.  Brodie is pretty close I'll have to admit.
So anyway, it's the story of a couple of losers with a comic book based on their lives that gets sold to Hollywood.  They read some pretty harsh critisms on the ""internet,"" and they decide to go to Hollywood to stop the movie.  Along the way they meet a group of Scooby Doo wannabes, Shannon Elizabeth as Justice, That Farrell guy from SNL, and Mark Hamill, as well as releasing a bunch of animals from a testing facility, an interesting conversation with a hitchhiker, and finally getting to Hollywood.  This movie is NOT family fun.  This movie is frat house fun.
The soundtrack is beautemous.  Very good.
It's the last movie in the Kevin Smith series.  I dare say it's the funniest.

It was kinda funny at first, but then it was just like ""are they Eminem or something?"" Other than that, the movie was really funny. If you liked ""Dogma"" you should check this out. In my opinion, Dogma was a much better film. Bloodier, but funnier. It invovles pretty much the same overall cast. The DVD has a lot of good features. I would reccomend that you rent this movie or watch it or something before you decide to purchase it. And a word of advice: Don't let your parents watch it!

Jay and Silent Bob are a magnetic duo, mid movie I found myself thinking that years from now when we list enduring comedy duoes Jay and Bob are going to be up there with the big guns!
As a movie though it fails in comparason to Clerks which was so much more fresh and raw and Dogma with its new look at an age old issue.
The Dimension Collector's Series DVD is super, jam packed with extra goodies. Kevin and Jason chatting, out of charecter, highlights a key issue tackled in the movie...that art and life are sometimes mutually exclusive.  This is reflected in the movie by the protagonists' chrachters being thrashed on the net for characters based on them which fuels their drive to continue on their journey.
What a bizzare journey it is.  Full of inside jokes, references to other Kevin movies, homages to the fugitive and screem to name but a few and an ensamble cast that keeps on coming!

1327812,5,B00003CY67,"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is hilarious!! As usual, Kevin Smith brings back most of his movie alumni's for star roles or great cameo appearances. It's amazing how many people showed up for this one including of course Mewes and Smith (Jay and Silten Bob), Jason Lee, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Shannon Doherty, Joey Lauren Adams, Chris Rock, Brian O'Hallarahan (Dante), Jeff Anderson (Randle) and of course there's even more stars in this one than Dogma like Will Ferrell, Judd Nelson, James Vanderbeek, Jason Biggs, Shannon Elizabeth and many more! Truly the star quality in this alone is great! I swear in almost every scene there's someone.
The special features (if you have the 2 disc set) is great! It includes the ""I Got High"" video from Afro Man, the Comedy Central Canned Ham: Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, hundreds of deleted scenes and alternative scenes. Again, very cool!
A definite must! I this one is just all out great for comedy fans and even movie goers that normally wouldn't be into something like this.

1327814,5,B00003CY67,"I loved Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back. From the actual DVD, to the outtakes and deleted scenes on the second disk. Our not so bright heros learn of a movie being based off of the comic book Bluntman and Chronic, and are talked into going after their cut of the royalties. With cameo performances by Jason Lee as both his prior characters Banky (Chasing Amy), and Brodie (Mallrats), Ben Affleck as Holden (Chasing Amy), Brian O'Halloran (Dante/Clerks), Jeff Anderson (Randall/Clerks), Mark Hamill as the 'movie villain' & of course, our overly reprised heros Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith).
 The story is the trials and tribulations the dynamic duo go through to prevent the Bluntman and Chronic movie from being made due to reviews at a random internet site by people who are self styled movie critics. During the course of the film they duo are duped into breaking into an animal testing lab and stealing an orangutang, falling in love, going across country, and ultimately leading to redemptions.
  If you're a Kevin Smith fan, you'll enjoy the comedy in the movie as it's run of the mill Kevin Smith humor, and of course his shots at general pop culture, along with influences of his in filmmaking are always a good reason to watch it.",1036886400,5,1255,4.7214611872146115

Is he alive or in jail.  He isn't in any new movies and even though the new Kevin Smith flick isn't out yet, I figured he'd be in some stoner movies.

To say this movie features an all-star cast is a bit of an understatement. Judd Nelson, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hammil, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Will Ferrel, the list goes on and on and on!
The DVD extra features are pretty sweet. The deleted scenes are hilarious. The two music videos are fun.
It's sad to see an end of an era. But Kevin Smith put the Jay and Silent Bob line to rest with the sort of vulgar grace they desrved. All-in-all, a great movie!",1036540800,,730,4.258992805755396

In any case, this movie was excellent.  It had wonderful comedy and that antics of Jay and Silent Bob are always a good laugh.
I think the main reason I liked this is just because of its simplicity.  It's not complex, but it has a good story.  The actors are amazing as always and the cameos by famous people is always a good thing.  The vixens in this movie definitely separate it from the other movies that Kevin Smith has done, and they definitely add a little spice to the movie.

The Will Ferrell stuff is worth it, but the movie didn't need to be made.

The film takes Jay and Silent Bob to Hollywood in an attempt to stop a movie about them from being made. The antics of the ""road trip"" are much of the movie.  It is hilarious.  The characters from past movies that show up, the new ones, the cameos. This movie is just fun.  There is nothing deep about this movie. The movie buff wouldn't call it a ""film."" But that is the great part.  It is not trying to be art, it is trying to be funny. And, in that, it succeeds admirably.
I mentioned cameos. . . Try this on for size, Mark Hamil, Carrie Fischer, Judd Nelson(a bit more than a cameo), Morris Day and the Time (yeah, the guys from Purple Rain) . . . and probably some I am forgetting about.  They are all great.
It kills me that they are not doing any more of these movies.  I think that Jason Mewes is actually maturing as an actor.  He has gotten good over the progression of these movies.
I am glad to see that they ended the series with a bang.  The characters are great and a lot of fun.  This is the a great movie and should be on everyone's DVD rack.  It was on mine the day it was released.

Well, here you go.' And in the meantime, he also decided to make fun of the studio execs who no doubt were also pushing him to make a movie that was sure to pull in millions at the box-office. And based on what? Name recognition and cameos. So I suppose if you want to see all the old characters from the other Smith movies thrown together, saying the same things they did in the other movies, go for it. I suppose, to be fair, it's hard to top a movie like 'Dogma.' That movie may have had its share of cameos, but at least Jay and Bob were funny.",1034812800,3,719,4.070422535211268

Low-brow juvenile humor can be some of the best when done with flair, but there is little flair here just a rehashing of characters, a littany of gay-innuendo jokes so much so it seems an obsession, a couple of worn-out and dated nods to Star Wars, and endless flat senseless dialogue.  The Silent Bob skit has run its gamut and his silence is more annoying than funny.  When he does speak its not set-up, it's not ironic, it's not much more than just explaining a routine comment leading the inane plot along it's treacherous course through the doldrums of comedy hell.
A litany of F-bombs does not equal funny expect when it's presented in a funny context, said in a funny way, or set-up to get the laughs.  In Jay and Silent Bob the characters drop expletive after tired expletive and expect you to laugh without any nod to humor involved. I just want to try to save you from this DVD before Jay and Silent Bob Strike you in a most unfunny way.  Move on...there's little to laugh at here.",1034640000,3,1139,4.38388625592417

At least she doesn't take such a disastrous fall herein as Kirsten Dunst did in ""The Virgin Suicides"". Refreshingly, Ali's character Chrissie admits to being a ""bad girl cliche"". She gave me pause by repreating a frequent movie assertion (hopefully strictly an urban legend) about what girls don't do.

Now, this movie is NOT for people who are easily offended, who are upset by the F-word, or who know little about pop culture.  Smith lambasts a wide variety of things, from religion to Star Wars.  Also, if you have missed any of the other 4 View Askew movies, wait to see this one until you have seen them all.
As for extras, this DVD has plenty.  There are so many outtakes, it took us a week of evenings to watch them all.  Of course, there is a director's commentary, which I rarely watch, unlike the clerk's one, this is worth at least sampling.

1327910,4,B00003CY67,"Given Jay and Silent Bob, one can bet that seriousness is the last word to describe this movie.  It veers more on the silly Mallrats side.  After hearing that not only is a movie based on Bluntman and Chronic is being made about them, but with negative profanity-laced Internet reviews, our two heroes decide to go to Hollywood and stop the movie in order to prevent people from talking smack about them.
How to categorize this movie?  A buddy movie?  A road movie?  Guy meets girl movie?  Chase movie?  Two men and a bab-- I mean ape movie?  It's all of these rolled into one fattie of silliness.
This movie is rife with Kevin Smith's usual pop culture references, especially Star Wars--the opening title, guest appearances by Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill, with an obvious parody involving the latter.  That alone is worth watching the movie.  Other references-- a funny one involving Scooby Doo, Planet Of The Apes, Purple Rain, E.T., The Fugitive, American Pie, Scream, 80's music videos with babes, the Internet, and caper movies.
The scene at the Moobie fast food place has its bright moments.  After posting a heavily profane reply to a movie website, Jay tells Silent Bob:  ""Keep our eyes on the prize and let nothing distract us.""  Enter Justice in 80's hard rock video slo-mo for hot girls, with waving long hair, and Bon Jovi's ""Bad Medicine"" starts on cue.  Jay is totally smitten with her and there's a funny switch from his fantasy to reality.  And hey, Justice looks great even with glasses.  In fact, her line to her girlfriends, ""We all gotta grow up sometime,"" is the main reason why Smith may have decided to end the Jay and Silent Bob movies.  And what better way than to have them as stars instead of being peripheral characters in Clerks, etc.?  Besides, the relationship between the duo becomes kind of strained, due to Jay's lack of common sense, not to mention math skills, and his constant bashing of Bob is more vicious than playful name-calling.  And Bob seems more aggravated of his partner--see him rip into Jay RE ""Critters of Hollywood.""
Another beaut:  Holden asks the duo ""Who'd pay to see Jay and Silent Bob?""  All three then look at... yes, us!
Oh yes, lest I forget, Justice and her three girlfriends are ostensibly (key word here) out to liberate animals from a testing lab.  Jay and Bob rescue Suzanne, a smart (smarter than Jay, anyway) orangutang.  She does make a brief appearance during the end credits of Mallrats if you remember.
This is also a reunion of actors and/or characters from previous Kevin Smith movies, as well as guest cameos.  Jason Lee plays both Brody (Mallrats) and Banky (Chasing Amy), while Ben Affleck plays Holden McNeil (Chasing Amy) and himself.  Yes, there is a scene with Dante and Randal (Clerks), but Randal comes off better than Dante.  Chris Rock, George Carlin, Shannen Doherty, and other View Askew alumni appear as different characters.
Shannon Elizabeth shines as Justice, a girl who's not only stunningly beautiful but decent to boot.  Honors also to Eliza Dushku as the leader of Justice's gang.  As for Animal Wildlife deputy Willenholly (played by Will Ferrell), it's a tossup between who's more mentally challenged--him or Jay.  His scenes don't exactly illuminate the movie, and he's more of an annoyance here.
Not exactly the way I would have planned the finale of the View Askew series, but oh well.  Randal and Alyssa put it best:  It wasn't as good as Clash of the Titans, but at least it's better than Mallrats.",1032566400,2,3500,4.773710482529118

But you can hit next scene to just skip over ""Not-So-Silent Bob""(no offense meant to this great director).  All and all it was a great movie, but to get the real feel for the characters you should see Kevs other 4 movies (especially Mallrats, then Dogma if you're open minded, then Chasing Amy if your a girl, & then Clerks if you don't mind low budget black and white).",1029196800,,691,4.236641221374046

The gag real is good and so is the behind the scenes footage and the comedy central Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.  I think there were something like 42 deleted scenes with intros from Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes and somtimes the producer and other people.  The trailers are good (both the 5 or 6 J&SBSB ones and the ones for 40 Days and 40 Nights, Clerks, Clerks Uncensored, Chasing Amy, Dimension cutting Edge Films and the J&SBSB soundtrack spot).

1328001,2,B00003CY67,"The following review only talks about the features found on the DVD, not the movie proper.

""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" is an intentionally slapdash movie that deserves an intentionally slapdash DVD treatment.  I'm just not sure that it needed an intentionally slapdash double-DVD treatment.
Disc one features the movie, presented in all its crisp colourful glory.  The commentary track that accompanies it, usually a solid staple of all Kevin Smith DVDs, is a real let down.  Only Smith, producer Scott Mosier and Jay Mewes show up.  And what they deliver could best be described as falling somewhere between a vapid Oscar speech and three drunk guys hanging on too long at the end of the party, well past the point when they were amusing.  They basically play a game of ""See how many Askewniverse members you can point out that the audience has never heard of.""  At one point near the end, Smith realizes that they're not doing much more than reading out the closing credits, and wisely says to the audience, ""You could do this yourselves.""  And he's right.  The only shining moment on the track is when Mewes excuses himself to go the washroom, and the second he's out the door, Smith and Mosier good-naturedly rag on him.  When Mewes returns, they reassure him that they said nothing but niceties while he was gone.  That's about the only highlight I can come up with.
Also featured on disc one are a couple plugs promoting other entries in the Dimension Collector's Series.
Disc two is heavy on the extras, most of which are amusing.  The rest point only serve to point out the fact that there was a lot of good -- and a lot of puerile -- footage left on the cutting room floor.
The deleted scenes, titled ""The Secret Stash"" in homage to the comic books store that Smith repeatedly plugs on all his DVDs, function just like the deleted scenes on the ""Dogma"" DVD: they're useless and pointless.  Showing them now only proves why they weren't in the film in the first place.  Most deadly are the unfunny Judd Nelson ad-libs, and Ben Affleck's non-sensically riffing on a scene funny enough on the page.  However, a lot of hilarious Will Ferrell moments are featured (including a delicious improv scene where he and Jon Stewart throw sexually suggestive puns back and forth) proving that in an alternate universe, this would have been his movie.
The treasures here are the intros that Smith and friends do, specifically, Jay Mewes' sweetly innocent comments.  My two favourites: at one point, after Smith discusses the problems he had with G.L.A.A.D. before the movie came out, Jay says, with mock retribution, that he's ""not going to send his cheque in this month"" to them.  Later, Smith self-debates whether Gus Van Sant's name rhymes with 'ant' or 'font', prompting Jay to comment, ""Yeah, like do you say tomatoe or potatoe"".  You've gotta love this stoned-out guy!
There's also an eight-minute long gag reel, which is of the pretty standard, ""I can't stop laughing"" variety (notable for, once again, Will Ferrell's hilarious straying from the script; this time he's teamed with Jason Lee, who can't keep a straight face).  And you get not one but two behind-the-scenes featurettes.  It's an exercise in redundancy, if you ask me.  The first, produced by Comedy Central, is a rather tame affair.  The second, produced specially for this disc, is not.  It features the no-holds-barred language that is Smith's bread and butter.
Two features highlight the work of Morris Day and the Time.  The first features Smith and Mewes learning the band's relatively simple dance steps, before they are called on stage to end the film.  Be warned: the sight of Kevin Smith attempting to dance may scare young children.  The second feature is an exhaustive textual history of the band.  If you ever have to write a paper on The Time, your research efforts will stop here.
Finally, in the disc's graphical section, you get an on-set photo gallery, what seems like a hundred different possibilities for the film's poster, and comic versions of Jay and Bob.  The storyboards section is a dubious inclusion, Smith not being noted for his visual flair.  But it does show how wild the Scooby-Doo parody would have been if Smith had had his druthers.
Although I laughed lovingly at the movie, despite its lack of desire to raise itself above the sophomoric, I was slightly disappointed by this DVD.  It's a bloated effort, hardly up to the standard Smith and Co. have set by their other issues.  Still, for the Smith completist (and who else would see ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" but a Smith completist), the disc is a necessary addition to your collection.",1028678400,2,4651,4.797992471769135
1328002,1,B00003CY67,"On the positive, I am glad I rented this title before even considering wasting money on buying this stupid movie!! Although, money used in renting it could have been put to better use..oh well.
What turned me off the most, besides the the plot (or lack there of), was the constant, consistant uses of the 'F' word, which was litterally used every other word.
I am not sure why I even bothered, except that I did like ""Dogma"".
Jay and his sidekick, Silent Bob, discover that their likeness is being used in a Hollywood movie (which, in itself is stupid. One must assume Hollywood was either desperate to even want to make a film about those two, or, Hollywood simply makes anything and everything into a movie...or both), and venture out to Hollywood to make sure they get their share of the money (as if there'd be any...GET REAL!)
It had it's moments...very few, but there were memerable moments. Both Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher (most remembered for the Star Wars trilogy) had breif cameo apperances; but, alas, not even the former Jedi Knight could have used the Force to save this movie.
If this review even reaches just one soul, then it was worth writing. Please! Spend your hard-earned money on something more worth-while!!",1028505600,8,1233,4.73953488372093
1328003,5,B00003CY67,This is Kevin Smith's best work. I loved every minute and all the special features. Work of art. It rocks no matter what anyone says ! Kevin Smith ROCKS !,1027987200,,154,4.166666666666667
1328004,4,B00003CY67,"First and most importantly, you have to be very well prepared to watch ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" if you want to have any hope of enjoying it to its full potential (assume, for the sake of argument, that this is both possible and desirable).  Not only do you need to watch all of writer-director Kevin Smith's earlier films (to wit, ""Clerks,"" ""Mallrats,"" ""Chasing Amy"" and ""Dogma""), but you also need to have seen ""American Pie,"" watched enough ""Dawson's Creek"" to know why Dawson should drown Pacey in the creek, and at least recognize every film Ben Affleck and Matt Damon have made in the past decade (know the title and a one line synopsis of what the film is about).
You need to do this for two reasons.  First, it is the only way you can get all of the in-jokes in this film, which is heavily self-referential vis-a-vis the Smith oeuvre.  In fact, you are better off using one hand to tick off the names of all the people from Smith's earlier films who are NOT in this movie (Stan ""the Man"" Lee immediately springs to mind).  Second, you will need all this knowledge to be able to explain to the person next to you why Ben Affleck sometimes is playing himself, sometimes is playing somebody else (Holden McNeill from ""Chasing Amy""), and sometimes is playing himself playing somebody else (Chuckie from ""Good Will Hunting II: Hunting Season"").
""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" is another one of those films where two guys go off to Hollywood to stop tinsel town from ruining their good reputations with a film.  Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith) have always played small but pivotal roles in Smith's films (e.g., the ""Chasing Amy"" speech in ""Chasing Amy""), but this time they not only get to be ABOVE the title of the film, they get to be IN the title of the film.  Now, I will readily admit that I have always been one of those who could take Jay and Silent Bob in small doses, which probably explains why my favorite bits in this film usually involve other characters.  However, I will admit enjoying Jay's attempt to find a nonderogatory term for women.
I have the feeling that this film is the swan song for Jay and Silent Bob.  I mean, now that they have achieved titular glory, how can they go back to being the two man Greek chorus of Smith's prolonged ""New Jersey Trilogy.""  Besides, with the appearance of virtually everyone who every appeared in a View Askew production (always good to see Joey Lauren Adams whether she is playing Alyssa Jones or not), you get the feeling the entire film is setting up a ""Revenge of the Jedi"" curtain call.  Maybe Kevin Smith is turning a giant corner and about to start a new chapter in his life.  Hey, it could happen.  But I really get the feeling we have seen the last of Banky, Brody and the rest of the boys.  Besides, Silent Bob speaks TWICE in this one, surely one of the signs that the end of days is nigh.
Like most View Askew productions, ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" is rated R for nonstop crude and sexual humor, pervasive strong language, and drug content (Actually, I did not know that the MPAA could use a word like ""nonstop"" in its description of a film, but certainly the term applies to everything on their little list here).  So just remember to go back over Smith's earlier films before you screen this one and save yourself a lot of headaches and avoid watching it with anyone who is going to demand you justify your enjoyment every other expletive out of Jay's mouth.",1027468800,20,3462,4.49203821656051

I've seen Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma, which were all great especially when Jay and Silent Bob are on screen. Now, they star in their own movie and is the final and the BEST of Kevin Smith's Jersey ""trilogy"" series.
Jay and Silent Bob are headed to Hollywood to trash a movie, based on a comic book ""Bluntman and Chronic"", which is based on them, after knowing their not getting any profit. On the way they meet all kinds of characters and there are LOADS of movie stars in this flick. The best and a very good farewell bid to Jay and Silent Bob by Kevin Smith.

Jay & Silent Bob is described as one big inside joke; it's an accurate description. If you've never seen Clerks (what's wrong with you?!), Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma, there's a good chance you won't understand the backstory well enough to laugh.

The movie attempts to be mainstream while still being a part of the 'underground' culture that Smith's movies tend to take, and I think the combination is a poor one. A must to own for any Smith fan.

What was Smith out to do with this film? He wanted to see how many pot-smoking idiots(with all due respect to those who smoke pot) would shell out hard cash to see a movie in which every bad aspect of every other bad comedy was included. Is there anything good about this movie? Not much. Silent Bob(Smith) is the only character who is in the least bit interesting (besides the HOT female characters). The cameos have potential, but miss the mark. The rude humor isn't the least bit humerous, and the protagonist (Jay) is too stupid to exist. If you're looking for a humerous satire on Hollywood, this isn't it. If you want to see Kevin Smith's genius, see Dogma, Chasing Amy, Mallrats, or Clerks.

Following Dogma, which was pure genius, and geniunely, consistently FUNNY; I can't understand what went wrong with this film.  All the premises were right on; I don't think the actors were all ""on"" however.  It must have just looked a lot better on paper, than it came out on film.
I didn't have any problem with the vulgarity; except maybe it was a tad excessive, and gratuitous..I just didn't laugh through this whole movie.  I kept waiting for it get funny, and it just didn't.

  For those unfamiliar with other films in the series, Jay and Silent Bob are two stoner friends from New Jersey, who hang outside a convience store dealing dugs. There origin will be explained at the begining of the movie.
  The plot of, ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'', is a bad one, so the film mainly relys on laughs which it delivers a lot of.  After finding out that internet geeks are ripping a movie based on a comic book whos characters, Bluntman and Chronic, are based on Jay and Silent Bob, the duo travels to Hollywood to stop production of the movie.
  On the way they meet 4 jewel theives, 3 who trie to kill the duo, and one (Shannon Elizabeth) who falls in love with Jay.
  The movie is a full of acting talent but a lot of that talent is wasted by putting stars in cameo roles, which isn't neccesarily a bad thing.
  Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith, Shannon Elizabeth, Wll Ferrel, and a loveable little Orangatang are the most important characters.
  Like  Smith and Mewes do in Smith's other films, Jason Lee, Ben Afleck, Jeff Andersen, and Brian O'halloran, reprise there roles from characters of Smith's other films.
  In the cameo department this movie is loaded, With cameo appearances by, Chris Rock, Matt Dammon, George Carlin, Jason Biggs, Sean William Scott, James Van Der Bergh, Tracy Morgan, Diedrich Baker, Carrie Fischer, Mark Hammil, and many more.

Also, most of the actors from the other KS movies are back (Chris Rock, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Jason Lee, the guy who playes Dante...even Brenda, I mean Shannon -- watch Mall Rats or the cut scenes from this one).

Kevin Smith, the director and the face behind Silent Bob, is a genius although his talent is better displayed in his 4th film DOGMA. In this movie, which is the fifth and last in his New Jersey Series all of which featured the two stoners Jay and Silent Bob. In other movie they were as little as small parts with 5 lines to co-stars but this one is starring the two. This movie has great jokes which make fun of the movie itself, which is great and he also pokes fu and continues stories from his other four movies using old characters and jokes to ""spice it up"". It also takes alot of humor from the classic series Star Wars which is obviousy, if you've seen Smith's other flicks, a Star Wars geek.
So all in all this movie is great and anyone who's not a huge anti-tobacco and alchohol freak should see this but I suggest thay you see his other four movies (Clerks, Chasing Amy, Mallrats, DOGMA, and maybe his 6 episode animates series, Clerks: the Animated Series).",1023753600,,1024,4.423280423280423

If you want to sit down and have 90 minutes of pure View Askew fun, go ahead, this movie is for you.  But if you want to watch a thoughtful movie that exhibits the genious of Kevin Smith, don't waste your time.  Go rent Chasing Amy or Clerks.

1328200,2,B00003CY67,"Kevin Smith is a talented writer and director.  It is a pity that he besmirched himself with this scatological trash.  Smith has included vignettes with Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith himself) in most of his films to add comic relief.  These characters became his trademark and they developed a cult following.  Smith was inundated with requests to expand the characters and feature them in a film.  Unfortunately, he capitulated, and this fatuous film is the result.
This film is targeted at boys 14 to 19 years old, most of whom were precluded from seeing it because of its R rating.  As a result, the box office was disappointing.  Most of the film is jejune, with occasional glimpses of Smith's comedic genius peeking out from the imbecilic slapstick humor and the tsunami of profane language and crude sex jokes.
Smith has given us insightful comedies such as ""Chasing Amy"" and ""Dogma"" that are both thoughtful and funny.  In this film, he is a good sport and pokes fun at himself and the actors, particularly Ben Affleck who berates himself constantly.  The movie parodies sprinkled throughout the film are innovative and humorous, taking pot shots and his films and other blockbusters such as ""Star Wars"", ""Scream"", ""ET"", and ""Batman"".  However, whatever comedic value these skits had was negated by the completely pointless script and the vulgar and boorish behavior of Jason Mewes, who spewed profanity literally every other word.
From an acting perspective this ensemble cast is nothing more than a Kevin Smith reunion party, with most of the actors having worked with him before.  Cameos abound.  As for the main characters, Kevin Smith is always excellent as Silent Bob.  He is a master of facial expressions and physical comedy.  Jason Mewes is not really an actor.  He has little on his resume other than playing Jay for Kevin Smith.  All that can really be said of him is that he has an incredible ability to behave like a foul-mouth teenager, despite the fact that he is approaching 30.
This film is a temptation that Kevin Smith should have resisted.  It is puerile and disjointed with little redeeming value other than the movie parodies.  I rated it a 3/10.  It will have appeal to certain pubescent boys, but to anyone else it is likely to be a vile and offensive experience.",1021420800,3,2310,4.846938775510204

J&SB is for the fans.  If you haven't seen it, you won't get many of the references or understand who the many characters are.

All of his movies are worth seeing anyway, but knowing them all makes the final segment of ""Strike Back"" hilarious. Cameos by Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill make this a must have as well.

Not only was this movie the funniest of all 5 of Smith's films, it was one of the funniest I have seen in a very long time. I'll be the first one to admit that (especially compared to its predecessors) the plot and main storyline are pretty thin, but it doesn't take long to realize that that is kinda the point. Its pretty obvious that after the first 4 films in the ""trilogy"", Smith finally had the freedom to do whatever he wanted when making this movie, and takes full advantage of it. Jason Mewes is at his best as the ""in your face"" Jay and his comments are made that much funnier when you are looking at Silent Bob's facial expressions & body language whenever Jay goes on one of his rants. I was a bit disappointed that Dante & Randall had such small parts, but at the same time, I can't imagine this movie being any funnier. And any movie with even a brief appearance by George Carlin is worth watching. George is the king of comedy, and his short part is one of the most hilarious parts of this movie.
One thing needs to be understood by people interested in this film (and really all of Smith's films).  Kevin Smith makes his movies for the movie fan, because that is what he is.  If you aren't the type of person who can watch the same flick over and over again, recite your favorite quotes, remember actors & actresses; there is a lot in this film (and other Smith films) that will go right over your head.  As one reviewer put it, Smith writes his dialogue in a way that lets us movie buffs feel like we are ""in the know"", and this is usually alienating for the viewer who could care less about any of that stuff.  So if you are wondering why the customer reviews for this movie tend to be extreme (a lot of 5 & 1 star ratings), there is your answer.",1020729600,9,1898,4.1775956284153

1328208,5,B00003CY67,"I've been a Kevin Smith fan from way back, which is kind of unusual since I'm not really a fan of dick and fart jokes. For me, the main attraction is his movies' dialogue, his sparkling rapier wit. For example, Smith's debut, Clerks (which sometimes feels like a 24 hour Andy Warhol film written by David Mamet and shot on a surveillance video camera), is not only an exercise in a great script overcoming everything else (uneven acting, static cinematography), but is also an example of dialogue overcoming plot (or lack thereof) within said screenplay. Really, the only movie where characters talk more and do less is My Dinner With Andre. His dick and fart jokes (of which his films aren't really as replete or dependent upon as he implies) are always the most excruciating moments for me. And those moments are far more frequent and noticeable in Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back. The scene with the soda cup and the fart-activated alarm particularly made me cringe in this flick.
All of Kevin Smith's other films (Mallrats, Dogma, Chasing Amy) have succeeded to varying degrees over their respective drawbacks for the same reason -- interesting characters spouting memorable lines. Now Smith presents his entry in the Dude, Where's My Car? genre. How will this film appeal to those who are also tempted by Bubble Boy and Rat Race is hard for me to say, as I'm not really in touch with that demographic. The real audience is the hard-core View Askew-ers who've taken to quoting those memorable lines ad nauseaum and figuring out how all these interesting characters are related throughout the previous movies. Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back is Kevin Smith's valentine to his fans. Smith says that this is going to be his last film in the Askewniverse, but Smith says a lot of things. His fans are still waiting for the promised Fletch Won, Superman Lives, and Clerks 2.
So as one of Kevin's hard-core followers and his intended demographic, how well did the movie work on me? While I may not go in for the dick and fart joke, I am a sucker for the inside joke, the kind of wink-wink that makes me feel smart and in the know. At least three times in Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back do all the characters turn to the camera to indicate that the punchline is ""this movie you're watching right now"". These inside jokes are an odd combination of sly, smart wit for those who are paying attention surrounded by cheap, dumb laughs for the masses. Anytime Will Ferrell or Dietrich Bader was on screen, I hung my head in shame. It felt a little like The Simpsons, only I watch The Simpsons at home I don't have to listen to the large laughs when Homer falls down, which helps.
Actually, what it really reminded me of is one of the early Muppet movies (anything done after Jim Henson's death just plain sucks). As many characters as possible are trotted out on-screen regardless of how necessary they are to the ""plot"" (such as it is), with all the other roles filled with an A-to-Z list of celebrity cameos. In fact, what little plot there is, is almost taken directly from the best two movies -- the road trip to Hollywood from The Muppet Movie, and the diamond heist from The Great Muppet Caper.
Of course, the movie also has a monkey, which is usually not a good sign (anyone rented Dunston Checks In lately?) But Tango turns in a rich, understated performance as Suzanne the orangutan, by simply not really being in that much of the film.
Overall, I really enjoyed the flick. Whether or not you will to depends on how you felt (or if you've even seen) the rest of the Smith oeuvre. Or maybe it doesn't. You'll just enjoy it on a whole different level for completely different reasons. The real question is where will Kevin go from here? Apparently phasing his old characters out slowly (as it looked like he was trying to do in Chasing Amy) won't work for him. Apparently, he's decided to make a clean break. Sometimes the riskiest move produces the most ambitious work.",1020384000,,3960,4.594632768361582

That said, the first time through I was nearly falling in the floor laughing at this movie.  It is incredibly profane and I will admit that the constant gay jokes got to be irritating, but there is way more good stuff than bad.

In honesty it is stupid and the plot is weak.  Who cares? That's not the point of this movie.
The point of this movie is that it';s hilarious in dialogue. The problems Jay and Silent Bob hit are as comical as in any other movie, and the many cameos and flashbacks that happen throughout the movie, as well as the references to the past films, are priceless.
Ben Affleck's dual roles made me almost die laughing, especially when he cameos himself... after already having appeared as Holden (from Chasing Amy) and making pot-shots at his own casting in movies!
Don't go in expecting a good plot or a coherent story.

Then if you are going to watch this, be in the right frame of mind to laugh your head off.  The plot of Jay and Silent Bob taking a road trip to California to stop the movie version of Bluntman & Chronic from being made is somewhat secondary to all the hijinx.  Jay and Silent Bob run into a gang of female jewel thieves, Scooby Doo and his cronies, and George Carlin teaching them about ""the rules of the road.""  They end up kidnapping a gorilla, and somehow make it to Hollywood to stop the movie.  The fun really starts when they run into Miramax studios and an entertaining satire of the entertainment industry ensues.  We get to see Good Will Hunting 2 being filmed by Gus van Sant who is just counting his money (not to spoil this scene, but having Ben Affleck and Matt Damon playing overly affected versions of themselves is just hilarious).  The cameos in this movie are a large part of the fun, particularly when Jay and Silent Bob meet the ""actors"" who will be playing them in the Bluntman and Chronic movie (Jason Biggs and James van der Beek).  Plus the DVD is loaded down with extras that any Kevin Smith fan will go ""ape"" over.  I found the things that made me chuckle on the first viewing made me laugh hilariously on the second viewing.

No kidding, the ""f"" word is used at least 20 times in the first 7 minutes of this movie and it never lets up. I can handle an occasional curse word here and there in a movie, but Jay & Silent Bob seems to be purposely trying to set some kind of record for most obscene words used in a movie, and I believe they have succeeded.

1328260,3,B00003CY67,"I've seen Jay and Silent Bob in other movies like Dogma. They are consistent with their characters through several movies their characters are portrayed in and they now finally have a movie about themselves. It starts with how they become the stoner and quiet type they are today and moves to an adventure to quash those who would trash a movie that someone based upon their characters. So basically, its a movie within a movie.
The movie is filled with crude humor and I expected it, thats why I made a point to see it. I love this type of humor with ""F"" this and ""F"" that often associated with the teen generation. Hey, I'm still a kid at heart, what can I say? So, if you like this type of humor, you'll appreciate ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.""
I will say this though, the plot has much to be desired. It's a clever spoof but if it weren't for the constant humor, I'd have been bored out of my mind. I think they could have done a better job by writing a different plot for the story.
If you have never seen Jay and Silent Bob in other movies nor know what they are about, you might not appreciate the movie because it is filled with insider jokes that previous patrons are aware of, such as why Ben Afflek is so involved in various ways. You'd serve yourself wise to view Dogma first to understand many aspects of this movie. For instance, those who've not previously viewed Dogma or other movies with this duo, would not know what the cow is all about that keeps surfacing.
These are reasons for my average ""3"" star rating. The acting is fun and predictable and that's why I enjoyed it. It would get a higher rating if it were funny to all who viewed it. I just don't find that to be the case. Oh well, I still had fun with it and will watch it again when I want good mindless entertainment!",1019001600,,1800,4.266081871345029

It was really fun.",1018483200,,233,3.68
1328266,4,B00003CY67,"I am a Kevin Smith fan and have enjoyed the first four movies in the Jay and Silent Bob series.  I am also a frequent surfer of his ViewAskew website and read for months prior to its release about the fun that everybody had in making ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" and that this was going to be the best in the bunch.
When the movie came out, I was one of the first in line to see it.  I have to admit that I was extremely disappointed and came out with the opinion that Jay and Silent Bob were best suited as support players and not lead characters.  I just felt that Jay was at his best when he chimed in here and there with a foul-mouthed smart-aleck comment instead of having to sustain it for 100 minutes.
But I am a completest and since I have all of the other Kevin Smith movies on DVD, I had to make this purchase for no other reason to get the outtakes and to hear the director's commentary track.  Unlike most other commentary tracks where the director treats his movie like it is ""Citizen Kane"", ViewAskew commentaries are hilarious as the participants rag on each other, criticize Hollywood executives and some of the actors and aren't afraid to admit that a particular scene stunk.
After a couple of different relooks at the movie, I have to say I like it and would rank it as the second best of the five (I unabashedly state that ""Mallrats"" is my favorite - although I'm probably the only one in the world who would say that).  It is a well shot movie, with great music and great performances by Shannon Elizabeth (she actually can act), Judd Nelson, Will Ferrell and most of all by Jason Mewes as Jay.  Cameos by Jason Lee, Ben Affleck, George Carlin (he's not washed up after all), Mark Hamill, Matt Damon and Deidrich Bader (from Drew Carey's show) were all enjoyable.
My only criticism is that Chris Rock's cameo as an angry African-American movie director came off to me as extremely hateful and is a real turnoff.  I don't know the point that Kevin Smith was trying to make with that character, but he failed miserably, both at the theater and on DVD.
This was a nice wrapup to the Jay and Silent Bob story.  I look forward to seeing what Kevin Smith can do with other characters in future projects.",1018396800,4,2221,4.3607748184019375

Jay and Silent Bob find out that there is a movie being made about them which will ruin their ""good names"" so they decide to go to Holywood and stop the movie from getting made. This is the basic plot but nothing will ever mean anything to you if you haven't seen the previous movies and I think you must see all of them. Some people think Kevin Smith movies are all about stupid sex jokes but I strongly disagree. They include some of the smartest dialogue ever heard on movies,and some of the best pop culture criticism. Anyway,if you know about Smith,you don't need my opinion. So I won't tell more..

1328271,5,B00003CY67,"""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" is a hilarious movie by itself.  Some of the jokes are inside, and it would probably help to see the other Kevin Smith directed films.  But I hadn't seen any of the other movies except ""Dogma"" before seeing this, and the movie still made sense to me.  However, I did go back and see ""Clerks"".  The movie itself, I'd probably only give 4 stars.  Jason Mewes, ""Jay"", is very charismatic and funny, and in this movie he has most of the dialogue.  Whenever the other characters are on the screen by themselves the movie isn't as funny.  I also am not a very big fan of parody bits, and there is a lot of parody.  But if you like that, you'll be very happy with bits from ""Star Wars"", ""The Fugitive"", ""Charlie's Angels"", and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""  I really did enjoy Jay's ""Planet of the Apes"" bit.  The film is also loaded with celebrity cameos.  More than any other movie you will ever see.  Chris Rock, as always, is hilarious as he yells at white people for 10 minutes.  Many of the cameos are people from the previous films Kevin Smith has directed.
  One of the reasons this movie is so entertaining is because of the editing.  Many of the scenes that weren't as entertaining and that dragged on were deleted from the final cut.  Which makes the movie move along at a real nice pace. All the deleted scenes can be seen on the DVD as extras.
  The DVD extras are what make me push my review to 5 stars.  This is one of those DVDs where you will want to see every single extra and listen to all the commentary during the movie.  There are nearly 50 deleted scenes, and each one is given a short introduction and explanation by Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes.  You definetly want to see why this movie was rated NC-17 intially.  All the extras are why 2 discs are needed.  I'm not going to list all the extras, I'm sure you can find that somewhere else.  Just believe me, it is definitly something you want to own yourself.",1018051200,2,1963,4.341597796143251
1328272,2,B00003CY67,"Unlike Kevin Smith's previous film, the religiously and deliciously satirical ""Dogma,"" his latest venture, ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,"" turns out to be nothing more than one of the most incredibly mind-numbing, drool-inducing movies to come along since... well, since... hmm, guess this one hits an all-time low. A non-stop vomitorium of ""one note jokes that only stoners laugh at,"" this is, without a doubt, one of cinema's worst movies, if not its most idiotic (and yes, I'm aware that ""Scary Movie 2"" is still out there).
I came into the movie expecting nothing less than a ridiculous concept and hammy acting, and that's exactly what I got, but with less comedic genius than ""There's Something About Mary,"" and less appealing gross outs than the ""American Pie"" franchise. The story (if you can consider it as such) focuses on potheads Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (director Kevin Smith), two bumbling idiots who wander around aimlessly in search of a better movie. They discover that a comic book for which they were the inspiration is being made into a movie, and they set out for Hollywood to score some ""proverbial phat cash.""
Along the way, they encounter various offbeat characters, too offbeat, if you ask me. Unlike some of Smith's previous material, ""Jay and Silent Bob"" is strictly for Smith followers, and even devout worshippers may find much of the material completely lacking. Smith bows down to the lowest of all gross-outs and toilet humor, injecting every two seconds of the film with constant mutterings of...
...Nearly every gag in the film has a gay context, from Jay's ongoing quips about Silent Bob's sexual orientation, to their masquerading as a homosexual couple to evade police in search of a stolen orangutan. Saturday Night Live alumnus Will Ferrell has perhaps the only funny line in the film in that particular scene, but that's about the extent of the movie's comedic potential.
In the midst of the profanities and homosexual putdowns, we are given two of the most incredibly banal characters in recent movie history. To borrow a phrase from the film, ""Jay and Silent Bob are stupid characters-- a couple of stoners who spout [off] catch phrases like a third-rate Cheech and Chong, or Bill and Ted."" 'Nuff said.
There is some quiet potential at rest here. As they hitch-hike their way to Hollywood to stop production on the Bluntman and Chronic movie, which is being produced by Miramax, the film pokes several satirical and limber jabs at its own production company, parodying everything from the ""Scream"" trilogy to ""Good Will Hunting."" Many of Kevin Smith's regulars make cameo appearances, while actors like Jason Biggs and James van der Beek poke fun at their characters from ""American Pie"" and ""Dawson's Creek.""
I must say, to see the potential in these later scenes give way to the ill-fated conundrum of filth and disgust makes for a real downer of a second half. Not that the first half is any better by any rate. Maybe I'm being too critical of the film's weaknesses, and should just go along with the joke. But the joke is not funny. The movie is not funny. Unlike much of Kevin Smith's films, ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" is the true love-it-or-hate-it film of his career. To borrow another well-worded phrase from the film, ""Jay and Silent Bob only work in small doses, if at all.""",1017964800,2,3341,4.863157894736842
1328273,5,B00003CY67,"If you have ever witnessed the View Askew group as their own, you'd realize the tremendous fun they have on every movie... Jay and Silent Bob strike back is a fine example.
Basic plot involves two phenomenal characters: motor mouth Jay and silent...silent Bob. Throughout five view askew films, they have made history with their comedic bantering. This movie is homage to all other films as continuous references are made to them (namely Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Good Will Hunting, and even a little bit of Dogma). So if you haven't seen any of those movies, certain dialogues may seem odd or out of context.
Many old characters are returning, and some are introduced. This is what this movie is essentially about:  a huge reunion of famous stars gathering together to honour two normally very discreet characters.
Vulgarity, controversial humour, sex and drug jokes; this is what view askew is about. Should anyone look for intelligence in this film, it would be the strategic build-ups to comedic satire, the crafty delivery of actors poking fun at themselves, and the visually stunning changes of scenery (""I hate how Hollywood is so fake"").
Moments of humility, self-realization, and laugh-out-in-your-face punch lines; this is View Askew in one movie.",1017964800,,1262,5.12621359223301
1328274,5,B00003CY67,"This is one of the funniest movies that came out in 2001 in the theatres.  Kevin Smith made this movie not for the general audience but for THE FANS!!  The references and inside jokes from Kevin Smith's other movies (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma) make up a lot of this movie.  If you have not seen these movies you will not get some of the jokes.  You don'tneed to see the other movies to enjoy the movie but it is highly reccommended.  If you are planning on buying this DVD I highly recommend picking up, at least, Clerks and Chasing Amy as well as these two get quite a few references in the movie.

Ever since Bill and Ted's Execellent Adventure, every movie studio has tried time and time again to come up with their own version of Bill and Ted and everytime they have failed.  I don't think Kevin Smith was trying to come up with the best comedic duo since Bill and Ted but Jay and Silent Bob are a comedic pair like no other.  The best since Bill and Ted!!  In my mind even better since there is intelligence hidden in the deepest and darkest of toilet humor.

1328275,5,B00003CY67,"In summation, the movie is a 90-minute long in-joke, being that if you haven't seen Smith's four previous movies, this one might not make a whole lot of sense.  Jay and Bob get booted away from their stomping grounds at the quickstop, Clerks, and are informed by their old pal Brody, Mallrats, that the rights to the comic book based on them written by Banky Edwards and Holden McNeil, Chasing Amy, has been sold and is being made into a big hollywood movie starring those miramax lynchpins Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, Dogma.  Our heroes decide that to set things right, they must travel out to L.A. and stop the movie from getting made.  How's that for a plot!
Once again, Kevin Smith has crafted a hilarious, well written fun film.  And once again, it seems that he has caught a large amount of flack for doing so.  Critics dismissed it.  Mainstream viewers largely ignored it.  Gay and lesbian groups protested it.  Granted, the characters curse way too much, but is it too much to ask for people to sit back and just laugh and have a good time anymore?
Smith, of course is no stranger to problems of this sort.  All of his films so far have ticked off one group or another, talons bared, if for no good reason than to pick on the odd man out, a filmmaker whos virtues lie outside the "" must see t.v. "" crowd.
I don't think that Michael Bay has this problem.
Jay and Job is no Pearl Harbor, thank goodness, but visualy speaking, Smith has grown in spades, although I never had a problem with his visual style in the first place.  The 2:35:1 aspect ratio , other rwise known as ""scope"" , is used here as it was in Dogma is used to perfect effect, with the frame being filled to the full extent of what is required for any given scene.
This movie is just a big carton.  Ever seen one of those?  After the problems with his last movie, I think Smith need to take a break in a lighter direction for this one.  If you know Smith's love of dvd, you know what to expect in terms of extras.  The commentay's not as good this time around, but there's plenty else to find..., music videos, trailers and internet spots and of course deleted scenes, two of which are worth the price of the disc alone.  If you don't like Smith and his slackers, go buy something that won an oscar.  If, however, you do like him, do yourself a favor and buy this movie.

However, as far as swan songs go, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is an utterly perfect accomplishment, a geeks love letter to his two favorite characters.
As can be imagined, the film is stupid, an endless string of crude humor and fart jokes.  Too bad it is so FUNNY!  I love every moment of this film, from Jay's opening rap outside the Quick-Stop (which me and my 15 year-old brother had to watch over and over again until we had it memorized because itt kept getting stuck in our heads) to the victorious dance at the end with Morris Day and the Time.  Along the way, absolutely nothing is sacred, and this film achieves a beautiful balance of high-brow satire of the film industry (and itself) and low-brow humor.
Jason Mewes is a surprising standout in this film.  It's great to go back and watch the entire Jersey Trilogy to see how much he has grown as an actor, from charismatic scenery to a lovable side-story to a full-fledged leading man.  He really carries this film in an utterly charming way.  Every fibre of your bieng screams out, ""I SHOULDN'T BE LAUGHING AT THIS!"" but his performance is so winning, and Smith's directing so sincere, that you really just have to give yourself over to it.
This DVD is a great set as well, as usual.  Kevin Smith is an ubergeek, and he knows that he has fans out there who are just like him, and as a result his DVDs are packed with more worthlessly entertaining bits than any normal viewer could possibly have time for (I of course watch them all).  This one is no exception, with over an hour of deleted scenes (check out Scooby's ""lipstick!""), behind the scenes tomfoolery, and pointless gags.
There is no pretense in this film, no glossy Hollywood cool, just a bunch of friends who somehow made it big making a movie because they can.  This film is an hysterical, honest, sincere and loving tribute to all things ridiculous, geeky, and crude.

1328278,2,B00003CY67,"oh christ.  what happened here?  before i review this movie i should start off by saying i am by far the biggest kevin smith/ jason mewes fan there has ever been.  i own all the movies, and have spent literaly hundreds of dollars on merchandise, so don't dismiss my review.
well what do we have here... a bad movie, a bad script, and absoloutly wonderful actors.  i don't even know where to start on this one.  script-  this script could never be funny.  jay doesn't say a single sentance without using the F word AT LEAST 8 times.  it's just NOT FUNNY.  clerks had the same deal, but it was so original and halarious that i can't even describe it.
the script here is just kind of blahze.  it's an obvious story line with none of the quarks that came with the previous movies.  it's very mediocre.  it's on the same level as all the saturday night live movies like chris katan's corkey ramano and rob shneider's animal whatever and the other one where he's a fishtank guy.  sorry i don't remember the names, but they  [stunk] too.
this movie is not inteligent, and definetly does not display that which is the incredible inteligence of kevin smith.
i'm sorry this made it to the screen, they could have done so much better.
don't ever watch this movie.  watch clerks, then dogma, then chasing amy, then mall rats.  all of those are absolute classics that i will never regret watching again and again.  this is just an attempt at funny that was rushed and was bad because they had money.  clerks was funny as hell because it was so low budget and raw.
this is what happens when something becomes main-stream.  and for christ' sake what's with the song that jay sings?  it's just a string of stupid childish obscenities.  it's not funny at all.
i'm not saying that they aren't completely briliant guys,  i'm saying this movie is just horrible.  this is what hollywood does to good people.  however, i do have faith that they will pull through for their next movie (although they've said this is their last, that's bull).

The thing I loved about Kevin Smith was that he had intelligent humor.  He was funny.  He was witty.  And the cast complemented his vision.  Even though he wrote what some people would refer to as ""trash"", he wrote it well and made me laugh.
I did not experience any moments during this movie that made me laugh out loud.  There were times I chuckled to myself, but overall this whole movie was a disappointment.  Kevin Smith is relying more on shock value, controversy accompanied by publicity to make people see his movies.  this is one person who will never see another movie he makes.  buh bye.",1017360000,6,794,4.779411764705882

 Jay and Silent Bob are here, and the movie business will never be the same. When I went into this movie, I didn't really know what to expect, because truth be told, I'm not a very big fan of Jay and Silent Bob. Having never seen any of the hard-core movies of Kevin Smith, (except for Dogma, which is one of my favorite movies of all time.) I wasn't sure what to expect. All I have to say is: I love this movie. I really love this movie This movie is also Ultra-Funny, Original, and funny again. Jason Mewes is one of the funniest people I've ever seen. His Jay is so raw and honest that he comes off being howlingly funny. Kevin Smith's Silent Bob was also tremendously funny even though he didn't really say that much, just his looks and mannerisms were hilarious. Also the whole irony thing worked well for the movie too. Also what surprised me is how the movie kept making fun of itself, also I don't know how they got Ben Affleck and Matt Damon to make fun of their previous roles, but that was hilarious. I saw all their movies so I totally got what they were talking about. Now the Plot of the film was pretty inventive, with the formula for a road trip movie put in there. The way this movie flowed was simple and didn't leave anything out, and that really worked for it. Also I honestly want to know where Kevin Smith gets his inspiration from, because all of the smart and snappy dialogue in this movie is something that I haven't seen in a long time since such great movies as ""Fight Club,"" ""Dogma,"" ""As Good as it Gets,"" and ""Good Will Hunting.""  I honestly would say that I hope that there's gonna be a sequel to this movie, because I would love to see what happens to Jay and Bob next, and who'd they meet along the way. Something tells me that that probably won't happen, but I hope it will.

That lightsaber scene almost made me fall asleep -- the sound fx was SOOO quiet and subdued compared to the music and dialog.

1328285,3,B00003CY67,"Writer/director Kevin Smith's characters Jay and Silent Bob made their first appearance in 1994's cult favorite, ""Clerks"". They stood outside a convenience store. Ostensibly, they were selling pot, but, for the most part, they just hung out waiting for something to happen. They appeared in all of Smith movies over the next five years [""Mallrats"", Chasing Amy"" and ""Dogma""]. Now comes ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"", in which the pair must carry an entire movie, rather than playing minor roles. Because they are basically one big joke, the results are uneven. The scenes that work are some the funniest moments in recent movies. The rest, which are in the minority, are pretty painful. Whatever the scene, be forewarned that these guys remain consistently perverse and offensive.
This is a road movie, and the plot is just an outline to which the various skits are attached. The movie starts off outside the very same convenience store where Jay and Silent Bob [Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith] were first seen in ""Clerks"".
They learn that a movie studio is about to make a film based on ""Bluntman and Chronic"", a comic book. Jay and Bob were the inspiration for the comic, and they are furious that they are getting neither cash nor credit from the project. They decided to go to Hollywood to stop the movie production and to get revenge. Along the way, they become the unwitting pawns of a beautiful girl gang of jewel thieves. They're easy targets since both Jay and Silent Bob are complete morons.
Whether or not you find the movie funny depends on a couple of things. One is an appreciation of Hollywood in-jokes.  Rarely has a movie been so full of them. The title itself is a reference to ""The Empire Strikes Back"". The original Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamil, have cameo appearances. So do lots of other actors, like Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Smith executive produced the movie that made them famous, ""Good Will Hunting"". The girl gang is a parody of ""Charlie's Angels"". The movie references are so numerous that there are references to references. For some viewers, all this insider stuff will become exasperating. Others will love it, as they try to recognize as many as possible. I found it all to be fun yet completely self-indulgent, since, ultimately, it's all about how hip and knowledgeable Smith and his buddies are.
The other thing required to enjoy this movie is a fondness for crude humor, or, perhaps in this case, a love of it. There is enough bathroom humor and profanity in the first twenty minutes to last some people a lifetime. I read that a certain four-letter word is used here 228 times, a figure I've no reason to doubt. Graphic sexual references abound, due mainly to Jay's complete obsession with the subject. Since many people are already familiar with Smith's characters, they won't be seeing or hearing anything unexpected. It's other people who need to be warned. This movie goes way beyond merely risqu.
It is only fair to point out that several groups have protested Jay's totally homophobia behavior. I doubt these attempts to censure Smith are necessary. He's a satirist. No group, be it women, blacks, Catholics, teenagers, old people or gays, escape his twisted humor. Even the stars playing themselves, such as Damon and Affleck, come off as ditzy fools. Smith himself laughs the criticism off, noting that everyone knows Jay and Silent Bob are idiots. At least we hope they do. On the other hand, aren't there always a few idiots in an audience?",1016582400,5,3524,4.824793388429752

The Jay and Silent Bob scenes have always been my fav in any Kevin Smith movie, and they finally got a movie all their own.  It was great to see all the big name cameos (James Van der Beek and Jason Biggs were hilarious!), and the ""Scooby"" scene was my favourite!
Now, let's be honest.  You can't expect a full-length Jay and Silent Bob movie to be a biting political satire.  If you've seen the other Smith flicks, you know what J&SB are all about.  If you were willing to accept that, the movie, while not particularly insightful or intelligent, was roll-on-the-floor funny.
I recommend this movie if you know and love Jay and Silent Bob.  If you don't, watch something else.",1016323200,,835,4.383116883116883
1328294,2,B00003CY67,"In 1994, Kevin Smith broke onto the independent movie scene with his truly excellent low budget film CLERKS. The film succeeded primarily because it was comprised almost entirely of talk. Awesome talk. Moreover, it is one of those rare films that gets better on each reviewing. He followed this up with the fairly dreadful MALLRATS, which was marred partly by a lack of story, partly by expanding the roles of Jay and Silent Bob, and partly by injecting way too much humor having to do with one bodily function or another. CHASING AMY, on the other hand, was incredible, and it looked like Smith was completely back on track. But note, in CLERKS and CHASING AMY, Jay and Silent Bob had very, very small roles. DOGMA elevated both characters to new levels. I don't think it was an accident that DOGMA and MALLRATS were the weakest of his first four films. The basic problem is that neither Jason Mewes nor Smith are good actors, and both are utterly dreadful physical comedians. Since Smith inexplicably injects a fair amount of physical comedy into his films, this is not a good thing.
I was extremely dubious about JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK from the moment I first heard about it. Having come to the conclusion that ""more Jay and Silent Bob"" = ""less of a flick,"" I was afraid that this was going to be one of his weaker efforts. Unfortunately, it was much worse than I had anticipated. I had hoped that they would perhaps move away from some of the sophomoric jokes that had marred MALLRATS and DOGMA, but I was mistaken.
What is wrong with the film? First, Mewes and Smith remain dreadful comic actors, especially when called upon to do physical comedy. If anyone doubts this, just look at the way they run on their way to the animal lab before stealing the orangutan. Second, the script was just wretched, filled with an inconceivable number of jokes about homosexuality, sex, flatulence, and dope. A little of that kind of humor goes a very, very long way. We are given piles of it. Third, the cast, which is overall rather amazing, is just wasted. It is embarrassing to see first-rate talent wasting itself. Most of the performers simply can't transcend the weakness of the material they have to work with, but others, like the dreadful Will Ferrell and the unfortunate Mark Hamill, manage to make things worse than they ought to be.
So, while I loved both CLERKS and CHASING AMY (and the animated version of CLERKS), this film pretty makes me want to give up on Kevin Smith. Will he make another good film? Possibly. Do I expect him to? No. If he does, he needs to jettison completely all the physical humor. And he needs to grow up a bit. One of the reasons that CHASING AMY was so successful (apart from the fact that it featured no physical comedy) was the fact that the issues dealt with in that film are real, adult issues. The jokes of MALLRATS, this film, and even DOGMA, or adolescent jokes. Smith is now in his thirties. He ought to focus on more age-appropriate issues.
As a last observation, I have to say that I don't understand how Smith manages to get so many name actors and actresses in his films. Money, of course, but he has so many names that I suspect that most were working for below what they normally charge. He must be a great guy with a lot of charm.
So, a severe disappointment. Maybe Smith will right his ship. From the Internet I have learned that he has a project in the works in which he does not appear as an actor. I think that is a good sign. Also, a new CLERKS animated film is in the works. I liked the previous animated version very, very much, so this could be a lot of fun. So, I am not optimistic, given DOGMA and this film, but I can only hope.",1016236800,,3695,4.4674556213017755

1328298,3,B00003CY67,"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back was filled with comedy and dialogue befitting our silently bewildered heroes. Jay had many and many a line to add to this showing and most of these were pretty entertaining. Even Silent Bob broke loose at times and this added to the entertainment as well. Still, this movie involved more than the simple exploits of two ""stoners"" standing around and the way this was handled was utterly dismal. Sadly, I believe Kevin Smith finally managed to bore me.
My main problem with the movie was its plot, a gruesomely tiresome construct that a third-grader could have written, and one guest that Smith used. To start, the plot of movie, a portion I really didn't expect that much from, failed to really manifest itself throughout most of the film. At first, it did seem like there was going to be something, like Jay and Bob were going to go and intimidate their ways into notoriety, but the movie then strayed from this topic. There were weakly strung together smatterings of a storyline from then on, and these were only provided to introduce a star-studded ensemble with nothing to really do.
The second part, my major grievance, was the use of an ape to entertain me. Using any type of ape, monkey, pig, dog, etc., in a cute manner is something I really don't expect in a movie like this, and the movie lost the majority of its appeal when this theme was introduced. Personally, I don't find being entertained by a chimp very interesting at all, and I really don't see the target audience overly enjoying things my grandmother longs for.

One annoying aspect of the film is that Kevin Smith seems obsessed with homosexual issues. It seemed every couple of minutes there was something about how this guy wants to have sex with this other guy but doesn't want to admit it.

I kept on trying to look for some redeeming joke or humor in the film, but as the credits rolled I was at a loss. There are some funny moments---Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Jason Lee goofing off.

Hope Kevin makes it up to us in Jersey Girl.",1015718400,2,971,4.282608695652174
1328304,4,B00003CY67,"I got more belly laughs out of this movie than anything since ""Tommy Boy"". The scene in which Jay throws down the gauntlet to the Internet film geeks may well be the greatest use of profanity in the history of film comedy. And Jason Mewes's performance is breathtaking in its shamelessness. Even the jokes that fall flat (i.e. everything involving Will Ferrell) fit in with the movie's agreeably ramshackle conception. The DVD bonus material is above-average but, as is usually the case with these things, unlikely to be watched more than once. I found it most interesting for Smith's introduction of his wife and daughter. It's as if, after making a feature-length film whose central theme is his terror of being homosexual, he had to say, ""Look! See? I'm all man!""
That said, I can't give it five stars because ultimately it's a feature-length film whose central theme is the director's terror of being homosexual. It's not that I would force Smith to conform to the standards of political correctness. (As long as you're willing to give someone equal rights under the law, I don't particularly care whether you like them or not.) But gay-panic this severe not only isn't funny, it's kind of depressing.",1015632000,,1205,4.882926829268293
1328305,5,B00003CY67,"Both the film and it's DVD were made for the hardcore view askew crowd. The ones that follow all the dramatics surrounding Kevin Smith. The ones that know all the interconnections between his Jay and Bob films. The film itself is twice as funny if you've seen his previous films. The DVD was made even more for the fan club... All the intros are filmed at Kevin Smith's comic book store in Red Bank. He brings in family and friends. Throughout, he touches on issues like the Catholic League (protested Dogma) and GLAAD (protested this one... until he paid a four zero donation) We, having followed both and many other such examples on sites like newsaskew.com know exactly what he's talking about.
And personally, I feel that's just great. Smith and crew would be nowhere without their devoted fanbase. Smith reconizes this and plays, although his outreach to fans is what built it up so large to begin with. The special features range from the mundane (trailers) to the obscure (a detailed guide to Moris Day and the Time) to the View Askew staples (commentary and deleted scenes)
View Askew has always made great deleted scenes sections. Here we get 40 of 'em.
The film itself is presented in wonderful anamorphic widescreen at the theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1. This film is Smith's most visually complex and cohesive effort yet (perhaps due to having such an experienced D.P.?), so this is important. The audio track is also Smith's most complex effort yet... The 5.1 Dolby Digital track is surprisingly active, compared to the dialog driven tracks found on the DVDs of his previous efforts.
Bottom Line: If you're a View Askew fan, you'll love this DVD. If you're not, this movie may make you one.",1015545600,,1706,4.786440677966102

Even with the very raunchy subject matter and the language, I still find Clerks a very funny movie. and the characters of Jay and Silent Bob are more background in it.
I'm sorry I have to compare this to Clerks, but it just doesn't even hold any sort of candle to Smith's first and best effort.
Watching this movie, I could only think that Smith had decided to totally make fun of the two characters and make cartoons out of them.  I'm not really sure what Kevin Smith was trying to prove by creating this piece of very unfunny and annoyingly bad film.
All the cameos in the world(from the stars of all his past efforts) couldn't make this movie any better.  I thought that the tremendous amount of swearing that Jason Mewes' character, Jay, spews out was just more than I could take.  He should be trying out for a part on the Sopranos' next.  The language was bad, the script was atrocious and unfunny.  I was very disappointed with this movie, and totally do not recommend it.  Watch Clerks instead.

It was essentially made for devotees of writer/actor/director Kevin Smith's other films (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma), and if you haven't seen those films quite a few times, many of the jokes in this movie won't register.
I've always thought that Kevin Smith gets a bit too much credit for his films. While I admit that Clerks is a classic, Mallrats and Dogma were both disasters (in their own ways) while Chasing Amy couldn't decide what it wanted to be. JSBSB is a return to his Clerks' roots in some respects. While the first 25 minutes are hilarious, the movie really gets spotty with the addition of the annoying and pointless jewel thiefs played by Shannon Elizabeth, Eliza Dushku, Ali Larter and Kevin Smith's wife (can't remember her name.) The movie would have worked MUCH better if he had just kept it as a series of random encounters with other characters. The movie does pick up the pace a bit near the end, but there were quite a few times where the movie got tedious for me.

1328315,4,B00003CY67,"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is another fantastic addition to the Jersey Trilogy (although there are five in the series) from writer/director Kevin Smith.  It is also one of the best.
As the film begins we find Jay and Silent Bob in front of the convenient store peddling dope to kids(as in Clerks).  Shortly after that they discover from Brody (Jason Lee from Mallrats) that there is a movie being made from the comic book, Bluntman and Chronic, based on their likeness.  Jay and Bob go to see Holden (Ben Affleck from Chasing Amy), the co-creator of the comic book, only to discover he has sold out to Banky (Jason Lee from Chasing Amy).  After scanning the net to see the pre-buzz on the film Jay and Bob are upset with the criticism and decide to go to Hollywood to stop the film.  This is when the film really gets going.  Along the way they encounter a perverted hitchhiker, a nun, a gang of Charlie's Angelesque animal rights activists, a wildlife marshal, an orangutan, police, racist directors, sell-out actors, and a Jedi Knight.
Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is hilarious.  It is loaded with some of the foulest, low-blow, obscene humor ever written, which is great.  Smith has managed to tie together so many elements of his past films.  Many of the characters in the movie were seen previously in Clerks, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy.  The film is also loaded with celebrity cameos, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck doing Good Will Hunting 2, and Mark Hamill as the villain were two of the best.  Jon Stewart as the newscaster was also great.  Will Ferrell as the wildlife marshall steals every scene.
Smith has said that this will be the last film featuring Jay and Silent Bob.  I hope that is not true, but if it is this was the right way to send them out.  I recommend seeing Clerks, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy before seeing this film simply because there are some jokes that a person who has not seen these films will be left out on.  Additionally, as with all Kevin Smith films, the DVD is loaded and a must have for any fan of the series.  This movie really is a trip, finally I understand Suzanne.",1015027200,,2110,4.5131578947368425

I was embarrassed to be in the room with teenage girls watching this, because it didn't deliver enough laughs or have a clever enough premise to cover the foul language.

I think the voting on this is the ""emperor's new clothes"" syndrome. It just isn't cool to be contrary to the new hip talent...

It is also a lame attempt at counter-culture quasi-intellectualism. Who the heck cares if these people are really intelligent or not? The movie isn't entertaining and that's what these artists are suppose to be doing, not qualifying me for mensa.",1014940800,7,686,4.614754098360656
1328318,2,B00003CY67,"The intent at a Hollywood satire was admirable, but this film isn't nearly as funny or deep as it wants to be.  Not to say it has no enjoyable moments, but this film tries to do too many things at the same time and ends up falling flat half the time.
On the plus side:  Shannon Elizabeth makes some unusual choices and ended up successfully salvaging a character which on paper was completely unworkable.  Justice's ""attraction"" to Jay has no credibility thanks to an underdeveloped script, but Elizabeth's endearing geekiness, complete with large glasses and offbeat reactions, at least makes the character interesting to watch. Eliza Dushku, a confident pro at comedy, is of course infallible, gamely attacking dialogue that's often awkward and overwritten, and even Ali Larter and Jennifer Schwalbach (the real-life Mrs. Kevin Smith) are watchable in tiny roles.  Smith himself fares well as Silent Bob, Suzanne the orangutan makes for a nice sparring partner for Silent Bob, and many of the real-person cameos (Ben Affleck, Jason Biggs, Wes Craven, Jules Asner) hit home.
The down sides are many.  Jason Mewes, for once, looks utterly embarrassed and uncomfortable in a Smith movie.  Perhaps it's the burden of being the leading man and not being up for the task.  Smith himself, unfortunately, said it best:  Too much of Jay and Silent Bob is tiresome indeed.  Will Ferrell is 100% unfunny, further worsened by how funny he thinks he is.  Do we *really* need those monkey expressions when Willenholly is firing his gun?
The dialogue is some of Smith's worst, filled with profanity for little reason, except without the pizazz of Clerks.  The fact is, most actors have trouble with Smith's very writerly dialogue, dressed up to the max with four-letter words and extra-long sentences, attempting a level of syntactical complexity that's verbally unfeasible.  And a parody of The Fugitive eight years after the fact?  Please.
All this aside, it is really the failure of the central relationship that makes this movie seem fake and contrived.  We're never really given a reason why Justice likes Jay so much she'd give up everything for him, and vice versa.  Hell, even Silent Bob's connection to ""Suzanne"" is better examined.  Once again, it's an example of how Smith is great at little moments but always falters when he aims too high, either emotionally or thematically.  The best moments in this movie are small details:  Jay and Silent Bob uncomfortably trying to settle in front of a gas station; Jay and Bob running into a fake background; Justice getting picked on by the ""Charlie's Angels"" crew; Dushku's hilarious come-on to a pizza-delivery man; a flashback to Jay and Bob when they were babies; and of course, a sorely missed revisitation of the slack but utterly hilarious interactions between Dante and Randall, carried over from Clerks.
The much-debated gay jokes in this movie have two sides to them.  On one hand, Smith doesn't exclude himself from the jokes -- his own character Silent Bob is in fact often the butt-end of these jokes.  At the same time, since the jokes don't really add up to any kind of statement, it is simply impossible to claim the gay jokes as a satire of homophobia.  So at the end of the day, they are what they are -- jokes at the expense of homosexuals.  And not so funny, either, because of how self-conscious they sound.
As for the satire on Hollywood?  Most of what happens after Jay and Bob arrive on the Miramax lot is quite good.  But why did it take us so long in getting there?  And though the mad dash through various movie sets is generally funny, Smith's pop-culture references become incredibly tiring at this point.
I hope Kevin Smith would stop making movies about ""big issues"" and concentrate on what he does best:  Lowbrow, absurdist comedy about the common people, people he knows well inside and out.  After eight years, Clerks remains his best film.",1014940800,2,3915,4.874622356495468

He's not. Without a framework to hang the jokes on, he has to invent plot contrivances rather than letting the story unfold, and only about a third of the movie really succeeds.

1328326,5,B00003CY67,"A few years back, an unknown writer/director by the name of Kevin Smith financed his first film by selling his collection of Comic Books and maxing out all of his credit cards. The film was ""Clerks"" and it became the surprise hit of 1994 and took critical acclaim at the Sundance Film Festival.
Clerks told the story of a day in the life of a group of people in a small New Jersey town and introduced film audiences to Jay and Silent Bob. Jay (Jason Mewes), and Silent Bob(Kevin Smith), are two stoners who spend their days outside a convenience store dealing drugs, chasing women and dispensing wisdom. Their many motivators outside of drugs, woman, and money are the Star Wars films, heavy metal and comic books. The two characters became very popular with audiences and appeared in the other Kevin Smith films such as ""Mallrats"", ""Chasing Amy"", and ""Dogma"" often stealing the scenes they were in from the rest of the cast.
Their is a saying that for all things there is a season and having just turned 30, Smith decided that it was time to move to other challenges in Hollywood and leave Jay and Silent Bob behind. Smith did however want to give the boys a grand sendoff and rounded up many of the cast members from his previous films for his latest effort, ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"".
The film opens with Jay and Bob doing what they do best, hanging out in front of a store selling pot to the local kids. Jay does the talking as he sees himself as the brains behind the pair, and Bob only speaks on rare instances, and when he does, it is often something very profound that speaks of a wisdom that is well hidden by his lifestyle.
Jay and Bob go to visit their good friend Brodie (Jason Lee) who has retired from his talk show that he gained at the end of ""Mallrats"" to return home and run a comic store. It is here that Jay and Silent Bob learn that there is to be a movie made based on their alter egos Bluntman and Chronic. Thinking that they have a big payday coming to them, the boys head off to see Holden (Ben Affleck) who did a comic based on the two for many years, as Holden is the one who they believe is behind the film deal.
The boys dreams of riches are given a jolt when they learn that Holden sold the rights to his former partner, Banky (Jason Lee) and that if they want money they need to check with him. It is at this point that the two dolts first learn of the internet. Holden shows them how the film is expected to do well, but that there are those on the internet who think Jay and Silent Bob are stupid characters and are highly critical of them in online postings. Desperate to save their good names and thus avoid losing any action from the ladies, Jay and Silent Bob set off to Hollywood to stop the making of the film as shooting begins in just three days.
It is at this point that the movie becomes a road movie as many celebrity cameos pop up ranging from Carrie Fisher, to George Carlin. Before long, the boys are in the company of four lovely ladies who are heading to Denver to free test animals, Jay becomes smitten with one of the ladies, a stunner named Justice (Shannon Elizabeth). All is not as it seems as the girls are not what they seem and Jay and Silent Bob are soon on the run from the authorities and a crazed Wildlife Marshall (Will Ferrell).
The film is very bawdy as no bodily function is left untouched but the brutal honesty of the language is part of the films charm as this is how Jay and Silent Bob are, and they are themselves no matter what the circumstances. The supporting cast seems to be having a great time and the film and actors even poke fun at themselves and their past work. While not destined to win any awards for acting, directing, or story, ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" sticks to the formula that made Clerks so much fun, recognizable characters, funny jokes and situations, and a light hearted attitude where nothing is taken to seriously and no subject is taboo.
Smith brilliantly included many of his characters from his past films in this movie as it brought the New Jersey series as it is often called to a good closure. We see that many of the characters no matter how small from past films are going on with their lives and while things may have changed for them, the people and friends from their past still hold a special place in their hearts. Life goes on, but those special people who were a part of ones life, still remain, even if they are no longer with you, they remain in your heart and thoughts. This is much like the casts of Smith's films as while they may be gone after this film, it is unlikely that the viewers will forget them anytime soon. Smith says this is the last outing for Jay and Silent Bob, but the door may be left slightly open for a return of the two loveable losers someday.

1328327,5,B00003CY67,"Kevin Smith delved deeply into his own psyche and produced a love letter to American pop culture.  With more references to music, movies, comics and TV than a Tarantino script, JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK so neatly ties the bow on the package of Smith's first 5 films that both MALLRATS and DOGMA were improved, in my estimation.
Follow clueless Jay and his hapless hetero life partner across the USA on their trek to--
Never mind.  The plot's not really important.
What *is* important is that you get Smith, Smith and more Smith--the best of what he's shown us in the past with very few of the self-indulgent excesses that marred his earlier films.  Smith even takes himself to task for having the audacity to think that this is even a good idea for a movie.  If you liked MALLRATS and DOGMA, you should *love* this one.
I gave this movie 4 stars, but the DVD package gets 5.  The second disc includes almost 3 hours of material, including 90 minutes of deleted scenes hosted by Smith, Jason ""Jay"" Mewes, Producer Scott Mosier, and Actress Jennifer Schwalbach Smith (who happens to be Smith's wife).  Material here was cut for reasons of length, pacing, or ratings--very little of the deleted stuff is just plain not up to the quality of the feature film.
The included gag reel, entitled ""Why movies cost so much,"" gives us bloopers and miscues and would be worth the one-star increase all by itself.  Add to it some marvelous improvisation between Jon Stewart and the all-too-funny Will Ferrell, a reel of Judd Nelson ad libs, another of Ferrell ad libs, a ""making of"" short, a couple of pieces about Morris Day and the Time, well...this is the disc that keeps on giving.  A Special Edition that is truly special.
If you don't like Jay and Silent Bob, you probably won't like this film, but if you have more than a passing interest in Kevin Smith's films, you should own this disc.",1014768000,2,1886,4.608955223880597
1328329,4,B00003CY67,"The fifth part in the Jersey trilogy by Kevin Smith puts Jay and Silent Bob forward as the two main characters, and you love this or not. The intellectual approach of Dogma has been abandoned, and instead you get an unlimited dose of Jay (Jason Mewes) ranting, with Silent Bob (Kevin Smith) as his sidekick. References to the four previous Kevin Smith movies abound, and most of the characters walk on screen at one time or another, which makes for a cartoonish impression.
The DVD gives you this, with quite an extensive second helping in the form of a second DVD with all the deleted scenes, a gag reel, an immediately visible ""Secret Stash"" (mostly devoted to the band Time) and lots more (almost 3 hours in all). I particularly liked the episode from Comedy Central's Reel Comedy about Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, which gives you the movie in concentrated form.

The Jay and Silent Bob movie ended up being just a bit over the top with its crude humor.  Don't get me wrong, sometimes crude jokes can be a lot of fun.  ""American Pie"" is a good example of good ""clean,"" raunchy fun.  However, Jay and Silent Bob's movie comes off more ....than a Wal-Mart clearance sale!
This movie did have some good points (I especially liked the Scooby-Doo parody), but overall it just didn't live up to my high expectations.  Even a star-studded cast couldn't save this one.  Better luck next time, Mr. Smith.",1014681600,,746,4.656488549618321
1328331,5,B00003CY67,"Versatility. That is the only word that can do the immense talent that is Kevin Smith justice. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, the fifth and final installment in his cult-favorite-and-now mainstream series the ""New Jersey Trilogy"", is a wonderful romp packed with laughs and excitement all the way through its hour and 40 minutes running time.
One might expect this movie to be a crude and rude equivalent to all the trash that Hollywood seems to just pull out...And for a second, this movie manages to pass itself off as one of those throwaway films. But what makes this movie so appealing is that it refuses to take itself seriously for one moment. Even the requisite ""sentimental, sappy romantic"" scene is jabbed at and recklessly parodied. American Pie, for example, fell short as soon as it started taking itself seriously and moved from a genuinely funny comedy to a teen movie filled with unnecessary melodrama and overacting that seems to just break up a promising pace. That's one of the admirable feats this movie does: there isn't a single moment that you're not laughing or at least waiting for another joke (crude as it may be) to turn up. In my honest opinion, this is what a pure comedy film is about.
Jason Mewes is perhaps the biggest presence in this film. I always knew he was funny, but in this movie he was transposed to a god-like status! There were times when he was saying something serious that I still couldn't help but chuckle because of who he is (the only other actor with this power is Jack Black). His mouth is so foul and his intentions are so dirty and hapless that the audience can't help but love this guy for who he is and represents and cheer him on. His motor-mouth capabilities, when played off of Smith's Silent Bob generates such surprising chemistry that it must be watched in order to be understood.
Another interesting and enjoyable aspect of this film is that the cameos (which are numerous but never overwhelming) never seem forced; the actors never fall out of character, and their appearance will either have you slapping your forehead and grinning like an idiot, or laughing out loud at the length they are willing to go to spoof others or themselves. Jason Biggs and James Van Der Beek are surprisingly charismatic in their appearance because they're playing roles in this movie that relentlessly contrast and parody their status in real life of teen heartthrobs. Another memorable duo (one of my favorite scenes) is the short but subtley hilarious scene in which Ben Affleck and Matt Damon (playing themselves, no less) mock each other and poke fun at their choice of starring in bad movies such as Reindeer Games (Matt Damon at one point calls Affleck, ""Bounce-boy"").
While watching this movie, you never really feel like you're being forced to sit through a movie or having to put up with lame jokes. Like one reviewer on this site said, this movie manages to make all sorts of jokes without ever offending anyone (mainly because Smith strives to be over-the-top with his jokes, so much that you can't help but laugh instead of feeling offended). Instead, this movie feels like one big party where everyone is having a good time, never taking anything seriously. Granted, this movie won't be garnering Academy Awards any time soon, but then again this wasn't the original intention in the first place now was it? This movie may not succeed in touching one's heart or displaying genuine pathos (check out Chasing Amy for that) but it does succeed in what it was meant to do: make someone laugh. Go buy this movie now!",1014681600,,3569,4.739549839228296
1328332,3,B00003CY67,"I'm a big fan of Kevin Smith, and loved Clerks, Chasing Amy and Dogma, but this film was a real disapointment.  The realization that I came to was that I like Jay alot more than Silent Bob.  We see entirely too much of Kevin Smith, who while a good writer/director is a terible actor.  A redeeming fector of the DVD is the bonus material which is (I think) even longer than the movie.  I think Jay provides a good comic foil as the more serious introspective characters that inhabit Kevin Smith's films, but there might not be enough there to warrent an entire movie.  And again, Kevin Smith is just plain annoying to watch both in the movie and introducing cut scenes on the bonus material-disk.  In summary, rent it if you are a Smith fan, but it doesn't warrent a buy.",1014681600,3,771,4.394366197183099
1328333,3,B00003CY67,"Let me start off by saying I love each and everyone of Kevin Smith's (Dogma, Chasing Amy, Clerks, Clerks Animated & Mallrats) movies. But this one come right out of left field. It didn't have the usual Kevin Smith humor, as well as many other things. The movie changes the way you look at Jay and Silent Bob. Jay act's like he has more sense (no good), the usual characters aren't in it but maybe 2-3 minutes each. The language got more vulgar & not as sophisticated as the others. You notice in CLERKS, they might use a lot of profanity, but they have a large vocabulary. In this one it's like Kevin Smith had a brain ... the entire time he wrote it. I thought the ending of all of Smith's characters would be triumphant, but instead it's mind numbing.
The group of jewel theives (which has Ali Larter & Shannon Elizabeth) are annoying. They shouldn't have even been added to the movie script. George Carlin's scenes is funny, but for Chris Rock's scene, IT ...! All the scenes with Jay and Silent Bob seem to be off. The fact they had the characters in the movie, made no nevermind to me, considering they only used them for a few seconds. (Jason Biggs & James Van Der Beek's cameos absolutely were horrible too, as well as Jason Lee's scenes).
If you want a good movie check out one of Smith's earlier works, but as for this one, its a dud.

1328334,5,B00003CY67,"I would rank this comedy as one of the best to hit the screen.  It ranks up their with Month Python's Holy Grail and Mel Brooks Young Frankenstien.  I start laughing out loud just remembering scenes of the movie.  The movie never slows down and has a constant bombardment of laughs.
WARNING:  This movie is rated R for a reason.  The character Jay always uses strong language and by no means is this a movie for kids to watch.  But hey who would let their kid watch an R rated movie anyway.  If you don't like strong language in your humor then this movie is probably not for you.  But the brains behind the laughs cannot be denied.  This is movie you have to watch.

I really appreciate the level of quality and time he puts in to every DVD release, such as video introductions for each of the 50 (Yes, FIFTY!) deleted scenes, plus outtakes and whatnot.  It also has music videos, the comedy central Jay & Silent Bob special, and of course a great commentary track.  Plus there's a lot I'm forgetting.

The film explores the subjects of the internet and the film industly, but the extras are also very good.  The deleated scenes are actually funny, as is the commentaty about them.
I don't know how Kevin Smith does it, but I liked EVERYONE in the cast, even people who I usually hate (Jason Biggs and James Van Der Beek, to name a few).  Well, basicaly, talk about going out with style.  The only problem is the apperance of non-stop gay jokes, that would kind of negate ""Chasing Amy,"" were it not for a brief doilogue between Biggs and Van Der Beek about homophobia.",1014508800,,700,4.576

1328348,5,B00003CY67,This movie this one of the best of all time.  Kevin Smith is the best writer.  I  have all his movies that are in the New Jersey trilogy.  I am buying this movie the day it comes out and I will buy every other movie kevin smith puts out. His next movie is Jersey Girl.  There are no Jay and Silent Bob but it will be okay.  All of these movies are worth buying if you have a good sense of humor.,1014508800,,395,3.7560975609756095
1328349,1,B00003CY67,"""Mallrats"" is better than this.  ""Mallrats"" had characters, at least.  ""Jay And Slient Bob"" doesn't have characters; it's a stream of profanity and hit-n-miss jokes with a bunch of cameos from previous Smith movie characters and acting alumni.  You start wishing that the cameo players would stick around and that Jay and Silent Bob would disappear. I am glad to hear that Smith is closing the book on this world of characters.""Die-hard fans"" (I guess I'm not one of them) should love the two-disc set.  It's loaded with deleted scenes, a couple music videos, etc.  There's a funny bit where Morris Day is teaching Smith to dance.  I haven't gotten through all the extras yet, but a film of this quality doesn't deserve this kind of treatment. As a matter of fact, ""Phantoms"" does.",1014422400,6,781,4.791044776119403
1328350,5,B00003CY67,"If you are not a fan of previous works of writer directer Kevin P. Smith(Clerks, Mallrat,Chasing Amy,Dogma) this DVD is not for you. You would have two see all of his previous films to truley understand it. It is the most expensive CULT film ever made. If you are J&SBSB is a must buy. The DVD is loaded with so much extras it needed two discs to fit them all in. The deleted scenes came in at over 95 minutes to view, and were individually introduced by Kevin Smith, Jasan (Fat Buds) Mewes, and others. ViewAskew DVD's are not known for having thin extras, and this one is no different. Disc one features the the full lengnth feature in wide screen, a sneak peek menu of past ViewAskew productions, audio commentary by Kevin Smith producer Scott Mosier, and star Jason Mewes. While the comentry was not as funny as those in the past(No Ben Affleck) it was informative none the less.
  Disc 2 is the bonus disc wich containes deleated scenes, gag reel, out takes, music videos, 2 featuretes, trailers, tv spots, cast, and crew bios, and movie stills. It kept me busy for hours, and has replay value. While J&SBSB is not Smith's smartest film it is his best looking. The ""Dick, and fart jokes"" will keep you coming back again, and again. Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!...It is worth the price, and more.
  So if you like crisp diolouge, witty joke, and dirty speech this is the DVD for you. Clearly Kevin Smith's best.",1014163200,2,1410,4.474708171206226

The movie is just for fun and laugh's and laugh I did throughout,story is strait foward enough the duo set off for Hollywood to stop the movie being made on their comic Bluntman & Chronic and along the way wind-up in hilarious adventures and by the conclusion life imitate's life.
Thank's Kevin and Jason for a fun ride with terriffic star-turn cameo's Carrie Fisher's Nun being downed on by Jay in the car,Shannen Elizabeth and her lethal man-hating girl-gang,the Organuatang,Ben Affleck,Matt Damon, the great Chris Rock as the film-director with a major chip on his shoulder's,James Van der Beek/Jason Biggs as Bluntman & Chronic/themselves,Shannen Doherty on the set of yet another Scream and of course the excellent Cocknocker(Mark Hamill)duel with Jay.

1328356,5,B00003CY67,"At the risk of sounding like a fanboy, there wasn't a single film in 2001 that made me laugh more than ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back."" Director Kevin Smith (""Clerks,"" ""Dogma"") retires his two recurring goofball heroes in a film that pokes fun at Hollywood, stardom, films in general and Smith's films in particular. With an ensemble cast including Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Shannon Elizabeth, Chris Rock, Ali Larter, Eliza Dushku, Mark Hamill, Jason Lee, Will Ferrell,  Judd Nelson, Wes Craven, Gus Van Sant, James Van Der Beek and Jason Biggs, Smith has assembled people who, like himself, don't mind looking silly. While it does often rely on gross-out humor and certainly will appeal more to fans of Smith's other films, it also has a surprising intelligence to it that many comedies these days lack.
To be certain, this film will appeal most to those who are familiar with Smith's previous films, but even total neophytes to the Askewniverse will find things to laugh at, because Smith doesn't stop with his own work. The parodies in this film run from ""Star Wars,"" ""The Fugitive,"" ""American Pie,"" ""Planet of the Apes,"" ""Scream"" and others that are just too numerous to count.
