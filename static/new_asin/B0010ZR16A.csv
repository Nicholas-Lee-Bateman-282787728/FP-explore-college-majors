8239658,1,B0010ZR16A,This video expired before I could watch it. Maybe one day I will rent it again looks like it may ok.,1396742400,,100,3.8095238095238093
8239659,4,B0010ZR16A,Not bad at all. With UFC being the dominant MMA Force that is always my standard. But of course they disappointingly don't incorporate Female MMA Fighters. This was pretty good and enjoyable to watch!,1309478400,3,200,4.911764705882353
8239660,4,B0010ZR16A,Just wanted to mention that one of the fighters in this movie is a roller derby girl as well.  Props to her for being able to do both.,1294790400,3,134,3.7857142857142856
8239661,5,B0010ZR16A,"Wome's MMA is non-stop fast pace action fighting. You just sit back and keep eye on every seconds of fight, so enjoy all fights.  Also I will recommend Hook N Fight Revolution series.",1281830400,2,183,4.545454545454546
8239662,4,B0010ZR16A,"I'm the first to review this.  I feel very privileged  but I'll keep this short.  It had some pretty decent action.  This is not the best female mixed martial arts I've seen but it wasn't bad.  One chick ends up getting her arm broken/ dislocated because her opponent didn't give her any chance to tap.  I thinks that's highly unsportsmanlike.  She could have very well ruined that girl's career doing a submission that her opponent wasn't about to escape anyway.  I don't care for people like that.  By all means, do what it takes to win but that was not necessary.

PS:  UFC needs a female division :)

Also, I wanted to give this a 3.5 but I decided to round up.  Just being generous.",1259280000,5,687,4.4
