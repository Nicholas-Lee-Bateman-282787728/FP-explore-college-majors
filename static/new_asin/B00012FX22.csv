1968209,5,B00012FX22,"I was surprised to find this at such a low price and was afraid perhaps it was a defective copy. It wasn't! This title can be very difficult to find in the stores, but was readily available at Amazon. Kudos to the purchasing staff! You made my 5 year old REALLY happy for Easter. Thanks Amazon!",1305331200,,294,4.267857142857143
1968210,5,B00012FX22,"MY 4-YR OLD NEPHEW IS INTO THOMAS THE TRAIN BIG-TIME, AND I BROUGHT HIM THIS DVD DURING A RECENT VISIT. I'VE BOUGHT HIM NEARLY EVERY THOMAS DVD, BUT ""THE BEST OF GORDON"" IS HIS FAVORITE AND WE WATCHED IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. ALL OF THE THOMAS DVD'S ARE GREAT FOR KIDS. THEY ARE SHORT, BUT TELL A GOOD STORY WITH A ""USEFUL"" LESSON. IF YOU ARE A THOMAS FAN, YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THE MEANING BEHIND WHAT I JUST WROTE! LOL!",1187827200,,427,4.156626506024097
1968211,4,B00012FX22,"Okay Gordon isn't one of the main characters so there weren't very much stories to put on this tape, I mean some of them aren't even about Gordon they just have Gordon in them. But then again, this tape did bring back some of my favorite stories like Gordon and the Famous Visitor and Gordon Takes a Dip therefore, I gave this one 4 stars.",1096329600,,339,4.230769230769231
1968212,4,B00012FX22,The point with my title is that some of these episodes don't excalty have Gordon as the main character. I thought Gordon and the Gremlin stunk and they should've held off on this one until more Gordon episodes were released. Some of these episodes were good but I really didn't think the episodes were that good. I wish they'd make a best of Toby or a best of Henry but I guess i'd probably be saying the same thing. Gordon's a good character but nowaday's he says i'm a big blue engine who knows everything. These new tapes should be more like the old ones when the engines weren't so self conceited. I should've given this one 3 stars but I like Gordon a lot to do that.,1076716800,3,672,4.2578125

1968216,2,B00012FX22,I feel 2.99 is a bit much for this rental. The eyes and mouths on the trains move but that's about it. Not very entertaining.,1391385600,,125,4.04

1968221,4,B00012FX22,"These best of series are a good compilation of the best shows (like the title implies).  My only gripe is that they tend to cutout the music in-between episodes, which happen to be one of my son's favorite parts!",1372204800,,212,4.435897435897436

8005638,2,B00012FX22,"For 3$ rental, and 45 mins this seemed to be a big miss to me. My nephew and I watched it, and this is just a compilation of *old* clips of Gordon randomly picked from *old videos*.

If anything, this was done sloppy as it is just a bunch of clips put together with minimal editing and effort to make a quick buck out of you.",1492387200,,325,3.9242424242424243

8005641,5,B00012FX22,"Gordon is my son's favorite engine. Unfortunately there aren't too many dvd's or books dedicated to him specifically so I had to pick this up as soon as I saw it was available.

The best of Gordon, is everything you have come to love with one of the favorite characters in the beloved Thomas the Tank Engine series.
