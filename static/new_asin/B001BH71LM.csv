A man packs a bedroll on his horse. An Indian paddles his canoe to shore. Two men plan to hold-up the stage coach. Al Davis is the new Sheriff. A man called the ""Shadow"" operates a gang of robbers and rustlers. A man jumps out of a tree to take their money. Two robbers shoot the drive and guard, the horses run away with the passenger! But they are stopped. In town a hidden man shoots the Sheriff! There is a volunteer. He follows two men into a saloon. They go to an inside room for orders from a hidden man. The money from the stage coach is found and returned to town by Yak. The two men report the results to that hidden man, they are told to go to their hideout. These men are watched by the Sheriff and his Indian friend.

One man tells how his cattle were stolen. Can they get help from the government? They've tried without success. [A comment on economic conditions?] The new Sheriff Travers tells Matlock what he found. Should she sell out? A man receives a telephone call about the departure of the Sheriff from the Matlock ranch. [How many knew this?] The Sheriff departs. [Recognize this ranch from the other movies?] Two men arrange an ambush but are stopped by Jack's lasso. [Long shots suggest a body double.] The one that rode away is caught, there is a fight. Travers wins. The two men are jailed. The Sheriff inspects that room and finds a tunnel! Where does it lead to? The young woman sees a face at her window, she screams then fires her pistol. Who was hurt? She will stay on the ranch and fight it out. The Sheriff takes one prisoner out of the jail to receive a message. Is there a reason to change clothes?

That hiding place is uncovered, the man taken out. Will her talk? Not is some action occurs! Sheriff Travers runs to that saloon. We see how he escapes. Travers tells how he was sent from Washington as a US Marshal; he will swear in the other ranchers as deputies to go after the crooks. The cook tells Miss Anita about the imposter. ""Its that fool girl."" [Was that a double?] A mirror flashes a warning, they're coming. That very large gang follows the wagon. There is shooting. [You know the end is near.] The horses separate from the wagon, which goes over a cliff into the lake. One man paddles a canoe on a river to get away. A few years later we see what the future holds.

This has a complex plot that works. Were there any implausibilities in it? Overall, its better than the average dramas in this series. Notice how the female star never repeats, unlike the male actors? George Hayes was from Buffalo NY. Was this plot similar to the movie serials of that day? Was the combination of Sheriff and Indian similar to the ""Lone Ranger""?",1511481600,,2706,4.363095238095238
