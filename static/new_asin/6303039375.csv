How about my credentials. I've been a film noir fan for several years now, as well as having an obsession with the 1920s, '30s and '40s. I'm by no means a historian or a film expert, but I am a member of the movie's (modern) audience.

So...""Lying Lips."" Is it interesting to watch? Yes. Is there a positive history connected to the movie? Yes. Can a person watch it just for enjoyment? Depending on their interests and sense of humor, sure. Is it, in and of itself, a good movie? No. Sorry, but no. Not unless you're looking for MST3K material.

""Lying Lips"" is known for being a rare example of a movie with African American heroes, made by an African American man. With the vast majority of minority portrayals in media from that era being written by white people, and often being overly stereotypical, it's very interesting to see a movie about the African American community from the perspective of someone who actually lived in it. And ""Lying Lips"" seems to portray a very objective view of  the Black community in the 1930s, warts and all. Actually, race has little to do with the story, and that may have been Oscar Micheaux's intention; to show that the African American population included heroes, villains, innocent damsels, wicked harpies, and bumbling idiots, just like any other group.

The film is also an interesting look at the 1930s in general. There's a lot of social commentary about gender, how both men and women could take advantage of each other and ruin lives, just using the ridiculous strict social rules of the '30s. In the main plotline, male club owners try to blackmail an innocent singer into prostituting herself to help business; in another plotline, a scheaming woman manipulates a man into marrying her by pretending to have his child. And the effects of the Great Depression are ever present in the backdrop, fueling both the heroes' and villains' motivations; Elsie's fretting over John sacrificing his job to protect her would not have the same effect in a movie set in any other decade. And the corrupt club owner's desire for Elsie to prostitute herself to customers shows just how despicably desperate the Depression could make some people.  Anyone who is a fan of '30s music or fashion will also get a few treats from this movie.

Now the bad news: this movie, just as a movie, sucks. And no, it's not because of when it was made. I've seen films from as far back as 1916. Old movies could still have decent acting; old movies could still have decently written dialogue; and old movies could still have climaxes that weren't idiotic. The dialogue goes beyond the typical cheesiness you'd expect from an old movie, and is often just plain awkward. The characters vocalize thoughts that are completely unnecessary, things that most movies even from that era would have conveyed with simple looks and gestures, or maybe a believable muttering to one's self. The storyline is clumsily put together; first, our villains appear to be the evil club owners, but then halfway through the movie, the villain is suddenly an evil relative, and the club apparently has nothing to do with anything. The acting ranges from ""kind of bad"" to ""Ed Wood quality."" And the ""romantic"" scene in the jail-house rivals Annakin and Padme's discussion on sand.

Most of all, a lot of the characters are astoundingly stupid, few more than our heroine Elsie. Other reviewers note the unintentionally hilarious telephone scene (""Hello? Helloooo? HeeeeLOOO?""). But even more shocking is how long it takes for Elsie to notice that her limp, clearly-not-breathing aunt is dead. It's such a strong mixture of laughable and disturbing that you'd swear you were watching a comedy. (Maybe it's a ....no, the joke's too lame, I'm not even gonna say it.) The policeman aren't much better. ""She was your aunt? So you were related?"" And then the villain, who--while being an outlaw in the 1930s--needs to be explained what being ""taken for a ride"" means. But by far, the dumbest moment comes near the end, when the two heroes force the truth out of said villain by scaring him with a ghost story. And all of a sudden, we've gone from an attempt at film noir to Loony Tunes. Minus the laughs.

I recommend this film to someone teaching a history class, or someone who's just interested in the 1930s or African American history. And I strongly urge that you bring your sense of humor with you, because you'll need it.",1433289600,,4470,4.772315653298835

7834956,4,6303039375,I enjoyed this movie. It showed that black people can act and should have been given better parts in the movie industry. They were cheated for years. I would like to own more movie like this one.,1151798400,,195,4.297297297297297
7834957,5,6303039375,"If you are really into classic, rare, & OOP films (featuring an all black cast) this is a very good movie. Edna Mae Harris plays the role of Elsie & Robert Earl Jones (father of James Earl Jones) plays a detective. Unlike some films that are hard to follow, this one has a pretty good story line. It is filled with suspense and kept my attention throughout. Of course based on the time period & low budget of this film there are flickers (mainly in the darkened scenes), but overall the film is very enjoyable. Take it from a 21 year old!",1107993600,7,538,4.284313725490196
7834958,4,6303039375,"Pretty good for a Michaux film (in spite of their historical significance, most of them are quite awful). Basically, this is the story of how Edna Mae Harris (who would be remembered by a later generation as the female lead on Pigmeat Markham's comedy records) refusing to prostitute herself at a seedy club and being framed for murder. Decent acting and good story, although the low-budget cinematography will cause some eyestrain. BTW-one of the detectives is played by Robert Jones-father of James Earl.",1059696000,20,506,5.108433734939759

But, she was too good for that. She showed her acting, singing, and dancing skills in movies like these. Great little mystery movie by Oscar Micheaux. Its watchable.",1050364800,17,416,4.635135135135135
