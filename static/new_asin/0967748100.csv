7794060,5,0967748100,"This is a terrific video about 5 hidden treasures of Route 66. Jim and Jerry (well-known 66ers) take a fun and colorful look at five of the Mother Road's forgotten pathways. The video was shot on location and is flavored with plenty of road scenes, history, period photos. My favorite part:  the out-takes at the end of the show. hehe. It is too funny.  Besides great cinematography (by Kathy Anderson), you'll enjoy interesting Rt. 66 information that you won't find anywhere else. You'll love it.",1063324800,,498,4.847058823529411
7794061,4,0967748100,"This video allowed me to see areas of the Mother Road that I will probably never visit in person. I have several other Route 66 videos and the places covered here are on none of them. It is truly for the SERIOUS deciple. The only problem I have is with the production quality. It looks like it was taken with MY video camera. It has the ""feel"" of home movies, which may appeal to some, but to my personal preferences it does not. It could have been edited a little ""tighter"". 2-3 minutes of driving down a dirt road bouncing around in a back seat gets old very quickly. The 5 minutes of ""bloopers"" at the end could have been replaced by more feature footage. But don't let my nit-picking above stop you from buying this video. I only mention them to explain my reason for withholding the 5th star in my rating. It will take you to the earliest alignments of Route 66 and their condition as of 1998.",973641600,3,898,4.288235294117647
7794062,5,0967748100,"While there are numerous videos on the market that tell the story of old Route 66, Jim & Jerry tell us the story of old, OLD Route 66.....sections of this beloved highway that time forgot even before the  ""official"" demise of Route 66. This video solidifies their  position as the two leading authorities of Route 66 history. I watched the  video and went out to hunt some of  these places myself.  A great buy for  any serious road warrior!",948931200,,441,4.518987341772152
7794063,5,0967748100,"Old roadbed bulldogs Ross and McClanahan are at their very best in this video, sinking their scholarly chops into lost patches of  66 most modern folks never knew existed. Under the direction of expert Kathy Anderson,  Ross and McClanahan explore five sections of abandoned Mother Road--taking  the time to explain the historical significance and local color behind  each. My favorite sections: ""Road Maze at Arlington"" and the  final, triumphant charge up New Mexico's La Bajada Hill where these  intrepid researchers prove they won't let a little rocky road intimidate  them. Great in-depth stuff and a MUST for any serious Route 66 historian.",948585600,,645,5.264705882352941
7794064,5,0967748100,"Jim, Jerry, & Kathy have given us the opportunity to BE  THERE..!  What a fun time I had watching this superb piece of work..!",948240000,,126,4.208333333333333
7794065,5,0967748100,"Everyone will marvel as Ross, McClanahan and Anderson uncover for us some of the early stretches of this legendary highway. It is remarkable that they even found these remote miles but it is astonishing that early  travelers were able to navigate them at all without tumbling to their  death. Talk about cliff-hangers. We watch, holding our breath, as the trio  actually drive their SUV over these treacherous passes careening  dangerously close to their own demise. In spite of the nail-biting scenes,  they sprinkle them with humor. Ross and McClanahan provide the action and  Anderson does an excellent job of videography. It's a must-see.",948067200,,642,5.184466019417476
7794066,5,0967748100,"Mr. Ross and Mr. McClanahan share an obvious love for Route 66, enough so that they have done painstaking research to put together a video which shows us not the usual tourist stops and Mother Road ""icons"", but  instead the little-known and less-explored spurs and alignments of the  road.  They make discoveries based on small clues which remained when the  road was decommissioned in 1984.  They accept challenges, such as daring  the ascent of rugged La Bajada Hill west of Santa Fe NM, which for all  intents and purposes has been considered nearly impassible for years.  And  most of all, they have great fun as they explore and discover.  Route  66 aficionados will adore this video.  Those less familiar with the road,  which was the main thoroughfare stretching from Chicago to L.A. for nearly  75 years, will enjoy the scenery, learn from the sharing of facts, and  especially relish the camaraderie and humor of Ross and McClanahan as they  impart their wisdom to the world.
I recommend this video highly to  anyone interested in Route 66.  The resurgence of interest in the  preservation of the Mother Road has spurred the creation of many books and  videos on the subject of late.  This one is refreshingly different!",948067200,,1229,4.868932038834951
7794067,5,0967748100,"I've been up and down Route 66 a half dozen times and have a half dozen 66 videos but ""Bones"" showed me a ton of neat stuff I've never seen before.  Jim and Jerry obviously had a terrific time searching out these  parts of Route 66 and they share the fun.",948067200,,255,3.980392156862745

7794069,5,0967748100,"With humor and historically accurate information, Jim and Jerry offer a user-friendly guide to several of the less-known and forgotten alignments from the history of Route 66. They venture where few would travel to show  you sections of the road that in some cases haven't seen traffic in nearly  70 years. The enclosed map easily guides the road warrior to the exact  location of these road gems. No Route 66 experience is complete without  checking out some of the abandoned alignments presented in this video.
