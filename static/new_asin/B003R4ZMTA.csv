Since I became a fan of Master Chef, the catering business cover adds a delicious flavor to the excitement and intrigue.
My DVD recorder was not functioning properly during this time but I can view a few episodes to quiet my anxiety until I am able to buy the professional DVD's...soon I hope.",1320105600,,518,4.641304347826087
8403251,5,B003R4ZMTA,"""Undercovers"" was a very classy, intelligent, sexy show (read previous reviewer-description) and I looked forward to viewing it weekly (along with another refreshing newcomer ""The Good Guys"") and cannot understand why it was axed! Was it the time-slot (7:00 p.m. WAS a bit too early a time-slot, as many of us don't arrive home from work until this time, and I, for one, missed the first 5 to 10 minutes on occasion)...couldn't it have been moved, time-wise??

It was wonderful to watch a couple of actors who, as people, are educated, worldly, eloquent...and to know that this was real, not just acting (having watched/read biographies and interviews...and I doubt the accents were ""fakey"", considering both lead actors are multi-lingual). It reminded me, a bit, of ""The Avengers"" (Patrick McNee and Diana Rigg)  or ""Secret Agent Man"" (Patrick McGoohan) TV series of the 60's...intrigue mixed with light humor; classy and fun...not a lot of heavy artillary shoot-em-up stuff. I miss it and will be ordering a dvd of the few episodes aired, once it becomes available. Try to do the same.",1313625600,3,1087,5.033333333333333
8403252,4,B003R4ZMTA,"First, it's nice to see Gerald McRaney still getting work. Dude's been one of my favorite television actors since his SIMON & SIMON days. He brings his full-on irascibility to UNDERCOVERS, yet another attempt from NBC to bring the sexy back or something. I can't help but think of UNDERCOVERS as a bit of a CHUCK knockoff, it's core premise is that familiar. Only, instead of the Buy More electronics store, the spy cover is a posh catering business. The similarity doesn't mean it's not a watchable show. I'll tell the world it's a  watchable show. The two spectacular-looking leads make it so. And also Gerald McRaney and his brand of sour.

It's about two spies who fell in love, retired from the cloak & dagger, tied the knot, launched a catering enterprise. Steven and Samantha Bloom have endured five blissful years of marriage. But now it's time to shake off the rust, get back in the field. As the Blooms, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Boris Kodjoe eminently qualify as eye candy but there's also that added draw if you're into all stuff espionage-y. There's vast appeal in watching the Blooms as they juggle the globe-trotting and the skulking, the disguises and fakey accents, and the saving the world while coping with incessant domestic snafus that crop up. For one thing, Sam's cute younger sister - who doesn't quite have her stuff together and who works alongside Steve and Sam in the catering gig - is a continual source of aggravation.

Gerald McRaney is the Bloom's CIA case handler, Mr. Shaw. Shaw's gruff demeanor and skepticism inject much needed grounding to  what in essence is over-the-top espionage escapism. It irks Shaw no end that the Blooms' missions never go down in textbook manner. The Blooms' support network in the field consists of the nebbish Hoyt (he provides tech and intel) and the roguish Leo (who used to date Sam; this is a constant irritation for Steven because Leo keeps bringing up that he used to date Sam). It's a pretty good cast.

It's an interesting trend, these actors from other countries assuming American roles. Yvonne Strahovski (CHUCK) is Australian. Michelle Ryan (BIONIC WOMAN) is from the UK, as is Hugh Laurie (HOUSE M.D.). Gugu Mbatha-Raw is also from England, while Boris Kodjoe was born in Austria. What, is the talent so much better outside the borders? Admittedly, Gugu Mbatha-Raw's acting skills seem on par with her stunning looks.

Besides CHUCK, UNDERCOVERS also carries a whiff of UNDERCOVER BLUES and a smidge of MR. AND MRS. SMITH and TRUE LIES. The two leads bring heat and glamour and compatibility. Even though the caper-of-the-week plotting comes off pedestrian, the show is funny and carries a sense of adventure and a self-deprecating air about it. As a teaser, the Blooms have agreed a long time ago not to talk about their pasts, so of course now they're uncovering all sorts of secrets about each other. And, like all good shows, it introduces a compelling ongoing story thread to keep the audience invested. It has to do with Shaw's true reason for reactivating the Blooms. Except, of course, this arc never gets a chance to gather steam. NBC just killed the show, just broke up the Blooms. How will J.J. Abrams feed his family?",1292630400,8,3200,4.819672131147541
