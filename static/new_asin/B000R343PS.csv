8198494,5,B000R343PS,"When will this series be placed on a DVD for the USA?? I think this show is a hoot! I don't have resources to transfer it to a DVD, so the only time I can watch it is on TV. Would love to buy this series!
  An update to my original review. I ordered (02/2012) the 'All Regions DVD Player' so now I am able to watch
this great series.  I ordered all three series through Amazon. Love it!",1287792000,3,386,3.8607594936708862
8198495,5,B000R343PS,"I so love this British sitcom!  This show is designed to get you laughing and keep you in a state of hysteria till the end of the episode.  I have to record it on my DVR and then to DVD to make sure I never miss a beat.  If you are a fan of ""The Big Bang Theory"" (for the 8 of you who aren't watching, it is a sitcom on CBS) ""Dharma and Greg"" ""Grace Under Fire"" ""Roseanne"" ""Night Court"" or any of the gems that have been on television.  This show was made to crack you up.",1282262400,2,472,3.7373737373737375
