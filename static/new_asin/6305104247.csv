It would be one thing if this was supposed to be a spoof, but the more i watched it suddenly dawned on me these guys  were trying to make a serious action movie !! I will be returning this movie in the overnight return box cuz i don't want anyone to see me in possession of it. my lord !!!",1068595200,,344,3.7777777777777777
7883104,5,6305104247,"This movie is so mind numbingly bad its the best movie ever. Im sure the 4.00 it took to make this movie was well spent on a bottle of Evian and paying Chris Kelly a dime to star in it. Oh yeah, and paying the editing guy to splice in 2 people who are never seen before or after to have sex.

********SPOILER********
Then Chris Kelly's wife takes like 40 minutes to die, and hes hugging her in a purple and yellow ninja suit. So horrible its hilarious.",1065916800,,548,4.179245283018868
