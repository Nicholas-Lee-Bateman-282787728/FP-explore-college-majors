4657151,5,B005D7E7ZY,"What's not to like about Perry Mason? Are the stories believable? No, but who cares? The bad guy always gets whacked and the guilty always gets punished. My favorite is when a woman confesses to killing a man because, as she tearfully cries, 'I loved him.' You can't miss with Raymond Burr and the gang. In fact, I'm watcing 'Godzilla, King of the Monsters' with Raymond Burr as I type this.",1319846400,2,391,4.52112676056338

4657153,5,B005D7E7ZY,"P.S. Colbert, DVD Verdict --Like leather-bound rows of literary classics on a book shelf, installments of Perry Mason all tend to look the same, if only from the outside.

Sure, most episodes in Perry Mason: Season 6, Volume 1 build to a courtroom climax involving a blurted confession from the real villain, but there are exceptions, including one where ""the case"" not only never comes before the bench, but develops, unfolds, and is resolved by Perry while he's on vacation!

Certainly, long-suffering D.A. Hamilton Burger (William Talman) sets himself up yet again for the latest in a series of bruising professional defeats, but don't you think it's time we gave credit where credit is due? This guy never prosecutes a case he doesn't believe in, and he takes his lumps so gracefully that as one episode concludes, he actually smiles and says ""You know, Perry, maybe for once, I was wrong.""

The quality of these restorations continues to amaze, and though there are moments that betray bits of dirt and drop-off, they are just that: moments, and they are rare indeed.

Say what you will about Paramount's insistence on breaking these seasons into halves and not providing extras, but you can't deny that you get what you pay for.

4657154,4,B005D7E7ZY,"I've been a Perry Mason ""fan"" for over 40 years, ever since a local station was rerunning it late at night in the late 1960s/early 1970s. I've taped all 271 ep's from Ch. 17 (WTBS/Turner) Atlanta in the 1980s, from another local station in the 1980s/90s, and from Hallmark in the 1990s. I'm also currently watching it twice daily on ""Me-TV"" as well. And I've been buying the (CBS/Viacom/Paramount) ""half-season"" DVDs ever since the first half of the first season came out in 2006.

The show is one of my all-time favorites, esp. the 1st thru 7th seasons. The 8th (1964/65) and 9th/final (1965/66) seasons are still good, but in my opinion, not ""as"" good as earlier seasons. As the mid-1960s approached, two other CBS-owned shows also began to ""slip"" a bit in my opinion, Gunsmoke and Rawhide. (Have Gun Will Travel and Twilight Zone had already ceased production with 1962/63 and 1963/64, respectively).

I'm very happy that CBS/Viacom/Paramount has continued with the DVD releases, and have just started watching the 1st-half 6th-season DVDs. I have also pre-ordered the 2nd-half 6th-season DVDs from Amazon, and hope that both halves of the 7th season will also soon be out on DVD.

But CBS/Viacom/Paramount has TAMPERED with the closing theme on most of these (1st-half) 6th-season episodes! The closing theme on the 6th and 7th seasons was in ""two parts"", almost like the 5th season's ""two part"" closing themes. (Also similar to how Gomer Pyle and Dick van Dyke has ""two part"" closing themes, which is more like 5th season Perry closings). But CBS/Viacom/Paramount has ""re-edited"" the two-part closing themes on these DVDs into a ""continuous"" closing credits/theme. It might not matter to some, but to ""die-hard"" fans, the ""essence"" of the 6th season closing theme is gone, with the re-edited version that CBS/Via/Paramount has done to it! At least ONE episode on the first-half 6th-season DVD set still has the original ""two-part"" version of the closing theme, ""Case of the Shoplifter's Shoe"" (with Lurene Tuttle, Margaret O'Brien, Leonard Nimoy, Shirley Mitchell, Arthur Batanides, and James Millhollin), and that's probably because this ""case"" is the same version that was on the 2008 Perry 50th Anniversary special DVD set. (The version on the 50th Anniversary DVD set also has the closing ""production side card"" with the sketch of the statue of Lady Justice, which really should NOT be there in 6th or later season ep's though! CBS only used that in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th seasons, each with a different fanfare music, and in the 1st/2nd seasons, the stack of books for the closing production title with fanfare music).

The 7th season of Perry had the same type of 2-part closing theme/credits that the 6th season did when originally done by CBS in 1963/64. I sure hope that CBS/Viacom/Paramount will NOT tamper with closing credits/themes for the two halves 7th season DVD sets. It's probably too late to mention the 2nd-half 6th-season since it's due out in just over a month, though.

And, also to CBS/Viacom/Paramount, whenever you release the two halves of the 4th/final season of (Desilu's) Untouchables, PLEASE include ALL ""bump"" music/titling! The ""out-tro"" bumps before the commercial breaks at :15, :30, :45 were there in the 1st season DVD sets (both halves), but cut-out of the 2nd and 3rd season DVD sets (both halves), although the FINAL ""out-tro"" bump just before the closing theme in 1st/2nd/3rd season sets is thankfully still there.

Traditional intro's/out-tro's (bumps) and ""billboards"", etc. _ARE_ of interest to us ""due-hard"" fans! And where's the ""Statue of Justice"" that Perry used as ""bumps"" before or after commercial breaks too?

4657184,5,B005D7E7ZY,"The original Perry Mason TV series (1957-1966) deserves a special commendation for being free of derogatory racial stereotypes -- an astonishing accomplishment, especially for that era!!*

In fact, the Perry Mason TV series (1957-1966) seemed to go out of it's way to subversively include dignified people of color, in non-stereotypical roles, usually skillfully hidden in plain view among the extras in the background.  Due to perspective, the POC sometimes appear to be on Raymond Burr's shoulder or otherwise connected to him.  Thanks RB. Shout out to the cast and production team (especially Gail Patrick Jackson).

In *""The Case of the Skeleton's Closet""* S06E26 (1963), the production team hired as *the presiding judge* a dignified unmistakably *black male* (0:45:15 - 0:45:20 approx.) who IMO resembles current U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.

In some ways, the 1950's era TV series was also directly *subversive of  Jim Crow.*  For example, in episodes such as *""The Case of the Runaway Corpse""* S01E10 (1957), the production team very cleverly and surreptitiously introduced an *interracial couple* (WM/BF), @ 0:46:53 - 0:47:10 approximately !!

Perry Mason was television's most successful and longest-running lawyer series.  At the time of its cancellation, Perry Mason was or had been airing in 58 countries.  ""I had no life outside of Perry Mason,"" Raymond Burr recalled.  ""And that went on 24 hours a day, six days a week. I never went home at night. I lived on the lot. I had a kitchen, bedroom, office space, sitting room  all of that.""  Wikipedia: Perry Mason (TV series).

4657187,5,B005D7E7ZY,"Perry Mason Season 6 Volume 1

These fourteen TV shows from 1962 are based on the novels of Erle Stanley Gardner. The books are more complete and informative, they tell about life that is not experienced by most people. The books explain why some things are done, the films only show you what happened. The books tell you about ropers, rough or smooth shadows, how to evade surveillance, and avoid leaving a back trail. Some questioned the legality and ethics of Perry Masons tactics but the stories were written before modern legal rules. The background tells about life in Los Angeles and America. There is nothing like these dramatic stories on todays broadcast TV. When was the last time you saw a trial lawyer as a hero? Erle Stanley Gardner was a founder of the Court of Last Resort which sought to free the unjustly convicted. Gardner sought to use scientific means to find the guilty rather than using hunches or guesses alone.

The seeming reality of these stories is due in part to characters who don't look like Hollywood actors. Some of the original stories were modified for TV. The theme music is typical for the late 1950s. Note the style of clothing and culture; ladies wore white gloves. People seldom lock their doors. The prices date these films. One advantage is seeing the many automobiles from that era. How many can you identify? Note the slimness of people, the smoking, and the familiarity with pistols. Watch how the actors express their emotions by their facial expressions. The camera sharpness and quality is excellent, but these films have a higher contrast than in earlier seasons. These stories often use the misinterpretation of circumstantial evidence to provide dramatic effects. The courtroom scenes are usually the Preliminary Hearings and often tell about the law. The cars tell of product placement. The titles begin with The Case of the .... Most are not from the novels; the year after the title shows the novel.

4657261,5,B005D7E7ZY,"We like all the series.  There are good reasons it was a popular show: well written, good actors.  This is kind of crime-drama.  Most begin with story, then there's a murder.  Someone calls for Perry Mason, criminal defense attorney.  A lot of the show is in the courtroom.  It has brief violence, which does not continue through the show.  Whoever gets arrested is probably not the murderer. You get a chance to figure out who it really is.  It's in black & white.",1385942400,,465,4.518072289156627

4657266,5,B005D7E7ZY,These shows still hold up and are fun to watch.  The quality of the DVDs is great and the packaging is attractive and includes the synopsis of each episode.  My only complaint is that each season is divided into Vol 1 and Vol 2 which means owning a season costs about $60 when most seasons of other shows is around $30.,1376697600,,319,4.213114754098361

4657269,5,B005D7E7ZY,"Raymond Burr worked awfully hard on making this series what it was and what it has since become.  It speaks of a different time and a different outlook on the part of many of our people.  I am continually amazed by the excellence of these episodes, even in the face of the deaths, illnesses and layoffs of the cast throughout its remarkable run.  I think that Mr. Gardner was a catalyst and a resource, but when other actors attempted to play these parts, their shows seem to have been assigned to oblivion.  It would be easy to attribute the success of the series to chemistry, talent, skillful working of the plots and such like.  But I am persuaded that it because of plain old hard work that we still enjoy these scenes featuring old Fords, one-blink police cars, wooden signs painted by the same person, and two-handed telephones.  It appears that Raymond Burr was never persuaded that the shows should have received the accolades that they did.  He poorly understood how so many of us then and now felt about the values expressed in the work he and his colleagues did.  There is nothing more satisfying than to see good people working under rough circumstances, conducting themselves admirably, and eventually bringing about the justice that we all yearn for.  I am about to complete my purchase of the entire collection.  It provides a proper setting for my giant tv and booming stereo system.  Perry Mason speaks with authority in my home.",1375660800,3,1447,4.725099601593626

4657271,4,B005D7E7ZY,"I love this show.  My only problem is that I bought season six just after I had seen that all on TV. (Hadn't realized that I was watching season 6)  Luckily, it doesn't take too long to forget these shows so you can watch them again.",1374105600,,233,4.043478260869565

4657277,5,B005D7E7ZY,"Yes, all the plots run a similar style and outcome, but that's what made it great.  Stick with a winner and don't change it.  The young producers of today should study the past better.  TV used to appeal to wide demographics.  Now it's just a narrow portion and only 20 - 35 year olds.",1364774400,,285,4.222222222222222

Of course Della could use a good hair styling expert! Seems like she had more taste when she was younger! Not to mention some of our all time favorites like Ray Collins (Tragg) is missing in some of these, they are still great! Movie arrived on schedule an great condition...however, the postman left the movies on the porch with no signature, which was a shock to me! Fortunately no one walked away with them! Highly recommend this one!",1358726400,,577,4.452830188679245

I like having them on dvd now without all the nonsense commercials, the logos in two corners of the screen and banners pasted across the bottom. I like the fact too that they are full length - not missing segments to make way for more commercials. These are great!",1358294400,,373,4.194444444444445

4657287,5,B005D7E7ZY,I always put on a Perry Mason DVD when I am doing work around the house.  Why?  Because I have watched them so much that I know the scripts by memory and can visualize what is happening even when I can't see the TV.  THis series is a reminder of my younger days and of sitting around the living room around the TV watching with my parents.,1357603200,,339,4.029850746268656

4657290,5,B005D7E7ZY,"One of the best TV shows of all time.  These episodes are like miniature film noirs, complete with an L.A. setting, black and white, murder, and sleazy on the edge characters.

4657293,5,B005D7E7ZY,"I bought this for my folks.  They cannot get enough of Perry Mason, his great sidekicks, and his quick wit.  Every year the newest DVD comes out I buy it for them.  They watch each show so many times it is funny.  But they are older and have a lot of time on their hands, so it is good for them to have something they enjoy.

Season six has some great episodes.  I have watched quite a few of them already, every time I am visiting them, so I have to say we are all very pleased with the boxed set.  Always entertaining!  Highly recommended for anyone who loves Perry Mason.  You will need to collect the entire library!  :o)",1345680000,5,625,4.133333333333334

With season Six I see a big difference in how often Della Street is in the episode.  Sometimes she only utters a few lines throughout the entire show.  Since she is one of my favorite characters the show seems very different and with the loss of Lieutenant Tragg it just isn't the same.  Still, it is a very good show.  I didn't particularly care for the one with Bette Davis.  I realize she is an icon but I want to see Perry Mason not Bette Davis.",1336435200,3,613,4.066666666666666

4657296,5,B005D7E7ZY,"I received Season 6, volume 1 & 2 for xmas. I love the fact it's still B&W, they didn't colorize it.. still has that film noir quality to it. The stories seem a bit more involved, the plots a little more complex this season. All the old regulars are back, though Tragg has less screen time (due to health issues I'm sure) , and Sgt Anderson ""Andy"" more... My favorite episodes so far are ""The Bogus Books, the Capricious corpse and the Double entry mind"" (the scene where Sandover is racing up the company stairs with the missing deposit, while his boss is riding up in the elevator with the armed guards, is hair-raising) If I have one criicism, it's that some of the themes seem a tad redundant... several episodes involving long lost daughters vying for inheritance, ""dead"" husbands resurrected, fake uncles... but hey it's Perry Mason. It's like pizza, or sex or chocolate.. how bad can it be.",1326067200,2,897,4.6125

Since then we have watched them over and over , and have purchased each one as they release new ones. They are still fascinating, if dated. There is no violence on screeen even though every episode includes at least one murder. Perry is clever, hard working and honest. A true role model. The stories are similar enough to be recognizable, but different enough to be entertaining. Each is a puzzle with the clues [present for anyone to figure it out. We discovered our ten year old grand daughter loves them as well.",1320883200,,630,4.535087719298246
4657304,5,B005D7E7ZY,"I simply love watching these shows.  They are thoughtful, with intelligent dialog, interesting plots, - the list of positives goes on and on.  The courtroom scenes are excellent, as always.  One slight change - this season includes a revised opening courtroom scene, shown during the intro music.

Thank goodness this was made in the 50s and 60s. If this was made in 2011, Perry would probably be having a periodic emotional melt-down over a turbulent, 'on again - off again' affair with Della, Paul would be struggling with his suppressed homosexuality, Hamilton Burger would be going through a nasty divorce from a wife who felt neglected, but was actually having an affair herself with Lt. Anderson, who was, in turn, conflicted over neglecting his juvenile deliquent, 15 y.o. son from his first marriage, while not wanting to reveal that his real father was actually Lt. Tragg . . .  you get the point.  The courtroom drama would take at best a second seat to the absurd soap opera that televsion now portrays as reality.",1320710400,3,1025,4.862068965517241

Compared with the movie theater Perry Mason of the 1930's and 1940's this series reveals the true character of Perry Mason wrapped in honesty, ethics, and fairness.
