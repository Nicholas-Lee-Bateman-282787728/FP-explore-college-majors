8364934,4,B002D7XFIW,The movie is a little Will Rodgers gem from the 1930s.  Picture had good sound and clarity (considering the age of the film).  Will do business again with seller.,1520121600,,162,4.551724137931035
8364935,3,B002D7XFIW,Yes it did. However it was not the movie I was looking for. My mother as a small child was in one of his movies. She was an extra at a horse race standing next to Stepnfetchit. I don't remember the name of it . I would love to find that one.,1441843200,,241,3.6538461538461537
8364936,3,B002D7XFIW,"I got this movie because I've been actively involved in Harness Racing for over 50 years and I liked Will Rogers in David Harum. I am really not a huge fan of Will Rogers and this movie , while it had a few very funny scenes, was no where near as hilarious as David Harum. It was a good time waster for a dreary afternoon and I have recommended it to some friends on the racing game!",1392940800,,383,3.987012987012987
8364937,3,B002D7XFIW,"In this film shown in theaters three months after his death, Will Rogers played a horse trainer in Kentucky.  The family that employs him is engaged in a feud with the family that owns the neighboring property, a quarrel to be settled by a horse race.

There are TWO stars in this film -- Will Rogers and Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson, who plays Rogers' cook and helper in training the thoroughbreds for the track.  Robinson shows off his amazing skills in tap dancing in a number of finely staged solo numbers, and there's another congenial scene with Robinson teaching Rogers a few elementary steps.  It's worth noting that Robinson was prominently featured in a recent festival, ""The World of Tap Dance,"" at the City University of New York.

These scenes that showcase Robinson's gifts are, though, embedded in a screenplay that plays to the racial stereotypes of the times.  Most moviegoers of the 1930s laughed at a scene with Rogers in blackface; I winced and could not wait for it to end.  Also discomforting today is the use of ""boy"" in the dialog (though not with an edge).  The film gives us a window on 1930s language and attitudes, and aware viewers can appreciate how Will Rogers' humor and Robinson's dances can stand on their own.  Alas, the old stereotypes can't be wished out of the film, and they impair a larger appreciation of ""In Old Kentucky.""

The comedy in the film is somewhat more physical than Rogers' roles in some of his other films -- there's a lot of motion back and forth, fisticuffs, and oddball characters -- giving the film a somewhat zany mood.  The scenes of the horse farm and the track capture an interesting corner of the 1930s.
