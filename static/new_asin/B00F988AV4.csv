5971491,5,B00F988AV4,Fantastic.  Johan Falk takes Swedish crime thrillers to a whole new level.  He can kick it with the best of them.,1395014400,,113,4.333333333333333
5971492,4,B00F988AV4,"Great stories and acting and scenes... only limitation is English subtitles instead of  English duped over/in. For us my wife's has had 2 strokes, we enjoy watching action/mysteries together, but she has real problems with subtitles. Unfortunately we couldn't enjoy this trilogy together.",1393200000,,288,5.6976744186046515
5971493,5,B00F988AV4,"Great storylines, very easy to follow even with out the subtitles.
Yes, the subtiltles make it bit easier.
Acting was very well done.",1392336000,,133,4.826086956521739
5971494,4,B00F988AV4,"Nothing can compare to Borgan! But very good. Looking forward to more Scandy mysteries. The actors look like real people, not Barbie and Ken dolls.",1391126400,,147,4.92
5971495,5,B00F988AV4,"I wasn't sure what I was getting into with the opening scene of Episode 1 -- it was a strange way to introduce so vital and forceful a character.  The viewer is kept off-balance wondering ""Who IS this guy?"" as our protagonist watches cartoons, saves boxes of toys and picks up a woman in a cafe for a surprisingly matter-of-fact tryst on Christmas Eve.  But then, the real story begins with a wallop of excitement.  The pace never really returns to that strange, languid opening segment.  I won't repeat a synopsis of the three episodes since a previous reviewer did a splendid job of that already.  However, I will say that my husband and I were enthralled by the freshness of the plots, their intricacy, and the fact that they prompt some serious thought long after the episode ends.  The subject matter is timely and relevant to the multiplicity of issues swirling around the burgeoning global economy (and some of the unintended consequences that result).  My only real criticism concerns the character development of Johan Falk -- could use a bit more work.  He's painted in bold brush strokes with very little subtlety.  He is clearly both valued and disliked by his colleagues and friends.  He's prickly and self-absorbed.  It's hard to get the real measure of Falk or the background for the strong personal connections and tensions he inspires.  Still, the intelligence of the plots, the intensity of the human drama that unfolds around him, and the high-octane action sequences in each episode make for an absorbing and exciting viewing experience.  Highly recommended.",1390435200,11,1578,4.931818181818182
5971496,5,B00F988AV4,An enjoyable police show with credible story lines. Scandinavian shows are usually of this calibre. There is nothing more I can say.,1388275200,,132,5.045454545454546
5971497,5,B00F988AV4,"The Johan Falk-series came out first between 1999-2003 with these Three Movies and was a huge success in Sweden, and Scandinavia overall. The actors are really good and the director Anders Nilsson is fenomenal. These Movies showes reality problems that is going on in the World right now. It is the first Swedish Movies that really has a chance to become big outside Scandinavia both when it comes to directing, acting and storyline. To bad for you people outside of Scandinavia who havn't had the chance to Watch these Movies until now. If you really liked these Three, there is a continue of six films that came out in Scandinavia in 2009.

Those Movies are even better!! It gets a lot more exciting. Those six Movies are so called the first season of Three seasons with each seasons have six Movies. The movies are based on real Life events from cops and infiltratrs. Especally one Swedish infiltrator named Peter Rtz who was Swedens most advanced infiltrator for nine years Before he was exposed in 2004 and was completly left out and ""forgotten"" by the Swedish police. You Think you have Heard this story Before? Not exacly, because in Sweden it is not legal to use civiliance/private persons as infiltrator like it is in America for example. You get to see both the police sides and the bad guys side.

Another six Movies came out in 2012 and the third and last seasons are fans still waiting for.

Give them a chance because these are my favorite Movies and I Think they deserve more attention outside of Scandinavia then it's gotten.",1388188800,12,1541,4.7
5971498,5,B00F988AV4,Jakob Eklund does a great job of acting in this Danish police trilogy. This makes you want to see more.,1388016000,,103,4.2
5971499,3,B00F988AV4,"The Johan Falk Trilogy is very strong on action and suspense. There are car chases aplenty, shootouts and fairly complex plot lines. In some ways, the three episodes appear to be modeled after US crime thrillers, quite unlike the Nordic Noir series I like best: Beck, Wallander, The Bridge, The Killing, The Protectors. Character development is skimpy, and there are not many layers of ""action behind the action"", not to mention the social critique characteristic for recent Scandinavian productions. Jacob Eklund does not portray an engaging character. This may be due to the script, but also to his exceedingly bland acting: he has two or three standard facial expressions, that's it. The other characters also come across as fairly two-dimensional. All in all, this is suspenseful entertainment, but not memorable at all.",1387929600,5,824,5.25
5971500,5,B00F988AV4,"I, at first, stumbled onto MHz networks which has various shows called International Drama and Mystery. Fortunately, I had DVR'd this series and have watched it three times. I have got to tell you that this is, by far, a SUPERIOR series and is as good as if not better than anything we have here in the US. Complex with twists and will leave you on the edge of your seat. If you can deal with sub-titles and occasional spoken English, I STRONGLY recommend this series and give it * * * * * * (that would be 6 stars) !!!",1381017600,28,519,4.148514851485149
5971501,5,B00F988AV4,"The Johan Falf Trilogy blew my socks off !!!
I read a lot of fiction/non-fiction.
And in those, I have to read between the lines, as some truths are generally being obfuscated, if not purposely hidden.
This Trilogy takes it, from a tip-top exposure of the vast criminal ice-berg underworld empire; and then follows it deep down into the proverbial rabbit-hole.",1423353600,,360,4.918032786885246
5971502,1,B00F988AV4,"I bought this to have the background for the six episode series now offered by MHZ Networks.  It is not worth the $25.27 I paid for it.  I watched one episode and three quarters of the second one, then I gave up (judging from what I have seen, the third episode will be just more of the same).  First, the actor who plays Johan Falk is not convincing at all; he looks more like one of the Mormons who peddle religion from door to door every summer (and they don't look like policemen).  Then, it is mostly about shooting (rat-tat-tat-tat...) with young girls in danger of being murdered or taken hostage.  There is practically no detective work involved, and no suspense of any kind; it is all about gangsters and who is going to shoot first -- but since it is make-believe, you know that Johan Falk will prevail in the end.  In one word:  ""boring"".

This is no better than  ""The Spider"" and it will join it on the public library foreign-movie shelves.

P.S.  It has nothing in common with Wallander, The Killing, Arne Dahl, Beck, or any of the other ""noir"" series I have seen.  It is also way below Van Veeteren (which is very good, but not really ""noir"") and Salamander  (first rate too). You may also want to try Spiral, the Octopus, Fog and Crime, Montalbano and Brunetti (the last three not ""noir"").  Even Coliandro is better than this.  But you don't have to believe me; as they say: ""Try it, you won't like it"" (or perhaps you will).",1413936000,7,1440,4.422053231939164

5971506,5,B00F988AV4,"Fabulous series! Well written and well acted. Exciting action drama following the well trained Swedish policeman Johan Falk who takes matter into his own hands when there is graft/spies within the police force, who are also protecting a fully armed criminal network beginning to take over the European economic systems.

8613338,5,B00F988AV4,"First, I love Joel Kinnaman, been a fan since the Killing, but this series I think this is actually his best acting/performance - if you have an all region player I suggest getting this,  really good series.",1442275200,,207,4.594594594594595
