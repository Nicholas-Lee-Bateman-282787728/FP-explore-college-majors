8478220,4,B005LKH7HS,"This fabulous history of the Ashes in 1981 sets the event against the social and economic climate of Thatcher's England. In a time of race and class riots, of disillusionment and divisiveness, Botham's heroic recovery after the captaincy is taken from him is uplifting. And the unlikely camaraderie and respect between the rough diamond Botham and the elegant intellectual Brierley is inspiring. Well worth watching - even for those who are not 'cricket tragics'",1326067200,,462,5.256756756756757
