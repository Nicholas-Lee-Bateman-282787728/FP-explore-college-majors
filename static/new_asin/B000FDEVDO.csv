2561263,1,B000FDEVDO,"This movie is absolutely horrible.  My 4 1/2 loves it, but I'm going to do my best to hide it from him.  This can't even be considered a rip off; just an embarrasment.  Disney is in no danger of losing money to this thing.  If anything, it should make customers mad enough to go out and buy the real thing.  Spend the extra $10 and buy the movie Cars. This movie isn't in the same league.  It can't be considered competition or complimentary.  It's junk all by itself.",1167609600,2,468,4.25
2561264,1,B000FDEVDO,"Do not buy this movie.  It is only a 1/2 hour long and out of that 1/2 hour, almost all of it is nothing but cars talking...no action, no racing, just talking.  I have two boys ages 3 and 2 and both of them were bored within the first 10 min of this movie.  We kept waiting for something to happen, but all that ever happens is talking and more talking with lousy effects.  My kids love ""Cars"" and yet they were bored to tears with this movie.",1167264000,5,443,4.0
2561265,4,B000FDEVDO,"First, I don't think Disney is losing any money because of this kind of low budget video.  How original is a talking car?  The Cars movie was very well done and Disney was guaranteed success because they saw the success of other talking vehicles like Jay Jay and Thomas the Tank Engine.

As far as the movie goes, it was less than ten dollars, it has nothing inappropriate in it, and my kids love it.  I have a three year old and a five year old.  It was a stocking stuffer for my three year old, but both want to watch it.  They love it.  I was not buying a video for myself.",1167264000,,576,4.04424778761062
2561266,1,B000FDEVDO,"The overall quality is poor. The jokes are dumb and not at all age appropriate for the intended audience. The plot is predictable, not to mention a blatant rip off. What else can be said? Save your money and buy the pre-released version of the real thing for $5.00 more. The only thing I might add is that not only is this product worthless but  don't even think of buying it out of curiosity. You will be extremely disappointed and supportive of this kind of scam merchandising.",1159920000,8,479,4.505747126436781
2561267,3,B000FDEVDO,"I purchased this movie for my son who is 2 1/2 years old. Ever since he saw the movie ""The Cars"", all he wants to play with is any cars with eyes. Plus he keeps on wanting to go see the movie. So when I saw this dvd I decided to buy it for him, since the dvd for ""The Cars"" won't be out for a long time. The movie is not like ""The Cars"" at all. The computer graphics are terrible. And sometimes the lips of the cars are not in sync with the voice. But beside all that.....MY SON LOVES THE MOVIE! He wants to watch it all the time. The movie does have cars with eyes and it will keep him occupied until the real movie comes out. Overall it is satisfactory. I would recommend it for anyone who has a 2 year old child who loves cars.",1153094400,25,730,3.8410596026490067
2561268,1,B000FDEVDO,A total ripoff of Disney's Cars.  You shouldn't buy this and Disney should sue!  It was horrible.,1151366400,21,97,4.647058823529412
2561271,1,B000FDEVDO,"What a trick! We thought we were renting something similar to PIXAR's Cars - this is horrible!  Lame animation. Lame story. Lame voice actors. Lame music. I would rather be punched in the nose and kicked in the shin than ever watch this movie again.

...did I mention it's lame?",1234742400,4,278,4.54
2561272,1,B000FDEVDO,"This is one of my least favorite videos, but my son seems to like it. The graphics are so poor that it looks like talking cars on a really old video game from the 80's that are floating across a pixelated road. Fortunately, it's not very long. I would not recommend this video. You get more for your dollar by buying the Disney Cars movie - which is my son's favorite anyway.",1232496000,3,375,4.222222222222222
2561273,1,B000FDEVDO,"This is just an atrocious little movie. The dialog is fine and the voice acting is OK, but the graphics are awful and make it virtually unwatchable for an adult. Think video game graphics from 1995, but with no direction and barely any camera movement.

My son (4 years old) liked it enough for one viewing. He didn't seem thrilled.

Glad I rented and not bought it!",1231459200,2,366,4.447761194029851
2561274,1,B000FDEVDO,"First of all. I am from Brazil and this was a ""Brazilian production"". But Every Brazilian CG ARtist just hate this production, cause it's a shame for the world to had something like that produced here. Brazil is very strong in Computer Graphics, exporting so much talented artists to around the world, and we have tons of very good artists here. Please, don't consider that production as an example of Brazillian CGI Capacities, this is the worst thing we ever saw on our industry...",1229385600,4,483,4.761904761904762
2561275,1,B000FDEVDO,"And this is not. This movie is completely ripping off Pixar's ""Cars"". Do your children a favor: they don't have the freedom yet to choose quality over dreck, nutrition over junkfood. Sit down and watch Pixar's ""Cars"" with them instead of buying this cheap imitation; you might find yourself entertained as well.",1185148800,8,311,5.0

2561277,1,B000FDEVDO,This movies is made with very poor quality. I would not recommend anyone buy this. My kids will not watch it.,1174953600,,109,4.238095238095238
2561278,1,B000FDEVDO,"This is the very worst kid's DVD I have ever purchased. The movie is almost entirely insults and suggestive dialog. The male cars comment on how much they like the girl car's ""headlights"". Another car embezzles money and gambles with it. What is this movie teaching children? There is nothing of value for children in this movie. Take the money this video costs and buy a bag of rocks. The bag of rocks will be more entertaining, educational, and have more replay value than this waste of time and plastic. Oh yeah, the animation sucks too.",1174262400,19,540,4.635416666666667

8120895,1,B000FDEVDO,"Deceptive ripoff of the Cars movie and characters. Awful animation, inappropriate situations, inappropriate language for the age group (eg characters tell each other to ""shut up!""), and just plain a waste of you and your child's time.",1334534400,,234,5.351351351351352
8120896,1,B000FDEVDO,"Let's face it - the only ones who will be interested in watching this movie are preschool-aged boys.  They don't care that the animation is bad and that it may or may not be a ripoff.  The real problem is that it's just boring!  There's very little racing or action at all.  It's mostly just a bunch of cars sitting around having long conversations about topics that are completely out of range for a little boy.  Jealousy, being in love ... forget it!  This movie is WAY beneath any one over the age of 6.  Yet the conversational topics are way above anyone below the age of 12.",1320364800,3,579,4.305555555555555
8120897,1,B000FDEVDO,This is by far the worst childrens dvd I have ever seen.  The graphics are pathetic.  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,1317772800,,107,4.3
8120898,1,B000FDEVDO,"thank goodness I rented this movie at a Red Box, for $1.00! It was the worst cartoon film I have ever seen. My 3 yr old grandson liked it for 5 minutes, then he wanted me to put in the ""real cars movie"", but we watched it all of this movie to see what is what about...yawn...30 minutes of pure garbage!!!
 I found it to be very mean, spiteful, and then it had suggestive and lewd comments that were just awful. Never buy this film, and never rent it either! well, unless you have nothing better to do, and you can find it for a $1.00, hey maybe it can used for target practice...shoot it!",1302825600,,588,4.113043478260869
8120899,1,B000FDEVDO,"ok, I watched the whole movie and it is half hour long. I rated this 1 out of 5, because it is a terrible ripoff of Pixar Cars, The CGI animation was crap, the storyline is boring and the voices are annoying. The scenes were boring, I almost fell asleep. I would never recommend this to any hardcore Disney fans. Please get Pixar Cars instead.",1284163200,,343,4.292307692307692
8120900,1,B000FDEVDO,"The bad:

8120901,5,B000FDEVDO,I love this movie.  I love watching it with my grandchildren and have collected all the small car characters to go with it.  Great fun for all ages.  The expressions and personalities of the cars are priceless.,1267660800,2,210,4.621621621621622

8120903,1,B000FDEVDO,I got this dvd because my son loves the Disney movie Cars. I put it in to watch myself to see what it is like. It was poorly made. Really bad graphics. I put it on for my 3 year old to see and he asked me to turn it off and didn't want to see it lol! I would NOT buy this one.,1235433600,3,276,3.328125
