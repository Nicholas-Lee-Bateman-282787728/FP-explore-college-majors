8564303,5,B00B8WXFA6,I have spent my entire life traveling to the Sea of Cortez. I thought the underwater photography was beautiful and it was a great synopsis of some of the issues faced. It is worth a series.,1482019200,,189,4.277777777777778
8564304,4,B00B8WXFA6,"Various segments of this documentary are uploaded to Vimeo and YouTube.  The complete version is available on DVD.  Just be aware of some (not all) scenes that have kinda choppy motion.  I could understand that certain kinds of equipment must've been used to cut down production cost.  Once you get past these drawbacks, it looks pretty good.  The documentary itself is well done and educational.  As for the price... well, I could see it as a very worthwhile budget DVD, especially for less than $10.  What I can say is that if you're not too picky about the occasional not-quite-smooth-enough motion, and if you can get it for the cheapest price you can find, it may be worth watching.",1439424000,,687,4.722689075630252
8564305,3,B00B8WXFA6,"This is a not bad documentary, with a lot of good underwater photography and some nice shots of the Cortez landscape.  But it doesn't cover the Steinbeck-Ricketts journey in any depth at all. We don't get to follow their journey around the Sea, their landfalls, or get any sense of the book. There is a sentence or two about the ecology, but that is it.  There are shots of the impending World War II (two days after the book was published),  but the documentary doesn't even cover the fact that there were Japanese boats in the area.  The best part of the documentary is a little exposition of the La Nina-El Nino phenomenon (unknown to the original participants).  This was all a huge opportunity, missed.",1439251200,,707,4.624
