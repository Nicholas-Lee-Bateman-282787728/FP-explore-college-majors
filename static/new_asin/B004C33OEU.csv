The movie begins with a speeding truck that misses a turn and rolls over in a crash. Next we see sports cars racing along a country road. One car pulls into a caf for a meal. The waitress complains about taxes. One customer pays and is questioned about a ride. There is action, and this driver falls to the floor. This stranger acts to drive the woman's sport car south. ""Going someplace?"" ""He don't seem like the Jaguar type."" The Nash police car arrives at that caf, they get eyewitness identification. Frank Webster talks to his passenger. Frank will drive over the mountains to avoid the police. Frank knows how to start a car. Connie wants to be let alone. The car coasts down the hill. They pass the inspection on the road and proceed to the racing grounds.

Their car qualifies. The police are still searching for an unknown man. Can they find a house to hide in? Frank explains his past, and frame-up in that truck accident. They talk to the caretaker and leave. Some old cars race around the track. There is a Concours d'Elegance first. ""You don't look like a sports car man."" They go for a walk in the dark. ""Exercise is good for your figure."" Can Connie escape from that shed? [Burning down a locked shed is not a good escape method!] The race begins. Connie borrows another car. There is action from the car race. Frank stops to help Favor. He has made a new decision. [Or was it the Production Code?]

This is a low-budget production but not a bad story. It tells about the new motor sport of sports car racing in southern California. This is different from the other hot-rod movies of that era.",1301875200,,1645,4.458471760797342
