8000006,4,B0000D8DU2,"Mostly rehashed film that is seen all the time on History or Military Channel, can't say that there was really anything new. Stll not sorry I bought it.",1381104000,,152,4.464285714285714
8000007,1,B0000D8DU2,"The DVDs produced by this film maker are created on a computer.  They are not commercial DVDs.  The documentaries contain valuable historical information, but they are unnecessarily lengthened with inappropriate scenes, cartoon-like graphics and ill-fitting sound effects.  If it wasn't such serious material, it would be laughable.  These documentaries are put together by the rankest amateur.  There are far superior documentaries on these subjects.",1246492800,,451,5.984375
8000008,1,B0000D8DU2,"Just another garbage film, made from 10 other garbage films. Even one of the scenes is shown as a ""German extermination of jews"" when it is CLEARLY Russians wearing unkempt uniforms, walking like Russians, smoking like Russians...even wearing Russian coats and boots. Stills from this film suggested it was the murder of Poles at Katyn forest (Blamed on Germany until the fall of the USSR) but others agree they ARENT German soldiers, one is wearing a black tanker's uniform and pretending to be SS (the Russian actor didn't know the difference, just saw the black uniform)",1238803200,2,573,4.979166666666667
8000009,2,B0000D8DU2,"What a strange documentary.  With regard to the Hitler documentary, the intro alone took a good five minutes, and then it seemed to start over again.  The film is marred by using the same sound loops over and over again in short little 5 second sections (aircraft flying, bombs exploding, etc.).  Also the same film footage is often repeated, except the perspective is reversed (for example, an aircraft is shown flying left to right, then later the same footage is reversed to show the aircraft flying right to left).  Lots of good footage of Hitler speaking - however, no subtitles, so us non-German speaking viewers are left to our own devices in deciphering the relevance of the subject matter.

With no voice-overs we are at the mercy of rolling written quotations from Hitler as well as editorial comments from the documentarians for any kind of plot progression.  This is awkward, and makes for very slow moving and disjointed film.  As another reviewer pointed out, much of the film footage is shown out of sequence with the time line of the film.

While watching the film, at times I was convinced the creators were trying to make some kind of religious point, implying (by way of the written commentary rolling across the screen) that there was some sort of Satan / Hitler connection.  Also, there were many references and quotes from Hitler himself about ""the Voice"".  I am moderately well read on Hitler and Nazi Germany and this is the first I've heard of ""the Voice"".

The final point of the film was interesting and fairly unique.  With all of the attempts made on Hitler's life, and with all the combat experience he had in WWI, history will show that the only person who could kill Hitler was Hitler himself.",1230768000,,1725,4.7324414715719065
8000010,1,B0000D8DU2,"Where do you start on a DVD like this. ?
I will start with the better part on side B dealing with Japanese atrocities in Asia & in particular with the Nanking massacres.
The film is graphic, shocking & based on facts with a scholarly / historical approach. There are extensive eye witness accounts of the most appalling brutality not just from Chinese surviviors but also Western journalists & even a genuine German Nazi whi tried to shelter some of the Chinese. There are also eye witness accounts from Japanese soldiers, officers, journalists & even from contemporary Japanese newspapers with photographs.
The massacres were sustained (c 8 weeks in Nanking alone), widespread & sanctioned from the very top as a war tactic aimed at cowing resistance to Imperial Japan.
This movie is not for the squemish or the faint hearted.

That's the (relatively) good part. The Hitler diaries is just the opposite. It is full of action shots of explosions, deaths, atrocities, mass murder etc but it jumps around in a bizarre manner. The film follows the conventional chronology starting with Hitler's early years, his brutal childhood & teenage poverty in Vienna. Then on into the 1st World War thru to the end in 1945.
There are glaring errors, Hitler did not conceive of & begin the Autobahn construction, he accelerated it after he came to power. He did not design the Volkswagen, he commissioned Ferdinand Porsche to do it.
As we get to the war years the film becomes increasingly muddled with continuous flashbacks to the 30's newsreels & Triumph of the Will. This is not only inaccurate, it is confusing. Do we really need to see the Leibstandarte marching in the Triumph sequence three times but with different music ? Why do we get to see Hitler's 1930's Newsreels in the middle of the war footage ? Why put Hitler descending the steps at Berchtesgaden to the Badenweiler march ? This is just silly.
Why is the Holocaust dealt with twice but with much of the same footage ?
We are told early on that Hitler was guided by something called ""the voice"". This told him all sorts of things incl that he must slaughter the Jews. There are other continous pseudo-magic / paranormal claims throughout. Indeed if this film has a central theme it could be said to be ""blame the voice"" ! If this is true it presumably means that Hitler was what would now be called a schizophrenic, insane which lets him off the hook for any guilt or blame.
The film does not explicitly make this claim it only implies it but without anything like enough evidence for such a conclusion.
I am inclined to think that without such evidence that ""the voice is innocent"".
A truly awful, pointless movie.
Lastly, despite the title, there is no mention anywhere of Hitler's diaries.",1197158400,13,2746,4.7447698744769875
8000011,1,B0000D8DU2,"Waste of money! This DVD is just a collection of footage and text on the screen with excerpts from a diary. With no narrator or dramaturgic variation or story line, this seems like a cheap spin-off product just made fro making a profit. There are many other GOOD movies and documentaries in the same category that are far more recommendable! Save your money and shelf space on this one...",1196899200,5,388,4.63768115942029
