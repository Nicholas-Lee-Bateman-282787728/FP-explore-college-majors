3991676,5,B002UOMGW4,"Having just watched the full series of Heroic Age in its Blu-ray incarnation (it was only just released this month), I must give it a very strong recommendation.  Set in a world that essentially unites elements of Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, and with explicit influence from Greek mythology, the show is an obvious choice for fans of sci-fi spectacle.  Action fans will enjoy heavy-hitting, subwoofer friendly battles of often entertainingly absurd scale.  If planets and even galaxies could run and hide, they'd be advised to in Heroic Age.  But the show is also more than just bang and boom.

Political intrigue and emotional underpinnings of the battles are never far from mind.  Many of the important players in the show are desperately looking for a way out of the violence and chaos, not reveling in it.  Two of four primary tribes (species) in the series have been set to battle each other, many confused by the meaning of contractual obligations (Labors) set before them, or rather to individual powerful beings ""assigned"" to them.  These two are the technologically sophisticated but blindly arrogant Silver Tribe, and the space-faring upstarts the Iron Tribe, our human race.  The Golden tribe is the one each aspires to find but which has also set them into galactic conflict.  The Bronze tribe is an insect-like tribe that works at the behest of whichever tribe has been granted control over them.  In this case, that would be the Silver tribe which uses them as front-line fodder against the Iron Tribe.

Last but not in the slightest least, there are five dominant beings formerly of the Heroic tribe.  Four of them are under the thumb of the Silver tribe due either to contract or threats against their related homeworlds.  The fifth is within our titular hero, Age.

Age is a young man of straightforward innocence found alone on a planet by Princess Dhianeila and a group of human space-farers who quickly discover his true power when he transmutes into the powerful being Belcross (a ""Nodos"") to single-handedly smite a planetary invading force of the Bronze tribe.

With some comic relief early on as Age acclimates to his new-found friends, the show largely shifts to the aforementioned interstellar political wrangling and the mega-battles that usually ensue when not all players are interested in talking.  As such, for those looking for much in the way of relationships and interpersonal drama, it is there but kept largely secondary in this grand conflict.  There is some to be had such as whether the otherwise smart soldier Iolaous will ever see past his own dense infatuated loyalty to Dhianeila to recognize that her best friend and healer Aneasha is always there for him.  But keep in mind that this is a show in which even Age himself becomes at times tertiary to the wider conflict.

As for the visual quality of the Blu-ray, the show is an upscale that benefits from great clarity of color and line and the constant and fast-paced action never suffers from compression issues.  Importantly, with a rare exception such as in a disc 3 episode with excessive banding, the wide expanses of space otherwise manage to be held crystal clear.

Finally, the surround audio English track features universally solid voice acting and will rock your sound system during the many battles.  The English voice cast especially excels over the Japanese interpretations of these animated creations in the cases of Christopher Sabat and Lydia Mackay.  The former best defining the character of Karkinos and the latter of Prome O.",1266796800,54,3546,4.9711864406779664
3991677,5,B002UOMGW4,"Much like Claymore and D. Gray-man, this is a fairly recent series I loved watching on rented DVDs, but held off on buying on the off-chance it would arrive on blu-ray. And here we are. The animation for this series is stunning, and I love the story. It's not without problems; sometimes the battles between the Nodos get a little redundant and tedious, and some of the main characters are downright unlikable. Even so, it adds some unique ideas to the space opera genre, and ends far more conclusively than some other series I could name. Recommended (though try a couple episodes before you drop the dough on the whole collection).",1259107200,20,633,4.711711711711712

3991683,3,B002UOMGW4,"A average anime that tried to be epic, but definitely had the potential to get there. It feels like it was drawn out to be 26 episodes. Would have been better as 13 because the battles are drawn out and boring. Or they could have fleshed out the romance, backstory, and universe more to fill it up. It had a amazing universe and I love how they told the story. Characters were disappointing though.

Be warned, if you are good at foreshadowing then you know what is going to happen after the first 2 episodes. It is even worse if you are familiar with Greek mythology.

The main music theme was over used even though I actually liked it. It is like they was lacking variety in their theme music. No complaints about the voice acting and artwork.

3991705,4,B002UOMGW4,"I watched the anime because of Psycho Pass 2 and my newfound love for series writer Tow Ubukata. A man so talented he can make Xebec un-suck. The series starts a bit slow and generic/confusing but grows into a nice and and well constructed space opera. The art direction is a bit less bland that one would expect of Hisashi Hirai but nothing special. The anime should have been shorter but the journey was worth it. Especially the emotional end but the love story(s) should have deserved more focus. Less identical looking space battles could have helped too but they were at least pretty . So if you want likable characters and a story that reminded me of Yamato/Crest of the Stars or a less confusing Xeno-franchise game this one is good. A 7,5/10 it is and this is their second best original anime after Martian Successor Nadesico(8/10).",1418688000,,840,4.6824324324324325
3991706,5,B002UOMGW4,"Heroic age is one of the best animes I've seen.  It was originally made by Xebec studio, as a television series.  The series was then picked up by a Manga Magazine.  The series is not rated, as many anime aren't, but if it did have a rating it would be PG, at worse.

  I'm a big fan of Japanese anime because of the visual imagery, but also because of the deep-seeded meaning behind their stories.  They can be quirky, action-packed, dramatic, or any other type of genre, but there is almost always a deep philosophy shared.  Sometimes it's hard to find, but it is usually there.  Heroic Age is riddled with it.

  The very characters are based on Greek mythology.  Age, the protagonist, is loosely based on Hercules, and the twelve labors he had to perform.  Even the title Heroic Age refers to the heroic age of the Greek heroes.  The tribes come from the Greek poet Hesiod, and his five ages of mankind.  The Golden Tribe is the Golden Age of immortals, or the gods.  The Silver Tribe is after the Silver Age of men, or those ruled under the god Zeus.  They always squabbled and lived short lives.  They refused to worship Zeus, so he destroyed them.  The Bronze Tribe was patterned after the Bronze Age where Zeus supposedly made men out of ash tree.  They had armor made of bronze, as were their tools and weapons.  They were violent, and unworthy, so they died and were sent to live with Hades.  The Heroic Tribe is patterned after the Heroic Age.  This age was not compared to any metal.  Men were made from the bones of the earth.  Men lived with demigods and heroes.  The men from this age made a name for themselves and their names were jotted down to be remembered for all times.  Most of the heroes from Greek Mythology come from this age.  The Iron Tribe is patterned after the Iron Age, which is supposed to be the age we live in; a time when the gods had forsaken men.  Man had to toil for their own support.  Men fought men, brother fought brother, and there were curses and plagues upon all men.

  So, all that depth was put into the making of this T.V. series.  Now, lets learn about the series.  It's set in a futuristic society where all of the Tribes are capable of interstellar travel, but there had to maps, or reference points, usually planets, for them to get from one place to another.  The Golden Tribe ruled supreme, but left the galaxy after they imparted their knowledge on to the humanoid Silver Tribe, the insect-like Bronze Tribe, and the greatest warriors, the Heroic Tribe.  The Heroic Tribe was so powerful that they wreaked havoc on the universe with their indomitable power.  As punishment, the Golden Tribe made them serve the other tribes as ""Nodos"" (giant robot-like beings).  Humanity answered the call of the Golden Tribe to follow them into the next galaxy, and they were dubbed the Iron Tribe.  The Silver Tribe does not like this, and they make it their duty to destroy the Iron Tribe.

  The whole series is based around the two tribes fighting, with the bug-like Bronze Tribe continually attacking in swarms.  One of the last surviving Iron Tribe ships is on a mission to find a Nodos to save and protect them.  They come across a young boy, Age, left all alone after the destruction of a world.  The Bronze Tribe attacks, almost annihilating this band of Iron Tribe, when Age transforms into a Nodos and easily destroys the attackers.  Age joins the Iron Tribe, and they go searching for the Golden Tribe.

  There is constant action with the tribes battling it out.  The fighting sequences are long, but not boring.  There is comic relief as Age is in no ways civilized, and the story leaves you wanting more.

  I openly recommend this anime to anyone, especially if you have never watched anime.  It would be a wonderful introduction into the anime world.",1416787200,2,3809,4.535398230088496

3991727,5,B002UOMGW4,"As a fan of good sci-fi, which includes many non, sci-fi- things involved (such as good acting, story and imagination, and the relationships between characters) This show delivers on such a heavy scale it's nearly impossible to explain the sheer Scale of just what goes on in this Truly amazing show in simple words. However, What can be said about it is this - It is rewarding beyond anything I've ever seen if you just invest yourself in the weight of the story. Also, Caitlin Glass gives one of her most incredible performances to date as the lead female in this saga. Accompanied by the incredibly talented J.Tatum and R.

3991729,2,B002UOMGW4,"I happened to watch Heroic Age with a friend from start to finish, and it really isn't that good. To start off on a positive note, the series has excellent animation quality, and the later space battles are a pleasure to watch. The sound track is also very well composed. However, those are the only good things about the series.

The first problem starts from the very beginning of the series with an exposition dump. In storytelling, the purpose of an exposition dump is to lay out the overarching conflict and the reasons for the conflict on the table for everyone to see so that the story can focus in on something smaller. Instead, we get a vague ""this stuff happened"" without any justifiable cause for why that stuff occurred. The plot holes just keep building up as the series stretches onwards and many times characters are treated with more legitimacy than what their actions would dictate. A good comparison would be if an employee at some business proved to be completely incompetent, costing the company millions of dollars, yet his boss keeps promoting him to higher positions of authority. Complicating matters is the obsession almost every character has with the main protagonist, showing generally more care for him even though most of the people involved hardly know the guy.

I could keep going on and on about the plot, but needless to say, it will make anyone who is paying attention to it tear their hair out. The last episodes far outshine the bulk of the series due to everything fitting just right by that point, but it certainly wasn't worth the journey to get there. I cannot recommend this anime at all and I am surprised it ever made it to the states.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alright, so I've come back after cooling my head a little, and if I could I would probably bump my rating back up to 3 stars. Without spoilers, what I can say is that the series does have a solid direction: The human race (the tribe of iron) is nearly wiped out by a more advanced space faring race called ""The Silver Tribe"". The plot involves a human princess seeking to fulfill an ancient prophecy by finding one of the last remaining members of the ""tribe of heroes"" who are giant space robot/monster hybrids. After that is done, the series is about their push to retake their home planet and defeat the silver tribe. The characters, however, fall into one of two characters: those that are borderline one-dimensional, or generic copies of some other character archetype seen in other giant robot anime. At the very least the main protagonist does not conform to the whiny ""I don't want to pilot a mecha"" stereotype, which is a welcome change of pace.

On the downside, the silver tribe, despite being lauded to be as logic driven as the vulcans from star trek, do not act as such through the story. The presence of four other members of the ""tribe of heroes"" indentured to the silver tribe also lead to some head scratching as to how the human race is even still around considering the devastating power these machines possess. And then there are two human princes whose actions are so non-nonsensical that one wonders why the human race hasn't committed a coup d'etat to overthrow the ruling party. Also, the second a giant robot shows up, any space battle will be reduced to a one sided conflict ensuring near if not total obliteration to the other side.

In conclusion, Heroic Age will be liked by those who are looking for giant space monster/robot battles, but not by those who are looking for a title strong in the story department.",1384992000,3,3692,4.918138041733547

I have contacted Funimation about this discrepancy and to date they have yet to answer any of my e-mails, the first of which were sent on the 25th of August.

I personally enjoyed the anime. It could've used a little more development with the plot and the characters but it was definitely worth the watch. The plot is interesting and I loved the characters. They even threw in some guys you just love to hate and could get frustrated at.

It was pretty soft and marshmellowy. Some epic battles but if you like a clear winner and dancing on the enemies grave kind of stuff don't look here. I'm surprised they didn't sing Kumbaya.

The story has a warm and fuzzy ending.  The ending does involve some misty oriental mysticism reminiscent of the ending of Glass Fleet.  The Japanese appreciate this more than we do and we need to accept it.

In this type of story, it it unrealistic to expect much character development.  Age is the best developed and the story is really about him, not Princess D.  The rest of the characters appear and contribute to the story.

The animation is very good.  That is important in a story having so much action.

The only fault that I found was that too much time was devoted to combat between Nardos.  I realize that the Japanese like Mecha and some adjustment must be made for their preferences, but sometimes it seemed that the Mech combat was being stretched out in order to fill out an episode.

3991753,3,B002UOMGW4,"Heroic Age has all the essential elements for a truly epic space opera, but it completely squanders them through bad writing. The animation quality is great, the character and mecha designs are excellent, the music really brings out the emotion in the scenes, but in the end the story is just so disappointing. Almost all of the main characters have practically no development or transformations at all. The silver tribe really offered the most interesting character evolution, but it was too little too late.

A large chunk of the series in the beginning is muddled and boring, as the iron tribe is thrown into one massive scale battle after another without much context or explanation. It wasn't until the two brothers showed up that finally we were given antagonists to hate and a genuine desire to see Princess Dhianeila's team succeed.

Finally, the story also suffers from giving away the ending within the first two episodes; removing whatever little tension there was in the early battles. This is because we are told of the twelve labors handed down by the golden tribe, which basically predetermines that the iron tribe is going to win. Despite all of these problems, the series still manages to be watchable once you get past the first half, as it starts to get just interesting enough to keep you wanting more.

In the end, all I can say is that this is just a decent anime. It's worth one viewing if you're a fan of sci-fi epics and you're itching for a new show to watch.",1346716800,,1485,4.703846153846154

I like my Sci Fi 1. Hard, 2. Epic and 3. Dramatic.

This series was Epic, the fate of humanity is in the balance
This series was Dramatic, maybe too dramatic in fact, it was pretty pretentious at times.

But Hard?  This was hard like a marshmallow.  It was a shame, because they did have some epic battles and technology, but the main plot point revolves around some ""people"" who turn into monsters and bash each other and their enemy fleets to pulp.  It was like watching 2 old guys in a boxing match punch each other in the face for hours on end with no resolution too.  They did a fair job attempting to explain where they came from and why they fought but it falls flat.

It was clean, you can watch this with your kids (though violent for the very young crowd, maybe 11 - 12 and up).
It had an ending, so you don't need to worry about another season that either exists and carries on or will never be made.  The ending didn't thrill me, but they did try to make some sense of it all.
Some of the characters were memorable, but not many and most were wooden.
Its inexpensive so its not a big payout.

If you've got teenagers, and you want them to watch something a bit more mature, but avoid the fan service and gratuitous violence, this is not a bad series, but by the end of the story, I barely cared what happened to the characters at all.",1341446400,4,1354,4.193050193050193

3991763,3,B002UOMGW4,"I wasn't sure whether to chalk the bare bones structure of  of Heroic Age's story (plot, themes, and character development) to a younger target audience, a wish to pay homage to classic mecha shows, or bad writing. I figured, in the first and second cases, the error was on my part for purchasing the anime with the wrong expectations. But after thinking, I decided that, while thematic subject could be excused and even appreciated for a younger target audience or as homage, the character development wasn't that good.

Minor Spoilers:

In what way, exactly? Well, we basically have cast of types; the Man Child Hero, his Mature/Disciplined Soldier Rival/Friend, the White Princess, her Villainous Brothers, the Voluptuous but Talented Female Captain, the gruff and good natured Seasoned Veteran Captain, etc, none of whom deconstruct, exceed, or subvert their roles in any compelling or inventive way (in the manner of more exciting anime like Death Note and Code Geass, or even less dynamic anime like Gundam Wing). The characters are what they are, and they stay that way straight through. Part of this may be because the classic mecha shows had less refined methods of character development than more modern anime (post-Gundam), but when I look at the level of sophistication other media for children have achieved (Pixar, DreamWorks, etc, I have to question whether that is a plausible explanation.

Such character transformations that exist are limited mainly to the antagonists, hegemonic aliens who for the most part can be described as Good-Intentioned Extremists who gradually warm up to the 'compassion' of the human protagonists as an alternative way of administrating an unruly universe. While welcome, it isn't nearly enough to satisfy the interests of a modern audience's accustomed wish for more elaborate psychological explorations.

There are ways to compensate for lack of dramatic interest: the technical aspects of the show (music, including a highly addictive opening theme song, art direction, graphics) are highly polished and may sate the appetites of people who enjoy the sweeping cinematography of space epics. Unfortunately, while I can accept different points of interest besides psychological ones in other medium (in Lord of the Rings, for example, where the setting of Middle Earth and its culture and languages makes up for the lack of psychological complexity in its characters), in a 20-something episode television drama, it is hard to overlook.

In the end, I felt interested enough to watch the series to its conclusion, but not enough to feel as though it had to be part of my collection.",1314230400,5,2629,5.203309692671395

3991766,5,B002UOMGW4,"Heroic Age is an science fiction anime that doesn't appear to have received the publicity that it deserved. In fact, the only way I came across this series was through Amazon Recommendations and the outstanding reviews of my Amazon peers. If you're wondering about this series, its worth taking the chance. Watch the trailer and know it only reveals a fraction of the series itself. Heroic Age is one of the most satisfying anime purchases I've made in months and at 26 episodes, its a complete series.

Pros:
+ Smooth, polished animation that looks great on Blu-ray
+ High quality, top notch voice acting (its really worth listening to the dub, even for sub-only fans)
+ A detailed story provides plenty of backdrop, but leaves many questions
+ Action, subtle romance, and space battles
+ Epic score adds to the high quality feel of the series
+ The final episode provides a sufficient conclusion for most characters

Cons:
- A few middle episodes move slowly due to the lack of action on the part of one of the main characters
- The score is frequently reused over and over so you will hear the same great music multiple times in different episodes
- Don't overthink parts of the storyline, there may be a gap here and there
- Expect lots of crying on the part of the Princess

Heroic Age doesn't explain itself to the viewer, it just sucks them in. Don't expect the series to explain what starways are, how the ships travel at high speed or what's happening. The viewer is given almost as little information as the humans in the series and ultimately, you have many questions until the last several episodes when things come full circle. The best part of this series is that the conclusion was well thought out and almost an entire episode is dedicated to what happens to the characters instead of leaving open giant cliffhangers or having the entire cast die off.

To see human kind as the underdogs is this battle in the cosmos was rather enjoyable and in a way, I was very happy because I have been wanting a sci-fi/action anime series on Blu-ray and I have to admit that ""Heroic Age: The Complete Series"" is probably one of the most satisfying anime TV series that I have seen on Blu-ray thus far.

As for the Blu-ray release, it's hard to recommend the series if one already owns it on DVD based on the fact that there are no special features included and there is no lossless Japanese audio.  But for those who do not own the series on DVD, will enjoy the marginal upgrade for the video compared to its DVD counterpart and a pretty solid English lossless soundtrack.

First nothing beats a professional translation; things that were murky in the first version I saw were crystal in this one.

Second the video is gorgeous.  I was thinking HD was wasted on an abstract medium like anime.  I was wrong, it matters.

Third the audio has impact.  The 5.1 soundtrack is impressive.  My subwoofer kicked-in a lot.  The strong beat really helps with the emotional impact of the scene.  It was like being deaf before.  The score gets a little repetitious, but that could be due to having watched it three times.

Fourth the plot is good.  It is like David Brin's Uplift Saga meets Gundam.

8381396,4,B002UOMGW4,"A good drama and action anime, with mecha, monsters, and a fair balance of soap opera and science fiction. The only thing that stops this from being an instant classic for me is the rather confusing relationship between all the ""tribes"" and the ""conditions"". The story hinges on these ideas enough that they should be clearer-but they aren't. And how the heck did the moron brothers escape arrest, and get back into command?! Still, good designs, Japanese voice acting, emotions, and story keep this series moving well. No fanservice. Solid, with no over the top evil or disturbing images.",1486166400,,589,4.959595959595959
