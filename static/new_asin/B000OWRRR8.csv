8187034,5,B000OWRRR8,"If you've read any of Mark Hatmaker's books or viewed any of his training dvds, you know that his knowledge of Western martial arts (boxing, wrestling, ""no holds barred"" fighting) is nothing short of extraordinary. Clearly, he has dedicated his life to understanding these traditions, training in them, and, fortunately for the rest of us, teaching them. The focus here, as the description indicates, is on using a standard heavy bag to practice grappling techniquessome stand-up but mostly groundwork (hence the title).

Hatmaker's demonstrations of techniques with a training partner are outstanding and he does an excellent job showing how to translate them to a heavy bag. Obviously one cannot replicate exactly the techniques when working with a bag, but the drills he has created are very well thought-out and effective at helping one to learn fundamentals of ground grappling. One point is especially salient: while solo training of this sort does have some limitations compared to partner training, it also has some real advantages: namely by allowing for repeated, full force execution of techniques that are simply too dangerous or damaging in ""live"" training. As with other of Hatmaker's works, this dvd has become an indispensable addition to my martial arts library.",1466380800,3,1279,5.300492610837439
8187035,5,B000OWRRR8,"...I purchased this video so that I could mix-up my standard Jillian Michaels/Bob Harper workout routines. And I'm glad I did! I have two old 100-lb. heavy bags that are ripped at the top, and they are not ""hangable"" anymore. I wanted to utilize them--since I hate the idea of just throwing them away.

I saw this video and decided to check it out. I liked the idea that the bags could be used mostly for floor work (no hanging required), and the simple hip rotation movements could be done if my bags were sewn up and duck-taped really good before attempting.

The instruction on the video was very thorough! He shows how to do the moves on a human being first, so that when you transfer those moves to the bag, the whole exercise-drill has a specific purpose. There is an incredible amount of information in this video and I doubt you could possibly do everything in one session--unless you want to seriously torture yourself.

But if you are in good shape and want to challenge yourself...if you need a change-up from the standard workout fare on the market today....this video is a great alternative. You Tube also posts some of the moves featured in this video, so if you're nervous about doing something this different, you can check out the videos and see what you'll be getting into before you make the purchase.",1302825600,4,1320,4.608510638297872

8187037,5,B000OWRRR8,"If you've spent any time in ju jitsu, you've probably heard of a grappling dummy. They are awesome to train with but are priced astronomically high; I mean like a half ounce of gold high! What is a grappler to do? Well thankfully Mark Hatmaker developed a system of drills one would train with a grappling dummy but has modified them using an inexpensive floorbag, (otherwise known as a boxing heavy bag on the ground). Make no mistake, this is a workout DVD. If you perform these drills in sequence, you will find yourself sucking air, feeling a little nauseous, and your lungs will have that ""frosty"" feeling. It takes a few views to get the routine down. I recommend writing down the routine on a chart to speed your workout up. After a few views you will not need the DVD except for reference. After a month of rolling this series into your workout routine, you will maintain top control easily and instinctively move in and out of top and side control. There are excellent drills for armbars also. Well worth the money and a worthy edition to any grappler's library. Kudos to Mark Hatmaker!",1289088000,7,1095,4.591836734693878
