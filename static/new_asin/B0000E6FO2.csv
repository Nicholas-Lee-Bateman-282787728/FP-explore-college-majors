I contacted him by email with a typical raw beginner question. The reply I got was extremely sarcastic and condescending. He didn't answer the question and didn't reply back when I asked him if I ""offended"" him with my query"", and was more specific with  my question. I received NO REPLY.
Honestly, he has moved on and so should we.

Rock House has been upgrading most of their line of DVD lessons with more polished and interested teachers.

I would seek other, more helpful beginner DVDs as well as look at YouTube and other bass lessons. It would be good to wait until Rock Band comes out with a another Beginner DVD video that has a instructor that has some respect for Bass Guitar beginners and really wants to do a good job. I hope it is soon. There are some great forums out there as well.

Thanks,

8002141,5,B0000E6FO2,"I'm so glad that I ordered this DVD.  I've been playing bass (self-taught) for a while now, and don't have the time for real lessons; so this gives me the confidence that I needed to know what to do on the bass.  It starts off basic and builds upon that foundation.  Don't rush ahead--take your time and you'll be rocking along in no time flat.  If you are looking for a great instructional video, then this is the one for you.",1162684800,11,427,4.234567901234568
