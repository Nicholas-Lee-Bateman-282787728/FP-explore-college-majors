7809695,3,6301160223,"I understand that this is a video from the 90s, but it's supposed to be new. The quality is horrible. I've converted it to DVD, and although it can be used, it looks like a video that has been played a thousand times over.",1388620800,,222,4.068181818181818
7809696,1,6301160223,i bought this tape due to having another VHS tape on AB workout.  This tape really didn't do much of an upper body work out.  Its very low impact and if you looking to break a sweat and really lose weight or tone upper body then you in for a disappointment.  I may have done the exercise three times at most.,1331078400,,308,4.016393442622951
7809697,5,6301160223,"this workout is billed as advanced, and in a way it is, although serious weight lifters will laugh at it. This is a super fast, super high rep, super light weight workout for the upper body. One exerciser does not use weights but instead squeezes and contracts the muscle. Lots of long-lever exercises like the Pilates strong man also require the use of lighter-than-usual weights, and you won't have time to switch back to heavier. I use three pounds but have to drop to two pounds by the time it's over. Many of the exercises remind me of Margaret Richard's Sculpture, except faster and shorter but no less torturous.(In fact, the pace is sort of like Beachbody's  Slim Series, another high rep series.) Other exercises are pulse-type long lever motions like those found in barre, Pilates, or Callanetics style workouts and would compliment those workouts nicely. Standing, kneeling, and floor work is included, and sometimes you squat into a pulsing plie as you move the arms, making the workout a bit more aerobic. Overall, this is certainly an endurance workout sure to fry, proving that you really can get a good workout from lifting Barbie weights.",1280188800,3,1155,4.892857142857143
7809698,5,6301160223,"I really had some fat arms in the past. Arms were number 1 on my list of troubled areas. I did the Firm and Jane Fonda`s workout with weights and other videos that incorporated weights in the routine. I needed a little extra toning on my flabby arms. This is a video that I added to my other videos. It is a great toner for the arms,I didn`t think it would be either. The instructer is very informative about what she is doing and how to do the exercises correctly. It is a 30 minute routine using light hand weights. There are three girls in the video like in all esquire videos. Two of them use one pound weights and one of the girls does not use any weights at all. I use a pair of three pound dumbells for the routine. You will not need to go real heavy on the weights because the exercises used are continuous and a challenge. So do not try to show off with heavy dumbells. This is a great video for beginners,I suggest beginners do not use any weights at first just to get the moves and form correctly. This video has really helped me get rid of flab on my arms. I really enjoyed adding this video to my routine.",1167609600,3,1118,4.13302752293578
