8039809,5,B00067HP6E,"I searched and searched for a ""practice"" ballet video for my 4 year old. This video is fun and instructional. She loves practicing in-between her weekly dance class. I love that she keeps busy and is learning how to follow the instructor while stretching her muscles. Highly recommended. I wish there was more out there in this category of practice dance and instruction for kids.",1293926400,,380,4.861538461538461
8039810,4,B00067HP6E,"I ordered this DVD for my 2 and 4 year old grandson and granddaughter in CA. Their mother said that they love it, especially because it a rather free form format- not a follow the steps direction.",1157068800,,196,4.324324324324325
8039811,5,B00067HP6E,I took alot of time searching for a video that would get my kids moving and appeal to their creative side.  This is the perfect video.  My girls (ages 2 and 4) are on their feet the whole time!  They love watching the other children pretend to be different sea creatures and act out different movements!  I would reccomend this to anyone looking for a video that will get their kids up and moving and encourage their dramamtic play!,1137024000,3,432,4.430379746835443
8039812,5,B00067HP6E,I loved this video!  My 2 year old has watched it many times in the last two weeks and loves to dance along with it.  I don't mind her viewing it often because it gets her moving a bit instead of just staring.  I think it's a wonderful creative movement experience even just as a video.  I wish they would make more of the same type!,1115942400,5,333,4.0
8039813,5,B00067HP6E,"Finally a dance video video that appeals to boys, too.  My twins and their 2 year old sister watch it, dance and sing along, then go and play 'treasure hunt' afterwards.  It's easy to follow along, even for my youngest mover but challenging for the 5 year olds. They love the life size puppets - especially the dancing hermit crab. An imaginative and fun introduction to ballet.",1099008000,4,378,4.626865671641791
