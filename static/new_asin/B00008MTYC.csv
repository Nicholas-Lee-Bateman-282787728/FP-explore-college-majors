1853500,4,B00008MTYC,"Funny, smart, a picture into the era and a great remake of a classic.  The original - The More the Merrier - was wonderful, but this is a great update of that story.  The more I have watched it the better it gets, especially the dialog between Steve (Jim Hutton) and William (Cary Grant).
It does take you back to the 60's and gives you a look at that time, but the humor is timeless.",1200355200,3,384,4.1066666666666665
1853501,4,B00008MTYC,"Cary Grant is known to romance the leading ladies in most of his movies with few exceptions, and this is one of them. This may be appropriate since he was 62 when this movie was made. The twist in the movie is that he sees a younger version of himself in a young American Olympian named Steve Davis (Jim Hutton) whom he meets during the 1964 Olympic Games.

Cary Grant plays William Rutland a charming businessman; during one of his business trips to Tokyo, he persuades a young woman named Christine Easton (Samantha Eggar) to sublet her apartment, when he could not find a place to stay in the city. The two become unwilling roomies because of the gender difference. While the Christine is not too thrilled with the arrangement she tries to adjust with the new situation, but it gets a little more complicated when Rutland sublets his apartment to Steve Davis. Rutland plays cupid on two young roommates in spite of their incompatible personalities, and Christine's engagement to a boring diplomat named Julius Haversack (John Standing). Rutland meddles in the young couple's romantic problems, and goes an extra distance to pretend as a competitor of 20 kilometer walk to talk to Jim during his event, and tries to heal the differences between the young lovers. The best moments of the film are Rutland's walk in his boxer shorts and a T-shirt avoiding the police and the game regulators; and sharing the cramp apartment with the two young people. Rutland makes references to his two earlier movies; Charade and An Affair to Remember by singing the theme songs.

1853502,5,B00008MTYC,"This is one of my all time favorite movies.  I think Cary Grant is at his best in this, his last movie.  He always cracks me up.  The movie is in widescreen and the colors and sound are clear and rich.  It is well worth the money.",1168473600,7,230,3.8297872340425534
1853503,5,B00008MTYC,"Walk, Don't Run was a delightful surprise. It was Cary Grant's last movie, in which he proves that he's not only gorgeous and charming, but also a king of comedy. Whether searching for a pair of elusive pants, playing with an ubiquitous couple of Japanese children, or ""dropping by"" one of the Olympic races, there's no one funnier than him. A very good movie and an unforgettable star.",1162080000,11,386,4.6911764705882355
1853504,4,B00008MTYC,"In 1966, Cary Grant retired from his distinguished 34-year acting career after starring in the lighthearted romantic comedy ""Walk, Don't Run"".  Set in Tokyo, Japan during the 1964 Olympics, Sir William Rutland (Cary Grant, 1904-1986), a very wealthy British industrialist, arrived in Tokyo two days ahead of schedule and the lavish Okura Hotel (where he is supposed to stay) has no rooms available.  In fact, the Olympics have placed a giant ""no vacancy"" sign across the entire city of Tokyo.  Frustrated, William goes to the British Embassy to seek out assistance in locating a room.  There, he is seen by the snobbish & indifferent Julius P. Haversack (John Standing) whose attitude changes towards Sir William upon discovering who Sir William is.  Sir William wanders out of Mr. Haversack's office and finds a bulletin board with a advertisement to share an apartment.  Desperate to have a place to sleep, Sir William grabs the advertisement and travels to its address.  Upon arriving, the woman who rents the apartment, Christine Easton (Samantha Eggar), doesn't want to share her apartment with a man, but is unable to convince Sir William to leave and reluctantly allows him to stay.  The following day, while Sir William is conducting business with a Japanese company, he comes across an American busily taking pictures and making notes about the building's architecture.  The American, Steve Davis (Jim Hutton, 1934-1979), is part of the American Olympic team, but is reluctant to discuss which event he is in.  Also, insufficient room in the Olympics' housing has left Steve homeless, so he immediately latches upon Sir William to stay with him.  Of course, Miss Easton is not particularly happy to discover that Sir William has sublet his part of the apartment, but again very reluctantly lets Steve stay as well.  Of course, this creates even more havoc for everyone to try and use the apartment's single bathroom.  Over the course of the film, it is revealed that Miss Easton is engaged to the unpleasant Mr. Haversack at the British Embassy, but Sir William would like to see the single Steve woo Miss Easton instead.

Other memorable characters in the film include Miss Easton's friend Aiko Kurawa (Miiko Taka), Steve's Russian friend & fellow Olympian Yuri Andreyovitch (Ted Hartley), the dimwitted KGB agent Dmitri (Ben Astar, 1909-1988), Aiko's parents (Teru Shimada, 1905-1988, and Lois Kiuchi) and the young boy & girl that often sit on the stairs inside the apartment building (Craig Matsunaga & Patty Siu).  Fans of ""Star Trek"" will no doubt recognize George Takei playing the police captain.  George Takei is known more for his repeated role as Lt. Hikaru Sulu in the original ""Star Trek"" series from 1966 to 1969 and the first six ""Star Trek"" films between 1979 and 1991.  Memorable scenes in the film include Sir William at the Okura Hotel, Sir William meeting Mr. Haversack, Sir William arriving at Miss Easton's apartment, their first morning together, Steve meeting Miss Easton, the night at the Japanese restaurant (where Sir William proceeds to eat ham & eggs), the boat trip, Aiko's family, the police station, the race and the closing scenes.  Overall, I rate ""Walk, Don't Run"" with 4 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys a fun & lighthearted romantic comedy.",1102204800,54,3314,5.027422303473492
1853524,5,B00008MTYC,"Sir William Rutland (Cary Grant) British industrialist is in town two days early. This is during the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and there is no where to stay. He finds an apartment to sublet from Christine Easton (Samantha Eggar) who posted it not even dreaming that a male would answer her ad. Later Steve Davis (Jim Hutton) an Olympic competitor is also early and sublets from Sir Rutland's sublet. On top of this Christine's fiance works at the British embassy and must maintain a proper background. Now you see the makings of a good comedy.

I learned to make coffee from this movie (a unique proportion of grounds to water) and there are many parallel mysteries as just what sport does Steve Davis compete in?
Being Grants last movie surly did not slow him down and he has those Grant expressions down pat.",1502755200,,804,4.661971830985915

There are no places to stay, anywhere so Cary Grant who had arrived 2 days sooner then his reservation will allow must find a place to stay and answers an ad but the ad is from a young lady and he has to talk his way in and he does, Samantha Eggar lets him stay. Cary in the meantime meets an Olympic athlete with no place to stay, Jim Hutton, and Rents half of his half much to the chagrin of Miss Eggar. What follows are quick quips and one-liners. Cary is particularly good at this. Will a romance bloom and between who or whom? It is just a cute and sweet movie that you will smile about all the time.",1463961600,,714,4.035211267605634

Movie version ""Walk, Don't Run"" is the same idea, yet it's set during the Tokyo World Olympic games.

Samantha Eggar and Jim Hutton also star in this and they are great on screen together, but this is all about Cary Grant.  I won't give the plot away but you have to wait almost the end of the movie before you find out what event Steve Davis (played by Hutton) competes in, as he keeps avoiding saying what it is throughout the movie.

1853722,5,B00008MTYC,"This vintage comedy-romance is great for whiling away a couple of hours, and you'll smile at the end.  That's what comedy movies are for.

It was Cary Grant's last major film role; he was at the age for character parts, but this was no minor part.  He plays a personable, confident (to the point of being pushy), middle-aged British businessman who happens to be in Japan at the time of the 1964 Olympic Summer Games.  The shortage of living space compels him to rent the spare bedroom of a young British woman for a couple of days.  Then he sublets half the bedroom to a blunt young American architect/Olympic competitor, and proceeds to matchmake in a - well, an unsubtle way.

As you watch this, you need to be aware of a few things that may otherwise seem like private jokes you're not in on.  At the time, it was unusual (and apt to raise eyebrows) for unmarried people of the opposite sex to share living quarters.  It was *not* unusual for USSR athletes to be shadowed and spied upon by their police during this cold-war period.  Japanese transistor technology had only recently come up with mini-recorders and other pocket-sized electronic gadgets.  And the sport in which Jim Hutton's character competes - I'm not going to say what it is - was quite new and considered rather, well, strange-looking by the public.  (Cary Grant makes it look even stranger.)

This movie does have a little action, but it's mostly about the character interaction.  The leisurely but well-moving plot (a remake of a 1943 film, by the way) isn't very deep, but it holds together.  The script-writing and the dialogue are quite good.  The trouser scene is remarkable.  The repartee between Cary Grant and Jim Hutton sparkles.  Mr. Grant's character is smooth and near-perfect.  Mr. Hutton's character is brusque and charming.  Samantha Eggar beautifully characterizes the sensitive young woman who is trying hard to be practical.  John Standing is excellent as the officious, self-absorbed wannabe diplomat.  Miko Taka is fine in the minor role of the Japanese friend with the quick wit.  Even the two step-sitting children, who say nothing but see everything, are memorable.

It's not a kiddie movie, but you can watch it with your children and grandchildren, and you'll all enjoy it.  It was a fine way for Mr. Grant to finish a very long and significant career.",1389398400,,2351,4.82

""Walk Don't Run"" is a pleasant remake of ""The More the Merrier"" (1943) starring Jean Arthur, Joel McCrea and Charles Coburn (which is a great film by the way.)  Mr. Grant plays an affable yet slightly devious matchmaker.  The Tokyo Olympics served as a beautiful backdrop for this quirky, romantic comedy.  The gorgeous young couple, played by Samantha Eggar and Jim Hutton, were teasingly fun to watch.  (Will she let go of her routines?  Can he admit to his feelings?)

1853799,4,B00008MTYC,"Even old as he is at this stage in 1966 (he was around 62), it's still weird to see Cary Grant onscreen playing matchmaker instead of playing the field. Still, he accomplishes even his matchmaking role with his usual style and grace, and you get the feeling that he could've stolen Samantha Eggar from under Jim Hutton's nose if he put his mind to it. After all, the man is Cary friggin' Grant. Guy invented debonair.

Mr. Grant plays Sir William Rutland, a happily married gent and industrialist on a business trip to Tokyo, except that he's arrived two days earlier than scheduled and his room reservation doesn't kick in yet. Sir William picked a pretty awful date to show up, his visit coinciding with the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, and there is a horrible housing shortage. Luckily, he gets wind at the embassy of a woman willing to take on a roommate, and it's a never mind that Sir William learns that the woman had intended to let only to fellow women. Sir William being played by Cary Grant, he eventually wears down Christine Easton, his new British ""landlord.""

WALK DON'T RUN made me sad a bit because I knew going in that it was Cary Grant's swan song, the man leaving cinema behind still near the height of his powers. And while WALK DON'T RUN doesn't succeed in all its stabs at levity, it did make me smile in places. Some of the comedy derives from the lovely Christine Easton (Samantha Eggar) being such a precise and super-organized woman. It's a real joy to see that Grant still has masterful control of what he does best, which are those bemused sidelong glances and double takes. He showers these on Christine as she meticulously breaks down the bathroom time table for him. In fact, she literally breaks the morning schedule down to its exact minutes, and a confounded Sir William soon wails: ""What time do I shower? 7:35 or 7:37?"" We're not too surprised when it's revealed that Christine Easton is engaged to an officious embassy official aptly named Julius P. Haversack. And, later on, there's also some fun with mysteriously vanishing trousers.

While out and about Sir William meets and takes a liking to young architect-slash-Olympic athlete Steve Davis (Hutton) who also had flown in two days ahead of schedule and is looking for lodgings. Sir William offers half of his room and board, and maybe he should've consulted with his landlord first, because she ends up livid (but remember this is Cary Grant so she inevitably capitulates). Steve, of course, would have to be inducted into the pinpoint time table regarding bathroom use. There's a vague air of mystery, by the way, in Steve's recurring evasiveness concerning the nature of his Olympics event. He hems and haws for most of the movie, and no wonder. Sir William would later proclaim of Steve's event: ""This is THE most ridiculous race.""

Cary Grant plays the busybody Cupid but, here's the thing, the movie audience is ever aware that it's Cary Grant in the room, even old as he is. And so, Jim Hutton, cast in the romantic role and who is to ""bland"" what Grant is to ""charming,"" stands no chance; he withers under the comparison. Hutton's romance with Samantha Eggar feels rather shallow and convenient. And Hutton and Eggar together can't come up with any bits of humor. Instead laughs come by either thru a combination of Grant and Eggar or Grant and Hutton or Grant with both Eggar and Hutton. There's also a tired bit about a fumbly Russian minder minding a Russian Olympian. It's not very funny.

For Star Trek freaks, George Takei (the original Lt. Sulu) has a cameo late in the movie as a police captain who determines whether our central characters are, in fact, spies.

WALK DON'T RUN is a remake of George Steven's sublime THE MORE THE MERRIER - and if you haven't seen that one, you are seriously missing out on a classic wartime romantic comedy. WALK DON'T RUN, sadly, doesn't live up to the original picture. Equal parts of blame must go to the rather flat screenplay and Jim Hutton who is to ""bland"" what Gran- oh, never mind. Just know that Cary Grant effortlessly carries the movie, convincing me to rate WALK DON'T RUN 3.5 out of 5 stars.",1279497600,5,4140,4.672153635116598

Cary Grant is wonderful as the matchmaker which is normally not his main role. Plus I'm a big fan of vintage movies filmed abroad showing us a glimpse of culture and daily life.  Highly recommend it if you enjoy any of the three stars!!",1522022400,,373,4.3
7985648,5,B00008MTYC,"In Cary Grant's last film he plays a very senior businessman visiting Tokyo on a business trip.  He arrives early, and his hotel has no room for him until the day he has reserved because of the crowds drawn to the Summer OIympics.  A note posted at his embassy leads him to a room being sub-let by a young woman, and he moves in, but he's not the only one!  Classic Cary Grant humor, a charming love story, and the Summer Olympics in Tokyo combine to make this movie a lot of fun!  The copy was clear, and the service was as good as expected.",1517270400,,542,4.133333333333334
7985649,5,B00008MTYC,So much fun watching Cary Grant smile and charm his way through this classic! He plays a happily married fellow that loves love.,1510185600,,128,4.608695652173913

7985652,5,B00008MTYC,"this is a remake of ""the More the Merrier"" with Jean Arthur. It is a very good one and adds some twist on the same funny situations as well as adding a few new ones. A very good ""worth your while"" movie. This is the second time I've watched this one and I have seen the other at least 3 times.",1504742400,,293,3.819672131147541
7985653,4,B00008MTYC,"Fun 1960s rom-com with Cary Grant playing matchmaker for an American athlete who falls in love with a British woman in Tokyo. The movie is set during the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and it's as terrific for the views of Japan of the era as it is for its gentle, somewhat silly love story.",1503964800,,280,4.30188679245283
7985654,5,B00008MTYC,"I LOVE this movie! It has lots of hyperbolic, farcical and dry humor. Also you get to see parts of Japan from the 60s and a peak at the Olympic games that they had there. This movie is quite clean, even my very prudish great Auntie liked it and she thought Toy Story 3 was unbelievably inappropriate for its risque comments and actions.",1503187200,,336,4.349206349206349
