1348761,5,B00004T1JI,"This is a western horror film. It consists of three stories strung together. Fans of Bruce Dern will not be disappointed as he is at his craziest best. The acting is excellent and some of the other characters in this movie are as strange as Dern. My mom loves this film and I really like it, also.",1261699200,2,297,4.228070175438597
1348762,5,B00004T1JI,I enjoy seeing Bruce Dern and he plays his part well in this movie.  A bit of horror/supernatural too.  It also stars Helen Hunt and Mariel Hemingway and consists of several stories in one.  Dern plays a bounty hunter in the Old West.,1249344000,2,234,4.395348837209302
1348763,5,B00004T1JI,"Bruce Dern is awesome in this movie as the bleak, witty bounty hunter with a dry sense of humor. The story is narrated by none other than Barston, the Bounty-man himself, expertly played by Dern. The tale follows the adventures of the Bounty-man as he hunts down Red Roundtree the `prize' for a reward of $5,000 cash dead or alive. You learn early on that the only way the Bounty-man ever brings `em in is... Dead.  And that Sharps .45-70 Buffalo gun insures that! The entire cast is very credible in their respective roles:  Dylan McDermott as the `running gun' who has one last chance for love. Blossom is very credibly played by the most attractive Ms. Helen Hunt. And the very beautiful Mariel Hemmingway plays the `suffer-in-silence' frontier wife who proves to be loyal, courageous and quite deadly with a six-gun or rifle. The entire movie is, believe-it-or-not, a series of short-stories coherently strung together and weaves a very entertaining and dark tale. What I liked best about this movie is that the entire cast is very believable making the viewer forget that it never snows in Laredo, the part of Texas where the movie is supposed to take place!",1244678400,3,1163,4.781094527363184
1348764,5,B00004T1JI,"If you like westerns, and you like tales from the crypt, this movie is for you. Three tales held together by a common character, and a corpse that won't stay down! this movie is the best!",1240790400,2,187,4.222222222222222
1348765,4,B00004T1JI,"Provocative to say the least. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and bought the DVD to always have it on hand. In this made for TV film, representing a compilation of three short stories, Bruce Dern was exceptional in his role as a bounty hunter. It depicts aspects of bounty hunting ranging from the thrill, to the harsh reality to even the comedic. Although many people did not like the style in which the film was cut, I found its unexpected twists and turns along with its overall mystique very entertaining. The music is very compelling and ties the film together nicely. If you like ""high pride"" Westerns, this is a must see.",992044800,9,628,4.616071428571429
1348766,4,B00004T1JI,"and this one ranks right up there. The back of the tape describes it as a ""surreal western"" and that's about right. It includes many characters that die but not really, some unique hallucinations, and narrations that are either creepy or funny depending on your interpretation. My dad bought this one off of a discount rack for $6, thinking it was a normal western. It's really a horror movie, and a weird one at that. My favorite movies are the strange sick ones, so I liked it very much. If you have similar taste, you'll definitely like this one. To classify it as a Western is really ridiculous. It's a few short creepy stories tied in together by one common character, and the fact that it takes place in the old West seems almost incidental. ""Normal"" people probably wouldn't like this one, and when my parents saw it, they said they couldn't believe that Helen Hunt, Dylan McDermott, and Mariel Hemingway would ever be in it.",979430400,10,932,4.620481927710843

This is one Damn good western. What makes it so good is how This movie vividly portrays the difficult fronteer life in the dreaded, ""western Badlands"" in the late 1870s. There are three, eerie, ghost-like western tales weaved into one story and Bruce Dern portrays the ""sinister"" bounty man to a Tee! Plenty of action and suspense. The ending will leave you stunned and you will have to say, ""What the F@#%K!"" This movie is a must see.",1293062400,3,586,5.988095238095238

7922177,4,B00004T1JI,"Into the Badlands is a collection of three fantasies that occur in the old wild west. By fantasies, I mean things that could not happen. The 1991 film is based on three short stories that are loosely held together in the film by Bruce Dern, playing a bounty hunter, telling the stories. One is about a wanted man who is being pursued by a lawman for having killed his brother. He has a chance to get away, but stops when he sees a beautiful woman with whom he wants to have sex. The second tale is about a woman visiting a disturbed woman who is deadly afraid of wolves and hears them when the wolves are not present. The third concerns a bounty hunter who kills a wanted man with a bounty of $5,000 and the difficulties he has in bringing in the dead man to town to collect the money. Viewers wanting a film about reality will not like the film, but those comfortable with fantasy will like it a lot.",1494892800,,901,4.244186046511628
