6859434,1,B00Q7F5IMM,"The fact that this is in GERMAN should have been noted prominently on the description, not buried in the small print at the bottom.  I am pissed to spend this much money, wait this long and then get a stack of un-usable product.  I feel deceived and used.  I guess I learned my lesson, but I have a disappointed son to deal with now.",1429488000,,333,4.171875

6859436,1,B00Q7F5IMM,"Its language is German.  Should have checked the language type, but did not.  I would like to think given all of the technology that Amazon uses to parse my order data to send me e-mails and suggest other products to order, they could come up with something that says ""Hey, you have never order a German speaking CD before.  Do you really want this.""  This would be much more useful than all the e-mails I get trying to sell me something.",1386547200,4,438,4.37037037037037

6859439,1,B00Q7F5IMM,"This one star is for the seller, not the DVD. The dvd was ordered then I found out due to the children's parent's religion, they were not allowed to watch or read any type of Super Hero type materials. I do not have a printer to print a return label.....I have no car.....I am on oxygen....yet they will not help, nor will Amazon. I am stuck with this video I will either trash or donate......do not care for this seller or Amazon not helping in this matter.",1483574400,,458,4.275862068965517

6859451,4,B00Q7F5IMM,Yes Light Speed Rescue is boring mostly. The cast trieds hard. Ranger fights are good. Zords are lame an battles with them seem un-needed. Zord battles in most seasons Rock though. Villians are mediocer at best. TITANIUM Ranger was cool wish he was alone with better monsters to fight.,1446681600,,285,4.836734693877551

6859456,5,B00Q7F5IMM,"Another great season of Power Rangers, this time the rangers come back to Earth and a government organization creates new powers and choose 5 people to become Power Rangers. This experimented with a lot of new ideas such as Rangers being known public figures and also the new Titanium Ranger. I rediscovered just how good this season was when the DVD came.out. I will admit the villains are not the best and after the Titanium Ranger saga the show does lack a little bit in story and settles into a lot.of filler episodes. But the positives far outweigh the negatives. Great season to get.",1433721600,5,589,4.673076923076923

8690670,5,B00Q7F5IMM,"Power Rangers Lightspeed is one of my all time favorite Power Rangers seasons. The Rangers did not get their powers from aliens or mystical sources, but they developed their own technology. This season was adapted from a Super Sentai season in Japan named KyuKyu Sentai GoGo V. In this season, an ancient race of demons who were lead by Queen Bashneera were accidentally released and they want to destroy Mariner Bay to restore their palace and rule humanity. An government named Lightspeed Rescue who was leaded by Captain Mitchell and he recruited 5 people including his daughter who they had experience in emergency scuba diving/aquatic studying, aerial stunts, mountain climbing, and fire fighting to combat the cruel demons with their own fully development technology and rescue Mariner Bay. For the first time in Power Rangers history, this season developed their own sixth Ranger instead of adapting from the Super Sentai season, the Titanium Ranger. I gave this season a five star rating.",1494547200,,996,5.154320987654321
