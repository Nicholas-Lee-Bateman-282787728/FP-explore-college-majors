208503,5,630014738X,This is a great thriller & one of my husband's favorites.,1181174400,,57,4.2727272727272725
208504,5,630014738X,"When I wrote this review they had a different photo of the DVD depicting a female with her midriff showing but mine was just George and the dolphins on the right and a very slim picture of a private airplane in flight, and guys shooting into the water and a boat explosion below that on the left (hard to really tell what they were unless you saw the movie). Now it is the same one.  I had checked by putting in the UPC code and this came up.  Mine has a copyright date of 2005 instead of 2006, though, and mine has the extra features: Interviews with screenwriter Buck Henry and co-stars Leslie Charleson and Edward Herrman, The World's Most Amazing Dolphin Trivia Gallery and Dolphin Bios.  I think the features are probably in the DVD on this page too - just not listed here. I thought I had to purchase the one with the ""sexier"" front cover but received the more modest one -- I didn't buy it from Amazon.

I have loved this movie for years.  They used to advertise this movie in the 80's on KBHK-TV Ch 44 San Francisco, CA, with the music from Saint-Saens Aquarium but that music is not in the movie / soundtrack.",1168128000,3,1118,4.304761904761905
208505,5,630014738X,"I guess you could say I am a person who likes films that says what if..This one is that a person can teach a dolphin to talk in human language.  It is a touching, wonderful, interesting story, about mankind in all its goodness and other full of greed and explotation of anything to make a the almighty buck.",1145577600,3,307,4.293103448275862
208506,5,630014738X,This movie is one of my all time favorites.  George C. Scott plays an obsessed director of an aquatic facility which trains dolphins to communicate with humans.  It has a good story line and action scenes(for the 70's) right up until the heartwrenching end.  This is one of those movies you can't stop thinking about long after you've viewed it.,1140220800,5,345,4.716666666666667
208507,5,630014738X,Hard to imagine George C. Scott traded in his war medals as George Patton for scuba gear in this 1973 effort. He delivers in this action thriller as a scientist communicating with dolphins. Trish Van Devere also delivered a good performance. This movie is a sleeper but there is plenty of action galore!,1133740800,2,303,4.735849056603773
208508,4,630014738X,"Three things make this movie great. The directing by Mike Nichols, the writing by Buck Henry, and the acting by George C. Scott. The soundtrack is also marvelous. The whole cast turns in excellent preformances. Remotely like the novel, it tells an espionage story that seems believable. Especially if you know that the story isn't to far from the truth of dolphin research by the private sector and the military.

When Scott does bottle nosed dolphin research he avoids as much publicity as possible. It his intent to further the communication between dolphins and humans without any outside intervention. When his accomplishments reach a level that would allow them to be exploited, the anonimity he once enjoyed becomes a thing of the past.

When his dolphins are kidnapped he must figure out if it is his own government or a foreign power that has done it and why. With the assistance of a mercenary he realizes the terrible plot that could topple a goverment. Plenty here for fans of dolphins and action fans alike. Some trivia questions and interviews with Buck Henry, Leslie Charleson, and Edward Herrmann make up the extras. Great quality DVD considering the age of the movie.",1111536000,3,1183,4.91
208509,3,630014738X,"The Day of the Dolphin was savaged by critics when it was released. They saw the film as nonsense that made an important issue trivial. While it isn't a perfect film, the adaption by Mike Nichols and Buck Henry (Catch 22) is an entertaining adaption of the popular novel. At one time it showed up fairly frequently on network television but has been forgotten over the years. In some respects, Dolphin is a far more successful film adaption than Nichols' and Henry's film version of Catch 22. They were trying to turn a popular satirical novel turned cultural icon into an entertaining film satire. Many fans of the novel were disappointed and critics were, at times, less than kind to it. Here at least the two were working with a lesser novel and there wasn't as much baggage to go with it.
George C. Scott gives a passionate performance. In fact, one thing that you'll note about Scott is whether or not he appeared in trash (The List of Adrian Messenger) or treasure (Patton), his performance is alwasys powerful and committed. Trish Van DeVere also gives a strong performance. She was always underrated as an actress because 1) She was married to Scott and 2)she was always in his shadow. Her performance helps ground what was at the time a farfetched scenerio in reality.
Buck Henry's intelligent screenplay does have some narrative problems but, on the whole, he cleans up the novel's unbelievable plot and jumpy narrative. His screenplay is crisp, clean and his characters strong. An interview with Henry is provided as an extra and his comments demonstrate that he doesn't hold his work on the film in very high regard. It's a pity as he does wonders with the material.
Nichols always straddled the fence between being an actor's director and a film director. As in his past efforts, this pays off handsomely. His work with Scott and the strong supporting cast (including the marvelous Fritz Weaver, Paul Sorvino in one of his early film roles, Edward Herrmann among many other fine character actors)shines.
The plot is fairly straight forward; Scott plays a scientist that has been able to teach Dolphins English and train them to do a number of compliated tasks. He's unaware, though, that the organization funding his efforts has plans to use his research in an assassination attempt on a highly placed political figure. Given what we've learned about the CIA and other organizations over the past decade, it's plot isn't so far fetched. After all, it's certainly more believable than using a powder to make Castro's beard fall out so as to undermine his political power.
The superior DVD transfer surprised me given the age of the film. Virtually free of all analog artifacts, this enhanced transfers looks marvelous. It's a pity that Nichols couldn't provide a director's commentary (or Buck Henry for that matter). Since Scott is gone, it would have been fascinating to get Nichols' take on the film and the performances. While is isn't a 5 star film, it's an engrossing and enjoyable bit of entertainment with a cautionary tale at its core.",1059609600,52,3056,4.85632183908046
208510,4,630014738X,"THE DAY OF THE DOLPHIN (Home Vision Entertainment), released thirty years ago, is as timely as ever. Recent reports of dolphins as underwater spies in the Middle Eastern waters mirrors the plot.  George C. Scott is a scientist who teaches dolphins to speak, only to discover them kidnapped in a government conspiracy.  Directed by Mike Nichols from Robert Merle's novel, this beautiful-looking, entertaining, adventure-thriller reflects the ground-breaking dolphin research of Dr. John Lily. Cool interview with writer Buck Henry. Great family film.  Recommended.",1059436800,4,563,5.759036144578313
208512,5,630014738X,"This is one of my all-time favorite films.  George C Scott is super.  Scenery is magnificent, and it can be a tear-jerker at times.  A must for anyone who lives by the sea and loves dolphins.",1430179200,2,191,4.25

208516,2,630014738X,"Bad, ridiculous, boring, and very 70s. It's slow and nearly plotless in that dull way that 70s movies could be. Also hideously insensitive and stupid in the interspecies department, also in a very 70s way. Hard to believe Buck Henry wrote the dopey script. The only high points are the unintentionally funny moments, like the immortal ""Fa love Pa!"" A low point for Nichols, Scott, Henry, and dolphins.",1404691200,,401,4.911764705882353

208519,4,630014738X,"I was in Maui when I saw this movie so I was in a marine mood.  Also I work with fish and greatly admire dolphins. This movie as I saw it was very good at the beginning.  The lecture was interesting though I sensed the secret aspect of the Doc's work.  Later that day George C. Scott and Alpha the dolphin have an underwater display of affection that nearly breaks the species barrier.  This along with a heart moving score make it easily the best scene in the movie.  Also the tape recorded session was extremely good.  It was chilling to think a dolphin could talk. Hey, let yourself go! Who said imagination is more important than knowledge?

When the government steps in to use the dolphins to kill as attack marine mammals then the movie goes into a slump.  It begins to deal with betrayal, murder, limited spy foolishness, an explosions.  Hence a good in depth drama turns to a weak thriller.  One more thing, In all this research no human learns a word of the dolphin's language.  Try the opposite and see how hard it is.  And give this movie a try. Its pretty good and it's not at all like Flipper. GJ",1400716800,3,1109,4.35609756097561
208520,5,630014738X,I have always loved George C. Scott and Dolphins!  Put them together and you have a great movie!  This movie has been close to my heart since the very first time I saw it in the theater.  It is a very realistic portrayal of what animals may be capable of!,1399334400,2,255,4.06

208527,4,630014738X,"I've always enjoyed the varied works of George C. Scott, and this was no exception.  It carries a good story line, with some mystery that even kept my 13 year old interested.",1374364800,,174,4.4375
208528,5,630014738X,"This was a later try at science fiction using a dolphin and George C. Scott with his baby wife Trish Van De Veer.  I believe that George C. Scott is almost always a riveting actor.  It must be his serious demeanor.  But I was hooked.  I couldn't resist the idea that man could have a real relationship with a dolphin.  They are so smart and they seem to be gentle.  I don't know it that is really true, but it seems to be.  When I discovered what  the government was doing with them,  I was so angry.  What a perversion of something so soft  and gentle and so smart.",1368144000,4,566,4.10091743119266
208529,5,630014738X,"The island and ocean scenes were beautifully filmed in the bahamas but are indistinguishable from the Florida keys I visited many times while growing up in south Florida back in the late 1940s and 50s. The transfer to dvd is excellent and comparable to movie quality when the movie came out. As usual, George C Scott is a presence. The supporting cast is excellent with Edward Herrman and Paul Sorvino showing their obvious talent early in their careers. The extra features with interviews of several cast members (not including Scott) and the writer are worth the price of the disc alone. Highly recommended.",1363478400,,609,4.922330097087379

208543,5,630014738X,I bought this movie as a gift for someone and she loved it.  She had never seen the movie before now.  The film is still quite entertaining after all these years,1318809600,,161,4.161290322580645
208544,5,630014738X,"I first saw this film when I was about ten or so (I'm 47, so quit trying to figure that out) and fell in love with the thing.  I also fell in love with George C. Scott and dolphins, never forgetting how much I cried at the end.  This movie stuck with me all my life so much so that I worked hard enough to garner two one-month opportunities to actually work with dolphins at a local aquarium.  During the second time, I was given the task of trying to rehab/save the life of a Commerson's dolphin (their coloring is just like Orca whales!) that had been intercepted during an illegal flight to Japan. There had been two of them, but the male died almost immediately due to the horrid conditions they were enduring during the shipping.  The female survived for a while and routinely ate what I fed her; I think she felt unthreatened by me because I was about her size (I was 14 at the time) and didn't try too hard to get in her face.  She eventually allowed me to touch her, rub her belly and stroke her poor, horribly bent tail (caused by her being packed into a wooden crate too small for her).  When my time was up, I had to leave and she died not long after.  I often wonder if I had been permitted to stay on if she would have survived.
Nevertheless, the only reason I fought for and won the opportunity at all was because of the passion for cetaceans that this movie ignited in me at the age of ten. This amazing movies rather proves that these amazing creatures are at least as intelligent as we are, if not more-so.  This film certainly isn't 'Flipper' or even remotely a feel-good type movie.  It is realistic in the sense that the government loves to meddle where they don't belong, though it truly does invoke compassion for these mammals of the sea.
You could also read ""So Long and Thanks for All the Fish"" and that, too will convince you dolphins are our mental superiors...",1316131200,10,1888,4.3107344632768365
208545,4,630014738X,"good family movie (age 10+), good acting, relevant for these times too, keeps you suspense,the dolphins are beautiful to watch.",1273881600,,127,5.4
208546,5,630014738X,"This is a sneaky good thriller I've loved a long time. Do dolphins make fun subjects? According to this movie you bet!

Being a scientist on your own can be tedious. Tied to other people's money you have obligations to the foundation that pays your bills. If it's not charity that gets you financed then what interest does the organization have in your research?

We start with a man's dedication to his scientific background. Dr. Jake Terrel played by George C. Scott (great casting there). He's out on an island with his research center studying dolphins. Its leading edge research so he's a little close mouthed about his results. The foundation that supports his work has a little request. It's to let a journalist come out & do a story on him & his work.

So begins our intro to Curtis Mahoney played by Paul Sorvino (yes Law & Order), Jake's wife played by Trish Van Devere. You know she won't get any awards for this role but no one could have done any better, really great casting here. Oh yes, Lets not forget the lead star of the show dolphins named Alpha & Beta.

This is a mystery & a thriller that's well done but I don't want to use ""spoilers"" in this review. The show is based on what dolphins are capable of & also what humans are capable of. It's a great evening at the movies.",1266796800,,1294,4.401673640167364
208547,1,630014738X,"I'm wonder if the movie other people were reviewing was the same Day of the Dolphin that I just watched.

208548,5,630014738X,"I remember seeing this movie when it came out and being absolutely captivated by it.  I was surprised that it still holds up after all these years.  It has everything that an animal lover would love; talking dolphins (admit it, you always knew they were smart), and enough suspense and drama to keep you captivated; evil plots to involve the innocent dolphins and utilizing their love for their ""Pa"" (George C. Scott) and each other to mastermind an evil plot to assassinate heads of state.  I loved the trivia and behind the scenes facts and especially loved the fact that Buck and Ginger (""Fa"" and ""Be"" in the movie) escaped/ran away immediately after filming...they just swam off and never came back!  Definitely an ""oldie-but-goodie"" and worth every penny!",1243555200,4,760,4.9140625
208549,5,630014738X,"Throughout the motion picture business there is many a thespian who truly believes in their role. Some more than others and is why a few become exceptional. The original script called "" The Day of The Dolphin "" was delivered to several actors, prior to the film's inception. When the principal actor read the interesting dialog between himself and his subject called Alpha, he was not only intrigued, but anxious to begin. The story centers around a Research Scientist named Dr. Jake Terrell (George C. Scott) and his wife Maggie. (Trish Van Devere) Their secret island project concerns a special Dolphin, whom they have raised since birth. In an amazing feat of Phonetic science, laboring on the cutting edge and years of patience instruction, they have taught their unique Dolphin to speak English. However, their financial benefactors are not men with lofty ideals like Dr. Terrell or his staff. Indeed their primary goal is to use the amazing oceanic mammal to swim underwater undetected to a secured location where the President of the U.S. is vacationing and eliminate the Chief Executive. Although it's Harold DeMilo (Fritz Weaver) the C.E.O. of the funding institute who plans on subverting Dr. Terrell's innovative project, it's a strange, mysterious and uninvited visitor, Curtis Mahoney (Paul Sorvino) whom they suspect is behind the theft of their special Dolphin and a midnight murder. Trust is not inherent between the characters, indeed the audience is in for a surprise or two. However it's this very element which gives the film it's dramatic texture. The cast is incredible and delivers a dynamite performance which as a result allows this film to become a Classic. Excellent movie. ****",1240531200,4,1705,5.114695340501792

What would happen if some evil elements were able to get their hands on the dolphins and command them to do diabolical deeds on seacraft?  Submarines, Presidential Yachts, etc.  At any moment the dophins' deeds could become suicide missions and of course the dolphins would be unaware.
