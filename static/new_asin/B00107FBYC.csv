3048276,5,B00107FBYC,"I just received this a couple of days ago,and played it on my big screen. It's beautiful. You have the option of music or natural ocean sounds. The different scenes change every few minutes,so I am not worrying about burn-in...if I am supposed to be worried about it.
There are 11 different scenes to choose from,and a couple of them are really,really pretty. Well,all of them are,but two stand out for me.
This product does what it says it does,and it does it nicely. The fish are mesmerizing.",1234051200,12,494,4.625
3048277,4,B00107FBYC,"The DVD gives you 3 options at the beginning, one with relaxing music, one with natural sounds, and a loop of scene 1.  The natural sounds are supposed to resemble the bubbling of a fish tank, but they sound fake and are horrible.  The relaxing music is great, so plan on either listening to that or muting the TV.",1227225600,5,314,4.305084745762712
3048278,5,B00107FBYC,"I purchased this video for my parents who recently purchased a 54"" HDTV.  They love the video!  It's often on in the background during dinner or socials at their house.  They said a landscaper who was inside talking to them, thought it was an actual aquarium.  (Though in fairness to the guy, their hdtv sits on a custom cabinet tucked into a shallow custom alcove.)  Great gift!",1219363200,14,379,4.597014925373134
3048279,5,B00107FBYC,Great DVD for a background screen. Much better than the first one. The colors are more vibrant and interesting. I use it in my clothing store and I really love it. I highly recommend it.,1212192000,11,186,4.3428571428571425

and colorful reef coral
Hoping to enjoy it while meditating. This DVD was very dissapointing,

3048282,5,B00107FBYC,"I bought this for a friend, we put in the DVD and just sat there and watched the fish swim and the music was perfect.  She said it is on her TV almost all the time.  It is just what she wanted without having to clean it.",1260835200,6,220,3.6595744680851063
3048283,5,B00107FBYC,I love aquariums but am not fond of the upkeep they require.  This is an acceptable substitute and makes a nice background on your tv when you are entertaining.  I enjoy running it during the day and seeing it when I pass through the family room.  Colors are vivid and fish are fairly active so your eye is entertained.  I purchased one for an adult child who longs for a real aquarium but whose travel schedule doesn't allow for that at this time.  It was a fun gift that made him smile and that he now enjoys.,1256515200,5,511,4.22680412371134

3048287,3,B00107FBYC,"I purchased this after all the reviews raved about how wonderful the plasmaquarium looks, with one person actually going as far as saying that someone thought it was an actual aquarium.  Let me assure you, this DVD does not even come close to reaching these levels of quality.  Let me explain why:

The Bad:

Video quality is DVD quality.  This was a deal breaker for me and I'm sure it will be for many others.  I've been looking for a high def quality aquarium for my Samsung PN63A650 (which is a top of the line plasma at the time of writing) and I am not happy at all.  Everything is not as crisp as it should be for HD.

Sound quality is also just OK.  I would recommend listening to the relaxing music, as the 'natural sounds' are annoying after a while.

The Good:

Everything else.  The scenes are wonderful, with a large variety of fish and pleasing aquatic plant life.  There are an ample amount of scenes which change just as you start getting bored with them.

So, if you are looking for an HD quality plasmaquarium, look elsewhere as you will not be satisfied.  Unfortunately, most reviews of other similar products show that there really isn't one out there so it could involve some waiting.  I'm still searching.

7/22/09:  I am fairly satisfied with the ""Marine Aquarium"" blu-ray image quality, but again it doesn't quite have the same feel as plasmaquarium.",1241049600,19,1374,4.584362139917696
3048288,5,B00107FBYC,"I have a Pioneer Elite Plasma TV and ""Plasma Windows"" has a great quality product that makes the screen come alive.  I already own Plasmaquarium Vol. 1 and love it, so I purchased Vol. 2 ""The Coral Reef.""  It's absolutely beautiful with color and crisp detail and  hugely relaxing and mesmerizing to watch for hours.  I feel like I have gone scuba diving (without the danger of being eaten by sharks) and am seeing the underwater world directly in front of me.  My guests love watching it on the 50"" screen and you can either play your own music with it or select the natural/music/or quiet modes on the DVD.  Great for background visual and audio effects without the work and upkeep of a real aquarium and a great way to make your TV not look like a TV!  I recommend this highly for anyone who enjoys the peace and serenity of watching beautiful fish swimming among the coral.",1239926400,6,877,4.477987421383648
3048289,5,B00107FBYC,"We were looking for an underwater ocean DVD with lots of fish, and the Coral Reef Plasmaquarium 2 DVD fit the bill. We had purchased the original Plasmaquarium DVD a few years ago and the Plasmaquarium 2 DVD was the perfect sequel.",1237680000,2,231,4.523809523809524
3048290,4,B00107FBYC,"I read the reviews for the first and second Plasmaquarium CDs. I bought this one and it's okay (I'm a tough critic).
The fish seem too far away, or at least it would be nice to have them come way up to the camera once in a while, like they come up to the glass and stare at you in a fish tank.  They are also zipping around to fast for me in the first few scenes.  It makes me uptight.  I find that those Sunrise Earth shows have a strong relaxing effect on me... so I know it's possible.  I think the aquarium CD's are hard to get just right.  Also, this one is not a smaller fish tank, it may be the ocean.",1237507200,5,608,3.832
