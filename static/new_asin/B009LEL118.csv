8542850,4,B009LEL118,"I really love ""ethnic operas"", by which I mean works from a specific region, written in that language, using their folk idioms, and stories and characters.  In this group I include Czech opera, Polish opera (Moniuzcko), Mussorgsky, Finnish opera (recent), and the Spanish zarzuelas.  The local color, language, characters, and musical language of each of these really catch my attention.

This work by Manuel Penella is certainly a fine one.  I have seen it called an opera, an operetta, and a zarzuela (a Spanish form of opera with spoken dialogue, much like the French opera comique).  No matter.  It doesn't matter what you call it, just enjoy the pleasure of the music.

This dvd is from a performance in Los Angeles made for PBS television, and it is very good.  Placido Domingo (who apparently performed one of children's roles when he was about 8), is terrific as the matador ""El Macareno"" (NOT the dance) in love with Solea.  She loves him back.

BUT into the mix enters ""El Gato Montes"" (the Wildcat) who has loved Solea from childhood and is in hiding after killing a man to avenge her honor.  It appears she loves him equally, despite her apparent love for the matador.  Thus, the challenge is thrown down between the men, but Solea stops the duel.  Montes then avers that the matador will be killed in the bullfight arena, or by himself afterwards (and this has been foretold by a gypsy fortuneteller earlier in the opera.  In Act 2, Macareno is killed by a bull.  The final scene is of Solea's funeral as she has died of a broken heart, and Montes pronounces that he can't live without her and has his compatriot shoot him, with him dying at the foot of her funeral bier.  (The last scene really surprised me, as I was expecting a battle between the men.)

The music is delightful, tuneful, Spanish, with a strong Puccini influence.  It is mostly arias and duets, with a few brief choruses and even some dancing.  Placido is terrific as the Spanish bullfighter, and Veronica Villarroel is excellent as Solea.  Justino Diaz hits just the right tone as Montes- both menacing and romantic (he really isn't a villain).

I strongly recommend this dvd.  Hopefully it will be re-issued so it can be purchased at a reasonable price.  It's a wonderful show.  And I love that Spanish flavored music.  Charming.",1367712000,2,2313,4.7225
