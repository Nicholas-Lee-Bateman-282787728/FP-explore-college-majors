7793664,4,0962956945,"This classic VHS teaching by Pastor and Healing Evangelist - Benny Hinn, focuses on GOD'S TIMELESS COVENANT WITH MAN. That being: The Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:1-17 KJV). ""When I (Moses) was gone up into the Mount to receive the Tablets of Stone, even the Tablets of the Covenant which the Lord made with you, then I abode in the Mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water (spiritual fast). AND THE LORD delivered unto me (Moses) two Tablets of Stone written with the Finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the Lord spoke with you in the Mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly. And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that THE LORD gave me the two Tablets of Stone, even the Tablets of the Covenant"" (Deuteronomy 9:9-11 KJV). So, whether you're a Christian or not, either directly or indirectly the majority of secular laws are predicated on the 10 Rules, that just happened to come from a Holy God. And, as you will clearly see, that there is no such thing, as: Separation of Church and State. Why? Because again, ""...He (the Lord) gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with Him (the Lord) upon Mount Sinai, two Tablets of Testimony, Tablets of Stone, written with the Finger of God"" (Exodus 31:18 KJV). So, just what are the Ten Commandments? Glad you asked! If you'll allow me to quote - chapter and verse from the Holy Bible, the Ten Commandments and the order in which they were given and written down, by a God of Infinite and Timeless Wisdom. 'And God spake all these words, saying, ""I AM the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the House of Bondage. THOU SHALT HAVE NO OTHER GODS BEFORE ME (v. 3); THOU SHALT NOT MAKE UNTO THEE ANY GRAVEN IMAGE (v. 4), or any likeness of any thing that is in Heaven above, or that is in the Earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity (sins) of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate Me; And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love Me, and keep MY COMMANDMENTS (and not those of man or Moses). THOU SHALT NOT TAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD IN VAIN (v. 7); for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His Name in vain. REMEMBER THE SABBATH DAY, TO KEEP IT HOLY (v. 8). Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: For in six days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath Day, and hallowed (blessed) it. HONOUR THY FATHER AND THY MOTHER (v. 12): that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. THOU SHALT NOT KILL (v. 13). THOU SHALT NOT COMMIT ADULTERY (v. 14). THOU SHALT NOT STEAL (v. 15). THOU SHALT NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS AGAINST THY NEIGHBOR (v. 16). THOU SHALT NOT COVET (v. 17) thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbor's'"" (Exodus 20:1-17 KJV). So, there you have it! GOD'S TIMELESS COVENANT WITH MAN in the form of the Ten Commandment's. Pastor Benny expounds on the Ten Commandments and explains in detail, each commandment, individually. Thus educating..., by way of Holy Scripture and cross-referencing from both the Old and New Testaments of the Holy Bible, to concisely illustrate what each of the Ten Commandments means, if it isn't self-explanatory. Thus, it is both insightful and full of practical everyday application. Further verifying that the truth of God's Holy Word, never goes away. Pastor Benny teaches in a manner that is easy to understand and learn from, should you choose to do, so. Yes, this is an 'oldie-but-goodie', color, VHS tape. But, whoever said that one can learn from DVD's, only?! So, get your pencils and papers, ready. Open your Holy Bible (King James Version), and follow along with this informative VHS, video tape, teaching that's genuinely interesting. Great for church, school or a home study of the Ten Commandments, GOD'S TIMELESS COVENANT WITH MAN. Nina Kish",1432684800,,4384,4.48125
