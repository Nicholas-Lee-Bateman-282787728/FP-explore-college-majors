""Naked Ambition"" is a bad movie. It's got an ugly cast, bad acting, a stupid plot, terrible editing, ridiculous writing, poor direction. To top all of that off, this also is a crummy DVD transfer, which has awful sound and even worse video transfer. Looks worse than a copied VHS tape.

I can't think of another soft-core movie with co-leading ladies who are less attractive than Jessica Drake and Jackilyn Lick. Seriously, we are scraping the bottom of the woodpile with these two, who must have stumbled out of a north Louisiana trailer park right into the erotic film industry. Pretty sure that both of them were hit in the face with 2x4s at some place in their youth. Such harsh, harsh features.

The acting is excruciating to watch in places. Yes, nobody watches these movies for the acting, but if you don't have enough quality with the ""other"" stuff to help you overlook it, bad acting is that much more distracting. And this one, with the exception of the rambunctious sex scenes, doesn't have enough of that ""other."" Zero explicit nudity. No full frontal nudity even! And heck, if you blink you'll miss the exposed rear views. What in the world ever happened to the gratuitous shower scene??? At one time directors in this genre had elevated that to an art form. Even Ava Vincent, the only redeeming commodity in this cast, doesn't give us enough exposure to get excited about.

Then you've also got script gems like this:  ""It's a new camcorder--the kind with a hard-drive memory card. A Bluetooth, they call it."" Sheesh, did they do any research at all??

Movies like this one are the hallmark of the MRG line, which was an unworthy successor in Playboy's library to the glory of Eros and Mystique Films. I can't tell you how many of these mid-2000s releases that I've seen, and almost none of them are worth your time. Put this one in that same bin.",1379203200,2,1982,4.6164772727272725
