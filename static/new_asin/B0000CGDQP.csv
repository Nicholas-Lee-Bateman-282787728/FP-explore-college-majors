7999503,4,B0000CGDQP,I enjoyed this DVD on a professional level. As a developmental specialist I use this DVD to help train families on some of their options to help their child's motor development. I do not use it as the sole tool available to parents but more of a direct way of showing them ways to work with their child. If you are looking for a more varied open ended play experience with your child I do not recommend this DVD for that purpose. Overall though it is a valuable addition to any DVD library.,1206835200,,490,4.279569892473118
7999504,2,B0000CGDQP,"As an occupational therepist, I understand the value in developmental exercises for my baby, but this video has you sitting on the floor doing exercises on your baby all day.  I really like the Ivy League Baby DVD by Aimee Ketchum.  She is also an OT and gives great techniques to stimulate your baby that you can integrate into your daily routine.  She teaches a very simple baby massage as well.  I think you can get it on ebay and it is much less expensive.",1144540800,3,460,4.376470588235295
7999505,4,B0000CGDQP,"This video was informative but it is not detailed enough for me. I'm so hungry for what I can do with my little guy that I'm buying and reading and viewing everything I can get my hands on.  I really liked Aimee Ketchum's DVD. It had SO much more information in it and she is extremely qualified and seems like a nice mommy who really cares about children. Very kind.  Her massage part is great and she gives so much information on how to interact naturally with baby to improve development that I'm so happy I found her dvd.  It's much more inexpensive than the other dvd and vhs tapes I've viewed, given the tons of information she gives.",1137196800,,640,4.361344537815126
