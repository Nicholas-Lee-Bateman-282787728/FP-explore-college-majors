8691386,5,B006W06D9O,"My wife is a long time fan of this series and has been unable to watch it since we left Japan. So the release of the DVD sets has been very welcome and we hope C.A.L. is able to release additional seasons.
The DVD set arrived in great condition - it was hard to tell that it was not new. Of course the set is region 2 so must be played on a compatible player, but they all play properly.
Samurai_media_JPN4US has also been an outstanding vendor to buy from and provided excellent follow-up with another purchase.",1396224000,2,512,4.288659793814433
