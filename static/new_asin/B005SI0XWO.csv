8485134,4,B005SI0XWO,I just returned from a month in Iran.  I really enjoyed seeing this film to help me recall my trip.,1482969600,,99,3.95
8485135,5,B005SI0XWO,"I like that Iran was shown in a more positive light because I have been exposed to much negative publicity. The information is quite different than I am used to. Also, I loved seeing the architecture and the designs and patterns of tiles and materials. I think there are good people everywhere and this film will show you some of them. Also, olives are awesome!",1478390400,,361,4.569230769230769

8485138,4,B005SI0XWO,"I have watched and to just about every Iran documentary and listen to 5+ audible about modern Iran.

This doc is very ""real"".  Unlike the Steve Ricks Iran doc, which is very high quality and feels like half of it was made by the Iranian cultural ministry.

It does tell you how they can and can not show in their production.  The show has a good guide and show decent amount of regular persians working and living.  Taking 1 star away because I don't understand why the host/narrator doesn't show his face.

The more I see Iran the more I feel Iran its like a smaller version of China from 25 years away.",1406332800,2,604,4.300884955752212
8485139,1,B005SI0XWO,Crappy depiction of a complex country and culture.  Poor cinematography and boring narration.  Understandable that there are restrictions for filming in Iran but that's no excuse.,1392422400,,179,5.846153846153846
8485140,5,B005SI0XWO,"It was so amazing, it brought tears to my eyes seeing my homeland after years. It was a good tour around Iran and showed the highlights I think. However, in some parts of the film, the voice mix was not so good. Two people (the guide and Buddy himself) were talking at the same time and you couldn't understand any of them! However, I liked the fact that people of Iran were shown as they were.

I hope one day U.S. Americans can visit Iran and see it for themselves. That would be a good opportunity for Iranians to host you as you hosted and cared for us Iranians here.",1391212800,6,571,4.1909090909090905
