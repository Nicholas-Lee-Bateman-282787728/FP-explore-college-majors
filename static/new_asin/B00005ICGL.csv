1425865,3,B00005ICGL,"not too sure about this one. The skating (is bad), the story line is bad, but rest is great. Don't get this see see skating but to see some van smashing and the guy from chips.",1007164800,,176,3.9166666666666665
1425866,1,B00005ICGL,"If you have any respect for skateboarding, what-so-ever, leave this DVD where you found it. The actual skating to be seen in the video is scarce. All you really do see is bad pranks mixed with bad humor. Who would have thought Eric Estrada would have degraded himself to this level? If you want to see a bad skate video with even worse humor, then pick this up. If you're actual looking for a worthwhile skate video, you might have to stick with VHS, because it's hard to find anything redeemable on DVD.",997920000,,504,4.43010752688172
1425867,3,B00005ICGL,i bought this dvd becuase i thought it would be funny and have some sk8ing in it and..... it had a couple funny parts to it but there was hardly any skating or TALKING other than that it had good special features and old school rap from eazy e and snoop anyways if you wanna have a laugh id get it but if you wanna see some sk8ting id stay away,996192000,,344,3.859154929577465
1425868,1,B00005ICGL,"This skate video was probably the worst skate video that I've ever seen. They claimed it took them 5 years to make this video. 5 YEARS??? Is that how long it took them to hide there pride and integrity just being associated with this piece of work? I'm giving this video a 1 star only because they won't allow me to give this video a zero star rating. The skate video was about 45 minutes long but there was only about 5 minutes of actual skating. Most of the tricks were old and repetitive. The lamest part of the video was the dumb T&A and the lets burn everything  and run over everything with the van shtick. Tony Hawk does make a guest appearance. As a fan of Tony hawk for many years, I hope Tony Hawk never adds this video to his resume.",994982400,3,744,4.166666666666667
1425869,5,B00005ICGL,"Destroying America, brought to you by Hook Ups, is one of the best skateboarding video's after  Birdhouse's The End, and Osiris' The Storm.  This Video is jam packed with awsome moves, great bails, and the funny (sort of) plot line.  It could have been the best would it have had the bad side of people like Tony Hawk and Jeremy Klein that The End did, but it is still the skateboarding video you should get you, a friend, or your kids this season.",991267200,,448,4.373493975903615
1425870,5,B00005ICGL,"if you like vedios like cky2k, the end , tenticles of destruction you will love this one it has great skating and entertaining momements all away through.",991180800,2,154,4.7407407407407405

7938287,5,B00005ICGL,"Definitely worth it for the cheap price. One of the original skate videos, the acting is rediculiously stupid it's hilarious. Short video with a good soundtrack too",1362960000,,164,5.111111111111111
7938288,5,B00005ICGL,"If what you're looking for is a hardcore skate movie, this isn't it, but if you're a fan of Jeremy Klein, then this is for you! If you know Jeremy Klein's humor, and his way of going about things, particularly skating, you know that he isn't the type of guy who practices to hit stuff perfect everytime, he's the type of guy who just goes for, whatever. This movie has hilarious parts, involving Klein, and then some actually wicked skate scenes, maybe not as much as The End may have had, but in this case, it's just enough, this isn't a movie only on skateboarding, it's just, a movie. This is nothing like Jackass, and not even close to people trying to be Jackass wannabes, Klein has been around the skating world way longer then Knoxville, and it shows. Don't buy this movie if you're looking for people stapling their body parts, or dancing around in panda suits, but if you're a fan of Klein or Kirchart, then this is definitley for you.",1181088000,,944,4.46242774566474
7938289,5,B00005ICGL,"This is not a skateboarding movie. It's basically a real movie, but has skateboarding in it. It's hilarious and highly entertaining. The movie features great skating by Heath Kirchart and Jeremy Klein as well as: crazy stunts, van smashing, hook-ups tour footage and more. The actual story is about two skaters (Heath & Jeremy) that are being followed around by a cop who is trying to bust them for all the laws they have broken. It kept me laughing for a while. The DVD features are great. There's tons of features. Such as: Cast & Crew pics, bios & photos, behind the scenes, additional footage, board graphics, trailers, ads and much more. Get this vid now!",1083888000,,660,4.698275862068965
7938290,3,B00005ICGL,"This isn't a very good skate movie.  The pacing of the non-skate stuff is tedious and cumbersome and not all that entertaining.  The scenes with the nurses, for example, are incredibly boring, as the novelty of volleyball-sized twins wears off almost instantly.  The destruction of the police car at the end is boring too, at least until they dump it off the building.  Tony Hawk's segment left me thinking ""huh?""  The references to Hawk's Gleaming the Cube role is funny for a second, but it goes on for minutes.
The saving graces are the skate segments, Ming Tran's segments, Gayblader, and the behind the scenes video (especially all the Ming Tran segments).  If you can pick this up cheap, it's worth it for that.",1046736000,3,717,4.741935483870968
7938291,4,B00005ICGL,"i THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE BECASUE OF THE FACT THAT WAS ALOT LIKE CKY OR JACKASS, WITH HEATH KIRCHART AND JERMEY KLEIN SKATING WAS A BONUS.  bUT I THOUGHT THE BEST PART WAS WITH BAM IN IT , I WOULD TELL YOU WHAT IT IS BUT IT IS MORE FUNNYER SEEING THE MOVIE .",1040860800,,263,3.6964285714285716
7938292,4,B00005ICGL,"At first I hated this video, but after a long hiatus I watched it again and thoroughly enjoyed it. I was having a Jackass marathon and this fit in perfectly (along with the Big Brother videos and cky videos). Anywho...yeah there's not much skateboarding but it has Jeremy Klein and Heath wrecking havoc in a van...and Mark Gonzales makes an appearnce. The music for the tour footage is by Cher and surprisingly it fits well. You also got Willy going potty behind some bushes which was funny. Jeremy Klein dressed as a dorky rollerblader annoying Dan Rogers was great. The little skating in it was good along with good music. If you like Jackass, I recommed this, if you want to see amazing skateboarding skip this and get p.j. ladd's wonderful horrible life and tiltmode army's man down.",1036281600,,787,4.7101449275362315
7938293,3,B00005ICGL,"this movie has to be one of the [worst]  skate movies i have ever seen, but ive noticed when you don't skate you seem to hate watching it but if you skate you love to watch it. in my opinion i think people who don't skate will love it but i thought it was ok....i guess.",1027036800,,270,3.8214285714285716
7938294,5,B00005ICGL,"The major problem with skate videos today are that they are stale and predictable. Nothing really seperates a skate video from others. This is not the case with Destroying America. Lot's of destruction, high quality footage and a hilarious performance by Erik Estrada make this video great. Not to mention the eye candy provided by the beautiful Rachel Sterling. If you're looking for something new, interesting, entertaining, and different, give Destroying America a view. If you're a jaded skater smark, and pretend to hate anything that differs from the homogenated generic [stuff] you've been watching, then don't watch it.",1021248000,2,627,5.343434343434343
7938295,1,B00005ICGL,"This is the worst skate video I have ever seen, much less one of the poorest excuses for comedy ever committed to film.  If you are looking to see skating, then stay away from this steaming pile of trash. If you are into seeing two guys drive around in a beat up van setting things on fire or are eleven years old, then you will probably like this. It wouldn't be half bad (but still pretty dumb) if they combined said driving around and setting things on fire with some actual SKATING. There's probably only 5 minutes of skating in the entire video. The whole thing plays like a cut-rate episode of MTV's ""Jackass,"" but at least ""Jackass"" was sometimes kinda' funny and wasn't pretending to be a skate video. Heath Kirchart and Jeremy Klein come off like Johnny Knoxville wanna-be's with half the wit...and that's not saying much.
Maybe I missed it and the whole point was to fill 45 minutes with the most cliched and dumbest jokes and situations on the planet, (C'mon...cops hanging around the donut shop jokes?! That's a new one. Haven't ever seen that before) thus making it a REALLY BAD video on purpose. I think that's giving them way too much credit. The only credit they truly deserve is for giving me a headache and the urge to run the DVD over with my car 200 times.
I can't speak for the rest of America, but I do know it completely destroyed 45 minutes of my time. Have a nice day.",1010188800,4,1393,4.42023346303502
