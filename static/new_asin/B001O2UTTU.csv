3726172,5,B001O2UTTU,"I have only seen parts of this, but it seems really interesting.  My boys (10 and 8) love it and have watched it twice since they got it two days ago.",1388016000,,150,3.838709677419355
3726173,5,B001O2UTTU,"WE ordered this because we know one of the pilots in it, but even if you don't have a personal connection, it's a great inside scoop video and very informative while not boring you with uninteresting details. Even our 5 and 8 year old sons really enjoyed watching it!",1319500800,,267,4.469387755102041
3726174,5,B001O2UTTU,I enjoyed this DVD. My government class was studying the fringe benefits of the president and this proved to be an interesting topic.  Most people have no idea how much work and detail goes in to hauling the president anywhere.  The students really liked watching the prospective pilots trying to land the helicopter on the south lawn on the 3 disks that are rolled out each time they land there.  This is a nice look into a fascinating job in the United States Marine Corps.,1299283200,2,475,4.564705882352941
3726175,4,B001O2UTTU,"[This capsule review applies to the version of the program aired on National Geographic Channel in January, 2009.]

I have seen many (all?) the documentaries available on Air Force One, but I had always craved more information about the other prominent presidential aerial transport, Marine One.  ""On Board Marine One"" at last gives us a rare look inside that helo and the unit (HMX-1) supporting it.

The storyboard of the film progresses in logical fashion from Marine Base Quantico to the White House to an actual transport mission.  We observe the lone crew chief practicing his drills until they are absolutely perfect, would-be pilots undergoing simulator exercises followed by actual practice approaches and landings on the South Lawn of the White House and, finally, we travel with HMX-1 to New York City as they prepare to shuttle President George W. Bush from JFK Airport (where he arrives on Air Force One) to the Wall Street Heliport in preparation for his visit to the United Nations.  The footage inside and outside the helicopters is outstanding and is as close to flying with the president as most of us are ever likely to get.

Witnessing the consumate skill that the members of HMX-1 bring to their job, you will come away with enhanced respect for the small group of incredibly hard-working people who, as the unit commander says, ""are not special Marines doing an ordinary mission"" but ""ordinary Marines doing a very special mission.""

[Note: There will no doubt be an updated (or new) version of this program once the new Marine One enters service, but don't let that delay you in acquiring this gem of a program.  I would hope that National Geographic will offer a special disc set pairing this program with its mate, ""On Board Air Force One""--maybe in time for Father's Day?]",1233446400,6,1798,4.891447368421052
