5719042,5,B00CENSU1W,"Spin-off of the popular Justice League and Justice League Unlimited cartoon series.
So far, we're as hooked even more than the previous forerunners.
The stories are told like an on-going story you have to follow. Not too unlike a soap opera but for kids.
Heroes aplenty and great graphics. Good for kids and adults.
Quick delivery.",1367884800,14,331,4.928571428571429
5719043,1,B00CENSU1W,"Years ago, my sister and I would rotate playing Donnie and Marie and the Wonder Twins. We would dress up our cat Roberto as the monkey Gleek. One year, we went to another prom together at our high school dressed up as the Donnie and Marie version of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia. Our open-mouthed kiss that night  became quite the sensation when it appeared in our school yearbook before anyone knew Luke and Leia were related. We didn't think anything of it at the time since it seemed natural.
Kind of gross to think about it in hindsight that George Lucas would not have planned out his characters better instead of focussing on goofy special effects.
The Justice League has never been the same since the Wonder Twins left.
I run a video rental booth and phone card charging station inside a drugstore/ hardware store, I get early access to many movies before they come out for sale at retail. The animation, story-telling and voice work is really no different than all the other DC direct to video because they suck.
Not good enough to be in the theather or on tv, so they box it up and try to break even. Sure, I will rent out this movie a few times, but it's more of a trendy filler for a very limited audience.",1367712000,11,1221,4.426666666666667
5719044,1,B00CENSU1W,"It wasn't a very good mini-series to begin with, and in the end it only brought a more violent, misogynistic, 1990's Image ""extreme"" tone to DC Comics. I hope this doesn't herald the New 52 to be on screen next, featuring the heroes that aren't very heroic at all.",1367452800,28,264,4.408163265306122
5719045,5,B00CENSU1W,"DC does it again with another great tale of time travel and alternate realities.

The story keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time.  It has so many little things going on that you'll notice more and more of them each time you watch it. Also, that ending makes me tear up every time.",1518825600,,294,4.140350877192983
5719046,5,B00CENSU1W,The best DC animated film by a long way.  Savage all the way through.,1518134400,,69,3.9285714285714284
5719047,5,B00CENSU1W,"The Flash has always felt enormous guilt over the loss of his mother. Specifically, if he were home, he could have prevented the intruder from killing her. Caught up in a moment of overwhelming grief, the Flash decides to go back in time to make things right. When he wakes up the next day, his mother is alive, but the world is completely changed from what it was the day before.

While the members of the Justice League for the most part are still alive, they are certainly not the Justice League. By changing the one moment in the past, the Flash has also changed the lives of those around him. Batman is not the Batman that we know. Aquaman and Wonder Woman are not friendly, to say the least, both being the leaders of their respective Antlanteans and Themiscyrians. While baby Kal-Els ship does land in a farm field in Smallville, the Kents drive past the landing site. The little change in time caused the Kents to drive far enough so as to not notice the ship flying overhead. Baby Kal-El is found, but the reveal of who found him and where he ended up is one of the bigger shocks in the movie, one that should be quite unsettling to any fans of Superman.

It gets so ugly that Aquaman and Wonder Woman come to blows, both using their armies to settle their differences. Unfortunately, humans are the ones caught in the middle, and it appears that we would not stand a chance against either of them.

This is a very grim story, with a decidedly adult take on our comic book heroes. While the use of the word enjoy may not be correct, I will say that it completely held my interest. It got to a point where I was wondering just how dark it would go. My question was answered by the ultimate result of Aquaman and Wonder Womans disagreement.

Highly recommended, but keep the younger ones away.",1518134400,,1800,4.412650602409639
5719048,3,B00CENSU1W,"DCs Speedster storyline is cool but their fighting scene are so primitive.

5719080,5,B00CENSU1W,"This is head and shoulders above all of DC's animated movies. It is the darkest rendering of these characters. There's a safety net here because it's an alternate timeline (and we know by the end it's going to be righted and everyone's going to be A-OK). But until then it's bullets and blood and snapped necks and people razed to ashy smudged by laser beams. It's a bit jarring to see them go this far but in a totally satisfying way. The take on  Batman especially is grim and ingenious. The animation is exceptional and does especially well conveying movement -- something strangely lackluster in a lot of American animation and that the Japanese mastered a long time ago. The writing is strong, daring and zeroes in on some strong emotional moments. The 3rd act showdown in particular is a real treat.",1495324800,,805,4.669014084507042

5719084,5,B00CENSU1W,This movie represents everything right with DCs animated movies. It takes a great comic book title and presents it close enough to source material for fans but with changes that keep you guessing.

5719096,1,B00CENSU1W,"Warning - not for kids! Contains sadism, depression, a bloody beheading and many fatalities. And these apply to the heroes!! Batman is an alchoholic and obviously depressed. Both Aquaman and Wonder Woman have more in common with Hitler than anyone else. Also gratuitous sexual innuendo. It is obvious that WB has decided to do anything it can to squeeze a dollar out of the flick. Even using the name - the Justice League - in relation to this film is disgusting. When I was a kid, comic characters were all about setting an example for young people. It is no wonder that we have kids shooting people on almost a daily basis with this kind of movie available.",1485302400,,659,4.593220338983051

One of the best animated films they have ever done, great pacing, voice acting, animation, excellent story, wonderful exploration of an alternate timeline, the alternate Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and Cyborg really illustrating new facets of these heroes.

When the time line is altered that bring Flash mom back from the dead it is not the only change the alternate time line deals with as Paradise Island and Atlantis is at war with everyone else caught in the middle.

At the start reverse flash clearly wants revenge so he goes back in time to kill hes friends so the justice league cant be formed. Well he doesnt. Everything is all twisted
Bruce's father is batman & uses guns
Fake cyborg
Captain MARVEL. Not thunder is also ten kids.
Ten freaking kids. It should be 1 kid
Aqua man is a beefy street fighter macho
Superman is half dead
How reverse flash changed supermans pod will never be answered
Green lantern is in this but is useless
Aquaman cheats on hes wife with wonder woman yet the two tribes are at war. Yea that makes sense.
So were the end. Reverse flash shows up
Says its the flashes fault which is total bs
Why the hell would the flash ""a super HERO"" bring war?
Bs. Plane bs
The flash goes back in time meeting himself in the time tunnel stopping himself & not the guy who killed hes mother? Or reverse flash? Wait wtf
No! No no no
You cant do that

5719297,4,B00CENSU1W,"Very good adaptation of the flashpoint story from the comics.  Well put together with so much happening and so many characters.  Not a fan of the animation though.
Small rant:
I am noticing a disturbing trend among DC stories of today, its really getting dark and gritty and many of the characters are becoming less and less themselves.  In this particular case of flashpoint, the behaviors of both Wonder Woman and Aquaman are very uncharacteristic of what I am use to.  I understand the time-line changed, and understand there would probably be behavior changes among the characters, but I think the interpretation here is a bit extreme in the case of Aquaman and Wonder Woman.  At times, feels like a Game of Thrones lovers quarrel not caring about anyone else, including the innocent.  Wonder woman (spoilers)even kills a kid in cold blood for Christs sake.  I guess things are changing for a new generation.",1459555200,,912,4.883116883116883

5719300,1,B00CENSU1W,"If you want to see Wonder Woman kill children this is the movie for you.  Basically that sums up my feelings for this movie - probably the most violent PG13 movie I have ever seen.  The children murder should have pushed it to R.  DCs attempts to go dark are so wierd while Marvel cranks out fun light hearted hero movies we have violence non stop.

I do think after Flash returns to his reality he definitely should have had Superman snap WW neck just as a precaution because clearly she is fundamentally broken and disturbed.",1458432000,,527,4.458333333333333
5719301,5,B00CENSU1W,"Critics promoted PG-3. Try a little higher. This is a movie is NOT for children. Your child should be well above the age of fifteen for this. There's a lot of graphic violence, blood, sexeal talking (no, not inuendos) and several other things pre-teens and younger shouldn't see and this is it.

On the scale of an adult rating, totally BA. Would watch again with my friends. It was awesome and all the action, the violence, and the constant answering to what would happen if Bruce died instead. Or if Batman actually did kill people. Come on, everyone's a little interested on how that would be and man it was dark.",1458086400,,616,4.54954954954955

5719323,4,B00CENSU1W,"One of the better DC animated movies, but by no means perfect.  As with most DC movies, there is an expectation that you already know who all the heroes and villains are, very little if any time is given to exposition to set up the characters.  There is a little more violence than the average from DC, but nothing in poor taste or gratuitous, it is all a part of the plot and is handled well.  The animation is good, but not great.  The characters all have huge chests and no neck.  Just a bulge of muscles attaching pecs directly to their head.  It's a little distracting.  The story holds up well, it's based on the Flashpoint graphic novel which was very well received.  Overall I thought it was really good, can't wait for the next DC movie.",1457568000,,746,4.355072463768116

5719387,2,B00CENSU1W,"Without a doubt, the worst movie ever put out by DC. My son (who is a huge fanboy) and I watched this and throughout the movie he was telling me who all the new characters were who were being introduced and killed off just as fast. The alternate universe thing gets old quick as heroes you've pulled for in the past are killing each other and Batman has a gun and kills everyone and it is all too painful to watch. We got bored by the big finale -- just terrible and upsetting to see the twisted view of a ""WHAT IF"" script on the screen. Sadly, children will see this and judge the great body of excellent comics on this disaster.  SKIP THIS",1451865600,,641,4.169354838709677
5719388,3,B00CENSU1W,"This story had the potential to be something very special but DC fell very short of reaching that potential. The comic book version is highly revered but this film version is too short to allow for proper development. Everything is rushed and reduced to one-dimensional characters. The voice actors don't really have much room here to do much. There's a lot of action, similar to the WAR film (which is also weak and shallow), and a lot of violence for its own sake. This is one of the darkest animated superhero feature films.

The plot is very interesting --- Flash does a good deed in the past which alters the future so that the Justice League (and even the Flash!!!) don't exist, Aquaman and Wonder Woman are quite evil, Hal Jordan and others are killed, etc. It's like a variation of the alternate universe story line. The twist on Batman's character is very cool indeed.

However, there's little time to develop the idea because Aquaman and Wonder Woman are having a war which will destroy the human race and the longer the Flash stays in the past the less likely he'll be able to change it and escape it. So there's s lot of brutal fighting taking up most of the film and after a while it fails to hold my attention.

Another gripe I have with this and other newer DC feature films is the use of Japanese style animation. I see the cool looking DVD cover and it builds up an expectation of how good the film will look. Seeing the cheaper style animation in the actual film is a let down. Other DC cartoons have this same problem.

I bought this on blu-ray for less than $10. I can't say the blu-ray looks any better than the DVD I rented when it came out. It's a decent film for less than $10 but you may want to rent it before you buy it..",1451433600,,1748,4.352760736196319

5719408,5,B00CENSU1W,"This movie may well pummel you at super-speed.  It is violent, brutal, and takes seriously the idea that seemingly innocuous or even good deeds done for selfish reasons can have disastrous effects.  The beginning and end of the movie, involving Barry Allen as the Flash, tie together nicely when we see the harm his good (but selfish) deed has done when he traveled back in time to save a loved one.  In a butterfly effect way that loved ones death helped to create the world that the Flash knows and loves but his saving them throws him into an alternate timeline where the world is in tatters, a raving and powerful Aquaman (dude is badass) and ferocious Wonder Woman command their respective forces and are responsible for a lot of devastation.  These two former lovers are also at war with each other.  And the world is on the brink of WWIII.  Flash freaks out but manages to pull it together as he pieces together whats been going on and, with the help of a Batman (not Bruce Wayne, though someone very close to him), an American militarized Cyborg, and a crippled unrecognizable Superman, barely saves the day.  But the cost is in many lives, and was bloody.  And Flash in a dark dark moment finds out that his selfish though thoroughly understandable behavior led to all of this.  It wasn't Barrys best day ever.

As many other reviewers have alerted this movie is not for the tots or the pre-teen market.  Its aimed, smartly and squarely, at older teens and adults.  Its themes are adult, and it doesnt pander to its audience.  The story is great, the animation crisp and fluid, and DC again has fun playing the what if? card.  DC has put out some extremely high quality television and theatrical fare (wish Marvel could figure this element out) and The Flashpoint Paradox is among its best.  It also connects with other DC feature animated films by leading into Justice League: War.  Bring it.",1445472000,,1902,4.632835820895522

5719410,4,B00CENSU1W,"Not for kids!! I was surprised as to how dark the movie got. DC usually tries to kept it PG-13 as least, but this was extremely violent than the normal DC fare. I am not a hard core fan, but I enjoyed the Justice League and Young Justice series and I do like the current live action Flash and Arrow series, which is why I wanted to see this movie as it was referenced in the Flash series. I enjoyed the overall story in which we see the alternate versions of the heroes, but I was just surprise how dark it got. Even though some of the more gruesome stuff happens off screen, it really is a more adult story. Besides that my only issue is that Flash seemed less developed as a character in his own storyline, maybe because the darker version of the characters had better lines, but him and Cyborg seemed a little one dimensional. I think it could have been a better story if it was a series or mini series to allow more filling out of Flash's personal journey. I think while it was fun seeing the alternate versions of most of the main DC characters it sometimes got in the way as it limited the time spent on the main story.",1444867200,,1125,4.188940092165899

5719424,5,B00CENSU1W,"One of the best DC Comics movies to date, second only to The Dark Knight Returns. Even thought it's technically a Flash movie, it's almost as much about Batman, and it offers a great variation of the Batman persona that still succeeds in being authentically Batman (unlike the later ""Gods and Monsters"" DC Comics Movie, which totally lost the spirit of Batman with its vampire Batman). Very violent but not gratuitous; the violence makes sense while the movie has a heart. Definitely recommended.",1441843200,,496,4.9879518072289155

5719443,5,B00CENSU1W,"Totally awesome Justice League animovie!

What would happen if the Flash decided to use his power to travel back in time and change his own past? To save someone he loved more than anything in the world?

Without the death of his mother during a break-in at his childhood home...would Barry Allen have had the drive and motivation to work countless hours of overtime as a forensic lab technician? Staying late every night, sacrificing his personal life, to ensure his test results were in?  Even during terrific thunderstorms?

This fantastic story depicts what might happen if the Flash ever decided to use his powers in the way that Eobard Thawne has.  The results are incredible to watch.

Cool stuff to to make you interested:

Batman is NOT Bruce Wayne
Aquaman and Wonderwoman's peoples are at war

I'm thankful that I did not have my children watch this with me. I did not get very far before I turned the video off. I later watched a clip on YouTube; the Flash fighting the Reverse Flash that suddenly ended with a loud sound and a gapping hole in the Reverse Flash's forehead that you can see Batman through standing behind him with a smoking gun in his outstretched hand. The violence must be from the ISIS playbook with a decapitation and Wonder Woman hanging an American war hero.

The flash in the cartoon, just as in the TV show, goes back in time to rescue his mother and all hell breaks loose. Everything has changed, and not for the better. The good guys are power hungry dictator want to bees, and the bad guys are the ones trying to become hero's.

I liked everything but the over-Manga-fication of the characters--everyone was huge slabs of beef! And the cel-style shading was too stark. However, I am well aware that these things are subjective, and there are whole generations of anime fans who might think I'm nuts.

It's not that I'm anti-manga. I've read a lot of it, and adopted a lot of those techniques into my own, decidedly American comic art style. But, it's equally true that I haven't watched much anime, so there you go.

Anyway, good movie, enjoyed it.",1433635200,,623,4.8584905660377355

You see some gore and disturbing content that won't be suitable for young viewers.",1433635200,,365,4.484848484848484
5719480,5,B00CENSU1W,"I love alternate timeline stories, and this is a great one.  Just taking in that vein, as a movie about being in a bad alternate timeline, and having to try to figure out how to change it, it is a great movie.  But, it is also a great superhero movie.  The differences in all the heroes and villains were starling, especially Batman, Wonder Woman, and Aquaman.  I wasn't at all familiar with the comic book storyline when I saw this, so I was really shocked at some of the stuff that happened, and as I have seen in other reviews, feel a warning is due that this movie almost stretches the limits of pg-13 at times with the level of violence.  Violence doesnt bother me in movies, but it should be considered in this movie as far as children go.  That is the only caution I would put on a great movie.",1433203200,,801,4.2368421052631575

The voice acting was great, the film was consistently entertaining, and the dialogue was on-point. Zoom's monologue about how Barry didn't go back in time to ""make Hitler stay in art school"" but to save his ""mommy"" was chilling.

The animation is fun and fluid, apart from just a handful of moments where you can see they used inferior 3D animation, and characters are almost entirely interesting and motivated, especially Batman and Cyborg.

As other reviewers have mentioned, this movie is very violent and has definitely earned it's PG-13 rating, but honestly, I for one was very happy to see a DC animated movie actually deal with it's combat in a more realistic way.",1431993600,,562,4.854166666666667

5719530,5,B00CENSU1W,"the absolute best of ALL the DC animated home videos. This story contains it all; action, suspense, intrigue, drama, brutality and a cluster of heroes in an altered reality that will defiantly get your attention. The story is flawless and even better than the actual storyline that ran through the comics. Prepare to see Aquaman, Wonder Woman, SHAZAM!, Superman, Batman, Green Lantern and others like you've never seen them before. Oh yeah, and be prepared to LOVE the Flash even if you're not a fan of the character. He is everything you want your hero to be and you'll be rooting for him throughout the whole movie.

Like I said in the title, this is by far the best animated movie that DC ever released. Watch it and I'm sure you'll agree!",1429920000,,742,4.621212121212121

What if he could save his mom's life by time travel? However, all the good intentions in the world do not condone the possible negative consequences of time travel, as Flash soon finds out. Now, after saving his mother, a different, much more gritty DC Universe exists. Now he is on an Earth that resembles ours but is horribly different in two or more ways that could cause the death of humanity! Superman is missing, Batman is VERY different(you will not believe this!), and, ......wait for it..............Wonder Woman has the Amazons(no pun intended) at international war with Aquaman and Atlantis! The UK and other parts of the world are in ruins! LOTS, and I mean LOTS of action! Other than Batman Assault on Arkham, this is easily the most graphic, violent, and dark or gritty animated movie I have ever seen! This is rated PG-13 for violence. People are stabbed, shot, crushed, and otherwise just plain beaten to death. Only one spoiler just to give you an idea of the level of violence in this film: Princess Diana(Wonder Woman) is out to kill Aquaman and in order to weaken his resolve, Diana decapitates Mira, Aquaman's wife and displays her head as a trophy! They show all the gruesome details and do not censor the action in this animated movie! PG-13 to TV14 for a REASON.",1425859200,3,1448,4.594594594594595

5719592,4,B00CENSU1W,"I had considered renting this before, but seeing it was Flash-based, I thought, ""Nah, Flash stinks.""  He's quick but boring, his rogues gallery is lame--he is just plain lame.  (Just never got into that character, as you can tell.)  But what I do really like to see is alternate universes and DC Elseworlds, new takes on familiar characters and timelines.  And that's what Flashpoint is all about.  Between the Flash and Reverse Flash (see, told ya: lame!) the timeline itself gets distorted and the resulting reality is a very dark one.  This movie is actually ultra-violent with a lot of death in it (almost more than I'd expect on a PG-13 rating).  The characters and world are fundamentally different.  For example, there's a war between the Atlanteans and the Amazons that's already ruined most of Europe.  This movie/story not only makes Flash not seem so lame, but even makes Aquaman into a bad ass!  (I often refer to him as Aqua-Pud, another character I' like to see made cool, but just never gets there.)  The whole thing is apocalyptic in scale and is about an hour and half of gritty, guilty fun.

In summary, this one made me reconsider my biases against some long-standing DC heroes.  It takes place in the New 52 Universe, so Cyborg and Captain Marvel (is he even called that anymore?) are in there too (another old man gripe I'll save for another time) and used in new and exciting ways.  The animation has a definite Anime style to it, to the point where some character's are so muscled that you expect their tiny heads to pop off, but it still looks and moves great.  4 stars easily, edging 4.5.",1422921600,,1613,4.630281690140845

5719597,2,B00CENSU1W,"Had just finished watching Justice League: WAR (LOVED IT) and based on the reviews wanted to see this one.  I was highly dissatisfied.  The story idea is fine, but the execution was poor.  I had trouble following the flashbacks (until the middle).  Also the art was far below the quality of WAR.  At least one character (never named?) I had no clue of and he ended up being a key to the final conflict.  In fact, there were a lot of characters thrown in that I had no idea of (and I like to think I am knowledgeable of comics).

While violence to children was done off-screen, gratuitous mayhem and dismemberment seemed to be the norm.  One of the final ""shots"" was the classic - looking through the large hole in the guy's forehead at the person who shot him from behind.  Over the top, and unnecessary. It turned my wife and daughter off - if it had happened at the beginning we wouldn't have watched the rest.

I understand the want to make it gritty and even dirty because of the story's premise - it could have been done much more tastefully, and better.  Sorry I bought it.

Of course, these are just my opinions - and I should note that I LOVE watching superhero movies (animated or live action) - especially anything made from a comic (with characters I read when I was young)",1422576000,,1284,4.3940677966101696

5719620,4,B00CENSU1W,"As stated in other reviews, this movie was surprisingly good.

I've always enjoyed DC Animation, with a particular love for Batman: The Animated Series. Since then, DC Animation as produced a follow up series that include Superman, Justice League, Teen Titans and even another iteration of Batman.

Where DC often shines (compared to Marvel) is the story telling and Flashpoint Paradox takes it to a whole another level. This movie is dark, and at times very violent (definitely not meant for children). In that way it is very anime like. I was initially a bit skeptical at having the Flash as the main protagonist but the story played out well and was very moving.

Although I've enjoyed anime, I did not enjoy the animation for some of the characters. Some of the characters are buff to the point of being ridiculous, even in an anime (ex: Aquaman). I usually prefer Japanese animation over American animation in the action category but in this case, I wish it were done w/DC's 90's animation.

Fans of the DC Animated Universe will not be disappointed. This one is worth owning! (I rented this on Amazon and ended up owning a physical copy)",1420156800,,1143,4.757575757575758

It also touches on DC characters feelings as individuals. I couldn't help getting very emotional in a couple of parts of this movie, and as a parent I couldn't get my self to watch these two parts again without tearing up. an amazing movie in all respects.",1419724800,,410,4.337662337662338

5719659,4,B00CENSU1W,"After trying to find a copy of this movie locally I decided to finally rent it through Amazon. I had seen several clips on YouTube and already have watched multiple DC animated films. This one though...I enjoyed parts of it, but it felt so rushed at times that things weren't really explained. I never read the Flashpoint comics so I came into this with just my knowledge of the DC characters from the main timeline. Overall, it is worth watching. I won't want to watch it again, but it is worth a go. I will echo what other reviewers have said in that this is NOT for children. There are many characters getting stabbed, losing limbs or being shot in the face.",1419206400,,661,4.426229508196721

5719677,5,B00CENSU1W,DC took it up a notch on mature content with this one.

It will keep you engaged through it.,1418342400,,268,4.0754716981132075

5719679,5,B00CENSU1W,"I have always been a huge fan of the DC animated movies and shows.  Dad and I used to watch all of the Justice League episodes and the movie adaptations together, going back to when I was 10 or so years old.  Watching these used to be the best! Simple, beat-em-up shows with the best heroes, some awesome baddies, and great stories.  Lately these movies have been taking a very different turn.

The most recent DC installments have been much darker, and it's fantastic.  The movies are a lot more violent, but most impressively, the stories have become much more immersive.  The superheroes are faced with more difficult choices that result in much darker outcomes.  The fight scenes are definitely more violent, and the graphics have gotten a cool update.

This particular installment was awesome.  It was the first of the newer movies that I watched, and I was absolutely taken by surprise.  For me, growing up with these movies, I was pumped about the updates.  I feel like as I've grown up and more mature, my favorite superhero movies have as well.  Now that I'm older, I can appreciate the darker tones to the series.

I absolutely recommend Flashpoint Paradox, and all the other recent DC movies, but I will say not to watch this with your kids.  This one isn't one that dad and I would have watched 10 years ago, though it is still one we can enjoy now.",1418256000,2,1361,4.570247933884297

It's good and I like the special features, but not for $99.85. The Blu-ray Special Edition has a directors commentary and a feature on the Villains of the Flash along with the extras on the DVD and it's only $17.99 as of today. I do like this movie, but... Aquaman and Wonder Woman are very out of character even though this a story about an alternate time line. I do not believe they could ever be so removed from their core being, no matter the circumstance. It's also too violent.

If you are an adult and have always wondered why arrows, baterangs, and other projectiles didn't cause real damage,  you won't ask that question here.  This is an alternative universe for the DC characters.  It is dark and they are super heroes.  I enjoyed cringing every time I saw someone hit or use their powers in a way my imagination works.  I can't stress enough that is dark.  If you want to see super heroes being badasses then this is for you.  It has the right mix of adult humor to offset the darkness of the film.

Sigh...
Ho Hum.
Boring.

It's been done again and again- in the JLA show, in the superman show... really? They had to make this a movie?

Oh wait, maybe people are loving this one because -gasp- the heroes in the doomed future all die particularly violent deaths and... hm. Yawn. They don't matter anyway because Barry has gone back in time and erased their existence, so it's an easy writing effort to have them die... because we can go back in time and re-create the old familiar heroes we all love and adore who will never die...

I was super happy when this movie came out, because it stars Barry Allen, my favorite Speedster! And it has a lot of cameos in it, with Garth, Tula and Kaldur, to Lois Lane being a secret spy? Oh yes!

Also, I never cared much for Flash stories. But it was Labor Day weekend and I was relaxing for the evening and wanted to watch one of the newer DC animated movies I'd yet to see. Not only did I choose wisely, but this may just be the best animated feature they've put out yet.
Most of what DC puts out is Batman. batman is awesome. Everyone loves Batman. And sometimes Superman. Flash is one of those supporting characters that hasn't always been at the forefront of many memorable storylines. This is not the case with Flashpoint. Barry Allen is given center stage to this story, and it is a breath of much needed fresh air. It's a brilliant story full of emotion and unforgiving brutal action at times. It's a near perfect pull off and afterward I was left with an open mouth and an expletive on how good it truly was, and how happily surprised I was by it.  I won't spoil anything here for you, instead I just want you to be rest assured that this is an excellent story, one worth watching above anything else the DC animated features have to offer.

It's personal, epic and dramatic, which is the combination that one always hopes for. As others have mentioned, it's nice to see Flash as the main character, and some of the other characters appear in surprising forms. Yes, this film is rather dark and it is very violent, and should be viewed in the same way as a PG-13 or R live action film. Of all the Warner Bros DC comics animated films that I have seen, this one ranks near the top as an enjoyable film in its own right. Of the ones that are based on the Justice League, I would recommend Flashpoint Paradox alongside the nostalgic New Frontier as the best of the batch.",1409788800,,780,4.386206896551724

5719782,5,B00CENSU1W,I love this film. Very good story. A lot of action and touching at times as well. The film actually has more in it than the comic does. It has more action. You get to see more people talk and do more. They even have Lex iin it. One of the best DC animation films. Flash gets trapped in a new timeline because history got changed and the Aquaman and Wonder Woman are at war. There war takes out a lot people and countries No one is safe. Turns out it may have been done by the Reverse Flash. We have a more violent Batman and he is not Bruce Wayne. Green Lantern does not exist. He is just pilot Hal Jordan.

The changes which are seemingly small yet UTTERLY important add up to a world where the heroes and villains we know and love are no longer familiar. I am a sucker for alternate timeline stories, when people who cross over *know* the people in the new timeline yet can't recognize them because of how small decisions changed everything.

The plot and action scenes are what make this film.  However, the animation leaves MUCH to be desired.  The characters are either over bulked with muscle or look too emaciated.  Was good to see The Flash in a serious role instead of his usual comic relief bit.

5719814,5,B00CENSU1W,"What is it with DC Animated that they can't translate into DC Films?

Their paint-cel features consistently produces amazing, even stunning, dramatic films that honestly dwarf the live-action productions by Marvel.

Sincerely - except for Batman and and the newly rebooted Superman - there's some kind of big time major malfunction over at DC.

Here I am again to praise yet *another* of their fantastic animated movies. This time starring The Flash.

A completely different character treatment than the one fans have gotten used to over the years. Gone is the smarmy walking/talking erection of the Justice League series, here replaced by someone, in many ways, a throwback to the Silver Age Flash - introspective, thoughtful and considered.

I admit it took some getting used to. But once you accept this change - the character flows perfectly within the framework of the story.

Now a full grown adult, Barry Allen reflects on his mother's birthday, a mother he lost to an anonymous attacker who murdered her while he was away at school. (presumably the rape aspect is too close to an R-Rating and is not implied)

As he stands at her grave with his wife - he argues that he's been a hero to everyone but himself.

That's going to stop.

He's going to make things ""right"" by preventing his mother's attack from ever occurring. But Barry learns a most horrific lesson. One that his mom tried to teach him as a youngster: You have to accept the things you can't change. Come to terms with the past, good or bad, and drive on as best you can.

The price for this understanding comes in a form of a world he cannot and could not have imagined. It is the worst of nightmares.

Saving his mother meant changing history - and that meant the entire world had to change too. A seemingly small infinitesimal blip, barely noticeable in the vast tale of the world, is actually a critical nexus point. Barry's choice to alter the past radiates outward like the proverbial pebble in a still pond, producing larger and larger waves.

Now, a small extraterrestrial spacecraft missed crashing into a Kansas cornfield - instead obliterating a portion of Metropolis City; a Kryptonian infant never has loving parents and therefore never grows up to become the World's Greatest Hero. A tiny shift in a bullet's trajectory and a young boy is shot outside a theater - his parents traumatized beyond all reason, twisting their grief into something terrifying and sinister. A meeting of two great leaders produces a marriage and a murder which begins the countdown to global armageddon.

All for a young boy's love for his innocent mother.

Really, a stupendous animated film and one that I heartily recommend to fans of comic-book inspired stories which - interestingly - now includes just about everyone nowadays.

I remember going to different ComicCons back in the 80s - usually there were like a few dozen dealers, a couple of writers, and maybe a notable penciller or two hawking his own stuff. (Bob Layton was one I recall vividly) There weren't any movie or television stars, no one dressed up, and in total I think I saw maybe two hundred guys - not people - guys. It was a pure sausage fest back then.

Just sayin'. <g>",1406764800,,3208,4.763537906137184
5719815,1,B00CENSU1W,"Should have been R rated affront to the good name of the Justice League. Not overly fond of what if stories, or alternate universe/timeline stories and this violent moral-less fable is one of the reasons why. The Flash deserved better for his first JL headliner. No need to weigh in on the story, voice acting, or any other element of this dreck; skip this one, the next was better by default (not high praise but it wasn't hard to top this). The fact that this is somehow a half star higher than Crisis on Infinite Earths ( albeit that was a parallel uni tale, it was well done) is a sobering statement on just where we're at.

5719819,1,B00CENSU1W,"This 2013 flash is just not the same as the 2004 justice league unlimited flash. It doesn't even feel like the same person.

This new flash is boring, not funny, and he's waaay too serious. He barely makes any jokes and he's just not as laid back as he was.

Also what the heck flash crying 43 minutes in? 2004 Flash probably woulda made a joke instead of being so serious all the time.

The story is boring, all the characters are dull, and even though Flash was the main hero of the story, he just wasn't fun to watch at all. Just like this movie.

I'm sorry but this new flash is trash.
2004 Justice leauge unlimited flash is a thousand times better than this new guy and he's definitely worth more money than this new guy.

5719820,5,B00CENSU1W,"With ""The Flashpoint Paradox"" there is so much more complexity than any film director Jay Oliva has done before, with multiple heroes and villains battling each other, and the most unique aspect of this story with ""The Flash"" being the central character, all of the many conflicts both physical and emotional swirling around him like a colorful tornado of souls.  The animation is a mixture of hand-drawn and computer generation and is blended magnificently!  The storylines weave around one another in an alternate reality where Batman acts like The Punisher, Superman is an untested weakling, Aquaman is a badass with a trident, and all should kneel in reverence in the presence of the glorious Wonder Woman.  Not a single character is safe, all are subject to the laws of mortality, and each is portrayed with equal measures of humanity and meta-human strength.  The film is not very long but is crammed with ideas and so many characters that it feels longer as a result.  Also, never underestimate the power of excellent voice acting as the entire cast shines, no matter how small the role: praise to you, Nathan Fillion!  This film, and another Jay Oliva masterpiece (""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns"") should be in every animation fan's collection!",1406073600,,1254,5.0048076923076925

There are numerous characters in the film and there are numerous on screen bloody deaths. This is not for children or the faint of heart, I would call it close to ""R"" rated.

It's by far the darkest animated DC movie out there and I think they did the story true justice.  If you're a fan of Batman or The Flash you have got to see this movie.

5719867,2,B00CENSU1W,"Up until Flashpoint Paradox, I had thoroughly enjoyed the offerings by Warner/DC's Direct to Video market. You could reliably depend upon them for fun, smart, well-animated comic book superhero storytelling with strong direction and great voice actors. Much of that is here in Flashpoint Paradox. Unfortunately, they didn't just cross a line with this movie, they zoomed past it at super speed.

THE GOOD: The first 15 minutes or so of this film are tons of fun. The animation is great as always. The voice actors are top notch. It was really cool to finally get a DC Animated movie that gives Flash the spotlight, (it's just too bad it had to be THIS movie).

THE BAD: A very contrived alternate reality plot in which Wonder Woman and Aquaman arbitrarily turn into the world's most irresponsible selfish jerks. The story is full of oddball mixups where good guys are bad and bad guys are good. This is the kind of alternate reality storytelling that often is forgivable or downright works well, but there's just not much thought put into how and why this reality went so wrong. I could honestly look past the contrived plot/character mixups if it weren't for . . .

THE UGLY: The brutally, brutally, ugly violence dial turned up to eleven, gratuitous nature of this film is impossible to ignore. It's so disgusting that it comes full circle and becomes inappropriately hilarious! The filmmakers come across like little kids who are so insistent that superheroes have to be ""serious stuff"" that they slopped gobs and gobs of blood, gore, guts, impalings, beheadings, charred flesh, and brains (yes brains) into every fight scene. The story could have easily been appropriate for younger audiences if they had just settled down a bit and storyboarded/animated/directed this with with some class. There is more blood and guts in this movie than in most horror flicks or Mortal Kombat games. It just comes off as silly at a certain point.

The previous offerings by Warner were aimed a little more 13 and up, but they otherwise remained generally true to the tone and vibe of what makes DC Superheroes fun for kids and their parents. Its seems like more and more, the grown up nerds who control the comic book industry are trying to change that and say ""these characters are just for us grownups.""",1400284800,4,2294,4.814720812182741

But as the movie began to progress my thought process went somewhere along the lines of Whats happening? Thats not nice. Whered the Happy go? I want the happy back? it just sort of wrenched my heart to see my beloved heros acting in this manner.

Definitely not something you want to let young children watch. Sort of reminded me of a 90s action movies with the over the top violence. BUT, here it works because, its not violence for violence sake, its there to make a point and move the story along.
Plus if you consider the DC animated movies to all be taking place in the DC Multi-verse continuity you sort of have to watch this movie to understand why there are chances in the newer ones.

My own grips with this movie are focused more on the animation and character design. I understand that this is escapism but, when you have ripped characters with small heads, they kind of look ridiculous. Also its really jarring to when the animators switch from really nice hand drawn animation to CGI during the running scenes. I understand it was done to save time and money but it really took me out of the movie in those few scenes it was in.

Overall, great story, great character development and a nice plot twist.

For those of us in the adult crowd this is a fantastic film, by far one of my favorites that I've seen. It takes place in an alternate universe and makes some very interesting changes to classic characters. Some of these changes are so unique and interesting that I would absolutely love to see more of this universe.

While the comic event had several side stories, this mainline feature covers most of the relevant bases of the series.
While this is certainly not an animated film for children, as there is quite a bit of violence, and is a fairly dark examination overall, it fires on all cylinders and proves just how greatly DC's animated department truly are. This was a big deal story in the comics world, as it lead to the creation of a new timeline and started most of the DC Universe over again as the New 52. While the New 52 is a mixed bag of bad and good, this story that enabled it to happen was solid.

I gave this 5 stars for being the greatest DC movie ever made by Warner Premiere for viewers and fans and the most interesting animation, plot, story, and characters. I like the part of this movie where The Flash (Barry Allen) accidently goes back in time and changes the course of history, and teams up with alternate-reality versions of Batman and Cyborg to fix everything back to the way the world used to be, before the war between Aqua man and Wonder Woman prevails.

Amazing art style and voice-work make this a film that distinguishes itself from the rest.

5719904,1,B00CENSU1W,"Well, this was DC Animation's attempt to ""reintroduce"" Barry Allen into their animated universe. Barry Allen used to be the most well-adusted character at DC. Back in the eighties, Mr. Allen still had both his parents living, and for a time happily married. Of course, that was before he was killed off in the Crisis on Infinite Earths.

If DC Animation had to do another reset, this time for their superhero animation, I would have preferred that use COIE, which had a far more epic and some heartfelt moments.

Here everything is just plain ugly. All the characters have jowels, and outside of the rebirth/death of Barry's mother (who wasn't murdered in the first place), there seems to be few bright spots.

The animation is just plain ugly.

Wait. . . I forgot the ending when Batman (Bruce Wayne) gets the letter from his father. That is a powerful moment, but I'm not sure if there shouldn't have been a few more bright moments scattered out the darkness of the film.

I guess this is a set up for the upcoming Justice League: and subsequent films, but I'm not sure if it's a good direction.

The Flash going back in time to save his mother, when Barry Allen was 10, changed reality both before when he arrived in the past, because of time travel shockwaves.

Does that mean every time Reverse Flash and Abracadabra travel from the future to our present, they change reality from before they arrived?  If so, the DC Comics Universe should be different after every time they appear in a Flash story.

I was hoping for an explanation in which a time traveler's actions DURING a visit to the past changed things, not shockwaves from the trip itself.

About the only fault I give it is the male figures for too many of the heroes are incredibly blocky looking.  But that is nitpicking and otherwise the art is very very good most of the time and mind-blowing a lot of the time.

And yes, I cried at the end.  But I am an old fogey.  Not just because of the ending, but the beauty of this movie.  It was true to DC, true to the DC Silver Age, true to the DC I loved clear up and past Crisis on Infinite Earths, and epitomized what DC Comics and DC Animated Movies can be.

ain't pretty.  Watch with horror and confusion as classic
DC Comics icons and American myths are twisted and degraded
into killers and degenerates without a shred of humanity
(or humor).  The so-called plot follows the Flash into an
alternate universe where the Justice League does not exist
and Thomas Wayne has assumed the mantle of Batman to avenge
the death of his son, Bruce.  Alternate versions of the
Justice League show up (Superman, Hal Jordan, Cyborg,
Captain Atom, etc,.) in one from or another to either be
killed off almost instantly or serve some lame plot(???) device.
Wonder Woman kills Mera than duels with Aquaman to the death.
No Tusky the walrus here, folks (Filmation fans). Just good old
modern cynicism and an unhealthy total lack of understanding of
what heros are.

A re-imagining means that the basic core elements of a character
survive intact despite the subtle(???) changes in presentation.

that I have enjoyed visiting with over the past decades in this
chaotic, violent and totally meaningless product.  It is truly
sad that a medium capable of reaching so many of the younger

5719945,3,B00CENSU1W,"...the artwork.

VERY uneven. Flash is okay most of the time, as is Batman, Lois Lane, Steve Trevor... But there are frames of Superman's face (the 'real world' Superman, not 'alternate flashpoint timeline' scrawny Superman) that actually seem misshapen. The proportions are SO heroic on Aquaman, that he looks like he has a head the size of a pea, with a ridiculously long torso. It was actually kinda gross.

That said, this was a great effort. They kept the storyline mostly intact from the comic series, and I could tell they were careful to keep key moments. I won't go into what those were because I don't want to spoil it for anyone.

Another thing they got right -- the voice acting was top notch. OMG how wonderful it was to hear Dana Delaney as Lois again, ditto Kevin Conroy's Batman! C. Thomas Howell and Kevin McKidd, both new (I think?) to voicing DC characters, were dead-on.

One other thing - not for kids. There are decidedly adult themes, such as parental death, infidelity, and graphic/bloody violence. I wouldn't let my own kid watch it if she were under 13.",1393027200,,1079,4.663157894736842

5719951,1,B00CENSU1W,"I initially saw a review of this on Amazon.  I then went and read some of the reviews and the plot synopsis on Wikipedia.  I had bad feelings about it but put it in my queue in Netflix anyway.  I agree with another reviewer in general when he pointed out that, generally speaking, Marvel makes better live action movies but DC usually makes better animated movies.  Unfortunately, this movie is the exception to that rule.

This movie errs right from the beginning in that it automatically assumes that whoever watches it has already read the graphic novel (which I didn't).  There are too many unexplained issues with the story all the way through to make any sense to any rational viewer.  We are led to believe (although never actually shown) that the Flash went back in time to stop his mother from being murdered and the resulting story is the result of his actions.  How in the world would stopping one person's criminal death result in the complete distortion of so many completely unrelated persons' behavior and actions?  This makes no sense at all.  The animation itself is extremely crude and frankly reminds me more of a 1990's cartoon than anything else.  The voice acting was alright but other than the Flash nothing else stands out.  As has been stated elsewhere, basically Aquaman and Wonder Woman have an affair that goes horribly wrong and then start murdering everybody else in the world in order win said war.  With  the real Superman nowhere in sight (and frankly his appearance in the movie was so marginal he might as well have not been there at all), this movie is largely one atrocity after another committed not by the villains one would expect, but mostly by the so called heroes one might have expected to see solving the issue instead of creating it.  This movie should have had an R rating at the very least. The atrocities have been listed in detail in other reviews so I won't repeat them here but this movie was just a complete disappointment all the way through  - with only one exception.  I agree with others who have stated that it is about time the Flash was given a serious role and treated like an adult superhero instead of a goofball who can move very fast.

I guess my most serious gripe with this movie is based more on the moral tone  than anything else.  For better or worse, comic book heroes are the 20th century's mythology/fairy tales.  While I have no doubt that the story might be considered intellectually interesting, the fact is that hard core comic geeks are a very small part of the customer base of those who buys these movies.  The majority of people who buy these movies are probably not comic geeks, but casual viewers and (more importantly) parents of kids who want to watch these types of movies.  IMO, regardless of freedom of the press, copyright ownership, or production staff ""vision"" of how a story should be told, there are some lines you shouldn't cross -  and this movie pretty much crosses all of them.  The fact that this DVD shows the second worst sales figure of all the animated movies DC has yet released will, I hope, be a sign to the powers that be to rein in their production staff a little more in future releases. If I had any kids I would never let them watch this and I will not recommend it to anyone else, comic fan or not.",1392681600,6,3309,4.548986486486487

Story had all the elements I liked:  Alternate universe, desperate times which brought out the best and worst of humanity, but still having hope to hang on to.  Battle of three armies and the end of the world puts the story on the epic Tolkien scale.

5719962,5,B00CENSU1W,"""God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.""

This well-known prayer plays a large role in this movie, as the Flash struggles to gain serenity and wisdom, at least.

This is a (condensed) retelling of the major crossover event that DC came out with a few years ago. I've only read bits and pieces of that event so this will be a review of the movie on its own merits. The story begins with a young Barry Allen coming home to find that his house has been broken into and his mother brutally murdered. We flash forward (sorry) to the present day where an adult Barry Allen is putting flowers on his mother's grave, only to be notified that there has been a break-in at the Flash Museum. On arrival, he encounters a veritable rogue's gallery of his top foes, including the Top, Mirror Master, Heat Wave, Captain Cold, Boomerang, and the Reverse Flash (Eobard Thawne).

Thawne has hired the other Rogues to distract Flash while he carries out his plan, trapping Barry in a future-technology adhesive that will never give way, while he plants half a dozen bombs, on the various Rogues and on Flash, intending to erase not only Barry Allen, but also his museum and the surrounding city blocks. Barry manages to trap Thawne in his own adhesive but Thawne decides it's worth it to die if it means that Allen dies, as well. Allen summons the Justice League to assist but they are unable to handle the future technology and disarm the bombs. Flash tells them to take the Rogues Gallery members away to try to disarm the bombs away from the city, leaving Allen and Thawne behind. The various solutions are novel and the sequence is riveting.

As Thawne is led away, another scheme in ruins, he drops a bombshell: ""Enjoy your petty little victories, Flash. For no matter how fast you run, you can't save everyone. Not the ones that matter to you."" Allen is shocked as he puts two and two together. Batman tries to reassure Flash and asks him if he's okay. Flash responds: ""Don't worry about me, Bats. I'm fine. Nothing I can't run off.""

This was a terrific prologue, setting the stage beautifully for the story that is to follow. The next scene shows a groggy Barry Allen waking up at his desk at the Police Department. To his astonishment, he sees a breaking news report that ""Citizen Cold"" is battling Captain Boomerang. Barry runs off to put a stop to the struggle but finds, to his even greater astonishment, that his costume ring is gone, that he is unable to muster any speed, and that, as he trips on the steps leading out into the sidewalk, his mother is still alive.

In the world in which he finds himself, his mother was never murdered, Iris West has married another man and has a child, Citizen Cold is a hero, the Flash never existed, a young Bruce Wayne was killed and his father, Thomas Wayne, has become a much darker, gun-wielding Batman, who's not above killing his foes. We also find out that Cyborg is a much more decked-out version, who has a role as a National Security Advisor, and who is trying to assemble heroes into a league, including Enchantress, Pied Piper, Citizen Cold, Shade, Sandman, and the Shazam kids. They're hoping to persuade Batman to join, in order to help them counteract the global war that has resulted from a fight between Atlantis and Themiscyra, where Aquaman has flooded Western Europe and Wonder Woman has invaded the United Kingdom and renamed it New Themiscyra. The new league has to take out Aquaman and Wonder Woman to stop their war before it overwhelms the planet.

Barry's next move is to Gotham City. He needs answers and he figures that Batman is the most likely candidate to help him. He breaks into the Wayne Manor, and into the Batcave,where he finds a very angry Batman. Barry tries to convince him of the truth, that something in the past has caused the present to be drastically altered. And if this isn't corrected, the world may come to an end. Allen persuades Wayne to give him a chance and they try to recreate the accident that led to him becoming the Flash in the first place. After one spectacular failure, a second attempt succeeds.

Meanwhile, in New Themiscyra, Colonel Steve Trevor is on the run. He was unable to locate the resistance or the ""package"" he was supposed to meet (Lois Lane, a prize-winning journalist who has been gathering intel for Cyborg). He is caught by Diana, Queen of the Amazons, and after he has told what he knows under the influence of the Lasso of Truth, he is brutally hanged by that very lasso. In case it wasn't clear, this is most assuredly not a movie for young children.

A somewhat similar mission, led by Deathstroke and Luthor, to find Aquaman's doomsday weapon, ends in failure as Aquaman wipes out the ship and its crew, including some meta-humans that were part of the search. Back in the U.S., Cyborg pleads for more time but the President declines to give him the time. The U.S. military will act now, attempting to take out the WMDs before Aquaman can use them.

In a flashback with no words, we see snapshots of some of the events that led up to the present day. Arthur and Diana meet as rulers of two peoples but are smitten with one another and have an affair. Queen Mera catches them and is overwhelmed with grief and rage. She attacks Diana but is killed in the conflict between them. A bloodthirsty Diana cuts off her head and takes her tiara as her own. A grieving Arthur broods over the body of his queen. A young Bruce Wayne is killed in Crime Alley as his father subdues the gunman and his mother succumbs to madness. A spaceship from Krypton lands but it lands in Metropolis, too far away for Jonathan and Martha Kent to reach it. Abin Sur's ring doesn't select anyone on earth... Well, you get the drift.

Time travel and altered future stores are practically a clich, going back decades in science fiction stories. The best of these stories take a single pivot pint and then extrapolate from that point. What if Hitler hadn't invaded Russia? What if JFK hadn't been assassinated? What if the 2000 Florida vote count had gone the other way? I'm not going to reveal the tipping point, nor the individual who changed it, but I will say that the one major flaw in this film, as in the original comic, is that the tipping point has little to do with what happened next. They attempt to explain this by saying that when you break the time barrier, there's a ""time boom, ripples of distortion radiated out from the point of impact."" It's ironic...all the unbelievable things in this movie and this is the one I have trouble with?

Back to the movie: this is a dark, apocalyptic vision of the future, brutal and bloody. Barry watches, as one after the other, his allies are brought down and his hopes are dashed in an all-out war between the Amazons and Atlantis until, at last, the ultimate weapon is unleashed, destroying all before it. Barry has just one last desperate chance to save the world, a chance bought with the sacrifice of one of those allies. The coda on this film is very moving, a fitting end and a redemption of sorts.

Despite my gripes about the tipping point, this is an all-too-believable conflict between two warrior peoples, between two stubborn and proud leaders, in a world gone mad. It's a riveting story, particularly for the comic book fan as we look for clues to what happened to our favorite characters in this world. Superman? Check. Hal Jordan? Check. And so on. The animation is superb and the voice acting is very well done. There are no major standouts other than, perhaps, Kevin McKidd as both Batmans, but there are also no weak links. The story is tense and exciting and, all told, this is easily in the top five of the DC Universe animated movies.",1392076800,2,7799,4.562142857142857
5719963,5,B00CENSU1W,An interesting view if things had gone slightly different. One of the most thought provoking and emotional of the DC Animated films. Definitely not for young children.,1391990400,,167,5.222222222222222
5719964,3,B00CENSU1W,"Time travel stories are always a trick to get through, The Flashpoint Paradox was no different.  There was no clear nod/event/action to the audience that Barry Allen had taken any sort of action that changed the course of time. It simply has Barry wake up at his workstation and run out of the office to slip and fall on the steps, only to find his mother waiting for him.  Barry quickly finds (after a 13 mile trip from Central City to Gotham City) that in addition to not having his speed abilities that Bruce Wayne was killed on that fateful night, and Dr. Thomas Wayne became Batman, and Bruce's mother was driven mad by the murder of Bruce that she has become this world's Joker.  Oh and by the way, Aquaman and Wonder Woman have an affair which causes Aquaman's wife to seek revenge on Wonder Woman (why she did not attack her husband, who knows) only to have Wonder Woman take her head - which sparks war between the Amazons and the Atlantians.

Dr. Thomas Wayne's Batman seems closer to the Batman originally envisioned by Bob Kane back in the first days of the comics where Batman did carry guns.  The edge of Dr. Thomas Wayne drinking throughout (presumably due to the loss of his son and wife) gives a bit of a humanity of a doctor turned casino owner, but that's about it.

Cyborg serves as this world's version of ""Superman"" since Barry's action also resulted in Clark's ship crash-landing in Metropolis and the government locking him up in a vault under lights that replicate the spectrum of light from a red sun.  Batman even goes so far as to refer to Cyborg as a ""metal boyscout"".

All is finally made right by Batman killing Thawn (the evil version of Barry Allen) so that Barry Allen can time travel and stop himself from going back in time to stop his mother's murder.

Once you get through the credits, you get a tease for Justice League: War.  The animation is awkward at many times, Aquaman's head looks like a block with a face drawn on it; just as one example.",1391990400,,1985,4.473684210526316
5719965,4,B00CENSU1W,"Good enough. Fans of Flash may rate higher. Ok, here comes the spoiler for non Flash fans who debate seeing it. Batman uses chemically propelled projectile weapons and kills the speedster in an electric chair. Or does he?",1391990400,,221,4.842105263157895

5719967,5,B00CENSU1W,"I like the movie. After the timeline changed Aquaman looked like he was on steroids Hes twice as big as he was in the museum scene and his neck is gone i guess he was having roid rage that would explain why he was so ruthless.
I didn't care for the anime style too much but i still enjoyed the movie. It proves Flash can hold his own movie animated or live action. And I noticed his suit changed at the end.

I cant wait for Justice League War though. I bet it will be the best one yet.",1391904000,,486,3.909090909090909
5719968,2,B00CENSU1W,"Scientifically it is interesting. However the story line is still blurred, why did the amazonianz start fighting atlantis? The theme is nice but I think it could have been placed/narrated better",1391904000,,194,5.290322580645161
5719969,5,B00CENSU1W,"Another movie adaptation of a graphic novel.  Except this is the first time I enjoyed the movie more than the print version.  Let me first start off with saying that this is the most violent of all movies I've seen about the Justice League and should have been rated R.  However, it was a necessary element of the storyline and to the moral of the story.  It's the age old theory that messing with history will have mass implications on the timeline and in most cases, very adversely.  For those that have not read the novel, I will not go into the story as I believe not knowing the details of the paradox adds to the enjoyment.  Once you see the paradox and the implications of trying to change time, I think you will agree with me that the violent aspects of the movie were necessary to drive the moral of the story.  Overall, the animation was done well and the voice acting was superb.  Next to the JL and JLU animated series, this is my favorite animated superhero movie.",1391904000,,977,4.388888888888889
5719970,4,B00CENSU1W,"This movie is the movie that I've been wanting to watch for a long time. Like most DC straight-to-DVD, this movie is worth renting instead of buying. This storyline got to me at the end, after Barry fixed everything, with the help of Batman of course. Batman, in the alternate universe, is Thomas Wayne, Bruce's dad, and Martha Wayne is, apparently Joker. Though, sad to say, the movie doesn't really show her as the Joker like I thought it was, it's one of those things that it's implied that's she the Joker. Wonder Woman is a bitch, that was a shocker. Then the way Shazam is, like he's not just Billy Batson. And Aquaman looks super buff with a thick neck that even his trident can't pierce it. Overall, this is a movie that comic fans should, or must watch.",1391904000,,762,4.45
5719971,4,B00CENSU1W,Excellent movie. Very violent but a great story line. I love that the flash is the center of tje story.,1391731200,,103,4.2
5719972,5,B00CENSU1W,"I really enjoyed this. The story was good, the animation was excellent, and the realism was exactly the reason I look for these kinds of releases. In many ways, these are more realistic than live action films, because they allow for more probable outcomes during the super hero battles...eg. people actually get hurt and die from the battles. I'm not a violence nut, but scifi & fantasy should minimuze the intellectual jump (although there was still one or two items that stretched it a bit).

PS - I'm much more of a marvel fan than a DC fan, and yet I'd say this is the best story of this nature that I've seen to date outside of Ultimate Avengers (the first one). which Justice League War is pretty much a DC copy of that show.",1391644800,,731,4.4148148148148145
5719973,5,B00CENSU1W,"So far my favorite DC animated film is ""Batman: Under the Red Hood"".  A friend of mine knew this sentiment and told me about this movie.  I watched it and was extremely impressed.  The storyline had some unexplained loopholes, but the for most part everything seemed somewhat logical.  The villains in the movie surprised and entertained me most!!!!  A must watch.",1391558400,,364,4.901639344262295
5719974,4,B00CENSU1W,"Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox is the 17th DC Comics animated film from Warner Brothers and is based on the Flashpoint storyline written by longtime Flash scribe Geoff Johns.  While its titled a Justice League film, thats more for marketing than anything as this is a Flash film all the way with only brief appearances by the JLA, or at least the JLA as we know them.

You know, for a company that came up with Crisis on Infinite Earths nearly thirty years ago in an effort to clean up its universe of all its parallel worlds and the problems it created, they sure to like to create brand new alternate world storylines.  We are so many iterations removed from the Pre-Crisis DC Comics that you couldn't find it on even the most up-to-date GPS system.

The Flash, (the Barry Allen version which I have to point out BECAUSE of Crisis to begin with), arrives on the scene at a break-in at the Flash Museum and is confronted by his Rogues Gallery: Captain Cold, Captain Boomerang, Heat Wave, Mirror Master, and Top.  However the entire group of villains has been duped by Professor Zoom, the Reverse Flash, who intends to blow up Central City, including the Rogues.  The JLA arrives to help foil the plot and disarm a series of bombs.

The following day, Barry wakes up to find he is in an alternate world where he was able to save his mother from being killed,but one in which the world has radically changed for the worse.  Bruce Wayne is dead, killed in the alley when he was a boy and instead it is his father Thomas, who has become a more violent version of Batman.  There is no Superman or Green Lantern, and Wonder Woman leads the Amazons into battle against Aquaman and the Atlanteans in a war that threatens to destroy the entire world.  On top of that, Barry no longer has his powers.

Barry arrives at Wayne Manor looking for Bruce Wayne only to find it abandoned.  Descending to the Bat Cave, hes attacked by Thomas Wayne.  Barry is able to convince Wayne that he is from an alternate world and deduces that Zoom has used the speedforce to alter time and is preventing him from running fast enough to return the world to normal.

Cyborg, who now works for the government, gathers a group of heroes including Grifter, Billy Batson, and Etrigan to fight Wonder Woman.  Meanwhile Lex Luthor and Deathstroke lead a group of villains against the army of Atlantis.  Barry also discovers that a meteor fell to Earth in the heart of Metropolis thirty years earlier, coinciding with Superman arriving on Earth in Barrys world.

Im torn on this film.  Theres much to like but also some nagging issues.  The film gives us the Flashpoint story, streamlined to its core, sans all the unnecessary side plots of the crossover comics and thats a good thing.  Its also great to see the Flash, especially the Barry Allen Flash, get a chance to shine even if it is disguised as a Justice League film.  For once he is treated like one of the primary heroes of the DCU rather than a second-rater.

Ive long complained that many of the DC films have been geared towards kids rather than more adult comic book fans.  Not so with this film.  This is the most brutal of any of the DC films.  Wonder Woman mercilessly hangs Steve Trevor with her golden rope until his neck snaps.  While this and several other deaths take place just off camera, the mere fact that their taking place at all lets you know this is a different animal than previous DC films.

The animation is a mixed bag.  There is the same Anime influence here that we saw in the last DC film, Superman: Unbound and once again there are wild inconsistencies in the character models.  Superman, Etrigan, and Aquaman look like they were done by crossing Rob Liefeld with Mike Sekowsky and then giving them a hyper dose of HGH.  Big, blocky, overly muscled and ugly!  On the other hand, The Flash and Batman fare much better.  Director Jay Oliva packs the film with far too many supporting characters and in giving all of these characters screen time, it detracts from the central storyline.  Flash working with Batman to return to his world was far more interesting than the non-stop battles between the heroes, villains, Amazons, and Atlanteans.

A vast improvement over Superman: Unbound was in the voice cast.  Kevin Conroy returns to voice the regular world Batman with Kevin McKidd doing a fine job as the tortured Thomas Wayne version of Batman.  Justin Chambers gives us a Flash that is more mature than what weve seen in other films and the Justice League animated show.  Other standouts included C. Thomas Howell as Professor Zoom, Ron Perlman as Deathstroke, and Cary Elwes as Aquaman with Dana Delaney returning to voice Lois Lane.

In the end there are some missteps along the way but Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox is finally the kind of adult-themed film that many fans have wanted.

5719975,4,B00CENSU1W,"This is another good animated film from DC. It's not my favorite, but I don't have any real complaints against it (that's a ringing endorsement, right?). I like that the animation style is different, though it took a little bit to get used to the character designs (very exaggerated torsos). The story is pretty decent, though some explanation for the last couple of scenes could be in order (well, the last scene clearly sets up a sequel, but the scene with Batman and Flash could use something).",1391212800,,497,4.724137931034483

5719981,5,B00CENSU1W,"The DCAU films are stories that I hold dear to me and each one is always a great watch. After The Dark Knight Returns I had mentioned how curious I was to see where these films would go after such an intense film. Well, now we have 'Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox' and I must say I never would have expected this to be what it was.

Of course the basis of this film is Justice League Flashpoint, the saga that unleashed The New 52. It is a great story about The Flash a character who has yet to truly be developed in the DCAU. Sure, we got a few inklings in Justice League and even in Young Justice, but even though this film has Justice League in the title it is truly about the Flash. I always enjoy a DC alternative universe story, but this one is very different from 'Crisis on Two Earths'. This one is darker, has more intensity from a story and character stand point and unexpected graphic violence. I never would have expected to see so many cartoon characters bleed so much. The story is truly original and gripping and probably the best part of this film is Carey Elwes as the voice of Aquaman. The character is subtle yet fierce. The Batman character is definitely one way to never look at The Dark Knight the same way again. Also the voice of the '80s teen idol C. Thomas Howell as Professor Zoom  is a great villain.

This film is a true winner for any fan of the DCAU. If you have been watching the DCAU as far back as the Batman days, there are definitely a lot nods a few of the shows in Bruce Timm's legacy. All in all 'The Flashpoint Paradox' is incredible and I was so surprised that it ended up being the kind of film that it was and it may in fact be one of the better ones. With 'Justice League: War' up next this one sets it up bringing us into the world that Flash created in order to save his old one.",1390521600,,1833,4.157746478873239

DC half hour animated cartoons are the best. Bar none. Marvel may hold motion picture bragging rights but their cartoons cannot compare to DC. Period. Great example. I watched all 4 DVDs of Disney/ Marvel Avengers Earths Mightiest Heroes. Fun cartoons. I had a blast. But I as I compared them to Batman TAS, Superman TAS, or Justice League and JLU -  I realized something... The Avengers cartoons were forgettable. I can recall titles, quotes, and other dialogue from the DC cartoons...  but zilch for Earths Mightiest Heroes. I invite you to watch the ""Comfort and Joy"" episode from Justice League. You're in for a treat. Now for this review. The Flashpoint Paradox is a pure Flash story. There's a seen where different villains have bombs attached to them. It's fun to see the new and inventive ways the JLA find ways to thwart the villainous plot.  Great movie. A must watch.",1388102400,,1041,4.708791208791209

This is based on the New 52 material, of which I am not a fan, but if you like the New 52, then you'll probably like this.

EDIT:  When I originally reviewed this, it truly was the worst of the Justice League movies, but since then, DC animation has outdone themselves with 'JLA Adventures: Trapped in Time' to take the title.  Also, I can't decide which is worse between Flashpoint Paradox and Justice League: WAR.  JL:Throne of Atlantis doesn't appeal to me after JL:WAR, so I haven't watched it yet.

5720020,3,B00CENSU1W,"This was more violent than I expected. Had it not been animated, I think it would have merited an R rating. Pretty dark, and I'm still not sure exactly why.

Flash is a fun character, and I'm glad they finally told a story about him. Of course, the Flash they focused on was Barry Allen, and the show seemed to assume that viewers know a lot about him when I knew next to nothing. (The Flash I was familiar with is Wally.) Barry seemed...I don't know. Maybe too much like the others? I knew how Wally worked within the Justice League, but we hardly see anything of Barry and his world before we're launched into a dystopian alternate universe. Watching him in action was cool, but I didn't feel like I got much of a sense of him as a person.

But the bigger problem was the larger story. I don't know whether I want to watch it again simply because I watch to be entertained and enjoy myself, not to make myself sick watching people kill or torture each other or being depressed with messages about how awful people are or life is. (I'm exaggerating a little, but not as much as I wish I was.) The story never answered critical questions. For example...

SPOILERS

Flash's attempt to use time travel through the Speed Force to prevent the murder of his mother is somehow responsible for all of the problems that have come about in this alternate universe. But I thought what caused the problems wasn't saving his mother in itself, but the act of breaking the chronal barrier? If so, catching up to his younger self and stopping him wouldn't have prevented any of this because his younger self had already broken that barrier. And it doesn't explain how Flash's actions could change so many things that happened at different times. (Ex: Superman's arrival as a baby, the shooting of Bruce's parents, the arrival of Abin Sur and Hal taking on the mantle of the Green Lantern. Nit pick, but why would the ring not have found Hal even if the timing had changed a little and he wasn't right there?)

Then too, the story never explains critical changes in characters, specifically Wonder Woman and Aquaman. Those who developed this plot clearly don't take them seriously as heroic characters, because they have these guys go to the dark side and way above and beyond in destroying the world and others based on a tragic but isolated incident, a personal feud. The plot relies on neither of them having any sense of proportion or any concern for the impact of their conflict on the earth and on their peoples, when that is about as uncharacteristic for both of them as it gets. None of that made any sense. Heroism may be developed and fostered by associating with high-caliber people, but it comes from what's already there in people. Yet this story never explains why these characters are suddenly and somehow without any sense of morality.

In any case, well-done in a lot of ways, but disturbing and with some serious plot holes so far as I'm concerned.",1386115200,,2950,4.577651515151516

Less cartoonish and more realistic, almost Anime. It took some time getting used to but it wasn't bad by any stretch.
I won't ruin the story but it's pretty great to see a DC hero other than Superman or Batman getting the spotlight even though an alternate version of Batman is featured pretty heavily in the film.
But this is definitely a Flash story and he is the main hero. Now if only Warner Bros and DC could get their act together and start getting heroes like The Flash, Wonder Woman, Aquaman etc in LIVE ACTION FILMS everything would be right with the world.",1385510400,2,834,4.641891891891892

I am now going to catch up on the New 52. If the books are as good as this DVD I am in for one hell of a ride...,1385078400,,475,3.712871287128713
5720034,5,B00CENSU1W,"The DC Animated Universe movies continue to come out, thanks to no shortage of good stories and a penchant for decent adaptations of those stories. ""Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox"" is number 17 and it's by far one of the best, almost dethroning ""Under the Red Hood"" as my favorite of the flicks. I say almost because I can't really supplant that story so they will have to reign together.

""Flashpoint Paradox"" is an adaptation of the companywide crossover ""Flashpoint"" from DC a few years back written by Geoff Johns and drawn by Andy Kubert. The end of the story effectively rebooted the DC Universe and gave us the current status quo, known as the DCnU (DC new Universe) or New 52 (after the number of launch titles when the reboot happened). Costumes changed (Superman lost his underoos), and histories were retconned, and it was glorious. But that's for another time, this is about ""Flashpoint Paradox"" and the jaw dropping greatness of it.

Though the title has ""Justice League"" in it this is very much a story about everyone's favorite Speedster, the Flash. I mean his name is part of the title. The story begins with Flash (Justin Chambers, ""Grey's Anatomy"")  having to take on a group of his villains, collectively referred to as ""The Rogues,"" and when he's outgunned he calls for the Justice League for back-up. When his opposite number and arch nemesis Professor Zoom aka The Reverse Flash (C. Thomas Howell, ""Amazing Spiderman"") makes a statement that hits a little too close to home Flash goes for a run. When he wakes up the next day things have changed drastically. He is in a world where the Justice League or Superman never existed, Cyborg is the country's greatest hero, Batman is a gun carrying vigilante, and the Amazons and Atlantis are about to begin a war that will destroy the planet. Without his powers Flash, now just plain old Barry Allen must figure out what has happened to the world before it's too late.

To give away any more of the story would be almost criminal. If you don't know the details finding them out as you go along is definitely part of the fun with this story. The other part is seeing completely different versions of your favorite characters. Wonder Woman (Vanessa Marshal returning to the role from ""JL: Crisis on Two Earths"") and Aquaman (Cary Elwes, ""Saw, ""Princess Bride"") are much darker characters than we're used to seeing, and their titles Queen of the Amazons and King of Atlantis are front and center, as are their militaristic ambitions. Batman (Kevin McKidd, ""Percy Jackson,"" ""Grey's Anatomy"") is a completely different person, so it makes his change a little easier to deal with. And we again get some Cyborg (Michael B. Jordan, ""Chronicle) which is always good, and he gets to be the hero of the country here. The rest of the cast is good even if they don't get a lot to say with Dana Delany, Nathan Fillion and Ron Perlman returning to voice the characters of Lois Lane, Green Lantern Hal Jordan and Deathstroke from ""Superman: The Animated Series,"" ""Justice League: Doom"" and ""Teen Titans"" respectively. Danny Huston also has a bit part as General Sam Lane. Andrea Romano does it yet again, and Jay Oliva's direction is perfect.

The animation is just fantastic with character designs by Phil Burassa who did designs for the last two Justice League animated films as well as the ""Young Justice"" series. These though are some insanely built heroes, but they still look amazing, not like when the drawings in ""Superman/Batman: Public Enemies"" where they came off looking like ""Masters of the Universe"" figures being animated. This is more like Japanese animation mixed with American comic art. The action is intense too. I mean REALLY intense. There are some pretty violent and brutal fights and scenes in this. Definitely earns it PG-13 rating. I found myself slackjawed a few times throughout the film. DC definitely pushed the envelope this time, and it was well worth it. The story is what really keeps you intrigued though, and the humanity that it illustrates among these powerful beings, and as I said this is Flash's story and following him through this dark, strange world is a real journey.

This was a really fun flick and if you've been a fan of these so far, this one definitely won't disappoint you. The only issue I had was that it got me wanting to see more alternate takes on the characters, and DC has a whole line called Elseworlds and they've got a few great stories that would be amazing animated, but I digress. Anyway, this film has an after credits scene that leads directly into the next film, ""Justice League: War"" which makes sense as it tells of the origin of the JL in the DCnU, so I look forward to it. As usual, the special features were few but the featurettes are good, and the classic episodes are always fun. So definitely pick this up if you want to watch a great action flick, with some heart, amazing visuals, and a few surprises too.",1385078400,,4942,4.72737819025522

5720042,5,B00CENSU1W,"DC Animation is always top notch and this is no exception. Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox is the best one yet. Even though this is an animated movie it was simply made for young adults and does not pander, nor apologize for it. From the very beginning the tone set was a little dark and by the end of the film its was downright arcane. A must see for any DC, Marvel, comic-fan, or anyone who enjoys a good movie.",1384646400,,420,4.2625
5720043,4,B00CENSU1W,"Interesting take, this movie uses the ""New 52"" re-launch of all the DC  characters. I do not care for the re-boot. It is sort of an insult to older fans, destroying continuity and negating the creativity of past authors, artists and colorists who worked on these books for decades.

That said, the movie does touch somewhat on Chaos Theory, and show that a single act can cause major and unanticipated changes in history. In line with most DC comics animated fare the story line is very dark, much like the ""What If?"" books in the Marvel line 20-30 years ago, where any real change in events resulted in the end of the world. Art work is superb, the voice acting is good, and the story holds together.

Without revealing too much of the story, it goes like this --- Flash inadvertently creates a whole new timeline when he goes back to fix a tragedy in his past. When he wakes up the next day, he has no powers, there's no Justice League and the whole world as he knew it has been altered.

I've been collecting comics for 37 years now, my childhood friend is Jae lee and I have almost every Batman graphic novel known to man - I'm not saying I'm a expert but I know my comics and a few things I appreciate about FP.

1. The stay true to the nature of the comic character. The Flash is still comic relief even in a dystopian future. WW is a great militaristic antagonist. Superman... well, he's the wild card in all this. But Batman.... good Lord, I love what they did to Batman - gawd he's as previous in the movie as Flash.

2. It is an adult, brutal gore fest of a movie. Lots of blood and shows how wicked brutal war can be. Not a fan of how they handled Lex and Deathstroke tho... it was... anti-climatic.

3. For an animation, it does a pretty good job at pulling on the heart strings - I won't give spoilers, but there's some aww moments.

Zoom is a maniac just like a lot of people in the world and it works here. The best part is when the Flashpoint world is about to end and Thomas Wayne tells him to make it right. That and the letter to Bruce. If you are passionate about comics look at this. It's a classic. Too short to tell the whole Flashpoint comic but still a classic.,1382918400,,477,4.139784946236559
5720067,1,B00CENSU1W,as much as i love the FLASH as my best superhero compare to boring run to the ground BATMAN and superman  this flash  was not as i expected him to be.  a flash from another universe sort of.  im not saying the flash in this animation  from another universe  imm saying  the whole movie is nothing we seen before from DC comic.  batman is not batman but thomas whyne  bruce father is batman. Aqua-man beat the snot out of wonder woman  REALLY??? few other unbelievable action in stored  my review 2 thumbs down.  if this was a movie at theather  i would not recommend the dvd  how bad it is.,1382918400,,590,4.245454545454545
5720068,5,B00CENSU1W,"This is the most adult DC Movie out there - Surprisingly violent, brutal, and not mention has a great alternate universe storyline.
I've never been a big fan of the big mouthed Flash feeling his powers were ultimately miniscule compared with the rest of JL but this movie redeems him and really shows that he can be the lead in a movie (although Central City and it's villains are still a joke).
The animation was the best they've produced (although this isn't my favorite version of Wonder Woman), and the voice acting was on point.

5720072,5,B00CENSU1W,"While I haven't read the Flashpoint comic book event that was instrumental in rebooting the entire DC Universe to its New 52 incarnation, this movie is probably the best thing in condensing the storyline to the point where it touches on the most important things that happened in it: namely, Flash wakes up and finds that his world has been radically changed, with Superman not being the prime superhero that causes and inspires others to work together for the greater good, among other things. It's a rare treat to see this important storyline in DC Universe history get the animated treatment that it deserves, and the quality of the animation is excellent. It still makes me wonder what DC and Warner would do if they were charged with bringing the older Crisis On Infinite Earths to animated life, though I would bet it would take up a total of four installments to do the whole thing justice.",1382486400,,897,4.719745222929936

5720074,4,B00CENSU1W,"I'd recommend buying this if anyone wants a dark, violent story revolving around The Flash (Barry Allen) and some recognizable DC characters like Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Deathstroke, Cyborg and some obscure characters like Grifter from the WildStorm universe. The story was overall interesting even though I found world domination kind of cliche, pacing was good with rarely dull moments, voice acting was superb and well-done, and fight scenes were great and full of action. It pretty much made me a fan of Barry Allen as The Flash.

BE WARNED:
Some of the deaths are brutal, especially at the end which I won't spoil. I wouldn't recommend this to a younger audience as to those who see some characters like Wonder Woman or Aquaman usually being good instead they're villains in this film.",1382400000,,797,4.992481203007519

With 'Flashpoint Paradox', DC Animation has elevated itself to producing the best DC superhero movies, with the lone exception of Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight' trilogy.

The story is a powerful one, of the nature of accepting things we can't change; and, the harm we can do to ourselves and others when we won't. Of course, being a superhero movie, this simple bromide is manifested in Flash losing his powers, an apocalyptic war between Wonder Woman and Aquaman, and a shocking alteration to the Batman timeline.

The direction/editing is crisp, the story compelling and the voice acting is superb. I would have given it 5 stars, except for its slavish conformity to the current  fashion of making American animation look like Japanese anime. The animation is very good...but, I like to see characters animated in the style of their own culture (so, sue me).

I'm a Geek and proud of it, I was there when The Fantastic Four 1st appeared and Peter Parker was first bitten, when the Flash first ejected his custom from his ring and I hate this movie! One, the story is so full of holes it could sink a battleship...so what he goes back in time a saves his mother (just when does this happen?) what does that have to do with Wonder Woman or Aquaman, they are both older then his mother, Wonder Woman by a few thousand years, why would this change they personalities or beliefs.. and Batman was ""created"" years before her death (the mother's). Two, the design work is freaky, down right eerie. Three, and this is the most important, it's the principal...superheros have always been above the law in that no matter what they ""shall not kill"", that they are someone(s) to look up to, to admire..this thing spits in the face of all of that! If this is the future of comics (and by all the reviews, it sound like it might be) then count me out! Look what they did to Superman!(and again, why would her death make any of these changes!?!) Until now I used to believe that Marvel made the best live action movies and DC, the best animated movies..as soon as one came out I would grip it up sight unseen, well not any more. With all the killing and mass murders depicted in this ""film"" maybe they're right about the violence in todays comics..spoiler alert..if you haven't seen this ""movie"" yet...don't! But if you do think about it, be prepared to see Wonderwoman hang her ex-lover, kill children, and cut off a woman's head and carry it around as if it was a purse...she's a nut case and Aquaman is even worst. If I could of I would have given this thing a minus star, and anyone who likes this movie should be ashamed of themselves.

I must warn you that it is rather graphic. normally in these cartoons if someone gets shot you just see the hand in a awkward position, well in this movie you see the body with the bullet wound in it. with that said, if you like justice league type cartoon movies you will like this.",1381708800,2,627,4.233333333333333

5720100,5,B00CENSU1W,"I absolutely enjoyed this animated feature because it actually followed some of the elements that were key moments in the original storyline included in the comic book series that this feature is based on.  What I dislike a lot of times when it comes to animating features like this one is that the writers have to ""downsize"" the story because of the adult contents which a lot of kids would find confusing or not understand unless they read the actual comic book which a lot of kids cannot.  Otherwise, my love of these animated features is what I look forward to when I go to Amazon.com and look up certain animated features that I hear about finally coming out on DVD.  Another reason, of course, is because of my love of Saturday morning cartoons when they were great. (this would be back in the mid-60s).  I have always had a love of Saturday Morning Cartoons and animated features ever since I watched my first animated TV show when I was a little kid.  Nowadays, I look forward to any animated superhero feature, depending on whether or not I remember the character from the ""old days"".

5720101,5,B00CENSU1W,"Many a fan boy has been waiting for The Flash to grab a starring role in a DC animated movie. He generally shares screen time with the rest of the Justice League and while incarnations of JL members do appear in The Flashpoint Paradox, this feature most definitely belongs to Flash over anyone else. The Flashpoint Paradox takes place in another dimension, one altered due to events changed by Barry Allen/The Flash. The creative team behind this movie did an excellent job at changing the characters and animation style just enough to give the viewer a since of altered universe. The animation itself leans more toward an Anime style, which can be jarring at first, especially if you've watched the previous DC animated films. Flashpoint's story and narrative hook quickly draws you in and you begin to realize the beauty of this animation style.

For those that haven't read the comic book series the film is based on, I would highly recommend it, at the last the central story and the off-shoots involving the main characters. The number of characters that appear in the comic book series and actually made their way into the movie is really impressive. Almost all of your favorites are there, some if only for a scene or two, but every characters helps in showing the audience just how much this world has changed.

Highly recommended animated film. Not suitable for children.",1381190400,,1380,4.843220338983051

5720109,5,B00CENSU1W,"This is hands down the best Superhero Animated film I have ever seen. The film takes place in a parallel universe of earth where there is no Justice  League.  The characters who compromise the core members exist but they  are in different roles.  Bruce Wayne is dead, his father  is a darker twisted version of Batman. Hal Jordan is not the Green Lantern but just a test pilot.  There is no Flash. Superman, as we know him, does not exist. And Wonder Woman and Aquaman  and the kingdoms they each represent are embroiled in a war which threatens to destroy the world.

I've seen the parallel/alternate universe concept done in comics before. However  most of the time it is done very poorly with no effort or real thought that has gone in to it. There is also no attempt to delve deeply into the alternate universe and show how the world is different. Most of the time the worlds are just reduced into mock ups of totalitarian regimes.  Consisting of some hackneyed plot about the heroes trying to take down the evil government.

However this film is a refreshing change from this boring type of storytelling.  The characters are fleshed out and given serious motivations for their actions and behavior.  Characters actions are far more human than what are normally treated to in the DCU.  People actually do things out of pride, selfishness, and ego.  This went into giving the film more depth and made you care about the characters on screen. For example Wonder Woman and Aquaman's actions are the exact type of actions I would expect to come from  two super powered beings with type A personalities.  They are both single minded in their pursuit of power and vengeance but at the same time strategic.

The production values are fantastic. With great jobs in the voice acting as well as the animation.  But most of all I have to give top marks to the writer of the film Jim Krieg who not only used the source material from the original books, but also borrowed some of the accompanying books in order to make the story and the background more clear to the viewers.

I was never a fan of The Flash until I saw this film. However this film really made me fall hard and fast for Barry Allen.  He had a great combination of a great heart yet a still commanding strength.  In all this is a superb production  and I certainly look forward to more such quality of work.",1380931200,,2364,4.536643026004728

The style itself reminds me of anime and is more violent than previous movies but I'm not complaining.  The topic was a World War S (superhero), and war is not without extreme cruelty and violence so it added to the feel. In a word -- Epic.
So what I really like is how unapologetically Wonder Woman was portrayed as a Class A superhero/heavy hitter; or in this case antihero. Personally, I did not purchase JLA Doom because of just that -- the writers and producers seemed uncomfortable in making her formidable when her multiverse counterpart, Superwoman, can knock the Big S around. This movie exhibits her as the 2nd most powerful hero, Superman being No. 1.  Kudos for the balls.  I only hope that it continues, otherwise, I will only selectively purchase JLA movies.
I love too how the Flash is portrayed as an elite superhero. He seemed untouchable. His action sequences are stellarly stylized.
Overall, great story and great characters.  I just hope the next release continues the unapologetic Epic feel.",1380672000,,1108,4.877659574468085

Some things are worth pointing out, though, and these are just my opinions, so take them for what they're worth.

First of all, both Flash and Reverse Flash have time-traveled numerous times in the comics without creating a big ""time-boom"" that completely altered reality, nearly destroying the planet.  So why would this specific instance cause that to happen now? It's a head-scratcher.

Secondly, as great as this movie is, the concept has been done before.  I remember an episode of Superfriends where Superman went back in time via a black hole and saved Krypton from exploding.  When he returned to the present time, he discovered that earth was all screwed up and the Hall of Justice was in shambles...all because he was never sent to earth to become Superman. So he returned through the black hole and intentionally allowed Krypton to be destroyed in order to fix things.

There was another episode of Challenge of the Superfriends where the Legion of Doom went back in time to prevent Superman, Wonder Woman and Green Lantern from existing, so that they could return to the present time and have a huge advantage over the Justice League, who somehow figured out that history changed and fixed it so that the heroes would exist again (don't remember how).

Then if you look outside the DC universe, there's the alternate 1985 from Back to the Future II.  Biff stole the almanac and screwed up time, just like Flash saved his mom and screwed up time. Speaking of which, I love the little nod to Back to the Future, which happens when Batman connects two cables just as lightning has struck and electrified Flash's machine---the same thing Doc Brown had to do when the DeLorean passed under the suspended cable. Nice little wink at Steven Spielberg!

Anyway, my point is that this concept is nothing new that hasn't been done before, both in and out of the DC universe.  But you know what? Big deal. They took the concept and made an incredibly exciting, intense, gripping movie out of it, and the fact that they've pursued similar avenues in the past doesn't change that.

My second point is that I'm a huge Green Lantern fan...always have been.  It would have been awesome to see some kind of alternate bad-@$$ Green Lantern involved in the war, but hey, I didn't write the story, so I guess I just have to live with it.  Abin Sur's ring shot off into space to find a different successor. Bummer.

Thirdly, in the comics it is Reverse Flash who murders Barry's mom in the first place.  Yet the movie does not show that.  Who the murderer was is meant to be an irrelevant mystery.  I'm torn about the decision to leave that detail out.

But wow.  Bruce Wayne's DAD is Batman! His WIFE becomes the Joker! Superman was imprisoned and kept in secret isolation!  Some villains are now heroes, and at least two of our heroes are now villains! And for some reason, even though Reverse Flash is part of the alternate reality just like everyone else, he knows everything and drops a bomb by explaining to Flash that it's all his own fault, telling him exactly what he did and when he did it to cause all of the chaos. Then he proceeds to beat him to within an inch of his life while the war rages on! But Batman puts a stop to the madness by appearing out of nowhere and putting a bullet through Reverse Flash's head! Absolutely brilliant writing, great animation, and an exciting ending with the surprise addition of a tear-jerking moment as it all wraps up.

Take the PG13 rating seriously, folks. Not only is this movie violent, it contains profanity and sexual situations.  But just plain wow. This movie is outstanding, and should have hit the silver screen before going to video.  I'm obsessed with it and watch it multiple times a week. Thank you, DC, for one of the best movies in my collection!",1380585600,,4198,4.592493297587131

It is pg-13 for a reason. I love dc direct movies, have almost everyone of them in my collection. I will not watch them if my 9 year old is in the house, they are not meant for anyone under 13. This one in particular is very violent. A lot of people die in this and they die horribly. If you want to give it to your child watch it with them or before them.

5720127,3,B00CENSU1W,"Flashpoint was the event that catapulted DC's universe into the new 52.  Whether viewing as its own entity or as an adaptation of the graphic novel, it's still a big disappointment.

Strengths: alternate timelines give writers a license to play with characters.  Changes made with Batman, Lois Lane (watching her light things up as a member of the ""Resistance"" in a firefight was great), and Captain Marvel were fun.  The attempt to make Cyborg a major character, while feeling contrived, was a nice touch.  And the inclusion of minor characters (the Golden Age version of the Sandman as a part of the Resistance!) was a joy to watch.

Weaknesses: the entire premise of the Amazonian-Atlantean war was changed from the graphic novel, for the worst.  Major events in the movie happen for little or no reason, with little logic behind them.  How did Captain Atom get captured? (For that matter, why do we even have Captain Atom here - a major diversion from the graphic novel, only to serve as a plot device.)  Batman joins the trip to Europe (with a smile, no less) after one of the worst rallying speeches in the history of movies - are you kidding?

The biggest sin of this movie is that the whole reason for everything (literally) going to hell is never really fleshed out.  The pacing of the movie is so bad that you never get the opportunity to really care for the characters - the key to the entire story is the relationship between Flash and his mom, which felt glossed over.

I'm giving this 3 out of 5 stars because I'm a huge fan of DC stories and enjoy alternate timeline/universe tales.  I'm glad I watched it, but I can honestly say this isn't something I'm going to go back and watch again.  Given all of the interesting side-stories that were created around the graphic novel (such as Dick Grayson (Robin) becoming Dr. Fate and Abin Sur becoming a White Lantern), DC would have been much better served making this a short series rather than cramming everything into a movie.",1380326400,,1988,4.642857142857143

I won't go into the plot too much except it involves the Flash going fast enough to invoke time travel accidently and changing history which gets convoluted and confusing.

5720155,5,B00CENSU1W,"Just to preface this review, I collect comic books, and read the entire Flashpoint saga in comic form. That being said, this kept pretty close to the comic book version. There were of course some changes because if you included everything from the comic books, this animated movie probably would have gone on for over 3 hours.

The movie begins with Barry Allen (The Flash) at the grave of his mother, remembering the day she was murdered. He later stops The Rogues and Professor Zoom with the help of the Justice League. Zoom plants a seed in Barry's head about what he could do if he wasn't afraid.

Barry wakes up the next day and finds that he has no powers and his mom is alive. However, the rest of the world has changed drastically. Aquaman and Wonder Woman's forces prepare for war against each other. There is no Superman. Batman is alive, but is very different. Cyborg is this world's greatest superhero. There is no Green Lantern.

Eventually Barry find this world's Batman, and with his help, he gets his powers back. They get a squad together including Cyborg, Captain Thunder, and even find this world's Superman to help them try to prevent Wonder Woman and Aquaman from destroying this world, and finding Professor Zoom to try to get Barry back.

I only had 2 complaints about this animated movie. One is the animation style. Not one of the best, particularly Superman. Too blocky.

5720168,4,B00CENSU1W,"The way this movie started, even before the opening credits, made clear that it would have a darker tone similar to some of the latest DC Animated movies, even though its featuring the Flash, who would usually be portrayed as the jokester.  Its also not a solo Flash movie as other members of the Justice League play important roles too. Well, technically there is no Justice League, and the Batman we all know and love isn't Bruce Wayne, and he also has no problem using guns. This goes back to the quintessential point made at the start of the movie and was addressed by the Flashs mother when he was a kid. How much is affected from one event changing, and if we understood the impact of changing past events would we want to go back and change them? I felt the movie did an excellent job of addressing that question as the story progressed and there was never the sense that characters were portrayed differently just for the hell of it. So Batman being different made sense, Cyborg being in the role he was in made sense and the war between Aquaman and Wonder Woman, as the root of it was explained, fit in line with their stubbornness and arrogance at times. The absence of Superman and all he stood for was factored into this, and even the understanding of how much his presence indirectly kept others in check.

The story line was solid but of course with all these super powered beings in one movie, and with some at odds with each other, there would have to be some entertaining action to accompany it. And theres plenty of it and just about everyone gets in on the action including Grifter, Etrigan the Demon and Deathstroke. Even Lois Lane has good action sequences and they have nothing to do with Superman saving her. The heroes (including those who were villains in the regular timeline) have to stop Wonder Woman and Aquaman from basically destroying the entire planet after the death of hundreds of millions of people. So theres a war between the Atlanteans and Amazons with the remaining superheros caught in between and fighting both. So the current alliances fit in perfectly with the story and the Flash wouldnt be on the sidelines during this because he and Batman would attempt to give him his powers back by recreating the experiment that gave the Flash his powers in the first place. It felt good to see these intense and at times, graphic, action sequences taking place with no one holding back. Of course this couldn't be good for the planet.  And not to give any details that could be considered spoilers, although you pretty much have a general idea if youve read the comic book series despite some character changes, the ending is as satisfying as one would hope for while watching this movie.

All DC Animated Movies tend to be the same length and although Im sure there are many reasons for that, sometimes it feels as if there could be some additional minutes to elaborate on some of the finer aspects of the story line so it feels like a fuller experience. It doesnt take away from this being a great movie but I think it would give more for viewers to come back to for repeated viewing.

SUMMARY
Justice League: Flashpoint Paradox was a very entertaining movie and one I highly recommend for all fans of DCs animated movies. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect with some of the previous portrayals of the Flash in the Justice League series and movies but he was more developed in this one and held his own as the featured character. The story was great and unfolded perfectly while addressing the quintessential point raised in the beginning, as well as provided great enjoyment from seeing the various characters in action and fighting with their all. The different portrayals of the characters didn't feel one-dimensional and felt fully fleshed out. And there was a touching moment in the ending that at this particular time had even more meaning to me on a personal level. And as is the current trend with most superhero movies, theres even a glimpse afterward of whats to come as the result of events that occurred in this movie. This is definitely one you don't want to miss.",1378771200,2,4117,4.618852459016393
5720169,2,B00CENSU1W,"Look, here's the deal; if you have to travel through time, or to another dimension, to tell your story, you're officially out of ideas.

There is a reason the DC Universe has not translated as well to the big screen as Marvel.  Some of it is the depth of the characters, but, it's more the ability to tell stories and the stories they choose to tell.  The Green Lantern was not a good choice to be the next JLA member to put on film in 2011.

On July 30th 2013, Warner Home Video brought us Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox, and well, things have not gotten any better in the DC storytelling universe.

If this is not spoiled for you yet: Spoiler Alert!  So The Flash (Justin Chambers) wakes up in a world that looks like his own, but isn't.  He's not fast, Superman doesn't exist, Batman is old, and Wonder Woman's Amazons are doing battle with Aquamans Atlantians and destroying the world in the process.

So Barry Allen sets out to figure things out, and get back to where he belongs.  Seeking the wisdom and intelligence of Batman, he discovers that in this world, Bruce Wayne died in the alley on that fateful night and now his dad Thomas Wayne is Batman (Kevin McKidd).  First thing on the agenda; Re-create the ""accident"" that caused Barry Allen to become the Flash.  Then figure out what happened to Superman cuz we need him to stop the war.

Eventually things get worked out, but not before numerous unusual plotlines are introduced and not explored.

Regardless of how old you are, this is not the Justice League of your youth.  Partly because it is a timeline that none of us are familiar with, and hopefully won't become familiar with cuz it's lame, but also because this DC JLA story is more violent than any previous incarnation, and unnecessarily so.  Almost as if they knew the story was bad and decided it needed something to make it unique.

The animation and performances are of no help to this production.  The animation is awkward and inconsistent at best. Often reminiscent of Anime from the sixties, it seemed like Kimba could run by at any moment.  The performances were consistently stoic, but that was probably more the fault of the writers (Geoff Johns -Original Story, Jim -Screenplay) than the actors.

Recommendation:  The Flash remains under utilized in the DC universe, and what should have been a showcase for the talents and entertainment value of the speedster, lags far behind his potential.

We can hope that the Feature Film scheduled for 2016 will deliver, but until then, the cartoons of the sixties or the television show of 1990 will have to do.",1378771200,2,2593,4.654945054945055

The animation, for the most part was top notch (except for Aquaman, who looked like he had the mumps).  It was amazing that they were able to include so much from the various supporting series in such a short amount of running time, especially the inclusion of Batman, Superman, Hal Jordan, and the resistance with Lois in London.

It seems that he lost his mother early in life to a deadly home invasion, and his wanting to reconnect with her is understandable.  However, the chaos that follows is not.  By finding his mother, he is transported to a different universe than we know.  Batman is more gritter and using guns to stop crimes.  The Amazons and the Atlanteans are at war with each over, due to Wonder Woman killing Queen Mera.  I mean, it was so much going on, that Flash doesn't catch on that one of his greatest foes is following him and getting off on the gruesome events that is following him.

5720190,3,B00CENSU1W,"I love the Flash and was dying to see a movie where he was the main character.  Unfortunately, timeline themed plotlines have been done to death and the JL movies have done ""alternate"" realities before in which our favorite heroes are fighting other versions of themselves.  Those movies were well done but as a result those previous movies and incarnations have stolen a lot of the thunder from this movie.  You kinda get the ""been there done that"" vibe while watching.

Overall, the movie is entertaining and I liked it.  But compared to its predecessors and other DC animations, I think it rates a 3 out of 5.

I hate to say it, but this movie should have focused more on the conflict between Aquaman and Wonderwoman and they should have made that into a 3 film feature.  Truthfully, the Flash is treated more as a Dues de Machina plot device that resets everything to normal.

In any event, if you see this, you won't feel like you got robbed.  Its just that this film lacks the heart and imagination of its DC animated film predecessors.",1378339200,,1042,4.559139784946237

Almost no sexual content.

PROS
===

* Production Quality - Right off the bat, this was good animation and a quality production.  Action sequences were strong, art was interesting and well done.  A few moments felt choppy, but still a step forward for the DC animated movies.

* No shortcuts.  Unlike many action titles, Flashpoint Paradox didn't cut for the sake of cutting, or have an extra long sequence with no movement; they cut it when it was time to move to the next scene.  So many action titles can't get this rhythm right.  It's either too slow, too fast, or becomes becomes disjointed.  This production definitely delivers where others hesitate or flutter, similar to another DC title ""Crisis on Two Earths"" though in a different way.

* Excellent voice cast for The Flash.  I expected the always-pushing, punchline man from the Justice League series.  There, the Barry is cast as an entertaining representative of the short-attention span audience.  Instead, this movie offers a genuine hero with flaws and fears along side determination and strength.  Actor Justin Chambers struck the right tone here and deserves real credit.

===
CONS
===

* Dark and not in a way that other DC titles have taken a darker turn: this one was flimsy and forced.  It seemed like they had an already good story rewritten to fit the Christopher Nolan-inspired mold DC is trying to push into, rather than letting the story dictate it's own terms.  Dark is something the DC animation studios know how to do: ""Batman: Year One"" was a perfect example of how animation can tell a very human, very adult story.

* Seriously dark.  Wonder Woman kills someone in the 3rd act and it just went too far.  Roll it back, DC.

=== Unexplored characters ===

Poor execution:

  - The mother and wife really felt unexplored where they needed to explain the personal, human element behind Flash's decisions.

  - Villain was flat and boring.  Just full of hate and bile for no reason.  His defeat was unsatisfying and gruesome.

  - No time was spent on the Athenians vs. Aqua Man bit.  I didn't understand at any point why they were in an all-out war.

  - Lots of meaningless, dull cameos that felt like they were checking off boxes of required superheros.  I think Joss Whedon called this phenomenon ""Easter Eggs"" in reference to characters from the Avengers showing up in the S.H.E.I.L.D. TV show.

Missed opportunities:

  - Superman: in maybe the most interesting look at him I've yet seen, his appearance was slightly above cameo.

  - Green Lantern (from the very talented voice acting of Nathan Fillon and also did a good job on a recent Wonder Woman origin movie): appeared and quickly disappeared.

  - The Joker: again, utterly loaded with exciting possibility, and never got past the introduction.  Ouch.",1377820800,2,3125,4.842205323193916

5720221,5,B00CENSU1W,"Let me first start by saying this film is not for younger audiences. It contains graphic depictions of violence, sexual situations, and mature language.

Realizing how that is in and of itself a deterrent for some viewers, I argue that it is done with some taste and rather than trying to glorify violence it seeks to depict its savage nature, and not simplify the world for sake of the story. Additionally one must understand the intended audience is essentially my demographic. (Adult male,29 at the time of this writing). Most depictions of our favorite heroes while entertaining in their own right have, at least in cinema, lacked until recently, a certain sense of realism. Hence the recent wave of darker depictions of iconic characters. Every perspective to up until recently has been one aimed at a particularly young audience, and studios have begun to realize the potential in tapping that older audience. So, if you are not particularly partial to violent content you may want to steer clear of this viewing, but it is sophisticated enough that it warrants a chance.

In any event this is easily one of the better offerings in the DC animated universe, that deals with one of the central story arcs in the DC comics universe: The Flash Point Paradox.

I would argue that the nature of the story does not lend itself to those who are uninitiated to the DC universe. The very crux of the story is sort of a what if scenario for all of your favorite DC characters. Most of which in this case do not result in the same heroic roles as their mainstream counterparts. What happens if superman never landed in Smallville? What if Bruce Wayne never became Batman? What if earths greatest heroes were at war with one another? In other words while the cameos are numerous, there are very few glimpses of your favorites DC icons, in the way that you know and love them. However this seems only to further anchor the unique bond you have with the characters in their more familiar forms.

And fans of the flash are in for a treat. I admittedly did not grow up reading a lot of DC. Marvel had dominated the era I grew up in. I have however developed more insight as I have gotten older. Even still the Flash was never a character with which I particularly identified.

This is by far the most action the Flash has seen in the DC Animated Universe and he does not disappoint. I think for the first time (In animation) anyone who did not grow up idolizing the character is given a true sense of why he was one of the founding members of the Justice League and of his
overall importance in the DC universe. His bravery, bravado, and brash sense of humor are all on display, but tempered with a manic sense of purpose, and humility. It is a bit hard to watch, but strangely somehow seems to give root to the already fantastic nature of the DC universe.",1377820800,13,2846,4.55078125

Perhaps due to constraints in timing, the movie cuts out lots of interesting details from the comics, which leaves most of the plots unresolved, shallow, and/or incoherent.

Standing alone (that is to say, without any comparison to the comics plot on which it is based) the movie is still a pretty bad movie. It's extremely and gratuitously violent (at one point, we see *through* the hole left in a character's skull by a bullet to see the shooter), incoherent (it's very hard to understand why the war between Atlantis and Themyscra started in the first place, at least, it's hard to understand if you want a reasonable reason), and hopelessly grim and fatalistic.",1377820800,2,838,4.739726027397261

I thought this was a good, solid movie. The voice acting was great, the story flowed, and the animation was the quality I've come to expect from DC. Probably my least favorite thing about this movie was the way the faces were drawn, which is very nit-picky, I know! But aside from that it did not disappoint.

If you like DC animated films, good Justice League stories, or just good Flash stories, I highly recommend this movie!",1377734400,,538,4.536082474226804

*********  Spoiler Alert *********

This is Anime..... Yes DC took the last pure comic book movie and Anime it. So what do you do with Anime... Huge eyes, blood spatter, severed bodies, dissolving bodies. For instance Wonder Woman is extremely tall and skinny Big eyes rocking cos-play thigh high boots and at least G cup breasts yet couldn't way 100 lbs. That's an Amazon. Welcome to Anime.  cant believe its Anime but that said a great storyline. So they got that right. Seeing Superman Kill, Batman with a Gun (his father), Green Lantern well not chosen for Green Lantern duty. Captain Marvel Killed by Wonder Woman she even torture and kills her love interest Steve Rogers. Aquaman wiping out most of Europe. Wonder Woman and the Amazons taking over London and UK. Robin using a gun (the grafter)

Its paradox time story revolving around a choice Flash makes and Professor Zoom capitalizes on.

This movie is dark twisted and probably the scariest made so far. But Anime damn.....

IT is a well written movie though with dark twists and even brief original voice talents hosted as well....

If the next one is Anime like this I WILL NOT being watching or buying it.

Ok well Animeish its influenced by it but still unrealistic. Who would be afraid of a 7ft Wonder Woman that's a 100.lbs?",1377648000,,1592,4.613475177304965

I would never do something like this. the best part of the whole movie is about the first 15 minutes, Flash goes to his museum and takes on the bad guys.

If people like graphic and really dark things this is for you, if you'd actually like to enjoy the comic book heroes you've grown up watching. Find something else",1377561600,4,485,4.282608695652174

Thomas Wayne and Aquaman look like they were injected with insane amounts of steroids...beck, even their necks are bigger than their heads. Barry is the only character that looks normal. I believe this is why Bruce Finn left DC Animated. This style is crap. The storyline is pretty close to the comics with a few differences that don't ruin the overall arc.

Part of the fun is seeing characters that fans are familiar with, presented in a different light, so not sure if a casual viewer would enjoy it as much.

Not gonna spoil it for you if you haven't seen it, it covered a bunch of the Flashpoint comic offshoots, changed a bit of the story for continuity, and it will still get you right in the feels.  My only problem is that, being a fan of the comic books, this could have been a mini-series easily and some of the story arcs are condensed in the movie, as many of the other comic to movie crossovers seem to do, like Justice League Doom.

The artwork is great and seeing how an alternate future albeit 1 of many turns out is always fun. DC turned out another gem.

Otherwise, it's a great story and we loved it. It does take serious liberties with the entire Flashpoint arc as you'd imagine to fit in the alotted time, but the important bits are there and it's definitely true to the spirit of it.

It's very entertaining, and although dark, it has some very touching elements to it in the parts where the heroes aren't getting gored to death...

He has always been an underdeveloped character in the DC animated universe, if developed at all, he would be a comedic sidetrack.

They seem to have just dropped the main idea of Professor Zoom's revenge on the Flash.  Take a look.. you will see it at the end.  Also the direction DC is going makes me uneasy.  The depiction of graphic and bloody deaths is just gratuitous.  It like they are taking a page out of the most violent anime and injecting into the comics. That is what I have issue with in the ""New 52"" bit.  I'm not sure I want to see my heroes rip out the guts of villains.

This movie takes the best elements of the comic series and distills it down to a fast moving story with well developed Elseworlds-type characters. Plenty of 'what ifs' for the time travel fans. What if Bruce and Martha died and Thomas was left to become Batman? What if the Atlanteans and the Amazons had a turf war over the entire globe and Europe was the current battleground? I don't want to spoil it with too many details but enjoy this movie and the terrific Extras.

This is better than any feature film that schlock Hollywood has brought out in YEARS! If you are a fan of the DC universe, be prepared to have your paradigm SHATTERED! This is story telling at its absolute finest. In the world's darkest hour, we learn that the simplest things can make the biggest difference.  No spoilers here, I would not even think about it. You have to experience this film in its PURE entirety. Drama - Check, Raw Emotion - Check, Suspense - Check, Mystery - Check, Action - Check, Check, Check! However, like other reviews have said, this is ADULT drama! Violence and dark evil abound.  This IS the Justice League film you've been waiting for. Forget it, Hollywood, you simply don't have the staff of writers to top this! Forget live action.  DC animation gets the Justice League RIGHT!

5720298,5,B00CENSU1W,"As with live-action motion pictures, it doesn't matter how much you spend on the production or how convincing your VFX are, if you have a weak story, you will have a weak film. I recently watched the rather disappointing (to me anyway) ""Superman Unbound"", and the contrast between these two productions is stunning. This is a strong story with characters you actually care about dealing with an incredibly high-stakes situation. I watched it twice in two days because of the high level of detail in the story - given that it involves time travel, the significance of some of the details is not immediately apparent on the first viewing.

If I had to quibble any details, it would be the facial art on the male characters. Almost all the men have the same jaw line and inexplicable shadows on their cheeks - but that's trivial and doesn't really take anything away from the overall excellence of the production.

Oh, and be sure to wait through the credits - there is a post-credit teaser for the next movie. I think you'll recognize the ""creatures"" in the teaser and what the implications are.",1376784000,,1093,4.717277486910994
5720299,5,B00CENSU1W,"This is a movie for the adult fan of the justice league. those who have read the comic book on which this story is based know how great this story is.

5720300,4,B00CENSU1W,"With today's plot lines that are redone, movies like this can be a bit routine. This movie has enough to set it apart. Ffirst, it uses Flash as the main character, but still uses a Batman subplot to hold it together and keep it familiar for those who don't know Flash.  Second, it has a much darker feel.  The alternate reality takes on Batman and Superman are especially intriguing.  Third, people are killed.  This is not for kids, and that is refreshing.  Animation is a bit different and edgy, with lots of angular and sharp contrast on drawn characters.  Voice acting, as always with Andrea Romano, is top notch.  I am still waiting for a Justice League where a full out bloody war with Darkseid is portrayed; that may be too bloody for animated WB releases and may be restricted to comic pages (some of the later Crisis series) for now.

But seriously it focuses heavily on flash,hence the title which i really liked because before this i didn't know that much about him and now he's one of my favorites... Plus this is one of the bloodiest animations i have ever seen, probably the darkest that has come out of the justice league which i thought was great, i would definitely recommend this one.",1376697600,,445,4.5625
5720302,3,B00CENSU1W,"I have to be honest. After reading all the gushing reviews I can only believe DC fans have been so starved for anything decent to come down the pike they want to elevate the craptacular to art. Writing a gushing review for this movie is akin to crowing about having the best looking Yugo in the parking lot. There are more plot holes here than potholes on a road in Alaska. Characters act out of character because... shut up!

But here is the biggest letdown of them all : the most beautiful animation of the Flash - EVER! - is only about 45 seconds long right before the credits when it doesn't mean a damn thing. Think the original Spider-Man movies where you get to swing along with ol' Web-head. Trust me - fanboys will jizz about a bathtub full when they see Flash skip off the moving blades of a helicopter. Sadly, like falling in love with a beautiful woman who is a cuddly ball of crazy, it's over far too quickly.

But the thing that really, really... R-E-A-L-L-Y gets to me is how a man who can move faster than the speed of light could ever get caught in a thrown or fired trap. Seriously? A man with the speed and reactions to live a lifetime in one-billionth of a second can be brought low by a projectile? It just bugs the hell out of me how the Flash is trapped like a rat at the beginning of the movie, but towards the end is deftly dodging machine gun bullets with aplomb... on water, no less. I guess I am trying to say the writing on this movie was a mess, like it was written by a... well, a committee of fanbois.

I ended up watching this movie about five times the first time I watched it, only because I kept backing it up to see if I missed anything. It is said a great movie allows you to suspend disbelief. This movie requires that you suspend all belief, period. There really are better ones out there, but for the money this is an OK - but very confusing - way to blow 81 minutes of your life.",1376697600,,1921,4.186486486486486

5720305,5,B00CENSU1W,"Not going into details as it's been talked about already. Just gonna give a few personal opinions, thoughts, or experience about it.

My Pros:
- Quality of animation is excellent. Maybe the best so far.
- Voice acting is also great
- Action scenes are awesome
- 1st movie as Flash as the central character and he shines. This version of Batman was also great
- You get 4 past episodes from previous DC shows based on the Flash. Sometimes they only include 2. Something that has been overlooked IMO.
- Made for adults. Very violent and graphic. Not for kids. :)

My Cons:
- Nothing really. Just noting that Green Lantern is my fav superhero since childhood. He only made a brief cameo in the beginning. He was not in action like most of the others.
- Made for adults. Very violent and graphic. Not for kids. :(",1376697600,,809,4.422818791946309
5720306,5,B00CENSU1W,"I waited for this release with eager anticipation and I wasn't disappointed. The movie flowed well with the Flash as the main character as well as the alternate Batman who was Bruce Wayne's father in this version. This is also Flash story, so you would have to know a little something about the villains and supporting cast around the Flash. I'm also speaking on the Barry Allen Flash, and not the Wally West Flash which is going back at least 20 or even 30 years. I have not followed a Flash series since the 80s. However, I think the story does a decent job explaining these characters if your not familiar with the Flash characters.

But this isn't just about the Flash, this is really a crazy version about what if you change something in your life. Does it effect other people around you, even your closest friends? Clearly, the answer is yes in this movie. This starts with Flash as he saves his mom from being murdered only to find the World on the brink of World War 3. Aquaman and Wonder Woman are main the antagonists here who use their empires to plunge the Earth into chaos. Superman also is found hidden away by the United States Government as a socially crippled man treated like some science experiment gone array. In this alternate reality of Superman, his rocket crashed in Metropolis that killed thousands, instead of crashing in rural Kanas where no one was hurt. Thus, from childhood, Superman is raised in a harsh government facility instead of the farm life of his loving adoptive parents, the Kents.

I don't want to ruin the movie for you, but reading up the Flashpoint comic book series would help understand some of these changes. I think the movie stayed on point and told an effective story, even better than the comic books. I would rate this as well done. I just wished than more detail would have went into the war between Wonder Woman and Aquaman. They really only briefly touched on the reasons behind the war, which in my opinion weren't enough of an explanation. Cyborg was a pleasant character who seem to be the most level headed hero in this world. The Thomas Wayne Batman was great, as a doctor turned crime fighter, with even a more ruthless moral code than his son Bruce who was murdered that night in the dark alley instead of Thomas and his wife, which the movie clearly hints as her being the Joker.

I also wish more time could have spent on Thomas Wayne's world since he was also a main character in this movie. Here, unlike Bruce Wayne who projected the playboy image, Thomas alter ego as casino tycoon was a bit more rough edged, since running a few casinos in Gotham City which put him at a greater financial pressure on his business and as a crime fighter. Thomas partially explained this on his Bat plane when he flew the Flash, Cyborg, and the Shazam kids to Europe, to confront Aquaman and Wonder Woman. The Batman Flashpoint comic books were fun to read. They could have used some of that material too.

The Reverse Flash is excellently portrayed in this film as the main villain. I don't think he really ever got his due on the screen until now. I really enjoyed the final scenes as Flash battled Reverse Flash. I think an origin story might have came in handy on the Reverse Flash but with so much going on, clearly there would have been no where to fit it. I would recommend this animated movie as a must see.",1376697600,19,3366,4.5131147540983605

We all know Flash is fast, but I just wanted to make him seem faster then ever before. What? These are the same type of people that took transformers in to the Beast mode and ruined a great story line. Don't take this review the wrong way.

Will the world be saved? What in the heck happened to Superman? If you are a fan like this one will catch you totally off guard and keep you wanting more. The JL fans are still ranting over this one. I always prefer HD, but I wish the animation was a bit more vivid. Pay close attention to the Joker in this one because there is a surprise at every turn.  I recommend this Movie because even the worst comic book movie has ten times the plot of any Hollywood production these days. Did you see what they did to G.I Joe? OMG.

5720314,5,B00CENSU1W,"I have never read the comic ""The Flashpoint Paradox,"" but I really enjoyed this movie.
I generally tend to not like movies that deal with ""end of the world"" or ""have to save the world"" story lines because they generally get too bloated and unbelievable. But this movie is a ""have to save the world"" with a personal/ emotional story tie-in for the Flash which made it incredibly engaging.
Flash goes back in time to save his mom, but inadvertently changes EVERYTHING when he comes back to the ""present."" The movie is dealing with Flash's desire to want to go back in time to save the people that he cares about, but also about the consequences that our actions (no matter how good we might think  they are) can bring about to the people around us.
Is my loved one worth the future of my friends and other people in my life?
Truly a gem and I would recommend it to anyone (both comic book lovers and not).",1376611200,,903,4.375
5720315,5,B00CENSU1W,"""Flashpoint"" is enjoyable from several angles, one being that you only need to know enough about the characters to understand how horribly things go wrong. We all know Batman's origin, for example, but here, it takes a painful sideways turn. That one basic type of point about most of the players is plenty, which helps both the new viewers and the fans. To a large extent, this is easily followed as a separate drama that transcends its superhero aspects. Those who are normally not an audience for such fare can still enjoy it.

 The violence and peril are really over the top here. You might be wary of showing it to younger kids, 'cause Super-Friends its NOT! We're talking impalements, disintegration and detached limbs. Be prepared. Geoff Johns is one hell of a writer, putting everyone through gymnastic contortions. I'd love to wax on about various points, but spoilers are needless. Just watch it. Its virtually everything good in our world turned upside-down and the pace is excellent.

 I think its also a wise move to elevate The Flash in general. He's the one member of the Justice League who is actually light-hearted. That balance is sorely needed in a pantheon of what are basically dour Roman/Greek gods, with many of their bad habits intact. One thing well-shown in ""Flashpoint"" is that he IS a rational police detective with his jaw set hard to do things in a rightful manner. He and Batman have a sympathetic common point in having lost family members to crime and its interesting to see how each copes. Batman goes dark; the Flash goes through and around. I was surprised at how engaging ""Flashpoint"" really was. I recommend it not as just potent superhero fantasy, but as a meaningful dark drama that just happens to have superheroes as the pivots. Like ""Iron Man: Extremis,"" this story sets the bar higher.",1376611200,,1829,4.796825396825397
5720316,5,B00CENSU1W,"Great movie however it is not for children, I was a little surprised by the ""darker"" edge to this film.

5720317,5,B00CENSU1W,I'm not a big DC Comics fan...nor am I a fan of the Flash. After seeing the different reviews about this I decided to give it a shot. It is an incredible accomplishment...so much better than the live action superhero films. Perhaps live action can't really do what animation can as far as capturing the magic of this genre.

5720318,3,B00CENSU1W,"The latest Justice League animated film will puzzle some, with its revised cast of characters, new interpretations of others, and harsh anime-derived look, much different from the TV series or  the ""New Frontier"" film. Don't look for continuity with earlier Justice Leagues, accept this as a stand-alone story, with some nods to the ""New 52"" DC comics line, I suspect.  Much that you think you knew about these characters has changed, and not only because of the alternate time-line presented in ""Flashpoint"".

The story is perhaps a bit over-stuffed, and seems to veer into the ""let's make up some more new stuff"" more often than it needs to, leaving many avenues unexplored and some conflicts unresolved. (I mean, Thomas Wayne's wife is now the Joker?!?)  The fighting femmes of the League are given short shift here -- only Wonder Woman represents the distaff side, which is a pity for fans of Zatanna, Black Canary, Hawkgirl, and etc.  The voice acting is up to the usual high standards and helps make up for the angular and ugly art stylings and a higher-than-normal level of violence.  (I detect the unhappy influence of videogames in both of these complaints.) But I'm always interested in alternate realities and elseworlds, which is pretty much what this plot is about, so if you share these inclinations you will find much to surprise and amuse you in Flashpoint.  For the rest, it is loud, splashy, and melodramatic, a comic book movie that seldom sits still, and if the visuals dominate the storyline, that's to be expected these days.  It's not as thoughtful or sleek as the Bruce Timm-produced animated features, but fans of Barry (Flash) Allen should not be disappointed.",1376611200,2,1686,4.932862190812721

5720320,4,B00CENSU1W,"Over the past few years I have really enjoyed discovering the increasing number of stories that DC has been able to tell thru animation. I have seen just about all the movies and most of the TV shows that they have made. I want to preface this review by saying that I have not seen Justice League New Frontier, All-Star Superman, or Superman vs The Elite so any comparison that I make to other DC movies excludes those 2. Going into the Flashpoint Paradox my expectations were honestly low. I've never been a big Flash fan and I knew very little of what the movie was even about, but as the release day got closer and all the positive press emerged I decided to take a closer look. I made up my mind that I really wanted to see this movie and earlier this week I found it on sale at Target and decided I had to pick it up and I did, and after watching it I am definitely glad I gave it a chance. My favorite DC animation movies are Under the Red Hood and Mask of the Phantasm and honestly this ranks right up there with them. I really enjoyed the story and the action was epic. I am a big fan of the Young Justice series and this reminded more of a more mature version of that show, which is a good thing. Aside from a few cheesy one liners and one or two instances where the animation looked cheap there is really nothing to complain about with this feature. Although I was surprised with the level of violence that is in the film, so I would recommend not showing this to children, instead go with the young justice series or one of the other animated series. I am giving the movie a 4 out of 5 because I still think they can improve their films and the 2 minor complaints I mentioned above but all in all I would say that for me this ranks in the top 3 animated films from DC. Really got me looking forward to Justice League War and the 2 other Batman films they announced at Comic-Con.

5720325,5,B00CENSU1W,"DC has a great reputation for producing quality animated films and 'Flashpoint' is no different.  In fact, I'd rank this one right up there with 'The Dark Knight Returns.' The tone is similarly dark and gritty as the Flash finds himself in an altered timeline in which many key events and even superheroes are vastly different versions of themselves.  The acting is good overall, with many stars such as Michael B. Jordan, Nathan Fillion, Kevin Conroy and Ron Perlman lending their voices. This movie also has excellent action sequences, though I will caution that the violence is notably more graphic than usual. Those considering buying this for their kids (which I'm not sure I'd recommend) should know that this movie earns its PG-13 rating and I believe that if this were a live-action movie, the violence would almost make it 'R'-rated. Despite graphic violence and adult themes, the movie is well-made.

5720329,5,B00CENSU1W,"First, @Warner_Brothers, I will give you all my money, if I can just hear Kevin Conroy speaking, reciting poetry, I don't care, just make it happen!

To confirm, the Blu-ray is ""region free"" and plays perfectly on my European (Region 2) PS3 Blu-ray.

The packaging, excellent cover art, comes with a bevelled slip case that looks rather cool (the photos don't do it justice). The package also includes a DVD as well as a Ultraviolet (Digital copy with significant DRM).

The movie. I applaud Warner  Brothers for taking a risk and producing this movie. It is clearly aimed at the kids of the 90's who grew up with Batman & superman & Justice League cartoons and are now (supposedly) grown up adults. This movie deals with some dark topics (death and loss of a parent/child, murder, etc...) and is quite gruesome in parts, so it is not for younger viewers (< 12). While dark, the story is still very compelling and is a great modern twist on a classic moral tale. The voice work is excellent and sells the whole movie. The animation is smooth, enjoyable and reminds me very much of Justice League animation style.

The only negative is in the story and the motivations of Flash. Why years later is he suddenly upset at his mothers passing? It could perhaps have been more believable if the mother had been in a coma the entire time and had just died, it would be much easier to sympathize with Wally and understand why he felt so cheated. Also the introduction of Flash's arch-nemesis is a little brief/jarring (as he was never seen in Justice League, many non-comic readers wouldn't know him). Neither of these petty grievances should take away anything from this great cartoon adventure.

The Extras. A decent amount of extras including a commentary and 2 Flash related features (1 about Flash's enemies and another about the physics of Flash's speed and effects) that are very much worth watching and add additional depth to Flash.

Bottom line, if you have enjoyed any of the other DC comic movies before, you'll enjoy this one, it's the best of them all.",1376524800,4,2058,4.7
5720330,3,B00CENSU1W,"I got this really hoping it was going to be something special, DC's Animated Movies are almost always masterpieces in my opinion and I expected nothing less, unfortunately this one falls short.  The rendering of the characters themselves is strange with everyone superly muscle bound, but that's something that can easily be gotten over.  Seeing real DC violence and death was cool to finally see but it wasn't done all that well.  The thing that makes this movie lacking compared to other great DC movies out there is it's story.....  The premise is good, but they go a bad route by not giving you things in chronological order and your suddenly taken into a parallel timeline without being shown what happened.  I think if we were shown Flash's decision and were a part of his decision making process to change the past and were told how and why he decided to do it at this moment in history instead of a long time ago......then the movie would have flowed better and gotten us more attached to the characters and their plight.  If more was done to show the antagonist manipulating Flash into changing the past, somehow knowing what it would cause the movie would have made more sense and been better.  It was an okay movie.  But now that I've seen it I'd say it's a better rent then a buy.....  And although the cool part at the end (spoiler) where Flash gives Batman the letter written by Bruce's father to him in the alternate/parrell history was a very nice touch and awesome to see, I thought it really took away from The Flash in what is supposed to be His movie...",1376524800,,1573,4.549645390070922

5720340,4,B00CENSU1W,"If you haven't read the comic book source material by Geoff Johns and Andy Kubert, odds are your brow will furrow repeatedly at the shocking stuff that goes down in this animated adaptation. Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox runs 75 minutes, only it feels longer because it's packed with so many side stories. Some say too many side stories. Me, I liked it fine. I'm beaming that the Flash gets a chance to strut his stuff. I'm excited he's got a live action television series in development with the CW and that the 2013 Flash Annual is such a highlight read.

Who knew Nora Allen, dead and mourned all these years, wielded such mighty impact on the DC universe? Her son, as you know, is Barry Allen, referred to even by Usain Bolt as the Fastest Man Alive. Barry Allen is usually a methodical, sensible sort. And yet, after years of foiling twisted miscreants and saving lives and once even dying for the cause, it's hard to begrudge him his one moment of selfishness.

***Perhaps some plot SPOILERS from here on out***

One day the Flash wakes up to find everything changed. In this new and terrifying world there is no Justice League, no Superman, not much hope. Earth teeters on the brink of annihilation. Swarming opposing armies commanded respectively by a demented Aquaman and a savage Wonder Woman have reduced to Europe to an apocalyptic theater of war. In this reality Barry Allen has no super-speed. His beloved Iris is happily married to someone else. And maybe the most earthquaking swerve surfaces when Barry runs into his mother, alive and well. It's the only good news he's found in this crap new existence. Barry Allen immediately works to realign reality. He approaches the most resourceful man he knows.

They say lightning doesn't strike twice in the same place. No, it instead strikes it three times, if you go by Kid Flash's origin and by Barry's desperate restating of the lab accident that once had bestowed super-speed. I won't divulge the result. I'll only mention that if Barry were so inclined, he could've gone with a new superhero code name: ""Super-Crispy.""

Regarding the source material, I wasn't too impressed with Johns and Kubert's Flashpoint arc. And, sure, maybe ire is based in part on bias. We all knew Flashpoint would be the catalyst to DC's New 52 initiative, and I was all kinds of cynical about what really brought about such a sweeping, company-wide change. Ugh. Anyway, I prefer the movie to the comic book.

I saw it with friends who were conflicted. First point of contention: some protested that the animation leans too heavily towards anime and away from the style of the Bruce Timm cartoon era. I didn't fret over the animation, not even when I eyeballed several really severe character models (Aquaman, for one, looks truly crazed). It's as if Bart Sears' pencils had come to life, and I mean that as a good thing. There was grousing that character weight was sacrificed to favor multiple sub-plots. I disagree. I think the core players received strong character beats, none more resonant than the coda scene with Flash and Batman. This is a vehicle for the Flash, and yet the most memorable figure is the Flashpoint Batman. He's even more tortured than the regular continuity Bruce Wayne. One unanimous beef: to a man we wish Geoff Johns would quit it already trying to elevate Cyborg to top tier status. He's making me hate a character I used to really like when Wolfman was writing him. It's Sentry all over again. (Somewhere Brian Michael Bendis is going: ""Whatchu talking about?"")

Piles of fun Easter eggs. Heaps of recalibrated origins and startling scenarios. A horde of characters relegated to cameos and given short shrift, and plenty of them viewed thru cracked mirrors. Ray Bradbury, wherever he is, is pleased as punch that he's obliquely referenced here: the butterfly effect is no joke, man! The changes are radical. It's rather brilliant that the movie opens with a fairly light sequence in which Flash and his Justice League buds thwart his rogues' gallery. It's breezy tone presents a stark contrast to the depths of brooding we're later exposed to. This movie is rated PG-13 and I'd even go as far as to say it's a hard PG-13. There are moments that jar with graphic brutality. Nathan Fillion briefly voices Hal Jordan and utters a naughty. It's not for the younger kids. I'm bothered some by that tiresome retread about writers getting their brave on only when they're playing in the sandbox of alternate realities, easily discounted territories wherein characters can be killed off with no real consequence. And having condemned the film for that, let me do a quick 180 and observe that the storytelling here is that much more intriguing for its darker and more mature - if not richer - themes. This is the most commanding and least Super Friend-y that  Aquaman has ever been. I do wish that the movie were longer. 75 minutes isn't near long enough to service a story of this sweep and ambition. Or maybe I just wanted more camera time for the Canterbury Cricket (never mind that his Flashpoint tie-in comic book was rubbish).

Oh, and maybe you'd want to stay for the post-credits stinger.

The bonus stuff on this Blu-Ray disc:

- Audio Commentary by comic book writer Geoff Johns, director Jay Oliva, producer James Tucker, and screen writer Jim Krieg
- ""A Flash in Time: Time Travel in the Flash Universe"" - a featurette that examines the concept of time travel and attempts to apply real science to the Flash's super-powers (00:22:24 minutes)
- ""My Favorite Villain! The Flash Bad Guys"" - pretty self-explanatory (00:18:58 minutes)
- Digital Comics Excerpt from DC Comics' FLASHPOINT #1

5720341,4,B00CENSU1W,I gave up trying to follow all the HUGE events in DC a while back. Mr. Johns just burned me out after all the Blackest Night stuff and its tie-ins. I stopped a quarter way through Brightest day and never even touched Flashpoint. Seeing this film is therefore interesting from my point of view. I liked seeing it as a self-contained movie. Its really dark and violent but I didn't mind that. I like Wonder Woman in this version and Thomas Wayne. I just wouldn't show this to children. Its really for the Teen and up crowd. I just wish DC didn't reboot its whole line with the new 52 after Flashpoint. I wish it had stayed in normal DC continuity. But that's just my opinion.,1376438400,,673,4.349206349206349

That being said, while I really enjoyed Flashpoint Paradox, I just felt like there was something missing.  I can't go into too many details without giving away the story, but this movie probably should have been much longer.  The story revolves around an alternate timeline/universe and while showing most of the major JL characters, it only focuses on a few leaving the viewer wanting more.

Still a great story, just needs a bit more detail/backstory on some of the more interesting ""twists"" applied to main JL characters.

This is my only reason for my first 4 rating for anything DC Comics and quite honestly I'm not completely sure it is even a good reason.

There are a lot of super hero appearances in the movie as well, but nobody is safe as there is a lot of violence and death in the movie.",1376352000,2,428,4.107142857142857
5720352,5,B00CENSU1W,"This is not one of the best animated films from DC, nor is it one of the most violent. It is absolutely, positively the best animated film from DC or Marvel, in my opinion. It is absolutely the darkest, most violent rendition of any comic book recreation. I have been waiting for something worth giving 5 stars to. I have never given anything 5 stars. This movie goes above and beyond. For me, it was way too short. Do not misunderstand. It was a good feature length film. I just wanted to see more. I did not want it to end. This is not any Justice League or any individual characters that you will recognize. It is an amazing reimagining of familiar characters both heroes and villains. There are heroes that are now villains, villains that are now heroes and some that you will not be able to figure out where they fall. This is not, I repeat not for children. If you are a fan of the original Justice League, you may like it, love it or hate it. If you were a fan of Superfriends, you may be horrified by this film.

I have always imagined that the Flash could potentially be one of the most powerful heroes in the DC universe because of his unique power. He could potentially be the most powerful hero in the DC universe. This is his film and he comes close to those accolades. This film gives Flash his long overdue opportunity for elite status. He is not the clown or buffoon that he is sometimes portrayed as. In this film, he is serious, thoughtful and everything a hero should be. I did not expect this movie to be anything like it was. I was blown away. To me, it was what an animated film about super powered beings should be. It is constant action from beginning to end. I have seen ""all"" of the animated films including the relatively new Marvel Knights franchise. I have seen the Armored Adventures of Iron Man, Green Lantern, Justice League and JLU and a few others. These are all series. I have seen Hulk vs.,  Avengers Unlimited, Superman Unbound, Under the Redhood, The Dark Knight Returns 1 & 2, Planet Hulk and several others. They were all good to very good but none of them comes anywhere near Flashpoint Paradox. An absolute masterpiece of action, animation and story telling. Some second tier characters are brought to the fore front but they do not take over. Some main characters are given space but not too much. DC somehow found the right balance. When you see how many characters are included, you will see what I mean. This film is about Flash and revolves around Flash. There are a couple of major players that have co-starring roles but their appearances are timely and for a purpose. It had to be incredibly difficult to find that type of balance. My hats off to DC for doing a fantastic job on an incredible movie. Wait until you see what they did with Superman!

5720354,4,B00CENSU1W,"Flashpoint is a thrilling, fast paced, comic book movie. The story begins with our hero Flash/Barry Allen (Justin Champers) waking up to find out that his life has changed; his murdered mother is alive, a war is going on and he has no super speed. Barry has no idea what's going on, but it's up to him to not only save his life, but the world too. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Keefer Blakeslee (age 13) loves it and warns, ""This is not a movie for little kids. It has graphic animated blood and bad language."" For older kids, he thinks it's great, with outstanding animation and true to the original comic book story. See his full review below.

I love the animation. Not only are the action scenes outstanding, but the details on the characters faces are astonishing. When their face moves, so do their shadows. It's special. The story is engaging. If you're a comic book reader you'll find the movie follows the comics respectfully, while still having its own originality. The characters are well evolved. Like any life changing story, if one person changes others change too. Batman, Wonder Woman and even Superman change for the worst and it's fascinating to see the consequence. An issue in this film is the graphic animated blood and bad language. I know it's rated PG-13 and, to be fair, the blood does blend well with the shadow's and costume's but, on the case it says SFI violence and action throughout. Be forewarned.

My favorite character is Batman (Kevin McKidd - None-other than the Dark Knight himself) Here is the twist: he uses guns instead of gadgets or drinks and is ruthless. That's because Batman is not the person you think he is... This makes him more interesting because you see a different side of Batman. I love it when they do that to a well-known character.

My favorite scene is the back-story of Batman. It's not the story people are familiar with. What makes this scene stand out is the dark and brooding tone. It's both sad and morose and, sort of twisted.

The moral of the story is, accept the things you can not change but have the courage to change the things you can. The Flash blames himself for his mother's death and thinks if he was there, he would have saved her. Sadly, he discovers he needs to focus on the things he can alter.

I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18. This is not a movie for little kids. It has graphic animated blood and bad language. If you're older, you can enjoy the action and story. You can get Flashpoint Paradox on DVD now.

5720355,5,B00CENSU1W,"Finally, a good movie with Flash front and center.  I have not read the comics dealing with this, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  This deals with Flash travelling to an alternate timeline, and trying to figure out why he is in this timeline.  Things look bleak with Aquaman and the Atlanteans in an all out war with Wonder Woman and the Amazonians, with Flash, Batman, and Cyborg stuck in the middle.  If you are a fan of Justice League or anything in the DCAU, you should find some enjoyment here.",1376265600,3,504,4.5054945054945055
5720356,5,B00CENSU1W,"After capturing Professor Zoom in a failed attempt to destroy the Flash Museum in Central City, Barry Allen awakes to a world -changed.  Atlantis has risen and sunk half of Europe.  Aquaman and Wonder Woman are waging a civil war. The Batman is a gun toting killer. Superman never appeared in Smallville.  The Rogues are heroes.

Think Back to the Future 2 as a Greek tragedy with superheroes.

The film is a chaotic free-for-all of revised characters and lots and lots of killing. Not specifically GRAPHIC violence, but... Hangings? Check.  Decapitations? Check.  Arrows to the face?  Check. Murder of .. children?(!! - well, one)  Check. This is PG-13 material, to be sure.  It's for the grown-ups.  Yet for all it's dark ugly subtext, it's very entertaining.  And I might add, it's the kind of material that would probably be a dreary disaster as a live-action film.  But animated, with the tonal lightness animation gives?  It just makes the wild stuff more passable, and the violence more dramatically intense.

Not sure if I can specifically recommend the bluray over the regular DVD... for this style of animation (lower framerate, soft detail) it may not be a must, unless you are a fan of deep, saturated color and contasts. Then I'd say go for it.  The DTS 5.1 soundmix is absolutely outstanding. It's near demo material.  Voices, effects and music balance perfectly.  The score has a driving operatic color, reminiscent of the Danny Elfman 'Batman' soundtracks.  It's perfect for the material.

5720357,1,B00CENSU1W,"I wanted to like this.  I really did.  Nonetheless, I did not find this viewing experience very pleasing.  I enjoy the various incarnations of the Flash (Jay, Barry, Wally.)  However, in this animated adaptation my appreciation for the Flash was overshadowed by how the story deliberately establishes many of the DC heroes as unlikable (even detestable) characters in the alternate reality.  In the previous release ""Crisis on Two Earths"", at least the original (good, heroic) JLA team is present to root for and to balance against the evil, unlikable Crime Syndicate.  Here, the Flash is pretty much the only character to root for in a fight to save the world from destruction by heroes-turned-evil.

The animation style is a bit strange (when compared with previous releases.)  The stakes are high.  You're forced to root against characters you'd otherwise root for.  This is probably the heaviest, darkest, and least-pleasant (least fun) JL animated release yet.  In light of that, I cannot say that I'm looking forward to the next release, especially since it will be based upon yet another universe where the characters that we know and love have been rebooted and rewritten.",1376265600,11,1180,5.09375

5720361,5,B00CENSU1W,"Start by saying what a great job DC has done with the Batman franchise. To these tired old eyes, for example, the Dark Knight animations were as good as or better than the live action versions. (Yes, I know, that is heresy, shoot me). DC struggles with the Superman entries. Maybe because so little can hurt him, it's hard to create conflict. JLA is all over the map, some work, some don't. This is the best best best ever. Has a lot of ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE IN IT, which is possibly the most obscure segue you'd expect to find in a review. The really brilliant thing is the way the writers made the story about a single character -- Flash -- and let the viewer see it through his eyes. A strong connection makes a good film. And for any fanboy of any era, the things they did with the traditional characters in this ""alternate"" universe are both horrifying and mesmerizing at the same time. Guarantee you will never forget what happens to poor Superman here .. forget Lex, imagine if this poor guy had been caught by the government as a baby. Wow.

I also like how the story had a strong ""Batman"" undercurrent to it. Flash really isn't the most liked character in the DC universe so I completely understand why the story would also feature Batman prominently.  Hey, they still have to sell books and movies, folks. Still, I actually shed a tear at the end when Bruce got to see the letter. Really emotional moment for any Batman fan.

I enjoyed it allot, it was however more violent then I thought (not that that is a bad thing with in context), most of the PG or PG13 DC ones are not so much that way, but this one I would not let the kids see.  There is the one scene where a character kills another, it's done partly off screen but the camera does come back and you know what happens.  I was vaguely aware of the plot from the comics but you don't have to have followed everything to enjoy this or know all the back stuff and it's really nice seeing Flash get a headliner movie like the other ones have.  The bonus features on this are excellent.  I enjoyed them all a great deal especially the one about Flash's Rogue's that was cool.  DC pretty much usually nails it with there animated movies and with Man of Steel seem to be on that track now with the features so hopefully we can before long see these characters for ""real"" on the screen in good story's like the animated ones they have been putting out.",1376179200,2,1008,4.170103092783505
5720365,4,B00CENSU1W,"I read a large portion of the Flashpoint series when it came out. It was a wild ride and I couldn't tell where it was going? However, that was the appeal to see these main favorites( Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Cyborg, Captain Marvel, etc.) in this #ucked up version of the DC universe as vulnerable, lethal, and less heroic. It was also cool to see Death Stroke the Terminator as a good guy for as long as he tried to hold out? For the folks that didn't read Flashpoint ( and you should ) A LOT was left out to make this compressed version of the entire series into a single movie. You loose out on a tremendous amount of specifics that built the characters up. I have to give them credit for trying. I recommend watching this DVD. :)

P.S. Just a hint; Eobard Thawn isn't the ONLY Professor Zoom or Reverse Flash. Hunter Zolomon is by far more interesting and powerful nemesis. Unlike Thawn; who is a speedster, Zolomon alters time relative to himself making him far FAR more faster than any of the speedsters.

5720376,1,B00CENSU1W,"Aside from some good voice talent adorning this project, DC Animated's newest (and worst) film since its inception, THE FLASHPOINT PARADOX, is a bloody, violent, and all-around unpleasant experience based on one of the worst so-called ""Event"" comic arcs in recent years, Geoff Johns' five-issue FLASHPOINT.

Since it essentially replicates most of what takes place in the comic (with the exception of the opening sequence), there's no point in really rehashing all of that nonsense. The animation is going further and further away from the more classical DC animation projects that have set the standard since BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES premiered in 1992 and more towards an anime/CG style that, while being more ""current"", is sometimes too kinetic to really appreciate detail, and even worse, the animation seems perfunctory. It's seems very unfinished, and there's no real joy to looking at almost any of the scenes. The vocal work from Kevin McKidd as the Thomas Wayne Batman and the always-enjoyable Nathan Fillion as Hal Jordan/Green Lantern stand out, but despite Michael B. Jordan (an actor I really like, and does good work here as well), I just didn't care any more about Cyborg than I would in an older episode of Cartoon Network's TEEN TITANS cartoon. In fact, I care even less, because obviously Johns has his pet characters that he likes to showcase, and Cyborg is definitely one of them.

If this had been a feature based entirely around the Thomas Wayne Batman and the incredibly powerful story of the ""Flashpoint"" world that was crafted by Brian Azzarello and Eduardo Rizzo, or had at least more elements of that, I would have been significantly more pleased. But that's just personal preference and not much to do with the actual product.

Jay Oliva, as a director, seems to be stepping backwards here, particularly from the amazing work he'd recently done with the very well-done DARK KNIGHT RETURNS two-parter recently released. He seems to be much less focused on storytelling and character than on showing a very brutal and horrific world and brutal and horrific things that former heroes are doing to each other. Another thing to discuss in this film is the violence. How is this film not R-Rated? There is more blood and eviscerations and decapitations and death than in most of the ""Hard R"" films out there, yet somehow this ends up being PG-13? I'm certainly no prude (one of my favorite films of 2013 is the NC-17 rated BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR), but that this could somehow be okay for children as long as there's a 13-year-old around just seems wrong.

Don't get me wrong; I didn't set out to dislike this. I usually prefer the animated adaptations of what DC Animated has done with less-than-stellar story arcs, particularly with the two SUPERMAN/BATMAN films (PUBLIC ENEMIES and APOCALYPSE). It just still falls too far short of the mark, much like the comic did and leaves you with a foul taste in your mouth of things to come for DC Animated. With the departure of genius creator Bruce Timm from the DC Animated branch, the next upcoming film will be the first foray into the universe of the ""New 52"", called JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR, based on the first New 52 arc of JUSTICE LEAGUE, which is another just-barely-average arc from Johns and artist Jim Lee.

I only hope that it will eventually get better. Maybe if they continue with the New 52, we can get an I, VAMPIRE film!

It could happen...",1376006400,8,3424,4.844444444444444
5720377,4,B00CENSU1W,"Probably the quickest direct from comics to video production by DC Universe, this came out less than two years after the original story arc. Flashpoint was one of those big crossover events in comics that usually effects all the main characters of a comics universe, but this also acted as a catalyst for restarting the entire DC Comics product line into what is now referred to at the New 52. Before this, the DC Universe was made up of several different ones, including the Wildstorm and some of the Vertigo titles. So, anyone interested in how DC's new product line started out, this is pretty much where to begin from. This was directed by Jay Olivia, whose prior work includes Young Justice and Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, as well as some of the previous DC Universe films, so you know he knows his superhero material. Plus, a large portion of the animation was handled by Studio 4C, the anime studio who have also done production on Memories, the new Thundecats series, and the Berserk movie trilogy.

 Starting out in what could be called the ""Post-Final Crisis"" DC Universe, the Flash(who here is the second one, Barry Allen)is ambushed by the Rogues Gallery, who are suckered by Professor Zoom(the Reverse-Flash) to kill Flash. But the Justice League shows up to give Barry a hand and save everyone. Zoom goats Flash into regretting not saving his mother when he was a boy, and Flash inadvertently goes back in time to try an change things, even though in the comics it was actually Zoom who did that. Barry awakens in a new reality where his mother is still alive, but everything else has changed. In this new timeline, Aquaman and Wonder Woman have plunged Atlantis and Themyscira into a blood feud which brings the whole world into catastrophe. The Amazons have take over Britain as ""New Themyscira"", and the Atlantians are constantly trying to conquer them and the rest of the surface world. Barry realizing that he's in a different reality, but can't do anything about it because he doesn't have any super-speed now. He goes to Gotham to get help from Batman, but shocked to discover that the Batman here is Thomas Wayne, Bruce Wayne's father. After convincing Batman the truth behind his story, Barry has him recreate the experiment that transformed him into the Flash. The first time results in Barry getting nearly burnt alive, but a second time gets his spark going and gives him his super-speed, which luckily allows him to heals his burns quickly. The downside is though that Flash can't access the speed force which allows him to travel through time, because Prof. Zoom is here too which corrupts the speed force, and only by defeating him can Flash go back in time and change everything back to normal. So, Flash and Batman team up with Cyborg, who here is one of America's ""Man of Steel"", to then find where the real Superman is at. Kal-El was captured by the government when he first came to Earth, and kept in an underground facility. The heroes bust Kal out of there, only to be confronted by the army, and Superman flies off afterwards. Flash and the others team up with the Shazam Kids to try and flush out Zoom that the figure is somewhere in England where all the Atlantean/Amazon battles are going on. The Shazam Kids form Captain Thunder(Capt. Marvel)to take on Wonder Woman, while the others keep Aquaman busy, with some assistance from The Resistance(made of Lois Lane and Grifter). After a grueling battle, most of all the heroes die, while Zoom finally steps out of the shadows, and cripples Flash by impaling his leg. Batman manages to plug Zoom strait through the head, but only to have Aquaman activate his failsafe plan which is to turn the captured Captain Atom into a nuclear bomb which will wipe clean all life on the surface of the Earth. Realizing what is at stake, Flash somehow manages to utilize the speed force again despite his broken leg, and goes back in time to stop himself from altering it in the first place. Barry awakens back in his old reality, although it's not completely the same timeline as he now has a totally new outfit. He seems to remember the previous timeline with the world war, along with the fact that he has a letter from Thomas Wayne to give to Bruce. The ending has Flash running off in a scene very similar to most of the Spider-Man movies.

This was the most brutal of all the other DC Universe movies, so even though you'd see this in the Kids Movies aisle at your local Target, it's really meant for older viewers. There's a lot of differences between this mini-series and the original comics, mostly because this isn't just a single mini-series but several tie-ins. One of the main changes is that it was Zoom himself that caused the Flashpoint timeline to come about, and not Flash. The vocal casting is very interesting with Nathan Fillion returning as Hal Jordan, Kevin Conroy as Batman(Bruce, not Thomas), Ron Pearlman as Slade, Dee Bradley Baker as Etrigan, Dana Delany as Lois Lane, and Vanessa Marshal as Wonder Woman. Additions to the cast include Hynden Walch doing a slight reprise as Harley Quinn(here, Yo-Yo) and Tim Daly's son Sam as Superman. This does act as a better Flash movie more than it does as a Justice League one.

The star of the movie is The Flash (the Barry Allen version).  Something in his past is altered, leading to a whole different future for not only him, but the entire world.  It was a well-told story in this animated movie, and even ended on an emotional note, which actually moved me a bit.  I'm glad I read the original series, though, because there were some parts missing from the movie that I felt were integral to the storyline.

There were a lot of DC characters throughout (yay!), but if you're unfamiliar with them (or the Flashpoint storyline), you'd probably have no clue who they are.  The movie didn't bother to name particular characters for the audience.  For example, Deathstroke and Black Manta appeared in the movie, but their names were never mentioned (that I noticed).  If you didn't know them already, you certainly wouldn't know them by watching the movie.  There were lots of extra superheroes that appeared in the movie, but where was Booster Gold, who was an important character in the original comic book series?

The animation was pretty good overall; however, what I didn't like was the faces of the characters.  They were all drawn in anime/manga, Pokemon-like style. UGH.  Wonder Woman and a young Barry Allen with those big eyes and weird-shaped pointy chin?  Was that really necessary?  Luckily, you only noticed it in the close-up shots, but it felt a bit jarring with the rest of the animation.

As another reviewer pointed out, there is a LOT of violence in this movie.  After all, it is an apocalyptic movie set on an alternate world, so anything can happen...and does.  It's no different from any other PG-13 apocalyptic movie, though, except that it's animated.  But there are some violent scenes that take place off camera; you know what's happening, but you don't actually see what's being done.

This is definitely one of the best DC animated movies, and is a must-see for any superhero/comic book fan.  It's kind of funny that they didn't just call it ""Flashpoint"" like the comic series.  Adding ""Paradox"" to the end reminded me of a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Bang-Theory/dp/B000W91RUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Bang Theory</a>&nbsp;episode.

1) as a fan of the TV show Young Justice (you can read my reviews of that show too, I highly recommend) several of the characters featured appears from the series and while not taking center stage do have fantastic parts and performances.
2) The animation is stellar, visually a masterpiece, lots and lots of eye candy to go around.
3) The story is amazing, it's such a good story told in a very serious way, especially since the main character (the Flash, duh) has been portrayed as kinda a goof.  This is a story that makes Flash a relevant and apex character in the DC universe.
4) The multitude of cameos and recreations of dozens of characters from DC lore.  First off, you have a normal day on normal earth with a normal super-villain plan to kill of a good guy (not really normal but for this kind of show it is) then you have alternate earth with alternate heroes acting in ways that these characters traditionally would never act like, some so radically different it's hard to figure because the name doesn't match the actions.

5720394,3,B00CENSU1W,"Warner Bros. and DC appear to have the production of direct to video animation features down to a science.  While it's good for consumers and fanboys to have something else to look forward to, there is a hit and miss quality to some of the recently released titles.

I have not read the original Flashpoint story-arc so I cannot speak to how true the movie stays to the original source material.

Most viewers already know that this story is based off of Geoff John's Flashpoint story-arc that immediately preceded the arrival of ""The New 52"".  The ""there and back again"" experience of Barry Allen traveling back through time and interrupting history (i.e. preventing his mother's death) allows for ripples in the original timeline and continuity so that previously cannonized events in DC continuity can be altered to suit the needs of DC editors.

The story is good but not wholly original.  Alternate reality/multiverse/opposite character have been explored as recently as Justice League:Doom.  The appeal to this narrative technique is obvious - it allows writers to take risks with characters they otherwise could not, without any significant and lasting affects.  Despite the lack of originality, there is appeal to the story beyond being just another ""crisis"" to setup DC's marketing-based ""reboot"".

I like how far original writer John's pushes the envelope with character's like Superman and Martha Wayne, but the running time of the movie doesn't allow for a full development of these characters and so one is forgotten by the end while the other reappearance comes across as a dues ex machina.  I like how director Jay Oliva creates density to the story by including a broad array of characters - from the Rogues to the Resistance, there were names and faces that I recognized but was didn't know much about which gave the story the epic scale it aspires.

I was really dissatisfied with the animation, particularly the facial features of some key characters.  Superman's head/face at the beginning is so disproportionately small I laughed out loud.  While Aquaman's head in the alternate reality is so large it looks as if he's overdosed on a batch of Barry Bond's HGH.  That artist could seem to lift their pen off the artwork when shading facial features.  Ok, Batman likes the scruffy look, but why does everyone else look that way too?

The voice acting was good and maybe even great in parts.  There are familiar names voicing the characters - Daly, Conroy - yet one wonders if there will ever be an acceptable alternative to viewers.

As others have noted, the violence and language is stepped up a notch and a PG-13 rating seems generous.

On the whole, Justice League: Doom and Superman vs. Elite were far better movies.  I'm sure Flashpoint Paradox has it's place, though I'm just not sure where it is yet.  I'm surprised by the number of 4 and 5 star reviews.  Warner Bros and DC appear to be aiming for an older more mature audience with these movies, and if that's true I think they would do well to increase the running time to allow for a full development of the story.",1375833600,2,3095,4.8330170777988615

It was great the way they showed the stories of the other characters, like when Martha Wayne became The Joker. My Only complaint was some  some of the shots of Flash running were a little cheesy. Other then that, the speed force was well shown. We even got to see other characters that were on Young Justice. I recommend reading the graphic novel Flashpoint, and Final Crisis before seeing the movie, But all the same enjoy!",1375833600,,531,4.474226804123711
5720398,5,B00CENSU1W,"This is why I love DC. Serious, in-your-face stories and bone shattering action. DC is not Marvel. Don't get me wrong. I like Marvel and appreciate their more lighthearted, tongue-in-cheek approach, save for X-Men. In fact say 25 years ago, I was more of a Marvel fan than DC. I'm 37 now. Personally, I prefer a more serious tone. Hence, DC appeals to me more now. And when it comes to animation, DC rules. This movie was relentless and intense. It had the type of action I saw in JLU and Man of Steel. DC knows how to cut loose with their characters. Made me really want to play Injustice. And it's not for kids. But let's not get bent out of shape. This isn't Saving Private Ryan or Saw or Watchmen or something. Most kids, real young ones, won't be interested anyway. It won't leave a child traumatized. Just use discretion. That's why the rating system is there. Use it. Awesome animated superhero movie. Glad to see The Flash as the star.",1375833600,4,943,4.456647398843931
5720399,3,B00CENSU1W,"This is not for children.  Bloody violence, cruelty and sadistic evil.  After all is said it is one of the darkest cartoon dramas that I have ever seen DC release.",1375833600,,163,4.4
5720400,4,B00CENSU1W,"DC Comics definitely hits its stride with ""Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox."" Never have I been more impressed with an animated adaptation of a comic book story arc than I am with this spectacular straight-to-DVD movie. At the same time, I am not without complaints in regards to it.

Everyone wishes they could go back in time and right the wrongs they or others have committed. The Flash (Justin Chambers) is no different... and he has the power to do so! Unfortunately, his selfish desires to bring his mother back from the dead causes a ripple in the time stream which looks to cause the destruction of the entire world at the hands of Aquaman (Cary Elwes) and Wonder Woman (Vanessa Marshall).

The two super heroes are at war with each other in this skewed reality. They could cause the outbreak of World War III and the deaths of millions of innocent people. Can the Flash and the alternate versions of the Justice League band together and keep the Atlantean and Amazonian warriors from destroying the entire world in their vengeful crusade?

The animation style of ""Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox"" is very much unique to what we've seen before from the DC animated features. Something about it just gives the entire movie a bigger and more epic feel than what we've experienced in the past. Like me, some might find the new artistic renditions of their favorite super heroes off-putting at first. As the film moves on, I found myself embracing and crediting the style change with giving it an extra dimension and setting it apart as something distinct.

Writer Jim Krieg does everything he possibly can to bring Geoff Johns and Andy Kubert's graphic novel to life for the big or small screen. He successfully pulls in all the necessary elements from the book to give it a solid foundation and keep it moving forward at a breakneck pace. ""Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox"" begins to unravel when he tries to fit too many extraneous Easter eggs and backstories from the individual books published outside of the main graphic novel into 81 minutes.

Krieg takes the source material from ""The World of Flashpoint: Batman,"" The World of Flashpoint: Superman,"" and ""The World of Flashpoint: Green Lantern"" and tries to add too much depth to the alternate universe storylines of these characters. He ends up making the movie feel like it's about to burst at the seams. Krieg does do a good job fleshing out the Aquaman and Wonder Woman conflict which acts as the backdrop of the tale.

""Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox"" looks and sounds phenomenal. It's presented in 1080p High Definition (1.78:1). The colors are vibrant the way a movie based on a comic book should be and the picture is crystal clear. A 5.1 surround sound mix brings to life the climactic battles and bombastic musical score, assuring home audiences will be absorbed by the film.

The Blu-ray is stuffed full of exclusive content. Writer Geoff Johns, Producer James Tucker, Screenwriter Jim Krieg, and Director Jay Oliva provide feature commentary. Two featurettes are included entitled ""My Favorite Villain! The Flash Bad Guys"" and ""A Flash in Time."" It contains an excerpt from the digital Flashpoint #1 comic. Four bonus cartoons are pulled out of the DC Comics vault as well. We also get a sneak peek at the upcoming ""Justice League: War"" animated movie.

""Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox"" is definitely rated PG-13. There's a lot of violence, some being very graphic. There's also adult language and situations. As usual, some of the female characters barely wear any clothes. The artists of the film also enjoy drawing Wonder Woman's butt bursting out of her costume.

Although it has its problems, I consider ""Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox"" to be a big step forward for the DC animated features. It kept my attention through great storytelling, extraordinary battle sequences, and a legendary face-off between Aquaman and Wonder Woman. Flash fans will find the movie to be everything they've ever wanted as their favorite character takes front and center.",1375747200,3,4074,4.961876832844575

Don't get me wrong, I've really enjoyed most of the animated movies DC has put out, especially the one's Bruce Timm and company worked on but ""The Flashpoint Paradox"" is by far the best I've seen.  I guess it's because, first and foremost it seems this movie is geared toward a more adult viewing audience.  As some others have pointed out in their reviews, this movie lives up to it's PG13 rating.  The action is fast, intense and violent, definitely not a ""kiddie cartoon"".  The intense action however, is appropriate for the story and adds a level of engagement with the viewer that is sometimes missing with other DC comic adaptations I've seen over the last couple years.  Overall, this is simply an outstanding movie with the kind of intensity I've been waiting to see for a long time.  The voice actors did a great job, the art is very good and the plot is awesome.  I highly recommend this movie for older viewers that, like me, understand the power of animation as a story telling medium, loves the characters and have been waiting for DC to take the action in their animated movies up a notch.",1375747200,4,1238,4.595454545454546

5720404,5,B00CENSU1W,"This movie was definitely DC's most hardcore animation to date. Although it sports the Justice League on the title, this is a Flash and Batman story with brief looks at the other characters. A masterpiece in both the animation style and character design. Fortunately the movie stuck to its roots and stayed true to its source material (comic) with minor changes that built upon the already brilliant story.",1375660800,2,406,4.985294117647059
5720405,4,B00CENSU1W,"I read the original Flashpoint series by Geoff Johns and Andy Kubert and enjoyed it a lot.  At the time, I did not know that it was going to be the linchpin to change the entire DC Universe.

The Blu-ray version of the comic series/graphic novel/series is condensed a lot, but all of the major points of the story are intact.  Since the Blu-ray is out now and the stories were released a couple years ago, I'm not going to worry about spoilers.

My 15 year old watched the movie version with me and wasn't familiar with the story.  He's more into reading Deadpool these days.  Like me, he was in awe of all the ramifications of the changes in the characters.  Thomas Wayne presents a much different Batman than Bruce Wayne, and I can remember being shocked by that when I read the original issues as they were coming out.

The whole Wonder Woman/Aquaman war just never really worked for me.  I just couldn't see those two characters being so radically different than the heroes I'd grown up with.  I think a lot of comics readers felt the same way I did.  The thing that really worked in the comics, and works again in the Blu-ray, is the friendship that develops between Thomas Wayne and Barry Allen.  I also loved the way Barry is presented, how human and how much of an everyman he is in spite of his superspeed.  His dedication to ""recovering"" his powers is testimony to the kind of man he is.

The Blu-ray version kind of falls apart in relaying what's going on in the rest of the world.  There are almost too many jumps, too many characters introduced, killed, etc., but leaving them out would have been a mistake.  I think the video should have been longer to allow such a big story to breathe.

I also want to warn parents that even though this Blu-ray movie is rated PG-13, I think it should have been rated an R for the violence and content.  People are constantly dying, sex is heavily hinted at, and at one point Wonder Woman stabs a young boy with her sword.  Even though the last is off-screen, viewers know what's going on.

The colors were well done, but I wasn't all that happy with the character art.  Everyone tends to look the same with that weird triangular head and big jaws.  The characters almost look like caricatures of themselves.

I enjoy the DC Universe on video a lot, and I enjoyed this latest release a lot as well, but it's just not for kids and some parents may make a mistake in thinking that it is.",1375660800,,2434,4.395973154362416
5720406,5,B00CENSU1W,"This film can best be summed up with the following quote:

""accept the things you can not change, have the courage to change the things you can, and have the wisdom to know the difference""

I won't say anything more on that, but it pretty much describes the entire premise of the movie.  Its also an amazing quote :)  The story is done pretty much through the perspective of The Flash and i really enjoy that.  ive been wanting a good, serious Flash film, and boy does this deliver!  everything about it is amazing.

Some have complained that they left too many questions regarding some of the other characters, and i understand where they are coming from.  here's the thing though..  I think that is how the writers WANTED the film to go.  those characters were supposed to have a smaller role than usual. kinda like how The Flash has been portrayed in most other stories.. at least the ones i've seen. also, if the writers wanted, they could have made a movie on any one of the other story lines, and all of them would have been awesome.. but they decided to put the focus on The Flash this time.. and i for one, am completely ok with that.

and yes, this movie is violent.  definitely the most violent of the DC animated films.  but, as others have said, it's rated pg-13 for a reason.  its a dark film. does it cross the line?  it teeters on the edge in a couple spots.. but overall its fine.  its no less dark than some of the comic books out there, and its about time we got some film makers that aren't afraid to show some of that off in an animated movie format.

bottom line is.. if you are a DC fan, and are a fan of The Flash, you need this film as part of your collection.  you won't be disappointed.",1375660800,3,1712,4.263975155279503
5720407,5,B00CENSU1W,"The Blue Ray edition comes with the DVD disc, and a digital voucher to download.

I won't talk about the story other than, it follows it's source material closer than any other DC
animated adaption, save for the Dark Knight Returns of course. We also get a condensed story about
Barry Allen, The Flash, that will stay in the fans memory for a long time.

I am overjoyed that this is not another Superman, or Batman film because Warner Bros feels
they need to take less risks by titling bigger known properties. There is a semblance of convenience of
titling it ""Justice League"" with Flash as the main focus. No lie, no false advertisement, just an overabundance
of cameos that could have been fleshed out better, but are very useful even if it's just a few minutes.

Guys don't pirate this. This is $15 Blue Ray combo with special features that carry 3 episodes of Bruce
Timm's Justice League, audio commentary, a preview at Justice League: War, a digital comicbook
of the original Flashpoint event, and a feature discussion on paradoxical time travel.

Dana Delany is Lois Lane here, Ron Pearlman is Slade/DeathStroke, and Yo-Yo the character is voiced by a past actress of Harley Quinn. The reason is obvious of course. Kevin Conroy continues to succeed as his Batman, Vanessa Marshall brings her A-game as Wonder Woman from Crisis on Two Earths. The son of Tim Daly from the 90's Superman: The Animated Series sounds just like his father. Kevin McKidd delivers as an even darker and grittier Thomas Wayne Batman, a shocker truly. His incarnation could get his own series and succeed. C. H. Thomas Howell will make you hate Professor Zoom, and that's precisely the point: he's a villain first.

Not everything is entirely spot on, at least when it comes to the character designs of Superman and Aquaman. The body-proportions are ridiculous. I've watched Young Justice, and the Superman seen in that show has you wondering how they arrived at changing the designs for male metahumans. The size of Clark Kent's head looks insignificant compared to the rest of physique. Wonder-Woman on the other hand looks beautiful beyond any human athlete, and Batman looks like an anime character, but that's alright because he's Batman. He can get away with it.

This is such a diverse and reprising cast, probably better coordinated by the director here than any previous works. This is such a good alterna-verse take on the Detective Comics lore.

One warning though: This movie is pretty dark, you probably don't want any kids under 13 looking at this. The contents of this production are a step away from the source material that could be used to animate The Killing Joke one day. Almost everything to be weary of is in here. I'll give you a hint as to how graphic this becomes: a warlord Wonder Woman interacting with children characters. It's so dark, it goes there.

One more thing: Yes, the female Joker, THAT Joker is in here. DC threw a bone to the fans of the concept. Now what I want is an extended rerelease with 30 to 45 minutes more of footage. So far, I am leaning toward giving this cut a perfect review. DC animation is at it's prime, especially in the summer time. So far, it's a 4.8 on the scale of 1 to 5!",1375660800,2,3214,4.676106194690266
5720408,5,B00CENSU1W,"First off this comment is largely in response to comments highly critical of this story and the greater depth and more adult nature of the DC comics(which I love and am very excited about) of recent/not so recent past, present and i presume future. I understand if you do not wish to witness the brutality and despair that made up a great deal of this story, which is definitely not intended for children and that, I would agree, should be rated-R. But I don't understand how adults with an analytical mind can't if not enjoy in a light hearted way at least appreciate the meaning of a story such as this. It wasn't just the absence of Superman(although of course that would have a great impact) in my opinion that caused the shift in these characters. It is just a reminder and realization that these characters and personas choose to be heroic they choose goodness compassion and bravery in the face of everything they have been through but that they could just as easily choose to feed into their individual weakness. I loved the movie although it was shocking at times it reminded me what I love most about these characters, that they have realness despite the fantasy elements and that they make people who identify with the stories want to be better people to choose to be better people. I mean come on don't you people have hearts this story was heartbreaking. I mean Bruce got a letter through space time and dimension from his father. My eyes started watering. It was beautiful. Barry Allen is a hero. And I do agree that there is plenty of child friendly dc comics entertainment out there, actually that has been the bulk of their output to date. I guess i think its refreshing to to have a little more depth to these stories I think the character deserve it and are much too powerful symbolically to be deprived of it any longer.  I really loved this film as I have all the recent dc animated universe features. Thanks

Grant me the serenity to accept the things
I cannot change,

I can,

The animation to me seemed lacking in character and flow. The story was well done to mix the elements of Flashpoint to movie length. The books did a better job of showing how good characters can be evil due to circumstance which this film brushed off. It was entertaining though, and in the end that is the most important part.",1375574400,,505,4.382978723404255
5720410,3,B00CENSU1W,"Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox is a different direction for Warner Bros. Animation. The art style is more edgy and actually quite a bit like anime with hard, angular lines. The action is also more violent and not light on gore. It's interesting to see this kind of take on the Animated DC Universe, and it does kind of fit the ""alternate universe"" storyline of the film, but I personally didn't care for it much. It felt too far removed from the classic animation that makes the DC Animated films great.

I'm definitely glad that WB Animation is trying something new, though. This style does have its high points, such as portraying The Flash doing cool Flash things, like seeing the world in slow-mo and breaking the space/time continuum. It actually recalled Takeshi Koike's Animatrix short ""World Record"".

In the end, JL: The Flashpoint Paradox is a weird entry into the DC Animated canon, but in it the filmmakers tried something new, and I would never fault anyone for that. Besides, it's great to see Flash get his own movie! Hopefully, here's to a Flash feature film.",1375574400,,1083,4.786096256684492

I had always seen the Justice League and the DC Universe in general as more static and simplistic than the Marvel Comic Universe. but I've gotten in to the Justice League DVD releases recently and I have to say I'm starting to change my mind. The story centers around the Flash this time, who wakes up after an encounter with his arch rival in a world completely flipped upside down. Aquaman and Wonder Woman have turned a lover's quarrel into a Genocidal War based that has Earth on the brink of destruction. It is Thomas Wayan who dawns the cape of Batman, while Bruce is the one died on that fateful night in an abandoned alley. Flash has no powers, and on top of it all, in this world no one has ever heard of a Hero called ""Superman."" With the help of this reality's Batman, The Flash must recreate the experiment that gave him his powers as well as determine what in the past has been changed to create this bleak present. It's super-uber comic book style nerdy and is not for the casual fan, but if you're in to superheroes,  alternate realities, or science fiction, this is a great story. It's quite violent and graphic though, so I would not recommend this story for young children.  Keep doing what you're with the DC Universe. I hope you can keep this stories coming.

Watching this film I couldn't help but notice that it appeared to be animated by the same team that created Young Justice.  The detail and attention is there to make the characters look more gritty and realistic in a Dark Knight vein.

The movie is drawn with Anime Style Influences and the pace is brisk and exciting throughout.  It definitely helps to know more about the DC Universe, and if you do, you will have a better understanding of who certain characters are and their relationships to one another.  However, it is a complete story in itself and can be enjoyed by itself.

The basic premise is that The Flash runs and breaks the time barrier and changes a simple event in the past, which creates huge ripples in the future.  His one single action created an entirely different world.  And not for the better.

Superheroes you know and love are presented in a different light, and some are the most violent I have ever seen in a DC Animated movie.  It is a pretty violent cartoon as there are heads decapitated and people get shot and killed left and right.  It fits the mood of the movie, but it is not suitable for children.  It was definitely aimed more for a mature audience.

Trust me, you've never seen Aquaman like this before!  He ain't no guppy in this film.

What bothered me was this is rated PG-13 so it's geared towards 13 year olds and under. This should have been an R rated movie for the amount of violence alone. I would have been mad if I was watching this with my nieces and nephews.

5720425,2,B00CENSU1W,"An almost anime style surprised me about the beginning, which was kinda different given the great animation on Young Justice and DC's last movie or too but once the obligatory use of profanity occured (a recent trend in dc movies), I was like, not this one too. And it happened four more times including a kid saying a word. Then violent killings were shown, including the death of child which went way too far
in a movie that stars characters largely marketed to kids. Contrary to popular belief, neither of those elements are really necessary to make an animated movie more real. And though I'm a long time fan and supporter of DC product, I don't have to like every movie or show they make. There were moments I liked such as the multiple cameos including both Aqualads, Manta, Captain Atom, Captain Marvel and others. The different takes on both Superman and Batman were really good. And they finally got Lois Lane's look and voice right. Wonder Woman, not so much, looking like Celine Dion. It was super great that someone other than Batman and Superman was the star of a Justice League movie. But again, the visible deaths and profanity prevented me from truly enjoying the film.

I agree with some of the viewers that if you have kids, you may want to screen it first as it does deal with some mature themes, but all in all, it was so cool to see so many DC characters in this film.  For myself, I was left feeling some kind of way seeing some characters being dispatched or in ways (behaviorally) that I'm not used to.

Batman has a major role in this movie too, so that was a bonus, because I was expecting more of a cameo from him.

I'm a huge fan of the Bruce Timm DC era.  I own every episode of BAS, Superman, Batman Beyond, JL, JLU and every straight to DVD movie they have put out.  I was extremely worried that the new members of the production crew would drop the quality bar that had been set over the past 20 years.  I'm so glad that I was wrong.

I enjoy having a great WHAT IF? storyline throw my way every once in a while.  I buy a lot of TPBs and some of my favorites are those that are not taken from the mainline books, but from mini-series by creators who just like to tell good stories with established characters.  Cosmic Odyssey, The Nail 1&2, etc...

This film feels exactly like those books to me.  I was blown away by the story.  The concept of some of these characters had never even occurred to me, and I love just talking to my co-workers about it.  Fresh ideas with a lot of fun twists on old faces (pun intended, watch it and you'll understand).

The animation is pretty amazing and I love the style of the characters.  Fun proportions, graphic and smoothly animated.  A lot of foreshortening and great dynamics.  I'm also an artist by trade and I find this movie to be very inspiring.

Without Superman around to take care of these two, the rest of the ""heros"" are forced to just play along and are basically helpless.

I think the author of this tale wanted to show us how violent Wonder Woman can actually be, killing an unarmed man and also a 10 year old child, in cold blood! I guess that is funny these days.

5720442,5,B00CENSU1W,"I have never really been much of a DC Comics fan, I was mainly a Marvel X-Men fan.  The few DC titles I had collected were Batman related.  I have however seen most of the DC Animated movies and have really enjoyed most of them.  I was out of comics when Flashpoint hit comic stores, so I missed the event.  I kept hearing about ""Pre-Flashpoint"" references in the comic podcast and forums.  When I heard about this video coming out, I knew I needed to see just to ""get"" the reference.  I was hoping for good things as most of the DC movies have been good.  Boy, I was BLOWN AWAY at how good this movie was.  I will try to be non-spoilery in the review, but have to mention some points for the review
The animation is excellent, it is done in a more anime style instead of the Tim Bruce Batman the Animated series style.  It is similar to the animation style of ""Young Justice"", another DC show that was very good.  I don't know how faithful the writing is to the comics, but the writing was superb.  It starts with a tragedy that shapes a hero.  This will have far reaching consequences for everyone in the DCU.  The various sides of the conflict were interesting.  Heroes against Heroes, Villians teaming up with Heroes.  And Heroes not necessarily the person they people they were pre-Flashpoint.  It was exciting to see the different sides going at each other.  The main cause of the conflict in the story was interesting pitting Amazon vs Atlanteans in a blood feud.  And to take a character I was always kinda lukewarm about (the Barry Allen Flash) and make him a kick butt hero was cool to see.
I would rate this video as one of the best DC Animated Movies I have ever seen!!!!  It is up there for me with Dark Knight movie and Under the Red Hood as one of best DC Animated Movies around.  Buy it, Rent it, borrow it!! Just please see this movie!!",1375401600,,1853,4.315942028985507

5720444,5,B00CENSU1W,"""Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox"" is a revelation.  An all-too-rare gem of a film that goes to places with classic comic book superheroes you can't imagine any group of filmmakers would dare.  It's one thing to read and see a story like this on the page.  It's an entirely different thing to experience it on a visceral level as a motion picture.

Based upon the DC comics storyline ""Flashpoint"" by Geoff Johns, ""The Flashpoint Paradox"" is - at heart - an emotional, introspective journey centered on one of DC's lesser-known heroes, Barry Allen aka the Flash.

Screenwriter Jim Krieg skillfully manages to adapt most of Johns' main storyline while adding an original prologue that emotionally anchors the film in Barry Allen's tragic childhood loss of his mother, and the guilt he carries into his adult life in not having saved her life.  Krieg has also scripted a smart, humorous and sophisticated opening action sequence involving the main Justice League characters.  Like most great screenwriters, Krieg knows if you're going to deconstruct the most famous DC superheroes throughout your script, showing them as brutal vigilantes and ruthless killers for the balance the film, you better first give them all a moment to shine at their heroic best.

This is a time-travel story into an alternative universe, and following these opening scenes, Barry Allen awakes from dozing-off at his workstation to find a world inverted.  DC's most enduring heroes are now the most violent, out-of-control threat the planet has ever faced.

Bruce Wayne was killed, not his parents.  His father Thomas Wayne is the Batman, an alcoholic consumed by loss who dispatches his victims with a gun in each hand or a toss off a rooftop.  Aquaman and Wonder Woman are at war, with the Amazons having invaded the UK, slaughtering millions, and turning it into their new Paradise Island.  Kal-El didn't land in Kansas to be raised by the Kents.  He instead crash landed in Metropolis, where he has been kept underground and experimented on by the government.

In 1985 when Alan Moore was developing the graphic novel ""Watchmen,"" his intent was to utilize established superheroes from the Charlton Comics line that DC had just purchased.  DC managing editor Dick Giodano vetoed the idea, concerned that depicting the characters in a ""dysfunctional"" manner, or showing them being killed off in the mini-series would hurt their `brand potential.'

The approach producer James Tucker, writer Jim Krieg and director Jay Oliva have taken in adapting ""Flashpoint"" is in many ways what Moore wanted to do with ""Watchmen."" Moore had reasoned ""as long as readers recognized them (the characters) ... `it would have the shock and surprise value when you saw what the reality of these characters was.' ""  Or, in the case of ""The Flashpoint Paradox,"" when you see what the reality of the characters are in a dark alternative universe.

While the alternate universe `versions' of Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman and Aquaman are the result of an anomaly in the `DC timeline,' seeing them commit graphic acts of violence and murder against each other, additional characters from the DC Universe, and a global mass populous elicits a very disturbing and shocking viewing experience.  Like the DCUAOM release ""Batman: The Dark Knight Rises Part 2,"" the level of graphic violence makes it inconceivable that the MPAA gave the film a PG-13 rating as opposed to a R rating.

But, let's be very clear on this point.  Every moment of graphic violence, adult language and mature situations is VITAL to making this film work on a complex sophisticated level very much in the vein of Bryan Singer's two `X-MEN' films, Zach Snyder's adaptation of ""WATCHMEN,"" and Christopher Nolan's `DARK KNIGHT' trilogy.  This is a film for adults, not kids.  To water it down is to destroy it artistically.

Like the ""Watchmen"" graphic novel and Zach Snyder's feature adaptation of it, ""The Flashpoint Paradox"" is a film for adults who aren't afraid to explore the dark notion proposed by Johns' ""Flashpoint"" series.  A dark notion that ""The Flashpoint Paradox"" brings to full fruition with maximum emotional and intellectual impact.  Namely, dark consequences would befall powerful superheroes and the world if one tragic twist of fate impacted their lives on a deeply traumatic emotional level.

The film is able to reach these heights thanks to just how far the creative team was prepared to go, and how high they were willing to claw their way up to reach.

Director Jay Oliva (""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns"") knows how to do action - he was one of Zach Snyder's storyboard artists on ""Man of Steel.""  With ""The Flashpoint Paradox"" he has deftly mixed multiple approaches in character design and animation techniques.  Traditional anime, anatomic realism and exaggerated physique designs vary from scene to scene.  This yields a wider range of emotions than the previous DCUAOMs Justice League titles have contained and explored, save ""New Frontier.""  The results also pay-off in a higher level of kinetic energy in his action sequences.  At times, all three animation approaches appear on screen at once - with the genius being it all rings true and works.

Legendary Casting and Voice Director Andrea Romano's work on the film yields phenomenal detail.  Justin Chambers (""Grey's Anatomy"") delivers the best Barry Allen/The Flash performance in a DCUAOM since Neil Patrick Harris portrayed the character in 2008's ""Justice League: The New Frontier.""  Chambers' balances a newfound level of gravitas for Barry Allen with the humor that has always been a key element of the character.

C. Thomas Howell buries himself in the roll of Professor Zoom, and its obvious he had a ball playing the film's central villain.  Michael R. Jordan (currently starring in ""Fruitvale Station"") walks the line between sincerity and naivety as Cyborg without ever giving into being less than the best soldier the US has.  Cary Elwes (""The Princess Bride,"" ""Saw"") gives a majestic, bold and tense presence to his role as Aquaman.

Towering above them all is Kevin McKidd (also from ""Grey's Anatomy"") as Thomas Wayne, aka Flashpoint Batman.  Disillusioned, cynical, unpredictable and violent, McKidd's performance is laced with both overt and repressed rage throughout.  Yet, he hits great beats of humor and pathos.

This time out, the detail in Romano's Casting Work is amazing.  Both ""Batman,"" ""Superman"" and ""Justice League"" animated series veterans Kevin Conroy, Dana Delany and Nathan Fillion are back in their roles as Batman, Lois Lane and Green Lantern.  The fact their appearances are virtually cameos didn't deter her from getting them.  More importantly, their performances add just as much as the lead actors' do to the overall artistry of the piece as a phenomenal example of `Ensemble Acting' in an Animated Motion Picture.  Romano even managed to get Ron Perlman (""Pacific Rim,"" ""Hellboy"") and Danny Huston (""Hitchcock,"" ""Wrath of the Titans"") to take very minor roles.

Getting Conroy back was of vital creative importance for the film's final and very emotional closing scene.  It's worth crediting his loyalty to DC Animation that he recognized, for this film, his small contribution was major.

Frederik Wiedmann's original score must be given its due as well.  Rich and layered with textures specifically designed for the emotional range of the film, Wiedmann also delivers distinct themes for the Amazons, Aquaman's army, the Flash, and Flashpoint Batman.  Here's hoping when Christopher Drake isn't available to score future DCUAOMs, Wiedmann gets the assignments.

Finally, DC Animation Supervising Producer James Tucker must be acknowledged for his courage and artistic integrity in backing the film's daring content and artistic achievement.

His statements to the press upon replacing Bruce Timm as the DC Animation Supervising Producer made it clear that DCUAOMs were headed in a new, commercial direction. No longer would direct adaptations of graphic novels be done as DCUAOMs (""Batman: Year One,"" ""The Dark Knight Returns""), and `brand names' like `Justice League' would be embraced as vehicles to introduce new characters.  After DC Animation's announcement that two `Justice League' titles in 2013 would be followed by two `Batman' titles in 2014, it seemed DC Animation was possibly being co-opted by the Warner Bros. Live Action division to support and promote their plans for a JLA film, along with Zach Snyder's challenge in rebooting Batman for his ""Man of Steel"" sequel.

However, if ""Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox"" is indicative of how Tucker plans to meld any potential Warner-Bros. mandated commercialism and cross-promotion of DCUAOMs with his team still taking huge creative risks and maintaining the artistic integrity of DCUAOMs, Tucker is truly taking DC Animation and their films into a new, exciting and subversive direction for fans.

If the upcoming ""Justice League: War"" and ""Batman and Son"" are as daring, uncompromising, challenging and adult as ""Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox,"" James Tucker will have initial nay-Sayers like myself eating crow and crying `mea-culpa' pretty damn fast.",1375401600,3,9186,5.201766304347826

It's great to see Flash in a staring role.  However, I'm not sure why DC felt the need to make this a Japanimation effort.  Much, not all, but much of the voice acting was typical wooden Japanimation voice acting.  Cyborg and Aquaman are good examples.  I dunno, instead of feeling like a DC original like those before it, it felt like a Japanimation bastardization of comic book characters that are so familiar to me.  Like their likenesses were hijacked to sell a few dvds.  They deserve better.

I give it 2 stars for story and it being a mature cartoon.  Most DC fans will like it for sure.  I was just disappointed.  Not my favorite style I suppose.  I would recommend a rental over purchase.",1375315200,,855,4.356687898089172

The Flash wakes up in a world counting down to doomsday, and he's the only one that can stop it.

It's amazing what they managed to accomplish in only 81 minutes. It's as good as any episode of Justice League Unlimited. You should be cautious, because it is very bloody.

Unlike previous adaptations, they didn't try to imitate the art by Andy Kubert, instead they used the ""house style"" from Studio 4C, the Japanese Animation Studio responsible (most recently) for the Berserk movies. You can see it in the bits of CGI throughout the film. It looks fantastic, and you can also spot all sorts of character models carried over from Young Justice.

Seriously, let me reiterate, don't let kids watch this because no one is ""safe.""

If I can say one thing, that is I really like Cyborg in this. Previously, Cyborg's inclusion really felt like a token gesture. This movie, I feel, really legitimizes his inclusion in the Justice League. But, besides that, it really is a Flash centric story. We get so few movies that don't focus on Superman or Batman, hopefully this will prove that other heroes can carry films. I really love this movie.

Extras on the Bluray include

Audio Commentary with the Writer (Jim Kreig), Director (Jay Olivia), Producer (James Tucker), and the original author of the comic (Geoff Johns). I loved this commentary track.

A Flash in Time - A short featurette about the possibility of time travel. Honestly, it's not that informative. That's what happens when you try to explain theoretical physics in layman's terms. It's 20 minutes I'll never get back.

My Favorite Villain! The Flash Bad Guys - a 20-minutes look at the Flash's Rogues with Geoff Johns.

Four episodes: ""Flash and Substance"" featuring the Rogues from Justice League Unlimited, ""Legends"" parts 1&2 from Justice League, which is about alternate dimensions, and ""Requiem for a Scarlet Speedster"" from Batman the Brave and the Bold featuring the three people to use the name the Flash.

And a Sneak Peak at Justice League War, a reboot of the Justice League.

The whole film may include the rest of the JL, but this film is most decidely told from the Flash's point of view.  It also is another example how Geoff John's storytelling ability cannot be appreciated enough.  The Flash has taken a back seat to several characters before, notably ""The Big Three"",  but this movie shows how interesting the Flash is as a character individually.  It does not hide him in the crowd, but puts him front and center.  Well worth a watch or two.",1375315200,,567,4.509803921568627

I knew in advance this would have altered main characters per the video synopsis. I must say this is far removed from any past Justice League conceptualizations I have seen and I have seen them all, both good and bad. One of the most disturbing traits of this video is the extreme dark atmosphere presented even considering that this was supposed to be an altered time line and what the plot centered around. Comics and animation used to be more appropriate for children and adults alike.  Unfortunately, the newer ones are largely rubbish and not appropriate for any discerning audience and most certainly not for children.

What if pivotal events in the DC universe changed slightly to reshape our favorite super heroes and even some of the villains through a time travel butterfly effect inadvertently created by the Flash?  That is the basic premise of this film and it sure does deliver some surprises.  Not only have pivotal events changed, but a couple of members of the JL have destroyed Western Europe in their continuing battle for dominance over the planet. And nobody has even heard of Superman!
It was so enjoyable that I actually watched it twice in the first 24 hours, which is something I rarely ever do with movies.  I can't recommend this movie enough to comic book & DC fans who enjoy alternate time line themed stories.  And if you're a parent, and are considering buying this for your young super hero fan, I would recommend watching this through first before allowing your child to watch it.  It's not for young kids and has some disturbingly violent scenes that are actually more like 'Game of Thrones' than your typical animated super hero film.",1375315200,,1123,4.762886597938144

Overall good art direction. Story was fantastic! I didn't read the books based on this so I was really intrigued and was happily surprised with the small twists.

Best part is that the blu-ray/dvd/ultra-violet combo was only $13! Happy customer and for sure to be keeping this in my collection for friends to watch.",1375315200,,487,4.597701149425287
5720459,5,B00CENSU1W,"Please note that this review contains spoilers.

Can even Superman survive when the power of the atom is released?

In this alternate reality of a world gone mad, it seems as if everyone dies, including Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg, Lex Luther, and many other ""heroes and villains"".

This is all caused by the Flash when he travels back in time to change an important event in his life.  This change goes horribly wrong by creating major ripples in time, leading to an all out and devasting war between the underwater people of Atlantis and the warrior Amazon women.

How does this war start?  Picture the somewhat graphic image of Queen Diana (Wonder Woman) of the Amazons holding in her hand the lifeless head of Queen Mera, wife of King Aquaman of Atlantis....  By the end of this saga, the war becomes all consuming and horrific in its nature.

Please note that there are many graphic images, including the usual guns and bullets, arrows and swords, blood and gore, people pounding with no mercy on people, and of people being blown to bits.  There are sea monsters, helping Atlantis, and land monsters from Greek mythology, helping the Amazons.  I don't want to overstate the violence, but you may want to preview this animated war film.  For many, it may not be appropriate for young children.  This is not your usual Saturday children's animated hero show.

However, there is one graphic scene with Queen Diana (Wonder Woman) that really shocked me.  In this segment, Queen Diana battles a Captain Marvel like character and subdues him with her magic lasso.  Queen Diana forces him to say Shazam,  reverting him back to 6 children.  Off camera, Queen Diana puts one of the kids to the sword (and presumably the other 5 kids as well!).  Wow, that really stunned me.

Furthermore, wonder what happens when Queen Diana meets Steve Trevor?  Well, their first meeting is his last meeting.

Aquaman is equally evil and without mercy.  He thrusts his trident into Lex Luther and rips Cyborg apart, piece by piece, revealing Cyborg's beating heart.  And Aquaman plays a pivotal part in starting the war when he commits a major indiscretion, showing a great lapse in moral judgement.

By the decisions made by Aquaman and Queen Diana, parts of the earth are laid waste.

The main characters in this film are Flash, Batman, and Cyborg, along with Aquaman and Wonder Woman.  Superman's character and Hal Jordan play minor roles.  There are quite a few supporting characters including versions of Aqualad, Black Manta, Ocean Master, and assorted villains and heroes.

Finally, on an emotional note, there is Barry Allen (Flash) and his relationship with his mother and there is an unusual twist involving Bruce Wayne and his father, Dr. Wayne.  There is also a tragic and not so funny implied twist regarding Bruce Wayne's mother....  She's quite mad, just like this twisted alternate world.",1375315200,3,2895,4.885010266940451
5720460,5,B00CENSU1W,"I've been a big fan of these DC Original Animated movies for a long time now and they really keep getting better and better.  I didn't think they could do better after they released The Dark Knight Returns but flashpoint really gives it a run for its money.  I love this arc in the comics and its a cool new take on all the justice league characters and adds a lot of fun what if's.

They did a great job of telling the main story as well as adding elements from the tie in comics.  The batman and wonder woman tie ins were all most as good as the original story so its good to see some of those elements make it in the movie.

I've never really cared for the flash as a character but this story has so much great things going on that even if you aren't interested in the flash or don't like the flash its still very enjoyable.

As was mentioned in other reviews it gets pretty violent and there is a little swearing.  Probably not more than you would see in the Dark Knight but still probably not for very young children.",1375315200,,1022,4.1313131313131315

There, that's your plot of this movie. Unlike all the other JL movies out there, this one is violent, really violent I think with a little more it could've gotten an (R) rating but it's good.

However, I gave it 4 stars out of 5 because of the animation. In a bias view, I do not particularity care for the design of the characters. Superman, Batman, Flash, and Aqua-man were way too big. I'm talking excessively huge. Even for superman I thought his sized was major exaggerated.

5720464,5,B00CENSU1W,"Before I review this let me establish a few key facts about myself.  I am a reader of Marvel Comics and NOT DC.  Not because I think they're worse but because I don't have time to keep up with both so I stick to Marvel.  So, I don't know the source material and can't judge this movie based on any comparisons.  That being said, I LOVE the DC animated movies and the Marvel ones can't compare.  I buy them all pretty much the day they come out and have yet to regret a purchase.  Review time:

This may just be the best one since 'Batman: Under the Red Hood' which I still think is awesome!  This one involves an alternate reality, similar to how 'Crisis on Two Earths' did, but focuses more on the Flash than the other Justice Leaguers.  Definitely worth the watch!",1375228800,,766,4.263888888888889

For starters, it's main focus is the Flash, which is great because most movies like this usually give Superman, Batman, or Wonder Woman all the screen time and glory. I must warn however that as great as this film is, it is definitely not intended for little kids due to the violence. I'd even go so far as saying it's more violent than the Original Uncut Version of the DCAU film Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker. All in all, I definitely recommend it for anyone except little kids.",1375228800,2,544,4.561224489795919

I loved the comics and after watching the movie I was not disappointed. The movie is very dark and gritty and for mature audiences only. I find it refreshing to see characters out of their norm in a different point of view. This movie has a great story line and I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves DC comics.,1375228800,,464,4.224719101123595
5720467,3,B00CENSU1W,"SPOILERS! Also, this is NOT a kid friendly movie!

First off, I want to say that I was very hyped for this film. I prefer DC alternate reality stories, and it was ""Flashpoint"" that got me back into reading comics on a regular basis.

So, why am I only giving this two stars? Because if I hadn't read the comics at first, I would've had no clue what was going on by just watching the film. I mean, there really doesn't seem to be any transition from the Old DC Universe to the Flashpoint Universe, the way it's edited really seems like a plot hole. It does effectively convey that we learn what's happened alongside the Flash, but it really seems like a scene was skipped there, it goes from normal to him waking up at his desk at work and everything's changed! Although, in hindsight I guess revealing how the alternate universe occurs pretty much tells the end of the film, but maybe that montage of changed events playing over him sleeping at the desk would've been less awkward in the story telling aspect.

About mid-way into the film we get a montage of sorts of the changes in events that led to the current state of the Flashpoint Universe but it just comes out of nowhere telling us what happened to Superman, Batman, and Aquaman and Wonder Woman. Really, I believe the film could have been edited better to make it easier to follow as a story rather than a jumble that I was really only able to make sense of because I had read the entire comics series.

That being said, they made a lot of changes to the story from the comics as well. Now please understand that I do understand that they need to make some changes for cinematic purposes, but they completely changed the reason why the Amazons VS Atlanteans War was started! In the film the reason is Mera tries to kill Wonder Woman for sleeping with Aquaman and then Wonder Woman kills Queen Mera of Atlantis thus starting the war. In the comics Aquaman and Wonder Woman were going to marry as a political wedding combining Themyscira and Atlantis, but a conspiracy from both sides decides to destroy the wedding by framing Garth (the original Aqualad) as the assassin of Queen Hippolyta, Wonder Woman's mother. Wonder Woman kills Mera much later on though in the comics. Now, to me, that's a huge change from the source material. Other things are trivial like Abin Sur still being dead but Hal not being the Green Lantern (in the comics Hal wasn't the Green Lantern because Abin Sur was still alive and helping Cyborg), or Captain Atom being there (in the comics Captain Nathaniel Adams never became Captain Atom, and the Atlantean Destruction machine was powered by Geo-Force), and they never really mentioned that ""Citizen Cold"" is a hero, except for having him there as a hologram. We never really got to see Martha Wayne as the Joker, and they dropped Frankenstein and the Creature Commandos, Element Lady, and some other characters.

I'll admit, the comics series itself was very expansive and surprisingly they did touch on a lot of the characters. I was surprised by their working in Deathstroke and the Resistance.

If you've read the comics then this film is a cool companion film to watch. I think the sequencing of some of the film could've been handled a lot better so it'd flow better as a movie, and it could've been a bit more faithful to the comics.

I think what it really comes down to is that you can't tell that expansive of a story and do it justice in 90 minutes. I mean, ""The Dark Knight Returns"" they broke down into two films but comics wise was less issues than what it they did for ""Flashpoint"".

Sincerely,
Exchronos",1375228800,2,3606,4.554012345679013
5720468,5,B00CENSU1W,"When the Flash cranks up the superspeed and travels back in time to right a painful wrong, the timeline is drastically altered and he awakes in a present that's not the one he knows. There's a war raging between the Atlanteans and Amazons, Batman uses guns, Cyborg works for the government and Superman is nowhere to be found. Worse, the Flash no longer has his superpowers thus cannot travel back in time to repair the damage and restore the timeline to the one he knew.

Powerless and with no Justice League to turn to, the Flash must decide how he's going to change the course of history and if he's willing to lose someone he loves in the effort to save the lives of many.

This flick is the ultimate fanboy trip for Flash lovers. He's the main character and this is the first time in DC animated movie history that he gets the focus. You got superspeed, time travel, alternate timelines, the Speedforce and more. Way cool and, frankly, it's about time DC took a break from Superman and Batman as the go-to guys for movies, even in the context of a JLA movie. With a new Flash TV series in production as of this review, I'm thinking this was DC's way of priming the pump, so to speak, to get audiences ready for more adventures with the Scarlet Speedster.

This movie's strength lies in two areas: the Flash, and time travel.

On the Flash: you got a quick recap of his origin, a real sense for what drives Barry Allen, multiple amazing displays of superspeed (especially that running sequence at the end), and a hero to root for from start to finish. I loved it. As a DC guy, I like the Flash, but this film really made me appreciate him and care for him all the more as it gave a strong face to his mythology and character.

On time travel: I love time travel stories. The more scientifically accurate and plausible the better, but I'll take just about any story that deals with time travel, parallel universes and butterfly effects. I write about that stuff in my own fiction, for crying out loud. Here, DC went to great lengths to explain the time travel in a plausible way and apply what we know of its possibility as realistically as possible in the context of the movie. Nice. The DVD extras that go further into this are an added bonus for us time travel enthusiasts and are much appreciated.

Storywise, I loved this movie and the twists and turns it took made me go, ""Man, that's awesome,"" more than once. When I found out the history behind the Batman of the alternate timeline I went nuts. So cool and so utterly tragic. Perfect for Batman. And Superman's portrayal in the alternate timeline? Crazy! Putting all that against a backdrop of an Atlantean vs Amazon war added a breath of fresh air to DC's animated movies because, like I said, it was relieving to stay away from putting the spotlight on Superman or Batman. (Granted, Batman plays a big part in this movie, but in such a way that it's not our Batman but another, which makes it fresh.)

The animated style chosen for this flick I wasn't crazy about at first, to be honest. The small heads and wider bodies looked weird. It grows on you, though, and eventually you get used to it. The color scheme and bleak tone throughout added to the overall feel of what was a heavy story, thus sucking you in further.

This is not a movie for kids, though. There's a lot of violence and gore, adult themes and some language. While I appreciate ""grown up"" superhero movies, I wish these elements would be scaled back a bit so I could show my kids these flicks and go on super adventures with them instead of having to shelve the DVD until they're older so they can watch it.

From a superhero fan's standpoint, Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox is a stellar movie adapted from the graphic novel by Geoff Johns and Andy Kubert.

The extra features are fantastic as well. There's one about time travel and the physics of it, and about the main villains that are featured in the movie. Get this movie!! If you've liked any of the other ones that have come out, you will love this one. It's even better than Under The Red Hood and Superman: Unbound.

I've enjoyed many of the DC animated titles but feel as they edged towards the New 52 I have been left unsatisfied.  The movie isn't for kids and given the level of violence and death not sure if 13 years of age is even appropriate.  The story was compelling and the characters really interesting.  They included some good twists, but the death and destruction was played for shock value and very often did little to advance the plot (IMHO).  I am trying not to give too much here but also found that while some of the logic in why what happened I could see, some of it I just couldn't.  That is a sign of lazy writing.  Also some of the character drawings just seemed to be a poor design choice(mainly Aquaman).

Overall I was left with a violent movie that again drags our heroes down in to the mud.  A plot that is good however seems a bit contrived and a style that at times was jarring.  In the end this was a good movie that due to these reasons I thought could have been better at times.  Hence the 3 star rating.",1375142400,,1133,4.175115207373272
5720488,5,B00CENSU1W,"Who doesnt love alternate versions of beloved stories? Some of my favorite episodes of Friends are the what could have been episodes. I mean who doesnt love fat Monica? When I first read Flashpoint it was already in graphic novel form. I couldn't put it down. It was fascinating to see some of the DCs biggest heroes in a new world. Some were still heroes. Some had turned into.

The story was exciting. Putting Flash as your central character is a great way to make your story upbeat and fast paced(literally). It was shocking. Seeing Aquaman and Wonder Woman going head to head while destroying the world was one of the most unexpected moves I could think of, and I loved every moment. Most of all it was touching. The story revolves around Barry Allens(The Flash) guilt and regret of his mothers murder when he was a boy. The ending to Flashpoint makes me teary eyed every time. Youll have to read and or watch the film to see it. Its worth the wait.

When the schedules were released for this years San Diego Comic Con there was one panel that got me beyond excited. The world premier of The Flashpoint Paradox with a panel to follow. Two years ago they had premiered Batman: Year One at a different comic con and I had thought about how amazing that must have been to see the premier of a beloved comic book adaptation with other huge comic book fans. Well this year I got to experience that, and It  lived up to the excitement.

The environment was amazing. The cheers and crowd interaction was awesome. It was apparent from the first five minutes of the film this was not a kiddie movie, but in fact an adult superhero film that uses animation as its medium. The movie did such a great job adapting the comic into an hour and half storyline. Also the cameos of alternate versions of beloved DC characters is so numerous Im sure you have to watch multiple times to catch them all. This film was by far my favorite of the already amazing DCU animated films. It is honestly one of my favorite superhero films ever, and easily my favorite comic to film adaptation. I highly recommend this to anyone who is slightly interested in DC or to the most hardcore of fans. You will love it. I can(almost) guarantee it.

Instantly, Days of Future Past sticks out as one of the cornerstone stories (from Marvel's X-Men universe) in which sentinels are in charge of a desolate future, due to an assassination that sends the future of civilization into a tailspin of horrors.  Now, there have been numerous alternate reality stories over the years, but perhaps none more important to a company than DC's 2011 Flashpoint storyline - a miniseries that's responsible for transitioning to DC's NEW 52 universe.  The status quo changes heavily after the events of the Flashpoint series, essentially allowing DC to ""freshen up"" their brand for the future (costumes, character origin updates, etc.) - but we're getting ahead of ourselves.  Before DC Animation adopts the NEW 52 brand, their newest animation interpretation brings the events for Flashpoint to life in the original animated movie, The Flashpoint Paradox.

Directed by Jay Oliva (Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 & 2), The Flashpoint Paradox begins with Barry Allen aka The Flash (voiced by Justin Chambers) visiting his mother's grave.  As part of an ambush, The Flash is attached by several villains from his rogues gallery, including Captain Boomerang, Captain Cold, and Eobard Thawne aka Professor Zoom/Reverse Flash (C. Thomas Howell).  With the assistance of his fellow Justice League members, Flash is able to defeat the villains.  However, when he awakens the following morning, the world has changed.  Barry's mother is alive, Bruce Wayne is dead, and the world is at war with Atlanteans and Amazons, which includes Aquaman and Wonder Woman.  Not only are Aquaman (Cary Elwes) and Wonder Woman (Vanessa Marshall) villains to the world - no one has ever heard of Superman.  Desperate to make the world right, Barry enlists the help of the alternate future's Batman (Kevin McKidd) and Cyborg (Michael B. Jordan) in order to discover the reason for the timeline's change and help him set things right.  The voices of Nathan Fillion, Dana Delany, Sam Daly, and Kevin Conroy also star in supporting roles.

While members of the Justice League are present throughout the course of this film, make no mistake about it - this film focuses solely on The Flash.  Over the course of DC's animation history, The Flash has been pretty heavily overlooked in comparison to Batman, Superman, Green Lantern, and Wonder Woman.  Finally, The Flash has a standalone story where he has the focus set squarely on him and his talents are utilized to their fullest.  Typically voiced by Charlie Schlatter or Michael Rosenbaum, The Flash is voiced by Grey's Anatomy star Justin Chambers in this film.  Although it doesn't necessarily seem like a natural fit, Chambers pulls off the charismatic charm of Barry Allen with sheer brilliance and never misses a beat - so much so that it's a bit of a disappointment to have already learned that he won't be reprising his role as The Flash in the next Justice League animated film.

Originally, the comic book version of Flashpoint was overshadowed by the fact that DC was rebooting their entire universe.  Many people still overlook the fact that Flashpoint stands on its own pretty well on the list of good - bordering on great - alternate reality stories.  The story takes a dark tone, and does so in such a clever, innocent manner.  This is by far the darkest DC animated film yet, which is clearly evident in the actions of some of DC's most beloved heroes.  The Flashpoint Paradox a window into the lives of their superheroes, depicting them as near bipolar opposites from the characters we all know and love.  The film serves as a vision of what can happen when something so innocent is changed.  If there's one theme to be taken away from this film, it should be the importance of selfishness vs. selflessness.  You'll understand when get to the epic climax scene.

Even though this is The Flash's film to shine, he is a bit overshadowed in certain scenes by the newer, edgier alternate version of Batman.  If you don't have any knowledge about this story, there's no need to spoil the identity of Batman for you, other than to say it's not Bruce Wayne.  This new version of Batman is reminiscent of Jason Todd's brief stint as Batman - carrying guns, not afraid to take a life, and without any shred of home for humanity.  This isn't the Batman that we all know and love, but it's an amazing and interesting change of pace that almost deserves a few more future stories of his own.  Kevin McKidd does an impressive job, continuing the trend of making Batman sound cryptic and no doubt terrifying to those pesky criminals.  While we're on the subject of Batman, it's implied that he has been battling a different version of The Joker.  And, to be honest, it's a pretty interesting notion.  Sadly, this element of Batman's alternate history is only explored for a brief moment.

Overall, there's no doubt this is one of the best DC animated films to date.  It's pure comic book/superhero action at its finest, with a solid storyline, enjoyable anime-style animation, and some pretty notable voice work.  However, it should be noted this film is not for children.  Even though it's a cartoon, there's still some pretty brutal imagery taking place over the course of the film - so much so that this film definitely earns its PG-13 rating.  On the flip side and as far as adult comic book fans are concerned, this film is one of the better animated films, which fits in nicely with the popular Batman: Mask of the Phantasm or Batman: Under the Red Hood films.  It's clear that DC has another hit on their hands with this animated flick, which will lead in nicely to the launch of the NEW 52 animated films, beginning with Justice League: War - hitting DVD/Blu-ray in 2014.

There is also a big part for Cyborg, who seems to be getting a push since he was added to the Justice League in the New 52 comics continuity. Read the rest here: [...]",1375056000,,261,4.24
5720496,5,B00CENSU1W,I just finished watching this on amazon instant video. It is definitely not your typical cartoon network justice league. It is very dark and has numerous mature themes that will reverberate with you long after the movie is over. The basic premise is the age old question - what if you could back and change the past? The answer being that if you could change it the outcome might not be what you expected. It even deals with the idea of predestination and accepting things that we cannot change. I don't want to spoil too much of the movie in a review so I will suffice to say that it's very deep and extremely entertaining. It's also very violent and absolutely not for children. This would actually be a good storyline for a major motion picture if it was done correctly. I have already watched it more than once. It's that good. Even the bonus material was interesting and educational. Now if only we could get more Geoff Johns stories in animated form like this I would be happy.,1375056000,,983,4.4972067039106145

5720498,5,B00CENSU1W,One of the greater feature length movie+cartoon DC adaptations to date. Animation was top notch with quality art. Action was also great but a tad bit more violent than what I'm used to seeing in JLA. Voice acting was also surprisingly great with almost all of the familiar voices except maybe Flash. Cannot say enough good things about this. I hope this is only the beginning of more great feature length titles to come from DC animation studios.,1374969600,,446,4.730769230769231
5720499,3,B00CENSU1W,"[The first thing to say is that this is not a movie for children. The content includes a great deal of violence, including a home invasion that ends in murder, a hanging, and the off-screen killing of a child. This is in addition to many bloody battle scenes where people are shot and injured.]

Overall, I would say that this is one of the more engaging animated movies that DC has released over the past couple of years, in that the concept of the original comic lends itself better to a short animated feature, much more than nuanced works like ""The Dark Knight Returns"" or shallow ones as ""Superman/Batman: Apocalypse"". Because a good portion of the movie is set in an alternative universe, unambiguously heroic characters now take unpredicable actions and form previously unlikely allegiances. The voice acting, as usual, is good, and Sam Daly did a better than expected job of filling in for his father as Superman, and will presumably be used as the voice of the ""New 52"" Superman, but I hope that DC will continue to use Tim Daly when making movies with (Classic) Superman.

As with many of these DC animated adaptations, you get a sense from the filmmakers that they're never sure whether they should slavishly keep every detail from the comic because there is some fan that expects it, or if they should really rework it as a story for maximum emotional impact in the 80 minute running time. A mistake given the limited screen time was that not enough time was spent focusing on Flash's new relationship with his mother, who he changed time and doomed the world to be with. A giant worldwide war sounds grandiose but a viewer can connect much more viscerally with a character who has a more intimate tragedy like accepting that he has to let his mother die.
There were many ancillary elements in the story that never went anywhere and were only included because they were in the comic. Elements such as:
* Superman. It's been made clear in many stories that Superman is the inspiration for the other heroes and the glue that holds the DC Universe together. In this movie, a good portion of time is spent finding what happened to Kal-El; the assumption being that he can stop the war. He is found and runs away, only to reappear at the end of the movie with no impact on the events in the story. The subplot served no purpose, it would have been better just to have had his spacecraft destroyed on impact, further implying that the alternative timeline is a broken world that cannot be fixed.
*Joker. While the idea that there must always be a tragedy that creates Batman is intriguing, shoehorning the Joker into this doesn't works, because he is such a singular entity, and the mantle cannot be taken up by just anyone, let alone Martha Wayne. The setup of Martha Wayne as Joker was absurd, did not go anywhere and could have been dropped from the movie altogether.

Unfortunately with some of these DC animated movies, because there's such a rush to get them out, not as much attention is given to giving the character designs a proper feel and look, and by default the animators tend to draw in a more anime style. This was apparent in ""Superman vs the Elite"", and is the case in ""The Flashpoint Paradox"".

Presumably, the ""Paradox"" that the title references is that in trying to save one person, Flash ravages the entire world.
But as with all time travel movies, there are many paradoxes and questions that are never satisfactorily resolved when you stop and think about the movie:
* If the existence of the Reverse-Flash prevents the Flash from going back in time and restoring the original timeline, how did Barry go back in the first place (since the Reverse-Flash clearly existed)?
* If Barry changed time and never became the Flash, then there is a paradox - who is the one who will go back in time and save his mother from being killed? Also, if there is a new timeline where the Flash didn't exist, then how did Reverse Flash come to be in that timeline's future?
* If the Flash changed the timeline and no one remembers the previous timeline (because it was changed around them), how can the Reverse-Flash remember the other timeline (he doesn't seem disoriented at all by the changes)?
*(while not a paradox) - How did the Flashes escape from the (inescapable) adhesive?

Aftereffects:
Presumably after this movie, the DC animated universe will reflect the reality of the ""New 52"" DC comics reboot, with altered origins and costumes for many of the characters. Oddly enough, at the end of the movie Flash doesn't seem to notice or mention that his and Batman's costume has changed, even though the main plot of the movie is based on Flash being aware of differences between the realities that no one else perceives. Also, it will probably be the case that the characters will have no memory of the ""Flashpoint"" universe, and it's a missed opportunity to introduce a bit more depth into the decisions of the characters. How can: Aquaman lead when he knows inside himself is the capacity to destroy millions of people / Wonder Woman fight when she sees how far her warrior mentality can take her / Superman support the government that intended to keep him as a prisoner for all his life?

Like I said at the beginning, overall it's one of the more engaging DC animated films... but I can't shake the feeling that all of this happened so they could get rid of Superman's trunks.",1374969600,7,5399,4.642259414225942

Extremely violent animated film not for children.  I absolutely loved it.

If you had to choose, I would skip this one is favor of Justice League: Doom or the phenomenal Batman: Under the Red Hood.

Anyway, this is a great movie.

EDIT:  After reading a few of the other reviews, I do have to agree that I didn't like the faces of a lot of the characters.  Aquaman, for example, had a face like a bodybuilder suffering from too much Human Growth Hormone.  Some of the men had lips that looked like silicone had been injected, and the women had faces that were ""pinched"" at the bottom, I didn't find the woman attractive...but, as a story... it was great.

However, the dark tone and violence is not out of place; it is well done to convey the gravity of The Flash's decision to change history.  In addition, family values are at the core of the events in The Flashpoint Paradox, so this movie is definitely not just action-packed.  In brief, The Flashpoint Paradox is absolutely worth watching.",1374796800,2,489,5.0
5720513,4,B00CENSU1W,"If you are looking for a violent JLA movie in an alternate timeline, this is one of the better DCAU movies out there. The Flash is a very under-utlized character and to see him get a lot of well deserved screen time made me happy, especially when DC usually just makes him crack jokes and fall down a ridiculous number of times for someone who is supposed to be all about pure speed and seeing the world move in slow motion. Now he is in rare form and the movie is all the better because of it.

The characters are wonderfully voiced (as usual) and after the credits there is a slight stinger, so you may wanna watch for it. This is hands down, without a doubt, the most violent movie in the DCAU library. The battles are well done though and you get a good sense of how big the scale of battle is with these overpowered characters. The only problem I have with it is that there was a set-up for a lot of sub-plots that go nowhere. What happened to the Joker? Who was the person that Flash tried to stop in the situation that set everything off (although the comics addressed this)? Why exactly does Professor Zoom hate the Flash so much? What was going on with Superman?

Really, if this movie would have been about an hour longer it would have filled in those plot holes, but then again it would probably have been to costly to make and it might have run the risk of dragging on too much. I didn't really spoil anything anywhere in the review, but I do need to stress that it is a very, very violent movie for the DCAU universe, to the point it skirts that PG-13 rating pretty hard at times. Exposed beating heart, child murder, slow strangulation, arrows through the head, and bullets through the brain to the point you can see the pulsing, bloody organ and the shooter on the other side, and blood all over the place. Yeah, it is violent, so if you don't want you kids watching it, keep that in mind, but for comic book fans out there who were wanting to see something in the DC universe that finally stepped away from the outdated and long removed Comic Code, this will be right up your alley.",1374710400,16,2098,4.295454545454546
5720514,3,B00CENSU1W,"I highly recommend this movie for any Justice League fan as it is definitely a lot of fun and has some very clever twists. However, that being said, do not expect a masterpiece because that is something it is most certainly not. A lot of the characters are not properly integrated into the story and there are too many plot holes to even count. The amount of violence is also absurd, and much of it just feels like it's there because they wanted to draw that. Of course I saw this at Comic Con and stayed for the panel after and they openly admitted that after Young Justice they just wanted to let loose and do something edgy, and it very much shows in the pacing and the overall execution. Oh, and I feel I must say that I like Barry Allen but I want more Wally West. Not that he would have had any place in this movie, however- Barry Allen was definitely the correct Flash choice in this case. I'm just a Wally fangirl.

Anyway, long story short it's a very FUN movie and I would definitely say check it out if you love Justice League, but do not expect it to be another Under the Red Hood. Flashpoint Paradox is no work of art and really adds no substance to the DC universe but it is definitely a fun ride.",1374710400,5,1211,4.197424892703863

5720517,5,B00CENSU1W,"Overall, DC Animated has done an excellent job of bringing numerous DC characters and stories to DVD/Blu-Ray over the past several years.  It's great to see these characters become more accessible to a wider audience.  Unfortunately, too many focus on the Big Two (Superman and Batman), but ignore the rest.  Yet the DC Universe is a deep one with numerous great characters and stories.

Here we find a great story set in an alternate timeline - something that DC does quite well.  And it centers on the character that launched the Silver Age of Comics, Barry Allen's The Flash.

This is a violent DC adaptation, but not gratuitous.  The film is well paced and plotted.  It may be necessary to know a few things about standard DC fare, like who Superman and Batman are and a bit about their backstories, though I'd guess that just about everyone knows those.

If you're a DC fan, you'll be giddy to see alternate versions of favorites - Black Manta, Cyborg, Batman, etc.

Yet at the heart of this is a story and a great one at that.  The beginning and end are tied together so well.  We also get to see the main character, Barry Allen as The Flash, grow from beginning to end.  There's action and consequences of those actions throughout.  You'll be left with something to think about and a desire to watch it again.

This animated film also touches on the possibilities for a Justice League live action film, but also for a film of The Flash - and one is rumored to follow the next Superman flick (featuring Batman! Yay!).  When you see Flash run up a tall building, jump, glide across a helicopter blade, bounce off a building, and run on top of the water - well, you can see the cinematic possibilities of seeing his powers on display.  The Flash is so much more than just a speedster.  He may be the most powerful of all the DC stable of heroes.  I'm glad to see him at the center of a great DC Animated film finally.  Here's hoping for a great live action adaptation.

This one is worth your time and money.  It's near the top of the heap of the DC Animated Universe, maybe just a notch below The Dark Knight Returns.  I recommend it, though I'd be wary with kids that are too young.  Watch it first before you let them see it.

And look into the other DC Animated movies if you haven't had the chance to enjoy them.  There's a great world out there to watch and it's never too late to discover all that DC's characters have to offer.",1374537600,20,2439,4.400447427293065
5720518,5,B00CENSU1W,"I really enjoyed this, but don't expect the answers we are all asking in regards to Pandora and the Trinity of Sin. Lots of great action and little in the way of explanation. For those who read Flashpoint it leaves us somewhat confused, as it seldom pulls from the original story. The action is good, but leaves little room for character development. As a fan of DC and it's reboot I'm pleased with the results of the movie, but still feel that DC had moved into a very positive path to attract new readers. Those of us who have followed DC since the original Crisis are not completely satisfied as to the new direction, but we also understand that changes like this can't be done in over a few issues. Watch the move. Enjoy and don't try to read between the lines. All in all a good movie, but with gaps.",1374537600,8,805,4.337748344370861
5720519,2,B00CENSU1W,"Let me start with the good first because there are so many things im glad this movie did. For starters, im thrilled this movie is for the most part all about the Flash. Im not his biggest fan, but I do enjoy seeing other characters living in the lime light. As for the story, its one of my favorites and this version doesn't disappoint. The tone of the movie was quick and exciting, it also carried a heavy adult theme thru out the movie which is hard to find when you involve the big three. The action is great, super gritty and puts an actual fear for the characters in this film. Again they did a really decent job on this script and I was super glad to see DC take such a big risk with a film like this.

AS for the bad, it weighed heavily on me and brought my enjoyment down quite a bit. My first big issue (and really only issue) was the art work. DC has done so many animated films and shows to this point that I can only except the best from them. Anything less than that and its a huge let down. Cyborg looks terrible the entire movie, Aquaman looks terrible. The flash has inconsistent moments where he looks super unbalanced. Then any of the lower tier characters definitely show that the attention to them and the background was done by the C art team. Another huge issue was the stupid CGI they put in, I cant stand when they mix that shit in. Also this movie looks like a bad anime, I don't care for that art style. But if im going to watch an anime style movie I want the real deal holy field, not some cheap knockoff.. And as much I praised the script earlier it could have used some tweaking. Length is always an issue for me, they cut these films down so much now its hard to get involved in all the madness that they can show. I know they couldn't put everyone of the panels from everyone of the comics, that's not what im asking. But I would have liked to see this movie stay closer to the 2 hr mark vs 1hr.

Voice acting was decent to me in some areas and meh in others. I would have liked a few characters to have different actors behind them, not a big deal tho. For the majority the cast does a great job.

But besides a few other things that bothered me I would say the movie has potential to be 5star movie to other people, and I could have easily given it a 4star rating had they actually done this movie right with proper artwork. This, however is all just my own opinion and I encourage any person reading this to go support this movie and buy it when it hits stores later this month. I gave it 2 stars but I still plan on adding it to my collection in hopes of DC taking a more serious look at their adult audience.",1374537600,10,2645,4.102316602316602
5720520,4,B00CENSU1W,"Fist off, I like to review things as vague as possible so not to give away the plot for anybody looking to see the movie for the first time...

DC loves their alternate timeline stories. The basic premise is one that is done over and over. That said, this had some of the more original variations of the DC universe. It's great to see Flash as the central character that was a great surprise. The alternate origin for Batman downright threw me for a loop.

Granted I am not familiar with the graphic novel that this movie is based on, nor am I a self proclaimed expert of DC lore.

This is a very dark movie and some might find it questionable to watch with very young children. Might want to preview this first if you're going to watch with little ones or you risk narrating peoples actions and why they are not as most people would expect them to be. It's a pretty dark movie with a fairly high on screen body count.

Great movie !!",1374537600,2,934,4.259887005649717
5720521,1,B00CENSU1W,"Wildly inconsistent is the best way I can describe DC Animation. Without the oversight or the fresh ideas from Paul Dini and his team they have fallen into a rut of adapting old graphic novels and changing the style and animation in each.

'The Flashpoint Paradox' is mostly ugly stylistically (see the laughable Aquaman and Cyborg designs) and only features glimpses of pleasing style. The animation is terrible and the fight choreography is a step back from something like JL:Doom.

The story is your classic convoluted alternate timeline everything goes mishmash mess. Hundreds of Superheroes? Check. Aliens? Check. Mythological Beasts? Check. Ghouls? Check. Demons? Check. Future People? Check. Magic? Check. Bruce Wayne's mom becomes The Joker? Check.

There's no grounding. No restraint. Everything goes constantly and the entire thing just ends up being some weird fan-fiction caliber story. The worst is how they ruined Barry Allen. He's now this hyper-emotional mess.  To top it off the alternate timeline Barry is gay because his mom was around to raise him. Mom dies? Straight. Mom lives? Gay. MAKE SENSE?!?!?!

That doesn't mean there aren't flashes of stuff I like. Thomas Wayne was a great character and it was interesting to see how the military handled getting to Kal-El first instead of the Kents.

The whole thing is a mess just like their last effort of Soap Opera Superman.

5720523,5,B00CENSU1W,"Some spoilers involved:

This movie is incredibly violent.  I just want to get that part out of the way, so you understand what you're getting yourself into.  If you're an avid comic reader or have been in the past, then the violence in this film will be no shock to you.  As a comicbook reader myself, I've longed for that level of violence and grittiness to be translated on screen and it sort of has in a few instances (Batman: Red Hood, Batman Beyond: the Return of the Joker, Superman vs. The Elite, and Wonder Woman), but nothing at all like what I witnessed in this film.  And it is glorious!

In a nutshell, after a flashback of Barry Allen finding his mother's murdered body, the Flash defeats a host of his rogues gallery, who are working together to defeat him.  It turns out that Zoom, the reverse Flash, has put together this team of villains in an elaborate attempt to kill the flash and millions of people, including the villains themselves.  His plan is of course thwarted by the Justice League and the villains are taken to prison, but not before Zoom gives Flash an ominous warning about his family.  Now this is where some confusion happens, but more on that later.

Flash awakens to find that the world and history has changed, most specifically, his mother is now alive, thus rendering him powerless as the accident responsible for creating the Flash never happened or something like that.  You see, it's never made clear why the Flash has no powers or why his mother being alive would stop the accident that causes the birth of the Flash.  I don't read Flash comics, so maybe that information is obvious to Flash fans.  In any case, Batman now uses guns, Cyborg works for the government, Hal Jordan never became Green Lantern, Martha Wayne is apparently the Joker (shown in a flashback), Kal-El is a prisoner of the government, and Aquaman is feuding with Wonder Woman with the world caught in the middle.

Now here's where things get tricky.  There's a scene where Batman breaks several of Barry Allen's fingers, when he finds him in the Bat Cave.  However, this injury is never mentioned again after he convinces Batman to release his hand.  There isn't even any distress his voice, which is the same problem that happens later, when Zoom is literally beating the crap out of the Flash after brutally stabbing him with a metal rod.  There's also an ambiguity about who killed Barry Allen's mother, which is why I brought up the incident earlier where Zoom seems to threaten the Flash's family.

In the comics, Zoom is the one who went back in time and killed Barry's mother.  However, in this film, it's not shown why the world has changed other than a line of dialogue from Zoom about Flash changing history by saving his mother.  We later see current Flash stop the past Flash from stopping the murder, but the murderer's face is never shown.  It's obscured by the window pane.  It may or may not be Zoom who's doing the killing, but it's never made clear.  In fact, it might be Barry's father walking into the room, just before Zoom shows up to kill Barry's mother.

Now to the controversy, there's a particularly brutal scene in this movie that may or may not shock you into disgust.  I don't how many of these critics have actually been paying attention to comicbooks over the years, but violence on children is not a new thing.  Robin, a child, has been killed, brainwashed, tortured, resurrected and turned into a murderer between movies and comics and no one bats an eye.  Needless to say, a child is brutally murdered on screen (it's not Robin).

Overall, the movie was fantastic and I highly recommend it.  That final scene of the Flash running through the city is iconic and I hope Warner Bros. decides to end their Flash movie with the same scene.  Also, stick around for the after credit's teaser.  I haven't read Flashpoint, so I'm not sure what it means.  I suspect that it has something to do with the Vertigo and Wildstorm universes merging with DC as a result of this incident.",1374451200,4,4019,4.6075949367088604
5720524,4,B00CENSU1W,"Best Justice League cartoon yet. Followed the story line most of the way and put together very well. The Flash came out awesome and amazing and the art was great. DC has always been the leader when it came to animated movies, even though I am a die hard Marvel fan, this one still proves they are still number one at that.

Pros: Followed the comic series well. Loved the violent batman, and it was hilarious what happened to Hal Jordan.

Cons: It seemed as if the voices were all from the same person, with little change in the pitch of the voice (hence the 4 stars)

Also, don't expect to see much of Superman in this cartoon. If you have read the series you will know what I mean by this.

The Flash is one of my favorite heroes so it is nice to see a little more background for Barry Allen. A great unexpected storyline gets your attention, there are also a lot of cool cameos by some of the most popular and underrated DC Characters. This feature covers the Flashpoint comic mini-series and does it justice whether or not you read the issues. It is incredibly mature and violent so I wouldn't recommend this for smaller kids, as it earns the PG-13 rating.

Um to most of the people reading this they already know Flashpoint was a multi issue comic book series that sort of lead to the new 52. Not directly but if Flashpoint had never occurred, neither would the reboot, sort of the last great story of the 1986-2011 DC comic book era that has yet to be named (modern era?... Post silver era?). So although if u forget the nutmeg the muffin might look tasty but its in fact horrible!  The two points I'm trying to make here is one Don't review a movie or a book before it comes out unless you were somehow involved in development of the story or if you somehow already do know the story aka anyone who reads DC comics instead of being lazy and waiting for these dumb movies, that they have to steer somewhat at kids for money purposes. Point number two people complain that DC does this to make money. Do you really think this is DC/Marvel's biggest money makers? These semi movie length cartoon features; obviously common sense man needs to come slap some of his power into you?

5720549,3,B00CENSU1W,"Please note, this is written before the actual product is released.

Some of the previous adaptations of DC Comics have failed to capture the epic quality of the series they were based on, but I'm hoping that this adaptation actually takes some liberties with the original Flashpoint event (quite honestly, the only thing worth reading now from that event was the 3-issue Batman spinoff miniseries by Brian Azzarello and Eduardo Risso - which would have been a fine ""Elseworlds"" Batman story, if adapted all by itself). If they can streamline the story and focus mainly on just Flash and Batman (with the Atlantean-Amazon war used as background) and throw in a dozen small cameo appearances by other (altered) DC heroes, I think it could work out. The problem with the original event is it just went off on too many tangents irrelevant to the main plotline featuring Flash and Batman, so maybe by paring the story down to its core essentials, the DC animation staff can actually improve on the original comic books. Here's hoping. I will later adjust my star rating up or down to reflect the final product's merits or lack thereof.

EDIT 08/02/13 (THE ACTUAL REVIEW) - Well, I have now seen it, and have to say I was not much impressed. The darkness and violence wasn't an issue, since I was expecting that. Unfortunately the director, Jay Oliva, did NOT streamline the comic book plot to make it more comprehensible and focused. There was no need to show characters such as Deathstroke, Grifter, Canterbury Cricket, Etrigan, and a half-dozen others as they added absolutely nothing to the story. The story should have focused on Flash and Batman/Thomas Wayne, with the Atlantean/Amazon War as the backdrop. Aquaman, Wonder Woman, and to a lesser extent Cyborg, Superman, and Captain Atom were all necessary characters that moved the plot forward, and of course Reverse-Flash was crucial. But they could have dispensed with the others. It accurately reflects the comic series in that it is too rambling and unfocused for the viewer to much care about what is happening beyond some visceral scenes of massive destruction and the deaths of some formerly-familiar characters.

More than anything though, this is an ugly looking production. The animation itself varies from excellent in some scenes to just barely passable in others. But what really killed it for me was the character designs themselves. I'm not talking about the parallel-earth versions of familiar characters, but how the animators chose to draw them - the style, for lack of a better term. Overly tall characters with small heads (or heads with tiny craniums) and bull necks. In short, to varying degrees, the heroes all look ugly, and the women homely (or at best, unattractive, when I'm sure the intention IS for them to be attractive). It's a far cry from the classic days of Bruce Timm/Lynne Naylor character design at WB for the DC characters.

The real shame here is that Flash deserved a better starring vehicle for his turn in the animated spotlight. Given that it seems Geoff Johns is now the go-to source for original animated movie adaptations (Superman Unbound, Flashpoint Paradox, and the upcoming Justice League: WAR are all based on his stories), the Flash would have been far better served by adapting another Johns miniseries,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Flash-Rebirth/dp/1401230016/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Flash: Rebirth</a>.

It seems that WB is now committed to moving forward into the ""New 52 Universe"" phase of DC Comics, and with that, I'm probably done with the animated adaptations. Bet all those excessive seams and lines that Jim Lee felt needed to be added to all the redesigned DC heroes' costumes prove difficult to animate.",1369440000,10,3778,5.14657980456026
5720550,2,B00CENSU1W,"To make it clear, I have not seen the movie yet.  I read the books as they came out and they didn't reveal that Barry was the cause until the very end.  So I have my doubts as to how well this will work.

I was not impressed with the outcome in the comics.  The idea that straight-arrow Barry Allen (more of a boyscout than even Clark Kent) would mess with the time line and THEN be surprised that things could turn out badly is more than a bit absurd.  I can't see the character, as established over decades, would do this.  After all, he has major experience with time travel, more so than nearly anyone else in the DC universe.

Even with the motivation of saving his mother, I can't imagine that he would do such a thing.  And why now?  He'd had the ability to do this for years.  I don't recall anything in the pre-52 timeline that would justify the sudden change of heart.

While many of the Flashpoint stories were well done, in my opinion, all of it was tainted when they revealed how the events were triggered.  A great deal of the post-Flashpoint stories aren't logical.  The Batman and Green Lantern lines are virtually unchanged, while other series went through wholesale revisions?  Much of the books seemed to be shifted toward younger audiences, who are used to video games.

DC, as a business, has a right to move towards a new model that sells more books and adds other revenue streams.  But I dropped most Marvel and independent books because they became  mainly about action, glamor and shock value, with less about people.  That trend seems to have overtaken the DC books.

Even the Batman books have succumbed to this.  The Court of Owls arc, while containing some very good stories, made no sense at the core.  Batman didn't have any idea that the organization existed?  The ultimate paranoid information freak thought it was only a myth?  Despite numerous times seeing myths as germinating from a seed of truth?

I rarely review movies and never before one I haven't seen.  But I know too much about the source material to think that this will go well.  Maybe my rating is too harsh (not 1 star on the off chance they make silk from a sow's ear).  Time will tell.  And I will watch it eventually, although I won't rush to buy it.
