8700768,5,B002738XKW,"This is a kind of ethnic joke comic strip, but for my children, this is a useful textbook of history and culture around the world. I wish there would be more African or south American countries, for it sure would make familier to the world affairs to anyone like my children, even an difficult issue like economic crisis in Greece and other latin countries. I love this series.",1273449600,5,377,4.5588235294117645
