8241829,4,B0011HOEWG,"In a devastated world overrun by monstrous bugs and outlaws, Honoka is the protector of the innocent.

While crossing the desert, she finds a man wandering alone. This man has a secret, and a mission that will change her life forever. Her skills are about to be tested like never before.

This anime is a lot better than I expected. I has good animation, voice acting, a unique story, and a pretty good soundtrack. There is a lot of action, drama, mystery, adventure, and some pretty interesting characters & plot twists. There isn't another anime out there that I can really compare this to. It's pretty original, despite that, I still found it lacking a little something that would make it a 5 star show. It's hard to put my finger on what it is, but The Third is comes just shy of being incredible. Even so, it's still really good, and definitely worth watching. I recommend it to any anime fan.",1353974400,,1082,4.383084577114428
8241830,3,B0011HOEWG,This series started out pretty good. Or at least it had an interesting storyline. Then it simply fell apart. Why do they make a series without having the story written and approved BEFORE it's being shown?,1235952000,,205,4.722222222222222
8241831,4,B0011HOEWG,"With only four episodes left and significant progress already being made within this story, it's hard to see how they are going to sustain it for the final four episodes. While it was nice to see this volume end on a strong note and give the audience something to really look forward to at the close of the series, I can't say that I'm feeling any strong emotional attachment to this series which leaves me with a blah feeling towards its finale. It's been a fun ride so far but once it's over, I don't foresee being particularly upset about it and this volume didn't do anything to change that opinion.

  Good enough to get a passive recommendation.",1214092800,,651,4.5
