1538879,5,B00005JOA4,"Of all those great prime-time soaps from the 1980s, the one that I watched religiously was ""Falcon Crest,"" a gripping tale of love and ambition, greed and power amidst the vineyards of California's (fictional) Tuscany Valley.  Featuring a phenomenal cast including Jane Wyman, Robert Foxworth, David Selby and Susan Sullivan, not to mention smart, complex scripts and possibly TV's greatest theme music (by Bill Conti), ""Falcon Crest"" is a must and I hope it gets a DVD release soon!!!",1115251200,70,485,5.139240506329114
1538880,5,B00005JOA4,"Okay, Dallas and Dynasty have now been released on DVD, now it is time to release the BEST of The Prime Time Soaps on DVD, FALCON CREST! Falcon Crest really set themselves apart from the rest of the pack! The Characters were Rich in Style and Complexities and the scenery was Breathtaking! Casting Jane Wyman as Angela Channing was a major coup. Falcon Crest has such a Gothic Feel to it, I don't even think the Words Soap Opera does it justice. More Like a Machivallian Play! Please Release this on DVD!",1115164800,59,504,4.489130434782608
1538881,5,B00005JOA4,"Warner Brothers has announced that they will release Falcon Crest in North America in 2010!!!! Finally....this classic 80's soap will be uncorked and fans all over may relive the show! Falcon Crest seperated itself from Dallas, Knots Landing, The Colbys and Dynasty with character-driven stories, lush surroundings, humor and the unbeatable lead of veteran actress, Jane Wyman. For so many years the combination of Dallas and Falcon Crest on Friday evenings was too alluring for viewers to ignore. People used to stay home on Fridays and watch the shows.....back when television was really good!!! I hope this release will be successful and only be the beginning of future releases of complete seasons of the show. Friday night magic is coming back.......just get those Dallas collections dusted off....and unwrap your new release of Falcon Crest!!

1539061,4,B00005JOA4,"In real life, I live in ""Tuscany Valley,"" or in reality, the hills above it.  But it's really called Napa Valley, just in case you didn't know.  Why did the writers and producers of ""Falcon Crest"" (FC) change the name to ""Tuscany Valley""?  And why did they change the name of ""Queen of the Valley Hospital"" to ""Tuscany Hospital,"" or something along those lines?  And why did they change the name of nearly everything else for the show?  Well, more than likely, they didn't want to pay some royalty fees.  Either that, or they couldn't get the rights to use the real name.  Or perhaps those in the area in which I live simply read some scripts first, and decided to ""pass"" on giving their names freely.  Just a guess.

My wife and I are wine members at the winery in which this show was first filmed, a winery to remain unnamed, although if you do a few web searches, you should quickly find it.  That's how we first found out about this show, 30 some-odd years after the fact.  I did find out recently, though, after reading a page or two on the TV show's web site that the winery only let them film there for the first season; it had something to do with the crew scratching the beautiful wood floors which led to some kind of a fallout between the owner of the winery and the producers of this show.  But we watched Season Two first, but only because, at that time, Season One wasn't available for streaming.  But then we purchased Season One, watched every episode, and now it appears that it's no longer available for streaming again!  This is nearly as confusing as ""Falcon Crest"" the series, and all of it's characters, relatives, and relationships!

While I only gave Season Two a 3-star rating, I decided to go 4 with Season One.  Why?  Was Season One really any better than Season Two?  Well, probably not, but now that I've learned the characters a bit, I've warmed up to it a bit.  I still laugh at the ridiculous characters and the more-ridiculous dialog, but hey, I laughed while watching ""Melrose Place"" (MP) (the original, not the reboot) too, and I liked that show.  It was very funny.  Only real issue:  MP didn't take itself seriously, while I believe that this show perhaps did.

Well, going back and catching this season after watching the second, I started to understand some of the relationships, nonetheless.  I pretty much know who is who now, who is sleeping with whom, etc. etc., and that helps, since even most of these characters don't seem to know who anybody is either.  But now, I'm actually looking forward to buying Season Three, as I need to see what happens next.  Or rather, what happened after I watched Season Two, which was a while ago.  Maybe I'll have to go back and watch a couple of episodes from that season again, as a refresher?

Why not pour yourself a glass of Cab, buy a season or two of ""Falcon Crest,"" and drink and laugh yourself silly?  It's all in good fun.  Not that it should be taken too seriously, though.  After all, after you hear some of the dialog, you'll realize that the writers maybe didn't take it all that seriously either.",1433116800,,3090,4.483870967741935

1539172,5,B00005JOA4,"I remember Falcon Crest from when I was a kid but never really watched it (Dynasty was the night time soap to watch).  My partner suggested ordering this and after watching the first season I have to admit Falcon Crest is a great show.  It is less glamorous and more realistic than Dynasty but more fun than Dallas.  First seasons are fun to watch because its like a show is trying to find its proper tone.  The second season is when Falcon Crest really hits its stride.  If you are looking for a fun show to watch, Falcon Crest is worth checking out.  Only the first three seasons are available so here's hoping the rest will be released soon.",1413504000,,644,4.369747899159663

1539385,5,B00005JOA4,"More understated and sedate than ""Dallas"", yet miles more interesting and classy than the trashy, overindulgent ""Dynasty"", this inaugural season of ""Falcon Crest"" has it all: addictive storylines and solid performances that make for an enjoyable viewing experience. Favorite characters are the sane, sensible Maggie (Susan Sullivan), blonde good-guy Cole (Billy Moses), flighty Emma (Margaret Ladd) and swarthy bad-boy Lance (Lorenzo Lamas).

With ""Waltons"" creator Earl Hamner at the reigns, the series maintains a dignified ambiance that elevates it from its contemporaries. Later seasons would become more sudsy, but this one plays more like straight drama with soap opera elements thrown in. The picture quality could be better, but that just adds to the vintage flavor, like the fine wine that flows at Falcon Crest itself. A lot of the episodes have the original yellow closing Lorimar logo which really takes me back to the early '80s.

FIVE STARS.",1379462400,2,955,5.402684563758389
1539386,5,B00005JOA4,"Was interesting watching Falcon Crest again,great cast and writing, though only the first 3 seasons are currently being offered, would be nice if FC was remastered in HD.  So much better than the reality crap offered on TV today.",1372550400,,229,4.871794871794871
1539387,4,B00005JOA4,"Having seen Falcon Crest many years ago anxious to look at it again to gauge if my response was still the same. Styles of Tv series have changed dramatically over the years, but this type of series is wonderful and time pass viewing.

Series got better as it proceeded, especially with the entrance of David Selby in Series 2. The first season virtually is setting everything up and introducing all the characters and their foibles.

Quality of disks is reasonable.",1371081600,,465,4.8

1539489,5,B00005JOA4,This show has it all from Hollywood royalty in Ms. Jane Wyman to an impeccable cast surrounding her.  This show along with Dallas were a part of my evening routines back in the 80's.  Time has only made shows like this more appreciated and more valued.  As the saying goes they just don't make em like this anymore.  And that is a sad thing.  I'd recommend to anyone to purchase this and all of the additional seasons available.  Sit back and enjoy Angela with a nice glass of Pinot.  I mean this show completely revived the American Wine Industry.,1321488000,,548,4.474747474747475
1539490,3,B00005JOA4,"Oscar winner Jane Wyman was the sole reason for the success of the first season of the nighttime soap opera.  Her Angela Channing was the cunning and ruthless owner of a prominent vineyard in California's lush Napa Valley.  She is at odds with her recently-relocated nephew Chase (Robert Foxworth) and his family (Susan Sullivan, William R. Moses, and Jamie Rose) who is trying to make a go of the vineyard inherited from his late father, brother of Angela.  Mysteries surround the death of the brother and Angela's off-center daughter, wonderfully played by Margaret Ladd, holds the key.

The cast is rounded out by Lorenzo Lamas as Angela's oversexed grandson Lance and Abby Lane as Lance's likes-to-sample-the-product-too-well mother.

Season one, like many shows in the first season, tries to get its grip but it could have used some better continuity from installment to installment, which is lacking here as each episode somewhat stands alone.  However, the show would fare better in the next season with the addition of Angela's son, played by David Selby, and a better flow from episode to episode.

However, every show starts somewhere and this is a fair beginning for a show that would go on for eight more seasons.",1320883200,,1225,5.004926108374384

Falcon Crest had a stellar cast, from Jane WYman, as Angela, Abby Dalton, as Julia Cumson, and Robert Foxworth, as Chase Gioberti. This was was different than Dallas, and Dynasty, and quite different than Knotts Landing. Taking place in wine country of Tuscany Valley, CA, season 1 centers around the death of Jason Gioberti- Angela's brother, and Chase's father. Chase is determined to find out the truth.. Did Angela have something to do with it? And what does Angela's daughter Emma (Margaret Ladd) know about it? A excellent season!",1284681600,,599,4.9405940594059405
1539616,5,B00005JOA4,"Wow, I was beginning to think I'd never see the day.  But finally, Falcon Crest, my favorite prime-time soap of all time, is making it to DVD.

The cast of this show is tremendous - Jane Wyman is one of the most talented classic film stars to make the transition to prime time television, and she holds the audience of Falcon Crest spellbound as in season one, we only begin to realize the lengths to which Angela Channing will go to control the vineyards of Falcon Crest.  This tough-as-nails character has some of the greatest lines ever uttered on a prime-time soap, and these (plus Wyman's brilliant portrayal) serve to set her up perfectly as 'The Queen of Mean'.

In season one Chase (Robert Foxworth), and to a lesser extent, Maggie (Susan Sullivan) are the chief 'good guy' thorns in Angela's side, but in season 2 the action really revs up with the arrival of Richard Channing (David Selby), who at least in his earlier seasons is in no way a 'good guy'... a fact which makes him a perfect adversary for Angela.  Angela's partner in crime during the early part of the show is her spoiled nephew Lance (Lorenzo Lamas), but Lance has some problems of his own, in the form of his ongoing love/hate relationship with Melissa (Ana Alicia).

This is not Falcon Crest's best season - in my opinion season 2 through 6 or 7 are Falcon Crest's best.  But season 1 is a great intro to the characters, and well worth watching.

I hope the rest of the seasons will be quickly on the way.  My old VHS tapes recorded from TV in the 1980's are well past their expiry date!",1283126400,5,1565,4.463157894736842

1539620,5,B00005JOA4,"Except for the last two seasons, I loved this series when it originally ran on TV ... and I loved it again when it ran on SoapNet some time back.  The last two seasons are a train wreck in agonizingly slow motion, since the lead actors began dropping out and lesser actors with much weaker story lines came to the forefront.  While the last season was almost impossible to watch (except for the final scene), this first season was the set-up for the series, introducing the major characters and their backgrounds and the plot lines that would flow through most of the years.  Coming from the San Francisco Bay Area near where the exterior shots were filmed makes watching this series especially enjoyable for me, because they do capture the essence of the area and the drama and competition in winemaking industry.  There is also a love of the land and love of family expressed, although the love of family sometimes get twisted -- but that also happens in real life.

I bought Dallas on sale to see what all the fuss was about and now I know, I also bought Knots Landing because I found out it was a spin-off of Dallas, and it also has been good not as good as Dallas but close. The same thing goes in my opinion with Falcon Crest. I find that with JR's wickedly sly smile every time he plots someone's demise you get these chills of love hate for the guy.
In Falcon Crest I find that Angela doesn't seem to really enjoy all the plots and schemes she seems to plan for others. That said it's still very entertaining, the locale is incredible (Dallas' outside shots are sometimes just sets and it shows) but with Falcon Crest from what I've seen so far its outside shots are actually outside which is a plus for ambiance.
I do have a hard time believing that Victoria and Cole are 17 and 19 they look at least 24, so when they gripe about not wanting to be there I keep thinking ""Move out, you're old enough"". Lorenzo Lamas is a bit stiff but maybe that's just his take on how the character of Lance must live his clustered life. But the worst character is the crazy aunt that lives upstairs, God I just fast forward every time she comes on screen, she is just so annoying. Now Maggie even though she is almost too perfect is very likable, and almost seems the most real character of the lot. Lance's mom is also likable.

  -It has comedy, romance, and all the drama that a soap should have. Jane Wyman as Angela Channing plays her part well; she is so calm in all her bad doings and sometimes funny even when she's not trying to be. And that grandson of hers, Lance (played by Lorenzo Lamas) following in her footsteps...they play their parts well.

1539677,5,B00005JOA4,"I remember on Fri night after Dallas watching FC. Not long after the premiere I ended up liking it even better than Dallas. I am soooo glad to see it finally released on DVD. It seems to have aged much better than Knots Landing KL) or Dynasty on it's dvd release even though I am pleased to have all three. The score by Bill Conti is awesome. It is my favorite score and even though it changed a tad over the years, I think Season One is one of the best. I have to say when FC premiered I was not too familiar with Jane Wyman. It did not take me too long to really like her. In all the night time soaps, she is my second favorite female character. The first being Donna Mills (Abby from KL). What a rarity to have a mature woman bein a lead role that was just not someone's grandmother. She's at her best here. She is surrounded by an excellent cast; Robert Foxworth (Damien-Omen II, Airport '77), Susan Sullivan (It's a Living and daytime's Another World), Abby Dalton, Lorenzo Lamas and Margaret Ladd.

My absolute fav episode is included here. The one that features Hollywood legend Lana Turner. And she is fabulous and is soooo stunning. I remember so well when this episode first aired. The two scenes with her and Jane Wyman are classics. Ms. Turner would return in Season Two for a few more appearances and started the ball rolling on having former Hollywood stars doing guest appearance on the night time soaps. FC's included Kim Novack, Gina Lollabridgia, Ceasar Romaro, Mel Ferrer and Celeste Holm to name a few in the coming seasons.

I certainly hope that the following seasons are released not to far far apart. Unfortunately that is what has happened with KL or even worst Dynasty with seasons being released in two parts.

1539679,3,B00005JOA4,"UPDATE ABOUT FALCON CREST SEASON 2:

This DVD set for the second season of Falcon Crest isn't being distributed in the U.S. like the first set was, but is instead available RIGHT NOW at Warner Bros. wbshop dot com. Whoever's selling these out there online for ridiculously marked up prices is getting them there and reselling them. Presumably any future season collections will be sold the same way. Go to the site and order yours directly.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

Falcon Crest was pitched to CBS (and bought by them) as something more like The Waltons than like Dallas/Dynasty.  It was only after production started that CBS asked the creators of the show to move it in a Dallas-like direction to retain the audience that Dallas' lead-in on Friday nights gave them.

In addition, the first season of Falcon Crest coincided with a Hollywood writer's strike, and the producers found themselves rushing to cobble together formulaic/episodic scripts whose basic story could have appeared on any series, so the first half of episodes on the DVD are a mixed bag, and it's not until about the 11th or 12th episode that one can see the beginnings of the Falcon Crest we all came to know.

So while this first season DVD is okay (the Gioberti's [with the exception of Susan Sullivan] are dreadfully dull and have boring dialog), it's going to get better.  It's also going to get a lot prettier, as in coming seasons the Spring Mountain Winery/Miravalle mansion in St. Helena, California where Falcon Crest was filmed will be better landscaped (cypress trees flanking the winery doors, 3-Tiered Waxleaf privets flanking the entrance to the mansion and Boston ferns hung along the porch, better cars, better characters [Philip Erikson, Richard Channing, and especially Ana-Alicia as Melissa Agretti],and so on).

So by all means buy this DVD, but don't judge Falcon Crest as a whole on its contents.  It improves considerably.

Sadly there are some very overexposed outdoor scenes on this DVD that did not appear that way when first broadcast, and the setting, even more than the story, was responsible for a considerable amount of this series' appeal.  I hope they improve this in coming season releases.  It's a great shame that what was gorgeous and perfect gets a substandard treatment here at times.",1275091200,3,2289,4.947780678851175
1539775,5,B00005JOA4,"Such great acting....Nothing like today's junk on TV!  Jane Wyman, Robert Foxworth, Susan Sullivan, just all very well trained, actors!

1539777,4,B00005JOA4,"Having watched the entire set I can now attest that what others have claimed about the quality of these DVD's is pretty accurate.  For the most part, the series looks good, but does not compare to the quality of DALLAS or DYNASTY which, clearly, have been taken from better source material.  Overall, it stands fine...until the last two episodes, in which the quality deteriorates rapidly to the point where the last scene of the last episode (and probably the most exciting of the entire season) is gasping for air.  I started wondering if my eyesight was going!  For whatever reason, the powers that be did not bother (or couldn't) get better source material.  Hence my four and not five star review.  That said, I am thrilled they released the series, finally, and hope they will follow with the rest of it as they did with DALLAS, since it is the same studio releasing it.

The series itself is a bit silly to review, because most of us have seen it and know what it is all about.  We each have our own personal, subjective opinion of why we may love it or hate it.  Seeing it all of these years later, however, I feel that it seems to struggle for the first half.  For a bit I kept wondering how come I loved it so much years ago and now found it a bit lame.  Only toward the last five or so episodes does it start taking up speed and really gets one hooked (again).  Then I realized why I did get hooked the first time around.  It is clearly up to scratch by the end and certainly promises the next season to be quite strong. A toast, and onward to season 2.  Like a vintage wine, it has aged long enough!",1274227200,,1611,4.291390728476821
1539778,5,B00005JOA4,"This was such a great show... well-casted except for the ugly redheaded daughter.  They should have made the daughter look like Lucy Ewing.  The show was missing a hot a$$ until Ana Alicia showed up.  Also, I loved Jane Wyman in her part but it was kind of awkhard to have two men racing for her affections.  If they were going to have a man hot for Angela Channing, the actress who played Chase's mother would have been better in the role.  Notwithstanding that, Jane was perfect as Angela.

I'm glad the mystery finally was ""revealed"" about Chase's father because if I had to listen to yet another ""I'll tell what I know about Jason's death"", I would have screamed!  LOL!  Still not sure how Angela didn't face a charge of some kind.

Emma Channing belongs locked in a sealed room with only Chai-Li to go in there.  Talk about a basket case.  And am I the only person who thinks Jason molested Emma...?  I know, huh?

And I'm sorry but there is no way Lance and the Agretti girl wouldn't have been attracted to one another.  Maybe Ana Alicia should have been the daughter of Chase and Maggie and the ugly redhead been the Agretti girl.  It would have made more sense to see why Lance was NOT attracted to her.  Lorenzo and Ana were a gorgeous couple.

On a racial note, I hated every time Lance called Vickie's Latino boyfriend ""picker"".  That sounded so racist.  And isn't Lorenzo Lamas a Latino too?  What was so different about him opposed to the other Mexicans on the show?  LOL!",1274140800,3,1485,4.446096654275093

1539863,2,B00005JOA4,"At last we were going to see the first season of Falcon Crest in its original, uncut glory.  However, our hopes are now faded with the poor quality of the prints used for this DVD set.  Apparently WHV didn't want the expense of digging out the original masters from their vaults, and instead used some older prints that are very dark and have color stability issues.  Witness the final episode in the set, ""Ultimate Answers"", with the flashback scene in the final act.  You can't even make out Angela and Emma sitting in the car waiting for Uncle Jason's truck to be sent over the cliff.  The source material for one episode, ""Heir Apparent"", must have been in very bad shape or missing, as the 1986 version mastered for syndication (with the Lorimar tag at the beginning) was used, which of course is shorter in length: 45:18.  All the other episodes are pushing a length of 49 minutes, which indicates they are uncut (except for the missing trailers for the next episode).  It's hard to watch any of these episodes.

1539867,5,B00005JOA4,"Long before the days when every yuppie with a line of credit could open a ""wine bar"" in their downtown area, there was FALCON CREST--the most glamorous vineyard of all. Brilliantly cast, this classic melodrama features some of the finest performances of its genre with one of the classiest ensembles ever to grace television. Jane Wyman plays matriarch Angela Channing, and shows up her ex-husband by ruling the airwaves at the same time he was ruling the country. The great Robert Foxworth begins his long run as Chase Gioberti, Angela's disenfranchised nephew and the head of his own (soon to be doomed) clan. Susan Sullivan, one of tv's most prolific actresses (Dharma and Greg, Castle) plays his long-suffering wife Maggie. Like 80s hunks? Falcon Crest's got 'em. First we have the swoon-inducing Lorenzo Lamas as Lance Cumson, Angela's devious grandson and Billy Moses (now better known as William R. Moses) as teen heartthrob Cole Gioberti. Rounding out the first season cast was Abby Dalton as Julia Cumson, probably the sexiest chemist ever to be shown on television, Jamie Rose as pouty but sweet daughter Vickie Gioberti, Margaret Ladd as batty, bipolar Emma Channing, and the late-season arrival of Ana Alicia as Melissa--the love of Lance's life. The plot? It's a very simple set-up--Chase inherits 50 acres of prime vineyard from his late father--and Angela WANTS it. That's all you need to know. And she'll do anything she can to get it. As the Giobertis move to Falcon Crest and attempt to revive their father's lands, Angela and Lance stab them in the back at every turn. And the battle begins. And the scrambling for power, wealth and above all--grapes--continues on through the show's remaining eight seasons. Falcon Crest got off to a better start than its contemporaries--Dynasty and Dallas. Everything was in place from the first episode. It's just the icing on the cake in the upcoming season two that David Selby joins the cast and from then on--it's like a Who's Who of Hollywood making their marks at Falcon Crest. The best is yet to come. As for the dvd itself--it's a standard dvd case with 4 discs with a slip cover--very handsomely produced. Sound and picture quality are good for the series' age; there seems to have been no attempt to remaster this series, but it's still held up fairly well (at least as good as the Dallas dvds). I have yet to notice any missing scenes or music substitution. I would give this dvd set five stars--a class act all the way--just like the series itself.  It's a shame Warners took so long to start this series on dvd, but now that it's here...it's well worth your time to add it to your collection!",1272067200,3,2661,4.822757111597374

1539871,5,B00005JOA4,"I don't know if Jane Wyman was chosen to play the lead of hard-as-nails Angela Channing because she was then newly-elected President Reagan's first wife or not. The rumor back then was that the producers wanted her in the role as a kind of side-swipe at Reagan, whose right-wing politics they detested. Then came the rumors that first lady Nancy Reagan wouldn't let the president watch the show because Jane Wyman was in it. Back when we all had a common culture at the dawn of cable, this was all really very amusing. However, regardless of why and how she got the part, Jane Wyman owned that role and made it something special. Starting out playing the lead at age 64, she didn't miss a step until the last season or so, when bad health finally got the best of her.

The setting is the fictitious Tuscany Valley of California and its lush vineyards. Chase Gioberti, played by Robert Foxworth, was Angela's nephew who was always going round and round with her. This was the principle conflict - Chase's principled stand versus Angela's dog-eat-dog approach to all problems. This first season has a kind of Romeo and Juliet theme to it as Chase's son and wealthy heiress Melissa Agretti fall in love and Melissa finds out she is pregnant. Fate being what it is on soap operas, Melissa ends up in an arranged marriage to Angela's lazy grandson-heir, Lance, with everyone outside the principle trio - Melissa, Angela, and Lance - believing Lance to be the father. Angela arranged this marriage to give her eventual ownership of the Agretti vineyards. This show was one of the popular night-time soap operas of the 80's along with Dallas, Dynasty, and Knot's Landing. Most of the characters weren't as rich as in Dallas - after all, we're talking grapes here not gasoline -  but the stories didn't have the goofiness that Dynasty always had and Dallas eventually descended into.

Highly recommended for people who remember this old show and loved it like I did, and also for people who like soap operas in general.",1262390400,6,2011,4.7236467236467234
1539872,5,B00005JOA4,"Before NBC had ""must-see TV"" during the middle of the 1980's, CBS had two powerhouse primetime soap operas airing back to back on Friday nights starting in 1981 with ""Falcon Crest"" following the #1 rated show in the nation, ""Dallas"". Produced by the same studio as ""Dallas"", ""Falcon Crest"" became a serial with its own identity: with beautiful California scenery, intelligent plotting, and the excellent acting chops of Oscar winner Jane Wyman in the main role as Angela Channing, a ruthless owner of a winery in Tuscany Valley, California. Angela was loaded to the hilt and she was not about to let anyone become more powerful or rich than she. Yes her family meant the world to her, but equally important was her land that she inherited that was worth millions. Angela's family consisted of two daughters and a sexy grandson, Lance (played by Lorenzo Lamas), who had the most beautiful body of any male actor on a primetime soap in the 1980's. The producers agreed as every couple of episodes Lance would be seen lounging by the pool only in a pair of bikini briefs. Robert Foxworth played Angela's nephew Chase who moved to Tuscany from New York after his dad (Angela's brother) had died, and he brought along his wife Maggie (played by former ""Another World"" star Susan Sullivan"") and their son and daughter. The basis of the series' storylines during the bulk of its run dealt with the rivalry between Angela and Chase over ""Falcon Crest"" as Chase owned a sizeable portion of the vineyards after his father passed away. While ""Falcon Crest"", like ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty"", epitomized the glamour and richness of the Reagan presidential era, the series became an immediate hit for CBS finishing its first season at #13 and producing 18 episodes. This set contains all the shows from that first year, but sadly the original pilot called ""The Vintage Years"" that sold the series is not included.

1540088,5,B00005JOA4,"FALCON CREST FANS....PLEASE READ 3RD PARAGRAPH OF THIS REVIEW....VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION, IF YOU WANT YOUR SHOW TO BE RELEASED ON DVD!!!

A couple of nights ago the Home Theater Forum presented Warner Brothers Home Video (T.V. and Animation divisions only) for a chat. During the forum, Warner Brothers FINALLY said they are giving KNOTS LANDING another chance by releasing SEASON 2 sometime in 2009. Therefore, in order for this series to have continued success, We, the fans and any other curious viewers, new viewers, etc... need to show support to buy this series. ESPECIALLY THE FIRST WEEK OF IT'S RELEASE!!! THE FIRST WEEK SALES WILL DETERMINE CONTINUED DVD SEASON SETS OF KNOTS LANDING.....

Very much like a new movie, when it's released in theaters, the first week opening sales determines if a movie should/could have a sequel. (think in terms of the recent ""Dark Knight"" movie with Heath Ledger) which was a box office hit the first week (and beyond) when it was in theaters this summer. The movie is also coming out with a sequel within the next 2-3 years because of this success.

Therefore if you apply those terms to the first week sales of the DVD release of Knots Landing's 2nd season, it will have continued success, like it's sister show DALLAS. Please, I know the economy has not been the greatest (and it seems to be getting worse) and soon most of us will only be able to watch t.v. at home anyway (instead of going to the movies), please save your money and support this wonderful show. PLEASE BUY THIS THE 2ND SEASON THE FIRST WEEK OF IT'S RELEASE!!! If all is successful, Warner Brothers will continue to produce the remaining seasons of this show as well as another show....FALCON CREST.....that's right, all you FALCON CREST fans out there, according to Warner Brothers chat the other night, sales of KNOTS LANDING will also help determine releasing not only more KNOTS LANDING, but FALCON CREST as well. So FALCON CREST fans.....listen up....check out Knots Landing Season 1 (now) & Season 2 (in 2009)!!! Your show will be next up to bat if you do this.

I hope this helps the fans of both shows understand how important buying your favorite show the first week its release helps determine whether or not the studios will continue releasing a series (and other series). JUST A REMINDER: click on the Amazon's wish list reminder link to let you know when KNOTS LANDING SEASON 2 is released (it's definitely coming in 2009!!). Then when Warner makes the annoucement for the release, Amazon will let you know via email and then you can preorder your copy!! Thanks for reading!!!",1221609600,5,2606,4.810267857142857

1540181,5,B00005JOA4,"Falcon Crest was always and will always be the great dame of Prime Time Soap Opera in my opinion. Hailing from the golden era of television when the prime time soap was king, Falcon Crest stood above the pact for inspired casting and characterization. Though Joan Collins was terrific in her role on Dynasty, i challenge anyone to watch Jane Wyman in action and claim Joan the victor. Ana Alicia, Susan Sullivan, Lorenzo Lamas, Abby Dalton, David Selby, William R Moses, Gregory Harrison, Wendy Phillips, Robert Foxworth, Morgan Fairchild and Kim Novac count among the many many classy performers in this true visual gem. And of course the late but very great Jane Wyman. I suggest that this is the perfect time to release Falcon Crest on DVD, In honour of the sad loss just this week of Ms Wyman.
Alas i fear the studios will continue to neglect this product (and others such as Flamingo Road, Paper Dolls, Emerald Point, The Yellow Rose, The Colbys and subsequent seasons of Knots Landing) all in favour of mega profits and salary bonuses.
I implore the studios to consider the future of these products while the fans are still young enough to see them and hear them and even afford them. Don't wait until your available audience has died out.
At least we appear to be getting the complete series run of Dallas, and Dynasty seems to be back on the agenda. Here's hoping that maybe once these shows have been completely released the studios will re-consider the fates of some of these other classics.",1189555200,3,1501,4.7110266159695815

FALCON CREST was the perfect halfway house between the rivals DALLAS and DYNASTY - more glamorous than the former yet not as camp as the latter.

  Then on a future Friday evening when current TV viewing is dull, I can relive those bygone days of the past by selecting a year and playing each show in sequence from around the same time they aired that season. (I can just visualize and hear in my mind now those delightful yee-haws and see a leaping orange General Lee as the guitar twangs and Waylon intones the 8pm Hazzard theme followed at 9 by the three way split screen with cattle and skyscrapers as the Dallas name blasts onto the screen...and finally, that trumpeting regal music as the Falcon Crest emblem thrusts onto my TV over images of vineyards and the Gioberti mansion, always concluding with those effervesent glasses of wine clinking to begin a new show's festive evilness.)

 Recreating a fond trio of memories...Now talk about a heavenly scenario!!!

Leading a stellar cast of talented actors is the undisputed Queen of cunning, scheming, and conniving, the incomparable Jane Wyman (Johnny Belinda, Pollyanna).  The head of a vast California wine vineyard estate, Wyman controls her family with the same iron fist that she uses to control her business.  The cast includes Robert Foxworth, Susan Sullivan, Lorenzo Lamas, and David Selby.  From the beginning of this flamboyant tale of wealth and extravagance, you'll get swept up in the lives of Wyman's TV daughters, the quite and elegant Abbey and the kooky, but sweet tempered Emma.  Robert Foxworth and Susan Sullivan play the new neighbors who become the thorn in Wyman's side from the beginning.  ""Falcon Crest"" was a worthy frontrunner with TV's ""Dallas,"" ""Knots Landing,"" and ""Dynasty,"" giving it's fans a weekly dose of some of the best plot lines and including new and interesting cast members.  Some of that cast included handsome and debonair talents, Simon MacCorkindale and Parker Stevenson, beautiful and mesmerizing Ana Alicia and Morgan Fairchild, and a list of Hollywood film legends that no other prime time soap has come close to beating. Lana Turner, Rod Taylor, Celeste Holm, Cliff Robertson, Gina Lollobrigida, and that's just to name a few.

1540380,5,B00005JOA4,It's about time this one comes out on DVD. It is by far the best of the 80's night time soaps. It has a gothic overtone to it and has a wonderful cast and great storylines.,1122249600,9,172,3.8055555555555554
1540381,5,B00005JOA4,"Okay people, let's get with the program.  The first three seasons of Dallas have been released, as has the first season of Dynasty.  The time is LONG overdue to release the gem of a nighttime soap that showed those two how it was done: Falcon Crest.  A stellar cast, an impressive roster of guest stars, complex, intricately woven storylines, breathtaking scenery, and the best musical score in the history of primetime made FC a joy to behold on Friday nights back in the '80s.  The fact that the show ran for NINE seasons should be more than enough evidence that there is a strong enough fan base to support a DVD release--and the sooner, the better!",1121472000,10,652,4.594827586206897
1540382,5,B00005JOA4,"I think Falcon Crest was one of the best night time tv-series in the 1980's. Angela Channing, Melissa and Richard were amazing characters on the show. I hope it comes out soon on DVD like Dynasty and Dallas.",1119398400,11,207,4.473684210526316

7941041,5,B00005JOA4,"Academy Award winner Jane Wyman, first wife to Ronald Reagan before Nancy & the Presidency, is top dollar great in this Sonoma County California Wine Country ""Dallas/Dynasty""-esque series!  I wonder if Jane won an Emmy for her performance!  So many stupendous regulars and guest stars all the way up to Lana Turner!  Once you watch you will be hooked ....and then there is Lorenzo Lamas worth the watch :)",1478908800,,405,4.840579710144928

7941043,5,B00005JOA4,"I was always a fan of shows like Knots Landing and Dynasty and out of those 80's soaps like Dallas this was the ONE that I have waited to watch. I wanted to have just one of those ""Lorimar"" shows to dive into and I finally decided to start watching Falcon Crest. It was well worth the wait that's for sure the acting and story lines are just amazing. Each performance from the cast in each episode is supurb. I'm so grateful I get to watch this show for the first time; and many more times in the future. I would highly recommend this series.",1470787200,,542,4.171428571428572
