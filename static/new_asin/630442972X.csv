868497,5,630442972X,One of the best westerns of all time. This has an all star cast and some very good acting.  It is recommended for anyone who loves excitement in a good western.,950140800,,160,4.161290322580645
868498,5,630442972X,"I'm a truly Western fan. I have seen all of the  sequels to the Magnificent Seven. And, I've got  to tell you this is about the best all-star Western movies I've seen. When I saw THE SEVEN SAMURAI, I hadn't  encounterd a remake of the  classic Japanese film about Seven Samurai who  save a village from bandits. The American version done it just. Look like,  they would continue the series since it was called ""THE MAGNIFICENT  SEVEN"" Instead of making The Magnificent Seven, Return Of The Seven,  Guns Of The Magnificent Seven and The Magnificent Seven Ride! why didn't  they finish the  sequels by adding three more sequels to finish the series.  Yul Brynner if he didn't want to play Chris, I'm sure there were several  other actors that would love to play Chris. Return Of The Seven was awsome  too! But I didn't like it that Chris recruited Manuel, a chicken thief to  fill out number six. If I was Chris I would have recruited  that bully who  was fighting Manuel, at least he  knew a little something about a gun. I  hated it that he got killed in it. For Guns of the Magnificent Seven, the  cast were great but the  characters were new. I don't think that Max was  a  real recruit. Again, I wouldn't have picked him. I would try to go and find  someone else if I could. Finally, The Magnificent Seven Ride! was a good  action-Western to watch as well. The five  convicts and a dude writer ride  south of the border to help a town filled with women. Again the characters  are new, now Chris is acting Marshal and is married. He quits and wants  revenge for a  thief who turned killer and rapist againist Chris's wife.  The new characters are: Pepe, Walt, Noah, Hayes, Skinner, Elliot they are  pretty good. Again I wish they had finished the series with three more  sequels to live up the title's name.",942105600,,1809,4.45398773006135
868499,5,630442972X,"This is about as good as westerns can be done.  My fiance and I absolutely adore this film.  Seven Samauri is interesting, but in a different way.  The Magnificent Seven grabs you from the first scene with Yul Brynner and  Steve McQueen riding up the hill on that hearse.  The middle part has some  slow sequences for diehard action fans, but the climactic scene is  terrific.  This film is about redeeming the human spirit- sometimes good  does triumph over evil.  Elmer Bernstein's musical score elevates this film into a classic.",940032000,2,532,4.811111111111111
868500,5,630442972X,"This opinion reveals no details about the movie's plot
Before Akira Kurosawa, great westerns (high noon) often had a slow build up leading to action (shoot out) at the end. What Kurosawa did was start off with action, drums pounding, overwhelming odds... adventure.
John Sturges was having a few drinks with Steve McQueen. He said lets do Kurosawa's ""The Seven Samurai."" Steve said he was not going to run around in a dress. They agreed that Steve could wear the hat he had on in the bar, they did it as a ""Widescreen,"" Western. They called it ""The Magnificent Seven.""
There was a lot of tension on the set between the main stars. Steve was good on a horse and good with a gun.
Yul Brynner if you'll notice in ""Invitation to a Gunfighter,"" and ""WestWorld."" etc. Was not at home on a horse. His hats came from the prop room. Yule is a gentlemen gunslinger, hardly the type that goes out on the dusty road to track a man down.
The soundtrack music from ""The Seven,"" forever changed what we expected from a western score. It's one of the top three with ""Once upon a time in the west,"" and Bob Dylan's ""Pat Garret and Billy the kid.""
Samurai: In the former feudal system of Japan, the class , of military retainers of the daimios, constituting the gentry or lesser nobility. They possessed power of life and death over the commoners, and wore two swords as their distinguishing mark.
Gunslinger: In the former open range system of the West, the hired guns ... possessed power of life and death over the towns people, and wore two guns (usually a tied down pistol and a rifle) as their distinguishing mark.
The genius was exploiting the similarities between how Japan changed, and the end of our West. Samurai's special rights and privileges were abolished with the fall of feudalism in 1871. The western gunslinger's about the time of Tom Horn at the turn of the century.
Look at what we now know as western music and the original Asian music from ""Samurai.""
The ""Seven,"" is not a authentic western as is ""Red River,"" or ""Tom Horn."" But as A1 entertainment, which is what it was meant to be, it's a work of Art. When you've seen the rest, come and see the Best! Always in my top ten!
If you really want a dose, try a double bill with ""The Widescreen, 'The Magnificent Seven (1960)DVD"" and Akira Kurosawa's, ""The Seven Samurai DVD(1954)""",935366400,,2332,4.541567695961995
868501,5,630442972X,"This is a great movie with a lot of action and a super soundtrack to boot. The characters are all well done, dimential, and fully fleshed out. Some of those old guys were really cute then. The comming together of the group  into a cohesivness is well written and acted. One of the greatest movies  made to date. The best western movie now and forever. Simi- pregual to a  wonderful television series currently looking for a home filled with great  action and sexy guys.

868701,5,630442972X,Just wanted to watch the original. like it better than the new version,1522627200,,70,4.461538461538462
868702,4,630442972X,"Way back in the early 60s, when I first watched this classic Western, of good v. evil, with a nuance or two, I tucked away the subject line as a succinct reflection on the aging process, when the reality of the aging process was such a distant abstraction. Over the intervening years, I have repeatedly used that line, sometimes in reference to other things than the three flies that were on bar.  Now that the aging process is something so solid that I can trip over it on the way to the bathroom at night, I realize that I had misremembered who had uttered that line. For more than half a century, I though it was James Colburn. On the re-watch, it proved to be Robert Vaughn Lee.

This movie is based on Akira Kurosawas&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven-Samurai-English-Subtitled/dp/B004D1AIZ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven Samurai (English Subtitled)</a>, as the credits indicate. Of course, in the early 60s I had never heard of him; over the intervening half century I have watched several of his movies, most recently a re-watch of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dersu-Uzala/dp/B002O67FHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dersu Uzala</a>, but not yet the Seven Samurai.

The movie contained a truly star-studded cast, to use an apt but very worn expression: Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Colburn, Eli Wallach, and Robert Vaughn Lee, Horst Buchholz. All would have extensive careers in the movies for decades after their appearance in this one. When the movie was first issued, in 1960, American Indians were still usually negatively portrayed in the movies, attacking wagon trains full of innocent white settlers. So, the opening scene was an interesting counterpoint to prevailing stereotypes, when Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen decide to escort the body of a dead Indian to the graveyard, risking their lives, to ensure a decent and proper burial, despite the bigotry of various townsfolk, who wanted to exclude the Indian from the towns cemetery.

Go to the border, guns are plentiful there. Another interesting line, that unfortunately resonates more than half a century later. That is what the Mexican villagers are told, who want to defend their village from the banditos who periodically raid their village. Three villagers go, and through serendipity, recruit the Seven, for 20 bucks each, for six weeks, each with their differing motives, some vaguely altruistic, others not. There are enough twists and turns in the plot, as well as modulated shoot em up action, to maintain the dramatic tension. Wallach, who heads up the banditos, provides another classic line: If god had not wanted them sheered, he would not have made them sheep.

When the dust finally settles, and the dead are buried, the assessment that Only the farmers win is made, which does not seem to be even remotely true. A most optimistic sentiment, as the newest bunch of sheep-shearers gather. My own aspirations, after all these years, are now more muted, and I will remain happy to simply catch The One. 4-stars for a trip down memory road.",1522195200,,3137,5.354969574036511

868704,5,630442972X,"This is a great classic story with wonderful Panavision cinematography, tremendous music, great writing and acting, etc.  The transfer looks excellent in DVD quality.  Looking at the quality of the 2.35:1 format with good focus and lack of optical distortion, it is evident why Panavision lenses had by this time won over the market share from the earlier CinemaScope lenses.  This is an audience-pleaser of a movie, both for story content and for impressive filmmaking.",1521331200,,470,5.24

This film has many iconic actors playing memorable gunslingers that you will love to watch, and yet a realistic message about the nature of a gunslinger's life and motivations. It's true, this movie was made before cgi so you won't see blood spurting out of people's chests when shot; indeed, you might not even see a hole. However, if you just want realistic gun violence and don't care about the plot, then go watch the remake. This is a vastly superior film and I doubt anyone who's reading this review would need to be told the remake isn't worth 2.",1505692800,2,665,4.741379310344827
869160,3,630442972X,"I saw this movie the first time.  As a late night movie on a local t.v. station.  I don't know when it was.  But it was before Steve McQueen died.  He was my favorite actor and I have seen all of his movies.  It came out in 1960 when he was thirty years old.  Yul Brynner was cast to star and got top billing.  Eli Wallach was the head bad guy and got 2nd billing.  McQueen was third.  I read somewhere where he said this was is first decent movie.  The rest of the cast is filled with soon to be super stars like Charles Bronson and James Coburn.
The plot is a mexican village hires some gunfighters to help them defend their village from Wallace and his gang who are taking everything they want from the village.  There is plenty of action.  It's pretty tame by today's standards. But it holds up well.  There are good lines.  My favorite scene is probably when they are talking about  all the things gunfighters have.

Yes, it is the same tale but with an American cowboy adaption, where the heroes take on a large group of banditos in Mexico who are persecuting villagers.  I actually prefer this version of the film over the more recent Denzel Washington version which is still good.  Hard to top Steve McQueen, Yul Brenner and James Coburn as the primary good guys.

869314,2,630442972X,"Released in 1960 and directed by John Sturges, ""The Magnificent Seven"" is about a Mexican peasant village oppressed by a group of bandits, led by Calvera (Eli Wallach). The village leaders resort to hiring seven gunfighters from America to help defend their town. The seven gunmen are played by Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Horst Buchholz, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Robert Vaughn and Brad Dexter.

Despite the contrived plot, based on Kurosawas Seven Samurai (1954), you cant beat the lusty score, the superlative locations and  the excellent main cast (the villagers, by contrast, are mostly weak). Unfortunately, the movies ruined by hokey script flaws. For instance (***MILD SPOILERS ENSUE***), Chico (Buchholz) is able to effortlessly infiltrate Calvera's bandits, utterly fooling them, even though there were only 32 of them by this point (rolling my eyes). Even if Calvera & his brigands failed to make out Chicos face, which is a big IF, his dialogue & accent wouldve given him away. Keep in mind that he was just an unseasoned teen.

Another prime example is the village leaders' sudden cowardly turnaround (i.e. betrayal), which totally contradicts their earlier resolve. Yes, I realize they learned that the bandits weren't run off and that they were going to return to the village out of desperation, but there were only like 30-32 bandits left at this juncture and the combined forces of the seven gunmen and the fighting villagers now had the opportunity to annihilate the thugs for good (***END SPOILERS***). The sad thing is that both of these script hitches couldve easily been fixed, but this kind of lame writing reflects too many Westerns before the 60s when the modern Western came to the fore with One-Eyed Jacks (1961), Hombre (1967) and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969).

The film runs 128 minutes and was shot in Mexico and Old Tucson, Arizona.

869315,1,630442972X,"This movie shows so well what is wrong with you, the Americans - like being flat broke, never getting paid for defending others, meddling where you do more harm than good, driven by honor rather than logic, facts, and reason.  The American exceptionalism, the Messiah Complex, and being clueless how to end what is so easy to start is why this childish movie got so many 5-star reviews.  The movie is OK for kids and the adults who still believe that going to Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan was a right, brave, and honorable thing to do rather than moronic.  BTW, why didn't we see the seven guns-for-hire get paid up front?  Today, even dumb for-hire killers want at least half down.  The answer: because in those days, doing things for money would upset the kids and make the seven look less noble.  Bottom line:  I would have to be paid big bucks to see this abomination again for the reasons I just stated and ""acting"".",1497052800,,930,4.566265060240964

870538,5,630442972X,"Four and a half BLOODY Stars. Based on the general plot of the classic Japanese film ""Seven Samurai"", ""The Magnificent Seven"" of 1960 stars Yul Brynner as 'the man in black', Eli Wallach, and Steve McQueen and spawned 4 more films, including the 2016 remake with Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, and Ethan Hawke, and a few similar TV shows. Yul Brynner returned in a sequel, ""Return of the Magnificent Seven"".

In the beginning, outlaw Calvera (Wallach) and his gang ride into a Mexican village and take what they want from the people, slapping them around and worst, promising to return. The village elder sends some farmers on a mission to get guns but they develop a better idea, hire men with guns, and plot is set as seven gunmen are recruited. They bond with the villagers and teach them to fight leading to the confrontations. Also starting Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn, Brad Dexter, James Coburn, Jorge Martinez de Hoyas, Rico Alaniz, Jos Chvez, Vladimir Sokoloff, Rosenda Monteros, ""and introducing Horst Buchholz"". The distinctive theme music is by Elmer Bernstein. A long movie, the time is well spent on the recruitments by the man in black, character development, and battles. Produced and Directed by John Sturges. Highly Recommended. Four and a half INTENSE Stars. (MGM, The Mirisch Company. Not Rated but R level violence. HD. Color. CC. X-Ray.

Mexican villagers decide to hire gunslingers to protect their village from Eli Wallach who every couple of months robs them of their farm produce. In smaller roles, young actors Robert Vaughn (Man from UNCLE) and Charles Bronson, Horst Bucholz, European plays a Mexican who is sort of ashamed of his background. Also in the film is a young James Coburn. Apparently McQueen continuously tried to upstage Brynner. The new update of this film with Chris Pratt and Denzil Washington was very violent and apparently did not do well to recoup film costs.

871260,5,630442972X,"Chris Adams: ""Once you begin you've got to be ready for killing and more killing, and then still more killing, until the reason for it is gone."" Based on the Japanese film, ""The Seven Samurai"" this iconic Western holds a 93% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and has had more TV play than any other theatrical film excepting ""The Wizard of Oz"". It wasn't always viewed so favorably though...critics didn't like it when first released in 1960...but then what do they know?? The ""Seven"" has been one of my favorites since I first saw it in the theater in 1960...Westerns are my favorite genre and I have many favorites; but I'd have to put this one in the top ten. The cast is of course top drawer and while all were not so well known in 1960, most became superstars over the next ten years. And they all deliver superb performances, with the nods for best performances going to Brynner as the leader of the ""Seven"" and German actor Horst Bucholz as Chico, the young, hot blooded kid of the group. I've watched the film so many times I've lost count, enjoying it just as much each time...and the only thing I've found to be mildly annoying is the name ""Chris Adams"" for Brynner's character. I mean what kind of name is that for a gunfighter; plus one of the other Seven calls him a Cajun...so he should at least have a French surname. Other than that, this is a perfect Western - my opinion of course - and a good American version of ""The Seven Samurai""",1477785600,4,1449,4.430711610486892

Packed full of the 1960's heart throbs it portrays a simple message of standing up for the little guy. No special effects ,no computer graphics in this film. Just pure acting with nothing else to back and bolster this movie up in the ratings. Simple acting stands alone and this generation of actors either cut the mustard and you have a quality product,or the movie would fail on the lack of ability by those same actors. This is a fantastic quality product singing the abilities of Yul Brenner as classy and wonderful,Robert Vaughn,Charles Bronson, Eli Wallach, and many other well known actors of the day. Gun slingers for a living ,well suited on horseback ,ride in to save a small Mexican village .Just watch it before the big debut of the computer enhanced, special effects new release this month.

872919,4,630442972X,Mainly holds up after all these years. Score is a bit overwrought at times but main theme still a classic.,1472774400,,106,4.35
872920,5,630442972X,"It is doubtful that Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa would ever believe that his 1954, 3  hour epic The Seven Samuri would spawn countless American westerns for the big screen and TV.  By the same token, John Sturges homage would itself be the beginning of a plot device that would play out in an untold number of similarly themed movies.

The casting itself is unusual.  Yul Brynner (The King and I) is the titular figure in the movie.  He, born in Vladivostok, in what is now Russia and reared in Manchuria and Paris is a bald-headed gunslinger named Chris Adams.  Brynner was actually somewhat instrumental in acquiring the rights to the story and was originally set to direct.  The film introduces a young German actor named Horst Buchholz as an up-and-coming slinger of pistolas, called Chico.  He is portrayed of Mexican decent.  The rest of the primary cast include a new wave of young actors, most prominent being Steve McQueen as Vin Tanner.  McQueen had already made a name for himself in TVs Wanted: Dead or Alive (one of my favorites).  The rest of the seven include Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn and Brad Dexter.  Eli Wallach is excellent as the bandito, Calvera.

A small farming village south of the border (filmed primarily in the State of Morelos), has become the target of Calvera and his 35 banditos who raid the town of its liquor, food, cigars and money on a regular basis.  Fed up, some of the farmers head north to buy weapons so they can defend themselves.  They have occasion to run into Chris who offers to help them for food and lodging and $20 for 4-6 weeks work.  Chris puts out the word and attracts the 6 associates noted above.  Initially the townsfolk are afraid of the gringos but eventually become welcoming and willing students of modern warfare.

While I would have a hard time saying this is the best Western film ever, I will say it is one of the most influential and certainly a lot of fun to watch.  A documentary that accompanied the DVD suggests that McQueen and others all tried to out shine Brynner.  McQueen in particular is always doing something distracting when he is in scenes with Brynner.  Something like swatting a bug with his hat or fidgeting with his gun.  This is a totally satisfying and highly entertaining film.  Time to watch the fresh 2016 version.  Highly recommended.",1472688000,,2333,4.703703703703703

873113,5,630442972X,"I have not seen ""The Seven Samurai"", so I cannot compare that movie with this. But on its own, I find it quite the satisfactory Western.

The premise is quite realistic: a Mexican village is robbed of most of its food annually by bandits who don't eschew killing the occasional dissenting villager. Using their very limited wealth, several villagers go to the US to buy guns, to find out that it would be cheaper and easier to hire gunmen. So seven of them take the job and go to the village, and when the bandits return, desperate for food, the gunmen fend them off. But the presence of the gunmen eventually cause division among the villagers, who betray them to the bandits, who spare them with the idea that the gunmen might have friends to avenge them.

The performances are credible, and most of all are the lines and attitudes of the characters. For instance, when several village children tell one gunman that their parents are cowards, the gunman rebukes them, saying that the villagers are brave just to work hard to grow food, with no guarantee that they will get to be able to eat it. Also the part where the bandit leader orders the gunmen to leave, but tells them before they go, ""Take what you want!"" as an implied rebuke to the villagers.

If this movie is but a remake of ""The Seven Samurai"", this is one that was well done.",1469318400,,1341,4.487704918032787
873114,3,630442972X,"This movie is just fine, but the original, Seven Samurai, directed by Akira Kurosawa is superior in every way:  story, writing, acting, camerawork, music, and of course direction.

One of the best opening sequences with Steve McQueen and Yul Brenner at the graveyard in any movie. Eli Wallach as Calvera was outstanding.

874279,5,630442972X,"This is a movie that will never get old. It is excitement from the very beginning and does not disappoint at any time. The cast is ""All Star"" and of the highest quality. I grew up watching Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen, James Coburn and Eli Wallach and all the rest in the movie. These were true actors that made you believe you were watching a true event. They made the story come to life right before your very eyes. And they gave to us all something that all youngsters need and truly want - a hero! It is a story of a people being oppressed feeling that there is no way out for them until they are given an idea, a way to go. They venture out and happen across one individual who could be the answer to their prayers. And one by one a small band of pure courage is assembled that would be the equivalent of a small army. Hence, ""The Magnificent Seven""! Eli Wallach, an awesome actor by all accounts, was excellent as Calvera and believable. In fact, I don't think anyone else could have fit the role better. It is a movie as stated earlier, will not disappoint. One for the whole family to watch and root together. Even the little children in the movie were of a superb performance. Watch this movie if you haven't yet. Enjoy it again if you have. If you've seen it before you know that it is a must see movie.

874488,5,630442972X,"I have watched this special edition of ""THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN"" twice so far and many time previously since the 1960s.  This movie remains on my best films; Western or otherwise. The morality statements are as relevant today as they were when Akira Kurosawa penned the original inspiration: Seven Samurai in 1954. I have also heard it described as an apt metaphor for the Vietnam war. It being released at the beginning of news footage from that conflict. I served with the British Army during the conflicted 60s & seventies. I trained and shared memories with Us army and Air Force personnel during that time, and the often made similar references to their memories of Vietnam (for better & for worse). As a screen presentation; it appealed to my sense and thirst of\\for adventures back then. Today it fills me with longing for the screen idols I idolised, and attempted to emulate their ideals and courage in the face of overwhelming odds and mortal danger.
I watch it form the comfort of a very comfortable leather chair and far, far away from the smell and noise of gunfire of course: Yet, Yul Brinner and Steve McQueen, Robert Vaughn, James Coburn, Brad Dexter and Horst Bucholzs'  characters remain some of the  ideals I hold and emulate for myself.  The mercurial and creative direction of John Sturges leaves an iconic reference for many other westerns to follow; yet never 'to my experience' surpassed; as the Motion Picture Academy confirmed. The film score is also a landmark achievement as scored by Elmer Bernstein.
This wonderful edition should be a part of every film lover's collection. Mine is fast becoming a family heirloom as it's taking turns visiting and returning safely from friends to friend and family members, and of our special film/movie nights.",1441670400,,1774,4.923076923076923

Sorry, but the acting is almost laughable, and the dialogue quite lame. In its time, by the standards of the time, it was good--but today, not so much.. The on-location photography is still very impressive. The score, by Elmer Bernstein is still powerful--and it was very different, when the movie was first released, from most of what passed for musical scoring in movies of that era.

I suffer from depression & live in a rural area.  I ordered ""Best of Season One Parking Wars""

Greatly disappointed that there is no season 2 to order on DVD.
I don't really have access to the internet so streaming is out.

This is a superbly acted, superbly cast, groundbreaking movie in which the Mexican bandits and Mexican peasants were not made to look foolish or second class. With Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and James Coburn, you were seeing a cast of young guns, literally,  enroute to stardom. Eli Wallach was exceptional as Calverra, the leader of the 40 bandits. The musical score by Leonard Bernstein to this day arouses the emotions of the movie anytime I hear it. Even the sounds of gunfire were better for the time of the movie release. What a masterpiece!

Even Robert Vaughn as a weak and tormented Lee and Brad Dexter as Harry, who was consumed by greed, demonstrated great talent in their roles. The film would have been less compelling without them. The quiet strength, dignity, and confidence depicted by Yul Brynner as Chris really carried the film. Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, and James Cobern played characters of great courage and unusual skills. These core actors brought together for this project are each and every one masters of their craft.  For me, at least, this was a five star film.",1437436800,2,822,4.864285714285714

875150,2,630442972X,"I loved Seven Samurai. It was humorous, action packed, thought provoking and even erotic. The Magnificent Seven is none of these. I think one of the biggest mistakes in making this film was that they tried too hard to replicate Kurasawa's classic samurai film, and sadly it just didn't translate. Some of the cinematography is beautiful and much of the acting is superb, but the idea that they could simply swap out swords and kimonos for guns and hats resulted in a film with little charm, wit, depth or excitement.",1436918400,,516,4.7444444444444445

Boasting an all-star class that offers up Yul Bryner, Eli Wallach, James Coburn and Charles Bronson, John Sturgess film does justice to Kurosawas story of a group of ragtag samurais who band together to defend a terrorized town, switching out feudal Japan for Mexico and the samurais for rogue cowboys. Though nearly an hour shorter than Seven Samurai, The Magnificent Seven manages to hit all the proper beats and set pieces. To make things even cooler, its all soundtracked brilliantly by Elmer Bernstein, delivering some of the best work of his career.",1430956800,,757,5.064

Great story, even if it was stollen from the Japanese classic -- the dialogue makes up for any charge of larceny.  Shot beautifully in a classic style -- no excessive use of quick cuts to keep millenials interested.  Shots are often held long and move to give you a feel for the enviroment and action.  The theme music cues you to what is coming in a way that is lost today -- primes you for what is coming.  The dialogue is filled with great quotes -- listen to McQueen when he tells the story of a man falling from a tall building and about the man who jumped in a patch of cactus, or short quotes like Bronson's ""$20 dollars is a lot right now"" and Brynner's ""I was nominated real good"".  I saw this again on a curved high def screen and I was blown away.  I am a little biased as I am a fan of the westerns from this era (any era really) ""Clint Eastwood"" most noteably, but this is still a classic that should not be missed even if you are not a western fan.

Just about anyone who was anyone at the time made it into The Seven: Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn, Steve McQueen, Yul himself, Eli Wallach, James Coburn, and Brad Dexter make up the group of hired guns.  The group was as important as the film as each member within had his own reason for being there, for better or worse.

The Seven Samarai as well as the Magnificant Seven, asks this simple question: Who will stand up for those who can't?  Who indeed.",1427587200,,708,4.441860465116279

The story centers around a Mexican village which is terrorized by a local crime lord.  If they had a means of defending themselves and teaching the 'bad guys' a lesson, perhaps all would be okay.  A parade of marquee actors, including Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, Eli Wallach,  and Robert Vaughn, filled out the program.  Wallach was wonderful as the 'bandito' while McQueen and Bronson along with Robert Vaughn were convincing as men who had a checkered past but finally found a cause they could believe in.

The actors in The Magnificent Seven all give second-rate performances.
The screenplay is moronic. It's HollyWOODEN to the core!

Most of these actors are capable of much better so... you can only fault the director, John Sturges, who does not reign in his actors and, obviously, did not make decisions, did not pick apart the script and demand PERFECTION!! The result: mediocrity.

John Sturges DID helm a few VERY good movies such as: Bad Day at Black Rock & Joe Kidd but, in The Magnificent Seven he was just a pedestrian wandering along the side of the road.

I had to turn it off BEFORE the climatic shoot out that ends the film... what'a bummer eh wot?

However, if your attention span is short, if you love TV and mini-series, if you can't stand foreign films, if you hate to read subtitles, if you understand that all Mexican villagers speak fluent English, if you believe that firearms, enough to arm a whole village, can appear out of thin air, well... then this movie is for...

It never ceases to amaze me how all seven gunmen's characters are so thoroughly well-rounded, even though few of them get much screen time. There is much here that rewards the repeat viewer. I especially love to watch Brynner's catlike gait; McQueen's delightful bemused perplexity; Coburn's laconic cool; Bronson's love for the children; Vaughn's rediscovery of his resolve. And the score! I could just swim in Elmer Bernstein's brilliant music.",1419984000,,573,5.161290322580645

876583,5,630442972X,"I believe it is the nature of the THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN gunfighters, their motives for that one chance at gallantry and redemption. That combined with the way the story is visually told makes for its greatness. It teaches us something about nobility, dignity and devotion. The hearse-ride taken up to Boot Hill with Yul Brynner driving and Steve McQueen riding shotgun sets the stage and tone for the entire film. Images such as when Charles Bronson, is bent over with a bullet inside and the three little Mexican boys clutch him crying out his name while in his death throes bring a tear to the eye. In another the viewer reflects along with Yul Brynner as he takes the lifeless James Coburn's knife out of the adobe wall and folds it gently in his hand. These are heart rendering and indelible images. Even Eli Wallach as the bandit Calvera gets his moment of pathos. After being mortally wounded by Yul Brynner's bullet, Calvera can not believe that the seven came back to save the village even after the villagers told them that they did not want their help anymore. ""You came back. A man like you. Why?"" asks Calvera as he dies. Yul Brynner has no answer for him. It was as if Brynner had committed some sacrilege.

Director John Sturges captured the ambiguities of the human spirit in this film.

For me Yul Brynner was the epitome of `cool' and aplomb. From his dark gray and black outfit down to the tip of his thin cheroot he was the kind of man others look up to but keep their distance. Yul Brynner as Chris, was a man of few words and often communicated by the mere gesture of the hand. Of the seven, he was the cohesive element that drew them together simply by his demeanor. The aura of his worldliness beckoned them all to the place he was heading. He was just the first to recognize it. Brynner too was the cohesive element that kept them all together. Brynner was the one who followed some unwritten code of honor that is only alluded to in a few passages. McQueen was perfect as the gunfighter who was ""just drifting"" and signed on with Brynner. The levelheaded McQueen represents the other characters' realizations one by one as they join. James Coburn was perfect, as the stoic knife throwing Britt, who lived only for the thrill of the moment. Charles Bronson as O'Reilly played his stoically rugged but sympathetic role better than any actor could have. Bronson had a unique visual presence whose kind facial expressions counterbalanced his pockmark face and strong physique. Bronson was a conundrum unto himself and perfect for the role. Brad Dexter's performance as the unlucky fortune hunter has gone unrecognized. He was the least noble of the seven and died the mercenary to the end. Still, he gains our sympathy after returning in the clutch and saves his friend Chris and in turn is killed. Dying in the arms of his friend, Chris lets him go to the grave with a lie. Robert Vaughn's character was probably the most interesting of the seven. His enigmatic portrayal of Lee the tormented soul and not really the coward he labeled himself somehow never stood out. Only his act of redemption, his gun play and death during the finale lingers. Vaughn's portrayal is a success because as he said he was ""the coward hiding out in the middle of a battlefield"" and at that he succeeded. Horst Buchholz gave an energetic and bravura performance the only one of the seven that had not yet been corrupted by the world. At the end he symbolically hangs his guns up and roles up his sleeves. Brynner and McQueen say that ""only the farmers have won"" and they lost. It was such a moving ending as they ride off into screen immortality .",1418083200,,3649,4.6036866359447

877013,5,630442972X,"If you like older westerns (that is where the action develops more gradually than is common today), this movie is a blast.  Mexican villagers need help facing down desperadoes.  The villagers have little money, but are willing to fight on their own behalf if they can only get the necessary guns.  They meet Chris Adams (Yul Brenner) who suggests that they hire gunmen (almost all stars or become stars) instead.  They do.
  It's a bit slow at the beginning.  It takes time to sketch seven different characters, even when using the familiar shorthand of Westerns--that's why most westerns using this formula use only four or fewer.  Because there are so many characters and it is a western, the characters aren't much developed individually, but as a group they cover much of the human personality fairly well.
  Frankly, the villagers are more interesting (as they should be) than the characters of the gunmen, who spend most of the time acting cool in classic 60s fashion with a familiar set of assorted quirks and failings.  It is also not quite as good as Seven Samurai, on which the film is based and that also shares some of the same difficulties.  It suffers too from being copied too often, but that's not its fault.",1413763200,4,1224,4.748815165876778

877160,3,630442972X,Sacrilege! I found it slow and dull in many spots. This is a movie much like other iconic films that suffers from all the clones of itself that it spawned. Some of those are more modern and faster paced leaving this the original to seem old and slow by comparison. It deserves to be seen by all students of film like Citizen Kane does and Sunset Boulevard and the Maltese Falcon. But it might not be as popular with younger audiences who have seen the same basic plot done with actors that they can relate to easier. I saw this as a kid and a couple of times since. I really don't want to see it again. The best thing going for it is Elmer Bernstein's Coplanesque score.,1410652800,2,670,4.2421875

My previous recollections  did not quite live up to my more critical evaluation half a century later. Its certainly a good movie, but there are some aspects of it that make me wonder ""Did I really think that the movie was outstanding?""

Take Yul Brynner's walk, it so perfectly John Wayne that I can imagine the director practicing with the actor, over and over until he achieved the perfect cowboy strut, and poor Mexican farmers with a perfect, but accented grasp of English, seems a little implausible.

It was a different age when the movie was made, and in 1960 I suppose that we were all less critical than we are today.

Having made these negative comments, if there is anybody who has never seen it, or seen and forgotten it, then its certainly worth another viewing.",1410480000,,855,4.605263157894737

The bandit, Calvera, comes to life as only the late great Eli Wallach could have achieved. It is the Western version of the classic Japanese film, Seven Samurai.

Some people rate their review by the sophistication of 2014! That is wrong because this movie was shot in 1959 and released in 1960, so it should be judged by those standards and mentality.  It was an excellent movie for 1959-61 and I loved ALL of it.  Yul Brynner in all Black and that walk of his would melt like Ice Cream on a hot summer day.  Steve McQueen with his less talk and more action.  He was a master of facial expressions.  James Coburn with his knife and layed back attitude.  Charles Bronson in his ruggedness and his tenderness with the children. Horst Buckholze being a hothead Eli Wallach was excellent as the villain.  The chemistry was Magnificent!!! When you keep it in the time period it was made you will love it!  They were in top form and the action was moving and you had no idea what was coming next.

877635,5,630442972X,"The great Elmer Bernstein's music alone makes this one of the 10 best films of all time.  The main theme is stirring and unforgettable, and still as fresh as the first time we heard it (probably in a Marlboro add, un fortunately), but listen closely to all the wonderful sub-themes- no music has ever fit its scenes so well.  Especially beautiful are the lilting Mexican ballad as the three farmers ride into the Texas border town, and Chico's love theme.  Simply brilliant.
  Yes, Horst Buchholz was a Mexican peasant boy with a German accent; Yul Brynner always sounded like he was from Lower Slobovia, and even the random cowboy on Boot Hill has a European twang- but the miracle of this movie is that it works despite all that.  I remember seeing it when it first came out, as a kid of 10, and I was so swept up by the opening theme that these guys could have been speaking Russian and I still would have loved it. Almost as good as the music are the hats, with Steve McQueen's the best ever in any western, sweat stains and all.  Savor the recently deceased Eli Wallach's greatest role ever.  What a wonderful actor- a New Yorker totally convincing as a Mexican bandit.  Fault: Brad Dexter was a total miscast, a minor leaguer overshadowed by Hall of Famers.  Anthony Quinn, whom Brynner originally wished to cast as Chris, would have been so much better than Dexter, but such is hindsight. Another Fault:  look for dirt on the farmers' impeccably white outfits- not a spot.  The Mexican censors who oversaw the shooting refused to allow the peasants to look degraded.  In contrast, McQueen's hat looks like it was dragged through a sewer. Go figure.  Nitpick all you want, but  they don't make them like this any more- and if they ever do try to pull off a remake, let's hope the ghosts of the original seven ride onto the set and blast everybody to kingdom come.  But still, it's fun to imagine seven actors who might be cast today.  Can't do it?  Neither can I.  Yes, another timeless western, True Grit, was remade, with an interesting take and great success,  But this one?  It could never be done better, and the will certainly never be another Steve McQueen or Charles Bronson, so why bother?  Best lines:  Bronson (chopping wood for breakfast): I'm doing this because I'm an eccentric millionaire; and McQueen: So far so good, so far so good...",1404172800,,2357,4.599520383693045

I think he's in the movie to be a counterweight to the young Chico (Horst Buchholz), who is played so young as to have no nerves at all.  It's a beautiful looking movie, and the quite complicated action (once the seven get to the village) is kept clear, and the suspense is effectively built.  What seems odd to me now too is the lack of history of the characters, and I think this finally is a strength of the movie -- a mysteriousness about motive that nonetheless doesn't undermine the sense of the seven as a group who totally trust one another, as if some kind of code has become so internalized with them that they don't even have to discuss it.  The one who doesn't quite ""get it"" (though he is obviously enchanted by it) is young Chico, who wants to be like the others but doesn't seem to know why.  The movie gestures at the idea, seen too in ""Ride the High Country,"" that the world has moved on from the days when hired guns were needed and that as a result the men have fallen on hard times -- but we don't see that world in the movie.

The strength of the acting is that each of the main actors (including Eli Wallach [as the bandit Calvera] and Vladimir Sokoloff [as the old man]) has a physical distinctiveness that individualizes him, so that although their characters have no real depth, they never seem anonymous or interchangeable.  They all seem more substantial than the writing for their characters warrants, and that serves to remind us just how important visual impressions are in movies.  Each character has a ""look"" that defines him, and Charles Bronson (Bernardo) and James Coburn (Britt) would trade on that look for years to come in their careers.  Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen (Chris and Vin, the effective leader-planners of the group) were as odd a couple as appeared in a Western before Butch and Sundance, but they have an easy chemistry that works perfectly.  There are sentimental elements -- Bernardo's rapport with the village children who say they'll put flowers on his grave if he dies . . . well, you can guess how that turns out.  And there's Chico and his very forward Mexican maiden who is instrumental in convincing him (not that they talk about it) that his future is as a farmer . . . And, we're told, ""the farmers win.""  These are among the final words of the movie, spoken by the oracular old man, who compares the gunmen to the wind passing over the land and the farmers as being permanent, ""like the land itself.""  In the world of the movie, this passes reasonably credibly for wisdom.

One rough spot -- the relation of the bandit Calvera to the village isn't quite clear.  The means by which he and his men take over the village (clearly with inside help, for no shots are heard) while the seven are out looking for them is a murky spot in the narrative.  Calvera seems to think it reasonable that the village should allow him and his men to take food and supplies on a regular basis, and he clearly also feels that men like the seven -- living unsocialized and with no fixed community -- are in some sense like him, and his last words indicate his incredulity that Chris and his band should feel the village was worth fighting for.  I still find it less than credible that Calvera would let the seven go, and even return their weapons, but that he does so suggests that he feels the pull of that unspoken code among gunmen that binds the seven together.  Of course, if he hadn't done that, we wouldn't have had the final gunfight . . .

An intriguing and not totally transparent movie, then . . . but the questions about it that one can't answer are perhaps part of its enduring appeal and iconic status.",1402272000,,4044,4.430499325236167

For this one it is like they knew from the outset that they were making an iconic Western that would well stand the test of time and influence generations of film makers. With a big nod to Kirosawa's Seven Samuri it opened up the Western landscape and vistas to near character status.next, is the musical score adding depth, color, and gravitas. So much so that even today just a few bars of it evokes visions of the West and quintessential cowboys and range. Spot on performances from the entire cast make it one of the singular best westerns ever made. This film is truly a case of all the parts coming togather to make the sum not only greater, but, quite simply great! I hope generations keep rediscovering this film and keep it part of our national art heritage. Not for any pretense at an attempt to portray things as they really were, but rather in its success at portraying things how we wanted them to be, magnificently.",1392508800,,1009,4.45945945945946

879214,5,630442972X,"This is a precursor to the spaghetti westerns of the 1970's.  Eli Wallach survived into those as the magnificent scoundrel Tuco.  Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen were history.  Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and Robert Vaughn and others moved on.  It was an impressive collection of stars for the epoch.  Someone told me that John Ford played the old man.  It turns out it was Vladimir Sokoloff, from what I can tell.

The movie is supposed to be loosely based on Kurosawa's seven samurai.  I see them as very different movies, though there's numerical coincidence and a similarity of plot line.  Others might see it differently.  Both are great flicks.

It was supposed to be free with Amazon Prime.  I stopped it halfway through and when I got back to it, it was gone.  I hope I didn't pay for it.",1391385600,,797,4.607142857142857

Aside from a few classic lines when Steve McQueen and Yul Bryner took the hearse to Boot Hill and when Yul Bryner gathered the seven, the film was lacking.

879828,1,630442972X,"The hype built up over this movie is one of the looniest, most ludicrous phenomena to ever plague American cinema.  This movie is just plain terrible by today's standards.  All of the actor's EXCEPT for Charles Bronson and Robert Vaughn are stiff, robotic, corny, or melodramatic.  Their accents are terrible.  Brynner sounds like he cannot decide between three countries of origin.  None of them the USA.

The characters are so cliche and phony that you have to laugh.  The writing is absolutely terrible.  There is no reason to care for any one of these people, and there is no logical reason for what happens in this movie.  The villain might as well be that guy with the uptwirled mustache who ties maidens to train tracks.

The action is lame and silly.  Watch this movie after watching Die Hard and you feel like you are watching a bunch of third graders put on an impromptu skit.  The heroes, except for Bronson and Vaughn--and maybe Coburn--are incredibly effeminate.  I'll let you come to your own conclusions there.

The only reason you should ever see this movie is if you are forced to--or if maybe you saw it as a child and want to witness the absolute crap you once held dear.  It is not a classic.  It is a forgettable step in the evolution of American cinema.",1388707200,5,1275,4.6

879941,3,630442972X,"Compared to it's Seven Samurai source material, this movie is not standing up so well. The dialogue is forced and most of the acting is poor. Yul Brynner never misses a chance to ham it up as he struts across the screen.",1388448000,,220,4.261904761904762

880022,4,630442972X,"I bumped into this with my 12-year old and thought ""hey, why not?""

Well, a reason ""why not"" is that on too many occasions these days, I've started up a ""great old movie"" with my media-sophisticated kid, and it's looked beyond hokey (sadly, I include Highlander in this category of classic duds, e.g.).

I promised him that if it wasn't good, we'd stop watching.  Aside from a few non-bloody gunshots (which is great, but less realistic in this sicko era of full realism), the movie really kept the story alive and kept going.

So much so that he and I are planning to watch Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"" some time ...

So if you're looking for an older western that your jaded kid will still enjoy in a good-natured way -- go with this one, you won't be disappointed.",1388361600,,765,4.5144927536231885

880084,5,630442972X,"If you like western movies and have been living under a rock and have never seen it, you will love it. I saw it when it came out at the movies and I bought the DVD so I could watch it several more times. Everyone who likes westerns has a favorite and this is mine. The cast was the best ever assembled. Yul Brenner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Robert Vaughn, Brad Dexter, and Horst Buchholz make up the Seven and Eli Wallach IS the leader of the Bandits. Who knew Yul Brenner, a Russian born Mongol and Horst Buchholz a German born actor, would make believable cowboys. Add to that the fact that the movie is a remake directly inspired by Akira Kurosawa's 1954 Japanese film Seven Samurai.

The movie's musical score by Elmer Bernstein is such a classical icon as to become another actor that totally brings the excitement of the movie to an entirely new level. The score went on to a life of it's own that was used in other movies as well as the U.S. commercial for Marlboro cigarettes and others commercials all over the world.

If the movie isn't enough of a treat this DVD has some extras on it. The special on the ""Making of The Magnificent Seven"" will keep you riveted and wondering how they managed to make it all come together. It includes interviews with the testosterone loaded male cast. Every one with a trick up their sleeve for stealing a scene.

This style of western had never been made before and it paved the way for movie goers to see a new kind of western hero that would follow in what would be called ""spaghetti westerns"" after which sadly the western genre started a slow death. Hopefully a rebirth of the western genre will rise again.

880221,5,630442972X,"If you have never seen the original story of the Seven Samurai the story might seem to have popped up out of whole cloth and so I would recommend seeing the original (in Japanese with English subtitles), movie before seeing the Magnificent Seven.

Never-the-less, the movie is just great and the actors were chosen to play the individual parts to a tee and the ensemble works just great. The individual scenes are nearly a one-for-one match with the scenes in the original Seven Samurai so the writer(s) could focus on the characters which helps make the Magnificent Seven work even better. They are just more believable in the western setting.

On the downside is the somewhat thin take on the individual scenes in the MS versus the depth portrayed in the SS scenes. For instance replacing the MS scene of the boot hill burial of a dead indian for the SS scene where the samurai cuts his cue off to resemble a Buddhist monk in the rescue of the kidnapped child shows the vast depth difference between the two.

Anyway, I have always been a fan of the MS and watch it every now and again to refresh the story of unlikely heroes and insurmountable odds in life.",1387324800,,1160,4.5673076923076925

880966,5,630442972X,"I believe it is the nature of the THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN gunfighters, their motives for that one chance at gallantry and redemption. That combined with the way the story is visually told makes for its greatness. It teaches us something about nobility, dignity and devotion. The hearse-ride taken up to Boot Hill with Yul Brynner driving and Steve McQueen riding shotgun sets the stage and tone for the entire film. Images such as when Charles Bronson, is bent over with a bullet inside and the three little Mexican boys clutch him crying out his name while in his death throes bring a tear to the eye. In another the viewer reflects along with Yul Brynner as he takes the lifeless James Coburn's knife out of the adobe wall and folds it gently in his hand. These are heart rendering and indelible images. Even Eli Wallach as the bandit Calvera gets his moment of pathos. After being mortally wounded by Yul Brynner's bullet, Calvera can not believe that the seven came back to save the village even after the villagers told them that they did not want their help anymore. ""You came back. A man like you. Why?"" asks Calvera as he dies. Yul Brynner has no answer for him. It was as if Brynner had committed some sacrilege.

Director John Sturges captured the ambiguities of the human spirit in this film.
For me Yul Brynner was the epitome of `cool' and aplomb. From his dark gray and black outfit down to the tip of his thin cheroot he was the kind of man others look up to but keep their distance. Yul Brynner as Chris, was a man of few words and often communicated by the mere gesture of the hand. Of the seven, he was the cohesive element that drew them together simply by his demeanor. The aura of his worldliness beckoned them all to the place he was heading. He was just the first to recognize it. Brynner too was the cohesive element that kept them all together. Brynner was the one who followed some unwritten code of honor that is only alluded to in a few passages. McQueen was perfect as the gunfighter who was ""just drifting"" and signed on with Brynner. The levelheaded McQueen represents the other characters' realizations one by one as they join. James Coburn was perfect, as the stoic knife throwing Britt, who lived only for the thrill of the moment. Charles Bronson as O'Reilly played his stoically rugged but sympathetic role better than any actor could have. Bronson had a unique visual presence whose kind facial expressions counterbalanced his pockmark face and strong physique. Bronson was a conundrum unto himself and perfect for the role. Brad Dexter's performance as the unlucky fortune hunter has gone unrecognized. He was the least noble of the seven and died the mercenary to the end. Still, he gains our sympathy after returning in the clutch and saves his friend Chris and in turn is killed. Dying in the arms of his friend, Chris lets him go to the grave with a lie. Robert Vaughn's character was probably the most interesting of the seven. His enigmatic portrayal of Lee the tormented soul and not really the coward he labeled himself somehow never stood out. Only his act of redemption, his gun play and death during the finale lingers. Vaughn's portrayal is a success because as he said he was ""the coward hiding out in the middle of a battlefield"" and at that he succeeded. Horst Buchholz gave an energetic and bravura performance the only one of the seven that had not yet been corrupted by the world. At the end he symbolically hangs his guns up and roles up his sleeves. Brynner and McQueen say that ""only the farmers have won"" and they lost. As they ride off into screen immortality I think we all won.",1379116800,,3638,4.6055469953775034
880967,5,630442972X,"A top notch cast keeps a movie with a threadbare premise alive and well.

For some reason a group of American gunmen agree to take on a Mexican bandito on behalf of a small Mexican village that the banditos have been terrorizing. Why they would be willing to do this for what almost nothing is never really explained, and left me wondering why.

Gradually, he enlists the help of old friends and new acquaintances who are all handy with a gun. Working with the village men, they are able to deter the bandits. However, the threat of the marauders returning has the villagers scared so they turn against their hired guns. In a fit of bravery, Brynner returns with the others fighting desperately to liberate the village. They are ultimately victorious, but not without causalities with four of the men dying. These men were the seven who fought like 700 and they did something seemingly ludicrous because it was the courageous thing to do.

Inspired by Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai (1954), The Magnificent Seven shows how an oppressed Mexican peasant village assembles seven gunfighters to help defend their homes. The film stars Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Robert Vaughn, Brad Dexter, and Horst Buchholz. The film has lost much of its luster over time, so it is today mainly of historical interest.

881480,5,630442972X,"The backstory to THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN is that it is based on Akira Kurosawa's SEVEN SAMURAI. A story about 7 samurai warriors set in classical Japan becomes a old West gunslinger movie set in Mexico? Yes, and it works. Some people consider THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN to be the last of the classic Western genre films. It definitely passes the test of time 50 years later, it is still fresh and entertaining.
Yul Brynner was already a star when THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN went into production with several new and upcoming stars joined the cast--Steve McQueen, Robert Vaughn, James Coburn and Charles Bronson. McQueen teamed up with each of these actors during his career as he did with director John Sturges.
THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN is one of the epic westerns of days gone by. They don't make westerns or films like this anymore. Visually stunning with a great cast, MAGNIFICENT SEVEN is an all time American classic.
There definitely was some interesting casting in this film with Eli Wallach and young German actor Horst Buchholz both playing Mexicans. Young and good-looking with a slight accent of indistinguishable origin made the German actor believable as Chico - one of the seven.
MAGNIFENT SEVEN sets good versus evil. It's a morality play to the fullest degree. The gunslingers maybe tough but they have hearts and souls. Will they be redeemed?
The young actors all went on to greater fame and Buchholz returned to Germany to continue making films. Along with strong performances by Brynner and Wallach, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN lives on in our hearts.",1344297600,2,1549,4.961538461538462

This movie, as you should know is about, who a small Mexican village hired to rid the village of a Mexican Bandit who was pillaging the village of food, and other valuable items. The Seven faced odds of 40 bandits, with the fast guns and the help of those in the Mexican village who were willing to fight as well, made for all great viewing of the action movie. The music, for those who remember, was used also in the Marlboro Cigarettes commercials. This would be a very good buy from Amazon.",1341446400,3,683,4.5528455284552845

If you see it once, then you'll see it a hundred times.  This is the movie against which all other Westerns are compared, and most other films, too.  Every time I watch it, I learn something new about the characters.  And something new about myself.  This film can teach you a lot about life, a lot about death, and a lot about the in-betweens.",1340323200,,500,4.32258064516129
881484,4,630442972X,"Yul Brynner plays a gunman named Chris Adams who is persuaded to help a poor Mexican village which has been terrorized by the outlaw named Calvera (Eli Wallach), robbed of their harvest and basically humiliated. So he gathers up a total of six other gunman (hence the title): Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Brad Dexter, Robert Vaughn, and young Horst Buckholz. They each have their quirks and are each individuals. We get to know what motivates them, and we get to admire their courage as well as their skill with a gun.

McQueen helped Yul Brynner to drive a hearse in the American town where they met when the bigoted townsfolk refused to let the undertaker bury an Indian on Boot Hill. McQueen rides shotgun, commenting that it's the first time he's ever ridden shotgun on a hearse. So Brynner of course includes him in the seven. He does a very low-key, confident style that does not take center stage. Center is Yul's as far as I'm concerned, and he's also obviously the leader of the seven.

They found Bronson chopping wood for his dinner, and even though they had only been promised $20 each, he goes along. Coburn is at least as good with a knife as he is with a gun, as he demonstrates to some braggarts who hassle him while he's just minding his own business, apparently trying to nap.

Brad Dexter wants in because he's convinced there is some treasure that is the real goal, even though Brynner tells him there is not. Robert Vaughn is running from the law, so going to Mexico suits his purposes. Buckholz is a young hot-head who simply refuses to be left behind. When Brynner humiliates him twice (he's had enough to drink that there's no telling what he might do if he was sober), he follows the six men as they head south, and eventually becomes the seventh when they arrive at the village and he berates the farmers as cowards, insists they will learn how to shoot and defend their own village.

The problem is, Calvera has about 40 men, possibly more, and while the seven do indeed teach the village men how to shoot, they don't have all that many guns, and the novice shooters cannot be expected to do all that much. They are out-numbered considerably.

I won't spoil it by telling you how they manage to defeat Calvera, but was there any doubt they would win? Nor will I tell you how many are still alive when the dust settles. Of course you know Yul Brynner survived.

It's not your typical western by any means.",1337126400,,2448,4.5396825396825395
881485,5,630442972X,"THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN is perhaps my favorite film and there are seven good reasons for that. Yul Brynner as Chris, Steve McQueen as Vin, Charles Bronson as O'Reilly, Robert Vaughn as Lee, Brad Dexter as Harry Luck, James Coburn as Britt and Horst Buchholz as Chico are all imbedded into the psyche of anyone who ever saw this movie and felt its emotional impact. These are real screen heroes.

There is something very magical about this film. This is different from every other Western that came before it. I believe it is the nature of the seven gunfighters, their motives for that one chance at gallantry and redemption. That combined with the way the story is visually told makes for its greatness. It teaches us something about nobility, dignity and devotion. The hearse-ride taken up to Boot Hill with Yul Brynner driving and Steve McQueen riding shotgun sets the stage and tone for the entire film. Images such as when Charles Bronson, is bent over with a bullet inside and the three little Mexican boys clutch him crying out his name while in his death throes bring a tear to the eye. In another the viewer reflects along with Yul Brynner as he takes the lifeless James Coburn's knife out of the adobe wall and folds it gently in his hand. These are heart rendering and indelible images. Even Eli Wallach as the bandit Calvera gets his moment of pathos. After being mortally wounded by Yul Brynner's bullet, Calvera can not believe that the seven came back to save the village even after the villagers told them that they did not want their help anymore. ""You came back. A man like you. Why?"" asks Calvera as he dies. Yul Brynner has no answer for him. It was as if Brynner had committed some sacrilege.

Director John Sturges captured the ambiguities of the human spirit in this film. Just as he directed ""The Great Escape,"" Sturges' directorial style is so smooth that his own storytelling glosses right over the depth and complexity of his own work. The ultimate shame is that all Sturges' profoundness is all right up there on the screen. He literally outdoes himself along with a little help from Elmer Bernstein's score and William Roberts' script. Bernstein's insertion of quick tempo snippets here and there into the score advances the film and pulls the viewer right into the narrative with an emotional fervor along with his unforgettable main title theme. William Roberts' script is so full of memorable and engaging dialogue that it too smoothly advances the story with ease and shear magnetism playing on our emotions.

For me Yul Brynner was the epitome of `cool' and aplomb. From his dark gray and black outfit down to the tip of his thin cheroot he was the kind of man others look up to but keep their distance. Yul Brynner as Chris, was a man of few words and often communicated by the mere gesture of the hand. Of the seven, he was the cohesive element that drew them together simply by his demeanor. The aura of his worldliness beckoned them all to the place he was heading. It was the same place they were all going. He was just the first to recognize it. Brynner too was the cohesive element that kept them all together. Brynner was the one who followed some unwritten code of honor that is only alluded to in a few passages. McQueen was perfect as the gunfighter who was ""just drifting"" and signed on with Brynner. The levelheaded McQueen represents the other characters' realizations one by one as they join. James Coburn was perfect, as the stoic knife throwing Britt, who lived only for the thrill of the moment. Charles Bronson as O'Reilly played his stoically rugged but sympathetic role better than any actor could have. Bronson had a unique visual presence whose kind facial expressions counterbalanced his pockmark face and strong physique. Bronson was a conundrum unto himself and perfect for the role. Brad Dexter's performance as the unlucky fortune hunter has gone unrecognized. He was the least noble of the seven and died the mercenary that he was, yet there is some nobility to one's profession in that. Still, he gains our sympathy after returning in the clutch and saves his friend Chris and in turn is killed. Dying in the arms of his friend, Chris lets him go to the grave with a lie. Robert Vaughn's character was probably the most interesting of the seven. His enigmatic portrayal of Lee the tormented soul and not really the coward he labeled himself somehow never stood out. Only his act of redemption, his gunplay and death during the finale lingers. Vaughn's portrayal is a success because as he said he was ""the coward hiding out in the middle of a battlefield"" and at that he succeeded. Horst Buchholz gave an energetic and bravura performance the only one of the seven that had not yet been corrupted by the world. At the end he symbolically hangs his guns up and roles up his sleeves. Brynner and McQueen say that ""only the farmers have won"" and they lost. As they ride off into screen immortality I think we all won.",1336953600,,4975,4.683428571428571

I believe if I had watched this movie first I would of liked it a lot more, however the movie ""Seven Samurai"" is a little longer (3 hours long I think) you get time to feel for the poor peasents,it feels more like a battle of life and death, and the characters are alot more likeable. In this movie the action comes so quick(but it IS a western so what more can you ask for) that it lacks in other areas. This movie wasn't awful and standing as it's own work is rather fun to watch.

Calveri, the Mexican outlaw, would not simply let the seven gunmen go after he captures them. This makes no sense. He would kill them. The idiotic plot twist allows the dramatic return of the seven. And what the director and screenwriter have against farmers is beyond me. I'm guessing no one in Hollywood knows anything about farmers so don't mind criticizing them. I don't think many people in Hollywood know much about agriculture either.
  The film wants to draw a parallel between Calveri and his men and the Seven, because both sides use guns. But that's an example of moral blindness. Chris (Yul Brunner) and his men could walk away. They don't because they want to help the villagers at the risk of their own lives. The two groups of men, although they both use guns, are very different. The Seven  are certainly not saints but they are not on a moral par with the bandits.

The Magnificent Seven is a brilliant re-telling of Kurwosawa's Seven Samuri, told when the 'Western' was a big draw at the box office and movie heroes rode horses and wore wide-brimmed hats.  The characters are portrayed wonderfully by a who's who cast from Hollywood, including Yule Brenner, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Eli Wallach, Charles Bronson and the list goes on.

Going almost toe-to-toe with the special edition DVD, as far as bonus features go, the special edition contains an additional commentary track, as well as an additional featurette.

If the bonus content isn't a deciding factor for you, or even if it is, the picture and sound quality of the blu-ray edition of The Magnificent Seven is worth the upgrade.  A beautiful transfer to HD, the colors are vibrant, the picture is clear and the sound is tuned perfectly.

881583,4,630442972X,"In 1954, filmmaker Akira Kurosawa released the film ""Seven Samurai"" which took the world by storm.

Several years later, a loose US adaptation of the film was written by William Roberts (""Red Sun"", ""The Donna Reed Show"") and given a western setting.

And directing the film would be John Sturges (""The Great Escape"", ""Bad Day at Black Rock"", ""The Eagle has Landed"") and would feature an all-star cast which included Yul Brynner (""The Ten Commandments"", ""The King and I"", ""Westworld""), Steve McQueen (""The Great Escape"", ""Papilon"", ""Bullit""), Charles Bronson (""Once Upon a Time in the West"", ""The Dirty Dozen"", ""The Great Escape""), James Coburn (""The Great Escape"", ""Charade""), Robert Vaughn (""Bullitt"", ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E.""), Brad Dexter (""The Asphalt Jungle"", ""Von Ryan's Express"") and Horst Buchholz (""Life is Beatiful"", ""Tiger Bay"").

The film would be considered one of the top American films of all time (#79 on the American Film Institute's ""100 Years...100 Thrills"") and was nominated for an Oscar for ""Best Score of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture"" and was voted #8 on AFI's ""100 Years of Film Scores"".

The film would lead to three sequels: ""Return of the Seven"" (1966), ""Guns of the Magnificent Seven"" (1969) and ""The Magnificent Seven Ride"" (1972).

VIDEO:

""The Magnificent Seven"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 2:35:1).  For a film shot back in 1960, it was great to watch this film and see a good amount of detail!  From the grime and sweat on the faces of the characters, the detail on the bricks and windows.  Colors are very good, back levels are nice and deep and while I did notice some color fluctuations and a few white specks, I didn't notice any compression artifacts or any major problems.

If anything, fans of the film should be happy with the overall picture quality!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Magnificent Seven"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English 2.0 Mono, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  While the film is primarily dialogue driven, I did notice the horse hooves playing through the surround channels, as with the Elmer Bernstein's musical score.  The bullets and explosions also sound good via lossless and for the most part, for 1960 film, I did like the fact that a 5.1 DTS-HD lossless track was added along with the original monaural soundtrack.

Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and French.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Magnificent Seven"" comes with the following special features:

  Commentary by Producer Walter Mirisch, Assistant Director Robert Relyea, and Actors James Coburn and Eli Wallach- A wonderful commentary featuring in-depth information about the film.
  Guns for Hire: The Making of The Magnificent Seven - (46:54) A wonderful featurette about how ""The Magnificent Seven"" was adapted from Akira Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"" and the competitive nature of the talent in the film.  Also interviews with talent and producers.
  The Linen Book: Lost Images from The Magnificent Seven - (14:48) Maggie Adams, head of MGM's photo archive talks about the discovery of ""The Magnificent Seven"" linen book and also a few of the stars talking about the photography in the book.
  Original Theatrical Trailers - Featuring two trailers.
  Still Gallery - (4:05)

JUDGMENT CALL:

""The Magnificent Seven"" was the first of several Westerns to be based on Akira Kurosawa's popular film.

While the film adaptation of ""The Magnificent Seven"" is much different than the ""Seven Samurai"", the timing of the film was perfect as Westerns were still popular in America and it was one of the few films to see an all-star cast (albeit when many of them were younger) and for the most part, a wonderfully directed film by John Sturges.

While today, the subject of guns for hire, protecting the unfortunate is part of the banality of modern Westerns, part of the the uniqueness of ""The Magnificent Seven"" was that it was based on an impressive film but this time carried out into a Western atmosphere.  Acting by all men were well-done and with the all-star cast, it is no surprise that there were ego's involved in the film and you can see Steve McQueen really trying to do his best to upstage Yul Brynner in the film.

In fact, one of the greatest inclusion for this anniversary Blu-ray release is the fact that we get to learn what took place behind-the-scenes of the making of the film.

It's important to note that there is no difference with this 2011 Blu-ray release compared to what is inside ""The Magnificent Seven"" Collection.  The main thing is these films are now being released individually and if you own the set, no need to buy this Blu-ray release.  With that being said, if you own the 2006 Collector's Edition on DVD, you may want to hang on to that release as it does have the Sir Christopher Frayling audio commentary track not included on this Blu-ray release.

""The Magnificent Seven"" is a satisfying Western with one heck of a memorable score but while I felt the ""Seven Samurai"" was a much better film in terms of character development and pacing, ""The Magnificent Seven"" was still very entertaining and great to see how the adaptation would be carried out as a Western.

I just remember when I first watched the film and seeing how different the film was compared to the original Kurosawa film for the last half hour, I did enjoy the action sequences and for the most part, the personality differences amongst each of the hired guns.

I felt at the time that ""The Magnificent Seven"" was an exciting film and for the Blu-ray release, I'm quite confident that fans of the film or for those looking for Westerns on Blu-ray should definitely check this movie out.  While, I wouldn't call it one of the great Westerns ever made, it's still an entertaining film.

While the sequels did not do any justice for this film (the quality of the films literally slowly go downhill from the second sequel to the next), if you are a Western fan, ""The Magnificent Seven"" is definitely recommended!",1323993600,3,5967,4.901394422310757

""The Magnificent Seven"" is a classic film, one destined to take a highly ranked place in the ""outstanding"" Westerns of the past century.  There's just something soulful (for lack of a better word) about it, something beyond.  A remarkable story line, well written, carried out by a splendid cast, I take this one off the shelf every now and again - because it gives me a sentimental pleasure that is as good each time as it was when I first viewed it years ago, perhaps even more so now.  It's enduring charisma seems to be intensified by time; by all the intangible things that make certain films special to us;  as comforting as talking to old friends after a long absence.  It is more than just ""gunpowder and lead"" - an underlying, simple, but undeniable moral  lifts the story far above what it might otherwise be; brought to life by an unusual chemistry between all of the actors, successfully crafted by talented directing, and spirited by an unforgettable soundtrack.  Who can hear the sound track of The Magnificent Seven without knowing instantly which movie it belongs to?

The stuff of legends, Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen dominate the scenes as equals, successfully establishing strong personalities; playing off each other as the leader (Brynner) and his chosen support (McQueen) of an unlikely group of hired guns who take on a job of protecting a group of poor Mexican peasants who are being plagued by a marauding outlaw - played to the hilt by Eli Wallach,  whose band of renegades return each year to pillage and plunder the villagers of their hard scrabble stores of food.  Peppered by dry humor enough to relieve the serious nature, one scene in particular comes to mind as the group of ""have guns will travel"" head into the Mexican wilderness, remarking about the lack of intelligence a young member displays by trying to join them in such a quest.  ""No, not smart like us,"" Chris (Brynner) succinctly replies.

They are gone but not forgotten - they live on.  That precious art form - film - sees to that.",1320710400,3,2135,4.735135135135135
881586,1,630442972X,"When you are young, maybe in your teens, you get very easily impressed by almost anything, and western films are not the exception. The ""Magnificent Seven"" film's title sounds terrific ! Imagine a film similar to the great ""The Seven Samurai"" but within a western cowboy context !  It sounds very attractive, isn't it ? But now, after 50 years of having seen this film the first time, and with the nostalgia of having seen a very good film in my youth, I gave this film another try and what a disappointment !

I found the film rather mediocre, naive, childish, simplistic and uninteresting. Charles Bronson's and Steve McQueen's performances could not have been more obscure, elementary, amateurish and mediocre. The film is more a comedy than the drama it was supposed to be.

One of the characteristics of a true classic film (like ""Gone with the Wind"") is that it survives the test of time ... it will always be a great film, which certainly is not the case with ""The Magnificent Seven"". If you want to see a true classic western film which I consider to be probably one of the greatest films of this genre and that you will always enjoy whether you are 18 or 80 years old, go and see ""Shane"" with Alan Ladd and Jack Palance. This film was nominated for five Academy awards and Best Picture. This film (""Shane"") is for grown-ups.",1319760000,15,1333,4.569037656903766

The current copy of M7 is my fourth. We've worn out 2 VHS copies and a full-screen DVD.  It plays beautifully on the widescreen set. The detail is amazing compared to the old days of VHS on a 21"" screen. How we lasted that long with a small screen is a wonder...

The first time I saw M7 was in the late 60s. I curled up with my grandfather in his recliner on a Saturday evening and we devoured bowls of popcorn and pretzels with the occasional sausage pizza. [Remember 'Saturday Night at the Movies' which used to run on prime-time TV?] We had a standing date every weekend, provided the movie was worth watching. It is one of my favorite memories of time spent with him - that and Yankee baseball.

I've watched it so many times, I could probably quote each role.

BUT - this issue/copy I noticed an error ... whoever wrote the liner notes goofed.  They listed Yul Brynner and the six others as: ""...are Eli Wallach, Steve McQueen, Horst Bucholz, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn and Brad Dexter."" HOWEVER - Eli Wallach played Calvera, the bandit chief, NOT one of the seven.  The missing seventh member was played by James Coburn.

If you must have only one western in your DVD collection, let it be this one.  You won't regret it. It's worth having if only for the soundtrack! The opening music raises you right out of your seat and makes you take notice of what's to come.  And - what's to come is well worth watching!

However, on the back of the DVD cover it mentions there's a ""Collectible Booklet"" included. When I opened the case for the first time, there wasn't any booklet inside.

Has anyone else bought the DVD recently (within the past 2 years) and found the booklet to be missing? I understand that after 10 years MGM might have made the decision to stop printing the booklet to save costs--especially now that the price of the DVD has dropped. But then why not change the cover graphics and delete the reference to the booklet? If it's indeed now out of print, it's very misleading to advertise that the booklet is still included.

I was able to contact MGM's customer service department and was told they ran out of booklets long ago. This DVD was released in 2001 and reissued in 2008. As I wrote, it would be nice if they could edit the DVD cover graphics to delete mention of the collectible booklet but they won't.

881643,5,630442972X,"The Magnificent Seven(1960) is a Hollywood remake of Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai(1954). Calvera and his bandits steal food from a Mexican farm and leave the people on it to starve. The farmers hire seven gunmen from the U.S.A. to fight off Calvera and his gang. The Magnificent Seven is one of the most enjoyable Westerns ever made. In the years to come, Westerns slowly became dark, violent, and devoid of hope. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly(1967) and Heaven's Gate(1980) are good examples. Westerns weren't fun again until Silverado(1985). Elmer Bernstein's music score for The Magnificent Seven is a classic, too. I own the music score on 7 or 8 different CD's. Bernstein was also a good sport about writing music for the sequels. Elmer Bernstein's Magnificent Seven theme music can be heard in The Magnificent Seven TV series made in 1998. Bernstein's Magnificent Seven theme can be heard on Simpsons episodes, Fahrenheit 9/11(2004), The Ringer(2005), and more.
Bad Manners performed a ""ska flavored"" cover of the Magnificent Seven theme! The Three Amigos(1987) is a spoof of The Magnificent Seven. The cast and crew went down to Mexico to film the whole movie. Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Brad Dexter, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn, and Horst Buchholz play our seven heroes.

881648,5,630442972X,"Another film that ranks high on the list of man movies is THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. Once more you have a group of actors that carried themselves in a way that guys envied them their confidence but that women thought were darn good to look at. The main thing that this film began though (and which carried over to my first ""man movie"" THE DIRTY DOZEN) was that it took a single individual who gathered together a small team to confront an enemy. It would be great to say that this was original to this film but the fact is that it was a remake of a successful Japanese film called THE SEVEN SAMURAI.

Yul Brynner stars as Chris Adams, a gunfighter with a conscious. When he hears of a group of poor Mexican farmers seeking aid in getting rid of a bandit that terrorizes their town and takes whatever they want, he accepts their proposition. With little or no money on hand (the farmers have little of value now), Chris sets out to recruit his team and he starts with Vin (Steve McQueen), another cowpoke who happened to be in the right place at the wrong time.

The two set out to fill in their group visiting other men that Chris has come across at one time or another, each with his own reason for joining or for fleeing their present situation. Britt (James Coburn) has just killed a man with his knife throwing skills in a fair fight that is sure to be questioned. Harry (Brad Dexter) thinks there is hidden gold in the village because what other reason would Chris have for taking on this task? Lee (Robert Vaughan) is a gunslinger looking for a peaceful place to live a quiet life if only for a while. Bernardo (Charles Bronson) sees it as an opportunity. And Chico (Horst Bucholtz) is a youngster who wants to make a name for himself, a boy who has yet to witness death but wants to stake his claim to it.

The team assembled, they head for the village and begin training the men of the village how to defend themselves. They set up traps, show them how to use guns and teach them that they'll have to assist in defending themselves if they want the help of these professionals.

Eventually the bandits return expecting little or no problem. Instead they confront the seven for the first time. The bandit leader is Calvera (Eli Wallach) and he respects the seven but warns them that to stand in his way will result in death. Chris and his crew stand their ground and refuse to leave, choosing instead to defend the town they've been paid little to protect.

Once more we have a movie that is so well thought out and directed, in this case by John Sturges, that not a single moment watched unfold is wasted. Rather than focus on the panoramic vistas offered in most films, we frequently find ourselves in the poor dirt covered village. The heroes we watch are not the typical sort but ones who are flawed in one way or another. This was the beginnings of the anti-hero movement that sprang in the sixties, heroes that were not perfect in every way.

Once more a group of exciting and popular actors was assembled in to one production. Films like these would be impossible to pull off these days due to the contract and financial demands of those involved. The closest anyone has come has been the OCEAN'S ELEVEN films.

THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN led to several sequels and eventually in 1999 to a short run TV series. The noble defense of the small town displays a sense of honor that characters rarely show these days. And in that demonstration of honor we have another piece of what is a part of ""man movies"".",1301184000,,3509,4.447900466562986

881701,5,630442972X,"It was great watching this classic as well as the ""making of"" on this DVD which really clarified why this film was so popular, especially in Europe (of all places).

It's a western, of course.

A gang of Mexican bandits, about 30 of them, invade a village and demand their tribute.  When met with resistance, a bullet in the belly is the villager's reward.  What to do?  They're just farmers, not hired guns.  The elder of the village says go and buy guns!

[It's interesting, in the ""making of"" of this film, they had a censor who had to ensure that the Mexican people were not be degraded in this film as they were in an earlier film, Vera Cruz.  In the original Japanese film, The Seven Samurai, the Seven were hired.  This looked like a degradation, so the censor accepted that the villagers would buy guns, not men.  That they did hire men was an afterthought rather than a main plot point of the earlier adaptation.]

Two men (played by Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen) overhear a funeral director (played by that guy from Time Tunnel!) lament that he cannot bury an Indian body in the cemetery because he'll get shot at.  Apparently the town is so racist that to bury an Indian body into a white cemetery is stating you're an ""Indian lover"" and could get you shot!

After safely getting the funeral wagon to the plot (after much shooting, joking around and a little whiskey to keep ya warm), Brynner (Chris) is confronted by the villagers as to where to get guns, etc.  They convey that they're being taken advantage of and want to get rid of this bandito.

Throughout the film the question is asked why Chris does this.  Is it an honor thing?  Certainly not money (20 dollars, even by 1895 standards is cheap).  And could be he just likes the thrill of being a hired gun.  It's a matter of honor and integrity that the audience is left to ponder.

What makes the film great are several themes:  The camaraderie of seven men, who separate are pretty good but as a solid team are a force to be reckoned with.  This theme has been repeated time and time again, but The Magnificent Seven was the first film to do this successfully.  It's been copied since.

Another theme is the music!  Bernstein's theme is one of the most recognized and even earned an Oscar for that year.  [As an aside, the film was not that hot right out of the gate.  It was only after its hit in Europe and then its subsequent replay to American audiences that it finally caught on.]

Each character gets his scene time.  Each has his own problems and these are confronted.  And not all the Seven make it out alive.  But they all contributed, to a greater or lesser degree, to the successful liberation of the village.

And what of the villagers?  Some resented being helped.  Some resented having their lives complicated.  What was the harm in letting this bandito come down and have some food?  What a price to pay, freedom?

The scene of betrayal was especially poignant with me, really struck a chord.  The realistic scenery, the horse & cowboy battles, the realism of the people and their plight, make it clear why this film has been copied, a TV series and several sequels have been made!  And the new faces of actors who some would go on to bigger and better things - McQueen and Robert Vaughan as a few.

Great ""making of"" on the DVD.  We listen to interviews from the original cast, the controversy of the script (the original scriptwriter did not want a credit), the fear of failure of the film (would it flop?) and so on.

Director John Sturges borrows liberally from both but pays homage and creates something wholly new and original.  By extension you can say that this film also paved the way for the work of Sergio Leone and Sam Peckinpah in keeping the Western alive and vital.  Divorcing this film from it's influences it's a rousing good time.  Solid story and characterization with terrific action.  Yul Brynner projects cool as the leader of the seven.  Steve McQueen begins to cement his reputation as a force to be reckoned with.  Charles Bronson and James Coburn offer solid support.  Horst Buchholz chews the scenery badly.

Everyone knows the story, which is elegant in its simplicity: seven hired gunmen travel to Mexico to defend a small community of farmers against a  predatory gang that outnumbers them about 10 to 1.

The acting is beyond great.  Steve McQueen, the epitome of cool, steals every scene he's in. James Coburn and Robert Vaughn do justice to the script. Even characters who have only a few lines, like some of the villagers, are well-developed.

The leader of the Seven is Yul Brynner, as graceful as a panther and with a kind of Zen thing going on. The leader of the villagers is the Old Man, fellow Russian Vladimir Sokoloff. I guess you could also count Charles Bronson as part of that little ""Bloc"" vibe--at that point in his career, he wasn't far removed from his early life as Charlie Buchinsky, child of recent immigrants. (I should mention here that I have always LOVED Bronson.)

881783,5,630442972X,"A remake of Magnificent Seven as a Western, this movie is more than a knock-off of Kurosawa.  The story is familiar, perhaps--a band of misfit heroes must defeat the evil bandits who are terrorizing a village.  But the acting in this movie is what makes it great.  The Good Guys are lovingly portrayed by classic actors of the 1960s (Yul Brynner, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughan, Steve McQueen, to name a  few) and even the leader of the Bad Guys is beautifully and complexly portrayed by Eli Wallach.  You have to wonder how much fun they had making this movie, with a cast like that!

If you are a fan of Spaghetti Westerns and all the modern remakes of the genre (Unforgiven, 3:10 to Yuma, etc.) then you really owe it to yourself to see where the revival began.  Thanks to Kurosawa and the various remakes of his movies, the Western took on a new life, with a darker, more modern feel and a far more complex story line.  This is not the simple scenario with the hero in a white hat defeating the man in black.  Instead, the film creates an entirely new hero mythology.  If you're looking for ""reality"" you won't find it in this movie, but if you're looking for the enduring myths and values that continually draw us to the ""frontier"", and all the fascinating characters that populate that landscape, then this is your film.  The director, John Sturges, explores the complexity of a series of flawed heroes as they struggle to redeem themselves by saving others.  We see many of the stock characters of modern movies--the restless macho men who can't settle down (Brynner and McQueen), the gunman who has lost his nerve (Vaughan), the perfectionist who can't rest until he's sure he's mastered himself (Coburn).  Many of these characters are richly drawn and unforgettable, which is why this film is a classic.  If you've never seen it before, you're in for a real treat.",1259798400,,1888,4.664652567975831

881785,2,630442972X,"I know this is considered a classic. The theme music is sublime, and it features some great Hollywood actors in their prime. And I am not comparing the film to Kurosawa's, because I think that is an unfair comparison (apples and oranges, so to speak). But after watching this again as middle-aged adult, I found it impossible to suspend my disbelief in the face of one silly situation after another.

First of all, a shaven-headed man as pale as Chris Adams (Yul Brynner), living and riding along the Texas/Mexico border? The back of his neck isn't even pink, much less red! He could have single-handedly terrified the evil bandito Calvera and his men into surrendering without firing a shot. They would have thought he was a spectral emissary from some unknown world and fled in panic at the site of him. But wait, there's more. This ghostly chrome-dome has a Russian accent, but one of his buddies refers to him as a Cajun. Huh?

Even more confusing is the presence of a young white guy with a strong German accent, named... wait for it... ""Chico"" (Horst Buchholz). Early in the film, Chico demonstrates his lack of skill with a pistol and his inability to hold his liquor, yet Chris Adams later lets him join the Seven, apparently because Chico is good at catching and cooking fish. (Presumably Chris isn't concerned about facing a hail of Mexican bullets with an inept greenhorn at his side, as long as he can die with a bellyful of tasty trout caught fresh from the river).

The film gets progressively weaker as the peaceful Mexican villagers
are given more and more lines, as the adult actors are even worse than the child actors. The accents are inconsistent, and these supposedly south-of-the-border thespians look as if they have never plowed a single furrow or picked up anything heavier than a taco.(However back in the day it may have been much harder to find the excellent caliber of Mexican-American actors that we take for granted today).

The ultimate insult to the viewer's intelligence comes when Calvera (Eli Wallach with some bronzer on his face) runs the Seven out of the village, but then kindly gives them all their weapons back once they are a couple miles outside of town. Suddenly Calvera seems far from the ruthless villain we need him to be, in order for the proper amount of bloodlust to be generated for the final battle to have the neccesary cathartic quality.

Another disappointing feature is the annoyingly frequent appearance of the simpering Horst Buchholz, as compared to the unfortunate underuse of the considerable talents of James Coburn. (Coburn's lines can be counted on one hand, with fingers left over). Some of Buchholz's scenes (clowning around with a complacent bull, mooning at an inexplicably smitten senorita) have a painfully Disneyesque quality that erodes the fine edge that McQueen and Brynner bring to the film.

It just seems like the authentic locations and the several fine actors here could have been put to much better use. Be prepared to enjoy this one merely for the Hollywood nostalgia and overall Wild West atmosphere, but don't try to take it as a serious film or you will be very disappointed.",1252368000,7,3160,4.8317929759704255
881786,2,630442972X,"It is a hard order to fill if you want to reinvision Akira Kurosawa set within an American western using a hodgepodge of ethnic actors.  Not only are you attempting to recreate the same symbolic references and deep moral elements of an already established cult classic, but there are so many other outside elements that may be harder to control than simply samurai's saving a small village.  None the less, director John Sturges tried, and the final result was the abysmal ""The Magnificent Seven"".  Not to plot my course to early, but being a large fan of Kurosawa's masterpiece, I had to put that aside and see this film for what it was - what Sturges envisioned - instead of just making comparison after comparison.  With sloppy characters, lacking detail, American-ized natives, and a grossly unoriginal villain - this 1960 classic is only memorable for a couple of key performances and an energetic score.  Outside of that, Sturges uttered blasphemy on Kurosawa's work.

Again, I said I wouldn't compare the two works - so every attempt will be made not to.  There were high hopes for ""The Magnificent Seven"", a family favorite film that has somehow slipped through my viewing time, but the moment this film began my attention began to fade.  With a weak opening, and a lackluster retrieval of heroes to protect the village, ""The Magnificent Seven"" came out of the gates with a mere gallop, and eventually didn't even finish the race.  As mentioned, our villain has these long monologues of corruption and greed, but when it comes down to it, Calvera didn't have the true evil gene.  He was corrupt, but it was only skin deep.  Outside of the typical ransacking of small villages, his character demonstrated no true evil - albeit with a PG rating, what could he do - but I don't believe Calvera could strike fear in any child today.  Eli Wallach is to blame for this.  Yet, he wasn't the only one dragging his feet.  This film was bombarded by lackluster acting.  Yul Brynner, the obvious lead, seemed to sputter his lines without a moment of emotion or spirit.  His pathetic portrayal of Chris Adams, the main cowboy hired to protect, fell flat and was boring to the average viewer.  That same description could also be used for most of those that he recruited (what is the saying, flies attract flies?), sans Steve McQueen.  As a fan of McQueen's work, I was impressed by the way he picked up the lacking flag of the others.  While he didn't provide much to each scene, he was interesting to watch, obviously caring more about the overall performance than Brynner did.  Unlike Kurosawa's epic, this didn't focus as much on the men of the mission, just that they could be there to attack whoever descended onto the village.  There was no individual character development, and when there was (see: Robert Vaughn's nightmare) it was rushed and ill-focused.  Whereas in ""Samurai"" we felt something for each of the heroes, in this - nobody seemed to have the courage to stand forward and introduce themselves to us.

I must admit - this film was boring.  From the introduction, to the recruiting, all the way to the repeat battle - ""The Magnificent Seven"" provided little-to-no entertainment.  With no character to stand behind, it was left up to the action to drive the focus, but alas, this seemed to fall short as well.  I can agree that there were some decent moments that spoke for the western genre, but nothing challenging.  Evil riders would ride in, gunshots would smoke, people would fall, and finally there would be celebration.  Thinking about it now, it felt as if Sturges was providing us a cheapened Cliff-Notes version of the original tale.  With a running time of a mere 128 minutes, there is no way you could capture the intensity and drama behind Kurosawa's original 203 minute epic.  Again, not to compare side by side - but what made the original work was the characters, the story, the intensity that Kurosawa was able to push through your television set.  ""The Magnificent Seven"" felt like a rushed Hollywood project that had big stars, but no heart.

Overall, I really wanted to like this film.  The cast itself sells this movie, but as a viewer of cinema, it just seemed like a poorly constructed feature.  Hollywood was attempting to make a dime on Kurosawa's original idea, and it failed.  I cannot watch this movie again, nor would I.  The acting is atrocious, the story is choppy, and there was no real threat.  The idea that these villagers could survive year after year of this attack forced me to believe that perhaps Calvera wasn't robbing them blind.  We weren't given enough history of the violence prior to the introduction of our heroes.  This just felt rushed from the beginning, but remained dull after seeing the sheer brilliance of ""Seven Samurai"".  Watch this, if you must, for the music and McQueen, everything else is pure rubbish.

After that, the load of Hollywood hokum that was injected into what was already a pretty uninspired job of writing and directing gets in the way.

And why does James Coburn need to nap at every opportunity, and why does he take a switchblade to a gunfight?  Why is Robert Vaughn taking on a task for which his cowardice makes him unsuited?  And why do three kids for no apparent reason adopt, and ultimately cause the death of, Charles Bronson -- how come no one else gets a retinue?  How is it that Horst Buchholz can amble into the banditos' camp without being spotted as an outsider?

881842,4,630442972X,"Last year, a theater in Manhattan was doing a retrospective of United Artists films.  I decided to see ""The Magnificent Seven"" again on the big screen.  Seeing it left me with a stange feeling of sadness.
This film was released in 1960.  At the time, Yul Brynner was still a superstar and Eli Wallach was a fairly established actor.  The rest of the cast were still young and fresh.  Steve McQueen was still doing ""Wanted-Dead or Alive"" on TV.  He was still three years away from superstardom with ""The Great Escape.""  Charles Bronson would continue guest-starring on shows like ""Combat"" and ""The Fugitive,"" as well as appearing in supporting roles in popular epics like ""The Great Escape,"" ""Battle of the Bulge"" and ""The Dirty Dozen""  He would not become a massive superstar until ""Death Wish"" in 1974.  Coburn also did tv and supporting roles in films like ""Americanization of Emily"" and ""Charade.""  He became ""Our Man Flint"" in 1965.  Robert Vaughn became ""The Man from UNCLE"" in 1964.  Now, with the exception of Vaughn and Wallach, they are all gone.  It seems sad.
The thing that always surprises me about this film is that despite having a great action director in John Sturges, (one of my favorites,) the action scenes are really quite average.  Other than McQueen flying through the air firing his pistol, there really isn't anything spectacular about the action sequences.  The deaths of Bronson, Vaughn and Coburn, (gee I hope I haven't given anything away,) are especially uninteresting.  One minute Coburn is shooting, the next minute he is shot, we don't even actually see him hit.  I love so many of Sturges' films, especially ""The Great Escape ""and ""Ice Station Zebra,"" however the action scenes really are disappointing.
I watched the deluxe dvd last night with the audio commentary by film historian, Sir Christopher Frayling.  The commentary was good, although I did enjoy his commentary on the dvd of ""Once Upon a Time in the ""West"" musch better.  How Frayling could fail to mention once Sturges' all-time classic ""The Great Escape"" is beyond me.  The dvd has a nice retrospective and some other featurettes including one on Elmer Bernstein who composed the magnificent music for this film and ""The Great Escape"" (as well as two great Duke Wayne scores ""The Sons of Katie Elder"" and especially, ""The Comancheros.""
I enjoyed watching the dvd again.  It brought me back to a time, 1960, when show-biz legends like McQueen and Bronson were just beginning.  It also brought me back to a time when American school children were still being taught American history in our schools and not just being taught to hate their own country.

881847,5,630442972X,"Director John Sturges' remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1954 epic ""Seven Samurai"" ranks as one of the greatest westerns ever made. Along with Robert Aldritch's shoot'em saga ""Vera Cruz,"" ""The Magnificent Seven"" exerted considerable influence the look and subject matter of many later Spaghetti westerns. Sturges had gained an impressive reputation in the genre with two contemporary westerns ""The Walking Hills and ""Bad Day at Black Rock"" as well as his frontier oaters ""The Law and Jake Wade,"" ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral,"" and ""Last Train from Gun Hill."" Sturges specialized in all-male actioneers with tough guys in the life and death situations. Visually, he relied on low-angle photography to give his pictures a larger-than-life look, and he staged his gunfight sequences as if they were football game strategies.

Sturges began a long association with ""The Ten Commandants"" composer Elmer Bernstein on ""The Magnificent Seven."" Not only did Bernstein receive an Oscar nomination for Best Original Score for his music on ""The Magnificent Seven,"" but he also got an Oscar nod when he reprised his score in Burt Kennedy's 1966 sequel ""Return of the Seven."" Aside from Sturges' masterful direction, ""The Magnificent Seven"" boasts a top-notch cast. Sturges was largely responsible for these brilliant casting choices. Many of them, including Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Robert Vaughn, and Charles Bronson, achieved superstar prominence during the 1960s. ""The Magnificent Seven"" was lensed on location by Charles Lang in Durango, Mexico, and on some rather obvious sets at Churubusco Studios, Mexico City. Lang had filmed ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral"" as well as ""Last Train from Gun Hill"" with Sturges and would go on to shoot the unlikeliest Sturges movie ""A Girl Named Tamiko.""

""The Magnificent Seven"" takes place in the late 19th century. The first scene occurs in a small, anonymous Mexican village as a bandit, Calvera (Eli Wallach of ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly""), and his 40 gunmen steal enough food to feed themselves. After Calvera and his gang depart, the campesinos convene in the square to formulate a plan of defense. ""If he takes our crop, we might as well cut our throats and be done with it,"" laments one farmer. They visit the Old Man (Russian character actor Vladimir Sokoloff of ""Cloak and Dagger"")and seek his advice. ""Fight,"" he urges them. ""Go to the border and buy guns.""

The frontier west has settled down and our heroes are roaming the land in search of work. Chris (Oscar winning actor Yul Brynner of ""The King and I"") and Vin cross paths in a dusty little hamlet when the local citizens refuse to let an Indian named Old Sam be buried in a predominantly white cemetery. ""How long has this been going on?"" inquires a traveling salesman. ""Since the town got civilized,"" remarks the undertaker, Chamlee (Whit Bissell) and tries to give corset salesman Henry (Val Avery of ""The Anderson Tapes"") his twenty dollars back. Three of the villagers arrive in town as Chris and Vin decide to drive the hearse up to Boot Hill. ""Never ridden shotgun on a hearse,"" quips Vin. Chris wounds two men trying to block their way and the townspeople unload the coffin and bury it.

The three villagers approach Chris and ask him to help them buy guns. ""Men are cheaper than guns,"" Chris advises them and they assemble six men. The pay is a double eagle for four to six weeks with food and board thrown into the bargain. So moved is Chris by their earnestness that he decides to help them. ""I've been offered a lot for my work,"" he assures the Mexicans, ""but never everything."" Initially, Vin is reluctant about joining up. When he learns the job pays twenty dollars, he shrugs, ""Would pay for my bullets."" The third man to join up is gold-seeking Harry Luck (Brad Dexter) who believes that there must be more to it if the Cajun-speaking Chris has decided to him the villagers. Bernando O'Reilly (Charles Bronson) is chopping wood for his breakfast when Chris offers him twenty dollars. ""Right now that's a lot of money,"" he agrees. Britt (James Coburn) and Lee (Robert Vaughn) and a Mexican farmer turned gunfighter, Chico (German born actor Horst Buchholz), follow. At first, Chico doesn't make the grade but later he proves his worthiness.

The seven teach the villagers to defend themselves with rifles they obtain from Calvera's men sent to spy on them. They also erect new walls in the village. ""They won't keep me out,"" Calvera surveys them on his return to the village with his forty gunmen. Chris explains, ""They were made to keep you in."" A gunfight erupts. All seven survive the first foray, but the triumphant villagers are caught off-guard when Calvera's men hang around. When combat breaks out again, the villagers split into fractions. Half decide hiring the seven constituted a mistake. Chris and company change tactics, mount an offensive against Calvera, but find his camp empty. When they arrive back in the village, the seven discover that one fraction has sold them out, but Calvera refuses to kill them. He fears that their friends from up north might retaliate so he takes their guns and lets his men escort them to the border.

""The Magnificent Seven"" brims with irony. The Old Man advises the villagers to buy guns, but Chris tells them that men with guns are cheaper. Although the hiring price of twenty dollars is low, the high-priced O'Reilly joins because ""right now twenty dollars is a lot."" Similarly, Chris signs on because nobody has ever paid him everything. Lee suffers from paranoia so he decides to hide out in the worst place imaginable. ""The final supreme idiocy,"" he confesses, ""a deserter hiding out on a battlefield."" The performances are memorable as is William Roberts' dialogue. In one scene, Vin observes, ""It took me a long time to learn my elbow from a hot rock."" ""The Magnificent Seven"" qualifies as my favorite western.

Horz Bucholz's impetuous kid act was just total corn.  Talk about bad acting.  Robert Vaughn deliberately affects some kind of bizarre weakling voice quality.

 The whole premise of the movie was that the villagers were wothless cowards but Bronson goes off his head proclaiming how brave they are because they're dirt scratching farmers.  The 40 banditos ride into the village and the hired guns(the seven) expose themselves in positions where they could easily be shot by less than half of 40 banditos.

The banditos get the drop on the seven when the seven return to the village and the ultimate in movie absurdity happens.  The banditos let the seven go on their merry way AND give them their guns back.  Any self respecting Mexican bandito would have slit their throats, but not in this fantasy universe.  This is truly one of the worst westerns I've ever seen.  I just don't understand why this movie has gotten the hype that it has.  Probably simply because it had Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen in it.",1226534400,11,1143,4.805128205128205
881849,5,630442972X,"Whilst this probably isn't the best western ever made its certainly up there amongst the top flight. It was fortunately made a few years before 'A Fistful of Dollars', which changed westerns and what was expected from them.

Take the classic Kurosawa film 'Seven Samurai' (which is given its due in the opening credits) and reinvent it in the American west. Then add the staggeringly good cast of Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, Eli Wallach, James Coburn and Robert Vaughan and what you have is a near perfect piece of Cinema. Some of these guys (like McQueen) were not the bigshots they would later become, but they are incredibly cool. Just a look is enough for these actors. For example, James Coburn hardly says a word throughout the film, and he has arguably the best scene - the knife vs gun moment.

Sure its not a great film in the way 'The Searchers' is, but for straightforward entertainment this is hard to beat. And for those who criticise it as being dated and slow, I'm afraid you've been watching too many modern Hollywood blockbusters. What makes The Magnificent Seven substantially better than a lot of modern films, is that its a simple morality tale, and in the end you do care about the villagers and the Seven.

As a simple comparison the film I watched prior to this one was 'Swordfish' a 2001 film starring John Travolta and Hugh Jackman. Not a bad film. It has a great start. But its not in the same league as The Magnificent Seven. After the start it becomes an exercise in CGI, explosions, car chases and computer screens. Its worth seeing, just, but its a largely souless, depressing piece of filmmaking. Saying that of course there are much worse films than Swordfish out there...

A final word on The Magnificent Seven, listen to the wonderful music score by Elmer Bernstein. There haven't been many more evocative soundtracks than this one.",1221868800,,1883,4.7317073170731705

I first saw it as a little kid and have watched it a number of times since.  It's the values that it portrays and the character that it inspires that makes it such an enduring classic for me.  It's about a small village in Mexico that's being terrorized by a bad guy named Calvera and his 40 honchos.  The villagers don't know what to do being poor peasants, so they head north to the U.S. to buy guns for themselves.  They meet Brit (Yul Brynner) and Ben (Steve McQueen) who advise them to hire men instead.  Gunslingers are cheaper than guns....  So they approach Brit, who goes on to assemble a crew (total of 7) to head down south.  The money offered for the job is very little, but it's everything the villagers have.  Brit is moved, having been offered a lot of money in the past, but never everything - that's just one of the many great lines from the movie.  They get down to the village and end up squaring off with Calvera and his men in a great showdown.

There are many wonderful line and wonderful ideas portrayed in the movie. One other great idea is uttered by Bernardo O'Reilly (Charles Bronson) who is admired (and followed everywhere) by several local boys.  One day they tell Bernardo that their fathers are cowards, because they are afraid to fight Calvera.  However, nothing could prepare them for Bernardo's reaction - he spanks the kid and gives them all a lecture.  Their fathers are not cowards because they had the courage to raise families and work hard for them day in and day out.  Then he says that he himself (Bernardo) is coward as he's never had the courage to start a family and settle down.  ""Shooting is easy"" he say to the surprised boys.  Each of the 7 men has their own story and motivation for being in the fight.  Some perhaps not so altruistic as others.  But most of them went to fight for the village as a way of their own redemption.

Tired of being plundered every year by the evil Calvera (exquisitely played by Eli Wallach), poor Mexican villagers come to an American town to buy guns for protection. Yul Brynner convinces them to buy men instead, because ""nowadays, men are cheaper than guns"".  The men who take on the job of protecting the village are outnumbered 100 to 7. They represent a cast that shames any modern ensemble: joining Yul Brynner are Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and Robert Vaughn, supported by Brad Dexter and newcomer Horst Buchholtz. The showdown between Wallach and Brynner beautifully illustrates their moral differences. Wallach declares ""if God did not want these villagers sheared, he would not have made them sheep"", to which Brynner replies ""ride on"".  It takes some time for the movie to reach the intense action of their ultimate battle, but this is part of what separates the ""Seven"" from other westerns. In the end, good triumphs over evil, one of the Seven stops denying his roots and stays behind with the villagers, and the excellent musical score helps us all ride into the sunset. Trivia note: Brad Dexter later saved Frank Sinatra's life on the set of the movie ""None But the Brave"". (He moved Sinatra away from a set that was collapsing).

Directed by John Sturges in 1960, the story line is lifted directly from Akira Kurosawa's SEVEN SAMURAI, a 1954 masterpiece, that depicted the struggle between Japanese peasants and the heartless bandits who intend to seize their land and assume ultimate control over their hard earned resources.

In the case of MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, the plot has been transposed to the struggle between Mexican bandits--specifically the evil Calvera (Eli Wallach)--and the farmers for whom corn is their predominant cash crop.  The title 'Seven' are a group of gunslingers, lead by Chris (Yul Brynner), a skillful renegade.  He bands together an unlikely posse.  This includes the inexperienced Chico [or ""boy"" in English], played by German actor Horst Buccholz, Harry Luck (Brad Dexter), Vin (Steve McQueen), Bernardo O'Reilly (Charles Bronson), Britt (James Coburn), and Lee (Robert Vaughn).  Together these gunslingers train the locals how to shoot guns and defend themselves, as well as instilling in them a sense of courage and newfound self-worth.

It's so wonderful, for me, to see Yul Brynner in one of the best roles of his career.  Before, the only association I really had with him was that of ""The King"" in THE KING AND I, and it's truly a pleasure to see him as a swaggering and heroic cowboy.  What's more, the score is truly unforgettable--particularly, the theme song that resonates throughout the film, composed by Elmer Bernstein. Enjoy!",1201305600,5,1548,5.16

Yul Brynner is the star & boss of the seven. I'm not sure who did the casting but, in some ways, this was brilliant casting  so brilliant. Brynner was a good actor but sometimes a tad stiff, he hadn't done a western yet at this point in his career, but I haven't ever felt he was miscast. Steve McQueen was simply brilliant in his role, already a veteran of westerns via Wanted: Dead or Alive. McQueen was great delivering a line or, as he did in many instances, great at the nuances of body language communication. Horst Buchholz, a German actor, was miscast in his role (Hollywood ever searching for international actors to put in a movie). Other actors in this movie, some soon-to-be stars include: Charles Bronson (well cast), James Coburn (well cast), Eli Wallach (brilliant), Robert Vaughn (not good) & Brad Dexter (worse).

I won't go into details of the plot, others have already done that, & this movie should be recognized by most, it is, after all, one of the most aired movies on television.

881961,4,630442972X,"John Sturgis' 1960 classic western, ""The Magnificent Seven"", pits seven gunfighters against a band of ruthless bandits for the fate of a small Mexican village.  In the process, Sturgis successfully translates an equally classic Japanese samurai legend to the setting of the American West.

Yul Brynner is Chris, the leader of the Seven, a steely-eyed gunfighter who takes pity on the beleaguered villagers.  He is nicely backed by Steve MacQueen as a down-on-his-luck gambler looking for a stake.  Charles Bronson is a Mexican-Irish gunsel who develops a soft spot for the children of the village.  James Coburn is pitch-perfect as a taciturn knife-fighter.  Robert Vaughn works a complicated portrayal as a gunfighter who has lost his nerve.  Veteran actor Brad Nelson almost disappears in the cast as an older gunman looking for a last payday.  Horst Buchholz nearly steals the show as a young and inexperienced wanna-be.  Eli Wallach is superb as the wise-cracking and cynical bandit chief.

The magnificent seven will take on the job of defending the village, only to find the banditos are persistent.  When given a chance to walk away from a final confrontation with the bandits, the seven will elect to fight it out in a duel to the death that not all will survive.

They are seven and only three will survive and two come back. They risk their lives for nearly nothing, twenty dollars, but for the sake of adventure and to prove they are the best shots, the best human beings, the best planners. The twist in this film is that they are successful first, then defeated and then successful again. That proves the point. They are ready to die to defend human decency, human freedom, justice, and to teach with their death how to fight, resist and conquer one's own freedom. A very light touch of romance is added, just enough to prove the point that man loves freedom and justice more than anything else. But let's say that four dead out of seven, fifty seven per cent casualties, that is poor productivity, even in the wild wild west.

881967,5,630442972X,"First-rate film, it easily makes my list of the Top 10 westerns. Here are a few points to ponder:

""The Magnificent Seven's"" score by Elmer Bernstein received a 1960 Oscar nomination but the award that year went to ""Exodus""; which ""featured"" something called ""The Exodus Song"" (with lyrics by Pat Boone!!). 45+ years later there is not even a CD release of ""Exodus"" while the score from ""The Magnificent Seven"" is one of the most recognized pieces of music ever written. If anyone needs proof of the staggering lameness of academy voting this is the most obvious of countless examples.

The score was further popularized in the late 1960's as the theme for Marlboro cigarettes. An odd bit of irony given that Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, and Jorge Martinez de Hoyos all died of lung cancer; Horst Buchholz and Charles Bronson of pneumonia, and Brad Dexter of emphysema.

In the film, only two (Brynner and McQueen) of the seven leave the village alive (Buchholz survives but stays behind). In real life these two actors were the first to die, preceding the others by about 20 years.

The other four deaths (only Robert Vaughn is still alive) occurred over just a nine-month period (James Coburn in Nov 02, Brad Dexter in Dec 02, Horst Buchholz in March 03, and Charles Bronson in Aug 03).

The individual vignettes with Wallach, McQueen, Coburn, and Bronson are little classics. And yet, and yet ...

I first saw TM7 in a theater when it was first released and grew up watching the Marlboro Man on TV so I was looking forward to seeing TM7 again in its orginal glory. But as I watched, I found myself thinking: Had Horst Buchholz really been this annoying? Were the villagers always such wooden actors? Wasn't there more interaction among the Seven? Weren't there more gunfights in the original? In short, it is a very good movie, but it isn't THE Magnificent Seven - the one in my memory for 46 years.

I had never had the opportunity to watch this film until I ran across it late one evening on public television, so I seized the chance to experience the ""greatest Western ever.""

Given the melodrama, banality, and over-the-top acting so prevalent in films at the time, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN still requires a suspension of disbelief unhindered by the cosmos themselves.  Yul Brynner. . .in a Western?  As King of Siam or Pharaoh of Egypt, sure; but not as a grim-faced leader of six thugs and misfits on horseback.  Too often, as I watched Brynner turn to his sidekick in this film (Steve McQueen), I expected him to say, ""So let it be written, so let it be done!""  I guess my point is (if there is a point to any of this), if the viewer is constantly putting the lead character into other roles more suitable while watching a film, the film itself becomes unsuitable.

As to the ensemble of the ""Seven,"" the guys never meshed, in my view.  Charles Bronson was too bizarre while Brad Dexter too plain and James Coburn should have taken an extra couple of visits to the buffet line on the set.  The prim and proper Robert Vaughn comes across as the Donald Trump of cowboys (which means his character is a howler), and I never was able to figure out if Horst Buchholz was supposed to be Hispanic, American, European, or extra-terrestrial.

Fact is, I never was able to figure out what all the hoopla was (and is) surrounding this film.

For Westerns to be engaging, the actors have to seamlessly take the viewer into the story. . .make him or her care what happens.  Instead, with THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, I spent too much time guffawing.  Sorry, Western lovers, this film was way too contrived and hackneyed for me.  Maybe if Yul Brynner had been driving a chariot. . .

882011,5,630442972X,"John Sturges acquires a reputation as a solid director of superior Westerns filled with tense action scenes such as: ""Escape From Fort Bravo,"" ""Bad Day at Black Rock,"" ""Backlash,"" ""Gunfight At The O.K. Corral,"" ""The Law and Jack Wade,"" ""The Last Train From Gun Hill,"" ""Sergeant Three,"" ""The Hallelujah Trail,"" and one of the best of all Wyatt Earp movies, ""Hour of the Gun.""

He succeeds in one of the most exhilarating opening sequences of all Western movies, when he had McQueen and Brynner riding a hearse up legendary Boot Hill creating a mood and peril that never allow the slightest degree of viewer confusion or ennui... For Sturges, the West is a man's world, and his cool, hard, detached style, emphasizing action, excitement and the rugged environment of the frontier, endorses the point...

""The Magnificent Seven"" is derived from Kurosawa's superb ""The Seven Samurai,"" a compelling tale of intimidated and impoverished medieval villagers hiring mercenary warriors to repel bandit ravages... The villagers in this case are Mexicans, plagued beyond all bearing by the activities of bandit Calavera, who always leaves them on tortillas and few beans... Three of them cross the border to offer meager pay and sustenance for any professionally skilled fighting men who will aid them...

Yul Brynner is the man, dressed in black, with the luminous dome and the hypnotic Mongolian eyes who portrays the distinctive Chris Adams leader of the seven hired gunmen hired to chase some 'flies from a little Mexican village.'

Eli Wallach is memorable as Calvera, chief of the ruthless outlaws... He is greedy and merciless terrorizing without pity the poor peasants...

Steve McQueen gives a standout performance as the sardonic gunman ('We deal in lead, friend'), carrying appealing ease and sense of humor to his role as Vin, Brynner's first recruit and second-in-command...

Charles Bronson portrays Bernardo O'Reilly, who explains his curious name to Chris, with 'Mexican on one side, Irish on the other--and me in the middle!' Bronson, the strongest face in Western, and with a bit of Mexican in him--cunning face, steady eyes, revealing voice--the character of Bernardo O'Reilly suits him perfectly... This half-breed gunfighter becomes the conscience of the team... Because of his tender paternal instincts, he is adopted by three children who promise him, in case he falls, to bring him, every day, fresh flowers...

Robert Vaughn--who was to do nicely on TV in ""The Man from Uncle"" spy spoof-- plays Lee, the 'good gun' with black gloves and nightmares, living in style with no enemies alive...

Brad Dexter plays Harry Luck, Brynner's happy friend who returns to join the team convinced of the existence of a large amount of hidden gold...

James Coburn makes a big impression as Britt, the expert gunman who can out-draw a gun with his knife-throwing... His looks and vague figure of violence are quite a response for his few talks...

Horst Bucholz represents youth, eagerness, and the urge to be proved and sorted out from the boys... He was caught on the road by Rosenda Monteros...

Robert J. Wilke is Britt's insisting challenger who swells the ranks of the villains in many Westerns like ""High Noon,"" ""The Far Country,"" and ""Man of the West.""

The Magnificent Seven's success spawned three sequels: ""Return of the Seven"" (again starring Yul Brynner), ""Guns of the Magnificent Seven"" and, last and least of all, ""The Magnificent Seven Ride.""

882013,3,630442972X,"Looking back at westerns in a 21st century point of view, sometimes we tend to look to into the acting and production styles of a different era. Our opinions may jump quickly at these differences, but we must recognize the style of the era and the technology up to the era as well. In Sturges' The Magnificent Seven, an all-star cast is assembled to bring the Seventh Samurai in a western setting. The ones that stand out are Yul Brynner as Chris, the Bald-Headed leader that still carries himself like a king. He never takes his hat off and doesn't break a sweat. Steve Mcqueen in an earlier role is memorable as well with his non-verbal acting. To me though, Eli Wallach shines as Calvera the ""heel"" with more liberty to exhibit more flair than the rest of the cast. He plays his role so good that in the end, I always root for him.

This DVD has additional features such as the making of the movie and trailers and commentary. I think what interesting that is featured in the making of portion, is the little conflict between Brynner and Mcqueen. Brynner being the real only established star and McQueen the hungry newcomer attempting to steal a scene or two. Interviews with Wallach and James Colburn are also a treat.

A remake, but a memorable one nonetheless.",1157328000,3,1266,4.572687224669603
882014,5,630442972X,"It's said that Akiro Kurosawa studied the themes of American Westerns in preparation for creating his classic THE SEVEN SAMURAI. If that is true, then John Sturges' Hollywood remake, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, is a prodigal child come home.

The Magnificent Seven are recruited by a group of Mexican villagers to protect them against the depredations of the bandit Calvera (Eli Wallach) and his gang. Wallach finds the heart of Calvera's character in just a few short scenes, being alternately cruel, ironic, and deprecating. Despite sounding a bit like a Brooklyn version of Pancho Villa, Wallach does a splendid job.

The leader of the Magnificent Seven is Chris (Yul Brynner), the quintessential ""Man in Black."" Nothing fazes Chris who remains rock steady and remote throughout the film. The rest of the cast is a veritable Who's Who of graduates from the Clenched Jaw School of Acting. Steve McQueen is Vin, a jaded, but slightly wry gunfighter who yearns for a settled life. James Coburn is Britt, laconic to the point of sphinxism, who is a dangerous as a snake with both knife and gun. Charles Bronson is Bernardo O'Reilly, stolid, deadly, and unaccountably gentle. Robert Vaughn is Lee, the Riverboat Gambler gunslinger who has secretly lost his nerve. Brad Dexter, the only unremembered actor in the cast, plays Harry Luck, avaricious but principled. And Horst Buchholz plays Chico, the Young Turk, upstart, and boy-into-man with a chip on his shoulder, who admires the rest and strives to live up to them. At first excluded from the group, Chico slowly proves his mettle, and in the end matures past his need to prove anything.

The acting quality is uniformly excellent. The implicit toughness and uniform taciturnity of the actors set a standard for Westerns that later films have never exceeded. Scored with now-legendary music by Elmer Bernstein (aka ""The Marlboro Man Theme"") and shot on location in Mexico, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN was released just as Westerns were falling into decline. In many ways, this film represents the best, but last gasp of the genre.",1148688000,5,2070,5.046783625730995

882016,5,630442972X,"I'm doing this backwards.

I'm the guy who knows that this film is based on Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"", yet saw ""A Bug's Life"" first, which is a take on THIS.

You know the story. You know the score. You know it's got Yul and McQueen, and five other guys you need to know for trivia contests.

But actually sitting down and seeing for the first time was such an unadulterated joy, I had a dumb little smile on my face for nearly two whole hours.

Here's some things I didn't know or realize:

1) All seven gunmen are terrific in their own way, but Eli Wallach is their equal as Calvera, the head bad guy.

2) The score was one of those things ""older people"" always said was ""classic"" or ""one of the greats."" It was the film score your father loved. Hearing it in it's unfettered glory showed me one thing: no matter how much I hate to admit it, Dad was right. From frame one, Elmer Bernstein's music alone straightens your spine and lifts you up. It's cliche, but it really is a separate character element in the telling of this particular tale.

3) Steve McQueen does more in a scene when he's not the focus of it. I didn't realize that until I watched the excellent documentary, but he's an absolute riot. He's ALWAYS trying to detract from somebody else's scene, fidgeting about, looking off at something. And somehow he does it in character.

4) Yul Brynner walks like some regal prince, yet clad in cowboy black. And still has a strong accent. And yes, still makes it work.

5) The screenplay is a jewel of understatement, pithy humor and curious (for a western) insight into the life of a gunman.

Being Simon Cowell honest, it's not perfect. Horst Buchholz does ""James Dean in Rebel Without A Cause"" in a few too many scenes, but he's kinda cool in most others. There are a few clunky lines here and there. Some of the Mexican actors sound like they've never acted before in their lives. The relationship between the kids and Charles Bronson is forced and hokey.

All that pales in comparison to the epic success of everything else in the film. There are dozens of classic lines and scenes, genuinely thrilling action sequences and the whole thing packs an honestly earned emotional wallop by the time the final credits run.

882017,5,630442972X,"This is a parable about people who are oppressed and seek their liberation from an organized gang. They consult an older bearded man, who tells them to get arms from across the border (where people were free to keep and bear arms). The three ambassadors wind up hiring a team of experienced gunmen to defend their town against the recurring raiders. These seven free lancers work to educate and train the townsmen in the use of firearms and fortifications. Si vis pacem parabellum.

When the raiders return these gunmen and the villagers are able to drive them away. But the raiders don't give up easily, and return for a sneak attack. The film shows the characters of the gunmen and the villagers during the lull between attacks. The price of liberty is eternal vigilance. But what of the gunmen? They live a lonely life and have a dim future; they can't settle down. The gang of raiders won't go away because they are desperate for food; they are worse off but even more dangerous. There is a surprise when the raiders capture the town and turn the tables. The message seems to be that the enemies of yesterday can become the allies of today.

One gunman says true bravery is working and raising a family, not roaming for adventure. [A rebuke of military forces?] After being forced to leave, the free lancers decide to return to avenge their loss. At first their surprise attack succeeds, but the greater force against them begins to tell. The mass uprising of the people, with clubs, shovels, and machetes, puts an end to most of the raiders. When the fighting is over, the survivors ride away. The farmers continue to work the land in an endless cycle of planting, weeding, and harvesting. There is a lot of philosophy in this action film, even if the audience doesn't recognize it.

882095,5,630442972X,"I saw this movie, first run, in 1960, in one of my neighborhood theaters...a theater that had an uncanny taste in good movies! And to this day, I'm still spellbound by the fantastic music, the casting, especially of Yul Brynner as the head honcho, and the overall dramatic effect of this landmark film.

""The Magnificent Seven"" started out as a remake of ""The Seven Samurai"" by Akira Kurasawa, a fact just about everybody who's ever Googled IMDB or read a film history article knows by heart. What you might not have known is that Yul Brynner owned the rights to make it into a western! Brynner, in fact, was slated to direct, at one point, but they got John Sturges instead. Anthony Quinn was originally slated to play Chris, Brynner's character. I really couldn't imagine this movie without Brynner playing Chris, and I thank the gods of fate manipulation that it didn't happen that way.

You all know the story, right? Chris rides around the border area searching for gunfighters to help him protect a Mexican village from a menacing group of bandits, led by Eli Wallach (Calveras), and meets up with Steve McQueen as Vin, James Coburn as Britt, Robert Vaughn as Lee, Charles Bronson as O'Reilly, Horst Bucholz as Rico and Brad Dexter as Harry. All these guys are good, with the possible exception of Robert Vaughn, who, it turns out, is the only surviving ""hero"" from the movie. His character, apparently, was shell-shocked from earlier gunfights, and is fighting demons of cowardice and inadequacy. There was always a character like this in just about every ""important"" drama of this era and the performances were almost always over the top, and thank Gawd Vaughn's is kept to a minimum. His presence in anything made after ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E"" was canceled was almost always a sure sign that the movie was a bomb. The man looks like John Derek designed by Al Hirschfeld...

Horst Bucholz, who made an international career out of playing Holden Caulfields, does his hotheaded young guy thing here in his inimtable style. Though German, Bucholz only once portrayed a German in any movies of his released here! In ""One Hour To Rama"", a movie about Gandhi's assassin, he plays a Hindu, sick and tired of British rule. In this film, he plays a young hispanic fellow who wants to join the gaggle of older men to fight the banditos. This he does, while making a fool out of himself when drunk but acquitting himself when he's sober and the chips are down. He's also the one who makes any kind of time with the young ladies of the village.

Steve McQueen does his laconic thing, with baleful stares and not much dialogue, and some of the most pointed finger counting you've ever seen as he is Brynner's first, helping to recruit the other fighters. Coburn, who, back then was often mixed up with McQueen by audiences because of their striking visual similarities, plays the knife-wielding expert, who's just as fast with a gun, named Britt. He gets almost NO lines in the film, but one of the most quoted scenes from the film, where Bucholz's Rico is amazed at a shot he made, shooting a bandito off a horse, is one that everybody remembers. As with Flint, he modestly tells Rico that he was aiming ""for the horse"".

Bronson's O'Reilly becomes a favorite of three village boys, as he is the one who teaches the village men how to shoot rifles. And then there's Brynner's Chris. As Chris, Brynner gets all the good lines in the movie...all the philosophical lines, all the good comedic lines, which McQueen or Wallach often set up for him, and nobody has the walk he has...not John Wayne, not Jim Arness, not Alan Ladd, not anybody....

If you remember there being a lot more of the score in this movie when you saw it in the theater, you're not alone. I found myself wanting to hear the main refrain played as often as possible and cursed the fact that the movie wasn't shot in glorious stereo, as this score was made for it!

One of the things that made this movie so great is the easy camaraderie between the gunslingers as they band together to help the lowly villagers. They exchange sly jokes and the stories of their lives, (or whatever they want to reveal of them,) and if more of them had survived, they would have probably become lifelong friends, but in the end, only two remained...and watching them ride off into the sunset beats Brandon De Wilde calling out to Shane any day of the week!

A true classic.",1134345600,5,4419,4.641943734015345
882096,5,630442972X,"""The Magnificent Seven"" will never qualify as one of the most meaningful westerns ever made, but it is a great deal of fun, and seems to get better with every passing year - thanks largely to its terrific cast (has there ever been any other movie with such cool screen icons as Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen?), John Sturges' snappy direction and that wonderful music score from Elmer Bernstein.

This movie is a take off on the Akira Kurosawa classic ""Seven Samurai"", which was rooted in Japan's feudal past and the clash between lowly farmers and samurai warriors. Working with the essentials from Kurosawa's film - of seven warriors coming together to defend a village of farmers from a group of bandits - Sturges fashioned a western that contained some of the most obvious cliches of the genre and yet overcame them, thanks to the fast-paced script and the sheer charisma of the cast.

No one has looked better in black in a western than Yul Brynner, and McQueen's turn is yet another epitome of cool.

Instead, they wind up with seven hired gunmen.

THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN is a Hollywood classic and arguably the best movie to come out of the western genre.

The music in this film is as recognizable as the main theme from The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. Anyway, this is a must have if you like classical cinema.

Its a remake of Seven Samurai, from Akira Kurosawa and tells a story about a mexican village that was being blackmailed by a band of forajidos (you will recognize their leader immediately). The villagers go to the US-Mexican border seeking for guns but insted of buying them they decide to hire a gunman to help them get rid of the bandits. This gunman recruits six guys with unique skills. Of the magnificent seven (MS), six were on for pride and honor, and only one was for the money.

From there on, the MS helped the villagers by training them for the final combat against the bandidos. This is not the standard western movie with nothing to offer other than gun fights: you can see a lot of ethical issues and deep thoughts that are not usual in this genre.

The video quality is good, as well as the sound.

882143,4,630442972X,"Let's see if I understand this movie.  An ""innocent"" village of farmers is terrorized by a band of 40 outlaws who periodically raid their village, steal their food and wealth, and rape their women.  Villagers then hire gunfighters to free themselves of this menace and in the end, the village is free, the outlaws are dead, and the people live in peace.

Really now, who in the world can believe that?  Surely, it was the villagers fault.  Perhaps they didn't share enough of their prosperity with the outlaws.  Maybe they had the condescending idea that working with your hands, producing your own wealth and taking care of your families was a noble pursuit.  Did they not realize how culturally inferior they made the outlaws feel?  If this isn't cultural jingoism I don't know what is.  If the villagers gained any measure of prosperity, it must have been at the expense of the outlaws.  Rather than having the parochial  idea that farming the land and taking care of their families was superior lifestyle to being an outlaw, they should have tried to understand why these men hated them so much.  Maybe if the villagers instituted some diversity training and invited the outlaws to their fiestas and got to know them better, all this violence could have been avoided.

Certainly, hiring outside mercenaries to fight for them was a breach of every international protocol.  What chance did these poor local bandits have standing up against the Magnificent Seven.  The M7 should have shown more restraint.  I think I saw at least a half-a-dozen of the banditos shot in the back. Where is the justice in that?  Shouldn't the M7 be tried for murder?  Let's get real, the poor bandit was just trying to flee for his life.  No verbal warnings, no warning shots, just a bullet in the back.  Magnificent Seven- no way.

It highlights the launching of Brynner, Bronson and McQueen's stars in a story of seven down on their luck gunslingers banding together to protect a small village from a group of bandits.

The movie fell flat twice, perhaps because I had seen the Seven Samurai first:

- The characters lacked the emotional intensity of the original seven.

- The conflict of Gunslingers versus Farmers did not play out nearly as well as Samurai versus Farmers.  It seemed very forced, and should have either been left out or adapted.

In the end I felt this is a poor imitation.  I'll grant that I might have felt differently if I watched this one first.  Although it has stood the test of time, I'd have a hard time giving it the fifth star when I'd prefer a Clint Eastwood movie to the sequel.",1113696000,2,884,4.515723270440252

882220,3,630442972X,"The Magnificent Seven, a Western remake of Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, is a good movie, but hardly the classic that many people would make it out to be. The simplistic plot delivers exactly what it should, but the film falls short in its character development, possibly because of the limits of a 2-hour running time.

A small early 1900s Mexican farming village has been pillaged for years by a group of bandits lead by a man named Calvera (Eli Wallach). When the bandits come through, the villagers are left with hardly enough food to feed half of them; but since they are a group of farmers, they have no way of protecting themselves from Calvera and his men. After consulting the village elder, they decide to look for a group of gunfighters to protect them.

Enter Chris Adams (Yul Brynner), a drifter through the plains of the Old West, with nothing to lose, and not much to gain except respect for himself. Three representatives from the village seek his help, and, having nothing better on his plate at the moment, he agrees and assembles a group of seven men to protect the village.

The cast is a veritable who's who of 1960s tough guy actors: Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, and James Coburn among others. All of these men can act, but there's just not enough time to give full weight to all seven of the gunfighters, and the film feels incomplete because of this.

Also, The Magnificent Seven has not aged particularly well since its initial release almost 45 years ago. It's hard to believe that around the turn of the century in a small farming village in Mexico, all of the people would be bilingual, and not only that, but some of them speak English so well that the only way we can tell that they are supposed to be Mexican is by their bodily characteristics.

Of course, any discussion of The Magnificent Seven is not complete without mentioning Elmer Bernstein's legendary score. It is the true star of the film, and it does not disappoint at all. All of this is not to say that the film does not have its merits - it's a very enjoyable popcorn-type movie - but, for me, it does not live up to its lofty billing.",1110153600,2,2138,4.557291666666667

A band of seven gunfighters, led by Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen, comes to the aid of a poor, Mexican village, constantly under attack by a gang of vicious gang of Bandits, led by Eli Wallach.

Perhaps most memorable as being the first REAL big film for such stars as McQueen, James Coburn, and Charles Bronson. Great action and of course the famous score by Elmer Bernstein.

The sub-plots of the making of the movie include these big names, particlarly McQueen and Brynner constantly trying to one up wach other with background histrionics.

882222,5,630442972X,"When I was a kid my favorite Western was ""High Noon"" followed closely by ""The Magnificent Seven"".  Somehow I knew, even when I was young, that the former was a quality production while the latter was of a somewhat lesser standard.  However, I never let that keep me from enjoying it.  What appealed to me then and now was the level of action throughout the movie.  Most Westerns of this quality have either too little or too much action.  The ones with lesser action often lack the quality of drama to make them enjoyable.  The ones with too much action often lack a meaningful story to go along with the action.  ""The Magnificent Seven"" was able to take a workable story (adapted from Kurasawa's ""Seven Samurai"") and include a sustained and engrossing level of action to rise above the standard ""B"" Western.

The acting is pretty good throughout ""The Magnificent Seven"".  The main actors, Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, and Eli Wallach were either already great actors or, in the case of McQueen, on their way to becoming one.  The lessor roles saw the likes of upcoming actors Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and Robert Vaughn.  Horst Buchholz was supposed to have a big career ahead of him.  I remember him in ""One Two Three"" but I guess the rest of his career must have taken off in Germany.  The hard one to remember is Brad Dexter.

If you're not familiar with the story, it tells of seven out of work gunslingers who take the job of defending a small Mexican village against their annual attack from Eli Wallach's roving band of outlaws.  The seven work for beans (literally) and gradually bond to the villagers and their struggle.  It's the story of nobel sacrifice and well told by director John Sturges.  It may not qualify as cinematic artistic achievement but it is exciting to watch.

I have enjoyed ""Seven Samurai"".  It is one of the great movies of all time.  It warrents the concentration necessary to follow the subtitles and appreciate what co-mingled talent in writing, directing, acting and cinematography can achieve.

Many of the scenes seem to be choreographed, almost like ballet, with the actors performing stylized movements, in set pieces, reminiscent of Eisenstein's films. Heads move in unison, or in sequence; the actors are carefully placed in the framework; they move almost like dancers, so that the whole film has a rhythmic, formal quality which, imho, makes it almost unique, and especially memorable. Many of the scenes are unforgettably iconic: Bronson chopping wood; Robert Vaughn catching his one fly, and sliding down with his mouth against the adobe wall; Brynner coming from nowhere, back there, and heading nowhere, forward. The dialogue is also admirably laconic: ""the worst""; ""haw, haw, haw""; ""you lost""; ""no enemies --- alive""; ""Florrie won't believe this""; ""time was I'd have caught all three""; ""the farmers always win"". As remarked in the very interesting special features section, the themes are timeless, and given outstanding expression in this drama. The world divides into farmers and cowboys, classic and romantic, ancient and modern; winners and losers. Romance = death and loss; the plodding peasant survives, and carries on. Like Bronson says, it may be braver to accept responsibility, and carry the burden. I have to agree, however, with the reviewer who noted that the Buchholz character is incredibly irritating, throughout.

a couple of hired gunslingers asked to help
a couple of Mexican farmers get their village
back from the control of an evil and bloodthirsty
bandit named Calvera. (Eli Wallach).

us the story of how the village is terrorized by
this evil bandit, and from their it just the
great exploits of the 7 gunslingers who are brought
together to fight for the justice of the
Mexican people.
Yul Brenner, and Steve McQueen play Chris and Vin, a couple of honorable but tough gunmen who don't
take any crap from anyone.

They are riding their horse carriage through
a western town full of goons that want to kill
the.
As they ride across this town, they from all angles
kill the bad guys who try to get them from
windows, horses and other places.
Eventually their great exploits get the exploits
of the Mexican farmers.
The Mexican farmers tell their tale of the bandits
who are destroying their village and leaving their
families hungry.
So Chris goes on his quest to gather more
skilled gunslingers to get these bandits.
This other great gunslingers consists of Charles Bronson and Robert Vaughn.
What I love about this movie, besides the great
musical score is that their is a story about all
the gunslingers. They all come from different
backgrounds and have their own skills to bring
to the table come game time.
""It's only a matter of handling a gun, it's no
big deal"" -This great line by Chris (Yul Brenner)
shows the cool and modest demeanor that the
good hearted gunslingers have.

rare interviews with Steve McQueen, Eli Wallach

Or perhaps it's because I cannot -- repeat, cannot -- accept Yul Brenner as a cowboy.  Or maybe it's just the soundtrack that turned me off, which sounds even worse in its digital reincarnation.  The photography is a far cry from the original Oriental monochrome shot with Nikon lenses, and the actors and characters just don't have the stature of the original Samurai's.

And then its on...
This remake of Seven Samurai did for westerns what its predecessor did in the samurai arena. It crafted a legendary tale of men and weapons as they go off to fight the ""good"" fight for the people. The Magnificent Seven pays homage to Seven Samurai in many scenes, too, recreating some of those notable characters and some of those climactic scenes where they can be easily recognized. I personally liked that touch, finding Seven Samurai to be something well worth mentioning in many a genre of filmmaking. That said, this movie only takes from Seven Samurai in some aspects and fills-in-the-blanks the way it wants to in others, forging its own celluloid destiny. Where the first is overcast in somewhat grounded themes, The Magnificent Seven becomes more of a morality tale and makes its own mark by taking an idea and purifying it, producing more of an issue sheathed in ""good vs. bad"" than one beset with strong undercurrents. While that would have been a detractor from Seven Samurai, it worked really well in The Magnificent Seven and let the telling becomes one of heroics and what goes into motivating ""men.""
Not only is the creation of the tale done well in the aspects of filming, but the acting accents it in memorable ways. Steve McQueen, Eli Wallach, James Coburn, and Charles Bronson come together with other talented performers and give their characters depth as the movie moves across that ""save the farmers"" frontier. This leads to romance with a farmer's daughter, the way a man sees death after hundreds have died before him, what bravery amounts to, and countless other themes birthed by the way those individual gunfighters are showcased.

882361,4,630442972X,"Nowadays most everyone knows who Kurosawa was and has seen his ""Seven Samurai"".  This was not the case in 1960.  ""The Magnificent Seven"" was offered as an adaptation of a great Japanese film.  The producers made it a western and a pretty good one at that.
This movie is one of the last of the classic westerns before Clint Eastwood and company changed the form into something else.  In this movie there are heroes without irony or grafted in psychological complications.  It is true that these heroes aren't saints, but they aren't basket cases either and they do rise to occasion.
In adapting the story to a Hollywood Western and few things had to change.  Since the cowboys are gun fighters rather than samurai the kind of fighting is different and changes the story a bit.  Since gun fighters didn't have the same formal hierarchy or history as a samurai, other changes had to be made.
Since the movie was shot in Mexico, the censors didn't want the peasants to be presented as anything but clean and noble, and that caused some other changes in the story.  And the sword fighter became a knife fighter (James Coburn).  The knife is kind of cool and everyone remembers it, but it doesn't have the same majesty or magic as a sword.  But who fought with a sword in the west?
Another big difference is that this is a Hollywood movie and adheres to the two-hour length pretty closely.  Kurosawa's movie is 3 hrs and 20 mins.  So, much of the character development of the seven heroes has to be left out.  They are all there and function similarly to their counterparts in ""Seven Samurai"", but other than Yul Brynner, they really don't get many lines or much screen time.
Eli Wallach is fabulous as the villain Calvera and Steve McQueen is at his scene stealing best.  The weirdest casting choice was the young romantic lead being given to Horst Buchholz from Germany.  He does a good job with the role, however.
The disk has a documentary on the making of the movie as well as audio commentaries and the theatrical trailers.  Visually, it is a good transfer and a very pleasing disk.  But see ""Seven Samurai"" for an even richer experience!",1058745600,,2138,4.598944591029023

A group of highly skilled cowboys - mercenaries, really - take a job in a sleepy Mexican town to oust a bandit who raids the villagers regularly.  The people are farmers with no combat skill.  The 7 cowboys (an unbelievable cast which I won't list yet again) teach the people HOW to fight.  They then face the hoard of bandits at the movie's pinnacle, culminating in a shoot 'em up scene of high dramatic integrity.

1. Chris: A leader, perhaps a former soldier, who has encountered danger before and gained a degree of mastery over his emotions in dangerous situation.
2. Vin: A capable man with a gun, perhaps a one time cowboy. He seems to be comfortable working as a loner but clearly would like to one day settle down.
3. Chico: The youngest of the Seven and most inexperienced. He wants to shed his farming past and attempts through acts of bravado to persuade others and himself that he is a gunfighter at heart.
4. Bernardo (Bronson): A strong solitary man that in many ways resembles Chris although not displaying the desire to lead. In many ways he is the most interesting character. He has made quite a bit of money in the past even though he is now broke. The attention he gives to the local village children and the gift he gives a village girl hint at the idea that while he is good at gunfighting he knows that it is a good family life that is important.
5. Lee (Vaughn): The most difficult character to relate to. He appears to be a gunman who in the past was cocky, arrogant and self assured but now after experiencing life on the run now doubts himself. He wants to do the right thing but finds it difficult to step up to the plate when it's his turn.
6. Britt (Coburn): A loner who is unequaled in a gun or knife fight. A man whose motives remain his own.
7. Harry (Dexter): A good man to have in a fight but one who lets greed cloud his every decision. It would seem that Harry is one of those individuals who is always one step away from gaining riches but somehow never gains them.
The leader of the bandits is Calvera (Walsh) who is not an unlikeable fellow. He appears to believe that it is his job to steal so that he can support himself and his men. For him it is only a job, not unlike the farmers who work the land to provide for their families. He has what can almost be describes as a code of ethics for those who make their living with guns. This code of ethics is evident in the way he treats the Magnificent Seven towards the end of the film. However, given the films ending, this code does not seem to be shared by the Magnificent Seven
While many people may view this film as a western action film I think there is quite a bit of underlying humanity and character depth woven into the story. It is these underlying characteristics that distinguish it from the average western action flick and have helped to make this film as popular as it is.
The DVD offers what every DVD should, a commentary with both some of the actors and some of the production staff.  A behind the scenes documentary and two trailers.  While some may find the picture not that great I found it be a great improvement over the VHS widescreen version I purchased earlier on VHS.  Lastly,during the past 7 months 3 more of the Magnifecent Seven have died.  The only two remaining are Robert Vaughn (Lee) and Charles Bronson (Bernardo).  Eli Walsh (Calvera) is also still alive.  Fans of both the Magnifect Seven and James Coburn, who died last November, will appreciate his participation in the documentary and commentary.",1054166400,8,3644,4.399109792284866
882364,5,630442972X,"The Magnificent Seven belongs up there with Shane and the Wild Bunch as one of the best westerns of all-time.  Borrowing the story from Akira Kurosawa, the Magnificent Seven tells the story of seven gunman hired to protect a poor Mexican farming village from marauding bandits.  This is an excellent movie with a great cast.  The movie never stops rolling with great action, interesting characters, and quick dialogue througout.  It will keep you in your seat throughout.
 Part of the reason people love this movie so much is the wonderful cast put together.  Yul Brynner takes the leading role of Chris, the gunman in black, with Steve McQueen taking the part of his right hand man.  Joining them are Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Robert Vaughan, Brad Dexter, and Horst Bucholz.  To put this kind of cast together today would be unheard of.  If that was not enough, Eli Wallach takes the role of the lead bandit Calvera.  At times, you hate him and other times you can't help but like him.  I couldn't write a review without mentioning Elmer Bernstein's great score that everyone everywhere has probably heard at some time or another.  The DVD gives an excellent widescreen presentation that looks a little cleaned up from the VHS, several theatrical trailers, picture gallery, and a very informative documentary about the making of the movie.  This is one of those true western classics that can be watched over and over again.  Do not miss this great movie!",1053561600,2,1461,4.862348178137652
882365,3,630442972X,"""The Magnificent Seven"" is based on the Japanese movie, ""Seventh Samari"".  The updating and transmutation of the original premise - that of seven desperados out to avenge a ruthless cutthroat's stronghold on a poor community - is, for once in the business of remaking movies, totally justified.  Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen star as two of the seven with character actor, Eli Walsh doing a bang-up job of being the villain.  This is one thrilling western and a film that deserves a much better transfer than the one it currently has received on DVD.
MGM Home Entertainment gives us a tired, worn print with faded colors and a barrage of age related blemishes - all this, while calling the disc a ""Special Edition"".  I'd hate to see what their standard issues look like.  Oops!  I've seen them and they're nothing to write home about!  But back to this DVD.
Colors can be rich and nicely balanced at times.  However, most of the movie's color scheme has suffered from the natural ravages of time.  Blacks are weak.  Browns, beiges and light grays all appear to have the same muddy texture.  Reds are slightly orange and flesh tones are not very natural.  There's a considerable amount of edge enhancement and fine detail shimmering throughout.  Chips, scratches, dirt and tears in the original print are evident throughout.  The audio is stereo but feebly so with a forward sounding characteristic that is not terribly engaging.  Special effects sound strident.  The music is generally well represented.
EXTRAS: A making-of that falls somewhere short of a full fledged documentary but too long to be considered a featurette.  A theatrical trailer and an audio commentary too.
The menu for this film is pretty bad - suffering from excessive edge enhancement and aliasing problems.  Why bother?
Bottom line: If you're a fan - get it.  It won't break you. Just don't expect that the term ""Special Edition"" means the film has been given any special treatment on DVD!",1050969600,7,1962,4.890909090909091
882366,3,630442972X,"The story begins with a group of Mexican villagers being terrorized by an outlaw named Calvera, played with vigor by Eli Wallach. Calvera and his band of forty thieves steal precious food and supplies from the poor farmers, who barely have enough left to feed their families. To the credit of the film, these are not cardboard characters. They are gentle souls that are pushed to their limits and demonstrate moral courage and wisdom. The beleaguered villagers seek the help of a courageous drifter named Chris, competently played by Yul Brynner. After reluctantly accepting to help the farmers, seasoned gunslinger assembles a group of unemployed professional gunmen and adventurers. Each one of these men has their reasons for joining the fight against Calvera. However, the farmers can only pay each of their guardians the ridiculous sum of twenty-dollars, which as McQueen's character points out, ""Would barely pay for my bullets"". The small band of gunfighters exhibits bravery and commitment that galvanizes the village into a formidable fighting force. In a climatic fight sequence, the highly outnumbered seven pay a high price in blood to dispatch the evil Calvera. I have a soft spot in my heart for this film. Though not the greatest western ever made, John Sturges did a fine job Americanizing Akira Kurosawa's macho masterpiece, ""The Seven Samurai"". It was made in 1960 at the end of the studio system era and is not as gritty as later westerns from this tumultuous decade. Such films as ""The Wild Bunch"" and ""A Fistful of Dollars"" would more fully realize the character of the anti-hero. That being said, two of the film actors starring in this picture turned in prototype performances for the anti-hero. One was Steve McQueen as Vin, the empathetic gunslinger, who is as quick with an analogy as he is with his peacemaker. McQueen steals nearly every scene he is in with his quirky physical gestures and effortless acting. The other notable performance is from the late James Coburn, who plays the inscrutable loner Britt. His character is lightening fast with a pistol; but in a particularly entertaining sequence, he outdraws another aspiring gunslinger armed only with his switchblade knife. As an actor, Coburn had few lines of dialogue but made the most of them and filmgoers couldn't take their eyes off of him. Charles Bronson, who plays Bernardo O'Reilly, the crusty gunfighter with the soft underbelly, ably supports these two breakthrough performers. Finally, Elmer Berstein provides one of the best film soundtracks ever written. ""The Magnificent Seven"" is solid western film fare, where the line between good and evil is clearly defined and the heroes fight with altruistic purpose.",1037750400,,2709,5.1173814898419865
882367,5,630442972X,"The Magnificent Seven (Michael Biehn version) is the best I have seen as far as westerns go in a very long time.  An ex-Confederate officer and his army come upon an Indian village, terrorize them and then threaten to return in a few days for gold they believe the villagers to possess.  Two of the villagers go to the nearest town to seek/hire men to help them.  What I love about this movie are the relationships that developed between the characters, Chris and Vin, Buck and JD, Nathan and Josiah, Chris and Ezra.  The movie also conveyed with a few words, their actions or even a look each character's personality, what type of a man each character is, what their dreams are, what haunts them, etc.  It has action (some very violent scenes), a little romance, some comedy, a villian of course, but most of all, seven men who become heroes.  Michael Biehn's portrayal of Chris Larabee as the leader of this group of men is right on the money.  Dale Midkiff is a delight to watch.  Eric Close, Anthony Starke, Andrew Korvit, Ron Perlman and Rick Worthy are all wonderful in their portrayal of their individual characters.  These seven actors' portrayal of their characters are a great ensemble and complement one another, while at the same time they are also very unique and diverse.  I highly recommend this movie.  You will not be disappointed.",1034553600,17,1348,4.693617021276595
882368,5,630442972X,"Yul Brynner, back in the late 1950's, wanted to direct an American version of the SEVEN SAMURAI, as an western. So he bought up the movie rights. He wanted to cast Anthony Quinn in the lead, as Chris. Brynner had been directed by Quinn in the remake of THE BUCCANEER. Quinn would have been great as Chris, the leader of the Seven; and what a different film it would have been. But, alas, Brynner himself took the part, and put his own stamp of individuality on it. He walked like a cross between a panther and a ballet dancer; light on the balls of his feet. Ironically, as an actor, he was slow on the draw, and not used to Westerns. But artistically, this was never apparent in the finished film.
Many of the Seven's actors had seen the Kurosawa film, and they were very excited about transferring it to the American West. Eli Wallach, as Calvera, in just a few short scenes, found both the humor and the cruelty in the bandit chieftan. His accent and speech pattern were fairly authentic; more so certainly than the young German actor, Horst Buchholz, endeavoring to find a southwestern/Texan/Mexican drawl. Director, John Sturges, had great hopes for Horst; the camera loved him. But it was the trio of studs, Steve McQueen as Vin, Charles Bronson as O'Reilly, and James Coburn as Britt, that dominated the frame.
Steve McQueen, wearing skin-tight leather stovepipe chaps, spent a lot of time finding ways to upstage Yul Brynner. There was a rumor that he would have preferred playing Chico, the Buchholz character. McQueen's manic physical performance, lightning fast with a pistol and a quip, seemed to work well for him, and it gave him more than his share of focus. His Vin emerged as lethal, lean, and hungry; yet weary of the gunfighter's plight, and envious of the simplicity and the honor of the peasants fighting for their families and their homes.
James Coburn, as Britt, was laconic and dangerous, and living on the edge of his blade; competing mostly with himself for the next big thrill. Coburn got the part he wanted, and though he was given minimal dialogue, his deliveries were classic. This set the mold for his future career.
Charles Bronson as Bernardo O'Reilly, half-Irish, half Mexican, was solid as a rock; an experienced stone killer, and yet still a soft touch for the children of the village. His death scene touched us. He found the pulse of his character, and he was both dangerous and decent.
Robert Vaughn, as Lee, seemed uncomfortable and lost. His part had been rewritten, and expanded for him. Yet he seemed ill-suited for the part, and the genre. Even his costume seemed ill-fitting. Part of the problem was that his characters' inability to participate in the first couple of firefights left us with little sympathy for him. Later then, in his scene with the peasants, in which he admitted his fear, the emotions seemed forced and poorly conceived. His last moment heroics and death did little to balance the scales.
Brad Dexter was nearly invisible. He is the one actor in trivia games no one can remember. His character, Harry Luck, with twice the dialogue as Coburn, paled in comparison. Part of it was Dexter himself. He was a bland, middle-of-the-road, B-Movie heavy, and it was odd to cast him, and thrust him in amongst all of those young turks. He did a credible job, but he was completely outshined by the future super stars.
Vladimir Sokoloff, as the village's ""old man"", gave such a wonderful and touching performance, one did not realize the actor was not Latino. Like Eli Wallach, his talent as an actor transcended ethnic boundaries.
John Sturges, a veteran director of westerns, found just the right balance of action and character. Mexican farmers substituted fine for the original Japanese farmers. And brigands, or bandits, are cut from the same nasty mold no matter what the era, or geography. Kurosawa's classic runs like 3 hours in length, and it gave us much more in-depth character development; so that when these samurai began to die, we cared about them. In 1959, when SEVEN was filmed, three hour westerns were a non-existant species. Elmer Bernstein's musical score was revolutionary, and its pounding stacatto beat has become one of the most recognized pieces of music ever created for film.
This western, always listed in the top 50 best westerns, is a must-see. And the DVD version, in widescreen, is crisp and clear and colorful, and it helps us to recapture that magical feeling we had the first time we saw this film in a movie theatre.",1033603200,376,4507,4.786906290115533

882370,5,630442972X,"Not everyone is a fan of the Western, but after watching this movie, I would highly recommend making the exception to see this film.  Contrary to Clint Eastwoods Unforgiven, this film shows the gunslinger with his own since of honor even when his way of life is on the wane.
A small, Mexican farming village is being tormented by a bandito with his small army of about forty men.  After being raided, the village men decide to cross the border and buy guns to defend themselves.
In America, the village committee sees a couple of gunslingers stand up to drive a coffin to the local cemetery.  The townfolk were prepared to stop them due to the dead mans race.  Rather than do this for money, the gunslingers due it for the challenge and because it is right.  These are the men the villagers want.
The next chunk of the movie is the recruiting of gunslingers.  None of them seem to fit into this new world; for example, Charles Bronsons character is chopping wood to earn his breakfast whereas he used to get hundreds of dollars for gunslinging jobs.
The last part of the movie is the seven gunslingers helping to train the villagers and to fight with them.  They could leave, but their unwritten code requires them to continue until the job is done.
You have to see this movie at least once.",1027296000,,1291,4.515021459227468
882448,5,630442972X,"One of the great westerns of all time.  Some of the best dialogue ever recorded.  Each actors brings something unique to the table and adds to this film.  Yul Brynner, king of Siam and Pharoh of Egypt, leads six men into Mexico to fight a band of 40 bandits.  Steve McQueen brings his laid back style and looks for love, while Bernardo Charles Bronsan wins the heart of children.  James Coburn is the man of action, ""fastest with gun or knife"" while Robert Vaughn is the desterter hiding on the battle field.  A young Horst as Chico (no, I'm not joking) is the young gun wanttobe, while Brad Dexter is the gun for hire.  A gold-toothed Eli Wallach does a great job as a villian, by not trying to be one.  John Sturges had a unique touch to handling a large cast.  Elmer Berstein delivers the screen's most rousing score that helped Marlboro sell cigarettes.
DVD Features:  A good documentary with interviews with some of the cast.  Steve Mcqueen is sorely missed, but his ex wife tells a few tales along with Yul's exwife.

882453,4,630442972X,"The Movie:  The Magnificent Seven is truly the most timeless of any Western ever made.  I won't go into too much detail about the film's plot, except to say that it was a unique work amoung westerns, and very entertaining.  Not only did this movie make its mark on other filmmakers at the time, but it collected and cataloged many standard movie items you see in movies made 20 years before AND after it.  You got the innocence and clarity of older westerns - the perfectly clean costumes and sweeping music, and that obvious contrast between outdoor and stage shots.  Action scenes were quick and unfocused (typical western stuff), and we are treated with that strange Hollywood way of shooting guns, where the actors don't aim at all.  Yul Brynner gives a very traditional, stoic performance, hardly moving a muscle for any of his scenes.  Many of the actors gave old-style, John Wayne-inspired performances, in which they stand perfectly still and read their lines with a straight face and dead earnesty.  When they finally move, they seem to explode into action.
Contrast this with the fidgetting and fussing of Steve McQueen's much more human performance, and you can almost see how movies will change entirely in the next 15 years.  Eli Wallach's bandit villian is a perfectly likeable fellow, while some of the heroes are hunted and greedy.  The first scenes show the heroes confronting racism - in 1960!  The Magnificent Seven was one of the first movies made outside of the studio system, and it shows.  The entire supporting cast is played by Mexican actors who are willing -and allowed- to portray their characters in a realistic, human light.  Perhaps the best reason to watch this movie is to prepare yourself for the film that inspired it - Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai, one of the greatest movies of all time, from -any- country or genre.
The DVD:  The visual quality is only average.  The print is stratched and grainy, and when a transition shot approaches, the image becomes even worse!  The sound is faithful to the original movie, but nothing to show-off your stereo with.  The documentary is the best extra, as it lovingly explores the history of the movie, the legal troubles of its early creation, the friendly rivalry of the Seven actors on the set, and the strange relationship that Eli Wallach had with his band of bandits.  There is also a commentary track, but much of the information in this track is presented more clearly in the documentary.

As most any cinema fan knows, TMS was based on Akira Kurosawa's landmark ""The Seven Samurai"", albeit with a shift in setting from feudal Japan to Mexico of the old west...and six guns replacing samurai swords.
This excellent release on DVD hosts a plethora of extra features with an accompanying documentary and commentary by dapper James Coburn and western bad guy Eli Wallach ( After Wallach's cold blooded portrayal of bandit leader Calvera in TMS, Sergio Leone cast him a couple of years later as the cunning gunman Tuco in ""The Good, The Bad & The Ugly"". Prior to making TMS, Wallach had never ridden a horse in his life ! )
Director John Sturges showed why he is a class act at well paced dramas with his great directorial style on TMS, and Elmer Bernstein's oh so catchy signature score falls right in line with the mood of the script. Bryner & McQueen are outstanding as Chris and Vin, (love that opening sequence with the hearse and a panicky Whit Bissell ) with dynamic support from a youthful Charles Bronson, nervy Robert Vaughn, knife throwing James Coburn, money hungry Brad Dexter and the hot headed farmer-turned-gunslinger Horst Bucholz !!

Every repeat viewing leaves me with the same feelings all over again; good CAN triumph over evil, even though the good may at first appear to take ominous forms, as in this wonderfully told and superbly acted film.  The sensitivity to the farmer's plight and the selflessness displayed as the seven defend the farmers and their poor village and defeat the marauding force headed by Calvera are an inspiration to all those who are not able or capable of defending themselves against evil.

We ar now much more cynical - at least pretend to be. The basic ingredients are there, but it just does not work for me. Its too messy, noisy and violent and the Seven are not interesting as persons. It is hard to understand, what those who like it, are seeing. My only consolation that the Finnish paper I read gave it exactly the same rating. So, if there are Finns or Scandinavians, do not buy it. It's not for your mentality. If you think, like me that best westerns were made 1940's and 1950's, do not buy it.",1000857600,,688,4.3

Given the film's age, the DVD transfer is sharp and I thought the mono sound was reasonably crisp (other reviewers seem to disagree on that point, however). The extras include a documentary on the film which I found terrific: Most amusing is a story about the scene that was shot first, that of the seven riding over a creek with Yul in the lead. During rehearsal, they all did the scene 'straight' but in the actual cut, several of the actors did dramatic things (like swooping down with their hat to fetch some water from the creek) in order to draw attention to themselves in this ensemble cast. What hams! The back story, along those same lines, of the competition between Steve McQueen and Yul Brenner was interesting as was the legal ramblings that were needed just to get the movie made (an actor's strike, competing story rights, a ticked-off Anthony Quinn (who was originally cast in the Brenner role), and a mad screen writer all had to be overcome). The movie also has an audio commentary by Eli Wallach, James Coburn and Walter Mirisch which I look forward to hearing, but haven't done so yet. Given the price, these are quality extras!

882529,5,630442972X,"MGM has just released the DVD of ""The Magnificent Seven"", perhaps the very last of an epoch of classic westerns. Poignant and sad, yet thrilling and action-filled, this cinema classic became a model for 100 action flicks to come. It's an early peek at the emerging movie anti-hero of the 60's and the 70's.  An embattled farming village in Northern Mexico hires an unemployed gunslinger from Dodge City.  Chris, played by Yul Brynner, recruits six more guns and takes a bloody stand against forty invading banditos. The film opened in 1960 to mild reviews.  It was sent off to Europe, where it exploded with positive response.  ""The Seven"" returned to the U.S. to wide acclaim, and as co-star James Coburn says in the documentary, ""It's been playing ever since..."" John Sturges filmed ""Bad Day at Black Rock"", ""Gunfight at the OK Corral"", and ""The Great Escape"", but history confirms that the meticulous out-door director achieved his artistic peak with this star-studded spectacle, featuring Elmer Bernstein's now classic theme. The film was followed by 3 sequels and a TV show that ran for 2 years. The DVD sound dialogue is a bit muted. The anamorphic 16:9 picture is perhaps the clearest ever, though you'll see some grain fallout during the lap dissolves. An audio commentary track with producer Walter Mirisch and several actors comes with 2 trailers and photos from the actual shoot and cast party.  The real jewel of this new DVD is a brand new 46-minute documentary featuring interviews with all the major surviving stars, except Charles Bronson, who just turned 80. Charles Coburn, Eli Wallach, and Robert Vaughn re-live the adventures of filming this epic on location in Cuernavaca, Mexico. Amusing tales of future super-star Steve McQueen are revealed by his ex-wife. McQueen intentionally crashed his sports car to leave his TV series, ""Wanted Dead or Alive"", and join the cast of ""Seven"". Yul Brynner so enjoyed his all-black gunfighter attire that he repeated the same exact outfit in at least 4 more movies. Yul Brynner died of lung cancer in 1985. Steve McQueen died of cancer in 1980. Thanks to this timeless and valuable DVD, ""The Magnificent Seven"" may never die. After the raging battle ends, Brynner's character looks down on newly dug graves for the brave villagers.  ""We didn't do it..""he says. ""Only the farmers win. We never win...""",997228800,63,2358,4.987277353689567

We did know who Yul Brynner was, we all fell in love with him years before in King and I, and the Ten Commandments! We were all in doubt then about how he would fit into a Western with no hair!

The ""good guys"" are the poor Mexican farmers in their little village being bullied and controlled by the ""bad guys"", a small army of Mexican Desperados.  The Farmers are desperately needing help to rid themselves of these Banditos who steal all their food at the end of the farmers yearly harvest, leaving very little for the villagers to eat.  They decide that this is the last ""straw"" and the best way to get rid of their enemy is to hire gunslingers.  With very little cash to offer, the cash they do offer is all that they have.  They  hire Well-known Gunslinger, Chris (Yul Brynner), who sympathizes with the farmers, and also admires their determination, Chris, having a way with words as well as guns, decides to help them by rounding up as many extra gunslingers that he can.  With little to offer but a chance to redeem themselves by helping out these poor but determined farmers.  So it comes down to the ""bad guys"" against the ""badder gunslingers"".

In its western adaption of the SEVEN SAMURAI it works better that the movie it adapts.  Not becasue it is a better movie per-se, that  would be a hard case to make (impossible in terms of sheer spectacle.  Its strength in comparison is based on the setting and time.  The SEVEN SAMURAI is set during a time when the SAMURAI tradition was alive, strong and would be for centuries more.  The MAGNIFICENT SEVEN works even better because these men see their gunfighting days and ways drawing to a close.  Much like THE SHOOTIST the end of a way of life and the begining of a new one is the catalyst here.  Also like THE SHOOTEST, you see Chico (HORST BUCHHORZ)enamored by the same non-reality that Gillom (RON HOWARD)does.  All of the characters have their appeal and Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen make it work.  Their first scene together is worth the picture alone.  Big names are good but the big performances make it better.  All of them are underplayed but not under acted.  It started a series of movies which never reached the level of the first, but thats not the purpose of a movie.

And a crackerjack one it is as well, as coolly charismatic gunfighter Chris (Yul Brynner) puts together a gang of laconic silent types to defend a Mexican peasant village from raiding banditos. Cool is the operative word to describe The Magnificent Seven - from the moment the seemingly miscast Yul Brynner steps on screen to disarm your expectations with impressively understated menace, to the inevitably heroic bloodbath at the end. Steve McQueen and James Coburn reinforce the cool, playing their characters with a relaxed deliberateness that underlines the most important audience impression - these men are dangerous. McQueen and Brynner's classic hearse ride to the cemetery after the beginning - the first time their characters ever meet - is the kind of moment that encapsulates the heroic appeal of Westerns, on a par with the final walk of Peckinpah's Wild Bunch. Add to the mix THE quintessential Western score, and you have the perfect concoction to please any lover of intelligent, fast-moving action.

882646,4,630442972X,"""The Magnificent Seven"" thunders back onto video with a special edition DVD from MGM. The Saturday afternoon TV favorite regains much of its original sweep with a 2.35:1 widescreen presentation that makes it easier for viewers to take in the large cast of stars and soon-to-be-stars. The color transfer is an improvement on past video efforts, although some age spots are in evidence. The mono sound comes through with plenty of muscle, but the 5.1 mix fails to justify its existence with almost no activity to the rear speakers. (Beware the jaw-dropping volume difference between the menu and film.) Elmer Bernstein's iconic score gets the star treatment it deserves throughout. The 1960 remake of Akira Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"" stars Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen, with Eli Wallach as the bandit king undone by his belief in honor among dangerous men. Brynner turns in a stand-up performance as Chris, the Christ-figure leader, but it's Wallach who shows the boys how it's done via a magnificent performance laden with grease and bluster. A first-rate 46-minute documentary (in widescreen) begins with the story of how Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"" electrified  Hollywood professionals when it hit town in 1956. Brynner, in file footage, brags of how he immediately grabbed the rights for a remake, but it was in fact writer-producer Lou Morheim who imported the tale for a mere $250. As the project got under way, Morheim was relegated to associate producer, with studio favorite Walter Mirisch taking the reins. Production was rushed, with the specter of a Hollywood strike riding hard on the project's heels. The docu aptly makes the case that ""Magnificent Seven"" was a transitional work from the classic age of westerns to the grim, gory works of Sergio Leone and Sam Peckinpah.",990144000,,1783,5.1271477663230245

Just starting the DVD up is a rush that raises the excitement level for the film, as the opening menu kicks off in stirring fashion with Bernstein's rousing score and selected clips from the film.
The movie transfer seems to be ok.  I wished it could have been clearer and more crisp, but I am not sure if that was even possible.  As it was, the picture was definitely leaps and bounds better than anything you'll find on VHS.  The DVD extras are wonderful, too, featuring movie trailers (including an infamously tacky one that provided me with my subject header), talent bios, audio commentary, and best of all a retrospective documentary featuring most of the cast and crew involved.  The backdrop of the documentary is that you had a number of young stars (Horst Buccholz, Charles Bronson, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, and Robert Vaughn) who were trying to outdo each other in drawing notice in this film, and the retrospect provides some delicious 20/20 hindsight to the whole thing.
The movie itself is a wonderful adaptation of Kurosawa's ""The Seven Samurai"", which itself was influenced heavily by Kurosawa's fascination with the Western genre and in particular John Ford.  ""The Magnificent Seven"" adroitly adapts the themes of Kurosawa's film, especially the overarcing theme of what it means to be a warrior or, by this film's definition, a cowboy.

I was very enthusiastic about watching this new special edition DVD of this wonderful film, so I have to say sadly that I was just a bit disappointed. The film has not really been remastered, and thus, the image is full of artifacts displaying the movie's age. It's not unusual for a movie over forty years old to look this way, but it's disappointing nonetheless. The colors are solid, and the widescreen framing gives us the entire picture, all to the good. But those specks and that dirt that keep coming with relentless consistency occasionally ruin the wonderful screen compositions.
The sound is even more disappointing. Though being advertised as remastered Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, it's really basically mono. In addition, there is virtually no bass in the sound mix, so the superb Elmer Bernstein score, one of the true classics in film music, isn't heard to optimum effect. Occasionally some of the music drifts into the back speakers, but no sound effects have been routed there, and the result is a sound design not as spectacular as the film it's linked with.
There is a fantastic 46 minute documentary done in anomorphic widescreen with full-bodied sound that is a wonderful bonus, and the running commentary that accompanies the film is also most welcome.

This film is a very close remake of the great classic ""The Seven Samurai"" by Akira Kurosawa (also available on DVD from Amazon).
I noticed that most of the long, elaborate reviews don't even mention this, and most of the story elements that they praise are actually also found in the original.
For the most part, this remake adds very little to the original.  The acting here is mostly wooden, although that seems to be the norm for Westerns.  Most of the more complex material, such as the relationship between the village girl and the samurai (gunslinger), has been removed for the Hollywood remake, leaving just a smattering of philosophical mutterings about the difference between being a gunslinger and a farmer.
For the first two-thirds of the film, it follows very closely the story line of the original.  But then, when it begins to diverge - in order to shorten the story and simplify it for a wider audience - the carefully constructed plausibility of the original is lost, and we end up with a completely implausible ending, both in terms of motivation, and in terms of tactics and strategy.
The original ""Seven Samurai"" goes to great lengths to create a plausible scenario of how seven men could have a chance at defending a village against 40 bandits.  In typical Hollywood fashion, this is thrown out in favor of the typical nonsense whereby protagonists can shoot and kill all bad guys without aiming, whereas bad guys can never hit anything, no matter how many hundreds of times they shoot.
The lengths gone to accomodate Western stereotypes hit a peak, when in a very poor village with open-air rooms and few walls, when our heroes are attacked, they find themselves in a house with glass windows - since it is obviously required that gunslingers must knock out a window in order to shoot back!  Of course, to ship these windows thousand of miles would have cost more than the worth of the whole village....
I suppose plausibility has never been a feature of most Westerners, but I have to be dismayed with how the careful construction of the original film has been dispensed with in this remake.
Nevertheless, I give this film 3 stars because it is well made, and those who love Westerns will certainly want to see it.
But those who are more wide ranging film fans are advised to instead rent or buy the original ""The Seven Samurai"" by Akira Kurosawa.
PS  Other films inspired by The Seven Samurai, include ""Battle Beyond The Stars"" where this story is mixed with the Star Wars story (and Robert Vaughn reprises his Magnificent Seven role);  ""A Bug's Life"" where ant villagers are attacked by grasshopper bandits, and the classic Hindi film ""Sholay"" (starring the world's most famous actor Amitabh) where only two gunslingers defend the villagers from the bandits.",988070400,14,2980,4.772815533980583
882732,5,630442972X,"THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN is perhaps my favorite film and there are seven good reasons for that. Yul Brynner as Chris, Steve McQueen as Vin, Charles Bronson as O'Reilly, Robert Vaughn as Lee, Brad Dexter as Harry Luck, James Coburn as Britt and Horst Buchholz as Chico are all imbedded into the psyche of anyone who ever saw this movie and felt its emotional impact. These are real screen heroes.

There is something very magical about this film. This is different from every other Western that came before it. I believe it is the nature of the seven gunfighters, their motives for that one chance at gallantry and redemption. That combined with the way the story is visually told makes for its greatness. It teaches us something about nobility, dignity and devotion. The hearse-ride taken up to Boot Hill with Yul Brynner driving and Steve McQueen riding shotgun sets the stage and tone for the entire film. Images such as when Charles Bronson, is bent over with a bullet inside and the three little Mexican boys clutch him crying out his name while in his death throes bring a tear to the eye. In another the viewer reflects along with Yul Brynner as he takes the lifeless James Coburn's knife out of the adobe wall and folds it gently in his hand. These are heart rendering and indelible images. Even Eli Wallach as the bandit Calvera gets his moment of pathos. After being mortally wounded by Yul Brynner's bullet, Calvera can not believe that the seven came back to save the village even after the villagers told them that they did not want their help anymore. ""You came back. A man like you. Why?"" asks Calvera as he dies. Yul Brynner has no answer for him. It was as if Brynner had committed some sacrilege.

Director John Sturges captured the ambiguities of the human spirit in this film. Just as he directed ""The Great Escape,"" Sturges' directorial style is so smooth that his own storytelling glosses right over the depth and complexity of his own work. The ultimate shame is that all Sturges' profoundness is all right up there on the screen. He literally outdoes himself along with a little help from Elmer Bernstein's score and William Roberts' script. Bernstein's insertion of quick tempo snippets here and there into the score advances the film and pulls the viewer right into the narrative with an emotional fervor along with his unforgettable main title theme. William Roberts' script is so full of memorable and engaging dialogue that it too smoothly advances the story with ease and shear magnetism playing on our emotions.

For me Yul Brynner was the epitome of `cool' and aplomb. From his dark gray and black outfit down to the tip of his thin cheroot he was the kind of man others look up to but keep their distance. Yul Brynner as Chris, was a man of few words and often communicated by the mere gesture of the hand. Of the seven, he was the cohesive element that drew them together simply by his demeanor. The aura of his worldliness beckoned them all to the place he was heading. It was the same place they were all going. He was just the first to recognize it. Brynner too was the cohesive element that kept them all together. Brynner was the one who followed some unwritten code of honor that is only alluded to in a few passages. McQueen was perfect as the gunfighter who was ""just drifting"" and signed on with Brynner. The levelheaded McQueen represents the other characters' realizations one by one as they join. James Coburn was perfect, as the stoic knife throwing Britt, who lived only for the thrill of the moment. Charles Bronson as O'Reilly played his stoically rugged but sympathetic role better than any actor could have. Bronson had a unique visual presence whose kind facial expressions counterbalanced his pockmark face and strong physique. Bronson was a conundrum unto himself and perfect for the role. Brad Dexter's performance as the unlucky fortune hunter has gone unrecognized. He was the least noble of the seven and died the mercenary that he was, yet there is some nobility to one's profession in that. Still, he gains our sympathy after returning in the clutch and saves his friend Chris and in turn is killed. Dying in the arms of his friend, Chris lets him go to the grave with a lie. Robert Vaughn's character was probably the most interesting of the seven. His enigmatic portrayal of Lee the tormented soul and not really the coward he labeled himself somehow never stood out. Only his act of redemption, his gunplay and death during the finale lingers. Vaughn's portrayal is a success because as he said he was ""the coward hiding out in the middle of a battlefield"" and at that he succeeded. Horst Buchholz gave an energetic and bravura performance the only one of the seven that had not yet been corrupted by the world. At the end he symbolically hangs his guns up and roles up his sleeves. Brynner and McQueen say that ""only the farmers have won"" and they lost. As they ride off into screen immortality I think we all won.

882734,4,630442972X,"This is one of the best westerns ever made.  Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen lead an all-star cast to a showdown in the old west.  Director John Sturges makes this western the way they are suppose to be made: lots of tough guys; lots of shooting; and not too much talking.  Brynner and McQueen meet in a small town, they are both drifters and hired guns, they team up to drive a hearse to a graveyard.  The catch is the dead guy they are driving is an indian and the locals don't want him burried in their cemetary.  Witnessing their display of heroism is a group of farmers from a nearby village.  They are being annually robbed by the same man and are looking to find help to stand up to him.  They hire Brynner who signs on McQueen and eventaully five other guys to make up the Magnificent Seven.  Once assembled they travel to the village and make plans to put up a fight when he arrives.  This turns out great and is a must see for any western fan.  With all the stars turning in excellent performances it is worth a look if you like just one of them.  But the chemistry is great, and so is the direction, and the story, and of coarse it has that classic score.",975888000,5,1164,4.198198198198198
882735,5,630442972X,"During each decade,there were 2 or 3 westerns that stood above all the rest. In the 1950s,there was ""Shane"" and ""High noon"".In the 1960s came ""The wild bunch"" and this film,""The magnificent seven"".  During the later 1950s,the comedy western (as popularized by John Wayne,who went on to make dozens more comedy westerns in the 1960s and 1970s) and the 'broad scope' western (i.e. the normal western subjects were buried beneath other stories - a good example being ""The big country"").By 1960,what was needed was a good oldstyle classic western.""The magnificent seven"" gave us that - and more. It revitalized the whole western film theory.  The story,like that of ""Shane"",is about farmers versus bad guys who want to rob them of their land,food and village. The village asks Chris (Yul Brynner) to help them and he then goes out to locate 6 good men to help. Many shootouts follow and 4 of the 7 die in a brave climatic fight that rids the village of the bandits who want to take it over. 1 of the 7 remains in the village,while 2 ride away (and would later return with a new magnificent 7 for a sequel).  An adaptation from a Japanese film (""The seven Samurai""),this proved how well this worked and was thus repeated for another classic western,""Fistful of dollars"".  While the film nodded towards previous classic westerns like ""Shane"",it also created a new dimension to the western and no doubt classics like ""Fistful of dollars"",""The wild bunch"", ""The revengers"" and many others were inspired by it.

882809,5,630442972X,"Reviewing The Wild Bunch made me want to see this movie again.  Along with that Peckinpaugh classic, this in my opinion is the best western, and one of the best movies ever made.
The story is well told via the synopses, so  there is no need to re-hash that.  The characters are great, and portrayed  by Brynner, McQueen, Coburn, Bronson and the rest in arguably their seminal  roles.
They must be bad guys, because they are gunslingers for a living,  right?  But how can you explain their seeing to it that an old Indian gets  a decent burial?  Coburn kills a man with a knife just to prove he is  faster, but refuses to be told what to do by Calvera, with the classic  macho line:  ""Nobody throws me my guns and says 'run'.  Nobody!""
They sure know Good from Evil, though.  Bronson lectures  the village boys and sets them straight on their fathers' unseen courage.  Perhaps the best line comes during the argument as to whether or not to  fight on after some of the villagers betray them:  When McQueen opines that  no Court would ever enforce the contract they made with the villagers,  Brynner ends the discussion with a simple sentence: ""That is exactly  the kind of contract you have got to keep.""
Bullys lose in the  end.  Sometimes we are called upon to make an extreme sacrifice to do the  right thing.  Adversity can help restore ones honor.  Corny as it may  sound, this is the kind of movie I want my sons to watch.",960768000,2,1427,4.430232558139535
882810,5,630442972X,"An effective blend of professionalism, courage in adversity, and the heroism of common people distinguish this classic Western.  There is a subtle irony in this film that elevates it above the typical  action-adventure movie.  The wise old man of the village is right when he  asserts, after the gunfire subsides and the dead are buried, that only the  farmers won.  The farmers symbolize the timeless struggle of daily life.  The commitment to domestic responsibility and the work ethic of parents as  they strive to provide for a family is recognized as heroic and enduring.  The vaunted freedom and machismo of the wandering gunfighter is exposed as  myth.  To each perceived advantage of living by the gunman's code there is  a counter-point of a lonely life with no focal point.  The gunfighters are  compared to a great wind that rids the farmers of a locust plague, but is  unwelcome when its task is done.  Violence is anathema to raising crops,  increasing herds, and nurturing children.
Subtlety aside, the surface  appeal of the movie is its exciting tale of the seven hired guns that help  a Mexican village battle a ruthless bandit gang.  Yul Brynner does well as  the stoic leader of the Seven.  His ""gunfighter in black"" image  has become a minor icon of American film lore.  At the time, the casting of  obscure young actors as the rest of the Seven was brilliantly done.  Steve  McQueen's too cool performance is especially effective.  James Coburn,  Robert Vaughn, and Charles Bronson are great as the smooth professionals  calmly confronting arrogant amateurs.  Eli Wallach as the strutting bandit  chief is simultaneously sinister and comic.  His pontificating on the  decline of religion and the shameless women's fashions of the day while his  gang openly steal from the village is hiliarious dark comedy.
The film is  ably directed by John Sturges.  The movie mixes the familiar Western  elements with a dash of Ernest Hemingway's concept of courage in adversity  and Howard Hawks' philosophy of professionalism.  Its quiet tribute to the  daily heroism of common people is unusual and commendable for its insight.  A legendary film score adds to the excitement.  The enjoyment of this movie  increases with each viewing.  Highly recommended.",960508800,2,2265,5.0683060109289615
882811,5,630442972X,"There's something romantic, even heroic, in the notion of taking a stand against overwhelming odds for the sake of an ideal, or a principle; in ""The Magnificent Seven,"" directed by John Sturges, it's to save a poor Mexican  village from a small army of bandits.  Every year, as soon as the crops are  in, Calvera (Eli Wallach) and his men raid the village for the food that  will sustain them as they winter in the mountains.  And every year they  take a little more, leaving the villagers near to starvation.  They want to  fight back, but they are simple farmers; no match for the likes of Calvera.  When they fear they cannot survive another winter on the pittance he  leaves them, they decide to take action.  If they are unable to defend  themselves, they will hire men to do it for them.  Men with guns.  And  toward that end, everything of value in the village is collected (not much  more than a watch and some trinkets) to be offered as payment to anyone who  will champion their cause.  Three men from the village set out to find the  men they need, and after witnessing an altercation in a small Texas border  town, they think they have the man they want.  Chris (Yul Brynner) is a  drifter, a man who lives by his wits.  And by his gun.  They approach him,  and when he hears what they have to offer, he accepts.  ""I've been paid a  lot for my work,"" he tells them, ""But never everything.""  Now he must find  other men, like himself, to stand with him against Calvera.  The first  is Vin (Steve McQueen), also a drifter, and looking for work.  Chris knows  what he can do, how he handles a gun; Vin sided with him during the  incident in town.  Bernardo (Charles Bronson), is good with a rifle.  Fallen on hard times, the pay offered (the cost of bullets, and meals)  ""Right now, sounds like a lot.""  The dapper Lee (Robert Vaughn), is a fast  gun, and currently on the run; Britt (James Coburn), the best anywhere with  a gun or a knife; Harry (Brad Dexter), a good man, but always looking for  an angle.  He knows Chris, and takes the job convinced that there's more in  it for them than he's letting on, probably gold; finally, there's Chico  (Horst Buchholz), a young wanna-be gunslinger who refuses to leave Chris  alone until he agrees to take him along.  The all-star cast and  outstanding performances highlight this film, most notably the iconoclastic  McQueen, Wallach, Vaughn and especially Coburn, who brings a commanding  presence to the screen with the cool, laconic Britt.  One of the most  memorable scenes involves Britt, when he is challenged to a mock duel (with  targets) by a cowboy named Wallace (Robert J. Wilke); Wallace's gun against  Britt's knife.  When Wallace thinks he's won, Britt simply says, ""You  lost.""  And they do it again; this time, for real.  The supporting cast  includes Jorge Martinez de Hoyos (Hilario), Vladimir Sokoloff (Old Man),  Rosenda Monteros (Petra) and Rico Alaniz (Sotero).  An updated version of  ""The Seven Samurai,"" ""The Magnificent Seven"" has all the elements of the  traditional western, but it is so much more.  It's a character study of men  as individuals; not outlaws, but hard men, drawn together by a common bond,  and who live by a variation of the same code.  Their first loyalty is to  themselves, and to their word; and to the autonomy that ensures they will  live, and die, on their own terms.  This movie may lack the gritty realism  of some of the more recent films, but with it's stellar cast, the instantly  recognizable Elmer Bernstein theme, and the way it was packaged and  delivered by Sturges, it will forever hold a place at the top in the  history of the Western Film.",959990400,2,3662,4.600624024960998

882865,4,630442972X,"In my opinion, The Magnificent Seven is among the best movies of all time.  It is made in the classic Western style, but perhaps due to the adaptation from the Seven Samaurai, it has a lot of the elements of modern movie  characters:  morally ambiguous anti-heroes who face a personal crossroads  but ultimately choose the right path.
This movie adds new angles to the  conventional Western plot.  A group of 40 bandits led by a robust but  ruthless leader named Calvera (Eli Wallach)continously raids a poor farming  village for food and other provisions.  A group of villagers go north of  the border to enlist hired guns to protect them.  Eventually, a cool  gunslinger by the name of Chris (Yul Brynner) organizes a team of seven  able mercenaries to defend the village for a meager fee.  The group works  well together and inspires the villagers to join the fight to drive Calvera  out.  After some success, the group suffers some adversity against  considerable odds.  In the end, both the visitors and the villagers learn  about the price -- and payoff -- of resisting injustice.
This movie is  truly driven by its great characters.  Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen, who  plays Brynner's de facto lieutenant Vin,  could have likely done this movie  by themselves.  Their chemistry reminds me of Newman and Redford in Butch  Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, but with a drier humor.  I would have loved  to have seen them in more movies together.
I liked all of the Seven, but  two others really stood out.  Charles Bronson was impressive as the  hard-edged O'Reilly, and played the role with a sense of humor and warmth  without losing his stoic demeanor.  Horst Buchholz was extremely impressive  as the young gun (""Chico"") who goes through an identity crisis as  he is torn between the romanticism of being a gunslinger and the  contrasting ethics of his heritage.  Why wasn't he in more movies?  Eli  Wallach is superb as the boisterous, scenery-chewing Calvera, and Wallach  brings gives a sense of humor and empathy to the role which distinguishes  it from most movie villains I've seen.  The village leaders were also very  good.
The style and tone of this movie reminds me of the anti-hero type  movies made in the late 60's and early 70's and the buddy/action-type  movies of the current era.  It also has two of the best cinematic gunfights  I have ever seen.  You owe it to yourself to at least see this one.

Together they assume heroic  proportions in an altruistic fight against near-impossible odds.
Elmer  Bernstein's memorable musical score has achieved a lasting stature.  From  his rousing signature title to the haunting Spanish-flavored themes, the  music teems with scope, drive, and energy.
