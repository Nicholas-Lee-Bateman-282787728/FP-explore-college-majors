2672870,4,B000JJSJPU,"First off I have to say I loved this movie IT WAS FUNNY. Besides the obvious storyline of two love sick teen virgins, not knowing if they want sex or not, realizing somewhat that they love each other, just to have sex and realize again that it was only sexaul frustration. The Naked Mile was exactly what it says people running completely nude. Other than the storyline, I love the nudity, I love the sex and I love the humor, also the deleted scene with the Stiflers was great it should have been kept. And DAMN how many Stiflers are there! I don't care neither, keep them coming ! No matter what people say, these characters make this series, unlike the Band Camp movie when they humanized the Stifler character, in this one you still had one prick of a Stifler and that was great. Some may think they beating a dead horse with this but I say as long as you making MILLIONS with every title, KEEP DOING IT. The National Lampoons' franchise is basically beating a dead horse with dead comedies, REALLY, nothing good since ANIMAL HOUSE, EUROPEAN VACATION, AND VEGAS BACHELOR PARTY (hey it is funny). This is the New Generation Series of over the top mature teen comedies, keep going.",1170374400,2,1183,4.5327102803738315
2672871,3,B000JJSJPU,"Ignore any reviews of people who dismiss this film just because it doesn't have any of the original cast in it. I know that sequels more often then not don't work without the original cast, but these aren't really what I would call a sequel, there more a running theme now that I think is working.

This time around it's about another member of the Stiffler family who is invited by his other Stiffler cousin to go visit him and his friends on campus to show the final year high school cousin and friends what going to the college is going to be like, and also participate in what they call the Naked Mile where the students get naked and run a mile and party afterwards, all while little virgin Stiffler has been given permission by his virgin girlfriend to do what he wants for the weekend.

the plot isn't much, the story line is predictable, but thats not to say it's not a fun and funny film. It's filled with some pretty good gags throughout the film, and I can say I'm glad now i didn't listen to reviews saying this is a bad film, I enjoyed this one more then Band Camp and Wedding, and if they decide to do a 6th one, I'll be sure to see it... probably gonna be about a Stiffler female member or something... I dunno, but I think they can pull it off.

If you are someone who can't get past the fact that the original cast from the first 3 are no longer in it, then don't bother watching it, but if you can stand a bit of swearing and nudity and a party kind of film with no point but fun, then this rates somewhere up there with Screwballs, Porky's and Animal House... I'm not saying it compares to Animal House, but it's somewhere up there close enough to smell a fart let go by Bluto.",1170115200,,1696,4.196319018404908
2672872,3,B000JJSJPU,"This movie is a slight bit better than band camp, which had serious failure to launch.  The only reason I say that is this one actually made me laugh at some points.  However, the Stifler thing is getting old, and I the whole ""have to do it"" before high school is over is not quite there.  They made american wedding, which was very good, but they should have taken that storyline forward before they pushed the stifler line out.  It would have probably kept the more solid cast.  Overall, worth a rent to follow through with the series.  At least it's not as bad as van wilder two or the ""National Lampoon"" series (like Pledge This).",1169164800,,634,4.422413793103448
2672873,1,B000JJSJPU,"While I loved previous American Pie movies, this installment is simply a poor effort to squeeze out more money from the American Pie name. The story line is just plain bad, the acting is the worst I've seen in any movie - there are just no redeeming qualities to this movie. Save your time and watch something else.",1168819200,2,315,4.448275862068965
2672874,2,B000JJSJPU,"I loved the first two or three American Pie Movies. This movie SUCKS, big time, not worth $20.  So, if I where you I would just rent  it first.",1168646400,,143,3.896551724137931
2672875,4,B000JJSJPU,"I liked this movie, and I immediately watched some of the tracks (scenes) several times...such as the Naked Mile race and the underwear party.  There was more nudity than I expected throughout the movie, and that alone made the dvd worth watching.  And I plan on watching the dvd a couple more times.  The comedy of the movie was OK (not top-notch...but OK), and some of the subplots were OK...such as the romance between the young Stifler and his girlfriend.  And the young Stifler's girlfriend was cute and innocent...which was a nice contrast with other girls that were wilder.  College girl nudity in this dvd includes: girl's locker room, stripping naked before the Naked Mile race and standing around waiting for the race to start, running naked and bouncing along for the Naked Mile race, and sex in several frat rooms.  I can't remember the last time that I saw this many naked bouncing breasts...bouncing...bouncing (most were natural).  But even after all the nudity, the girls at the underwear party were sexy too.  There is some full frontal nudity for females during the movie, but not male full frontal.

I own some movies of the actual annual Naked Mile races in Michigan, but those movies were filmed with poor lighting and the picture is ""grainy""...lacking in picture sharpness....because the Naked Mile race takes place at night (its dark...there's not enough light).  But for this American Pie movie, they used proper lighting and equipment to show their version of the Naked Mile race with sharp picture detail...very watchable.

Overall, this American Pie movie was better than I expected.  If you like college comedies with T&A, I expect that you will like it.",1167436800,21,1682,4.94661921708185
2672876,1,B000JJSJPU,"As a fan of the series, I was looking forward to another chapter, even tho they are not the same. I thought ""Band Camp"" was a decent enough DVD sequel, and now we have this latest installment. It's definitley not out of the question by saying that this is the worst film in the franchise. Band Camp was no great prize, but it was better than this one. I look forward to fun teenage comedy, but if this is the latest effort in what was a pretty good trilogy of raunch, then it's time to put the pies away. The fifth piece of pie is the one where you say ""I'm stuffed!. I can't take another piece!"". More on this in a bit. The story?. Pretty simple. We are introduced to Eric Stifler, cousin to Steve(from the original trilogy), and cousin to Matt(of Band Camp fame). Unlike those two, he is very un-Stiflerlike. He hasn't done anything real crazy or outrageous, and horror of horrors, is looking to graduate high school as a virgin. In ways, Eric is more like Jim than his real family. His friends decide to go to a college campus for the weekend to participate in the Naked Mile, where students run naked for...well, it's self explanatory. There, Eric plans to make the most of the situation and live up to the family name. He wants to be a real Stifler once and for all. In addition, his girlfriend Tracy(who wants to wait for sex), gives him a free pass for the weekend to do what he needs to do. Yeah, right. This film doesn't have any real feel to the other Pie films. Band Camp did in some ways. It had Matt Stifler, who had acted like his big bro(and therefore made it feel like the earlier films). Why didn't we continue with that character?. It would of been somewhat of an improvement. Plus, that film had more of Jim's dad(here, he is just a passing character). BC's location at Band Camp is also a tie in with the original films. Except for the appearance of Eugene Levy(who is wated, but nonetheless is the only good part of the entire movie), this film could of dropped the 'American Pie' title since it feels disconnected. What the other films also had that this film doesn't is heart. The original trilogy seemed to be more about the characters and what happens to them with genuine heart. Even BC, to a lesser degree, managed to get some of that heart. This one doesn't come near it. It tries, but it feels forced and unmoving. The raunch factor is ricocheted up to a higher notch than all previous 'Pie' films and it's uncalled for. The others weren't exactly subtle, but this one felt like it was trying to hit you over the head with it. The cast is nothing special. Our lead Stifler is bland and boring, and his friends aren't as fun or interesting as our original gang. In fact, most of the people here are unlikeable. We are also introduced to another Stifler Cousin, Dwight, who keeps more in line with his cousins. Sadly, he is more of an annoying caricature than anything else. Is it funny?. Not really. With the exception of Levy and Christopher MacDonald(who should of had a bigger part)as Eric's dad talking at the dinner table, I didn't really laugh once. The different scene in the Special Features section of this was even funnier. Why was that one left out?. It says the movie goes the extra mile to get laughs. Yes, it tries hard, but it doesn't get them. I can't find anything to recommend.",1166745600,20,3323,4.422512234910277
2672877,3,B000JJSJPU,"Released straight to DVD, The Naked Mile is the 5th movie in the american pie series.  The last two, Band Camp and this one, concentrate on the Family of Stiffler.  This one has a cousing of The original Stiffler, Erik, who visits another cousin at Michigan for their annual Naked Mile party.  The original stiffler family is gone.  Erik is a different Stiffler, he has a concience and a brain other than the one down below.  But, the movie line is the same, High School Kids wanting to have sex. And hopefully they don't create any more stifflers, it getting old. But, the movie has its funny parts, but its no classic like the first three.  How much teenage Angst can you squeeze out of a series, this one is testing the limit.  Also, this unrated version pushes the nudity up to an all new level for the series.  So, an entertaining rental, but not a must have.",1166659200,8,864,4.424050632911392
2672878,3,B000JJSJPU,"American Pie: Naked Mile is surprisingly a more entertainng made for video movie than the Band Camp one. It's more funny than the last one as well. Erik Stiffler ""yes yet another Stiffler but this one is a cousin"" who's the only virgin of the family. His g/f wants to wait to have sex and he was with her for 2 years so it's holding him back from having sex. She gives him a guilt free pass to have sex for a weekend when he goes on a trip to check out a college with friends.

  The result is a surprisingly good time and it's of course raunchy since it's an American Pie movie. I do admit that some of it's perverted jokes go on a little too long though.  Still it's smarter and more watchable than the last made for video movie. Plus Steve Talley is better as one of Stiffler's brothers than the one from the Band Camp movie. I mean the one from Band Camp tried way too hard to be Sean William Scott. Talley just gives his own performance and is one of the funnier people in the movie. It's funny how he has a little feud ""no pun intended"" going on with midgets.",1166486400,20,1065,4.105769230769231

This installment is similar to other ""American Pie"" films; it is filled with sexual innuendos, teen-filled romps stories, and gags that will please the most ardent young viewer. The movie is funny and it does have its moments, but I believe the studio and producers are ruining a good thing by constantly releasing different sequels in this franchise. It is really time to stop, but knowing the studios in Hollywood if they can milk money out of a movie franchise they will. This DVD has outtakes, deleted scenes, and more, so if you are an ""American Pie"" junkie buy the DVD; if your looking for good qualirty comedy go else where.",1264464000,,811,4.8
2672976,4,B000JJSJPU,"OK, with all due respects to the first 3 American Pie movies.  This one isn't near as funny as any of those 3 movies.  But it is a good movie.  It's about elenty billion times better then the epic failure of ""American Pie Presents Band Camp"".  And although the only character from the original 3 American Pie/Wedding movies returning in this film is Jim Levenstines Dad (played by the one and only talented Canadian actor Eugene Levy) it still has a lot of good funny new characters in it such as Eric Stiffler (a HS senior and quite possibly the only Stiffler who hasn't been laid in highschool and actually has/had a steady girlfriend in high school), Rock and the vertically challenged from the Lambda fraternity and their older brother who is the only member of the house not vertically challenged, and my personal favorite Dwight Stiffler (cousin to Steve, Matt, and Eric Stiffer ).  And thank god this movie does not have the older version of Matt Stiffler or anyone else aside from Jim's dad who had a part in the movie ""American Pie Presents Band Camp"" in it.  But all in all I'd say if the creator of the American Pie series wants to have another super successful film, he should do one when Steve Stiffler, Kevin Myers, Jim Levenstene, Oz, and Paul Finch are kids in either elementary school or better yet Middle School. Yeah, they could do one about when Jim, Stiffler, Finch, Kevin and Oz are in middle school about Steve Stiffler's first couple of times getting laid.  But then again that's just my opinion, it may not be the best idea in the world for the pie series.",1245801600,,1581,4.545774647887324
2672977,4,B000JJSJPU,"At first there was Steve. Then there was Matt. Now... there is Erik. Stiflers. And we all know how the Stiflers are. Or do we? Actually Erik is more of a normal guy than any of them. He's so normal that no one even calls him Stifler like his cousins Steve, Matt, and even Dwight. It's just plain old Erik. Who by the way is a senior AND a virgin. BLASPHEMY for the Stifler name. But it's ok for Erik, sort of. He's in love with his girlfriend of 2 years who is also a virgin, so he does what he can to help relieve the stress...if you get my drift. As time goes on though, it gets even worse for him because he is constantly getting made fun of, and as we all know, standards are black and white different for being a virgin guy or a virgin girl. After some failed attempts, Tracy (his girl) decides she still isn't ready. Though to try and make him happy, she lets him have a guilt free weekend, which is basically letting him do anything he wants. Just so happens though he's going to visit his other cousin at college... Dwight Stifler, the king of his frat house and a campus legend.

The first time I viewed this, I thought it was decent addition to the series, but now after seeing it a second time, I actually liked it a lot more the second time through. The jokes were pretty funny, but I think I just really liked the characters more than anything. Sure it can be unbelievable, but it's an American Pie movie. Erik was a little more interesting as a Stifler this time around, because it was nice to see just a normal Stifler compared to all the crazy ones we see. Of course he's still trying to get laid, but at least it's with his girlfriend instead of the whole world. And Dwight Stifler, to me, was a really cool Stifler. A lot less insane than Steve, and much cooler than Matt. He's exactly what I think of when I think of a frat house legend. Everyone wants to party with him, they basically cheer at anything he says, and he's always got some crazy sayings or ideas.

And boy is there a lot of nekidness. Lots. As for the jokes, there were plenty for sure. Not all were funny (like a certain money shot scene that involved two guys), but I did laugh quite a bit. And the midgets...oh man. Talk about stealing the scenes. They had some of the best parts. I loved how they were the arch enemies of Dwight's frat. The football game was ridiculous (it was also like 10 minutes of the film...crazy) between those two. When the main midget dude bites Dwight, and even when you KNOW it's coming, I still laughed pretty hard.

In the end, definitely give it a try. It's not that bad at all. I'm glad I own it.

P.S. - I reviewed Beta House (part 6) already in the past so give it a looky loo if you'd like.",1237939200,3,2713,4.1915708812260535

Usually I am not one that truly enjoys American Pie movies too much. I especially wasn't a fan of the first spin-off in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Pie-Presents-Band-Camp/dp/1417046449/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Pie Presents: Band Camp</a>. This movie is pretty decent though. It has its comedic spots and a good main character.

Erik Stifler is a member of the notorious Stifler family. The Stifler family is known for having no problems getting ""action"". This being said, Erik is a virgin and is entering his final years in high school. His girlfriend just isn't ready for that type of commitment. Erik waits patiently but tells her he can't wait forever. Erik and two of his friends are making plans to go to the Naked Mile. The Naked Mile is where hundreds of college students run naked through the streets to enjoy themselves after exams. Erik is given a guilt-free pass for the weekend, meaning he can do whatever he wants without her saying anything. His girlfriend soon wants to revoke the pass, but is convinced to trust her boyfriend to not do anything wrong. Erik soon begins his adventures at the Naked Mile, which includes fighting little people.

Erik is your common loser who is worried that if he doesn't get ""action"" soon he will be laughed at forever. This is a great change from the past Stifler characters that have all been idiots. Idiots just don't work as compelling main characters.

The story is somewhat predictable. You know pretty much that he's going to run back to his girlfriend. I didn't want to spoil the movie, but it really is that obvious. Still, the comedy in between is fairly good. You'll see things like little people destroying normal sized people in football, which is very entertaining.

Another good thing about this DVD is the extras. You get your usual behind the scenes and commentary stuff. On this DVD you will get a guide on how to pick up women at Yoga. You also get to see the actors getting their butts waxed, which is very entertaining.

I wouldn't say that this is a movie you need to go out and pick up. It's a decent movie with some decent extras. Maybe worth a rental.",1216166400,,2220,4.941018766756033

2672982,1,B000JJSJPU,"The unrated full-screen edition of this movie occasionally wants to be the R-rated version; in addition, it doesn't offer all the bonus features it promises.

At 0:09:42 a young woman emerges from the ""shower room"" wearing underwear. In the unrated widescreen version, she emerges wearing nothing.

At 1:11:23 several female runners wearing caps and goggles appear topless. The widescreen version shows them fully nude.

At 1:41:32, after the closing credits, the following message appears: ""This Motion Picture Has Been Rated R."" A similar notice appears before the movie begins.

Missing from the bonus features on this disc are ""The Yoga Guide to Getting Girls"" and ""The Bare Essentials,"" even though the back cover of the DVD case lists these as included segments. (The widescreen version does contain them.)

Your best bet, therefore, is to get the unrated widescreen version. Sadly, Universal Studios doesn't include both full-screen and widescreen editions on one disc as some other studios do. In a case like this one, simply turning the disc over would have solved the problem. You'd get a letterboxed picture indeed, but at least an accurate, unbutchered one.",1209427200,2,1169,5.263440860215054

2672984,5,B000JJSJPU,"Ok class, time for a review --
The first American Pie movie? outrageously funny.  Rude, crude, surprising, shocking and absolutely hilarious.
The second American Pie movie? uh, take the rude and crude and basically toss it out and leave behind a movie that was ok, but not nearly as good as the predecessor.
Third movie? (American Pie Wedding) was too much love story and not so much humor. Ok, but again, didn't hold a candle to the original.
Fourth movie? (Band Camp) went in the wrong direction completely. Drop it from the collection please.
Fifth movie -- American Pie Presents The Naked Mile.  Now THAT IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!  Back to the rude, crude, immoral, outrageous and laugh out long and loud funny movie formula that made the first movie so entertaining.  Too much Stiffler?  Not at all.

Plenty of hot babes showing plenty of skin.  A humorous 'little' war between fraternities both big and uh, small.  And a story of a guy trying to be true to his girl while facing enough temptation to distract all but the most dedicated.

Most definitely not academy award or golden globe material (Heh, he said globe ;-) ) but funny none the less.  Go into it with the right attitude and laugh your rear off.  Look for high brow material elsewhere if you must.",1198454400,4,1267,4.63677130044843

2672996,3,B000JJSJPU,"The movie itself was alright, lots of gratuitis boob shots as promised. However, I'm just slightly annoyed that the movie was again about a member of the Stiffler family. I understand that it was the most versatile direction for the directors to go with, but still, could have done with something a little more in depth than that. Wait, did I just say ""in depth"" in the same conversation as an American Pie movie? Nevermind, ignore me. Great movie if you want boobs and midgets.",1186272000,,478,4.635294117647059
2672997,3,B000JJSJPU,"I saw Band Camp a while back, and was extremely disappointed.  It was just lame lame lame.  When this one came out, I thought I would give it a try just because it couldn't get much worse than Band Camp.  I was pleasently surprised that it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, and is actually pretty good.

Once again we meet a Stiffler.  This Stiffler is a somewhat awkward one, not living up to his family reputation of obnoxious and deviant behavior.  He is looking to live up to his family name, and when he is given a weekend pass by his girlfriend, he and his equally awkward buddies (in reminiscence of the original Pie triology) go off for a weekend at his cousin Stiffler's college.  The hilarity ensues, as they are going to take part in the Naked Mile streaking, binge drinking, and all the other accoutraments of college life.

Why not 5 stars?  They played on some pretty obvious things, like the midget football, the underwear party, and the girls with weird fetishes.  And didn't you know from the beginning that college Stiffler would bang his rival's girlfriend even though she was a midget?  The good Stiffler realizes that he doesn't want to run wild, he just wants to be with his girlfriend at home.  And at long last they get together.  A little predictable, but still a pretty good time.",1177891200,,1312,4.508474576271187

2673000,4,B000JJSJPU,"Although it doesn't live up to most of its predecessors, American Pie 5: The Naked Mile, is still a pretty good comedy. The big stars from the trilogy are overall absent as the movie focuses on Steve Stifler's little cousin Eric.  Being something of the black sheep of the family for being a senior in high school and still a virgin, Eric gets a guilt-free weekend pass from his girlfriend to visit a college campus for the legendary Naked Mile...

The movie, though not a masterpiece, is quite funny and it is guaranteed to provide more than a just a few laughs. The casting is pretty good, but it's just too bad that most of the original characters are missing. An appearance by Seann William Scott would have been great!

The setting, the dialogues, the music and the humor, are overall good.

As for the film's highlight, it has to be the girls! Jessy Schram and Candace Kroslak to name a few were simply AMAZING!!!

Overall, it is a movie worth watching, and even though quite silly at times, it will surely put you in a good mood!",1171756800,,1036,4.48936170212766

Because I tend to stick to the indies and art house genre of film, or films directed by talented filmmakers such as Tim Burton, Frank Capra, Sofia Coppola, Alfred Hitchcock, Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu, Sam Mendes, and Giuseppe Tornatore. Nevertheless, I was in high school around the time the first ""American Pie"" was released, and always enjoyed them. So, going against my better judgment, and never letting my fellow film major buddies in college know, I watched this direct-to-DVD sequel and I must say: it was rather funny. Seriously. Funny enought that I even watched it another four times. So, despite the fact that it's the 5th in the series, and its direct-to-DVD featuring a cast of unknowns, I must say...its rather enjoyable.",1170547200,,796,4.9037037037037035
