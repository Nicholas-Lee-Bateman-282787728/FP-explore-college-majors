6244387,4,B00HZMZ240,"This show is endlessly entertaining to my two year old. Yes I want to bang my head against the wall after an hour but she at least is busy. I do mean busy. The show encourages the audience to ""get up and go"" and join the characters in moving. My toddler loves it!",1416096000,,263,3.981132075471698

6244390,5,B00HZMZ240,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter absolutely loves Bo on the Go she will watch and at least five shows in a row acting out with Bo every time. She asks for it all the time. She started watching it when she was 16 months and she actively recruited and still recruits anyone around when it is on to be Bo Buddies she even got her Dr to be a Bo Buddy at one of her check ups. I love it too because it gets her up and moving instead of just sitting there staring at the tv and being lazy. It's great for rainy and cold days where she can't go outside, but I have to hide it from her on sick days because she is an avid Bo Buddy and as she reminds me, ""Bo Buddies help Bo."" The only issue I have is I wish they had more episodes and movies for a little more variety. She is also getting into Tree Fu Tom for older kids and trying to do Tree Fu with Tom This is for like 2-4 while Tree Fu Tom is like 5-8. These are the ones that are on Netflix if you are looking for others check out the Move, Groove & Grow 29 episodes one.",1410652800,,1012,3.7336448598130842

6244395,5,B00HZMZ240,"My 2yr old son loves this show and acts out all of the running and jumping as well as the animoves. Whenever he hears the intro song his face lights up and he throws his right hand into the air and shouts ""Bo Power."" We came across the show on Netflix and wanted to buy it for him since its clearly a favorite of his.

I would recommend this to any parent but especially if you want your child to be excited about getting some exercise and move around. We sometimes use this show to wear him down faster so he'll go to sleep at night. :)",1399593600,,537,4.018691588785047

6244401,4,B00HZMZ240,"MAXIMUM BO POWER!

In all seriousness though, this series is great. My 2-year old daughter loves watching it, and is learning how to exercise in a small space (living room) while enjoying her time. Coupled with the Move Groove and Go set, the ability to have her watch different episodes rather than the same one increases pretty significantly, as I have over 20 hours of non-repetitive screen time for her to jump along with.",1433116800,,426,4.756756756756757

6244405,5,B00HZMZ240,"My 6 year old came across Bo on the Go while we did a netflix trial over a year ago and he has loved the series ever since!  There is something about this series that gets him on the move, although it really isn't my taste and I feel that he is getting a bit old for it (I think it's more for a target audience of 3-5 year olds).  But he will jump and move to it more than any other show he watches so it's very effective to get children moving!  I personally find her arm band disturbing, but my opinion doesn't matter for the sake of this review :)

Anyway, the price was great for 3 dvds and he still often requests it.  Since we don't have netflix anymore and use amazon prime instead (which does not have it), this dvd set was a necessity for us.  I tried finding youtube clips for Bo on the Go, and strangely enough, there are quite a bit of them out there, but many in some interesting languages!  So it was just easier to get the dvd set, and I'm glad we got it!",1417046400,,970,3.9690721649484537

8637605,5,B00HZMZ240,"Our 3 yr old fell in love with Bo over a year ago, and watched the same episodes available from one season on Netflix. Finding and buying from this seller worked out perfectly, as Netflix was dropping the one season on April 2nd, causing a panic as she wants to watch frequently. DVD arrived quickly from this seller, in perfect condition, and we couldn't be happier. She is fascinated by the ""new"" episodes and it gets her up and moving, not to mention learning about more animoves.",1491091200,,483,4.563218390804598
