1900112,1,B0000A02UQ,"This movie is a favorite that I had seen years ago, since I could not find it to rent I purchased it.  The DVD came all scratched up and sections of the movie would not play.  With shipping & handling it was still less than renting the movie, it was just a bummer it did not play all the way though.",1339027200,,299,3.8852459016393444
1900113,5,B0000A02UQ,This is one of those cult stupid/funny classic films in the same category as Ghost Busters.  A great movie to watch when you just want to laugh.,1286064000,,144,4.333333333333333

1900115,5,B0000A02UQ,"This obscure movie is absolutely one of funniest I've ever seen!  Jeff Daniels was perfectly cast!  I accidentally found it while satellite channel surfing.  Finally found a copy to buy (naturally at amazon).

  I created THE TEST:  I picked 10 people I know that had reputations of hating TV, or preaching that movies were only for the uneducated, or were almost impossible to get a even smile from no matter how good a joke would be, or no matter what they were exposed to.  (Of course no one would initially admit this).  I invited them two at a time to the house for refreshments and to watch this movie.  I warned them ahead of what to expect, and that I would be betting that they could not stifle even a grin, much less a hearty laugh.  They all argued, all tried to convince me or each other that they possessed enough self control that they wouldn't even smile much less giggle, snort, or laugh while watching this comedy.  Some even wanted to bet money, to which I refused.  However, 8 agreed that the winner would be treated to a steak dinner.

RESULTS:  All ten persons lost!!  One person came close to not laughing but strange grunts & noises emanated from his mouth; he gave in and admitted his insides ""shook with glee"".  I am still owed 5 steak dinners and am gaining weight.

This story is true.  Years ago I offered the same test with ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"".  7 out of the 10 contestants laughed, but ""Super Sucker"" was 10 for 10.  Watch this and YOU WILL LAUGH!!  LET YOURSELF GO!  Then show it to your in-laws; your boss, or the dullest, most stoic pseudo-serious people you know and watch how they loose themselves to uncontrollable laughter.",1239408000,3,1674,4.488372093023256
1900116,4,B0000A02UQ,"If there was a 4.5 option Id've surely picked that instead of

4. This because I was only disappointed with the finish, and

I'm not even sure quite why. This is a wonderful movie,

especialy if you like good acting (that should be emphasized)

Though admittedly a character or two are (realisticly) corny,

you're bound to know someone you can relate them to.

There is a morsel of knowledge about the sales world in the

movie which could be distilled into the following idea:

You're own happiness and confidence always projects through

your sales(wo)man persona and directly affects the experience

that your customer is having which has as much to do with

'selling' somone one a product as them actually needing it.

Huzzah.

1900117,5,B0000A02UQ,"For unknown reasons there are people in this country that through no fault of their own come second place. They salute the other American flag and hear the anthem played for the losers.
  ""Super Sucker"" is a film about this group of people. Sort of a kinder version of ""Used Cars"" and has that same feel good quality
of  ""Tucker"". Writen,Acted and Directed By Jeff Daniels it is on the same level with the early work of Woody Allen's ""Take The Money and Run"" as an au tor work, we have in the past seen such projects turn out to be,  I Made this for myself and you are fortunate to see it; turn out be to so introspective as to actually put the viewer to sleep .
  With the film ""Super Sucker"" I had a goodtime from being to end. I felt a part of this film and I wanted to be one of the team of ""Super Sucker"" sales people(as stated in the film it is more than just a Vaccum). The Film is about the daily struggles of selling vaccums between two firms that may if Daniels, Fred Barlows team don't sell enought (which they have not been doing over the long term)will go out of business.
 As with most films these days it relies on sex to carry the comedy; I add this no to be critical but to warn asexual viewers.
 The nice surprise is Dawn Wells who we rarely get to see in films these days has a pleasant turn as herself and much mention is made of ""Gilligans Island"".
 Lately, I have had a hard time in this new age (The 21 century)
finding films that have not been over produced, over marketed,
or over hyped that I have truely enjoyed and felt good about buying.  ""Super Sucker"" is one and marks the 800 dvd in my collection the only other feel good film that I enjoyed lately that is in the same class is John Waters ""A Dirty Shame"". The next film that I can say I really want to see is ""Johnny Slade's Greatest Hits"" by Larry Blamire whose first film ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"" was also a goodtime.
""Super Sucker""  I believe worked because it was an independant film and the Jeff Daniels Free of studio muddling could get his vision on the screen. I was truely entertained by this work and we could use more like it.",1126396800,3,2126,4.17359413202934
1900118,4,B0000A02UQ,"Very funny movie.  Laughed especially hard when I saw my high school English teacher appear on screen half naked!  lol.  I highly recommend the rental - very original story, lots of laughs.",1124928000,2,189,4.84375
1900119,5,B0000A02UQ,"Rent it. Buy it. Love it.  Hell - tell your friends; it's that good.
Just looking at the reviews below will tell you something special about this movie.  It either got 1 star for being sick, or 5 stars for being hilarious.  Hell, if it's so funny it offends people, more power to it!
I got this because I had spent a large portion of my life actually selling ""vacuums"" door-to-door.  I wanted to see if their parody was funny because of the truth behind the business; it was so accurate, I was laughing within the first five minutes of showtime.  As your laughing at the premis of the movie, just keep in mind that it can be considered more a documentary than comedy.  And just to prove my case, the fabled ""magic-attachment"" is an item I would sell on a daily basis ^_^.
This movie is simply genius and if you haven't been corrupted by the stupid P.C. craze of the 90's you will get a definate kick out of this movie.",1088899200,2,918,4.277456647398844
1900120,5,B0000A02UQ,"Truly, this film may be the funniest ever made! And this comes from a lover of Python creations, Black Adder, and the Muppets!
The first half hour will have you in tears. The characters are locked in a seemingly hopeless struggle to remain successfully employed as door-to-door vacume salesmen. The sets are dreary, the costumes hopelessly white-trash, and Jeff's hair looks like it belongs to a bad real estate agent from 1982.
But then...the most shocking revelation occurrs! One of the discontinued attachments for their unpopular vacume, turns out to be an excellent, high powered, erotic aide! (The attachment had been discontinued decades before, when the manufacturer stumbled upon his wife putting this attachment to a rather unseemly use.) But one very determined salesman (Daniels) dusts off the old blueprints, retrains his sales personel in discreetly lewd sales pitches, and soon (thanks to hundreds of neglected housewives) business is booming!
But it's not over yet...an organization that believes in the protection of household appliances starts a...well...a civil rights movement of sorts, to protect the vacumes from ... ""misuse,"" and the scandals that arise soon after...well, you just have to see it!",1061164800,10,1220,5.392670157068062
1900121,5,B0000A02UQ,"Ok I admit it I'm a tough one to please when it comes to comedies. I don't laugh at most of them, and find many of them just stupid. This one is Different. Very Different, It started good, and it just kept getting better and better.
I laughed parts of my anatomy off. The crowd in the theater went wild with laughter, there were people sliding out of their seats and rolling on the floor. I had tears running down my face from laughing so hard and long. This is a special movie, guys and gals will both love the movie, but for slightly different, very enjoyable reasons.
The movie is innocently clean, but yet gets a little dirty...
REALLY... What else would you expect from vacuum cleaner salespeople?
Buy this DVD and you will develop a special attachment for it, after watching the movie just once. It's the special deal you can't refuse. You will come back for more, again and again.
This movie was independently produced. It is NOT something from the all alike mass produced Hollywood movie studios. It is a hidden gem I heard about while in Jackson Michigan (where incidentally, it was filmed.) I went to see the movie and have been waiting patiently for the DVD to be released. I haven't seen the DVD yet. Even if half the laughs were sucked away, it would still be one of the best comedies made in many, many years.
I never really considered myself a big Jeff Daniels fan, until this movie. Congrats to Jeff, Please make more like this one.",1059609600,6,1448,4.467924528301887

1900126,5,B0000A02UQ,"Hilarious. This is the movie Hollywood would never create, but Jeff Daniels doesn't let that stop him from making it himself.  It's the kind of movie that I wish I had even more to select from.",1401840000,,193,4.361111111111111

1900129,5,B0000A02UQ,"Jeff Daniels' low budget indie film Supersucker is a wonderful surprise. He stars in, directs and produces this Midwestern saga of competing vacuum cleaner (sorry for the profanity Jeff) sales teams for the Supersucker brand, winner take all.... all being the exclusive sales territory of Johnson City, Michigan. I will say the film's set up takes about 35 minutes until the 'reveal', but it's a necessary and a funny ride. Once all becomes clear, it's as funny as Monty Python, with gun-toting nuns and a very irate Dawn Wells. I will say this is not a film for children as the subject matter, at least in a world that makes sense, would not be appropriate for them. If you have a silly side, you'll love Supersucker.",1368489600,,718,4.7063492063492065
