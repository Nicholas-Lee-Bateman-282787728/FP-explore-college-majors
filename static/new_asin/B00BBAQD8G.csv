5569481,5,B00BBAQD8G,"Fantastic movie! Great story, great animation, with a superb script and voice cast. John Noble is unsurprisingly exquisite as the villainous Brainiac, but this movie also introduced me to my favorite animated Lois Lane by far as well as a sensational portrayal of Supergirl--possibly my favorite of all time. This Supergirl perfectly balances the emotional, headstrong teenager with a kickass Kryptonian, and while the current live action Supergirl is adorable and I'm a lifelong fan of Helen Slater's Supergirl, I really like this more aggressive, less human-friendly take on the character. I also like that while she's sexy, she's not over-sexified if that makes sense. Same with Lois. As far as Superman goes, I had seen a trailer of the movie and wasn't sold on Matt Bomer's voice as a match, but in context, he's actually perfect. Right up there with Tim Daly IMO. I especially loved the Fortress of Solitude scenes and Superman piloting a Kryptonian spaceship. The background art is pretty beautiful too. There's a scene in a bayou/lagoon area where I kept hoping Swamp Thing would emerge. But of course he didn't. But even so this is one I'll be watching over and over. And over. Loved it.",1489881600,3,1196,4.955223880597015

5569489,4,B00BBAQD8G,"Overall good entry in the Franchise and good to see nostalgic classic superman. Would have been good basis for a series of movies. Only problem was the ease at which Superman & Super-Girl won. I think any storyline character could have come up with that solution. Didn't exactly see the moment where superman stands triumphant and chooses not to kill his enemy, because he stands for justice etc etc, but I might have lost interest at that point",1475625600,,445,4.717948717948718

5569504,5,B00BBAQD8G,"This might be my new favorite DC animated film. It's an excellent science fiction story centering on Superman, Supergirl and Brainiac. As is often the case, the title 'Superman: Unbound' and the cover art fail miserably to hint at the charms of the film itself, leaving the viewer to furnish the benefit of the doubt. There have been several subpar-to-bad films in this series, but this is one of the very best, so I'd highly recommend giving it a chance.

As far as specifics go, again the story is really good, well written and full of emotion and suspense. The character designs are simply beautiful--I can't emphasize that enough; this has many of the best looking frames that I've seen in a DC film--and the animation in general is very good. This also features one of my favorite depictions of Lois Lane. I enjoy the mythology of Krypton and prefer these types of stories (i.e. just focusing on Superman and his related characters) to the big Justice League ensemble pieces. Not only is Unbound a bit more unified and self-contained in terms of plot, but it's really good, period.",1459987200,2,1086,4.746031746031746

So it was with suspicious anxiety that I began watching this animation movie, ready to bail out at any point.  I stayed to the end, and must say I basically enjoyed it.  What I did not feel great about was the depiction of Superman/Clark Kent and the rest of the characters, including Supergirl.  There seem to be heavy evidence of Japanese animation, especially in facial features.  I much prefer the clasic rendering of the characters found in the earlier comics.  Still, I basically enjoyed this one.",1444867200,,659,4.787610619469026

5569534,4,B00BBAQD8G,"I enjoyed it. It was a different take on an old story, a few actually regarding the Candorians, but I enjoyed this new take. It gave me a new appreciation for the Man of Steel, but Kudos to Supergirl, it was definitely her story and I wish they would have elaborated a lot more on her personal experience because she actually had an interesting role in this movie. Superman was great, I do get extremely tired with the Superman, Boy scout routine, it is becoming tiresome. I appreciate the newer Superman from Justice Leagues Wars and Throne of Atlantis, I think that character has a lot more potential than the old water down boy scout version of the Last Son of Krypton. This story was entertaining and the action continued from the beginning until the end, it just never stopped. Great animation, different from what I am used to, but none the less just as good. I would definitely recommend this movie to Superman fans.",1433376000,2,923,4.6

The animation took a while to get used to: Lois Lane and Kara Zor-el have the too big ""deer-in-the-headlights"" thing that so many Asian-influenced cartoons do which is no big deal but was the deal breaker for five stars. Otherwise, it was a ripping yarn with top-notch acting by Matt Bomer, et al and I'll be sure to eagerly await subsequent offerings by DC Comics/Warner Bros. Animation.",1428883200,2,458,4.7375
5569542,5,B00BBAQD8G,WHOSE BAD,1428796800,,9,4.0
5569543,4,B00BBAQD8G,"When Brainiac shows up and threatens to destroy Metropolis, Superman and his cousin Supergirl must rise to the occasion and put an end to a foe that has deep ties to Krypton.

This was a good flick. Hey, its Superman and lately DCs been pulling out all the stops and every time Supes gets the DVD treatment its done really well. Supergirls presence added a new dimension to the Man of Steels animated movie exploits. Giving a quick showcase of her past, what happened to Kandor, and how those events created the motivations behind the Supergirl of this movie proved that sometimes less is more. Also understanding where she was coming from gave Superman a glimpse into a part of himself that he wasn't really ready to face: the need to sometimes go hard on bad guys for the greater good. Yet, being true to who he was, he was also able to soften Supergirl around the edges, which just goes to show how much you can learn from family.

The animation was smooth, the colors were clear, the action was great and the art was fantastic. The slightly too-long-of-a-face aside, I like the way Superman looked in this. The Clark Kent was so-so. More of a fan of the thick glasses than the more stylish ones, but whatever. In the animated series he had two thin circles for frames and that was it.

Lois looked good, too. My only gripe is, while I understand these movies are being made more and more for adults, there are parents out there who buy these flicks for their kids because a) they're superheroes, b) its cartoons, and having Lois giving Brainiac the finger wasn't cool. Though I doubt itll ever happen, there should be some sort of bold labeling or disclaimer on the package aside from the MPAA rating that lets parents know if theres content inside that is inappropriate for kids. This giving the finger is why I won't let my kids see this movie now. Something for DC to think about.

As a Superman fan, Ive been loving all this attention the Man of Steel has been getting lately and since Batman was the focus of so many shows and animated features, giving the Last Son of Krypton a shot and a large amount of screen time helps balance all that out. I also hope DC has plans in the works for other animated movies for other characters, JLA stuff aside.

What can I say? DC and Warner Bros. keep knocking these flicks out of the park. Now, if they translate this awesome sensibility and sensitivity to the comics to the big screen on a consistent basis, then superhero fans will truly be living in a new golden era of superhero cinema.",1428710400,,2539,4.487012987012987

This movie, though, dropped the ball.  It just wasn't that exciting or interesting.  Superman should be bold, larger than life, and above all, a boy scout who's always trying to do the right thing.  In this he was... well, sort of passive and not very super.

5569578,2,B00BBAQD8G,"This movie is not completely terrible, but compared to many of the other DC animated movies, it falls far short. I read the Superman comics that this story was based on, and I thought they were pretty good. Unfortunately, this movie wasn't nearly as good. There were three things that I disliked about this movie:

1. The animation. The style of art used in this movie was not to my liking. The characters (especially Superman and Supergirl) looked too tall and lean and not powerful enough. I know the movies that DC has been making tend to try to mimic the artwork from the comics they are based on, but I don't recall the characters looking so stretched. Also, why are the blue hues on the two main characters' costumes so different? It would have made much more sense if they had been the same shade of blue.

2. The profanity. It seems like every new DC animated movie has two or three swear words in it. This adds no value to the movie. It only serves to make it less appealing for parents to share with their kids. Why do they keep on doing this? One hair in my sandwich isn't really going to ruin the whole thing, but I'd sure prefer it not be there in the first place! There were also a few references to sexual orientation that were thrown in for no good reason and only polluted the movie, further. Poor directing decisions!

3. Nonsensical action sequences. As I watched this movie with my 12-year-old son, we just couldn't help ourselves but laugh. We openly criticized the stupid fight scenes in the movie. We were continually asking things like ""Why did Superman just let Brainiac run across the room and punch him in the face when he could have dodged that?"" or ""If Superman can destroy all of these robots with a single blast of his heat vision, why would he choose to fight them one by one with his hands?"" or ""Why is Superman stronger than Brainiac, now, when he was weaker than Brainiac just a little while ago?"" or ""Why would a super-smart artificial intelligence not be able to think about mud and bugs with frying his circuits?"" There were far too many things that didn't make sense. Superman looked clumsy (or just stupid) at several points, and that's just not fun for me to watch. Above all else, the poor directing and execution of the action scenes really ruined the experience for me.

I know I'll never watch this one again, so I'm glad it was a copy from the library rather than a purchased item. Every other DC animated movie was at least decent. This was one I just did not like, though. There were far too many blunders in the movie that I completely blame on the director. Hopefully he won't be allowed to make any other movies for DC. I would strongly recommend AGAINST purchasing this movie. You will almost certainly regret it. Just find it at your library and watch it that way, if you must.",1412121600,2,2830,4.468085106382978

5569581,5,B00BBAQD8G,"SUPERMAN UNBOUND

As a comic fan it is hard to go through life not reading or watching anything Superman related, even if you are not a big fan of his. Still the character is so well known and the stories have been really good so most have a basic knowledge of the man. This animated film is based on the Brainiac storyline written by Geoff Johns. It was adapted by writer Bob Goodman who wrote for the excellent animated series of Batman, Superman, Batman Beyond and Justice League. He also adapted the great Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, I think he did a good job here with this transfer.

Directed by James Tucker who also worked on Batman Beyond Superman: Unbound tells the story of a lost city that one Kara came from, you may know her as Supergirl. Because of this the film actually may be hers despite her cousin getting top billing. A creature known as Brainiac once attacked her home planet which is why her parents sent her away so she would not suffer their fate. Little did she know that they actually survived because Brainiac travels to different planets and picks a city to be his. He has the technology to shrink the cities and sustain all the life there in, all he wants is their knowledge.

Superman finds out that this creature is on his way to Metropolis and finds Karas city as well as her family on board Brainiacs ship. Naturally it is up to the super cousins to stop this thing form taking Metropolis as his own.

This was a fun film that was a bit different than I thought it would be but still it was good. When on Earth the animation seems very kid friendly and fun but that changes very quickly when Brainiac is on screen. This is very much on display when on his ship, it feels very anime like with the darkness. I don't know if it is just me but I thought not just the tone but the animation felt different during these scenes. Also the voice acting is very well done as all these DC animated films are. I have to say that while Marvel rules the live action films DC has been killing it with these animated ones.

For special features you get great little docs on Brainiac and Kandor [Karas home city] as well as four episodes from the Superman animated series. Also there is a preview of the excellent next animated movie at the time Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox. I highly recommend that film because it is one of the best they have released. Then of course there is the excellent commentary which is very informative and fun. This was a really good flick, I don't think it was the best they have done but it is a really good one.",1410480000,,2574,4.365344467640918

I am actually starting to enjoy the animated films as much as the regular. Have you ever wondered just how powerful Superman truly is? This animation will give you a good place to start. This film also explains what it was like for Supergirl when she first arrived on earth and had to cope with having powers. But it is named Unbound for a reason. This film will show you what will happen if Superman no longer held back.,1408752000,,534,4.35

5569599,4,B00BBAQD8G,"These direct-to-video features have a pretty good formula at this point.  The central hero needs an emotional arc that kinda-sorta mirrors thee action of iconic comic arc.  In this case, it is Clark coming to terms with Lois as her own person while Brainiac tries to freeze the life of various worlds.  It all works together pretty well.

The action is fun and well-though out, if a bit redundant.  The voice acting is solid and the principals all have decent chemistry.  None of them save Frances Conroy is an all-timer in the role, but they are all solid.

Also loved how they introduced Brainiac and how much of a challenge her became to the Man of Steel not threatening his life but the very planet and people he held dear.  Loved Supergirl's involvement as well having her come to ease with her super powers as well as experiencing puberty so-da-speak.

The movie is very entertaining, has a great voice performance from everyone, and has a good bit of fantastic moments!

My only letdown is that they completely omitted the most emotional part of the graphic novel; Clark's relationship with Jonathan Kent and Jonathan's post-Crisis death. Seeing the humanity in Clark in the graphic novel is the thing that makes Superman so great! So sad that all of that was omitted from this animated adaptation, but the movie is still worth getting and the Brainiac special feature is really awesome!

It's pretty ridiculous considering this animated film got right in a little over an hour what most Hollywood block busters can do with hundreds of millions of dollars.
If you're not familiar with the character of Braniac or you are familiar with the villain and want to educate someone as to who the character is and why he would work so well in a live action film then look no further. The movie isn't without its flaws but they really don't drag it down too much. There are also a lot of nice special features on the disc as well.

5569631,3,B00BBAQD8G,"I have not read the original Superman issues on which this movie was based so this will be a review of just what's in the movie. Generally speaking, I'm a fan of the Warner Bros. DCU animation, going back to the original Batman animated series. This movie, though, was a bit of a letdown.

In this retelling of the Brainiac origin, Brainiac begins as a resident of Colu (homeworld of Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super Heroes). He has essentially turned himself into a cyborg and is on a quest for ultimate knowledge. As with the original Brainiac origin, this version of Brainiac vacuums up knowledge from worlds, saves the people he deems worthy of saving, then destroys the planet. He has taken Kandor, as well, along with Supergirl's parents. Also in this version, Brainiac is super-strong and nearly invulnerable.

Superman's first exposure to Brainiac occurs when a near-indestructible robot lands on Earth and he has to destroy it. A young and terrified Supergirl recognizes the robot and explains that she last saw those very same robots decimating Kandor. Worried about the threat and wondering whether Kandor might have been preserved, Superman tracks the robot back to its source and attacks Brainiac's ship and robots as they destroy another world.

Superman is captured in the battle but then disables Brainiac and his ship and flees with the shrunken bottle city of Kandor. Unfortunately, Brainiac quickly recovers and manages to track Superman back to Earth, where he attacks Metropolis. The ending is fairly interesting but, frankly, there are gaping plot holes there, as I can think of several reasons why it shouldn't have happened that way.

So how does this hold up? The animation is decent, about on par with the other Superman movies. They definitely went with a different look for Superman, as his face is longer and thinner. He's still got the muscles, though. Brainiac comes across as brutish and hulking, not the more cerebral version we've seen in the Superman and Justice League television series.

The voice acting, too, is decent, with Matt Bomer as Superman and John Noble as Brainiac. Noble's voice, in particular, is a good fit for the revised Brainiac. It's a bit over the top but that's forgivable in a movie of this type.

Where the movie falls short a bit is in the story itself. Basically, Superman gets captured, then gains heart and punches his way out. Lather, rinse, repeat... And, as I said, the final outcome just didn't work for me. I expect more from this crew, based on their track record, This is one of their less successful efforts.",1391126400,,2581,4.867881548974943

this was, mhe OK it was drawn out a bit longer

I like the DC universes ability to create
multiple universes were things happen differentially
sometimes with the same story, but this was
just.... well sigh just.

The animation was ok, the story was ok, the
drama was.... ok.

I am giving it a 4 star ratting at this time
because the last 30 min or so was just way
way way drawn out, and at $6.99 it was worth
4 starts if it had been full price at $9.99
or $14.00 or more ahh I would have not been
a happy fan.

Ok, so my personal recommendation, do NOT buy it

This one, however, while good, seems to lack something, I'm not sure what it was, but unlike some of the previous movies they've made and the movie that came afterword (the Flashpoint Paradox which is fantastic!) it just lacked something of a spark that makes the movie truly something special.  Did I like it, yes very much, but it just didn't have the same power as some of the other films.  Perhaps it could have been slightly longer or had more action, really I don't know what it was missing but something was definitely missing, just can't put my finger on it.

No big deal so far... the problem comes in with Superman's apparent loss of his fighting skills (especially ironic given the title of the movie). His new approach for close-in combat appears to be ""stand there and do nothing while the bad guy pounds you"". Not an especially effective strategy.

Overall, just an ""OK"" Superman movie; not the worst, but not the best either. You know your movie is in trouble when one of the highlights of the film is watching Lois Lane flip off Brainiac.",1375488000,,659,4.663793103448276

What really sold it was that Lois wasn't just a uppety pest but a semi reasonable person - with a bit of practical attitude.  Also this version of brainac was alot more relatable because he seemed more alive than just a machine that went rouge.",1374105600,,375,4.485294117647059
5569675,5,B00BBAQD8G,"Overall, Superman Unbound is a good/almost great movie. This is supposed to be Superman meeting the ""real"" Brainiac for the first time. If he ever met Brainiac before, that was just a robotic double. It's based on the Graphic Novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-Brainiac/dp/1401220886/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman: Brainiac</a>&nbsp;by Geoff Johns and Gary Frank. They tried to replicate the art by Gary Frank, but Gray Frank uses a realistic looking style that doesn't transfer well to animation. Especially in the faces, which appear oversimplified. Regardless, it's a reasonable plot that came out more cohesive in this adaptation when compared to the source material.

What makes this story significant, in the eyes of fans, is that this might be the last appearance of the traditional version of Superman for a long time. After this, they're going to switch to the ""New 52"" version of the character, where he wears armor. Why Superman needs armor, I don't know. In a funny coincidence, they seem to put a cap on Superman and Lois's relationship.

Even though all these movies aren't in continuity with each other, way back in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-Doomsday-Blu-ray/dp/B001ECQ5SY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman: Doomsday [Blu-ray</a>] Superman finally admitted that he and Lois are dating. Something he never admitted in neither ""Superman: the Animated Series"" or ""Justice League/ Unlimitted"". Superman: Ubound ends with Clark proposing to Lois. It's poignant, because they're not together anymore in the ""New 52.""

This is also Superman at the height of his power and experience. He has no problem ripping robots to pieces and putting out fires. He's clearly been saving the day for years, so much so that Lois never doubts that everything is under control. Which leads to the accusations that this is ""Lois and Clark"" the Movie (Based on the 90s Romantic Drama), or that somehow Superman is a wimp because he ""can't control his woman."" The theme of the movie is about ""control,"" and how it can be a bad thing. Kal-El doesn't need a hysterical woman in his life, he need a partner. Lois is completely unflappable in the face of danger, and that extends to telling Clark to his face, ""Don' tell me what I can't do.""

And for those saying Brainiac is defeated by germaphobia, I say that's a gross oversimplification of what happens. I'll also point out that ""Heart of Ice,"" the greatest episode from Batman the Animated Series, ends when Batman throws soup in Mr. Freeze's face. Thankfully he carried that thermos on his utility belt, instead of leaving it in the Batmobile.

FInally, I must say John Noble really stole the show as Brainiac. Every syllable he uttered was awesome. What makes Brainiac a great villain, is that he's the opposite of Superman. While Superman is clearly superior to humans, he likes to pretend to be one of us, and says we can be like him. To Brainiac, all are insects that at best should be kept in jars, or else just pests to be exterminated. It's a great send off to the Man of Steel.

Extras on the Bluray Include:

Audio COmmentary with the creators James Tucker(producer/ director), Bob Goodman (script writer), and Mile Carlin (creative director for DC Entertainment).

Kandor: History of the Bottle City - A history of Kandor in the comics.

Brainiac: Technology and Terror - A look at Brainiac featuring Geoff Johns and Marv Wolfman.

""The Last Son of Krypton - part 1,"" ""New Kids in Town,"" and ""Little Girl Lost - parts 1&2""

A caution, though: like many of the DCU movies this is not for small children. You may have to explain to them that Lois is not telling Brainiac that he is number one. She is not witnessing to him, either. ;-)

5569684,2,B00BBAQD8G,"An adaptation of the Geoff Johns story. First, the good: Stana Katic does a good voiceover as Lois Lane, Supergirl is more interesting (though erratic) than Superman himself, and at least Matthew Bomer seems to understand that Superman and Clark Kent ought to sound somewhat different, which comes across in his vocal performance. The not so good? The story is rather disjointed. Superman himself is fundamentally dull, and not compelling at all. And Brainiac is just not interesting, and indeed, his motivation doesn't add up to much. When you include the fact that this doesn't feature the long overdue death of Jimmy Olsen- seriously, what grown adult still uses a childish nickname- and that a respectable journalist like Perry White can't seem to figure out why Clark Kent is always gone for weeks on end when Superman is too... the entire thing is in the end rather forgettable.",1373414400,,884,4.97972972972973

Anyway, I'm sure kids would enjoy it, but I found it had some language and content that would make it not suitable for anyone under the age of 12; I'm pretty sure by that point they could see Superman: Unbound's plot holes though.

5569723,4,B00BBAQD8G,"Since his big-budget remake is about to hit theatres, it was timely that DC Universe decided to make their next release another ""just Superman"" title. Animation veteran Alan Burnett takes on as producer in this adaptation of the recent Superman: Braniac story arc from the comics by Geoff Johns, which was later collected into a graphic novel.

Set sometime after Supergirl first arrived on Earth, Superman encounters a strange alien android. After defeating it, he takes it to the Fortress of Solitude, which shocks Supergirl into remembering how the city of Kandor on Krypton was taken away by a powerful invader known as Brainiac. Fearing Earth might attacked by Brainiac, Superman heads out into space to hunt for him. After stopping him from destroying another world, Supes gets taken aboard Brainy's giant ""skulltopus"" ship, and comes face-to-face with the Martian Manhunter-lookalike himself. Brainiac shrinks Superman down into the now bottle city of Kandor, and meets Supergirl's parents. Superman manages to get big again, and takes Kandor with him back to Earth. Brainiac follows, and shrinks Metropolis. Superman and Supergirl team up to stop Brainiac, while taking on all the dangers of his ship. After pulling him literally down to Earth, Supers manages to overwhelm Brainiac with being exposed to all the elements of an actual thriving world instead of observing them within his little bottled cities. This shuts down the mad computer, although the stinger at the end indicates not permanently.

This was a well executed animated feature, and a definite step up from the Superman Vs. The Elite movie at least as far as animation quality. There were some things from this that were left out of the original story, like Pa Kent's death, and any ties to the rest of the DC Universe. Also, Superman restores Kandor on an alien planet with a red sun, instead of on Earth, which in the comic leads into the whole New Krypton story arc. The movie can be viewed as a slight sequel to Superman/Batman: Apocalypse, since it begins with a still fresh from space Supergirl, although it's apparent its trying to be its own entity. It's definitely worth a look if you're a big Superfan, but it also makes for a good sci-fi/superhero movie too.",1371081600,,2244,4.981333333333334

""Superman: Unbound"" is a perfect example of this.  The original story was excellent, but this adaptation feels a bit more rushed and poorly paced than the storyline deserves.  In particular, several art choices just don't seem to work onscreen.  Making Superman and Supergirl have slightly different blues in their costumes is interesting, but it ends up making Kara look like she's wearing purple, and Clark look like he's wearing turquoise when they're in the same scene together.  We expect Cat Grant to look sleazy, but Lois comes off looking a bit sleazy as well, with her deep neckline, miniskirt, and heavy makeup.  And our family just couldn't get past the fact that Superman's face just looked oddly gaunt throughout the whole movie.

The source had great art, better flow and a spectacular ending that set up some compelling stories about Kandor on Earth. Sadly, the best parts of the comic are left out (mainly the story would be to big and incomplete) for more drama about Supergirl's issues. Superman is 'unbound' a few times when Brainiac binds him, but the title seems too generic. I could do on how the movie was bad in my point of view, but I am sure some can do that better than me.
Here's what I liked:
Supergirl Unbound.
Lois Lane on Superman's case about their love life.
The jock voiced by the guy from 'Drew Carry show.' (You know, Batman's voice on the Brave and the Bold show).
John Noble as Brainiac.

the artwork, it's not bad. it's not that crap marvel puts out in the name of being 'cutting edge'. some aspects I'd like them to change but again, you can make it to the end. just the way it ends there more than likely be a follow up. hopefully it tightens up in that case. all this isn't to say I won't buy it.

5569757,5,B00BBAQD8G,"After one of the most incredible adaptions concluded with 'The Dark Knight Returns Pt. 2' I was very curious to see what new heights the DCAU films would attempt to reach. With that, we were given the latest film 'Superman Unbound'. At first I was a little upset that for a bit these films have been focusing on Superman and Batman, but I still have yet to be disappointed by one of these films. I think it was because of the low expectations that I got one of the most original Superman films to date.

Once again, we get a film taken from comic source material and like 'All Star Superman' this new film gives us a whole new dimension of Superman. Superman is the all around good guy as always, but we see new sides to his heart and how he deals with life love and family. The supporting cast of Lois, and regular crew is always great, and once again seeing Supergirl also add more to the total film. This is the first time Braniac is featured and his character is definitely one that makes your skin crawl in his own views towards life and the film clearly shows just how opposite he and Superman are. The film also grabs from a lot of the Superman mythos that has not really been featured in the DCAU. Examples would be the lost city of Kandor and of course the famous metal skull head ship from the late 1970s early 1980s version of Brainiac. The voice cast is one of the best as always, using unknown will usually give you a great performance. John Bomer and Molly Quinn gave us a great Superman and Supergirl, but the somewhat known John Noble gave us a true heartless villain in Brainiac.

This film is the dawning of a new age along with the stepping down of Bruce Timm from the DCAU film division. The fact that this film really focused on the person behind the costume makes me very eager to see what we will see in the future. Right now, it looks pretty promising with a new story with The Flash finally as a main character and the announcement of focusing on other heroes in future DCAU films. Let's see how this new book will be written.",1370044800,,2051,4.310880829015544

5569774,3,B00BBAQD8G,I've loved the DC Animated movies in the last few years. This isn't one of their best. I still enjoyed it though. Pretty good fights and action scenes. Story was ok but didn't have a problem with it. It was nice to see Supergirl along side. Not a big fan of this version of Brainiac. Animation is better than the last DC movie Superman vs Elite movie but not as good as recent Justice League Doom movie. It's worth owning at a cheap price.,1369353600,,439,4.238095238095238

5569776,3,B00BBAQD8G,"One of the blessings and curses of Big Two superhero comics is continuity. If you are deep into it, continuity can be a lot of fun and keeps you coming back issue after issue. But if you are a casual reader--or someone who hasn't checked out a series for awhile--it can be confusing.

Case in point: ""Superman: Unbound."" I haven't followed regular DC comics for years now, much less Superman. But I love these original animated movies. They're usually self-contained, not too ""meta"" and can be watched by a casual viewer. They don't have that high barrier of entry that most mainstream superhero comics have. But ""Superman: Unbound"" is set pretty firmly in some continuity, and that threw me for a loop at first.

Let's see ... Superman hasn't met Brainiac yet (who seems to be some merger of ""green"" Brainiac and ""robot"" Brainiac); Lois Lane knows who Superman is, but her and Clark Kent's relationship is a secret; Supergirl is actually older than Superman, but somehow younger due to a wormhole ... huh.

OK. Whatever. It's comic books, and I've been through enough ""Crisis on Infinite Earths"" and ""52s"" to roll with the continuity changes. Just be aware that unlike many DC animated movies, ""Superman: Unbound"" expects you to know a little bit about modern Superman (Depending on your definition of modern. The comic this is based on,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-Brainiac/dp/1401220878/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman: Brainiac</a>, came out in 2008. Thanks internet!)

The animation style also took me off guard at first. For reasons completely unknown to humanity, someone working on this thought it would be a good idea to model Superman after Woody from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Toy-Story/dp/B005ZMV2EQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Toy Story</a>, with a thin, lanky body and a cylindrical head. The other characters look great--Supergirl, Lois Lane, and Brainiac all look awesome--it's just Superman who looks like he wandered in from the wrong cartoon. This design choice is especially odd as I see the original comic was drawn by Gary Frank, who does amazing art. They should have just attempted to preserve his style.

Storywise, ""Superman: Unbound"" is a typical Brainiac adventure. Brainiac shows up looking to do some knowledge/world collecting, Superman steps up to the plate to punch him in the face, loses for awhile, finds his hidden strength in his humanity to defeat Brainiac's cold, emotionless logic, recovers the Bottle City of Kandor and a whole world full of miniature Kryptonians.

Even though I don't follow modern DC comics, I've been reading long enough that I have read this story before--a couple times at least. There's absolutely nothing new here, just a re-cast of the familiar, a new paint job and some pizzazz. I'm actually OK with that. The new paint is pretty, and there are a few interesting twists. I liked Supergirl as a petulant, vulnerable teenager.  She shouldn't be as ""pure"" as Superman, because she wasn't raised in the loving Kent's farm in Smallville.  She's tough without being a ""bad girl.""

I thought the Brainiac update was great as well.  Merging the ""green"" and the ""robot"" was an inspired choice, making a scary character even more menacing. It was a good nod to the past and future of the Superman mythos. And the final scene--well, I'm not really buying that it would go down that way (I have a hard time thinking a living computer would be so freaked out by bugs), but it was clever enough.

The Blu Ray has a decent collection of Bonus Features, about what I have come to expect by now from Warner Home Video.  There are two mini-documentaries on The Bottle City of Kandor and Brainiac that were both fun, but disappointing. Instead of really diving into the history of both, they really dwelt on their role in the story Superman: Unbound. I thought that was a bit of a waste--we've already bought this release, so you don't need to advertise it anymore. Give us some more depth. Tell us more about the Silver Age, the Bronze Age, all that good stuff.  That's the meat.

As always, there are a few episodes from the Superman Animated show featuring the principal characters Supergirl and Brainiac. That's some nice added material if you don't already own the series.  I personally don't, so I appreciate the extra episodes.

Watching the commercials, it looks like Flashpoint is up next for the DC animated treatment.  That's another comic that I have never read but have heard of.  I'll watch it for sure. I'm rarely let down by DC's original animated films, but I'm also rarely blown away by them.",1369353600,4,4666,5.125164690382082

The characters are there, and the action is reasonable, but there are massive weaknesses in the animation. The flight sequences involving the helicopters are janky and weird. In places, it's worse than 90s cartoons. The durability of the killer robots seemed inconsistent and puzzling. Sometimes he needs laser-vision to slice them up, sometimes he can break them up with his bare hands, and sometimes he can't.

While it might be the fault of the source material upon which the movie is based, the plot trots along to a climax that is terribly deus ex machina and in no small part ""borrowed"" from the original War of the Worlds.

Somehow, the movie even lacks dramatic weight. I thought Emerald Knights and Superman Doomsday had more gravity. It doesn't help either that Lois and Clark try to have 90s romantic sitcom in the middle of it all. Sorry, but it's either melodrama or farce. You can't have both.

5569800,3,B00BBAQD8G,"I watched this and didn't think it was that bad.  Then I went back and reread the original comics it was VERY loosely based off of.  Man, what a difference.

Now, remove all the dialogue and make up your own.  Add a 10 minute fight scene at the beginning of the movie with Superman and Supergirl vs some generic human villains.  Add another 10 minute scene with Superman inside the bottled city of Kandor, remove the tragedy at the end and replace it with a nice upbeat ending, and you'll end up with this film.

Some of the changes I can understand, for example, the film has this be the first time Superman meets Brainiac.  This makes explaining the very messy Post-Crisis back history unnecessary.  But taking out all the original dialogue removes this exchange:

Supergirl: Thanks, Ma'am.  (Catherine Grant tugs on Supergirl's cape)  Hey.
Cat: My name is not ""Ma'am""--
Supergirl: It's not like I called you an old woman or anything, lady...Well, that's strange.
Cat: What's strange?
(Supergirl stares at Cat's chest.)
Supergirl: My X-Ray vision is picking up some strange plastics in your--
Lois: Supergirl!  There you are.
..
Supergirl (later, to Lois): I think that lady needs to see a doctor--
Lois: Don't say anything else.  You don't want to antagonize HER.
Supergirl: But--
Lois: Just smile and say ""bye.""
Supergirl: Bye.

Catherine Grant doesn't get any dialogue in the film, so this whole scene is cut.

The comics had much better art, dialogue, and story.  So I'm left thinking, ""Why did they do this?  Why do an adaptation, and then deviate so much from it?  What was the thinking process?""

Well, at least we get to hear John Noble as Brainiac.

The audio and video on the DVD look and sound great. The voice acting was probably the stand out aspect of the film. Unlike some of the other films, justice league crisis on two earths as an example, all of the voices fit well with the characters. The story was good, not great and I enjoyed the action where it was intense but not so over the top like in superman doomsday. At the end of the day this film loses a star because the story could have been stronger and some if the dialogue is pretty weak, several cheesy one liners.

5569808,3,B00BBAQD8G,"Superman: Unbound is based on the graphic novel Superman: Brainiac by Geoff Johns. I've never been a fan of Johns work, because it is very prosaic and obvious with nothing new, original, or surprising thrown in. This movie is no different. This movie wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.

Story: The story was pretty thin and weak. One scene did not flow into the next very well, and many times I wondered how Superman knew to go where he went next. Every ""surprise"" and ""reveal"" was obvious and easy to see coming. Nothing surprised me. The ending when Superman defeated Brainiac was unbelievable and anticlimactic, but not unexpected since they basically gave it away in the middle of the show.

Characterizations: The character development was also week with characters going from one extreme to another rather easily (an angry, out-of-control Supergirl suddenly becomes understanding and in control for no real reason other than the plot required it). Brainiac is an uninteresting villain with no real motivation. Lois is obnoxious and unlikeable. Superman is very unsure of himself. The relationship between Lois and Clark seems very dysfunctional but magically resolves itself at the end with a proposal that just didn't fit.

Voices: The voices were interesting, but as has been noted in other reviews, Matt Bomer is a very laconic Superman. He sounds laid back even when he should be bursting with emotion. And Brainiac sounds more like King Kong than a superintellegent alien computer.

Action: The action is pretty well done and there is a lot of it. One thing that surprised me was the amount of gratuitous gore. We really didn't need to see so much blood and innards to get the point. They actually detracted.

Politics: The antibullying message felt very forced and out of place. That's nice you want to speak out against bullying, but don't shoehorn it into a movie where it doesn't fit. It makes the message sound stupid, the opposite of what you want.

Overall, if you're looking for a generic superhero flick with nothing that stands out, this will fit the bill. But if you want something exciting, something that will make you think, or something that is really entertaining, you're going to be disappointed.",1368403200,11,2228,4.959785522788204

I watched the film, got distracted and thought that I had missed the best part of the story based on the reading of the source material.

Noble was fine as Brainiac but Bomer doesn't measure up to other Superman voices.  The story is another disaster that randomly fluctuates Supermans power - at one moment easily swatted and then suddenly all powerful.

5569813,3,B00BBAQD8G,"I've been a fan of most of the Superman animated movies previously released. I liked All-Star Superman and the Batman team-ups, Apocalypse & Public Enemies. I especially liked Superman vs the Elite and the Captain Marvel short. Even the Justice League movies portrayed Superman in an enjoyable manner. Superman Unbound, however, didn't really impress. It's a movie I enjoyed enough once through, but will not likely watch again any time soon.

Based on the comic book story appearing in Action Comics #866-870 by Geoff Johns & Gary Frank, this movie tells the tale of Brainiac and the bottle city of Kandor. We learn little about Brainiac's background. His motivation is simply the acquisition of knowledge, which is a sensible goal for a man who is essentially a walking computer. The strength of the film is how Brainiac's mission intersects with Supergirl's back story, which in turn impacts and motivates Superman.

There is solid character development between Superman & Supergirl. It really is a movie about both characters, so the title is a little misrepresentation. I might even say Supergirl really is the star of this movie. She is the one who is connected to Brainiac, Kandor, and Kryptonians in general.

On the subject of the title, I'm not even sure how Superman is ""unbound."" When I think of the word ""unbound"" I think of the ending of Superman vs the Elite, which is epic. Never in the story is he really bound by anything.

There are some good action sequences in the movie, though the battles at different points in the story seem unbalanced. First, Brainiac whoops Superman. Then Superman whoops Brainiac. It's a complete 180. It's not until the final battle that any logic is applied to why one would be victorious over the other. Still the logic works and leads to a believable ending.

I'm not sure the romance subplot needed to be there. Haven't we seen enough Lois & Clark relationship woes in a million other places? Plus, superheroes denying themselves a proper relationship in order to protect the ones they love is a cliche of the genre at this point. To wrap up this subplot, Johns jumped into a big old vat of cheesy cheese that seemed a cheap way to create last-moment emotional drama.

I didn't really care for the animation style, but it didn't really impact my enjoyment of the movie. Personal preference there. It's clearly anime-inspired. At one point Superman's arm looks a mile long due to some weird perspective.

Voice acting was solid. Lois may have been a little too stiff, though that could be due to poor scripting. I'm all for Lois being the tough-as-nails reporter who will do anything to get a story, but she makes a lot of dry jokes that don't really work. With the attitude she has on the helicopter in the opening scene, you'd swear SHE was the one with superpowers. It also can come off a little annoying, because it comes off that she doesn't care what she does, because Superman will always come to the rescue. It's a little irresponsible and selfish and he seems wishy-washy in his anger over it. This is another factor that tainted the romance elements for me. Why would Superman want a woman who deliberately abuses his abilities and time to take unnecessary risks for personal gain in her career.

It's not a bad movie that does provide a solid history of Brainiac, Kandor, Supergirl, and Krypton that we don't see elsewhere in animation (that I recall). It's also a nice team-up between Superman and Supergirl. Seeing them team-up as family over a story about their origins is great. Ultimately, however, the story isn't that impressive or memorable. It lacks fun, humor, or epic storytelling. It's a rental for sure.",1368316800,23,3676,4.814580031695721

I just wanted to get that out of the way, because if you were disappointed with the comic, the movie offers way more interesting interactions and situations among the main characters.

I liked the fact that Superman and every other character really evolves during this movie. They begin very shallow, but after the adventure each of them finds a good resolution to his/her personal story.

The animation is beautiful, and the action is really well choreographed. I especially liked Superman's fighting moves against an army of robots and the one-on-one confrontation against Brainiac!

5569823,4,B00BBAQD8G,"For the past eight years, Batman received all the love at the movies when it comes to DC Comics' characters. That's all about to change on June 14 when ""Man of Steel"" hits theaters. DC and Warner Premiere aren't going to settle for TV commercials and trailers to get people pumped up. Two new comic books and a DC Universe Animated Original Movie entitled ""Superman Unbound"" are keeping the super hero fresh on everyone's minds as well.

""Superman Unbound"" serves as a tasty appetizer for the main meal coming up. The Man of Steel joins forces with his cousin, Supergirl, to battle Brainiac after the super villain shrinks down Metropolis and adds it to his collection of cities from different planets he's destroyed. Superman must find a way to keep Braniac from destroying the Earth and save all the captured cities of the universe, including Krypton's capitol Kandor.

As is usual with the DC animated movies, ""Superman Unbound"" is loaded with action from the beginning to the end. Director James Tucker and writer Bob Goodman know how to keep the pace moving at a breakneck speed and demand the audience's attention. You take a 128 page graphic novel and shove it into a 75 minute film. There's no time for the viewer to get distracted or for the movie to lose steam.

The animation for ""Superman Unbound"" differs from what we've come to expect from the DC animated features. It varies in style greatly from ""Superman vs. The Elite."" One example is the Man of Steel's facial features. The other characters look different as well.

""Superman Unbound"" is definitely a PG-13 movie. There are scenes of Braniac changing himself into a cyborg that would freak out little kids. His robots drill into the heads of their victims, which splashes a lot of blood around onscreen. Lois Lane also flips Braniac the double birds in one scene. Superman even says a bad word at one point. There are also some light sexual references most kids won't pick up on, but they're still present.

The high definition presentation of ""Superman Unbound"" is clean and sounds good. There's a little banding in the backgrounds, but nothing too distracting visually. The 5.1 surround sound will ensure that you're home theater setup will tremble and shake from the explosions and other sonic treats.

Warner treats fans to a hefty batch of special features for ""Superman Unbound."" Audio commentary is provided by Director / Producer James Tucker, Screenwriter Bob Goodman, and comic industry writer Mike Carlin. Two featurettes entitled ""Brainiac: Technology and Terror"" and ""Kandor: History of the Bottle City"" are included. Four episodes from ""Superman: The Animated Series"" are featured as well. There's a sneak preview of the next DC Animated feature, ""Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox."" In addition, a few pages of the graphic novel the movie is based on (""Superman: Braniac"") are highlighted.

The Blu-ray version of ""Superman Unbound"" is a worthy purchase for any fan of the Man of Steel. It's packed with entertaining bonus material and an action-packed feature that's a step above last year's ""Superman vs. The Elite."" What we get here is a super tag team smack down with none of the heavy-handed social commentary or politically correct propaganda we experienced last time around.",1368230400,10,3270,4.988990825688074
5569824,3,B00BBAQD8G,"I've just watched this via Amazon Prime, streamed to my laptop and displayed on my 47"" LED HD TV.  The quality of the stream was fine, with no buffering issues and very good quality video and audio.  For Amazon's part, I'll give it a 5/5.
As for the film itself, overall I was underwhelmed.  Molly Quinn and Stana Katic both did fantastic with their voice work, and John Noble as Brainiac worked quite well.  Matt Bomer did well as Clark, but his Superman lacked the oomph I was looking for.  I wasn't impressed with the animation style, as it felt more like late 80's or 90's anime than something from this decade.  The story was very ""been there, done that"" with no real fresh take on the characters or the concept of Brainiac and The Bottled City of Kandor.  While it had plenty of action, the better scenes were the interactions of Lois with Clark or Kara.  I am at least glad this was set in the ""pre-Flashpoint"" era of the DC Universe.  That being said, I rarely give 5 stars to any movie, as there is usually something to improve upon.  This one doesn't even make 4 stars for me.  It failed in a lot of ways.  But, as LeVar Burton might say, don't take my word for it.  A $4 rental is a fair price to pay for this, but I wouldn't buy it.",1368144000,,1244,4.220338983050848
5569825,4,B00BBAQD8G,"DC has gotten really good at making these cartoon movies. You would think that they would be for kids, but when really get into them, they have enough content for adults to. I loved that scene where Lois flipped Brianiac the twin birds. The animation is okay, it's not on the level of Katsuhiro Otomo, but who really is? As someone of African-Amerikan decent, I would love to see DC do some toons that include their many ""Black"" super heroes like Icon and Black Lighting. Furthermore, I'd love to see some that star their more obscure characters like the Question or John Constantine. The one negative about this is the price to own it. I'll be looking for more of these in the future",1368144000,2,684,4.524193548387097
5569826,4,B00BBAQD8G,"Now I never read ""Superman: Brainiac"" so I cannot compare the two but I do think that this animated feature is pretty well made. I read some reviews stating that this film was ""horrible"" and ""cheesy"", and I wanted to see for myself if this was actually the case. After watching it; there was no doubt that this is another good DC animated film. There was nothing cheesy about it. The filmmakers never over-saturated any element and the pace was really good as well. This version of Brainiac is very sinister and has this complex that draws you into his character enough to dislike him. Due to time constraints, the animated features are not drawn solely from the graphic novels because of the different odds and ends that cannot be explained and then brought together later. You can see this in the other films, and sometimes it hurts the films and other times it works. Now this is not the greatest animated feature from DC but, along with ""Superman vs The Elite"", it's one of their best stand-alone Superman efforts. It can also be said that this film is definitely better than Marvel's Ironman anime, ""Rise of Technovore"".",1368144000,,1125,4.686868686868687
5569827,2,B00BBAQD8G,"The DC Comics animation library is a mixed bag.  For the most part, it's hard to recognize whether these newly released direct-to-video animation films are meant to entertain viewers or to just make a quick studio money grab.  Often coinciding with live action theatrical releases, it' difficult to ignore the timely release dates of direct-to-video films in order to give them their fair shake.  In 2008, Warner Bros. released Batman: Gotham Knight (a mere 10 days prior to The Dark Knight ), which supposedly bridges the gap between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight - even though it officially has no place in the Christopher Nolan universe.  Huh?  Yeah, that's exactly the point.  The following summer, it happened again with the straight-to-video release of Green Lantern: Emerald Knights, which was released a week prior to the theatrical debut of Green Lantern, starring Ryan Reynolds.  While there have been some well-received DC animated films, like Batman: Under the Hood and Green Lantern: First Flight, it's hard to imagine Superman: Unbound receiving a fair trial in that regard, especially with the release of Man of Steel only a month away.

Based on Geoff Johns' Brainiac storyline from 2008's Action Comics, Superman: Unbound focuses on Superman (voiced by Matt Bomer) and his first interaction with Brainiac (voiced by John Noble).  While in a strenuous relationship with Lois Lane (voiced by Stana Katic) and helping to raise his cousin Kara/Supergirl (voiced by Molly Quinn), Clark Kent/Superman is suddenly thrust into action when a scout robot falls from outer space.  After Kara sees the robot, she identifies it as being controlled by Brainiac, a knowledge-collecting entity that pillages planets (including Krypton) for information, and taking major cities as a souvenir (putting them in a display bottle).  In his encounter with Brainiac, Superman discovers that the former capital of the destroyed planet of Krypton, Kandor, is in Brainiac's possession (Kyptonian citizens included).  With the fate of Metropolis and Kandor hanging in the balance, Superman and Supergirl must find a way to defeat Brainiac and free the cities before they are destroyed.  The voices of Frances Conroy (Martha Kent), Wade Williams (Perry White), and Alexander Gould (Jimmy Olson) also star in supporting roles.

For the comic book readers out there, this version of Superman is not of the `New 52' variety.  What does that mean exactly?  In the comic book world, Superman/Clark Kent is married to Lois Lane - or at least they were before DC decided to completely reboot their universe in 2011.  Dubbed the `New 52,' Superman and Lois Lane were split up and are no longer together.  However, in the newly released Superman: Unbound film, Lois and Clark have been dating (presumably for quite a while), but it's still a secret - even from their co-workers.  The plot of this film seemingly picks up at random, picks and choose what information to use from past comic book story-lines, with no other ambition other than to introduce Brainiac (which is a character that's already been around for more than 50 years).  At the same time, this new animated film isn't a reboot, like All Star Superman - rather just another typical Smallville-like story where Superman is roaming around outer space and pleading with his cousin (Supergirl) to relax.

As far as character development goes, Brainiac is the only character that's of any real interest over the course of the film.  John Noble gives the character a methodic tone that really establishes Brainiac as a super villain that should be taken seriously.  However, Brainiac never becomes a serious concern for Superman at any point, since Superman apparently could have disposed of the super-villain early on in the film - but it's really hard to justify the purchase cost of a plot that only needed to be a 25 minute Superman: The Animated Series episode.  This happens to be one of those stories where it might have been more interesting if there was another villain plotting against Superman at the same time - say Lex Luthor or Bizzaro.

The film's characters leave a great deal more to be desired in the development department, not to mention it's pretty bothersome to see Lois Lane flying the double bird at Brianiac, and an implication that Clark Kent is gay.  Combine those segments with the violence, hard language, and bloodshed, and it quickly becomes a film that parents probably shouldn't be showing to kids (but that's a judgement).  Aside from those bothersome encounters, the general direction of the plot is still in limbo, mostly because screen writer Bob Goodman has the story taking place at random, without any clear character back-story.

Since this film is based off a popular comic book storyline (only 5 issues long, though), it doesn't veer off from its original course too much.  In the comics, the Brainiac plot is famous for killing off Pa Kent (for about the eighth time total if you include the comics/movies/television), however, Unbound features a much different subplot and a much less depressing plot at that.  Obviously, you'll get no spoiler ending here, but let's just say is the door wide open for a sequel.  In fact, there's really no need to even say the door is wide open - it basically guarantees a sequel.

Overall, the film hardly stands out over previous Superman animation endeavors, but there's enough action and plot drama to sustain interest over the course of the film (barely).  At the same time, the poor animation is a hang-up.  It's certainly no Pixar, making it difficult to lower the bar for this viewing experience, largely due to the fact there's even superior television animation out there (ex. Star Wars: The Clone Wars).  Superman: Unbound is only a must see for Superman fans, but everyone else is encouraged to buy the Superman: Brainiac graphic novel instead, which is much more enjoyable.

Overall Grade:  D+

The action is slick and clever, and we get to see Superman really unleash on Brainiac. Superman is in fine form, if nothing new, but we do see a new side to Kara aka Supergirl as she shows us a being who lived without Superman's amazing powers and knows more about fear than he can due to never being ""powerless"" on earth. We also get to see a spunky Lois Lane and Clark dynamic that I feel has always been a gem of the animated movie line-up. If you like Superman, and you like your action with some heart, this is one worth watching!
However our viewing was disrupted many times due to Amazon's Instant streaming system.

5569834,4,B00BBAQD8G,"Superman: Brainiac is one of my favorite stories. Written by Geoff Johns, it was the first appearance of Brainiac in modern continuity in the comics. It was an emotional story and now it is adapted in animation for general audiences to see what Brainiac has become in the books.

I really enjoyed this movie. Not much background is needed to enjoy it, either in the comics or when watching this. Superman and Kara (Supergirl) are attacked by a droid that turns out to be a scout searching for worlds to collect as specimens. Kara recalls how before she escaped Krypton, Brainiac sent similar droids to attack her city (KANDOR) then removed it from the planet as a souvenir for his collection. Now that these droids have appeared again, they fear that Metropolis may be Brainiac's next victim. Determined to prevent the past from repeating itself, Superman plans to find Brainiac and stop him before he is able to steal any more worlds. What follows afterward is an interesting look at the characters Clark, Kara, and Lois and how they each deal with fears associated with protecting loved ones.

Character development is shallow with the exception of Brainiac, but some witty dialog and humor make up for it. This should have not been rated PG-13 however. The animation is solid during action scenes, but otherwise the characters (again with the exception of Brainiac) look odd.

All in all, pretty entertaining. Matt Bomer of ""White Collar"" is Superman and would have made a good choice for a live action Man of Steel. Is this movie worth a watch? Yes. Go ahead, check it out.",1367971200,,1577,4.790441176470588

Unbound stayed true to the character while making him more relatable to a contemporary audience. I particularly liked how the  themes of this film were concrete, well written and had actual depth. If you want action, there's plenty of it.

 If you want character development, there are great threads for Louis & Clark, as well as a nice arc for Kara. I've read Geoff Johns' and Gary Franks graphic novel, from which this film was pulled, and like the changes the director decided on. The core of the story is essentially the same, but with some of the fat trimmed. Superfluous characters were ushered to the back bench, but they never played a vital role in the original run anyhow. The additions will make it new enough for die-hards, whilst leaving the story intact and manageable for newbies. My biggest gripe with ALL-STAR SUPERMAN was that they tried to fit in too much, and it felt schizophrenic as a result. No such problem here.

Now, I've heard some people have had issues with the animation, but I honestly cannot understand why. Clean lines, expressive characters, with a great sense of speed and urgency. No complaints from this viewer.

She sounded more man than Superman.. :) The original voice actors,Tim Daly,Kevin Conroy,Susan Eisenberg,ect.(Bruce Greenwood was a really good Batman also) are also the gold standard for voicing these characters. I do notice that the voice actors go hand in hand with the 2nd rate movies. The story started out decent,especially when Superman was posed a challenge by the 1st robot he encounters. After that,they seemed easily destroyed,doesn't make sense. The way brainiac was written was pretty bad. Superman never seemed to be in much trouble. When you see Superman/Supergirl are both needed to defeat Darkseid in Apocalypse,last time I checked,brainiac isn't defeated by sounds and mud. Terrible writing. He said he had the knowledge of thousands of worlds,but he doesn't know what bugs sound like? Terrible ending,it has its moments,but,its a renter for sure. Its like they really put effort in one movie ,then the next one is for some new people to try out,writing and voice actor wise.

Lois is pressuring him to take their relationship to the next level while Clark struggles to reign in his Cousin Kara aka Supergirl. When Brainiac a Ghost from the past shows up Kara tells Clark of the final days of Kandor the Capital city of Krypton. How Brainiac using his massive ship made it vanish off the face of the planet. Clark leaves Earth in order to face the threat and to discover the fate of Kandor.

What I really loved about this movie was the voice cast, it features actors from some of my favorite tv shows;

Castle:
Stana Katic (Detective Kate Beckett) as Lois Lane
Molly Quinn (Alexis Castle) as Kara Zor-El

White Collar:
Matt Boomer(Neil Caffery) as Clark Kent

Fringe:
John Noble (Walter Bishop) as Brainiac",1367280000,2,792,4.717391304347826
5569844,1,B00BBAQD8G,"DC Animation was on a hot streak with the two Dark Knight Returns movies.
Both were interesting, stylized, and well-conceived.

That streak has hit an end with Superman Unbound; a movie that literally does everything wrong with the Superman Universe.

The sappy soap opera romance between Clark and Lois made me want to vomit.
The ""with a nice little bow on top"" story  made me cringe over and over.
The style and animation were both horrific.
Superman made bone-headed tactical decisions several times.
Braniac's undoing being due to germophobia was ridiculous.

I just hated everything about this movie.
All-Star Superman was terrible because it was way too out there (Atlas then Samson then mole people then ancient egyptian gods)
This was terrible because it was way too safe, corny, campy, and dumb.

Please pass on this.",1367193600,12,826,5.044117647058823
5569845,1,B00BBAQD8G,"This is probable one of the most ridiculous storyline I have ever read from DC.

=====Spoiler Alert==== (This spoil should be more of a Godsend than a warning)

What happened to the days when Superman was a man and Lois was a woman?  I miss those days.  The days when you could escape into a world where women didn't hate men and men weren't attracted to women who do.  I have watched most, if not all, of DC animation movies and this one was so bad I had to research its origin.

The story is written by Geoff Johns.  Now, I haven't read his other works so this could be just a whiffed swing at the plate, but I did have to check his gender because he writes more feminine than masculine.

Let's start with Lois.  Man-hating-feminists-of-the-world-unite!  When did Lois move from spunky reporter to man hater?  Nearly every scene she was in made me literally sick to my stomach.  She was so bitter and nasty that it was hard to focus on the plot when she spoke.  I guess the author wanted to make her tough sounding, but he only succeeded in making her sound like a cat-loving old hag in training.  This is one reason why I am forced to preview Marvel/DC animation movies before/if I allow my kids to watch them.  Sad.

Now let's talk about Brainac, one of Superman's most powerful enemies, brought down by getting dirty....literally.  The author has Brainac incapable of handling getting muddy. This was such a feminization of Brainac; it would not have felt out of place if he broke down in tears during the final fight because he broke a fingernail.  Seriously? When did writers become so lazy that ""dirt"" becomes the plot key?

Next let's look at Kara, a very wholesome looking girl who is mad at the world.  When Superman goes off, she wages a world war on crime, which is fine, but the author gives the impression that she is doing this to either prove something or blow off this huge amount of anger that she has.  The author tries to hide this by lines like, ""she's the typical teenager"" and other similar thoughts.  I have never seen a girl this angry.  ""Doesn't know her own strength""? I have never encountered a girl that could physically hurt someone on accident.  Boys yes; girls no.  They just don't have the upper body strength.  Now Geoff can say that she is Supergirl, but then you can't call her the ""typical"" teenager.  Contradictions like this indicate the author is pushing some kind of agenda, not logic.

Last but not least, let's address Superman, the punching bag for Lois's sharp tongue.  It's not that Lois has to fawn over Superman, but a thank you would be nice.  The author shrouds her anger in some kind of boundary issue that she states, but, if Wonder Woman saved me, I don't think I would hesitate to say thank you.  If my wife spoke to me this way, I would have serious reservations about her mindset towards our marriage.  Common courtesy is a foundation.  Lois is not only rude, but she implies that Superman's rescues are mandatory. And he sits there and takes it.  No, ""Hey Lois, a thank you would be nice."" Nothing.  No man that I know of is going to sit and take a tongue lashing just to appease someone else, female or not.  Of course there are ""males"" that do act as doormats, but then again, they're not really men now are they?

I don't know if the author is planning a coming out party or not, but if this is how his other stories are written, then I'd say don't waste the money on a party, it's already evident.  I hope that in the future DC will write stories where men as men and women are women.  Neither needs to be subservient to the other, just have a little respect for each other.

To end on a positive note, the animation was decent.  Obviously anime inspired but not overly done. Of course the graphic nature of the opening scene and one or two other scenes means it's a no-no for kids but besides that it was pretty good.",1367193600,11,3880,4.423728813559322
5569846,5,B00BBAQD8G,"I really can't get enough of these animated superhero movies, especially when it involves Superman and one of his most powerful enemies Brainiac.  The story focuses on Supergirl trying to adjust to life on earth as a teenager.  Superman has been on earth just about all of his life and was raised by parents who loved him and he has had time to adjust and find himself.  Kara however has only been on earth for a few months and is having issues with trying to fit in.  To her she was just on Krypton and now on another planet with vast powers and abilities.  The villain in this film is the all powerful Brainiac, part cyborg, part flesh, but all evil, and a slightly different adaption of him.

Brainiacs sole purpose is to gather the knowledge from every person in the galaxy and then keep a sample of each planets major cities and inhabitants and then destroy their planet, thus one day becoming the most powerful being in the universe.  He does this by sending out thousands of drones whose sole purpose is going to each planet to see what they might have to offer.  Naturally they finally make their way to Earth, and Superman goes to investigate.  Supergirl then tells Superman that they have been to Krytpon before and what this beings is fully capable of and she beleives he is responsbile for destroying Krypton but not before collectiong the capital and it's inhabitatnts.  She tells Superman it's unlike anything he or she has ever encountered.  Superman knows that in order to stop Braininac, he must take the fight to him to keep Brainiac from coming to Earth and possibly sharing the same fate as Krypton.

I found the animation and pace of the movie to be fantastic, and the audio was very good too.  The movie is rated PG-13 for language, blood, and some adult humor.",1367107200,3,1783,4.569182389937107

5569849,5,B00BBAQD8G,Great animation! Great story line! Non stop action! New twist on Brainiac. I like Kara Superman's cousin. She adds a great addition to the story of good versus evil. Excellent job to the creators of this Superman animation!,1367107200,,223,4.894736842105263
5569850,2,B00BBAQD8G,"*Movie Review, not BluRay*
Compared to other DC animations coming out lately this one definitely sinks to the bottom. The voice acting was sub par, the story pacing was very off, and the animation was just downright lazy which is probably my biggest gripe about it. Whereas Batman Year One, All Star Superman, and The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 & 2 put effort in the animation and landscapes to create a much more tangible world with it's own distinct mood and atmosphere this looks like it was a school project. I can understand that the characters looked the way they did out of the artists own style, but the actual overall look of everything is just downright sloppy. If not just to compare this to the other DC Animated movies coming out and just all animations in general, I'd like to point out that Akira came out roughly 25 years ago. I understand that that is a gross comparison, but what I don't understand is after all that time animators now have the blessing of using computers to animate but use it as an excuse to hash things out quickly rather than using the tools they have to truly make an animated movie look remarkable and jaw dropping like Akira was, which was all hand drawn. This leads me to believe this movie was made with absolutely no soul to it and was just a quick cash draw from the Man of Steel hype this year. Despite the PG-13 rating, buy this for your 7 year old and not yourself if you are an adult fan of the DC universe.",1367020800,4,1457,4.380073800738008
5569851,3,B00BBAQD8G,"I have to say this is rather average on run of DC Animated movies that have come out. It was not without its problems. While I think the animation style was rather clean, Lois Lane had very evil looking eyes, and Superman...well he looked like Elvis. I wasn't fond of the Superman vs the Elites design either, but in the Elites case, I found the story rather compelling. I can't say I found the story to be as compelling. One of the other issues I had was the relationship between Clark Kent and Lois. Some parts were amusing, but it felt like the chemistry of why these two belong together was off. I found Lois rather irritating and overly selfish and at times she used Kent without any care. If you look at their relationship in other DC animations like All Stars and Elites, the chemistry was there and even seeing the characters at their core and understood why they belong. Here Lois, seems she takes advantage of Superman's powers and it was all about ""her her her"" Ironically when the ending came about, I only was happy because I like those two characters together, than this movie setting the stage as to why these characters need to be together.

Of course that's just the romance angle. The storyline with Brainiac and Supergirl were still downplayed. I did like the design of Braniac, but there just wasn't a good emotional urgency or meaning to this storyline. I do admit there were times that I winced due to some of the violence, but there was just something that didn't make you connect to the story very well. I'm also not going to lie and there were some good fight scene moments between Brainiac and Superman.

If I were to Rank this in line with the other DC movies primarily featuring Superman from best to least It would be as follows

Superman/Batman Public Enemies
All Star Superman
Superman vs the Elites
Superman/Shazam
Superman/Batman: Apocalypse
Superman Doomsday
Superman Unbound",1366761600,13,1909,4.675595238095238
5569852,2,B00BBAQD8G,This animated feature has some good artwork but ultimately I found the story to be very dull and thus the low rating. I've seen every other DC and Marvel animated movie and would rank Superman:Unbound as among my least favorites of them all. There is just no sense of real suspense and thus no excitement in any of the battles or predicaments Superman/girl get themselves into.
