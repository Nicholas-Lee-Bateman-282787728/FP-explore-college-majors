8170221,2,B000MN2FB2,"This is not a very high quality product.  A smattering of Olympic footage which just leaves you wanting more, and then 20+ minutes of abysmal Detroit propaganda films from the 60's.  Kinda funny to see, but not recommended unless you are searching for ""old sound bytes"" for a DJ compilation or something like that, in which case the Detroit footage has some pretty good ""1950's voice"" type stuff.",1217548800,,396,4.8088235294117645
