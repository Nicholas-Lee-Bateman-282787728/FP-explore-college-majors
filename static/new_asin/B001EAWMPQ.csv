3547691,5,B001EAWMPQ,"There are two sides to this set:it's a great thing for new fans who don't already have the film discs(this would've been perfect for me...8 years ago),and it's so-so for those of us who have half of this set already. I found it at Blockbuster,so I figured I'd give it a try,and the extras are pretty cool,but I don't think they are worth $130 imho. Lynch should've just re-released the feature films in 2-disc special editions and then released the new stuff in this green set as a 3 disc set or something;that would've given people more choice and,ultimately,more people would be apt to buy a cheaper green set w/3 discs vs 10.i really don't see many people getting this set unless they are 150% completists or $130 is a drop in the hat.still though,5 stars because to any new fans this is an absolute treasure trove!",1233360000,4,818,4.571428571428571
3547692,2,B001EAWMPQ,"All us Lynch fans have most of this stuff already. The only selling point is the Mystery Disc and the Industrial Symphony, which has finally been transferred to DVD(please, sell this as a stand-alone item!). Not worth the huge price tag.",1232841600,8,237,4.804878048780488
3547693,5,B001EAWMPQ,"The Lime Green Set will appeal to those already familiar with Lynch's products but who do not yet own some of the work. Interviews and extra features are also included. Although The Set is not a complete filmography, it contains a variety of experiences, from Eraserhead to Dumbland, well worth the price of admission. Some pieces are not for the squeamish, but the jokes are funny, really. And never try to watch a Lynch film on a cell phone.",1231286400,3,443,4.620253164556962
3547694,4,B001EAWMPQ,"If you're a cinephile who is either just getting into Lynch or would like to, then this set would be a great purchase. It's got four of his older masterpieces: Eraserhead, The Elephant Man, Blue Velvet, and Wild at Heart. If you don't have these already, then this is a great buy with enough great extras to justify the price tag. And trust me - this is five-star material. David Lynch is one of the greatest artists in American cinema, and any film aficionado should familiarize themselves with his work.

Unless you're rolling in money, though, this set just isn't worth the cash for people like me who have already seen these four movies. I'm lucky enough to have a very well-stocked local library which already has the Lime Green Set, so I was able to check it out without plunking down the money. I already own copies of the four major films in this set as well as the ""Short Films"" DVD.

This set really does have some very nice extras that were never previously released. The new deluxe editions of ""The Elephant Man"" and ""Wild at Heart"" are fantastic, as is the brand-new 5.1 sound mix on this edition of ""Blue Velvet."" One reviewer already went through the contents of the mystery disc in thorough detail, so I won't bother to repeat it. ""Industrial Symphony No. 1"" was very interesting to see. I had never previously seen ""Dumbland,"" and while it's hardly Lynch's best work, it certainly does reflect his absurd sense of humor and is worth checking out.

Bells and whistles aside, it's just not worth the price tag if you've already got the main four films. If you don't have it already, I would recommend picking up the ""Short Films of David Lynch"" DVD, as there is some very interesting material on that. That'll only cost you $20, though, and the rest of the extras, while very nice, are just padding.

In conclusion - if you don't have the four movies, pick it up. If you do, either rent it, check it out of a library if yours has it, or just wait a year or two for the price to drop to something a little more reasonable. However I will say that besides the Eraserhead disc, which is identical, these are the best releases yet of each of the films included.",1230854400,30,2172,4.4772727272727275
3547695,5,B001EAWMPQ,"I have just received my copy, and I am pleased overall with my purchase...I do have a few of the films separately, but to have the extras was worth the purchase, especially Industrial Symphony #1 which I own on VHS...My only minor issue...is the packaging...it is the same as the Twin Peaks Gold Set, but the box is somewhat flimsy, and the same with the inside cardboard sleeve that houses the dvds in their trays...You will have to take great care when removing and inserting the sleeve into the box set...other than that...this is a must for any Lynch admirer out there...and yes I would also like to see a ""sequel"" set, with his other films...like ""Lost Highway"" in WIDESCREEN!!!!!!",1228348800,3,686,4.725
3547696,4,B001EAWMPQ,"This 10-disc set, released by Lynch's label Absurda, is a mixed bag.  Sadly, it is far from comprehensive.  Among the 10 discs are such features as BLUE VELVET, WILD AT HEART, THE ELEPHANT MAN, and ERASERHEAD.  In addition, INDUSTRIAL SYMPHONY #1, SHORT FILMS OF DAVID LYNCH, and DUMBLAND are included on their own platters.  An ELEPHANT MAN extra disc features a documentary about the real elephant man, along with stand-alone interviews with John Hurt and Lynch.  The Hurt interview appears to be recent, the Lynch one looks archival.  A MYSTERY DISC is also included, which is chock full of various goodies, including episodes are RABITS (as seen in INLAND EMPIRE). Finally, there is a CD soundtrack for ERASERHEAD.

For Lynch enthusiasts, this set is a must.  Personally, I would have enjoyed seeing the inclusion of all of his feature films to date.  Maybe those are coming in another color-themed set (???).",1227744000,11,913,4.993377483443709
8297343,5,B001EAWMPQ,Any fan of good cinema or in particular David Lynch should have the Lime Green Set.,1508803200,,83,4.25
8297344,5,B001EAWMPQ,Arrived on time and in excellent conditions. The mystery disc is really good. Industrial Symphony No 1 is great. Excellent material in general. I am very pleased with the purchase. Thanks,1432684800,2,187,5.064516129032258
8297345,5,B001EAWMPQ,"I'm not sure what I could say about David Lynch that hasn't been said before, so I'm not even going to try to do that. What I can say is that the Lime Green box is truly a cinematic treasure to own. What really stands out to me is that it is a satisfying summation of David Lynch's filmography, and the range of works is astounding. To explain, this collection contains his earliest works from the late 60s and 70s (which were extremely surreal and often abstract) all the way to his more ""Hollywood"" style movies during the 80s and 90s. If you want to start a David Lynch collection, or if you want to properly introduce David Lynch to someone else, this is probably the best way to start. It's obviously not for everyone, but the rest of us can truly enjoy the masterpieces and absurdities contained in this awesome pack!",1348444800,2,823,4.421052631578948
8297346,5,B001EAWMPQ,"The artwork and deleted scenes from Wild at Heart alone make the price worth it. Even you already own the other DVDs, they are most likely not the remastered versions. Plus lots of bonus extras on the mystery DVD like a short clip of David Lynch greeting the Twin Peaks Festival that can only be viewed at the fest otherwise. I have been able to collect celebrity signatures on this set which makes it even more invaluable to have in one set. Amazing!",1346112000,2,451,4.445783132530121
8297347,1,B001EAWMPQ,"We've got Eraserhead, Elephant Man, Blue Velvet & Wild At Heart. Extras are the same, but, we get new extras for Elephant Man, that Industrial Symphony & a bonus ""mystery disc.""

Problem is, we've already seen most of this before. The mystery disc, & the 5.1 new sound track on Blue Velvet is the only real thing of interest. I didn't care for a good majority of the contents on the mystery disc, but I'll admit others would find them interesting. And I have no interest in that symphony thing, but others would.

The Eraserhead soundtrack, Dumbland, & the Short Film set were completely unnecessary. Lynch could have easily included new interviews with people who worked on Eraserhead, or done brand new interviews on Blue Velvet, but he made no such effort. There was no excuse to release some of these never before released things (Wild At Heart + deleted scenes, Elephant Man + new extras, Blue Velvet + 5.1 track & new interviews, or Industrial Symphony) on their own. This is obviously a George Lucas style cash grab, & this isn't surprising considering he charged an extreme amount to ship internationally from his old website. Lynch should be ashamed of himself.",1334275200,3,1170,4.787128712871287
8297348,2,B001EAWMPQ,"About a year ago, I ordered this set at least twice, maybe three times, from independent sellers and once from Amazon.  Every time except once the plastic cases for the DVD's were completely crushed in shipping. Also, the Blue Velvet disc vibrates horribly and very nearly ruined my DVD player.

The Blue Velvet error happened with ALL copies of the set I purchased, even replicating on computers and other DVD players owned by my friends.

I contacted ABSURDA who acted shocked that this happened.  I sent the disc to them and they sent me a replacement disc that was STILL defective.

BEWARE.",1289260800,8,594,4.784313725490196
8297349,5,B001EAWMPQ,"This is like a great gift from god. I only wish another box was coming. I carry this around with me if I go anywhere that has a television and DVD player. If your a Lynch fan, you'll love this. Definitely one of those prized possession type things.",1285113600,,248,4.1875
8297350,5,B001EAWMPQ,"Even though this boxset is a bit expensive, it's still a gem in the collection of any fan of David Lynch's work. Focusing on the first portion of his career (sans Dune, which he refuses to talk about during interviews), this boxset manages to improve the experiment by providing extras available in no other DVD set, such as an additional hour sixteen of Wild at Heart footage, several features for The Elephant Man and a number of goodies in the tenth disc, referred to as the ""Mystery DVD"".",1253404800,3,492,4.6022727272727275
8297351,5,B001EAWMPQ,"I give THE LIME GREEN SET five stars because, simply put, it is a five star set.  It includes four signature feature films from the first half of David Lynch's career, each of which is excellent and unique, yet pure Lynch (I assume DUNE isn't included due to rights issues and/or Lynch's own dissatisfaction with the movie).  The Short Films, Dumbland, Industrial Symphony No. 1, and much of the content on the ""Mystery Disc"" are all fascinating pieces of experimental cinema.  The brief ""Elephant Man Extras"" disc includes an informative and intriguing documentary that compares the movie to the real life of Joseph ""John"" Merrick, as well as compelling interviews with David Lynch and John Hurt (yes, it would have been nice to have input by Anthony Hopkins).  The only disc I have not played yet is the revamped ERASERHEAD soundtrack, which has a bonus third track.  Overall, I already had roughly half of what's in this set, and frankly, the $180.00 retail price tag was very steep, even for someone who didn't have anything included in the set.  But if you can get it at a 30 or 40% discount, it's absolutely worth it.",1238198400,,1123,4.733333333333333
8297352,5,B001EAWMPQ,"I suppose reviews should review the item as is, rather than dwelling on how it could have been.  As others have mentioned, this is a strange box set.  It can't really be seen as David Lynch 1970-1990 because it's missing 1984's Dune and it contains some gear shot very recently.  But it does contain his signature films from that period.  And that's the important thing.  The four feature films contained in The Lime Green Set are absolute classics, the best of Lynch's career my opinion.  Lost Highway and Mulholland Dr are terrific also, but not quite as beautiful and riveting as the awesome foursome Eraserhead, Elephant Man, Blue Velvet and Wild at Heart.  So while this box set is a bit of an uncategorable ragbag, it's the greatest Lynchian uncategorable ragbag imaginable.  I already owned Eraserhead, Blue Velvet and Wild at Heart, but went ahead and bought the box anyway.  I'm not unhappy with this expensive choice.

It was fun to see the Industrial Symphony No. 1 for the first time, presented here in the highest quality possible (it looks like it was shot on video, but has been nicely cleaned up).  I had never seen The Short Films of David Lynch before; it's powerfully fascinating to see the master incrementally honing his craft.  The Eraserhead soundtrack is the most unusual soundtrack CD in existence - essentially three epic mood tracks.  The Elephant Man extras are interesting. Dumbland is plain dumb, which was the point I guess, but it's so lame, so so lame, but it's the only lame entry in the collection.  The Mystery Disc is mixed.  I was thrilled with the Wild at Heart deleted scenes, all 75 mins of them.  The rest is mainly Lynch shorts from throughout his career - some are interesting, others feel very frivolous, like Lynch is parodying himself.

So in conclusion:  I'd have liked for Dumbland to have been replaced with something better, perhaps Pretty as a Picture or Lynch (One) or another documentary on the director's method, and some of the shorts on the Mystery Disc are not so great, but everything else on board The Lime Green Set is sheer quality.  Please buy it.",1234656000,13,2110,4.747252747252747
