The repition of the phrases alone helps the child to hear the words and practice saying them as they hear them.  A video to be watched over and over again.,1231200000,,277,4.52
8235828,5,B000ZKGGX0,"My niece (age-6 adopted from China) has enjoyed all of Mei Mei's Play and Learn Videos and plays at least one of them daily, but Volume 6, ""Let's Play Games"" is by far her favorite!  She has weekly play dates with four close frends (two adopted from China) and the first thing they ask for when arriving at her home is ""the game DVD"". They play it over and over again for the two hours they are there!
MeiMei knows how to captivate a child's attention with her delightful,upbeat personality and her endless energy!  It's a pleasure to watch them being taught Mandarin in such a fun and practical way!",1230422400,,600,4.445454545454545
8235829,5,B000ZKGGX0,"Our daughter adores Mei Mei. She's three and we owe a lot to Mei Mei's videos in heightening her appreciation for her Chinese heritage. She loves watching this video and the other Mei Mei videos. The voice and music is clear. The video is great, as it provides a great sense of how life is for children playing in China. Our daughter loves playing the different games, acting out the dances, identifying herself with certain girls in the video, and picking up words by which she describes her experience. Mei Mei has wonderful videos. I encourage you to buy a few. You'll learn a lot, too.

We have several hundred dollars' worth of Mandarin language tools at our house, including books, tapes, CDs and videos. The common thread among them all is low production value: poor video and audio, and/or limited effectiveness from a language acquisition perspective. I've learned that it's pretty much a crapshoot when purchasing many items. I think of it as a `faith-based' effort to locate the perfect language support for my adopted daughter and myself. I keep trying, and pull what I can from each item.

The 'Play and Learn' series by Mei Mei Hu, although good in many respects, are generally just a step above the 'home movie' category. Mei Mei has Montessori training and definitely knows kids, and she provides some well-informed language modeling in places, but two things would greatly improve the series and earn this and other Mei Mei videos 4-5 stars:

1. Focus on basic production values. This particular video suffers from audio and video tracks that are out of sync with one another. Like other 'Play and Learn' features, the amateur editing and production detract from work that has the potential to be quite good. Titling is poorly edited and sometimes difficult to read. UPDATE: We wound up taking a chance on subsequent DVDs and the production values do improve over time. Later volumes are much better.

2. More Mandarin, less English. Mei Mei clearly understands some aspects of language acquisition, and could create even better tools for parents and kids working on Mandarin. More 'natural language' situations involving day-to-day activities using basic Mandarin, with repetition and context, would be wonderful. Kids interacting with one another and parents/teachers using the 'total physical response' (TPR) model would work well.

That being said, we enjoyed the ""Dawei Village"" video (#7), but mainly for the glimpse into life for the kids and parents featured, not necessarily for the language component. Narrated exclusively in English, there some Mandarin phrases introduced after different segments. Greater emphasis on natural language here would have been welcome.

The bottom line is that low-budget production values are not worth $20-$25 per 30-minute episode. Mei Mei, please take steps to ensure video and audio that highlight your skills as a teacher, and work to bring more natural language settings with regular kids (as opposed to overly-choreographed and costumed dance numbers) to this field. For those kids who have already mastered basic vocabulary (family, colors, animals, food, transportation, clothing, etc.), more advanced structures would also be welcome in the mix.
