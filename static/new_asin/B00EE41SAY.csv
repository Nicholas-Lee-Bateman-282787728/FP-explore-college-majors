5905381,4,B00EE41SAY,"I probably would have given this set a 5 star rating, but I cannot watch it yet.  My DVD player will not play the Anamorphic format or at least I cannot figure out how to make it play them.  I have seen For Love Of The Game and Mr. Baseball before and they are very good movies.  One day I will have to get a new DVD player and I will make sure it plays the Anamorphic format.",1426982400,,376,3.7948717948717947

5905389,4,B00EE41SAY,"I purchased this for my son who loves baseball.  He just discovered that there are a ton of baseball movies and I wanted to get a DVD for him to enjoy on long car rides to California.  All the movies are wonderful with the exception of ""Ed"".  Ed is great for little kids but my 13 year old watched it once and that was enough for him.  ""For the Love of the Game"" was his favorite of the bunch.  I would give it 5 stars but the inclusion of ""Ed"" seems to not fit the theme except that it was a baseball movie.  The other 3 are geared for adults but can be enjoyed by older kids where Ed is a pure kids movie.  I think another baseball choice like ""The Babe"" or ""Eight Men Out"" would have been better but I'm sure the movies are chosen based on the film company who made them.  If you love baseball movies, the price for all 4 is worth it even if you really get 3.  Sorry ""Ed"" but Matt LeBlanc proves why he was always a D-lister actor who got a big break with a more talented cast.",1487635200,,980,3.934010152284264

Two of the movies (Field of Dreams & For the Love of the Game) star Kevin Costner.  These are movies I like to watch repeatedly and have watched with my boys even when they were little!  Family friendly movies and great acting!  I would recommend this set to anyone that loves to watch a movie centered around baseball.  The fact you get all four movies for one fantastic price is awesome (the cost of this set was less than the price of one movie individually!)!!!",1436313600,2,602,4.6415094339622645
