7986901,5,B00008T2AU,"I can't believe this is finally on dvd! One of my all-time favorite creepy movies. Barbara Eden is stellar in it. The quality is pretty good. I have never seen it look this great as the bootleg copies were horrible. Sound and picture are definitely watchable. There is a slight shake here and there but nothing that interferes with enjoying the movie. I believe this was filmed on videotape as well. I could be wrong. But that could factor in why it hasn't been restored to look incredibly sharp. Still, if you've waited as long as I have for this (never thinking it would see the light of day), you will be absolutely thrilled to have this in your collection.",1487030400,2,660,4.508333333333334

7986904,4,B00008T2AU,"It's great to finally see this made-for-TV movie on DVD!!!! Prior to this, it was only available on VHS in Japan. As usual, Barbara Eden gives a great performance in this sci-fi thriller which followed ""The Stepford Wives"" (1975) and ""Revenge of the Stepford Wives"" (1980).",1475280000,,273,4.956521739130435
7986905,4,B00008T2AU,"This outing from The Stepford Community was great. Barbara Eden was extremely good as the mother who notices that the children are not normal and is very surprised that they have no hang-outs, no weekend parties without parent supervision and no PTA. The ending is suspenseful and exciting more than any of the other have been. The way the children are being switched is different than the other times. In some ways the special effects were head of there time.
I just wish is was available on DVD.",1304899200,8,497,4.659090909090909
7986906,4,B00008T2AU,"This is a ripoff. Even though this is a good movie, there is no way in any stretch of the imagination that a VHS copy of The Stepford children is worth $100. Not even if it was gold plated. I love this movie but there is no way I would pay extortion prices like this.

And since those of us who still have VHS are becoming fewer and farther between, this seller (who only has 3 ratings) will end up holding the bag and pushing his luck at this horrific gouging price. Not too long from now, most people will not be looking for any VHS tapes to buy.

Don't let anyone take this kind of advantage of you. Wait until someone sells it for a reasonable price. It should be below $50 and since it is on VHS, it should be lower than that considering it is a technology which is rapidly disappearing. This is not the only copy of this movie in existence so wait until you can buy it from someone else at a reasonable price.",1228089600,12,915,4.106145251396648
