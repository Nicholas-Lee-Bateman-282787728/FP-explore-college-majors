8127570,2,B000FWGVW4,"The history of Queen told by two Freddie Mercury impersonators and several journalists who never met the man. Paul Gambaccini did know Freddie and is the only to include actual information that is first-person. Very little actual music critique is included apart from historical facts about how financially successful were each album and tour. While the film goes in chronological order, the photos shown are very out of order.

Is this essential viewing for a Queen fan? I don't believe so. Many other DVDs do a much better job of explaining this story with people who were actually present at the time.

I would have given this 1 star, but it did actually include some Queen music and live footage.",1420588800,,700,4.825
8127571,5,B000FWGVW4,Very entertaining view of one of the great rock groups of all time.,1167868800,3,67,4.230769230769231
8127572,5,B000FWGVW4,"I thought, being a huge Queen fan, that I would be bored because I knew everything there is to know about the band. But, I was pleasantly surprised from footage, interviews and information that even I didn't know. It would make a Queen fan very happy, indeed.",1167782400,5,259,4.531914893617022
8127573,1,B000FWGVW4,"The product description says ""rare interviews,"" but they don't mean rare interviews of band members. All the interviewees are journalists, radio disc jockeys, and rock historians. It has maybe 30 seconds of an interview with Freddie about the song ""I Want to Break Free,"" and that's it. The rest is their opinons about Queen.

Yes, there are clips of live concerts, still shots, music videos, and music, but over 75% of the footage is basically reviews by the interviewees of each album Queen produced during the time period. You can save money and get most of the same information in the DVD by reading reviews of these albums online for free.

If you just want to listen to other people talk about their thoughts on Queen, this might be the DVD for you. Otherwise... you're not missing much. Even as a huge Queen fan, I still found this boring.",1161734400,15,846,4.671140939597316
8127574,5,B000FWGVW4,Excellent for a Queen Fan/Collector. Knowledgeable commentary from quality Reviewers with great visual and magic music by the Band.  Wish there was more in the future.,1157414400,4,167,5.423076923076923
