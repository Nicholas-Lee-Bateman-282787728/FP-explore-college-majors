2550000,5,B000F39P3K,"I am a tech geek (the computer variety) so when circumstances required that I get a vintage car (an old car) I decided that I would do the work myself.  I have changed alternators, Mass air flow sensors, multiple AC Compressors.  Fortunately I haven't had to do any internal engine work, but this DVD has offered me a grasp of how things work and given me a reasonable amount of confidence that given space and opportunity I won't be clueless.

I even look at it for relaxation (I told you I was a tech geek).",1282694400,,509,4.336842105263158
2550001,5,B000F39P3K,This is one of the best videos for someone wanting to learn how to rebuild an engine or brush up on repairs.  It shows you step-by-step how to remove the engine and completely replace everything and install it back in the vehicle for start-up.  Definitely worth the money.,1267660800,,272,4.645833333333333
2550002,5,B000F39P3K,I'm a complete noob mechanic who is literally just starting out. This video is very informative and I would recommend it to any beginner. You can read the other reviews for some of you who are pros already.,1256947200,,206,4.447368421052632
2550003,5,B000F39P3K,"For anyone looking to rebuild their engine, or even just do some bolt on modifications (heads, cam, etc) this is the video for you.  The information is clear, concise and very well assembled.  I am rebuilding a set of heads, installing a cam and doing some other work on my sbc and within a half hour of watching the different chapters EVERY question I had was answered, even the ones I felt were fairly obscure.  Worth every penny and then some.",1251849600,,446,4.481481481481482
2550004,5,B000F39P3K,"What a video.  If you've ever wanted to learn about rebuilding an engine, but had almost no experience under the hood, this is the place to start.  From basic engine terminology to removal to rebuilding, to set design and sound stage, this production is first class.

The narration is excellent, and all tools and components are introduced carefully as it proceeds.  The sets, as mentioned in another review, are clean and very bright.  (No dingy garage here lit with a greasy 40 watt bulb.)

Each chapter has a number of 3D cutscenes showing the engine operating, with the focus on the section at hand, so you get an excellent view of how everything works together.

The video is three hours long and broken into digestible chapters for either straight-through viewing or random access to the sections you want.  And the menu system is great-- if a new tool or component is introduced during the narration an icon appears onscreen which you can select for a more detailed explanation.

The goal is to rebuild an engine step by step, but even if you don't know anything about engines and simply want to learn how they operate, this is an unbeatable resource.  The narrators don't assume anything at the start and carefully explain all aspects of engines and the tools used in removing and rebuilding them.  After watching this you will never again be confused when you bring your car to the mechanic for engine work.

The video includes a section on removing an engine, so you get a true start to finish overview.  The narrators actually rebuild two popular engines here, a Chevy and a Ford, with differences between them pointed out along the way.  But as they're careful to emphasize, all of the techniques shown are applicable to almost every automobile engine on the road.

If you've ever had your head spin trying to learn about engines from poorly written internet articles and incomprehensible how-to books that throw terms at you with no explanations (and use out of focus black and white photos for good measure) this DVD will make a world of difference.

Go to the vendor's website at [...] and look at the video snippets they have there and judge for yourself.  You won't regret it.",1237507200,5,2193,4.7592592592592595
2550005,5,B000F39P3K,"I was stunned at how good the instruction was and how well it was videotaped. Unless you're a pro, this DVD is a must for anyone thinking of doing engine work, or seeking knowledge on the workings of an automobile engine.",1203206400,8,221,4.414634146341464
2550006,5,B000F39P3K,"GREAT DVD! IF YOUR THINKING ABOUT REBUILDING YOUR ENGINE DO NOT PASS UP THIS VIDEO. VIDEO COVERS PREP, REMOVAL, DISASSEMBY, MACHING,PRE-ASSEMBY,FINAL ASSEMBLY,INSTALL AND START-UP. I WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE NICE FORMAT OF VIDEO. EACH CHAPTER WAS FURTHER DIVIDED INTO MANY OTHER SECTIONS.THE FORMAT ALLOWS YOU TO EASILY SKIP OR RETURN TO SPECFIC TASKS. EVEN IF YOU NEVER REBUILD AN ENGINE IT MAKES FOR VERY INFORMATIVE VIEWING.",1167091200,12,425,5.454545454545454
2550007,5,B000F39P3K,"This video is insanely detailed. I bought it because I wanted to know whether I should buy a crate engine or try to rebuild my own. I have much more information at my disposal now.

First, the steps of pulling the engine, disassembly, and reassembly are all shot in a studio with white background and super bright lighting. You can see *everything*. When a specialized tool is used, a little tool icon flashes at the top of the screen. If you select it, the video goes to a sub menu and tells you what that tool is. You hit ""resume"" and you go right back to where you left off. For instance, I had heard of Plastigage, but had never seen it used. It was not only used, but thoroughly described during the section where the crankshaft was being reinstalled.

The narrators are experienced car people. The narration is conversational but thorough, and you can tell that they are speaking from experience. I had an engine that I got from an old 86 VW Scirrocco, and I couldn't get the crank pulley off. In this video, they showed how I could stick a wooden hammer handle in between the crank and the block to hold it steady while I torque the pulley. Duh. I wish I would have thought of this simple trick sooner. They also showed how you can put rubber tubing over rod bolts during piston removal to prevent scratching of the crank. That's handy information.

This video deals primarily with pushrod V8s. One is a marine engine and the other is a small block chevy.  The methods for removal of pistons, rods, and crank are universal to any engine, but the valve train is a little different. The motor I want to rebuild is a dual overhead cam motor, so I wanted more detail on that. However, I think I can swing the rest of the details from my shop manual on the car.

The two V8s they rebuilt in this video had interesting problems. The marine motor swallowed a few gallons of sea water, so it was full of sludge that looked like caramel. But they rebuilt it!  The small block Chevy had a spun rod bearing, so they showed how the crankshaft was reground and oversized bearings were used. Both blocks were rebored. That is one of the best parts of this video. They went to the machine shop with the engines, and followed every step the machinists performed to rebuild the engine. This was invaluable to me, because with this knowledge I knew that I would only be able to do so much with my engine, and after that I would have to surrender it to the shop. But at least I know now what they would do to it, and I can ask the right questions.

What this video also reveals is that it takes a lot of time to rebuild an engine. A decent engine that is getting refreshed is simple - you put in new bearings, pistons, rings, maybe rods, and that's about it. For a total rebuild, however, you have to got through a lot of steps to make a solid running motor. It's a thorough and scientific process, and this video shows every little detail. It is worth every penny and deserves the highest rating.",1158192000,35,2985,4.357913669064748
2550028,5,B000F39P3K,"The only thing I'm disappointed about is that these guys don't have more videos. This is, hands down, one of the best instructional videos I've ever seen, not just for cars, but for anything. It is very thorough and clear. Everything about it has been thoughtfully done. Often with instructional videos, the verbiage can be pretty mind numbing. I've even fallen asleep while watching some. These guys, though, they get that it's not just the information itself that matters--it's just as important how they get it to you. If you would like to be able to work on the parts that reside deep inside an engine, I would consider this video a must-watch. Just to be clear, too, I have no affiliation whatsoever with these guys; I have no idea who they are; or even where they are. I just wish they'd make some more videos. Very well done guys.

This same exact DVD is offered as a Book & DVD combo package that is also sold by Amazon.com. At this moment the difference in price between the DVD and the DVD & Book combo is less than $2.00. I bought both and didn't know the DVD that came with the book would be EXACTLY THE SAME. If I could do it over again I wold just buy the Book & DVD combo and essentially get the Book for free. The book is called ""Rebuilding Any Automotive Engine"", it's written by Barry Kluczyk and published by SA Design. A link to the Book & DVD combo is directly below.

*** DVD REVIEW BELOW ***
I really liked the DVD. It was really well put together, I was actually really surprised by the over all professionalism of the direction and composition of content besides being very informative and detail driven. The DVD tells you what you need, what was optional, how to use it, and where to buy it or rent it. It Showed everything, from taking the engine out of the car, every step of the disassembly, and rebuild and putting the engine back in the car after the rebuild process has been completed. I really appreciated that it even took you inside a machine shop to show you what would be done to your engine if machining is required. As I said before the DVD was very complete and I learned a lot. I will definitely be watching it a few more times before I start my first rebuild.

I watch a ton of automotive how to TV shows, all the Powerblock shows on Spike and some of the shows on the Speed channel and this is a great back-up to any of that information. Normally there is a decent amount of information that those guys are forced to gloss over because its only a 25 minute TV show at best when you take commercials into account. This how to DVD is 3 hours long and has more backup information in it past that. In my opinion it is about as complete as it could be.

I am currently building an AMC 360 for my 1980 Jeep CJ-7 and it is my first engine rebuild. I would really be lost without this DVD. It is a great side-kick for more specific make and model information such as the link below where they go through my exact engine and tell about all its exact idiosyncrasies.

This DVD is a great base of knowledge for most of any engine rebuild but it is not a full complete catalog of every single engine available. To have a successful rebuild you will need to look up make & model specific information as well. The DVD tells you where to find such information.",1346716800,3,2958,4.96969696969697

It avoids jargon and does not make any assumptions that you know anything about auto repair. It is very thorough and detailed, well edited, well shot and is clearly spoken. Hats off to a very good job on how to rebuild an engine.

2550032,4,B000F39P3K,"Basic engine building is a really informative DVD that's great for introducing the fundamentals of engine building, but certainly not worth your while if you already have any experience in engine building (the title of the DVD 'basic engine building' says it all really).
