8117125,1,B000F3UO62,"This DVD does not convey the information advertised or desired, because Dr. Sabbah barely speaks English. I look forward to someone else making another attempt using some other medium. There is great value in Dr. Sabbah's discoveries about mind-body connections, but this DVD does not serve the purpose.",1510963200,,303,5.333333333333333
8117126,1,B000F3UO62,After hearing how great the method of Total Biology emotional clearing was from a friend of mine I looked forward to receiving the DVD in order to gain some insights into how it worked and how to apply it to my own life.  This DVD supplied none of that and was an absolute joke.  The author stumbles along with very poor English attempting to describe some cases that he had worked with in very simple terms and giving no structure or form as to how Total Biology is to be practiced or applied.  The interviewer is no help at all and it becomes painfully obvious after the first 5 minutes that they needed the help of a translator.  This DVD is a waste of money and the worst purchasing decision I have made in decades...you have been warned.  It became the butt of jokes for days afterwards by the 4 of us that sat down to view it. It was so poor that it has forced me into writing this review - my first ever - in order to warn potential buyers.,1195603200,16,947,4.181318681318682
