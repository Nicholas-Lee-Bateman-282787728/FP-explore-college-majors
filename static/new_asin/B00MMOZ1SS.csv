6588761,5,B00MMOZ1SS,"If you're even a casual fan of anime I believe you will love Cowboy Bebop. Unlike many animated movies / series of its time, Cowboy Bebop isn't heavy handed nor super violent. Instead it concentrates on a fantastic group of misfit characters thrown together like a science fiction A-Team. The story telling, action and animation is superb. I also love how the series has a great sense of humor (as well as a cool soundtrack), something severely lacking in many animes. By the time the series wraps up you will really care about these characters.
A few years ago I had to hunt down the original DVDs that make up the series. I'm more than happy to buy this again on blu-ray!",1408406400,31,673,4.524590163934426
6588762,5,B00MMOZ1SS,This is an anime the most of the new stuff that's out can't even come close to cowboy bebop.,1408320000,6,92,3.8947368421052633
6588763,5,B00MMOZ1SS,"This is one of the best shows of all time. The art direction, cinematography, and music are all top-notch. It feels like you're drawn into living, breathing world, and though the characters aren't particularly complex, they are uniquely charming and it's interesting to watch their stories unfold. To me, this series feels more like a piece of art than a typical anime.",1408320000,21,369,4.967741935483871
6588764,5,B00MMOZ1SS,"Cowboy Bebop has been, since it's release in 1998, the bar by which every new anime series is judged by. It's just that good. Many have described it as 1970's cop show-meets western-meets high-quality drama-meets film-noir, and I am gonna have to agree with them.
Cowboy Bebop revolves around futuristic bounty hunters Spike Spiegel and Jet Black, and the series is really just their exploits through the universe. Along the way, they meet female bounty hunter Faye Valentine, computer hacker Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky 4th (simply Ed for short), data dog Ein, and various bounties and figures from their past.
The beauty of Cowboy Bebop is that although the show does have a recurring story based around Spike's past, this is more or less tossed aside for ""filler"" episodes, or one episode storylines. Through filler episodes, we make a very strong bond and attachment to these characters, and it makes the ending to it all the more heartfelt.
When I watch Cowboy Bebop, I really do feel what happens to the characters. You feel sympathy and plight, happiness and joy, sadness and sorrow. You care about the characters, and I commend the staff who worked on the series for doing this. Very few anime series have characters for whom you can actually relate to, build bonds to emotionally, and frankly, give a damn about. Cowboy Bebop pulls it off with elegance and grace, as if it were nothing.
All in all, Cowboy Bebop is one of the best anime ever created, hands down. it has excellent characters, wonderful story lines, beautiful animation, and mesmerizing locales. It remains to be one of my favorites of all time.

I am so excited for this Blu-Ray release and can't wait to see what Funimation has whipped up this time in the release of this amazing nostalgic series for me.",1408147200,40,1784,4.811074918566775
6588765,5,B00MMOZ1SS,"As far as the show itself goes, it's perfect.

Just ignore anyone who slams the narrative for ""herp derp it was mostly self contained stuff"".

As far as this release goes, I've been waiting for a Blu-Ray release for ages so I expect great things.",1408147200,11,246,4.444444444444445
6588766,2,B00MMOZ1SS,"Outside was intact, but the bluray case was cracked and broken.

Series is a 5 star!",1495324800,,84,4.25
6588767,5,B00MMOZ1SS,"Cowboy Bebop is one of my favorite Japanese anime. When I first watched Cowboy Bebop on Toonami on Cartoon Network when it was weekly. I fell in love with this show, and ever since then I've wanted the complete series on Blu Ray. When I saw the flash sale of this Amazon exclusive just before Christmas 2016. I jumped at the chance to buy it, and I haven't regretted it.

The Show: Cowboy Bebop has some of the coolest lovable characters in an anime. The way the show introduces the characters also shows of the amazing writing that goes into the show. Each character has depth and their character interactions is written really well. The story follows a rag tag group of bounty hunters trying to make a living while traveling between Earth's solar system. They are always never successful in catching their bounty, and they do not agree with each other most of the time. However, they seem to get along very well even with their differences between them.  Some of the best part of the story is the places they go to. However, the story is grounded in reality, meaning there is no aliens in this series. Cowboy Bebop is a human tale with believable and human characters. (I won't ruin the story for those who have not see the show.) Cowboy Bebop also showcases some great scientific concepts that follows the traditions of Star Trek. For example, when the Cowboy Bebop crew go to Mars. The way the creators of the show portrayed their Mars colonies makes me want to actually go there, and they do it in a way that is scientifically possible in the near future to have similar Mars colonies.

Animation: Cowboy Bebop has some of the best animation that is not soaked in with allot of CG (Computer Graphics). This show is mostly old school animation and is at the very beginning when CG effects takes over. I really enjoyed the art style of this anime from the character design to the design of their ships. Cowboy Bebop is also old school pan and scan 4:3 aspect ratio, and this collection keeps the show in it's original 4:3 ratio. They could have gave it the cinematic 16:9 wide screen treatment, and I am glad they didn't. This collection is also remastered and clears this anime to HD standards.

Audio and Soundtrack: The English voice cast of Cowboy Bebop is spot on, and one of the best in the industry. The Japanese dub is also equally amazing, and it is hard to find an anime that has both amazing English and Japanese dub.
The music is the best soundtrack in anime in my opinion. From the ""Tank"" intro of the series. Yoko Kanno does an amazing job at blending jazz, and rock together making this soundtrack unforgettable.

This Collection: This is an Amazon exclusive and comes with both Blu Ray and DVD version of Cowboy Bebop. It also comes with 2 collector books that showcase the animation of Cowboy Bebop. I really like that this collection comes with both Blu Ray and DVD version. Most shows only come with either Blu Ray or DVD. The box itself is really well built and the disk is held with in a decent Blu Ray jewel case.

Pros:
Great Story.
Great Characters.
Great Voice Acting.
Great Music.

Cons:
No cons in my opinion

Final Thoughts: I recommend Cowboy Bebop to fans and new comers. This collection may also be a little pricier then say just the Blu Ray edition. However, this collection does come with Blu Ray and DVD and some really cool art books and a really study collector's box.
Also, I received my copy in mint condition. Which I am always happy about. I thought about posting photos but I think there is enough photos from other reviewers.",1490227200,3,3570,4.541213063763608

6588775,5,B00MMOZ1SS,"My favorite anime series. I had the DVD version I bought many years ago but it  doesn't play well on the newer TV's. This set includes both the DVD and Blu-ray version. The art work books is a nice addition, color and BW. Watch it from beginning to end, the characters will draw you in and after the last episode you will realize how much you're gonna miss all the characters.",1485302400,,376,4.295774647887324

6588786,5,B00MMOZ1SS,"I do not say this lightly, but I do believe that Cowboy Bebop is one of the best anime ever produced. The style, character progression, and pacing of the series makes it enjoyable as a first time watch and for many viewings to come. And sitting on top of this excellent production is a soundtrack that is nothing short of eclectic and brilliantly arranged, perfectly emphasizing the atmosphere and emotions being depicted on screen.

Now, aside from my opinion on the anime itself, I will remark that this box set is just about as good as it gets for Bebop fans. You get pretty much everything here, the highest quality release available and DVDs to boot. I rarely purchase physical media anymore, but this is one of the few items I recommend for a collection. If you are a die hard Bebop fan, this is a must, if you're just getting into anime you might be ok with just a DVD set, but you can hardly go wrong with this collection.",1484438400,,930,4.43859649122807

6588791,5,B00MMOZ1SS,"For a general review of Cowboy Bebop, you should probably check out the regular version as it has many more reviews (including one from me). This review will deal with the Amazon exclusive features.

To start off, you get both the Blu-ray and DVD copies with this. The Blu-ray is so beautifully crisp. I was amazed how much nicer they looked. These are all in one case and are packed very nicely.

My biggest point for buying this was the art books. The first one was a black and white one that had many sketches. Some were concept art, others were just random sketches: but they were all interesting. The other art book was full colour. The colours were vibrant and the pictures were great. All of the sketches and pictures are high quality.

High quality art books, multiple formats, and a convenient case for all of it are what makes this with it. I've seen animes with much less features go for similar prices, so why not get one that gives you so much? I'd definitely recommend it.",1481155200,11,986,4.4972067039106145
6588792,5,B00MMOZ1SS,"This is one of the first animes I watched and fell in love with. It was instantly my favorite series of all time. The story is so deep, yet fun. Every character is unique but very memorable.  The jazz music is to die for. I always find myself listening to the soundtrack on its own. This set is amazing, though. The art books are amazing and definitely give the set a nice touch.",1480982400,3,379,4.191780821917808

I'm really disappointed with the blu-rays though. Audio is terrible, picture is great, no subtitles (I enjoy watching my shows with subtitles)

Nevertheless though, this is Cowboy Bebop but you'll probably end up watching the DVD version since the audio on the blu-rays is terrible (I have my tv at max volume and can still barely hear everything)",1433116800,2,432,4.746666666666667

I first watched this series on Cartoon Network back before it was ruined, many sad episodes but plenty of fun and happy ones so it balances itself out in the end, but what really brought back memories was the phenomenal music for this series.

-Series on Blu-ray? Check
-DVD? Check
-Art book? Double check. One in color for stills and character designs, and one in black and white for copies of original sketches. Fantastic for those like myself!

I haven't done any direct comparisons to the other DVD box set that I have (May also be unfair to compare the Blu-ray version to the DVD), but from my initial viewing I can say the video looks slightly sharper, and audio seems to be of higher quality.

My only complaint is that it didn't come with the movie. Not a huge loss as you can pick that up for $5-6, but still a reason I would drop this from a 9.5/10 to 9/10.

6588871,5,B00MMOZ1SS,"I double dipped and grabbed the Amazon Exclusive Bebop and sold my older version (ADV? Bandai?  Can't recall).  The Funimation treatment has been great.  One lovely note for those fans of the excellent English cast - it is the SAME!  So gladly, Funimation did not re-dub with new talent!  But in the dozen plus times watching the series - I do actually prefer the Japanese cast.  True, the English cast is very well matched - but Faye especially excels in the Japanese (that mix of silly, quirky, serious).

For those who have been living in anime purgatory for the last 15 years: Cowboy Bebop is the story of four hard luck bounty hunters (plus their Welsh Corgi) and their adventures in the near future.  Each episode is a stand alone story (except a few of the two part episodes), but there is a continuity of the story and a few major story arcs that run parallel to the individual stories.

It is the perfect gateway anime and I have personally gotten several people into anime who had never seen a single anime before this.  It's anime crack!  And Funimation did us a solid with their limited editions (3 different versions!).  I chose the Amazon edition because I wanted the art books.  They are smaller than I had thought, but they are pretty excellent as far as content goes.

Bottom line?  If you are familiar with the series, it's a new, high def release (cleaned up a bit, especially backgrounds), great sound, and worth double dipping for true fans.  If you don't have the series, then now is the time to buy it.  You won't regret it.

The crew of the Bebop are a group of bounty hunters (plus one hacker and a genius Corgi) who struggle to make ends meet, often times with rather hilarious results.  Each of them has a past, which occasionally surfaces to meet them again throughout the series, and each of them finds a way to deal with that past in their own way.  Set to an amazing soundtrack, this series earns its place in history as a genre-redefining work of art.

What can I say, It's a classic anime that finally got a Blu-Ray release in the US. When I heard FUNimation was bringing a remastered version of CB to the US, I had to pre order it, right away. The image looks great, It's crisp, and clean. The shadows are a little bit darker, when you compare it to the UK edition, and yes, it's not widescreen, but that understandable. The audio (Dolby 5.1 for both english and Japanese) could be better, but it still pretty damn good, or at least it sounds good with my gear. This edition is full of extras, which I love. The anime itself is great, with likable characters, great story telling and plot. It is episodic, with some overarching stories, if that makes sense. I feel like everybody should watch it at least once, though I'm sure not everybody will like it. The regions this edition plays in are only A/1, BTW.

Packaging (Amazon Limited edition):

This edition comes in a sturdy cardboard box, and it opens up like a clamshell. The front has the faces of the main characters and the back it also has the main characters, but they look like they were drawn with chalk, which I think looks pretty cool. Inside it has the two artbooks, the paper that the books are made out isn't that great, it feels kinda thin. One has sketches of the show, and the other one is full color art. The DVD's and Blu-Rays come in a thick Blu-Ray box, and it has the same art as the artbox, but if you flip it, it has the old art from Bandai's ""Cowboy Bebop Remix: The Complete Collection"" DVD's. The Disc's sorta look like vinyl records, which is a nice touch. Overall, I really like it, and I'm glad I was able to get a copy of it.

I will upload some images, so you guys could check it out.",1419120000,43,1724,4.298461538461538

The plastic case was broken inside, but luckily on parts that do not effect closing or holding the disks. Some people have complained of worse cases, I seem to have escaped the worse.

It sounds like I'm listening to an FM radio; and scenes where there are explosions and yelling sound like high pitched fuzz screaming into my ear, even on a low volume setting.

I've only had a chance to play this on my computer but I knew something was wrong after I plugged headphones directly into my sound card, played other blu-ray's through my blu-ray player, and checked my audio settings on my computer.

All other audio and blu-ray movies sound great through the player and the blu-ray drive.

Thank god I pre-ordered this and Amazon honored the lowest price which ended in me paying $75 for this total.

I'll probably pick up the standard 4-disc set just to see if the audio is better.

6588890,5,B00MMOZ1SS,"I'm going to write this review assuming that the person reading it has never seen an episode of Cowboy Bebop, but I hope those who have seen it will read it and agree with me. I have revisited this series multiple times since first discovering it as a teen, as most Americans did, during Cartoon Network's late night Adult Swim. The 26 part series means a lot to me so I thought I would throw my two cents in and write a review because I think most of my friends and family would think I am crazy if I showed this much passion for something like this.

But first let me get something out of that way. Cowboy Bebop is classified as an anime, and while it's true that this series is Japanese animation, to merely categorize it as such could not and never will give this series a just explanation of what it truly is - a master piece of cinematography and story telling. So let me attempt to enlighten those who might ""judge"" the fact that it is an anime; I truly believe that animation is the only medium that could have truly pulled off what this series accomplishes perfectly. I think Shinichiro Watanabe (the director) knew this as he has literally written within the series its self (during the animated transitions) that (and I'm paraphrasing) ""the work that will become a genre unto its self shall be called Cowboy Bebop"" because there truly is nothing like it when you look at it as a whole. Keanu Reeves also discovered this when he and 20th Century Fox planned on adapting it but discovered that to pull it off it would cost $500 million. So in other words, animation is the only way that this story could have been told.

And wow, what a story. I know a lot of fans, including myself, that regard stumbling upon this show for the first time as a significant discovery and an experience to treasure. This isn't your favorite show that you and your friends obsess over together on Netflix. It comes and goes quickly, and does so on purpose as many fans of the series have come to understand. It's mysterious, surprising, hilarious, dramatic, explosive, detailed, sensual, and tragic. To say that it is ahead of its time might be an understatement. It keeps getting new fans and keeps getting revisited by media outlets because it seems that as the years go by it becomes even more relevant, hence the release of this special edition. The themes and archetypes of that relevancy I won't get into because I don't want to spoil anything, but what is important is that the tools used to explore those themes are the characters themselves.

You might have heard a little about those characters. At face value the four main protagonists are bounty hunters that explore the dystopian galaxy searching for bounty heads. However, the beauty of the character development of the story is that you rediscover them during the course of the series. Jett is more than just an ex cop turned cowboy, he's the black dog that can't let go of the past like sometimes we experience. Faye is more than just a sexualized gun slinger, she's an incarnation of the constant yearning for identity in all of us. Ed is more than just a hacker seemingly immune to all emotional normalcy, she is the paradoxical incarnation of what it means to belong. And Spike? He's too good, I'll ruin it if I say anything. All four make a lasting statement about the bridge between our own past and present, and that's just getting started.

Of all the media, movies, TV Shows, and general entertainment that I have experienced, Cowboy Bebop has by far had the largest effect on me as a person. It's more than a series, it's a work of art. Pick it up and see for your self.",1416268800,19,3635,4.528158295281583

What I've found so far is the following (thanks to Nicholas Gold for commenting on my original review)

FUNimation Exclusive Premium Edition

* Complete TV series on Blu-ray and DVD (combo pack)
* Exclusive Limited Edition tri-fold packaging in the style of a vintage record cover
* Display easel for packaging
* Four exclusive art cards
* One additional exclusive art card with foil-stamp autograph from series director Shinichiro Watanabe
* As of 9/12/14 Market Price is $89.98 and pre-order price is $64.98 directly from FUNimation [and still $64.98 on 10/5/2014]

Amazon Exclusive Premium Edition

* Complete TV series on Blu-ray and DVD (combo pack)
* Exclusive Limited Edition clamshell art box
* 140 page black and white art book featuring concept sketches and designs that highlight Cowboy Bebop's origins
* 48 page vibrant, full-color art book
* As of 9/12/14 the Market Price is $99.98 and you can see the current Amazon Price above

So, as far as I can find so far, the actual content is the same. In my opinion, the difference is that the Amazon exclusive has more interesting physical extras. However, at a $25 premium. So, if you're a collector and don't mind shelling out another $25, then get the Amazon version. If all you care about is watching the videos, then the FUNimation version may be for you or the Blu-Ray standard edition. If you're super hardcore, than you're gonna tear your hair out trying to decide if you should buy both LOL!

I cannot confirm yet if the actual video (and on disc extra) content is any different between the standard and premium editions.

If you find any other info regarding the differences to these edition, then please post in the comments and I'll update this post with those comments or any info I find as well!

6588898,5,B00MMOZ1SS,"I have owned this series on dvd for many,many years now and since purchasing it originally have accrued quite an anime collection as a part of of my entertainment library. That being said, to this day not one anime I have seen since can truly hold a candle to the brilliance of this show (for that matter most visual media, both animated and live action can match up to the genius of Bebop). Unfortunately far too many movies and television series find a way to get their hooks into you regarding the characters or the plot itself of the movie / show but far too few put you into a position to have fully vested interest in both. Bebop accomplishes this with an originality and poise I wish newer anime makers would take a lesson from. If you're a writer, artist director, voice actor, music writer or any individual with decision making power regarding anime creation and have not seen Bebop it should be a requirement before you begin your own creative adventure.
  Admittedly I am a bit more old school when it comes to anime (Record of Lodoss War, Robotechans so forth) but with friends much more connected I have found myself drawn into the modern era of this pop culture juggernaut. Nonetheless, I make it my personal crusade to track down any that have not seen Cowboy Bebop and encourage, cajole or even beg them to watch it if necessary. I tell them the one simple fact that none have failed to agree with me on after they watch it; it is the best animated series they will ever experience. That would be the better word in regard to Cowboy Bebop. You don't simply watch this iconic series. You experience it. You wrap it within yourself and every element of it becomes a part of you, from the amazing characters to the storytelling and high quality music soundtrack that is an element far too many more recent anime fail to include with their visual journey. Groundbreaking and memorable storytelling and visuals require an equal level of audio brilliance (and vice verse) to mesh into something that may inevitably transcend time and become a permanent part of culture, not matter what era. This not merely in essence or theory, but in fact, is the heart string pulling, soul taking, emotion gripping roller coaster known as Cowboy Bebop. It is timeless, and will always remain that way.",1409443200,4,2298,4.643734643734644

Its beautiful, gritty, surreal, and amazing with characters that you care about and somehow despise at the same time. I don't own this set yet (its not out) but I will be buying the Blu Ray set even though I own the DVD's because this is one of those shows that truly deserves it.

If you are on the fence, don't be. Whether you like Anime, Sci-Fi, Westerns, or even MUSIC in general (this show is honestly a music lovers dream) you'll find something to like in this show and if it doesn't fall into your top 5 Animes or even one of your favorite shows of all time I would be shocked.",1408579200,5,814,4.211538461538462

Amazing animation, great fight scenes, the best character development i've ever seen, and a GOD-TIER soundtrack composed by yoko kanno.

6588903,5,B00MMOZ1SS,"I remember the first time I watched ""Cowboy Bebop"" like it was yesterday. It was a cold Saturday night in September 2002 and I was eager to watch something fresh. This was during a time when Cartoon Network still hadn't reached a creative decline and didn't have ridiculous live-action shows cluttering the network like infested roaches. As I browse through the TV menu to see what I could watch on the channel, I accidentally highlighted ""Cowboy Bebop"" for Saturday night. I never heard of ""Bebop"" before, but what struck me about this show was that it was rated TV-14. Now back in those days, the highest rating of a show on Cartoon Network was TV-PG, so imagine my surprise when I found out that a Cartoon Network show that was for older audiences. Imagine my bigger surprise when this was an anime, which I never cared for at the time. But the biggest surprise was just how damn good this show was. Hell, it wasn't good. It was fantastic. Even though it was the final episode of ""Bebop"", I was immediately drawn into the show: it had interesting characters, marvelous art direction, exciting action scenes and...an ending that moved me to tears?!! No wonder this was TV-14; this show was created for the audiences' best interest, an interest that doesn't involve bulky robots, talking mice or space warriors spending three hours talking and three seconds fighting.

Much like how words cannot describe my love for ""Cowboy Bebop"", no review, no matter how long and deep, can entirely express the timelessness of that show. But I'll do the best I can. There may be greater Japanese cartoons. Cartoons of greater vision, emotional complexity and political importance. Cartoons that have significantly altered the course of an industry (ex: ""Evangelion""). And even cartoons that we would put above it on our lists. But no Japanese cartoon is more loved and has greater appeal than ""Cowboy Bebop"". This is an anime that transcended categories and genre conventions. It has appeared on more ""greatest anime"" lists than any Japanese cartoon, even ""Evangelion"" and the Miyazaki films. It has outlived many of the climatic changes in the anime industry, including the poisonous moe phenomenon and even the closure of its distributor Bandai Entertainment. And whereas most anime of the 1990s have become interesting relics and forgotten, ""Bebop"" keeps growing and gaining more fans. And now with Funimation finally releasing this show on Blu-Ray this December, the popularity of ""Bebop"" will continue to endure. ""Cowboy Bebop"" isn't just an anime; it's THE anime.

What is it about ""Cowboy Bebop"" that makes it an enduring classic? What exactly makes this 15-year old Japanese cartoon so appealing that it outranks far more popular cartoons like ""Evangelion"", ""Naruto"" and ""Fullmetal Alchemist""? For starters,  It's got great action, terrific comedy, a splendid blend of film noir, science-fiction and crime drama, dramatic moments that will move you to tears and a wonderful sense of pacing. It paints a marvelously convincing portrait of a universe smeared with corruption and on the verge of anarchy, a universe that may be set in the future but feels exactly like now. And lastly, it boasts one of the greatest soundtracks of all time, courtesy of the irreplaceable Yoko Kanno. In short, ""Cowboy Bebop"" is a show that has something for everyone and things that people don't like wind up enjoying anyway.

But most of all, ""Cowboy Bebop"" has got great characters that we identify with, characters that we love so much that we empathize their plights and even dread when their lives are threatened. There's Spike Spiegel, an expert gunman and martial artist whose seemingly laid-back attitude conceals his longing for a woman he loved and lost. There's Jet Black, a former ISSP police officer who has grown disillusioned with the world he used to serve. And last but not least, there's Faye Valentine, a gambling addict suffocating under a mountain of debt while also hiding a painful secret that has left her alienated and rejecting solitude. Adding to this cast of wounded souls are genius hacker Radical Edward and the data dog Ein, who is not your average Welsh Corgi.

""Cowboy Bebop"" is about four bounty hunters who struggle to live in a universe while being haunted by their turbulent pasts. This is immensely appealing. Whereas in a typical sci-fi anime, a protagonist would seek a reward that would make them prosperously rich and escape somewhere at the far reaches of space, the ""Bebop"" try to make ends meet, hunting their targets to sustain themselves and coming in terms with their personal demons. Their top priority isn't wealth or even escape, but survival. If that isn't universal, then nothing is.

The beauty of watching ""Cowboy Bebop"" is seeing the characters grow and realize where their place in the universe is. At first, they seem like a squabbling family whose presence irks one another. The interplay between these four is touching, even hilarious; they could be four people at work, except their work is to hunt criminals. But by the end of the series, the characters (as well as us) mourn their hasty disbandment, as one returns to her home planet to find what she lost and the other goes back to confront HIS past, one that will never stop until either it or he is destroyed. It's melancholic without being overly depressing, but as they always say, every beginning as its end.

Watching ""Cowboy Bebop"" today, I'm amazed at how fresh it is. Seeing the whole 26-episode series is like getting acquainted with an old friend and remembering the fun moments we spent together. Anyone who saw ""Cowboy Bebop"" the first time will never forget the spectacular space battles (""Wild Horses"", ""Gateway Shuffle""), the intense action (the church shootout in ""Ballad of Fallen Angels"", the alley brawl in ""Jupiter Jazz Pt. I"", Spike's riveting battle with a psychotic madman in ""Pierrot le Fou"" and the climatic sequence in ""The Real Folk Blues Pt. II"", and more), hilarious comedy (""Mushroom Samba"", ""Cowboy Funk"") and genuine moments of pathos (""Waltz for Venus"", ""Hard Luck Woman""). They certainly won't forget the wonderful dialogue (""In order to receive, you have to give"". ""There are three things I particularly hate: kids, animals and women with attitude"". ""How long you've been listening?""/""Too long. Your story needs editing"". ""If you see a stranger, follow him"". ""Man, I hate theme parks."" ""It's all a dream?"". ""Easy come, easy go."" ""I'm going out there to find out if I'm really alive"", just to name a few), which now feels welcoming at a time when most Japanese cartoons feature uninspired one-liners and boring exposition.

And the music! Oh, how I love the music. For many viewers, including myself, my introduction towards jazz, blues, country, ambient music, salsa, funk, classical music and even 60s-70s rock n' roll came not from a radio station but from this very show. I would never have gotten into the likes of Miles Davis, Waylon Jennings, Moby, Funkadelic and Massive Attack if I didn't hear ""Piano Black"", ""Forever Broke"", ""Cats on Mars"", ""Ave Maria"", ""Mushroom Hunting"" and ""Spokey Dokey"". But praising the soundtrack because of its diversity is damning it with faint praise. Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelts' music represent the heart and soul of the show, capturing the mood, atmosphere and emotional power of what happens on screen. Fewer songs are charmingly hilarious as ""Want It Back"" and the Morricone-influenced ""Go Go Cactus Man"". Few anime song get you emotionally riled up like the thunderous ""Rain"" and the potent ""Space Lion"". And if you don't weep when listening to ""Call Me, Call Me"", ""Blue"" and the electrifying ""Real Folk Blues"" after watching this show, then there's something wrong with you.

And last but not least, let's talk about the English dub. My God, is it amazing? Most English dubs are either charmingly cheesy or feel like a pale imitation of the original Japanese version, but Bebop's English voice acting sounds just as good today as it did back in 1999. When released in America, Japanese cartoons either lived or died by the dubbing and ""Cowboy Bebop""'s English voice acting is so superlative, so emotionally resonant that even the show's creator feels it surpasses the original. Not a bad compliment, considering that the Japanese version featured the likes of Koichi Yamadera, Megumi Hayashibara and Unsho Ishizuka.

""Cowboy Bebop"" is on more of everyone's favorite anime lists than any Japanese cartoon in existence and for good reason; it is an anime that even people who hate anime love. Seeing the anime again and again, it never feels over-familiar, only fresher and more relevant. Funimation has truly hit a home run in snatching ""Bebop"" and preparing its Blu-Ray release in mid-December. And seriously, what better Christmas gift to give to a new generation of fans than the Blu-Ray box set of ""Cowboy Bebop""? It is one of animation's greatest treasures, and like all great treasures, it will continue to endure while many of its contemporaries have been long forgotten and buried.

8672991,5,B00MMOZ1SS,Loved this show growing up. It's my all time favorite anime and this box set did not disappoint. The art and sketch books are great and obviously the show is too. Only thing that's bothered me was the way the menus are set up but once you get the hang of it it's no longer an issue. I'd suggest watching it in English as this is by far one of the best dubs of all time the voice acting is just phenomenal. See you space cowboy....,1514592000,,430,4.011627906976744

As stated by others, Blu Ray audio could be louder, but other than that, perfect for die hard fans, or those new to the show. Won't disappoint. Discs styled as vinyl records an excellent touch, and quality of video on them is supurb.",1512172800,,331,4.724137931034483
8672993,4,B00MMOZ1SS,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my dad, since it is his favorite show of all time and having missed my chance for the Limited Editions when they first came out, I was really excited to have another chance at it and splurged on it. The video, sound, and show itself would all receive a resounding 5 stars, but I'm really disappointed that you cannot turn on the subs while watching the dub. My dad is hard of hearing and subtitles are a must for him. This is typical of Funimation releases unfortunately, but that slipped my mind when I was purchasing it. Luckily he's seen this show so many times he has the dialogue practically memorized, but it still upset me that the lack of something so simple to implement means he can't fully enjoy it.

I was also a little disappointed with the artbook. For what this set cost, it could have been printed on some higher quality paper. The box is really nice, though.",1502323200,4,916,4.420118343195266
