6061503,4,B00G5RWTYC,it is a good picture. Sylvia kristel has a little cast alas. The picture has a good suspense,1430179200,,92,4.166666666666667
6061504,3,B00G5RWTYC,"This has the one and only Sylvia Kristel, who everyone knows from those classic Emmanuelle films. She graces this interesting and very odd thriller with perfection. What you have is a bunch of rich pricks breaking into houses and brutally raping and making the husband watch while they do it. You have your main inspector Van der Walk who is played by the stunning Bryan Marshall.

Now what makes the inspector stand out is he don't take it. He's angry. He's frustrated. He's horrified at the brutal sadistic crimes that these pricks are doing.

But what starts out as a simple making them pay for their crimes isn't so easy. These monsters have ties to high-ranking individuals in the Dutch society community and so the inspector finds it hard to get the criminals, because the runaround of political reasons and the aspect of big-money.

Soon the inspector realizes that playing by the book to take these monsters, these sadistic rapist, these awful criminal monsters off the street is going to be harder than he thinks. Soon he has to play by no rules.

This is a very simple film yet has that brutal rape aspect to it. After watching this film I don't think it could be made today or be as affective as it is today as it was then. Today it would be chopped up and made glamorized into a Hollywood version that would lose a lot of its disturbing nature at times. This was during a time were films touched on the reality of what life is and of what innocence is and when that life is taken or that innocence is destroyed it truly meant something and was not just a passing news story.

This is a European film that creates a tragedy of violence and ultimately those who seek the true  justice to right the wrong.

One 7 Movies did a fantastic job bringing this forgotten piece of cinema out.

Now this was originally titled Because of the Cats. This is directed by an amazing director and most of all, he also acted. Fons Rademakers sadly passed away in 2007.

Now what's amazing about Fons is his first directed movie is the 1958 Village by the River which was the first Dutch film to ever be nominated for an Oscar. In 1986 he won the best Oscar for foreign film The Assault. Each of his films stand out. Many of his films caused controversy, many of his films were created from literary classic books that he created into film. He produced many of his movies. He created his own new world and atmosphere in his cinema. Most of his films are considered masterpieces and are truly worthy to seek out and to entertain yourself.

6061505,3,B00G5RWTYC,"This film has been released under many names. I originally saw it as The Rape Because Of The Cats, and it still has the Because Of The Cats title card.  I see that the Amazon reviewers have rated it at every star level, possibly  because of their expectations.  The film was made in 1973 and needs to be considered in that context.  At the time, it had one of most startling rape scenes viewers had seen, and one of the very few in which the victim was (approximately) middle-aged, and taken from behind.  I suspect that this print is very slightly toned down  from the Euro original, but I'm not sure.  It is, by far and away, the best copy I have ever seen, in a crisp anamorphic  transfer (vastly superior to the VHS tapes).  It was also, at the time of release, criticized for its unorthodox story-telling, although I doubt anyone would say that now.  Other reviewers have summarized the plot so I won't recap.  Personally, I thought it was weakly acted and forgettable, but it is also a cultural oddity and I'm glad it's been preserved as a quality DVD.
  If only a few thousand better movies were treated as well...",1405296000,17,1121,4.463054187192118
6061506,1,B00G5RWTYC,"This is a re-issue of ""Afraid of the cats"" under a  new name... Disraceful- they did not indixate anywhere that this was thwe case!!  deceptive advertising IMHO.",1405296000,,161,4.925925925925926
6061507,4,B00G5RWTYC,"Murky drama with Bryan Marshall (!) giving a sound, low-key (!!) performance as an Amsterdam cop on the trail of a gang of Hooray Henry subversives intent on mayhem of the  gritty 7o's, Euro flares and sideburns variety. Okay yah ?

After an early, tone-setting robbery/assault, lewdly orchestrated to unsettle the viewer for the rest of the film, 'Brutalization' (or 'Because of the Cats', as I've always known it.), finds it's true calling as a strongish, well-acted, slightly extreme take on a well-worn social bete noir: ie, Do you know what YOUR kids are doing between the time they've finished their teas and when they stumble up the stairs just as dawn's breaking ? Always a sobering thought.
These 'kids' are definitely not alright. Their pathetic pampered lives make them easy prey to a malajusted, anti-authority guru who exploits their tedious existences and turns them into vicious yardies with a bent for violent sex and destruction.
It's a kind of slower, less fun, un-stylised 'A Clockwork Orange', and just about succeeds because of it.

Resisting belching with laughter at any picture where gruff, lugubrious Bry is the leading man is the biggest challenge any watcher of 'Brutalization' faces, but it's difficult not to warm to his clenched, avid performance as the battle-weary Schiphol scuffer.  He's in a bad way, viewers: Smoking, drinking, taking drugs, shacking up with a prostitute... (Yes, all that IS bad !). And of course, the nasty nippers have powerful parents with expensive lawyers and high up friends in the force to thwart his investigation at every turn.
Oh, and did I mention that his character is called Van der Valk ? Shome mishtake shurely ? But no....

Bry carries 'Brutalization' like the old pro he is. Alarming check jackets and hazardous shirt collars notwithstanding, he transforms what could've ended up a rather tawdry slab of grindhouse into something resembling a darkly respectable rozzer show. After the first appalling crime, director Fons Rademakers mainly keeps the sleaze under wraps, and a rather skilful, moderately worrying mystery results. The very tone of the piece grips, and it has a satisfying everyday ugliness, far removed from modern noisy glitz.  Make a great double-header with 'Thriller: A Cruel Picture', with which it shares a modulating stoicism.

Plusses: For some odd but pleasing reason, solid British character actors like George Baker and Edward Judd (a long way from 'Island of Terror' and 'Vengence of She') pop up here and there in small roles; future kit-off popsy Sylvia Kristel makes her exploitation debut - and 'big' Bry flashes his meat and two (!!!).  Strap yourselves in, ladies..

Moot annoyance: the cover picture isn't from the film, nor is it in any way representative of it.",1403222400,3,2767,5.0905077262693155
6061508,5,B00G5RWTYC,"It's a shame that One 7 Movies has released this under an alternate title (Original titie is BECAUSE OF THE CATS) and used such a awful cover picture for the DVD because this is a first rate thriller from the early 70's! Drawing inspiration from A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and the recent Manson murders, it explores themes of youth gone wild and the rebellion against authority. Very well done with solid acting all around!",1398556800,2,415,4.698630136986301

6061510,3,B00G5RWTYC,"This movie is misrepresented.  Maybe in Belgium this qualifies as a rape/revenge movie but not in the states.  Sylvia Kristel is in the movie and takes her clothes off some but she is not the star.

In reality a woman gets raped by a group of young men in front of her husband then they bring in the cops.  From there the movie is just an average cop drama.  The is both male and female frontal nudity but most of the time the characters keep their clothes on.  Not much action by today's standard but kind of interesting.  More a rental than one to buy unless you can get it cheap.",1393977600,28,582,4.1891891891891895

6061529,3,B00G5RWTYC,Sylvia Kristel has little to do with this movie except having the only name someone would recognize.

6061535,3,B00G5RWTYC,"It's OK ... but there are a few issues. You need to remember the time ... early 70's when this was produced and that makes it easier to watch as far as some of the cinematic issues that jump out at you as kind of cheesy. Lots of nudity for nudity's sake ... violence and rape ... but that was expected. I guess on that I can say I've seen it done better even in the 60's and 70's era movies. When the movie comes on the first thing you notice is the title is not ""Brutalization"" ... but rather ""Because of the cats"" and Sylvia Kristel is not the star of the movie but rather a character in the story .... and not really what I would call a main character. The story line probably is easier to understand if you read the original novel but because of the editing it's a bit choppy and doesn't flow very well story line wise.
Watched it on my iPad while on a business trip .... it killed time ... but can't say I'd ever add it to my collection ... glad I rented it instead.",1436486400,7,971,4.010309278350515

The movie is about a bunch of young people who are members of a weird antisocial cult that gets out of control.

There's a lot of pretty girls in this movie. That was a different era.
