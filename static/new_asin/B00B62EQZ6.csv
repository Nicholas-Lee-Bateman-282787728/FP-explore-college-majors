5559500,3,B00B62EQZ6,"Soneri moves to Turin where there are crimes but no fog, and, after the first episode, no Angela. It's a complete restart of the series with only Luca Barbareschi remaining from the original cast and a completely different feel, just OK and more like a pedestrian American TV cop show.",1369526400,10,285,4.72
5559501,5,B00B62EQZ6,I absolutely love this series and hope there is more to come. i enjoy foreign mystery films and series and I find this one particularly interesting.,1368057600,5,148,4.730769230769231
5559502,4,B00B62EQZ6,"this season was as good as the previous two
good twist which i do not want to give away
well worth the price",1367625600,3,108,3.739130434782609
5559503,5,B00B62EQZ6,"A cut above many Italian detective series.  Beautiful in attention to detail.  Indeed, enjoyment of food always a part of
Italian drama.",1366156800,3,136,5.136363636363637
5559504,4,B00B62EQZ6,"If you like to spend a couple hours watching a police procedure/mystery movie,not badly done, this is for you. Always entertaining, although the last episode is a little amateurish ( but still entertaining.)",1365638400,,207,5.303030303030303
5559505,5,B00B62EQZ6,"A complete pleasure is this excellent series.
I have viewed all three seasons and found it
well acted with an engaging set of characters.
Entertaining and worth your time.
Too bad the series is now cocmplete and the
main protagonist has entered Italian politics.",1363046400,14,262,4.9772727272727275
5559506,3,B00B62EQZ6,"As all of this series, eloquent Italian, well done in most part, but dully shot making the beauty of Italy into a funereal back drop.  Strories are barely passable albeit somewhat intriguing.  Stories touch on the topical without any real depth and too much inferred sentimentality.",1428451200,,282,5.108695652173913
5559507,5,B00B62EQZ6,Amazing performance of Lucas Barbareschi.  So sad is the last season.,1428105600,,69,5.2727272727272725
5559508,3,B00B62EQZ6,It was okay but I liked the first season better. I won't be getting any more of this series.,1424649600,,92,3.8947368421052633
5559509,5,B00B62EQZ6,Loved this series too.  All good episodes and great viewing.,1410998400,,60,5.0
5559510,5,B00B62EQZ6,Excellent series and great entertainment. The episodes are full of intrigue and they keep you wanting to see more. Bring out series 4!!,1402185600,,135,4.913043478260869
5559511,4,B00B62EQZ6,"Wow, the actor who plays Soneri, the main character, really projects tenderness and burly charm in this third season. His scenes with the lady doctor who claims his attention sizzle. Season 3 is by far the best of the 3 seasons in my opinion, much better written than Season l or 2.
Do you suppose he's going to continue improving at this rate?",1397347200,,344,4.476190476190476
5559512,4,B00B62EQZ6,"i laughed because soneri has a new hair cut!  this is a good series,
and season 3 turns soneri in a new direction.  he is made ""more
human.""
i enjoy this series in conjunction  with the commisario mantalbano
series  which is set in  sicily while soneri is set in the north.

the contrast is fascinating not only geographically but culturally.",1391126400,,342,4.616666666666666
5559513,4,B00B62EQZ6,"Season 3 brings closure for the Inspector on many personal and professional levels.  The final episode is worth the purchase alone.  If you are a fan of Fog and Crimes, this is a must-have to complete your collection.",1379289600,4,217,4.684210526315789
5559514,5,B00B62EQZ6,"We are anxiously awaiting the publication of Season 4 on DVD.  If you are interested in the lives of Northern Italians and don't mind subtitles, you are in for a treat following murder mysteries in another culture!",1375315200,3,214,4.783783783783784
5559515,5,B00B62EQZ6,I enjoyed every episode and they get better if you watch the entire 3 series in sequence as they build on each other.  The Italian is easy to understand if you have a basic knowledge of the language.  I especially enjoyed the series as I previously lived in Ferrara.,1373932800,,266,4.408163265306122
8563121,3,B00B62EQZ6,"Main character seems to bee the only one ...acting, we finished the whole series mostly because its Italian.
The plots are quite good and the slow tempo is good for the soul.",1514937600,,174,4.46875
8563122,5,B00B62EQZ6,Love the series,1504310400,,15,4.333333333333333
8563123,5,B00B62EQZ6,See my review under Season No. 2! Yes.  Fabulous!,1463616000,,49,4.444444444444445
8563124,5,B00B62EQZ6,Soneri very good; not too far behind johan falk and luther,1461542400,,58,4.363636363636363
8563125,4,B00B62EQZ6,"With a new love interest and overtures of a family in the offing, Season Three builds on the previous two seasons with a slightly more dramatic back story. The central character, Soneri, finds himself less interested in his career and more in his life away from crimes and murder. His backup team at work worries about him and, in at least one case, worries that he will continue instead of retire or accept a promotion. His new love interest shows him the world from a different angle than his previous ""girlfriend"" and points out that he is way too self centered for a real relationship.

Oh, and he continues to solve murders in an inelegant manner, smoking...or often just chewing on...a cigar, and insulting his ranking superiors at every opportunity. Coiumbo in an Italian suit.",1446249600,,784,4.807407407407408
8563126,3,B00B62EQZ6,I thought it was going to be good but boring.,1442361600,,45,3.6
8563127,4,B00B62EQZ6,After awhile it is like not even having sub titles.  Good character acting.  No commercials!,1442102400,,92,5.066666666666666
8563128,5,B00B62EQZ6,FANTASTICO on all levels.,1440374400,,25,5.5
8563129,5,B00B62EQZ6,I really enjoy this series - the tapes arrived on time,1431907200,,54,4.0
8563130,2,B00B62EQZ6,"The first in the series was well done. Luca Barbareschi created an interesting character, hard, moody, impatient, but a core of kindness and compassion was there as well. Angela was special, and together they created a relationship that was fascinating to watch unfold. The secondary characters added to the way stories unfolded; his assistant deferential, but quietly there. The Italian culture, in part, unfolded easily and as part of life and a unique perspective - food, sex, relationships, friendships - added richness to the series.
So then what happened. Well, Luca became a producer, and with authority to act and an astonishing display of arrogance, the actor, and now  actor-producerproducer decided that he didn't need to work with actors who had contributed to this series. Instead, he became a one man band with a display of nastiness, impatience and arrogance toward those that worked for him. Nearly everyone; no, in fact, everyone in the cast did not more than stand waiting for Luca to unravel the crime. And unravel he did as the only member of the crime force to interview suspects, analyze the evidence, and then re-analyze. This became subservience taken beyond credibility/ This series went downhill in every way and the last few episodes made little to no sense. Instead of an ensemble of fine actors, the frame became more and more and then way too much of Luca. Too bad.  Don't bother paying for this series. You'll be disappointed.",1428710400,3,1457,5.016528925619835
