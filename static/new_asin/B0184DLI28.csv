7539127,5,B0184DLI28,"One of the best American films ever made, The Graduate is the story of Benjamin Braddock, a recent college graduate mired in the malaise of boredom and anxiety that comes following school's end. He's seduced by a beautiful neighbor, played by the sexy and extremely talented actress Anne Bancroft. The two begin an affair but things get complicated when Braddock becomes infatuated with his lover's daughter.

Filled with intense and powerful performances, particularly from Dustin Hoffman and Bancroft, along with a killer soundtrack from Simon and Garfunkel, this is must-see cinema for any film buff. Also, the Criterion edition is a treasure-trove of extras, including two commentaries.",1447804800,9,690,5.4485981308411215

7539134,5,B0184DLI28,"Have enjoyed this movie from day one I have it on laser disk, Blu-ray, and now criterion addition. Can honestly say this is the best version I've seen , I doubt very much if it can get much better considering the fact that it's almost 50 years old. The picture is sharp, clear and the colors are right on, natural and solid. The 5.1 audio is excellent Simon and Garfunkel never sounded better. All of the extras was just icing on the cake love it! After watching the movie I put on my old Blu-ray just to see the difference in quality, although the disc was good it doesn't come up to the criterion standard the colors were just slightly faded. Bottom line if you like this movie and want to have it for your collection I highly recommend it.",1463270400,3,742,4.307142857142857
7539135,4,B0184DLI28,"Wanted the Graduate on Blu Ray in hopes that the soundtrack would be improved over the DVD. Well, even though this is a ""Criterion Collection"" the sound is thin and flat. Perhaps that is true to it's 60's roots, but I expected more dynamics. The Simon and Garfunkle albums with most of the tracks (Bookends, Sounds of Silence) sound 1000% better.

Won't comment too much on the movie contents, most folks love it or hate it.",1462060800,2,424,4.578947368421052
7539136,5,B0184DLI28,"Picture and sound  blows away the most recent bluray that is avaiable.toss your old version in the trash or trade it in. This criterion copy is all you need,picture is a splash grainy,but not enough to make a big deal out of it, colors and music soundtrack look and sound as if movie was made this year,not bad for a movie thats pushing 50 years old. Bottom line,buy it,you will not be disappointed. Mrs Robinson is so sexy and cool,that even thou the fashion and hair styles are dated,if she was to walk into a bar or a restaurant today,she would need a stick to beat the guys off her. I think she was hotter than her daughter. Mrs Robinson was the original MILF, no dout about it. Buy the movie,sit back and enjoy this classic flick.",1461801600,8,735,4.364963503649635
7539137,5,B0184DLI28,"One of my favorite movies ever, finally in blu ray and on a Criterion release, no less! The special features are fantastic. The only thing I miss is the Dustin Hoffman/Katharine Ross commentary from the 2007 DVD release. Not the greatest commentary, but I still like to listen to it once in a while. I may be in the minority here, because the part of the story that moves me the most has always been Benjamin and Elaine's, and watching the way he comes alive and falls absolutely and completely when he meets her. I watch their scenes together and am entranced. Fantastic chemistry. Anne Bancroft is magnificent as Mrs. Robinson but I would not want to meet that character in a dark alley. Or ever.",1460332800,2,698,4.5476190476190474
7539138,3,B0184DLI28,"I'm starting to wonder about CRITERION- of late, they are duplicating already EXISTING excellent editions of various BR films-with little if any improvement-at least not worth spending another $30....THE GRADUATE...EASY RIDER...THE NEW WORLD...DR STRANGELOVE etc

He meets the wily Mrs. Robinson at his party and takes her to her home. This sets off a series of playful exchanges between the two and ultimately an affair. To complicate matters, Ben falls for Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine, which infuriates her mother. Top this off with an excellent Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack and you have the must-own Blu-ray of the year.

7539146,5,B0184DLI28,"I just spent the better part of a day watching the movie and enjoying the massive set of extra features.....
the movie is much better looking than the previous edition on blu ray, no side by side comparison is needed it is that obvious. There are a couple of commentary tracks (one in particular with Mike Nichols taking part)  I hope to enjoy but have not as yet.  There is a new nearly 40 minutes with Dustin Hoffman that bears repeat viewings and a new interview with writer Buck Henry and Lawrence Truman, the producer, which was very illuminating on the process of getting this film made and more.  Another enjoyable half hour feature is on Mike Nichols long time editor Sam O'steen hosted by his widow. One great thing about this set is they also have been able to get the rights to the terrific (non HD) bonus features from the 2 disc DVD set MGM released several years ago and have included them as part of the supplementary features...... and the few minutes of Paul Simon from a Dick Cavett show interview decades back is the cherry on top!  I've always loved this movie, the music, the story, the acting and I can assure anyone who is wondering if it is worth an upgrade...YES!!!",1455926400,20,1190,4.49537037037037
7539147,5,B0184DLI28,"On the afternoon that the Academy Awards for 1967 were being presented, I was at the home of novelist Harold Robbins, along with actor Edd Byrnes, producer Joseph E. Levine and several other people.

Chatting with Levine, I told him that I thought his film, THE GRADUATE, would win the Best Picture award and that I had money riding on it.

I hope you lose, he said.

Joe, his wife admonished, thats a terrible thing to say. Turning to me, she apologized, You must forgive my husband.

No problem, I said. Why would you want me to lose? I asked him.

Because, next year Ive got the movie thats going to sweep the awards.

Whats that?

THE LION IN WINTER, he said.

I lost my bet. THE GRADUATE only won one award that night. Best Direction went to Mike Nichols, but the Best Picture honors went
to IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT.

I must admit that the following year, when THE LION IN WINTER lost the Best Picture Oscar to OLIVER!, I smiled.

I still think that THE GRADUATE was the Best Picture of 1967 and, after almost fifty years, it has certainly endured the test of time.

Enhanced by the unforgettable music of Simon and Garfunkel, THE GRADUATE tells of Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman), who spends his first bewildering summer out of school being seduced by Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), the wife of his fathers best friend, and also falling in love with the womans daughter (Katherine Ross).

The new Blu-ray 4K digital restoration (with uncompressed monaural soundtrack and an optional 5.1 surround remix) from The Criterion Collection is filled with extras.

These include audio commentary from 2007 featuring director Mike Nichols in conversation with filmmaker Steven Soderbergh, audio commentary from 1987 featuring film scholar Howard Suber, a new interview with actor Dustin Hoffman, a new conversation between producer Lawrence Turman and actor-screenwriter Buck Henry, a new interview with film writer and historian Bobbie OSteen about editor Sam OSteens work on THE GRADUATE, and STUDENTS OFTHE GRADUATE, a short documentary from 2007 on the films influence.

There is also THE GRADUATE"" AT 25, a 1992 featurette on the making of the film, an interview with Nichols by Barbara Walters, from a 1966 episode of NBCs Today show, an excerpt from a 1970 appearance by singer-songwriter Paul Simon on The Dick Cavett Show, plus screen tests, a trailer and an essay by journalist and critic Frank Rich.

8741353,3,B0184DLI28,"A compelling look at the late 60s, as seen through the eyes of a recent college graduate who returns to his upper class digs in LA to confront the issue of what he plans on doing with the rest of his life. Hoffman brilliantly captures the indifference of Ben, the aimless main character, as he navigates the seductive waters of Mrs. Robinson. But is the Ben character sufficiently developed? I believe this is the one big flaw in this film because frankly, I didn't like him. He is a creature driven mostly by a carnal urge inspired by the older woman, so in that respect his own sexual identity has been created by her image of him. Does that make sense? Mrs. Robinson makes the age old mistake of telling her lover he cant have a certain woman, which makes him want her more. Oscar in this one goes to Anne Bancroft who, incidentally, is only 5 years older than Hoffman. Shows you how Sixties Hollywood portrayed older actresses.",1535155200,,931,4.514792899408284

8741358,5,B0184DLI28,"This review is for the Criterion Collection blu-ray of The Graduate.

""Fully restored"" has become a marketing cliche, but this one is for real and should be called a ""super restoration.""  In fact, this blu-ray puts the original 1967 theatrical run to shame. Back then, many theaters suffered with worn imperfect prints, old lenses, damaged screens, or masking that sacrificed parts of the picture information. Now, the sharpness, contrast, and color register the lushness that was on the original negative, the sound is rich and clear, and the proper camera composition is fully visible in the correct dimensions.  Viewers who are familiar with this movie may see content and meaning that weren't apparent before, such as very subtle nuances in facial expressions and tiny details in actors' eyes.  The Criterion folks deserve credit for going the extra mile on the restoration, because care and attention to detail make a big difference.

So The Graduate now feels like a new experience.  The casting, direction, acting, lighting, composition, music, and camera work of course were always outstanding.  It's still remarkable how Mike Nichols used long takes, all four corners of the Panavision screen, and movement of the actors in lieu of conventional over-the-shoulder back-and-forth cutting.  (The sheer artistry of the long takes and use of set-depth calls to mind Citizen Kane.)

The storyline provides 100% entertainment on one viewing, but the technical beauty sustains a second viewing, then Commentary Track 1, then Commentary Track 2.  The numerous supplementary materials provide deeper understanding of the remarkable effort that went into casting, rehearsals, coaching the actors, scouting the locations, and using ""practical effects.""  For instance, car driving scenes, crowd scenes, night scenes, views through glass windows, and rain were all done as practicals, without green screens, CGI, stabilizer gyros, or similar technology.  They really, really don't make them like this anymore!

The Graduate was clearly a labor of love and team artistry by Mike Nichols, cast and crew.  If you are a fan of this movie, this Criterion blu-ray is the crisp, clear, colorful, beautiful version you have been waiting for.",1490486400,13,2228,5.38328530259366
8741359,5,B0184DLI28,Life is lived in the moment you live it for the present. Everything about how this picture comes together is impeccable. It's brought a sense of humanness in a time frame that evolves with culture. Than culture evolves at itself as you see the lead actor interact than react on his feelings and perceptions of the world. Also (prequel) to culture shift on sex and the media with pie thing and the girl from another country teenage life process. This brought that (other) franchise into life. But the music in this story made it that much more important. It allowed for you to hear the insides of his experience and story.,1488844800,,621,4.603603603603603
