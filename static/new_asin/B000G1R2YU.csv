2597689,5,B000G1R2YU,"I WAS VERY TOUCHED BY THIS MOVING, SAD STORY. THE ACTING IS WONDERFUL, THE MESSAGE IS CLEAR AND IT IS FULL OF LOVE AND HOPE.
THE SOUNDTRACK GIVES AN EXTRA SENSITIVE TOUCH WITH IT'S BEAUTIFUL MUSIC, MAKING THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE AN EMOTIONAL MOMENTO.",1225324800,5,247,4.767441860465116
2597690,5,B000G1R2YU,I saw this movie on tv and taped it years ago and enjoy watching it from time to time when the world seems crazy just to bring me back to a little reality. The story line was dramatic and very heart felt as to how it was all brought about. Getting on with life such as it is for however length of time we have and trying to leave some mark on society for the family to embrace was very powerful. And I loved the ending of togetherness and understanding and wishes being granted. When I found it to buy I just had to add it to my family collectibles.,1209427200,4,549,4.0

2597720,4,B000G1R2YU,I actually thought I was ordering another movie with a similar title (my bad) but watched this all the way through and ended up liking it. The vendor sent it out immediately and was very happy about that.,1413417600,,204,4.394736842105263

8128497,5,B000G1R2YU,"As a hospice nurse from years ago, I understood the emotional side of this movie, the dramatics of the broken family, watching a child die, and there is no happy ending to dying with cancer.  There was a romance between her and the boyfriend but the true romance was with her ex-husband.  There was lots of humor...the type that people from the South may only understand.  The was not a romantic comedy that the couple lives happily ever after.",1518566400,,444,4.594936708860759
8128498,1,B000G1R2YU,This is NOT a romantic comedy. It is a very emotional story of a woman dying of cancer. A good movie if you want to have your eyes watering' but aterrible romantic comedy.,1517702400,,171,4.212121212121212
8128499,5,B000G1R2YU,"I really enjoyed this movie. It wasn't what I expected, as its description calls it a romantic comedy. It indeed has some light and charming elements, but really it's a very poignant and emotional story and not a comedy. It's a simple story told with a surprisingly good script. It's an older movie, and slower paced than films tend to be now. But I liked that about it. The mindfulness of the detailed pacing drew me into the characters. The actors were all wonderful in it. Watching it made me get my hanky out, but the emotional moments were well portrayed and never mawkish or over sentimentalized.",1517184000,,602,4.635514018691588
8128500,3,B000G1R2YU,"Listed a romantic comedy?????? As a breast cancer survivor, for now, anyway,  I REALLY wanted to  find the comedy in this movie.  Since my mother's breast cancer recently metastasized  to bone cancer,  I would love to laugh as often as I can.  Perhaps viewers who are strangers to cancer will find what I was unable to see",1516752000,,322,4.56140350877193
