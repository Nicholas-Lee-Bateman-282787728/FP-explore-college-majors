8514454,4,B007CBWHZQ,"I was not a fan at all of Fat Pizza, and am yet to check out Swift & Shift, but Paul Fenech has definitely made a hilarious cult classic here with his Houso's show showing an exaggerated parody look at the life of the commuters of a housing community in Australia. Paul plays Frankie, a doll bludger (welfare cheat) who gets up to mischief by stealing, vandalizing and being a degenerate with his buddies. His best mates are a cry baby adult named Dazza, and his Kiwi mate Kev. Their missus Shazza and Vanessa are as bogan (redneck) as it gets in Australia.

The show pretty much is parody of long time Aussie soap Neighbours, and Home & Away, but probably closer to the truth of reality than either of the shows would make you beleive. The show doesn't have much of a plot going for it, as it's mostly just making fun of Centrelink (welfare office) and avoiding the cops and who Frankie has as his de fac-to for the episode, either a cute little very young looking girl named Kylie, or her older sister, or, perhaps sometimes both... which may not sound like much, but the show is hilarious most of the time, and if you like what you see in the first episode, you are sure to come to enjoy this show and love the characters around Sunnyvale and the things they get up to, to pass time.

This shows humor is not for everyone tho, there is a lot of sex, drugs and illegal activity going on, so if you're looking for a family comedy, don't bother looking here. This is more the type of humor for fans of South Park, however even South Park lovers may get annoyed at the over exaggeration of the bogan accent. But like I said, if you can take the first episode, and find yourself liking it, the show just gets better and better.

Can't say the same for the Houso's Live video tho, that one was a bit annoying in just about every way thinkable, so don't go out of your way looking for the combo of Series 1 & 2 with the Live show, as the first 2 seasons are all you really need to try and find if you like this. (Excluding the movies that is)",1421452800,,2038,4.233933161953727
8514455,5,B007CBWHZQ,"I live in the US, and my friend lives in Australia. We talk back and forth and he told me about this show Housos and how hilarious it was, and showed me some clips of it on Youtube. After getting a laugh off of what he'd shown me in those video clips I decided to pick this show up along with a region free DVD player and give it a go. It's honestly really good, I was surprised that this show hadn't taken off and been the biggest thing out of Australia since Crocodile Dundee lol",1391212800,,481,4.020833333333333
8514456,5,B007CBWHZQ,This is an over all funny show and I was able to enjoy it with out being an Australian myself. The whole bogan concept was show to me by an Australian friend and he cleared up any slang used so I got a better understanding. Great Show!,1357948800,,235,4.0212765957446805
