8713631,2,B00WJXX2K6,"Oh, dear, where do I start? The plot was interesting, the acting pretty good, but they needed better editing.  Very choppy. And change of scene was 2-4 seconds of black screen.  It was obvious that swear words were removed, which left me wondering why they'd film a version with it in there.  The mother's character wasn't believable as a cop.  She didn't project an air of authority, and enabled her son to continue breaking the law by habitually begging her partner not to arrest her son, or go easy on him.  Her uniform was ill fitting, appeared too large, and except for a small patch on a sleeve, and service gun, didn't look like a policeman's uniform.  For a Christian film, it's not clear if the main characters are truly Christian.  A short scene at the local church, another where the mother sits in her patrol car crying/praying, and the girlfriend, who makes a statement she's a Christian. But she's been having sex with Red, and is pregnant by him.  And when her brother (the murderer) kills his best friend, attempts to kill Red, we're not given a motive for it.  Neither are we allowed to know how Red's trial went, or how many months or years he spent in prison.  I'm guessing his brother wasn't charged for killing the murderer. At the end, he's in a prison chapel, and the camera allows a glimpse of a pic inside a book Red is holding; a pic of his girlfriend holding a baby.  Then, a song is playing, and the scene switches back and forth from the chapel, to Red walking along a road, his hair slightly longer than normal.  A little confusing, but he's been released.  Yes, there's some violence, but not graphic.  The crowd Red was hanging around with, it wouldn't be believable if nothing of that sort happened.  And it was a relief that the females weren't scantily clad. The message of the gospel, and one's faith, is extremely weak.  The movie's poor portrayal of Christians is one that can be found on any given TV show. It was a waste of money, and I gave it to charity.",1506556800,,1996,4.487534626038781

8713633,3,B00WJXX2K6,"I really wanted to like this movie. I made myself watch it until the very end, hoping against hope that Red would hurry up and get a clue before something really terrible happened. I don't deal with visual violence very well and actually got up and left the room more than once because I was afraid of what was coming next.

The movie begins with Red returning home after a short incarceration. Red has an attitude. It seems that he blames his police officer mother for his problems  or at least the fact that his dad left them and she has tried to raise him and his younger brother on her own. Over and over Red gives in to peer pressure from friends he should avoid, making one bad decision after another that get him deeper and deeper in trouble. Unfortunately every time he has the opportunity to choose to do the right thing, he makes the wrong choice. The movie goes on interminably like this with alcohol, drugs, sex, violence, and criminal activity until it all hits the fan in a heartbreaking way.

Yes, Red had to hit bottom before his redemption but I did not need to be exposed to close to two hours of his descent. There was almost no indication that Ashes of Eden is even a Christian film with only a passing reference to God or Jesus. Then at the very end the viewer is abruptly treated to a brief scene with Red sharing his testimony with a room full of men in prison garb  very brief. Nowhere do we see Red making a decision for Christ but we must assume he did based on the fact that he is sharing with other prisoners.

This is not a movie that I would recommend to anyone and would strongly advise parents to watch before allowing their children to view it. The movie is unrated but I did see more than one site that had strong parental warnings about it. One reviewer said he would rate it at least a PG-13. I would have to agree. I am much older than that and it did not sit well with me.

8713634,4,B00WJXX2K6,"Ashes of Eden is a good movie that can teach us lots of things.
  I must admit that the beginning was very slow. I know you have to get all of the back story, but it could have moved along quicker.
  A police officer is trying to raise her two sons alone, but is having lots of financial  troubles. Her older son, Red gets in with the wrong crowd, but wants to help his mother. So he steals drugs to sell. So his troubles get worse and worse.
  His mother tries to keep him out of trouble with the law, which is her first mistake. Then Red gets kicked out of school and lands up in trouble again. So his mother kicks him out of the house.
  He gets into trouble deeper and deeper. People are being killed and he is on the run.
  The conclusion of Ashes of Eden is really thrilling. You will be sitting on the edge of your seat. I like the ending of the movie and will recommend it for all. It saddens me to see people get involved in the drug trade or crime. Sometimes it seems theres no way out.  I like the theme No man can serve two masters. Really good.
  One thing I didn't care for was the use of the language. I don't believe movies need swearing. This movie blocked out the swear words. I don't think that is any better than swearing. Just my opinion.",1465344000,,1259,4.065040650406504
8713635,4,B00WJXX2K6,"In our culture, it seems like we get used to the glamorous films of Hollywood.  Everything's professionally, smoothly done.  The acting is believable.  The lines flow.  So, it's interesting to watch independent films that aren't as professionally, smoothly done, where the acting is sometimes stilted, and the lines don't always flow.

How does one judge these films?  Are they good?  bad?  worth watching?

I watched one of these films yesterday.  This movie--Ashes of Eden.  The movie is about an 18 year old boy--he's really a boy in a man's body.  His mom is a cop and he's gotten out of the joint.  He returns to high school to find that he's been expelled.  All he's got is the ability to sell drugs.  And a girlfriend.

This is a Christian film, but it isn't as heavy handed as many I've seen (like The Princess Cut).  The filming is clearly independent film quality.  The acting is okay.  The plot's okay.  The credits were well done and remind me of the projects my brother in law worked on when he was in college (he majored in film).

If you enjoy crime dramas and want something a little less violent than a lot of what's out there, this would be an option.  It does have some cussing and some violence.  It is a redeeming story filled with tough decisions--the stuffings of life.  To some people, this film might not seem realistic.  But, it is to me.  I know several families who've had to make very tough decisions about their children's involvement in drugs.  This story tells some of their stories.

One last note... many families wonder about films this and what age it would be appropriate to watch it.  This movie is not rated, so that doesn't tell you much.  If I were to rate this movie, I'd probably rate it PG by our standards today; but as a parent, I'd rate it PG-13.

Please note that I received a complimentary copy of this movie from FishFlix for review.",1465257600,,1883,4.53134328358209

8713637,4,B00WJXX2K6,I've seen audiences well up with tears and cheer at the end. We've played to packed theaters and sold out record breaking shows at film festivals. I feel sorry for the person(s) that use all their time to try and bash the film. I'd give you a copy to watch and experience yourself. Maybe even a hug.,1461542400,,299,4.2631578947368425
