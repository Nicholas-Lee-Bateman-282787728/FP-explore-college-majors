5253841,5,B009369ZMQ,"If you like Sci-Fi cartoon's, you'll love Sky Commanders!  A continent coming up from the South Pacific Ocean?  Who would have thought that?  And two sides fighting over it, one good side and one bad side(classic!)  Throw in the volcanoes, monsters and earthquakes, and petty bickering.  The characters are great and at times funny.  And I found myself rooting for the good guys.  It's certainly not boring!",1369612800,2,407,4.985074626865671

8535017,5,B009369ZMQ,One of the grates from the late 1980's. This show only got 13 ep's very much needed a season 2. This show all so had a Very Cool toy line. This is a show that needs to make a come back. This Dvd is a Grate buy.,1425945600,,210,3.4893617021276597
8535018,5,B009369ZMQ,"I got this pretty quick when I ordered it. I barely remembered this show so I was excited to watch this. Went through it in a weekend and was awesome. The picture and sound was very good. I think I'll watch it again, what a fun series. That's what it's all about fun",1400457600,3,266,4.037735849056604
8535019,5,B009369ZMQ,"Sky Commanders is one of the many 1980s cartoons based off a line of toys.

The plot is explained in the opening narration: Deep in the South Pacific, a tumultuous and untamed new continent has erupted, spawned by a highly unstable new element, known as Pheta-7. If this powerful new element could be controlled, whoever possessed it would be the undisputed ruler of the world! One man, General Lucas Plague, is determined to hold that title. And it's up to a rugged team of mountaineering experts, lead by commander Mike Summit, to stop him. Employing revolutionary new gravity-lock and laser-cable technology to traverse the ever-changing terrain of the High Frontier, Mike Summit's Sky Commanders, and General Plague's Raiders, are locked in mortal combat, with the fate of the entire world hanging in the balance.

Both teams feature a wide array of characters from different countries all fighting over The High Frontier, which is a patchwork of jagged mountains, deep craggy valleys and dank sea caves that contain the element Pheta-7.  Because of its unstable properties the Pheta-7's radiation has mutated most of the creatures on or around the island so besides fighting each other the two teams must also battle horrible creatures trying to eat or kill them.

The series while short tells a complete story though the last episode leaves room for another season that sadly never materialized.

The stories are very well written and action packed as well as full of colorful characters. While the cast is large you quickly get to know who everyone is and follow their exploits.

The animation is also well done and exciting to watch, especially during action scenes.

My only critique is the show becomes repetitive, especially with Mike Summet falling and nearly getting killed each episode. But other than that I have no real complaints.

If your a fan of 1980s action cartoons like G.I. Joe or M.A.S.K. I highly recommend this often overlooked series.",1397865600,7,1962,5.033950617283951
8535020,5,B009369ZMQ,"I have been a fan of Sky Commanders ever since it first aired on TV. Over the years I have tried to find this show only to find some really bad bootlegs or sets missing episodes all together, until now!

With these made to order or whatever they call it DVD releases HB is putting out I now own one of my favorite cartoons in FANTASTIC quality. The picture is crisp and the sound is like perfect and considering the price it was a great addition to my ever growing cartoon collection. If you are considering this set do yourself a solid and grab and enjoy saturday morning again.

KEEP'EM COMING HANNA-B!",1390435200,2,604,4.383928571428571
8535021,5,B009369ZMQ,i remember this it brings back memories like the other cartoon the centurions but this is a very good cartoon to watch for your kids,1379548800,,132,4.32
8535022,4,B009369ZMQ,The story lines can be a little stale since this isn't a GIJOE or Transformers here...but it's somewhat of a new concept at the time centered on mountaineering type adventures with cables and pullies. I personally loved the toys and has a odd special place in my heart and always will.,1370995200,3,285,4.607843137254902
