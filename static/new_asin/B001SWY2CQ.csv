8340138,5,B001SWY2CQ,"There is a lot of material covered in this DVD that I was not expecting.  The EMD E units and the end of the glorious steam engine era with the 4449 Daylight and various cab forward shots are included to lead the viewer into the transition to the Diesel era.  There is a good mix of EMD and GE units from the 60s, 70s, and 80s, especially 4 axle power down in So Cal.  There is a good amount of SD45 and Tunnel Motor action, but not so much centered around Donner Pass.  At 1 hour and 43 minutes, there is a lot of nice footage of old diesels at work on the SP.  I also have SP When the Empire was Intact and Extreme SP and find no overlap in footage that was re-used to make the other videos.  If you want FM Trainmaster footage, I recommend SP When the Empire was Intact.  For Donner Pass footage, Extreme SP.  Charles Smiley videos are well narrated and superb.",1362009600,,864,4.101190476190476
8340139,5,B001SWY2CQ,"An excellent presentation on the Southern Pacific Railroads' use of late steam and diesel power on their lines.  Most of the filming is from 8mm and digitized to better the quality of the images.  Charles Smileys' narration goes over the various clips, talks about what is being shown, comments on the more interesting features and gives specifications of the various types. Some of the clips includes a brief screenshot of a map showing where the clips were taken and the areas that they covered on the different sections.  You get to see firsthand the paint schemes that were in use during this period on the different locomotives, a great aid to modelers.  You can also see the natural weathering that these hardworking locomotives underwent that helps if you chose to add that to your models.  You can also check out the various consists to see what lines were represented in the make up of freights and passenger trains of the Southern Pacific in its' heyday.  A little of the commuter trains is shown that would be an excellent addition to a model railroad as these were often seven cars or less pulled by a single locomotive in picturesque settings running between metro areas.  The three large yards in California are touched on so you can see some of these interesting places and get a few ideas of layouts that could be made up or added to larger layouts.",1254960000,,1365,4.7100840336134455
