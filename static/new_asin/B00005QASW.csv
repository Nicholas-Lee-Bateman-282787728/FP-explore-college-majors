7950051,5,B00005QASW,"This series is the object of a certain cult. It gives the investigations of crimes by the millionnaire policeman who navigates over social life, and particularly its criminal side, with style, education, civility and all that builds the personality of a millionnaire who likes works of art, women, big cars and spends some time everyday disentangling crime stories for his pure pleasure. The stories are always very well cut and told and they are pure pleasure in their logic. Gene Barry cut this character in such a personal way that he becomes kind of viewer-friendly : the viewers are the trusting friends of the inspector. They trust him to go to the root of the case and to find a very elegant way to do so and explain the crime. This elegance is neither too heady nor intellectual. You cannot get a migraine from the effort to follow the line of enquiry. A good entertainment.
