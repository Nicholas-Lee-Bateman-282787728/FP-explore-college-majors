8162468,2,B0000TAZ74,"Ho hum I watched the Beach Girls and the Monster and I, yes I who love old Sci Fi classics and campy movies can't remember much. Terrible, but not terrible in a good way like ""The Brain from Planet Arous"" which is a must have for collectors of the old campy, drive-in or Sci Fi movies. Yes you can really see the string on the brain towards the end of the film. So, 2 stars since the beach girls are worth 0 and the brain is worth 4.",1163030400,3,433,3.9318181818181817
