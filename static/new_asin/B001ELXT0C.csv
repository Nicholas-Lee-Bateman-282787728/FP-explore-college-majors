he is very entertaining in promos and is one of the best technical wrestlers on the planet all his matches are solid

multiple time champion olympic gold medalist as kurt would say freakin awesome!!!!",1245974400,,228,4.973684210526316
3555982,5,B001ELXT0C,"Angle was in the WWE for years and years, yet I don't think he ever got a dvd release. He certainly deserved one since he's one of the best. He was smart to leave the WWE, since all they really had left for him to do was JOB to Cena and be wasted in ECW. He was on moved Smackdown, to Raw, to Smackdown to ECW with-in like 2 years. So it goes to show that they ran out of ideas how to use him, he's not married to the bosses daughter after all. Anyway, he might have had more memorable matches in the WWE, like matches with Benoit, Rey Mysterio, Brock Lesnar, Edge, HBK, Hogan, Stone Cold, Eddie Guerrero, but he has still had some classic matches in TNA.

  The matches stop on the dvd, after his title loss to Samoa Joe. So try to seek out his recent matches with A.J Styles and Jeff Jarrett, they were also some of his best in his career. One of his best in TNA that was included on the dvd is his IWGP title defense against Yugi Nagata. I wish his IWGP title win from Brock Lesnar was also included though. I never saw the match where he lost the title, so I wish that was here as well. This sounds like a good dvd with a good list of matches. But I also think it's about time that a Jeff Jarrett dvd was released.",1233360000,,1218,3.9836065573770494
3555983,5,B001ELXT0C,"Finally we get the opportunity to hear the real life/career story from one of the greastest wrestlers of all time, Kurt Angle. Angle is a former 6 time WWE and World Heavyweight champion, 2 time TNA Heavyweight champion, 2 time NCAA national wrestling champion, 1995 World wrestling champion, and of course a 1996 Olympic gold medalist champion. Throughout this 2 disc set you will hear from Kurt himself along with a few members of his family & friends, Kurt's manager, wrestling coaches, Wrestling Legend Bruno Sammartino, and fellow members from the TNA roster including Jeff Jarrett, Samoa Joe, Dixie Carter(TNA President), Christian Cage, Mick Foley, Don West, and Mike Tenay. Disappointed to say though that Kurt's wife Karen Angle doesn't make a cameo whatsoever but reference is made about her during some of the interviews. The 2 discs focuses more on Kurt discussing his career and his life outside of wrestling.

Disc 1
The program starts off with Kurt's introduction into TNA and the night on Impact where he head butted Samoa Joe. That leads to the opening and Kurt telling about his childhood growing up in Pittsburg and losing his father at a young age. Wrestling with his older brothers and playing a variety of sports in high school. Describes how he grew into liking wrestling so much and soon getting a scholarship at Clairon University. Wrestling in college and winning the national title twice. Discussing how many of his family members enjoyed Kurt winning the World championships more then the Olympics. Soon Kurts starts going into depth about how he trained and got ready for the Olympics and the broken neck he suffered 3 months before the Olympic tryouts in Atlanta. The Iranian he had to wrestle in the finals. How emotional he was winning the gold medal in the United States. Then tells the post-Olympic life after winning the gold medal & when the Olympic fever died down. The jobs he was offered before getting interested in professional wrestling and meeting Karen. Makes reference to his career in the WWE and his true feelings towards Vince McMahon & other stars in WWE such as Triple H & Undertaker. The 4 times he broked his neck and other injuries he suffered in WWE. Also, Kurt touches on the last meeting with Vince before his release from WWE.

Genesis 2006
Match of the Decade
Vs. Samoa Joe
TNA advertised this match as being their most hyped match of all time. Even though the match didn't live up to all of the expectations, it was very good. The 20 minutes Joe and Angle was out there, they put on a hell of a show for everybody. Some great moves and submissions too. Some very close near falls & counters. Great match and the fans are very into this one as well. 4.5/5
[Also available on Best of the Bloodiest Brawls: Scars & Stitches]

Turning Point 2006
Vs. Samoa Joe
I have to admit, this was definitely one of the best rematches I have seen. A tad better of a match then from Genesis. A good brawl. A nice sequence of finisher reversals too. A great second encounter from these two. 4.75/5

Final Resolution 2007
30 Minute Ironman Match
Vs. Samoa Joe
Joe & Angle puts on another great match up. Some great moves, good submissions, just some good everything. The falls came at good times too. This was a great match, best match between Joe and Angle during this time. 5/5

Slammiversary 2007
King of the Mountian Match
Vs. Christian Cage vs. AJ Styles vs. Samoa Joe vs. Chris Harris
Now the rules of this match are a little confusing if you read them but they do work out during the match. You must score a pin fall in order to qualify to climb the ladder to hang up the title belt and the loser of the fall must spend 2 minutes inside a penalty box.

The match was very good. Also some very good moves were excuted with the ladder. Angle manages to get use of his ankle lock on top of the ladder. Styles gets thrown through the announce table and the impact was just sick, it really looked like Styles broke his back. Awesome match. 5/5
[Also available on Best of 2007 and Ultimate Matches]

Disc 2
Disc 2 opens up with Kurt coming to TNA and the deal he signed with Jeff Jarrett and Dixie Carter. The impact Kurt made on the business soon as he signed with TNA. Kurt meeting Sting for the first time. A lot of the members on the TNA roster talks morely on this disc then Kurt himself. Most tells how Kurt's pressence added more to the roster and what he brought to it. Kurt begins talking and goes on point about his future in wanting to fight for the UFC and begin MMA wrestling. Discussing about training for MMA and maybe becoming a MMA fighter. Also Kurt's plans after his TNA contract is up.

Hard Justice 2007
All Titles on the Line
Vs. Samoa Joe
Another pretty good match between these two but I do think the Kurt & Karen thing took away a great deal from the match. It did seem to drag on in the beginning but picked up as the match went on. Some good submissions and more of a ground based wrestling match mixed in with some good high impact moves as well. But the ending took away , least I thought it did. Check out Joe's pre-match Samoan dance. 4.5/5
[Also available on Best of 2007]

No Surrender 2007
X-Division Championship
Vs. ""Black Machismo"" Jay Lethal
Kurt called this match his favorite in TNA. A pretty good match. Some say this was the best match on the No Surrender '07 card. Many of close pin fall combinations. A pretty good match overall. 4.5/5

Bound for Glory 2007
TNA Heavyweight Championship
Vs. Sting
This match being in Atlanta, Sting got a huge crowd reaction when he entered the ring. A great match all the way. There were counters, outside ring action, close pin falls, submissions, interference, blood, and everything else. A classic match. 5/5
[Also available on Best of 2007]

Impact October 2007
TNA Heavyweight Championship
Vs. Sting
I forgot all about this match but happy it was on here. Little bit of the same match from BFG but not nearly as good though. It started slow but got better. The interference from Kevin Nash led to Angle being a 2 time champion. 4.5/5

Global Impact January 2008
IWGP Heavyweight Championship
Vs. Yuji Nagata
This was during the New Japan vs. TNA tour. Kurt wrestled in my view one of his best matches. Nagata sure gave Angle a run for his money here. A lot of submissions from both men. Some good counters. One of the best matches I've seen from Kurt Angle. A solid match. 5/5

Lockdown 2008
TNA Heavyweight Championship
Vs. Samoa Joe
This was Angle's title vs. Joe's career. A lot of people will probably not like this match as much as Joe's and Angle's previous matches. But its all about your preference in wrestling. I think Angle was more focusing on his MMA style and keeping this match on the mat. A good match but it is different from their other bouts. 4.5/5

Overall, this is one of the best profile sets TNA has came out with. Even though some of these matches are on other sets, this is a good documentary on Kurt Angle and his short career in TNA. This purchase will be very worth it. Everything in this set is pretty much on key. I highly recommend this. A great Christmas purchase for any wrestling fanatic.",1227830400,8,7146,4.542346542346542
3555984,5,B001ELXT0C,"Ric Flair, Hulk Hogan, Andre the Giant, Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels, Triple H, The Rock, Steve Austin, Undertaker.  All these men are among the elite in wrestling history.  Well, you can include Kurt Angle in this list.  And by the time his career is over, he might and probably will top everyone on this list.  Of course, that is all a matter of opinion, but you can't deny Angle's talent level.  He can wrestle with the best of them and he can work the mike with the best of them.  From an Olympic Gold Medalist to 12x world heavyweight champion in professional wrestling, Kurt is definitly worth getting a dvd.

So, to the dvd itself.  I've found that TNA dvds prior to this release seemed kind of sloppy and quickly done.  Not this one.  The quality is up there with the WWE's dvds.  The dvd goes in depth on Kurt's personal life all the way to his current success in TNA.  Great coverage of his Olympic run as well.  There are many matches on here with Samoa Joe, but I'm not complaining.  Kurt and Joe have amazing chemistry and probably have the greatest rivalry in pro wrestling this decade.  All the matches on here are five star matches and won't dissapoint.

Even if you don't like Kurt Angle, this is a wrestling purist fans dream.  Kurt can down right work in the ring!  He's amazing.  His life story is one of the most interesting in the business as well.  So if you're a Kurt Angle fan, this is the biggest no brainer of a dvd you could think of.  If you're just a wrestling fan, I still highly recommend this dvd.  Definitly the best dvd that TNA has ever released!  Go buy it and check out TNA every Thursday night on Spike to see the best wrestler in the world today.",1227744000,6,1683,4.340836012861736
3555985,5,B001ELXT0C,"Honestly, I can try my best to do an introduction for Kurt Angle but what's to be said about him that hasn't already been said.  Wrestling first (and so far, only) Olympic Gold Medalist, multiple time World Champion, and has been labeled as one of the best professional wrestlers in wrestling today & maybe even of all time...when he's only been around professionally for around a decade.  Kurt Angle FINALLY gets a chance to tell his story on his life & career on DVD.  The DVD is set up similar to how WWE has been setting up their ""matches only"" DVD's in that they're setup to go segment, match, segment, match, ect.  However, the different segments here instead of being a few short minutes are actually 10-20 mins. long each & are chapters of the documentry.  Throughout the chapters, you'll hear from those invovled with TNA (Mick Foley, Jeff Jarrett, the southern ""M.I.L.F."" Dixie Carter, Don West, Mike Tenay, Christian Cage) along with family & friends of Kurt's (James Farrior of the Steelers, wrestling legend Bruno Sammartino, his college coach, ect.) but incase your wondering, there are no comments from Karen Angle.

The program started with talking about Kurt growing up & how he wanted to be just as good as his brothers along with his past in football & amature wrestling along with how tradegy always seems to happen right before some of the biggest athletic events in his life.  His trial & tribulations in training for the Olympics that even led to Kurt quitting for a while is discussed next with stories being told about how his town got behind him financially along with the infamous story of how he won the Olympic gold medal with a ""broken freakin' neck.""  His life after the olympics (including a comical story about him being a news anchor) & how that led to him meeting his wife Karen is discussed.  How Kurt transitioned from amature to professional wrestling & how he had to prove himself despite winning the olympics & got the lowest possible deal you can get starting out, TNA wrestlers (Cage, Foley, Jarrett) talking about the first time they met Kurt, his early thoughts on Vince McMahon, and how he caught on to ""sports entertainment"" so quickly was heavily discussed.  The deepest part of the presentation is when Kurt talks about the injuries & circumstances that led to his drug addiction that effect his homelife & goes into detail about the meeting with Vince McMahon (that almost led to a physical fight) where he was released along with comments about what he regrets about his actions & statements made towards WWE in the months after being released.  The story behind how ""ironic"" it was that Angle came to TNA & the steps made to keep it a secret were talked about in detail along with the roster's reaction to the announcement.  Various people give their opinions on Kurt & telling stories about him, reflecting on Kurt's time in TNA, Kurt's opinions on MMA along with why he has yet to do it, along with talk about what's in the future for Kurt Angle close out the series of chapters.

The seven matches includes in this set are:
vs. Samoa Joe - The match was a disappointment in most people's eyes because they were expecting the type of dream match Angle had with Shawn Michaels at WrestleMania 21 in which they put on a 30 min. rollercoaster of a wrestling clinic. However, this heavily resembles Angle's WrestleMania 22 match in which it didn't go long (less than 15 mins.) but in that entire time, they went high impact & there wasn't a slow moment which left you wanting more as Joe's undefeated streak came to an end. It didn't live up to the hype but in that case, it was an enjoyable failure.
(Genesis '06)
[Also available on ""Best Of Bloodiest Brawls: Scars & Stitches""]

vs. Samoa Joe - This was the best out of their entire series as it lived up to the expectations that people had for their first encounter. This was a wrestling clinic complete them getting reciepts for what happened the previous month like Joe going face first into steel steps and a series of reversals between the Nikita Clutch & Ankle Lock. Again, my favorite match out of their entire series of matches over 2 years.
(Turning Point '06)

30 Minute Ironman Match vs. Samoa Joe - Eventhough Turning Point was my favorite match, this one comes in a real a close second place & was another wrestling clinic that Angle & Joe have made their reputations on.  This match had a great amount of everything you want in a ""wrestling"" match from high impact moves, submissions, storytelling & selling to the point where the first fall doesn't happen until half way into the match, and moments such as Joe's dive outside onto Angle that had him hit his own head on the rail.  Very intense match...down to the very last second.
(Final Resolution '07)

King of the Mountain Match for the vacant TNA Championship vs. Samoa Joe vs. Chris Harris vs. A.J. Styles vs. Christian Cage - For those new to TNA, the King Of The Mountain match is a ladder match in reverse with alot of stipulations. To win the match, you have to use the ladder hang the belt instead of using the ladder to pull it down like a normal ladder match. However before you can hang the belt, you have to qualify to do it by scoring a pinfall/submission over one of the other competitors...and the person who loses that fall goes into a penality box for 2 mins. Yeah, sounds real gimmicky but when you watch it come together...it's a real easy match to follow. Just like all of their multiman matches, this was just a wild brawl all over the place between all 5 men. The props at ringside come into play various times like Christian getting ""crotched"" between one of the steps of the ladder, A.J. Styles being tossed over the top rope onto Christian...who was laying down on the ladder at the time, and Styles being thrown off the top of the penality box through the announcers table (Mick Foley would be proud). In the end, Kurt Angle becomes the first TNA Champion.
(Slammiversary 2007)
[Also available on ""Best Of 2007"" & ""Ultimate Matches""]

Winner Takes All: TNA & ""IWGP"" Championships vs. X Division & Tag Team Champion Samoa Joe - The story thoughout the whole match was Karen Angle & her new man (who was Trademarc, John Cena's cousin & the other guy off the ""You Can't See Me"" album) being a distraction for Angle thoughout the match...even during the entrance where he dropped one of his titles & looked like a defeated man. Joe & Angle delievered a solid wrestling match with this time having some comedic spots like Joe pulling down Angle's trunks. However, this was one of the weakest encounters they've had as there was more of a focus on Karen at ringside than the match itself that resulted in an ending that resulted in Karen Angle becoming a full time character in TNA.
(Hard Justice '07)
[Also available on ""Best Of 2007""]

X Division Championship Match vs. Jay Lethal - Kurt called this match ""his favorite"" as this was TNA's version of the ""Little Engine That Could"" since Lethal was heavily put over as the major underdog who didn't have a chance in hell with even Lethal looking shocked at some of the moves he got in on Angle like the Lethal Combination. However, both men put on the type of performance that makes a star overnight as you saw the audience get into the match more as time went on while Angle helped Lethal not only look like a million bucks...but losing CLEANLY after a roll up. The biggest upset in TNA history...DIG IT! (sorry, couldn't help myself)
(No Surrender '07)

vs. Sting - Before the match, the reception Sting got in the town that made him famous (Atlanta...home of WCW/NWA) was one of the biggest pops I've heard in recent memory. The match started off slow but went into a good match between these two with Kurt pulling off an sick looking & impressive 450 off the top rope into a kneedrop at one point. Both Karen Angle & Kevin Nash (but you knew that was coming based off the skits all night) got involved in the end but it didn't take away the match between these two as Sting won & once again walked away from Bound For Glory as a champion.
(Bound For Glory '07)
[Also available on ""Best Of 2007""]

vs. TNA Champion Sting - Match was very similar but a stepdown from their BFG match in that it started off slow but built up over time with the two going back & forth.  Unfortunally, Kevin Nash got involved again leading to Kurt Angle once again regaining the championship.
(""Impact"" Oct. '08)

""IWGP"" Championship vs. Yuji Nagata - Normally, the japanese style would be a completely different style than the american style but Kurt showcased that he was a natural at adapting to the ""stong"" japanese style (similar to a MMA/wrestling mix) as both men were very intense & heavily working over various bodyparts such as Kurt on Nagata's leg & Yuji on Kurt's arm to the point where an applied armbar Yuji did with the look on his face...you would think he was trying to yank it out of his socket.  One of Kurt's most unique & best performances in not just TNA but his career.
(""Global Impact: Japan"" Jan. '08)

TNA Championship/Six Sides Of Steel Match vs. Samoa Joe - This was Kurt's title vs. Joe's career & was one of those matches that your either going to love or hate.  Their first 3 matches were a great wrestling trilogy while the fourth one was more about establishing the Karen Angle character than adding another memorable to their series but this encounter was about trying something completely different.  They tried working a MMA match with both men heavily protecting themselves & working a ""ground & pound"" submission style similar to what you would see in cage fighting MMA federations like UFC.  Again, it's something your either going to love or hate as Samoa Joe finally won the TNA Championship.
(Lockdown '08)

In the end, this was quite the presentation on the personal life of Kurt Angle himself.  I honestly thought that the lack of WWE footage on his career would hurt this but it doesn't & honestly, it didn't need it for the direction they were going.  Also the influx of the non-TNA talent such as Bruno Sammartino speaking on Kurt Angle was an added bonus as well.  Eventhough I would have prefered more variety in the match selection (cage match vs. Christian Cage, triple threat vs. Rhino & Cage that took up the whole hour of Impact, the Impact rematch vs. Samoa Joe over the Lockdown or Hard Justice matches, his Slammiversary match vs. A.J. Styles) as some matches have been released onto more than 1 previous TNA DVD (which is my biggest pet peeve with TNA Home Video)...each match on here represented an important career or personal moment in TNA such as his debut trilogy against Joe, becoming the first TNA Champion & his other title victory, the match that made him the second triple crown champion in TNA history but the first to hold all the titles at once, his main event match at what's been recieved as TNA's best show ever, personal favorites like the Jay Lethal match, and ones that are relevant to subjects talked about on the DVD like the Lockdown match with Kurt's MMA asperations.  In the end, this was the best TNA profile DVD they've released even down to the production which looks like they went ""outside the box"" to do because it looks like a professional presentation instead of a ""shoot interview"" & I recommend with no questions asked here.  It's true, it's damn true!

SIDE NOTE: Since Kurt Angle never had a DVD presentation in WWE, for those looking for most of Kurt Angle's greatest WWE matches...check out my Listamania to find close to 40 DVD's where you can find them.",1227657600,6,11573,4.609139523578026
3555986,3,B001ELXT0C,"This set looks OK not great.  6 matches out of 10 feature Samoa Joe which I think is overkill. 8 of the 10 matches feature Joe and Sting.  In fact, other than the KOTM Match this DVD only features Angle v. 4 opponents, Joe, Sting, Lethal & Nagata.  Did Angle wrestle anyone else in the last two years???  According to the match selection, he didn't.  I hope the Bio makes up for the lack of diversity in the match selection.  Below is the description and Matches.

3555987,5,B001ELXT0C,"Finally a Kurt Angle DVD set released by TNA that we all can be proud of. I especially liked the way they set up this compilation. Instead of watching the Kurt Angle story as well as the matches separately like the WWE DVD sets are done. You get to see a match in between a story as well as the rivalry leading up to the match. You get to hear stories from Kurt's family members, as well as coaches and his manager.

Kurt Angle was the most underrated superstar that the WWE has ever lost. For the past 2 years TNA has been evolving around Kurt Angle and taking the company to new heights. Kurt Angle has so much to give, the WWE failed to recognize his talents or should I say they wanted to continue to evolve around the flashy guys. Unlike any other superstar when Kurt Angle wins a world title it has meaning to it. Kind of like when he won his gold medal where there were no politics involved. Nobody trains harder to prepare for a main event that the fans want to see more than Kurt Angle. The reason I say this is because he is slimmer now allowing him to use more speed in his matches.

This set will feature his story from childhood, to becoming an olympic gold medalist and making it to pro wrestling. It will also feature matches with Sting, Samoa Joe, Christian Cage, A.J. Styles, etc. I read that other review about there being alot of Samoa Joe in this set. I would rather see Samoa Joe's matches then that Samoan Bulldozer Umaga's matches. Either way back to my review. Before Kurt Angle made it to TNA, I knew he would be one of the best and now after watching his recent matches, he is well on his way to becoming the GREATEST PRO WRESTLER OF ALL TIME. Not Hogan, not Austin, not Triple H, not Shawn Michaels. When I say GREATEST PRO WRESTLER OF ALL TIME, I'm talking about wrestling in general, not flashyness/high ratings, not politic opportunities, or even an individual wrestling for the same company for way too long. It's Real!!! It's Damn Real!!!

P.S. So go out and buy this set and maybe some day the WWE will release the other set which would have matches with Chris Benoit, Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, Triple H, Shawn Michaels, just to name a few. It's True!!! It's Damn True!!!",1225324800,5,2213,4.353510895883777

3555990,3,B001ELXT0C,"i understand that TNA doesn't have the budget that WWE has, and for the most part they also want to be different. Kurt Angle is one of the best Professional Wrestlers out there and I wanted to study his style. The chapter markers on the DVD are placed at very random points, there's no way to go straight to a match. Sometimes you have to sit through a few minutes of interview before getting to the actual match.
My second biggest complaint is that it seemed to be more of a Kurt Angle vs. Samoa Joe DVD. There's 3 or 4 of that match. Now don't get me wrong, they're great matches, but they're all basically the same match which viewed several months apart is amazing, but viewed one right after the other makes it all a bit obvious. I'm sure Kurt had many other opponents, and many other great matches throughout the span of his TNA career, but we just got a bunch of Kurt vs. Joe.",1362700800,,883,4.261904761904762

3555992,5,B001ELXT0C,"I like this dvd a lot. More interviews and kurt talking about his career was way better than some cheap dude with a deep voice doing the talking like in WWE. I like how it was very detailed about every thing. Everything except on how he broke his neck. He talks about the pain and what he did to kind of ease the pain, but not how he broke it. That to me was a bummer but still an awesome dvd",1332892800,,392,3.8518518518518516
3555993,4,B001ELXT0C,"TNA: Kurt Angle: Champion DVD was my first TNA DVD I have ever bought. I understand that it is hard to make a DVD about his TNA career because he wasn't even there that long when the DVD was produced. I was a fan of Angle vs. Joe but time the 3rd match, I thought the story line was sorta boring. My favoritre match was on the bonus DVD, and it was Angle defending the IWGP championship in Japan. Overall, this DVD was good. (4/5)",1312329600,3,430,4.070588235294117
3555994,5,B001ELXT0C,"First, let me say that this DVD covers Kurt Angle's time before pro wrestling and in TNA though WWE is mentioned during the interview parts! Even certain stars such as Undertaker and HHH are mentioned briefly. As a fan, I wish there wasn't any political boundaries because to do this DVD right, you would need both WWE's and TNA's cooperation in terms of match selection. I should also mention that Kurt and his now ex-wife Karen were getting a divorce at the time of this release though she is both shown and mentioned in it.

That being said, this 2-disc DVD set is still excellent and gives you a good biography of Kurt in between the matches. We hear from his brothers, his mom, coaches, his manager and even wrestling legend Bruno Sammartino and (of course) Kurt himself!

Now, let's get to the matches:

Vs. Samoa Joe - This was from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TNA-Wrestling-Genesis-2006/dp/B000MCIC3S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TNA Wrestling: Genesis 2006</a>&nbsp;and it was their first ever meeting. The hype for this bout was incredible and to give you an idea of the scope of this, Samoa Joe (prior to this bout) had gone undefeated in one on one competition from May 2005 until this bout....WHICH WAS IN NOVEMBER 2006! This undefeated streak has been compared to Goldberg's in WCW but I think Joe's was more impressive considering he took on the top competition just about the entire run of this streak rather than pad it up with lesser competition and then take on the top talent like they did with Goldberg BUT I digress.

Joe was incredible and nearly unstoppable so for TNA (who used some thought for once) to get Angle to take him on and beat him was a smart move and the right move! Smart because 1. he is (Angle) one of the best out there and 2. he's one of the few that could believably defeat Joe besides past names like Bret Hart, Harley Race, Vader (WCW era) or Chris Benoit.

The match itself could've been longer BUT it was still awesome for what it was. Kurt gets ""colored"" (term for bleed) during this and that actually made the intensity go up a few notches! Ends with Angle not only defeating Joe but making him tap out to his patened anklelock for one of the rare submission loses for Joe! Great outing for both guys and both looked strong in this!

Vs. Samoa Joe - This rematch takes place at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TNA-Wrestling-Turning-Point-2006/dp/B000UCD4LU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TNA Wrestling: Turning Point 2006</a>&nbsp;and, in my opinion, this one was even BETTER than the Genesis match! This time, it is Joe who gets the submission victory as he used his Kokina Clutch submission to get Angle to tap out for a rare submission win on Kurt! Again, it was done in a way that didn't diminish either guy so well done!

Vs. Samoa Joe (30 Minute Ironman Match) - This rubber match takes place at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TNA-Wrestling-Final-Resolution-2007/dp/B000NKI3TW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TNA Wrestling: Final Resolution 2007</a>! Great match up as you got to see various near-fals, pin attempts and submissions! Ends with a cliffhanger as Angle avoids tapping out to his own anklelock (executed by Joe) to get the victory (I think it was 3-2)!

Vs. Christian Cage Vs. A.J. Styles Vs. Samoa Joe Vs. Chris Harris (King Of The Mountain Match for the TNA Heavyweight Championship) - This happens at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TNA-Wrestling-Slammiversary-2007/dp/B000SLYE4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TNA Wrestling: Slammiversary 2007</a>! For those that aren't familiar with this (admittedly this was the first time I had ever seen a King Of The Mountain match myself), this is basically a ladder match but with a few rules!

First, the object is to get the TNA Championship belt, climb a ladder and hang it up on a hook above the ring.

Second, in order to be eligible to hang the title, you must pin or submit one of your opponents! That man that lost the fall must go into a ""penalty box"" for 2 minutes! The wrestler that gained the pin or submission is now eligible to hang the belt BUT he can be stopped by one of the remaining wrestlers (whether they are eligible to hang the belt or not).

Third, THERE ARE NO RULES BEYOND THOSE TWO!

This match was crazy to say the least with a sick spot of A.J. going through a table where I really thought he broke his back! Ends with Angle winning his first TNA title and becoming the first recognized TNA champion in the post NWA era!

Vs. Samoa Joe (All the TNA titles on the line) - This was from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Total-Nonstop-Action-Wrestling-Presents-Hard-Justice-2007/dp/B000V5A4ZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Total Nonstop Action Wrestling Presents: Hard Justice 2007</a>&nbsp;and this saw ALL the TNA titles (except for the Knockouts title) on the line! I do think the Kurt-Karen storyline hurt this match a bit but it was one of the more comical matches in spots (particularly Joe messing with his Kurt's mind by picking with his tights, even exposing Angle's ""moon"" to the crowd at one point). Ends with Angle gaining the win over Joe and winning ALL of TNA's belts!

On a sidenote, check out the beginning with Samoa Joe joining his ""brothers"" in a ceremonial Samoan dance! A sight to see (and I mean that in a good way)!

Vs. ""Black Machismo"" Jay Lethal (X-Division Championship) - This was from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TNA-Wrestling-No-Surrender-2007/dp/B0012QH0LS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TNA Wrestling: No Surrender 2007</a>&nbsp;and many say this was the best match from that card! Angle is one those few heavyweights that can do X-Division and still be credible! Kurt calls this one of his favorite bouts and actually liked getting Lethal over! I must say, Kurt did just that as he did make Lethal look like a million bucks! Jay kept up with Angle pretty good as well as Lethal scores a surprising upset over Angle!

Vs. Sting (TNA Heavyweight Title Match) - This one was from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TNA-Wrestling-Presents-Bound-for-Glory-2007/dp/B000XUF6P6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TNA Wrestling Presents - Bound for Glory 2007</a>&nbsp;and it was a classic with both men having roots in Atlanta, GA and having the crowd about 70%-30% for Sting though Angle got his share of cheers as well.

This is what a title grudge match should be done. I am not very complimentary to TNA often but this one was done right! Sting, the face, was looking for both the TNA title and revenge for an attack on his son by Angle! Angle, the heel, was looking to keep his title and prove he's the best and was willing to go to any lengths to do it!

Even the interference of Kevin Nash didn't take away from this as Sting scores the win and takes the TNA title!

Vs. Sting - This was a rematch from Impact just a few nights later. A little slower paced at the beginning but picks up as the match goes on! This time, the interference from Nash pays off as Angle regains the title.

Vs. Yugi Nagata (IWGP Third Belt Match) - This was from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tna-Global-Impact-Japan/dp/B001LELHP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tna: Global Impact Japan</a>&nbsp;and this is one of the best matches of Kurt's career....PERIOD! Moves and countermoves galore as both men were looking to make the other tap out! In the end, it was Kurt Angle who got the submission victory!

Vs. Samoa Joe - This was from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TNA-Lockdown-2008/dp/B0015RCUQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TNA: Lockdown 2008</a>&nbsp;and was played a bit different than their previous bouts as it had a more MMA feel to it with Kurt's TNA Title Vs. Joe's career! This was also around the time that Kurt and Karen Angle's (who is now married to TNA founder Jeff Jarrett) relationship (both on and off camera) was beginning to end as Kurt had her banned from ringside before the match started (including calling her the ""b-word"")!

As for the match, it has a more MMA feel to it but slowly turns into a pro wrestling match as it nears its climax! Joe wins and saves his career and gains the TNA championship!

Overall, this 2 Disc DVD is excellent! The only way this one could've been better would've required TNA and WWE to have some cooperation and share matches! In a perfect world, that would happen but as this one stands, it is still pretty damn good! High recommendation!",1310601600,,8705,5.356515373352855

If you don't like Joe, then, well, you will be doing a lot of fast forwarding. There are only about six or seven other matches. They are all very good, though, all on pay-per-view but two of them, and Angle always brings his A-game on PPV.

Don't get me wrong, the first three matches between those two are great matches, but I wish they would have had mixed up the different talent Kurt faced.  I think they put five Kurt Angle vs. Samoa Joe matches, the last one being at Lock Down 2008.  Now I know Angle faced AJ Styles somewhere in between the years, so I was shocked to see there was no Styles and Angle match.

8298777,3,B001ELXT0C,"This would probably rate highly to TNA fans, but as someone who never really followed that promotion I didn't know what to expect with this DVD set. This set is a nice compilation of Angle's TNA matches, along with a comprehensive documentary with interviews involving his family.

One of my problems with the footage is I enjoy watching Angle perform due to his combination of old-school realistic skills, and the comedic element he can bring. In TNA, Angle's character was essentially a committed, serious athlete. I wasn't expecting this, but his performances in-ring were still top quality. Another negative is the overall production of TNA. Their camerawork, the commentators, the dialogue,all feel like an amateurish take on pro wrestling. Even ECW, as sad as this sounds, had better television production.

I see this as an OK companion-piece to Angle's WWE set. I'm unlikely to ever rewatch these matches, because if I need a bit of an Angle fix I'll just go to the WWE release.",1523750400,,986,4.96969696969697

CHAMPION

I have been a huge Angle fan ever since I first saw him in the WWF. So it was a bit of a surprise when he left them and went to TNA. Of course I was also really excited because I thought TNA was the better show at the time. Like most I loved the X Division and the six sided ring and everything that was different from the WWE, don't get me wrong I still loved WWE. When Angle debuted in TNA and it was apparent that he was going up against Samoa Joe I could have not been more excited.

I was equally excited when this DVD was released because I knew it was going to not only have the matches but was also a documentary. I was very excited to hear what happened with the WWE split and all of that. But the entire documentary was wonderful and one of my favorites to watch. Of course the matches added were great as well.

1. VS SAMOA JOE-this match happened at Genesis 2006 and was Angles first match in TNA. It was also against the undefeated Samoa Joe who had been smashing people. This was a back and forth match that would see both men do everything they could to get that win. Both men looked great in this match and had the crowd chanting this is awesome. Angle ends the year and a half streak that Joe had built.

2. VS SAMOA JOE-the rematch took place at Turning Point that same year and was another classic. This was a battle between the two with some clever reversals. These two are magic together and this match is proof of that. It is Joe this time that takes the win evening the score cards out. This was an excellent match.

3.[IRONMAN MATCH]VS SAMOA JOE-this was the rubber match at Final Resolution. Like the first two matches this one was a battle. This time though there was a time limit in which you had to get as many falls as possible to win. So just before the half way mark Joe gets the first win by submission after a great back and forth. Angle evens the score a little past the half way point though with a submission of his own. They continue the war going at each other hard until Angle takes the lead with another ankle lock right before they reach ten minutes left. Joe evens it out with the first pin fall of the match, but Angle gets a pin of his own around the five minute mark. From there they just beat on each other right to the end with Joe almost evening it up but Angle is saved by the bell.

4.[KING OF THE MOUNTAIN]VS SAMOA JOE VS CHRISTIAN CAGE VS AJ STYLES VS CHRIS HARRIS-this was a stable at the time for Slammiversary, the King of the Mountain match which was actually brought back recently. In this match you basically do the opposite of a normal ladder match. In this one you have to climb it and hang the belt up, of course you have to get a win during the match to be able to do that. There is also the fact that if you do get pinned or submitted you have to spend time in a cage, sounds crazy but it is actually really fun. I love all of these guys so I knew this was going to an excellent match, and it was. Everybody shines here as it has spot after spot and many great moments. The action is all over the place of course in and out of the ring. Going off of the cage, multiple ladder moments and all kinds of spots happen here in this match. Angle of course ends up winning this and the title, great match.

5.[TNA, X, TAG, & IWGP TITLES]VS SAMOA JOE-this match was for all of the gold in TNA and even the IWGP title. Angle had the TNA and IWGP belts while Joe had the X and Tag titles [which he won while teaming with Kurt. Also in the storyline here Kurts wife at the time Karen was leaving Kurt and was at ringside with her new man during the match. This match took place at Hard Justice in 2007 and like their previous encounters was a great match.

6.[X DIVISION TITLE]VS JAY LETHAL-this match at No Surrender 2007 would go on to become one of if not the biggest upset in TNA history. Jay Lethal was a huge underdog here and he went toe to toe with the Olympic Gold Medalist. This is a great match in which the arrogant Angle starts out dominating the match. Still as the match goes on Lethal starts to mount a great comeback. He eventually scores the clean win on Angle after a roll up, it was a wonderful and very exciting match.

7.[TNA TITLE]VS STING-just as Shawn Michaels is Mr. Wrestlemania Sting was TNAs Mr. Bound for Glory as this was his event and 2007 was more of the same winning ways for the man. This match for Angles world title was another fun and classic battle between the two. Both men looked great here, Angle in particular. A friend of both men, Kevin Nash, got involved her turning against Sting to help Angle. Still it made no difference as Sting went on to capture the title once again at his event.

8.[TNA TITLE]VS STING-this was the rematch from the previous bout and like the last one was a really fun one. This was on free TV on Impact which was on Spike at the time. Great back and forth action between the two with Nash getting involved once again except this time it works in Angles favor. He regains the title and then makes an enemy of former buddy Nash. Another great battle between these two.

9.[IWGP TITLE]VS YUJI NAGATA-the main event of Global Impact in 2008 would see a classic put on by these two men over in Japan. Great match in which both men showcase their wonderful talents going at it hard. The Japanese fans were really into this and rightfully so as the story told here was great. Hard fought battle between two legends with Angle coming out on top.

10.[TNA TITLE CAGE MATCH]VS SAMOA JOE-this match was at Lockdown and was a Six Sides of Steel match and other classic between these two rivals. MMA fighters and legends in my mind Frank Trigg and Marcus Davis were a part of this match, Trigg as a commentator and Davis presenting the winner with the belt. This match was a title versus career match with Joes career on the line. This was a hard hitting war in which Joe takes home the title and saves his career in TNA.

8298785,5,B001ELXT0C,"I found this to be one of the greatest TNA DVD releases ever. The Documentary is excellent. The matches are great and all the major matches in Angle's career are mostly all covered. The documentary covers a lot of ground from Angle growing up to his current TNA career. The topics of interviews include winning the Gold Medal in the Olympics, his falling out with WWE and how he left on bad terms with Vince McMahon. We learn about Kurt being overworked when injured in WWE and how that had a negative effect on his home life. Kurt talks about how it was hard for him being away from his family due to the brutal WWE schedule. Mick Foley on the dvd says he thinks Angle was taking advantage of him because Kurt would do anything to help the company. There are interviews from a lot of TNA wrestlers and Dixie Carter. Say what you want about Dixie Carter she deserves a lot of credit for bringing Angle into TNA. Jeff Jarrett says Kurt Angle was the one guy he wanted from the WWE roster and Angle certainly could be the greatest wrestler of all time. We hear from Samoa Joe who even though he is a rival of Angle clearly has a lot of respect for Angle and acknowledges Kurt's impact on TNA. I am sure Joe might have felt his legs cut from under him as when he was heating up in TNA Angle stepped in and got a lot of attention. Both of them had some of the greatest matches in TNA History and it helped both their careers to be in the same company. Christian Cage talks about he was thrilled to work with Angle. Angle helped him prove what WWE missed out on years before as they had great matches together. The matches on the set are all great. There were five matches of Kurt vs Joe which seemed excessive. I would have added another disc if Jarrett can get 4 I am sure Angle can get 3. I would have included some matches like Kurt vs Cage, Kurt vs Abyss, Kurt vs Rhino. Two other great matches on the set are Kurt vs Sting at Bound For Glory and the rematch. The Bound For Glory match is Sting's best match in TNA. We of course see the King of the Mountain Match where Angle wins the title. Another match on the set that is awesome is Kurt vs Jay Lethal. It was a great match and biggest upset in TNA. I see that as one of TNA's greatest moments. Another match on the set that could be the best on the set is Yuji Nagata vs Kurt. Kurt comes off as a real humble guy too. He talked about fearing he wouldn't get a good reception from the fans because he thought they wanted Goldberg instead. Kurt comes off as a person who loves what he does for a living and has a burning intense passion for it becomes a problem when he needs to step away from it. Kurt comes off as a nice guy and a good friend. I am happy for him that he went to TNA and made a difference. There were some great years in TNA that he played a big part in and even though now it looks like his TNA career is coming to a close it's great to relive Angle's early and best years in TNA.  Overall this was as good as it got for a wrestling dvd release. You got a lot of great matches and an excellent documentary. Enjoy and Cheers!",1395273600,,3095,4.098846787479407
