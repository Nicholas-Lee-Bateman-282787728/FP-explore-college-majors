8424605,4,B004CZZZ8G,The first Black movie from the 70's blaxplotation era where they don't have white characters saying the N-word over and over. This is actually a good film with a decent plot and story. Billy is believable as a character. He's not called N-word over and over again. Good movie.,1526515200,,276,4.653061224489796
