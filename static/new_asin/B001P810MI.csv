8332479,5,B001P810MI,"'An excellent video history of the Erie Canal, from the initial proposals for a canal to the present day operation of the canal.  Includes fascinating glimpses of a number of sidelights: the preference for mules over horses for towing early canal boats, economic considerations, wartime effects, and the nature of canal boats.  Chapter breaks make it perfect for classroom use -- each chapter is a coherent capsule lesson, presenting one aspect of the canal and its history.  Highly recommended!
