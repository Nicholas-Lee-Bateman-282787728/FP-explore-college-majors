8029810,3,B0002O9VOA,"The ""palomino"" is actually the flax-tressed Lindsay Frost as a recently divorced photojournalist who sets her sights on a hunky horseman played by Lee Horsley. More flannel-tearing than bodice-ripping, the bosoms still heave as shutterbug and cowboy begin a hot-n-heavy affair among the Quarterhorses and haybales. Tragedy strikes and the suds lather, but Palomino is a well-done weepie for romantics who also like horses. There's a nice subplot involving therapeutic riding for disabled children. Based on a novel by Danielle Steele.
