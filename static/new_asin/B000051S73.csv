7929427,5,B000051S73,"This video has ALL the great snapshots of gymnastics history, from nadia's golden moments, to the mag-7 team in Atlanta. The video is about 90 minutes long, and shows the historic rutines in full, and even the older footage is very clear on this tape. The video includes names like: nadia, bart conner, mary lou retton, kerri strug, as well as russian/soviet greats...including the rutine with the first triple back somersault on floor-X. A great video all-around...you'll watch many times over!",1047168000,6,495,5.1234567901234565
7929428,5,B000051S73,This video is absolutely wonderful!  It gives some of the greatest moments of gymnastics.  The video gives good viewing time of both the women's and men's events.  It will inspire all young gymnasts to excel at the sport. I highly recommend it for the gymnastics enthusiast or to the young aspiring gymnast who wants to see what hard practice will truly accomplish.,1046304000,2,365,4.854838709677419
7929429,5,B000051S73,"I think that the other two reveiwers that have given their view of this video have been far too harsh! This is an excellent video which is well worth adding to any gymnastics fan's collection. It contains some rare footage of artistic gymnastics routines from 1970-1996. All routines are fully shown, with commentary and sound, and a great variety of gymnasts are shown; from Mitch Gaylord to Dominique Moceanu. It is a shame that this title is out of print but I would recommend you to purchase it from one of Amazon's Marketplace Sellers as this video is well worth it!",1032220800,3,571,4.663366336633663
