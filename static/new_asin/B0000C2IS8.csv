7998159,3,B0000C2IS8,This is a lovely series that I'm glad I was able to find. The rating is because the description says 'with series box' but I only received the DVD in its case. It is sealed and new so that's the important part but is just a little disappointing to not get the series box when it shows it in the product picture and is in the description.,1418083200,,337,4.044776119402985
7998160,5,B0000C2IS8,"This is the story of Misaki, she's moved to Tokyo to attend middle school and live with her aunt. On her first day there she sees an ""Angelic Layer"" battle on TV and falls in love with it. In Angelic Layer people compete using dolls they remotely control with their mind to fight. It's a very popular game that has a huge fan base and lots of skilled competitors. Misaki gets an Angel and starts to play Angelic Layer. Through the game she meets lots of new friends and even unlocks secrets about her past, like the true identity of her mother and father.

This anime is mainly a fun & games type show. It has a lot of good lessons to teach about love and friendship with a descent amount of drama, but it's not upsetting drama; it's more fulfilling. I have loved every CLAMP anime I've ever seen and this is no exception. It's not as emotionally heavy as X or Tsubasa, but it's a nice change of pace. It think this is also one you can sit down and watch with the whole family. Young and old can find something charming about this little gem.",1356739200,,1042,4.262626262626263
7998161,4,B0000C2IS8,This anime is for young teenagers. The character development starts off slow but you'll catch up. This show has people playing with animated dolls its part of the game watch it and see.,1138147200,,185,4.636363636363637
7998162,5,B0000C2IS8,I found this lighter side of anime was very enjoyable to watch . If you like ClAMP you'll enjoy Angelic Layer.,1112140800,,110,4.285714285714286
7998163,5,B0000C2IS8,"It's a fun, touching series, but not for the serios drama addicts. Thick character development; comparable to "".hack//SIGN"" (in tastes, not plotline).",1104796800,,150,5.863636363636363
7998164,5,B0000C2IS8,"This story is about a young lady named Misaki who leaves to go to school in Tokyo and Live with her aunt. She is in the hopes of meeting her mother one day, but never really focuses on it because she figures her mom must be a very busy lady and she must not have time to see her. She gets to Tokyo and is caught up in this new gaming craze called Angelic Layer. She learns to trust her self and have faith in her new partner, Hataru. It was absolutely delightful. I really have enjoyed this series so far. It is kinda cute but not to the point where it would make you want to puke. I definently want to see the rest of this. The fact that they used a battle doll that only works in an arena brings it to some what of a reality, and does not give it that fishy ""pokemon"" after tatste. Buy this one I am sure you'll like it!",1071187200,,822,3.8988095238095237
7998165,5,B0000C2IS8,"Angelic Layer is another series from the famed CLAMP who has given fans a variety of things to love: Magic Knight Rayearth, Card Captor Sakura, X, and Chobits (just to name a few).  I would have to say that CLAMP has done it again with this series spanning 26 episodes.
The story centers around a girl named Misaki who moves to Tokyo to live with her aunt in hopes of also meeting her mother again.  She arrives in Tokyo being captivated by the new fad of ""Angelic Layer,"" a game where people (Deuses) control their customized dolls (Angels) to fight against another using their own power of thought.  With a lot of help, she starts her journey as a Deus fighting against other Deuses and their angels in many competitions, while meeting many friends on the way.  I admit the premise seems a little sketchy but the real factor that made this series and story amazing were the characters.  The characters have so much depth and personality and the relationships with one another is something that just has to be seen.
The series is relatively new so the quality is nothing short of amazing with the use of digital animation.  The music is also done courtesy of Avex through its use of Avex Trax.  This has happened with other series such as Inu Yasha and Hikaru no Go.  The music in this series is nothing short of amazing.  The songs are catchy, touching, and beautiful.  The opening song is performed by the Japanese voice actress of the lead character, Misaki.
I would have to say the downpoint of this release by ADV is the packaging.  To me, it seems too gaudy.  I would have preferred something on the lighter side.  The box however does work with the nice scene of the cast set on top of the grass on a sunny, clear day.  This goes along with the theme of the second ending theme so once the series gets there, you will know what I'm referring to.
Final Note: Some may be skeptical with this series by thinking it is on the same lines as Pokemon.  Not all shows can be classified as just another monster-raising/competition anime.  Let me assure you and stress the fact that this is not the case.  Digimon is different and a favorite of mine because it stresses story and characters.  Angelic Layer is no exception.  Fans know that CLAMP makes really great stories as can be shown from its extensive history of works.  At the least, give this show a try.  You will not be disappointed.",1067731200,,2391,4.5011600928074245
7998166,5,B0000C2IS8,"This was a fun and cut animation. I was hooked on it right away.

  It's about a girl that travels to Tokyo to see her aunt. She sees the Angelic Layer being played on a big screen that you see in the Cites. She is amazed by the way the angels fight and she wants to have one of her own.

  I cant wait until it comes out on DVD in the USA.",1062460800,,340,3.589041095890411
7998167,5,B0000C2IS8,"This is a very good series and I'm glad to see it finally coming to America! About a young girl Miyaki who comes to Tokyo and sees two Angel's fighting and soon gets hooked and gets her own Angel! I would definitly recommend this series to just about everyone. It is for both girls and guys to, the action scenes between Angel's, weather they are cute or brawny and all sorts of different things I think pretty much anyway will enjoy.",1062115200,2,434,4.37037037037037
