2290627,5,B0009HBPEO,"I'm cannot tell how pleased I am about the pending release of a wonderful educational show. The series was shot on the campus of my present school Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia. This was more than just a tv show. It taught life lessons as well as historical ones. This show along with the Cosby show introduced me and others to black history, art, music,literature, life and culture. The blacker the college the sweeter the knowledge.",1117756800,7,440,4.802631578947368
2290628,3,B0009HBPEO,I'm a fan of the show but the second season all the way to the last was better. The whole Dwayne & Whitley saga kind of bought the show out and made it even better.,1115856000,4,164,3.7142857142857144
2290629,3,B0009HBPEO,I only give this season 3 stars only because this wasn't my fav season. I loved A Different World from season 2 till the very last episode. But I will be getting this DVD just because this is one of my all time fav television show.,1114560000,7,231,4.043478260869565

2290636,4,B0009HBPEO,"I was a late bloomer and got into A Different World years later after reruns were being shown in syndication. With that being said, I can honestly say the episodes with Lisa Bonet left a lot to be desired. Thankfully Debbie Allen rearranged the show and got rid of some and added others making this a classic show. Hopefully the other seasons will be released in the near future.",1456531200,,379,4.507246376811594

2290638,3,B0009HBPEO,"Season 1 was decent.  During this newborn era, the show definitely had some growing to do.  It was too Denise-centered.  Denise is failing.  Denise is broke.  Denise's family visits.

I liked Lisa Bonet's Denise.  But, I think characters like Dwayne and Whitley blossomed immensely without her (and with Debbie Allen at the helm).  But, I would have liked to see the dynamic of the show with Bonet for one more year.

Now the rant, why, why, why are the remaining seasons not available?  As the ""The Cosby Show"" luster started to fade in its later years, ""A Different World"" was a youthful, diverse anchor on Thursday nights.  It proved, a young black cast can entertain, educate, and create must-see television for all ages.  The fact that this show's most notable and memorable seasons are not available to the public - while a Kardashian sneezes and it's shoved down viewers' throats - is absolutely shameful.",1451606400,2,912,4.85064935064935

2290641,4,B0009HBPEO,"I love having this sitcom on DVD, however the price was very high and I may not purchase any others.

I just knew that in fairly short order the subsequent seasons would be coming out and I could complete my collection. WRONG!  I cannot believe that TPTB have not yet released Seasons 2 - 6 to the public.  This is nuts and it's insulting to the fans who love this show and adore these characters.  A Different World did not get right until Season 2 when Debbie Allen came in and ""righted"" this ship.  The fans know this!  On twitter and instagram, fans are constantly bombarding the the cast and Debbie with questions about why the DVDs for Seasons 2-6 have not been released and when will they be released.  It is BEYOND ridiculous!  The people behind this show really need to be embarrassed.  STOP IGNORING THE FANS!!!! Release the subsequent seasons!",1414886400,35,872,4.496815286624204

2290667,3,B0009HBPEO,"I really enjoyed this series when it was on the TV. Although the first season was not their best, the show moved on to be very successful, even without Lisa Bonet.

I am disappointed that this set includes the ""syndicated,"" edited versions of the show that we see today on cable. These are not the full episodes that originally aired, which I would expect to get when spending my money on a box set of the show.

What disappoints me even further is that the company that owns the rights to the show don't want to invest in putting the other seasons on DVD. What they don't realize is that seasons 2 forward get better and are the most remembered.

What I hope is that they re-release season one, correctly, as well as the other seasons. If they can put reality shows on DVD, which cater to a smaller group, they can certainly invest in this.",1361318400,10,841,4.378205128205129
2290668,5,B0009HBPEO,"The early episodes on this DVD collection show awkward strain. But when this series hits its stride (particularly on the 2nd DVD), there is nothing quite like it. Lisa Bonet begins to play her part less like the awkward stressed little girl and starts to give off a cool, collected, above-it-all princess vibe who is in full control and that is truly something to see.

The writing also comes together and a world is created that gives so much pleasant comfort, though there is some decline on the latter episodes on disc 3.

If you need to experience a world that can give pleasant comfort in a understated way (the latter first era shows on the 1st DVD, the golden period of the 2nd DVD and the few golden era episodes on the 3rd DVD), you should get this.",1360368000,,758,4.446043165467626

2290670,2,B0009HBPEO,"Lisa Bonet was like watching wallpaper in this show. She had no charisma or charm at all. She was so much better in the Cosby show. She must have hated it when  Jasmine Guy was in front of the camera, she acted rings around Lisa. Heck the actress who played Millie held my interest more than Lisa did.  She should have stayed on the Cosby show. Good thing she got pregnant so the producers didn't have to fire her. There is no way this show would have lasted if she had stayed the star.",1346716800,3,486,4.159574468085107
2290671,2,B0009HBPEO,I got a call from Paul Shrieber of Carsey Werner whose name I got from the review of season two. Mr. Shrieber called and nicely redirected me to Janet Bonnifer at 818-464-9618. She said that there are no plans for the other season to be released any time soon because of licensing issues regarding the songs used in some of the scenes. This is the reason why they have not be able to release it all these years. I have seen shows released with different music and/or songs than the original episodes because of the same reason.  It was worth the try but I am no longer holding my breath for this. I will just have to get it from someone who has recorded them all from tv as I did before. The last set I got was flawed and I was unable to return it from Video MagicBox. I will try some other source.,1344988800,9,798,4.148387096774194
2290672,4,B0009HBPEO,"I bought the first season of A Different World dvd because I am a huge fan of this show! Even though the first season was my least favorite of all, I still enjoyed the dvd and especially the bonus disc.  I absolutely love seeing bloopers of my favorite show and so that was a highlight!  It looks like the cast had such a good time together. Ironically, none of the bloopers were from season 1, which was great b/c the rest of the seasons were so much better, but seeing the bloopers from later episodes made me really miss the show even more and wish that the rest of the seasons were available on dvd!  I also like the behind the scenes documentary on the bonus disc too.  It was cool to see some of the actors get together and reminisce about the show and they also included footage from rehearsals, which was nice to get a glimpse of.  I just want to see more!!!!

But the show went on and became better and better with each episode. When it finally ended, I wanted to have all of the episodes, but I only got a few. Now that the first season came out, I had to have it!! It brought back memories of going to the military, and going to school myself, and I can watch it over and over again!!!!!

2290678,5,B0009HBPEO,"Perhaps this is one of the few shows that ran sucessfully for a considerable length of time after the departure of its star.
 Originally built around Cosby Kid, Lisa Bonet's character, Denise Huxtable, the show stayed afloat for five more seasons after Bonet left, thanks largely to the prestige of its parent show as well as the writing and directing talents of Bill Cosby, Debbie Allen, and some of the show's stars.
 The first season found Denise struggling with college life at the fictional Hillman College in Virginia, forging relationships with fellow students, Jaleesa Vinson (Dawnn Lewis, who helped compose the show's theme song)a divorcee in her mid-twenties,Army brat Maggie Lauten(Marisa Tomei),the upper-crust scene stealer, Whitley Gilbert(Jasmine Guy,whom I recently had the pleasure of watching in a live stage performance),Whitley's silly young lackey, Millie(Marie Alise Recasner), the intially goofy, but ultimately daring and romantic math genius, Dwayne Wayne(Kadeem Hardison), who made flip-top sunglasses a fashion statement, and his lackey, slickster Ron Johnson(Darryl M. Bell), the illustrious Gilbert Hall House Mother, Lettie Bostic(Mary Alice), dorm manager Stevie Rallen(Loretta Devine),Glynn Turman's tough-as-nails math teacher, Col. Bradford Taylor, and cafeteria manager Vernon Gaines, (Lou Myers).
  The episodes ranged from plainly amusing to downright side-splitting, as the characters developed and the dynamics of the show shifted during the six years it was on the air. Old characters were replaced with new as Maggie, Stevie,Millie and Denise left, and we were introduced to Cree Summer's Southwestern hippie chick, Freddie Brooks,  Sinbad's Coach Walter Oakes, and Charnele Brown's aspiring doctor, Kimberly Reese.
  The series was a showcase for African American talent, including appearances by Gary Dourdan as activist, Shazza Zulu, Joe Morton's Senator Byron Douglas,  and  Dominic Hoffman's diplomat-in-training Julian Day, who each play a key role in Whitley's life, Diahann Carroll as Whitley's socialite mother, Marion,Patti LaBelle as Dwayne's mother, Adele, Alisa Guise Dickens, as Dwayne's one-time love interest,  Kinu Owens, who was of partial Japanese descent, Debbie Allen's Doctor Langhorne, Robert Guillaume's  Dean Winston, Roscoe Lee Browne's Dr. Barnabus Foster, Jada Pinkett-Smith's Lena James,Tisha Campbell-Martin as the AIDS victim, Josie Webb,Whoopi Goldberg as an English professor, Ajai Sanders as student Gina Deveraux,Abner Mariri as South African student, Kobie, the Ethiopian Entertainer, Senait as Ron's sister, Blair Underwood as a friend of Dwayne's slated to serve in the Persian Gulf war, and the Reverend Jesse Jackson himself, to name a few. Andrew Lowrey and Anita Morris as Freddie's mother and cousin gave a nod to her mixed-raced background.
  As homage was paid the the range and beauty of those of the African diaspora,many viewers saw the lives of blacks in all their complexities, and not just in the negative stereotypes portrayed in the media. Many who saw this series, as well as ""The Cosby Show"" itself, were inspired to improve their quality of life through higher education, and still many others may have been introduced to various facets of African and African American history that schools have often failed to teach.
 Nearly two decades after its final taping, it's still a magnificent, beautiful, and intelligent comedy to watch. Highly recommendable!",1290556800,2,3451,5.675728155339806
2290679,3,B0009HBPEO,"First off, I would like to say the only reason I purchased A Different World was because I heard Lisa Bonet (Denise) was on the show. So I don't know much about the history of the show. In season three of the Cosby Show, Denise leaves for Hillman College and is gone from season four of the Cosby Show. A Different World originally was centered on Denise's experiences at Hillman College but after season one Lisa Bonet had become pregnant so she was dropped out of the show. A Different World also did what the Cosby Show didn't. They frequently addressed issues about race and equal rights, which Cosby Show writers avoided. Now I've seen a lot of criticism for season one, so I was surprised at how high it was in the ratings. It was number two, just behind the Cosby Show in the Nielsen ratings.

Denise also shares her room with two other girls; Twenty-six year old Jaleesa Vinson Taylor (Dawnn Lewis) and a hyper Maggie Lauten. (Marisa Tomei) Denise also has to live close by to Whitney Gilbert (Jasmine Guy) a spoiled girl in the same dorm. Another college student is Dwayne Wayne, (Kareem Hardison) a very smart math student who also flirts a lot with not much success.

Many people have said the show got better after Denise left, but I think the problem was not in Denise but in the stories for the episodes. I mean, one episode is all about Maggie looking for an egg, she's supposed to care for an egg as if it were a child for a class experiment about parenthood. Also, I would smile at jokes during each episode, but there were no laugh out loud moments. And that's what a sitcom is supposed to do. I enjoyed guest appearences from the Huxtable family but besides that, I guess I'm just not a big fan of the show. (I do think it's a good show though, just not my type)

The DVD packaging was impressive for season one. It's similar to season one of the Cosby Show but the episodes are unedited. There also is a nice pamphlet with a letter from Debbie Allen, and it includes an episode guide. I would have listed the descriptions from the pamphlet below, but they are huge and they spoil certain episodes, so here are my episode descriptions.

Reconcilable Differences - Airdate: 9/24/1987 - Denise takes up residence in Hillman college, and immediately clashes with her roommate Jaleesa Vinson.

Those Who Can't...Tutor - Airdate: 10/22/1987 - Denise is going to flunk in math so Dwayne Wayne decides to help her. Unfortunately they study so long that they stay past dorm curfew. So Dwayne has to find a way to leave the dorm without being caught.

Mr. Hillman - Airdate: 2/25/1988 - Denis is tired of sexual stereotypes on campus, so she enters Dwayne in the Miss Hillman contest.

The bonus disc is good as well. There is an unaired episode entitled ""Homie, Don't Ya Know Me?"" There also is an interesting documentary by E! Entertainment, a blooper reel and a Cosby Show trailer.

Some people were glad Denise left, some weren't, some love season one, some people hate it. I'm right in between that line. It's good but not great, but I think it's still much better than most new sitcoms so I'd suggest buying a copy to see how you like it.",1277683200,3,6625,4.509181969949917
2290680,5,B0009HBPEO,"A Different World Season 1 is a box set of DVD's of the complete 1st season. It made me laugh and I felt a twinge of nostalgia watching it. There were some sad moments, as well as comedic ones. The series is a spin off of The Cosby Show and opens with Denise going to Spellman College, a traditionally black college. The trials and tribulations of the students reflect situations that actually happen during college life. I really hope the other seasons of the show will be released soon.",1276387200,,488,4.49438202247191
2290681,5,B0009HBPEO,"I am obviously in the minority here, which is fine with me, but I like the first season of ""A Different World"" the best. I always have. Yes, the latter seasons were good. Some serious and relevant issues were addressed, including drinking, date rape, racism, and HIV. However, I still think Debbie Allen made a big mistake getting rid of Marisa Tomei (Maggie Lauten). I can imagine all of the storylines which could have been written for her, as a white student at a predominantly African-American college. The upside of it all was Marisa went on to have an Academy-award winning career, with Ms. Allen having been in the audience the night she won for ""My Cousin Vinny"". Now, that revenge was SWEET... Did you notice Freddie was actually a clone of Maggie? She was just black. They even had the same hair color- red.

In regards to Lisa Bonet, I thought she added a charm to the show, and was the perfect fit for Dwayne Wayne. She was a much better fit for him than Whitley. It took some time to get used to that pairing. I loved the rapport and chemistry of Denise, Maggie, and Jaleesa. I adored Dwayne, liked Ron, and enjoyed watching Whitley, a modern-day version of Scarlett O' Hara. I thought Ron and Millie were cute together. In case anyone remembers, ""A Different World"" won the People's Choice Award that year for best new comedy. I still recall Lisa giving the acceptance speech, thanking God, and giving a shoutout to her hubby, Lenny Kravitz.

I was a junior in high school when ""A Different World"" made its debut, and we all loved it from the jump. Every Friday at school, we would talk about what happened the night before. There was a simplicity and overall innocence that year. It was fun to watch.

That is why I am glad season one has been released on DVD, along with the extra features. It is so heartwarming and nostalgic to see these episodes again, one by one. Watching Whitley slap Dwayne at the pit when he wouldn't clear up rumors they had been fooling around in her dorm room, Jaleesa, Denise and Maggie singing and dancing to ""Rockin' Robin"", the initial hostility towards Lettie when she replaced Stevie in the dorm, Dwayne and Denise eventually going on a date, and sharing a kiss at the end... And yes, Denise wearing the pig nose, and Maggie losing her eggby, ""Artie"".

Many people prefer the first season of ""Charlie's Angels"" over the ones which followed. Just like in the case of Farrah Fawcett, there was something very special about Lisa Bonet.

2290688,5,B0009HBPEO,"Sure, this first season of A Different World may be lacking in various areas.  As in, you've got Denise (Lisa Bonet) being depicted as this young woman with all the potential in the world who does almost nothing to further her ccareer.  And, you've got Marissa Tomei fretting over the loss of an eggby and the size of her body buffer zone.  But, this writer still enjoys the memories and the presence of the both of them.

Okay, maybe the series improved after the first season and the departure of Lisa & Marissa.  But, the real helper was the arrival of Debbie Allen.  She probably could've improved the Denise and Maggie characters in the confines of the script, if either of them had decided to stick around.

Anyway, it's still great to witness the way that Dwayne, Whitley, Jalessa, Ron, Millie, Stevie and Lettie's characters all began.  And, the antics they all got into were all very cute and memorable.  [As in Dwayne saying to a pignosed Denise, ""Whattaya say, we get out of here and go dig for truffles?""  Personally, I quite enjoy watching that.  And, Lisa actually looks real cute in that nose.  Then, there's her Porky reference at the end of the episode.]

Also, I got a major kick out of the use of ""Seven More Days"" by Terence Trent D'Arby in the 12th episode, ""Advise and Desent.""  Watching that episode as many times as I did - along with the rest of the set - is what led me to purchasing my own copy of the first record by TTD (or Sananda).

10-24-11: Here's a trivial tidbit.  Partway through the season, a new character appeared named Lettie Bostick.  During the Season 3 finale of The Cosby Show, ""Hillman,"" a new college president was appointed, played by Gloria Foster.  Ms. Foster would later portray The Oracle in the first 2 volumes of the Matrix trilogy.  Following Ms. Foster's passing, the role would be assumed by Mary Alice (who'd played Lettie on this show).",1217203200,3,1894,4.583333333333333

Season 1 was a work in progress. Lisa Bonet was as others have said, an average to mediocore actress. Her performances were soo bland. Scenes that should've been good were just okay. Her co-stars made efforts. Marisa Tomei & Dawnn Lewis did well. But some of the scenes where the 3 of them were all together Bonet made the scene fall flat. It seemed like Bonet just kinda drifted in & out of each episode with no real effort.

Some things I didn't get:
1) Why Maggie had to room with Jalissa & Denise. Whitley didn't have a roommate so that didn't make sense that they made a room with 3 people sharing.
2)What the heck happened to Stevie & how she just up & disappeared like that.
3) What Stevie's son was doing living with her in the dorms anyway. How did he go to school/daycare? That didn't seem like a proper living arrangement.
4) Where Claire was everytime Denise called home.

2290699,3,B0009HBPEO,"Despite being number 2 in the ratings for its debut season, ""A Different World"" had a lot of weak spots.  Lisa Bonet wasn't strong enough of an actress to carry a show on her own, the characters were inconsistent and the storylines were mediocre and not especially funny.  I think the episodes about a rubber pig's nose and babysitting eggs were some of the lowest points of the season.

That said, there are some good things about the first season, namely the introduction of the characters of Jaleesa, Whitley, Dwayne Wayne, Ron and Walter who would develop more in later seasons and it's undeniably fun to see a pre-Oscar Marisa Tomei (who knew?) desperately trying to be anything but the token white girl.  The show only really got going when Debbie Allen (Phylicia Rashad's sister) took over as the producer in the second season and Charnele Brown as Kim and my eternal favorite, the radiant Cree Summer as Freddie, joined the cast; I look forward to these future releases.

Perhaps sensing that the first season alone wouldn't grab buyers, the fourth disc has extras that could have waited until further season releases but are nevertheless very good.  There is a ""I Was a Network Star"" featurette that reunites many cast members in 2005; notably, there is a segment where the actors who were part of season one soundly dismiss it as then-producer Anne Beatts attempts to do more ""Square Pegs""-style scripts.  There's also a blooper reel that encompasses several seasons and a ""lost episode"" starring Tupac Shakur from the lukewarm final season that should have stayed lost.",1158105600,4,1580,4.895131086142322

FOR STARTERS...WHY PEOPLE CRITIZED NEGATIVELY THIS FIRST SEASON...BECAUSE OF LISA BONET'S CHARACTER DENISE HUXTABLE.
I'VE SEEN HER IN THE COSBY SHOW & IN A DIFFERENT WORLD SEASON 1 & IT IS NOT THAT FUNNY BUT NORMALLY FUNNY WHICH YOU WILL BE BORED & IN MY OPINION THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE HATE THIS FIRST SEASON IT IS BECAUSE LISA BONET WORE OUT HER DENISE HUXTABLE CHARACTER. IT WOULD'VE BEEN COOL IF IT APPEARED AS EQUAL AS THE OTHER CHARACTERS THAN BEING THE STAR OF THE SHOW WHO LATER ON FAILED. THAT'S WHY YOU SEE & SAY THAT THE SHOW GOT BETTER & BLACKER ONCE HER DENISE CHARACTER WAS OUT FOR MANY RUMOUROUS REASONS CAUSE I'VE HEARD SEVERAL SO FAR. & DON'T GET ME WRONG FOR THE WORD BLACKER,I MEANT IT IN A VERY BLACK HUMOR WAY,CAUSE IN REALITY THE REST OF THE SEASONS SHOWED MORE BLACK CULTURE THAN THE FIRST ONE. SO IF ANYBODY GOT OFFENDED MY APOLOGIES UP FRONT.
THE SHOW IT'S OK NO MATTER THE CRITICISM,THE DETAIL WAS LISA BONET BEING VERY DENISE HUXTABLE INSTEAD OF TURNING HER CHARACTER MORE FUNNIER THAN THE COSBY SHOW,PROBABLY SHE WOULD'VE APPEARED AT LEAST ON SEASON 2 & HAVE A TRIANGLE DILEMA WITH DWAYNE & WHITLEY!! CAN YOU IMAGINE,DENISE VS. WHITLEY?? WHO WOULD'VE WON THE MATCH??
BUT IN CONCLUSION,IT IS A COOL SHOW WITH A NORMAL FUNNY CHARACTER OVEREXPOSED WHICH WAS DENISE HUXTABLE.

The main reason why I gave this dvd 2 stars is because Deniese butchered the season (she wasn't funny like she was on the Cosby Show).  Jalessa was too uptight (she'll get funnier on season 2) and Whitley and Ron (not shown enough)was not that funny for this season, but will be hilarious by season 2.

Lisa Bonet like it or not was the star 1987-1988. Why Kadeem Hardson and Jasmine guy are featured so prominently is beyond me. There is even a bonus episode that takes place in season six included.

2290720,3,B0009HBPEO,"I have really enjoyed reading the reviews of Season 1. To be perfectly honest, and to mirror some of the same thoughts of the previous posts, Season 1 was not the best. However it was a feeling out period. Season 1 of Seinfeld wasn't the best either, but that didn't stop the network from hammering out more episodes.

The show was not set at an HBCU at the time, and Hillman was more of an integrated school. I read one review here that mentioned that it was not 'culturally' integrated. Nothing could be further from the truth. Culture and race are two different things.

Back to 'A Different World'...Seasons 2-5 were the height of the show, and the decision makers who make DVDs should really consider putting those out. Starting with Season 1 is a weak idea and may halt the production of other seasons because the sales will probably be low due to the fact that the first season just wasn't as good as 2-5. Season 6 is listless, and I think they realized that the run was over, and the youth that they had previously had so much success with, was wearing thin. Also, if you remember, African American programming was not as big a deal in 1993, when the show was cancelled.

The bottom line is that Bill Cosby and Debbie Allen did a remarkable job of marketing the virtues and positives of historically Black colleges and universities for hundreds of thousands of prospective students who later attended these schools based primarily on the influence of this show, and of the film 'School Daze.' That is where its legacy lies, not in memorable episodes.

And in Season 1, that legacy was uncertain at the time, but Seasons 2-5 were as strong a representation of that mission of the promotion of education and upliftment that one could ask for.

My favorite episodes are:

DeWayne and Ron pledging Kappa Lambda Nu -

""We stand tall, we stand brave, Kappa Lambda Nu, we will stand together, Kappa Lambda Nu...""

Save the Best for Last: The Wedding - I can still hear Diahann Carrol saying ""Die...just die!""

The step competition/Homecoming during the 2nd season

A love triangle between Denise, Dwayne and Whitney would have been great viewing. After she left only Freddie could get close to pulling off the A character.

Another aspect I liked about the show was the talented Marissa Tomei was in the series which gave the show a balance.

Anyway if you are pro and you like your shows to be instantly quirky this isn't for you. But if you are a true Romantic you like your shows to be centred around a character which focuses on the centred character passage through life with real depth this series is for you.",1126396800,3,1160,4.341013824884793

Just as others have said, the 1st season was not all that great, but you have to start somewhere.  It was an evolution from mediocre to great.  You get a chance to see Dwayne evolve from geek to someone who was able to tame Whitley Gilbert (not an easy feat).  We get to see Jada Pinkett before see was Jada Pinkett Smith.  When Lisa Bonet left, no one was sure what direction the show would take, but it only gave the supporting cast a chance to shine... Thanks Lisa!  I look forward to the release of the remaining seasons.  Get ready for an amazing journey!",1126396800,3,684,4.330708661417323

2290741,4,B0009HBPEO,"A Different World ""is"" the best TV show of the 90's. It's not just an urban classic, but it's a classic that's long overdue to be sold on the shelf. I agree with other fans that the first season was nothing like the seasons to follow, but you must see how it all began. You must see the character Dwayne Wayne start out as a geek, and grow into a prince charming in later seasons. You must see Whitley Gilbert progress from being a snob to developing a heart and a sense of humor (thanks to her beau Dwayne and her friend Kimberly Reese). Even Ron started to mature towards the end as well. Aside from that, A Different World addressed issues that TV shows back then were afraid to talk about like AIDS, starring Tisha Campbell as Josey. They talked about how hard it is to survive even ""after"" graduating from college! For me, what kept me glued to the television was the chemistry between Dwayne Wayne and Whitley Gilbert. Remarkable!

I look forward to collecting all of the DVD seasons. Yes, Debbie Allen did a wonderful job when she took over!",1122249600,9,1048,4.430051813471502

2290745,3,B0009HBPEO,"(I'm glad to hear that the DVD of Season one is coming out, but before you gloss over this review, please read on...)

I had made it a point of watching it EVERY DAY on the Oxygen channel and my local station here in Chicago, and the episodes have been aired season to season from one to six chronologically as well! I was addicted to it, and I even sneak-watched it at work. However, whenever I watched it, I saw Lisa Bonet on the screen struggling to be the star of a sitcom in which the entire future of the show sat on her shoulders, and it hurt to see knowing what a dismal future she eventually laid for herself.

We all know that this show was supposed to be a star vehicle of sorts for her, but look what she did - she kinda RUINED the first season... here's why.

If I'm going to keep this review real on ANY level, one thing has to be said, once and for all - Lisa Bonet was (and still is, in my opinion) a bland actress with mediocre talent. Cosby made her a star because he saw something in her at age 9 or 10 on his show, but as she grew she unraveled herself by thinking she was somehow better than the limiting prospects of television (she has said this in subsequent interviews), then she decided to choose more 'daring' but crappy outside projects - does the film ANGEL HEART sound familiar???

Although her lines were well written by the original writers of The Cosby Show, definitely featuring situations in a culturally diverse Hillman College (with roommates to boot), she herself as a character failed miserably and I did not shed a tear when she left the show.

And let's be honest about one other thing - very few of the episodes are worth remembering - can you really remember one all the way through? The only one I can remember is the season finale, when Lisa finally goes out on a date with Dwayne before she 'goes home' to drop out later. It's funny, but it sets up a potential thing between him and Whitley, even though the show ends with Lisa kissing him and dancing with him under the stars.

You also have to remember, she was still a part of the Cosby universe, so during Season One EVERYBODY from the Cosby show visited her, and one at a time just to milk the fame effect just enough to carry us 22 minutes plus commercials. Theo with his crazy weekend, Rudy and pop, her grandfather with the whole bear-stealing thing, and yes, ol Dad Bill wanders about for a few at the beginning.

Ratings? Yes. Was it really worth watching for the QUALITY of the writing and the development? NO. I say again, NO.

By the end of the season there was a change needed, and desperately, even though the show was coming in at the top 5 ONLY BECAUSE OF IT FOLLOWING COSBY. When Bonet learned she and Lenny Kravitz were going to have a child, she walked away - she WALKED AWAY from a top 5 show to be a wife and mother, which is fine down at the local office, but from a MAJOR TV SHOW that was built around you???

This resulted in a severe shake-up, and now who would be the 'star' of the show? (Lisa would return to Cosby in a more background role.) Well, in my opinion, this was the main ingredient of change needed to make season two grow incredibly by the wonderful additions of Charnele Brown as Kim, Cree Summer as Winnie, Glynn Turman as Col. Taylor, Darryl M. Bell as Ron Johnson and comedian Sinbad. This rounded out the ensemble of already future stars Jasmine Guy, Dawnn Lewis and Kadeem Hardison.

Marisa Tomei and other minor characters were simply dropped, and Hillman suddenly went from being a culturally integrated college to an almost predominately black populated one, as it was probably intended to be. No loss there, but you can see the subtle shift from diversity to one of almost inclusion, which is fine, because I think Cosby's original goal was to bring the black experience to America on a higher level (no pimps or gangbangers here!) and to feature a (almost) totally black cast - and to his credit, it worked wonderfully!

You have to know Season One was awful - it really wasn't all that funny!!! The biggest key to the show's survival was the loss of Lisa - who was probably relieved to be walking away anyway - and when the producers hired director/choreographer DEBBIE ALLEN to SAVE THE SHOW from its lack of real ""star"" power, she then used scripts by writers who could realistically flesh out and bring to life the real trials of college for black people during the 90's with a great deal of intelligence and humor.

Sorry, I digress... this is Season One we're supposed to be talking about.

I don't know if the any of the DVDs of any of the seasons will include the recent June 21, 2005 E! Channel retrospective of A Different World which brought back a few of the main characters, but it would be nice for them to get everyone back to do a commentary of sorts on the disc and let them talk about their experiences on the show, etc. THAT would be worth the price of the disc for the first Season for me.

I love this show, and although I watch it almost every day, I can't get myself to like the first Season, because it looks like ""Cosby's A Different World featuring my daughter Lisa Bonet"" instead of just a stand alone show. I'll be waiting for the second season DVD a lot more than this one. Sorry if you're offended in any way, but look at for what it is.

8060725,4,B0009HBPEO,"A lot of the fashion and technology is going to be DATED (card catalog, no cell phones!!),,,,,but having graduated from a historically female college I was actually able to understand most of the episode politics!!.

This is a spin off of the Cosby Show, and so the cast of the Cosby Show made guest appearances throughout the season---'just in case' the series did not do well on it's own.

The one episode which would otherwise have sunk it...and seems questionable in a 'college' environment even back  then is ""Comeback Little Eggby"".  They take care of an egg baby to find out what parenting is supposed to be like??  This seems like a task which would have actually been assigned to high school-level students. Bill Cosby (who was creator of the series) apparently had not set foot on a modern-day college campus because most non-religious campuses now allowed pregnant and parenting students by the 1980's. They were no longer expelled. But strong acting and a good cast fortunately saved the series. Whew!!

Better episodes are ""My Dinner With Theo"" where Theo honestly misunderstands about college life after he comes up to visit the older sibling. College looks like so much fun!!  And ""Wild Child"" because Denise learns that a brilliant student in one of her classes has a very unique background.

This season also is unique because Lisa Bonet leaves at the end due to a real life pregnancy.. Bill Cosby was adamant that people not see a pregnant Denise Huxtable--Bonet had gotten pregnant in real-life and so she was written out of the script as returning back home. Marissa Tomei, who played the token white student, Maggie Lauten also leaves.",1522886400,,1656,4.889285714285714
