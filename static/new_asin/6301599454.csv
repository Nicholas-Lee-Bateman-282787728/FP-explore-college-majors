347149,3,6301599454,"THE BOY WHO LEFT HOME TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE SHIVERS is one of the scarier entries in the FAERIE TALE THEATRE series and thus may not be suitable for younger children, though older viewers will be captivated.

Martin (Peter MacNicol) sets out on a journey to discover the feeling of being scared.  He meets an old King (Christopher Lee) who lets Martin stay in his haunted castle for 3 nights.  If he makes it through the 3 nights without being scared away, he'll be rewarded with his own kingdom and a beautiful princess.

Dana Hill, David Warner and Frank Zappa co-star in this fabulous TALE.  Highly-recommended.",1098662400,5,614,4.700934579439252

Faerie Tale Theatre's adaptation of the Brothers Grimm tale ""The Boy Who Could Not Shiver and Shake"" is the closest Shelley Duvall's series ever goes to the horror genre.  Becoming ""The Boy Who Left Home to Find Out About the Shivers,"" it stars Peter MacNicol, Christopher Lee, and David Warner.

The importance of courage in life is a major theme, as the protagonist Martin is perplexed by his family's superstitions.  Utterly fearless himself, he goes to spend a few nights in a haunted castle(at the urging of his father, no less) to attempt to feel fear for the first time in his life.  If he can endure a number of nights in the castle, he will gain the hand of a princess and come into possession of a kingdom.

This adaptation is not made for children specifically.  It can be very dark in places, and utilizes exceptional special effects to depict ghosts and magic.  If a child is of a rare temperament who can see the sophisticated humor of the situation, they'll probably enjoy it.  If not, parents or guardians may want to be cautious.

Faerie Tale Theatre's ""The Boy Who Left Home to Find Out About the Shivers"" is very good.  Narrated by Vincent Price, it is yet another credit to the versatility of Shelley Duvall's series.",1275091200,,1254,4.654545454545454
7814238,5,6301599454,"I think the title should have been ""The Boy Who Got Kicked out of his home to find out about the shivers"". Besides this, I loved every minute of this tale! It was my first time checking out this one, and I thought it was fun, especially at the end. It has everything-fun, horror, romance, etc. Peter MacNicol is kind of cute, too. I loved Christopher Lee-he is totally magnetic, with a commanding presence, plus an even powerful voice. All in all, great job!",1167177600,,458,4.464285714285714
7814239,5,6301599454,"This is a great little flick.  Children and adults alike will enjoy this feature.  This scary story with touches of satire doesn't disappoint with good acting, good writing, and set design that's visual appealing considering the budget of the flick.

A young Peter Macnicol as Martin, Christopher Lee as the king, and Vincent Price as the narrator make this a quality show.

I loved this movie when I was a kid, and I ended up buying it as an adult.  Watching it again now I enjoyed the jokes and some of the satire that I was too young to understand when I was a kid.",1125532800,,568,4.371428571428571
7814240,2,6301599454,"Arguably one of the worst of the Faerie Tale Theatre series by Shelly Duvall. I don't see why People are saying this one is scary? this is far from scary. It would be laughable, but it's just to boring.  It moves slow, and doesn't really do anything until it's already half way through the flick or more.  I like to collect this series so regardless I am happy I got this one. I just got this one quicker than I should of based on certain reviews about it. I should have considered another faerie tale before getting this one.  I have it now, had to get it sooner or later anyway I suppose.",1108080000,,590,4.20353982300885
7814241,5,6301599454,"Arguably the best of Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre series, ""The Boy Who Left Home..."" is a macabre delight. Dragonslayer's Peter Macnicol is smart as the fearless boy and Christopher Lee is perfect as the son of Vlad the Impaler. An obvious homage to Lee's own British Hammer Horror films of the 50's with the narration of another genre favorite Vincent Price adding to the fun. Growing up in the 80's, I was entralled with the set design, actors and dry humor of this sensational series. Two or three aren't enough; buy all 26 of these priceless gems or buy the 4 disk set coming in January of 2005.",1106006400,3,607,4.577981651376147
7814242,5,6301599454,"From the antics his family goes through to try to scare him, to the real ghosts of a haunted castle, ""the boy who left home to find out about the shivers"" is not phased.  Granted, this is one of the scarrier faerie tale theatres, so maybe not good for children under 5 or 6, but will quickly become everyone's favorite episode.",1099872000,3,327,4.360655737704918
