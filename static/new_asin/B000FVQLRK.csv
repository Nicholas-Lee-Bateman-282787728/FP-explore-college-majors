8127252,2,B000FVQLRK,"A couple of 1930's Ken Maynard B westerns from Poverty Row. Each runs about an hour and they are OK, especially if you like Maynard as I do. Typical Alpha quality which isn't saying very much. Well used 16mm dupe prints were the source material and with ""Texas Gunfighter"" it's from a print obviously used by various TV stations who placed a lot of additional cues on film for commercial placement. Movies like this used to look a lot better when we all had smaller sized TV screens and this type of marginal quality wasn't so distracting. Now we have 50-70 inch screens and are spoiled by HDTV. It's sort of looking at one of these old cowboy flicks on YouTubewhere they all seem to be available now.",1411430400,,701,4.484375
8127253,4,B000FVQLRK,"Poverty Row Pictures presents ""HELL-FIRE AUSTIN/TEXAS GUN FIGHTER"" (1932) (123 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- . Ken Maynard was an American motion picture stuntman and actor --- Born Kenneth Olin Maynard in Vevay, Indiana, he was an accomplished horseman --- As a young man, he performed in rodeos and was a trick rider with Buffalo Bill 's Wild West Show and a circus rider with Ringling Brothers --- During World War I, he served in the United States Army.

He first appeared in silent motion pictures in 1923 and in addition to acting also did stunt work --- Maynard became one of the first singing cowboys with Columbia Records --- Also one of the first to make a star out of his white stallion named ""Tarzan"", a half-Arabian, half-American Saddle horse. Maynard bought him in the mid-1920's --- With his white cowboy hat, fancy shirt, and pair of six-shooters, from the 1920s to the mid-1940s --- Maynard appeared in more than 90 films --- However, his alcoholism severely impacted his life and his career ended in 1944. He owned a small circus operation featuring rodeo riders but eventually lost it to creditors.

The significant amount of money he had earned vanished and he lived a desolate life in a rundown mobile home --- During these years, Maynard was supported by an unknown admirer - long thought to be Gene Autry --- More than 25 years after his last starring role, Maynard returned to two small parts in films in 1970 and 1972 --- Ken Maynard died penniless in 1973 at the Motion Picture Home in Woodland Hills, California. He was interred at Forest Lawn Cypress Cemetery in Cypress, California. Maynard's funeral is described in detail in James Horwitz's book They Went Thataway --- His brother, Kermit Maynard, was also an actor and stuntman

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Ken Maynard has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6751 Hollywood Blvd -- (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

Our story line and plot, Heading west, Ken ""Hell-Fire"" Austin (Ken Maynard) and Bouncer (Nat Pendleton) end up at the ranch of Judy Brooks (Ivy Merton)  where Ken is to ride Tarzan in the big race --- But both the Sheriff (Charles Le Moyne) and Edmonds (Alan Roscoe) are after him and he must hide both himself and the horse until race time --- A decent B western, but by no means Maynard's best --- Believe the script could focus a bit less on the interplay between Maynard & Pendleton and more of Maynard conflict with the sheriff and Edmonds, since this scene only takes place in the last half of the film --- The redeeming point of the film would be the horse race --- Ken Maynard had been a major star in the 1920's famous for his trick riding and daring subnetwork. Unfortunately he had a few too many personal demons and his career steadily declined during the 1930s. This film is from his final solo starring series. He would re-surface briefly over weight and as nasty as ever in the 40s in Monogram's ""Trail Blazer"" with Hoot Gibson and Bob Steele --- After that he basically ""retired"" from the screen.

Our story line and plot, Bill Dane (Ken Maynard) and Banty (Lloyd Ingraham) quit Kell's (Harry Wood) outlaw gang --- When Dane prevents Kell and his men from getting a bullion shipment, he is made Sheriff --- Learning Dane is Sheriff, Kell and gang return, force Dane to give them the bullion, and make Dane a prisoner --- Escaping, Dane trails the gang and engages them in a gunfight while his horse Tarzan goes for help --- In this tightly paced Ken Maynard western (one of nine he made in 1932), the cowboy star's amazing riding skills are on impressive display. As a child, Maynard copied all the stunts he saw in circuses, and at age 14, ran away from home to join a wagon show. Maynard finally entered the movies in 1923 after working as a trick rider with the Buffalo Bill and Ringling Brothers Wild West shows.
