8638957,3,B00I40IBPE,"This release is part of a series of new ""_______ and Friends"" from Warner Bros. that features a few old cartoons for a low price.

Although Warner rereleases old episodes with or without new episodes, this is the first time they released the SAME DVD they released a decade ago under a completely DIFFERENT TITLE. This video contains the same episodes as on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-s-New-Scooby-Doo-Vol-1-Space-Ape-at-the-Cape/dp/B00009KTYH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What's New Scooby-Doo, Vol. 1 - Space Ape at the Cape</a>&nbsp;(in the same order and with the same special features) and replaced the cover with a design from an obscure, old Scooby VHS released in the UK.

The episodes are good, but the packaging is misleading. The only ""Friends"" in this release are the 4 humans in Mystery Inc. Although my nephews enjoy these episodes (one likes to sing the ""What's New, Scooby-Doo?"" theme), they do not watch them on this DVD; they watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-s-New-Scooby-Doo-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B000K2UH0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What's New Scooby-Doo?: The Complete First Season</a>, which contains these and 9 other episodes (and a different set of features).

The DVD was originally released in 2004, a year before they began releasing Scooby season sets. They released the remaining WNSD episodes on 9 more volumes and then repackaged them into 3 season sets.

This DVD is ideal for people who want to collect the series in 10 volumes to save money on each purchase and who like this cover better than the one with the alien. Not recommended for collectors.",1391040000,20,1696,5.9958677685950414
