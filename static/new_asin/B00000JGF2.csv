7912075,4,B00000JGF2,"So series 8 wasn't the greatest.  At least Rimmer is back, right?  This tape actually contains only 2 episodes of Red Dwarf.  The third episode on this tape is from the BBC 10th Anniversary RD retrospective.  We find out  in 'Pete' that birds are related to dinosaurs and the dinosaur in question  has disgusting eating habits resembling a slobby character with dreadlocks  who speaks with a Liverpool accent.  Pretty gross, especially since the  dino in question devoured a cow vindaloo, several thousands of gallons of  Coke, and numerous ice cream bars from Captain Hollister's personal stash.  He ended up smelling worse than Lister, and that's saying something.  No  poppadums or lager though.
The final episode is a cliffhanger in the  tradition of the last episodes of Series 6 and 7.  Rimmer again shows some  backbone, just like in 'Out of Time.'  Of course the RD movie may delay  Series 9, even though the last episode implies that there will be a Series  9.  Maybe the movie will tie up loose ends.
The final episode is from the  RD 10th Anniversary special and features British TV chef Ainsley Harriot in  a cooking contest between Lister/Kryten and Rimmer/Duane Dibbley.  Ainsley  Harriot played the GELF chief (and Lister's father-in-law) in 'Polymorph  2-Emohawk'. The cooking show is a hoot and Duane Dibbley is not quite the  Prince of Dorkness, at least not in the kitchen.  Lister's curry 'creation'  could be considered as toxic waste.  I can't remember if Kryten's groinal  attachment was used in the cooking show, but if it was, it would have been  quite interesting.  Oh yes, the space weevil that Lister had for dinner was  in the show, and I bet it probably tasted better than Lister's curry.  After seeing that little display, I can honestly state that pot noodles,  dog food, mint flavored Bonjela, or Kochanski's favorite of cottage cheese  and pineapple chunks would have tasted better.  And I would have preferred  to eat one of Kryten's omelettes beaten with his groinal attachment to  Lister's creation.  I wonder if the fans versus cast gameshow which was  part of the 10th Anniversary special will be available soon, as we have  'Red Dwarf A-Z', the long version of the Rimmer Munchkin song (absolutely  hilarious!), and other assorted odds and ends from that show.",948240000,9,2300,4.926509186351706
7912076,5,B00000JGF2,"What can I say, Red Dwarf has done it again with another great series.  Not only does this tape have two hillarious episodes from series VIII, but also contains a feature episode of the boys trying to cook a curry dish  with the help of a well known TV chef (Ainsley Harriot).  Swapping bowls,  cutting off finger tips (don't worry, it was Kryten's protected thumb), and  trading insults, these guys really make a mess of the finer art of cooking.  I can honestly say, it was one of the funniest things I have ever seen on  television.  Kudos!",944438400,4,543,4.469387755102041
7912077,4,B00000JGF2,"Ok, i still do not like Chris Kocanski.  i just love the bantering between the 4 boys.  but, after such a long wait here in the US, the 8 series has satisfied me for a few months.  not as good as the earilier series, but  still full of laughs, and worth the money to own.",940118400,6,271,3.8727272727272726
