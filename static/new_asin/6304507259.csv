7873529,5,6304507259,"This is possibly the most entertaining, feel-good movie I have ever seen. Based on the book by Judy Blume, it is the story of a young boy named Fudge (Luke Tarsitano), who always seems to be a pain in the side to his older brother Peter (Jake Richardson). Director Bob Clark does a marvelous job at keeping the action and fun moving. There is never a dull moment in this movie. FUDGE-A-MANIA originally aired as an installment of the ""ABC Weekend Special"" in 1995 and was the pilot for the TV series ""FUDGE"" which followed. The movie features two actors from ""THE BRADY BUNCH""--Florence Henderson and Eve Plumb. This is a movie I can watch over and over without getting bored. (I am a 59-year-old man and a former  teacher). The only tragedy is that this movie is not available on DVD. I know that I will never part with my VHS copy. If you can find this movie, please watch it and maybe someday it will be on DVD.",1248566400,13,914,4.376470588235295

Amazon, through a third person, DID.  Yeah, its a VHS, but my students didn't care!  Fine movie, and a trustworthy third party.",1243987200,7,273,4.1923076923076925
