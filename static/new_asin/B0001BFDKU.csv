1985579,1,B0001BFDKU,"Let me get right to the point.
  This special on the JFK assassination is more shallow than a puddle on hot pavement in the month of August.
  The ""evidence"" used in this nonsensical special has more holes in it than a chunk of Swiss Cheese.
  This show was poorly researched, and when you watch it, you realize how little ABC knows about the JFK murder.
 This is an utter waste of time.
 If you want a REAL, thorough investigation into the murder of JFK, I recommend the show ""The Men Who Killed Kennedy"".
  Its available on Amazon on DVD and video, and it is well done.
  This ABC show is junk.",1084838400,18,596,4.27027027027027
1985580,5,B0001BFDKU,"Viewing this documentary should be mandatory for anyone person who has seen Oliver Stone's ""JFK.""  ""Beyond Conspiracy"" was well produced and researched, it is highly entertaining.  ""Beyond Conspiracy"" presents a case for the lone gun-man theory, that Oswald alone murdered Kennedy.  Watch Stone's ""JFK"" then watch ""Beyond Conspiracy"" and decide for yourself.",1083110400,15,358,5.846153846153846
1985581,5,B0001BFDKU,"They finally got it right!  This documentary sets the record straight in the murder of President John F. Kennedy.  For years, the conspiracy theorists have bombarded the public with misinformation and falsehoods about this terrible event.  As Dr. Josef Goebbels put it, ""Tell the lie often enough and it becomes the accepted truth"".  No more!  I will comment on three items addressed in the special: the timing of the shooting, the single bullet theory, and Oswald's proficiency with a rifle.
  The conspiracy theorists say that NO ONE could get three shots of in 5 and a fraction seconds.  This sounds reasonable but the 5 second time frame is fallacious.  Visual inspection of the Zapruder Film shows Governor Connally reacting the the first shot at frame 160 by a sharp turn to his right.  The fatal shot was at frame 313.  At 18 frames per second on Zapruder's camera, this works out to 8.5 seconds.
  The next item to consider is the so called ""magic bullet"".  Popular myth is that Connally was directly in front of, and level with the President in the car and the bullet would have to defy all ballistics to injure both men.  In fact, Connally was 3 inches lower and 6 inches inboard of the President.  In addition to this, his body was turned sharply to the right.  If you look at their positions at the exact moment the bullet struck (Zapruder frames 223/224), their wounds line up and trace back directly to the sniper's nest.
  Lastly, let's examine the shooter; Lee Harvey Oswald.  Holy Writ among conspiracy theorists is that he was a mediocre shot at best.  In fact, examination of Oswald's Marine Corps shooting record shows that he qualified as a Sharp Shooter at a range of 200 yards.  The distance from the sniper's nest to the point where the fatal shot hit was 88 yards.  This was well within Oswald's capability.
  Conspiracy theorists should give due consideration to these points.  Combined this with the ""Unsolved History"" episode on the same subject which recreates the shooting, Oswald's trip from the 6th floor to the lunch room, and Oswald's encounter with Officer J. D. Tippit.  Do this; be intellectually honest, and you will see that you have subscribed to a False Faith.",1082851200,16,2201,4.769230769230769
1985582,2,B0001BFDKU,"first of all, i got pretty hyped when i heard that ABC was going to cover the Kennedy assassination, hoping that for once, SOMEBODY would cover the FACTS, but once again, i was proved wrong.

from the start, Peter Jennings states it clear, that those who believe that a conspiracy to kill JFK are flat out WRONG!

and that was it for me.
althought the program did have some pretty neat computer graphics and animation, the whole programs was BIASED and WRONG.
they based all of their information on once again, as the Warren Commission did, in trying to PROVE the single bullet theory. again and again, they showed graphics to prove the single bullet, and ONLY ONCE, through out the ENTIRE show, did they ever mention the head shot and yet they NEVER explained why it snapped back and to the left, only saying that the autospy showed the entry wound at the back of the head, which matched a shot from the 6th floor.

this despite DOZENS of Dallas doctors saying the back of President Kennedy's head was blasted out.

the head shot PROVES that the shot came from the front, and those who believe otherwise are either scared of the truth, in denial, or blind.

as always, when the single bullet theory comes up, so does that pesky little gerald posner, who ironically, failed to show up on Jesse Ventura's MSNBC show about the Kennedy assassination which provided guests that believed otherwise.

how people like Posner and Peter Jennings can go on living knowing that they are WRONG and lying to the people, i can't understand...

you want the real NON-BIASED truth about the kennedy assassination, go and check out the History Channel's The Men Who Killed Kennedy series.

you won't get the truth from ABC, just ask Michael Moore.",1080691200,27,1730,4.686468646864687
1985583,4,B0001BFDKU,"The first reviewer for this to come DVD encouraged me to take out my VHS version of this special and to finally sit down and watch it from beginning to end.  And I agree; the archival footage alone is worth the price of admission.  But...
Although I don't think Mr. David R. Von Pein bases his lone nut believing strictly on this special, I would like to remind him and everyone interested in this case to read and listen and to watch everything with a grain of salt.  Even Mr. Dale K. Myers, who supplies the 3-D graphics supporting Oswald's alleged shooting, has to admit that a computer is only as smart as the information you put in it.  If you put in the right coordinates, you could claim Oswald was actually in the Dallas County Records building at the time of the shooting, and still pulled off the same feat (although I think conspiracists would argue that would actually be an easier shot).  Further evidence that you should take this (and everything else connected up with the Kennedy assassination) with a grain of salt is Gerald Posner.
Yes; good old standby Gerald Posner takes part in this special, which surprisingly doesn't really rely that much on facts (it seems more like opinions than anything...are we supposed to take them at their word?) until its last 20 minutes or so.  ...I don't like Posner.  It's nothing personal, it's just that with his book CASE CLOSED, he carries on like he's writing nothing but the truth, but a (fair minded) person educated with just the Warren Commission Report alone will know different.  And yes, because Posner is quote 'telling the truth', he needs to tell the truth.  It's because of Posner's assistance here that I give this special only four stars, and of course listen to its facts (including those of Mr. Myers) even more so with a scrupulous eye.  I'm not totally convinced of a conspiracy in the death of JFK (which is why I can enjoy this type of special), but I'm definitely not convinced of the lone nut theory.",1075248000,14,1979,4.612535612535613
1985630,5,B0001BFDKU,"The amount of effort that went into modeling the event in 3D is impressive.  As someone who couldn't stand the amount of ignorance about ballistics and the shots that killed him from behind, it was very refreshing to see a science-based account to rectify the misinformation out there.  It was also excellent to see an account of Oswald's background and life, and his attempt to flee, since so many of the imaginative thinkers out there seem to ignore the background and psychology of the killer.",1341446400,2,496,4.823529411764706
1985631,1,B0001BFDKU,"This script is taken straight from the debunked Warren Commission Report. Watch it only if you love being lied to. From a trick bullet, defiance of physics and ignorance of thousands of hours of eye-witness testimony this video has it all, and it all adds up to sweet zilch. Sadly, the ugly propaganda head of the lame-stream media has continued to rise. Dan Rather of CBS forged Bush's National Guard documents. NBC altered George Zimmerman's 911 call. MSNCB cropped a video of an armed black man to make it seem like a white guy brought guns to an Obama rally. And most all the media continuously ran pictures of Trayvon Martin at age 12 and George Zimmerman photo-shopped to look ""white"". The media looks at the one half of our population that always falls for their crap and thinks we are all that stupid. When will they learn that this is folly?  If you want the truth, go to YouTube and search for JFK ASSASSINATION videos. The best one around is the series, subsequently banned, called THE MEN WHO KILLED KENNEDY. These people are not actors, nor are they spewing alleged suspicions. These are men and women who were there, who have the facts, and who are honest people coming forward to clear the mystery. Remember when Bush/Obama talked us into spending over Eight Trillion Dollars for ""shovel-read"" jobs??  Where are they???  The only thing the government was shoveling was manure.

1985632,1,B0001BFDKU,"If you have to watch this rubbish, check it out online or at the library, don't waste your money. The computer animation (cartoon) is bunk. Look where they put the back wound on their cartoon and then find the color photo of JFK's shirt at maryferrel.org--There's where the back wound was (over 5 down from the collar)and how could a bullet enter that far down on the man's back and exit his throat.
  ABC cuts Maclom Kildoff's press conference reply to a question where he answer's,""..It was a simple matter, Tom, of a bullet right through the head..."" But ABC cuts the film before Mr. Kildoff points to his right temple, indicating a shot from the front.

1985633,1,B0001BFDKU,"To say this documentary is the final word is at best misleading. I could care less about the documentary's magic bullet information. It's foundation is the Warren Commission report. Without it, the animated reconstruction of the murder is fantasy.

Whether there was or wasn't a single bullet that made multiple wounds from the rear is not a case closer. Junk in / junk out ... There are several people with knowledge of the wounds at the hospital and autopsy that state there was one or more entry wounds from the front. Why wasn't this challenged in the documentary? Were the autopsy photos altered? Was Oswald set up as a patsy as some people who were not interviewed by the Warren Commission stated? Were there others who wanted Kennedy dead and had the means to kill him and the power to cover it up? These have always been the nagging questions.

Some facts were covered up--- perhaps it was because leaders were trying to avoid an angry reaction and war (as stated in documentary)--- but perhaps there were sinister elements at play, too. Technology has changed a great deal since 1963 and perhaps much can be explained away today. But trust of political and the monied class has eroded, too. I do not look at governments and news like I did many years ago. Disinformation and lies are used to keep the truth from the public when it is deemed necessary.

If I was granted full knowledge of what happened in any one event in history, I would wish for complete knowledge of the Kennedy assassination. Short of that, we will never know. Peter Jennings was a fine news correspondent and television news anchor. This was not one of his best efforts. I found the glossy treatment of the topic and his marching out of people who agreed with the documentary's thesis no more impressive than others done from the conspiracy perspective.",1325030400,5,2431,5.491978609625669

1985635,5,B0001BFDKU,"Don't you just love the divide in the reviews. It's all or nothing. Frankly I too was a conspiracy buff for years but the more I learned the more I came to believe that the Warren Commision, and this FINE documentary, had it essentially right. (The order of the shots not withstanding) Here's just a few of the things that will jump out at you once you stop drinking the conspiracy Kool Aid;

- When you put Kennedy and Connelly in their proper positions in the car there is no question about the single bullet ""theory"". Given the position of the wound on Connelly's back and it's forward and downward path you realize that the bullet HAD to go through Kennedy, there simply is no other way for it to get to that spot on Connelly's back. In additon it is an oblong wound which means the bullet was tumbling and bullets don't tumble until they hit something. So it's either a single bullet or Kennedy shot Connelly with a magic gun that makes a rifle bullet tumble! (Oops, I may have just started a new conspiracy theory!) Let me repeat that and feel free to check me on it... The wound on Connelly's back was an OBLONG wound. The bullet was tumbling. How can you explain that without coming to the conclusion that the bullet hit Kennedy first? Hmmm?

- When Oswald was arrested he was carrying the revolver that several witnesses saw him shoot Officer J. D. Tippit with. It was matched ballistically to the bullets Tippit was shot with. Officer Tippit stopped Oswald for questioning because he matched the discription of the Dealy Plaza shooter which was given to the police by Howard Brennan as he sat on a wall facing the Book Depostitory. Brennan saw Oswald shoot Kennedy and discribed it in vivid detail. He saw Oswald well enough to give the police a discription that enabled Officer Tippit to stop a man who fit that discription. And, by golly, that man turned out to be the one employee who had left the Book Depository, Oswald. Upon being stopped Oswald gunned Tippit down! This is the same Oswald who left his wedding ring and all his money next to his sleeping wife and who told his car pooling pal that he was bringing ""curtain rods"" to work. No curtain rods were found in the Book Depository but a rifle that Oswald had been photographed with was found with his prints on it and three spent cartridges. (The authenticity of the photo has been verified 29 times and the vast majority of the witnesses, 88%, said they heard three shots. 7% said they heard fewer and only 5% said they heard more.) After the shooting, when a cop stops him, Oswald guns him down! Gee, what does it all mean? Honestly, of all the OBVIOUS things that get lost in the conspiracy haze none is as blatant as Oswald's actions following the shooting. They are clearly the acts of a guilty man. And the fact that a witness gave the police an accurate enough discription of the shooter that Tippit was able to spot Oswald based on it is even omitted in this documentary. Sometimes the most obvious things just get passed over. Ask a conspiracy buff who Howard Brennan was and wait for the blank stare. Once you tell them they'll just have to add him to their never ending list of co-conspiritors.

- The autopsy evidence CLEARLY shows that the wounds to Kennedy's head were a small entry wound in the rear and a large exit wound to the front/right of his head. (Which would account for the recoil back and to the left as this documentary points out.) And please spare me the Best Evidence/Lifton non-sense. This is a guy who came to the conclusion that NONE of the shots came from behind. Try making sense of the bullet that hit Connelly with that guy's theories! (It was actually after reading the Lifton book and that conclusion that I seriously began to question the conspiracy theories. If someone could write a best seller and make THAT obvious of a mistake something had to be rotten.)

  Now, saddly, if you're one of the people who gave this fine documentary one star because you're too invested in years of being a conspiracy buff to give it up, all of this will bounce off of you like BBs on a battleship. You'll come back and say that Jean Hill knows the real story or that some half-blind guy standing two hundred yards away knows more than the three guys who were on the floor below Oswald and testified that heard him fire three times just over their heads. But if you happen to be someone who has an open mind... give it some thought. It took me years to admit I was wrong about this being a conspiracy. Perhaps I should start a support group. Judging from all the one star reviews a few people desperately need one.",1303862400,10,4613,4.479191438763377
1985636,1,B0001BFDKU,Why oh why do people fall for this one sided hogwash of a documentary. This is nothing but lies from start to finish. Recomended and apparently liked by people who know nothing about the facts of the assassination.,1298505600,7,214,4.657894736842105
1985637,1,B0001BFDKU,"I have watched hours of videos and read thousands of pages of text by many different producers and authors, and just about all of them site different views of proving or disproving events and facts regarding the JFK assassination.  If I didn't know any better, I would have guessed this film was made by the Warren Commission!  It is so biased to the 'Lone Gunman' theory that the commission sited in its report, and totally disregards so many facts and pieces of evidence.  It totally focuses on Oswald and his political views, showing his scores on his rifle shooting skills in the Marines, showing pictures of him with guns - all I can say is that it appears to be nothing but propaganda.  And the timing of this film coming out within a year after the final 3 episodes of ""The Men Who Killed Kennedy"" were shown on The History Channel, and were subsequently taken off and never to be reproduced or aired again (because of a lawsuit by the family of LBJ, and The History Channel backing down from their threats) leaves me wondering who was really behind this film.

I would love to see a sequel to this film, taking the original film and having 'conspiracy theorists' ask questions about different parts of the film and show ""the other side"" to the original presentation, allowing the viewer to draw their own conclusion, so that it is not only based on the one sided information that was originally presented.

I was getting very angry at about the 1 hr mark in this film, waiting for other facts and information to be presented, and at that point, I was facing the fact that this IS a one sided film, but trying to be open minded, I finished watching it, and found myself even more angry and frustrated and disappointed.  I'm not saying ""don't watch this film"", I think people should watch it to see how the media is still the major influence on what the American people believe about everything.",1294272000,8,1901,4.573529411764706

1985660,5,B0001BFDKU,"John Adams was right--facts are inconvenient things, no more so than when they show once and for all that President Kennedy was murdered by a homicidal punk shooting from a window in the Texas School Book Depository--not, as revisionist liar Oliver Stone would have it, by several gunmen in several places.  At long last, a computer representation of the events that transpired in Dealey Plaza, based on a frame-by-frame analysis of the famous Zapruder film, plausibly suggests what happened and when on that terrible day.  There will always be perfectly honest students of the Kennedy assassination who believe the President's murder was the result of a conspiracy, but this absorbing documentary may give them something to think about.

In any case, many of the conspiracy theories have fatal flaws, or at least unanswerable objections.  For example:  If there was a gunman on the grassy knoll, how could he have escaped detection and capture?  And if there was a gunman who popped up from a convenient sewer and shot at President Kennedy, how did the bullet keep from striking the grille or the windshield of the presidential limousine?  Common sense alone refutes the absured inventions of revisionist loonies like Oliver Stone, and their very source--Mr. Stone's fevered imagination and his talent for disseminating gigantic lies--should dispel whatever credibility these explanations may have had in the first place.

Finally:  If there truly was a conspiracy, why didn't Robert Kennedy try to root it out?  As Attorney General he commanded the formidable investigative resources of the F.B.I., and he would surely have done everything in his considerable power to bring his brother's murderer to justice.  That this fiercely willful and partisan man never investigated the supposed conspiracy behind his brother's death suggests that either there was no conspiracy in the first place or--incredibly--that RFK himself was a part of it.

If you lived through those terrible days in 1963--or even if you didn't--I think you will find satisfaction and a kind of sad comfort in watching this elegant argument for what was almost certainly the simple but tragic truth behind the murder of John F. Kennedy.  Requiescat in pace!",1280188800,3,2227,5.22191011235955

1985665,1,B0001BFDKU,"This so-called ""documentary"" is beneath contempt.

The narrator, Peter Jennings, does something quite revealing at the beginning of the program.  He points out that there are so many conspiracies regarding the Kennedy assassination that ""we don't have time to delve into all of them."" ... And so what does the program do?  It delves into *none* of them.

In other words, here's a purported documentary that seeks to debunk the idea that JFK was killed as part of a conspiracy and then convenienlty sets aside  consideration of *any* of the conspiracy theories being offered.

Moreover, along with this set-aside of conspiracy theories there is a set-aside of the truckloads of FACTS that back up these various conspiracy theories!

-- No mention is made of the fact that the majority of people present at the assassination site, including the police, pointed to and rushed the grassy knoll.

-- No mention is made of the witnesses who swore that they saw Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby together before the assassination.

-- No mention is made of the fact that assassination attempts, via a conspiracy,  were foiled in Chicago and Miami before Kennedy went to Dallas.

-- No mention is made of the unlikely number of ""accidental deaths"" of key witnesses in the case.

-- No mention is made of Kennedy's promise after the Bay of Pigs fiasco to ""shatter the CIA into a thousand pieces.""

And on and on.

Instead of pointing out these facts and attempting to rebut them, the program simply ignores them.

In place of an intellectually honest confrontation with these facts, the program -- rather I should say the ""show"" -- spends an inordinate amount of time on:

a.) Oswald's ""personality"" -- in other words his a priori predisposition to being (guess what?) a lone nut.  (Lone nut, lone gunman -- get it?)

b.) Oliver Stone's obviously flawed and at times ridiculous movie ""JFK."" and

c.) Jim Garrison's inconsequential trial of Clay Shaw.

Interestingly enough, the show does something that is *common* to all claims that Oswald and Oswald alone killed Kennedy.  It maintains that the reason why people are inclined to believe in a conspiracy is that they simply can't accept that a great man such as John Kennedy was shot by a loser, a nut, ""a nobody.""  That the balance between a great man, on the one hand, versus a lone assassin on the other just doesn't sit well with the American public.

But this is nonsense.  The majority of Americans don't believe the Warren Commission, especially today, because they know incontrovertible *facts* about the American government and American mainstream and how they operate. ...

They know that not just the government but mainstream media *lie* about what the government does.  It knows full well about the lies regarding Vietnam, the lies regarding Watergate, the lies regarding the Iraq War, and now the lies regarding the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  (You might recall that initially, incredibly, BP said *no* oil spilled; the government dutifully backing them up.)

The American public knows full well about the myriad lies put forth by the CIA, the FBI, the Pentagon and the State Department.  *That's* why they distrust the Warren Commission, a joke of an investigation.  That's why, try as this show might, it falls flat on its face trying to convince anyone with even a *shred* of knowledge that Oswald acted alone.

And the general population's knowledge of how the government and how mainstream media lie is not based on ""theories,"" it's based on  facts.

... Did Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon lie about Vietnam?

... Was Vietnam a threat to the United States?

... Was Nixon lying about Watergate?

... Did the CIA overthrow governments in Guatemala, Iran, Chile?

... Did Nixon, McCarthy, HUAC, et al lie about ""The Red Menace""?

... Were there WMDs in Iraq?

... When the vote to go to war with Iraq came up in the Senate, did Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld *and* the mainstream of the Democratic Party lie about the threat posed by Iraq to the security of the United States?

... Think maybe the same lies are being perpetrated as regards Iran?  But don't worry *that* question will never be explored by ABCNBCCBSCNNTIMENEWSWEEKTHENEWYORKTIMES.

This longstanding *history* of lying is not based on conspiracy theories or mere conjecture; in fact, quite the contrary -- it's there in plain sight.

It's always quite remarkable, breathtaking really, when one sees mainstream media in the United States gearing up to propagandize the American public.  That Peter Jennings was able to host this show with a straight face is a tribute to his fealty to the power elite in general and his ruling elite neighbors/colleagues in particular --the ruling elite only getting upset at each other when really important issues are being debated, such as which yacht wax they prefer.

For a documentary that's not only intellectually honest but that also puts the Kennedy assassination in the *context* of what was going on at the time -- re. the  the FBI, the CIA, the Cuban crazies, the right-wing crazies and the Mafia -- see ""The Murder of JFK: A Revisionist History"" - http://www.amazon.com/Murder-JFK-Revisionist-History/dp/B000BT96PK/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1255789741&sr=8-2

By contrast, Peter Jennings' apparatchik piece of garbage treats the JFK assassination like a fairy tale -- wherein the good prince is suddenly and brazenly taken from us by the evil lone gunman.  As if virtually nothing was going on politically besides that oft-told media-inspired fairy tale -- a fairy tale ""FPC"" (""For Public Consumption"") -- long since dismissed by serious investigators into the JFK assassination.

As for Peter Jennings' integrity, why pick on the man? -- his lack of integirty is no different than that of his compatriots: Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather, Katie Couric, Brian Williams. ... When Peter Jennings was alive, what do you think would have happened if he had gone to his bosses at ABC and sayid ""How's 'bout we do an investigative report on Disney.  (Disney being the parent company of ABC.)  Yeah, we'll investigate how they treat their American workers, and the fact that they run sweatshops in third world countries."" ... ABC being owned by Disney, he would have been fired in a New York minute.

Not that the thought would even cross Jennings' mind -- self-censorship being the most effective kind of thought control.

And what do you imagine would happen if Tom Brokaw of NBC got the bright, albeit democratically-appropriate notion of doing a report on General Electric.  Its sweetheart contracts with the Pentagon; the fact that General Electric consistently underpays what it should in corporate taxes, and that for three years running didn't pay *any* corporate taxes. ... Well, seeing that General Elelectic owns NBC no doubt the thought never closed Honest-Upright, Bought-and-Paid-For good ole Tom's mind.

Think anyone over at CNN will say anything essentially or fundamentally negative about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, wars that are making Corporate America rich -- CNN owned and sponsored by the leading ranks of Corporate America.

No, Peter Jennings, like all bought-and-paid-for corporate mouthpieces, did his job and was amply rewarded.  Like the political establishment, meaning the Democratic-Republican duopoly, he was nothing more than a servant of the economic elite.

That he did this via the cockeyed premises this ""show"" purports, and in so blatantly and outrageous a manner, brings to mind what Hitler said in ""Mein Kampf"" about The Big Lie; namely, if the lie is big enough and outrageous enough and is told often enough, that, so those in power hope, the lie will take root.

Though I doubt in the case of this piece of crap-nonsense Jennings and ABC got away with it -- albeit ABC et al are still at it, still trying to pour cement over the lies.

No one in mainstream media would dare violate the self-censorship rules that effectively prohibits any challenge to the righteousness (and inevitablility) of the political establishment or the predatory motives of American foreign policy.

Quoting from that article by David Walsh:

""During their maudlin tribute to Jennings on ""World News Tonight,"" his colleagues at ABC referred to him as a ""consummate reporter."" He was no such thing. A penetrating journalist would have had no difficulty in uncovering and exposing the Bush administration's lies about weapons of mass destruction, the supposed ties between Iraq and Al Qaeda and all the rest. If he had done that, he would have left a legacy of real value.

""But if Jennings had seriously questioned the behavior of government officials over Iraq ""on behalf of the public,"" he would not have kept his $10 million-a-year salary, nor received grateful tributes from George W. Bush, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, and Democrats John Kerry and Nancy Pelosi after his death. ...

""One cannot point to a single broadcast of his that expressed a deep concern for (the) lives and difficulties (of average people) -- along the lines of Edward R. Murrow's Harvest of Shame in 1960 -- or revealed some harsh truth about America that led to genuine soul-searching.

Instead, for the most part, he adapted himself to the tabloidizing of American television news, hosting programs, for example, about ""The Search for Jesus"" and UFOs. ...

""Public opinion in the US is formed by a painstaking process, a daily cycle through which the media fixes its ""take"" on events and transmits that to its viewing audience. On the morning television programs (NBC's ""Today"" and ABC's ""Good Morning America"" in particular) the basic stories are laid out.

""Often a major government figure will be interviewed. The American people are told what their concerns and opinions are. On the three network evening programs, one is given the official version of what happened during the day, the events are packaged and tied up neatly. The anchor person sums up the day and puts it all in perspective.

""If a significant event takes place late enough in the day so that the official line has not entirely been worked out by 6:30 or 7 p.m., there is always ABC's ""Nightline"" at 11:30 p.m. or the comic monologues on the late-night talk shows. By the next morning, the cycle begins again. In this manner the American ruling elite strives to create a national consensus.

""The process has been more or less perfected. The problem, however, is that the entire media machine has been systematically discredited by its deplorable role on every major political question of the last two decades.

""The evening news programs and their avuncular anchormen, in particular, fulfill a quite significant function. These individuals are not simply talking heads, mere empty vessels. Their job is to hold the country together, particularly at those moments when events threaten to get out of hand in a country so heterogeneous and so internally divided along social, ethnic and demographic lines. The demeanor and voice of a Jennings are meant to reassure the public that everything is under control, continuity has been preserved, the old institutions are operating smoothly. ...

""(Now minus not only Peter Jennings but also Tom Brokaw and Dan Rather) America is headed into uncharted waters, without a number of the reassuring faces and voices that in the past conferred the imprimatur of legitimacy on so many lies and crimes.""",1255737600,13,11495,5.047644256220222
1985666,5,B0001BFDKU,"It's easy to be swayed by all the misinformation that's out there. I myself had no idea the extent to which Oliver Stone LIED in his ridiculous movie. But this documentary shows in impeccable detail Oswald's personal history leading up to the assassination (including his attempted assassination of a racist leader about 6 months before Kennedy). With interviews of his own family members, it becomes clear that Oswald did this on his own for his own reasons. Another key part of the documentary is its de-mythologizing of the so-called ""magic bullet."" Oliver Stone and other conspiracists must lie about that in order to make their case, but in this documentary we see the truth-- the supposed impossible pathway becomes absolutely possible when you match Kennedy's and Governor Connely's positions in the car, and the fact that Connelly's seat was 3 inches lower than Kennedy's. Thank you to the creators of this film for their excellent application of reason to the evidence.",1255651200,12,978,5.080745341614906
1985667,5,B0001BFDKU,"In preparation for a visit to Dallas and the Sixth Floor Museum, we watched this DVD with our kids.  It worked well to introduce some of the conspiracy theories to them and to debunk some of them as well.  I would have liked more information - which I have seen and read from other sources - about the motorcycle-based audio and why or why not it is valid, but otherwise found this DVD to be informative.

I'm sure hard-core conspiracy buffs already knew this, but the information in this DVD relating to Jack Ruby's shooting of Oswald does debunk some of the theories about him.  For example, if he was in on the conspiracy and his job was to get rid of Oswald, would it do any good to wait two days to kill Oswald, when Oswald could have already ""spilled the beans""?  Wouldn't it make more sense to have someone ""bump off"" Oswald earlier?  Would he have taken the time to wire one of his dancers money before strolling down to the police department?  Would he have taken his dog?",1242259200,5,981,4.386740331491713
1985668,1,B0001BFDKU,"The film begins with a view of Dealey Plaza in Dallas Texas. Some frames from the Zapruder film are shown. The accused assassin was bumped off in the police station. The American people still believe in a conspiracy theory. This film is an attempt to argue against this. It shows news film from that time. The short quotes from some people are designed to advance their argument. There is a realistic-looking reproduction of the Zapruder film with a voice telling us what to believe, giving an opinion as fact. They glide over a number of facts that they find inconvenient. You must read some books to become educated about this event. ""I'm just a patsy.""

President Johnson believed this was a Communist conspiracy that would be followed by a Nuclear War. [The Cuban Missile Crisis occurred in October 1962.] This film said Lee Oswald had no friends but some book said he was elected eighth grade class president. After three years in the Marines he quit to travel to the USSR. Oswald was without education and skills, they said. What a comment on his experiences! The people who befriended him then now speak out against him. There was no handwritten confession about his plans although he did write about other things. Any good book will tell about Oswald's strange behavior. ""He was not a stupid guy."" Were any of Oswald's plans written down? Did Ruth Paine get Oswald his job at the Texas Schoolbook Depository Building? If so, did she have some kind of connection?

Why did Oswald leave his marriage ring and his money behind on the morning of 11/22/1963? Did this ever happen before? No records were kept of Oswald's interrogation in the police station. Jack Ruby was well known to the police. [Was he the leader of organized crime and given orders to do it?] Why was Jack Ruby among the reporters? Was the transfer of Oswald delayed until Jack Ruby could get there? Was it one crazy killing another crazy? Most Americans suspected a conspiracy after Oswald's death, just like many Europeans. The illustration showing a bullet hitting JFK's shoulder then going into Connally's back has two problems. It doesn't account for the entrance wound in JFK's throat and ignores the lack of an exit wound in JFK's front shoulder. It seems to be faked. Connally always said he was hit by the second shot.

In 1976 the House Select Committee reopened the investigation. The analysis of an audio tape led to the conclusion of four shots from two shooters. Robert Blakey said organized crime hired Oswald to shoot JFK, and Jack Ruby to silence Oswald. But another witness said organized crime never talked about it. There was no mention of the tree growing in front of the TSBD building which blocked the view of the limousine for a while. Jim Garrison found a link to Oswald in New Orleans, but it wasn't proved. [Read the books about this.] This film attacks Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" film and uses a two-dimensional drawing to line up JFK and Connally so a single bullet struck both men. [My impression from their demeanor was that some of the witnesses weren't truthful.]

David Wrone's ""The Zapruder Film"" presents a photograph to prove that Oswald, not a co-worker, was in the doorway when the first shot was fired. That overturns the Warren Report and those who defend it. George O'Toole's 1974 book ""The Assassination Tapes"" provided objective proof for questioning the Warren Report.",1239840000,4,3381,4.814113597246127
1985669,1,B0001BFDKU,"I watched less than 10 minutes of this tripe; it's obviously another effort(like Gerald Posner's arrogantly-titled 'Cased Closed')to convince us that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.  To you who want to put so much stock in a computer-animated 'recreation':  LOOK AT THE ZAPRUDER FILM!  That fatal head shot came from the front-right; there's no question in my mind, and no one will ever convince me otherwise.  If you want to hear and see some really thought-provoking evidence in the Kennedy assassination, purchase the British-produced series ""The Men Who Killed Kennedy.""  It's well-researched, and it contains interviews with people WHO WERE THERE on November 22, 1963 and the immediate days after, and who where EYE WITNESSES to the events.

1985683,5,B0001BFDKU,"I watched and taped this program when it was first broadcast in 2004 and was so impressed by it, I've kept the tape.  I am glad it is still available on DVD because ""Beyond Conspiracy"" is a well-done and convincing documentary on the Kennedy assassination that defends the Warren Commission's findings that Lee Harvey Oswald was the only shooter and acted alone.  Ironically, the simplest answer is hard to believe sometimes and many who support one conspiracy theory or another will probably not be swayed by this DVD, but the evidence shown in this report is strong and would need to be dealt with to defend any theories involving magic bullets, second gunman, Oswald's connections with the CIA or KGB, Jack Ruby's ties with the Mafia, etc.

The most eye-opening part of this program are the findings of computer animator Dale Myers.  He designed a computerized 3D replica of Dealey Plaza which utilized the movements of JFK and Governor Connally in the Zapruder film to recreate the shooting.  The computer imagery shows the precise positions in the limousine and how a single bullet passed straight through both men causing their simultaneous reactions.  The bullet is then traced to its exact source--the sixth floor window of the Texas school book depository.  I was very impressed by this footage and think anyone interested in the assassination should see it.

The program also gives a biography of Lee Harvey Oswald with interview clips of his older brother, Robert, a journalist who knew Oswald when he defected to the Soviet Union, and a woman who knew Oswald and his wife in Dallas.  It covers Oswald's troubled childhood, his attraction to Marxist philosophy, in large part, (according to his brother) to stand out from the crowd.  He had a flair for the dramatics (slitting his wrist in Russia so the Soviet authorities would allow him to stay in the country) and an obsessive need to be something more than he was.  When the motorcade route for JFK's visit was published in the paper and was revealed to pass right by the book depository where Oswald was a clerk, he seized the opportunity.  Even more important as evidence of Oswald's sole guilt is information on his plot to assassinate retired general and anti-Communist Edwin Walker.  Also, there is compelling evidence in this program revealing that Oswald was a superb marksman who was more than capable of shooting off the shots in the time allotted.

The program does not ignore the conspiracy theories.  It covers the Warren Commission's failure to address the issue of Cuba and Castro's possible involvement (this area is probably not covered enough to refute conspiracy theorists).  The Mafia ties are examined as well and Jack Ruby is painted as a braggart and loose cannon who would make a poor candidate for a co-conspirator.  The fourth shot on the grassy knoll that scientists, in a 1976 re-examination of the Warren Report, claim can be heard from an open-microphone recording on a police motorcycle is refuted by Myers' computerized time-line of the motorcade that reveals officer McLain (who had always said he was not in position to pick up such a shot) was not in position the scientists claimed (Vince Bugliosi further dispels the fourth shot theory in his book ""Reclaiming History"").

Finally, the program pokes many holes in Oliver Stone's motion picture ""JFK.""  It is very unfortunate that many people get their history from Hollywood. THIS DVD is one that needs to be watched on the Kennedy assassination, not a movie with actors and a script that takes artistic license.  One area that is not covered is the simulated trial of Lee Harvey Oswald in London, but, again, Bugliosi (the prosecutor in that trial) will cover this topic in his book.  Again, this program won't turn around everyone's opinion, but any discussion on the subject that does not at least address the compelling evidence revealed in ""Beyond Conspiracy"" is insufficient.",1230422400,24,3931,4.961890243902439

Yet not once did Oswald, who allegedly aspired to be famous, admit to anything. According to the documentary, Oswald attempted to kill General Walker but failed. He planned to hijack a plane, but his wife convinced him that it was impossible. HOWEVER...... he was able to assassinate the country's most popular president?! Hogwash! And what about that horrifying headshot? As a former military cop myself, I assert that the presidents body movement is completely inconsistent with a shot from the rear. Period. And who were some of the members of the Warren Commission? Allen W. Dulles, the FORMER director of the Central Intelligence Agency and Richard B. Russell, both of whom were previously fired by JFK.

1985686,5,B0001BFDKU,"I used to consider the possibility of a conspiracy behind the JFK assassination and started researching years ago to find indications that would support it.

All I found were wild theories and dead ends.
As a matter of fact, everything I discovered pointed me in the opposite direction.

When there's so much factual evidence against one person it's very hard to believe that ALL of it could be fabricated.

It surprises me that many people I talk to never heard of Major Walker.
They don't even know that Oswald attempted to assassinate Major Walker at his home prior to killing Kennedy.

On the day he attempted to kill Walker Oswald left his wedding ring, cash and a detailed letter to his wife on how she could get by without him if he should be caught, he even told her that he took a shot at Walker and was upset to read in the paper the next day that he had missed. The bullet retrieved from Walker's window pane matched Oswald's rifle that he used to kill Kennedy...isn't that enough proof in itself ?

Some conspiracy theorists don't even know who officer J.D. Tippit was, that Oswald shot him in front of witnesses and that the bullets retrieved matched Oswald's revolver, (the same revolver he pulled in the movie theater when the police cornered him).

As far as the shot coming from the grassy knoll...
OH PLEASE GIVE ME A BREAK !!!
Doesn't anyone realize how tough a shot that is to pull off?
You've got a moving target traveling from left to right and you'd have to aim in front of Kennedy so the bullet would be there at just the right time. The odds are very much against it.

If there was a conspiracy to set up Oswald using more than one shooter then the instant another shooter pulls the trigger he's introducing another type of bullet into the crime scene...if the police found more than one type of bullet that would CERTAINLY prove a conspiracy wouldn't it?

Why would someone plant a supposed ""pristine bullet"" on a hospital stretcher?
Wouldn't that make people think conspiracy ???
Wouldn't it make more sense to put a mangled bullet on the stretcher to make it appear that it was involved ?
On second thought, what sense does it make to put a bullet there at all?
What would it prove or disprove?
Would the conspirators take the chance of someone seeing him plant a bullet?...
that would prove a conspiracy.
The idea of a planted bullet is idiotic.

Conspiracy theorists who say that the head shot came from the grassy knoll because Kennedy's head moved back and to the left should study the Zapruder film more closely. If you pause your VHS or DVD player at frame 312 of the Zapruder film and move one frame at-a-time you will CLEARLY see Kennedy's head move FORWARD slightly at the time of impact.
Since frame 313 shows Kennedy's head opened up it also indicates that the bullet has ALREADY LEFT and is long gone by the time his head even starts to move backwards.

And if anyone out there knows ANYTHING about ballistics they'd know that a bullet makes a small hole upon entry and a much larger hole upon exit.
Let's examine this...small hole in the back of head and a large hole in the right parietal part of head. It really doesn't take a lot to figure this one out does it?

I guess many people believe that Oswald was innocent simply because he said he didn't do it. Well the jails are full of people who say they're  innocent too.

Anyone who wants to comment on the Kennedy assassination really owes it to him / herself and everyone else to investigate and gather as many facts as possible in order to make a fair judgement... a little common sense wouldn't hurt either.",1194825600,15,3605,4.5107361963190185
1985687,5,B0001BFDKU,"Peter Jennings and company did a masterful job in this documentary.  The best part is when they use computer animation by the guy who's been studying the JFK assassination for over twenty years.  They do fatal damage to the idea of the ""magic bullet"".  Governor Connelly wasn't sitting directly in front of JFK;  his seat was set six inches to the left of Kennedy's.  Also, Connelly's seat was three inches lower than Kennedy's.  At the moment the shot went through Kennedy and Connelly, the Governor was turned to his right.  The bullet would have no problem going straight through the president and the governor.

Also, an elderly doctor demonstrates that three shots from a Mannlicher-Carcano rifle can be fired in eight seconds (or less).

Lee Harvey Oswald's brother is interviewed, and he states that he thinks his brother did it.

There are many different pieces of evidence that prove fatal to the idea of a conspiracy.  But it's like one of the people in the documentary said;  some people want to believe in a conspiracy.  They don't want to believe that a little bitty nobody like Oswald could have pulled off one of the biggest crimes of the century.

1985688,1,B0001BFDKU,"Give me an ever-lovin' break.

No one in America has been or remains more eager to ""prove"" the poorly conducted prosecutor's brief that is The Warren Report than the American News Media.  Why? It could be they were bought off, rather implausible but they are beholden to the government for their licenses.  It could be they are embarrassed to retract their unwarranted approval of the report when it first arrived, it could be they embarrassed to retract the plethora of inaccurate and dishonest reporting they have provided the American people over the past 45 years on this subject.  Embarrassment at one's own foibles has made people do stupider things than that.  That's anybody's guess, but clearly the idea that the news media might have a vested interest in ""proving"" the Warren Report was right after all is not too difficult to imagine.  If someday someone finally unearths an undeniable smoking gun, think of the egg that will be on their faces. Of course they want you to believe they can prove it after all.  They can't or they surely wouldn't have waited 40 years to do so.

To take the JFK murder ""beyond conspiracy"", one has to solve the crime, doesn't one?  And that is inarguably not accomplished in this program, only one of several pro-Warren Report ""documentaries"" that miraculously appeared on the scene at the 40th anniversary of the assassination.  Putting people in a computer simulated mock up and moving them about fractions of inches proves very little.  It might prove that it is theoretically possible for a bullet to have passed through both Kennedy and Connally, no one ever said it wasn't possible, nor would the bullet have had to come from the Book Depository in particular to have done so.  It does not explain how a bullet alleged to have done so and caused seven injuries in two men emerges in pristine condition, free of blood or tissue, or even a dent, on a stretcher at Parkland Hospital that was used by neither man, nor does it explain how they are obviously struck by different bullets according to the Zapruder film, the testimony of both Governor and Mrs. Connally, and the majority of the witnesses who testified regarding this impact.  Ask yourself why.

All of the character assassination that can be dredged up in the entire world about Lee Harvey Oswald will not change the fact that not one single person saw, or claims to have seen, Mr. Oswald in that window pulling off a feat of marksmanship that could not be duplicated by the world's greatest sharpshooters with that piece of crap rifle.  Ask yourself why.

And neither Peter Jennings nor the entire staff of ABC News combined can explain how the alleged crazed act of a lone nut in any way jeopardizes national security in such a manner as to cause the records and evidence in the case to be sealed from the public for 75 years.  Even in the 21st century, years after the enactment of the Freedom of Information Act and the Assassination Records Review Board, literally hundreds of thousands of documents (perhaps most notably Oswald's IRS records) remain hidden from the public.  Some have been demanded released in a court of law, YOUR courts of law, people, only to have the agencies responsible for these documents then claim they must have been ""accidentally"" destroyed. Ask yourself why.

This ""documentary"" will be of great entertainment, and comfort and solace to those who, for their own personal reasons, cannot violate the official party line.  To those who truly wish to approach the assassination with an open mind, whether they are inclined to believe it was Oswald or someone else but want to know more, hard proof or even generally accepted facts are few and far between in this piece.  It does not prove what it sets out to prove, it does not carry us ""beyond conspiracy"", indeed it only serves to create an even more uncomfortable and paranoid environment of study than already existed (if that's possible).

One thing that close inspection of the Zapruder film makes undeniably clear is that both Kennedy and Connelly were shot at the exact same instant. It would be virtually impossible for two shooters,at two different locations to fire their weapons at precisely the same instant. And even if they did the bullets would have struck at different times because of the differences in distance from the two supposed shooting ""locations"".Even if one rejects the trajectory evidence as technological hokum it is impossible to deny the virtual impossibility of two shooters,firing from different locations and striking two victime at precisely the same millisecond.

Lee Harvey's brother Robert,is a highly intelligent and thoroughly sound thinking individual. Throughout his life he has carefully,thoughtfully and above all,objectivey studied the evidence against his brother Lee. Robert is a genuinely decent man who would love dearly to clear his family name of Lee's horrible crime. It is a testament to his personal courage that he insists on the unvarnished truth about what his brother did. It is Roberts very painfull contribution to our country  that it might finally heal from this old wound. And it is he,the one who knew Lee better than anyone[including Lee's russian wife Marina] who long ago concluded that his brother both acted alone and had the motivation to commit the assassination.

Lee Oswald was a very intelligent but screwed up guy who hated this country for reasons that only a psychiatrist could explain. Long before the Warren Commision issued it's report the press had dug up everything on Lee Oswald it could find. Back then it was clear to all americans that JFK had been killed by an american communist named Lee Harvey Oswald and that was all there was to it. The conspiracy theories didn't even get going until JFK had been dead for ten years. The new evidence simply confirms what we all knew back then to begin with.

The unsatisfying truth is that one man with a gun,the skill to use it and the commitment can kill even the highest public figures. Particularly if they insist on driving around in wide open limos. One would have thought that after a very Lee Oswald type of guy killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand and set off a world war,that world leaders would have given up on the open limo idea.

1985705,5,B0001BFDKU,"I have seen this doc a few times (as it runs often on the History Channel) and find it continually entertaining, fascinating and informative. A step-by-step debunking of the myths surrounding the assassination, that logically and clearly explains the misconceptions that have led to so many conspiracy theories. There are several detailed summary/reviews, so I'll be brief: no 2nd gunman, no magic bullet, just a lone shooter in a window with a desire to do something big.

But the doc also provides excellent information on the background and psychology of Oswald, the social context of the time period, a good look at the various commissions that reviewed the assassination and some great work by smart people who piece the event together to create a complete picture.

It also gives fair voice to some pro conspiracy folks, while respectfully but clearly explaining why they are completely wrong. The doc also exposes the film JFK for the piece of nonsensical fiction that it is (I love Oliver Stone, but this movie really illustrates the disturbing ability of a film to mold a false reality by claiming itself as historical fact). A cynic might conclude that some of the things Stone took ""dramatic license"" with (i.e. the magic bullet, ""back & to the left"", Oswald was a bad shot, etc...) were so obviously erroneous that it is clear his motive for making the film was to ""get paid"", which he did.

Strongest (seemingly air-tight) case for a lone gunman / no conspiracy I've ever seen - bravo. Whatever side of the fence you reside on, you must see this doc to have a full picture of this controversial event.",1171497600,12,1614,4.840579710144928
1985706,2,B0001BFDKU,"ABC dives into the Kennedy killing with this video showing how the lone-nut Oswald did the killing alone, just as the Warren Commission said he did.  The main focus of the video seems to be to show why all of the conspiracy-theory people are mistaken and misled.  Unfortunately, the content is sufficiently weak that the video's ability to persuade will be limited to those who are completely unfamiliar with the facts.

It's easy to believe in the lone-nut theory of the killing as long as you believe things like:  1) the Parkland Hospital doctors in the ER who had seen many bullet wounds were mistaken about seeing an entry wound on the front of Kennedy's neck, an exit wound on the back of his head, and the absence of the grotesque wound on the right side of Kennedy's head seen on the Zapruder film, 2) the autopsy accurately identified the type and location of Kennedy's wounds, 3) the second bullet fired by lone-nut Oswald passed through Kennedy's body, through Connally's body, and lodged in Connally's leg, later to fall out on the stretcher in good condition and morph from the pointed shape identified by the finder to the rounded shape found by the Warren Commission, 4) the eyewitnesses and police at the scene when the shooting occurred were mistaken about the number of shots they heard, hearing shots originate from the grassy knoll, and seeing the limousine momentarily stop, 5) Oswald fired three shots with a bolt-action rifle in 6 seconds and was able to fire down at a target moving away from him and up an incline while hitting with two shots, 6) Oswald decided not to fire when the Kennedy limousine was coming towards him but waited until after it had made the turn directly in front of him, had traveled several hundred yards, and was moving away, 7) Oswald was able to hide his rifle and race down the stairs from the 6th floor to the 2nd floor lunchroom in 90 seconds without even breathing hard and then be questioned and released by an extremely suspicious police officer who had just raced into the building after hearing the shots, 8) fire a bolt-action rifle 3 times without having any gunsmoke residue on his cheek to be detected by a 'paraffin' test given hours later by the Dallas PD, and 9) a guy just happened to be pumping an opened umbrella up and down on a sunny day at the exact spot of the shooting, when the president came driving by.

If none of these things are a stretch, then you will find ABC's work highly persuasive.  Otherwise, you will start to wonder why ABC is cranking out this kind of stuff and...perhaps...even become a conspiracy nut.

Wasn't it the other way around at one point with Oswald's guilt  ""healing the nation"" because a conspiricy couldn't be handled by the American people.

The fall back theory is partially true in this film in that Washington was afraid of war and that is why they participated in the cover up. That was the plan.

It is good that his brother knows he is guilty.  That is good enough for me!  So much for the doctors statements at Parkland confirming two frontal shots.  And the Zapruder film which clearly shows the fatal shot.

With the Secret Service Stand Down Video available now, the bitter truth is plain to see.  Which  is that  the protection of the President was stopped that day.  You could even believe Oswald did it , but it wouldnt change the scene at the airport, or the Agents actions once the shots rang out.

In fact, while the producers have lined up a series of experts to support their opinions, they also cleverly avoid a number of unanswered questions.  These questions actually become more and more obvious as you view the piece.

Most damning is the computer animation of the assassination by a computer artist who proves that there was only one shooter through his brilliant production.  In a most dramatic fashion, this hack-for-hire declares, ""It's not even a single bullet theory.  It's a single bullet fact.""  To prove his point, he details the events frame-by-frame in the Zapruder film.  Only it's not the Zapruder film you're watching.  You're watching his computer rendition captioned with Zapruder frame numbers.  In this day in age, to create a computer simiulation as ""proof"" of anything is laughable.  Nothing is more easily manipulated than a computer image.

No.

I used to think that JFK's assassination was a conspiracy.  This documentary is what opened my eyes to the possibility that it wasn't.  It was hard to swallow, but this documentary did a great job.  As always - DO LOTS OF RESEARCH before you jump to conclusions.  Do not base your theories on Oliver Stone's movie JFK.  That is a Hollywood production, not a factual documentary.

The first time I saw this documentary, I was offended.  Then I realized that it was far more viable than a Hollywood film, and after asking around and doing some research, I changed my mind about the conspiracy theory.  Yes, there are still a few discrepencies over details, but we know for a fact that parts of the Warren Report are inaccurate, and the evidence is now 40 years old... so you must make the best decision based on what you know.

You conspiracy theorists are stubborn, so I understand the negative feedback on this documentary... but you can't really have an intelligent point of view if you discount or discredit anything that you disagree with.

recoil from that hit made his head lurch in a direction OPPOSITE

I see a lot of sneering condemnation of this documentary as ""propaganda"", ""ridiculous"", ""dishonest"", ""junk"", and ""GARBAGE"" (in caps no less), what I DON'T see a lot of is these negative reviewers challenging this documentary's evidence with any facts.  I just see a lot of visceral, emotional reaction.  It's pretty clear that these reviewers had their balloon popped and not only did not like it, they will not face up to it either.  The title of every one of those reviews ought to be: ""I know what I know; don't bother me with facts!""  On reviewer even states that he stopped watching less than halfway through the program.  Well how CAN his rebutal be an intelligent let alone informed one?

And those negative reviewers who do try to cite facts get them WRONG!  One, for example, starts the shots at Zapruder frame 210, giving only 5.6 seconds for the assassination.  They really began at frame 160, giving over 8 seconds.  Another talks about that the Warren Commission ""moving a wound up 5 to six inches"" in order to ""put this wound in the neck"", and also talks about moving Kennedy's head wound up ""not one, not two, but 4 full inches from the Eop at the base of the skull to the cowlick in the center of the head.""

!?!

I've seen the Kennedy autopsy photos.  You can see them for yourself at any number of websites that a google search will turn up in less than 3 seconds.  The clearly show a large wound at the top of JFK's skull, not at the base, and they also show a wound at the base of the president's neck, not the middle of his upper back where the CTs claim it is.  The same reviewer asks: ""...now ponder for a moment, do you think a neuromuscular reaction is stronger than a speeding bullet?""  As a matter of fact, yes.  Yes it is. The reviewer also seems to have forgotten a basic law of physics: for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.  If the impact of a bullet had enough force to hurl a human body about like a rag doll, the recoil of the gun firing that bullet would be equally savage, and would hurl the shooter backward with just as much force.  Shoot a rifle like the one Oswald fired, and you will experience no such level of recoil.  Shoot such a gun at an animal of roughly the same body mass as an average adult human male -- such as a good sized white tail deer buck, for example -- and you will very often see the animal jerk NOT AT ALL, and instead, just start running in reaction to the hit.  I know this from experience.  A tiny piece of lead, weighing no more than an ounce or two simply doesn't have the ability to shove over a hundred pounds around like nothing, not even when it's travelling at 2500 feet per second.  It just zips through, making a hole, and the violent jerk, if there is one, is the result of a neuromuscular spasm.  And this is particularly true if the head -- the bio-electric generator that sends electric impulses out to the muscles -- is the target that is zapped.

This documentary serves up a good healthy dose or reality.  A lot of people need to face it.  I never cease to marvel at how people believe that the CIA, the Mob, LBJ, the Castro regime, and/or some combination of any or all of the above carried off a plot to kill Kennedy without letting the cat out of the bag, and then, still more incredibly, the LBJ White House, the Supreme Court, the CIA, the FBI, the Dallas Police Department, as well as doctors, nurses, reporters, and any number of others ALL conspired after the fact to bury all evidence of this before it could reach the public, and in over 40 years, NO ONE among these hordes of people in the know EVER betrayed any part of the plot.

1985747,5,B0001BFDKU,"This ABC-TV News production originally aired on that television network in November of 2003, two days before the 40th anniversary of the assassination of America's 35th President, John F. Kennedy.

Most of the pro-conspiracy advocates will fail to find any redeeming qualities in a program like this one, a program that bases its conclusions on just the FACTS in the case, and not fanciful, would-be theories of hidden gunmen, faked photographs, and forged autopsy records, etc.

""Peter Jennings Reporting: The Kennedy Assassination -- Beyond Conspiracy"" dives head-first into the documented ""facts"" that we have, and presents a stylish and polished and completely acceptable documentary based on those facts (none of which has ever been proven to be inaccurate to the point of dismissal, including, of course, the highly-controversial ""Single-Bullet Theory"").

I like the way ABC presents the case in this program, pulling no punches along the way. It's obvious to them, as it is to me, that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone killer of JFK (and Dallas police officer J.D. Tippit as well) in 1963.

And, seeing as how every scrap of physical evidence in both the Kennedy and Tippit murder cases does indeed point in the direction of Lee Oswald having acted alone, I cannot fathom how so many individuals still seem to want to cling to the idea of conspiracy. And, no, I certainly do not believe for a single second that ALL of this large wealth of evidence against Oswald could have possibly been faked, fabricated from whole cloth, or otherwise tampered with, so as to implicate an innocent ""patsy"" named Lee H. Oswald. That notion, to me, is far more fanciful than anything the Warren Commission published in 1964.

With the aid of Mr. Dale K. Myers' very detailed 3-D models (which show that the ""SBT"" is far from a ""Lone Nut dream""), Peter Jennings and ABC-TV paint a convincing portrait of the way things really occurred on Elm Street in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963.

Mr. Myers' animations actually show that the Single-Bullet Theory is more than just a ""theory"" -- it's very likely the ONLY possible explanation to account for the wounding of JFK and Texas Governor John Connally. Because, without it, we would have another sort of ""Magic Bullet"" -- a bullet that enters Mr. Connally and completely disappears without a trace!

In actuality, without the SBT, the number of vanishing ""Magic Bullets"" isn't just a mere one -- it's at least THREE (and that number goes up to an even more ridiculous FOUR according to many CTers, who are of the opinion that Governor Connally was struck by two separate missiles to account for his wounds).

For, if the SBT is not the correct version of the wounding of Kennedy and Connally, then there simply MUST have been three (or four) different bullets which entered both men on November 22nd to cause the various wounds. And, to add to the incredibly-unbelievable nature of this silly pro-CT version of events, I guess we're supposed to swallow the oddball notion that TWO separate bullets (fired from two different guns) somehow BOTH failed to transit all the way through the body of President Kennedy, despite the known fact that not a single bone or hard surface was struck by either of these ""Magic CT Bullets"" during their time spent inside the back and neck of the President.

Does that CT scenario sound like a logical multi-missile alternative to the Single-Bullet Theory? Hardly. To the contrary, I'm always amazed when a CTer can put such nonsense on the table and do it with a straight face. I know I couldn't. I'd be compelled to burst out laughing at such unsupportable conspiracy-slanted tripe.

Plus, as mentioned, all of these bullets had to disappear into thin air in order to then be ""replaced"" by bullet #CE399 fired from Lee Oswald's rifle (which is the only bullet ever recovered from Parkland Hospital). It sure was a lucky day at Parkland for the ""Conspiracy Team"", huh?

Quite obviously, that multiple-bullet conspiratorial version of the SBT never could have happened in a million lifetimes. But, amazingly, scads of conspiracy theorists actually believe that it did occur.

There are many good-quality archival video clips utilized in this documentary, plus some new 2003 interviews featuring key players in the tragedy. But it's Dale Myers' 3-D mock-ups which really hit a bull's-eye here. 'Fascinating' is the best word for them, I would say.

I would have liked more of the Myers' animation shown within this compelling 2-hour program (88 minutes sans commercials), but unfortunately much of Mr. Myers' comprehensive work was not used for this ABC special. But there's still enough shown for the viewer to obviously know that Mr. Myers hasn't just slapped this 3-D computer model together overnight.  He has been working on this animation project for many years. And that level of research and detail comes through in the all-too-brief demonstration of his work on this program.

Additional facts and information regarding Dale Myers' 3-D computer models can be located at the following web address: [...]

Books, movies, television documentaries, and videos on the subject of the JFK assassination have been decidedly one-sided, favoring one conspiracy angle or another. But there are far too few pieces of material about that fateful Friday in Texas which focus attention on the idea that there was NO conspiracy, and that a lone oddball named Lee Harvey Oswald took a rifle with him to work on the morning of November 22nd, 1963, and fired three shots from a sixth-floor warehouse window, killing the President of the United States.

This documentary made me physically ill, moreso the further I contemplate the somewhat gullible and easily led nature of the average American citizen. I can honestly say I cannot remember seeing a less objective 'documentary' in my entire lifetime... Jennings decides to repeatedly use tactics such as saying things like: 'When Oswald shot Kennedy...', and 'when the police found the snipers hideout...', and entirely lets one of the main suspects off the hook with comments like 'Johnson was terrified the Russians were responsible'... absolutely pathetic.

There is simply no room for objectivity, rational thought, or a two-sided debate as far as Jennings is concerned, which I find stunning due to the fact that the vast majority of Americans think the Warren commission and the official gov't line is simply ridiculous. When one simply looks at the raw facts, minus all of the hyperbole and subjective ranting, it is simply not possible to believe that much larger forces were not only 'at play', but were the sole cause of what happened on that day. Oswald was 'proud' he killed Kennedy? Why does he repeatedly shout that hes being made a 'patsy'? I could spend hours picking apart this very poorly put together piece, but this is, of course, not the place...

A brilliant piece of propaganda, I will concede this much..  however, for anyone looking for intelligent reporting on one of the most important events in American history, I strongly suggest looking elsewhere, or at the very least balancing this horrific piece of work out with one of the more objective videos, one that at the very least takes into account the 'other side' (i.e. the factually supported view, and the view which the vast majority of Americans now hold).

""Everything pertaining to what's happening has never come to the surface. The world will never know the true facts, of what occurred, my motives. The people that had so much to gain and had such an ulterior motive for putting me in the position I'm in will never let the true facts come above board to the world."" - Jack Ruby

1985749,4,B0001BFDKU,"A presentation like this one has to be concise, as it is for air on broadcast television.  There is only so much time allowed.  Peter Jennings and his crew make the most of their time.  Aside from the qualifier, 'if you're an irredeemable conspiracy theorist..."", 'Beyond Conspiracy' puts to rest the haunting questions around JFK's assasination, some of them raised by Oliver Stone's movie in 1991, others raised by the House Select Committee on Assasinations in 1977.  Jennings notes that the scientists who introduced the police radio sound evidence to the committee would not be interviewed for this program.

  The highlight of 'Conspiracy' is the use of computer technology to debunk the 'grassy knoll' theory.  The technology takes the Zapruter film as a basis for a full-dimensional effect, putting the viewer in Dealey Plaza November of '63.  The technology shows convincingly, in my view, the fatal shots could not have come from the grassy knoll, but rather from the book depository, as the Warren Commission concluded.  The computer technology also debunks the so-called 'magic bullet' notion concocted by producers of the Stone movie.

  In addition to computer simulations, though, Jennings includes key interviews, one by a researcher who effectively shows Oswald was indeed quite capable of firing 3 shots in 8 seconds and hitting a target from less than 100 yards.  Background information on Oswald, including an interview with his brother show convincingly he acted alone.  Other interviews put to rest the notion that Oswald's assasination by Jack Ruby was a mob hit.

  I would suggest this video for anyone who still has questions about what really happened on Dealey Plaza November of '63.  Don't take the conspiracy theorists at face value.  Check this out for yourself and come to your own conclusion.",1127433600,11,1825,5.163822525597269
1985750,5,B0001BFDKU,"Having studied the Kennedy Assassination for over 15 years, I have come to the inevitable conclusion that Lee Oswald killed Kennedy by shooting three shots at him from the Texas Schoobook Depository.  This conclusion is not shared by a majority of americans, but then the majority of americans have not read extensively on the JFK assassination and have been fed conspiracy theories for 40 years!

Peter Jennings and ABC news have produced a fair and objective DVD stating the facts of the assassination and arriving at a logical conclusion.  Their main piece of evidence is a computer simulation that places the exact positions of Kennedy and Connelly at the time the shots rang out.  The positions are based on a meticulous study of the Abraham Zapruder film that depicts the entire assassination as it occurred.  The computer simulation proves the most controverial aspect of the assassination, that being the so-called ""Magic Bullet Theory"", where one bullet must account for Kennedy's throat wound and all of Connelly's numerous wounds.  Long considered impossible by critics, the magic bullet theory is proven here in the computer simulation.  Why the critics of the magic bullet theory got it wrong is because of faulty and inaccurate positioning of the two men in the limosine.

There is other conclusive evidence presented as well.  For instance, the angle of Kennedy and Connelly's wounds indicate being shot from behind and from an elevated position.  The simulation shows the killing shots could only have come from the upper floors of the southeast corner of the Schoolbook Depository.  Oswald's rifle was found on the 6th floor with his prints on it.  He worked at the depository and was last seen by co-workers on the 6th floor.  The autopsy on President Kennedy shows the wounds could only have come from behind and from an elevated position as well.

Conspiracy critics will not ""like"" this DVD because it supports the Warren Commission's findings, which critics have lambasted since 1965.  The major fault with conspiracy theorists is that they never fully deal with the extensive physical evidence that exists for the case.  They sweep it aside too quickly as it confounds their numerous pet conspiracy theories.  Unfortunately for them, the evidence has to be considered and cannot be swept aside so easily.  This is the strength of this DVD - that the evidence is carefully examined and considered.  From the evidence, only one logical conclusion can be drawn - that Lee Oswald killed Kennedy.

On the issue of whether Oswald was influenced by others in the assassination, we will never know the answer, for he took this information to the grave with him when he was shot by Jack Ruby, just a short 48 hours after Oswald killed JFK.  For me, this is the only unsolved mystery remaining in the assassination.

I believe that this is a very objective and logical presentation of the evidence of the very controversial JFK assassination.  I highly recommend it for its logical approach and conclusion.

Dale Myers & Gerald Posner are 2 reasons why this one of the best documentaries on the JFK assassination. The bad reviews for this dvd show how threatening the truth is to the conspiracy theorists.

There is no credible conspiracy theory about the JFK assassination that includes anything more than a trace of evidence.  However, there is mounds & mounds of evidence that shows the President was shot twice from behind by Lee Harvey Oswald.  This great Dvd covers much of that evidence.",1122163200,13,571,4.927083333333333
1985752,5,B0001BFDKU,"This is an excellently researched documentary studying a dark day in American history, one from which we will surely never fully recover.

Most remarkable about it is how it utilizes facts and modern science to fully debunk virtually every conspiracy theory.  It agrees that there were errors in the Warren Commission Report but after thoroughly reviewing ALL the evidence comes up with the same conclusion.

In contrast, conspiracy theorists (some of whom have submitted understandably scathing reviews of the program here) dismiss the Warren Commission overall except for the misinformation which might be used to support the possibility of a conspiracy. (Example -- they claim the Warren Report states that all the bullets were fired within six seconds; in actuality a review of the Zapruder film proves it took more than eight.) Some of the theorists even choose to embrace the Commission's errors as evidence in and of themselves of a conspiracy.

These people would gain incalculable respect if they could come up with one, even one, credible fact that would prove WHO they think killed Kennedy (""It was the Mafia! It was Castro! It was the CIA! It was the FBI! LBJ! Our ENTIRE government! Or, as Oliver Stone seemed to say, Hell, I don't know WHO it was, but you can bet it was at least ONE of the above."") Some paranoias, especially those embraced dearly for so many years, are held close to one's heart.

""Beyond Conspiracy"" cuts through all the speculation and misinformation and deals only with the facts.  It's mesmerizing...the 89 minutes fly by.  It's extremely well done and refreshing.",1117497600,15,1601,5.018867924528302

1985774,1,B0001BFDKU,A very short program that does not allow for differing views and which does not answer all of the questions. The problem is the lack of research and analysis of other theories. If you want a more extensive analysis from an authority on the subject read Fatal Hour by G. Robert Blakey which was originally published as The Plot to Kill the President in hardback.  He was the Chief Counsel and Staff Director on the House Select Committee on Assassinations which was convened in the late 70's to reexamine the assassination.

1985775,4,B0001BFDKU,"This is a good introduction to people who want to study what happened that day but it is far too short to do justice to all the issues involved.

Personally I don't believe that any serious person who has looked at all the evidence objectively could possibly believe that Oswald is innocent-his guilt is established beyond doubt.  Look at this very accurate digital reproduction of the Zapruder film and you'll see things that the conspiracy theorists NEVER show you-the TRUE relative positions of Kennedy and Connally and the tracking back of the shot to the 6th floor of the Depository.

But could there have been a conspiracy involving Oswald?  Certainly not on the level that people of Oliver Stone's ilk would have you believe, and just look at the odds of even a small conspiracy: Oswald was only working in the Depository for about 5 weeks before the assassination. He only got the job through the efforts of Ruth Paine, the woman with whom Oswald's wife Marina lived.  The motorcade route was only announced a couple of weeks before, and was planned by the Secret Service, fanatically loyal to Kennedy.  What are the absolutely incredible odds that a man involved in a conspiracy to kill the president would benefit from such a monumental bit of coincidental luck? Pretty much zero.

Aside from that, have a look at the quality of people who dismiss the conspiracy and those that support it. Oswald's own brother has absolutely no doubt. Only a real fanatic could think Gerald Ford dishonest or delusional, and he too is absolutely convinced. And many others the same, like Peter Jennings in this DVD. On the other side you have marginal people, people with chips on their shoulders or who see money to be made.  What a shame they manage to distort what is clearly a settled matter of history.

Unfortunately, it's going to take many, many other DVDs like this to make up for the vast ignorance about this case.",1101254400,15,1919,4.756024096385542
1985776,1,B0001BFDKU,"This program was a very poor attempt to show that Lee Harvey Oswald killed President Kennedy.  The ABC make a number of suppositions regarding the assassinations, including that Oswald fired all the shots.  This cannot be the case as a number of witnesses, not just 1 or 2, but at least 20-30, heard the second and third shots fired almost simultaneously.  We hear that at one stage Oswald was uneducated and simple, then he is smart and educated and writes in Russian.  Jack Ruby has no links to the Mafia, then suddenly does have links.  The program looks at the locality of Connally to Kennedy, which looks compelling on computer, they did not except for 5 minutes look at the possibility of the headshot coming from the grassy knoll.  What about testimonies of people at the scene, don't these people count.  This program relies totally on the authenticity of a film, (Zapruder film), which the government owns, and with today's technology, one can now make film do anything.  This program is weak, as it does not show any true autopsy photos, no eye witness accounts, apart from those pro WC and lacks depth in research to get to the true meaning.  The program tries to place the blame squarely on Cuba, stating that the Kennedy's were obsessed with Castro.  If they were so obsessed with Castro why didn't they send air support for the Bay of Pigs, why didn't thery invade during the Cuban missile crisis.  Anyone who does a bit of research will find that JFK signed a memorandum which severely limited the powers of the CIA after the B of P.  Don't you think the CIA would be a little pissed? Don't get caught up with who did it, but why?  This case has so much depth it cannot be covered by a 2 hour program.  When you understand the why, the who becomes obvious.  A very good program to watch is the Men who killed Kennedy, it covers the major angles in depth and gives much more than the window dressing of this program.",1101254400,16,1930,4.521613832853026
1985777,5,B0001BFDKU,"Having been an avid fan of the late Bill Hicks, I was certainly in the conspiracy-theory camp of thinking concerning the JFK assassination, and have read a number of volumes on this event. However, the CG recreation of Mr Myers certainly gave me pause for thought. His analysis and recreation of the vehcles, people and timeline of the event were top class and not once relied on heresay or fudged data.

After seeing the relative positions of Kennedy and Connelly in the limo (why have pro-conspiracy theorists NEVER depicted this? In fact they seem only too willing to suggest the falsehood that they were sitting one behind the other), along with the reactions of both JFK and Connelly to the shots, make it fairly obvious that there WAS a shot from the Book Depository and that it struck both JFK and the senator at the same time. And the trajectory of that non-fatal bullet convincingly shows the 'sniper's nest' to be the source of at least one shot.

The fatal shot obviously came from behind. Anyone who thinks otherwise obviously knows nothing about physics - let alone ballistics. JFK's chin was pressed to his chest just prior to the shot... it couldn't go any further forward and could only rebound... that isn't hearsay - it's there in the footage.

But i guess the best test for those still obsessed with conspiracy is this: go and build an accurate 3D computer model of Dealey Plaza, the vehicles and individuals invloved, input all the FACTS known and see whether you get a trajectory to the grassy knoll....

As for me i still don't know whether Oswald was the only one invloved in the assassination or if there was a wider conspiracy (in fact i believe the programme didn't preclude the possibility of conspiracy) but a shot was definitely fired from the 6th floor of the depository, and the shot was well within Oswald's capabilities... in fact as a former 7.62 shooter myself, I'd say that an 80yd shot at a man-sized object moving in line with the shooter is well within the capabilities of any reasonably competant big bore target shooter... at the age of 16 i certainly regularly used to hit head-sized targets at 300 and 500 yds... with iron sights.",1101081600,13,2173,4.7105263157894735

The odds that they are all wrong is basically about less than zero. Now, factor in all the RR Workers & closest eyewitnesses who said JFK was shot from the front and the many peope that have come forward that are either ignored, or worse...well..anybody that tells you Oswald acted alone is either a deliberate liar, or unaware of the above and comfortable with the big lie.

1985779,5,B0001BFDKU,"There are many problems with a conspiracy theory in this case. Firstly, is the number of people that would have to have been involved...literally countless amounts. And yet all the people who come forward and say they were part of this conspiracy are always easily refuted. Many were no where near where they say they were, some have changed their stories over the years to fit the current conspiracy, and still others are just attention seekers looking for their place in history and willing to say anything to achieve that. Another problem is that there is this idea that if someone covers something up, it is automatically because there is a vast conspiracy. I don't know about you guys, but I try to cover my own ass when I mess up. I do it frequently and yet I have never been part of a vast right wing or left wing conspiracy.
People who cling onto this conspiracy crap really need to come up with a clear and concise argument. None of this crap about an Oswald clone or someone stealing the body of Kennedy. The problem is that there is no possible way a conspiracy happened at the level that has been too often reported. The idea that makes the most sense is that Oswald acted alone. If Reagan's assassin had been successful and then someone had killed him, there would be all the same BS stories about how there was a vast conspiracy against Reagan. Because we have the luxury of a living would-be assassin, we all know he was a wacko...just like Oswald. Some weird disturbed lonely kid who wanted attention. Is it THAT crazy to think that Kennedy was killed by a loser? Obviously there are people who try to distort history and say all this BS about Kennedy getting out of Vietnam. Earth to idiots!!! He got us in Vietnam in the first place. Now I'm not saying he was a bad president, but he really wasn't everything he is blown up to be nowadays. He was not starting a revolution. It wasn't because of civil rights. He was a moderate president!!! It was because some wacko, with American military training, decided to kill an American president.",1094428800,10,2056,4.544474393530997
1985780,1,B0001BFDKU,"First, let me thank those who reacted negatively to ABC's shameless and vapid piece of propaganda regarding the Kennedy assassination. Repeating what one reviewer noted, ABC and especially Peter Jennings know little about this tragic event that changed our history. Let me first zero in on the real culprit of this alleged presentation: Gerald Posner. a total fraud as a historian and a researcher. I read most of the first edition of ""Case Closed"". His explanation of the untimely and mysterious deaths of witnesses connected to the events of JFK's assassination is uninformed and shallow. 10 years ago CBS and Dan Rather also used Posner's book to indisputably claim that Oswald was the lone gunman and that no conspiracy occured. Their special was an almost duplicate of the crap that ABC tried to float as conclusive. The ABC report was made even more ludicrous by using the testimony of Jack Ruby's rabbi to confirm that he  ""really"" was disturbed by JFK's death and...oh not an organized crime figure for the Dallas/Chicage mob. I believe Oswald's brother offered him up as  the lone assassin. Give me a break!! These embarassingly lame interviews coupled with Posner's unctuous and arrogant certainty, and Dale Myers bag of digitalized visual tricks to prove the single bullet theory were almost the entire show; no other point of view was offered. There was no mention of the remarkable,even if somewhat flawed series: ""The Men Who Killed Kennedy"" produced by Bill Kurtis and Nigel Turner (which I believe is still being updated) Finally, consider this; Gerald Posner's bookjacket bio claims he was a former Wall Street attorney. It strikes me that a person like him has much to gain by supporting the ""system""  rationlizing that a conspiracy just could not happen in our political system. There is a superior attitude that surrounds people like Posner, Robert Blakely,etc and other critics of those who argue that a conspiracy took place in Dallas. They infer that conspiracy advocates are the same crackpots who chase UFO sightings around the world. Based on my own reading of about 20 book and as many articles on the Kennedy assasination, there seems to be an notable preponderance of evidence that JFK's death was a consequence of a complex conspiracy and then later a truculent coverup possibly to bury not only Oswald's murky past but those who somehow used him as part of the overall plan. In 1963, the disclosure of the U.S. government's connection to organized crime figures, ""black op"" operations,and political assassination would have seemed incredible to a  naive American public. Considering the lies, distortions and manipulation of the facts that we now witness almost daily to maintain the imperatives of global capitalism , the possibility of a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy seems more than the fantasy of overwrought imaginations, or the isolated act of a lone psychopathic gunmen",1089936000,20,2914,5.10272536687631
1985781,5,B0001BFDKU,"Wow! Just below there are some very paranoid reactions to this truthful documentary,but keep going to other reviews for some more informative good comments on it.
One negative comment from ""a viewer"" disagrees by claiming that shots from the back would have driven Kennedy forward. Unfortunately,President Kennedy was wearing a brace for his bad back and this is why he didn't go forward when shot. It's a pity that some of those vociforous and abusive conspiracy theorist don't get all the facts.
This documentary has interviews with Lee Harvey Oswald's brother and he states that he believes Oswald did it. There are interviews with Russian people that knew Oswald and people that knew Jack Ruby. Oswald's scoring records from his army days are produced that show he was a very good shot over 200 yards with scores of 48 and 49 out of 50. The distance between Oswald and Kennedy was only 60 yards. There is computer evidence presented that shows how the assassination by Oswald was achieved as well as a statement by director Oliver Stone about why he falsified facts in his movie JFK(""dramatic licence"" he says). Unfortunately there are people that think his fictional account is the truth. This documentary reveals the defects in the JFK film,like the fact that Jim Garrison didn't even give the final summation in the court case(his subbordinates did). The line ""let the truth be known or the heavens fall"" is straightout fantasy from a Hollywood writer. Jim wasn't even there on that final court day,he was in his office.

Aside from that, I think this documentary is about 99.9% one sided. I've seen many other documentaries talking of JFK's murder and they've all had an almost equal balance of people who were either pro or anti-conspiracy being featured in the documentary. Peter Jennings was a journalist who I had great respect for even after this documentary aired. Just like everyone else in the world, he wasn't perfect. However, when dealing with something like this, I think he should have stood up and said; ""We don't have all the facts here but we will present to you what is available to us, the public."" Basically, this documentary concludes that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assassin. Now to be fair unlike this documentary, they do have a very small amount of people in the documentary who are pro-conspiracy. And Peter Jennings does admit that most of America still have a hard time believing that Oswald was the lone assassin. Still, I think this documentary presents facts that are fabricated to make sense to us. There are three parts in this documentary that make me want to throw up. The first one is the computer generated footage of the shooting and that they claim to copy every movement that Kennedy and Conley made while they were getting shot at. And where the car was when the fatal head shot occurred. The second was when the old man (I forgot his name) showed us how Oswald shot three bullets in only six seconds. An old man who's strength is weaker than all the young, strong, military men who tried to act out what Oswald allegedly did and they all failed yet an old man succeeded? The third is when Jennings analyses Oliver Stone's movie when talking about ""Back and to the left."" Jennings; ""Bodies struck by bullets sometimes go forward and sometimes backward."" Huh, YEAH! If something is getting shot from the front, it will go backward and if it's from the back, it will go...FORWARD!!! It's physics. Look at it this way; if someone were to push someone from the front, would they go backward or forward? It's not just physics, it's logic unlike this documentary.",1356566400,,2198,4.682170542635659
