You need to watch this movie. Seriously. BOB is not silent in this film, but Jay is.",1440979200,,259,4.354166666666667

5795836,3,B00DFBVJVK,"surprisingly simple and funny. Yeah it's somewhat stupid, but it's the simplicity of Jason Mewes' character that makes it so funny. Well that and the horrific and inhumane deaths, predetermined by whatever is around and does the most bloody damage it seems. All for the love and vengeance of a beloved pet. As ridiculous as this movie is, it's all about a good time. I would think it would have to be, and not taking yourself to seriously, let loose once in awhile and have fun.",1440806400,,478,4.569767441860465
5795837,3,B00DFBVJVK,Watchable but forgettable. The only thing that really keeps it going at all is sheer quirkiness. I can't fathom why anybody would give this one more than three stars. There are definitely better horror comedies out there than this one.,1440374400,,235,4.9

5795839,4,B00DFBVJVK,"If you're looking for a film that you can give a long-winded, philosophical review on the acting, production values and realism, you need to get off this train and go see Les Miserables.  This movie is purely for a fun night at home with chips, beef jerky, beer, scotch and perhaps some curried goat stew.  A typical revenge flick with another in a long line of dim-witted slashers, but I say that in high praise.  This was movie was a blast.  A nice bit of nudity, a Russian girl on girl scene, computer generated blood and gore and of course, the great Jason Mewes.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the death scenes were more fun in the beginning then towards the end.  A totally hokey, B-horror film, that is definitely worth a watch.",1388880000,,750,4.398550724637682
5795840,5,B00DFBVJVK,"Jason Mewes plays a simple farm boy who loves goats (just how much we're never quite sure). After he quickly takes care of his abusive dad and lesbian step moms (!?!?) he lands a job on a film set. His pet winds up on the dinner table by mistake. That's when he goes on a goat avenging rampage. This is more comedy than anything. If you go in expecting pure horror you'll be disappointed. Some of the comedy actually made me laugh out loud. The violence is computer and not very realistic, but that didn't take away from the fun. If you know what you're getting into before you pop in the dvd i think you'll have a blast with this movie.",1380672000,7,637,4.229508196721311

5795887,2,B00DFBVJVK,"If you're looking for something totally mindless and stupid, this is your movie. It's not horror.  It attempts comedy and in some instances, it succeeds. The plot is simple.  A partially mute man has an (unnatural?) relationship with his pet goats.  I say partially mute because he can name the devices he uses to kill.  This ""movie"" gets started by the mute man watching two lesbians in action and getting caught by his father. His father makes an attempt at punishment, but can't catch him.  So he kills one of his son's goats.  Bad move, dad. Just when you think it couldn't get worse, we get a midget, sorry, little person as sheriff and a big black man as his deputy.  With the confederate flags, you can imagine the racist dialog.  And there's a budding Lois Lane and a movie being shot as the intrepid police force and Lois Lane attempt to resolve the murders at the farm.  Guess who gets a job on the movie set?  With his other pet goat.  The fun gets restarted when the Jamaican, no Trinidad cook catches the goat eating the garbage.  The next meal?  Goat sandwiches.  But the cook gets caught by the mute when he sees the goat head on the counter. Murder and very bad CGI ensues as the mute goes on a rampage.  Do the police solve the crime?  Does anyone escape? Are you sure you want to waste your time finding out?  Of the 3 bad Amazon movies I watched this weekend, this qualifies as the Amazon Stinker of the Week award.  Amazon, you need to give anyone who watches this crap a free subscription. It doesn't work as satire either.  Anyone who compared this to the Zucker's ""Airplane"" is either deranged or helped make this crap.",1441584000,3,1642,4.449664429530201

5795889,5,B00DFBVJVK,"This is highlariously funny film that left the dumbed down and stupid population clueless regarding its parody within a parody.!  People who missed the point of this film are too inane themselves to catch all of the innuendo by the script writers about the film within a film and how poor the quality of most monster/alien/slasher films are these days.  This is a take-off of all of those genre films and the midget/dwarf is brilliant!  Beaucoup applause for this rare and genius Mel Brooks style humor!  Keep up the good werks mi amigos!  Better than the Wayan's films or those of the Zucker Bros too!  Hope your troupe makes more.  The Viet Nam Vets ball-cap was not missed either for its sense of ironic humor ~ over the top, boys!",1441238400,,734,4.6

8592804,2,B00DFBVJVK,"I didn't have high expectations for this movie in the first place. After a stressful night at work, I just want to watch something ridiculous or ridiculously funny. This movie was the the former . So if you want to be truly entertained then skip this one.",1469664000,,255,4.446808510638298
8592805,4,B00DFBVJVK,"This is what a Troma film tries to be, but fails to do so 90 % of the time.

Ridiculous, without going too far. This isn't a Troma film, by the way. Fans of Jason
Mewes will be disappointed, because he contributes nothing to the film, other
than being the bad guy. He has short hair, lol.

Worth a look. A lot of the humor worked for me. The Sheriff steals the show.
Not for everyone.",1462320000,,384,4.0394736842105265
8592806,4,B00DFBVJVK,"this movie was much better than i thought it would be. Mewes doesn't talk much, but it is still pretty good. this movie is just fun to watch. there are some good characters in this movie. my favorite is the midget sheriff. this dude was funny as hell. some good old fashioned bloody killing complements the comedy aspect perfectly. this is a must watch.",1452124800,,353,4.53125

8592811,5,B00DFBVJVK,Every so often you click on a flick and it turns out to be a really good movie.  This is one of those gems that will leave you waiting for Part 2. Its goofy at times but not goofy enough to derail certain scenes and instead adds to the craziness of the movie. The actors are actually decent and this includes the awesome goats.,1443398400,,327,4.109375
