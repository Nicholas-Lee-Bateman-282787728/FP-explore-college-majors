8498690,5,B006IGO93E,"This DVD is great for someone like me that can play guitar because it shows you several different angles of the guitar as the guy is teaching you the songs. Each song has a video lesson where the professional guitar teacher teaches you how to play the song. And what I mean by that is that the teacher actually tells you what tuning the song is played in, he also tells you what blues scales to practice and learn so you can play this song, he then runs through the song showing how it is played, and pretty much everything you need to know to understand how to play the song. And ofcourse, he tells a little history behind each song and tells when each song was released. And after you watch the lesson video there are actually several different angles that you can watch the guy playing the song while at the bottom the tabs to every note in the song are popping up on the screen as the song is being played. This is perfect because it has a lesson of each song, and this DVD allows you to play along with each song as the teacher is playing the song, so you can try and keep up with him! Great, great video. The songs covered on this DVD are 1) Back in the Saddle 2) Draw The Line 3) Dream On 4) Last Child 5) Mama Kin 6) Same Old Song and Dance 7) Sweet Emotion 8) Walk This Way",1380931200,3,1282,4.071146245059288
