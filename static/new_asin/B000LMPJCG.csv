8162224,3,B000LMPJCG,"In this 1991 movie we have morality play about ethics and values of loyalty and heart vs money accumulation. A man, though married and with a son, marries another woman for her money. First wife tells him to go but gives him the son as she believes it would be too hard for a son growing up with just a mother and without his father's name in their society. Son (Aamir Khan) grows up honorable like Mum but father continues to focus on wealth accumulation. The son falls in love with a newcomer to his college (Neelam) and through ups and downs claims her heart. Then her guardian refuses the marriage as he fears son may dump this wife as Dad did (though son didn't know anything about this till then) and Dad also says he'll disinherit the son if he chooses the girl. Coincidentally, though he thought Mum dead she is principal at his College...
While this is a predictable and average college romance Aamir adds sparkle to make it a decent one. I find the music of this period generally not to my taste and a bit too strings and Ho-Hum, it's OK and the movie opens with a full-of-life song that strangely resembled `La Bamba'! The film quality is a bit grainy and the sound a bit echoing in parts as it is aging a bit but it wasn't too much of a problem.
So- a plot with no surprises but Aamir is very watchable. Elsewhere on the Net it scores about average.",1247011200,,1361,4.3203125
