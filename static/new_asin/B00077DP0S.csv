8045568,2,B00077DP0S,"There are 2 things wrong with this title. 1:Charlie Brown isn't the main focus of the story,its Linus and 2:They NEVER go to the Super Bowl. Its a total ripoff. The moral is treated like an afterthought in this film. The animal football games are not only distracting and serve no purpose but the animation in these games are repetitve and the games themselfs are flop-sided with the birds winning by a large margin and the opposing team scoreless but however,they are still are fun to watch. The animation and some of the jokes are not great but pretty good. The romance between Linus & Melody is predictable,bland & phoned in a mile away. The cast are still themselfs and still fun to watch them do the things they do best. Overall,not the best tv movie but theres still a curtin joy coming from this film. Its a guilty pleasure to say the least. I give this film a 2 out of 10.",1328313600,,880,4.404907975460123
8045569,5,B00077DP0S,We ordered this video after my son watched it at school.  It is so funny watching Snoopy and Woodstock.  We watched it this year as our fav. Pro football team was in the Super Bowl- the Steelers!!,1300060800,,196,4.27027027027027
8045570,5,B00077DP0S,"I have owned this video for 7 or 8 years. That said, it still works fine, and I watched it every day when I fist got it. Now I treat it like a Peanuts special and watch it around the Super Bowl. They really should rerelease this on DVD because the VHS is hard to find. I would buy a new one from the sellers here. They charge about $14 for them and that is about the price of any new Peanuts VHS/DVD.",1125273600,2,400,3.8313253012048194
8045571,3,B00077DP0S,"This tape has its creative funny moments but, speaking as a big fan of Peanuts, it is not one of their best. It appears to have been a 1993 promotional release involving an oil company and possibly the NFL; the plot and production values are not at the level of the beloved Peanuts specials we all know.",1116633600,3,303,4.333333333333333
