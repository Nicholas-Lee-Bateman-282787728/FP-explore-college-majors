8664258,2,B00L89VJCU,"Talky and overlong crime drama follows a police detective named Rawley Niner who is suspended and about to be put on trial for throwing a suspect out of a third story window.  While driving a nurse friend home they stop as a girl stumbles into the street and then collapses.  The injured teen has a thick cut that is bleeding on her forehead and appears to be in a severe state of shock--it turns out her entire family was murdered at her sister's birthday party but she was passed out in the bathroom when it happened and was able to run away while the bodies were being buried in the backyard.  What exactly would be the point of burying the bodies of a murdered family in their own yard when the police are going to look there first thing anyway as soon as the family is reported missing?  Why not just drag all the bodies to the basement?  In any case when Niner's captain arrives on the scene he is none to happy to see his suspended detective and tells him to disappear immediately and stay the hell out of the case.

What Niner aspires to be is obvious--a James Ellroy or David Ayers style crime drama filled with twists, corruption and double-crosses--the ambition to make something of quality is unmistakeably present.  Ultimately the problem with Niner is the same one people who tried to do very low budget Quentin Tarantino knock-offs in the 90's ran into--if you're going to film a dialogue heavy script then you actually need actors who can handle all of that dialogue--if someone filmed Reservoir Dogs word for word without changing a thing with a cast that can barely act guess what?  It would suck even with the excellent script.

After watching the movie I can't honestly tell if the script for Niner was good or not and it ultimately doesn't matter because the poor casting and uneven acting would have killed Niner no matter what.  Some of the actors can act but seem completely miscast--during the opening exchange in an automobile between the cop and a nurse he is driving home their dialogue isn't actually bad but it's impossible to ignore the fact that neither of these actors would be cast if this were a low budget Hollywood film or an indie with enough money to attract an experienced and talented cast--David Gales doesn't look anything like a cop on the edge--he looks like a realtor who possibly moonlights on open mic night as a standup comic.  The actress playing the nurse is strikingly unattractive with the kind of face that might be used to good effect in a John Waters or David Lynch movie but most definitely not in anything intended to be mainstream.

The actors in Niner can basically be broken down into two categories--the ones who look right for their parts but are pretty lousy actors and the ones who appear to be miscast but actually have fairly competent acting skills.  Ultimately Niner is littered with too many awkward and amateurish performances for any of the drama to work.  It's also a serious slog to sit through--a talky 115 minute length crime drama with virtually no action filled with actors that are incapable of bringing the material to life.  The tech credits are generally slick and professional enough but it keeps coming back to the cast--director Grant Pichla did not have actors that could make this material work and should have filmed something that wasn't 99% dialogue and heavily dependent on acting skill--a low budget horror movie or action film would be obvious choices.  Niner never had a chance which is a shame because it's easy to picture Ethan Hawke in the role of Rawley Niner with a competent supporting cast and the movie becomes much more watchable, possibly even good.  Instead Niner feels like possibly the world's longest student film.",1433116800,,3722,4.701538461538462

I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie was, with high production values , feels like a true hollywood movie.  Great job to crew & cast!",1405296000,,288,4.607843137254902
