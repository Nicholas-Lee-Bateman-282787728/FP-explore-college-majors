8627766,1,B00GV8B17G,"The dvd is on ""The Film Detective"" label and is called a ""restored"" version of this wonderful Lum And Abner film.  There is no restoration whatever.  Just the same old reel cue marks, scratches, and jumpy picture.  Additionally, this is a dvd-r (made on demand) with some pixilating of the picture.",1518393600,,298,4.803921568627451
8627767,5,B00GV8B17G,"Here is a triple feature DVD which gives us commentary from historian Rod Paschal. The result is a journey back in time to when society had so much confusion going on. I watched this DVD with my grandfather and he could tell so many stories of that period in history. Truly this gives an amazing historical perspective of WW II. (By the way-if you plan to be a Jeopardy contestant, watch this DVD first, then go on the show and you will win big!!) 5 stars!!",1395792000,5,457,4.325581395348837
