5058574,3,B0076YFJJA,"Likely if the viewer is a soccer fan and already familiar with the 1958 tragic airplane accident that resulted in the loss of lives of the majority of the Internationally famous soccer team during a blighted takeoff in Munich, this film will be profoundly affecting. Certainly the `based on true events' aspect of this film makes it affecting, especially the manner in which the citizens of Manchester responded to the deaths of their heroes and came to the fore with support for their beloved winning team. But as written by Chris Chibnall and directed by James Strong, UNITED relies too heavily on established information and fails to develop the characters portrayed by the actors to the point that the non-soccer fan audience has a difficult time identifying with the members of the team and the film plods along in a maudlin, saccharine manner that without some history of the boys on the team becomes a bit trying to watch.

But as the PR states, `United is based on the true story of Manchester United's legendary ""Busby Babes"", the youngest side ever to win the Football League and the 1958 Munich Air Crash that claimed eight of the their number. The film draws on first-hand interviews with the survivors and their families to tell the inspirational story of a team and community overcoming terrible tragedy.

The few team members who are allowed personality are portrayed by Sam Clafin as Duncan, Thomas Howes as the pipe smoking Mark, and Jack O'Connell as the newest member of the team Bobby (good in the first half, maudlin and weak in the second half).  The spokesman for the team is owner Matt Busby (Dougray Scott) - the team is known as Busby's Babes - and the redoubtable champion team leader Jimmy Murphy is well portrayed by David Tennant.  The hard-nosed athletic commissioner Alan Hardaker is portrayed by Neil Dudgeon.  The rest of the cat is fine but their characters are so ill-defined that it is difficult to remember who they are.

Undoubtedly a sad but true story and also one of overcoming odds, but as a film for the general public without soccer connections, it is a poorly conceived movie. Grady Harp, June 12",1339200000,4,2142,4.791327913279133
5058575,2,B0076YFJJA,"Rented UNITED this evening and found it didn't fit my requirements for a 5-star movie.  The movie moves very slowly.  The actors were very good, however the heavy British dialect made it just as hard to understand.

For some reason I was led to believe that UNITED was a family movie, on this I would have to disagree.  Thankfully my 11 year old found it to be very boring.  When I caught a man yelling in despair ""We're going to get ourselves (flocking) killed here"" (insert actual foul F-word) and saw the burnt, charred, and bloody crash victims, I said it was time for bed.  This was 40 minutes into the movie.  The movie runs approx 1 hour 40 minutes. I would have to believe the images of this accident would frighten a young child and lead them to question any future plans to fly in an airplane.

I continued to watch after the young eyes were alseep and found that the movie was just as boring and slow moving after the crash as it was before.  The movie was hard to follow and just did not make quite the impact I had expected based on the one and only 5-star review it had received.

I cannot recommend this movie to families based on the frightening images and brief, but strong, language.",1338595200,,1201,4.36936936936937
5058576,5,B0076YFJJA,"Aired in the UK in 2011, this is based upon the Munich air disaster of 1958 which virtually wiped out the young Manchester United soccer team the ""Busby Babes"" , so named because of their inspirational manager, Matt Busby, and their young age. David Tennant's performance is a 'tour de force' and the whole programme is an emotional roller coaster, from the despair of the disaster to the inspirational way Tennant's character, Jimmy Murphy, sets about recruiting and building a side to complete the season.

5058648,4,B0076YFJJA,"I can remember the original tragedy and the devastating effect it had on football (soccer) fans around the world. I can also remember that 1958 Cup Final, when we all willed them to win, and they failed. But, as the Jimmy Murphy character says in the film, the fact that they got to Wembley Stadium at all constituted a win. Sir Bobby Charlton (as he now is) and Northern Ireland goalkeeper Harry Gregg (one of the heroes of the crash, rescuing people from the wreckage) are, I believe, now the only survivors of Munich who remain with us.

Even if you're not a soccer fan, I think you will like this magnificent story, of how a fresh young team was virtually wiped out, and how coach Jimmy Murphy brought it back. It's seen principally through the eyes of Murphy and a very young Bobby Charlton (we all tend to forget that he had lots of hair back then!). It's a delightful recapture of a bygone age, when everyone (players included) smoked and Bobby Charlton being told never to tell girls that he was a professional footballer (""15 a week? Career over at 40, if you're lucky? What girl wants prospects like that? Tell them you're a carpenter or a plumber!"")

Negatives? Really only the portrayal of Sir Matt Busby, who looks more like a Chicago gangster than the track-suited manager he actually was (apparently the Busby family was most upset by this portrayal). And perhaps ""the angels of Munich"" as the surgical team of Prof. Dr. Georg Maurer became known, could have been given more prominence. Matt Busby was twice given the Last Rites, but they brought him back. (Prof. Maurer was invited to Buckingham Palace and received an honorary CBE from the Queen).

The rest is pretty well spot on, with Bobby completely losing his head in the Munich hospital and having to be sedated, and Harry's immortal exclamation, ""I'm going to die in Germany and I can't even speak the #*@?!!&?!! language!""

A poignant, moving film.",1403049600,,1923,4.680473372781065

5058651,5,B0076YFJJA,"The title and the DVD cover do not do this film justice. It is about a sports team (football, I think. Sorry, not really a sports fan.) that is excellent but highly underrated by the ""league"" of that time. The Manchester United has an ""away"" game scheduled too close to a ""home"" game and the ""league"" forces them to show anyway or forfeit.  The league refuses to allow the team to reschedule the game. United plays the away game, but in order to get back in time to play the home game the team must fly through some really rough weather. I don't want to give any more of the story away, but you might want to have some Kleenex nearby. Great movie!",1379030400,,647,4.260162601626016
5058652,5,B0076YFJJA,"This is an infamous story of the loss by air accident of a large portion of the Manchester United football team during a time, the mid-1950s - following WWII but well before the uptick in interest in English Premier League football (soccer) which has grown steadily each decade along with the advent of television coverage from the 1960s to today's sophisticated, global array of sport-specific networks.
  Well told, with steady pacing that belies the modern maxim of Hollywood filmmaking that you cannot take the time to get to know a large cast of characters. It combines simplicity and clarity with technical proficiency and good old fashioned storytelling to convey a complex and challenging situation.
  If you are unaware and uninitiated into the world of 1950s professional football in England, you will still be able to enjoy the film. Mostly because it is told through its characters, and handled with sensitivity to the delicacy of the moment - careful not to turn it into an overly-flogged hero worship film yet also employing painstaking efforts to capture a time, and a city community that while far to the North of its nation's capitol of London, nonetheless had its key place in British society.
  There will be some for whom the film falls short in either direction - too slow without not enough dramatics on one hand, too detailed in showing the effects of the crash on the other. For me the nuances are well served, especially within the lead characters, as they put their lives back together, and as the love of the game gets to rise again in each individual, each in their own way, and each with a unique place and role in the overarching story of a community coming back together. It's a story told without affectation.
  We in the Americas revere English football and the qualities of those Brits intimate with the game, far beyond their accent, yet sometimes too forgiving of their technical deficiences - they may have invented the game (codified it through the FA, England's organizing body, which the international governing body, FIFA, has mostly adopted) but they have rarely dominated it on the world stage. (Their one World Cup victory itself is rife with controversy, in 1966 on home soil.) The chief English contribution to the game remains a healthy balance of passion with a solid dose of reality, a respect for the game and all its participants. A bit ironic as the English style had been known to be a brutal one. This film gives a good foundation to understanding the place the game holds within the English psyche (and heart) by focusing on this one moment in time and how they responded as human beings at that particular time.
In terms of catching English football at this moment of football history, it's worthwhile to note that one fulcrum of the story revolves around the emerging European club competition which is currently reflected in the popularity of UEFA Champions League action - the universally recognized pinnacle for football clubs. (The club World Cup competition brings in several other regional champions in a quasi-tourney in Japan each year but the format highly favors the Europe representative. It has yet to truly take hold.)
  This film is also a good precursor, and companion to, the 2009 Michael Sheen film, The Damned United, that focuses on Brian Clough, a notorioius EPL coach from the decade that follows the one in this film. Though quite different in tone and delivery, it too captures an era of football, and in the background you sense and see the game as it evolves. Both movies are English productions.
  United receives top marks here because it fully achieves what it sets out to be, and is an ideal DVD for home viewing, as well as an important volume in any collection with a soccer theme. There's a reason it is often placed in the top 10 of soccer/football movies. Enjoy!",1376956800,2,3853,4.830045523520486

5058655,4,B0076YFJJA,"This story is loosely based on a true happening.  In 1958, the Manchester United soccer team played a match in a European competition.  On the flight home, the plane stopped in Munich
 to refuel.  The winter weather aborted 2 takeoff attempts, on the third the plane never got of the ground, crashing and burning off the runway.  Several people died, including 8 young team members and injuring several others.  Most of this movie is about the aftermath, and what the staff and players did (and coped with) afterwards.  It is not a ""happy feeling"" movie for the most part. And if you cannot understand the accents of the English/Scottish charactors, you will lose out on some of the dialog.

This movie begins with that event and tells the story of rebuilding a club whose key leaders, players, and fans were all shaken to their core. Coach Busby had to rebuild with only 7 of his squad. Among those who survived was Bobby Charlton, a young United star. The movie focuses a lot on Bobby's struggle with whether or not to play again and the broader effort by Busby to recruit a new team. You see the great leadership of Busby and the resilience of Charlton, the goalkeeper Harry Gregg and other survivors, in the rebuilding effort. It's a fantastic story. As a United fan, I was delighted to see how this event shaped the resilience, strength, confidence, and work ethic that exists at the club today.",1365724800,,878,4.598726114649682

Their is a very small amount of actual socccer in this movie. It is more about the emotional and phyisical effects of the 1958 plane crash that killed most of the very young Manchester United team. This movie is very comparable to the American ""We are Marshall"" story. The acting from David Tennant and Jack O'Donnell is over whelming. David Tennant's portrayal of Couch Jimmy Murphy, who has to bury his dead boys, and get his injured players back to England and then replace his team in less than two weeks to fulfill team obligations is just extraordinary.

""United""
(BBC/Sreen Media, 2012)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This quiet, contemplative film unravels one of the most remarkable success stories in British sports history, when the ascendant  1958 Manchester United football team suffered a devastating tragedy -- a travel accident that killed over half their lineup -- and came back to meet their next matches and make it to the national final with a new group of mostly amateur players.

Some soccer fans may find it disappointing that the film shows very little simulated on-field competition (only a few grainy clips of the actual team in old newsreels) but instead concentrates on the players in the own lives, off the field. What fans may find fascinating is the portrayal of European soccer at a crossroads, with the Manchester team controversially traveling to the Continent to take part in the newly-formed European Cup competition, establishing English soccer as a global force to be reckoned with. The film is beautifully shot and richly textured both visually and emotionally. You don't have to be a sports fan to be swept up by this one -- or amazed by the improbable heroism of the team and its supporters. Recommended! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1350259200,,1422,6.14070351758794
5058664,3,B0076YFJJA,"First, let me tell you about the DVD jacket of ""United,"" a made-for-TV film (but theatrically released outside UK), broadcast on 24 April 2011 on BBC. The jacket is misleading. The film is about ""Munich air disaster"" in 1958, an airplane crash that took the lives of twenty-three people onboard including the football (soccer) players of Manchester United. Though it is about football, ""United"" does not contain any football game scenes, so if you are expecting films like ""Goal! The Dream Begins,"" you may be disappointed.

To describe the tragic event, the film focuses three real-life people: Matt Busby, manager of Manchester United, who gets nearly killed in the accident (Dougray Scott); Bobby Charlton, a young football player, who after the tragedy went on to become a legend (Jack O'Connell); and Jimmy Murphy, assistant manager, who was not on the flight (David Tennant). The actors all did fine jobs (though I find Scott's Matt Busby too dark). David Tennant, ""Tenth Doctor"" of the ""Doctor Who"" series, is a real standout as Jimmy Murphy taking over the job of manager to reassemble the team.

Obviously the filmmakers of ""United"" wanted their film to be as accurate as possible. It shows us many details: how Bobby Charlton was found on the ground, strapped in his seat; how some of the team members moved to the back of the plane before the fatal take-off; how goalkeeper Harry Gregg, miraculously unscathed, went back into the wreckage and saved passengers, and so on.

So you might ask: why only three stars? That ""United"" does not have football scenes did not bother me. The story itself is a moving one, but I somehow didn't find myself emotionally involved in the way the story was told. Directed by British television director and writer James Strong, ""United"" is convincing as reenactment of the tragedy and the events leading up to it, but as to how the survivors reacted to the shocking event and came back to the pitch, the film just needs more time.

Those who are not familiar with the football league systems in England and Europe might find some of the film's details a bit confusing, especially how the team went on to complete the season. The team ""rose from the ashes"" (if I may borrow the phrase of the tagline), but not in the dramatic way you might imagine. It took time for the team to rise again and ""United"" sticks to the fact.

That is a wise decision on the part of filmmakers, who refuse to overdramatize the events, but I also think the film could have told us more about the people. Perhaps 90 minutes is too shot for that.",1344124800,8,2564,4.727069351230425
