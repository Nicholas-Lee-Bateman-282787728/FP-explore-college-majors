7935718,2,B00005ASOZ,"This is displayed/described as Volumes 3 & 4, but it only has 4 episodes.  I paid over $48.00 for this.  The description requires serious correction.",1386288000,,149,4.92
7935719,1,B00005ASOZ,"i bought this dvd thinking that i would get season 3&4 for the price of one ..... because i can buy a whole season for about 25 dollars...
not so .....volume 3&4 is misleading...you only get 4 episodes plus one bonus episode that i can not get to play....i was so frustrated,because it was used and it cost me 18 dollars plus to get just 4 episodes... what a rip off..... don't buy it!!!! i don't think it is worth it.....rather buy the whole season ...you get much more for your money....i do not think, that i would have paid more than 5 dollars for only 4 episodes!!!!!",1314144000,4,572,4.305555555555555
7935720,1,B00005ASOZ,I have started collecting the real mcCoys and now have seasons 1 2 and 3.  I went to see if season 4 is available yet and they have combined season 3 and 4.  You can't get just season 4!! I don't want another copy of season 3!! What a dirty trick.  Sure hope they don't continue to do this.,1250208000,3,290,3.8813559322033897
7935721,5,B00005ASOZ,"I have only watched a few episodes so far, but they are clear. What surprises me is that I remember a brief ending with one of them called ""The Jinx."" After Orval seemingly saves the McCoy family from an explosion (planned by Grandpa, Luke and Pepino), there is an additional ending where a letter is received that Orval is back with his father, a happy man. His father writes that Orval was helping him with pounding posts. Then he tells them to please excuse the handwriting. It will be better when the doctor takes the splints off his arms. (I remember that episode especially.) What happened to those particular endings?

I am delighted that the TV series is on DVD now. I only wish you had the whole set of them. There was a season 6.",1249948800,,739,4.4338235294117645
7935722,1,B00005ASOZ,Come On !  Why does a company do this ?  Each of the episodes on this set is Misssing four minutes of footage. These shows were so good but to do this is terrible. I just hope the Box set of the 1st season coming out is complete or I will definitely return it. Back in the 1950's - 1960's all half hour shows were 26 min. and the hour shows were 52 min. Nowadays the shows run 22min and 44min for hour shows( and sometime they run even less ). But to release the old stuff on DVD they should be un-cut or else don't put them out.,1177027200,16,529,3.8440366972477062
7935723,5,B00005ASOZ,"I would love to have every episode that this show made.  If there is a way to get more episodes I will buy them.  Also the show Major Dad starring Gerald McRaney and the show Dear John.  Amazon has more shows of the style that I love.  Clean family fun with out the cursing and sex and the shows of a variety that I can sit down with my 5 year old and instill family values.

Show me those and I will buy them.",1168473600,3,410,3.8333333333333335
7935724,5,B00005ASOZ,What a classic television show. Great comedy and great actors. Walter Brennen is at his best. A must have for anyone who misses true television comedy.,1154822400,7,151,4.846153846153846
7935725,5,B00005ASOZ,"I loved the McCoys as a kid...and hadn`t seen them for over 40 yr.s till I got this DVD.Now I love them even more. This is a great DVD.Real values are always relevant and I`m amazed at the values this TV program has to share. Buy this DVD and see what love,forgiveness,generousity,kindness,humility,compassion and more are all about. You won`t be dissapointed and like me,perhaps want to buy as many episodes as possible.",1088294400,42,421,4.861111111111111
