8485765,3,B005T44CSS,scenery and set was good or even better. I liked that they tied up all the loose ends and the ending was find. Unfortunately the acting was terrible and the story line completely unbelievable. Also the character development was inconsistent and poorly thought out. I would have given it 2 stars except for the scenery. Director apparently does not understand the use of camera position and shadows as many close up side views were poorly accomplished due to shadows.,1505347200,,466,4.9113924050632916

This ""film"" is nothing more than men fitted in tight pants that's supposed to be enough to make you believe that their is an actual story here.

8485768,5,B005T44CSS,Recently I have seen many reviews that remark 'gay' cinema has come into it own. Having just watched 'Somefarwhere' I can wholeheartedly  agree without reservations. I have never seen a better movie even among the classics of the Golden Age. The story will hold you spellbound. The actors are A-list.,1482883200,,300,5.0
8485769,5,B005T44CSS,"I did not think to much of the story line, the first time I viewed this film.  It is a very complex and compound scenario in it presentation.  This has to be classed in the 'Romantic Spy Thriller, with of course, Gay Overtones.  The rough nature of the cinematography only adds to the mood of this film.  It is one the very few films done in this genre that has a 5Star rating.  NJMJr!",1459209600,,385,4.148648648648648
8485770,5,B005T44CSS,"This is a spy vs. spy during a war, with a gay personal search.  This film is very realistic in its portrayal of characters in the story.  Some of the cryptic political comments was a shabby attempt at denouncing a President.  NJMJr.",1452297600,,233,4.5
8485771,4,B005T44CSS,"The background for this film supposedly takes place in 2004 along the ""Pakistani-Iraqi boarder [sic]"" according to the DVD jacket. First of all there is no ""Pakistani-Iraqi"" border. The author of the DVD jacket blurb neither knows geography nor how to spell. Secondly, the movie was actually filmed in Syria at the ancient site of Gerash and apparently in the vicinity of Petra which is currently in southern Jordan.  The finale of the film may have even been filmed in the ruins of the amphitheatre of Lepcis Magna in present day Libya. All of that is quite understandable given the instability and uncertainty of filming in the Iraq of the past few years. Nevertheless, the setting for ""Somefarwhere"" is in fact Iraq though the plot is as convoluted as is the film's title (why wasn't it titled ""Somewherefar""?). Be that as it may, our story revolves around the efforts of a handsome and energetic young man named Price St. John (played by Bryce Blais) who is determined to find his gay lover Bo who is a marine and considered to be AWOL after purportedly participating in the slaughter of a number of Iraqi civilians. Passing himself off as a tourist/photographer which seems to fool no one, Price searches for Bo with the dubious help of various individuals.  It is at this point that the movie seems to go off the rails. One individual who may or may not know where Bo is suddenly materializes one day sitting next to Price on his bed while he was sleeping. From then on, we have a game of cat and mouse between Price, an Arab aide who wants to help him and is also falling for him, the Iraqi Minister of Defense, one of his assistants, and the aforementioned individual who came  out of nowhere. Bo is alive - or is he? Is he being held for ransom? Should Price be taken prisoner and held for ransom (Price comes from a powerful and wealthy family and his mother is a Senator)? Should Price and Bo (if alive) be turned over to the Taliban [sic] (who are NOT in Iraq) just to embarrass the US since the two are homosexual lovers? Should the two be turned over to some terrorist group for a hefty price to allow them to be executed? Despite the confusion as to who is on whose side, the questionable intentions of the various parties, the problem regarding Bo's whereabouts and existence, with better and tighter editing as well as some additional transitional explanatory material, this movie would have been worthy of a solid 5 stars.  The characters are real, well acted, fully three-dimensional, and quite credible. The film's star Bryce Blais is the glue that holds this movie together in so many ways. He is attractive, determined, and all too human. Those who surround him are highly effective in their individual performances as well. Since I will not give away any ""Spoilers"", suffice it to say that the film builds to an exciting, unexpected, and satisfying climax. If it were given a rating, it would probably only be a PG-13 more for particular commentary and behavior than anything else.",1446336000,,3004,4.67296786389414
8485772,4,B005T44CSS,"""Somefarwhere"", albeit a strange title, is a rather suitable one for Everett Lewis' motion picture, which has as its location, for the film story's locales as well as for the real geographical locations in which it was shot, in the Middle East. A young American man, Price St. John (played by Bryce Blais), comes to this difficult and (at least for someone in his situation) dangerous area seeking his missing male lover, Bo (acted by Drew Boylan). It turns out that, despite unsatisfactory Armed Forces accounts of what had happened, that Bo was caught up in a war crime that his U.S. Marines unit perpetrated. Bo, who is so much the focus of the plot, is seen only seldom in the movie, filmed directly only at its conclusion. As it turns out, Bo had not participated in the American Marines' brutality, but has been captured and is being held hostage, either for ransom, if that work out, or for revenge execution, to be beheaded by his shady Arab captors.

Price's efforts to find and to rescue Bo entail many sometimes complicated doings. Much spy-vs.-spy antics, backstabbing, double-dealing, and slippery, shifting motivations occurs on the part of those who either promise to further Bo's release or who desire foremost to slit the captive's  throat, possibly to the point of beheading him. the more so because, like Price, Bo is gay. During all of these wranglings, Price himself falls into the hands of some of those who already have been part of the guerrilla cell holding Bo. (It takes longer than at that point in the film, however, for the two lovers to be reunited.)

To say more would be to reveal ""spoilers"", so I will not go further in giving the Amazon user reading this review some idea of what this film is about. Anyway, I could benefit from further viewings over more time to sort it all out! The third most important member of the dramatis personae is Marwan, an Arab guide (the role taken by Khaled Haider) who is helping Price and who falls more than a little bit in love with him. Price (who, anyway, is coming to fear, wrongly it turns out, that Bo is dead) responds in kind. The fourth character is the conniving bounty-hungry American, Combs (Dale Dymkoski taking the part) whose greatest and lewdly expressed desire is to coerce Price into accepting that Combs sodomise him.

This motion picture was made under some difficult circumstances, as director and screenwriter Everett Lewis explains in a bonus feature, which explain why some of its scenes could have come out more satisfactorily, if the cast and crew had had more time to do multiple takes. More such refining of the film, something that tighter editing would have furthered, also could have benefitted it through compressing the action, with faster pacing, especially at the moments of greatest danger to the protagonists. It was risky to film the most homoerotic scenes in a Middle Eastern region where fundamentalist Islam runs rampant, so perhaps the film as it stands is the best that could be accomplished under the circumstances. There are, after all, numerous moments and scenes of male-on-male romantic intimacy, especially of men kissing one another tenderly, leisurely, and passionately. Then, too, Bryce Blais appears quite often shirtless or nearly nude (although never entirely full-frontally naked) a lot of the time. Haider and Dymoski, too, are sometimes in partial states of undress, though at less length. Blais and Dymoski are among the stable of actors upon whom whose talent Everett Lewis has drawn several times to cast in his various movies. And talented they, and the entire cast, truly are.

It does no harm that Bryce Blais is a rather good-looking young dude, a little plain perhaps at first glance, but of appealingly fine, lanky physique, expressive face, lusciously kissable lips, nicely rounded, firm buttocks, and lovely complexion. Blais is the kind of lad whose beauty reveals itself gradually; as the longer and increasingly intently one looks at him, the more Blais' comeliness reveals itself to the beholder. It is no wonder that not only Bo, but also Marwan and Combs, ""fall"" for him. As for Dymoski, an actor who can be quite sexy, especially as the rocker ""Pagan"", in Lewis' film ""The Pretty Boys"" (in which Blais also appears), he conceals his naturally appealing good looks this time around in order better to reflect outwardly Combs' crass and disreputable character. Khaled Haider, as Marwan, is of a more husky, ruggd build, quite handsome in that sort of way.

I purchased, through Amazon-France, an edition of the movie from France (Optimale 524-280-1) in order to have some provision of subtitles. Optimale includes them in French (thus in a language in which I am proficient), which helps considerably, since the dialogue, not surprisingly in a film with so many Arab actors taking major, secondary, and minor parts, is not always easy to make out with sufficient clarity or certainty. Viewers, however, who are less hard of hearing than I am becoming, may find the North American edition more satisfying than I would have found it. The movie is about ""hard issues"" (war crime, hostage-taking, torture, and gay sexuality) confronted with full honesty and clarity, which only adds to the significance of this 2011 film, which is very much worth seeing time and again.",1425859200,3,5307,4.937290033594625
