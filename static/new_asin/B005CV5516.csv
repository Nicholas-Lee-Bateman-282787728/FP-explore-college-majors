8465962,1,B005CV5516,"The Boy Who Cried Bitch: The Adolescent Years is a god-awful little nightmare of a movie that has no relationship whatsoever to the excellent 1991 film, The Boy who Cried Bitch, starring Harley Cross. Different director, different character names, unrelated plot. This atrocity simply steals the main title and for the next  99 minutes inflicts the viewer with boredom and mindless violence without any motivation at all. Yeah, it's filmed well, and the acting is OK, but it's all for naught. By the end of the story no one will really care as no understanding or even twisted empathy for the main character has ever been developed. If there was even a scant overall viewer desire established by the nine other people who wasted nearly 100 minutes of their life watching this, it is a desire for the main character to finally die horribly so the whole thing will finally end.",1444953600,3,875,4.7947019867549665
