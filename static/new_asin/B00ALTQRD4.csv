5449392,5,B00ALTQRD4,"I never saw Hondo until recently, now it is one of my favorites. The newer version of True Grit was pretty good, but I like the original better.",1445817600,,144,4.178571428571429
5449393,1,B00ALTQRD4,"So angry. I should have been more careful but I didn't notice that only Hondo is John Wayne. The ""True Grit"" in this collection is the newer version without John Wayne. Now why would anyone create a set like this? I didn't realize my mistake until I got the package. How may others got fooled too? Amazon, you should make it clearer in your description! Too late to return it, I guess. Not even worth the trouble. I'm angry!",1436572800,6,424,4.379746835443038
5449394,1,B00ALTQRD4,"I've read several reviews and comparisons about the two True Grit, movies.  While I don't remember ever watching John Wayne's version, or if I did, I may have been really young and don't recall.  Therefore, I decided to purchase the 2010 remake.  Which I expected it to be superior to the original.  This was not the case.  While the acting of the 2010 was incredible, I found Jeff Bridge's character to be annoying.  A falling down drunk, alcoholic is hardly what I expected.  The Best Performance would have to go to Hailee Steinfeld, playing the main character, Mattie Ross.  Just her lines, alone, were exceptionally mastered.  I didn't care for Matt Damon's performance either.  I felt like he was poorly cast, for this role.  But then again, I didn't like the idea of Glen Campbell in the original version, either.

Now, some of you may think, well what about Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven?  True, not in keeping with the Traditional Hero persona.  Unforgiven was well acted, well directed and it offered a more ""true"" and ""gritty"" look on the old West and it's victims, it's villains and even it's heros.
The bad guy, was not so bad and the good guy, was not so good (Gene Hackman's character).  Unforgiven was edgy and dark and even though Clint's character was not a good person, you cheered for him to win and in doing so, his character achieved salvation.  Maybe I'm biased.  But films  is an art form, and like all art, it's subjective.",1435881600,2,1447,4.674603174603175
5449395,4,B00ALTQRD4,"Hondo: 1 of the best westerns ever made -- IMO, Wayne's 2nd best (2nd only to The Searchers). 5 stars for it.
True Grit: fairly good, but not as iconic as Wayne's version. And, some of the language wasn't necessary. Maybe 3 stars.",1414886400,,230,4.372093023255814
5449396,4,B00ALTQRD4,"The only reason I gave 4 stars is because Hondo is just plain cheesy (if your into older westerns it might be enjoyable for you). The new True Grit movie is a masterpiece in my option. Far better than the first. All main characters have top class actors that mesh well together. It's a wonderful blend of comedy, action and drama. There isn't any unbelievable action stunts performed or other unrealistic character abilities that take away from so many western. If you enjoyed the movies Tombstone, Lonesome Dove, Appaloosa and Open Range than I'm confident you will really enjoy this one. Good luck!",1390780800,,600,4.834951456310679
