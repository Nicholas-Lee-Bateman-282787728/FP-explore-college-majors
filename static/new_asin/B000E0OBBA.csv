2476792,5,B000E0OBBA,"LOST is most noteable for an outstanding unexpectedly so performance from Dean Cain.  While Cain has had some good roles in movies like MAN ON FIRE and BEST MEN, nothing has challenged him as much as this role.  He plays Jeremy, a young executive who has just pulled off a major heist (6 million), and finds himself lost somewhere in Nevada, being followed by the robbers he betrayed and his only ally a voice from the Road Map customer service department.  Cain pretty much has a solo act in this unusual thriller, well written and directed.  He displays a range of emotion he has rarely had to call on before, and he pulls through with a stunning performance.  Credit also to Danny Trejo, who we only hear as well as Ashley Scott, who is Judy, the voice on the other end of the line.  Tense and disturbing, with much religious allegory and symbolism, LOST is a film that deserves a bigger audience.",1142812800,24,900,4.5246913580246915
2476793,5,B000E0OBBA,"i totally thought this movie would blow.

BUT IT IS REALLY AN AMAZING FILM!

it's like straw dogs meets joyride (the good parts of joyride anyway)!

i was on the edge of my seat with my fists clenched through the ENTIRE film!!

if you like films to really take you for a ""ride"" then this is the one for you!!!

also, truly riveting performance by the superman guy!

A MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!",1139356800,12,385,4.352112676056338
2476794,4,B000E0OBBA,"This movie will change your life.  The potent exploration of religious themes is conducted in a Dantean manner, with echoes of Richelieu in Dean Cain's character juxtaposed with the classical Jesuit secrecy of purpose that Danny Trejo brings to this.  I might also note that this is some of Mr. Trejo's finest work, finally eclipsing the nuanced performance he delivered in From Dusk Till Dawn.  As Mr. Trejo emerges as one of the finest character actors of his generation, people will look back at this role as one of the turning points.",1139356800,5,538,4.826086956521739
2476795,5,B000E0OBBA,I SAW THIS MOVIE AND BY ACCIDENT IN LA AND THIS MOVIE REALLY MAKE U THINK. I LUVED ALL THE TWISTS AND TURNS AND DEAN KANE WAS AWSOME!!! I ALSO LIKED THE CAMERAWORK AND THE OTHER ACTORS TO. IF U ARE INTERESTED IN EDGE OF YOURE SEAT THRILLERS THEN THIS ONE IS FOR YOU.,1139356800,7,266,3.9444444444444446
2476796,5,B000E0OBBA,"Dean Cain is America's most overlooked actor. He is terrific in this suspensful, somewhat ironic thriller. In the vein of Breakdown and Duel, this thriller keeps you on the edge of your seat. I can't say it enough, Dean Cain did one hell of a job!",1136851200,14,247,4.391304347826087
2476797,4,B000E0OBBA,"I thought this was a very gripping and exciting movie. It was full of twists and turns that keeps you on the edge of your seat right til the end. I think Dean Cain did a fantastic job with his performance and carried the film well by himself. As a DC fan I'm perhaps a little biased but in my own humble opinion it was one of his best performances (but be warned, not his sexiest. I mean the poor fella is out in a hot dessert for most of the film so its a little hard to look like GQ model)",1203465600,2,491,3.823529411764706
2476798,2,B000E0OBBA,"This movie tried to be something so much more than what it was.
Reminded me a little of ""Breakdown', although that was a far superior
film. Unlike others, what I found most annoying was Dean Cain trying to
be a frustrated man. When he got angry it simply was not convincing.
Add the annoying telephone operator at Road Aid on the other end and it
was just dreadful. You could see a mile away near the end that she was
helping the baddies. The DVD cover for LOST comes with a good write up
from LA Times but it just didn't live up to what they promised. I think
the film lost all credibility for me when Cain gave up his beautiful
BMW for some old farm yard truck which he had no idea whether it worked
or not. No-one would do this. Overall, this film is a stinker and if you wondered why
it went straight to DVD then check it out for yourself. Dean Cain may
be quite attractive to the women, but he cannot act. By the way, did
anybody else notice the constant, unnecessary swearing coming from his
mouth during the film?",1184630400,,1020,4.209183673469388
2476799,5,B000E0OBBA,"I ordered this movie just for watching the trailer and i might say that it matched and overwhelmed my expectations!

The story is thrilling and it's very well achieved as a film because it lives on only one character for about 90% of the time. A compelling journey that keeps throwing you bits and pieces of what might have happened but never what is going to happen. That's why if you miss the final 3 minutes you miss the whole clmax!

As for Dean Cain, he really absorbs the character and has that X factor which drives the audience to twist in the chair when the thrilling scenes happen.

I'm not gonna tell anything more because it's the kind of movie you really have to watch to understand. It can have many lessons or it may just work has 2 hours of entertainement, either way it blows us away!

Pity this kind of movies don't get the mainstream...it sure would beat some of those big BLOCKBUSTERS.",1174608000,5,905,4.433734939759036
2476800,5,B000E0OBBA,I like almost anything Dean Cain is in.  This was especially exciting and full of suspense. The ending was truly a surprise.  I highly recommend this movie.,1168819200,,156,4.7407407407407405
2476801,5,B000E0OBBA,"I originally read about this movie in an issue of Fangoria magazine, which led me to believe that it was a horror film.  We picked it up and watched it and my first reaction was this is a crappy horror film, but man what an awesome action/drama!  After I saw the movie I reread the article in Fangoria and the author conceded that this movie was not a horror film (this totally slipped by me when I read it the first time), but was a film worthy of viewing by anyone who liked good films.  The author is right.  Dean Cain, usually associated with the Lois and Clark series, is better known to me through the horror films he's done like Boa and Dragon Fighter, and him hosting the Ripley's Believe It or Not series.  I'm not a big fan of his work, but always thought he was a descent enough actor.  He's excellent in this film.  There is not one point that I didn't believe him as this character.  He does an absolutely incredible job of making us believe him.  The supporting cast is brilliant with Danny Trejo as the menace on the road and Ashley Scott comes off as the perfect 'voice on the phone' that's easy to listen too and easy to believe.  The story is well thought out and it's an absolute blast to watch a bad situation goes from bad, to worse, and finally totally disintegrates right in front of him.  I'm not familiar with anything that Darren Lemke's done in the past, but if this is any indication of what is coming in the future, then I'm in for the ride of my life.",1159833600,14,1481,4.253571428571429
2476802,5,B000E0OBBA,"As a Dean Cain fan I was thrilled with this movie  It is suspensful and kept me guessing the whole time. The format was different than most movies in that it follows Dean's character on a trip, so he was in 90% of the scenes. Loved the action.  Very good movie",1155081600,,260,4.078431372549019
2476803,1,B000E0OBBA,"Considering his string of career disappointments since the demise of ""Lois & Clark"" you have to wonder why in the world Dean Cain would ever have agreed to star in ""Lost,"" a 2004 movie by Darren Lemke now available on DVD.  The only possible answer that comes to mind is that Cain figured that if people could suspend their disbelieve enough to not see through Clark Kent's disguise, then maybe they could also suspend it enough not see through this failed and pointless movie.

 The set-up here (one can't actually call it a plot) is that Cain is a bank VP who arranges to have his own bank robbed, and then double-crosses the bad guys who stage the hold-up on his behalf.  It is a premise that might have gone far in the hands of an accomplished screenwriter.  Unfortunately, Lemke acted as his own scribe and apparently never showed the script to a soul until the cameras started rolling, so one can only surmise that there was no one else there to tell him that he had gone way, way, way, off course.

 The tension in the film is supposed to come from three facts: #1, Cain's character, Jeremy Stanton, is lost somewhere in the Nevada desert trying to make his escape from what he initially believes to be the perfect crime.  The second alleged tension point is the fact that not only his erstwhile accomplices, but everyone else west of the Mississippi have quickly figured out that Stanton is the brains behind both the robbery and the double-cross.  The third and final bit of suspense is intended to come from the fact that Stanton's cheated former partners are hot on his trail.

Regrettably, not one of these subplots really works.  Much is made in the screenplay of the fact that Stanton's map is out of date and that roads along his intended route are closed, flooded or no longer in existence.  But by the third time his On-Star proxy telephone navigation aide has informed him that the road he is on actually has a different name than the one on the map, the device has worn dangerously thin.  In point of fact, it is probably impossible to truly get as lost anywhere in North America as Stanton is portrayed as being in the film. But this impossibility is only one of several that haunt this improbable tale.  A few other include Stanton's apparent belief that his disappearance will go unnoticed after the robbery; the fact that he is portrayed as not having ever scouted out his escape route, and therefore has no idea at all of where he is going; the fact that his bad guy accomplices somehow unerringly get from the scene of the crime to the exact same roads to nowhere he is unintentionally traveling, and do so quickly enough to literally be right on his tail; and the fact that these same accomplices not only figure out EXACTLY how to trap him, but are successful in doing so. The script even has Cain reprising one of his old Superman stunts, unbelievably successful in spite of the absence of costume or cape.

To spice up Stanton's journey, Director Lemke tosses in an ominous cop on trash patrol, a catatonic old lady with a truck to sell, a spooky toothless preacher, moral lessons from one of AAA's lesser known competitors, and perhaps the worst motivational speaker to ever sell an audio tape.  None of it helps.

This film is aptly titled, for the movie, like the Stanton character himself, speeds 90 miles an hour down a dead end road, and it is quite possible to sense Cain sharing Stanton's grudging relief when the whole thing comes to a predictable and bad end. ""At least it's over,"" both the actor and his character must have been thinking.

It is only too bad that neither Cain nor his alter ego ever noticed the cavernous holes in this awful story; perhaps he could have driven through one, gotten clean away and against the odds lived happily ever after.",1152921600,2,3795,4.580502215657312
2476804,2,B000E0OBBA,"Dean Cain (Best Men, Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman ) stars as Jeremy Stanton a man on the road who gets kind of lost. He calls for help in which he gets operator Judy voiced by Ashley Scott (Walking Tall, Into The Blue) who tries to help him out in the situation. Along the way he talks to his family and friend Chester played by Justin Henry (Sixteen Candles, Groupies). But it seems that Cain did something he shouldnt of. In a bank robbery he switched bags and took the money for himself. Edward Archer voiced by the always great Danny Trejo (The Blue Rose, Desperado) wants his money and he's tracking Dean down. Cain is then on the drive trying to find his way out of the area he is lost in before Trejo finds him and well kills him. Predictable thriller only has some interesting moments and a pretty solid performance by Cain with great voice over work from Trejo.

2476805,1,B000E0OBBA,I can't believe someone actually made this movie. The writing seems like its out of a high-school drama class. I would never pay for this movie and i 'm glad my room-mate paid for it. He paid $1 and that was by far WAY too much. The only thing that I can say I got out of this movie is that i can see any movie in the world and it will be better than this. If i ever saw Dean Kain in person i would punch him in the face.,1146355200,3,421,3.6373626373626373

8103418,4,B000E0OBBA,"After reading these reviews I'm wondering if this movie didn't completely miss its target audience. The reviews seem to be split between people who have never seen an ensemble piece and can't stand dialogue heavy films and people who watched Lost for Dean Cain and nothing else. Having  said that, this is a solid film, and the tension is quite good.

I won't bother getting into the plot, as you can find it elsewhere, and some things should be left to discover.

Dean Cain gives a solid performance. Sure, he's mostly a television actor. He's not Phillip Seymour Hoffman but he's not bad. At first I wasn't too keen on his performance (and let it be known, I AM a fan of Lois and Clark) but as the film went on he started to grow into the role and showed some good range. When he was about to turn himself in I thought he was pretty convincing.

Danny Trejo is the man. I don't know why doesn't get more screen time in movies. This is probably his biggest role outside of Machete, and he is appropriately menacing.

The script was tight and the pacing just about perfect. This is the kind of film I would make--lots of tension, only a few actors, and no big budget explosions. An ideal slice of cinema that can be cooked up without spending too much money.

We've seen movies like this before (Duel, Joy Ride, Highwaymen) but Lost gets the job done and does it well. I might even be inclined, if I was in a good mood, to say it is one of the better car-suspense movies out there.

Recommended for a rainy day, and *sigh* also to Dean Cain fans. But you don't have to know who he is to enjoy this movie.",1369785600,,1604,4.308970099667774
8103419,1,B000E0OBBA,"I loves Dean Cain's movies but this one was well beneath him.  Definitely not his style.  He must have really needed the money when he made this one.  It is full of foul language, so not like him to use such words.  I usually can trust his movies to be good and clean but this one was bad. It is boring as well.  He did a good job acting if that counts for anything. I'll have a hard time giving this one away.",1358812800,,410,3.891566265060241
8103420,5,B000E0OBBA,"This one is a must-see! I am an avid movie fan, and especially a mystery/suspense movie. This was a great role for Dean Cain and the movie kept my interest from beginning to end!",1351296000,,178,4.264705882352941
8103421,3,B000E0OBBA,"Before I watched this I had no idea who was Dean Cain is (guess he is in some Superman movie). After I was done with this I discovered he is a guy sitting in a Ford F150 for almost the entire movie talking on a cell phone to get directions to an air strip in a Nevada small town. This movie was frustrating (and maybe tedious) because at every turn you think something better plot wise could've happened, but didn't. After a few more LOST turns you realize Stanton is just a moron with no sense of direction or common sense - yet he was smart enough to pull of a double crossing bank heist. At the same time, there are some brillant moments in the film. One in particular, a police car is sitting next to a billboard and Stanton approaches it ready to turn himself in and the policeman looks like one of those mannequin dummy policeman sitting there to disuade speeders.",1335312000,,870,4.310975609756097
8103422,3,B000E0OBBA,"Well lets be honest, Dean Cain is not the greatest actor of our generation and while that's no crime, it's the level of acting that would have had to occur to lift this movie above three stars in my opinion.  It's a decent plot line and a decent script with a couple of better than average moments but that's about the  best I can say about it.  I don't blame Cain for this mostly sub par thriller, Cain turns in a solid journeyman performance.  Not the best I've seen him do and not the worst either.  Just average...like the rest of this movie; average performance, average script, average direction, average everything.  So I give it an average rating, three stars.  If you are enough of a Dean Cain fan, (and judging by the number of 5 star ratings there's more than a few of you out there), you might be persuaded to give it higher marks but only at the expense of credibility.  One or two decent plot points but nothing mind bending.

I don't hate this movie, I don't love this movie I just feel, like the rest of this review, average about it.",1309737600,,1050,4.343589743589743
8103423,2,B000E0OBBA,"Some bad acting here. It's very hard to give a great performance when most of your screen time is spent talking into a cell phone, which is how most of this ill-begotten suspense thriller plays out. You'll get very tired of that gimmick very quickly. There's a lack of credibility, too, as the main character spends all day and half the night aimlessly driving around the California desert in search of a place in Nevada so he can escape after a bank robbery. Minimal onscreen violence, at least. But this one is just too one-dimensional.",1237852800,,538,4.673684210526316
8103424,1,B000E0OBBA,"It was just like watching a one-man improve on stage, at your local community theater. The constant inquiries with his auto club, regarding directions got really old (with Judy, the CSA). The conversation with the ""no habla ingles"" was really dumb. The highway patrol ""trash enforcer"" was sooooo stupid (gee, I would've never thought he was dead""). One of the dumbest plots I've seen on the DVD screen.

I'm glad this movie went unnoticed by most of the world. Why is Danny Trejo always cast as a heavy bad guy? (Except for ""Spy Kids"") Luckily, he only shows up the last few minutes. The only good thing about this movie was the ending. Only because you're going to be glad it ended so soon. Only 80 minutes [LONG]. THANK GOODNESS!",1222214400,,731,4.623076923076923
