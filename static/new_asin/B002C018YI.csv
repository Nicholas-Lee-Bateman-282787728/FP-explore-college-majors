8362659,2,B002C018YI,"TO GET TO HEAVEN, FIRST YOU HAVE TO DIE (2006) is a film by Jamshed Usmonov set in the director's native Tajikistan. Kamal (Khurshed Golibekov) is a young man who has recently married, but he suffers from impotence and has been unable to consummate his marriage. After three months, he visits a doctor and then undertakes to learn the art of love from some older woman in the capital. The first half of the film has him stalking various women around Dushanbe. This odyssey in an American film would probably have been portrayed in a goofy underdog fashion, but Kamal's attempts are creepy, though we do feel his pain.

About halfway through the film, Kamal ends up sleeping with the wife (Dinara Drukarova) of a thug (Maruf Pulodzoda). This lowlife finds out, he doesn't mind as  he had been separated from his wife for some time anyway, and takes Kamal under his wing as they burgle their way around town. After witnessing the full extent of his partner's brutality, Kamal turns on him in a bloody fashion, which happens to cure his sexual dysfunction.

All in all, I can't recommend TO GET TO HEAVEN to general audiences. This isn't the first film I've seen by a young director that begins in one way and then transitions too suddenly into mobsters and violence. Yes, I get the Oedipal allusions and the probing of the male psyche, but the plot arc chosen for this study just screams ""immature scriptwriter"". The cinematography is also unimaginative.

I could compliment only two aspects, which will probably only interest a rather niche audience. One is that I'm bound for Tajikistan in less than a week as I write this, and there are few internationally available films from the country, so I guess TO GET TO HEAVEN was useful as a glimpse of Tajikistan. The acting by Drukarova and Pulodzoda was competent, and perhaps the same could be said for Golibekov if the character he portrays weren't too cringingly awkward to really appreciate.",1302825600,,1942,4.770833333333333
8362660,5,B002C018YI,"Strange land, strange people, strange deeds.

Somewhere in modern Tajikistan, a traditionally poor then Soviet outskirt turned recently into a semi-Islamic state resting in Northern Himalayas, young man- legally, 20y.o. teen in the UK and the most of a British Commonwealth got married with no emotional and physical connections to a bride.

Trying to lose virginity, he became involved in a string of tragic criminal events embedded on a general landscape of a mafia reality the Commonwealth of the Independent States presented at the fall of the twentieth century especially.

It is a sexy, clever, well done work of much deeper context, rather than playing the pillow games by a ""traditional"" way, surely.

Highly recommended.",1251158400,,729,5.3130434782608695
