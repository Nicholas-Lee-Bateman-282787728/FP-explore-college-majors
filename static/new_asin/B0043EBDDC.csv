8414789,5,B0043EBDDC,"This is the only cardio workout I do now - the pace is perfect, low impact but very challenging.  Ilaria's direction on the program as she performs it with you are inspiring, fun, and convey a sense of ""yes, it is tough, but you CAN do it.""  Throughout the program she provides verbal cues on proper technique.  It truly feels like you are attending one of her classes and not just watching some slick, over-produced, workout created on a soundstage - everyone in it sweats at the same rate and there are no awkward breaks/edits.  The music is helpful as the beats accentuate where you change position and is not annoying.  I have been doing this program daily for 2 months (Vol. 6) and still work up a heavy sweat every time.  By wearing 1 lb weighted gloves, my workout is even better.  I wish Amazon would carry all of Ilaria's DVDs and have them on Prime.",1455840000,,859,4.43312101910828
