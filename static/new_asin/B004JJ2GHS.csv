8431904,5,B004JJ2GHS,"This is an excellent look at the Circle City in the best decade of the 20th century, the 1950s.  Some of the modern day (1995, when it was filmed) footage at Bill's Fabulous '50s drive in on Rockville Road brought back many pleasant memories. Overall, it was a great film and I'm glad to finally have it on DVD to replace my original over the air video tape from the summer of 1995.",1455148800,,382,4.232876712328767
8431905,5,B004JJ2GHS,We had a taped version that was in bad shape and hard to view. The new one is great for anyone growing up around Indy in the 50's.,1400198400,,130,3.6785714285714284
8431906,1,B004JJ2GHS,"This is without question the most disjointed, badly edited, & boring DVD I have ever seen. I was so excited to get it, as my husband & I both grew up in Indpls. during the '50's.  The uninteresting commentators talked about what a great city Indpls. was, & how proud they were to be a part of it.  It made me feel ashamed, & also made me wonder if I had glorified my happy childhood in Indpls., because that sure wasn't the way I remembered my life.  I had planned on showing this to my daughters & my grandson, but instead, I promptly put it in the wastebasket when we finished watching it.",1353715200,,591,4.212389380530974
8431907,5,B004JJ2GHS,"There were great pictures from the past.  My wife lived there in the 1950's and remembers the places well.

Great DVD.
