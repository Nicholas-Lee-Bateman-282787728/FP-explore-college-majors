8118893,5,B000F8L4EI,The nativity story from the king james version of the bible put together for kids to enjoy and understand. I have a 3 1/2 year old and she really got it. her cousins the same age really liked it too. it's easier for them to follow that reading straight from the bible. We adults enjoyed watching it too! great way to teach your kids the true meaning of Christmas.,1295308800,2,363,4.27536231884058
