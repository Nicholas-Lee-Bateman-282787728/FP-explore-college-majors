I think the best actor was LL Cool J.  I thought I might watch it again. but I will do that sometime when I can't find something to watch and want something like a TV movie...totally un-memorable.  What is the dead give-away for movies like this is they are 90 minutes (on the back) and that means they were made if not FOR TV, they wanted it to be on TV...two hours with commercials.

I think I watched it all the way though. Which means it was OK, but not what I would call mentally challenging or stimulating.  Certainly not Grisham or Clancy or Patterson (Great books lousy movies).",1353110400,,671,4.2936507936507935
