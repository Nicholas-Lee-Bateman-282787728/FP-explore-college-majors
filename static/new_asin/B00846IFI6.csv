8524988,5,B00846IFI6,A great video!  It shows the early successes of the kibbutz movement alongside the challenges faced by the movement from globalism and automation.  A new kibbutz will arise from the ashes of the old and once again provide the basis for an egalitarian Israeli society,1457913600,,266,4.888888888888889
8524989,4,B00846IFI6,"I saw the film at a theatre in NYC and I liked it, it was quite interesting. many of the people speaking were speaking in Hebrew, but there were English subtitles. overall I got quite an insight into the kibbutz and how it has changed since the founding of the state of Israel. This is a Film Worth Watching",1431388800,,307,4.220338983050848
8524990,5,B00846IFI6,"I love history and always wondered about the how the kibbutz movement got started, progressed, and then dissipated.  Having visited the Holyland and stayed on one, I was fascinated that a socialist environment could exist and thrive.  This inspired and blessed documentary follows the movement from its inception in the 1920's (fascinating to see citified middle class youngsters try to farm a difficult environment - and thrive, doing it).  These young people, the backbone and founders of the State of Israel, literally invented their future as there was no template - they were in the Twilight Zone compared to life back in New York and Chicago.  Survivors of the first and subsequent generations are interviewed objectively; the photography is beautiful and touching.  The Hand of God was on this film.",1396569600,,806,5.1692307692307695
8524991,4,B00846IFI6,"Having lived on two kibbutzim in the early 1970s as a volunteer, I can only say that this documentary very accurately describes the truth about the kibbutz life as it still was 40 years ago, and does not pull any punches. Both the idealism and the pitfalls of this lifestyle is accurately described. Once upon a time I wanted nothing other than to be a kibbutznik, but the dichotomy of human nature as it really is versus what I would have wanted it to be came into focus and in the end I chose to opt out. But it was in many ways the greatest year of my life and the memories of all that I experienced and learned will remain with me forever. I am happy I had that experience, but only saddened that dreams and the realities of life are nearly impossible to reconcile. I only hope that the kibbutz ideal is never totally extinguished so that others can at least experience a dream if only for a moment in their life. Like Disneyland for a kid. But how many could actually live in Disneyland for a lifetime?",1387929600,3,1007,4.3052631578947365
8524992,5,B00846IFI6,"This was the comment of one dissatisfied member of the Kibbutz experiment who still confessed that these enlightened moments of his experience radically altered his soul.  It is quite amazing that a group of socialist/zionist Jews actually had the chutzpah to put their words into action and create these living communities where people operated with a sense of altruism as opposed to a creed of getting more at the expense of others. (The earnings of all the members were usually pooled and distributed equally). Such utopias are bound to be seduced and undone by the immense capitalist promise of status, wealth, power and sex.  Still the values of these communities were essential to the birth of Israel, even though the members constituted only 5 per cent of the population,  As an idea, the kibbutz serves as the foundational myth of Israel as a mixing pot of good intentioned Jews working for a common goal.

There are controversial aspects of the Kibbutz, expecially with respect to child rearing.  Biology teaches us that most mothers and fathers prefer to raise and set the standards of their own children rather than be forced to have their kids live apart and be brought up by all the parents of the community.  Another problem -  the Kibbutz offered few opportunities for intellectual pursuits other than farming, building, and defending.  Still, I have a great deal of respect for the values of the communities and the real accomplishments of those farming centers close to the land.

I would argue that this movie provides a glimpse into an essential chapter of Israeli history. For one thing, the archival footage is truly marvelous. Also praiseworthy, the filmmakers identify conflicting viewpoints from first generation to third generation participants.  But even today, there are Kibbutz like communities developing in urban centers - a testament to the power of an idea.

Going back to the children: the archival photographs suggest they are happy and content most of the time.  I have no doubt that these are accurate portrayals because existential loneliness would be unknown.  My takeaway from the film is that as a world of peoples we still have much to learn about the Kibbutz experience, even though we have no plans to repeat it. After all, it takes very special, committed individuals to make any utopia succeed.",1384214400,,2339,5.012919896640827
