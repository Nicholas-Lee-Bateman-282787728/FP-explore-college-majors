2714176,5,B000LUYKU0,"I have incorporated Oxycise into my daily routine. I find that when I use it consistently, not only does my metabolism seem to speed up a little, but, as a singer, I find I have better breath control. The price was a little high for what you get, but I am making the most of my money.",1390262400,9,284,4.0
2714177,5,B000LUYKU0,"If done correctly, this is a quick way to exercise. It is easy and yet challenging to keep every muscle of your body tight while you do the correct breathing! Like it years ago on tape. Need it more now!",1379462400,5,203,4.1
2714178,4,B000LUYKU0,"I liked the one disc I received but disappointed when it says two disc set and again only got one, where's my other one?",1373932800,,120,4.041666666666667
2714179,5,B000LUYKU0,"It was great to watch  Aubrey after listening to Jill for many years. I have had level 1 workout on video tape and now on DVD it is refreshing to see something different, even though I still think Jill is fantastic and so greatful she has shared Oxycise with everyone and not kept it to herself. Oxycise has certainly enhanced my life.",1364342400,9,335,4.403225806451613
2714180,5,B000LUYKU0,This disc was a replacement purchase. I was thankful that I could get this 2-Disc Set to return to a excercise program that had woked for me to lose weight and get strong.,1361491200,7,171,4.212121212121212
2714181,2,B000LUYKU0,"I wanted to love this DVD, I think many of the exercise positions are good, but there is nowhere on this $29.95 2 disc set which gives any sort of breathing instructions.

I emailed the oxycise website, but no one ever got back to me.",1361318400,5,234,4.2
2714182,4,B000LUYKU0,"this seems to be helping me with my asthma.  No, I'm not kidding.  It's hot and muggy out there, usually within walking a few blocks I'm wheezing... since I've started doing these breathing exercises, not so much.  In fact, in a situation where I usually have to use my inhaler -- I didn't need it.  Will it do that for everyone?  I have no idea, but it does seem to be making a difference for me.  So even if I don't lose weight from it, it's turning out to be worth the $ for me.",1344211200,12,481,4.010526315789473
2714183,5,B000LUYKU0,"believe or not , but this program works .Before  I tried a lot different ways : treadmill , swimming , nothing to eat after 6 pm , eat a small portion of food , pills for losing way  ( that almost kill me ) . Nothing was work . I was little skeptical about oxycise , but tried and very happy with result .Even recommended my daughter(she lives in Russia) , she was even more skeptical than me and she is  happy now too .Going to buy next level . Thank you Jill!!!",1333238400,18,463,3.956989247311828
2714184,5,B000LUYKU0,"I love this program and have been using it for several years now.  This is the newest dvd that they have produced which features Aubrey Lee, Jill Johnson's daughter.  This new workout is such an improvement and keeps me motivated to stick with it.  I have lost a total of 46 pounds and have maintained it using the Oxycise dvd's.  It takes a couple days to learn but now the breathing technique is like second nature.  I love that it is only a 15 minute workout and that I don't need weights or any other special workout equipment.  If anyone is looking to get rid of some extra weight and can't stand the typical routines that have you jumping around the room, sweating like a pig, I highly recommend you try Oxycise.  It does work.",1299024000,30,733,4.385185185185185
2714185,5,B000LUYKU0,"I ordered the easy does it, but Amazon.com sent me the level one workout instead. I was eager to try it, so I kept it. I wasn't able to do some of the poses because of obesity. However, I did do four 15 min. workouts daily, of ONLY the deep breathing exercises while sitting in my recliner. I only did rounded belly breaths without tightening anything. And guess what? I lost a pound a day, for a total of four pounds in four days! When I tightened my abdominal muscles throughout the (recliner) workout, I lost 1/2 pound per workout; rather than 1/4 pound. Their website said that a study conducted at a university showed that 90% of those studied lost about 1/2 pound from just one 15 min workout. That is wonderful! I highly reccomend this program to anyone who wants to lose weight and has tried everything. It really does work.",1286323200,42,832,4.444444444444445
8164239,3,B000LUYKU0,I'm not sure about this some days I seem to lose a little bit of weight and others days I don't. I do like the exercises the breathing it's seems unnatural but I do feel good after maybe because of all that oxygen. I am interested in the next levels but mostly for the exercises. If you have health problems these exercises are gentle on your body and I like working out with Aubrey.,1523145600,,383,4.1891891891891895
8164240,5,B000LUYKU0,"I have done Oxycise for probably close to 20 yrs. Long time, Wore my CD^s out, just as I wore my VHS out. I Love this program and now I'm 65 and still enjoying it. Buy this set , you will love it. Easy to do with great results.",1515369600,2,227,3.6530612244897958
8164241,2,B000LUYKU0,This set did not include both DVDS only the one. When I contacted the seller they said they no longer had the other DVD. I gave this to Goodwill as it was useless to me without the workout dvd.,1475539200,,193,3.9743589743589745

8164246,3,B000LUYKU0,Not exactly what I was expecting and I don't feel I needed a video to explain these breathing exercises.  A pamphlet would have done the trick.,1409184000,4,143,4.5
8164247,5,B000LUYKU0,Can't wait to use this workout for weight loss and overall health benefits.  I suggest that you carefully review the postures before going cold into the workouts.  That is what will determine how successful your outcome will be regarding weight loss and proper breathing techniques.  Hopefully this will also help with my poor sleep issues as well.,1405641600,2,348,5.0701754385964914
