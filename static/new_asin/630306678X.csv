548328,5,630306678X,"If you loved the Tonight show with Johnny Carson, you will love this!! I bought it for my Dad this past Christmas. The whole family sat around and watched it together. We had a great time, even my nephews who are 16 and 17 were laughing out loud. It was both funny and sentimental. My Dad espically liked seeing the old stars. Like the reader before me, Jimmy Stewart's ""a dog named BO"" was one we all got teary eyed over. The last show with Bette Midler and Robin Williams was fantastic. Robin had us rolling on the floor! And the lady with the potato chips was a hit with the younger people. To many funny things to list. (make sure you don't throw out your back laughing) This is a wonderful collection for most ages. A true Masterpiece.",998438400,60,740,4.330935251798561
548329,4,630306678X,Talk about L-A-U-G-H-S!  This is the funniest video for mostly mature audiences that I've viewed in a very long time.  Well worth the money.,977184000,8,140,4.791666666666667
548330,5,630306678X,"Johnny Carson was and is the king of late night comedy.  His nearly 30 year run as host of the Tonight Show will never be matched, if not in years, then certainly in quality and quantity of laughs.  Johnny was a  class-act when it came to his show, and was also incredibly funny.  The way  he handled his guests is something that today's ""talk-show"" hosts  (daytime and late-night) should study.  He was always gracious and  thoughtful, and most of all, VERY funny.  In addition to that, nobody was  better at dealing with the occasional foul-up or ""bombed"" joke.  He was simply so much fun to watch.  (An aside, successor Jay Leno could  not be further from Johnny, and the show has suffered considerably in his  absence).  David Letterman would have been a much better choice, and has  thankfully continued his irreverant brand of humour on another network.
This video collection captures many of the funniest moments of the  Tonight Show, and will have viewers of all ages laughing out loud.  There  will never be another Johnny Carson, and we can only be thankful that his  magic was captured on video tape.",955152000,38,1111,4.717277486910994

7836313,3,630306678X,"The Johnny Carson collection was okay because it didn't have many of the funniest moments that I saw in my years of watching the show.  There were hardly any Carnac bits, which were hilarious.  Otherwise, it was fine, but I wonder if these were really Johnny's favorites or the writer's favorites.",1377388800,,297,4.803921568627451
7836314,5,630306678X,All was received in very good condition and in time for Christmas.  Gave them to a friend as a present and he loved them.  Said he laughed for 3 hours straight one night watching Johnny Carson.  The price on all 3 items was very good which enabled me to give a gift that I knew my friend would enjoy.  Thank you.,1357171200,,312,4.065573770491803
7836315,5,630306678X,Purchased as a gift for my mom and she is thrilled as she lost her old collection.  We spend time together watching these old show clips and have a great time remembering.,1355011200,,171,4.34375
7836316,5,630306678X,I brought this to the cursing home one day and we all sat down and watched the old Johnny Carson clips.  We all laughed and had a great time reminiscing.,1315267200,,153,4.1
7836317,5,630306678X,"The above is a direct quote from my late grandmother.  When she was depressed or unhappy, these tapes comforted her and made her laugh.  We watched these tapes so many times that I could predict exactly when the animals would pounce on Johnny--but then, the animals always pounced on Johnny!  For a warm personality he was not fond of his wild guests of the four-footed variety...although I can't blame him for getting squeamish when the beetle crawled up his suit!

The one thing I would ever critique about Johnny is that David Letterman getting jokes as opposed to Jay Leno, who did a whole show on Johnny with obvious love, seems a bit like picking a favorite child.  Jay's humor and grace always seem more Johnny-esque than the overly self-satisfied Dave, who laughs entirely too much at his own jokes as opposed to Jay, who laughs mostly at himself.

But Johnny is still the king of late-night, having walked through the invisible curtain onto Heaven's stage...do you think the angels trumpeted, ""Heeerre's Johnny"" when he arrived in Heaven?  Johnny's son Rick has surely welcomed him Home.  When we saw into Johnny's personal foibles and a bit into the life of this fiercely private man, it meant something, especially in our exploitative showbiz culture.

My favorite moments, too many to list:

* Dyan Cannon laughing over her new romance and making comparisons with Johnny as a boyfriend

* Liz Taylor saying in response to Johhny's ""I was married to a Pisces"": ""I'm sure you were!""

* George Carlin's Hippy Dippy Weatherman

* Drew Barrymore before she decided to become a political expert

* Joey Lawrence and the kid from Parenthood who said he thought he looked ""cute"" on the monitors

* The spelling bee champ who asked Johnny to come to his birthday party and gave away Johnny's birthdate

* The potato chip lady

* Steve Martin's ""The great Flydini""

* Drew Carey's first appearance

* Bobby Kennedy

* A picture of a long-haired Arnold Schwarzenegger

* A Tarzan skit with Betty White

* Duet with Julio Iglesias, Johnny playing Willie Nelson (Julio can barely finish the song for laughing)

* AH!  The Bette Midler tribute!

* Anything with Jimmy Stewart

* Jay and Dave's debuts and Joe Piscopo imitating Dave's laugh

* Roseanne Barr

* Bill Clinton's appearance (no interns under Johnny's desk)

* Flip Wilson and Pearl Bailey

* Tiny Tim!

* Elizabeth Martineau working on Johnny's feet and telling him he would remarry again...""not with a woman""

* Jack Webb's appearance

* Johnny's imitation of Ronald Reagan!

* Stevie Wonder's appearance on the ""inside look"" at the making of the show

Great collection.  I'm sure the DVD is superior but...this one has sentimental value.  Thanks Johnny and we bid you a very heartfelt goodnight.",1106697600,7,2757,4.839055793991417
