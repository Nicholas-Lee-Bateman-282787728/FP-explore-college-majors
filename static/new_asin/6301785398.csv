I really don't get scared during horror movies, but the scarecrows are truly frightening. My only complaint is that is not in DVD format. Hopefully some company,like Anchor Bay, will.

2697619,5,6301785398,"There's something very, very wrong with this film.  I bought it off eBay, popped it the VCR and watched it with the lights on for the last half-hour.  I didn't want to--I simply had no choice.  The more I think about it, the more I realize that this is an imperfect reflection of someone's vision, something they themselves saw perfectly clearly...and were, for whatever technical reasons, not quite able to bring to the screen.  There is a plot, certainly--see IMDB.com for the details--and characters whose flaws and strengths seem recognizable enough.  But more importantly, there's a scenario, simple and chilling, whose resonance will keep you awake night after night.  It involves, on some superficial level, avarice and its consequence, but unless you have some masochistic attraction toward insomnia, nerve-shredding unease and chronic anxiety, you have no business watching this ""film.""  Avoid it, or endure the consequences of sleeplessness and creeping fear that leaves you staring at the ceiling while your partner dozes peacefully throughout the night.  It's the kind of movie that someone makes after they've been living with a certain, very specific version of truth all their lives, and are given exactly eighty-eight minutes of footage to alert the rest of the planet.  It's not entertainment. It's a warning.",1009152000,9,1326,5.276190476190476

2697631,4,6301785398,"A group of scumbag ex-military criminals have just successfully pulled off a major robbery, stealing $3 million dollars from Camp Pendleton. The thieves consist of their leader, Roxanne, along with Curry; Bert; Jack; and Corbin. They hijack an airplane and take a pilot, Al, and his pretty daughter, Kellie, hostage in order to make an untraceable getaway with intentions to heading to Mexico. As the plane passes over a cornfield, one of the robbers, Bert gets the bright idea to turn on his heist pals and parachutes out of the plane, planning to run off with the money all for himself.

Upon dropping, Bert loses the money and must find it among the cornfield. He comes across a secluded, decrepit farmhouse that looks like it hasn't been inhabited in years. Upon finding the money, he unfortunately comes to the realization that the fields are surrounded with multiple demonic, bloodthirsty scarecrows that are dead set on slaughtering and dismembering anyone that trespasses their fields and making their victims, scarecrows as well for all eternity.

Not long after, the rest of the crew land the plane not far from the cornfield, in search of Bert and the money with the intent to kill him for turning on them. However, they'll all soon discover that there's something far more evil than themselves, lurking in the fields that will do all the killing for them. Soon enough, the money greedy criminals will be fighting for something that not even money will be able to buy them; their lives.

Overall: After recently catching Scarecrows on TV, I can say that this is a very admirable forgotten horror film from the 80s. One thing I didn't like was the lack of a backstory on the scarecrows themselves. There's no information on how they got there, why they were put there, and why they choose to dismantle everyone that enters the field. On the upside though, nearly everything about the movie is just creepy--especially those darn demon scarecrows. The movie's atmosphere in general has a spooky, haunting presence to it. Dark, grim, and gloomy. That's one thing I feel a lot of horror movies--especially today lack, is how to make the atmosphere of a horror film look and seem like an unhappy place to be with a sense of no hope existing. It's probably best to watch this movie in the dark. The plot is very simple to follow and seeing that the cast--aside from one or two people consists of bad people, you won't feel too much sympathy for them when these scarecrows come to eradicate the very flesh on their bodies. Some of the kill scenes in this movie are bloody and in a way, clever, to capitalize on the overall theme of the film. Despite a low budget, a plausible plot; a haunting atmosphere; and some creepy as all hell scarecrows make this a must-watch film",1459641600,2,2774,4.75103734439834

The things the director chose to let go on and on and on (a girl pulling ""prickers"" from her long hair and examining them!) baffle me. Editor, please!

2697660,3,6301785398,"Is it any good?

`Scarecrows' is a forgotten B-grade little gem of a horror film that packs enough chills into an honest budget. The action is slow to start and the acting is terrible but the dark atmosphere, eerie scarecrows and tension between the characters makes this a better-than-average horror film. The main stars of `Scarecrows' are the scarecrows themselves. The make-up effects are used with simple but effective quality as the scarecrows ghoulishly hang on crosses with rag faces and tattered limbs. There is also just enough gore on hand to leave you feeling gutted...literally, as victims disappear only to emerge later cut open and stuffed with straw. What sets this movie apart from other 80s low-budget horrors is a plot that manages to keep you interested by refusing to hold your hand. The films creepy tone carries an element of mystery with it; only giving away small clues along the way. `Scarecrows' is a must see for any fan of low-budget 80s horror.

2697664,4,6301785398,"<strong>Scarecrows</strong> (William Wesley, 1988)

An above-average supernatural slasher that has achieved cult status since its 1988 release, <em>Scarecrows</em> has found new life with the proliferation of video streaming services; you can stream it online at both Netflix and Amazon these days, and probably others.

Plot: five marines--Corbin (prizefighter Ted Vernon), Curry (<em>X-Men 2</em>'s Michael David Simms), Jack (<em>Terminator 2</em>'s Richard Vidan), Bert (<em>Night Angel</em>'s B. J. Turner), and Roxanne (Kristina Sanborn in her only screen role to date)--hijack a plane containing the entire payroll for Camp Pendleton (I'm not sure what it was in 1988, but today, Pendleton has a population of about 100,000; that's a lotta scratch), kidnapping the pilot and his daughter, intending to fly to Mexico. Well, you know how these things go, and they end up having to abandon ship over a creepy cemetery on a farm owned by the Fowler family, who are a few bricks shy of a load, and have a pretty effective system for keeping people off the property--undead who masquerade as scarecrows. Once the marines are on the ground, it's all about survival horror.

To be fair, it could've been <em>more</em> about survival horror. Marines vs. zombies? How much fun could we have with that? Wesley makes it into a pretty straight supernatural slasher, and I reiterate that for a supernatural slasher it's not a bad movie at all, effective and tense and loads of fun. Wesley, who (as of this writing) has directed only one other feature, the 2001 Lou Diamond Phillips vehicle <em>Route 666</em>, had some interesting ideas and enough competence to pull them off. It's my fault, not the movie's, that I was looking for a steel cage match between Rambo and Bill Hinzman. Worth checking out, if you've never seen it and you're a fan of the genre. *** ",1335484800,3,1855,5.132450331125828

I was impressed being the movie takes place entirely over one night. Too bad the makers weren't able to deliver on a decent storyline. In fact, I recognized some themes in Scarecrows present in more contemporary Horror films (such as the scarecrows duplicating the voices of the robbers and the vines from 'The Ruins').

2697671,4,6301785398,"SCARECROWS is a dark and mean-spirited late-80's Slasher with a supernatural twist that generates successful scares and atmospheric suspense using a small cast and only a single shooting location. The film begins shortly after a daring robbery, when a group of elite military thieves become stranded at a remote farmhouse during their run for the border. As they attempt to recover their loot, the demonic forces at work outside in the corn fields set in to destroy them for their evil deeds. William Wesley creates a large feel to the cramped production by incorporating the soldier's hi-tech equipment into the storytelling. In slower expository moments when the characters become separated, the pacing and suspense are maintained over their radio headsets as their terrifying encounters are relayed over the airwaves. Wesley also makes use of their night vision goggles and rifle scopes in a number of first-person shots that are filled with frights! On top of the unique filming, SCARECROWS packs in a great deal of unexpected gore, with everything from a bloody decapitation to several dismembered limbs, a knife through the skull, a pitchfork through the hand, and several sickles through the leg. It also hits on several psychological terrors, where the mocking voices of friends and loved ones call to the soldiers from the darkness and lure them out into the fields. Later, the corpses of the fallen soldiers return to taunt their remaining comrades in order to drive them slowly insane. With creepy costuming and blackened sets, SCARECROWS drives home a constant feeling of dread and an unsettling mood. The film is only crippled by its short run-time and weak performances, but it ranks closely with INTRUDER as one of the better late-80's Slashers in the genre.

I wound up fast forwarding just to see the kills after 30 minutes of aimless wandering around and utterly ridiculous dialogue between the characters. I am not even going to go on about what the film is about, just that it was so extremely boring and uneventful that I wish I wouldn't have spent ten bucks to buy it because of the rave reviews.",1271462400,,378,4.573529411764706
2697673,5,6301785398,"I won't bore you with details since they are already mentioned here by others. But you will LOVE this movie if you like the Older 80's movies like Halloween, Friday the 13th etc. Movies back then were made for people that had Tension Spans of more than 60 minutes. People used to watch movies BUILD UP to the point of climax. In todays movies you get non stop action from start to finish. And to let you know in the Book ""Brave New World"" People were dumbed down and watched action only movies with nonstop action, so you have to wonder if people want nonstop action are their IQ's dropping? After all the average IQ is now 90, 80 was considered Moron level years ago.

That aside, you will love the movie, its slow and creepy. The acting is great for its budget, and you will actually like the characters. The girl was thrown in for Eye Candy and maybe to have the teenage girl audience relate to her. Even with its low budget, this movie blows away most of the Modern movies coming out today. Give it a shot you won't regret it! Most of the negative reviews are from people who don't like these type of movies, or have a tension span of a 3 year old.",1267747200,,1152,4.260273972602739

  The story is about a group of military criminals that steal millions of dollers and take a plane to head to Mexico. One of the guys 'Burt' gets a little selfish and takes the money and jumps out of the plane in the country with scarecrows.
  The film was made in 88' and I love those 80's horror movies. They are the best. If you like movies with creepy settings and scarecrows you will love this amazing movie. Pick it up today at amazon.",1264377600,,663,4.038167938931298

2697677,1,6301785398,"I cannot understand the rave reviews a lot of folks are giving this horrendous movie. Poor acting - amateurish, to say the least. Poor editing - for example, repeated and pointless cuts to a family photo, repeated and pointless cuts to a stuffed crow, none of which adds anything to the mood or the plot and is simply boring. Also, continuity errors galore - middle of the night, and yet a plane sits in a field over yonder in broad daylight; family photo cracked in one shot but magically mended in the next. Poor directing - I've seen two or three instances, ever, of effective use of slow motion - these ain't them. Incompetent sound design - inane use of voice over (for example, VO telling us about a farmhouse the character sees in the distance. Well, we see it too and don't need to be told it's there - just pointless). Amateurish screenplay - for example, one character sarcastically says of a decrepit farmhouse, ""It's the playboy mansion."" This is what passes for wit in Scarecrows. Nor is the movie scary or creepy, obviously a problem for a horror film. There are literally two interesting shots in the whole movie: the wind blowing through a harmonica that's lying on the ground, and a cool monster shot toward the end - certainly not worth the other 81 minutes and 30 seconds of your life that you'll never get back.

(And, BTW, none of the above has anything to do with the low budget. We have all seen great low budget horror - e.g., Carpenter's Halloween, the original Night of the Living Dead. Its low budget has nothing to do with Scarecrows' shortcomings.)",1252540800,4,1577,4.592198581560283

The movie then switches off to a group who stole some money and hijacked a plane and one escapes with the money in a field with scarecrows.

2697680,5,6301785398,"I was thrilled to discover that MGM had released this film on DVD. For years, it was only available on VHS and almost impossible to find. Apparently only very few VHS original tapes were made and if you were lucky enough to find it on VHS at all, it was on either a poorly made ""bootleg"" copy or a very beat-up ex-rental. Now it appears to be widely available on DVD and that is a benefit to all who enjoy a very good (although underrated) horror film.

This is a little known ""sleeper"" and although it is a low budget film, the atmospherics are terrific and the action...filmed entirely at night...is gripping. The plot is detailed elsewhere so I won't get into that, other than to say that this is one great and spooky film (and loads of fun if you enjoy the genre).",1224892800,2,768,4.333333333333333

2697683,5,6301785398,"A real, good, absorbing, creepy horror movie. Just the way I like them!
No silly attempts at injecting humour into it, which ruins so many horror movies today, but loaded with menace and atmosphere, and so what if the story itself is a bit preposterous? (Spirits of three long dead people living on by inhabiting scarecrows) It works! And that is the main thing.
The main premise of the plot is a group of robbers hijack a small plane and force the pilot and his daughter and their dog, to fly them away, but one robber bales out with the money and the rest go after him, and that's where the real story begins. I like the way that it's not all explained away and resolved with a neat, but boring, ending. The ending is great and most satisfactory. A must-see for all those who like a more in-depth horror movie with no real clear cut distinction between goodies and baddies and not one favoured over the other by the spooky and unnatural forces at work.
When I first watched it years ago, it was on a very dark vhs tape recording, seeing it on dvd for the first time (I have the region one version) was a revelation.
Great to see some of these old much loved movies getting dvd releases now.",1211846400,16,1192,4.349775784753363
2697684,5,6301785398,"I loved this film when it first came out on VHS here in the UK back in 1990 --- what could be cooler than a bunch of maniacal scarecrows roaming the woods in search of human prey?  A bit dated now, but nevertheless a good watch with a few jars on a dull evening.

What the general plot, then ---

~ A group of armed bank robbers in full military attire have hijacked a plane and subsequently bail out over a stretch of jungle, while the plane's owner and his daughter are forced to land nearby and wait.  They discover a run-down and abandoned wooden house and use this as a base of operations.  But it seems that they are not alone --- the neighbours are roaming the woods, scarecrows who crave human prey.  The money, it turns out, is blood money, although the act of revenge is never really explained.  Greed is soon forgotten as they are forced to make their way back to the plane ~

You could say dated.  Corny.  Badly-acted. Ridiculous in premise.  And you may be right.  Unless, like myself, you have been a fan of cool and creepy, dark and violent horror films since a kid.  If so, you'll love this film.

2697685,1,6301785398,"Let me start off by saying that I love all types of movies. I'm not a movie snob that needs a great cast of actors or even great acting. I seek a good story with some impact. I love great movies and I also enjoy movies that are so bad they are enjoyable. Unfortunately this one is just so bad that it's terrible.

It starts off with a plane full military thieves who are headed to Mexico with a sum of $3 million in stollen cash. Two of the crew jump out of the plane in the middle of a cornfield attempting to steal the already stollen money. The now infuriated crew decides to turn around and land the plane to persue their new enemies to only find a whole mess of scarecrows. Now despite the films poor quality I'm thinking it may have potential until I continue to watch. It just goes from bad to worse. They follow no direction at all. There isn't even any explination to the wrath of the scarecrows. It's as if they gave a class of 5th graders some paper and pens and asked them to come up with a horror movie. The scarecrows provide nothing in the scare department like I thought they would. I was actually rooting for everyone to get killed so this mess could be over with and the scarecrows would remain kings of the cornfield.

So as much as I wanted to like scarecrows I just couldn't. This was such a missed opportunity. The whole scarecrow concept is great and could be really creepy if pulled off correctly. But this one doesn't even seem to try. Even for a B horror this was so weak. Yet to this day I haven't seen a scarecrow based movie that was anything above 2 stars. The only great work containing a scarecrow was in an episode of Tales from the Crypt called ""Four Sided Triangle"" from Season 2.",1206576000,3,1715,4.257668711656442
2697686,4,6301785398,"This is a very effective horror movie that relies on shocks and thrills rather than grossing you out.

Even though it was made in 1988, it gives you that isolation feel of being away from civilization, and the horror of not knowing what's out there.  Great music by the way!

No extra features, not even a trailer, but that doesn't take the fun away.  If you have this on VHS, get the upgrade to DVD.",1199836800,4,444,4.25
2697688,5,6301785398,"This film is very creepy as other have noted.  While it may not be necessarily scary it is certainly one creepy little film.  The factors of the film that I believe made it the most suspenseful and creepy were the dark moody atmosphere and the look of the scarecrows themselves.  The premise of the film may sound a little cheesy, but I found the film to be much less comical than what others have noted.  The atmosphere of this glorious film is something that other horror films could only wish for.  The dark, brooding, and creepy atmosphere takes the film way past B movie status in my eyes.  Most of the horror film today could take a lesson from this film.  I find many horror flicks to not even be creepy(even though I love them), but I admit this film had me tensed a few times.  The atmosphere is what did it to me.  It makes you feel the dread that the characters must feel.  The film is bathed in this feel.  The pace of the film is quite a bit slower than most horror flicks.  That is something that is rare, especially nowadays.  The pace is perfect in my eyes.  Thats what makes the film more suspenseful. The viewer really has no idea when these scarecrows may attack.  Thats an annoying factor for me when I watch horror films is that I can almost always guess when the creature or antagonist may jump out.  In Scarecrows I really didn't know.

The look of the film is worth killing over.  William Wesley really put some effort in his film here.  His name is mentioned at least half a dozen times in the credits.  That tells me that he cared for the art he was creating.  It's nice to see that. What keeps the film from feeling too comical is the INCREDIBLE look for the scarecrows.  If this was made today the scarecrows would probably be in CGI.  That ruins horror films.  This is classic special effects and make-up.  The scarecrows are really just damn scary looking.  I absolutely loved the look they gave them.  When you place them in with the brooding atmosphere it is quite awesome and powerful.

The directing, photography, and score are all pretty top notch for a horror film.  The editing could have been a little tighter, but it doesn't really hurt the movie too much.  Is there gore many people ask?  If you're looking for Hostile or Saw type gore then no.  But there are some seriously well done  and pretty graphic scenes with a fair amount of gore.  I love gore when its called for, some films do not need gore(Halloween and Dead Silence for example), this film hits the just right mark.  Theres not too much where it goes over the top making it comical, but it certainly adds to the films creepiness.  Theres a few shots where I was amazed they did as well as they did and I cringed a little.

All and all I highly recommend this little movie for those who like horror/suspense films.  The films slower pace, dark atmosphere,  truly scary looking scarecrows, and a back story that it seems many didn't grab makes this an awesome horror film.  Loved it.  Even better upon second viewing!",1199491200,7,3018,4.434306569343065
2697689,3,6301785398,"It's certainly not horrible, but it sure is light on the gore. It's pretty much just a bunch of guys and a couple girls trompin around a cornfield, being attacked by 'living' scarecrows. There are a couple of good FX scenes, but not enough for as much time as we spend watching them walk the rows. The retrospective on this film, in the lastest Fangoria, is better than the movie.",1195776000,,380,4.442857142857143
2697690,4,6301785398,"""Scarecrows"" is one of those movies that I've heard about for years, and heard rave reviews for. Ever since I first heard about it back in the early 1990's, I've wanted to see it for myself. Unfortunately, it was such a rare and forgotten 80's horror flick that it was nearly impossible to find--except for unbelievably crappy-quality bootleg VHS tapes.

Now, though, it has been finally been remastered and released uncut on DVD! Once I heard it was coming back out, I was excited to finally be able to see it. And how did it rate next to over a decade of hype and desperation? It was, in a word: excellent.

The story is simple: a group of paramilitary robbers who've hijacked a plane and held a pilot and his teenage daughter hostage are forced to land in an isolated, creepy farm when one of their members betrays them and bails with the money. The thieves/soldiers and their hostages soon find themselves stalked on the abandoned farm by a group of evil, murderous living scarecrows. As creepy paranormal events begin to plague them, they must try to find a way to escape the farm and the murderous clutches of the monstrous scarecrows.

With a cast of non-stars and a limited budget, director William Wesley was able to create a spooky, frightening little movie that was unjustly forgotten in the wake of other gruesome genre fare. Sadly, he didn't go on to do much else. I could definitely have seen him become a John Carpenter/Wes Craven-type horror filmmaker. Anyway, with this film, Wesley is able to conjure a bone-chilling atmosphere of darkness and gloom (due to the whole film taking place at night). The story is simple and straight-forward--borrowing elements from slasher films, zombie movies, and robbery/heist action flicks, and combining them into a creepy, old-fashioned horror movie. The cast of unknowns is a bit amateurish at times, but reliable enough to create likable characters and generate some sympathy. The make-up and gore effects are pretty gruesome and unnerving, and the evil scarecrows themselves rank among the creepiest movie monsters to appear out of the horror genre. Complimented by a chilling music score, ""Scarecrows"" definitely hits all the marks needed for a spooky, serious horror flick. It's also notable that there's a sense of mystery surrounding the supernatural events and the nature of the killer scarecrows, which is hinted at, but never fully explained. The grim, downbeat ending is also a plus.

The only really disappointing thing about ""Scarecrows"" is the complete lack of extras on the DVD. Other than that slight misstep, I can't really say much bad about ""Scarecrows"". While it's not groundbreaking like ""Halloween"", ""The Exorcist"", or ""Night of the Living Dead"", it is an eerie little gem of a film, and it's great to finally have it on DVD. With a supremely spooky atmosphere, scary monsters, gruesome murder effects, and a tight, suspenseful storyline, it's definitely a must-see/must-own for horror film fans. Highly recommended!",1194912000,4,2993,5.016096579476861

Action-packed and scary supernatural horror thriller with atmosphere and splatter abound! the acting is quite average but the make-up and Scarecrow effects are great for it's time.

Sure, ""Scarecrows"" is another 80's slasher, but it's pretty inventive and quite creepy for a low budget flick. Instead of the usual ""teens in peril from masked killer"" flick so prominent in the 80's, ""Scarecrows"" actually has a unique story, aimed at an adult audience.

2697695,4,6301785398,"Cinematographer Peter Deming not far out of high school and already shot Evil Dead II one year prior to Scarecrows and now part of the Spectral Motion team (The Gravedancers, Blade: Trinity, Hellboy) and makeup artist Norman Cabrera do such an effective job that if you muted Scarecrows and just watched it would be scarier.  However then you'd miss such classic lines as ""I must have been possessed by demonic demons.""

Deming does a great job making the atmosphere eerie with the use of shadowy images and spooky photography.

Cabrera made simple but effective monsters out of the scarecrows.  In Fangoria's October issue Cabrera said director William Wesley asked him to {basically come up with something really scary and kept referencing John Carpenter's Halloween in the sense that the mask is simple but very frightening stating its much scarier for a creature to have a very simple face because you don't know what it's thinking} and Cabrera did just that.

The plot isn't so much to write about compared to the two strong points mentioned above.  A group of marine commandos commit a robbery on base and manage to get away hijacking a plane with a hostage pilot and his attractive daughter.  This happens instantly and soon after one of them gets greedy and takes the money and parachutes out of the plane into a field with freaky scarecrows everywhere on crosses and a eerie house that would feel right at home on Elm St or better yet the house in the Blair Witch Project.

The other soldiers parachute in and pursue him and when they find him they give him a sever beating which would kill most but doesn't effect him.  He seems to have superhuman strength, something happened to him in that field before they found him.  Eventually he is beheaded and the soldiers find that he has been gutted and is stuffed with the money in place of his organs.

I thought this was going to be one of those so bad it's good 80's horror films after being the cult pick in Film Comment this month and a special retrospective section in Fangoria as well but Scarecrows delivers scares and sticks with you later that night in the dark.

The acting is pretty bad and the lines are corny but the atmosphere and special effects far make up for that also pay attention towards the end when one of the soldiers who is losing it sends everyone out of the freaky house so he can wait for his friend to come back and come back he does even though we and he saw him be killed, great make up on that part.  Also saving some of the ridiculousness is a great concept and realization of one of the troops who says what if we didn't make it out of that robbery with all those bullets coming at us, maybe this is hell, if you were in hell would you know it?",1191888000,5,2734,4.498989898989899
2697696,2,6301785398,"yeah, so I like Horror films, and read all the reviews and hype about this ""forgotten 80's masterpiece"" or whatever, and I was sorely disappointed. The film was shot well, everything is dark, dark and pretty creepy, and the 3 or 4 scarecrows that actually move around look good and scary, but the flick is boring!  Nothing happens except some fairly bad acting, and there is little sense to things throughout.  The actors just cuss a lot, I mean A LOT, and end up sounding stupid as they just won't stop repeating themselves.  A real script would have helped enormously.  Some deeper things are hinted at but generally any chances to create real characterizations are totally missed.  The actors just run around in the dark repeating their motivations (ie: greed, looking for harmonica, looking for dog, etc), cussing profusely, going into the house, then leaving the house again and again, etc.  back and forth, until they finally all get killed.  A nice attempt, but obviously budget was an issue.  But hey, with a better script and a few rehearsals by the actors, this could have been a much better film.  The special effects and cinematography were quite good, and the gore/methods of demise were also good.  Hopefully this director has continued to work and improved upon his weaknesses, because he definitely has some strengths.
ULTIMATELY, IT'S ALL ABOUT THE WRITING (see X-men 3 and Spider-man 3 if you don't think bad writing can foul up something good - they'll change your mind.....)",1191715200,5,1494,4.892857142857143
2697697,4,6301785398,"I don't think I'm alone in saying that attaining this movie, along with a copy of The Burning, has been somewhat of a semi-quest.  Not a single Best Buy in my state (Wisconsin) had either, nor did any Sam Goody, Suncoast, Barnes and Noble or Borders; so I had to go the 2nd route and order it online (not even from Amazon, who said that the two DVDs wouldn't even arrive until early NOVEMBER!)

So, while I'm still waiting on my copy of The Burning, I watched Scarecrows, which arrived in the mail pretty quickly.

I didn't know what to expect going into it, 80's slashers aren't my specialty, so all I knew going into this one was that it was supposed to be

A) Incredibly creepy
B) Gorey (this is the un-cut edition, woo hoo!)

Well, safe to say I received both in a great amount.  Sure, two of the actors were trying, but this is a B-movie, so I let it slide.  The atmosphere was kept at an incredibly murky level, with a constant feeling of total dread.

And with all the generic slashers to come out of the 80's, seriously, there's one called Death Spa, come on people, it was nice to see something where the killers were more monsters than just some psycho with a breathing problem and a mask.

WHAT DO YOU DO? WHATEVER WILL YOU DO? If you've watched ""Wizard of Oz"" at least once, you already know the answer, but I'm gonna derive it for ya anyway: 1) scarecrows are stuffed full of straw; 2) straw burns 3) anybody got a lighter? Or a match?

Nobody does. Not one of the mercs ever smoke 'em if you got 'em. You'd think these guys would have some napalm, or chordite, or some matches, but no. So the Killer Scarecrows hunt everyone down & ruin everybody's tazoola. In the dullest, slowest possible way. The End.

Some defenders of this wretched palsied turdallito pinata defend it on the grounds that it is ""atmospheric"" & ""creepy"". That might be true, in that ""Scarecrows"" is atmospheric & creepy in the same way that a nursing home full of 80-somethings drooling & taking dumps on themselves is atmospheric & creepy.

If forced to watch this, do what the protagonists ought to have done: douse yourself with gasoline & light a match.

A gang of militaristic commandos hold up the Camp Pendleton payroll and hijack a plane for Mexico.  It looks as if they got away with over 3 million dollars when one of the men decides to jump out of the plane with the loot, leaving the others high and dry.  It's never that easy though, as he lands in a cornfield surrounded by creepy scarecrows and the others are right on his tail.  He finds an abandoned farm house in the middle of the field and a truck and attempts to make his escape.  Much to his dismay, he soon discovers why the farmhouse is abandoned, as the previous inhabitants are now undead scarecrows, and they are not happy about his intrusion.  Predictably, he gets caught by the scarecrows, gutted, and stuffed with the stolen cash.  The others arrive in the cornfield and soon meet the same fate.

Scarecrows isn't the best horror movie from the 80's, but it is better than a lot of other stuff released in that era.  The story is at times muddled, with the origin or reasoning of the scarecrows never explained.  Why, for instance, did the victims come back to life after getting stuffed?  Instead of pushing that angle, I would have liked to learned more about the Scarecrows and what their driving force was. The atmosphere was great though.  Is there much spookier than an abandoned farmhouse in the middle of a corn field?

I would give Scarecrows a solid 6.5/10 and it is a must see for horror fans. It wouldn't surprise me to see this be one of the countless remakes puked out by Hollywood.",1190160000,3,1536,4.521739130434782

The gang escapes by kidnapping a pilot and his daughter, and forcing them at gunpoint to fly them to safety. Unfortunately, one of the thieves decides to pull a D.B. Cooper and exits the plane w/ the loot! He lands in a tree on some remote farm. After dropping to the ground, he notices a small army of scarecrows hanging around. Meanwhile, his cohorts are searching for him, highly pissed off! Strange things begin happening as some of the scarecrows start to move about causing death and destruction. SCARECROWS is a nice, gory creeper w/ enough story to keep things interesting. Contrary to some earlier reviews, this is the unrated version, w/ all of it's decapitations, guttings, and various amputations intact. This is a fantastic halloween movie, and would make a great double bill w/ DEAD BIRDS, which is (sort of) an updated version of SCARECROWS, w/ a similar atmosphere of dread...",1190073600,4,995,4.893491124260355
2697701,4,6301785398,"Fantastic lost horror gem of the 80's finally gets its due on DVD!  Previously only available on beat-up VHS tape or an overpriced full-screen German import titled Paratrooper, MGM has blessed the horror masses with a definitive version for our collections!  The movie has a refreshingly original plot, which drops a group of ex-military robbers and murderers into the wrong field in search of their missing bounty.  A great unique script and really good acting (except the pilots daughter who is AWFUL) always makes me wonder why this film sat in obscurity for so long?  Although our main characters are all villians they have individual personalities and believable dialogue that keeps us interested in them and their plight.  Of course atmosphere, jump scares, and a generous and well done amount of gore is also included for our viewing pleasure (including a brutal face stabbing)!  If you are new to horror or are a horror buff starving for a truly enjoyable horror film (especially in these times of remakes and direct-to-DVD dreck) this is a can't miss.  Also make sure to pick up MGMs upcoming releases of the 80's classics From Beyond and The Burning.  For horror fans... Christmas comes early this year!",1189209600,15,1213,4.97029702970297
2697702,4,6301785398,"Yes. This is another of these scarecrow movies, but I have to say that it is one of the good ones.  I have this on VHS and have watched it a few times and still don't get bored watching it.  there is plenty of action and horror.  I don't know many of the actors and I'm afraid I don't go in for all this director stuff like a lot of you.  I watch a movie strictly for entertainment, and this one does that.  The story is good and the acting isn't too bad for a ""b"" grade movie but still enjoyable.  So if you are a keen horror fan then this is definitely for you.  But there is one scarecrow movie out there which I hope they will bring out on dvd, it is called ""DARK NIGHT OF THE SCARECROW"". with Charles Durning.  This is my favourite one for it has a great ending which satisfies your every whim through the movie.  I have it on vhs and have watched it many times never getting bored even though I know the ending, so if there is anyone  out there who knows about the dvd, let me know.  But definitely give scarecrow a go.",1186790400,15,1025,4.0
2697703,4,6301785398,"When direct-to-video horror films were a legitimate market in the 80's and early to mid nineties, thousands upon thousands of low or modestly budgeted movies flooded the market and squeezed themselves onto local mom and pop and mainstream movie rental stores.  More than often, these films would be all promise and no delivery, with glitzy artwork and enticing taunts from the ads and synopsis claiming that these films were full of true terror and unrelentling carnage.  About 80% of the time they were totally misleading.  Time after time we would be duped into watching some boring and/or heavily edited  time-wasters with so much left to be desired.  Then a movie like William Wesleys Scarecrows peeks out from behind the usual ""Satan's _______ whatever"" and the countless Slumber/Sorrority party slash and stalk.  So being jaded by the usual selection, I took a chance so many years ago and found a truly underscovered gem of fright flick.  William Wesley isn't an auteur by any means.  In fact his only other directorial credit to my knowledge is the passable Route 666 starring a washed-up Lou Diamond Phillips.  But Route 666 aside, with Scarecrows, Wesley does know how to deliver a straight forward horror tale with enough action, gore, suspense, and clever creature design on a low but not impoverished budget.  They just make them like this anymore. Oh and i forgot to mention that I liked this film so much that I kept the vhs copy I rented back in the day and just payed the full ammount because I knew i would never be able to find another copy.  I have shown this film to my friends countless times over the years and my tape is in pretty bad shape, so I am more than overjoyed that MGM is releasing it.  Check it out if you're a fan of old-school 80's horror.",1186704000,15,1776,4.693548387096774

2697706,5,6301785398,"The last time I saw this movie was about 15 years ago and I still remember it like it was yesterday.  The bottomline is they don't make horror flicks like this anymore.  One that is smart, scary and beautifully shot that any audience can enjoy.  Except for very young children of course do the gore.

The plot may be simple but the acting and depth of each character carries the weight of the movie.  Some of the images of the zombie/scarecrow soldiers with night vision goggles on will stay with you well after you watch it.  This movie proves you don't need heavy CGI to make a great movie.

2697707,5,6301785398,"This is just how a horror film should be made.  The fact that the 'Scream' series is known to just about everyone and this film is known by virtually no one shows what an unjust world this is. [sob]

I first saw it about 15 years ago when i was 14, it left a big impression on me and i always used to check video shows when i was browsing to see if it was available.  It never was of course, and then along came amazon...

If you think that a horror film should be about special effects and gore then you should probably leave this film alone.  If you think that atmosphere, setting, excellent acting performances (esp. from the guy who plays Curry) and a good story makes a horror film then i strongly suggest you invest some money in this film, you won't be disappointed.

Have to say my favourite bit is when the Scarecrows kill Bert and you suddenly realise that the voices that sound like the other hijackers taunting him are actually coming from the Scarecrows themselves.

""Put the gun down Bert, you're not going to hurt us.""

Just a brilliant film.",1145318400,12,1057,4.357142857142857

It has a vaguely interesting premise, but the characters aren't terribly engaging, the pacing is glacial, the death-scenes are way over the top and often unintentionally hilarious, and the characters often act against their own interests because of reasons. I can't really say if it was ""so bad it's good""; that's a very subjective thing. I didn't think so, but maybe I would have felt differently with friends and a bucket of popcorn to share.
One thing this movie does do well is the special FX; this predates CGI, so everything was practical, and is very realistic-looking.",1513728000,,623,4.831775700934579

8159140,3,6301785398,"I first saw this as a rental on videotape in the early 90s and am glad for the updated version improving its overly dark low-budget look. Other than that I have always liked this film's atmosphere, which works for me just as well as other posters say it DOESN'T work for them. A movie like Scarecrows only goes to show the great range of opinion found in the horror community, probably more so than in the mainstream. Its lack of a big budget did not hamper, and may in fact have enhanced, its ability to create an eerie scenario out of an old farm and its field full of scarecrows. It is not perfect, in that its ending seems hurried and not as climactically bloody as it could be - which may have been due to budget issues. But it works overall and should be a rewarding night's viewing for horror fans looking for something different.",1475971200,,837,4.371794871794871

It's actually pretty fun and they get a lot of mileage out of the scarecrow stuff. It's not a particularly smart movie or even particularly well made but there's a charm in the haphazard nature in which it's shot and edited. You got the feeling everyone involved was trying their best but didn't get a lot of takes giving it that raw feel that the best low budget films have.

The blu-ray is pretty good here. The image is clean and there's not any major issues with the print they used. It's worth tracking down",1466553600,3,640,4.378151260504202
