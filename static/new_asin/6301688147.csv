7813923,5,6301688147,"This is one of those movies that your children get a hold of and you wonder what on earth they're watching... the animation is horrible, the story line is ridiculous (a legend that must be fulfilled about a manxmouse being eaten by a manxcat), the voices are terrible and the soundtrack is even worse... but it somehow becomes a staple in the home library. Then they turn 20 (your children) and you weed through the videos (NOT a DVD) and send this one to the thrift store because surely they're not interested in it anymore, only to discover that they actually have remained QUITE attached to ManxMouse and will not cease harassing you until you hunt down another copy (since this movie is no longer being produced - probably because it's so horrible). I found one, my children are happy again, therefore, so am I.",1296000000,,815,4.627586206896551
7813924,4,6301688147,"The last time I saw this was when I was 10 years old, back in the good ole days of Nickelodean, back when they still had stuff like David The Gnome, Maya The Bee, Lil Bits, and Grimm's Fairytale Classics. I saw Manx Mouse when I was 9, so my memories of it are hazy. But the basic premise is a Japetto-like clay figure maker tries to make a Mouse for his daughter. He screws up and it comes out of the kiln looking more like a bunny. A fairy takes pity on the creation and grants him life ('nother Pinnochio paralell).
Manx Mouse leaves the shop to explore the world, he is captured and sold to a cirus, where he is almost eaten by a lion. There's some cut scenes explaining about some war between Manx Mice and Manx Cats, and how the last Manx Cat is supposed to eat the last Manx Mouse to end the feud. The last Manx Cat is found, and a spectacle is made of the event with a colleseum of ghosts demon things waiting for Manx Cat to eat Manx Mouse with a knife and fork. Manx Mouse goes along with it, willing to sacrifice himself to end a war. But Manx Cat doesn't want to eat him, and instead they become friends.

Wierd, but great, movie from the 1980's.
When children's shows were actually ENTERTAINING
Now its all flash animated bullcrap and Edu-Tainment.",1198195200,,1261,4.232365145228216
