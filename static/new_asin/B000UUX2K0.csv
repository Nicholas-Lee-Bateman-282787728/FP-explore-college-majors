It targets the whole body and incorporates cardio and toning so you get everything you need in one workout. Cindy Whitmarsh has tons of energy and is motivating, easy to follow and the time flies by. I recommend this program to anyone!!",1193529600,12,359,4.294117647058823

8214991,1,B000UUX2K0,"I love Cindy Whitmarsh's workouts from Exercise TV, but this DVD just wasn't challenging at all. I did all of the segments together and didn't break a sweat.",1325894400,3,157,4.642857142857143
8214992,3,B000UUX2K0,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

This workout was a little too easy for me since I was below my target heart rate zone for the most part.  I had to modify the moves to get my heart rate up (jog instead of march, use weights for lunges, substitute jumping jacks for recovery period stationary punches.)  Would have been better if one of the ""backup dancers"" were used as an optional advanced modifier for me to follow.  Speaking of the backup dancers, they were rather too smiley for me but others would probably not be annoyed and at least they were rather quiet (I prefer serious and silent to perma-smiles with whooping and cheering.)  Also, the music was useless.  Weak beat, moves not timed to beat, more of a distraction than anything else.  Backdrop was simple but interesting without being distracting.

Sadly, the terrible production quality seriously dragged down what could have been a decent workout DVD:
*There were two camera angles, camera 1 being somewhat blurrier than camera 2 which looked like a home vid cam on zoom.  Jarring transitions added more of nothing.
*Overall color saturation seemed a bit off
*Volume had to be upped from around 18 normal to 38 just to hear anything

Strangely with all the cons, I actually liked this workout quite a bit.  I would give a 4 rating if not for the video quality problems.  The instructor came across well (cued well, did not talk too much, etc.), the moves were simple but a good mix, and the 10 minute format is very versatile (I usually like to add on 10 or 20 minutes more of cardio to other workouts, depending how much time I have, and this makes it easy.)

I think this workout would definitely be worth a do-over --- fixing the con points, making it a bit tougher since it IS called a bootcamp (at least adding someone to show modifications for more advanced moves), and hire a more professional filming company to re-film!",1303689600,,1915,4.6301775147929
8214993,1,B000UUX2K0,"I would not recommend this dvd. I have a significant collection of workout dvds and this one is among the worst. Not challenging enough, poor instruction, and overall boring.",1266192000,,174,5.0344827586206895
8214994,1,B000UUX2K0,I have another of Cindy Whitmarsh's DVD's that I use 5 days a week (10 days to a better body) so I bought this one hoping it would be as good. But it is of poor quality and I didn't enjoy doing the workout at all.,1247270400,2,213,3.652173913043478
8214995,1,B000UUX2K0,"I was not impressed with this dvd, as a matter of fact it was down right boring.
That in it self is amazing to me, because I really enjoy working out with Cindy Whitmarsh.
I have purchased other dvd's by her and they where great.
Instead of raising my heart level, it nearly put me to sleep, by the time I got to the floor routine I was snoring.
I would not recommend this dvd, sorry Cindy.",1227052800,2,390,4.077922077922078
8214996,3,B000UUX2K0,"This wasn't the ""Bootcamp"" I expected it to be. Wasn't fast paced enough or hard hitting enough for me but it would probably be a good starter workout for someone else.",1214611200,,168,4.451612903225806
8214997,4,B000UUX2K0,"We found this moderately difficult.  Having done Denise Austin's Kickboxing boot camp, Bikini Boot Camp and one from australia - it has more repetition than we like.  Although, after one workout my abs really hurt, which is a good thing.  The ab workout on this (and the bonus 5 min) is very intense and after doing them once you know you've done abs.

I'd recommend it.",1201910400,8,370,4.5606060606060606
8214998,4,B000UUX2K0,The workout is very good.  Quite a bit of the weight work is done on the knees which I modify successfully by standing for it.,1197331200,3,126,4.04
8214999,5,B000UUX2K0,"Great workout!  It was easy to follow.  For those of us who refuse to join a gym, this is a great home fitness workout.",1195171200,6,119,3.9166666666666665
