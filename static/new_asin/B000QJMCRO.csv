8196613,5,B000QJMCRO,"The packaging of this is amazing. I mean there other ways to enjoy these series (manga, visual novel). Yes the anime is really at the bottom for a lot of fans but I love the design and the way it was made.",1451433600,,205,3.9047619047619047
8196614,1,B000QJMCRO,"Before I get bombarded with thumbs down, there is a lot that needs to be talked about.

While arc 1-3 is tolerable as pointed out in my last review, the same cannot be said for arc 4. In fact, I could even say DEEN did not care about the final arc of the question arc and just wanted to get the series over with. There are a lot of spoilers ahead for those who haven't read the visual novel or manga but there is a long list that this arc screwed up on.

1. The focus on Ange rather than the game board: This killed it for a lot of fans. Ange as a character is very interesting and important to know of the aftermath of the tragedy. However, it takes up more time to explain her backstory than to get on with the murders on the game board and her talking also seems to drag on in the meta world as well. Because there is so much focus on Ange's arc though, its safe to say this portion of the visual novel was done right but when you have 8 episodes left out of a 26 episode series and you spend more than half of the episodes (at least 5) on non-action scenes, then that's probably going to rub people the wrong way.

2. The introduction: While this wasn't a big deal, it kind of undermined the events of the third arc. Beatrice had just tricked Battler in a horrifying way in the 3rd arc and Ronove her butler goes on about how much she destroyed him and how Beatrice needed to cheer him up. The anime goes straight to showing Battler playing with the sin of gluttony making Ronove's words pointless because Beatrice didn't even think that long so her ""YOU TRICKED ME"" doesn't really make sense. This is followed by Battler being angry with her and saying ""Don't do it again."" In context it does make sense but in retrospect Battler didn't show that much anger toward her in the actual scene and they both laughed it off before he said those words (followed by a text saying Battler will be tricked again and again if she did that so he needed to tell her to stop now).

3. No Mortal Stampede in the background when Jessica and George fight in the magic world: They could put Worldend Dominator briefly in arc II as much as they messed up the Rosa and Maria scene at the end but they couldn't put Mortal Stampede?

4. Removing the Krauss vs. Goat scene: This entire scene while not important to the plot, actually shows that Krauss' group when escaping the cell had difficulties while the anime just shows them getting out rather easily. This really undermines how badass Krauss is capable of being (and this is one of the funniest scenes in this arc).

5. Piece Battler evaluating everything about the dead bodies: This is SO IMPORTANT. Like...the anime just lets Maria vanish after Battler got the phone call. And the visual novel clearly states Battler found her dead body (and its implied that she was poisoned). Battler then goes around confirming who died and Battler clearly states he could not find Kanon's body no matter how hard he looked. Again a verification of who was dead at this point of time is important because it allows you to limit the amount of suspects.

6. Battler vs. Beatrice: The most important battle in the arc was really done poorly. The battle was intended to be one sided but the anime made it seem like Battler was actually right with his guesses when he makes the blue theories...two words...SMALL BOMBS.

7. THE FINAL SCENE IN THE EPISODE. The conclusion of the episode. Yes this is a question arc but it doesn't leave anyone with good feelings. Battler doesn't show any sympathy toward Beatrice when she begs him to kill her. In comparison the game has his monologue about her before he decides to hug her. This is so important because it foreshadows what will happen in the answer arcs. So the series just leaves with Battler's declaration of figuring out who Beatrice is rather than a heartbreaking scene at the end seeing the pitiful witch.

And to add insult, there was hardly any red text that told you what went down in this arc so you're scrabbling at what happened unable to figure out who could be the killer because no one was confirmed dead (and only Piece Battler is able to confirm it near the end) and you're left with an arc that is a mess because Ange's character arc takes up the entire question arc.

So overall the last 8 episodes were terrible. Final verdict of the anime is 40/100 (with this portion being 20/100). You really are better off reading the visual novel or manga because arc 4 is just done so poorly for the anime that its really hard to recommend.",1399939200,4,4519,4.407673860911271
8196615,5,B000QJMCRO,"Instead of posting something for both box sets, I'm just putting it here.

Firstly, anybody who's contemplating buying this probably already likes the show, so I don't think I need to really cover that. For anybody considering getting into this show through this box set, at least be aware that Studio Deen never made the second, and concluding, season. Much like with Higurashi (or When They Cry), the first half asks the questions, and the second half answers them. Umineko When They Cry is only the first half. Studio Deen never saw fit to conclude this complex and intricate story. Nonetheless, the show is brilliantly written, directed, animated and sounded with an amazing soundtrack.

The boxes themselves are impressive work, each the size of a stamp collection yearbook. The products are of a high grade in their sturdiness and construction and the case file booklets make for some very interesting reading. Overall, if you are a big fan of this show, I would definitely recommend this product, even if it is a big costly.",1396742400,,1031,4.919540229885057
8196616,4,B000QJMCRO,"This is quite the unexpected, the usual anime archetypes are here but they have dark sinister secrets and are capable of monsterous deeds, well worth a look but be prepared to have your sensibiliies shaken.",1318204800,,206,4.914285714285715

8196618,4,B000QJMCRO,"Anybody who read my gushing review of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/When-They-Cry-Vol-1/dp/B001CFQO5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">When They Cry, Vol. 1</a>&nbsp;knows how impressed and excited I was with it.  Well, it's only volume 2 and the freshness may have already worn off a bit.  The first 4 episode story arc was one of most intense, disturbing, and satisfying works of animation I'd seen in some time.  An absolute must-see.  But on the 5th episode, time rewound and the story began again with the same characters (plus one).  I was extremely intrigued and figured there were two ways this could work out in an anime series that spans over 50 episodes.  Either we were going to watch different stories with the same characters in the same place at the same time with only the actual events changing, or they were going to build on that amazing story by showing it from different perspectives with different characters at different times and make it one huge, violent jigsaw puzzle.  This volume reveals the truth to be a little of both.

The first arc of the show focused on Keichi being apparently besieged by his new group of friends following the village's Festival of Drifting Cotton where one person each year dies and another vanishes. This disc's primary arc -which began with the last episode on the first disc- is more of a murder-mystery that incorporates supernatural elements that were previously strongly hinted at but not revealed.  This time around, Keichi's friends remain his friends (mostly) and the villain is kept secret until the end.  It is not nearly as intense as the first story, but it does hold your attention.  Sadly, there are some pretty over-the-top moments which start out frightening but go on too long and spoil the tension.  The third episode concludes the arc in classic horror form and the last two shows on the disc begin the next story.

[sigh]

As much as I like about this show, I'm not sure it can hold my interest for two full seasons.  It's still got my attention for now, but seeing the exact same story elements and characters over and over is bound to wear thin if future volumes don't get really creative.  One of anime's biggest pitfalls is some series' tendency to show the viewer the exact same thing over and over.  While adorable anime girls and brutal psychotic death is a combo custom-made for this sicko, even I've got my limits.  When the creativity runs dry, so does my attention span.

I'm writing this review specifically for those wondering if they should invest in this show.  Check out the first disc for sure.  The four opening episodes could easily be strung together to make one of the finest animated horror films of all time.  After that, it looks like it's going to be touch-and-go.  I enjoyed the second arc and the third looks to be from a very different perspective dealing with child abuse so I'm hoping that this show can get back to the quality of that first volume.  Some rather grisly secrets of the festival are revealed on this DVD and so are new aspects of some the characters which will apparently be incorporated into future arcs. It's a cool idea, but I know that restarting the series every four episodes is going to become irritating.  It's like a psycho anime girl&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Groundhog-Day/dp/B000Z8GZYW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Groundhog Day</a>.  I know I sound pessimistic, but this is still a strong show as it stands now.  But the fervor I felt following the first volume has definitely died down.  I'm up for more, but some of you (who may or may not be known as The Main Man) may want to approach this second disc and future volumes with caution.",1232496000,,3757,5.006441223832528
8196619,5,B000QJMCRO,"Absolutely, it is not suitable for any children. It is very violent and the contents are too horrifc, even though the characters are very cute, friendly and lovely. For small children and even teenagers, they can be badly influenced by the contents. It should be rated R.
There are many different stories which share the same people, place, theme and background of this anime. First of all, it seems to be, not any spiritual reason but solely the psychological problems of the people in the stories. The characters seem happy and peacefully live in a remote area. However, they are getting more and more scary as the story goes. If you have watched vol. 1, you must know the start of everything seems to be due to a protest against a dam construction project in the area. Apart from the news (people's doing, accidents, etc), the residents keep talking about the curse made by their god in their area. Honestly, I agreed in the manipulative action made by the residents. Besides, the characters look like they have some mental problems. In general everything is a mystery. After watching the second story, it kicks off the theme of the curse. I do not want to expose the result of this story. All I want to say is, if the police is not planning any plot or lying, then how come the ending is like this (about Mion)?? From this point, the mystery is getting more scary. I have watched vol. 3, new character is added. Things are getting more weird. But with some senses; I believe that it starts to shed some light on the murders and other incidents. This anime looks like a detective who is scheming several possibilities of a crime scene. I have been thinking of a possible explanation about this anime's setting. I am hoping to see vol. 4 to 6, the finale in checking if I am right or close to the truth. This anime is attractive because it can draw my attention to THINK of the scenario or image behind the stories while watching them.
This anime vol. 2 is discontinued.",1209600000,,1972,4.542134831460674
8196620,5,B000QJMCRO,"Parents take note this series contains very graphic violence, torture & twisted themes. As an adult, I love the series because is starts of like a silly Japanese anime but then turns into something very twisted and dark.

A great series, but should be rated R in my opinion, at least this volume. There is no real sexual content or profanity, but a lot of violence and very disturbing subject matter.

I highly recommend it, for adults though. It is really a great anime, in my opinion.",1186963200,5,486,4.574712643678161
8196621,5,B000QJMCRO,"I was hooked immediately with the first volume of this series - the unique storytelling style was a welcome change , and the plot twists kept the interest level and suspense high throughout the DVD.

I'm happy to report that this volume does not disappoint. Unfortunately, there are so many things that distinguish this as a unique and worthwhile series that can't be revealed without going into spoiler mode. I can only say that if you bought and enjoyed the first DVD, this is money well spent. My only complaint is that I have to wait until October for the next episode to be released!

Trivia note - My DVD had the episode titles correct, but the episode details actually corresponded to the episodes on the first DVD. I don't know if this has since been corrected by Geneon, but it was sort of interesting to see it hit the streets uncorrected so far.",1186876800,5,856,4.5519480519480515
