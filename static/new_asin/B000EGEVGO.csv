2517828,5,B000EGEVGO,My son who is 2 loves all of the John Deere for Kids movies.  These movies actually hold his attention for the entire video.  My Dad and my husband will watch them with Owen because they are entertaining for adults too.  We own all of the John Deere for Kids movies and can't wait for the next one.,1167782400,,298,4.103448275862069
2517829,5,B000EGEVGO,"My 2.5 year old loves this DVD and I actually enjoyed watching it with him too. He loves all the real footage of tractors and heavy equipment at work and I enjoyed learning a bit about the history of John Deere and the variety of equipment they manufacture. It's narrated by a young man (maybe 12 years old?) who does a really nice job and the musical score is catchy too. Definitely a good addition to our DVD collection. Also appreciated that they put all the previews for their other volumes at the END of the movie, just a nice touch.",1163030400,,538,4.336633663366337
2517830,5,B000EGEVGO,"My [...] LOVES these video's.  He knows all about every JD tractor ever made.  He watches them for hours and hours on end and learns something new everytime.  He will spot a tractor on the road and will name it everytime.  This is a great learning tool-not to mention when riding in the car he is so excitied about seeing ""large machines"" as he sometimes calls them!",1155945600,2,366,4.417910447761194
2517831,5,B000EGEVGO,My son is already asking for Part 4!  YOu can't get a better movie about John Deere.  What great movies!,1154476800,2,104,4.15
2517832,5,B000EGEVGO,"Our 18 month old loves the tractors and the songs. Great DVD we have all three. Yes, he can say ""John Deere"".",1147996800,,109,4.0
2517833,5,B000EGEVGO,"My two sons (3 1/2 and 19 months) love this video along with the first 2 in the series.  My younger son does not talk very much but he can say ""John Deere"" and will even point to them on the road.  The video is very informative and even the adults I've shown it to have been interested.  This video focuses on logging trucks, road graders, the first John Deere car, and much more.  The songs are very catchy (we also have the CD for the series)and are very original.  I would recommend this video for any child who is interested in farm equipment or big trucks in general!",1143590400,5,572,4.2110091743119265
2517844,5,B000EGEVGO,My 21 month old is OBSESSED with John Deere tractors. This is the ONLY thing that he sits quietly and watches in awe everytime.,1391472000,,127,4.333333333333333

2517846,5,B000EGEVGO,My two year old grandson loves this video.  He can watch it over and over again.  The best part is it is educational and not a cartoon!,1359849600,,135,3.962962962962963
2517847,5,B000EGEVGO,"My son absolutely loves this DVD and wants to watch it all the time. I really like the narration and how thorough he is in explaining things,and all the cool places they go and visit.",1357689600,,183,4.257142857142857
2517848,4,B000EGEVGO,"I purchased this dvd for my two year old son who loves anything with wheels, but especially trackers and larger trucks. Although it doesn't keep his attention the whole time, but not much does since he's only two.  He does ask for it by name and will now call out by name when he sees the different machines; and I have to say that I really like that he calls them by their names. I was hoping that it would focus on each machine at a time, but it's a little random.  The music/songs are cheesy, but tolerable.  It's a good dvd, but not great.",1352764800,,543,4.152380952380953
2517849,5,B000EGEVGO,"My 4 year old grandson has been watching these John Deere videos since he was 1 and has not grown tired of them. If you have a little boy that likes tractors, you can be certain this will be entertaining to him!",1294963200,,211,4.0476190476190474
2517850,5,B000EGEVGO,"Our grandson, Caleb, is a John Deere tractor fanatic.  We gave him the Part 3 recently for his fifth birthday.  He was watching it before the party was over!
We plan to purchase Part 4 for a Christmas gift.",1250726400,,206,4.256410256410256
2517851,5,B000EGEVGO,"My boys love tractors and have parts 1-4 of this series. Part 3 shows Johnny Poppers at work, how hard our ancestors worked to produce crops, antique cars & forrestry equipment. As a mom, this is my favorite one and I'm working on having my 4 year old son [and me] present it to the residents of our local nursing home. I'm sure they will love it as much as kids do!",1202342400,,366,4.097222222222222
2517852,5,B000EGEVGO,"We own parts 1 thru 3 and this one is my son's favorite so far.  He loves all of them, but I think the variety on this one is why he is so fascinated by it.  Not only does it show tractors, it shows old threshing/farm equipment, logging equipment, some roadwork equipment, and even a little segment on old cars.  Personally I think the music and narrator on this one aren't as good as on the first two, but anything that will hold a 22 month-old's attention for longer than 2 seconds gets my vote!",1174003200,3,497,4.2105263157894735
2517853,5,B000EGEVGO,"We have all four DVDs and my son, who is three, loves them (and my husband, too!)! He knows all the tractor models, names, the details of the tractors and more!  He will watch these John Deere DVDs over any disney cartoon any day.",1169942400,,230,4.2272727272727275

8109330,5,B000EGEVGO,My kids love these. I hold this series responsible for at least 50% of my kids obsession with tractors. We buy new ones every special occasion and they're just as mesmerized as when we bought the first one. Beware: you will sing these obnoxious songs every day.,1413849600,,261,4.574468085106383
