3509426,3,B001CDKQ8K,"I'm sorry, but I can't see buying this DVD for 7 episodes.
Maybe when it drops down to $14 or so it will make sense, but its not
like they have a bunch on unbroadcast episodes that I feel I must see.",1222819200,23,199,3.761904761904762
3509427,5,B001CDKQ8K,"This show was much better. At least everybody wasn't sleeping with everybody and they didn't look like cheap hookers. The show was great, they should bring it back.",1221696000,4,164,4.892857142857143
3509428,5,B001CDKQ8K,Quite the feisty little show. I loved the charisma each woman brought to the small screen. Definitely followed the runway flair of Sex and the City but had a more corporate focus and less of a sexual hunger. Glad it's coming back mid-season to finish off the first season at least. Hope there's more to come!,1220659200,13,308,4.517857142857143
3509429,5,B001CDKQ8K,I can't believe they took this show off the air!  It was close to being as good as Sex and the City.,1220572800,12,100,3.5454545454545454
3509430,4,B001CDKQ8K,This show a nice suprise. I had no idea of what I was getting into. Would be most likely considered a chick series. Must be my stronger female side for a guy and more sensitive to things in generall. It was a fun show and lots of ladies who have seen have liked it as well.,1454457600,,273,3.892857142857143

Thank you",1446681600,,27,3.5
3509433,5,B001CDKQ8K,I bought this because it was dirt cheap TBH.  But surprisingly it was so good and addictive.  Kind of like a more modern version of SATC.  I don't know why it got cancelled because it was so good!,1445472000,,196,4.105263157894737
3509434,5,B001CDKQ8K,Any production starring Julian Ovenden is exceptional.,1444953600,,54,6.857142857142857
3509435,4,B001CDKQ8K,"I actually liked this series much more than ""Lipstick Jungle."" I didn't find out this series existed until long after it was cancelled and I ran across it on Netflix. The characters were more relatable to me and frankly, I think the acting was better and the story lines more believable. There were even parts of it that I think were better than SATC. Netflix has nixed it and it's not on Hulu Plus or Amazon Prime either so this may be your only legal choice if you're interested. Too bad this didn't make it through 1 season though.",1444521600,,534,4.404040404040404
3509436,5,B001CDKQ8K,"I actually really loved this show - I wish it had been given a chance to grow into its own before NBC pulled the plug. Yes, it is inspired by Sex and the City but you shouldn't go looking for this show's version of Carrie or Samantha. The characters are quite different from those on Sex and even original, if I do say so myself. This show benefits from the talents in its leading lady Lucy Liu, who in my opinion, is a much more formidable actress than SJP ever was. And Liu's costars are each unique and quite talented in their own rights. My point is that all the comparisons that derided this show as a poor man's Sex and the City were unfair because I think this show had a lot of intelligent things to say about women, relationships, friendships, careers, and race, surprisingly.

My point is that these seven episodes packed a punch and went a lot deeper than most SEASONS of SATC. What a darn shame - the one time NBC took a chance on a smart series, they expected it to be a runaway hit like SATC and when that didn't happen they instantly pulled the plug. It's no wonder they've fallen so far in terms of viewership. I mean just look at them now. The only things they have going for them are the Voice and the Blacklist, and they are going to milk those cows until they are bled dry.",1441584000,,1293,4.234817813765182

3509441,5,B001CDKQ8K,Excellent goods all in a timely manner,1423958400,,38,4.571428571428571
3509442,5,B001CDKQ8K,I was a big Sex and the City fan so I was looking for something similar to watch after it ended. I enjoyed the show. I was disapointed their were no more seasons.,1362355200,,162,3.9393939393939394
3509443,3,B001CDKQ8K,"Quiet shallow albeit entertaining.  I have watched the first disc but the second one can wait. Not crazy about it, did not fall in love with any of the characters.",1343260800,3,163,4.433333333333334
3509444,5,B001CDKQ8K,"LUCY LIU IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTRESS ..I LOVED HER IN ALLY MCBEAL..SHE GIVES A STELLAR PERFORMANCE IN THIS SERIES(CASHMERE MAFIA) AS WELL.WHAT HAPPEN THAT THERE WAS ONLY 7 EPISODES .WAS IT CANCEL OR WHAT?

3509445,4,B001CDKQ8K,"I found this show on Netflix and instantly I was hooked.  After watching the entire season, I started looking online for more seasons and I was sadden when I found out that they only created one season.  I love shows like this!",1321488000,3,227,4.380952380952381
3509446,5,B001CDKQ8K,"A fun drama that goes through typical life happiness and sadness. For those of you like me who think Sex and the City is a little much and you want something to have on when your preteens are in the next room-- this is your show. It is a fun show that goes through typical lives of every day women, balancing marriage and work, love and work, divorce and life and friendship. It is a great drama for not a lot of money!
It is almost identical to Lipstick Jungle so if you love that show you will love this!",1292112000,,506,4.07
3509447,3,B001CDKQ8K,"Was really expecting something big, specially after seeing Sex in the City. Entertaining, better than Lipstik Jungle but definitly not the quality of Sex in the City!",1282348800,,166,5.185185185185185
3509448,5,B001CDKQ8K,This show is a bit different than sex and the city. I love both shows but especially love the character Juliet. Her way of dealing with Davis cheating on her was very IMPRESSIVE! I wish they never canceled the show. I really would like to see more.,1274745600,,248,4.297872340425532
3509449,5,B001CDKQ8K,i loved this series. i have watched it twice and will watch it many more times. i love how these women stick together and are in big business and run companys.,1271203200,,159,4.161290322580645
3509450,5,B001CDKQ8K,"As a diehard Sex and the City fan I avoided this series like the plaque fearing that I would be mortally appalled by another hackneyed rip-off. But I have to say I was amazingly surprised at how much originality and ingenuity this show has. The similarities are obviously there; four fashionably high profile women counting on each other to maneuver through a male dominated Manhattan, but where SATC focused on the women's love lives with their careers rounding out their identities, Cashmere Mafia is almost the opposite where it focuses more on the women's careers with their personal/love lives rounding out their identities.

Akin to other workplace comedies like ""The Drew Carey Show"" or ""It's A Living"", the majority of the story lines revolve around the protagonists' workplace and we're so intrigued by how they handle themselves at work, we are curious to see how they react after they punch the clock and go home.

It only lasted for seven episodes and I never caught a glimpse of it until after it was cancelled but now that I have I would strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys workplace comdies or shows with strong female leads. Outside of just about every scene with Caitlin (Bonnie Somerville playing an unbelievably ditzy marketing executive who gets caught up in boring plot lines that go nowhere up to and including questioning her sexuality in the DEBUT EPISODE... here's a hint, if we don't know you yet and the only people you find attractive and are kissing are of the same sex... you're gay, which isn't a problem, just don't be BORING and gay) the show actually does have some legs of it's own, and I very much regret that I won't get a chance to see where these women would have gone.",1267747200,8,1715,4.7324414715719065
3509451,5,B001CDKQ8K,"This was my favorite TV show when it was on the air and I was disappointed when it stopped coming on. This show is so chic and inspiring for the modern woman. These ladies are powerful, stylish and fun! I wish they would bring it back to TV!! I watch the DVD when I need a little 'diva' in my life!",1239926400,,298,3.901639344262295
3509452,4,B001CDKQ8K,It is a good series however I am not sure that the casting was the best.  It was also a bad decision to have basically the same situations than in Lipstick Jungle.,1233792000,,163,4.09375
3509453,1,B001CDKQ8K,"I can't believe so many people liked this show. The four main women were as interesting as dry, plain toast. Nothing can beat Sex and the City and Lipstick Jungle was more realistic as to how me and my girlfriends lead our lives here in Manhattan. We can relate to the women of Lipstick Jungle than the four dry pieces of toast from Cashmere Mafia. I'm glad it's over. I hope for it to never return. I couldn't stomach another over the top dramatic moment with that uptight, tight lipped Julia Draper. If it does return, I won't be wasting my time. I'd be more entertained by watching paint dry.",1233619200,4,595,4.418181818181818
3509454,5,B001CDKQ8K,"Frankly, I enjoyed Cashmere Mafia MORE than Sex in the City. The women in Cashmere Mafia were portrayed as strong, independent women with real problems.  Their loyalty to one another in the face of adversity and through everyday life was refreshing to see.

UNTHINKABLE that they only gave this terrific show SEVEN episodes!",1231632000,3,324,5.09433962264151
3509455,4,B001CDKQ8K,"I loved this show, and was really sad it wasn't renewed. The updated characters were much more realistic than SATC but still rocked the couture.  Two of the women are executive moms, and from Zoe locked in the closet trying to have a conference call while her kids run wild, to Miranda's spot-on commentary about the tension between her type and the stay-at-homes, I thought the series was an excellent update from the ""40-something but still buying shoes and renting a studio and sleeping around and not sure if I want to get married blah blah blah"" of SATC.  Cashmere Mafia showed you can be educated, act your age, have a career, have kids and still look fabulous.  Juliet's character is the best by far - she brings depth and feeling to a role that could have gone brittle and frigid.  Although my favorite line goes to Lucy Liu while ripping an Alexander McQueen scarf off her ex-fiance's girlfriend, ""Enjoy the bounce!""  I LOVE that these are intelligent women who think on their feet and excel (for the most part) at their high-powered jobs rather than staggering around trying to find the front door like Carrie at Vogue.  Maybe that's what killed it - people didn't want to believe it was all possible...",1230595200,11,1213,4.671361502347418
3509456,5,B001CDKQ8K,"i loved it

3509457,1,B001CDKQ8K,Awful. Just awful. The only thing going for this show is the wardrobe but that doesn't justify how expensive the series is.  THERE IS A REASON THAT THIS SERIES WAS CANCELLED FOLKS AND A GOOD ONE AT THAT.,1226620800,2,203,4.342105263157895
3509458,4,B001CDKQ8K,"At first, the reason that I watched the show is because of Lucy Liu. I love her when she was in Ally McBeal, as Ling.

After the first episode of C.M., I was hooked & loved the strong bond among the girlfriends. C.M. focus on a different stage of the women's life & the craziness to balance the career & family in a big city.",1226102400,3,325,4.0
3509459,2,B001CDKQ8K,"for women who love fashion, this is a video fashion mag.  The writing is terrible, but it's worth it to watch Lucy Liu walk out of her closet 3 times a day looking like a work of art!",1225411200,5,183,3.8157894736842106
