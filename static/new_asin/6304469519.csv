7872041,1,6304469519,"The singing is fine, Pavarotti in particular. But the acting is very bad from all concerned. And the production is incredibly overproduced. The costumes are ridiculous and overdone, like a Halloween costume party on steroids. The scenery is not just bad, it is horrendous. Most of the scenes look like a child's painting of the desert. And the triumphal march is anything but triumphal. The stage is full of large, heavy looking, shifting Egyptian monuments. It consists of slaves being forced to work by a platoon of guards, while the chorus tries to avoid being crushed by the monumental moving scenery, and the principals are brought in on chariots which look like floats in Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. This is by far the worst Aida that I have seen on dvd. The dvd of the Domingo/Metropolitan Opera production is much better. And the Pavarotti/San Francisco Opera dvd is very good.",1365465600,,889,4.933333333333334
7872042,5,6304469519,"I have to confess I have not watched much of Verdi so I do not have enough knowledge to compare and contrast. I also was watching sub titles the firt time through. Looks like I will have to find a different production and hope it is just not Giuseppe Verdi I find band. I know this 1985 but it has a 60's feel.

This presentation seems a bit bland. But Stefania Toczyska made a splendid Amneris and kept you in your seat wanting more.

Do not let me discourage you from watching as everyone needs to know the story and especially find where they extracted the Act 2, Scene 2: ....Triumphal March from.

7872043,5,6304469519,"Great production.  Luciano is to fat for a Radames; but then, he starts singing and we stop looking at his figure and listening at that unique voice!",1362873600,,149,4.518518518518518
7872044,3,6304469519,"As the lead reviewer already pointed out, this is the reissue of a film already issued years ago on VHS and DVD (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verdi-Aida-Maazel-Chiara-Pavarotti-La-Scala/dp/B00002NDLW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verdi - Aida / Maazel, Chiara, Pavarotti, La Scala</a>), documenting a performance given at La Scala in 1985, in the production of Luca Ronconi, with the Radames of Pavarotti, the Aida of Maria Chiara and the Amneris of Ghena Dimitrova. It isn't exactly the same cast as on the CD-set recorded around the same time, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verdi-Aida-Chiara-Pavarotti-Dimitrova-Nucci-Burchuladze-Maazel/dp/B0000041S0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verdi: Aida / Chiara, Pavarotti, Dimitrova, Nucci, Burchuladze, Maazel</a>). The principals are the same, but on the DVD Nicolai Ghiaruov replaces Paata Burchuladze as Ramfis (who in turns becomes the Pharaoh in the place of Luigi Roni), and Juan Pons is Amonasro instead of Leo Nucci.

The difference with the previous DVD release is that the new one now comes with a bonus DVD, from 1988, a 78-min program on the making of Aida, with commentaries by Pavarotti, Grace Bumbry, Renata Tebaldi, Carlo Bergonzi, Eva Turner, a section with brief vocal excerpts from Aida featuring Enrico Caruso, Emmy Destinn, Eva Turner, Aureliano Pertile, Ebe Stignani, Beniamino Gigli, Giovanni Martinelli, Renata Tebaldi, and Grace Bumbry. Scenes from the performance are also shown with commentary about them.

In all honesty, I haven't seen it. I have seen and reviewed the previous release. Whether it will give incentive to the potential buyer to go ahead with the new release is, of course, his choice. I refer to my review and the many other ones under the entry for the previous release. By almost universal consensus it seems, the singing of the three principals is great, the production and filming provide no reason to want to see this more than once, and maybe even less than that (even if the specific reasons may vary). I differ from the general consensus in liking, in fact, the lack of any acting of both Pavarotti and Dimitrova - if you consider that ""to act"" is to move around the stage and make faces. I consider that Aida is vocal theatre, not ""theatrical"" theatre, and I find the very small expressions on these two's faces far more expressive and intense than any facial antics by some of their esteemed colleagues on other DVDs. I also differ from the general consensus in finding Maria Chiara as Aida unbearable to watch, with over-expressive, cheaply melodramatic and redundant gestures, as if she was trying not to imitate but to caricature the actresses from the silent film era - so unbearable in fact that it comes in the way of my enjoyment of her singing. So as long as I'm going to shut my eyes to listen, I might as well buy the CDs instead. The bonus DVD here gives me no additional incentive.",1349395200,,2968,5.380645161290323
7872045,3,6304469519,"This is a video of a 1985 La Scala performance of Aida with Luciano Pavarotti as Radam&egrave;s, Maria Chiara as Ada, Ghena Dimitrova as Amneris, Juan Pons as Amonasro, Nicolai Ghiaurov as Ramfis and Paata Burchuladze as the King. It has been released several times before:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verdi-Aida-Maazel-Chiara-Pavarotti-La-Scala/dp/B00002NDLW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verdi - Aida / Maazel, Chiara, Pavarotti, La Scala</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verdi-Pavarotti-Chiara-Dimitrova-Ghiaurov-Pons-Aida-1985/dp/B0017KZ7TQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verdi / Pavarotti / Chiara / Dimitrova / Ghiaurov / Pons - Aida (1985)</a>. And it is a pretty good performance hampered by a production that has elements of gigantism (and I don't just mean Pavarotti, who is indeed as large as he ever was in this production), left-wing commentary about imperialism (lots of poor slaves suffering), unnecessary humongous statuary that the poor slaves have to keep moving about, naked women (in the opening of Act II) followed by naked Nubian boys. The singing is impressive all round.

However, the draw for this particular package was supposed to be the contemporaneous South Bank Show (BBC, hosted by Melvyn Bragg), entitled 'Ada File - The Making of Ada', which unfortunately has great chunks of untranslated (or un-subtitled) Italian by such personages as Carlo Bergonzi, Renata Tebaldi, Pierluigi Petrobelli and the production's director, Luca Ronconi. Why there are no subtitles or English voice-overs I have no idea. But there you are. Frustrating in the extreme for this monolingual American viewer, I can tell you.

If you understand Italian this package might be for you. Otherwise I'd suggest, if you're interested in owning this particular production, that you buy one of the less-expensive versions without the documentary.

Running time: Opera 160 mins, Documentary 72 mins; Sound: PCM Stereo, Dolby digital; Opera subtitles: German, English, French, Dutch, Spanish; Format: 4:3; Region Code: 0 (worldwide)

7872046,3,6304469519,"This performance of ""Aida"", despite from other reviews say, has a great production, The scenario is Wonderfull.
Chiara is a great performer of Aida, with that dark powerfull voice of dramatic soprano, her acting isn't great but is better than Pavarotti's or (most of all) Dirmitrova. I never seen a woman moove so little on stage. But the worst of all is the ballet in the triunfal march there isn't any ballet!!.
Vocally I find this performance great, but in matters of acting isn't that good.
The Orchestra is perefctly displayed here, Maazel does a great job.
I would rate with 5 stars If I would be thinking in the voices and the orchestra but If I had to rate acting I would put 2 stars. I keep with 3 stars",1021680000,,712,4.442748091603053
7872047,1,6304469519,"If you want a good Aida video, get The Met version with Domingo and Millo, Zajick, Milnes and a fantastic production from begininng to end.  This La Scala version is almost funny it's so bad.  The singers just stand like statues staring at the conductor - not even an attempt to act the roles or relate to each other.  The sets are comical and the costumes off someone's old rack.  Unless you are a real fan of the cast members (Pav is in good voice doing his concert schitchk, arms outstreched, eyes closed & the usual ""don't you just love me grin"" on his face;  Dimitrova stiffly swoops and screams her way through, eyes glued to the conductor; Chiara has poses and so-so voice with -0- emotion). Too bad The Met isn't available on DVD.  I have tape and LD.  Even on tape, it's better than this version.  Boring is the word for this performance.  Verdi would not approve!!
