7846503,4,6303431496,"Like the Bowrey Boys Movies the Francis movies were strictly for fun, and entertainment and very much a product of their times.  Kids, myself included, loved them and the Francis Movies also came out about the time that most Baby Boomers, especially the girls, were going thru the I-Love-Horses phase.

Unlike the ""Lassie"" films, if you went to a Francis Film you knew you would not have to bring your hankies--Francis was nothing except tough and self sufficient.  Francis was droll, abraisive and did not tolerate fools gladly, and he always had a sassy comeback.

The hardest part of being an actor is doing comedy, and the hardest part of that is playing against animals and kids.

Mickey Rooney, like the wonderful and talented Donald O'Connor was superb at both, and while reams have been written about his singing and dancing in the (much better reviewed) Judy Garland films---you have to see him glide his leading lady across the floor in the beginning of this film.

The scene will never make a ""That's Dancin'"" movie, but it is worth it just to see real dancing!  The only thing unfortunate about these lightweight little films that were heavy weights with talent is that being named Francis (or Frances) was a killer to carry to grade school at that time.",1343433600,4,1266,4.779816513761468
7846504,5,6303431496,This item was a discarded library copy and it was in very good shape.  The movie itself was great and there wasn't a flaw in it. Kathy,1233187200,4,134,3.962962962962963
7846505,5,6303431496,"When I met Mickey Rooney, even he said, ""Terrible picture.  Terrible picture.""  I can appreciate that this was at a low point in his professional career and yet his performance is wonderful, the plot breezy and the sets and lighting are moodily gothic.  Add Richard Deacon in the supporting cast and you have a Francis entry that rivals even ""Francis Joins the WACS"".  I think many had a hard time getting past Francis having a new sidekick- no Donald O'Connor.  I wish this were on DVD!",1008547200,11,487,4.616279069767442
7846506,1,6303431496,"This final ""Francis the Talking Mule"" opus features a different leading comic (Mickey Rooney), a different director (Charles Lamont), and even a different voice for Francis (Paul Frees). All are usually capable of  good comedy, but they can't do much with an unfunny script. There's a good  chase climax at the end, but you have to sit through the first hour to see  it. Not worth your time unless you have to have all the Francis movies. Try  an older one first.",944611200,7,463,4.609756097560975
