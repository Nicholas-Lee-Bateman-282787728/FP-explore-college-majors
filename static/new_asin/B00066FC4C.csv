8039185,4,B00066FC4C,a strange and unusual serial killer mystery.  although a fine actor the main character his/herself a very stupid character.  the character's stupidity almost took the fun out of guessing who the killer was.  the film was finely made and the direction  was as good as the locations used.  all the lesser roles were above par.  a good watch.,1522886400,,339,4.758620689655173

8039188,3,B00066FC4C,"I've read the other reviews and I don't get it.  This is a very, very bad ""B"" movie, complete with bad acting, (watch for the Bo's 'agonized' scream when she is given the urn containing Johnny's ashes), bad editing, and more plot holes than you can shake a stick at.  It is, therefore, hilarious.  For those of you who love silly, bad ""B"" movies, rent it and have a good laugh. For Gods sake, don't waste your money buying it.",1191715200,,426,4.3
8039189,4,B00066FC4C,"The aria from Donizetti's 'L'elisir d'amore' plays a significant role throughout this fascinating, intelligent, well made thriller by Francis Girod based on a novel by Brigitte Aubert and adapted for the screen by Girod and Philippe Cougrand.  'The secret tear' takes on many meanings as this complex story set in Brussels unfolds in the same manner as 'Diabolique'.  Only this film takes even more risks and succeeds resoundingly.

Presented as simply the main character instead of an oddity, transsexual Bo (Robinson St&eacute;venin) works as an entertainer in a drag club in Brussels.  His best friends are other transsexuals, especially Maeva (William Nadylam), who perform with him.  Some are also prostitutes and are falling prey to a serial killer who disfigures each of his victims  in a vicious way.  Bo, we learn, left home at age 13, unable to cope with sexual  molestation from his father (Marcel Dossogne) and the suicide of his mother, and lives quietly in a humble apartment. Her interest is peaked when a handsome young Johnny (St&eacute;phane Metzger) moves in next door and she fantasizes an affair with him.  While Johnny appears to be infatuated with Bo, he has his dark side, living with a roommate with whom he provides sexual services for older unattractive but rich women.

The police, headed by Huysmans (Richard Bohringer) investigate the serial killings and in some way Bo is always at the scene or is familiar with the victims.  The story revolves around the cat and mouse game of surveillance and complications of information regarding the killing spree.  An interesting sidebar shows Bo's father arrested for sexual harassment and Bo is interrogated by the police about his childhood traumas with his father.  How Bo weaves through all of the events - longing for Johnny, attempts for a consignation with Johnny which teeters on the possible versus the sadistic, gay bashing, gaining courage to speak against his father, etc - is the maze the story pulls us through. The identity of the serial killer is successfully revealed at the very end of the film.

The excitement of the suspense drama is heightened by Girod's stunning direction and by the completely convincing acting of Robinson St&eacute;venin, but also by the superb characterizations by Richard Bohringer, St&eacute;phane Metzger, William Nadylam, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Pellegeay, Ginette Garcin, St&eacute;phane De Groodt, and Charlie Dupont. The musical score by Alexandre Desplat is one of this fine composer's best, and the cinematography by Thierry Jault finds just the right flavor of the seamy streets of Brussels to make the story as creepy as it should be.  So with all this praise why only 4 stars for the DVD?  The subtitles (the film is in French) are so out of sync with the film that they completely destroy the important conversations, so much so that many times the subtitles are finishing off a scene that is no longer on the screen!  If these were corrected it would be clear to everyone why Robinson St&eacute;venin won the French Cesar Award for best actor and why it is such a success for the daring director Francis Girod.  Highly recommended...just be aware that the English subtitles will frustrate you - unless you speak French!  Grady Harp, January 06",1138492800,5,3271,5.091760299625468
8039190,5,B00066FC4C,"Set in the demi-monde world of the transsexual community in Brussels, ""Transfixed"" is an unusually understated, understanding and accepting film. Director Francis Girod has utilized the serial killer/thriller genre to maximum effect as he aims his camera at the risky world of transsexual prostitutes and entertainers.

Girod is not only interested in the built-in sensational aspects of this story but also the whys and the wherefores. Bo (Robinson Stevenin), a transsexual entertainer is very attracted to his shady neighbor Johnny (Stephane Metzger) who resists to a point, hostile even, yet only hostile enough to keep Bo interested. It's the old story of wanting something that you cannot have.

On top of this, there is a serial killer loose bent on killing Brussels' transsexual prostitutes. And Bo, through compassion and necessity is determined to find out who is committing these atrocities.

All of this might seem to be too much weight for one film to bare, but Girod is not only interested in the bizarre, he is interested in what makes all these diverse characters tick: what is at their core selves, what are their real natures.

""Transfixed"" is strange and bizarre and far-fetched at times, but director Girod pulls it all together with his knowing and intelligent eye: he examines these people, he takes them apart physically and psychologically but he does it with a loving and compassionate eye.",1097193600,31,1414,5.1615720524017465
