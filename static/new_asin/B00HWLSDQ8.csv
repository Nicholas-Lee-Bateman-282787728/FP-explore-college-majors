6240475,4,B00HWLSDQ8,"Nice premise, and very sweet.  I don't remember the last time an American romance barely involved kissing!  The ending was a bit abrupt, and could have been better.  Still, a great introduction to immigrant lives, and specially Arab/Lebanese immigrants in Detroit.  The two lead actors were excellent, and let's hope for a bright future for them.",1395619200,,346,5.125
6240476,5,B00HWLSDQ8,"Having been raised in the Detroit area and especially around the arabic communities I found this movie to be an excellent walk down memory lane.  Had a great mix of humor that covered the many cultures in the area and the story line really hit home for me.  It brought back a ton of memories to talk to my wife about so she could get a clearer idea of my upbringing.

Great cast of actors in this one too, really felt quite polished for an independant file.  5 stars, well worth watching.",1394668800,3,488,4.271739130434782
6240477,5,B00HWLSDQ8,"Accurate, funny portrayal of an unrecognized part of Detroit. Sweet and serious. Can watch even if you're not from the area",1394323200,2,123,4.904761904761905
6240478,2,B00HWLSDQ8,It was disjointed. Cute in spots. Hard to follow.  I would not recommend it.  Stupid story line.  Too ethnic for the general public.,1393804800,,132,4.6521739130434785
6240479,5,B00HWLSDQ8,"I picked this movie because it's newly out on Amazon Instant Watch and it looked lonely and in need of a review.  I'm glad I did.

The story starts rather tragically with the violent death of the patriarch of a Lebanese-American family.  Now, the son is forced to put all his own plans on hold and stay behind to run the family business instead.  Anything more than that would constitute a spoiler so there I stop with plot-summary.

To the positive side, the story is a great allegory for being who you are, and pursuing your dreams despite the expectations put on you by others.  Further, I'm a cultural xenophile so I was extremely entertained by the details of Arab-American culture and the interplay between that and the larger urban culture of Detroit.  It's also amusing to see the complex role of the neighborhood gas station in an area.  In short, this was a great slice of urban ethnic anthropology.  If nothing else you can love it for that along with the strong visual symbolism.

To the negative... this isn't really a complaint I had but I could imagine that some might be concerned that there's not really a lot of movement either in plot or in character in this movie.  The entire action could have taken place in a day and the characters don't evolve so much as suddenly come to their senses.

In summary, a great little film to watch with someone special.  It has enough tidbits to keep the viewer entertained, a few small laughs along the way and a hopeful and uplifting outcome.  Great film.

PS: It is always my endeavor to provide helpful reviews. If you find my review helpful then great! If you do not, then please leave me a comment indicating what you want to know and I'll be sure to do better next time.",1392595200,20,1731,4.503205128205129
6240480,5,B00HWLSDQ8,"I really enjoyed Detroit Unleaded. The two main characters played by EJ Assi and Nada Shouhayib had great chemistry and I felt like they actually enjoyed working with each other. The other characters also interacted well with each other in a very warm and familial way. I thought that the film could have been really blunt about pushing womens issues on the audience but the female characters were funny and multi-dimensional and there was no annoying ideology vomit to speak of.  Aside from the chemistry of the cast, I thought the cultural elements in the film were great. The use of bits and pieces of the Arabic language in the film really made it feel authentic - like I was a member of the family. At once I was able to identify with the main character wanting to leave the inner city and do something more while I could also sympathize with his mother who needed to hold on to her traditional values to stave off the loneliness she felt in a new county and new culture. I could only imagine that many members of the American audience would be able to empathize in the same way and, for me, that is the mark of a good movie.",1392595200,3,1130,4.4326923076923075
6240481,4,B00HWLSDQ8,"This film set in metro-Detroit looks at times like it was done on a shoestring - but that never stops it from being professional. A romantic comedy at its core once it gets up and running, the movie also does a nice job throwing in elements of poignancy, grief, and sentimentality to ensure we don't have just another run of the mill slapstick comedy.

The three main Arab-American characters are all trapped by something in their lives.  The young male lead who inherits his father's gas station is figuratively stuck inside the clear plastic bullet-proof cashier's cage put up for his protection. He wants to leave and move to California, but he needs to take care of his mom so he puts his dreams on hold and settles in. His potential girlfriend is trapped by her overly protective/mentally abusive brother and some traditional cultural norms, unable to openly date the owner of the ramshackle gas station and begin to live her own life. And his widowed mother is stuck in a foreign country, unable to drive, and unable to move on from a closet full of black clothes meant to be worn for solitary mourning. With her son working 18 hour days she is isolated more than anyone else in the film.

Sounds like a comedy, no?  Well it is, getting progressively funnier as it goes along, aided not just by the strong young leads but several quirky character actors, such as an unofficial parking lot manager ""employee"" who may or may not be on drugs and a wheeling and dealing cousin who tries to make money selling pirated DVDs and cheap plastic roses. Their performances build over time, and when the belly laughs start they catch you by surprise.

People from Michigan will enjoy the references to Faygo pop, 12 mile road, and Fordson High.  But you certainly don't need to be from Detroit to like this movie.

As long as you don't mind slightly grainy film in some spots or set your expectations too high, this is a great film that in the end only suffers from a little bit of what at first appears to be an overly happy ending. But as sweet as freedom is, it will also have a cost, something the innocent couple will end up learning soon enough. The movie lets them enjoy it while they can. 4 1/2 stars.",1392422400,7,2203,4.534005037783375
6240482,5,B00HWLSDQ8,"I recently saw the film Detroit Unleaded and I cant stop thinking about it! The director, Rola Nashef, successfully made a film that beautifully handled tough issues by combining comedy with heart. The way the mothers grief was portrayed was extremely well doneher story made me cry and then made me smile. The relationship between Sami and Naj was sweet, subtle, and not at all like many of the romantic (for lack of a better word) relationships in movies today. But by making their relationship about something moreabout breaking free from a life you don't want, about trying to follow your dreams to someplace betterthats what made this rom-com stick with me and why I cant get it out of my head. I highly recommend this film to anyone and cant wait to see it again once it's out!",1392249600,2,783,4.640287769784172
6240483,4,B00HWLSDQ8,"Enjoyed the lead characters and their developing relationship; found the female role especially well played and entertaining.

Have you already watched Casablanca, Love Story, Ghost, Romeo & Juliet, Shakespeare in Love, Love Actually, Ben Hur, Gone with the Wind, and The Princess Bride and want something equally as moving??? Then watch this movie. There's love, gas, hot arab chicks, culture, and the underlying theme of which all immigrants to this country have had to struggle...how to live in both cultures.  But seriously, if you're arab, latin, east asian, indian, etc, etc.....you'll identify with the movie.  Watch it today!",1455494400,,719,5.136752136752137

6240495,4,B00HWLSDQ8,"In all, an excellent movie.  I really enjoyed the location shots in both Detroit and Dearborn.  Of all the African American characters, only one wasn't portrayed as a ""typical 'hood dweller"" and I felt that was unfortunate.  Lots of African American people live in ""the 'hood"" and don't complain every time they purchase something, or act foolish, or gripe about the price of gas.  Also, the ""white fright"" that was portrayed was a bit overblown (the idea that whites and Arabs need to ""drive fast and ignore the lights"" in Detroit were overblown.)  The cultural struggles were portrayed realistically, however, and the ""upgrades"" that Mike kept adding to the station were great.  That stuff is in EVERY gas station in Detroit.  Product placement was cool...I dug the local love for this film.  Very much liked this film overall...I think those aspects I found somewhat objectionable were in no way intended to slight anyone.  Especially if you're from Detroit or the Metro Area, watch this film!",1453680000,,996,4.987878787878788

6240497,5,B00HWLSDQ8,"If you loved the quirky indy movies Clerks1 and 2  this movie will bring fresh echoes of the same genre. You can recognize a similar mix of unrepressed humor and youthful naivet together with tough reality bites.
On a more time sensitive level - watching this film at the end of 2015, I am reminded of how good we had it in America. No, it was not ideal, but as far as striking a balance between assimilation (or integration) with the greater society on one hand, and preserving your ethnic/religious identity on the other, it has been pretty remarkable in the U.S. Especially when it comes to individuals, being able to form their own balance between the two.
How much have changed since 2013 (when the movie came out) and the end of 2015? At this time, things seem quite bleak as far as inter- faith relations in the U.S. Fear and suspicion threaten to morph into racism and paranoia. Donald Trump have just suggested to ban all immigration of Muslims into the U.S. and he has quite a large following. I have to wonder if a movie like this would have been made today.
Perhaps not, but I do believe that the healthy genes of Democracy and the high regard to individual liberties (clearly taken as given in this movie), will prevail over fanatism or fundamentalism. I am not a Moslem, but I stand in support of the thriving Muslem community in the U.S. Inshalla - God willing, we'll see more original work of the kind I saw in this movie, thanks to Rola Nashef (the director) who also participated in writing the screenplay with Heather Kolf and Jennifer Ginzinger.",1449619200,,1565,4.569395017793594
6240498,5,B00HWLSDQ8,Excellent,1446249600,,9,9.0
6240499,5,B00HWLSDQ8,"This is another indie film on a shoestring budget with the most unlikely of directors: Rola Nashef is a [seemingly] middle-aged Arab-American female director who has made this film about Arab-American immigrants trying to make it in Detroit, one of the most blighted urban areas in America.  The two main actors are the young man E. J. Assi and the woman Najlah Shouhayib, who meet because their families are both Egyptian.  Assis character Sami is running a gas station with his cousin Mike [Mike Batayeh] and Nada goes to work with her brother Fadi, who is trying to run a cell-phone store.

Mostly this is a romance story, but the streets of Detroit give it the feeling of people living on the very fringe of existence, barely scraping along day to day.  In a short bonus feature the director says she really loves Detroit and it gives her a sense of freedom.  She admits one sees a lot of destruction around, but one also sees people trying to rebuild communities.

My wife felt there wasn't enough action in the film, but the frequent scenes in the gas stations store gave it a frenetic feeling to me.  The city is violent enough that the cashiers sit behind bullet proof glass and exchange items for money through small trays, like a bank teller.  But unlike a teller, their small work area is also crowded with 1,000,001 items that people may come in asking for.  Every time the door opens, the chime of a bell announces another customer, and all attempts to have a conversation are constantly interrupted by the chiming bell.  Another safety rule is that they never exit their bullet proof cashier area into the rest of the store unless the front door is locked and no customers are inside.  Yet a third safety rule is a loaded revolver inside the cashier area.

If that isn't enough, another challenge to their attempted romance is Nadas brother who treats her almost like a wife [or a slave] and definitely doesnt want a gas station clerk dating her.  And yet another is an apparent class difference between them, she giving the appearance of having come from a wealthier family than Samis more humble origin.

And then theres Moslem morality.  Egypt may not be quite as strict as Saudi Arabia, where I recall a princess of the royal family and her lover beheaded for adultery some years ago, but even so, any physical contact between the sexes outside of marriage is considered scandalous.  The physical attraction between this couple, with no actual touching, was palpable, felt real and far more sensual than most American romance films with bedroom scenes.

For an independent film and a new director, this was a genuine success.  Definitely worth watching.",1436832000,,2671,4.75704989154013
6240500,1,B00HWLSDQ8,We didn't like it. Shut it off in the very beginning.,1436745600,,53,3.909090909090909
6240501,2,B00HWLSDQ8,"i really wanted to like this movie because i'm from Detroit and have friends that own or work at gas stations.  Though the movie accurately depicted the day-to-day goings on, it just wasn't funny.  i got so bored with it that i didn't watch it in one sitting, and i wasn't even going to finish watching it but decided to try to give it a chance hoping it would improve.  It didn't.  As far as the romantic relationship of the main character, the movie didn't show anything of why they were initially attracted to each other at all.  It was like they just out of the blue were suddenly boyfriend and girlfriend.  It just had a weird feeling for me.  Some movies take a few minutes to get into, and you feel a bit outside of the story until it pulls you in.  This one left me feeling outside of the story through to the end...pretty much because there was no story.  Like others have said, it felt more like a documentary but with a lot less explanation than you would expect from a documentary.  My main disappointment, however, is that i was expecting a comedy and this movie literally only made me laugh once and it certainly wasn't a belly laugh, it was barely a chuckle.",1431475200,,1173,4.364055299539171

It is a good look at the highways and byways of urban America. I've often wondered what life might be like at a service station.

6240516,3,B00HWLSDQ8,"I picked this film basically because I've lived in SE Michigan my whole life and so thought 'hey, Detroit' and checked it out. If I didn't live here I'd honestly likely give it only 2 stars. The characters/actors work well together with the couple in the film having good chemistry and the the rest of the cast believably portraying the comfort with each other of real life family and friends. The plot, however, moves incredibly slowly, or even more appropriately (as another reviewer put it) doesn't actually move at all. What would be the build-up and big reveal, the 'tension moment' as it were, was certainly believable, but a little too true to life in the way ordinary people just aren't all that interesting to watch. The ending did surprise me but was still somehow anti-climactic; again I think it is just a matter of 'real life' people just not being all that interesting. Even in movies where actors and directors are attempting to portray 'real people' there's still some sort of Hollywood drama there, some build-up and release; I think this film falls short in that it did such a good job of playing 'a typical day in the life' that it forgot it also had to be a movie and find a way to captivate the audience while keeping that true to life feel.",1408233600,2,1262,4.588495575221239

8636961,1,B00HWLSDQ8,"This movie depended on stereotypes to further its flimsy plot line. You can have a movie set ""in the hood"" without being derogatory. The added ""lost white girl"" who was told to ""drive fast,"" the several times 'you people' was used to refer to the blacks in the film, and even the depiction of main characters relies on stereotypical Muslim anecdotes. I expected something more like Little Mosque that focuses on Muslim life without berating the viewers with what life already berates us with. Thanks for a wasted time.",1494460800,,518,4.831460674157303

8636963,4,B00HWLSDQ8,"This film is a valuable portrayal of this community and its place in metropolitan Detroit. SE Michigan has the highest concentration of Arabs in the USA, but the area has been free of the kind of conflicts that have plagued Arab communities in Europe (especially France). Even so, like so many immigrant communities in the US, Arab-Americans have faced the challenge of deciding what aspects of their culture to keep and what to give up as they integrate into the wider American society. Meanwhile, life in Detroit presents unique challenges of its own. This film skillfully presents this social milieu in all its complexity. The story itself is a bit thin and the resolution a bit too easy, but this film is still an engaging slice-of-life that humanizes Americans (Arabs, Moslems, and maybe even Detroiters in general, to some extent) who are too often seen as ""Others"" by their compatriots.",1483488000,2,893,4.96

8636967,4,B00HWLSDQ8,"A delightful movie about members of the Lebanese community in Detroit. Or rather, working life in a Lebanese-owned gas station. Or perhaps, dreams for a different life by some Lebanese in Detroit. At any rate, after a few ups and downs, the movie ends just as it should. 3 1/2 stars",1477267200,,282,4.549019607843137
8636968,3,B00HWLSDQ8,"Nice look at the trials and tribulations of a young man and woman who are part of the Lebanese-American subculture in Detroit.  The story is not all that interesting, but the characters depicted and the mores of said community make it a fairly interesting flick nevertheless.",1477180800,,275,4.978260869565218
