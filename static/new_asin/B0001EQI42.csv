1994543,3,B0001EQI42,"CURSE OF THE KOMODO is not one of the worst movies I've seen, in fact it's a lot better than some of my colleagues avow.  However, the problem is the script; it takes too much time with dialogue when we should have more komodo action.  Tim Abell, usually fun to watch, underplays his role so much he comes across as bored.  William Langlois as the responsible scientist isn't gung ho enough; Melissa Brasselle and Gail Harris are almost interchangeable and don't seem as frightened as they should be; Jack Logan looks great in his muscle shirt, but he needs to work on his acting abilities.  It's derivative and incoherent, but the special effects are actually pretty good 95% of the time.  I found it entertaining, worth a rental at least.",1089590400,2,740,4.661538461538462
1994544,1,B0001EQI42,"I'll only hype up the few fine points in this one.  Russ Meyer style woman, decent CGI Komodo Dragons.
OK I will also include what this movie lacks.  A good screenplay.  ""Curse of the Komodo"" should be called ""Curse of the Dodo,"" as in Dodo bird because this film is dumb and completly lacks everything that makes a good movie, except for the Russ Meyer type of ladies.  O ya there is a blatant nude scene just because there can be.  The nude scene is the pretty long and enjoyable to watch.  Beware, watch this only for laughs and please don't expect much of anything.",1088035200,3,569,4.371428571428571
1994545,1,B0001EQI42,"There is an island where scientists are running studies and tests in the hope of increasing the world's food supply.  What makes the scientists dumb?  1) They are doing the experiments for the Department of Defense.  2) To reach their goals they are creating giant Komodo dragons (one of nature's greatest consumers).  3) A military test is run on the island and they are defeated by the dragons and the scientists say the experiment is not ready for that stage (how does this increase food supplies?).
The general in charge has to make some tough decisions regarding the project.  The scientists in charge return to the island (why weren't they there to begin with?).  To complicate things, some civilians in the form of casino robbers arrive on the island.  They robbed an unusual casino, one that was thriving but had a parking lot completely empty except for their getaway car.
The Komodos are in charge of the island, there is no fuel for the electric fence (really just a series of sticks with lights on top) and the scientist's daughter is also his niece (small glitch in the script there).  The trick is to get off the island without being eaten, being infected by the Komodo's saliva, or getting blown up by the military.
One thing that I will say in favor of the movie and that is the ending was better than I expected.  The real ending that is and not the closing teaser.  This one is really only for film gourmands or possibly at a party.",1084924800,9,1450,4.5852713178294575
1994546,3,B0001EQI42,"This film, and it's ""sequel"" Komodo vs. Cobra, should be seen together. It raises the humor value. No, they aren't great films, or even very good, but they do have quite a bit of humor. Take Paul Logan for example. I recognized him right off the bat as a porn actor. In this film he's a crook, Drake. In the sequel, he's Major Frank, a short-lived victim. Glori-Anne Gilbert and Ted Monte are also in both films. And of course the house is in both, along with the poorly done cgi(?) Komodos.

Know what I think? I think they took a crew to Hawaii, made a couple of films and stayed around to do some porn as well. Just my opinion.

The best thing in KVC was Michael Pare. What a great voice, and oddly, he was there for comic relief as well as heroism.

Anyway, both films are about a 3, just for the humor, T&A (in this one) and comedy. There are identical lines between the military general and his foil in both films. In conclusion, good Saturday fare, and at a decent price.

1994547,3,B0001EQI42,"This is one of the very few flicks that I know that contain a Komodo Dragon as the monster. It was quite good for its standards. Like many people say in their reviews, if you do not expect to much you might enjoy this kind of movies. But one of the many things I do not like in these kind of movies in general its the out of place nudity. I do not really see the need to put this kind of stuff in these films. And even though there are many other issues, I'm not going to list them (maybe because I would not finish). As for the CGI, its not the best but I have seen worst.",1215216000,2,573,3.823529411764706
1994548,3,B0001EQI42,"Its a fun movie to watch bad animation Giant Komodos attack and eat people. Its fun that they are stuck on an island with a whole bunch of em. But the film does nothing to truely draw you into the story. but its fun.

A Group scientists are working on a formula to increase crop growth throughout the world to feed countless starving. The bad thing is they were contracted to do it by the US department of Defense. What does that tell you. Thats right, they want it as a weapon. They begin testing of its properties on animals, namely, komodo dragons. And it works but the komodos get out and begin a raign of terror on the island and our heroes are caught in the middle.

Its your basic Low-Budget Cable film. Crappy CG, a plain story and pletty of gore. But its not one you will really love. But i do suggest renting it at your local store if your a fan of this type of film.",1211932800,,877,4.152941176470589
1994549,4,B0001EQI42,Its an unoriginal film with a few fun features. 1. Giant Killer Lizards 2. Large Island full of (See One) 3. Lots of Corny Action. a fun filled sci-fi cheapy.,1210723200,2,158,4.3
1994550,4,B0001EQI42,"Usually when I wait a long time to see a movie my expectations build up so much that I end up hating it when I finally see it.

(Somewhere along the line I got the impression this was more-or-less a zombie movie featuring a large Komodo dragon, and while there are some zombie-esque ...rabid... poisoned people... for lack of a better term, their part in the movie isn't that big.)

This time, in spite of waiting 18-19 months, I really enjoyed it. At the time I wasn't sure I even wanted to watch it. There's a lot more character depth than I normally expect from this kind of movie. There's some small details I liked too, like early on in the movie people actually RELOAD their guns.

I think the giant komodo dragon itself was very cute, but I think all giant reptiles are very cute, so that's not really saying much.

Admittedly, the movie could have worked without giant komodo dragons, rabid poisoned zombie people, etc. There's been many movies with sharks, many movies with crocodiles, and so on. I think komodo dragons could have been ""milked"" more before resorting to gimmicks like that. That's why I give the movie four stars. It's one of my favorite movies, but I can see it has a few obvious flaws.",1203379200,2,1212,4.52054794520548
1994551,1,B0001EQI42,"Just one geneticly engineered komodo dragon goes around a small island attacking people, either eating them or turning them into zombies (I'm being completely serious here).

 There's almost no gore, below average acting, writing, and special effects, and some uncalled for, not to mention out-of-place, nudity.

 Stay away if you don't want to bring yourself 92 minutes closer to death. Life is too short for cruddy movies like this.",1146355200,,434,5.246376811594203
1994552,1,B0001EQI42,"Absolutely the worst plot - OK, maybe tied with Solarbabies as the worst plot ever.

So let's get this straight. You're a genetic scientist, you get your secret governmental funding from some upstart Navy commander who pays for your project out of petty cash and that empty coffee can next to the bottled water, you create giant carnivores to feed the world, left your daughter trapped on a deserted island with afore mention beasts for a meeting that you could have used your 1920's era two way radio for, power the ""electric fence"" and your only defense with a Honda generator the size of a shoebox, just happen to keep extra guns and explosives in that old shack a few miles away, know how to assembly any weapon but cant hit the broad side of a barn, just happen to keep some grain alcohol on hand for those downtrodden commando helicopter pilots that stop by for brunch, and you cant wait to sacrifice yourself to save the love of your life.

Right...... It all becomes so clear now.",1117411200,13,988,4.544943820224719
1994553,2,B0001EQI42,"This film stinks, there is just no way around it. Nonetheless, I had to give it two stars for incredible creativity in the face of overwhelming adversity. Truly, this is an amalgam of about five different concepts all put together in a blender. The plots concern (in rough order of importance): a military operation headed by a brilliant scientist and his daughter/niece (there seems some confusion on that point in the script) to grow giant komodo dragons the size of school buses alternately for military operations or as a food source to feed the world's hungry (Ponder.); a bunch of dimwitted casino robbers who serve to chew the scenery and in turn be chewed by the komodos; a government conspiracy plot having to do with bombing civilians; a couple of would-be love stories that go exactly nowhere; and a confusing object lesson about the importance of good transmission maintenance in helicopters.

Of course this mostly takes place on a deserted island inhabited by CGI lizards, and takes us past brief glimpses of beautiful waterfalls and pointless nudity that is so utterly predictable, yet illogical, as to be totally laughable. The computer generated lizards aren't the worst I have seen, honestly; and to be frank, some of the acting isn't too bad (I'm thinking of the scientist and the helicopter pilot here.)

The film is entertaining in a silly, B-movie manner. It is really not high in production values (I am especially fond of the use of obvious stock footage and sticks with lights on them representing an electric fence) but is fun in a quirky, schlocky kind of way.",1115856000,13,1587,4.895910780669145
1994554,1,B0001EQI42,"Fake blondes, fake boobs, fake broad--and a realistic-looking reptile that's treated so unrealistically that the characters appear to be shooting at a theme-park dinosaur!  Thousands of rounds are blasted at the behemoth without it sustaining a single nick.  The firing goes on and on, as though the director is struggling to fill an allotted time frame.  (Other snail-paced sequences include a bra-less, cavorting babe and a macho mesmerized by an overflying aircraft while a copter offers a quick sprint to survival.)  The viewer's sympathies are bound to veer toward the beast, which somehow manages to gulp down the hapless without squirting out a drop of blood.  And then there's the germ-zapped zombies who pop up like actors who stumbled onto the wrong set.  The creators of this miserable flick should have let the mostly competent actors simply ad lib the whole production.  Then, no doubt, the audience would have been spared the absurdity of an is-something-wrong? line in the midst of a  life-or-death debacle!",1105488000,4,1022,5.189024390243903
1994555,1,B0001EQI42,"""Night of the Komodo"" poses quite a few questions to the viewer, like what is the bigger thing in this movie, the Komodo, or the breast implants adorning the female stars, or could it be the false eyelashes also found on our damsels in distress? Another question posed; is red an actual eye color? The hero/head casino robber/muscle bound star looks like he just finished toking up before each scene and his eyes were the bloodiest part of this lame flick. The storyline is assinine, a doctor supposedly trying to create giant food, mistakenly creates these giant Komodo dragons instead, chalk that one up in the ooops column. I should have known better than to buy this turkey, but it was only $2 used, so once again I was subjected to a direct to video, ""hey guys I borrowed my brother's camcorder let's go make a movie"", lame excuse for a film. You know your in trouble when the movie begins and it's shot on video and not film!!! Avoid this thing at all cost!",1094515200,3,963,4.508571428571429

8011478,3,B0001EQI42,"Mostly, the ""stupid"" part was where they fired volley after volley of ineffective bullets while standing in the open.  The beast would have realized early or not noticed and had a meal, or the people should have gotten smarter and found different weapons.  My guess is that those extended shooting scenes were time fillers.  I'm assuming then it was a B movie but it was still fun.",1418601600,,381,4.656716417910448
8011479,4,B0001EQI42,"Project Catalyst was meant to be used to increase the food supply; however, an evil naval commander had other plans for it........(insert maniacal laughter)..........as a weapon.  (Still don't get how that would work.  Airlift a giant man-eating komodo and drop it on the `enemy'?)  Naturally, things get way out of hand so the evil naval commander, fearing discovery of his illicit use of funding, decides the best way to deal with the problem is to just bomb it out of existence.  He confesses his treachery to a subordinate, while admitting he is knowingly killing anyone who's anywhere near the problem site.  (Hardly seems practical to confess you want to kill any and all witness while you're creating another witness.)  Oh well, best laid plans and all that.  Time for a mass exodus from the island of doom.  Complicating matters are a bunch of crooks fresh off a heist and forced to land on the island of incredibly large carnivorous critters.  With few options, flee or die in a bombing raid, everyone heads for the only means of escape, a chopper that won't carry everyone.

Some mighty peculiar CGI and some mighty peculiar `actors' don't help a recycled plot that allows for nude bathing while a monster roams the island.  (Let's just say that not everyone was a scientist with an alarming misuse of brain power.)

However deficient in artistic merit, this modest effort still manages to entertain on a very basic level.  It's also unintentionally funny.  (I made the mistake of watching Komodo VS Cobra first, then couldn't understand why they remade that movie into this version.  Other way around, but essentially the same plot for both.)",1410393600,,1653,4.9169675090252705

8011483,5,B0001EQI42,"Seriously how can anyone not love this movie? It's one my standard go to's to recover from a bad day.

I won't even go into the giant mutant Komodo dragon who runs like a fat puppy trying to catch a ball. The continnutity errors and just bizarre choices alone are fun enough for most viewers of this type of film.

1. Zombies, just kind of thrown in on whim with no particular explanation.

2. The innocent naive scientist daughter-Tiffany- Played by giant implanted bleach blond Glori-Anne Gilbert, star of movies like ""The Witches of Breastwick"" and the Breastford Wives"", looking maybe ten years younger than the guy playing her dad.

3. The Scientist with the heart of gold (who never thought his project of creating giant Komodo dragons for the Navy would ever be used for destructive purposes) Cocking his bolt action rifle every 2nd, 4th, or 5th shot, depending on mood.

4. The never ending flask- a tiny bent up flask that would maybe hold 4 ounces of liquid being passed around and somtimes held upside down between parties and never running out of liquor.

5. Nearly every member (even MALES) wearing fake nipple pokies under their T-shirts for a trek through the hot jungle.

6. The ""Animal House"" freeze frame ending of the evil Navy Officer.

Seriously if your the type who enjoys this type of movie (and would you really rent ""Curse of the Komodo"" expecting ""No Country for Old Men""?) this is the height, of low budget, fun movie making.",1326844800,,1452,4.688976377952756
