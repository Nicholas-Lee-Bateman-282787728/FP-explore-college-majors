Our favorite is ""One Lone Coyote Howling at the Moon"". When I ordered this video for my Daughter it said it would take up to 2 weeks for it to show up but it only took approx 4 days to arrive. Was amazed and impressed with the speedy services.",1332028800,,417,3.9176470588235293
1656125,5,B00005RRG1,My  2 year old son saw a Wiggles video at a friends house so I ordered this one to see if he really liked it and he loves it.  We watch this and another Wiggles almost every day.  He dances and follows along!,1308441600,,208,3.7906976744186047
1656126,5,B00005RRG1,"This was the first Wiggles video I ever saw, when my preschooler got it as a gift way back in 2002. Even after 3 more kids and a dozen Wiggles videos, many of the songs on this one are still our favorites.  I have been singing ""The Morningtown Ride"" as a lullaby for almost 10 years now. :)",1305072000,,290,4.0

1656132,5,B00005RRG1,I think this is the best of the Wiggles videos. It's really neat to see Australian singers who usually sing to adult audiences sing and interact with the Wiggles to child-themed songs. A huge warning to all adults - these songs will stick in your head and you'll find yourself singing them in the shower if you're not careful! You've been warned - these songs are seriously addictive. :-) My 4-year old keeps asking for this DVD. Would definitely recommend it.,1242777600,2,460,4.691358024691358
1656133,5,B00005RRG1,"This was a gift for my grandaughter, she is a huge wiggles fan. The price was fantastic and it came quickly. I am very pleased with this purchase.",1231718400,,146,4.25
1656134,5,B00005RRG1,"My personal favorite of the wiggles videos. Taba Naba is especially nice, if you have to listen to the same video over and over, like we do here. I also enjoy Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport and Six Months in a Leaky Boat.",1221955200,,217,4.069767441860465
1656135,4,B00005RRG1,"The Wiggles, four Australian men with musical talent and training in early childhood education, put on a great show for youngsters. They get the kids up and moving! All the Wiggles VHS and DVD movies are popular at this library!",1217030400,,228,4.725
1656146,4,B00005RRG1,"This DVD has lots of songs with international singers, which i really like because some of them are in different languages.  It adds some variety to the usual Wiggles music.",1209254400,,173,4.766666666666667
1656147,5,B00005RRG1,"This video is lots of fun, with some upbeat new songs that are fun to dance to, featuring people like Rolf Harris and his ""Tie me Kangaroo down, sport"" and Christine Anu with ""Taba Naba"". These are songs even my husband and I can sing along to (but don't tell anyone). My kids pick this one more often than most any of their other Wiggles videos. It doesn't have any of the ""classic"" Wiggles songs, like ""hot potato"" or ""fruit salad""...but it has plenty of fun, colorful music. It has little of the magic acts, or other ""fillers"", but is instead just one song after another. But that is what my kids love about it. Usually they lose interest in the magic shows or Anthony's workshop, etc. It's the Music that keeps them interested, and this DVD delivers! A good Wiggles buy!",1188432000,,774,4.457746478873239
1656148,5,B00005RRG1,This was the first Wiggles DVD we ever saw. We loved it so much we now own 11 of their DVDs! Our daughter started to really enjoy dancing to this DVD at 18 mos. and she has never stopped dancing and singing along with The Wiggles.,1176163200,,230,4.021739130434782
1656149,4,B00005RRG1,I really enjoyed this DVD.  There were several guest singers which made a nice variety.  My son really loves the Wiggles and especially enjoys this movie.,1154390400,,154,4.884615384615385
1656150,5,B00005RRG1,"This one is really entertaining with great songs and even a remake of a great modern rock 80's song I used to love! We got this at the library and watched it so much we had to buy it too. The guest musicians are wonderfully entertaining and my 1 year old seriously cracks up when Greg wears his ""cool cockatoo"" dark glasses and feather cap. You will love this DVD.",1143158400,4,364,4.214285714285714
1656151,5,B00005RRG1,"I got this DVD less than 24 hours ago and my daughter has watched it at least a dozen times already. The songs are great and the dancing is some of the best I've seen The Wiggles do. There are some very cute bits on this one, and is one of the more musical Wiggles videos I have seen.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone.",1123372800,4,330,3.925373134328358
1656152,4,B00005RRG1,"This is the first Wiggles video I've bought for our one year old daughter. I love the majority of the songs and she loves to dance to most of them. She usually won't watch anything but Baby Einstein, so it says quite a bit if she enjoys the video. I like the songs, but I don't feel they are as good as their earlier songs (e.g. Yummy Yummy). Overall, it's a great video.",1121558400,6,371,4.095890410958904
1656153,4,B00005RRG1,"This is a little different style for the Wiggles. They enlist the help of several Austrailian and New Zealand song writers and performers for several of their songs. They manage to make all the songs lively and catchy with the exception of poor Tim Finn who really missed the boat on children's music revisiting his 80's hit Six Months is A Leaky Boat with a slow tempo and phrases like ""the tyranny of distance"", but he tried. I still get his song stuck in my head and our beloved boys brought out some of the best choreography for that song to liven it up. I probably didn't make any friends with that opinion, but it just is not a children's song!
I wasn't sure about the video at first, but the choreography in all the songs is very good and it really gets better each time I watch it. My 19 month old really likes it.  Not as good as 'Toot Toot' but mutch better than 'Wiggly Gremlins'. Which kinda stinks. No offense.",1110067200,17,923,4.335260115606936
1656154,5,B00005RRG1,"Wiggles World is a magic place in the music video movie.  Greg, Murray, Jeff and Anthony are four colorful boys who love to make me smile, laugh and best of all...interact with them.

One of my favorite songs in (Wiggly, Wiggly World) is ""In The Wiggles World"", ""Here Come The Wiggles"" and ""Sing With Me"" which features Kamal.  But my most favorite song of all is, ""One Little Cyote"".",1101945600,,384,4.536231884057971
1656155,5,B00005RRG1,I have a 7 month old daughter that is a huge Wiggles fan and she loves this video.  I discovered that she liked the Wiggles when she was 2 months old.  I had popped one of my older daughter's old Barney tapes in the VCR and there was a preview for this Wiggle's tape on the beginning.  She sat mesmerized by the singing foursome until it went off.  She however was not interested in the Barney tape.  I rewound back to the Wiggles preview and again she sat watching intently.  Needless to say I went out and bought the video that day.  She has all of the Wiggles videos now but this continues to be her favorite.,1073433600,,612,4.17948717948718
1656176,5,B00005RRG1,My whole family loved this one.  There are other singers that sing with the Wiggles.  The songs are all good and they are from different parts of the world.  It was very cool to hear other 'kid' songs from other cultures.,1070841600,,221,4.341463414634147
1656177,5,B00005RRG1,"I bought this video on a lark last summer, having only seen promos for The Wiggles on Barney videos (which my son loved when he was a toddler, but weren't doing much for my then-14-month-old daughter).  I was a newly-converted stay-home Dad, and I needed something to buy me snippets of time during the day.
Instantly, my daughter was hooked.  Those familiar with the Wiggles music and antics don't need me to describe them--you either love them or hate them.  During the past nine months, they've become major celebrities in our house.
Though we've since collected quite a few other Wiggles videos, this is the one my daughter requests over and over again.  Now 22 months old, she loves to sing and dance along with the songs, which offer a nice mix of show staples now seen on the Disney Channel (""Hey, Hey, Hey We're All Pirate Dancing,"" ""Let's Go,"" etc.) and other songs unique to this collection, with an Aussie and otherwise international flavor.
It's the inclusion of the latter material that makes this tape special and keeps her coming back.  Even I can't help singing along with songs such as ""Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport,"" ""I Love to Have a Dance With Dorothy,"" and my daughter's absolute favorite, ""Taba Naba.""  An added bonus for me, a 40ish guy who experienced the New Wave 80s firsthand, is Tim Finn's appearance, performing a Captain Feathersword-friendly rendition of ""Six Months in a Leaky Boat.""
All in all, this is a very fun collection with strong production and nice pacing, and it's a lot more bearable than some of the other tapes by the group, which offer little more than songs so familiar from the TV show.",1050624000,,1632,4.708771929824562
1656178,5,B00005RRG1,"My 15 month old never stops wiggling to this video.  It goes from song-to-song for the whole video, and I love singing along (call me corny!).  I understand from other reviewers that it's not a favorite for them, but in this house, we love it love it love it!",1049328000,,259,4.26530612244898
1656179,3,B00005RRG1,"This video has a different format than most other Wiggles videos. Most of the song and dance numbers include ""international"" musical artists. Thus, there is no real continuity among the skits and songs. I think most of the songs are rather ""folksy"" and quite unfamiliar. This may or may not appeal to you and your kids. Mine don't request this tape often at all and when they do they always ask for a different tape after the first 5 or so songs. The train song near the end frightens my 3 1/2 yr old which I can't quite figure out. The train is a computer generated cartoon and the engine car squeezes in and out as if it's breathing as it ""travels"" along-perhaps this is what is scary to him. This video has all modern sets and costumes and quite a bit of computer generated animation which makes it very colorful. Overall, I like the Wiggles a lot, but I wouldn't play this tape unless my kids requested it. I think you'd be much happier buying ""Toot, Toot!"", ""Hoop Dee Doo!"", or even one of their much older (but in my opinion one of their best) ""Dance Party"".",1045526400,3,1064,4.378787878787879
1656180,5,B00005RRG1,"We love the wiggles here and this one is a pleasant addition to our collection.  As a mom of a 16 mos old I am so thankful for the wiggles, my son loves them.  He will sit through this tape (as well as most of the others) and it is not barney.  These are the only videos he will sit through.  I have been reading the other reviews of this video and may I recommend that if you are a wiggles newbie that you buy what I call one of the big three Toot Toot, Yummy Yummy, or Wiggle time.  Though my son enjoys this tape it is not the norm for them and to really appreciate the wiggles buy these first that way you are not disappointed. This tape is still a favorite here and watched everyday.",1042588800,,688,3.9565217391304346
1656181,5,B00005RRG1,"I almost hate the term multiculturalism because it brings to mind some university lecturer screaming in your face that you have to like something because it's not from your culture.  However, this video shows wonderful songs from around the world, and the Wiggles do back-up music.  There's an aboriginal song, a Japanese song, a cowboy song, and many others.  It's probably the least danceable of the Wiggles videos.  That is, the rock beat is hard to put under a tender song about spring in Japan, but it is a calm and peaceful alternative to the other Wiggles videos that have my children and I running and dancing for hours on end.  This one is more contemplative.  The kids still like it.  In general, the music in this one is at an even higher quality than in some of the other videos devoted to pop (there is even an opera singer in this one!), but the colorful visuals and so on are still there.  My kids like this one, but they don't dance to it much.  They do the movements with the aboriginal woman, though, and have even learned to sing the song in something called Mira Mir!  That's beyond belief, and to me this represents a gentle and charming introduction to multiculturalism for my children.",1039478400,,1208,4.576744186046511
1656182,5,B00005RRG1,"This is a very unique Wiggles video.  It is quite different from the others released previous but it is still a great video.  As the title hints, ""Wiggly, Wiggly World"" this video contains many ""different"" songs, songs from around the world.  Graphics and imagery on this video is more high tech than those videos preceeding it.  Most of the songs are not as jump up & down, wiggle your hips, move around songs as we're used to in the videos Toot Toot, Wiggle Time, Yummy, Yummy and the rest but they're just as great.  They're beautiful, harmonic and very well sung.  Special guests are throughout this video assisting the great pre-school educators/singers/Wiggles inform and perform these wonderful songs.  I would recommend this video to anyone, Wiggle fan or not.  But I would warn the Disney Playhouse watching Wiggle fan that this video teaches of world harmony and not what has been shown on Disney to date.  It's well worth the money but not what you'd expect.",1038528000,8,969,4.789156626506024
1656183,5,B00005RRG1,We have viewed 3 Wiggles videos and like this one the best so far. Great dancing and singing. My two year old has watched it for months and still enjoys it.,1037923200,,156,4.064516129032258
1656184,5,B00005RRG1,"This is the Hallorans last video! They are the excellent dancers from the other tapes. Their Choreographer is Leanne Halloran, who plays Officer Beaples, for the last time. The contract The Wiggles had with the Halloran school of Dance is over for good after this video. Just watch Hoop-De-Doo It's a Wiggly Party and see for yourself what The Wiggles amount too without the Hallorans.
They do their best dancing it this film. It's worth it just to watch the dancing and the Halloran girls, Jesse and Casandra, almost all grown-up. Plus the songs are really good and the variety with all the singers is wonderful. My 26-month-old really loves this one, as she does with all the Wiggles videos. Buy the last video the Halloran School of Dance puts out, it is their finest work! Beautifully danced to three Pirate songs. I really like the variety in the backgrounds. Several are computer generated artwork, like in a barn and outside in the Australian Outback. And their main background stage is awesomly decorated with lots of roses and it almost looks like it is outside, but it is just painted walls and floors. A really good effect and fun too. These songs seem more sophisticated then on earlier vidoes, but my child loves them just the same and I like them a lot. Don't pass this one up!",1034294400,,1291,4.666666666666667

1656196,5,B00005RRG1,"My 18-month-old daughter is addicted to this video. From the moment she wakes up until she goes to bed it's ""wiggle! wiggle!"". The songs are great, even I have them memorized. If you want your little one to move and dance and sing- get this video.",1031702400,,247,4.391304347826087
1656197,1,B00005RRG1,"I have a 2 year old that loves the Wiggles, but this video does nothing for her. She is bored to death with the drab, lifeless songs. Almost every song is sung by a ""special guest"" and they're all Australian singers singing Australian folk songs. This video doesn't have the usual upbeat songs and dances that my daughter originally fell in love with on their 'Toot Toot' video.",1031529600,,378,4.573529411764706
1656198,5,B00005RRG1,"This tape was my families first official Wiggles purchase, and I have to say--it's a bit different than the Wiggles TV show you see on Playhouse Disney.  We adore the show, which makes my two year old (and my husband and me!) get up a dance every time!  This video definitely has a different tone, and it's much more of a ""sit comfortably and clap along"" type of tape.  Perfect for bedtime!

We used to play a rented Wiggles tape before bed and wear ourselves out doing the Dinosaur dance, etc., but it was a good way to get my daughter wired (and Mom and Dad worn out!).  You'll find Wiggly, Wiggly World to be the opposite--totally soothing!  We particularly like the train song (a lullaby about a train bound for ""Morning Town--many miles away""), and the ""One Little Coyote"" song.  So much fun to sing along and  our little one knows the words already!  The many guest stars on this tape mainly hail from New Zealand, Australia and thereabouts.  You may not have heard of them, but they're really fun to listen to (especially if you like world music), and who knew Greg could sing in Japanese?  Personally, I always wondered what the song ""Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport"" sounded like--and here it is!
I honestly think this terrific tape shows that the Wiggles aren't just all about jumping up and down (though there's some of that here, too--and goodness knows, we enjoy it!).  These songs have a sort of harmony you don't hear in something like ""Fruit Salad... Yummy Yummy.""  They seem a little more . . . advanced, somehow, but just as fun!  I highly recommend this wonderful tape--you'll probably want the CD, too, if there is one!  Just know ahead of time what you're getting into--MELLOW WIGGLING at its best!
I just realized I used about a zillion exclamation marks in this review!!!  Could it be that I love this video??  ; )",1031443200,9,1833,4.556574923547401
1656199,2,B00005RRG1,"After my 18 month-old son saw the Wiggles on Playhouse Disney, he was hooked. This was the first videotape we purchased of the Wiggles (my son picked it out himself...it was obviously the most colorful). None of the songs featured on this tape are ever sang on the show and feature several Australian artists that are unknown in America. We then bought ""Toot Toot"" and ""Yummy Yummy"" and both those tapes worked much better with my son. These tapes feature more of the songs from the Disney show and the tapes are more in that vein...silly and fun, whereas ""Wiggly Wiggly World"" lumbers along at a snail's pace. I'd give ""Toot Toot"" and ""Yummy Yummy"" five stars and make ""Wiggly Wiggly World"" the last Wiggles tape in your collection.",1029196800,,733,4.689922480620155

The colors are bright, there is minimal talking (my daughter gets bored if there is too much time between songs) and lots and lots of dancing.  My daughter will sit there and ""dance"" during the ENTIRE video.  I know when this tape goes in, she won;t move for 45 minutes (helpful for potty breaks, making an important phone call, etc.)  I would highly recommend this tape to anyone...",1021161600,,619,4.651376146788991

Slim Dusty (Waltzing Matilda) and Rolf Harris (one of our favorites) make appearances, as do other artists from around the world.  It's really a great tape and a culturally educational one.

1656205,4,B00005RRG1,"My daughters (1 and 2.5 years old) are Wiggles addicts - we have Wiggles videos, cds, toys, books etc.  They love all the Wiggles videos they have but probably this one is played the least.  I think because the songs are a bit more mellow than some of the other ones when they can jump and dance around.  I find this is a good video to calm them down before bed, where something like ""Hoop De Doo, It's a Wiggly Party"" - is full of fast paced songs which are perfect for a energetic dance around the lounge room or to play at a birthday party.
The video is great and features some well known Australia and New Zealand singers with songs that made them famous.  It's an interesting collabaration with the Wiggles twist given to songs that have been around since I was a child.
The Wiggles really enjoy what they do - I highly recommend any of their videos, cds and if you get the change to see them live - you won't be sorry!",1017360000,16,924,4.203389830508475

1656217,4,B00005RRG1,"My children LOVE the Wiggles.  They dance and sing to their songs over and over again.  I love them too.  It is just plain fun without much inbetween.  I have to say I like the older titles the best though.  The newer ones, such as Wiggly World, are starting to get a little commercial feeling with the new effects.  I like the older, home video type.  The one criticism I have is the children chosen to be in the video do not  represent a diverse group of children.  The wiggles themselves and their guests are diverse, but the children  in the video are not.",1016150400,,560,4.298076923076923
1656218,5,B00005RRG1,"I bought this for my 1 year old since he liked ""Wiggle Time"" so much. It took a little longer for him to get involved with this one--there's more talking and the songs are a little lower-key and not so silly and rambunctious. But it's really grown on us. Now, he probably sits longer for this tape than for the others, and I've started using it as a wind-down for before naps (a couple tunes are practically lullabies). The songs are as catchy as ever--I woke up this morning with the song ""Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport"" in my head--and the guest singers are excellent. Highly recommended.",1015977600,,588,4.5046728971962615
1656219,5,B00005RRG1,"For some reason the age categories on books, toys and tapes don't seem to be very accurate.  This is a good example.  My 10 month old just got this tape and loves it.  She loves watching the Wiggles on the Disney Channel and has for a couple of months.  She probably would have been engaged by the singing and dancing on this tape if I had gotten it  for her around six months old or younger yet it states from age ""one"".  On the other hand, the tape says up to 8 years old and I doubt to many 8 years would sit still very long for this.
Anyway, I'd recommend it from 5 or 6 months to probably around 5 or maybe 6 years depending on the child (the cd's the Wiggles have made  could probably be played from just after birth as the songs have rhythm and rhyme and I believe babies can start to have an ear for this even in vitro).
My daughter claps her hands, bounces in rhythm and sings along in her own unique chatter language, I think tapes like this really stimulate the mind of a baby and help them advance in speech, music and social skills.  Highly recommend.",1015200000,,1064,4.131067961165049
1656220,5,B00005RRG1,"These guys just don't shut up... and I guess that's part of the attraction to a 3 year old.  With the little bit of story-telling, mixed in with a lot of song-and-dance numbers, this is a non-stop, music-filled, VERY colorful kid-entertainment bonanza.
Every time the video ends, my boy sighs ""Aw[...] It's overrrr!""; but having said that, it's a great bedtime wind-down video, as the last couple of songs are nice and mellow...
There's no sign of this one being obsolete any time soon  :}

1656221,4,B00005RRG1,"We have all the Wiggles videos and each one is a little different, but this one (the latest available in the U.S.) is maybe too different for our taste.  There's more talking, less dancing and singing.  Also, the ""weird"" songs are even weirder on this video.  However, I don't think you can ever go wrong with the Wiggles, so I would still recommend this video.  If you are just getting into Wiggles, the best videos are Wiggle Time, Toot Toot and Yummy Yummy.  Wake Up Jeff and Dance Party are older, but still very good.  I'm sure with time, this video will grow on us too.",1012521600,28,575,4.377358490566038

More original songs, colorful computer graphics, and some new (human) friendly faces will make this very interesting for any Wiggles fan.  This time, Greg is given a break from full-time lead vocals, and we're treated to the delightful voices of Kamahl (in ""Sing With Me""), Christine Anu (in ""Taba Naba"") and Atsuko Arai (in ""Haru Ga Kita""), among others.  The usual cast of characters, like Captain Feathersword, Dorothy, etc., make for one great show.  What I like best is the unspoken celebration of differences.  My two-year-old really loves this one.
