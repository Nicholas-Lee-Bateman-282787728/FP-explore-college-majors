2675217,3,B000JLMVQ6,"i enjoyed watching this film as a follow up to ""One Man's Wilderness"", which I viewed on PBS. This documentary contains the actual narrative of Dick Proenneke, something that gives the film a unique feel.  There are also more shots of the wildlife that occupied the area, and Dick's perceptions on these critters is interesting for the viewer.  I did miss the more in-depth look at how the cabin and tools were made that ""One Man's Wilderness"" provided, and think I will have to add that DVD to the collection as well.  Both ""The Frozen North"" and ""One Man's Wilderness"" are worth having in any collection as a look into the human spirit.",1275782400,22,638,4.628318584070796
2675218,3,B000JLMVQ6,I  now have all the Dick Proenneke videos as of today. Proenneke is a multi-talented man and the photography and film part of DVD is beautiful. What it lacks is the smooth narrative skill of Bob Swerer who did  almost all the narrative on the other two Proenneke DVDs. Proenneke has a high pitched sing song narrative delivery that can be hard to understand at times. Swerer who is also the producer ought to consider re-cutting it with his voice over which I think adds immeasurably to the other Proenneke DVD's,1269820800,11,512,4.615384615384615
2675219,5,B000JLMVQ6,The very first time I heard about this video [...] I did a search on Alaska and I came across this video and by the time I watched that video I was amazed by the beauty of the Alaskan Wilderness cause of the mountains rivers lakes trees and animals it made me feel like I was actually in the wilderness myself not having to worry about people and every day life so I bought the full video[...] and I was not disappointed it looked good the way I pictured it so I give this video 5 stars what an amazing video I hope I get to live in twin lakes in a couple years from now=),1253577600,9,572,3.939655172413793
2675220,5,B000JLMVQ6,"Dick Proenneke's ""Alone in the Wilderness"" detailed the ""how"" of his life in Alaska. ""The Frozen North"" provides a view into the joys and risks of his chosen, isolated, way of living. It includes some footage of prior films, but with the valuable insight of the moment and beyond. One of the best features of this film is the narrator- Dick Proenneke. While his friend, Bob Swerer narrated his earlier features, this time we get to hear Proenneke himself. His manner of speech, understated emotion, and love of the challenging land he called home, makes this a wonderful hour-long experience.",1230163200,80,592,4.93
2675221,5,B000JLMVQ6,"I bought this item as a gift for my husband (and myself):-)
We had watched this at least 3 times on PBS. Everytime it was on and we were flipping through the channels, we had to stop and watch.
So I decided this is a must for the archives.
Dick Proenneke was a very interesting and skillful man.
Bravo to Bob Swerer Productions for finding him, so many years ago.",1203724800,31,363,4.2
2675222,5,B000JLMVQ6,We found these books and DVDs to be very entertaining and educational.  The fact that it is all true makes it even more enjoyable.  I would say anyone who is interested in Alaska or at all interested in learning how to live off the land would like these very much.,1202169600,25,264,4.26
2675223,5,B000JLMVQ6,"Great book.
The company shipped it in a timely manner.",1433376000,,54,4.5
2675224,5,B000JLMVQ6,love all the dvd' s we have got. Shipping is crazy FAST !! My husband has watched these dvd's at least a hundred times. I love them too !,1418601600,,137,3.7586206896551726
2675225,5,B000JLMVQ6,"Loved it. We now have all of Dick Proenneke's CD's. In this one, him actually describes his life in the wilderness. Its an amazing store that everyone should see.",1418083200,,162,4.620689655172414
2675226,5,B000JLMVQ6,Good movie for those people who are interested in survival skills. Dick was an amazing man and his skills were amazing.,1417219200,,119,4.714285714285714
2675227,5,B000JLMVQ6,Great book,1405814400,,10,4.5
2675228,5,B000JLMVQ6,Great movie with more of Dick speaking instead of the narrator.  New footage that you read about in his books.,1395705600,,110,4.5
2675229,5,B000JLMVQ6,Great.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.  It's amazing what one man can do.  Would love to see the cabin and area.  Thanks.,1394755200,,113,4.5
2675230,5,B000JLMVQ6,"If you have seen any of the videos about this extraordinary man, you will know that all of them are outstanding.  A very talented man in word and photography, doing almost all of it by himself, setting up a movie camera in the 60s on a tripod and showing how he built a cabin and outbuildings manually without electricity or power tools, including the hand-carving of door hinges.  You need to see this video series to believe it.",1394582400,,430,4.5
2675231,5,B000JLMVQ6,"We originally got hooked on Dick Proenneke by watching IPTV's Alone in the Wilderness.  Since then, my husband loves all things Alaskan wilderness.  This is a great movie and addition to our Dick Proenneke Collection.",1391731200,,217,5.171428571428572
2675232,5,B000JLMVQ6,"Dick Pronneke wrote a very interesting journal of the time he spent in Alaska, from building his cabin to mining for gold.  The journal gives you an even closer inside look at what life was like for him during all those years in Alaska.",1384300800,,236,4.363636363636363
2675233,5,B000JLMVQ6,"Nicely done with Dick doing a lot of the narrative.  I've already watched it 3 times, and will eventually watch many more.",1373760000,,122,4.545454545454546
2675234,4,B000JLMVQ6,My husband loves anything regarding how to survive in the wilderness as well as Dick's ingenuous inventions.  Dick Proenneke is one of his favorites.,1368057600,,149,5.208333333333333
2675235,5,B000JLMVQ6,"So maybe I'm a little biased, but I loved this film. it was very cool to hear Dick Proenneke speaking, instead of Bob Swerer who I believe does most of the narrations on this and the previous movies. Lots of Richard's original footage, plus some new stuff i think was filmed later. Good dvd.",1360195200,3,291,4.407407407407407
2675236,5,B000JLMVQ6,Great for fans of this great pioneer ... real treat to hear Dick himself narrate much of this. His simple and unadorned style and his Kit Carson voice make this a treasure. Watching Dick pan for gold is worth the price alone!,1358553600,,225,4.380952380952381
2675237,5,B000JLMVQ6,"I gave this to my husband for Xmas. He is a big admirer of this man. He loved it.
Good condition",1357689600,,96,3.619047619047619
2675238,5,B000JLMVQ6,"This is a great story and no matter how many times I read it, it's always fresh and fun.  An amazing man and great stories about his day to day life and the projects he tackles.  Worth the price and a definite must read book!!!",1346025600,,227,4.022222222222222
2675239,5,B000JLMVQ6,"To have a chance to share in Dick's life, trials and achievements is more than a pleasure, it is an honor!",1343433600,,106,4.095238095238095
2675240,4,B000JLMVQ6,A look into how hard the life in the wilderness is and why only a few live to tell about it.,1331510400,,92,3.4285714285714284
2675241,5,B000JLMVQ6,"I recently received Alone in the Wilderness 2 for Xmas. Like that DVD, this one is also utterly amazing. This man has inspired to me to perceive things in a new way. If I'm not at work I'm hiking! My wife agrees that the narration of Proeneke is ""unique"", his sentences seem to run together. Don't get me wrong though, it is not at all hard to understand, and this doesn't take away from the beautiful photography and film work.",1327449600,5,428,4.3625
2675242,5,B000JLMVQ6,"More great video from/about Dick. It's true, theres a lot more wildlife and nature footage than One Man's Wilderness, but the cabin's already been built so what else is there to show?! One of the best parts to me is getting to hear Dick's voice doing some of the narration, he's got a very unique and interesting cadence that I get a kick out of. If you watch close he also shows you how he prepares his sourdough biscuits.",1307664000,8,423,4.367088607594937
8151597,4,B000JLMVQ6,"Fast shipping! not as good as first video in series,but still good to watch.",1512518400,,76,4.5
8151598,4,B000JLMVQ6,"Finally, a documentary actually narrated by Dick Proennecke (Bob Swerer narrated the others). What makes this worthy is that there is much more of nature filmed by Dick (dare I call him that?). With reading his journals, he was patient with his subjects. What makes this fun and frustrating is that he is hard to understand. That is partially because he is reading a script based on his journals, and his speaking voice, or rather his reading voice is too fast to follow unless you know about what he us talking. He would use a tape recorder to read from his script, send it off to NPS to edit, then they would send back suggestions. It is really cool process (that I read about in another book, ""Dick Proenneke- reflections on a man in his wilderness."")",1484438400,,754,4.551470588235294
8151599,5,B000JLMVQ6,Love it!,1482796800,,8,3.5

8151602,5,B000JLMVQ6,It's Dick Proenneke - that dude was a stud!,1465257600,,43,3.888888888888889
8151603,5,B000JLMVQ6,"This DvD was made in 1993 prior to Alone in the Wilderness 1&2, but would be better viewed as the third installment.  If I were to have watched the Frozen North first, I would not have any clue about Dick Pronneke's wilderness talents and how he built his cabin and all the other wonderful things he did-  yes there is a brief narration by Bob Swerer about it, but other than that, it just show a 1970 view of Dick's established living area.
The Frozen North is mostly narrated by Dick Proenneke- his way of speaking is like one long run on sentence- very melodic and so nice to hear.  The man really knew how to live and deal with the harshness of Alaska wilderness country-  I secretly imagine that I could do what he did but I most likely die from a bee sting or freeze to death in the wilderness-  Dick Proenneke rocks big time !",1464652800,,833,4.246835443037975
8151604,5,B000JLMVQ6,"If you've seen the ""Alone in the Wilderness"" DVDs, and you have loved those, then this is a must-have to go along with them.  This actually has Dick Proenneke's voice on it, which was a nice surprise to us.  Bob Swerer does an excellent job on the narration of the ""Alone in the Wilderness"" DVDs, which he also produced,  but it was good to hear the voice of the man who actually lived these experiences, as well. We so appreciate how he shared his wilderness life with all of us!",1459296000,,480,4.311111111111111
8151605,5,B000JLMVQ6,Aw! What a surprise to hear Dick Proenneke narrating. What a treat! He must have been in his 80s when he did the narration. Though you have to pay attention and get used to his elderly voice it's worth it to hear him telling about his adventures in his own words.,1456185600,,263,4.176470588235294
8151606,5,B000JLMVQ6,"Saw this on PBS broadcast, and wanted it for my library.",1445904000,,56,4.181818181818182
