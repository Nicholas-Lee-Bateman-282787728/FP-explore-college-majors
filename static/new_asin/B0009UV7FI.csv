8066760,4,B0009UV7FI,"I wrote the review of the sixth DvD and insinuated that that was the last one, than this pops up...

If you're still interested in what I wrote -doubtful- in that one, give the sixth one a look see and my feelings in that commentary reflects on the FINAL DvD here.",1262131200,,264,4.176470588235294
8066761,2,B0009UV7FI,"Well, it's Hell on Earth for all of us mere mortals as Aion with a bewitched Rosette wanders the world healing people and driving mankind into enforcing justice, even if they have to murder those they find guilty of sin! The Magdalene Order is strangely relegated to the sidelines in the old ""God doesn't interfere with Man, so He lets the Devil do it!"" cliche. The whole thing becomes some sado-masochistic dream in which characters are dying left and right but don't worry, we're being tested like Job fatalism. Chrono and Azmaria desperately try to track down Rosette as Satella is locked in a battle with her older sister, whose memory was wiped by Aion.

Sad to say but Volume 7 of Chrono Crusade brings a series that started with a lot of laughter and entertainment to an end filled with sadness and overacting drama. Maybe to a Japanese audience this theme of making Man to suffer as a test is something new, but to Christians, it's all old hat. The humor from the first couple of Volumes is also sorely missed with this gloom and doom installment. And another sore point is Azmaria's singing which is supposed to be divine, but just sounds like poorly pronounced English by a Japanese singer. The saddest facet of this show is that it never was allowed to achieve its potential.",1129075200,,1286,4.640350877192983
8066762,2,B0009UV7FI,"This has always been a great series. Beautifully drawn with  shades of grey. But the series you start watching is not what you end with. You are drawn in with some amusement as a demon hunting girl and her good-demon boyfriend exorcise ghosts,demons,etc. It's lighthearted with hints at the past and a missing brother. It's so good, you don't notice that the last DVDs are intense and humorless. The object is to defeat the demons and save Rossette's little brother, right? Well, no. This is a sad, mysterious tearjerker I was NOT expecting. Isn't there a rule that says most of the main characters have to live??

I suggest stopping the series after three DVDs before you are too involved in the story. I was disappointed. I give the first DVD 5 stars however.",1128297600,,761,4.6716417910447765
8066763,5,B0009UV7FI,"Though Chrono Crusade for some people started off slow, it does pick up here in the end.

Sadly we will say farewell to four characters, and the loss of the final two will bring you to tears.

If you have followed Chrono you will understand by what I mean when the contract has run its course.

And we fast forward to 1981... just briefly... and you wonder why she had to die...",1124323200,5,378,4.222222222222222
8066764,5,B0009UV7FI,"The final few episodes of Chrno Crusade will have you sobbing.  Trust me.  Get your tissues ready, people, because you are gonna need them.  Of course, that's not to say that the ending isn't wonderful and sweet, because it is.  This is the awesome finish to an awesome series, even if the English voices really suck.  (Watch it in Japanese, it's way better!)

Also, be sure to read the books, because even though the anime is better, the books are also very good.  The books are also a bit different from the anime, so you'd be smart to read them.  ^_^",1123027200,10,553,4.405940594059406
