3481967,5,B001B3LILK,"I love this movie. It's not complicated, nor deep. But that's part of its charm. A simple pleasant comedy. I've watched it many times when I just want something light and amusing.",1293926400,6,179,4.625
3481968,1,B001B3LILK,"Talk about a poorly executed movie.  How To Rob a Bank completely misses the mark in every single area.  Two people are locked inside a vault.  One of them is a hot chick who tagged along with the robbers.  The other person in the vault is a guy who has a really smart mouth and thinks he's the most clever guy on the face of the planet.

The bad guys are on the other side of the vault, in the bank obviously, and taking the innocent people hostage.  The cops are of course outside the bank waiting to either negotiate with the robbers or make an unexpected move.

Throughout the film, the bad guys constantly communicate with the guy in the vault.  The storytelling is, quite frankly, extremely boring, tedious to watch, and completely uninspiring storytelling-wise.

If you're expecting a lot of suspense, trust me, you won't get any of that.  As far as the acting goes, it's really bad by just about every one of the main characters (including the overdramatic and completely unbelievable lines involving the one cop outside the bank- ugh, brutal!)

I don't get the appeal of How To Rob a Bank.  It's just a really terrible film from beginning to end.",1277683200,,1155,4.553398058252427

""How to Rob a Bank"" is a low-budget oddity in which a young private citizen (Nick Stahl) gets accidentally locked in a bank vault with a hot-and-sexy would-be robber (Erika Christensen).  The trick is it's hard to tell whose side young Jinx is really on - the bank robbers' who are holding the employees and customers hostage on the other side of the steel door, or the cops`, led by Officer Degepse (Terry Crews of ""Everybody Hates Chris""), who are stuck outside the bank trying to defuse the situation.  Jinx is a customer mightily ticked off at how banks literally nickel-and-dime their depositors at every opportunity - and it is anger at this outrage that may inspire him to shift his loyalties to the malefactors in the final stretch.

Written and directed by Andrews Jenkins, the movie earns more points for creativity than it does for execution. The story is often needlessly gimmicky and confusing, the direction unpolished and lacking in finesse, and the performances low on subtlety and shading (though Stahl is very good).  Plus, what with its made-on-the-cheap appearance, collection of pseudo-profundities and single-set mise-en-scene, ""How to Rob a Bank"" definitely has a film-school-project feel to it.

Still, it's kind of fun watching the movie turn the bank-robbery formula on its head, particularly in its blurring of the lines between the hostages and the hostage-takers, the law-breakers and the law-enforcers.  Plus, for a little added kick, it has the late David Carradine appearing in a cameo role right at the closing moments.",1268524800,,1559,5.090196078431372
3481970,2,B001B3LILK,"I didn't know it was possible to make a boring bank robbery movie, but apparently it is.  Jinx (Nick Stahl) is a disgruntled paycheck-to-paycheck Gen-Y quasi-slacker stuck in a bank vault with would-be robber Jessica (Erika Christensen).  Gavin Rossdale is Simon, the anti-depressant popping sociopath waiting outside the vault with an itchy trigger finger and a bank full of hostages.  Terry Crews is Officer DeGepse, the half-competent police negotiator allowing his strings to be pulled by Jinx.  And David Carradine is the voice of Nick, the robbery's mastermind.  In a useless plot device, the key bank robbers (Nick and Simon) take their names from Duran Duran since they use a fansite to mask their communications over the internet.

What happens?  Not much.  Jinx recruits Jessica to his side (despite lack of apparent chemistry between the two actors), sees through Nick's masterplan, rants about bank charges, plays Simon and DeGepse against one another to engineer a way out of the safe, and (presumably) splits the eventual take with Nick and Jessica.

At the end of the day, this seems like a waste of Nick Stahl's talent.  Nothing really makes sense in this movie - from the robber's Duran-Duran-obsessed cabal, to the origin of the stolen money (banking fees which are somehow unclaimed), to the location of the all-important computer terminal (locked in a branch vault as opposed to a corporate site or secured facility), to Jinx's ability to turn his `captive' robber, to the final escape.  Most of the movie appears either poorly conceived or unbelievable.

The `escape' scene is emblematic of the movie's inability to carry any semblance of logic, suspense, or momentum.  Jessica has to appear as Jinx's captive to fool Simon, while appearing as an innocent bystander to escape DeGepse's notice and prosecution.  All is solved by having a jammed gun (a recurring motif throughout the movie) go off and plug Simon in the forehead, ending everyone's troubles.  Nice, tidy, and completely unrewarding.  I'll take The Bank Job or Heat any day over this one any day.",1226966400,8,2080,5.091445427728614
3481971,4,B001B3LILK,"I'll make this short and to the point but hopefully with enough to get you a basic outline of what to expect from this movie.

I thought the basic idea was pretty good but the dialogue in itself lacked moments at times, there are also several scenes that drag on and on (Mostly between the main character, Jinx, within the vault).

The effects are surprising, the soundtrack is pretty good. Some of the acting could have been done better and I think they should have improved with the Detective character. The way he delivered certain jokes practically ruined them.

What made me buy this movie, rent it, and watch it a couple of times? Gavin Rossdale. I've always been a big fan and his acting in this movie is amazing, he basically saved the movie and made it watchable.

I just skip to the parts that have him in them, he had some pretty entertaining moments and made the purchase worth while.

To close this up, I leave you with a few final words. If you're not a fan of Gavin Rossdale or don't have a clue who he is, this movie might have to be enjoyed by you in a different way.

My suggestion, if that is the case, is to kick back and relax. Enjoy the soundtrack and the few jokes tossed in the middle, you'll find it a quick and entertaining flick.

However, if you are a fan of Gavin Rossdale then you certainly will enjoy it no matter what.",1215129600,8,1350,4.312252964426878

8281767,5,B001B3LILK,"If you liked Tyler Durden of Fight Club - you'll like Stahl's character in this film. It's funnier and a little different than the usual Stahl films- it's entertaining enough for me to want to watch it more than once. This is a movie you can enjoy on occasion where you want to be entertained without having to think too much about how corporate America is giving it to us, yet you can tell that's basically what it 's saying. The characters are likable and the plot is easy on the mind.  For some reason, I found it not too surprising that David Carridine was the voice I recognized but who you don't see until the end. This is the kind of movie you'd expect him and a grown up Nick Stahl to take roles in. It might not be for everyone ... but then those are the kind of movies I seem to like: the kind most people don't care about one way or another.  (the reason I do not review many movies, even though I watch many).",1437004800,,921,4.139664804469274

8281769,4,B001B3LILK,"This film, starring a mostly young cast [Nick Stahl, Erika Christensen, Gavin Rossdale, Terry Crews}, is a comedy about a bank robbery.  Its hard to make a bank robbery, which can easily turn quite violent, into a comedy, and in a way this film reminds me of Flypaper, another quite funny movie about 2 groups robbing a bank at the same time (which film was also greatly under-rated).  ""How To Rob"" is also in my opinion quite funny, but otherwise significantly different from Flypaper.

Nick Stahl plays the lead character, Jinx Taylor, who walks into a bank trying to withdraw $20.00 in-person from his very meagre checking account, because he cant afford the $1.50 fee for using an ATM to withdraw only 20.00  And every chance he gets, he launches into a rant about the evils of corporations, like banks and cell phone companies, nickel-and-diming everyone to death--which becomes one of the standing jokes of the film.  This illustrates how the comedy in ""How to Rob a Bank"" is not achieved by easy and obvious laughs, but by the somewhat more subtle use of dialog and juxtaposition.  Erika Christenson plays Jessica, part of the robbery team with some computer sophistication, who enters the bank vault because the team knows that a key computer is within the vault and can open all of the safety deposit boxes, create new PIN numbers, and probably do many other things, which is why it is inside the massively secure vault at this head branch of a large bank chain.

Jinx starts out so single-minded in his obsessiveness about getting his full $20.00 from the bank that when a robbery breaks out while he's at the cashier's window, and he flees inside the vault with Jessica, it's still what he's most focused on.  But gradually he transforms from a seemingly slightly autistic, obsessive-compulsive, and generally clueless character, into a much more clever young man than he appeared to be.

Jinx and Jessica get stuck inside the vault together for most of the movie, where they spend the time arguing with each other (with witty, rapid and ever-changing observations) and, inevitably, bonding with each other [with a young, reasonably attractive guy and a young, reasonably attractive girl stuck together for most of the movie in a comedy, of course it seems inevitable].

Meanwhile, the rest of the team is outside the vault, holding everyone hostage and trying to get into the vault, and the police, including a negotiator [played by Terry Crews] and a SWAT team with laser-guided automatic weapons and a helicopter, have the bank surrounded.  And if three groups aren't enough, the movie adds a 4th element with Nick, the guy who provided the codes for Jessica to crack the computer in the vault, who is voiced-over on the cell phone by David Carradine [we only see him visually depicted near the end of the film and boy, I would have sworn that was George Clooneys voice they used!]

Another key to the humor is the constant cell-phone conversations, among the two in the vault, the other bank robbers, the police negotiator, and ""Nick"", the computer-code-provider.

Reviewers are split on this film, some criticizing it for lack of realism, and others considering it very funny.  Im in the latter camp, although I admit it has some inconsistencies, like: a) confusion about the bank: it looks like a small branch, gets referred to as he main branch, then at one point a Federal Reserve branch, which it clearly is not.  b) Stahl/Jinx and Jessica spend an awful lot of time in that vault without coming up with a plan as to how to get out, and although some of the time is only implied, it wasn't quite realistic that it was like ""blind lunch date--inside a bank vault"", but then, that also is a part of the comedy.

The movie had me laughing out loud several times, and it never lost my attention.  Other amusing touches include the leader of the robbers, with an automatic weapon and panicked hostages on the floor discussing his new antidepressant and anxiety medications and whether or not they are helping, an incompetent associate-robber who cant figure out why his gun keeps jamming, and most of all, Terry Crews as the police negotiator, a scene-stealer on facial expressions alone.

Yes, theres some bloodshed (none really depicted; you do see one body on the stairs, and one blood stain inside); no there is no nudity.  The language is not especially vulgarsome swear words were used, but nothing I don't mutter to myself as far as I can recall.

I went into this not expecting much (always a good way to go) and found it funnier than I expected.",1418860800,,4569,4.7814485387547645
