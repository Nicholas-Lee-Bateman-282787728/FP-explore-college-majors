8359027,5,B002A6FDDG,"Great Aussie show! But sadly here in America all we ever get on my 100 channels is just more American TRASH! You'd think ONE channel would play great shows from Down Under or the UK! I really dig the cool Aussie accents in the show. A tad of a low budget produced show but still fun to watch. Pricey DVD's, I wish Amazon or ITunes made these for direct download to own.",1359763200,3,369,4.138888888888889
