2904556,4,B000TJBN76,"David Arquette's Directorial debut ""The Tripper"" is a truly goofy slasher film loaded with sex,drugs,rock n roll lots of blood and plenty of idiotic off-beat humor(some of it being unintentional). There are buckets of originality splattered all over this movie as well as plenty of dry standard slasher fare, but all I can say is when you've got a psycho with a grudge against tree huggers dressed up as the neo-con devil himself in Ronald Reagan weilding an axe, in the end you just can't go wrong with an idea like that. With it's clever political/social commentary as well as it's colorful and glorious idiocy Arquette has tapped into something very relevant here and I for one enjoyed the hell out of it. It's about time the big screen(or little screen in this case)takes a chip out of the pedestal that the delusional pink house and picket fence public has put Reagan up on.",1193961600,,879,4.714285714285714
2904557,1,B000TJBN76,"I'm starting to think I will NEVER again see a horror movie that I will be able to give a good rating.  Such is the case of this feeble attempt at social commentary, presidential skewering, lovers of nature mess a/k/a Tripper.  Direct to video and directed by infamous ""Scream"" deputy sheriff, David Arquette takes his turn in directing another in a VERY long line of ""dead teenager"" movies.  All participants (except one) consume MASS QUANTITIES of every drug known to man, have mindless sex, and then die.

There are SEVERAL amazing things about this movie:  (1) I couldn't believe all the ""named"" actors in it; and (2) I couldn't believe how AWFUL it was.  Tripper isn't scary, suspenseful, gory (the blood looked ORANGE to me), or even camp (it's not that smart enough of a script).  I guess because the tagline was ""he's got a Ronald Reagan mask and axe"" was supposed to catch everyone's eye.  And whoever wrote the script should really be proud.  He/she managed to see how many times they could get Paul Reuben's character to say the word f*** for no reason at all.  The special effects are absolutely awful.  One thing I did enjoy was Arquette's visualization (at least I SUPPOSE it was his visualization) of the acid trips.  If he would have paid half as much attention to the rest of this movie as he did to those, it MIGHT have been palatable.  I doubt it--but you never know.

The movie is rated R for full male and female nudity, constant simulated sex, constant drug use, and very lame attempts at gore.  The run time is 97 minutes.",1193961600,2,1545,4.587591240875913
2904558,1,B000TJBN76,"This is a terrible waste of time, the comedy isn't funny but the horror is. Very poorly made, lame dialogue, typical cheap direct to DVD garbage. The pink blood didn't help the gore factor either.",1193702400,,196,4.628571428571429
2904559,3,B000TJBN76,"From the opening quote by Ronald Reagan to the intensely sadistic violence in the first few minutes of the film, you know The Tripper will be loaded with sex, drugs, and rock `n roll - as well as extreme political jabs and hippie killing. So what's not to love? Well, as Reagan himself once said, ""You can tell a lot about a fellow's character by the way he eats jellybeans."" No, I don't get it either.

A group of hippie fodder trek to a small town in the middle of a forest to participate in the Free Love Festival and indulge in massive quantities of narcotics. However, they soon discover they're not exactly welcome when they are assailed by paintball gun toting rednecks, the local police, and an axe-wielding serial killer who fancies Ronald Reagan.

The Tripper's strongest point of originality (not that there have been other hippie serial killer movies) lies within its psychopathic murderer who dons a suit, a tie, and a President Reagan mask as he metes out his vicious carnage. With an origin as brutally twisted as Freddy or Jason, Ronnie seems destined to make his mark as a deranged killer worth rooting for. And we do, but not because he's so compelling a villain, but rather because his prey is so uninterestingly bland - which is a shame when the protagonists contain six young stars and one of them is Jason Mewes, who should have been right at home with the offbeat comedy and drug humor. Jaime King adequately embodies the screaming primary victim, and while her character gets more interesting as the film progresses, there's still relatively little motivation to continue supporting her survival. The majority of entertaining characters are the supporting ones - those who give quick one-liners and quirky mannerisms and get out before their presence begins to bore. Of the main cast, Tom Jane provides the only praiseworthy performance as he takes the role just seriously enough without outstaying his welcome skepticism.

Deceptive trailer aside, at its core The Tripper is a horror movie. And while it does a decent job of bringing blood and scares to the table, the main course seems tainted with a bit too much social and political parody and an abundance of psychedelic contamination and cocky humor. The film doesn't take itself seriously and makes no attempt at persuading the audience to do otherwise. This wouldn't be a problem if The Tripper focused on comedy, but at every turn we're faced with another seriously demented killing and only mild spurts of dark humor. The less you know about the Reagan administration the less likely you'll appreciate the political commentary and jokes that pepper the script. At times the horror elements work surprisingly well, and with a uniquely terrifying antagonist, The Tripper starts to look wholly original. However it's not long before that illusion wears off and the film falls into a damaging amount of clichs for a film not parodying thrillers.

In this medley of blood, hippies, and Ronald Reagan, psychedelic creativity reigns supreme, but those not accustomed to Arquette's bizarre humor and unconventional antics (or who don't despise the fortieth president quite as much) may find this trip easier to swallow with real drugs.

2904560,5,B000TJBN76,I wasn't expecting much from a film directed by David Arquette but after finding out this film combined my love of horror/slasher films and my hatred of dirty hippies I just had to rent it and see if it was any good.  Surprisingly David Arquette has directed a very well made and entertaining film that I plan on purchasing and adding to my collection in the near future.,1193270400,,371,4.455882352941177
2904600,3,B000TJBN76,"Intended as kind of a mild salute to the exploitation horror of the 70's, The Tripper (2006), David Arquette's directorial debut, is a slasher flavored with elements of comedy that while not always on solid ground, does have some scary moments, and some heavy-duty mayhem at the finish.  Arquette co-wrote the script, and also has a small role in the film, which is very much a family affair.  His wife Courtney Cox is a producer, and also has a bit part as a middle aged hippie type.  The director's brother Richmond Arquette also appears as a deputy, and Thomas Jane who at the time was married to his sister Patricia Arquette, plays Officer Buzz Hall.

The main focus of the story is a group of six friends travelling in a van headed for the Free Love Festival, an event being held in the forest, with a retro 60's hippie theme.  Just out of a bad relationship, Samantha (Jaime King) is along with new boyfriend Ivan (Lucas Haas).  Although her friend Linda (Marsha Thompson) tries to reassure her, Sam fears that her ex may be following her.  The group arrives at the festival site, where Officer Hall is trying to make sure that things go smoothly for the event.

Matters take a turn, when a nudist type gets caught in a trap, and winds up hanging upside down with his gut split open.  While out in the woods, some of Samantha's friends have the misfortune to run into a guy dressed in a suit, wearing a Ronald Reagan mask, and swinging an axe.  When a decapitated body is discovered hanging from a tree, Chief Hall announces that the festival is cancelled, and tells the people to clear out.

With hundreds of people looking to party, and the festival's promoter Frank Baker (Paul Rubens) is determined that his event proceeds, Hall is basically ignored.  While the party rages on, Hall follows up a report that leads him to Ronnie's base of operations.  Budget cuts during the Reagan administration resulted in mental patients being released, including one with homicidal proclivities who holds Reagan responsible, and now there will be hell to pay.  Dodging some vicious dogs, Chief Hall heads into the woods and eventually runs into Ronnie, who is doing his best to slice Samantha in half.  The final fight is dramatic, and Ronnie is unmasked, but he's a hard man to keep down for long.

Although there is a lack of realism and attention to detail, in terms of execution, David Arquette does a competent enough job in his directorial debut.  The action scenes are done fairly well, although the violence is overdone to the point of being humorous in places.  Using a horror movie as a vehicle for making a political statement against Ronald Reagan and Republicans in general, may have been misguided, as whatever message is intended, does not translate very well.  The film does however, clearly portray drug use as a cool thing.",1320278400,,2838,4.708502024291498

2904605,2,B000TJBN76,"A group of hippies attending a modern day Woodstock-esque music festival find themselves being picked off one by one by a killer wearing a Ronald Reagan mask.

The idea behind this film, that of a conservative ""President"" killing drug-taking hippies, is a good (albeit warped) one, and thus it should have been a good film, but unfortunately, ""The Tripper"" falls down in its execution (no pun intended). It takes far too long for the killings to really get started - the first half of the movie primarily comprises an extended introduction to the characters who we know are later going to meet horrible deaths, and watching them getting stoned - and once the killing starts, the premise behind the film completely evaporates. According to the DVD cover, the Ronald Reagan killer is meant to be targeting hippies, but in reality, he pretty much just kills everyone who crosses his path (red-necks and Republican voters included), thus rendering the whole film completely pointless. In the film's favour, I will admit that some of the death scenes are pretty cool (if you find ultra-gory horror violence amusing) and that might be enough for some viewers, but I personally prefer gore films that have something resembling a coherent plot.",1239926400,,1236,5.0

I got this film for free, and I still feel conned. It's not scary, or gripping, or gory, or interesting. It's badly directed by a bad actor. You will be hard pushed to get past 15 minutes of this fodder without wanting to turn it off, but you keep watching thinking it has to get better, which it doesn't.

2904607,2,B000TJBN76,"There's no need to beat around the Bush.  This movie sucks.  It gets lost in a haze of decent horror, poorly done dark humor, and atrocious inserts of political history.

It's nearly inconceivable how someone could mess up the simple horror formula that has been reproduced a hundred times: scary killer, a little mystery, lots of topless women, tons of fodder, a few sex scenes, maybe some drugs, and a pointless ending.  It's a nearly flawless concept.  It's too bad the movie is too much like its inept director David Arquette - painful and incompetent.

First and foremost, the killer is scary only because he somehow reminded me of an axe-wielding Christian Bale in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Psycho/dp/B00008RV1L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Psycho</a>.  That would have been enough, but noooooo.  Arquette had to make an unbearable attempt at being clever by making the villain wear a Ronald Reagan mask and speak in a poorly done impersonation of his most famous catch-phrases.  The attempt only works for the braindead.

The hippie sacrificial lambs in this movie are nearly pointless.  Sure, there is Thomas Jane as a sheriff - who probably signed on because he wants to do Courtney Cox - along with Jay (Jason Mewes) from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clerks/dp/B00000IQC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clerks</a>, but the rest are people who at best have been in a truck commercial or something, but they're fairly abysmal and surely not memorable.  Regardless of their past accomplishments, or lack thereof, none is interesting enough to live, or deep enough for viewer empathy.  You will want them to die.  Anyway, they make their way to the redwoods of California for a Love/Drug/Music festival overseen by an F-bomb spouting Pee Wee Herman where they walk into a slaughterhouse.

With so much pure horror potential squandered, it's really a shame.  In the same way that Jeepers Creepers was initially intriguing and later exploded, so too does The Tripper.  With an interesting buildup and a group of great initial killings, the movie shows promise.  With the first decapitation I cheered.  And then the suck began.

No story was developed, secondary antagonists were thrown in for no reason other than to give Arquette a reason be in the movie, and the rest devolves in a steaming pile of political commentary, horrible drug jokes and special effects, and pointlessly predictable murders.  Eventually it becomes evident that the movie is horrible and nearly impossible to enjoy unless drunk or stoned.  It's a complete mess, and it sucks.  I implore you; don't watch it.",1228003200,,2693,5.4987834549878345

In ""The Tripper,"" a slasher movie with a political conscience, a serial killer wearing a Ronald Reagan mask stalks a group of anachronistic hippies (so anachronistic they have cell phones along with their tie dye t-shirts and psychedelic van) who have come to the forests of Northern California to celebrate free love and partake in unlimited drug use at a Woodstock-type outdoor event.

The Red State/Blue State divide is never far from the filmmakers' minds as a bunch of gun-toting rednecks go up against a group of Flower Power love children who suddenly descend on the area.  The saving grace, if indeed there is one, of this gory, but not particularly disturbing, splatter-fest is the tongue-in-cheek humor it manages to display from time to time.  Otherwise, this odd little mixture of horror movie cliches and outdated political satire (does anybody really care about the Reagan administration any more?) falls strangely flat.",1223769600,,941,5.171052631578948
2904609,4,B000TJBN76,"I was pleasantly surprised by how much fun I had watching this movie.  In his directorial debut, David Arquette chose to do a homage/parody of the famous ""themed"" slasher films of the seventies and eighties.  Instead of a hockey mask and campers or a ""holiday"" theme, our killer wears a Ronald Reagan mask and kills hippies.  Our protagonists, sort of, are a group of pill-popping hippies on their way to a kind of ""Burning Man"" or ""Woodstock"" in the woods type concert.

On the way to the concert our lovable, soon to be messily killed, hippies have to deal with paintball shooting/bottle throwing rednecks, old hippies left over from the sixties, several irritating flashbacks, and the occasional nudist (and if you watch the extras, you will discover that the scariest thing in this movie is the ""left over from the sixties hippie nudist . . .).

Although never in any danger of being confused with John Ford or Michael Curtiz, Arquette does a good job with the material and genre in which he's chosen to work.  Don't misunderstand, it is both a b-movie and a parody - so it won't be everyone's cup of tea; but if your tastes run to parodies, b-movies and slasher films . . . or if you've ever thought it would be fun to watch animal rights activists getting mauled or tree huggers finding themselves on the wrong side of a chainsaw, this is the movie for you.",1207440000,4,1363,4.588477366255144
2904640,3,B000TJBN76,"Had I not read the reviews here and had an idea of what to expect from this movie, I probably would have hated it. Since I kind of knew what I was getting into, I was able to sit back, relax and see where this would go. I'm usually not a fan of David Arquette, but I do like Courtney Cox a lot. I have to hand it to Arquette though, this was pretty funny, but it also had some good scares in it. I am not sure that is political message comes across very clearly, none of the groups come across very sympathetically. Not the tree-hugging hippies nor the modern dope loving hippies. However, I found it interesting that at a time where people are rewriting history to make Regan seem like the greatest president ever known, there are still people out there who remember the damaging policies he put into place. A real solid effort from Arquette. I would definitely be interested to see what else he comes up with in the future.",1205539200,2,925,4.291428571428572
2904641,3,B000TJBN76,"I don't really have a whole lot to say about this film.  Arquette's film was an attempt at a spoof slasher political satire.  Unfortunately it really didn't succeed at anything it seemed to be going for.  Usually these films are right up my alley, and the idea of an axe wielding Ronald Reagan scores high marks, but something about it wasn't working.  It's not a terrible film, it does have a few laughs, it's got some sauce for the gorehounds, and how can you go wrong with a movie that features Fishbone?  All departments just seemed a bit halfassed though.  It also doesn't help much that I can't stand Jason Mewes, who's basically playing a slight variation on his Jay character(he'll be stuck in that mode for the rest of his film career I guarantee).

What makes The Tripper so entertaining is that it doesn't take itself too seriously, and the gore effects and shocks are actually pretty imaginitive.  Where The Tripper falls flat are the occasions of modern-day political commentary that pop up throughout the film, and when this happens in the film it feels kind of out of place.  That aside, there's plenty to enjoy with The Tripper, particularly The Punisher's Thomas Jane as the straight laced sheriff (sporting a 70's 'stache) and a foul mouthed Paul ""Pee-Wee Herman"" Reubens as the music festival's promoter.

2904649,4,B000TJBN76,"David Arquette's ""The Tripper"" is a comically self-aware homage to the slapstick slasher bloodbaths of days gone by.  While modern horror audiences have become increasingly ""spoiled"" over the past decade by the offerings of horror director's, often in the form of the new-wave genre known, not entirely affectionately, as ""torture porn"", Arquette's horror debut hearkens back to the good ol' days when horror movies were BAD, everyone knew they were bad, and yet they found a way to slip between our ribs and find a place in our hearts.

Whereas horror films of late, for the majority, seem preoccupied with churning out a gorefest back dropped by a typically transparent, often pretentious story trying way too hard to convey some pertinent message (I'm looking at you, Saw's 1-whatever the hell they're up to now), ""The Tripper"" slaps a Ronald Reagan mask on serial killer and forces you to cackle at its intentionally heavy handed political agenda, driven home as often as an axe exsanguinates a hippie.

Utilizing an almost certainly intentionally absurd cast to re-imagine the untrained, raw, and commonly silly character casts eviscerated time and again in the slashfests of yore, Arquette has done wonders to make his film one of the best executed horror homages in years.  The gang is all here in this one, from Lukas Haas portraying the potential savior and pretty-much-good guy, Jaime King as the almost certain survivor girl, and Jason Mewes as the absolute clown stoner, every stereotypical character is present and accounted for.  The acting is pretty sloppy all around, with the occasional exception of King, but the flaws add that much more authenticity and charm.

The film itself is a hodgepodge of great angle shots and scenes, and shaky, gritty execution.  Unfortunately, while this separates the film even more from the pack, it is often done in the wrong places, making certain scenes appear too flashy, while others more deserving of flash are dirty and unfulfilled.  However, the blood, guts, and all around grue drip from almost every reel, starting with the opening five minutes, and though the gore does not quite stack up in severity to that seen in more modernized entries like that of Roth's ""Hostel"" series, it is so overblown and comical anyone from the casual to hardcore horror fan will have a ball watching heads roll, torsos bifurcate, and intestines trail.

In 97-minutes, and with almost no directorial experience whatsoever, Mr. Arquette has managed to so brilliantly do what so many young men and women from the 70s and 80s, likewise with little or no directorial experience, managed to do: Perfectly execute a thrill-a-minute, wonderfully bloody, and hilariously over-the-top cinematic joyride.  With a style carved straight from so many classic cut-and-paste killfests, and a new age, acid washed flair all its own, ""The Tripper"", while perfectly imperfect, is still one of the most fun horror trips you'll take all year.",1194048000,2,2962,5.113871635610766

This review contains ""spoilers"" i guess that's what you would call it,but trust me my review will not dull the hype of the movie nor will it ruin it. The film is a slasher flick riddled with dark humor almost in vain of Dead Alive(well Dead Snow 1&2 are more similar in that respect) but there is alot of that humor & throwback lines from the killer and the philosophy behind the killings,it is like going back to the Regan days. Partially becaus the killer grew up during the Regan Anti-Drug war days & wears a Regan mask while slashing his way through a Southern California psychedelic jamfest.
The movie is produced & written by David Arquette as well as him playing a part in the film,also in the film is Jason Mewes(Jay & Silent Bob) and Tomas Jane(Punisher) and Peewee Herman amongst others.
But the film starts out with a child watching Regan on tv while his dad tends to his sick wife who is dying of cancer. So the kid goes with his dad to the logging site where some hippies are protesting the chopping down of trees & proceed to offend the husband who's son is with him & wife is dying of cancer at home.
So the kid grabs a chainsaw and goes nuts,then he is shoved in an insane asylum. Fast forward to modern day America where a group of drug fueled youngins go in the woods of California for  a party & concert. Little do they know that a maniac who hates drugs,sex and violence(in vain of the Reganomics) ready to slice,dice and smash them all to pieces. There are traps set in these woods so alot of deaths are considered accidents,until they find disemboweled & beheaded bodies. Thomas Jane plays the head sheriff in this town & he knows about the old man whos son was released from the psyche ward in the woods living off the land,with traps set and vices against outsiders. Amongst all that chaos the main girl in the film thinks she is being stalked by her overly posessive ex-boyfriend who is determined to get her back from the dregs of society that are drug addicted youth.
There is nothing but drugs,sex,violence and madness involved in this film which to me makes it a prime slasher flick. The kills are all pretty gory and violent,most of them are unique as well is the debauchery involved. The storyline is very interesting & i find it very intriguing as well as in it's own way it is pretty unique. The acting is damn good,the violence and story are top notch & the jokes are hilarious,all the dark humor involved is just hilarious.
If you dig sex,drugs & violence all wrapped up in a nice gory slasher story The Tripper is a must see movie for you.

8209859,5,B000TJBN76,"I love watching this movie again and again.  Its an awesome parody of trippy slasher movies with plenty of gore.  There's one kill in particular where the victim's own intestines are practically thrown in their face.  The cast is great, jokes are awesome and some nice nudity to boot.",1372377600,,284,4.755102040816326
8209860,2,B000TJBN76,"From the twisted mind of David Arquette, come the Tripper, a Horror film, that he promised would change the way we see Horror. There's no doubt that Arquette set big expectations for this film, unfortunately the Tripper fell well short of achieving it's goals. A group of hippies take a road trip to this weekend music festival, in the woods of Northern California. The locals don't want them there and pretty soon, the party goers wind up being hunted, by an ax wielding man, who is convinced he's Ronald Reagan. The cast of friends that Arquette put together for this film is impressive, and there were some terrific cameos from the likes of Jason Mewes, Courtney Cox, and Pee Wee Herman, but ultimately they didn't do much to help this film. There are some funny scenes and some great lines, aside from that, this film is nothing different from your traditional, mediocre, slasher film. The one stand out was Thomas Jane who was thrilling as the Sheriff, but the scenes that didn't feature Jane were predictable and honestly kind of dull. The setting was different, the killer was certainly a nice change of pace, and the cast was top notch, but the movie itself was nothing you haven't seen a million times and I was left feeling less than impressed.",1363305600,,1254,4.704545454545454
8209861,4,B000TJBN76,"I wanted to see THE TRIPPER because I'm a big fan of Jaime King (THEY WAIT, MOTHER'S DAY), and was not disappointed by her performance. As for the rest of the movie, it's a decent story about neo-hippies, hicks, and the murderous-maniac-in-a-Ronald-Reagan-mask who hunts and slaughters them. Yep, we're all invited to the FREE LOVE FESTIVAL, located in the middle of absolutely nowhere. Shockingly, mayhem ensues. As political satires go, this one ain't bad. Gorehundts will love the gooshy stuff, while true flower children may cringe. Worth a watch or two... P.S.- Watch for co-producer, Courtney Cox (in a heinous blond wig!) near the end...",1358380800,,644,5.142857142857143
