Wonderful",1458172800,,101,3.6363636363636362
7561393,5,B0192PERP2,"Season 3 was my favorite of great show. Can't believe cancelled :( If you have not yet watched some or all seasons - highly recommended (Season 2 a ""4"" as it got a bit off track with Jack's drinking drama). Just received the DVD today. Seeing ""the final season"" printed on the cover instead of season 3 makes the ""it"" real.  Still can't believe there was not a fourth season to wrap things up AND that neither Hallmark or AM ever let all the fans know why they cancelled last minute stealth - was a slap in face to all the fans. Thus, since and going forward; if I record a movie or Good Witch; I wait/will wait until day four to watch as 1) they are mindless time fillers while I am cleaning or cooking and 2) they don't count toward rating numbers; only premiere night and first three days of DVR playback.",1458000000,9,808,4.246753246753247

7561407,3,B0192PERP2,"I watched seasons one and two and was expecting the final season to provide closure for the characters, but it left some characters somewhat at odds with their circumstances.  I think the producers took some literary liberties with Debbie Macomber's characters and how well she developed them.  The series had great potential based on Debbie Macomber's literary skill with dialog and action, but for whatever reason the producers weakened the original character of Grace, Jack, Olivia, and Justine.",1512950400,,498,5.371794871794871

I must say that towards the end I was really ill from all the botox and very saddened that all these men and women had disfigured themselves from botox.  When will actors ever learn to just age graefully and that natural is always better.  This is why I prefer BBC TV they appreciate age, wisdom and wrinkles. It was so weird to see that most of the actors in this series had no facial expressions.",1510185600,,452,4.2823529411764705

7561458,4,B0192PERP2,"I'm also giving just four stars instead of five because the series was ended so abruptly.  Only in very recent years were we even able to receive the Hallmark Channel, so I had to watch and order the DVD sets as they became available in order to watch the series several months after it was televised.  I think Hallmark was very short-sighted when they cancelled this wonderful series because I'm sure there must be many of us who like to collect quality series TV programs on DVD.",1476316800,2,481,4.517241379310345

7561467,4,B0192PERP2,"Here's what killed this series:
1. The main characters are made out to be idiots when it comes to relationships. Yep. NEARLY EVERY ONE OF THEM! We just kept saying out loud as we watched each episode, ""Wow. They need to see a shrink."" The episodes weren't very true to the books.
2. Someone threw a lasso around the manly rancher and dyed his hair and gave him a manicure. Whoever did that should have been fired. He was by far the most honest and real character and then they went and gussied him up.
3. When a show with a loyal audience gets cancelled, a wrap it all up ""special"" is called for. In fact, it should be in the contract that if a serial is cancelled a ""special"" must be filmed.",1473206400,4,692,4.2105263157894735

7561473,2,B0192PERP2,I purchased the three season set and understand why there were no more made.  The story is so different from the books and disappointing character presentations.  According to this dvd new characters are presented indicating a continuing story that leaves one wondering what happened.  I like to think that the writer Debbie Macomber got disappointed with what was happening to her wonderfully written books and called the whole movie off.,1471305600,7,439,5.242857142857143

7561491,3,B0192PERP2,"I would have given this review a 4.5 star rating for the series, but after reading other reviews I'm finding out the cliff hanger I thought would lead to another season, was actually THE END. What???#$ How do you end a series that's lasted for three seasons on an unfinished note? That's disrespectful to the loyal fans! Although I enjoyed the first two seasons of the series, the redundancy of two men leaving the daughter and setting sail for the seas rather annoying. Seriously, how much bad luck could one girl have with three men? I'm also having an issue with two guys not wanting children. And, I can't even blame Debbie Macomber, thank God. I haven't read this series, but a friend of mine has and she tells me the books have a completely different ending. Shame on you, Hallmark!.",1469923200,4,789,4.602836879432624
7561492,4,B0192PERP2,"The last season of Cedar Cove was a bit disappointing compared the first two seasons. I haven't figured out if the cast knew the series was going to be cancelled and that is why the series isn't as good, or if it was the writing. It is really too bad because I loved the first two seasons of Cedar Cove.",1469232000,,303,4.066666666666666

7561522,4,B0192PERP2,"We are now watching the entire series for about the 5th time. Yes, my husband loves it too - I got him hooked. We love the story lines, the actors' portrayals of their characters, and huge kudos to the scenery. yes, a few annoyances - we want to smack Justine upside the head for dumping Seth and making all those poor choices, much preferred the pilot actress who played the young Navy couple's wife - the new girl didn't fit and have any chemistry with the husband (yes, I know they struggle with chemistry as part of the story line), etc. I bought all 3 seasons on DVD and am giving it 4 stars overall for weak second season writing, and mostly for Hallmark's cancellation of it when they were re-stoking new storyline fires in Season 3, leaving us all with too many unresolved cliff hangers. How did this go from the most popular show in its time slot to canceled? What is up with that, Hallmark? And there are so many truly crap shows that go on for years - who is voting on this stuff? Also, I would really like to have a series soundtrack for Cedar Cove, BTW",1468108800,11,1065,4.303482587064677
7561523,5,B0192PERP2,"HOWEVER!!! I am very angry that the series was cancelled and leaves us all hanging. Even if some actors had to be replaced, I would have continued to watch. The least Hallmark could do is have a follow up movie to tie up the loose ends, but another few seasons would have been much more satisfying. We all spent THREE seasons sharing the lives of these characters. I read all the books and then BOOM! dropped! WHY?????",1467849600,,418,4.441558441558442
7561524,4,B0192PERP2,"I gave it 4 stars for the way it ended. A cliff hanger, to many questions.  I canceled my expensive cable to watch movies on Netflix.  Had a hard time turning off the computer. Just one more episode before going to bed. Then, it stopped with a cliff hanger.  Have been angry for days. Was really enjoying Cedar Cover; just what I needed before bed. Not happy with the ending.  Will not get it on DVD/CD.",1467676800,,403,4.2631578947368425
7561525,4,B0192PERP2,"So I like this series a lot. It doesn't have magic, murder, brutality, sexual assaults or bad language. It's fabulous, just for that alone. Plus, even when the writing got corny, I still cared about the characters, and a few of the actors were good enough to pull off the corny writing - like Alex's transformation from ranch hand to financial wizard and recovering alcoholic. Well, okay, so the recovering alcoholic storyline was a throwaway issue to mix her up with Jack, but Alex was as believable as a CFO as she was as a ranch hand. Kudos to whats-her-name!

My other favorite storyline was Warren tangling with his father, Buck. At last, Warren got to pick on someone his own size! And it worked great. It was entertaining to watch, and almost made Warren a halfway relatable character instead of just being the obligatory jerk.

The roommate threesome with Rebekah, Lynnette and Justine was also entertaining. However, the long-lost sister storyline just got shredded by the writers. Seriously, any random stranger off the street could have written a better way to spring the news on Lynnette than just blurting out ""Gloria's your sister.""

I like Rebekah. Or, I like disliking Rebekah, and she makes her character obnoxious and likable at the same time.

Bob and Peggy are my favorite couple. They've got chemistry and are so believable together.

Grace and Cliff do not work together and they never have. Cliff was just gone, apparently dieting, for most of the season. Glad they whipped him into shape, but putting a simple cowboy together with elegant Grace just never worked for me. You ought to have a couple of things in common if you're going to get married.

And as for this season's big threesome . . . you know, I liked Olivia with Paul better than with Jack. Olivia had actual conversations with Paul. Her dialogue with Jack was mostly gushing about how great they were together, or having issues. Got boring. Paul was funny, engaging, and had things to talk about with Olivia. I thought ending it on that cliffhanger was totally unfair to the fans (hence the four stars instead of five).

And now I must rant about Judge Lockhart. Honesty, the writers just needed to google ""Code of Judicial Conduct"" and they would have found out that pretty much every time her judge duties came up in a storyline, she behaved in a way that would have gotten her thrown off the bench and probably disbarred. Judges are not supposed to even friend attorneys on facebook, much less friend-date them the way she hung out with Paul. And from previous seasons, Judges are never supposed to blackmail people (not even bad guys) or throw their authority around to pressure bad guys into doing the right thing (like when she got Grace's husband to go away). Judges are also not marriage counselors. She's so completely unethical as a judge.

And now that I've gotten all that off my chest, I do like this series. I wish they'd do a finale movie to resolve things. Will Lynnette ever like her sister? Will Rebekah get her job back? Will Paul find a good relationship? Will Justine get engaged for a third time to a guy who is wrong for her? Does Buck stay in Cedar Cove? Is Grace really going to live at a ranch where she has to smell manure every morning? You know, answer all the really *big* questions in the world.",1467590400,5,3314,4.662671232876712

7561589,2,B0192PERP2,"Hallmark had a great opportunity to showcase the Cedar Cove books and the reading public was ready to really respond to it.  However, Hallmark did not deliver.  What was done was a disappointing rendition of the great material that Debbie Macomber delivered.  It was confusing from season 1.  Different actors made it difficult to follow the roles in the series.  Plot lines deviated from the book series, in a bad way.  So sad, because this could have been a huge draw for the Hallmark Channel and the audience was ready to follow it for many seasons.  This was a lost opportunity, Hallmark.  So sad.",1461369600,3,601,4.711538461538462

7561621,4,B0192PERP2,4 stars instead of 5 only for the way thw series ended. Disappointed in Hallmark for not ending the series properly.  Too many unanswered questions.  Why ? When Debbie Macomber has written so many stories / books in the Cedar Cove series.,1459468800,13,238,4.642857142857143

7561647,4,B0192PERP2,"The series was really good, but I agree that the ""cliff hanger"" ending the whole of 3 years seems irresponsible and quite honestly a bit disrespectful to the fans.
At the very least , offer a premiere ending.",1458691200,27,208,4.5
7561648,5,B0192PERP2,Loved this series! Shame on Hallmark for cancelling it! Are they crazy? They punch out a bunch of mindless movies every year and cancel this! Go figure. And then end it with a non-ending storyline. I think they need to get a Season 4 going or let another network do it.,1458518400,28,269,4.294117647058823
7561649,2,B0192PERP2,"I received the Final Season (supposedly)  of Cedar Cove  and when I started watching it - I found that it was the exact same dvds as the second season.  Could they have been packaged in error?  I sure would like to have the final season, if its available.",1458432000,,255,4.25
7561650,4,B0192PERP2,"The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because of how the series ended.  You are left hanging wondering what happens to many of the characters, very frustrating after watching the series for 3 years.  So sad that Hallmark cancelled the series.

8743632,5,B0192PERP2,"I really enjoyed this series, but when they ended it they left you hanging without any closure.  At first I was upset by this but then I realized that I get to decide how things end up.  You can read the books but there are a lot books in this series and I really did not want to delve into them so I ended it in my mind how I wanted it to end.",1529366400,,344,3.635135135135135
8743633,2,B0192PERP2,"I watched all of season one and half of season two and can honestly see why they cancelled it. I am actually surprised that they even made a second season. It is so corny, cheesy and predictable! I continued watching mostly because the locale/setting of the series is so gorgeous, and I enjoyed the way Andie's character dressed with her pretty scarves etc. It was just nice ""fluff"" and there's nothing wrong with that. But it got progressively less and less interesting and boring. All of the women characters are constantly pushing away handsome men, and all of the character's are pretty much just too sweet and annoying. Especially Andie's daughter on the show. It's just so unrealistic. And when I found out that there wouldn't even be closure at the end that was it. I'm done. Too bad though-the scenery was lovely and I really like Andie McDowell.  I don't know about the books because I haven't read them, but the writing on the show was just awful!",1529020800,,957,4.662721893491124

I think Hallmark made a HUGE mistake cancelling this one, probably too tame for most people.  You're on  my list Hallmark, not good.  Debbie Macomber, great story!!",1525564800,,338,5.072727272727272
