8626648,5,B00GS5OH28,"Culture in Decline is an excellent series by Peter Joseph. A great source of information for anyone who cares to change this plutocracy, promote sustainable living, and all with a cutting edge wit and social satire guaranteed to the entertain and educate at the same time..",1445990400,2,273,4.956521739130435
8626649,5,B00GS5OH28,"This goes way beyond the scope of Zeitgeist to prevent a totally non-biased view of our society and how it is shaped by and shapes us. The result is a documentary series that is shocking, not only in the information it presents but in the humorous way that it is conveyed. A stark view of reality, but an entertaining one at that. Peter Joseph presents a powerful documentary on a hard to stomach and overpowering subject, and leaves one not in a state of gloom but empowerment. I would highly recommend this!",1391904000,5,509,4.543478260869565
