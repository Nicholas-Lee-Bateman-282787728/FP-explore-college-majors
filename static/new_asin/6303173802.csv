587402,4,6303173802,"The rating of 4 stars is given in comparison to the other b-grade Spaghetti Westerns, and NOT the Sergio Leone classics. The reason being, is because A Town Called Hell is a fresh look at the Spaghetti Western genre. Unlike the others, this tends to be fuelled with originality and authenticity that strays far away from the styles of Leone. Infact, the movie abstains from incredibly long duels, cat and mouse sequences, witty comedy elements and the profounding array of Leone trademarks. Instead, what we have here is unique western directed by Robert Parrish that would probably fit in a political-revolutionary/drama-esque category. A Town Called Hell has an

incredible mix of subplots, each represented by the key characters, and at times this makes the film a little confusing. The story begins with a group of mexican revolutionists led by the characters of Robert Shaw and Martin Landau that storm into and massacre an entire town called ""Bastard"" that is controlled by military units. Years pass on, and the story shifts to a woman named Alvira (Stella Stevens) who sleeps in a hearst inside a dark carriage manned by a supposed deaf mute called Spectre (Dudley Sutton). They have arrived at the same town, which is now under the crooked mayorship of Don Carlos (Telly Savalas) and an entourage of revolutionists turned bandits. The film then re-introduces the character of Shaw, who is now an alcohol driven town priest that doesn't take too lightly to Savalas' dictatorship, though he tolerates it for the sake of the peasants of the village. With Alvira's arrival in town, she offers Don Carlos a reward for the deliverance of her husband's murderer and wishes to place the murderer's body in the hearst she rests in. She believes the killer is named ""Aguila"", a name that is respected and protected by the peasants including the priest. But she is not the only one searching for Aguila. The character of Martin Landau, now a traitor to the revolution, has returned to the town as an army colonel and is searching for the same person, as he believes Aguila to be the leader of the revolution. The

film itself is a very peculiar and strange addition to the Spaghetti Western genre. That said, the film delivers some nice performances particularly from Telly Savalas and Robert Shaw. If you liked ""Bullet for the General"" and you're looking for an interesting western that stands out in its originality and is far from Leone standards, then I strongly recommend this. But if you prefer your westerns strictly Leone, then i suggest you stay away from this one.",1118793600,5,2572,4.896788990825688
7839995,2,6303173802,"Released in 1971 and directed by Robert Parrish, A Town Called Hell (originally titled A Town Called Bastard) is a Euro Western about a Mexican town in 1915, which is more of a stone fortress than a conventional Western town, where everyone is seeking a man called Aguila, a mysterious revolutionary who massacred members of the town a decade earlier. Robert Shaw stars as the priest, Martin Landau as a brutal Mexican colonel, Stella Stevens as a vengeful widow and Telly Savalas as the corrupt mayor.

While Italians had nothing to do with this movie it smacks of a Spaghetti Western. Thankfully, its thoroughly austere and lacks the goofiness of some Italo oaters. The grim atmosphere is palpable with dust and heat. Typical of Euro Westerns, the score by Waldo de los Ros is notable. Theres a constant sound in the background, almost like the chirping of crickets, but obviously manmade, which Ive never heard in a movie before. The cast is great, highlighted by Stevens beauty. Speaking of whom, why does she sleep in a coffin like a corpse?

The storys another matter, however. The first half of the movie involves everyone looking for this guy named Aguila. Then shortly after the midway point we discover who he is but, no, hes not really Aguila; and so the search continues as the movie shares flashbacks. At the very end one of the characters seems to find Aguila and shouts out his name, but who cares? Im sure if you re-watch the movie and pay close attention you might be able to put the pieces together, but the mumbling dialogue (with no subtitle option) would make it a difficult task. Still, the solemn ambiance, quality cast and interesting score make A Town Called Hell worth catching for those who favor creative Westerns. Unfortunately, just because somethings creative doesnt mean its good.

A UK/Spanish production, the film runs 87 minutes (some prints run about 5 minutes longer) and was shot in Spain.

7839996,2,6303173802,I usually don't post movie reviews on Amazon but buyer beware - the soundtrack on this bluray release is ATROCIOUS. Half of it is inaudible. The movie itself is mediocre (with a wasted cast) but no excuse for this poor quality release. I don't necessarily mind a mediocre western but I'd like to know what they're saying.,1463702400,2,321,4.649122807017544
7839997,3,6303173802,"Here we have a British/Spanish collaboration lensed to compete with the Euro Westerns which were being cranked out with a rapid rate during the late Sixties.  Director Robert Parrish""s 'A TOWN CALLED HELL' aka 'A TOWN CALLED BASTARD' aka ''UNA CIUDAD LLAMADA BASTARD'- 1971 has a stellar cast in Robert Shaw, Telly Savalas, Martin Landau, and Stella Stevens but , unfortunately, lacks heart and soul making the violence that occurs merely window dressing to a complicated plot.  The film takes place during the Mexican Revolution in a town taken over by Mexican Bandit Don Carlos (Savalas) .  What he doesn't know is that five years before, two Mexican revolutionaries (Shaw, Landau) already graced its walls having Shaw becoming the priest of the town and Landau a General in search of a bounty ransom for Savalas.  Enter Stella Stevens into the mix as a widow who is offering a $20,000 ransom for the murderer of her husband and you have the gist of the story.  The film is peppered with great faces including Aldo Sambrell, Fernando Rey, Michael Craig and the great character actor Al Lettieri who played Salozzo the Turk in Director Francis Ford Coppola's 'THE GODFATHER' -1971 and who succumbed to a heart attack at age 47 in 1975.  Parrish directs in a lack lustre style making the actors go through the motions as they fill the images of cinematographer Manuel Berengeur.  The music soundtrack by Waldo De Los Rios is mediocre at best and but I was totally taken aback at hearing Sandy Shaw's ""THE BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS' in a bar room flashback making it seem like I was viewing another film entirely.  Kino Lorber releases its Blu-Ray on 1920x1080P with a 2.35 aspect ratio with the negative becoming a bit darker towards the climax.  It has a problem with its DTS soundtrack fluctuating from loud to a soft whisper and a slight hiss on its track.  Kino Lorber releases it is as it always does with no extras except a trailer to Director Sergio Corbucci's  excellent 'NAVAJO JOE' aka 'UN DOLLARO A TESTA'- 1966.  It's not a great Western by any means and wastes the talents of many.  For Western completists only.",1461456000,,2121,4.762295081967213

7840001,5,6303173802,"If you're a fan of spaghetti westerns, this one is totally worth a watch! As a fan of film I've watched countless westerns and this is one of the most under rated spaghetii westerns I've seen. The paceing is good, verry classically written, and the characters are great and well acted. Since it's a rare and old film and the transfer to DVD was off an obviously old and used reel of film, you'll be very disappointed if you're experiencing Blu Ray quality... it's barely VHS quality, which for me the grain and imperfections add to the experience and reminds me of watching old westerns in the cheep theater as a kid. It's most definitely a traditional ""spaghetti"" western, so if you prefer Hollywood, John Wayne westerns (not that there's anything wrong with that, the Duke is awesome in my opinion and so are his films) this is a much different style. It's similar to Sergio Leone film. If you're a fan of the Trinity trilogy and other non ""Hollywood"" westerns... there's most def worst ways to spend 5 bucks! I highly recommend this film!",1413936000,2,1041,4.632432432432433
7840002,1,6303173802,"First off,the transfer was beyond bad(almost unwatchable)you could hardly hear the movie. Secondly,according to the cover Telly Savalas was the main star. He was in the movie for a total of 15 minutes maybe. From what i could hear,the movie was allright but not worth spending any money on.",1300838400,2,290,4.938775510204081
7840003,2,6303173802,"""Town Called Hell"" is a Sergio Leone wannbe that fails at every level. It has a pretty good cast, including Robert Shaw, Martin Landau, Telly Savalas, Stella Stevens, Fernando Rey, and Al Lettieri to name a few. But the direction by Robert Parrish just doesn't add up. Parish was an Oscar winning film editor (""Body and Soul"") but never achieved excellence in any of his other endeavors, that included acting (30+ films) as well as directing (23 films).

Spaghetti westerns first appeared in the early 60s (""Tierra Brutal"", 1961) and became popular after the Sergio Leone/Clint Eastwood ""Man with No Name"" trilogy - ""Fistful of Dollars"" (1964), ""For a Few Dollars More"" (1965), and ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" (1966). Leone went on to make several more good ones without Eastwood (e.g., ""Duck You Sucker"", ""Once Upon a Time in the West""), but the peak period was clearly 1964 to 1970.

Robert Shaw plays a drunken priest who has a secret. Shaw, of course, is best remembered as the shark hunter from ""Jaws"" (1975) and the guy who got stung in ""The Sting"" (1973), but I liked him best in ""From Russia with Love"" (1963). He was nominated for an Oscar for his role in ""A Man for All Seasons"" (1966). What he's doing in this film, no one knows?

Telly Savalas chews up the scenery as a psychopathic outlaw. Savalas was ""Kojak"" for so many years it's hard to remember  that he gave great performances in films like ""Birdman of Alcatraz"" in 1962 (for which he was Oscar nominated) and my favorite, as Maggot in ""The Dirty Dozen"" (1968).

Martin Landau tries to give an earnest performance in a picture where people are being butchered right and left. Landau appeared in 100 films and was nominated 3 times for an Oscar and won once (""Ed Wood""), but he's probably best remembered for his many years on TV in ""Mission Impossible"".

The sexy and angelic Stella Stevens won the Golden Globe in 1960 as ""Best Promising Newcomer"" on the back of her role in ""Lil Abner"" (1959). She went on to make more than 100 films, and her best role for me was in Peckinpah's ""Ballad of Cable Hogue"" (1970).

The great Spanish actor Fernando Rey has a small role. Rey appeared in more than 200 films, mostly Spanish, but he had a significant presence in American films, including the Frog in ""The French Connection"" (1971).

Al Lettieri appears under so much makeup you probably won't recognize him. Lettieri gave memorable performances as the killer known as The Turk in ""The Godfather"" (1972) and the killer Rudy in ""The Getaway"" (1972).

With so much talent, how could you go wrong? A crazy script, poor sound track, and cheap production are the answers.",1277078400,3,2637,4.665948275862069
7840004,3,6303173802,"The acting and story are great but the transfer is just atrocious.  It's pan and scan so there's the first bad news.  Also this movie has been edited almost to death.  In one scene two people are on the gallows.  It then abruptly switches to an old woman running down the street srcreaming.  I can only infer that they were hanged.  This happens constantly throughout this transfer.  We are left to guess at what has occured.  The overall image and sound is below average.

Looking at the other releases on Amazon, it's hard to tell if there is a better quality DVD.  Brentwood(ASIN: B0000CNY5C) has issued one but it's the same running time(95 min).  There is another edition from Stonevision(?)(ASIN: B00004U0JG) it's listed as anamorphic.  None of the reviewers mentions anything about the quality.

What did I like about this movie?  Even with all the cuts the story is interesting and engrossing.  Robert Shaw and Martin Landau give suprisingly good performances in roles other actors may have just mailed in.  In one scene Martin Landau is eating a tortilla and compliments the cook.  That small scene just seemed authentic.  Robert Shaw at the end gives a speech to Stella Stevens that could have been but is not maudlin.  Telly Savalas(forever underated) gives the Don Carlos character a laid-back evilness.  Again it seems authentic.  Then there is Stella Stevens(what a beauty).  She does well with limited lines and understated role.  You also get to hear Johnny Horton's ""The Battle Of New Orleans""

My advice would be to get this.  It's not that expensive, but after you watch it you'll wonder how great this movie could be with a descent transfer.  This would seem like the perfect title for VCI or Anchor Bay to restore. Geneon [Pioneer]",1138233600,12,1752,4.854237288135593
