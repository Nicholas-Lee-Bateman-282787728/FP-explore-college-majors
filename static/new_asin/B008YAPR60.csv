8532432,2,B008YAPR60,We are BIG fans of Carly Rae so this rating isn't about her. The content doesn't go very deep about her life and several major events are repeated over and over. Interesting to a point but it could've been much shorter since not all that much is covered. The filming and narrating seem like something that would be done for a high-school video project and created on a PC. I'm glad I didn't pay more than $5.50 for the DVD (shipping included) as it really wasn't worth  more than that...,1432080000,,487,4.411111111111111
