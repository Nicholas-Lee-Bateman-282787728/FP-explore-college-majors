1851291,4,B00008L3S9,"Yes, there really are English teachers in the Army.  My sister-in-law was a civilian hired to improve the writing and reading of GIs who needed extra help.  This is a very funny movie and Danny Devito makes it worth watching.  It takes the right teacher to make Shakespeare worth reading.  I'd have paid a lot more attention in English class if I had a teacher like him!",1078704000,6,370,4.477611940298507
1851292,1,B00008L3S9,I was expecting a different kind of film. This movie was so boring even though it had a great cast. Total waste of time and money.,1072828800,,130,4.038461538461538
1851293,5,B00008L3S9,"I would just like to say that this is one great movie. very funny but yet has a touch of emotion. Very good cast which includes Danny Devito at his best. I still remember where he says in the movie, ""The choices we make, dictate the life we lead, to thy ownself be true."" Make this movie one of your choices and you won't regret it.",1055635200,3,332,4.045454545454546
1851294,4,B00008L3S9,"Believe it or not, I've used *Renaissance Man* in the classroom for a couple of reasons.  When we study the Renaissance in World History, our text makes reference to Leon Battista Alberti, the scholar and architect who, from a standing start and with his feet together, could leap over a man's head.  The DeVito character, in his efforts to get his students interested in Shakespeare, makes reference to Alberti in one scene in the movie, so I couldn't resist showing that clip in my class.  Then, since I taught the same students (high school freshmen) in English, I also showed all the clips related to the teaching of *Hamlet*.  I've been patiently waiting for the DVD to come out so I won't have to do the slow ""fast forwarding"" and can just leap to the clips I want.  The students usually get caught up in the characters as well, which is pure serendipity for me!",1054425600,34,868,4.574193548387097

1851348,5,B00008L3S9,"Bill Rego (Danny DeVito) had it all from being a successful father (maybe a tad self-centered) and advertising businessman. Now he is divorced and out of a job. He gets a job opportunity to use his skills to teach or bring a hand full of marginal soldiers up to military material. The soldiers of course are from all walks of life and bring with them different backgrounds and emotional luggage. He must learn how to do help each one accomplish the goal. He settles on Shakespeare as the learning tool as he is familiar with the material.
Will he succeed?

Does he learn anything in the process?
What effect does this have on the instructors he works with?
Do we come away with anything of worth?

There are many teaching ""the unruly"" movies out there and there will be many more. This one has a little more depth in also teaching the teacher. It is not some great unknown insight but a gradual awareness that benefits all involved. If you are planning on a pure comedy this may not be the film you are looking for as it has many comic moments yet has a message that supersedes those moments.",1504483200,,1092,4.455

1851366,5,B00008L3S9,"It has been a while since I first saw this movie, so on second viewing I found myself charmed off my feet again by some excellent acting and a crisp, funny and often poignant script. It is a ""feel good"" movie without being sappy or following a predictable formulaic story line.

There is one particular scene in the movie that is so spectacularly endearing and engaging that I don't even want to hint at what it is. You will know it when you see it.

I am sending this DVD to my brother because he just happens to have taught a class like this one and was an English major, along with having survived the surreal aspects of boot camp.

I think there are maybe five movies tops I wouldn't mind seeing again a third time. This is one of them.",1495497600,,740,4.23404255319149

Though it is set in America, it could as well be a film, set in any other country, in the world! Danny de Vito, plays the part as a mentor to ""raw"" recruits who have joined the armed force with the wrong motives(much like ""An officer and  a gentleman""), and are on the verge of being""let go"" unless  they ""pull themselves together"".And so a teacher, who himself is close  to being superannuated,chips away a the rough edges of these 'remedial recruits"" & gives these people , understanding, and a deeper knowledge of themselves, which in turn , transforms them into robust soldiers!

The social commentary regarding functionally illiteracy is very relevant today. The film suggests that one way to solve this massive problem is to introduce children and teens to great literature in a way that it speaks to them.

1851763,5,B00008L3S9,"This movie is an all time favorite of mine. Though the technology in the movie dates it somewhat, the story holds up. Worth the buy, and is a wonderful movie to watch on Veterans' Day or Memorial Day.

Mark Wahlberg proves himself a real actor, and puts to bed his Marky Mark persona. You can really believe he comes from a trailer park. He even makes the cover box art. The scene where Private Melvin gets a letter from his brother always makes me feel for the man, thinking about the kind of abuse he endured growing up. Haywood is right there, a friend keeping Melvin from sinking further into depression.

When Hobbes' voice over talks about Othello, it gets me wishing that a sequel focusing on Othello was/could be made. Gregory Hines as Sgnt. Cass was a simple performance, but endearing all the same. A fine actor now gone, no sequel for Sgnt. Cass.

The ""star"" Danny DeVito begins the film much like in his other performances, but later you realize that his character has given up a passion to make money. When Bill Rago sees this for himself, and realizes he's been pushing his daughter to do the same thing, there is a great change in the man.

As the cover states, ""Sold Laughs"", but also real dramatic heart. I think I will now go watch this movie again.",1409961600,3,1267,4.471861471861472

The ridged boot camp in the movie was cool and I liked Devito's character, he introduces William Shakespeare to the army men and woman in the movie. It talks about war and how this group of misfits come together to achieve a common goal, to trust each other, especially in a time of war and to learn how to work hard for what you want and not to be handed any for free. The drill instructor Hines really did not like Devito's character but in the end grew to respect Devito's reason for teaching these student soldiers. Regina.",1385596800,5,757,4.263888888888889

Shall be my brother . . . Crispin Crispian speech Shakespeare

Unemployed, divorced adman Danny DeVito's Rago must accept any offered job or lose unemployment benefits. As English teacher to Army recruits he discovers his capacity for empathy, generosity, parental sacrifice.

The ""Double D's"" don't believe themselves capable of success. Their Drill Sgt Gregory Hines reinforces their lack of faith in themselves. Hilarious ""New York"" mimics famous lines from movies, and has a tragic story behind his urban pride. Sexy tumbleweed of a girl doubts her own competence, having been dragged about by a mother more interested in men than mothering.

A clearly bright young man hides his mental incandescence, why? A burly football player has leadership potential yet hesitates to take risks. Demoralized ""trailer trash"" seems lost without identity or self-worth. A fatherless young man is similarly without compass, though he idolizes the father he knows only from stories he was told.

Curiosity about their teacher Rago's favorite reading Hamlet leads to Rago sharing his passion for words, meaning, theater, drama, metaphor, oxymoron. Time conflicts between English and Drills force Rago to compete for his students' time on a climbing wall. DeVito is laugh out loud funny.

Thomas Huxley: Science . . . warns me to be careful how I adopt a view which jumps with my preconceptions, and to require stronger evidence for such belief than for the one to which I was previously hostile. My business is to teach my aspirations to conform themselves to fact, not to try and make facts harmonize with my aspirations.

All the funny characters in this moving tale change their points of view: from thinking little of themselves as capable human beings to being able to quote Shakespeare as marching drill, from denigrating literacy as inferior to marching to respecting the power of words equally, from avoiding risk of failure to self-confidence in trying and being willing to be thrown out of the Army, from being a selfish egotist to being generous of time, caring and respect.

Laughter as good medicine.

Nothing has a stronger influence psychologically on their environment
and especially on their children,

With malice toward none, with charity for all,
with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right,
let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds,
to care for him who shall have borne the battle and
for his widow and his orphan to do all which may
achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace

The acting was superb, and the message it gives makes it a great film, especially if you've ever been in the military or are in now.  Yeah, there's stuff to laugh at in that some things would never happen ""in real life"", but that's the purpose of movies - to pull you in and suspend belief for that brief time you are watching it.

But it is done so beautifully and yet it shows his inner strength and character stands tall!  Whether you are a DeVito fan as I am or love military movies, you can't go wrong with this one. There is drama yet the one liners had me rolling with laughter. Basic training is given a whole new meaning for those of us that have never served in the military.

1852131,4,B00008L3S9,"Shakespeare's _Hamlet_ is the real star of the comedy _Renaissance Man_.  Many films have featured groups of social misfits who have grown and changed through the assistance of a caring teacher, but in how many of those films has the teacher been dead for almost 400 years?  Danny Devito is funny in this family-friendly film, but it is the Bard himself who shines best here.

 I use this film in my college-level Shakespeare courses and find that it is more useful for teaching Shakespeare to young adults than most of the recent film adaptations aimed at the younger generation (_She's the Man_ and _10 Things I Hate About You_ come to mind).  _Renaissance Man_ celebrates the magic of Shakespeare that even recent films preserving Shakespeare's language, such as the _Hamlet_ starring Ethan Hawke, do not.  In _Renaissance Man_, Shakespeare's beautiful language is not replaced.  Rather, it is read and then internalized by the characters who produce their own modernized version in the form of a rap song and chant.  The film teaches about some of Shakespeare's rhetorical strategies (e.g., metaphor, oxymoron) as well as his themes (e.g., mutability).  While the recitation of Henry the Fifth's famous ""Crispin Day"" speech at the end of the film is a little sappy, the characters' reaction to and obvious enjoyment of the _Henry V_ stage production is not.  The characters in _Renaissance Man_ model for the young people of today how Shakespeare should be experienced.",1173916800,3,1473,5.074688796680498

If you like Danny Devito.. he is great. The group of actors in this movie work well together. It is a very nice enjoyable film.",1173484800,,195,3.875
1852133,4,B00008L3S9,"This is one of Danny DeVito best movies ever, it just shows you can put him in any style comedy movie and it will be funny. This and Major Payne are to very funny movies that have a military theme to them. So if you have enjoyed any movie with DeVito in it but have not seen this yet I suggest you see it",1168819200,,304,3.765625

1852135,5,B00008L3S9,"The movie is a great one.  It shows how through literature, you can open peoples minds, to show them a way of thinking that they may not have know they could reach.  The contrast of the military ""Double D'S"" and Shakespeare provides rich dialog and a great story line.  This DVD is worth watching.",1168300800,,297,4.462962962962963

1852166,5,B00008L3S9,"This is one of the best movies I have ever watched. Danny Devito is excellent as the main character, and his supporting cast members are wonderful. I found myself running the gamut of emotions. It has drama, humor, sadness, joy. I recommend it to anyone.",1167782400,,254,4.666666666666667
1852167,5,B00008L3S9,"This storyline shows a struggle between educators and the government that exists everyday. While a basic education is considered important, how much people get out of it isn't a main focus to many people. Even certain subjects such as music, literature, and art are often thought of as inessential and are often cut from many school programs. This movie shows that struggle of educators trying to better their students under the pressure of those higher up trying to impose different priorities.

Someday, I hope to be an educator in music and I will have to fight the system everyday. I hope to show this movie to my students so they understand that education can really change people for the better and that it's important.",1167696000,,725,4.846774193548387

1852169,5,B00008L3S9,"This movie is truly a good way to look at how Shakespear can help even bottom of the barrel Army recruits can grow and become a true Band of Brothers and Sisters. This movie also shows how one can find a new meaning in life if one just opens their mind to new possiblities.

This is one of the best movies I've ever watched and it keeps me comming back and watching it over and over again.

true this is a rather long movie for it's type and there are some slow boring parts bt these are few and quickly bypassed by the main story.

Overall...  A good movie for the family and something everyone can gain a little more knowledge and understanding from. A movie for all ages.",1157155200,,674,4.2015503875969
1852170,1,B00008L3S9,"I teach in an inner-city middle school. I have used this film for many years in connection with an article on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs to demonstrate that our decisions in life are made based on our perceived needs.  The course I teach is preparing low income/poverty level students for going to college and breaking the cycle of meager education and low income.  Renaissance Man has multiple messages and valuable lessons - AND a cool introduction to Shakespeare.  There is no sex, no nudity, no violence.  The ""R"" rating comes from a bit of profanity (including the ""F"" word) but the profanity is lower frequency than what I hear in the hallway in any given passing period.",1156550400,9,678,4.769230769230769
1852171,5,B00008L3S9,I love this movie dearly and I'm so happy that I was able to obtain it in DVD form.  It arrived in a timely fasion and is in perfect conditon.,1155686400,2,142,3.7333333333333334
1852172,5,B00008L3S9,"Renaissance Man is truly one of the better movies created to show a realistic picture of early Army training.  Gregory Hines, as the Drill Instructor, doesn't have the time to nursemaid the ""duds"" that the system has sent him.  So the system brings in a specialist to bring them up to speed.  The building of self-respect is critical to the formation of these individuals into soldiers and the movies does a fine job of showing their progression from civilian to soldier.

Finally, the ""St. Crispin's Day"" speech from ""Henry V"" by the recruit was truly inspiring.  No matter how many times I hear it, I still get misty and covered in goose-bumps.  ""We few, we happy few - We band of brothers"" truly describes the bond between soldiers.",1144972800,14,735,4.703125
1852173,5,B00008L3S9,Danny DeVito was awesome in Renaissance Man.  The story was heartwarming and he played his character with great style.  Loved it.,1141776000,,129,5.095238095238095
1852174,5,B00008L3S9,"This is one of my faith movies. The faith movies fall into 2 scenarios. One where I watch it on faith that it will be a good movie, and then there's the other scenario where it strikes a chord in my heart, and makes me wake up and listen. The day I saw this movie my heart and faith were in the toilet. I remember feeling sorry for myself, and yet at the same time I remember walking through EPCOT flipping the bird at everyone as I wanted to pick a fight because I was feeling that downhearted. The characters of this movie were all out of faith too:

Bill Rago: Divorced ad artist who lost the biggest account, and his job in one day; is regulated to take a job as a teacher in guess where? The U.S. Army.

Jackson Leroy: Former college football superstar who after a serious injury to his knee had to give up his dream, and make a living for his wife, and soon to be child. Fortunately, he had a good wife to keep him going as his education was limited.

Tommy Lee Haywood: His bubble was burst when the paper mill where he worked was shut down, and with no real college education he was stuck in a trailer.

Miranda Myers : Had a mother who more or less needed a man, and it didn't matter to her whether she needed a daughter, or not.

Melvin Melvin: This is a real name. Tendency to fall asleep as he was the victim of physical abuse growing up.

Brian Davis: Didn't have a father growing up, and that made him feel incomplete as he knew his father was over in Veitnam, but didn't know all the details of how he died.

Donald Benetiz: Wisecracking New Yorker who just didn't seem to have any ambition...especially after the tragic death of his sister.

Jamal Montgomery: Thoroughly undisciplined and arrogant as it seems as though his parents just turned him over to the wolves.

Roosevelt(Nathanial)Hobbs: Quiet unassuming guy, and that's the way he wanted it kept as he was looking for salvation from his past.

Rago is in charge of trying to help all these recruits survive boot camp as they are physically, mentally, and emotionally challenged. This is actually based on a true story where Rago the teacher gets them to succeed academically, and physically, and emotionally by having them read the Shakesphere play ""Hamlet"". He begins to see some fruit from this that no other person could probably see, and so are the recruits as they've discovered talents they never knew that they had. This movie is not your average comedy, nor your average drama for that matter, but it will grab you somehow even if you don't like it. If it doesn't it's up to you.",1113955200,5,2562,4.420382165605096
