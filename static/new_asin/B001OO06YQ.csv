8330976,3,B001OO06YQ,"This is a Direct-to-video sequel to the 1983 Matthew Broderick movie is a more of an upgrade of the original movie, but it is watchable. This time, the out-of-control supercomputer has access to modern technology and weapons: drone attack fighters, street corner cameras, the built in federal wire-tapping technology.

  The plot revolves around the same premise: a supercomputer charged with stopping terrorists (the post-911 villian du jour) is given way too much power and starts offing anyone that fits the loosly defined description of a ""bad guy"". The main object of the computer's ire is a hacker who beats it on an online game.

  There are chases, explosions, and a predictable ending, but I have seen worse. If you buy this, don't pay too much.",1235865600,2,754,4.992
