7960782,3,B0000648Z3,"Why are all the releases' comments in the same window? This makes no sense. The first two WuTang Clan Kung Fu dvd sets are similarly bunched together, even tho they are totally different sets.

I rated this a 3 because some of the releases here deserve a 5, and some a 1, but acording to Amazon, it's all the same.

Amazon, if you want us to buy from you with confidence, you have to stop listing every dvd release of every film with the same comments. This is totally unprofessional and inexcusable.

Every release is *not* the same. Especially when it comes to films that weren't mass-reproduced in either english or widescreen.",1155945600,,630,4.607142857142857
7960783,3,B0000648Z3,"The Mei Ah disc of DRAGON'S CLAWS (1979) is letter-boxed and offers two language tracks, Cantonese and Mandarin, with English subtitles. The print is a little on the washed-out side, with scenes in sunlight reading way too bright, but otherwise the image is quite clear with strong colors and represents a marked improvement over earlier English-dubbed VHS releases of this title. Unlike the experience of the previous reviewer, my copy of this disc played fine on various players with no problems.

One of the reasons to seek out this film is the presence in the cast of leading lady Kan Chia Fong, who is currently experiencing a renewed interest thanks to her starring role as the landlady in Stephen Chow's crossover hit of 2005, KUNG FU HUSTLE, in which she is billed as Yuen Qiu. This actress has a long history in kung fu films, having started out as a contemporary of Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao at the same Chinese Opera school where they studied as youths (she was in a separate women's division). She appeared in the James Bond film, THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN (1975) as one of the kung fu-fighting schoolgirls who help out Bond in Thailand in one memorable scene. She appeared in quite a few kung fu films in the 1970s and 80s, including DREADNAUGHT, BASTARD SWORDSMAN and CRAZY SHAOLIN DISCIPLES.

This unsung actress is seen to particularly good advantage in DRAGON'S CLAWS, in which she plays the mother of the young hero (Jimmy Liu), an aspiring kung fu fighter who has to learn various dragon fist techniques so he can beat the villain (played by Hwang Jang Lee), an old enemy of his father who has reappeared on the scene after 18 years. She has many good scenes in the movie, fighting Hwang Jang Lee at one point and his two henchmen, ""Red Monster"" and ""Green Monster,"" at another. More often, she is seen training her son in dragon fist techniques passed on by her father. In one clever bit, she hits her son with little dabs of noodle paste to show him the 36 vital points of the body. She does all her own fighting and acrobatic stunts and is an absolute delight to watch. The film itself, directed by one of the great kung fu directors, Joseph Kuo (BORN INVINCIBLE, 7 GRANDMASTERS, NINJA CHECKMATE), is a better-than-average kung fu film, with many well-staged fight scenes, a consistently interesting storyline, good cinematography and a strong cast of performers.",1114819200,,2399,4.723150357995227
7960784,1,B0000648Z3,"This is the Mei Ah Laser Disc dvd movie Dragon's Claws! It is a sucky product! I bought 2 copies of this film! the first time it quit playing after 15 or 20 minutes! the screen would become blocky and movie will start pausing! The second time I bought this thing, after 45 minutes the movie will start pausing on it's own! This Mei Ah product is quite questionable but I'd advise against this product!",1108944000,,401,4.36
