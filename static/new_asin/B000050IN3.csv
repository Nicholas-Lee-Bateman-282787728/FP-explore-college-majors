1385463,1,B000050IN3,"Please do not waste your time buying this DVD! Half of the feature would not work, the episode would skip and the theme song is some cheap knock-off. I was very disappointed with the whole DVD. I wish someone would come out with the Andy show in seasons like any other respectable show. Please give this show some dignity and respect.",1065657600,25,334,4.491803278688525

1385465,5,B000050IN3,"This DVD is one of the best quality Andy Griffith collection out there.  I have seen a few other DVDs that the picture and sound quality is so poor its hard to enjoy.  The quality here is great considering how old AG Show is.  Plus if your a Barney Fife fan like me, you'll enjoy every one of the episodes.  This DVD takes you back to the simple life in Mayberry NC, and is one the whole family will watch over and over again.",1028592000,22,426,4.035714285714286
1385466,4,B000050IN3,"Our family has really enjoyed this DVD. It is disappointing to start each episode without the original theme music/song but the quality of the episodes more than make up for this. The added/bonus material has been fun to look at. My youngest daughter has memorized the ""Music Video"" about the crawdad hole and I find her singing it from time to time. We have ordered the ""Best of Andy"" DVD and I am sure we will enjoy it also.",1000339200,8,426,4.405063291139241
1385467,5,B000050IN3,"This is a good DVD with only one let-down. The let down is it does not have the original whistling theme song. But it has just as good picture quality as TV LAND. IT IS WORTH BUYING.

1385468,3,B000050IN3,"A pretty good selection of Andy Griffith Classics, although I'm sure all fans will have different ideas about what episodes they would have liked to have had on a Barney ""Best Of"" (I for one would have liked to have a couple of his guest appearances from the color years thrown in). There are some cute little extras, like ""music video"" clips of the Darling Family, and a gallery of promotional art work--not a bad disc for a low-budget company (but keep in mind, this IS from a low budget company--don't expect Criterion here).
The only real drawback to the collection (given that it is budget) is that the company that released it apparantly couldn't (or didn't want to) afford to buy rights to the show's theme song. So instead of the familiar opening title whistling theme and the reading of teh stars' names, we get an abbreviated opening with some really queer synthisized whistling that sounds like it belongs on a Barney the giant talking Dinosaur than a DVD of Barney Fife!
Anyway, a decent buy for the price.",977443200,13,1018,4.661111111111111

7928974,1,B000050IN3,"These episodes are not the best of Barney Fife. Some of his best stuff would include:

(in no particular order)

Citizen's arrest

The bank job

Barney in the choir

The rumor

Three's a crowd

Convicts at large

Three wishes for Opie

PS: Do yourself a favor and get one (or more) of the full season boxed sets from Paramount; my favorite seasons are 4 and 2. They did a great job restoring the episodes. Crisp and clear picture and sound.",1181174400,2,440,4.4
7928975,3,B000050IN3,"WEll, all of the episodes are good, and in ok quality.. Nothing special... That original theme is gone, and some gay piano thing is put in, but its not that bad, but a little irritiating.. Also, like one of the other viewers said, its the same eight episodes, that have been produced by a million different companys, and packages... But hey, if you don't have them, and they are this cheap, then its great.. No complaints.. Just don't expect a great thing.",1177459200,,456,4.573170731707317

7928977,3,B000050IN3,"The main thing I noticed about this set is that the image is DARK. I've got a few other Andy Griffith sets, and they all look better than this one. The sound is good, however, and in my opinion it's hard to call anything with Barney bad! It's inexplicable to me that they ditched the original theme music and replaced it with some lame synthesizer track. But I guess that doesn't ruin it entirely. Here are the episodes:

* High Noon in Mayberry - An ex-convict returns to settle the score with Andy.

* The Great Filling Station Robbery - Barney tries modern criminal detection methods.

* The Rivals - Barney attempts to teach Opie the ways of women.

* Dogs, Dogs, Dogs - A pack of stray dogs make the courthouse home.

* The Loaded Goat - A farmer's goat makes a menacing mean of dynamite.

* Barney's First Car - A little old lady sells Barney a lemon.

* A wife for Andy - Barney goes fishing for a wife for Andy.

* The Big House - Two big city convicts do time at ""The Rock.""",1105660800,42,983,4.191489361702128

The only down fall is that they don't include the origional theme song.",1075852800,11,168,4.451612903225806
