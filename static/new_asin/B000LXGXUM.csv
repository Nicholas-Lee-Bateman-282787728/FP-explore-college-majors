2716060,5,B000LXGXUM,"This movie is enchanting and funny, not to mention good graphics and cute outfits and hairstyles. Overall good family movie, I mean girls family movie.  The plot revolves around a story that happened when the girls were 3 or 4.  Their mom, a pixie queen, got turned into a tree by the black pixie, who got weakened in the process and only regained strength when the girls were teens. The girls discover the plot to overturn the king, aka dad, and remember the family promise to stick together.  Their friends help them fight the black pixies and once again good prevails.  Lesson on family ties for the little ones.",1180656000,9,615,4.614678899082569

2716062,5,B000LXGXUM,"I sent this to my 7 year old granddaughter in Alaska. She had to wait for it to thaw out when they got it out of the mailbox, but told me she thought it looked beautiful.

I called her a few hours later and she said she loved it, it was a great video.

To me that's all that matters.  She got it quickly and I was able to have it shipped directly to her.  So, we are both happy!!  Thanks",1173657600,9,387,3.728395061728395
2716063,5,B000LXGXUM,Amazon price was less than the store! I received the product the day after the movie came out. Very impressive!,1173312000,2,111,4.6
2716064,1,B000LXGXUM,"A lot of reviews on here rate this DVD highly because the kids like it.  Some kids would like ice cream and gummy bears for every meal but that doesn't mean parents should provide them.  This DVD is really, really disturbing.  The plot is strange and dark and made me (as an adult) uncomfortable.  Many videos have some sort of fantasy/mysticism but this one was closer to the dark side of things.  (Side note--it's not even rated.)  The female characters are dressed inappropriately (very short skirts, midriffs) and some of the dialogue and visuals are sexually suggestive.  Yes, your kids will probably like it.  Don't buy it.",1324857600,6,629,4.813084112149533
2716065,4,B000LXGXUM,"I watched this dvd with my kids and found it kind of disturbing. I don't think it's suitable for young kids as it seems a bit dark and scary. Having said that, my kids like it and have watched it several times. I guess it's up to the individual mothers to determine if it's suitable...maybe check it out on youtube first.",1303862400,,321,4.278688524590164
2716066,2,B000LXGXUM,This was the first Bratz movie I have seen.  My daughter wanted to watch it.  I thought the graphics were poorly done and the story was strange.  My daughter does like it which is why I gave this two stars.,1285977600,2,206,4.1
2716067,3,B000LXGXUM,"My daughter loves all the Bratz movies and this one was no exception.  It was fun, great graphics and color.  As usually new characters were introduced some fun and some mysterious.  They make the boys Dillion and Cameron do funny things, which is typical of boys in love or struck by beauty and mystery.  As usual it comes down to friendship, understanding of one another and helping when you can!",1271980800,2,398,4.642857142857143
2716068,5,B000LXGXUM,Nice movie but I don't have any dolls from this movie but I really want them. Awesome movie!,1248998400,,92,4.166666666666667

2716072,5,B000LXGXUM,"My daughter loves it! It's all that matters! My sister, who's 12, thinks that this animation is a bit less interesting than Bratz Rock Angels. But, I think she's just too old for this kind of thing. For my daughter (8) it is very interesting, or at least so she says.",1188000000,,267,4.254901960784314

8164829,5,B000LXGXUM,"Bratz Fashion Pixiez centers around a group of close knit friends (Breeana, Melvino, Cymbeline etc.) and their adventures of navigating around life (as well as school). Mysterious things start to happen as each member of the group starts to act differently, (including one of the boys in the group). Additionally, the out of characteristic behavior becomes more apparent when a few of the members are trying to organize the Magnolia Ball and notice that one of the members do not care to help with the volunteer festivities even though her father is both an organizer and funder of the event.  I also like the positive message that there is more to people than what they appear to be on the external surface/external appearance.",1435795200,,728,4.91869918699187

8164832,1,B000LXGXUM,"This movie is awful! How in the world this is rated G is also a mystery- I found the themes way too adult for my daughter, and the story is kind of dark & disturbing. It's also very poorly done the graphics and animation seem very low quality the dialogue seems to have been written by a non native English speaker. Two thumbs down. There are so many better movies out there for k u decide that t are educational fun lighthearted or actually teach a life lesson....don't waste your time on this junk!",1410998400,2,500,4.329787234042553
8164833,5,B000LXGXUM,This movie is so adorable and my six year old daughter loves it. I was amazed at how fast it arrived at my home after I ordered it. I had it within 3 days and had a estimated 2 week arrival date. This movie is perfect for age 3 and up for sure..its a 10 star movie.,1396656000,,265,3.6666666666666665
