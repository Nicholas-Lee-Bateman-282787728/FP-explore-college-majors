8006241,5,B00014EDWG,This video is very well done.  It teaches Torah values in  a way that is appealing and entertaining. It's a win-win!,1265673600,,116,4.476190476190476
8006242,5,B00014EDWG,"For those who have outgrown Uncle Moishe, these videos are entertaining and educational - appropriate for the whole family. Dr. Lo Tov is the archetypal villian, yet he is foiled by Agent Emes!",1265587200,,193,4.878787878787879
8006243,5,B00014EDWG,"Another great release in what can now be dubbed a series. Totally funny and engrossing in its plot and really animated characters - and not just 'Emes'; all his friends too - even his Rebbe!

Don't miss this one.",1113264000,,212,4.435897435897436
8006244,4,B00014EDWG,"This is among the first quality Jewish videos to enter the entertainment scene.  Very professionally done, funny, and very entertaining.  ""Secret Agent Emes"" has become a household name here, with the kids doing a LOT of play-acting long after the video has been shut off.  I've even found the baby with dark sunglasses on!  Definitely worth it!!

I was concerned that the kidanapping scenes would be too scary for my kids - but then I saw that those scenes were done in a goofy way making the kidnappers look like a bunch of 'shlemazels', so the scene becomes more funny than anything else.

We also own the first video and the kids like that plenty, too!",1106352000,,656,4.612068965517241

8006246,5,B00014EDWG,This is an entertaining video that my children ages 4-10 enjoy watching over and over again!,1106179200,,92,4.8125
8006247,5,B00014EDWG,"this is great entertainment for ALL Jewish children. My kids love the video and I don't feel guilty putting them in front of the tv with it.  I plan to buy all episodes. Keep them coming!!!
