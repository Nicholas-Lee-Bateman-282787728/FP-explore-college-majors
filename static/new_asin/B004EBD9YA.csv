4336168,5,B004EBD9YA,Any one who likes football especially Alabama Football will enjoy this movie. Nick Saban gamechanger is great  Nick Saban Gamechanger is for all Alabama fans.,1357084800,4,158,5.32
4336169,5,B004EBD9YA,"there's a reason Nick Saban will most likely go down as the best college football coach of the past quarter century. His philosophy is built on solid, practical beliefs. He doesn't BS and the results are three BCS titles and an impending fourth in less than a decade. That ranks right up there with the likes of Bryant and Rockne. I highly recommend this for any fan of college football.",1355356800,4,387,4.542857142857143
4336170,4,B004EBD9YA,"As a college football fan, it is fun to watch the developments, on the field and off,which led to Alabama's 2009 national championship season.
All of that is colorfully provided in this DVD. So any fan can enjoy it.

Just as interesting, and perhaps, even more enduring, is that the DVD Nick Saban: Gamechanger may also be one of the best instructionals for managers ever released.
And Nick Saban is nothing if not a successful manager.
Strip away all of the football footage and what remains on this DVD is a description of what has become known as The Process.
The Process is Saban's approach to managing all of the aspects of running a successful college football program.
That's nothing to sneeze at. While I'm not sure what Alabama football generates in revenue, another successful entity, the University of Texas' program, was projected in 2012 to earn more than $90 million.

The Process can be summed up in Saban's mantra to every one involved with his team, ""Do Your Job!"".
He doesn't ask his players to win every game. He does insist that they try and win every play.
If they do what they have been trained to do, that is all that is required.
The end result is that all the small steps add up to a successful journey.
The same is true for the coaches, the admin staff, all the way down to the custodians.
Everyone's job is detailed, training is provided, and clarity of task is a certainty.

With the trend toward minimizing training and allowing employees to drift into unproductive tasks, managers and employers are failing their subordinates.
Highly successful leadership can be provided through clear communication and consistency of message.
Just ask Nick Saban. And his three National Championships.
All of that and football footage too are found in the DVD Nick Saban: Gamechanger.",1351123200,15,1799,4.815533980582524

4336174,5,B004EBD9YA,Great CD with useful information from the best in the business!,1405296000,,63,4.818181818181818
4336175,5,B004EBD9YA,"I am an Alabama fan but even if this DVD had Nick Saban coaching at (God Forbid) Auburn or Notre Dame it is a terrific motivational
experience. How he manages different aspects of the game, coaches and players is exactly why many CEO's have said this is how a successful should be run. Great interviews with other coaches.

I have a son who just went through the recruiting process with small schools (not schools close to the caliber of the SEC), Last year he had a receiver and this year a running back on his team that Saban has already made offers. From what reporters told me and players say the Alabama football program and Saban is all business!!! Different from other schools.",1404345600,,684,4.560975609756097

4336177,5,B004EBD9YA,"It is a great story about Nick and his Father.  The best part of the whole film is the fact the my daughter, Sissy and Granddaughter, Libby Duke are in the film with Terry Saban at the Nick's Kids benefit.  We had loaned our copy to someone who never returned it so we purchased another.",1400976000,,287,4.2
4336178,5,B004EBD9YA,Great way of telling Sabans story. Some personal moments help one see the other side of Saban. Extra scenes let you get to know Sabans complete background.,1394928000,,155,4.777777777777778

4336180,5,B004EBD9YA,The process as shared by Coach Saban is a true picture of what drives him as a person and as a coach. Evan this dvd was controlled because I could not choose play until I watched the bonus materials which was a good idea before playing the dvd. I really enjoyed listening to and watching his saga unfold with all his influences that has led him to become one of the finest coaches of college football of all time. It is good to watch a principled person put into play his way onto the young people that go through Alabama's football program. It also showed how his wife has been truely supportive of his direction in life. They seem to truely share everything. Coaching is hard enough without the support of the spouse and children. A very good watch.,1373155200,,751,4.410071942446043
4336181,5,B004EBD9YA,"Nick Saban is a coach like no other. He has managed to take his teams to win national titles at 3 different schools, for a bunch of different wins.

4336183,5,B004EBD9YA,"We got this DVD for Christmas last year and it was really interesting if you're a die hard Bama fan like everyone in our family is. Gives you an idea of why Saban has been so successful as Alabama's coach and how he supports the entire athlete - not just athletic prowess, but the whole person - intellectual, emotional, psychological, and physical. This is a great addition to your Bama collection.",1357171200,4,399,4.633802816901408
