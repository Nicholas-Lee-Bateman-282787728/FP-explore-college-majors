11413,3,0767815963,"I am very annoyed with the video that I bought off this website. I had the video recorded from t.v years ago and accidently loaned it out to someone. When I found it on amazon, needless to say I was thrilled, until I watched  it. You cut out the major scenes from the movie like when Fozzie does his  stand up comedy act with the snowmen and when the Muppet babies video is  cut short. I don't mind little edits, but editing out these parts is  absolutely ridiculious! I would have given the movie five stars, but since  it has been butchered, it only receives three stars. People who have never  seen this movie would never notice the edits, but if you're like me and you  have watched this video about 5 million times, you will definetly notice  the edits. You shouldn't even be selling the movie like this! It ruins the  whole story! Therefore, I will continue to look for my old copy and watch  the one I recorded off Odyseey instead.",947462400,204,938,4.369942196531792
11414,3,0767815963,"I love this movie.  It has always and will always be my favorite Christmas movie.  I recorded it from t.v. when it first came on in the 80's.  In about 1994, my mom recorded over it.  I was so mad!  I haven't seen it  since until I bought it on Amazon.com.  I received it yesterday and watched  it immediately.  As the movie went on, I began to notice strange things.  Parts of the movie had been removed!  I felt let down.  My advice is to be  careful when you buy something.",945388800,12,476,4.0989010989010985
11415,5,0767815963,this was one of my favorites back when I had it taped from television.  It is a sweet tale of the Muppets sharing Christmas together.  It is a classic tale for young and old.

11446,5,0767815963,"This is the BEST Muppet movie. EVER.

Let me say that again. This is the BEST Muppet movie. Ever.

I'm lucky enough to have a ""version"" on dvd that includes the original ""Sleighride number"" and all the others that are cut but before I got that, I had this VHS, which is an opener for me to the entire Holiday Season.

Kermit and co, and THEN Seseme Street, and THEN Fraggle Rock all come together in this fine masterpiece of muppet madness and it's something that has remained with me ever since I saw the original broadcast when I was a lad.

My god, even today, at 36 years old, I STILL get that warm fuzzy feeling in my gut when Gonzo and the Turkey are about to throw down when suddenly Kermit yells, ""Hark! Me thinks me hears carolers!"" And then, when the Seseme street gang comes in signing Deck the Halls, this big smile creeps upon my face and all that is wrong in the real world and the crappy things that goes on in real life just seems to melt away as the whole family comes together to celebrate Christmas.

This is the best muppet movie. Ever. Even the 10 minute long medley at the end is something that you just can't help but watch because it's all great. It's all warm. It's all.... good. There isn't a single  dull moment int his entire movie.

As far as the actual VHS aspect of this listing..... I don't know if there IS an official DVD version. I'm fairly certain there isn't an official version with the cut scenes edited back in either, but this VHS will do. The cut scenes are edited out in such a way, though, that if you haven't ever seen the original, you'll be wondering why Fozzie runs into the house screaming for Kermit after telling the snowman to stay ""right where you are"" because you won't be aware that the snowman is Fozzie's new partner.

But... other than that... you need to get this movie in any format, any way, any version you possibly can because.....

THIS IS THE BEST MUPPET MOVIE EVER.",1464307200,,1931,4.341666666666667

11487,3,0767815963,"While I had marvelous service from the seller, this did not turn out to be the version I was hoping for. There are known complaints about the heavily edited nature of A Muppet Family Christmas, so I should have done my research better before buying it, but it seems that the all-regions import version is not the same as the UK version which supposedly has the unedited, original show. I made the assumption they were the same and didn't think to contact the seller and ask, so this is purely my own fault.

While I am glad to have at least a partial (although confusingly edited) version, and I really did get quick and excellent service as well as a great buy from the seller, I am still in the market for the elusive, full-content version of A Muppet Family Christmas. This particular version (due to copyright law and everyone wanting a piece of the financial pie) was very heavily edited before being sold in the US and many of the best songs (and thereby best scenes) are missing. This leads to non-existent scene transitions, random jumps in the story line, and an overall confusing film. Rather than a classic Muppet film and a nostalgic hearkening back to younger days which you can't wait to share with your family, it ends up as messy Muppet mayhem which fails to live up to memory's expectations.",1412640000,4,1308,4.589743589743589

11498,2,0767815963,"My mother taped this wonderful holiday classic on VHS when it first aired on TV for me and my brother when we were little and every year around Christmas I would (and still do) watch this holiday classic with my family. So a couple years ago when I saw that they had finally put it on DVD I thought 'Alright it's finally on DVD!' but it was so expensive, even the VHS's were selling for 20 to 40 dollars. So one year after Thanksgiving I started calling every video rental store in town just to see if they had this movie for rent and only one store did. I was really excited about it at first but when I started watching it I noticed that some things were cut out from the movie. Like Fozzy's musical comedy bit with the snowman (It's a very noticeable jump), the muppet home movies (that whole scene was cut out). Miss Piggy musical bit when she finally makes it to the farm house, and a small scene is missing when they do their 'Carol sing'.

I'm glad I only rented it and spent 2 bucks rather then spending more buying it. All I can say is save your money, if you've seen the original 'uncut' version that was aired in the 80's this DVD is not for you.",1387929600,,1157,4.165178571428571

I Wish I knew someone who had a tape of it I could borrow! I would be glad to have to fast forward though the commercials. As much as I love the show. It's the end seeing Jim Henson smiling and talking to sprocket that was my favorite part. He died a year or two after it premiered.

If they had made it $25 I would have bought it.  $30 and I would have given in eventually, but a $70 pricetag means I will be pirating it.  Boo Friggin Hoo all the way to your multi-billion dollar theme parks.  I guess children aren't a priority to them anymore.  How grotesque.

Other Muppet characters straggle in as the show progresses, and the entire Sesame Street crew arrives to help celebrate!  The Fraggles even come around after Kermit and Robin stumble across the hole that leads to their cave.  With the family coming full circle, it's a full house brimming with love, laughs, and fun.

I know this is a rarity, I just don't know why. Having had this video since I was a lad, and keeping it to bust out every Christmas, has earned me a lot of fans in the little tikes circuit. Every kid ever has really loved this one!  The one hour(ish) special is hillarious, and features not only the Muppets, but also the entire cast of Sesame Street, and Fraggle Rock (if you weren't a kid in the eighties, you may not know those guys, but they are there!) Antics are served up all around. Like when the swedish chef tries to cook big bird for dinner, after the turkey gives him the slip and starts hitting on Gonzos girlfriend Carmella.
There is a scene where Kermit and his nephew attempt to sing a touching, heart warming rendition of Jingle Bells, but (always to my delight as a kid) get cut off by The Electric Mayhem who crank up the volume for a wild version of jingle Bell Rock.
Anyway, too bad this thing is virtually unaquirable (seriously, I think you could find the video somewhere... try the used section at Blockbuster!) The DVD deletes some key scenes... like the snowman (""let me in! It's FREEZING out there!"") or the continuosly running icy patch gag. (???) they're in the video, not the DVD.

The Sesame Street gang show up, and it turns out there is a Fraggle hole in the house to allow the Fraggles to join the fun in the overcrowded farm house.  There are many classic moments in the video, from the meeting of Animal and Cookie Monster to Bert and Ernie making alphabet small talk with Doc, a rocking ""Jingle Bell Rock"" by the Electric Mayhem, and a tear jerking moment with the Swedish Chef who decides to make a vegetarian dinner (after a duet of sorts with Big Bird).  As has been pointed out in other reviews, there were some edits due to licensing problems that have purists hopping mad.  While a couple of comments are a bit odd given the cuts, the movie still hangs together as great fun.  The final vignette with Jim Henson (appearing as himself) together with Sprocket is enough to choke you up and make you raise your glass to the memory of the great man.",1193529600,,991,4.417582417582418

Unfortunately, our old VHS tape, complete with commercials is worn out and we wanted a DVD version.  I purchased this last year and was tremendously disappointed to see that some of our ABSOLUTE FAVORITE quirky moments of the show were completely cut out and were not even in the extra features.  My favorite joke, ""It's Reindeer""... ""No, it's snow, darling!"" was cut out as well as the muppet baby film and some other really fantastic jokes and ridiculous slips on the icy patch.

11581,3,0767815963,"Hey everyone - thanks for saving me from buying this DVD of my favorite Xmas show (admittedly, I've never seen the Jim Henson special). Anyway, I have a pretty good copy on VHS tape that I transfered to computer file. There's a tiny bit of tracking problem. Anyway, I also downloaded the DVD files on sale here. Obviously, the DVD version is MUCH higher quality than an old VHS tape. So what I did, is I took the DVD version and spliced in the missing scenes from my VHS copy - literally to the 1/100th of a second split. Unnoticable cuts except in terms of audio/video quality, which doesn't dip TOO much I must say. The result is a complete quasi-original version of this movie, 90% of which is DVD quality.

My question is, the only three scenes I edited back in from the VHS version are the snowman duet, the extended Muppet Babies home movie, and the Miss Piggy ice slip. I know these are the major ones. Are there any other smaller edits I should know about that I should correct? (I considered adding back in the 80's Transformer commercials, too, but decided against it!) Happy to provide my work to others. Not sure how though, it's a HUGE file.

The music reminds all of us what happy days we spent with family and friends at this wonderful time of year.  The muppets are still lovable and sweet. Miss Piggy and Kermit are still together.  Sprocket the dog is still jumping around making everyone happy.

The muppets put on their version of A Christmas Carol to the delight of everyone.  The humor has not changed and the story still brings to our hearts what this season is all about.

If you want the entire movie as is intact DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. A wonderful movie ruined i'm crushed.,1056844800,14,882,4.074712643678161
11615,5,0767815963,"I have always loved the muppets but had never had the pleasure of seeing this movie until I had a baby of my own. We were on vacation and wanted to rent something for my nine month old daughter. There was a very small selection at the movie store so when I rented this I had my doubts because she was so young. Boy was I wrong. She LOVED this movie as did the rest of us. This movie was perfect! It had just the right combination of muppet chaos, music and humor for people of all ages. When we returned home I bought the DVD for my daughter and she is thirteen months now and still loves it. We watch it all the time even though it is not christmas. She hasn't grown bored yet and, frankly, neither have I. This movie is a winner! The best muppet movie ever and that is saying something!",1042848000,2,788,4.0576923076923075
11616,3,0767815963,"I remember watching this special when it first aired on television back in 1987. What I remember most about it was that it brought together all of Jim Henson's Muppets (at the time); not only were Kermit and Company there, but the whole Sesame Street gang, and the Fraggles from Fraggle Rock. Fortunately, that togetherness remains intact. Unfortunately, about ten minutes worth of footage has been edited out and therefore makes this DVD inferior and uncomplete.
Besides the Muppet family all getting together, I fondly remember a comedy act Fozzy practices with a snowman and about a minute's worth of a Muppet Baby family video. Both of these have been edited out of this DVD. Also missing is a scene when Miss Piggy slips on some ice.
Nevertheless, the film is still enjoyable to watch. After all it is the Muppets and even when they are cheated from their just screen time, they make 40 minutes worth of viewing much more enjoyable than most of what can be found on television today.
I would give this DVD 5 stars, but because of the missing scenes, it's only getting 3.",1040947200,11,1075,4.693121693121693
11617,2,0767815963,"One has to wonder about the reasoning behind removing so much of this wonderful special's original material from this DVD release.  I have my original copy that I taped off of television way back in the mid 80's, and I'd rather watch THAT, fuzzy degrading, annoying Osh Kosh commercials, and all...at least it's INTACT.  Not only have several songs been removed, but the final pay-off to a VERY long running gag (the icy patch) ended up on the cutting room floor, as well, being that it was at the very end of Piggy's song (""Home for the Holidays"", cut out).  The editing is SO bad, you can actually TELL where things were removed.  Such a shame.  Here's hoping the matter can be settled, and a fully-restored version offered...though I wouldn't hold my breath.  After all, there are MANY more Muppet  television specials that have disappeared into the mists of time, as well.",1040083200,14,876,4.723684210526316

Among other edits they removed an entire musical number(Sleigh Ride) which also has needed elements to advance the plot (Fozzy and Snowman).  Nowhere on the DVD are we warned that pieces of the original program are missing. By saying it is digitally Mastered it is misleads one to assume they are using the original Master tape.  Not so.  We were so excited to see this available on a clean DVD, so it is with great emotion that we were disapointed upon viewing.",1039737600,3,585,4.542857142857143
11619,3,0767815963,"I am with the rest of the crowd on the editing. It seems to be that most of the editing was the removal of songs (I guess some publishing companies refused to let them use their songs anymore). The same happened in ""Emmet Otter's Jugband Christmas,"" another Henson production whose DVD differed from it's original version.
My hope is that some legal jerks got in the way and that it's not just Jim Henson Productions. I would HATE to see Jim's company do this to such classics all on their own.
The show itself is delightful (edits or not). The plot is funny, the way all the Muppets come together is ingenius, and I will NEVER forget the Swedish Chef attempting to cook Big Bird (that alone is enough to make me forget that the DVD was edited!).
If you've never seen this before, it's worth the buy. If you're a die-hard Muppet fan who knows the original version by heart, you may want to stray from this particular release, as it is not quite the complete version.",1039392000,8,966,4.432584269662922

Jim Henson, is someone that I held in high esteem, I can't believe his production company would do just a poor job of producing this DVD.

It's funny, sweet, and so entertaining.  But, unfortunetly, the version on this DVD is not the version I just praised.  There are massive edits that are very noticable to viewers who have watched it since it first aired on TV and may leave first time viewers confused.  Fozzie's duet with the Snowman is cut out, the Muppet Babies home video is cut out (leaving Doc with a very strange line that doesn't make sense) and in my opinion the best part, where Miss Piggy enters, sings her song and slips on the Icy Patch, is edited out.  The best Icy patch gag and it's left out of the DVD/VHS.

I am not going to buy this DVD.  Fortunately, my VHS tape still works well enough to watch it (yes with the OshGosh commercials and Double Mint Gum ones, too!).  Until they put the real complete version on the market, I will not spend my money on this DVD.",1038700800,664,1016,4.385026737967914

""It is true that the recorded release of ""A Muppet Family Christmas."" is shorter than the broadcast special.  The original agreement that was made for the music of this special was for broadcast television only. Subsequently, when we tried to arrange for the home video we were not allowed to release it unless certain selections were removed. This situation remains unchanged.""

11632,1,0767815963,"My sister and I have been watching this special together since I was in sixth grade. I am now 25. Two years ago I purchased the VHS version, as our old version taped from the TV has some serious sound problems to the point of being unwatchable. I was *sick* with disappointment when I found that some of my favorite scenes, including the charming ""Muppet Babies"" scene, had been cut out.
Yesterday my sister told my that ""A Muppet Family Christmas"" had been released on DVD. I was thrilled, and immediately rushed out, looking for reviews of it. Imagine my frustration when I found that the DVD contained the cut version as well!
I think this is ridiculous.... and so should you! I really, truly, fail to understand Columbia-Tristar's logic. The total scenes cut were only about 10 minutes, but when you consider that the original show was only 50 minutes, you realize that they have cut out *20%* of the movie! With DVDs that can easily hold over three hours of movie time and are cheaper to produce than their VHS counterparts, how does Columbia-Tristar justify cutting out ten minutes of this classic? I could see paying... for a remastered, uncut edition of ""AMFC""...heck, I'd be willing to pay a lot more than that. But until they release it in its intact form, Columbia-Tristar won't be seeing a dime of my money...and I would advise you not to waste yours on this disappointing (DVD).
P.S. Check out toughpigs.com/journalresist.htm for a detailed analysis on just how much of a (disappointment) this DVD release *really* is. And If anyone has a decent copy of the original 1987 version of ""AMFC"" on tape, I'd appreciate an email. :)",1006387200,8,1639,4.734265734265734
