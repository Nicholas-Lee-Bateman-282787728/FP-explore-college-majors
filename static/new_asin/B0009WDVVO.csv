2327198,2,B0009WDVVO,slave girls on auction block 1313  isvery poorly made and no real storyline  save your money and buy a better dvd,1357603200,,113,4.333333333333333
2327199,2,B0009WDVVO,"I bought a copy of this flik some years back - its' original production/release date was 2001. Always on the 'look-out' for some amusing 'sexploitation' product - I'll have to admit I got sucked in by the title and purported premise of: 'kidnapped strippers being auctioned off as white slaves'. While this 'shot direct to video' effort does sorta deliver what the box art implies - the amateurish quality of pretty much every aspect of it decidedly detracts from what potential enjoyment of the product one might hope for.

The 'tone' of the piece is broadly 'satirical' - presenting a Micky Spillaine-like private eye scenario wherein 'the dick' (get it?!) is approached by a woman looking for help in finding her missing cousin - a stripper named Bambi - who has disappeared. This, of course, presents the perfect 'excuse' for the 'dick' (played by Bob 'Gonzo') to visit the strip club and start questioning a variety of half nekkid girls to get information. Ultimately his sleuthing leads him to a local crime king-pin named Romeo who has been kidnapping girls and selling them as sex slaves to wealthy foreign clients, at a 'car auction' . The PI infiltrates the auction and manages to whisk the girls to safety at the last minute.

This flik totally looks and feels like a bunch of guys were sitting around in a strip club in Jersey one night and thought to themselves: ""Hey, I bet we could make some money if we could talk the girlz into taking their tops off and hang a little 'white slavery' plot around it. - we'll make it a 'comedy' so no one will take it seriously and all our ineptitude will seem like part of the joke."" It might almost have worked if it wasn't SO inept that itz painful. Pretty much the only redeeming value is in the T&A component and even that is of questionable quality. Some minor 'adult star power' is provided by the likes of Mia Copia (star of some Seduction Cinema vehicles) - she can barely keep a straight face while delivering her lines - but then, likely, it's not her 'face' that catches your attention. A fair amount of female nudity is on display throughout, but no 'sex scenes' - everything is 'played for laughs', but nothing is really very funny. There are some limp attempts at bondage scenes as the 'slave girls' are paraded about at the 'auction' where they are 'sold' and described as if they were 'cars' - ""check out the headlights on this one"" - Har Har.

If you could scoop this one up for $5 bucks in the used DVD bin you might think you'd gotten 'your moneys worth' for the bits of gratuitous skin it provides. There is a brief extras section that contains a couple of additional scenes of 'stripping' and 'showering'. This one makes even, fellow Jersey-ite Bill Zebub's low budget debacles look like Oscar fare. You've been warned!",1355184000,12,2790,4.620967741935484
2327200,1,B0009WDVVO,"I can only imagine that a thorough scouting of dog pounds was done prior to casting this movie. The feeble attempt at a plot was probably writen on a napkin during a coffee break. If you want good looking women look somewhere else, you want a story again look someplace else. If you have an urge to spend money, spend it on something else, anything else, even a 1 star rating is at best very generous.",1156032000,51,401,4.2894736842105265
2327201,1,B0009WDVVO,"Talk about a worthless waste of time.  The star, an overweight pin head who was accurate when he claimed he was a big dick.  Of course the description has nothing to do with his anatomy, unless it concerned his big belly.
Talk about no dilog, no acting, and a barely tollerable plot.  I could have made a better movie using a phone and note cards.
You would be doing yourself a favor by bypassing this movie a letting it slowly die the slow death it deserves",1378512000,,458,4.3023255813953485
2327202,3,B0009WDVVO,Too simplistic and dull. Not enough action and exitement.  Did not capture my attention.  not very good acting or drama.,1378339200,,120,4.95
2327203,3,B0009WDVVO,"If you want lost of breast, then this is a movie for you. But if you want story line, or some sort of plot. Look elsewhere.",1377388800,4,123,3.769230769230769
2327204,2,B0009WDVVO,"Tasteless b-movie just short of hardcore porn. All the movie was about was naked girls, and I've seen better girls at the local fitness club.",1377043200,3,141,4.68
2327205,1,B0009WDVVO,"This was probably more fun to make than to watch.  While Hollywood has warped our sense of human beauty, something this movie effectively reminds, there is no effort, even in a rough satire as this pretends to be, to act.  It is but one laugh above soft-core porn.",1377043200,,264,4.479166666666667
2327206,3,B0009WDVVO,"This movie has a bit of nudity and dark humor to it. However, if you can get over the horrible production film quality and you have nothing better to do this could help you kill a hour or two!",1376956800,,192,3.948717948717949
2327207,1,B0009WDVVO,"I should have turned it off after the first 10 seconds, but hoped it would get better. It did not. After 30 seconds, I shut it down.
 I've seen better acting in preschool plays.",1376956800,,177,4.205882352941177
2327208,1,B0009WDVVO,You need bread and wine to watch this movie.... Really cheesy. No offense to the actresses!!! Just a bad movie.,1376784000,,111,4.6
2327209,1,B0009WDVVO,This movie is horribly made with not enough of a story line or plot.just a bunch of makes women in the shower.,1376611200,,110,4.045454545454546
2327210,1,B0009WDVVO,ok b movie but even for a b movie i amde it through 10 minutes and gave up on it,1376611200,,80,3.05
2327221,3,B0009WDVVO,"Low budget work, but has a nice ""folksie"" way of addressing the viewer that makes it all entertaining. A fun time.",1376524800,,114,4.476190476190476
2327222,2,B0009WDVVO,One girl is cute and has lovely breasts but the dialogue is so idiodic it kills any potential eroticism.  Ok for free.,1376179200,,118,4.363636363636363
2327223,1,B0009WDVVO,it wasn't until I saw the content that I realized this wasn't the type movie I would want to watch.,1376179200,,99,4.0
2327224,3,B0009WDVVO,"What can you say about this movie.  The writing, acting, and production values are not quite up to Nail Gun Massacre standards but it is really bad none the less.  What I found the most amusing about this movie, other than the unabashed use of unattractive naked women, was seeing the one or two actors in this film that could act.
If you have two hours that you won't miss give it a watch.  Just remember you will never be able to get the two hours you spend watching this movie back.",1376179200,4,485,4.25
2327225,5,B0009WDVVO,"This is ironic being called gonzo as it doesn't show any porn. It's actually all lead in to a porn scene in every scene, with no pay off. Overall I gave it a five because for the lowest budget ever, there is some great vaudeville comedy, lots of boobies, and you could tell they tried with what they had. If you have amazon prime, watch it! If you pay for this you are spending more than they did on making it. Think 'taken' but 'dracula: dead and loving it' style with no budget. I had a ball. The end.",1375747200,2,503,4.090909090909091
2327226,5,B0009WDVVO,I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE PORNO SERIOUS BUT TURNED OUT TO BE A GOOD COMEDY - I HAD FUN WATCHING THIS,1375315200,,105,3.608695652173913
2327227,2,B0009WDVVO,Little to add it is Gonzo. A some what high school t&a movie. A laugh here and there but nothing that severe.,1375142400,,109,4.0
2327228,1,B0009WDVVO,"This is actually on Amazon? Most porn movies I've seen have better scripts and acting and everything! It goes to show that guys will look at boobs no matter what they look like. There are some beautiful bodies here, but there are some dogs as well. There is full frontal nudity well lots of nudity period.
I can't believe I watched the whole thing including the 'gag' clips in the credits. You mean the whole movie wasn't a gag clip?
Enticing title, but to watch this turn off the volume and play some music while scanning to the nude shots if you really have the need to watch nude women.
This is below amatuer level!",1374883200,3,618,4.3826086956521735
2327229,2,B0009WDVVO,"Wow, this film is amazing. It is said that pervasive video cams allow absolutely anyone to make movies, and I'm afraid that this movie is proof :) It's like a Troma movie, but with far less subtlety and attention to detail.

But it does have lots of mostly-naked women, and it does meet the ""so bad its funny"" bar, so worth watching for free on Prime if you like this kind of thing.",1374883200,5,382,4.232876712328767
2327230,1,B0009WDVVO,"I am impressed that something of such a low quality would make it on to amazon,this is truly one of the biggest pieces of crap ever. It reminds me of something that high school children might film.",1374796800,14,197,4.351351351351352
