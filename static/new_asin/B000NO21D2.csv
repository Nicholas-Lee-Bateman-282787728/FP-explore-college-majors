8214769,5,B000NO21D2,"I saw The Havana Night Club show when they performed at the Stardust in Las Vegas but I don't remember it being anything like this.  The Miami version was AMAZING, bigger and more spectacular than even Vegas could deliver... gave me goose bumps.  It is a beutiful and poetic show about the sounds and culture of Cuba.  If you love Latin music as much as I do, you will thoroughly enjoy this DVD.",1183680000,,395,4.383561643835616
