So I discovered this intriguing movie on Amazon Instand Video with no reviews, and associated with a number of other obscure movies, most of which had one-star ratings. A dicey proposition, but my intuition told me go for it, and I'm very glad I did.
Some warnings: are you looking for lavish special effects or the sort of escapism that they represent? Stay far away from this movie!
Are you made uncomfortable by graphic horror images? Stay away.
Do you feel that you have to stay away from stories that deal seriously (however imaginatively) with the issues of child abuse and particularly sexual abuse? Think very seriously before watching this movie.
With that in mind, I highly recommend this film. For me it was a cathartic experience, bringing to mind traumas I myself have experienced, and I am angry about the NC-17 rating. I could totally understand it if the movie ever depicted sexual abuse explicitly, but instead it uses the exact same sort of imagery seen in any frivolous R-rated horror film to make some powerful statements about a subject that is not frivolous at all.
The story itself is quite simple. Mary Ann is a young Englishwoman age 25 who is having traumatic nightmares. Upon returning home to visit her religiously fanatical mother, she experiences repressed memories of the repeated rapes she suffered at the hand of her father. As with many real-life instances of sexual abuse, the starting point was seemingly innocent and even beneficent play activity. Father would take little Mary Ann down to the basement, away from Mother's judgmental eyes, to read to her from the Alice in Wonderland books. And then eventually he would identify himself with the Red King. (I didn't remember this, but the movie points it out: The Red King was asleep and dreaming in Alice's Adventures Through the Looking Glass, and near the end of the book Alice wondered whether she had dreamed the Red King or the Red King dreamed her.) And then he dressed her up as Alice. And then things became far worse.
No, I don't think that the movie deserves an NC-17. But the images are very gruesome. This movie reinforces my belief (which I would go on and on about at endless length if I felt I could get away with it) that Dante Tomaselli is perhaps the seminal figure in modern independent horrorusing only practical effects, particularly the sort of effects that one would see in stage productions, the film comes out with a set of incredibly effective horror images: the little girl in the yellow Alice dress wearing a hideous Cheshire Cat mask; the Red King eviscerating Mary Ann with his bare hands; tears of blood; the mother at the top of the basement stairs, bloody steel chains bursting forth from her stomach to hold captive the girl in the Alice dress down below; the decaying face of the Rapist King; the self-pitying mother bleeding and crucified to a tree.
As with any Tomaselli film, the goal is not to transport you to another world but rather to imbue a domestic world with horrifying symbolism.
This movie will divide serious viewers into two camps. It is very legitimate, I think, for people to want to avoid this movie on the grounds that any sort of imaginative, fictive creativity amounts to a sort of escapist play, and such represents a trivialization when applied to issues such as rape, torture and sexual abuse. But paradoxically, I find it equally valid to note that ever since the Greeks told stories of their gods being devoured by their titan parents, such imaginative play has been an essential method of human cultures to deal with acts of unspeakable inhumanity.
My main hope is that this movie finds the serious audience it is worthy of.",1415145600,6,4038,4.842257597684515

8654843,2,B00K040WYK,Its a low budget study in Alice-in-Wonderland dream therapy. Its largely a confusing mess for most of the film. Too much symbolism and too many hidden meanings everywhere you turn in this rabbit hole. To many dreams within dreams. I was left with so many questions. The whole concept is a good one (an Alice In Wonderland based psychological horror) but I don't think the execution worked.,1428883200,,389,4.82089552238806

8654845,3,B00K040WYK,"Amazon Instant Video has this listed as having an NC-17 rating. Sexual themes and violence and nightmarish imagery might push this to an 'R' rating, but that's it. This is not an NC-17 movie and there is no nudity. But lack of exploitation aside, not bad.",1423267200,,255,4.565217391304348
8654846,3,B00K040WYK,"Okay, I'm not sure what just happened. A young woman goes home to her mother who lives in squalor in a creepy old house, except it's not creepy, unless it is. Her father busies himself in the basement toying with clocks, except for when he's molesting his daughter, except when he's not. There are some down-the-rabbit-hole references that don't make sense. And some black magic stuff. And I think there's an abortion or maybe the baby is shoved back in.

Bottom line is that this thing drags so badly in the first half several glaciers overtake it. Then things get weird, but not weird in a cool way or a fun way or in a way that doesn't make sense, but you stick with it anyway. Just weird.

Like I said, I'm not really sure what just happened.",1421712000,,746,4.398550724637682

8654848,4,B00K040WYK,"I think it's a pretty well done movie, too.  Yes, there are some parts that are stomach turning in nature, but NC-17?  No way.  My only real complaint is that it was short.  I feel like they could have more deeply explored more of the Alice in Wonderland aspect if it was more of a standard length film.  I read the synopsis, so I knew there would be some disturbing content.  No surprise.",1421107200,,389,4.260273972602739
