I think the teens enjoyed learning about their evangelism style the most and how God can use them to spread the gospel through how they are uniquely made. I think the only con that we have is that at times the video teaching really dragged on when what was taught could've taken much less time to make the same point. When working with teens that can be a big deal, so sometimes before youth group we would watch the video ahead of time and take notes on the important parts and just skip the video and go through the workbook with the teens. Still, I'd recommend the study!",1514419200,,630,4.302521008403361
