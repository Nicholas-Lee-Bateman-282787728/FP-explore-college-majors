7866241,3,6304271395,"This movie has nothing to do with ""Plan 9"" by Ed Wood.
The movie is a Science Fiction satire of Mormon theology.
If you don't know much about Mormon theology and the culture of the Mormon church, the movie is not going to make a whole lot of sense to you.
The movie is about how Brigham Young's 26th wife was actually an alien (Played by Karen Black) and how she takes her revenge on the inhabitants of Utah as told by a young woman writer. (As described in the ""Plaque of Nehor"".)
The movie is not perfect by any means, but has its moments of surreal charm.
Show this to your ex-Mormon friends.  They will get a kick out of it.",1038268800,12,628,4.147540983606557
