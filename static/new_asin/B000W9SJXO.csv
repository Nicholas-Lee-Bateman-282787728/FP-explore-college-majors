Mac Computer Basics
#2 in the 'Macs for the Computer Shy' series
DVD DESCRIPTION

Are you thinking of buying an Apple Macintosh computer but aren't sure how they work? Or do you have a computer shy"" friend who needs help with their new Mac?

People are switching to the Mac in record numbers. This is hardly surprising as Apple Macintosh computers are more secure than Windows computers; practically virus & spyware free; and come equipped with some fantastic software that makes Mac computers a much better value than Windows PCs.

Plus they look so cool sitting on your desk!

The good news is that Windows computers and Apple Macintosh computers operate pretty much the same way. If you're familiar with Windows computers then this DVD will show you how easy using your new Mac can be.

If you (or your ""computer shy"" family members) are brand new to computers then this DVD still has you covered!

In this instructional video, we cover basic Mac operations such as: starting and closing programs, transferring files between folders, and creating & saving documents.

Whether you're new to computers in general or an experienced Windows computer user, Mac Computer Basics will get you up to speed with your new Mac buddy in less than 2 hours!
