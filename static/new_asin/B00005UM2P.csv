7954676,3,B00005UM2P,very short vid for the price--!!  I don't get it---$35 bucks for 28 min??  Not enough songs and not enough piano playing.,1525478400,,121,4.454545454545454
7954677,5,B00005UM2P,"I bought it as a gift for my mom, and she said she loved it. It's short, and an actual performance rather than a movie or documentary, but she said it was well worth it anyway.",1492560000,,176,3.9166666666666665
7954678,4,B00005UM2P,But it is too short -- barely an hour running time.  Surely they can do better for a star of his magnitude.  Come on . . . he's one of the fathers of Rock 'n' Roll with a personality bigger than life itself.,1392336000,2,207,3.7906976744186047
7954679,4,B00005UM2P,"Suprisingly short performance, also short on piano playing, a big feature then and now at a LR show, this DVD remains very important to his resume and to the long-suffering fans [meaning that even in 2007, there are very few real representative artifacts floating around out which capture this amazing musical originator at his greatest. Though Music Scene and This Is Tom Jones! packages show this artist in command during that under-discussed period in his career].
This festival segment was filmed shortly after Richard followed Janis Joplin at the Atlantic City weekend festival. It's been written that he took the stage in the rain, and as many started the journey home, he quickly brought 'em right back and made 'em temporarily forget all that came before. His power and talent re-energized an event, just when the downbeat was expected.
Some of that high energy carried over to Toronto, though his explosive performance of ""Bony Moronie"" at the earlier setting was not duplicated on 09-13-69: ""Good Golly, Miss Molly"" and ""Hound Dog"", coming close, here and there.
The DVD opens with ""Blueberry Hill"", reported to have been actually done just prior to the finale, ""Long Tall Sally"".
A European Little Richard Fan Club wrote of sensational live readings of things like ""I Can't Stop Loving You"", ""Going To The River"", and ""Lawdy, Miss Clawdy"", from various venues at the time. So the songlist itself won't make the very serious historians' big toe ting-a-ling-a-ling.
It's also been written that LR later participated in a (filmed) 1970 Randall's Island Show (which included Jimi Hendrix). Maybe the 'rill' live in concert Richard will eventually be seen on that imagined DVD. In '72, another LR festival entry was filmed, now available on the London Rock And Roll Show DVD. In comparison to this '69 appearance, it's Richard in slow motion, exhausted after the first song. So this DVD takes on even more importance, in that light.
Great cover art.",1189209600,7,1955,5.037037037037037
7954680,4,B00005UM2P,"The film and sound is to 1960's quality...but this is the show that Richard has given for years.  If you have seen him anytime between 1965 and now, you will enjoy it....because you WILL relive that concert.  The classic standing on the piano and throwing his jewelry, shoes....even his toga....to the screaming audience is here.  His toga is covered with 1 inch square mirrors and makes Richard look like a moving disco ball!!  The toga must weigh 5 or 6 pounds ...and out it goes into the audience!! Then Little Richard continues with audience members dancing with him on stage as he drips with sweat, his torso glistening with sweat...  If you are a fan of the ""wild man of rock and roll""you will like it The length of the session is shorter than I expected  Good vintage shots of 1960's peace movement type audience.(The same company that produced this dvd, has a Chuck Berry dvd at the same Peace Concert...)",1012608000,31,913,4.6397515527950315
