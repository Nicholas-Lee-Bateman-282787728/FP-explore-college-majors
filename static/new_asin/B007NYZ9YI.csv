5101469,1,B007NYZ9YI,"I foolishly purchased DJANGO because I had been perusing the Blue Underground BluRay release of BULLET FOR THE GENERAL, and Amazon offered me a bundle that included these two titles and KEOMA/GRAND DUEL. Unfortunately for me, of the the three items, BULLET FOR THE GENERAL was the only Region Free title, the others being restricted to Region A, and because I am in the UK, I can't watch them on my BluRay player.
As a buyer, I should have been careful; I should have noticed Region Free did not apply to all titles. But then Amazon shouldn't have offered a bundle of mixed region titles; and Blue Underground ought to try and be a little consistent with Region codes in their releases.",1346371200,3,686,4.631147540983607

5101471,5,B007NYZ9YI,"Mill Creek is really doing some superb releases lately, add this Spaghetti Western dbl feature starring Lee Van Cleef (Grand Duel/aka The Big Showdown) and Franco Nero (Keoma).
The 2.35 anamorphic transfers are very clean, the sync of the sound is a tad off, but that is a minor quibble.
And its available at a nice afforable price tag.
The Big Showdown looks the better of the two films, but considering the tight budgets these had, they look DARN good!
The  theatrical trailers for each film are also included for good measure.
This is a great release for fans of the spaghetti western genere.
Very recommended!",1338940800,7,613,4.783018867924528
5101472,5,B007NYZ9YI,Bravo Mill Creek for giving us two beautiful prints that look great in HD. These are two huge highlights of the Spaghetti Western Genre. Here's hoping Mill Creek continues these Spaghetti Double features on Blu. Thanks Mill Creek!,1338249600,2,230,5.078947368421052
5101473,4,B007NYZ9YI,"The print used for the transfer is titled ""The Big Showdown"".  Like many spaghetti westerns The Grand Duel has many titles.  I think the first time I saw it on VHS it was called ""Storm Rider"".

This version is longer than the previously released Wild East DVD.  While I have not done a complete side by side comparison, I did notice a scene on the blu-ray that I have often seen in the trailer, but never in the actual film on DVD; the scene where the dying old man wipes his bloody hand on Adam Saxon.  I am sure there are many more.

The presentation on this blu-ray far exceeded my expectations.  Admittedly I was worried at first as the background for the blu-ray menu showed an intentionally scratchy washed out print.

The print is pristine and blemish free.  It looks to be pulled from the original negative and not a interpositive based version as there are subtle jumps occasionally in between cuts.  As an original negative is literally glued together between cuts, over time the print will reveal these ""bumps"".  Not a huge deal.

Color is solid throughout, and film grain is well defined without being distracting.  Details are are very sharp on the extreme close ups.

The audio is nothing spectacular, but is clear.  There are some serious sync issues.  For example in the scene where LVC spins around and says ""I never kill for money"", was out of sync, which was not a problem in the Wild East version.  These type of sync issues are probably in 50% of the movie, and seem to occur in large chunks of run time.  I know Spaghetti Westerns are known for their dubbing, but the English should match!  Bummer.

Aside from the audio sync issues, I feel it is a great disc.  I popped in the Wild East DVD afterwards and found it to be unwatchable (but I am a Blu-ray snob).

5101474,5,B007NYZ9YI,"Albeit these titles are rather obscure...buy hey, they are speghetti westerns!! The first volume put out on bluray were rather lacking in terms of story or even acting. This on the other hand contains LEE VAN CLEEF!! The picture quality is much better than the last, sound is spectacular, and LEE VAN CLEEF!!

If you do buy the set be sure to watch the trailors (the only thing that can be considered special features). Watching the trailors will show you the amount of work that went into cleaning up the film to make it a rather pleasant watching experience. These films are old and I am pretty sure they were never meant to astound the sensory organs throughout the annals of movie history, but they did a good job of making these two films look great!!

It's cheap so it's worth the gamble. If you love westerns with a non-glitzy hollywood flare, take the plunge and buy the set. They are worth it. If you haven't already, buy the previous set to make it a nice, cheap, packaged deal.

ENJOY",1337212800,8,995,4.516666666666667

5101476,4,B007NYZ9YI,"I'll be honest, I got this strictly for Lee Van Cleef; and as I expected, he turned in a great performance.  If Keoma was good then that would be a bonus.  It wasn't a bonus.

Keoma was pretty tedious, with a predictable story line, and poor Woody Strode being reduced to a drunk former slave with horrible lines to recite.  I'd rather watch his few minutes of silent presence in ""Once Upon A Time In The West"" than have to watch him cough up this horrendous script.  What makes this movie unwatchable is the HORRID singing. Yes, the wonderful Guido & Maurizio De Angelis provide the soundtrack, but the singers (male AND female) not only have to sing ridiculous lyrics, but their voices are like forks in the ears.

5101479,4,B007NYZ9YI,"The package is pretty bare-bones but you are getting two great movies. The Grand Duel is the highlight of the two. They seem to have cleaned up both movies and The Grand Duel is the better looking one. Keoma looks good, but not great. The sound quality isn't great on either but that is forgivable since its a Mill Creek disc and were lucky that they even put these movies out in such a good quality.

The Grand Duel is a great spaghetti western giving Lee Van Cleef the chance to play the good guy, which he excels at. It also feature a pretty good mystery as the background plot of the movie which is predictable but still very fun.

Keoma is a very different kind of western. The film is far more Italian, in that it stay on track with a narrative, but is consistently entering dreamlike sequences where you don't know what is actually happening. The imagery in the film is also clearly quasi religious for almost no real reason. It is a real fun film, where the only problem is that Franco Nero is supposed to be part native american and that is just truly hard to buy.",1442102400,6,1073,4.333333333333333

The Grand Duel - throughout the whole movie, it is very unclear what exactly is going on, and even after watching the whole thing, you're left to guess at what the details are behind the conflict.  I love Lee Van Cleef, so I enjoy seeing him in this role, but the movie really didn't deliver.  (And what's up with the sores on the weird brother's face???)

Keoma - After every scene, everything you just saw is recapped in the words of the song... which is an... odd style, to put it mildly.  I loved the character of Keoma, the actor was great and he was very likeable.  The movie had great potential, but was just too weird to really enjoy.",1426809600,3,694,4.259541984732825

I play these on my PS3 to my HD projector which displays an image 12 feet wide and they look great! Lee Van Cleef is my 2nd favorite only to Clint Eastwood in the spaghetti western film genre.

But the thing that stands out the most to me is how incredible both movies look on Blu Ray. I've seen movies made in the last 5 years that don't look this good and these are from the 70's. The digital transfer of these two films are some of the best I've ever seen. I hope all of Lee Van Cleef's westerns get transferred with this quality eventually.",1420243200,4,472,4.303370786516854
5101491,3,B007NYZ9YI,"The Grand Duel

Also known as ""The Big Showdown"" and ""Il grande duello"", this Spaghetti western was directed by Giancarlo Santi in 1972. The film has good, not very original, story that generally is entertaining. The overall mood of this movie is that of greedy, so you don't have bits of comedy here. The mystery about a killing gives an extra to this film. Overall, this is a descent movie worth watching Lee van Cliff riding again. I gave three stars to this film based on the great character played by Lee van Cliff + music score (uncredited Luis Bacalov) + a very good job made on the HD transfer.

Technically, the Blu-Ray transfer is excellent, first rate. The movie runs for 94 min. Audio comes in English with no subtitles. Extras include the trailer.

Shooting mistake note: look carefully behind the Saxon's brothers on the final duel scene.

Keoma

""Keoma"" (also known as Desperado) was directed by director Enzo Castellari in 1976, implying a late entry in to the Spaghetti western subgenre. A half breeding Keoma returns to his home town after the civil war to find an ex confederate gang owning and submitting the entire town by force. On top of that, Keoma is hated by his three half-brothers, who have been jealous of the love of his father. That sets the scene for movie that should be known as a spaghetti western drama. In fact, the movie is quite greedy with some elements of mysticism and over natural. An old lady keeps appearing to Keoma, with images of his immediate bad fate. In my view, the best of this movie has to do with these unusual elements, not typical of this western subgenre. Besides, you have some good amount of shootings with very acrobatic people falling dead. However, the movie is nonetheless not very good in terms of the acting. If you ask me, we should blame the E. Castellari on this. Franco Nero made a way better job in Sergio Corbucci's Django for instance. Overall, not a bad movie if you are looking for some drama variation to Spaghetti westerns. Overall, this movie remains inferior to The Grand Duel.

Technically, the Blu-Ray transfer is generally good, except on some overall landscape scenes that look really granny. The movie runs for about 101 min. Audio comes in English with no subtitles. Extras include the trailer.

A give a 3 star for the movies themselves, but it get 4 if you consider the really convenient price.",1417132800,4,2381,4.681818181818182

5101496,4,B007NYZ9YI,"The genre may have been winding down in 1972, but Giancarlo Santi's The Grand Duel aka The Big Showdown aka Hell's Fighters is a superior serving of spaghetti that's a lot of fun. Lee Van Cleef is on great form as the ex-marshal acting as unlikely protector for Alberto Dentice's escaped killer (""He doesn't look like a murderer."" ""The thing is, my dear, what matters is that he kills like one.""), determined to bring him back to the town whose corrupt patriarch he's been convicted of murdering despite the best efforts of a slew of scuzzy competing bounty hunters. Naturally Dentice (billed here as Peter O'Brien) is innocent, framed by the three corrupt Saxon brothers who run the town - fey white-clad and pockmarked Adam (Klaus Grunberg), angry sheriff Eli (Marc Mazza) and the smoothly ambitious new patriarch David (Horst Frank), who sees the town and Dentice's silver mine as the key to bigger things because ""In a violent country, he who seizes today controls tomorrow."" Only Eli seems bothered about finding out who really killed their father, but he's just as content as the others to get rid of both Dentice and Van Cleef, despite the latter being the only one who really knows who fired the fatal shot.

In his customary black attire, Van Cleef's bastard with a star on his chest is the kind of unflappable laidback anti-hero who just hangs his travelling bag on a bounty hunter's gun when facing him down. By contrast Dentice is the more athletic and occasionally intense of the two, who only have their apparent incorruptibility in common - one is too old to sell himself, the other is too young. It hits most of the genre staples, from cold blooded killings, the odd massacre of innocents, the amusing cat-and-mouse games between the two protagonists before they bond and a repeated flashback that gradually reveals more as the film progresses, but while it's nothing we haven't seen before, it's carried off with surprising wit and imagination, as well as a very strong visual sense that benefits greatly from Mill Creek's surprisingly excellent remastered 2.35:1 widescreen transfer of the English dubbed version on their Region A-locked Blu-ray double-bill with Keoma. It even includes the trailer, like the print of the film itself bearing the title The Big Showdown. Surprisingly enjoyable.

The spaghetti western was on its last legs when Enzo G. Castellari made Keoma aka The Violent Breed in 1976 (the film even suffered the ignominy of being the supporting feature to Young Lady Chatterley), but the film earns top marks for oddness even in a genre that took surreal turns. Famously written as they were going along, the plot is fairly standard, with Franco Nero's Indian, the sole survivor of a massacre who was raised by William Berger's rancher, returning to his hometown of Skiddoo City to find it suffering a plague caused by industrial pollution of the local wells and under the thumb of the local mine owner with the help of Keoma's three half-brothers who used to regularly beat him up as a boy because pa loved him more than them. His half-brothers may want to put a stop to his balderdash and shenanigans - and they really do say lines like ""We've got to put a stop to his shenanigans"" - but for much of the film Keoma seems more interested in looking for answers to life's questions and, possibly, some buttons for his constantly open shirt, while an old witch who looks like she's on her way to meet her two sisters and have a quick word with Macbeth occasionally wanders along to talk about destiny in deserted ghost towns as the wind blows doors back and forth atmospherically and the two find themselves watching the odd flashback. Naturally there's some killing of disposable henchmen along the way, including a neat `four cents' bit of business, before he finally takes back the town with the help of Woody Strode's drunken freed slave (who takes his bow and arrows from The Professionals out of mothballs for the occasion) - only for the locals to crucify him and let his half-brothers take over, leading to yet another showdown that's crosscut with a woman giving birth.

But the plot's not what gives the film it's notoriety in some circles, nor is the fact that it's possibly the greenest looking western ever made or even the look-alikes for Donald Sutherland and Ralph Fiennes in the supporting cast: it's the score - or more appropriately, since Guido and Maurizio De Angelis' music is pretty decent, the songs. Apparently Castellari and Nero wanted a Leonard Cohen-Bob Dylan sound along the lines of Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid. What they got were lyrics co-written by the hugely unpopular one-time failed British Tory Party leader and Prime Minister wannabe Ian Duncan Smith's sister and sung, often out of key, by a Joan Baez-alike and a gravel voiced Italian man who clearly had difficulty pronouncing some of the English words. But more than bad singing, it offers a demented chorus on what we're seeing or what is going to happen later in the film, reaching it's apex with the immortal ""Theyz mah favva/An my bruddas and me/Tell me now, far-tha/Why they hate me soooo/How I wound up/How I'm in dis mess."" And for much of the film it's laid on with a trowel in industrial strength quantities, making it a relief when the big battle at the end is played out completely without music.

Somehow, possibly because of the eccentricity, it just about hangs together, the demented score even growing on you if only to see how much more bizarre it can get. And, while it lacks the extras from Blue Underground's DVD release (only an international trailer is included on the Blu-ray), Mill Creek's Region A-locked disc offers an excellent 2.35:1 widescreen transfer of the English-language version that makes the most of the film's schizophrenic photography (superb in the night scenes, rather blander in many of the early daylight ones).",1374796800,7,5885,4.846918489065606

8519802,3,B007NYZ9YI,I thought Grand Duel was okay but I could not sit through Keoma.  Ironically Keoma had high user reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.  Maybe I gave up too quickly.  Here is 1 example.  The towns people who were afflicted with a plague which were banished to a small area.  Keoma thinks that is unfair and that they should be able to be back in town (and thus infect the others).  What?  How stupid is that.  Separating the sick ones is obviously the right choice.  Also as one man with one gun he faces many many men simultaneously.  I find story with space ships or people with super powers more believable.,1474243200,,599,4.412844036697248
8519803,5,B007NYZ9YI,"I was really impressed with the clarity of the picture on this disc, especially The Grand Duel.  I was also worried that it would not be enhanced for wide screen TVs because of the price, but not to worry, it is.  There is only one issue I have found, and that's that the dialogue is sometime out of sync a little, but this is common with Italian Westerns, since the sound was always dubbed in later, and a lot of times they were speaking another language to begin with so this doesn't bother me.  But to me it looks like they made this transfer from the original negative.  It's pristine!",1474156800,,589,4.327272727272727
