6461254,5,B00L1WJEQM,"Friends meeting at a camp in the woods for a get-together, having a great time until things go awry. I won't give it away, but the suspense takes over and is very intense. Great characters, nice scenery, some nudity. Bloody parts but not too bad as compared to some scary movies I've seen. I love movies that keep me on the edge of my seat and this was one of them.",1412121600,3,365,4.154929577464789

6461257,5,B00L1WJEQM,"I reviewed Jake's Road almost exactly a year ago, and I still stand by my opinion today. I rated the movie a 9 out of 10 and even included it as my #3 favorite movie of 2013. So glad it's finally getting a good release. It's a perfect, modern take on a slasher film with great acting and a nonclique storyline. It's worth the purchase because it'll be a movie you'll want to watch again in the future.",1410220800,4,401,4.153846153846154

6461302,5,B00L1WJEQM,"Slasher films tend to have two weaknesses:
a) The motives of the killer are usually highly improbable
b) it is hard to sympathize with the people being killed off
A slasher that includes those flaws is perfectly acceptable. But a slasher that avoids them quite as gracefully as does Jake's Road is a superlative achievement. I can off the top of my head only think of one slasher film I like better, the German film Slasher, which succeeds not despite the two weaknesses but because of them.",1417305600,3,491,4.655172413793103

6461304,1,B00L1WJEQM,"Horrendous.

Nothing worse than buying a movie on Amazon because of all the great reviews and 5 star ratings only to find out that said reviews MUST be from cast members and friends of the director/producer.  Terrible script followed by lousy overacting.  I'm sorry, but I couldn't make it fifteen minutes before I had to turn it off.  Save your money.",1416528000,2,352,4.721311475409836

6461306,3,B00L1WJEQM,It was not the best movie but not the worst . We spent a lot of time watching nothing . At the least it was not to long . I was somewhat disappointed we didn't see more of Eric Roberts .,1416355200,,186,3.5609756097560976

6461358,4,B00L1WJEQM,"I really liked it! It was a well done, solid indie film. A drama/acton/horror ... strong acting and THE TWIST ... didn't see it coming. Worth the watch.  Grab some popcorn and have fun.",1416009600,,185,4.4411764705882355
6461359,3,B00L1WJEQM,"Love Eric Roberts !
Actors over acting...WAY TO HAPPY !
To much corn syrup in the effect blood !
Audio quality and boom operation poorly executed !
Entertaining enough to be made for T.V.",1415836800,,187,4.529411764705882
6461360,4,B00L1WJEQM,"A good movie. Could have used more twists, better plot line, more development of the criminal character, but all in all, a good movie.",1415750400,,134,4.625
6461361,5,B00L1WJEQM,Love this movie.  Will not sleep too well after seeing this!  Suspenseful and frightening.  Definitely recommend this to viewers who love a good scare!,1414972800,,151,5.208333333333333
6461362,5,B00L1WJEQM,"Wow!  What an intense movie.  Down to earth...you feel comfortable with these characters, then wham...she fear sets in!!!  Praiseworthy for a terrifically suspenseful storyline!!  A++++",1414281600,,185,6.28
6461363,2,B00L1WJEQM,"Chris (Patrick Flanagan) wakes up bloody and injured in a hospital. The film is him recalling what happened , even the parts when he wasn't there. Sam (Garrett Hines) wants to marry Kay (Leticia Jimenez) and plans on proposing to her after she meets with his remote family and friends. During a camp fire, Sam announces that he and his brother Mike (Tim Bell) have decided to sell the camp. Keith (Eric Roberts) goes ballistic and soon there is a body count by an unseen assailant with all but two people accounted for.

About 20 minutes from the end, we find out who did it, but wait...it felt like they filmed two endings and not knowing which one to use they used both because the film was too short.

The film shows friends getting together, talking, drinking a beer, and not really doing much of anything...oh wait they cooked burgers and dogs. The first killing was unimpressive. It used a spring loaded retractable blade, that made a distinctive spring noise when it was being used. The gun shots looked like they were shooting red paint balls, no clean bullet hole entry just blood splatter. The script dialogue was bad, the actors had no chance.

6461364,5,B00L1WJEQM,I am not big into horror flicks but this was a pleasant surprise! I was recommended the film by friends and I am glad I listened.  It wasn't overly gory which I like and it definitely had good suspense and thrills in it.  Nice twist as well!  PS It is cheaper at Walmart if you can find it.  It was sold out at two stores in my area!!!,1413244800,3,335,3.8823529411764706
6461365,5,B00L1WJEQM,"Great show, good thing I'm not a nail biter 'cause there would not be enough left for fresh polish.  truly enjoyed it",1412294400,,117,4.318181818181818
6461366,5,B00L1WJEQM,"I really liked this movie.  It kind of reminded me of the movies I used to love watching back in the 70's...definitely creepy but not overtly slash/kill/blood.  Oh yes, this is a thriller to be sure, and there is mayhem and killing and blood, but the entire tone of the movie seems to be less focused on that than on the actual story...too many movies these last decades rely on gore alone...there is a definite who-done-it story here and I really appreciated that.  I never looked away, and right up until the disclosure I did, indeed, wonder who-dun-it!!!  I liked the length of the movie as well.  At one hour and twenty minutes it was just right. Too many ""horror' shows these days drone on and on and on and on and leave me fidgiting in my seat hoping the killer kills everyone, and then themselves so we can all get on with our lives.  Not so with Jake's Road...the story lasted the entire movie as did the suspense.  I heartily recommend this picture!!!",1412208000,6,960,4.482758620689655
6461367,5,B00L1WJEQM,Not sure if I can camp in the woods with my friends after watching. Great twist and turns during this cinematic ride. Eric Roberts nailed it.,1412121600,,141,4.461538461538462

8663218,4,B00L1WJEQM,Dark.  Eric Roberts doesn't play into it as much as you might think.  Tries to be a top notch Psychological Thriller but misses the mark while still being entertaining.  I'm guessing we are meant to figure it all out before the end.  Not bad but I watched and passed it on to someone else.  I like these unknown B movies usually and sometimes you catch a gem.  This is worth seeing once.,1451779200,,387,4.305555555555555
8663219,4,B00L1WJEQM,"Mike Mayhall presents us with a slightly elevated story that relies on a mature cast of ""30-something plus"" characters who really do give quality performances. The writing isn't the most developed material when it comes to actual dialog, but the overall story is a nice slice of heavy, dramatic, thrilling character study that mixes with a solid level of survival horror. I found ""Jake's Road"" to be very intense, and entertaining. A few moments in the film I jumped because of the intensity of the moment and the connection I had toward the characters.

The special effects are pretty tight through most of the film. There is some CGI shots that kind of lessen the effect of the scenes but no more than what we have to deal with in some of the horror television series and most horror films with a decent budget. You just kind of have to take CGI with a grain of salt now days. The good thing is that Mayhall and his team did choose to stick with mostly practical effects and blood for the majority of the film. The only real downer during the horror scenes was the refusal to get visceral and gory when it could have really amp'd up ""Jake's Road"" so much more. But still the overall choices made in this department work well.

Overall ""Jake's Road"" is a nice viewing experience with some really tense, thrilling moments that seem to start almost from the beginning. The film does have some very familiar themes and set-ups that aren't too original or creative, but the story and acting is good enough to really sell this nightmare situation to movie-goers. The energy does falter a bit at the big climax. Not because of the acting or anything, but the dialog seems to be a bit haphazard. Anyway the momentum slows down somewhat in the final scenes of the film, and once the truth of ""who's behind the killings"" is revealed, it does feel sort of cliche. Still ""Jake's Road"" is definitely worth checking out, and well over 90% of the movie is solid.",1442188800,,1949,4.565714285714286
8663220,4,B00L1WJEQM,"Definitely has a B-slasher movie kind of vibe. It wasn't what I expected, which is certainly not a bad thing. For another 'Uh oh, there's killer in the woods' type of movie, I thought the storyline was pretty creative and that the characters were engaging. The unexpected twists made it fun & thrilling to watch. I especially loved the outdoorsy, secluded setting & how it contributed to the movie's theme/atmosphere. Thumbs up!",1430092800,,428,4.958333333333333
8663221,4,B00L1WJEQM,"A cracker-jack indie horror film populated with complex, likable characters played by a very talented ensemble cast. The chemistry between the main cast makes the potential loss of each all the more devastating. These people feel like they've known and invested in each other for years. Kudos to Mayhall for casting the right folks for the respective roles and drawing out unusually strong performances for the genre. Richer and more enjoyable than 90% of the horror films you'll find in multiplexes today.",1428105600,,506,5.182926829268292
8663222,2,B00L1WJEQM,"I wouldn't recommend one bit!! Everything from acting, to plot, to.....well everything sucked.",1426291200,,94,6.3076923076923075
8663223,2,B00L1WJEQM,This is definately a B movie.  I would wait for it to come on TV.,1420848000,,65,3.3333333333333335
8663224,1,B00L1WJEQM,"Rented this because of the 4 star rating.  I nothing I saw justified over a 2. Bad acting and ridiculous, predictive plot.",1420416000,,122,4.545454545454546
8663225,4,B00L1WJEQM,This was a solid independent film.  I don't get the negative reviews - some people like to hate on things.  It had likable characters that I really felt for.  Great story.  Nice twist. Worth the watch.,1418256000,,201,4.5
8663226,4,B00L1WJEQM,Ending felt unfinished....maybe there should be a sequel.,1418083200,,57,6.25
