8258984,5,B0015LPS14,"What a wonderful discovery! Found 3 episodes of this on a streaming video service one night when the hour was late and the grandkids tired, but not yet asleep. Our 4 yr old girl fell asleep during the first 10 minutes. However, somewhat to our surprise,  our 6 year old boy loved it! The first hook was the ""Mustard Pancakes"" title, which caught his humorous interest.  As it is with the best programming for children, it appeals to both adults and kids. Smart, engaging, gently amusing, welcoming and perfectly charming.

In the episode 'Red Raincoat' that we watched, Courtney is making pizza with the puppets. Each picks a favorite topping.  During the chit chat, we learn how Mo the dog was adopted. Gently, and conversationally, Courtney and the other puppets reassure Mo how much she is loved and how important she is. The lesson for this episode is on working together and respecting individual tastes.

Each puppet has his/her own strengths and foibles and is loved and accepted.

While the pizza baked, Courtney told the story of (and the puppets acted) ""the mystery of the missing pineapple."" The story has a low-key musical background that mimics the action. This was followed by a catchy song played and sung by Courtney about a red raincoat that loves it when it rains; the eating of the pizza; and a spin of the globe with a brief reminiscence by Courtney of some time spent at an olive farm in Italy. Lastly, Oogleberry Ink Dog writes in his journal before bed and reviews what he learned that day.

I thought that, perhaps, our boy had watched it only because he was so tired. However, today he spent a day home from school with me and opted to watch it again while eating a snack. And he...well, we...sang ""Mustard Pancakes"" all day while we played other games. :-)

I'm buying the few DVDs that are available on Amazon. I only wish that there were another 50 episodes.",1335139200,,1886,4.659638554216867
