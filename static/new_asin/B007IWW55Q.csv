Kim Shaw is the standout of the show, she gets the one liners and delivers everytime. the basic premise is young adults trying to make it out in the real world(pun intended). every episode was hilarious.whats great about the show is that it doesnt go over the top. keeps it real while still being funny.im gonna miss jason,tina,stacey,eric,bobby,and jb(played by chris parnell)Come on Mtv. how about canceling one of the many jersey shore spinoffs or teen mom and keep an actual entertaining series. a definite 5 star series.",1338336000,7,772,4.900763358778626
8518084,1,B007IWW55Q,"On the back cover, the small print says the discs are expected to be used in ""play only"" devices and may not play in other DVD devices, including recorders. This is true - the discs would not play on my DVD player/recorder. I haven't encountered this problem before - seems odd to produce discs that won't play in recorders. Others buyers beware.",1492473600,,346,4.596774193548387
8518085,5,B007IWW55Q,"I had almost forgotten how much I enjoyed this show.  I was reticent to purchase DVD-Rs, but, other than a couple navigation quibbles, the quality is as good as any standard TV DVDs I own.  If you fondly remember this show, do not hesitate due to quality.",1431388800,,255,4.404255319148936
8518086,5,B007IWW55Q,"Fantastic series -- and shamefully, when MTV does it right, it ruins it big time as well.

Smart, light, but incredibly engaging, the characters, ambiance (okay, maybe not so much, but whatever, i never liked NYC), and even the dialogues are spot on -- just perfectly right.

I fantasize of one day, a reboot of this series arising... Likewise with Happy Endings.",1429660800,,363,4.838709677419355
8518087,5,B007IWW55Q,"Absolutely delightful series from MTV about a group of young people just starting out in New York City.  Peter Vack is not only beautiful, but a joy to watch in his acting and subtle, humorous, self-deprecating character.  I had seen him in the Amazon production of Mozart in the Jungle and I found this series -- his first, I believe -- as a result.

Reminiscent of MTV's great series, Undressed, but even more fun.",1427587200,,416,4.594594594594595
8518088,5,B007IWW55Q,"I love this show. MTV finally did it right and then canceled it after 1 season. I really recommend this show, just don't get to attached.",1427414400,,137,4.3076923076923075
8518089,5,B007IWW55Q,The characters are so beautiful and amazing. Their personalities are what makes this show addictive to watch. It doesn't have a strong plot but MTV finally didn't do a show about teenagers who are still unable to actually drink and party and whatnot and made the show about legal out of college friends that are learning what its like to be in the real world and do things themselves.,1416441600,,384,4.579710144927536
8518090,5,B007IWW55Q,"Great underrated show that was cancelled far too soon. Likable, characters you can relate to. Definitely something I would re-watch and try to get other people to watch too.",1410739200,,173,5.0
8518091,5,B007IWW55Q,"Look, it isn't actually a five star show.  But it was a REALLY really good one anyway, full of actors too early in their careers to hide behind a lot of lazy actor tricks but who were strong and skilled, too.  It was a show that was what so many shows have since tried to be, and I just don't get why a network wouldn't indulge it at least one more season to see what happened.  I suspect maybe because it was too smart and maybe aimed a little older than the children Mtv court these days.  I know Mtv always wanted kids as viewers, but Mtv at some point turned into a witch from a fairytale that tries to keep the children from ever growing up, haha.

One observation.  these kids have a hell of a lot more sex than I suspect any normal people have.  I don't mean that as in I'm just ugly and unlucky, I'm not.  I mean like I would worry about these people if I were friends with them.  In real life they'd be like crying for help with the number of partners they kept.  I think the show maybe was written by the less lucky of us and perhaps over estimated what constitutes an active sexual lifestyle?  I don't know.

Watch this!  I would rate this with my favorite shows even today, and it has been a few years since I saw this.",1378425600,,1231,4.079166666666667
