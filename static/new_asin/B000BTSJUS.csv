2441285,4,B000BTSJUS,"Maintenance Yoga for Weight Loss is a workout for the evening. There is also a bonus workout and the two sections work well together for a full-body stretch routine. Suzanne Deason's calming voice and nurturing teaching style makes this perfect for stress reduction. The beautiful beach setting adds to the experience and the emphasis on form makes you feel centered and balanced.

During the first workout you will release tension in your shoulders and lower body. A yoga strap (or you can use a belt) is used to deepen the stretches. I found the use of an additional ""yoga wedge"" was not essential so all you really need is a yoga mat, belt and a pillow. While this routine ends with a final relaxation pose, you might want to skip that section and start the bonus routine.

While you may feel completely relaxed after the first workout, the second bonus segment focuses more on breathwork. This short exercise routine has a meditative quality to calm the mind and body. You will recognize forward bends, bridge pose and warrior 1. Throughout the session you use breath to deepen each pose. The setting is very relaxing with a big open field near a forest in the mountains.

Once you have finished both workouts you may feel a sense of clarity descending over your entire body. The exercises are designed to relax the body and are easy enough for beginners.

Will this really help you lose weight? It may take a lifestyle change that includes walking and yoga to help you reach your weight loss goals. Recently I've found yoga to be an essential part of weight loss because it keeps me centered and focused. If you try to practice yoga on a daily basis I think you will be very happy with the results.

2441286,4,B000BTSJUS,"Yes, it is a bit tricky of Gaiam to repackage this under a different name. They do state it on the back cover, but in little tiny text and it's not mentioned on Amazon except by the reviewers. I also think it's misleading because it's not going to help you a whole lot with weight loss. A better name would have been ""PM Yoga for stress relief"". Yes, reducing stress will help in your weight loss program ;o) Also, the breathwork segment listed on the back cover is just another yoga routine.

....Other than that, I think this is a great practice and a good price. It's beautifully produced and a very nice pace. It's not a difficult practice, but will help to make you feel stretched and relaxed. It is good for beginners and I think intermediates on lite days. You get three yoga routines that can either be done separate or together. There's a 25- and 20-minute video routines on DVD and a 15-minute audio routine on CD.

I'm going to try the AM workout now called ""50 Minute Quick Start Yoga for Weight Loss"", since I don't have the older PM workout. I guess Gaiam got me on this one!

Please see my other reviews for yoga and mediation DVDs on Amazon.",1170460800,15,1157,4.372093023255814
2441287,5,B000BTSJUS,"Years ago I owned the vhs copies of AM/PM yoga for weight loss and they had become lost during a move.  I was thrilled to see these repackaged as new dvds.  Yes, they are repackaged but it clearly states that on the back cover.

That said, these are excellent programs for adding to your yoga practice.  Suzanne is a wonderful instructor as always, and she guides you toward making lifelong changes and learning to respect your body and its needs, thus learning to control appetite, exercise more, etc.  The audio cd is a nice bonus that was not available in the past.",1144972800,5,568,4.529411764705882
2441288,4,B000BTSJUS,"I absolutely agree that Living Arts shouldn't have repackaged this, as it contains the the PM part of AM & PM Yoga Conditioning For Weight Loss.

My review will be of the actual workouts themselves.  Maintenance Yoga For Weight Loss contains 1 DVD and 1 CD.  The DVD has 2 workouts--the PM part of AM & PM Conditioning For Weight Loss with Suzanne Deason and the 20-minute bonus Breathwork through Yoga workout that's also the AM & PM Yoga Conditioning For Weight Loss DVD (but not on VHS).  Maintenance Yoga for Weight Loss is 25 minutes long.  Suzanne Deason is by herself on a Hawaii beachside setting.  The scenery is beautiful, Suzanne is pleasant/calm and the music is soothing.  It's very basic, gentle Yoga poses and Suzanne uses a yoga strap and wedge for some poses.  (I don't have a wedge and had no problems doing the practice without it).  The bonus Breathwork through Yoga workout is filmed outside with Suzanne alone in the meadows.  Snow-capped mountains are seen in the background.  Suzanne starts off with breath work and moves into a yoga practice that's more active than the one in Maintenance Yoga For Weight Loss.  Very nice!  The CD is a 15-minute motivational audio program with Suzanne Deason.

All in all (with the exception that it IS a repackaged/retitled yoga program from Living Arts), it is a very nice Yoga DVD and I enjoy it very much!",1139443200,9,1368,4.69327731092437
2441289,1,B000BTSJUS,"CAUTION: this is the P.M.-part of the ""A.M. & P.M. Yoga - Conditioning For Weight Loss"" DVD with Suzanne Deason, just with a different name :-(",1133740800,58,143,4.538461538461538
8092611,5,B000BTSJUS,This is a really nice DVD for when youd like to do some yoga but don't have 45 minutes in which to do it.  I had back surgery and was told at six weeks I could start doing yoga.  I purchased Suzanne Deasons Yoga For Weight Loss.  The routine is 45 minutes long.  The transition from one pose to another is smooth and gradual.  Each pose is held for 45 seconds which allows you to really feel the benefit of the stretch.  Hands down the very best yoga DVD Ive ever tried and it will always be a part of my life.  The maintenance DVD is nice when you prefer a 25 minute session.,1516838400,,576,4.0

8092620,5,B000BTSJUS,"I bought this at Olympia Sports for 1.96, and at that price I was not really expecting much. Well, I definitely feel I got more than my money's worth! Suzanne Deason is a great instructor. With some DVDs, I find myself distracted by the instructor's voice or appearance, but Suzanne is just perfect. The scenery is gorgeous, as well. Will this DVD make me lose 15 pounds? No, but it certainly helped me to relax so I can sleep better and wake up tomorrow with plenty of energy for running!

edit (2/12/11): i lost 15 pounds, was it because of this DVD? MAYBE!",1273881600,,559,4.427184466019417
