8425185,5,B004DE8DHG,"Karyn Henley has done it again.  My granddaughter loves these Christian tapes.
My grandson who is now eighteen watched ""Five Little Ladybugs"" continuously when he was a toddler. These tapes appeal to little ones.",1427587200,,212,5.235294117647059

8425189,5,B004DE8DHG,"We've had ""Feel Like A Giggle"" for a year and the kids l-o-v-e it!  Karen engages them and keeps them transfixed and singing along on 'Noah's,"" too.  This DVD is more overtly Sunday schoolish and doesn't intersperse the overtly Christian themes as sparsely as does ""Giggle.""  We love having new songs to learn and dance to and will likely be getting her ""Ladybug"" DVD soon!  Highly recommended.",1356739200,,394,4.835820895522388
