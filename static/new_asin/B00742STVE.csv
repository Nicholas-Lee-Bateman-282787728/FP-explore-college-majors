It turned out to be something totally different from my own perceptions I had on the film, my own fantasy about Girl being Brave set in a Celtic(Druid) world....

and and...Ok It's good movie, it's a good movie from the family and for the mother and daughter.  It's very closed and the script is again like all Pixar films unintelligent.

There is even a scene in the film that is exactly like another scene in another film staring a Dog by another animation company, with the same strum style guitar and song!  How in the@#$#@@!

This is Pixar a company that worships Miyazaki the Legend!  And yet there films lack everything that
Miyazaki is famous for.  Pixar you need to Grow Up!

What could have been?  Brave a film about girl that rebels against her Royal duties and get's lost in the woods only to unleash the old God's, the Old world of the forest.

No it's Brave, a silly comical story about girl who resorts to the extreme, but by doing so becomes closer to her mother.

For what it is its' a fun film.",1438473600,2,1108,4.278846153846154
