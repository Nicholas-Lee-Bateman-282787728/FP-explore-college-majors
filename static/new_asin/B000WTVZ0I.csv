8225459,1,B000WTVZ0I,"I was deeply disappointed in this entire DVD. There was not any information in there that I haven't heard before. When the doctors were talking to obese patients there were no follow up's to show the program worked. I love Rodney Yee, I think he's wonderful. Until this DVD. His workout was done mainly on a folding chair. I travel for a living and the hotel rooms don't have chairs that would work with this. I'd rather see standing yoga and/or possible floor yoga.",1454112000,,466,4.559523809523809

8225462,5,B000WTVZ0I,"There are so many weight loss methods available in the market. Inspite of them I always believed there is no substitute for a balanced diet. I did not know properly about portion size, food pyramid, how to shop healthy and so many different things. But this particular DVD is so simple to understand and follow I felt as if I found the magic wand to loose weight. I honestly believe there is no shortcut to weight loss and maintaining healthy weight. This DVD taught me to imbibe healthy lifestyle as a part of my everyday life. I lost weight couple of times and gained back but this time I am confident I will be able to maintain and retain my healthy weight throughout my life.",1243296000,20,679,4.44
8225463,5,B000WTVZ0I,"As purchaser of DVDs for a public library, I look for quality. The Mayo Clinic name means this wellness series will provide good information for our patrons.",1215648000,10,157,4.851851851851852
