2400168,5,B000B5IONO,"Ok, this is the story of a girl joins a circus and does a bunch of acrobatic stunts. Sounds boring right? Well it's not. I've watched many anime series lately with more interesting premises, and none of them were anywhere near as good as kaleido star. The makers of this show have somehow found a way to turn an ordinary premise into a beautiful, interesting, exciting adventure that starts out great and only gets better with every episode. KS is funny, cute, and and fully enjoyable. I strongly recommend this DVD set for anyone who loves to smile and laugh.

My only warning is that the box and DVD cases in this particular set are a bit flimsy, and the extras are lacking. If you really want those things then buy the individual DVD's. If you just want the show at a great price, then get this set as it's an excellent deal.",1158969600,13,828,4.411764705882353
2400169,5,B000B5IONO,"This anime is cute and exciting.  The animations of the fabulous aerial maneuvers of the circus performers are breathtaking.  The characters are well developed and distinct.  The story is a scrumptious mixture of comedy and drama, with neither overwhelming the other.",1156118400,2,267,5.463414634146342
2400170,5,B000B5IONO,"I loved this box set! It was very entertaining, and the art is well done. Though I prefer the Japanese subtitles. The English is a little frightening.",1151971200,2,150,4.592592592592593
2400171,5,B000B5IONO,"Kaleido Star is a nice story for old and young viewers, beautifully animated. It is funny, dramatic and suspense-packed.

What I liked most is that you really become fond of the characters, even if some of them start as ""bad guys"" and change from antagonists to friends (or even vice versa!) in later episodes.

The ""Amazing Collection"" packs lots of fun into a sturdy and neat looking cardboard box, for a very reasonable price. The only drawback is the missing cover of the original DVD#3, since they rearranged the episodes into 5 DVDs, contrary to the original 6 DVDs of the ""thick box"" version. But that will not stop my enthusiasm.",1144281600,4,637,4.72972972972973
2400172,5,B000B5IONO,"After making the order for Kaleido Star: Amazing Collection, I expected kind of a bigger box than what I received: this box set is fair small, so I can save it easily as if it were a book. It is worthy to mention that the box is simple but fair, besides the fact that what matters is the content, so this box set is worth the price, as it carries all 26 episodes of Kaleido Star first season: it makes this product just excellent and affordable.

If we talk about the Kaleido Star series itself, then I can summarize it in a phrase: ""All the world is a stage!"". This is proven as the story shows how the main character, Japanese 16-year-old girl Sora Naegino passes through many challenges in order to become a Kaleido Star (in other words, the star of Kaleido Stage, just in case it is not so explicit). Not only does Sora face problems within the Kaleido Stage environment itself; she also experiences struggles with her family (her ""parents"" were opposed to the idea of becoming a Kaleido Star) and her own life out the stage (when she needs to find apartment, as Yuri Killian owned Kaleido Stage as signal of revenge). But the way Sora faces these problems is admirable: she always does her best in everything, pushing herself so hard that she gets hurt in most cases, physically and psychologically, and taking all the chances she can in order to make successful progress. This way, anybody realizes that Sora Naegino is definitely the heart of the Kaleido Star story, as it is her challenge to become a Kaleido Star. Excellent animation quality and customes, in addition to a very strong phylosophical background makes Kaleido Star: Amazing Collection a must have...

...therefore, you must have this one no matter what!",1139875200,10,1726,4.655737704918033
2400173,4,B000B5IONO,"Kaleido Star: Amazing Collection is a good buy. To first talk about the quality of the DVDs and case, they are excellent and well worth it. Save some money.

The anime itself is beautiful. I personally am not a fan of ""fluffy"" anime but Kaleido Star completely surprised me and out of the hundreds of anime I have seen, this is on my top ten. Something about the integrity of the characters in the show struck me, especially given the place this story takes place- the episodes, morals, and characters shine. The main character, Sora, is a bright, strong, brilliant young woman who shows that your will and ""heart"" can get you through anything. I believe she is a positive and ""fun"" character, who will surprise her with the realism in which she is presented in a (what could have been) very boring and stupid anime series.

The animation alone is worthwhile, the settings on Kaleido stage are simply mind blowing and neat. The idea of this anime is, in one word, neat. I have never seen anything like it before. Picture a circus, with all the costumes and bright lights and now mix it with an opera and theater- that is Kaleido Star.

You will be feeling for Sora even in the first episode, and new characters come up that become equally lovable. I enjoyed this anime and am completely satisfied with it, I believe you will be surprised with the show. It is also suitable for younger children (7 and older), since there is no actual ""blood and guts"" violence in this anime series, or swear words of any worthy note: but it does present more dramatic action and issues that a young child would find boring or probably not even pick up at all. Perhaps for a child who can sit still, this would be a good idea.

2400174,5,B000B5IONO,"Though I've previously dubbed Fumoffu this honor, after revisiting Kaleido Star I have to declare resolutely that Kaleido Star is the DVD title that moves me the most. From the first episode to the last, the title beckons my attention every moment, giving me the most rewarding viewing experience I've ever known thus far, and dare I say may ever come to know.

My highest praise goes to the wonderfully talented production staff. Junichi Sato is a great anime visionary having given us classics like Sailor Moon, Magic User's Club, Sargeant Frog, and Princess Tutu. And Kaleido Star in my view is his crowning achievement. I would never have imagined that a cirque du soleil backdrop would be so fascinating, but Sato's unique take on a shounen formula following the plight and destiny of a lovable goofy heroine brings much life and adventure to a dubious and risky plot. Mina Kubota's gorgeous romantic soundtrack that seems to borrow from Tchaikovsky, Borodin, and Prokofiev is among the most engaging collection of music I've heard for the genre. And Gonzo's solid animation and attractive character designs make it all the visual splendor that it is.

And the Japanese cast assembles some of my favorites, Aya Hisakawa, Takehito Koyasu, and Fumiko Orikasa. And of course, the brightly shining Ryou Hirohashi infuses the right kind of depth and emotion into the Kaleido Star that I could not conceive being done better by anyone else.

If I may capitulate an overview, we begin with a bright, ambitious, and head strong Japanese girl Sora coming to the US, arriving at a fictitious Los Angeles county town named Cape Merry to audition for and join the circus troupe of Kaleido Stage. With circumstances leading to her unpunctual arrival, the current diva overseeing the audition dismisses her. Believing she's lost the one opportunity, she's somehow managed to maneuver a stage debut...by causing minor injury to a trampoline performer in a hilarious attempt to save her from a falling object. LOL! Having had a previous encounter with the circus owner, he assigns Sora to substitute. As we move forward, Sora faces and overcomes challenge after challenge, making friends of other talented troupe members, touching the hearts of broken people, making others around her shine, forging a partnership that culminates in an intense competion to determine who shines brightest as the True Kaleido Star. And when two bright stars collide, it is most certain that one is destined to fade under the brightness of the other. The acrobatics and high-flying action are fantastic and marvelously done, drawing out a similar type of viewer excitement expected of high-quality fighting anime, only without the violence. With a powerful orchestral score filled with strong themes and harmonic movements, and fine acting on the part of the Japanese cast, watching Kaleido Star is a thoroughly engaging experience that mixes a proper balance between style and substance.

There are some areas in which the title falls short, and I found these mostly to be mere animation inconsistencies in the characters' attire. Sora and Mia at different episodes perform some acrobatics, beginning them with shoes and ending them w/out. A variety in costumes would also have been welcome. But these are minor quibbles in light of Sora's character development and the depiction of her challenges and how she overcomes them. Where Naruto, DBZ, and countless other shounen titles have failed to even mildly amuse me, Kaleido Star moves the core of my being and satisfies me like no other. I highly recommend this title for those interested in a tried and true formula with a twist. And this thin-pack set is a precious steal.",1131494400,55,3696,5.074013157894737
8081521,5,B000B5IONO,"One of the best comedy/drama anime I ever saw...

I like how the story line evolve and special I love the characters, the music, the climax, the art, is just a must watch, at least once for all those anime fans of this kind of shows...

The only thing I don't like is the DVD menu, is kind of something I can make and don't look so professional...

This is the first part, you will need to get the 2nd part in another box set to see the complete series.

Also I love the art in the box...",1399420800,,488,3.9489795918367347
8081522,5,B000B5IONO,"This review will focus on the DVD packaging and releases, not so much on the actual anime. Other reviewers have already talked about Kaleido Star as an anime at length, so to save on space I won't be talking about that here.

- BACKSTORY -

I originally bought this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kaleido-Star-Amazing-Collection/dp/B000B5IONO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kaleido Star - Amazing Collection</a>&nbsp;a few years back thinking I had a complete collection of the anime when I in fact only had the first season (making that 26th episode ending a real ""WTF?!"" moment). That mistake sent me all over the internet looking for answers. What I found out I've collected here to hopefully save at least one person out there the headache I had tracking down specific info. Or maybe I'm the only one who found this confusing, I don't know. Either way I hope this is informative to someone.

- ABOUT THE OVAS AND EXTRAS -

This Amazing Collection contains all 26 episodes of the first season of the Kaleido Star series. Please note that this is ONLY THE FIRST SEASON. If you're looking for a complete collection or other options, I've listed them at the bottom of this review.

The only real reason you'd buy the Amazing Collection is because you've somehow already bought the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kaleido-Star-New-Wings-True-Star-Collection/dp/B000T4T8ZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kaleido Star: New Wings True Star Collection</a>&nbsp;and want it to match on your shelf. You get all 51 episodes of the anime this way + the first OVA, ""The Amazing Princess Without a Smile"". Problem is, there are two OVAs for this anime, and buying these two box sets means you don't get the Layla-centric OVA, ""Legend of Phoenix ~Layla Hamilton Monogatari~"". You also don't get any of the extras included in the individual DVD releases - like interviews with Director Junichi Sato, commentaries with Mike MacRae (Leon) and Illich Guardiola (Yuri), etc. If you want all 51 episodes + both OVAs, you'll want to look into the Funimation releases I've linked at the bottom.

- AMAZING COLLECTION PACKAGING -

The season is collected on 5 DVDs individually packaged in thin plastic cases (I believe they're called Thinpaks?). Kinda flimsy, but it looks really good. The box itself has a nice almost matte feel and is made of fairly sturdy cardboard. If you've ever bought a DVD set by ADV Films, you'll know what I mean.

- OTHER NOTES -

A couple of my anime box sets (like this one) come from ADV Films - a now defunct company who's anime assets were taken up by Funimation. In August, Funimation will be releasing the first season in their popular S.A.V.E. format with season 2 coming in October. I've never bought a S.A.V.E. edition of anything, so I can't talk about the packaging for those, but it seems like they're bare bones when it comes to content (i.e. little to no extras). For some people that's fine, but there are those out there that want all the extras and as far as I can tell you only get that with the individual ADV Films DVD releases.

Below I'll list the options you have for owning the Kaleido Star Anime:

8081523,5,B000B5IONO,"Very entertaining and uplifting story of a young girl's effort to become a star in an acrobatic performance group.  The animation is beautiful, the voice-acting superb, the story well-written and inspirational.  Highly recommennded for everyone, but especially for families with girls ten and older.  I suggest you get the two season box set, or the first season's package and then the second season set, since they follow in a logical sequence (and you'll want to view all 52 episodes, they're that good).",1233360000,,506,5.146341463414634
8081524,2,B000B5IONO,"I love anime, and I am an avid collector of great anime dvd's, so when I read the 5-star reviews about Kaleido Star, I just had to get it. Needless to say, I was greatly disappointed. First off, I will say that Sora, Mia, Anna, Ken, Sarah and the others are superbly drawn-- animation is great. The plot too is well developed and unique. So why only 2 stars? Well, although the music soundtrack received excellent reviews by several others, it totally drowns out the voices of all the characters, especially at the most heart-felt, tender moments. The music pounds away louder and louder and louder while Sora and the others can barely be heard at all. Turn the volume up, and you still can't hear the characters speak. The only thing you achieve is to get broken ear drums. This is the worst video as far as musical-sound balance goes, and it is very annoying and disappointing. Also, the characters are barely audible in one of the training rooms in many episodes. You can hear them, but you get too much echo in the rooms. On the lighter side, the word ""AMAZING"" (or a form of it) is used in the title of every single episode. Now that is ""amazingly"" annoying and ""amazingly"" redundant. I love you, Sora, but I feel I have been robbed by paying a high price for this DVD set.",1225929600,2,1278,4.4425531914893615
8081525,5,B000B5IONO,"I must admit, while reading some of the previous reviews I was a little skeptical. But after taking the chance and ordering this series I found a more than worthy addition to my library. I have only a few titles compared to the numerous others who I have seen review but count myself lucky for taking their advice and purchasing Kaleido Star.",1214006400,,342,4.532258064516129
8081526,5,B000B5IONO,I just finished this box set and I love it. I love Sora and the triumphs she has to over come. It really teaches that you can do anything you set your mind to as long as you give it your all. I recommend it!,1202515200,,207,3.6222222222222222
8081527,5,B000B5IONO,"I am waiting for Sep. 4 for the 2nd season to hit the shelves. At first, I didn't think I would like it. But, I did! All the characters were likable (most of them). And I think the plot line is different than most animes. I mean, stunts on trapezes? That's AWESOME!
