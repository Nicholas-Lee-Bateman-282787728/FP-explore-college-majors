8262731,4,B0016JYYZG,"I mostly like agi videos even though they may be older converts from vhs so they may not look the best but the information in this one is good and will help you maintain your pistol which is why I buy them, but I hold no delusional belief that this can make me an expert or a gunsmith.",1467849600,,285,3.9310344827586206
8262732,5,B0016JYYZG,This series of DVD's on firearms are very clear and detailed while being presented in a manner the viewer can understand readily.,1414800000,,129,4.909090909090909
8262733,2,B0016JYYZG,After watching the 1911 disassembly  and reassembly dvd I was disappointed in this course. They do use a cutaway 1911 to show you how the parts function but it didn't click with me. I'd pass on this course.,1408147200,,206,4.421052631578948
8262734,3,B0016JYYZG,A good starter course for working on your Colt 1911 pistol.  You would be well advised to assemble additional literature and instructions to supplement this course before disassembling your firearm.,1407110400,,198,5.6
8262735,5,B0016JYYZG,AGI produces some of the best gunsmithing videos on the market. I just wish they were an accredited school. Awesome overall.,1397088000,2,124,4.9523809523809526
