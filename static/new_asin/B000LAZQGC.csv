8160619,5,B000LAZQGC,"I have watched  every one of the Biker Build offs, and this one is my favorite. Indian Larry's bikes were the best. The chain frame bike in this episode was FANTASTIC. It was a very sad day when he passed away doing the trick ride at the end of the episode. He always said,, start the day with a question mark, he died doing what he loved doing, Great episode, a piece of BIKER HISTORY. Well worth viewing.",1297382400,,406,4.205128205128205
