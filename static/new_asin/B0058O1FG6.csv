8461948,5,B0058O1FG6,A rather simple video that covers a very complex topic. Good info and examples provided for understanding power and getting one's whole body weight behind your movement. I think any martial artist could benefit from this video. Wish there were some forms included.,1347753600,,264,5.162790697674419
