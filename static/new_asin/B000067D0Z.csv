1713826,5,B000067D0Z,"Perhaps you have to have some prior knowledge of the subject matter of this film in order to properly appreciate it.  ...  I don't think so, but maybe I'm wrong.  As a person, a human being, hearing the words of actual human beings who are trying to sort through their feelings after a tragedy, I would have been moved had I known nothing of the death of Matthew Shepard (as it is, I knew very little before viewing this movie).
What initially attracted me to this film was the fact that it was an HBO production, and I've seen several quality HBO productions in the past.  I'd heard a little about the Matthew Shepard case, and I wanted to know more.  So I saw the film.
First, this film isn't really a documentary-it's a dramatazation of interviews and conversations that members of a New York theatre troupe conducted with citizens of Laramie, Wyoming  These interviews served as the basis for the play ""The Laramie Project.""  It's a little distracting at first, because the film is shot in documentary-style and yet the people who are supposed to be citizens of the town are recognizable actors and actresses (such as Steve Buscemi and Christina Ricci).  And I wondered how much of the dialogue was real and how much was fictional.  But once I got over those concerns, I became engrossed in the story (after all, movies are fiction anyway).  And what a story.  For those who don't know, Matthew Shepard was a 21 year old college student who was brutally beaten and left for dead in Laramie, Wyoming in 1998.  The young men who attacked him were Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney.  Shepard was in a coma for a week before he died on October 12, 1998.  Shepard was [homosexual], and his killers claimed that he'd made passes at them, and so they decided to drive him to the edge of town, tie him up, and beat him.  To teach him a lesson.
Whether Shepard learned his lesson or not is unknown, since he died soon after the attack.  But the citizens of Laramie sure seem to be learning something, and they want to talk about it.  The townspeople who were interviewed are a mix of [homosexual] residents, college professors, college students, and outraged citizens.  The young man who found Matthew Shepard, the Police Officer who was the first on the scene, a friend of Shepard's named Romaine, and a local Catholic Priest are standouts.  The emotions run the gamut from young people trying to reconcile what they've always been taught (that homosexuality is wrong) with the message that it's just another lifestyle choice, to others who believe that no one deserves to be beaten that way-but hey, Shepard shouldn't have been hitting on those young men...A local pastor prays that Shepard had time in the last moments of his life to repent and turn to Christ, a local Priest calls citizens together for a candlelight vigil, and all the while the members of the theatre troupe record the reactions of the townspeople as they themselves are touched and changed by what they see.
Here we have people talking, people yelling, people laughing, people crying.  Everyone has been affected in one way or another by the tragedy, and what they say as they struggle to put their feelings into words (and the emotions that are so compellingly portrayed by the actors and actresses here) make for a startling portrayal of human emotion.  The story is told not just through words but through music, through facial expressions, through moments of silence that no words can fill.  Part character study, part ""documentary,"" part ""message film,"" ""The Laramie Project"" succeeds as excellent storytelling.  In a word: Haunting.  Apparently, it's not for everyone.  But I don't see why not.",1032566400,99,3671,4.7614533965244865
1713827,3,B000067D0Z,"As an actor that was actualy in the play version, i feel that this movie did as good of a job that you could expect a movie to do.  In the play 8 people play all the parts and so the characors are much more dynamic, all the charictors are very flat in the movie.  I did not agree with some of the casting, the person the played Jedidiah Schultz was way fidgety and odd for the part, ... .  Also they cut half of the Techtonic theater project members.  I feel that a video tape of the stage play would be much more effective than this movie but it still has a certain place in my heart.",1029369600,4,585,3.9322033898305087
1713828,3,B000067D0Z,"The film of the highly accredited play was, in my opinion as effective as a film could be. I personally think that this show is only effective on a theatrical stage. There are very few bad things I would say about this movie. I am a huge fan of the play as a piece of amazing theatre and there are A LOT of cuts from the play as far as the dialogue goes, but nothing that upset me too much. My major argument with the movie is some severe miscasting on the part of Jedidiah Shultz(played in the film by someone much older than the written character and a little too neurotic for me) and, of course, the mistake of casting Joshua Jackson as any other character outside his Pacey-esque, mediocre abilities.
The Laramie Project is an incredibly sculpted piece of dramatic literature that is truly at it's most effective when on stage. I highly recommend any person who has seen the movie, to find a staged version of it and go see it NOW! Then you will see the true magnitude of this piece of art. Each monologue is artistically and beautifully intertwined with the next to open your eyes to world of this enriching and captivating story of a town and it's defenses and reactions to the severe beating of a gay college student. I think the film was very well done, considering the cut a lot of the already incredibly sculpted dialogue. I did enjoy that Moises Kaufman, the writer, directed it so that he did what needed to be done: Tell the story. What I LOVE about the play, and not so much the movie, is that it shows the story from equal view points and doesn't give you a biased view. It's easy for us as a society to blam the town of Laramie and call it a day. But with The Laramie Project you can sympathize and sometimes agree with a lot the people of Laramie...instead of immediately attacking them as redneck bigots like the media warped our minds to think. You see all of the angles of the story, and they are each given an equal chance to speak there minds and opinions. Some, you are still going to hate, but there is a truth and realness to it.
I really recomend those who have not yet read the play read it...but most importantly, if you see The Laramie Project being put on anywhere near you, go west young man and see it. I promise you...your life will be changed.",1027728000,7,2277,4.334894613583138
1713829,2,B000067D0Z,"This movie is simply a documentary. In fact, it's really just a bunch of interviews. And interviews with actors portraying the original people that lived in this town. So, really, it's just a made-up documentary.
That understood, it was well done. It looked real, the actors did a great job. I don't remember hearing about this true-life incident, so I wasn't swept up in the emotion, nor was I really interested in the event.
I would have liked this movie a whole lot more if it was NOT a documentary, but a re-enactment of the whole incident, from the Shepard boy's life and home and at school, to the murder, to the aftermath. THEN, the interviews could have had some meaning.
I watched it. I sat through the whole thing. But if I came across this documentary, or rather, a REAL documentary with the real people on Discovery, A&E, or some channel like that, I would change the channel and not be interested at all.",1027296000,2,917,4.5636363636363635
1713830,5,B000067D0Z,"This is an excellent film! I really urge everyone to put this film at the top of their list of must-sees. I thought the acting and the direction were absolutely incredible and the movie has really stayed with me. It is a very unique kind of film because it uses actual interviews from real people as its script. I was skeptical when I first heard about it as I really didn't want to see a violent, graphic movie depicting or re-enacting a hate crime, but so many different people were telling me I HAD to see it that I decided to risk it. Whether you remember or don't remember the details of the killing of gay university student Matthew Shepard it doesn't matter. The movie is not really about the crime itself but with how the people of Laramie, WY dealt with it. In the end the movie is totally inspiring and uplifting, with humor and thought-provoking scenes throughout. It is really about where America is today. I put it in my all-time top ten!",1026172800,10,951,4.44
1713831,5,B000067D0Z,"I purchased this DVD having never seen the film when it aired on HBO.  I was reluctant to view it because I wasn't sure if the material was going to be handled respectfully and appropriately.
My fears were put to rest quickly as the film progressed.  The actors are wonderfully fit for their characters, the subject matter was very well covered and done tastefully and factually.  My hat goes off to everyone who had a part in the creation of this remarkable film.  This movie should be required viewing for all humans...

But having said that, this is a good movie, despite the fact that in the early scenes  the stage origins of the piece are very obvious. Everyone's good in it, and mercifully we are spared any crime scene images. But yes,'The Book of Matt' the meticulously researched new look at the crime, is almost worthy of a whole new film. Some people in the gay community are insisting that this book somehow diminishes the horror of the crime, and dilutes the power of it. I don't think it does at all. A dreadful event is still a dreadful event, and a tragic death is still a tragic death. And the fact that we know more now, just adds more layers to the story. And gives us even more to think about.

I'm glad so many big/semi-big stars, many of whom have Emmys and Golden Globes and are Hollywood veterans, pulled together to lend their talents to this very special production.  I know the Sheppard homicide was a long time ago now and even this tribute movie was done more than a decade ago.
However, it is important that it stays out there and keeps being watched.  Hopefully it has gotten more people thinking about sexual equality and obliterating homophobia.

1713896,4,B000067D0Z,"The Laramie Project is a film about a homosexual boy who was brutally murdered in a small town in Wyoming, and the film centers around the interviews from the people around town and the segments connected to the murder...

however, the interviews are actually not from the real people who went through the ordeal- it's all been remade with actors and actresses.  FAMOUS actors and actresses might I add.  I must have recognized at least 6 different people starring in the film.

The storytelling does gradually improve after the first 30 minutes, and the ending segment is the one that shocks me the most because it's about the murdered victims father inside a courtroom giving an honest and emotional speech, and I've never heard a speech move me quite *this* hard.

The people who killed the boy show just heartless they truly are, so the film will probably spend quite a lot of time surprising and shocking you.  You just don't expect people to reach a level of hatred *this* extreme, however it's true, since this terrible murder is based on a true story that really did happen over 10 years ago.

Expect to see a movie dominated with a bunch of interviews involving actors playing the roles of the victims friends and family and several people around town.

The whole film is shot in an almost documentary-like style, and so none of the sadness, or the importance, of this chapter of modern American history is either underplayed of overwrought. It's told with simplicity and honesty and, like all great art, leaves the audience not with answers but with more questions.

All the performances are outstanding, with no exceptions. But Laura Linney in one five-minute scene manages seamlessly and brilliantly to convey the entire message and theme of this film in a single monologue. It is extraordinary.

1713915,4,B000067D0Z,"Matthew Shepard was about two months short of his twenty-second birth when he was robbed, beaten, tied to a fence post and left to die in a rural area of Wyoming.  The man who found him at first thought he was a scarecrow.  Rushed to Poudre Valley Hospital at Fort Collins, he died on 12 October 1998--and when Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney were arrested for the crime they resorted to a defense known as ""gay panic.""  Matthew Shepherd had propositioned them, they said, and they were so horrified that they killed him in response.

The gay community and numerous civil rights watchdog groups were outraged by the defense, and as more and more facts came to light it seemed that the crime was somewhat more complicated than Henderson and McKinney wanted the public to know.  Witnesses stated that Henderson and McKinney had specifically targeted Shepherd because he was gay.  After much legal wrangling, Henderson pled guilty and testified against McKinney, who was convicted; after still more legal wrangling, and at the request of Shepherd's parents, McKinney escaped the death penalty but has no chance of parole.

The case made headlines from end of the United States to the other and prompted numerous calls for Hate Crimes legislation, which had long been stalled both at the state and federal level.  And in the midst of the confusion, chaos, and controversy, Moises Kaufman and the members of The Tectonic Theatre Project arrived on the scene, interviewing more than two hundred people about their thoughts and feelings on the case.  These were shaped into THE LARAMIE PROJECT, a drama that debuted in 2000 and which has since shocked, impressed, and deeply moved audiences from coast to coast.

On the stage, THE LARAMIE PROJECT is played by eight performers who enact the numerous interview subjects in a three act, three hour performance on a largely bare stage.  When filmed by HBO in 2002, it was reduced in length by about half and each interview subject was performed by a different actor--some of them members of the Techtonic Theatre Project, some of them well-known actors such as Laura Linney and Peter Fonda.  The result is indeed powerful... but not as effective as the stage version, for on film it tends be a series of readings by ""talking heads,"" a sort of pseudo-documentary, rather than as a cohesive whole.

That said, the great difference between the film and the original script is one of balance.  On stage, THE LARAMIE PROJECT takes no sides per se; it simply sets forth the words and allows the audience to judge.  On screen, it is distinctly slanted, cutting much of the conservative commentary that gave the original such remarkable balance.  Even so, and although far outstripped by the stage version, it is a powerful voice for equality, tolerance, and simple human decency.  Recommended.

1713918,2,B000067D0Z,"This film, which is really just a series of re-enacted interviews, is a dismal portrayal of a community in agony.  It's natural when someone you know dies to feel sad, miserable, angry and outraged.  But the producers of this film dwell on the community's misery and suffering, and any opportunity to learn from this crime is lost in the raw emotions of the town's residents.

This is, quite simply, a film with an agenda.  It is intended to incite anger and promote hate crime legislation.  Dwelling on this crime is not going to do anyone any good.",1173052800,2,550,4.628865979381444
1713919,4,B000067D0Z,"One of the most powerful speeches witnessed in this film are those by Laura Linney, who tries to create a similarity between the death of Matthew Shepard and the accidental death of a Wyoming State Trooper that same night.  It does create a moment of thought in your mind that links the power of the death of Shepard to that of the power of the media, but it is just for a fleeting moment as we are whisked back into another voice, with another opinion.  That voice is both the strength and weakness of this film.  As a viewer, new to this story and type of storytelling, I felt a bit over biased.  I realize that instead of focusing on the death and life of Matthew Shepard, Kaufman, focused on the collective voice of the town, which was nothing but a bag of mixed messages.  As I sat, thinking about this film over the course of several days, that is the only issue that I had trouble grappling.  This was an emotional film, chalk full of actors giving surprising monologues about their personal opinions as we collectively watch the aftermath of such a horrid crime.  We even get the chance to see how the death of Matthew Shepard caused an ill fate to another person within the community.  Again, these side stories were powerful to watch because it gave a living soul to the town, but where The Laramie Project went a bit too far was the over-dramatic nature of the characters.

While I would agree that there was probably some emotion behind those that chose to take part in the interviews, I don't believe you would find such a doctor, with such a dramatic ""umph"" saying, ""We take offense to this murder"", like no other than Peter Fonda could say it.  Christina Ricci, in my eyes, was the embodiment of my last statement.  Perhaps Kaufman, would have benefited more by placing unknowns in the roles instead of these name Hollywood players.  While they were not A-grade actors, they each did a phenomenal job in this film - but oddly, this was the problem.  Steve Buscemi speaking about his relationship with Shepard made me see Buscemi being Buscemi.  I didn't see the character that he was playing.  I didn't see Fonda's doctor's character.  I didn't see anything of value behind Ricci's character (outside of a definite Ricci being Ricci) - and while I realize that this was not a work of fiction, without the development of a known character, they were just actors speaking powerful lines.  The lines stood on their own, and it was those lines that continued my attention through the film.  Alas, I could not see Joshua Jackson (from Dawson's Creek) as the actual bartender or Dylan Baker as the head of the hospital because I knew these actors.  I wanted better from them.  The most emotional speeches came from those that I was not fully familiar with.  Those like the man who watched the parade route, or the actor that played Matthew Shepard's father.  These smaller, unknown bits, was what made The Laramie Project stand out and break a tear out of even the strongest wall.

I want to express again that I thought that this was a very powerful film; there were just certain moments that were using clich&eacute; elements to heighten the emotion of the story.  This wasn't needed in the least bit.  While I know that having the media attention when the residents of Laramie walked out of the courtroom was surprising, the film technique used to demonstrate this seemed cheap, and nearly like a low blow to the story.  The glossed effect of when Ricci's character, and her mother, made angels to block the words of protestors, seemed fake on screen - while perhaps actual footage of this event would have strengthened the emotion.  Perhaps I am asking too much, but when Ricci walks out with those angel wings flying high, I just expected Will Smith to come out of nowhere, screaming a line that would surely demonstrate to those protestors who was in control here.  It came out a bit too Hollywood.  As well as the scene where Dylan Baker cries, which I felt was the better of all the cinematic moments.  It was powerful, yet subdued.  It could have used more realism.  Am I complaining too much?  Nope, because I thought this was a brilliant film with how unique it was with its portrait of storytelling.  I liked hearing the voices, in fact, if this were a story on CD, it would be a personal favorite, but because we were distracted by images of famous actors speaking in their own voice as well as unclimactic clich&eacute; scenes, it softened the blow.  I was still teary at the end, but this could have been a film to rival that of Angels in America had it just tried a bit harder to avoid the Hollywood influx and paint a more vivid portrait of your average American town.

Overall, I must admit, it took me several days for this film to settle, but I think I could view it again.  I especially would like to see Amy Madigan's performance, which I thought, her struggle with what happened, nearly overshadowed what happened to Matthew Shepard.  I could have watched an entire film based solely on her.  It is amazing what the media chooses to cover, and what they choose to ignore.  I like what this film demonstrated.  I like that it didn't depict this Wyoming town of rednecks and hillbillies never quite understanding what was wrong with the murder of Shepard.  I am glad that we were able to see humanity break through the barriers and show emotion, show sadness, and look beyond the lifestyle to see the human being that was wrongly sentenced.  I do think, nonetheless, that liberties were taken with certain actors and certain camera shots, but overall that can be overlooked.  By throwing in some unknowns to this picture, I think the drama and the intensity of the event could have been heightened.  This is a sad thing that happened, and I am glad that Hollywood chose to open the envelope, but they just didn't give it that final seal of approval.  Actors were actors and clich&eacute; moments were used to build emotion.  You already had a sad story; we didn't need the charades to improve it.  I strongly suggest watching this film, if anything, to see that there is compassion within a town burdened with such a horrific crime.  It is sad, and will surely bring a tear to anyone's eye.

1713930,4,B000067D0Z,"It is important to see this compelling and horrifying story because it is a powerful reminder that this sort of thing still happens in the US.  What makes the film unique is that all of the dialogue was taken from actual interviews with residents of Laramie, Wyoming, the city where Matthew Shepard was murdered.",1169337600,,312,4.777777777777778
1713931,4,B000067D0Z,"This script is arranged from actual interview comments of the people of Laramie, Wyoming.  Laramie is a place where two young local residents brutally beat and killed a young gay man, leaving him for dead for 18 hours before his comatose body was found.  ""We don't grow children like that here . . . well, it's pretty clear we do.""  The script comes from their words, making the movie revealing and educational.

The idea that kept recurring as I watched this film was how this event would have easily been forgetten in the greater cultural memory if this movie had not been made.  And I was also impressed how clueless and stupid so many of the people of Laramie were without knowing how stupid they were.  I'm not throwing stones at them, because I have been far more stupid in my past than they appeared to be.  But it is just embarrassing watching them reveal their consistent hate and ignorance, still unaware of their stupidity.  I don't use the word ""stupid"" often, because it is a word that for me is as bad as most profanity, but it is appropriate here.

This movie reveals tragedies that are very relevant to today's audience because I live in a state where homosexuals are being treated as second class citizens by the legislature and the general public.  We're one of 8 states with popular vote initiatives this year to change the laws so that homosexual relationships are statutorily not given full protections or validation.  According to the Assoc. Press, ""Constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage have passed in all 20 states where they appeared on the ballot . . . passed overwhelmingly, ranging from a high of 86 percent in favor in Mississippi to Oregon's 57 percent, the slimmest margin in the country. Experts say . . . lawmakers feel only benefits and no backlash.""  Sadly, gays are still being discarded from first class protections & rights through legal and majority-sanctioned means.

These actors and filmmakers chose not to be silent.  I appreciated Jonathan Lapin's comment in his review below - ""closets kill"".  Every time society creates a legal definition that creates a ""less than ideal"" class of people, there is an implicit authorization to treat those people with less than full rights and privileges.

Additionally, when someone has to hide something they love or something that defines them, it can intrinsicially create negative health effects on that person, even in the absence of notorious mistreatment by others.  When someone has to hide and implode so many things that feel true to them, then those self-closeting and self-silencing actions can manifest themselves in both physical and mental disorders.  When something so core to their personal definition is discouraged by everyone around them, that can cause an otherwise good person to shutdown in negative ways.

Of the deceased gay man, Matthew Shepard, his parents released these words upon notice of his death, ""Like a good son, he was caring to the end, and removed guilt and stress from the family.""  Do what you can to help remove feelings of unwarranted guilt.  Help the gay and bisexual people around you overcome any false guilt feelings they may still have.  ""You must tell your story,"" the movie says.  And I praise the filmmakers for telling this young man's story for future generations to continue to remember.",1159747200,,3335,4.926654740608229

Unlike some of the other reviewers, we did not find the use of actors to portray the citizens of Laramie detracted from the film at all.  In fact, we were in agreement that the portrayals were very good and conveyed the emotions of the residents far better than the residents themselves may have been able to in front of a camera.

With that as my background, I entered The Laramie Project with curiosity regarding the reactions of Laramie's townspeople to this tragedy that received national attention.

Shameless hatred was definitely reflected by several Laramie residents, but not everyone shared that view. That fact was refreshing. The law enforcement officer who freed Matthew from the fence at the scene of the crime was incredibly sympathetic. Her personal views concerning his lifestyle were not revealed, but her view of this youth as an innocent victim of a horrific crime were apparent. This film, though actors portrayed the townspeople interviewed, has the feel of a documentary. Knowing that the expressions were accurate was alarming at times.

1713937,5,B000067D0Z,"""The Laramie Project"" is an adaptation of the play of the same name, written by Moises Kaufman and based on the interviews he and his group had in 1998 with many of  Laramie's inhabitants, after the callous beating up of Matthew Shepard in that relatively small town of Wyoming. Matthew, a young man that was living in Laramie and that happened to be gay, was a victim, and became a symbol. But as another reviewer pointed out, he was first and foremost a human being that deserved to live.

Matthew died due to the injuries received in what was defined as a hate crime. He was gay, and two men took exception to it, beating him up and leaving him tied to a fence. The man that discovered him the following day thought at first he was a scarecrow. He was so disfigured that he just didn't seem a person any more. Matthew was taken to a hospital, where he stayed in a comma until he died, a week later.

The interviews allow us to witness what the people of Laramie were thinking regarding this event, something closely linked to their views on religion, homosexuality, tolerance and a lot more.  One character said something that made a big impact on me, and that explains a lot: ""I guess I didn't understand the magnitude with which some people hate"".

On the whole, I think this is an excellent film, and I am sorry I didn't watch it before. I strongly recommend it to you, as a great film with a good message.

The desperate helplessness felt by the town (and the world) as they wait to hear of Matt Shephard's fate is keenly played and the absolute devastation felt by so many after Matt's death is even more apparent through the performances of this incredible cast.  Some reviewers have critiqued this film for agenda-pushing, but it's important to remember that Moises Kaufman IS a liberal, gay, New York playwright.  Sure, the film takes a stance on the murder and definitely dismisses the arguments that Matt shouldn't have been in a bar or ""hitting on"" straight men or that he was a promiscuous person who had already gotten himself into trouble with his lifestyle before.  However, I think that the more conservative viewpoints of others are considered, and, at the very least, included.  It is also true that Matthew Shephard became larger than life because of his death and that the murders of many other minorities (racial, ethnic, religious) do not get the kind of press as Matt did.  However, I think it is completely unfair to dismiss the impact of this death and this film simply because others have not taken up the same project for other victims. Ultimately this film forces us to think about the way we feel about the ""other"" and how we feel about protecting that person, learing about that person, and loving that person for who they are - both as individuals and as communities.",1147564800,3,1463,4.74015748031496

1713950,5,B000067D0Z,"This HBO adaptation of Moises Kaufman's play by the same name reminds of us just how important pay-for-viewing television is in this country. Based on interviews Mr. Kaufman and others conducted with the locals in Laramie, Wyoming after the tragic murder of Matthew Shepard in October, 1998, this film is a sad commentary on what can happen when anyone condones hatred, either by his actions or inactions.

Mr. Kaufman has gathered a stellar cast of actors: Steve Buscemi, Laura Linney, Janeane Garofalo, Christina Ricci, Peter Fonda, Camryn Manheim et al, all of whom give fantastic performances in their portrayal of Laramie locals. On the other hand, it would take a bad actor indeed who could not get into these roles. Terry Kinney as Dennis Shepard, Matthew's father, gives a stunning performance as he makes a courtroom speech asking for mercy for Aaron McKinney, one of the two men who kidnapped and killed Matthew. If you don't tear up during his speech, you have been dead for several months already. (Mr. Shepard, by the way, is a far better person than I am. I do not believe I would have asked that McKinney be given a chance to live.)

The play is much longer than the film version and in some ways works better. For example, we get more than a glimpse of the locals and thus are able to see how some of them actually change for the better during this horrendous time for this town of less than 30,000 people. Also, I noticed in the play that the Baptist minister is not named while ministers of other churches are, an interesting touch.

In commentary accompanying the film on the DVD, Camryn Manheim-- one of my favorite actresses-- says that this film IS about Laramie. I wish that she were right although I fear that the same climate that produced the killers, Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson, exists in countless other towns across this country. Not every gay twenty-one-year-old gets to live in Boston or New York or San Francisco.

There are glimmers of hope, however. Some people change; others, though not necessarily homophobic, are made aware of the problems that young gay people face. Some gay people become more active-- there is a moving scene where gay people and others dressed in white sheets are able to completely cover up and practically shut out the hate-filled shouts of Phelps, whom I will not dignify by calling ""Reverend."" Finally, one character-- I believe it is the hospital administrator-- admonishes parents: ""go home and give your kids a hug."" That's not bad advice at all.",1129334400,8,2522,4.804147465437788

Rather than addressing the murder as such, this film compartmentalizes everyone involved as either ""enlightened"" (i.e. the New York people, the gays) or hateful ""bumpkins"" (i.e. the people of Wyoming, churchgoers) and this is very condescending!

The Reverend Phelps makes an appearance that is absolutely sickening in the movie as well.  How people can honestly thank God for AIDS because it kills homosexuals is disguisting to me, and there was a very touching scene revolving around Phelp's attendance and the pain a friend of Shepard feels and what she does about it.  I was first introduced to this story at my school's GSA, but I still remember the vigils held for him in Ft. Collins and around the country.

Although I have never seen the movie version, I get the strong feeling that no matter what way The Laramie Project is showcased, the point will still come across in a powerful and moving way.

The teens who stared in the play really brought the emotions of Shock, Hate, Disbelife and Disgust to the surface. Rather it were the polic officer sobbing hystically as she recalled throwing caution to the wind to save Matthew, only to later discover she had been exposed to his HIV infected blood, the Minister preeching that Homosexuality was wrong, or the gay  college profesor revealing that after the attack, she lived in fear of being assulted and killed herself.

Despite the fact the play was extremly long, and put on by a small Long Island school with a small budget and small stage, I still feel as thow it did a marvelous job in bringing to light the fact that hate, closed mindedness and unimaginable horror can thrive in even the smallest towns such as Laramie, where everyone thought  ""My town dosn't harbor such fellings""  If it can happen in Laramie, it can happen in my little town, who's high school is home to only 200 kids grades 9-12.

1713958,5,B000067D0Z,"The 1998 gay hate crime murder of, Matthew Shepard, really hurt many people around the world, including myself. The very fact that this sweet young man, so slight in height and weight, with an angelic face could be kidnapped by two idiot kids, tied to a spit rail wooden fence and pistol whipped and tortured until his skull was literally bashed with fractures, and then left there to die, tied to that fence for 18 hours in the near freezing temperatures until a bicyclist came upon him. Matthew was at this time, in a coma, and for 4 days the world watched, waited, and hoped he would recover. Matthew did not. He died October 12th, 1998 in the hospital. This film, through a series of massive interviews with the residents of this town, is done in a documentary style, with the actors repeating the words collected in those interviews. It is very well made, very powerful and also very very sad. They filmed this in the actual town. You get to see the inside of the bar Matt was in before his abduction, as well as the college he attended, the rail fence he was tied to (THANK GOD NO MURDER IS RE-CREATED HERE), as well as the actual courtroom the trial took place at. Hopefully, people who are homophobic can see by watching this film, people are people--no matter if they are of a different race or sexual orientation. We all need to stand UNITED, encourage state laws to include zero tolerance of gay hate crimes. Matthew Shepard did not deserve to die. If anything good can come from such an evil thing that happened, let's hope this movie can open some eyes and we can stop the hate and innocent people being murdered.",1100044800,26,1626,4.5152542372881355
1713959,4,B000067D0Z,"I think my title gives it all away: the play version of The Laramie Project is MUCH MUCH better then the movie.  Its longer, its more indepth, and it conveys the feelings of the Laramie residents better.  Because of the formatt, I think that The Laramie Project is just a better play (I've seen it twice and own a copy) then it makes a film.

That said, if you are someone who hates to read, this film will get the job done.  It will make you cry (in particular, when the girl in the headscarf is talking about owning this crime) but some of the moments come off a little stilted and melodramatic to me (like the whole first 10 minutes basically).  I love that the film is actually shot in Laramie, so you see the counthouse where the boys who murdered him were tried and you see the fence he was tied to.  That makes a better set then anything Hollywood could build.  And the cast is excellent, many great vetran actors and talented younger people.  The story is so powerful that it earns a 4 stars from me, dispite being a too short and melodramatic.

As a DVD, I would have wanted more featurettes on the shoot, Laramie and the people from the play.  There were two short ones, but I felt as though it wasn't enough.  There is no commentary which is disapointing.

In conclusion, if you want to get The Laramie Project, read the play.  If you are too lazy to read the play, the movie will get it done.",1098489600,5,1404,4.2727272727272725

The reality of the movie is shocking in its effect.  The filmmakers, obviously, made every effort to truthfully portray both peoples? words and the manner in which they were spoken.  To sit and listen to one person describe Matthew Shepard?s tragic death as deserved and in the next breath describe Laramie as a ?live and let live? sort of place is shocking.  The casual, ingrained, encouraged heterosexism that ?The Laramie Project? depicts is in sharp contrast to the heartwarming acceptance and love that some of the townspeople portrayed through their actions and their interviews.  For someone who grew up aware of the GLBTA community?s struggles and grew up in an extraordinarily liberal University town, Laramie was a slap in the face.  The world is not Ann Arbor, MI and there are people out there who really truly believe that all homosexuals are perverts and that to live as a homosexual is to incite violence.  Even in the shadow of a community were there was so much hate there were a few really moving moments of ? something markedly stronger than acceptance.  Please watch this movie; it is truth, both heartwarming and terrifying.  As a white, middle class, protestant, Aryan American I could only appreciate the fear that so many minorities live with after watching this movie.  This movie is a masterpiece that words simply can?t convey.  Watch this movie regardless of your relationship to the LGBTA community, or lack there of, it hits home.

I am attracted to films that have a large cast in it and this one was no exception. Everyone in this film had something going on for them; they signed on to this project not because they just wanted to work with other people but, they signed on to this because they belived in it so much. Each person had their time to shine. I felt that this film is one big monologue of the same idea. Each actor/actresses were given a monologue and had to present them and each and everyone of them presented their parts perfectly. I cannot even imagine how big this cast was. It's truly something to be seen. The editing and music of the film is great and so is the story. I belive that there is at least one charatcer in the movie that a viewer can relate to. I felt like I was looking through a telescope and watching these people just present their souls to you. It's very intimate and real, and you feel like you are part of the whole story.
Overall, if you like movies that are dramatic, real and one that has an enormous amount of actors/actresses who want to make a good film, then The Laramie Project is the one for you. GO CHECK IT OUT.",1087257600,3,1528,4.148148148148148

1713975,5,B000067D0Z,"The Emmy and Golden Globe nominated ""The Laramie Project"" is a powerful film that originally aired in October, 2001.  Its deep words and theme have the intensity to keep audiences watching every scene closely.  This true story educates people on why hate is not a human virtue and what society can do to stop it.  The story of what happened to Matthew Shephard on October 7, 1998 is slowly told by people in the town of Laramie, where the murder happened.  Five people from New York City interview 200 town citizens searching for the truth.  However, the film isn't about his murder; this is about Laramie, Wyoming.  The writers brilliantly distinguish the plot.  Every character interviewed has their own view of homosexuality and homophobia.  Their words, especially the homophobic ones, are shocking.  Meanwhile, their stories take audiences to the events as they were occurring between October 7-12, 1998, Shephard's funeral, and the court dates for his killers.  Every raw emotion has the realisms that asides this film from many others.  The unique camera effects wonderfully desplict the ugliness and fear of the horrifying events.  The real news clips are great necessities that prove how real it is.  Every member of the large acting cast performed their role beautifully: Oscar nominees Peter Fonda and Laura Linney, Camryn Manheim, Christina Ricci, Clea DuVall, Joshua Jackson, Ben Foster, Steve Buscemi, Janeane Garofalo, and more.

1713977,3,B000067D0Z,"THE LARAMIE PROJECT

(USA - 2002)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Digital

Following the murder of Matthew Shepard by a couple of homophobic thugs in the nondescript town of Laramie, Wyoming, a theater troupe descends on the area and questions residents, politicians, doctors and police officers in an effort to probe the circumstances which led to this appalling crime.

When 21 year old Matthew Shepard was murdered by Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney in October 1998, it seemed like the culmination of a ceaseless conservative crusade against the so-called 'gay lifestyle' (whatever that means). For some, Matthew's death had been facilitated by the ongoing propagation of hatred which flourishes unchecked in every aspect of our daily lives, and which found its ultimate grim expression in the beating, torture and near-crucifixion of a virtually defenseless gay man. The killing prompted a national outpouring of grief and anger, fuelled by a media campaign that seemed more concerned with gaining mileage from a juicy story than challenging the attitudes which had given rise to this event in the first place. THE LARAMIE PROJECT - which began life as a stageplay created by the Tectonic Theater Project in New York, using the actual words of Laramie residents instead of 'dialogue' - attempts to redress the balance by probing the causes and consequences of bigotry, and the deep-rooted feelings of those most affected by the murder. It's a heartfelt debut from Tectonic founder and artistic director Moises Kaufman.

Interviewees include friends and colleagues of Matthew, the investigating police officers, the doctors who cared for him during the coma which preceded his death, and those whose religious convictions appear to have clouded their judgment and humanity (in one appalling sequence, a mealy-mouthed reverend [Michael Emerson] expresses sympathy for the victim, whilst simultaneously hoping that Matthew spent his last conscious moments reflecting on his 'lifestyle'). Presented in mock-documentary format, in which the 'characters' are portrayed by an all-star cast of familiar faces (including Steve Buscemi, Amy Madigan, Laura Linney, Christina Ricci and Frances Sternhagen, amongst many others), Kaufman's film offers a platform to those on both sides of the debate, though the filmmakers' own liberal outlook is plainly obvious throughout. But, in taking a stand against fundamentalist attitudes, THE LARAMIE PROJECT seeks to demonstrate the flaws in extremist viewpoints. In other words, those with bigoted opinions are given enough rope to hang themselves, and some of them leap head-first into the noose. Thankfully, Fred Phelps and his satanic crew - who rubbed salt into a festering wound by protesting against 'fags' during Matthew's funeral - are reduced to little more than an unwelcome guest appearance, during which they're confronted by a host of silent, accusing townsfolk dressed as angels...

Reluctant to shrink from uncomfortable truths, the film is not afraid to tackle the thorny issue of Matthew's HIV status and the small - but significant - part it played during the fall-out from this terrible event (notably, the devastating consequences for one of the police officers who was first to arrive at the scene of the crime), but that hasn't prevented some critics from questioning the film's 'narrow' liberal viewpoint. For instance, is homophobia and AIDS more deserving of such a high-profile movie than any number of similar social ills? No, but no one ever complained about high-profile movies which (quite rightly) denounce racism! And while prominent actors may not be lining up to star in powerful dramas about cancer (for example), those afflicted by cancer are hardly likely to encounter discrimination at state and governmental level because of their 'lifestyle choices', with little more than begrudging tolerance for their medical welfare.

Secondly, the film is accused in some quarters of being a patronising diatribe, in which a bunch of 'backwoods hicks' are taught the error of their ways by 'omniscient and enlightened Californians' (as one skeptical Internet reviewer has complained). Only the townspeople themselves can confirm or deny this particular accusation, though the Tectonic Theater Project mounted a special performance of the stageplay in Laramie itself which didn't seem to generate any controversy. Other questions are not so easy to dismiss: Was the country really so outraged by Matthew's death, or was the controversy generated by little more than a media frenzy? After all, despite the platitudes expressed at the time, little has changed in the intervening years with regards to hate crimes legislation. In some ways, this is hardly surprising, since most politicians find it expedient to pacify an alignment of fanatical religious bigots. If nothing else, THE LARAMIE PROJECT reminds us to guard against prejudice and hatred wherever it manifests itself, to derive inspiration from the likes of Matthew Shepard, and - most importantly - to honor the fallen.

As a film, 'Laramie' (which opened the Sundance Film Festival in 2002) is an impressive achievement; Kaufman has brought his considerable skills as a theater director to bear on a much broader cinematic canvas. It's mostly talking heads, of course, but there's an urgency in the telling which might have been lost in a straightforward documentary presentation. Ultra-professional in all departments, and acted with conviction by a sterling cast, the movie is thought-provoking and poignant, and inspires confidence that all is not lost in the battle against ignorance.",1079568000,10,5634,5.438215102974828

It's hard to believe but I've heard people ask ""what makes this individual case more important than others.""  Nothing and everything.  It's a tragedy whenever a life is taken, but when the only motivation is hate it impacts everyone.  Great performances are plentiful here - and a number of our finest players make the most of beautifully written roles - Kathleen Chalfant, Steve Buscemi, Frances Sternhagen, Laura Linney, Christina Ricci and (my favorite) Bill Irwin.

1713979,3,B000067D0Z,"The Laramie Project was an innovative way to tell the Mathew Sheppard story. The script of the film was based on transcripts of over 200 interviews of people in Laramie, Wyoming regarding the Matthew Sheppard case.
 While I applaud the idea, the film didn't work for me. Maybe on stage the interview-transcript format is more engaging, but as a film, the whole thing feels very unauthentic and a bit boring. The sad yet interesting story of the town of Laramie and Matthew Sheppard would have probably been better served by more traditional documentary film.",1073606400,,558,4.9361702127659575
1713980,5,B000067D0Z,"Matthew Shepard's murder affected me very strongly and still does. I could have seen the stage version of this piece, as I was in New York when it was playing, but was too afraid (for the same reason, I haven't seen Boys Don't Cry). And this apparently truncated HBO version is a very tough film to watch.
It's excellent despite limitations imposed, we may assume, by the complex finances of TV. The cast is uniformly fine - I especially loved Margo Martindale, Terry Kinney (who would have given a shattering reading of Mr. Dennis Shepard's complete courtroom speech), Dylan Baker, Laura Linney, Amy Madigan and Frances Sternhagen, but everyone just GAVE so much! (I know other reviewers have carped about some of the performances, and I think it's worth pointing out that these actors donated their services to this project.)
The people of Wyoming are not treated patronizingly - the film contains, in fact, a thinly veiled indictment of the 1998 media which did sometimes treat these people as hicks. And the script, of course, is based on transcripts from interviews with these people, and like interviews with anyone, there are idiosyncracies and lapses in grammar. Of course there are rednecks - as there are in Los Angeles or even Manhattan. But the citizens of Laramie overwhelmingly recoil from this senseless tragedy, and the most horrifying character - aside from the killers, and maybe even more than them - is ""Reverend"" Fred Phelps, as he was at the time - and he's an outsider.
One person is conspicuously absent from this film, and that is Matthew Shepard. The Laramie Project is about the reaction of citizens to the brutality of his murder and the response of that city to the influx of international media attention.
During the past five years, Dennis and Judy Shepard have done incredible work to help stamp out hate crimes everywhere, and we all owe them immeasurable respect and compassion. But I bet they'd give it up in a fraction of a second to have their son back for even one hour.
As a member of the so-called gay community, I have always felt uneasy with this tendency - and the movie contributes to it - to treat Matthew Shepard primarily as a symbol and a martyr. He was a human being, and he deserved to go on being one.
Matthew Shepard was not even 22 years old when he died.",1071014400,30,2308,4.701234567901235
1713981,5,B000067D0Z,"A film that captures the sentiments of the play exquisitely, ""The Laramie Project"" is another collage-like indictment of emotion by Moises Kaufman.  All of the actors give impeccable performances of a truly well-conceived and written script.  As with ""Gross Indecency,"" in ""The Laramie Project"" Kaufman juxtaposes numerous dialogues and discourses one on top of the other.  It is incredibly well done, and compliments his documentary-esque writing style, providing a biting and personal critique of not only the inhabitants of Laramie, but, through the lens of Laramie as a microcosm for America as a whole, the entire society that America has constructed and turned a blind eye to that would allow such a senseless death.  The film, as the play, captures the raw, uncontrollable anguish that hasn't truly been provoked in queer cinema since ""Boys Don't Cry.""  A wonderful piece of art and an even more beautiful exploration of human nature, and a fitting tribute to the life of Matthew Shepard, this film is incredible.  The only true shame is that the people that NEED to learn a lesson from it will never watch it... those who do watch it are going to almost always consist of those who already agree with the sentiments it shares.  Therefore, it is preaching to the choir and isnt, in reality, an effective ""tool"" in the fight against homophobia and what some deem ""homo-hysteria"" in America.

I thought the incredible cast that did a good job with what could have easily been diluted to conventional tv movie subject matter. Very few cast members have traditionally leading roles.  The smaller one or two scene actors are just as, if not more, effective as the bigger roles.  The reactions from townspeople in Laramie were no doubt honest - regardless of which side they came down on in right/wrong of certain individuals. Laura Linney, Tom Bower, Amy Madigan and Lois Brown were real stand-outs in portraying these feelings.
Though I thought Steve Buscemi, Christina Ricca and Janeane Garafalo did fine jobs - there was nothing stellar about their performances.  And whoever thought that guy from 'Suddenly Susan' would ever work again? I found Terry Kinney's performance as Matthew Shepard's father to be forced and poorly acted - and he's great in 'Oz'.

This movie and play both tap into a part of the human spirit that I can't quite put my finger on.  I feel that anyone who has had any kind of loss or sorrow in their life cannot help but be moved and affected by this movie.  I myself have had very little, but the unbridled emotional power that arises from the words and dialogue gets me every time.  ""Go home and hug your kids, and don't let a day go by without telling them you love them.""  Just from tyipng that and having it running through my head, I almost have a tear running down my eye.

Originally written as a play, and developed using the transcripts of real interviews with the people of Laramie, Wyoming, the film version of The Laramie Project tells viewers the story of Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old gay man living in Laramie who was viciously murdered in 1998 due to his sexuality. Directed by playwright Moiss Kaufman, the movie was a hit, scoring 92% favorability with critics on Rotten Tomatoes and a 7.3/10 rating on IMDB. The Laramie Project directly contradicts Hollywoods all-too-common negative portrayals of the LGBTQ community, through its non-biased storytelling and factual recreation of the events occurring in the aftermath of Matthews death. The movie was generally received positively by LGBTQ viewers, likely due to its sensitive and realistic portrayal of LGBTQ individuals; it even inspired a number of efforts to pass hate crime legislation and tackle the ever-present issue of homophobia in U.S. society.
 The Laramie Project follows the members of the Tectonic Theater Project, a theater group from New York City, as they conduct interviews with citizens of Laramie just after Matthew Shepards murder. According to the movie, Shepard was at a bar when he was approached by two men, Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson, who proceeded to kidnap, rob, and beat him, eventually leaving him to die, tied to a fencepost in the rural outskirts of the town. Matthew Shepard was discovered the next day, unconscious, and taken to a hospital, where he died just six days later. Records show that Shepards attackers were motivated to commit such a vile assault because Matthew was an openly gay man  his sexuality is approached in many of the interviews, and is the subject is met with mixed reactions, some positive and some negative.  Although the movie initially depicts many of the towns residents as being reluctant to talk about the tragedy, the citizens eventually open up to the theater group members, displaying (in detail) their complex opinions on homosexuality, and sharing the ways in which the tragedy impacted their personal lives.
 The films presentation of LGBTQ life in Laramie was phenomenal, providing the audience with a straightforward depiction of how the topic of homosexuality was seen by the people of Laramie at the time. The honesty exhibited in the interviews translated perfectly to film, forcing viewers to think critically about their own views on homosexuality, whether they be positive or negative. While homosexuality was a key component in the film, it was not the only reason for The Laramie Projects effectiveness. Another way in which the movie excels is through its historically accurate representation of Aaron McKinney and Russell Hendersons trials. The re-enactments of both McKinney and Hendersons trials used the exact transcripts of the real-life court cases. While difficult to watch, particularly during the jurys viewing of Aaron McKinneys confession, this attention to detail was necessary in order to help make the film as effective as it was. The overall historical accuracy of The Laramie Project has been debated by some (including investigative journalist Stephen Jimenez, who claims that Shepards death was not a hate crime), but it is clear that the film accurately recounts the events that took place immediately after Shepards murder to the best of its ability.
While LGBTQ issues still remain an uncomfortable and sometimes unapproachable topic for some, I believe this movie is a step in the right direction for starting a conversation about equal rights in America. Its unbiased presentation of such a tragic incident helps make the movie an effective portrayal, rather than exploitation of pain felt by an entire community. The Laramie Project is considerate when approaching the subject of LGBTQ identities, and although many moments are tough to watch, they are necessary to include in order to effectively move audiences. There is no happy ending for anyone involved in the tragic murder of Matthew Shepard. Even though his murderers were caught and sentenced, even though Laramie became more aware of the needs of its LGBTQ residents, even though a community was brought closer together in its griefthere can never be a happy ending  and to me, that is the most important takeaway of this film. The Laramie Project does so much for its audience, but it cannot take away the pain that comes from an innocent life being taken. And this movie has succeeded in showing its audience just how powerful that pain can be.",1485043200,2,4743,5.18668407310705
7962559,5,B000067D0Z,"The Laramie Project portrays the aftermath of the Matthew Shepard murder in Laramie, through interviews with members of the community, as recorded by the NYC Tectonic Theatre Company. Religious and political leaders in Laramie, Matthews friends and acquaintances, and facility at The University of Wyoming, where Matthew attended school, all contributed their stories and viewpoints on the murder and the climate of LGBTQ tolerance in their town. In the over 200 interviews that the Tectonic Theatre Company conducted, interviewees spoke from both sides of the coin  some painting Matthew Shepard as a martyr and poster boy for hate crime in late 1990s America, and others blaming the crime on his effeminate nature.
From an LGBTQ viewpoint, the film itself does a wonderful job portraying lesbian and gay characters. Whereas early twentieth century Hollywood found itself plagued by the sissy stock character, The Laramie Project does a fantastic job giving its LGBTQ characters real depth and meaning to the plot, as opposed to being merely a colorful backdrop, defined for their sexual orientation and gender identification. In the film, the sexual orientation of the characters serves only to give context to their interview and past experiences. In fact, some of the characters aren't even clearly defined as LGBTQ until later in the film, after theyve already been an established character. And even then, their sexual orientation is made clear, as far as they have identified themselves, and not tip-toed around. Vito Russo would most certainly be hard pressed to find a flaw with the film, based purely on the portrayal of gay and lesbian characters. It helps that the film is historically accurate and uses the exact words spoken by actual people in their interviews. For example, Reggie Fluty speaks about treating her AIDS/HIV with ATZ, as opposed to the actual drug AZT. Even though the staged script of The Laramie Project clearly has it marked [sic], the creators of the movie decided to leave the mistake in Reggies interview to preserve absolute accuracy. Additionally, some of the lines weren't taken from interviews, but were extracted from the court documents and confession tapes played during Russell Hendersons and Aaron McKinneys trials, therefore preserving the integrity of every word and testimony spoken throughout the film.
The climate in Laramie, Wyoming is also portrayed thoroughly. Some interviews, like that of Matthews friend and member of the lesbian community, Romaine Patterson, show Matthews life in a positive light, praising him for his enthusiasm and overwhelming capacity for joy. Other interviews, like that of a local church official, cast Matthews lifestyle as full of sin and his murder nearly deserved. And then, some members of Laramie are somewhere in the middle: A Wyoming police officers wife speaks about all murders being hate crimes, her uneasiness about Matthews sexual orientation, and her condemnation of violent crime in the aftermath of another police officers murder, around the same time as Matthews. One of the company members talks about the political climate in the wake of the crime and the response from the federal and state legislator. As said in the film, Wyoming does very little in terms of passing anti-discrimination laws in the way of a sexual orientation basis. Also documented briefly in the film was the action taken on the federal level. Bill Clinton and his administration tried to push the Hate Crimes Prevention Act through Congress, which would broaden the definition of a hate crime to include violence against LGBTQ people, among other things. Allies to the LGBTQ community popped up all over the globe, in major city vigils for Matthew, in the brief time between his beating and his death. This development wasn't documented to its full extent in The Laramie Project film, but was included in the staged version of the show.
While Matthew Shepard was the original pull for LGBTQ involvement in the movie, and the reason for the project itself, he obviously wasn't a featured character because had died by the time the interviews started taking place. However, interviews with other Wyoming Queers, as Doc OConnor puts it, are spread throughout the film. The acting portrayal of these characters is of great quality. This review has already touched on some of the factors that made these portrayals appropriate to an LGBTQ audience, but its also important to note the wide range of gay and lesbian characters presented. Each character shows a deep back story and past beyond just being a gay Wyoming rancher or a lesbian friend of Matthews. Even the LGBTQ Tectonic Theatre Company members have very real and raw emotion and story in the film. One of the most realistic and heart wrenching moments in the movie is when Amanda Gronich, a lesbian member of the company, takes the interview of an anti-gay religious leader, outside of a diner. Her reaction to his words and the following confrontation with Moises Kaufman was one of the most human interactions of the film.
The Laramie Project does an exceptional job at portraying LGBTQ people accurately and appropriately. In addition, the film maintains absolute historical accuracy. While the film may have been able to include more relevance through the inclusion of state and federal struggle, in regards to hate crime legislation, it can be argued that the true point of the film is not to analyze the countrys views towards LGBTQ people in the late 1990s (although references to Laramie being a temperature taker for the nation are alluded to), but instead tells the tale of a town dealing with morals and internal conflict that they uncover in the light of murder and hate. In that regard, the film is fantastic snapshot of a moment in time that is pivotal to Americas understanding of what a hate crime is.",1485043200,,5846,5.108672936259143

I recommend this and to show it to young people who perhaps have never been told the story.  It's important we keep the story alive.  Hate is hate, regardless of sexual preference.",1475712000,2,352,4.102941176470588
