8575440,3,B00BY8DAXG,"In 1935, Dick Powell was loaned by Warner Brothers to 20th Century Fox for ""Thanks a Million"" offering Powell a better role than the singing saps he endured at Warners. The film was in fact a Darryl F. Zanuck 20th Century production and one of the first films released under the new banner of 20th Century Fox. It is a very entertaining political satire.

Powell is part of a musical troupe managed by Fred Allen, of the sarcastic put downs. The troupe are stranded in a small town and become a supporting act for an alcoholic judge running for State Governor, played very well by Raymond Walburn. The complications of the plot have some pertinent things to say about corruption and the stupidity of the voters; without the music, the screenplay would survive happily. But this is a musical and all the numbers are delightful. Leading lady Ann Dvorak, also on loan out from Warners, and Patsy Kelly have 2 simple numbers. Powell has 2 outstanding songs with a quartet called ""The Yacht Club Boys"" who wrote their own material. The orchestration and harmonising are terrific, receiving an Oscar nomination at the time. The title song became a big hit. Violinist Rubinoff is also on hand and his opening number in the bus is a standout. As if that was not enough, Paul Whiteman performs a number with vocalist Ramona who accompanies herself on the piano. The lighting for this number is stunning.

The print is unrestored but adequate. The Fox Cinema Archives series are bare bones, with no extras, no scene selection, no nothing. They are expensive too but if you can afford it, don't miss this one - a four star film in a 1 star package.",1375228800,3,1637,4.660899653979238
