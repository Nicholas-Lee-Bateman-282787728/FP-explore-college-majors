8463985,4,B004V706LG,The description said English but im not too picky so this would be 5 stars but the buggy was that there are NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES.  It is a beautiful bluray. Crisp picture and sound.  Also a cool collectors type set with pictures and an audio CD.  But I don't know Japanese so the no subtitles thing kinda ruins it for me.,1370390400,,321,4.229508196721311
