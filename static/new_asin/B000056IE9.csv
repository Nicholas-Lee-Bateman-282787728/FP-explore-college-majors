And oh my goodness, my toddler (2.5 yrs) absolutely LOVED it right away!  We've since collected many Maisy videos and 'Maisy Springtime' is definitely a favorite.  Sweet, adorable, fun & simple with great teaching for lil ones.  I will say, if you already have 'Count with Maisy' with the train on the cover, this 'Maisy Springtime' has many of the same songs.  This is NOT a problem for my lil guy as they are all his favorite songs like 'Oats & Beans & Barley'; 'I like trucks'; and 'Itty Bitty Bug Song'.  Springtime is all about animals on the farm like cows, chickens, birds & cats.  Supercute, one of Maisy's best!",1346284800,,727,4.462121212121212

7932116,5,B000056IE9,"Maisy is a longtime favorite with our 3-year-old. She has several of the books as well as this video. She loves the mess the pigs make on the farm. She learned to imitate the animals from the farm sequence, colors from the Egg hunt, to count from the Bird short, and the Cat short helps prepare her for bedtime.  A good companion video to  ""Maisy's Springtime"" would be ""Maisy's Bedtime"".",1025222400,6,388,4.5285714285714285
7932117,1,B000056IE9,"My daughter Imogen is 16 months and we have recently found the maisy Mouse collection. Imogen loves them, we have four videos, a bag, a maisy mouse soft toy, candy and lots more. She is absolutely captivated by the videos, she comes down in the morning now and finds the TV remote control to turn on Maisy, she will then sit and watch a whole video, doing the Maisy Mouse dance to the music. In these times it is great to find such a well conceived childrens character and it is nice to know that the videos have such a good educational content. I was thrilled when I did a search of the Amozon site to find that there were so many other videos, books and toys to buy for her. We are, in our house, devoted Maisy Mouse fans and my husband James has been heard humming the Maisy Mouse theme tunes to himself. WELL DONE!!",998092800,,819,4.222929936305732
