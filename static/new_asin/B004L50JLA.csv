8433836,4,B004L50JLA,"This is truly a very good series (if short) about the discoveries made and the images from the Hubble Space Telescope. But while the DVD set is decent enough why have the producers not made a Blu-ray version available? This series was originally shown (and continues to be shown) on Oasis HD, a high-definition specialty television channel. If any material deserved high definition it is the spectacular images from Hubble. This would have been a five star rating if I had been reviewing the (currently non-existent) HD version.",1387411200,,528,5.011363636363637
8433837,4,B004L50JLA,"I liked this because of the great images, the naration was good and informational. Ivan did a good job explaining the science and the images are first rate! I gave this a rating of four because this is geared more towards a younger audience but I think space enthusiasts will enjoy it as well.",1363392000,,293,4.444444444444445
