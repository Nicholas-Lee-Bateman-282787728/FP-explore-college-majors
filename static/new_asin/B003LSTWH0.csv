4153683,4,B003LSTWH0,"I enjoyed this movie. It was definitely an improvement from the movie version of ""I Can Do Bad All By Myself"", however I did feel somewhat disappointed when I left the theatre.

There were two things I didn't like about the movie. The first one is Troy's storyline (Sheila's husband) about being unemployed was too similar to the Lem character in ""Soul Food"" and the second thing I didn't like was the ending.

I don't want to give the movie away for those of you who haven't seen it yet, so I'll just say the wrong character was chosen for that particular scene. Maybe after you've seen it, you'll agree. Maybe, you won't but I've dealt with something similar and it takes a lot longer than a year to bounce back from that.

I do know that all movies don't have a happy ending but that whole scene should have been re-written so that the movie could have ended on a high note.

Overall, it was a very entertaining movie and I enjoyed it. I just didn't like the ending, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Also, Janet Jackson acted her heiny off. She has definitely come a long way from ""Poetic Justice."" All of them did a great job acting but Janet was the centerpiece. Hats off to you, Janet!

Keep up the good work, Tyler! Still a fan and still in your corner.",1270166400,5,1272,4.283333333333333
4153684,5,B003LSTWH0,"Gathered together in the Bahamas for their annual one-week reunion, four close couples eagerly reconnect, sharing news about their lives and relationships. But their intimate week in paradise is disrupted by the unexpected arrival of Sheila's ex-husband, Mike, who hopes to break up her new marriage with Troy and win her back. The others soon realize they too are not immune to the challenges of commitment and fidelity. Angela doesn't believe her husband, Marcus, can be faithful now that he's a celebrity television newscaster. Dianne and Terry's relationship is feeling the strain of raising children. And Patricia, a successful self-help psychologist, must finally reveal the deep flaws in her seemingly perfect marriage to Gavin. With their relationships hanging in the balance when they return home, each couple must choose between blame and forgiveness, doubt and faith, with life-altering consequences.

The truth of the matter is that I have mixed feelings about this movie. Am I glad I saw it? Yes! This is one movie I wouldn't mind seeing again (if only to watch Shelia). Did I expect something different? Yes and no. Did I enjoy the movie? Yes, I'd have to say that I did.  The truth is that it is just a different type of movie. The first movie examined how individuals dealt with the problems in their marriages; the good, the bad and the ugly. And in the first movie, they all had better relationships and a greater understanding of each other as people. Now, the second movie addresses what happens when a relationship breaks down (literally) and how we as human beings learn to cope with the change, hardships and difficulties. See, not bad, but different.

I feel the mark of a good movie is when you forget you are watching it, and you get drawn into the story. And let me assure you that this will happen. I will admit that this movie had a lot packed into it, but it gives you a fresh look on how these characters have changed, or not changed, over the three years since the first movie. It is a very emotional ride at times, but it all pays off when Shelia embarrasses Marcus, or when Troy stands up for his wife, and Janet's character really shows her other side.

The location for the reunion was absolutely beautiful, and get to see the conversations between the men and the women (in individual groups) and then see how the stories match up as the movie continues beyond the weekend get-a-way. There really is no need to describe the story any further because each person will experience it differently. Personally, I thought the movie began a bit slowly, however when it got to the end, I was happy for the slow parts it gave me time to catch up. Overall: if you like Tyler Perry movies, you should see this movie. It is worth the ride, very enjoyable.",1270166400,47,2780,4.7139917695473255

4153712,1,B003LSTWH0,"There isn't much I can say at this point that hasn't already been said. I just did not enjoy this movie as much as I did the first one. I watched them back-to-back just to make sure I was being fair, and my first conclusion about this one was correct. Tyler Perry practically rewrote and changed everybody's characters, and not for the BETTER, I might add. This movie was the polar opposite to the first film in every way. The first one was funny and lighthearted despite the subject matter. This time around the entire mood was changed for everybody! If you watch them one right after the other you can tell that this movie is a whole lot darker than the first.

For starters, EVERYBODY'S acting was horrible. They destroyed Patricia and Gavin! I get the point he (Tyler Perry) was trying to make in showing how nasty things can get when you have two people fighting over money, but he went about this the wrong way. In the first film Gavin and Patricia had their problems, but they LOVED each other first and foremost. I never would have thought Patricia would have brought a ""Queen"" to jump out of a cake at Gavin's job embarrassing him like that. It was childish and so UNLIKE Patricia. To hound the man until he wrecks trying to get away from her was just unbelievable. Patricia didn't even look the same in this film. They changed her from a level-headed professional woman to a psycho. She looked absolutely miserable up until the end where she was staring at The Rock like she could eat him alive. So much for Gavin, huh?  I know Janet Jackson had her own personal issues at the time, but this role overhaul was a mistake.

He (Tyler Perry) ruined Sheila, Troy, and Mike. Troy went from this handsome guy, with a great smile, who made Sheila feel so good about herself in the first film it was amazing. What happened? He was angry the entire movie! He barely smiled! His attitude was terrible! I get he was stressed after their move from Colorado, but he just wasn't the same man. They tried to make people feel sorry for Mike by giving him cancer, but Sheila was just plain stupid in this movie. She knew better than to go to her ex-husband, whom her current husband despised, to ask him to help get her husband a job. Did she think that he would THANK her for that? On top of that, there was no way that she could justify to her husband WHY she was in her ex-husband's house taking care of him while she thought her husband was at work only for him to come by and catch her there. I don't care what the circumstances were. That was plain disrespectful! SHE WAS WRONG! If that's not enough, they didn't even bother explaining what the hell happened to Trina.

Again, I get where he (Tyler Perry) was going in showing that you have to be careful how you treat people because you never know who you may need to take care of you in the end. Another message he went about the wrong way, but I got it. I just didn't like it being at the expense of my two favorite characters from the first movie. I lost a tremendous amount of respect for Sheila. Troy, I could understand his position more than Sheila.

He also ruined Angela and Marcus too. Angela went from being witty and funny in the first one to obnoxious and annoying. That was some horrible acting by Tasha Smith and Michael Jai White. I'm used to Tasha playing hood roles, which usually works in her favor, but the way she was acting in the airport... IMMATURE AND CHILDISH! The way she was acting when she crashed his job on national television making herself look like a fool... INEXCUSABLE! That was not funny in the least!

Needless to say, I was not pleased with this movie. I don't know why he changed everybody and made them the opposite of everything they were in the first film. NOT A GOOD LOOK!!",1480291200,,3767,4.397417503586801

Nothing gets by her and she takes care of business! Now if she could just stay out of trouble with the police!)",1431734400,,502,4.467391304347826
4153800,1,B003LSTWH0,"I LOVED the original ""Tyler Perry's Why Did I Get Married?"" It was thoughtful and funny, it showed what felt like real struggles in relationships and friendships. The characters had real flaws and real reasons to love them. The sequel I'm reviewing here was a painful caricature. The plot was led by two characters that made a complete departure (for no reason you could really understand) from who they were in the first film. By the end, I didn't like any of the characters anymore. The issues felt contrived and bordered on the ridiculous. Even the few genuine and authentic situations someone could relate to were thrown off by the high drama of the rest of it. If you loved the first movie, DO NOT watch this one, it ruins it.",1431302400,3,731,4.587786259541985

People who say that this movie was ""over the top"" have never known people who have went through the types of situations that the characters have. For me, everything seem completely plausible and on point with real life. Maybe that means my life and the people in it are filled with drama but what's life without a little drama?

This movie and the end of this movie was a wonderfully delicious surprise and I hope that there is a third one of these as it opened so many new questions.",1430006400,,540,4.346534653465347

All the performances were good, especially Janet's (considering what she had to endure with MJ and all), but still a great performance.
Most people had a problem with the ending. I agree it was a little rushed but whatever. As for the cameo at the end? SOOO EXCITED and I'm a dude lol. This is why I'm aching for TP to make the inevitable third and final chapter. Come on, TP...! lol Good movie... :)",1401494400,,674,4.357142857142857

4153874,5,B003LSTWH0,"This movie has correctly portrayed issues arising in many marriage, such as lack of trust, infidelity and reality check relationship. We can easily see how men exploit their wives while they are breaking wedding vows, we can also see how educated women exploit their husbands by not being wives enough because of their profession, sex is tabou for them, kids a burden for their dream, they spend more time lusting on their boss at work than their husbands at home, we can also see how marriage is not what it should be where there is not transparency in handling money. Most people, I think are more married than their money, their possessions remains single. As a devoted Christian, I think this movie should consider as a wake up call for couple who should not think that calling my spouse ""honey""is all it takes to be married, not at all, it take sharing your life, your possession and your body.",1399420800,,899,4.660377358490566

4153897,3,B003LSTWH0,"Really it's more like a 2 star movie, but I am giving it 3 because I suspect someone coming into this film knows what type of movies Tyler Perry makes and so there is a certain level of acceptance of melodrama, cliches, etc.

I consider TP movies to be the cinematic form of junk food: I know it's processed, and it's not the best quality, but damn I like to lay on my couch on a lazy Saturday and consume it.

In this case, the movie kind of left me with a tummy ache :/

The characters were even more over the top and cliched than usual, but I could have tolerated that.

The ending: what the heck was that? I mean it was such a lazily slapped together shock value ending with a lack of clear resolution. I am sorry, but slapping Dwayne Johnson in for 25 seconds at the end does not make up for the major WTF ending. In fact, it only speaks to the laziness of the writing as there seemed to be no real time taken to make sense of what happened.

That being said, just like when ones eats too many sprinkles, I should have known better. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, it had all the drama I liked in a TP movie, I just wish he exhibited more discipline when writing this.",1384819200,3,1175,4.11353711790393

These couples have their fair share of issues and are always there for one another. They support and help eachother through the good and the bad.

enjoy listening to lots of emotionally violent arguments...
like seeing married people shoot daggers at one another as a way of life...
find it entertaining to observe people who know nothing about emotional or physical boundaries...
have a nervous system which is not over-taxed by incessant negativity...
define ""entertainment"" as being yanked from catastrophe to catastrophe...
have no expectation that relationship insights will be offered in a movie about relationships...
think it's normal for so-called professionals to have only destructive coping skills when faced with conflict...
value seeing movie characters reduced to two-dimensional caricatures...
are OK with the fact that the plot seems so loosely strung together, there's hardly a story...
then you'll surely like this movie.

I did paperwork while it was on, but was hardly motivated to keep my eyes on the screen.  Several times I had to significantly lower the volume, because the negativity was really getting on my nerves.  There was nothing satisfying about the ending, either (which I had foolishly hoped for, because then the time spent on the movie might have added up to something).

This movie has nothing to do with the Tyler Perry abilities I've seen elsewhere. (Did he maybe hand the script to a porn flick director (?), because that's pretty much the level of ""drama"" offered in this production.)

4153973,5,B003LSTWH0,Another excellent Tyler Perry movie a must see. Struggles that couples face and how they handle the situations that come their way. How if you don't have trust in a marriage makes you very suspicious of everything. What could happen to a marriage after losing a child if you don't deal with it when it happens. What happens when you don't appreciate each other and they start to turn to someone else. This does have a sad moments and laughter as well.,1336435200,,451,4.512195121951219

This movie ended like a horror movie. It is a terrible example for any Black women who might be watching. That kind of aggressive, sadistic behavior is what you might read in the news, not in a romantic comedy or drama or whatever this melodrama was supposed to be.
  I hope Black women do not watch this movie and think this movie ending was okay because it was quite sinister. The Black men also seem unusually weak while the Black women appear dominant. No man really wants a loud mouthed, dominant woman, no matter what Tyler Perry says. This movie gave me nightmares.",1325030400,19,759,4.453237410071942

I seriously could not believe this movie and truly wanted to stop watching, but like witnessing a train wreck, I could not pull myself away. Honestly, after the first movie that seemed to end with some redeeming qualities about marriage, I thought this one would continue in the same vein, but this was just a marriage basher. After watching this, why would anyone think marriage is a good thing? Two couples have major trust issues, another one  has a wife on the verge of an affair, and the last one, the Janet Jackson marriage is beyond awful.

4153996,1,B003LSTWH0,"After watching I can do bad all by myself, I never thought things could get worse but I stand corrected.  Next came the sequel to 'Why did I get married'.  Admittedly, I loved the first movie so I was looking forward to seeing the second and boy was I disappointed.  Key things:

1. Character development - All the relationships all seemed to go wrong, especially the Gavin and Stacey marriage which seemed to be standing on solid rock from the last movie.  Watched this movie and came out not really understanding why?  Why would such a solid relationship that seemed to be healing from the first movie suddenley end up being so catastrophic in the end?

2. Angela - This character just ended up being the stereotypical loud, black woman.  To be honest, this character took a life of its own and became unrealistic and mellodramatic.....it's a shame that the screen writer and director of this film did not realize when to press the stop button on the crazy.  Plus no brother like Marcus would ever stay with any woman with that much crazy in her.

This movie is nothing short of intellectually insulting.

Tyler should stay away from writing movies as what is clear is that his talent is better placed in the Chitlin circuit...or at least he should go to film school, it would definitely help.",1303257600,8,1295,4.635964912280702

4153998,5,B003LSTWH0,"Tyler Perry is a blessing and a genius. This movie had everything: laughter; tears; exhileration, education , etc , etc. Janet Jackson came out as an actress in this movie. This is her ""coming out/stepping up"" movie. She did a good job in the first insatllment. She did good in the movie with Eddie Murphy. She had an Oscar nomination worthy performance in this movie. I did not know she had it in her. Everyone else played their parts to perfection, but Janet shines. And I am speaking as someone who has not been a great fan of her acting skills. Janet stretched from every end of the acting spectrum. Jill Scott has become as good an actres as she is a singer. Her character has gained strength , while still vulernable from past pain. She grounds her feet to walk with her new husband, while establishing lines of emotional defense, so as not to be hurt that way again. The test of her ex on h er marriage was done to perfection, with the surprise of his situation at the end making us all turn hate to compassion. Marcus and his crazy wife, Angela, per the first film, provided so much laughter. Whatever fans of Perry were looking for from him, we got it. Whatevery your definition is of marriage and it's trials  were found in this movie, with the exception of a spiritual angle. This movie did not fail with any of my expectations. It reached all goals, which is why I gave it  5 stars. Not that it was Schindler's List, but it was an original sequel that kept my eyes on the screen, waiting for the next comedic, dramatic, heart wrenching moment. There were plenty of characters to root for, get mad at and be surprised at. This movie has it all; a rare sequel that tops the original. Perry reached for the stars  with this one. After watching, the stars are in his rearview mirror. Pery does it again with ""Too"". This ""Too"" takes second to none. It is No. 1 with me.",1299283200,,1876,4.385057471264368

4154000,3,B003LSTWH0,"Taking place 3 years after the original, Why Did I Get Married Too? finds the same group of college friends on a week long retreat to discuss and improve their relationship/marital issues. Terry (Tyler Perry) and Diane (Sharon Leal) seem to have bounced back from their previous issues and are devoted parents to their young son and daughter. The loudly overdramatic Angela (Tasha Smith) and Marcus (Michael Jae White) are still fighting, although he's gotten a job as a sportscaster and finally has his act together. Angela is still obsessed with the idea that he's cheating and her irate behind screams out her suspicions to anyone who'll listen. After divorcing her abusive ex-husband Mike (Richard T. Jones), Sheila (Jill Scott) is now married to the more loving sheriff Troy (Lamann Rucker) and the two now have a baby boy. Last but not least are author/professor Patricia (Janet Jackson) and Gavin (Malik Yoba), married for 14 years and viewed as a model for the ""perfect couple"" (of course there's no such thing) among their friends.

Instead of going back to Colorado, the gang vacays at a lush Bahamas resort that seems like heaven on earth. Unfortunately, paradise gets ugly with the unexpected arrival of Mike. The unworthy fool wants Sheila back, but girlfriend's havin' none of it! She's not the passive doormat she once was and has no fear in standing up for herself. To make matters worse, Patricia announces to the group that she and Gavin are getting a divorce.

Much like the first film, the ish really hits the fan once everyone goes back home. The civility between Patricia and Gavin crumbles once Gavin stakes claim to the money made from her books. Pat's not going down without a fight and things get beyond nasty. Terry suspects his wife of infidelity, a deal between Sheila and Mike threatens to destroy her marriage to Troy, and Angela's antics get even more out of control. Can these couples get it together or will the drama do them in for good?

Before I go into the cons, I have to talk about Janet's performance. While the original showcased Jill's impressive acting chops, the sequel is clearly Ms. Jackson's and she shuts it DOWN! Especially once Pat drops her icy ""keep it together although everything's falling apart"" facade and loses her mind. ""YOU WANT CRAZY?! I'LL SHOW YOU CRAZY!!!!"" Her big brother Mike passed away in the middle of shooting and it's clear that the intense scenes were cathartic for her. The pain, anger, and sadness shine through and are at times hard to watch.

Now to the not so good things. Way too heavy on the melodrama for my taste. The strength of the first Married was how relatable and believable the issues were and how they were dealt with. This time around it seems like Tyler Perry had more drama than he knew what to do with and didn't know how to go about mending things in a believable way. The scene at the hospital was a poor attempt, I'm afraid. Angela and Marcus' fights were obviously used for comic relief, but didn't we go through all this in the first movie? It's such a retread and a time filler imo.

Despite the disappointments, the movie wasn't a total failure. The other cast members did well with their performances and I love Janet's ballad Nothing that's played as a short instrumental throughout the film and heard in full during the credits. The lyrics pull from the story (""Tell me what could the problem be, that's got you drinking way too much"" .... ""You can even have the password to my phone"") and calls for a significant other to drop all ""jealousy or insecurities"" and know that nothing that come between them. Beautiful. In closing, Married Too isn't as good as the first, but it has it moments. Check it out.",1298937600,3,3708,4.707241910631741

4154006,4,B003LSTWH0,"After watching the first movie ""Why Did I Get Married"", I really wanted to see where they go from here, have the characters resolved the issues or at the least learnt to deal with them. What about forgiveness - no marriage can survive unless the partners learn to forgive each other for their mistakes and move on. And what about trust, can we truly trust those in our lives and know that no matter what we can depend on them and trust them to be true to us?

I enjoyed watching this movie, I have to say the outcome was completely not what I expected, but it was good to see them deal with issues that brought them to where they are. Issues that can bring healing and closure!",1294963200,,677,4.248062015503876

There were so many layers and dimensions to the characters in this movie. A deep story but with the usual fun and ""keeping it real"" vibe Tyler Perry has in all his stories. I picked up a lot of ""what to do and what not to do in a marriage"" in this movie and I appreciate that a lot.

A few parts or scenes were almost predictable but still essential to the movie as a whole.

I fell in love with the set design as well. The end of this movie lends itself to a third movie, I dare say.",1294617600,,600,3.792

(Full Screen Edition)</a>What an excellent sequel and follow up to the first movie! We watched this film with a group of friends and it was a really good film to watch with a group of people over the Christmas. The story is quite good and an interesting look at four to five different marriages with their different struggles and triumphs. There was also a surprise twist in the film that kind of caught us off guard. The fact that the film does not actually offer any direct message/advice as to how to make your marriage better, but rather, how to navigate and handle your own marriage problems without comparing yourself to others, was simply brilliant!!! This film is recommended to all married people and those that plan to get married. One final thing, the film shows quite well that what a lot of people think make a marriage work well, such as; lots of money, good status, fantastic job etc., are not in themselves rock-solid, but really life together with each other filled with love is the greatest gift you can ever truly have in a marriage; everything else is a great bonus or a side attraction.",1293926400,,1291,5.271844660194175

Once again, Tyler brought up many hard hitting topics in which married couples face and subtly suggested that refraining from the easiest choice to each problem may be the wisest response. I will say that this movie did have a turn of events in the nearing the end which made one ponder over the Biblical verse: 'Do not let the sun go down on your anger.' I felt the 'year later' segment seemed alittle too 'quick,' but I will not give any more away.

4154021,3,B003LSTWH0,"Tyler Perry has been films about marital problems and women struggling to find a foothold (mostly African American)for several years, these films have been successful and have found a niche audience. Mostly his films are very well made and have good plotlines. WDIGM2 is a sequel to WDIGM and supposedly tries to move the story forward. At the heart of the story is Patricia (Janet Jackson) and her suffering husband Gavin (Malik Yoba). Terry ( Tyler Perry)  who suspects his wife Diane (Sharon Leal) is cheating on him, Angela (Tasha Smith) is convinced her husband Marcus (Michael Jai White), is cheating on her. Sheila (Jill Scott) is now married to former sheriff Troy (Lamman Rucker), having relocated cannot find a job. These suffering couples meet at a marriage retreat in the Bahamas (so lovingly captured ) to reflect on their marriages. Trouble starts when Mike (Richard T Jones), Jill Scotts ex husband arrives. The film follows these couples and their imploding marriages. The actors do a decent job and Janet Jackson is an improvement. Tyler Perry directs and once again does a decent job in making this very predictable tale interesting partly because he is skilled in his craft. Production values are superb but I wish that they had concentrated on the script a tad bit more. On the whole, I enjoyed the movie and yes, there is going to be a sequel.

My heart went out to Patty and Gavin(Janet Jackson and Malik Yoba)as well as Richard T. Jones(talk about karma) and Brian(Michael Jai White) because to be honest he couldn't catch a break coming or going although Angela kept you laughing here she really did.

This film really gives African American womem a bad look, NO we are not all loud and bitchy and complaining and upset with our men, being insecure about them. After seeing this film I then looked back at the other movies he made and it seems all the ladies in them have these big hangups and issues about themselves, they enver been loved, then been abused or mistreated or in a previous relationship with some dude who didn't treat them right so now they are just mean to every man that approaches them.  But at the end of the flick he may throw in a Bible verse and all should be well.

When does the movie come out about a happy couple that gets along and makes each other laugh and have some fun.  Relationships are hard and if you want it to work you have to work hard at it.  If not, then leave.  There should be no yelling and cussing and screaming.  I mean grow up already!  Where is the positive, where is the love, I don't see any here, just people not communicating, not supporting each other, accusing each other of stupid stuff and then one big happy ending.

I may have to re-think his films from now on if they re all going to be like this.  In the black community sure we have our issues but not every damn one is like this, some of us are actually happy.",1285200000,11,1368,4.167300380228137

Just because you are married doesn't mean you can't have privacy...it's called TRUST!!  Husbands, wives, and couples in a committed relationship should stay out of each others purses, wallets, and electronic devices.  I'm married and my husband NEVER answers my phone.

4154041,1,B003LSTWH0,"I give this movie 1 star it would have gotten half a star but that is not an option.

Tyler Perry's first problem was relying on Janet Jackson to carry the film. She is not the greatest actress in the world and I understand that her brother Michael Jackson died while she made this movie, but still shouldn't have relied on her. Her performance was better in this film than the previous but not by much. In the first film each couple had equal problems and shared equal screen time developing what caused the problems in their marriages. In this film only Patricia/Gavin and Angela/Marcus stories were really developed. The other two couples Troy/Sheila/Mike & Diane/Terry fell flat and not developed like the other two couples.

Angela & Marcus: This story was a little inconsistent, Angela blamed Marcus for catching VD when it was her who got VD first. Angela is checking pulse beats, mileage, and how many miles from point A to point B just proves she is too insecure and why is she in the marriage in the first place. She was the one who cheated first from the first film, yet she is harping on Marcus, first she got on to him in the first film for not having a job and now that he has one that pays well she is still unhappy. I don't get it. She needs to go drink herself into kidney failure. Why didn't Marcus call Angela out on her catching venereal disease first, he had to sit there and take her constant verbal abuse. Should have told her to take a midol and shut her loud, obnoxious ass up. She pulls a Patricia and embarrasses him at his job, could have gotten him fired, and she would complain again how he has no job and how it's his fault he got fired.

Patricia & Gavin: I guess since Gavin was going to be killed off, he tried to turn him into an ass, didn't work on me. The only wrong he did was burn the baby photos in a drunken stupor. Patricia gives out advice but can't take her own damn advice, did she sit there and write a pro and con list about Gavin since she told Diane and Angela to do that in the first film....hell no she didn't. How the hell can Patricia write a book about marriage and hers was falling apart. Then she announces the divorce in front of her friends without telling Gavin first, just blind sided him with that bit of important news. Patricia keeps everything bottled in and doesn't discuss anything with her husband and you could tell by Gavin's face that he just looked tired. She takes things too far and goes and embarrass the man at his job by having a gay man pop out of a wedding cake and playing ""It's Raining Men."" Sorry but Patricia was being a real bitch with issues. Sorry, wouldn't accept any marriage advice from Patricia yet alone read any of her books. Tyler relied on this story to carry the film but Jackson's acting was a no and all her lines were repeated over and over, sometimes in the same scene, she couldn't say anything else but repeat herself.

Terry & Diane: This story was the worst throughout the whole film. Diane is all happy and cheerful because she is having an emotional affair with a co-worker. It was never explained why she leaned on this co-worker and not her husband. It seemed that Terry tried everything to spend time with her and this and that. This story fell flat big time.

Sheila & Troy: Another underdeveloped story and a cop out. Why was it hard for Troy to get a job working in law enforcement, he has credentials when he was in Colorado. Then pull a Soul Food scene and have Sheila ask her ex-husband to get her current husband a job. Sheila asks the man that abused her both physically and emotionally to get her current husband a job, that makes no sense whatsoever and definitely a wtf moment. The story should have resolved around Troy adjusting the move from the North to the South and trying to fit in with Sheila's friends, since he left everything in Colorado. Mike having cancer was the biggest cop out I've ever seen.

Towards the end in the hospital was just dumb, Patricia telling everyone to fix their problems. Sorry dear, your marriage is screwed and not going to fix anything just cause you say so. One couple were dealing with issues that needed longer to heal that being Terry & Diane dealing with Diane's emotional cheating, cause that's a big thing. The ending was just horrible, yea The Rock makes a cameo, now he's going to be a witness to Patricia's bitchiness so he better get out while he can. She writes a book on healing, healing from what her selfish stank attitude, that caused Gavin to dive head first into traffic. Gavin's death wasn't believable because the driver hit Gavin's passenger side and his car wasn't that damaged. She caused two people in her life to die because of her selfishness. Her son because she was in a mad dash from rain water (seriously) to strap her son securely in a car seat. What if the water touched her was she going to melt, might as well since she is such a witch. Then her husband Gavin all over money saying he didn't contribute or write. Patricia obviously lost some damn brain cells because in the first film she writes her books solely on the couples retreat she goes to with her friends and isn't Gavin part of the retreat, she sure as hell doesn't go by herself. I just do not like Patricia. Now she kill Rock if she wants to, I'm punch her in the face and she can write a book on that.

This film was just a big letdown.",1283817600,39,5389,4.383

So when the sequel arrived, I was excited to see what had 'become' of them? Had Angela and Marcus finally worked their issues out? Would all the characters be happier as it seemed they were at the end of the first movie?

**Spoilers**

The movie opens and you get the backdrop that the couples are going on their annual retreat but this time to the Bahamas. A lot has changed. Children have been introduced and strains have been added to other marriages.

What I had enjoyed about the first flick was the 'bond' between the couples as well as their bonds as girlfriends and guy friends.

In the second film, each character seemed to have changed and left a different feel to the film. The same actors were used but you could sense that they all were somehow not the same.

It's a movie I would watch again to see if I missed something in the theatre.. but I'm not sure I'd own this sequel.",1283126400,,1077,4.306930693069307

For one the intense comic relief along with the supercharged drama doesn't blend well for me (i.e. Madea Goes to Jail - the movie) The plot was all too predictable, ex wants the ex back, hubby and wife aren't happy, they argue and tragically one dies..meehhhh.... oh, let's not mention, one has cancer and it's not addressed at all other than when it's mentioned..It just seemed like a mash up of a bunch of recycled movie plots, all put together crudely.

I am so glad that Tyler Perry makes movies that people of color can relate to.  As someone who never made it through an episode of ""Friends"", ""Seinfield""  or some of those otherwise ""popular"" shows, it is refreshing for me to see entertainment that speaks to me.

Some critics want to bash Tyler for not depicting his characters exactly as they think they should be portrayed.  They try to compare his work to so-called mainstream writers and directors.  And they nit-pick the heck out of every detail of his movies saying they aren't factual.  But these same critics give accolades to movies like ""Knocked Up"" and ""The Hangover"" and other stupid, who-gives-a-damn-about-real-life type of movies. Movies ARE supposed to be entertaining and fun, not trashy and moronic.

And speaking of entertainment, for those who critique his movies as not being factual, keep in mind they are MOVIES NOT DOCUMENTARIES.  If you're so hard up for facts, stay home and watch The Learning Channel and The Discovery Channel.

4154055,3,B003LSTWH0,"""Why Did I Get Married Too"" reunites the four couples again for their annual marriage retreat, this time in the Bahamas. It's pretty much the same scenario and plot from the first installment, but this time it's just not that interesting to watch. Sheila's ex-husband shows up alone and unexpectedly to the retreat just to ""diss"" Troy (Sheila's new hubby) and make everyone uncomfortable. Angela is talking trash once again, and provides the most laughable moments. Lou Gossett, Jr. and Cicely Tyson have a cameo appearance as an elderly couple who still love each other after years of marriage. Their story provides probably the only endearing moment of the entire film.

Then there's the usual dialogue about marriage - the guy talk, the girl talk, some drinks, some jokes, some insults and then when the couples return home, that's when all of the trouble begins. I won't go into all of the details, but it's just not plausible that four couples, who are friends, would have so much extreme drama going on in their lives at the same time. This movie was just drama for the sake of drama, and it added nothing to the first ""Why Did I Get Married?"" which was an excellent movie. I don't know why Tyler Perry even bothered to make a sequel other than to perhaps keep Malik Yoba employed and to show that Janet's acting skills have slightly improved.

Like everyone else, I love Tasha Smith's ""Angela"" character, but she was just way over the top this time. (No man would stay married to a woman who clowns like that in public ALL THE TIME.) The ending was completely unnecessary, considering that this was supposed to be a ""romantic comedy"". It's obvious that TP didn't really know how to end the movie, so he kept piling on more & more drama until he finally ran out of ideas. (For example, showing up clowning on someone's job just to embarrass them after you've already smashed up the crib? Was this necessary?) I was exhausted after the movie ended. Just way too much melodrama within a 2-hour period. Hopefully, there won't be a ""Why Did I Get Married 3?"" (or ""Why Did I Get Married Again?""), but somehow (unfortunately) I think there will be one.",1275091200,38,2152,4.660526315789474
4154056,1,B003LSTWH0,"The first installment in this series was decent enough to spark my interest in checking out the sequel. Unfortunately, Why Did I Get Married Too was a sub-par attempt to reprise Perry's previous venture in couples therapy. There were a few redeemable aspects of the movie, namely, some of the characters have been further developed. The new aspects of their relationship dynamics made it interesting to see how their lives have changed. Also appreciated are the moments of bare sincerity in the dialogue. There are a few scenes where a husband and wife could be seen having a believable, vulnerable discussion about the impact of individual choices on their relationship without the bravado of over-the-top displays.

Sadly, any redeemable parts of this film were heavily flanked in overwrought dramatic scenes in an effort to create meaningful turning points, and mostly uncomfortable attempts at humor. It's as if Perry thought that hearty laughter from the characters in the more comedic scenes would somehow make the scene funnier; the mission was not accomplished. Also, Perry decided to have the movie be more dependent on Janet Jackson's character as the center pin of the plot, which is an unfortunate shift because she simply doesn't have the skills to deliver. While she is more highly emotive throughout this film, she isn't believable. It just left you feeling uncomfortable watching it happen. To make matters worst, the scene transitions felt abrupt, like you were being yanked by the collar from one end of a room to another.

On a more pitiful note, there were several lines and scenes that were way too close to those from the movies Boomerang, Soul Food, and Unfaithful. It's one thing to have a trite storyline; it's a whole other issue when scenes are taken from other movies and executed so similarly to the original that the forerunner immediately comes to the viewer's mind. This kind of poorly-done mimicry leaves you feeling duped by and embarrassed for the person attempting it. The worst part was the ending, which felt rushed and forced. Perry is certainly invested in happy endings, but this was insulting to the characters and the viewers.

Overall, the only reason I continued to watch the movie was not because it was in any way worth it, but because I have a sometimes silly desire to finish what I've started. I hope that Perry soon decides to employ screenwriters to broaden the scope of what seems to be a one-man show and production because movie scriptwriting requires a level of skill that he has not yet polished.",1272844800,16,2553,4.946386946386946
4154057,4,B003LSTWH0,"Let me 1st start by saying, people really need to stop comparing the 1st movie to the sequel.  They are not alike in anyway, and thats the way it should be.  The sequel is three years later with a new couple/new baby, an ex-husband and new circumstances for each couple.  The only real similarities are the problems that existed for some are still there, but thats it.

Overall it was a good movie. As much as I like Tasha Smith in the 1st one, she really irritated me in this one.  I could have done without her in many scenes, and much of her scenes were for comic relief, it was over the top this time around.  I really liked Sheila's character this time around as well.  She is definitely more sure of herself, happy being in the place she is in now.  Janet, WOW!!! she really came strong in this,  Two thumbs up for her, and I hope she continues with acting.

I also agree with another reviewer about Sheila's husband not being able to find a job as a Cop. Tyler could have done better research on this one, and just gave the man a job, and made his new job more demanding, with long hours, away from his new family, the focus of their issues.  Not being able to find a job as a cop, was just unrealistic.

I always thought Janet and Gavin's relationship was more show/fluff and there was something hiding under the surface, but I will not spoil it and leave it at that.

Adding the older couple, (Louis Gossett Jr and Cicely Tyson) was brilliant.  They were great together, and told an amazing story of how they met and married!!!

If there is going to be a 3rd movie, (the ending makes you think it will be), I would love to see how Sheila and her husbands relationship progresses.

Overall it was a good movie, and I plan to buy the DVD.",1272758400,2,1745,4.258358662613982
4154058,4,B003LSTWH0,"I'm not a movie person, and I am someone who tends to watch a movie one time and then, more or less, forget it. I also tend to really dislike watching ""black"" movies, which I will explain more in a second. However, I will not soon forget this movie, and this was neither a waste of my time nor money. I will certainly watch it again. It mixes realism with sensationalism in such a way that what is real about the movie keeps you just as interested as what is there to serve as a ""message"" or to make you react.

Unlike one reviewer, I found this to be one of the rare cases in which the ""sequel"" is superior to the first release. One reason off the top of my head, without giving anything away about the movie: Janet Jackson has been acting for, what, over 30 years, on and off...this is the first time in all those years that I've sat and watched one of her performances and just thought to myself, ""Whoa, Janet can ACT!"" She did a superb job, which is rare to say for actors/actresses who are predominantly thought of as something else, i.e. a singer. She and the writers took the character that she was in the first release and really revealed another side to her as opposed to other characters in the movie who made the movie seem more like ""why is there a second part to this movie coming out,"" i.e. they had nothing new to bring to the table such that we need another ""Why Did I Get Married?"". Another reason for my finding this to be better than the first release is because there were several emotional moments in the movie. I went to see this with my mother, and it seemed like it reached a point where she was crying every other scene.

My problem with ""black"" movies is I feel that they make black women look bad, particularly modern ""black"" movies. I cannot think of one modern ""black"" movie (""modern"" being in the past few years...let's say 5 or so) that does not do this or doesn't disproportionately make black women out to be the villain in relationships and/or social interactions moreso than black men--though, as I said, I am not a movie person--and this is no exception. When I mention characters who just seem to be the same ole same ole from the first release...I do not know her character's name, but the one woman who is always screaming and yelling at her husband (I think his name is Marcus) at the top of her lungs, embarrassing herself, him and everyone around them. That's obvious--she is the embodiment of the stereotype that so many people have of black women.

But in this release, one of the characters just, seemingly, out of the blue is revealed to be having an emotional affair with another man. She was completely devoid of remorse until the husband confronted her, and there were no major problems presented to the audience in their relationship that would ""justify"" her affair. Her husband is and, pretty much, always has been depicted as a very good man and husband to her, as well as a good father...she just ups and has an affair. I figure it was added for sensationalism/making several points in the movie, but it also just seemed unnecessary to me in the sense of...well, the other women's characters are also, in some way, presented as ""bad guys"" in their relationships. If the movie is to show some of the struggles of marriage, particularly black marriages, why not balance out the depiction more? You have one, maybe two, black men who are shown to be at fault at all in these relationships. Some people also mention not liking the ending of the movie, and I think part of the ending of the movie also relates closely to my point of the women being the villains here.

This is really my only reason for not giving 5 stars. To be fair, though, the male character in the movie who is unemployed...I really like the way the writers handled that storyline, because it really could have been more of a ""dumping on the unemployed black man"" thing. Instead, it was presented as a sensitive subject that the wife was very supportive of her husband about, but she also did and said a lot of wrong things to others about it and his reaction to that was right-on. You saw how it can affect a man, especially when his wife has all these rich/successful friends she's dragging him to hang out with, and you were put in the position to empathize with him rather than attack him.

--
Conclusion: a great movie that should entertain more than just black folks. This movie is not just for laughs, either. Pay attention to Janet and Malik, as they really are the highlight of this movie. Typical depictions of black women still don't ruin this one.",1271721600,4,4578,4.471291866028708
4154059,5,B003LSTWH0,"Well, the first one is still my favorite. This one left me with a different view of everything. There are a lot of lessons to take from this one. This one to me is more of this is what could happen when you do this or this is how your life can end up when you do that. I felt this one was more of a teaching tool than entertainment. I left in a daze and in thought of wow, look what can happen in marriage. Look what can happen when you push people, and when you don't forgive or move on.

I am still in thought of this one... It will take some time for it all to sink in. It is still a great movie, but it is such a tool of how you can let the enemy use your mind, and the enemy will have you thinking all types of things that may not even be true. I still plan to purchase the DVD of this one once it is out, as we own all of the other ones. I hope there will be a number three.. I would like to see a focus on marriage and in laws as well. Because marriage involves many other avenues.

Well I don't want to give too much of the movie away, as I saw this movie for the first time on 4/17/2010 and when we went to see the movie, it was still packed and lines. My mother went with us for her second time. She said she had to see it again, as it was so good to her. One of my co-workers also said that they were going to see the movie again as well. As for me I will wait for the DVD, so that I can relax and really take this one in... again it has so many lessons.. I am still in thought... Hurry out and enjoy!

4154060,1,B003LSTWH0,"Why Did I Get Married too? More like Why did I waste $[...] watching this crap? The real title should be: How does this guy take ten pounds of crap and stuff it into five pounds of movie? WTF was that ending?

Good God, this film meandered from the start. It was people sitting around and talking. Then after some airport drama from Angela, going to the Bahamas to TALK SOME MORE. It irks me that in all of Perry's movies he TELLS instead of SHOWS. Hey, aren't people supposed to be DOING things in a movie? Aren't films supposed to be about oh, ACTION? Isn't ACTION supposed to define CHARACTER? That's what I learned from Syd Field and Robert Mckee about screenwriting, but Perry don't know about that because he probably never bought any of these books to learn something about the craft of writing for the screen as opposed to the stage.

Man, the writing on this film was SLOPPY, sloppier than previous Perry films. I'm still waiting for dude to learn how to tell a basic story, let alone know how things work ONSCREEN. I'm still waiting for him to learn how to use plot points and use stuff like CONTRAST, IRONY, FORESHADOWING, and SYMBOLISM like Lorraine Hansberry or Spike Lee do in their stories. I'm still waiting for his characters to have some DEPTH and COMPLEXITY. Seriously, a six-year-old could write a better screenplay than Perry, and it would make more sense than anything he puts together in his ridiculous Ed Wood styled plots.

I mean, looking at the plotholes in this movie (That ending STILL GIVES ME A HEADACHE:

I Love how the guys hooked up with Mike, who shows up out of nowhere.  Shouldn't the timeshare have been settled in the DIVORCE FROM THE LAST MOVIE?

Oh and Jill Scott's new husband not being able to find a job as a COP? COME ON!  Civil service jobs are always hiring, even in recessions.  Big cities ALWAYS NEED POLICE OFFICERS to replace retiring ones. The fact that dude had experience in LAW ENFORCEMENT would have been a plus for him. Dude probably would have been selected FASTER than anyone else in pools because of his EXPERIENCE. Blue protects blue, and Blue helps out blue even when it's black. That's the culture of law enforcement. At the least dude would have gotten a Security work or bouncing at a bar. Sloppy writing from Perry there; he should have researched the details. A better plotline would have been about him adjusting to being part of the group. I mean, he's the new guy. He doesn't know these people as closely as they've known each other. Wouldn't they be averse to trusting him or getting to know him better?

Angela and Marcus- both these characters were so One-dimensional. If it wasn't for their loud arguing and use as comic relief they'd have no story at all. I love how they never resolve their trust issues and will be back to bicker and act a fool in yet another movie.

Gavin being made out to be a heel mid-film. The brotha just wanted to save his marriage and do right by his lady, but he's turned into a monster by Tyler ""Man-hating"" Perry. Hey Tyler, How about some BALANCE to your stories? How about showing the BROTHERS as complex three-dimensional people and not ""good"" or ""bad""? You do know that people have LAYERS and DEPTH to their personalities, and that people have REASONS for the way they act or react.

I Love how Pat never dealt with her issues FOR A SECOND MOVIE. But TP needs some drama for Dwayne to NOT deal with in the next installment. Keeps the suckers (I mean fans) coming back to plunk down cash for another installment. The Rock Cameo was just a diversion to deflect us from underdevelopment of the storyline.

I Love how Perry's character and his wife never deal with the deeper reasons for an emotional affair. This entire part of the movie was extremely underdeveloped. Perry tells us his wife is glowing; everybody tells us she's happier than she's ever been. Hey Tyler, Instead of having people joking on the beach, how about SHOWING us some frames of her getting things like text messages and pictures in e-mails?  Again, sloppy writing.

Seriously, All the characters came out of the movie just like they came in. That's just bad writing all around. Even Ed Wood had some type of change happen to Glen in Glen or Glenda.

Hey Tyler, How about you take some of your millions and pick up Syd Field's Screenplay or Robert Mckee's Story and learn something about screenwriting before writing your next movie.",1270512000,17,4412,4.588310038119441
4154061,5,B003LSTWH0,"Anybody going to see ""Why Did I Get Married, Too?"" knows what to expect.  The critics seem to hate Tyler Perry's work while audiences love it.  Maybe they hate his Christian themes, or maybe they just don't like to see a movie about relationships that is so real.  To put it simply, this movie is genuine, sincere, intellectual, emotional, and just plain awesome.

The acting is on par with the original ""Why Did I Get Married?""  I loved the acting before and I still like it now.  Troy, Sheila's new husband, is probably my least favorite actor of the bunch, but he's still good in quite a few of his scenes.  The emotional sequences really allow these actors to display their talent leaving me very impressed.

One complaint I've read from a few critics is that the ""violent"" acts of the husbands seem to be excused.  Well, I don't know about these critics but my wife likes it when I get firm and controlling.  It's not my nature to be agressive with her so she finds ways to draw out that aggressiveness from me.  She wants to know I can be sweet but firm when I need to be.  I feel like the husbands in this movie were behaving in a way that would really excite the target female audience of this film, and it definitely excited my wife in some positive ways (especially because none of the husbands ever hit their wives or even hurt them in any way that I can remember).  It gave me a few pointers as well that will aid me in developing the kind of firmness my wife desires.  Tyler Perry doesn't try to be politically correct in this aspect.  Men and women are different, and his characters exemplify this (except for Marcus and Angela, perhaps).  But remember in the original how Marcus finally got angry at Angela?  She LIKED it.  Some women want that type of treatment to feel feminine and like they are married to a MAN, so critics need to back off and understand that not all people are as narrow minded as they are regarding relationships.  Maybe they need to man-up in their marriages, but they are too scared so they jab at movies that show how they should be acting.

Sorry for the rant, but I think this is an important reason why critics will always bash Perry's movies.  They can't handle his depictions of the male and female roles in marriage or his Christian values.  Anybody who does like his style knows this movie will be awesome.  The ending is going to be a love it or hate it moment, but I thought it worked well (apart from the very last scene, but I can live with it).  You will see some great moments that tug on your heart strings, so get ready for a great experience.  This movie definitely made me cry.",1270425600,2,2635,4.383505154639176
4154062,5,B003LSTWH0,"Tyler Perry put his foot in this one! WDIGM2 was fantastic, the acting was great, the storyline was superb. Although the Angela character gets on my last nerve, the other cast makes up for. I laughed and cried, you will not be dissapointed! Highly recommend, can't wait for the dvd!",1270339200,5,282,4.66
4154063,5,B003LSTWH0,I enjoyed this movie soooooooooooo much i can relate. They all did a good job and JANET man did she act the hell out of that part i think the passing of Micheal Jackson had something to do with itgood job on her behalf. I don't think i wanted it to end like that BUT Mr. Perry sure made of for it with a surprise guess at the end. I love Angelia and Marcus she maybe loud and sometimes ghetto be we all can relate she just voice what she is thinking. Jill Scott's character in regards to Mike Karma is a B..... some men just cant appreciate whats in front of them until its too late. I laughed a lot and it was fun a very good sequel. I can honestly say I would like to see a 3rd movie made.,1270252800,10,691,3.8732394366197185
