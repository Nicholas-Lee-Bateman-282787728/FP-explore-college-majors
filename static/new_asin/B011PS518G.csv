7339985,5,B011PS518G,"This film version of Feodor Dostoievsky's classic novel ""Crime and Punishment"" was long overdue a DVD release. It used to be available on VHS. I remember there was a noticeable crackling noise throughout much of the VHS. The sound on the DVD is beautiful. It's been restored nicely. And the image is excellent. Bravo, Mill Creek Entertainment!

The plot: Roderick Raskolnikov (Peter Lorre) murders a disagreeable old pawnbroker in a fit of rage. He is fascinated by the angel faced prostitute Sonya (Marian Marsh). Inspector Porfiry (Edward Arnold)  takes an interest in a published article Roderick has written about crime. He asks Roderick's help in solving the case of the murdered pawnbroker.

Filmed by Columbia Pictures on a low-budget, this updated adaptation is most enjoyable. For its 88 minute length, it does manage to be fairly faithful to the mammoth novel it's based upon. Lorre, Arnold, the incomparably beautiful Marsh, et al do well in their roles. Josef von Sternberg's film inspired me to read the novel. Delighted to have this superb DVD.",1442966400,76,1058,5.104046242774566

Nevertheless, ""Crime and Punishment"" (1935) is recommended for von Sternberg and Lorre devotees.

The tension is almost tangible as the police detective amiably tightens the noose and Lorre gets increasingly agitated, punishing himself with both fear and guilt. It is quite faithful to the book.

7340032,5,B011PS518G,"One of themost beautiful movies I have ever watched about this beautiful novel of Doestovsky. Peter Lorre acted greatly as he gracefully actec the role of a student who though he was bright yet he couldn't even have enough money to pay the rent. He was good and gentle at heart but he was confused and lacked faith in God, so he felt the terrible injustice of the hunchwoman who was the pawnbroker that used people's misery to gain a lot of money until the moment came when he felt justified in killing her. In the way, he was met with a nice young lady who looks really innocent more of an angel than a prostitute. Strangely, this lady regardless of her lifestyle, yet deep down she had strong faith in the Lord and in his mercy. One of the beautiful scenes that shows how beautiful innocent faith is like, is when this lady asks the student if he would her to read him the Story of the Raising of Lazarus from The Gospel. It shows how Her beauty and Innocence influences him to the extent that he decides to go and confess in order to save an innocent man who was going to be judged for the Crime that had committed. The movie captured the essence of what Dostoevsky meant in a way that is hard to be paralled. The final scene when Roderick Raskolnikoff and Sonia enter the the office of the Police superintendent together so that he could confess his crime we see a beautiful hidden smile on both faces as they look upward as if Roderick feelt for the first time a relief from the guilt that had plagued him all along and as if he us thanking the Lord for his newfound faith that led him to take responsbility for his actions for the first time in his life. We see Sonia also smiling innocently while looking upward as well as if to Thank the Lord for the Redemption of Roderick. What a great Classic of a movie for a great classic of a novel.",1450915200,16,1846,4.277142857142858
7340033,4,B011PS518G,"Its difficult to translate a novel into a film, and even more difficult to translate 19th Century Russian philosophy and make it meaningful to 20th century audiences. Hence, few if any of the 30 attempts to bring Dostoevskys Crime and Punishment to the big screen have been successful. In this 1935 drama, the novel is clearly trimmed down and altered in significant places, but somehow the film retains the atmosphere of the novel.

Peter Lorre is there to provide the foreign actor and Josef von Sternberg gives us the European (Germanic) directing influences.

Peter Lorre (1904-64) gained prominence as the child molester in Fritz Lang's ""M"" (1931) and went on to fame as ""Mr. Moto"" in a series of 8 detective films between 1937 and 1939, although hes perhaps best known as Sydney Greenstreets partner is films like The Maltese Falcon (1941) and Casablanca (1942). This is his second American film debut following a terrific performance in Mad Love (1935). He gets second billing, after Edward Arnold.

Edward Arnold (1890  1956) plays the Police inspector. He appeared in more than 100 films from 1916 to 1956 and is best known for playing Daniel Webster in The Devil and Daniel Webster (1941) and Diamond Jim Brady in Diamond Jim (1935). Hes one of the few hefty men who were ever able to achieve leading man status, but staying hefty (and not going to fat) was such a problem for him that he ultimately decided to let his girth expand while his stardom faded. This earned him many meaty character roles.

Baby faced Marian Marsh (1913-2006) plays Lorres love interest. She was a sensation in Svengali (1931) but her career at Warner Bros faulted, so she moved to Columbia where this film was made. This may be her finest performance.
Exotic looking Tala Birell (1907-1958) plays Lorres sister. She was another in a long line of Garbo lookalikes who had a brief career in the 30s. Birell is excellent in this film.

Douglass Dumbrille (1889-1974) plays Birells suitor. Dumbrille was in more than 200 films, and worked with the Marx Brothers (Day at the Races) as well as Abbott and Costello (foreign Legion) , the Bowery Boys (Spook Busters), the Ritz Brothers (The 3 Musketeers), and Bob Hope  (Son of Paleface), but he also did dramatic roles in films such as Cardinal Richelieu (1935), Virginia City (1940), Mr. Deeds Go to Town, and Julius Caesar (1953).

Versatile Gene Lockhart (1891-1957) plays another of Birells suitors. Lockhart appeared in more than 100 films and was nominated as Best Supporting Actor in 1939 for Algiers. The father of actresses Kathleen and June Lockhart, hes best remembered for his roles as the judge in Miracle on 34th Street (1947) and Georges de la Tremouille in Joan of Arc (1948), but I remember him best as Bob Cratchit in A Christmas Carol (1938).

The show stealer is Mrs. Patrick Campbell (1865-1940) who plays the pawnbroker. It was said that the role of Eliza Doolittle in Pygmalion (1941) was written specifically for her by George Bernard Shaw. This was her final fim.

Josef von Sternberg (1894-1969) directs. Born in Vienna, he grew up in New York and moved to Germany in 1929. Von Sternberg was twice nominated for an Oscar (Morocco in 1930 and Shanghai Express in 1931). His credo was To know what to reveal and what to conceal and in what degree to do this is all there is to art. He claimed I care nothing about the story, only how it is photographed. You can see this philosophy in the film  many of the scenes have photographic beauty but don't necessarily advance the plot or serve the story which itself has been altered a lot. This was one of von Sternbergs first films without Marlene Diedrich.

Over his 50 year career Lucien Ballard (1908-88) was voted Best Cinematographer at the Venice Film festival (The Devil is a Woman) in 1935, was Oscar nominated (The Caretakers) in 1963 and won an NSFC award for his work on The Wild Bunch (1969). He worked with Sam Peckinpah on the TV series The Westerner and The Wild Bunch (1969), Cable Hogue (1970), Junior Bonner (1972), and The Getaway (1972). He was a favorite cinematographer of director Budd Boetticher and worked on 7 Randolph Scott films. While he is best known for his westerns, he had an impressive list of film noir (The Killing, The Lodger, Laura).

1935 was a good year for films. Mutiny on the Bounty and The Informer were box office and Oscar winners. Other top 10 grossing films included Gable and Harlow in China Seas, Flynn and de Havilland in Captain Blood, Shirley Temple in The Littlest Rebel and Curly Top, and Greta Garbo in Anna Karenina. Other notable films released that year included Alice Adams with Hepburn, The 39 Steps, The Bride of Frankenstein, David Copperfield, A Tale of Two Cities, Les Miserables, Top Hat, and A Night at the Opera. In Germany, Leni Riefenstahl released Triumph of the Will.

Dont view the film and expect to see the novel. Nor should you expect to see the kind of film von Sternberg is most famous for, with the endless close ups and ornate settings. Think of this film as an early film noir and you will be most comfortable.",1450656000,23,5092,4.732505643340858

7340036,4,B011PS518G,"A well-done adaptation, directed by Joseph Sternberg on a low budget.  Peter Lorre is a fine actor--as is Edward Arnold--but is a bit miscast as Roskolnikov. This is a crime story that about so much more than murder.

My one objection is to the Product Description. ""A Great Masterpiece becomes an even greater movie!"" Really, who writes and approves copy like that? Dostoyevsky's novel IS a masterpiece and one of the best things about this movie is that it will get more people to read the book. But it is an insult to a competent movie to pretend that it in anyway achieves equivalence--much less superiority--with such a deep, complex and beautifully written book--something that is -truly- a masterpiece..&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crime-and-Punishment-Enriched-Classics/dp/074348763X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crime and Punishment (Enriched Classics)</a>",1446940800,10,910,6.214285714285714
7340037,5,B011PS518G,"Terrific acting but the direction leaves something to be desired.  Most memorable are the Peter Lorre character, the police commissioner and the miserable old pawn broker.  Lorre's complex character deserves careful dissection.  He lives in abject poverty but, with the help of his poor mother, manages to graduate with high honors with a degree in criminology.  His future--and the future of his family--should be guaranteed except for the fact that our 'hero' is idiosyncratic to the point of deep pathology.  He has a schizoid personality disorder characterized, in part, by truly incredible arrogance and delusions of grandeur.  He commits a murder which is almost a 'thrill kill.'  He thinks he can commit the perfect crime because he is far more intelligent than the police.

Here is where I think the film is misdirected.  It should have, in my opinion, been a study of the unrelenting power of a guilty conscience.  The character should have behaved rather intelligently and coolly until 'done in' by his own guilty soul.  Instead the director produces a character who is so peculiar, weird and unlikeable that he draws attention to himself.  His guilt is a neon sign.  Not just once but over and over.  Ultimately he leaves no room for himself.  Everybody knows he is guilty.",1446336000,18,1284,5.018957345971564
