733321,3,6303935702,"Released in 1995, Bushwhacked is a kids adventure movie starring Daniel Stern as a delivery man whos falsely accused of murder. He avoids capture by impersonating a scout leader and leading a group of adolescents on an amusing frolic in the wilderness.

While this is a kids-oriented movie, it tries to be edgy rather than Disney-like family fluff (not that theres anything wrong with that). For instance, Sterns character attempts to explain the birds and the bees to the kids using Barbie & Ken dolls and theres a scene of the kids urinating over a cliff and, unbeknownst to them, on the antagonist. Despite these few sequences, the movies harmless and its mostly just an amusing trek through the forest with the expected problems of having a fake scout leader. Ive never seen Stern in a movie before, but hes so over-the-top here that he constantly looks like hes on the verge of a coronary, not that it necessarily mars the movie; actually it fits.

My mediocre rating is for adult viewers; for kids it gets a solid B grade.

The film runs 90 minutes and was shot in Alta, Lake Tahoe, Placerville and Los Angeles, California.

733436,5,6303935702,"Ever since I was a kid, I've loved this movie. It has a great storyline about an average delivery guy named Max Grabelski who soon becomes a fugitive in a murder case. The police think he killed a millionaire named Reinhart Bragden. He finds out that another package is supposed to be delivered to Mr. Bragden on a mountain called Devil's Peak. On the way there, he wants to prove his innocence, but he is mistaken for a great Scout leader and is forced to take Troop 12 of the Ranger Scouts on an overnight in the woods. Soon, the FBI and Scout Leader Erickson are hot on his trail. Along the way, he begins to care for the kids, and wants to help them get their badges. I highly recommend BUSHWHACKED!!!",1220832000,,705,4.348484848484849
733437,4,6303935702,"That this DVD rules. haha. It is so cheesey and so 90's style quality family cinema. Very ""Home Alone""ish style (not just because of Stern) movie, and super predictable! Get into it!",1168905600,2,182,4.71875
733438,4,6303935702,"If I were to compare this movie to any other movie it would be to the more recent ""Without A Paddle."" Although the plots are quite different, both involve a wacky portrayal of camping in the wilderness... so wacky as to seem almost completely random or incoherent in terms of how people actually deal with real outdoor situations. Both movies are ridiculous in this regards, but they are comedies and so it's possible, although at times difficult, to forgive their extravagence in this regards. What holds the movies together are the characters, plots, and, most of all, the humor. ""Bushwacked"" wins out over ""Without A Paddle"" in the humor department. There are several routines that are over-the-top (almost reminiscent of something you might see in a ""South Park"" episode), and which might be considered inappropriate by some since child actors are involved, but I say to heck with the prudes. ""Bushwacked"" is a fun movie with lots of good gags and very nearly worth each and every one of the four stars I rated it at!",1157673600,2,1021,4.806818181818182
733505,3,6303935702,"A manic Daniel Stern stars in this entertaining, if derivative, ""family"" comedy.  Stern stars as a delivery man who is set up for the murder of  banker and while on the lam manages to be mistaken for a scout leader for a misguided troop of ranger scouts.  The movie--and Stern---sometimes strain to make us laugh, but the movie does have some humorous moments, and Stern while certainly not in the league of such actors as Jim Carrey or Steve Martin, struggles hard to make us care about him and his predicament.  Should entertain the family on a chilly autumn night.",1129248000,,567,4.64
733506,2,6303935702,"This movie though rated PG is full of sexual comments and profanity.  Daniel Stern even says Fu------dge.  Unless you want your children to be taught the birds and the bees from a deviant loser I would steer clear of this Movie.  In one scene all the boys are peeing on a man below for an extended amount of time.  The children in it are entertaining overall, but Stern is an overboard actor.  He is obviously acting the whole time, nothing about it is natural.  The children do a decent job acting.

If you are getting this for children, I would pick a different movie.  I pitched my copy in the trash",1126224000,5,602,4.36036036036036
733507,5,6303935702,Enjoyed the wholesomeness and well acted players.  Fun movie to watch with older children.  Lots of adventure and silliness.,1125360000,,124,5.473684210526316
733508,2,6303935702,"I wasn't expecting much from Daniel Stern, after all, I've only ever seen him in the Home Alone movies, and he had a buddy in that, to bounce off. When he's alone, he's just not that terrific. Plus, the blurb on the back of the case didn't really tell me what to expect from the movie. The blurb could have been re-written, to make it sound more appealing. Predictably, there's also a few Home Alone references thrown in there.

Playing a hapless delivery man, with awful hair, he gets framed for murder, which leads him into all kinds of hi-jinx, including adopting the identity of Cub Scout leader. A kid hater at its worst, he becomes almost a Pied Piper type, as he leads the kids on a rowdy trek. Although Stern plays the loveable idiot quite well, it's painful to watch sometimes, as he's so OTT.

The scenery, is a bonus about the movie, filmed around the Lake Tahoe area. A lot of the movie has taken its inspiration from other movies, particularly, I felt, the Honey I Shrunk The Kids series.

I just wasn't sure about this movie. Wasn't particularly fussed whether I watched the film or not. I definitely wouldn't buy it. It's not worth the money.",1108252800,,1157,4.5
733509,4,6303935702,"Max Grabelski (Daniel Stern in full-on Home Alone mode) is a sleazy delivery man perpetually stuck in a 1970's time-warp (puh-lease tell me where I can get one of those shirts). He struts his way down the street to Bee Gees tunes and behaves like Disco Stu from The Simpsons. He's got a little con going on after working hours in which he delivers clandestine packages to some rich guy (a weak Anthony Heald) for big tips. He needs escapism and the mystery of the con makes him feel like a spy. Until that is, when Max is framed for murder and has to run for his life.

While trying to intercept the last in the series of suspicious packages (located in the mountains of the Pacific Northwest) in order to clear his name, Max is mistaken for a world famous Scout Leader and has to lead a bunch of adventure-hungry kids into the wilderness and shake off the pursuing FBI.

Daniel Stern's physical comedy is just plain hilarious and his comic timing is perfect. For anyone who liked him in Home Alone 1 and 2 you'll love him in this also. The kids are surprisingly not that annoying. Usually I hate kids in movies (Jurassic Park, Hook, The awful Von Trapp children) but they had enough character and laughs among them to make it okay.

I only ever had a problem with the ending. It was just too tame for a PG-13 rated movie. Instead of Gordy's far-fetched fall into the ravine I would have preferred that the entire balcony of the cabin to collapse and the bad guy fall to his death. Plus the bad guy is kind of weak, his accent is just plain odd and he has this strange sort of campness and not scariness about him. Too bad since Anthony Heald has played some true scumbags in his time.

These 2 complains aside Bushwhacked is great adventure movie with a lively score by Bill Conti (why is there no soundtrack CD?). It's probably best enjoyed in Spring/Summer and is perfect for the whole family. An admirable amount of laughs indeed.

The DVD is a godsend for anyone who had to suffer the terrible pan-and-scan video (like me), which half the picture missing. Now Bushwhacked is presented in full 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen and it looks just fine. The sound is simple Dolby 2.0 but it's more than adequate. Extras are thin, consisting of just a Bushwhacked trailer (quite good) and couple of other Fox family movie trailers.

But for the price, Bushwhacked is a must, regardless of extras or not. Though this time I would I liked to have seen some.",1106265600,8,2451,4.496629213483146
733510,4,6303935702,"Upon watching this, one has to ask themselves how this film compares to other standard Hollywood comedies. How does it compare? Very well indeed. The average comedy these days isn't as funny as this movie is. This movie is very creative and witty. This movie was so well cast and the characters are perfect for the film. Daniel Stern was hilarious as Max Grebelski and the scout troop was brilliant.
Aside from Stern, the scout troop makes the film a remarkable comedy. They work well together and have great chemistry. Ari Greenberg and Janna Michaels were my favorite scout troop characters. Ari played his role perfectly and Janna lights up the screen-she's a fantastic actress and should be in more films.
All in all, this film is a feel good comedy with great mountain scenery and is worth taking a look at.",1053993600,15,812,4.725352112676056
733511,3,6303935702,"Before I begin this review, let me make something clear.  This is not a good film, it is not a bad film, it is different.  Although the story line is unrealistic and the acting is below the level of good, Bushwhacked manages to squeeze past the realm of boring and stupid films into just being a plain average film worth renting but not buying.  Daniel Stern's downfall was probably after Home Alone 2: Lost in New York.  After the Home Alones success, it seemed that Stern had just retired or disappeared.  Now seen on the ABC show Regular Joe (which is probably going to be canceled), Stern has proven that he has lost his touch when he became the stupid hero instead of the guy who we wanted to get hurt.  Bushwhacked is not a big-budget film and it wasn't a box office blowout either but the vast array of child stars once again turns it into one of those Disney films where good always wins and gets rewards while evil is severely punished for lying and stealing.  DVD is barely worth it since it doesn't contain many extra features.  Bushwhacked is long forgotten if just never known because it was just nothing, a film that had no good stuff but no bad either.
Stern stars at Max Grabelski, a wild and rude delivery man who after getting caught up in a web of lies, crooked F.B.I. agents, and money travels to Devil's Peak disguised as a forest ranger with several kids to find out what has happened.  No super actors or acting in this film and no spectacular effects either.
Once again, Bushwhacked is a plain family film.  Rent it when you have nothing to do or nothing good is on TV.  As for buying, Bushwhacked will probably lie under a large pile of dust for years  to come.",1051660800,2,1686,4.403225806451613
733512,5,6303935702,"I watched this movie for the first time in the theaters in 1995, as soon as it came out on tape, it was very hard to find although I wanted it.  I copied one from the video rental store, and have watched it soo many times that the quality is getting poor.  The movie was wonderful and I reccomend it to all who are looking for a good laugh! It's a great movie to buy for kids or adults, so check it out! :)",1001289600,7,406,3.8214285714285716
733513,3,6303935702,"Ridiculous-looking city slicker Daniel Stern plays a commonplace idiot named Max who delivers mailings for Fed-Ex. As he struts through the streets chomping down dough balls and slim jims, while slurping on a giant Coke, there isn't a soul around him who can't admit that the man defines true stupidity. And when Max is greeted by a fire in a giant mansion, where he was sent to deliver a package on a foggy night, he quickly becomes the number one suspect when the fumes kill the man of the house.
Looking for a place to hide out, Max falsely identifies himself as a famed mountain climber and animal man to a group of elementary boy scouts and girl scouts. All the while, Daniel Stern avoids equally hapless police who simply try to match the face that was on the news. ""Bushwhacked"" never appears to be worthwhile until you sit down and take a look at Daniel Stern's Marty Stouffer imitation. It is one of those tapes with a plot that leaves you dissapointed, but countless one-timed gags and quips featuring everything from a grizzly bear to a police officer with his chin glued to his own steering wheel. It's no ""Casanova"", but Mr. Stern delivers a number of laughs...and packages.",983404800,,1187,4.6571428571428575
