8452591,5,B0051F725K,"My husband and I were fans of the earlier series of Waking the Dead and were very disappointed when the later DVDs were not Region 1 compatible any longer.  Finally, I realized that an all region DVD player would solve our problem and we are back enjoying Boyd at his almost at tantrum throwing best.

If I had the chance to change anything about this entire series it would be to get rid of that awful theme music and the over-the-top sound track.",1374364800,,448,4.385542168674699
8452592,4,B0051F725K,"All the series 1 to 9 were good,although I thought towards the latter series they sort of got of the track. One would expect the squad to be doing cold cases,but to jump into the present and one item is cold case seems as if there were not enough actual cold cases to portray. But it is good viewing and the characters stand up.
Enjoy

8452593,5,B0051F725K,"We are spacing it out as this is the last of this series and we will miss it when we're finished. True to the previous series, Boyd has calmed down a little but still does whatever it takes to save a child or avenge an innocent. We wish American TV writers would learn from the Brits. The actors are not just pretty faces. The stories are ripped from the headlines and not just a formula that got a good rating. Highly recommend it, but remember - it takes an All Region DVD player until it's released for Region 1.",1355097600,,515,4.212121212121212
8452594,5,B0051F725K,"The 9th season held true to the excellent scripting and acting of previous seasons. So good!  You will enjoy this series, a lot!",1334880000,,128,4.565217391304348
8452595,5,B0051F725K,"This is one of the best series ever.  I have all the other series and am eagerly awaiting this (ordered from UK).  (I assume it will be as great as the others).  I am writing mostly to warn those of us in the US (with a PAL-converting, all-region DVD-player, which is reasonably cheap to buy online and necessary to view): PLEASE NOTE that you can order this directly from Amazon-UK and get it (including shipping) for less than HALF the price of that offered on the US Amazon site by 3rd-party vendors.  I am glad I checked!",1323475200,9,525,4.381443298969073
