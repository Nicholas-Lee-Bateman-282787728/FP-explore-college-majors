8741737,5,B0188KHSVM,forget dvd it is worthless repetition of other issued concerts (2001) but the cd is of interest - thr group is 1976/78 team that release Hows tricks and Jet set of the time mentioned. The live is well recorded and quite rare even for bootleg collectors - Simon on drums.,1513555200,,270,4.42
8741738,2,B0188KHSVM,"Another piece of garbage from Laser Media. This company needs to go away right away. This time the complaints are: the DVD has a mere half-hour of material on it, two tracks from two different shows. Obviously stolen. The CD sounds good enough. It is of a show I am not familiar with, and Laser Media cannot be bothered to identify anything about it.",1485043200,3,350,4.484375
