8091895,3,B000BT02ZI,Too short and didn't cover a lot of her life. A number of controversial things they failed totally to mention but I wanted to her her side of them because I loved this courageous hero of ours.,1385856000,,192,4.216216216216216
8091896,5,B000BT02ZI,"This video is a wonderful documentation of the overview of Mother Teresa's life, and what drove her to abandon her life comforts to minister to the downcast, sick, dying, and despairing.  It is a wonderful biography on her life that I highly recommend to everyone!",1381968000,,264,4.866666666666666
8091897,5,B000BT02ZI,"Beautiful Documentary on a Beautiful person and soul,Mother Teresa did what India could never do for the people in Calcutta,Nevermind that the Majority in India is Hindu and another Muslim and a small Population of Christians even smaller amount of Catholics. When you take this into consideration It is Amazing what Mother Teresa did for Children,Children who were left by parents and Those who did not have anywhere to go and were Unloved that had the chance to die In Dignity and not like some animal or treated worst like an Animal,An outspoken critic of Abortion,One Tough LADY and A Saint.",1296518400,,595,4.900990099009901
8091898,3,B000BT02ZI,"I enjoyed the show and appreciated what others had to say about her from personal experience.  It was certainly historically accurate.  I would have liked to have seen more actual footage of Mother Teresa, though.  The few glimpses were precious but rare.  I purchased it for my 8th grade Bible class and they enjoyed it, but found the commentary a little over their heads.  A good show to help explain 'compassion' by seeing it in action.",1190332800,4,439,4.723684210526316
8091899,5,B000BT02ZI,"This was very enjoyable and challenging. Mother Teresa lived a life of denial and abundance at the same time. She is pictured with some of the most famous people who then seem insignificant next to her. And without saying many words, they knew it. Mother Teresa demonstrated a daily life devoted to service. The presentation would challenge anyone to do more themselves. I really liked it and have watched it more than once.",1173484800,4,424,4.821917808219178
