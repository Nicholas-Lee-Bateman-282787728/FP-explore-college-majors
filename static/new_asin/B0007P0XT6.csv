8545397,1,B0007P0XT6,"This movie is boring. It's like a road trip movie without the zany antics. There are many moments where the camera woman talks into the camera. It does have the distinction of probably being the only import dvd without any drifting in it. There is no action to be found on this DVD. Some highway scenes shot from the passenger window. One mustang is caught doing a burnout and that's it, no donuts or crazy driving. A couple redeeming scenes might be the model car wash and booty shaking contest towards the end. The interviews are also lifeless. You have been warned.",1115424000,,568,4.578431372549019
