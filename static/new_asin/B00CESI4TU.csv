8581064,5,B00CESI4TU,"I found this dvd very useful. I have been utilizing these techniques and have nothing but positive results. I must add though that some training in visceral manipulation or neural manipulation might help with understanding these techniques and the aspect of listening techniques. Definitely a dvd for the more ""experienced"" practioner with developed palpatory skills.",1415836800,2,367,5.6909090909090905
8581065,3,B00CESI4TU,"The review of anatomy is excellent. However, the description of this item claims that he explains both anatomy and treatment. But the treatment is unique, totally unlike anything I've been exposed to in other classes, and the explanation of the physiology behind this tiny movement is completely inadequate.  During the treatment he repeatedly implores us to ""listen"" but that comes not from mimicking someone else but from understanding what's going on in the tissues. And, in this case, I don't. The treatment depends on a thorough understanding of Golgi tendons and mechanoreceptors, information not explained well enough here nor in my physiology books. I am depending on that explanation to be a part of this lesson.
Once again I have made an investment, (at least no time lost and no travel expenses incurred.) And I come away not understanding how to incorporate this into my practice; what can the client expect having been treated one time? How many treatments might be expected to see results? If a client has been told by the medical community that he is ""bone-on-bone and must receive surgery"" can we hope to see favorable response from this treatment? If the client has pain as a result of some of these treatments, should we proceed? Might the client feel more pain, swelling afterward, for how long, and should he/she do something at home, ie., ice, heat, water, product?
Also, being a practitioner of muscles, I am accustomed to treating the whole muscle. Might that sometimes be needed, or is this specific treatment enough to change the whole muscle that probably caused the problem in the first place.
I was looking forward to getting this item, but now, once again, I feel abandoned. So, until I can understand this unique treatment, I won't purchase anymore Barral lessons.",1381449600,3,1794,4.98
