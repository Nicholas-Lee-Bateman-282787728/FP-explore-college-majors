Together they fight off the deadly demons that seek to destroy the world.

As the semifinals go on, Yusuke is still fighting the pain of Genkai's test. The other 3 members of the team are fighting against stacked odds without their leader, and the old master Genkai.

This is  a great series. It has lots of cool characters, good animation, voice acting, and a very engrossing story. It's a very long anime, so if you want to watch it be prepared to like it and spend a long time with it. It's one of those that gets more interesting as it progresses. Even though it has a bang up start it maintains the flow throughout. I would even go so far as to say that it's one of the most famous anime series' of all time. It has a bit of a Dragonball Z vibe to it, and everyone likes that. I highly recommend Yu Yu Hakusho to every anime fan, it's simply amazing.",1353110400,,1419,4.228782287822878
