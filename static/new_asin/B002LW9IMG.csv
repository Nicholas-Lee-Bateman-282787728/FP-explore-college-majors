3949260,5,B002LW9IMG,"Wow, I have watched the DVD twice and I haven't had it in my possession very long! I have waited my whole life for a documentary like this. Jeremy is a fantastic narrator and I feel like I am sharing his experiences along side him. I want to be an extreem fisher now! You'll love it!",1284076800,2,283,4.071428571428571
3949261,4,B002LW9IMG,"I would recommend this series to anyone interested in naturalist documentaries. Wade is intelligent, well-informed, clearly experienced and very well spoken. He is obviously not primarily a showman nor does he overly dramatize the expeditions. Yet there is always a gratifying sense of mystery and a touch of suspense unfolding. He very much lives up to his self described role as ""extreme angler"".",1275868800,3,398,5.333333333333333
3949262,5,B002LW9IMG,"River Monsters is an absolute blast.  Jeremy Wade is a fantastic host who stops at nothing to land the biggest fish he can.  The first season is a great introduction to Wade's adventures.  Even those who don't enjoy fishing are likely to find River Monsters an entertaining show.  As a fisherman myself, I am envious of Wade's job.  I can watch these episodes over and over and not be bored at all.",1275264000,4,398,4.472222222222222
3949263,5,B002LW9IMG,"I must start by saying I rarely view Animal Planet shows on tv.  I was intrigued by the cover of this series when I saw it at the store and decided to purchase it after reading the few reviews posted right here on Amazon.  Let me tell you, I am not disappointed in the slightest!  This series and its host Jeremy Wade provide some of the most entertaining and memorable video in a nature series I have seen in years.

Each episode runs approximately 41 minutes.  This season contains 8 episodes in total (1 of which the dvd says is a ""bonus episode"" even though it is in the main menu).  I hope future seasons will contain a bit more content, even though this is well worth the price for a 1st season.

  As for the show itself, the video footage is superb.  Jeremy Wade sets up each episode in roughly the same fashion.  He describes local legends, historical events and eyewitness accounts centering around the species of the episode.  Thereafter he travels to the region and begins to research the actual events - usually going as far as finding the ACTUAL people involved in the legends.  Mythbusters has actually dealt with a few of the events....but this is NOWHERE near as fascinating as when Jeremy actually finds the people to whom the event occurred and then brings them back to the site it happened at.  Along the way the host shows himself as having very rich onscreen character as well as extensive knowledge of the creatures he encounters.  After establishing possible theories as to what creature is responsible for the attacks, he begins to fish the rivers.  Usually he meets with failure the first few times, and turns to local fishermen and other experts to refine his fishing method.  Jeremy is a highly skilled professional angler...and some of the fish he encounters will definitely impress.  One thing that I admire about this series is how relentless Jeremy is about catching what he set out to find.  Even if some of the sizes are not up to what he wanted...he will fish days on end to get something and to prove without a doubt that the monsters exist.  My favorite episode ""the Goonch Catfish"" proves his determination.

  Overall, I hope this is one series that continues to thrive.  Jeremy Wade has such a profound enthusiasm and passion for his work that this series was truly spectacular.  I've never really been interested in fishing, but this series has definitely peaked my interest...and fear....for what lies on the bottom of our lakes and rivers.  Highly recommended!",1261267200,14,2503,4.709677419354839
3949264,5,B002LW9IMG,"My son is 8 and is going to be stoked to receive this for Christmas. He is totally fascinated with fishing and the real-life adventures Jeremy Wade encounters. The video footage is awesome, amazing, entertaining and educational. So glad I found it on DVD!",1259452800,3,255,4.818181818181818
3949265,5,B002LW9IMG,"Ever since watching the first episode of River Monsters, I've been hooked (no pun intended). It really makes you think of what is lurking beneath the surface of the worlds oceans, rivers, and streams. The show is both educational and it will make your skin crawl!

Trust me, seeing a man nearly swallowed by a giant Amazonian Catfish, it's just down right out creepy! Anyways, below is the episodes that are included on this Season One set. This set contains all seven episodes from the first season. Season Two premieres Spring 2010!

Episode One- Piranha
- In 1976 a packed coach crashed into the Amazon killing 39 people. By the time the bodies were pulled out by rescuers some had been so viciously mutilated by piranha they could only be identified by their clothes. Tracking down survivors and eyewitnesses of piranha attacks, Jeremy Wade reveals why the piranha fills our nightmares.

Episode Two- Killer Catfish
- Two years ago, on the treacherous Kali River, high in the mountains of Northern India, Jeremy Wade unearthed the mother of all fisherman's tales and the ultimate freshwater horror: a super-sized freshwater fish turned man-eater. Jeremy takes on the biggest, toughest challenge he's ever faced as he heads back to the Himalayas to separate fact from fiction and track down the monstrous beast.

Episode Three- Alligator Gar
- In the Deep South is a river monster with the reputation of a devil. Blamed for a series of violent attacks on humans, this creature is said to be as vicious as a shark and as big as an alligator. The authorities said it should be annihilated, but not all are so quick to condemn it. Extreme angler Jeremy Wade heads to Texas on its trail in an attempt to uncover the facts behind this animal's notoriety. Helped by local expertise and with his own wits honed sharp, he finds new ways to reveal the truth about the monster alligator gar.

Episode Four- European Maneater
- Reports of an attack on a swimmer in a lake close to Berlin is the starting point for an intense and shocking investigation. Wade travels to Germany where he meets modern-day victims of a beast that has been raising its snout above the surface of freshwaters in Europe regularly over the past 700 years. Investigations travel to Spain where Wade discovers firsthand that the wels catfish is a living, breathing aggressive predator growing to man-eating proportions capable of everything depicted in medieval records and more.

Episode Five- Amazon Assassins
- In the darkest depths of the Amazon lurks a dinosaur. Legends tell of an evil spirit inhabiting an enormous fish. Taller than a man, it is covered in scales and crushes its prey with a tongue made of bone. Jeremy Wade has encountered this creature once before, and he came out second best. He's taking no chances in the rematch.

Episode Six- Amazon Flesheaters
- A man swallowed whole by a fish. A body eaten alive from within. Another penetrated in a most unnatural fashion, and yet more with multiple stab wounds. Jeremy Wade is in pursuit of these notorious killers to discover the facts -- to determine if their crimes are real and their methods as gruesome as reported.

Episode Seven- Freshwater Shark
- No fish inspires the same terror as the shark, a creature with an insatiable hunger for brutal violence. But at least these killers are confined to the oceans. Or are they? Expert angler Jeremy Wade investigates whether it's possible for sharks to live in freshwater, and if so just how far inland these vicious predators will bring their reign of terror.

River Monsters is a great show. If you're a fisherman, or a fan of water creatures, this is the show for you. True it's no Meercat Manor, Orangutan Island, or Escape to Chimp Eden, but its still a great show. My advice, buy this DVD! But I would wait for the price to go down some!",1251590400,52,3829,4.77190332326284
3949286,5,B002LW9IMG,"This series is absolutely brilliant!

3949315,5,B002LW9IMG,"As the host of a wildlife adventure show, Jeremy Wade is fantastic. He's enthusiastic without being annoying, informative without being condescending, and bold, yet not entirely fearless. While he plies international rivers and waterways searching for his quarry, Wade stops to speak with natives and those who have witnessed horrendous attacks by the ""monsters"" in question. Just when you think sharks and crocs are your only real aquatic threats, Wade will expose you to some monumental, hazardous fish you thought possible only in prehistory or fairy tales. Man-eating catfish? You bet.

Whenever Wade gets into the water to track down these somewhat elusive predators, I can feel my blood pressure rising. ""River Monsters"" is educational, suspenseful, and just as thrilling as Animal Planet's other top series, ""Big Cat Diary"". Put those moldy 'sport-fishing' programs to rest and take a full-throttle ride with Wade and his extraordinary discoveries.",1451347200,,955,5.496598639455782

Jeremy Wade - zoologist, biologist, and extreme angler travels the globe in search of freshwater river monsters. I'm amazed by some of the fish Jeremy catches and I especially like the way Jeremy validates or debunks local myths about the various freshwater fish.

Episodes are as follows....

dvd one: 1-Piranha 2-Alligator Gar 3-European Maneater (wels catfish) 4-Amazon Assassins (arapaima)

3949371,5,B002LW9IMG,"I can't say enough about this show. It is absolutely incredible!

First off, ""River Monsters"" is unlike anything else on TV. Bored with all the reality nonsense and crime dramas? Give this show a chance, for something truly unique. Jeremy Wade, host of ""River Monsters"" describes himself as a biologist and ""extreme angler"". And that is a very accurate description, indeed. Once you see the unreal size of the fish that he tracks down and lands, you will agree that this is ""extreme angling"".

What's most remarkable about his work, however, is the show's twist- Wade fishes in bodies of FRESHWATER only! Sure, we all know that there are plenty of huge fish in the oceans. But I would have never guessed that there was such a diverse collection of unique (and oftentimes vicious) specimens in the world's rivers, lakes, and other freshwater bodies.

Gargantuan catfish that weigh several hundred pounds (and can reportedly grow large enough to swallow a man)... the legendary piranha... the curious Alligator Gar... these are the types of fascinating species that Wade tracks down each episode. And let's not forget the obscenely large (500 pound+) bull shark that has adapted to survive in fresh water (where lots of people swim, mind you)!

I also love the style in which the show is presented. Wade approaches each case as if he is a detective, gathering reports and evidence, combining it with his own formidable knowledge, and forming a hypothesis about what kind of fish may be in the area, causing the reported disturbances. He then gathers his gear, heads to the area in question, and begins interviewing witnesses, survivors, etc. Based on what he learns, Wade begins his quest, which can oftentimes take months to bear fruit (er, fish), as he is determined to find what is generally an elusive critter in very large body of water. All this is put together and edited very well, making the hour long program fly right by... it keeps you hooked!

It is unfortunate, however, that this fantastic show is not available in Blu-ray, but only DVD. I first saw these episodes as they aired on Animal Planet, and they truly need to be viewed in HD, in order to appreciate the remarkable locales and beasties. Therefore, I would strongly recommend streaming the show from Netflix or Amazon, in order to get the full, high definition experience.",1356998400,,2344,4.8793969849246235

3949374,5,B002LW9IMG,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this, but I had read the reviews and thought I would give it a chance. This show is amazing. I am not into fishing myself but found this informing and interesting. My husband (who doesn't fish either) even sat down and watched some of it with. You will not be disappointed. I am even thinking of using this when I home school my son.",1343174400,,377,4.178082191780822
3949375,2,B002LW9IMG,"I was very excited to come across this series. I have fished in a variety of places, for large fish, ""dangerous"" fish, and just fishing off the dock for fun.

I only felt the need to write that statement so it's understood I have fished and have a decent enough knowledge that I'm not approaching this series as a total outsider.

This series, while interesting, should not be confused with a documentary series.  It is closer to a""reality"" show.  A lot of talk, and a lot of build-up to what ultimately is not a big deal.  He travels the globe and catches large freshwater fish that are considered dangerous.  A lot of them are.  But the way this show is produced, it's as if he is facing life and death with every cast of his rod!?

I'm sorry but it's just too much.  I shouldn't expect anything more from a series called River Monsters, but I do expect more from the BBC.

I first watched this series over three years ago.  The only reason I'm writing this now is because it was on Netflix, and in the episode I'm watching (and about to turn off) our brave fisherman decided to add to the abundant drama of the show. In a very serious tone, he pronounced that it was rainy season, and that his carbon fishing rod makes for a great conductor.  (He actually says that the rainy season is ""approaching"", while they intercut images of thunderstorms.  Not a drop of rain actually falls).

So do you see what I'm getting at?  Not only is he bravely defying death from the bite of a freshwater fish, but by casting his rod  he is also risking electrocution.  It's just way over the top, and at every turn this guy is risking his life, in search of whatever the monster of the episode is.  Each episode is like this.  Overly narrated with fear and danger, trigger words to keep the audience enthralled.  If you're an Attenborough audience, it will annoy you.  If you're a Fear Factor audience, you might like it.  But only for a bit, until you realize, fear is not a factor. It's really just a guy, fishing from a boat,  exaggerating  every little thing.

A true fish tale.",1336867200,9,2068,4.407407407407407
3949376,5,B002LW9IMG,"I originally hesitated to buy this DVD as I needed a last minute Christmas gift. In the end, I placed an order 5 days before Christmas. I was so impressed that I received it in time for Christmas. Not only did a get the last minute Christmas gift I also bought a set for my own movie collection. I would recommend the entire series if you are considering even 1 of the DVD's. This is a great family show for all ages or for the fisherman that dreams big, everyone can enjoy this documentary filled with action and adventure.",1325980800,,524,4.303030303030303

3949378,5,B002LW9IMG,"I had no idea how great this series was going to be. I saw it on Netflix one evening and started watching it. Once you watch one, you will want to see them all!

Jeremy Wade, a British biologist, seeks out large aquatic predators to find out whether they are real or just a myth. This is not like a Steve Irwin Crocodile show. He's much more low key and soft spoken. He seeks to determine if stories of larger than life predators in the water do exists, or if they are simply exaggerated local stories.

Jeremy goes all over the world for these shows, and the filming of the local areas in each episode it astounding. He goes places most never would, and to extremes far to dangerous than anyone else ever should, but not in a reckless way. He's not so extreme that he doesn't care of he gets hurt, he's very real. After watching several episodes your aware of just how smart Jeremy is, knowing several languages and wealth of knowledge on all kinds of animals, cultures, etc.

Each episode goes in search of a different species. Watching all of them can helpful as sometimes he mentions previous species he's done shows on and it helps to have seen them to know what he's referencing. I have seen all the episodes in the series so far and always look forward to watching each new season that comes out. Definitely one of my new favorites.",1319155200,,1339,4.412955465587045

8373292,4,B002LW9IMG,"I have a hard time turning this show off sometimes because its so incredibly crafted, combining elements of drama, mystery, documentary, and history into beautifully shot and arranged pieces that engage the senses and intrigue the mind. River Monsters takes us all over the world, from calm Norwegian glacial fjords to the vast Amazon to the murky Mekong, from bustling capitals to remote villages, from endless oceans to trickling streams. All in search of a culprit. Its a Mother-Nature-inspired whodunnit. And Jeremy Wade intends to find out.

Wade fancies himself a freshwater detective, travelling far and wide to tackle cases of marine animal attacks on humans. Part Sherlock Holmes and part Captain Ahab, Wade attempts to solve these cases by interviewing victims or eyewitnesses, posit theories on key suspects, travel to the location of the incident, and fish for the perps (or at least the species of the perps). He typically starts lower on the food chain and works his way up, figuring smaller fish could implicate the presence of something larger. Wades abductive approach, along with the stunning cinematography, gives the show much of its signature appeal.

Wade himself oozes charisma and can effectively ham up almost any situation, which ironically gives the show levity considering the dark subject matter. The inherent danger hes up against with a well-equipped crew, knowledgeable guides, and state-of-the-art equipment is overstated to comedic proportions. That being said, Wades an adrenaline junkie ready and willing to get his hands dirty. He ventures out in shoddy boats, gets torpedoed in the chest by an arapaima, and stung while bare-handing a box jellyfish. Wade gets slapped, bitten, stung, scraped, speared, and hooked multiple times, all while demonstrating an unflappable spirit on camera. His obsession takes him to his limits while fishing for Muskie in a Canadian lake. A fruitless week with 13,000 casts had him questioning his angling career. Until he returned to Spirit Rock, where he had started the week, with just a light pole and 6 lb test.

Most of the cases Wade examines aren't active. Theyre cold, either having been solved already or simply written off as freak incidents. Heresay and legend have shrouded the truth, though no one he interviews appears to be jerking him around. Its clear they saw something. But not a mermaid grabbing a man or a serpent devouring a child. Wade sets out to find a logical answer while being sensitive to the families of the victims, which likely cant be easy for an angler showman who calls himself a detective.

All in all, its entertaining. Youll learn stuff, youll cringe, youll laugh, and youll cheer as at the end of almost every episode, Wade will be holding his prime suspect.

But don't take it too seriously. Its just TV.",1525305600,,2813,5.08008658008658

What made it worse was him saying this in front of a native local, who weighed about as much as the fish and who was obviously begging him to take the meat back for his village. Come on dude, really?  These fish had attacked and killed people in the area, including a little girl from one of the very villages helping this idiot to find these fish. How would these people have felt if after helping this man locate the spot and travel up river, they heard that he just let the monster go..to possibly kill another one of their kids?
