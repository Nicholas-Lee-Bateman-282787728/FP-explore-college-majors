7903184,5,1567844065,"This video was produced by Lilian Schein of Newbridge Communications as the fourth video in a master therapist video series.  Lilian wanted to show what authors who write about therapy actually do in the treatment room.  I  am a psychologist who writes about how to do couples therapy (e.g., From  Conflict to Resolution).  Lilian asked me to demonstrate my treatment  approach in a video that would show therapists and counselors effective  ways to help couples whose love is being tarnished with anger.
The video  The Angry Couple accomplished Lilian's goal of demonstrating treatment  strategies and techniques, and therefore is used broadly in therapist  training programs.  Experienced therapists who want to upgrade their couple  therapy skills also use the video, and can obtain continuing education  credits for the viewing (forms included with purchase).
What surprised  everyone involved in this video project, however, was how dramatically  compelling a video about a couple in therapy could be.  In addition, we  were astounded by how helpful the video is, not just for therapists who  want additional treatment skills, but also for general viewers who want to  improve their partnering and marriage success.
In sum, because of it's  engaging story line plus its helpfulness to all kinds of viewers, The Angry  Couple is offered now here on Amazon, both for professionals and for the  general public.  So get out your popcorn, keep a Kleenex box handy, and  enjoy watching a couple who want a better marriage learn, love, and grow  together!",953596800,10,1553,5.215447154471545
