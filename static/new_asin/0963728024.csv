Also, the bestselling paperback is now updated to 2010.  -- The author",1288742400,,244,4.785714285714286
7793717,5,0963728024,"I see that some people seem to blame the creator of this video for suicides.  Not just here, but everywhere.  And in general, the creators of all suicide references.  I say that whether or not someone read the book or watched the tape, they probably still would have done it.  I believe that this contains a wealth of information that can be put to use for practical purposes.  The terminally ill, and, in my most humble of opinions, every person alive should have the right to choose to end their own life, if they seriously beleive it necessary.  That's why things like this are so useful.  If someone I loved were to commit suicide, I'd rather it be done right, with a minimum of pain, than have it done painfully and slowly, without knowledge of other tachniques.  Material like this should be more widespread.  Then again, I may be biased here, as you are reading a review from someone to which Kevorkian is a hero.  If anyone is in chronic pain, with no way out, this is the way to go.  I recommend this very highly.",1097971200,16,1022,4.440860215053763
7793718,1,0963728024,"I am very dissappointed that a book like this can so easily be purchased. This book was found, and the video, at my sisters appartment, where she read, step by step, how to commit suicide. We as the family, would like books like this to be avilable to people that are terminally ill... not a 24 year old, beautiful young woman, that had her whole life ahead of her!!!",1095120000,6,367,4.333333333333333
7793719,5,0963728024,"In this video Derek Humphry presents his material in a tasteful, low-key manner entirely suitable for such a serious subject. The viewer benefits from his long experience in the field, both his firsthand experience and his wide-ranging research. He clearly presents the steps that can be taken by terminally-ill people in desperate need of a hastened death, and for this many will thank him. The benefits of disseminating this information widely must on balance outweigh the risks of it falling into the hands of those for whom it is not intended. It takes great courage and compassion to do what Mr Humphry has done, and this video is a vital contribution adding to his other pivotal works. Until enlightened euthanasia legislation is passed, many of us will rely on this information plus other new developments in the self-deliverance field, when we ourselves are faced with the misery of a terminal condition.",996451200,29,912,5.046357615894039
7793720,1,0963728024,"This video doesn't deserve any stars. I think that it is very sick of someone to make a video to tell old people that it is good to kill them selves when they are sick. Yes, I understand that they are VERY sick and  that they are suffering, but to promote sucide is just wrong. and soon it  will be spread onto younger kids, letting them think that it is okay to die  just because you don't feel well. Things get exagerated over time, this  certin topic, I think will be exagerated.  And people will be droping like  flies!",957139200,6,523,4.232323232323233
