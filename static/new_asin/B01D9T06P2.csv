8755266,3,B01D9T06P2,"The Rock anchors the fault in this film which is saved, barely, by the cataclysmic visuals and not by any of the actors.  Carla Gugino as the Rocks ex-wife feels woefully miscast here and the two have 0 chemistry.  The two reunite and go on a road trip from SoCal up to the Bay Area to save their daughter (who should have been on Baywatch she does so much running and bouncing) amidst the carnage laying waste to California as the San Andreas fault slips and slides and creates mega-quakes.  The sub-plot/ light love interest involving two brothers and Roginos daughter may connect the younger tween and teen set to this flimsy film but will do little to involve adults who will wince at the obviousness of it all.  Will this movie scare the Cali locals into supposedly safer parts of the country?  No, theres so much sun in California that it literally bakes everyones brains (I know because I grew up there).  Will the scenes of massive destruction and the threat of Califor-nigh-A falling into the sea dissuade people from moving there?  Again no because despite the threats everyones rich in California and the sun always shines on TV, if not in this movie.  2.75 stars.",1517529600,,1175,4.642512077294686
