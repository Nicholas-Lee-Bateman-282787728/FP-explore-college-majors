8443970,3,B004VSDZ9A,I thought the book came with this. Looks nice but it is Christmas Gift so I did not open it the entire way. Thank you,1481587200,,117,3.72
8443971,2,B004VSDZ9A,Didn't provide much insight.,1467417600,,28,6.25
8443972,5,B004VSDZ9A,"A wonderful overview of the Nicene Creed, and why it's still significant today.  This is a terrific educational tool, and keeps the viewer's interest from beginning till end.",1432857600,,174,5.214285714285714
8443973,2,B004VSDZ9A,"I had seen a user review that warned me, but I disregarded it and bought this DVD anyway, on the basis of the source (I'm a fairly long-time ROFTER). There's nothing wrong with it, exactly, it's just that it's about as rewarding as a Twinkie. It's catechesis with an MTV aesthetic. I kept waiting for the real presentation to begin, but then it ended. The entire program looks like a movie trailer, constantly cutting back and forth to snippets of dialog from numerous actors, who are never given enough space to be more than tiles in a mosaic constructed by the producer, which ultimately doesn't seem to have much to say. It's boring, just like the trendy marketing models it emulates. The scholars whose interviews were ""sampled"" for this pastiche should have been allowed to present their own strands of thought. Better to let any one of them speak for five minutes than to shoehorn their disjointed words into this tedious faith-infomercial. I'm thoroughly disappointed.",1388534400,12,975,4.915151515151515
8443974,5,B004VSDZ9A,"This is an excellent DVD. It walks through most all of the items addressed in the Creed itself - and in the process provides a good, very high level, introduction to the historic issues of Christianity's early years. You can tell that the people interviewed, most of whom are either academics or clergy, are true believers. They speak with a lot of passion about this topic and about Christianity in general. This DVD would be a welcome addition to any believer's library.",1363910400,5,472,4.7682926829268295
8443975,5,B004VSDZ9A,"This DVD is interesting no matter what faith one ascribes to--it's interesting to people of no faith, as it has an intellectual backbone. Doubt is always present in the faith of an intellectual, and by that I mean anyone with an inquiring mind. Documentaries---the ones that deal with large ideas-- generally have no plot. This one felt like a salon among friends, some of whom are theologians, some philosophers, and some with no particular credentials except that they are thinking, articulate people. The interviews were fascinating, and although many interviewees were quite erudite, the discussion hit just the right notes for anyone with some interest in what Christians believe. I was raised in the tradition, have taught Humanities and know it's a delicate balance to discuss matters of faith, religion and spirituality so that those who have a completely secular view of the world can participate fully. ""First Things"" was involved? More, please.",1329955200,9,955,5.248366013071895
8443976,2,B004VSDZ9A,"Two stars only because of the all-star cast of interviewees.  Otherwise, this DVD is a mess.  If you don't know what the Creed says before you watch this, you won't know afterwards, either.  What could have been an enlightening point-by-point exposition is turned instead into a pastiche of 30-second sound bites from eminent scholars who deserve at least full paragraphs at a time.  There's no plot, no clear progression, just a jumble that lasts for half an hour or so and then ends once it's put you to sleep.
""First Things"" is one of my favorite periodicals, and it's puzzling to me why they produced (or at least allowed themselves to be associated with) such a mediocre product.  If someone gives this to you for free, you may as well watch it.  Otherwise, save your money and spend it instead on a subscription to ""First Things.""",1328054400,10,836,4.691780821917808
8443977,5,B004VSDZ9A,"I enjoyed this presentation very much. It's fast-paced and you have to pay attention. Several of the theologians have accents so some parts take careful listening, but It really stirred my curiosity about what is behind those words we say so often. I've now bought Luke Timothy Johnson's book, ""The Creed.""

It certainly was worth the price and I know many others who will want to see it, so I'll be passing it around my prayer/study group.",1314576000,7,440,4.714285714285714
8443978,5,B004VSDZ9A,"""The Creed: What Christians Profess.."" is an excellent documentary about The Nicene Creed recited in churches around the world. I decided to order this DVD when I heard about it because, after reciting The Creed countless times, I was struck by the fact that I understood little about what I was saying. In this film, each article of the Creed is taken apart and parsed so that I thought about these words in a way that I never had before. As far as the various interviews go, it has something of a star-studded cast from the theological world -- people like Timothy Shriver, Luke Timothy Johnson, John Behr, and Frederica Mathewes-Green. They've got a study class at the Anglican Cathedral I attend downtown and I'm planning to suggest we use this film as a template for study.",1304467200,7,778,4.686131386861314
