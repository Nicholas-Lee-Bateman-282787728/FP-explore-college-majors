968461,4,6305120013,"This was hilarious!

If you are a fan of movies about the ""brotha's and sista's"", this one is for you.

All the actors did a good job.",1163116800,2,134,3.925925925925926
968462,4,6305120013,"I enjoy Rusty Cundieff's works (Tales From the Hood & Fear of A Black Hat) in general, but this movie is not only funny, but romantic & real.  It was one of those movies my wife & i had in common before we even knew each other (this has happened a few times), and we still enjoy reciting the dialogue together every time we watch it.",1163030400,2,333,4.045454545454546
968463,4,6305120013,"There's nothing out there like ""SPRUNG"".It's got romance and comedy all roll into one package. It's definitely a movie to watch any day of the week. The first time I saw this movie,it was on CABLE.I had no idea it was going 2 be this good. Just plain hilarious. I love that Brandy and Montell stayed 2gether despite the fact that their so called friends wanted 2 ruin their relationship when they(Adina and Clyde)found out that  the whole thing was 4 real. And I also love the way Montell talks about how love feels like. Hit me pretty hard. I think that both men and women would appreciate such an art of a movie.",1117929600,2,614,4.385964912280702
968464,4,6305120013,"Sprung is the story of 4 friends Clyde (Joe Torry), Adina (Paula Jai Parker), Brandy (Tisha Campbell)  and Montel (Rusty Cundieff) . Clyde and Adina who are both playas hook up immediately and Adina finds out that Clyde isn't the rich man she thought he was and hilarity ensues (check the scene with Clyde riding on top of Adina's car in only his jockey underwear). Meanwhile against Clyde and Adina's wishes, Brandy and Montel fall in love and are truly happy. Clyde and Adina conspire to break up their friends's happy relationship, accusing the twosome of being ""Sprung"". Overall this is a very sweet romance and it also very funny. I've worn out my video and recently purchased this on DVD and I""m quite happy I did and I think you should get it too!",1079136000,,754,4.5851851851851855
968465,5,6305120013,"An unusual romantic comedy.  If you really look at the plot, the movie could have been written  for individuals of any culture.  I enjoyed how they showed that African Americans not only come in diffrent hues, but different personality/cultural traites. Not all of us who love out culture are hip to the latest slang or want to be. Also, there was not nudity, guns, or violence(a very nice change from the norm).
One of Tisha campbells better roles, the ensemble had great chemistry.  I especially enjoyed the surprize ending.",1067904000,2,526,4.876404494382022
968466,1,6305120013,"The title of my review says it all... one of the all-time classic lines in the history of cinema is in this movie... ""Girl, you know you want deez nutz.""",1046736000,4,153,4.133333333333334
968467,2,6305120013,"Okay, so it wasn't exactly great, but I didn't hate it. Tisha campbell is pretty much playing that same ""Gina"" role  only instead of a wise-cracking homeboy she is this time paired with an artsy type dude. This movie is about the two trying to make love work while their two jealous, and trifling, pals plot to split them up. And that Leonard Maltin review is dead wrong because this movie is NOT about their friends trying to plan a wedding. There is a wedding scene, but that is at the end of the movie and was more of a surprise ending than the central theme.
Cundieff is certainly sincere in his role, but his character was uneven. His turns at trying to be hip and using slang fell flat. But contrasted with the horrible stereotypical performances of Parker and Torrey, I'd say that Cundieff was a welcome respite.
On the whole this movie is worth renting if you just want something very light hearted and silly.",970358400,5,917,4.491017964071856
968468,1,6305120013,this is a sorry attempt of When Harry met Sally.very Predictable.the only film that i have enjoyed Tisha Campbell in was House Party 1 and parts of 2. Joe Torry is a funny Dude but he is always in 3rd tier films.,950659200,,212,4.071428571428571

I first viewed this on VHS when it was released based upon the cover: I saw Tisha Campbell from House Party and Martin as well as Joe Torry from Poetic Justice on the cover, both of whom im fans of and decided to try it out. Funny movie, not Oscar material but great nonetheless..",1484006400,,290,4.196428571428571
968842,3,6305120013,"This is an old movie, but I can relate to all four characters behaviors. Montel and Brandy, falling in love extremely quick and breaking up even quicker. Adina and Clyde getting upset that their friends fell in love. Oldie but goodie.",1482451200,,234,4.7317073170731705

969039,4,6305120013,"O-M-G!  Where do I begin with this film?!  Well, for one, the plot: It's about 4 friends (two guys, two girls) who are in the midst of the dating game.  One claims to be a player (Clyde, played by Joe Torry), while his buddy is more of a straight-up guy (Montell, played by Rusty Cundieff, who's also director); the ladies are a gold digger (Adina, played by Paula Jai Parker), and her rather hopeless-romantic friend (Brandy, played by Tisha Campbell).  Okay, so maybe not the most original.  But what ensues makes for a hilarious film!  The beginning has the two guys happening upon the two ladies at a party, and at first, the would-be couples don't see eye to eye.  But eventually, there's a chance encounter... I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it, but what follows is (at least in my opinion): ONE OF THE MOST HILARIOUS SCENES IN CINEMA!  Now, obviously, this may not be in any AFI or any other ""official"" lists, but I'm sure you all who've seen this movie know which part I'm talking about (lol)!  Anyway, the other couple (Brandy and Montell) eventually fall in love, and the movie actually does a good job of keeping you on edge, unexpectedly throwing you for a loop with a surprise plot twist.  If it weren't for its ""low-budget"" look, I may have even given this 5 stars!  A hilarious (rather interesting) romantic comedy!",1391990400,4,1349,4.556016597510373

969149,5,6305120013,"only 12 yrs late but here goes: luv dis movie. has all the usual aspects of a romantic comedy, plus portrays the wholesome side, and the gritty not so good side, of relationships. I liked Tisha C in Martin, in Sprung she iz more wholesome, but her friend Paula J iz a sexy vamp, golddigger whateva, I just luv her wigs & outfits!  mos def get it, females and males like it",1275955200,2,372,4.166666666666667

969151,5,6305120013,"If you are African-American and like romantic comedies that have a good character base, then this movie is for you. The central story is around 2 people and their friends. The two main characters are what makes this movie a nice strong and positive movie for African-Americans, while the two side characters are what bring the slapstick comedy in all of its forms.

Overall, the movie is warm and close and has many things to offer that most people don't believe a movie of its caliber could posses. This is the type of movie that can be picked from the shelf at any time and in any circle and watched. Ladies, does your man typically hate romantic movies? Well, you're in luck cause this is the movie that will keep him in his seat.

Whatever justice this review cannot do for the movie, I leave with this; BUY THIS MOVIE, YOU WONT REGRET IT.

Fun film about a couple who gets together having nothing but love for each other but their friends do everything in their power to try and break them up simply because they can't stand each other and realize: the more the lovey dovey couple spends time together, it eventually means so do they and they're willing to do whatever it takes to keep that from happening no matter what.",1496361600,,398,4.541666666666667
