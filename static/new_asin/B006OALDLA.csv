5008945,4,B006OALDLA,"The film opens with some beautiful scenery and music. It lulls you into believing this is going to be a classic western.

A British woman (Inge Rademeyer) travels out west to live with her uncle. In route she is kidnapped by a quiet gun slinging murdering cowboy (Cohen Holloway) who attempts to rape her, but realizes he is not functional. The cowboy drags her around the countryside seeking a cure for his ""broken"" manhood.

Our woman who is refined and educated provides a stark contrast to the overly stereotyped slow talking dim witted cowboys. As the two characters get to know each other we expect the predictable Stockholm Syndrome to set in when things take a slight twist. It is an interesting and unconventional western. It has action, drama, and humor. Clever, but not spectacular.

PARENTAL GUIDE: No f-bombs, no sex, rape-like scenes, male rear nudity (Cohen Holloway)",1342396800,17,882,4.945945945945946
5008946,4,B006OALDLA,"I liked ""Good for Nothing"". I thought it was going to a formula C list movie. It was more than worth the time to watch it. The script was well thought out and acted quite well.",1341446400,2,176,3.9166666666666665
5008947,5,B006OALDLA,"I read the review quotes on the cover-art of this DVD and laughed...  they were either bland or outlandish... even comparing it to ""Unforgiven"".

The second that the movie ended, I literally said ""wow"".  And immdiately it is obvious, the dialogue, acting, seriousness, tone, musical score, scenery, realism, originality and more, were ON-PAR, if not above almost any western I can think of... even, (gasp) Unforgiven.

I was drawn in to the professionalism of the production... atention to every detail was given, cinematography and locations shot were amazingly beautiful yet harsly barren, the characters were impeckable, the sincerety, drama, details, everything.  This movie really brings home the true dangers of those lawless times.  Everything in this movie is not only believable, but draws you in, and puts you right there with the characters.  This is REALISM at it's best.

I applaud the producers and directors for making a modern day western that isn't a hollywood shootem'up, or re-hash of a half-popular old western.  This movie will have your heart pounding, leave your jaw dropped, and put tears in your eyes.  There is suspense and surprises all along the way.  Well done, casual pace, but not a single boring moment.  THIS is how I envision the wild west must have really been like.

This should be a western everyone should see.. I know you will be impressed... too bad this didn't have a marketing budget for the big screen... then again, I know what big money does to westerns, so I'm glad the production was left alone.  It's AWSOME!  A++++",1337040000,15,1563,4.980694980694981
5008948,5,B006OALDLA,"I'll be the first to admit I'm not huge on Westerns, but I was lucky enough to see this at the NZ premiere in Wellington, and I was completely sold!  It's a great film, with a perfect blend of dry humor, drama, and adventure.  The scenery of NZ is the perfect Wild West stand-in, and the thrilling music combined with the well crafted cinematography make the aesthetics of this film worth the price of admission alone.  But all the acting is solid and the direction is carefully handled, all making for a perfect all around adventure.  What's more is how impressive it is that this was made 100% independently, and funded out of pocket, yet it is in every way a feature film that holds up with any other major studio release.  I can't recommend it higher!",1335484800,2,755,4.481751824817518
5008949,2,B006OALDLA,"""This is not the place you read about in books, this is no place for a lady."" Isabella Montgomery (Rademeyer) is new to town. Against everyone's wishes she moved and wishes to start her life in the wild western town. While out on her own a cowboy (Holloway) sees her and attempts to have his way with her. Frustrated when he isn't able to, he decides to kidnap her and keep her until he is able to function again. This is another in the long list of unimpressive and drawn out westerns. I'm not sure what happened to this genre but why is it so hard to make a good one anymore? Unlike most of the recent entries this one isn't really cheesy, just seems to have no point. The closest I can come to thinking what the plot is is a cowboy tries to rape a strange woman...then they start to fall in love. Not really sure what else was going on but I was really bored with this one. I am still waiting for a good western to come out. To me ""Open Range"" was the last good one. Overall, drawn out and boring, much like the last 10 or so westerns that have come out. I give it a C-.",1332633600,4,1073,4.042253521126761
5008950,5,B006OALDLA,"This movie has the elements and magic of a classic John Wayne movie. Directed by Mike Wallis, this kiwi western, filmed in the heart of New Zealand, is a wonderful film. The acting and setting of the movie is highly realistic, a great homage to the original western movies. Cohen Holloway and Inge Rademeyer make a wonderful acting duo, complimenting each other in their acting styles. The movie shows some great scenery which looks like the real unspoiled Old West. Another great element brought to this movie is the wonderful score, written by John Psathas. The music ties together the movie in a great way making Good for Nothing an instant classic.",1331769600,26,652,4.830357142857143

I've watched it several times now, and I enjoy it more now than I did at first. I thought it was a senseless movie the first time I saw it, as I had trouble understanding the dialog.

Plus, this has one of the finest musical scores I have ever heard for an independent, and immediately ordered a copy from the composer's website.

5009021,2,B006OALDLA,"I'll admit, I'm not a fan of Westerns overall, but I really do like films such as ""Jeremiah Johnson.""  Naturally, however, when you have an actor such as Robert Redford, you should be able to make a very good movie.  Even if it is just a western.

And I didn't intend to watch this drivel-fest, but it was on ""free"" TV, and unfortunately it was on television today -- on the same channel in which my HD box was already set -- and more unfortunately, I didn't change channels.  It was probably that I was simply too lazy.

I thought at first that this film starred Jennifer Connelly, but unfortunately that suspect Academy Award-winning actress is not in this film.  Or is that fortunately?  Either way, I guess the ""star"" here is Inge Rademeyer, but no matter.  No one could have saved this disaster, even an ""Oscar winner"" such as Ms. Connelly.  The writing is probably more atrocious than the acting, but I may be splitting hairs.  And the director surely wasn't far behind.

Everything is manipulative:  the situations; the music; you name it.  And so I'll have to recommend the following:  when something calls itself ""Good for Nothing,"" take it at its word.  And steer clear, or maybe better yet, spit out that chewin' tabacca, yell ""Giddyap,"" and get that horse o' yours movin' in the other direction.

The gun fights were well done with more misses then hits, the gritty reality of how women could be treated if found alone and unprotected, all on display in this movie, even the hero leaves a lot to be desired when compared to even a western like Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"". this is the best western since ""Appaloosa"".

5009025,4,B006OALDLA,"I really liked this film but I'm a geezer and I loved the great black comedies that have sadly gone out of style: the Alec Guinness films of the early 1950s, ""Dr. Strangelove,"" ""Catch 22,"" ""Being There"" and the all-time champ ""The Loved One.""

A black comedy takes realistic situations (the opening scenes lull you into believing this will be a classic Western) and realistic characters and stretches them to absurd conclusions. Some of the reviewers here show they tried to take this film as a serious ""High Noon"" type of western and dissed it because it wasn't: ""There's not enough words"" (there were exactly enough).

Look: The gunfighter (Cohen Holloway) kidnaps the pretty Englishwoman (Inge Rademeyer) and takes her out on the prairie to rape her. He tries but he can't get it up. THAT scene right there should have been your signal because it set the tone for the whole rest of the movie. So, dragging her along, he begins a quest to find a cure (for you younger viewers, Viagra didn't come along until more than 100 years later), consulting MDs, Chinese herbal doctors, an Indian medicine man, all the while being pursued by a very inept posse with a leader so dumb he shoots his scout (""I said I was a scout. I didn't say I was any good at it."") and the posse then becomes hopelessly lost.

The final big gunfight between the gunfighter (who has by now won the sympathy of both Inge and the audience) and the posse members (who, after rescuing the girl now want to rape her) hits a hilarious snag when all of the participants run out of ammunition at exactly the same time.

It's black comedy, people, and a very good one! Even Larry McMurtry didn't have the guts to tackle ED on the Frontier! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1373760000,27,1721,4.577922077922078

5009030,4,B006OALDLA,"i don't like traditional westerns because the characters always seem so one dimensional. i have to admit though that starting with 'unforgiven' there have been quite a few that have broken out of the usual stereotype.

this is one of those films. overall i really enjoyed it; it was quirky and funny and the shootouts were probably more accurate to the times than any i've seen. someone else here mentioned that it was unrealistic that isabelle would be walking round in her knickers and i concur with that. she would have been embarassed and humiliated and try to cover up at every opportunity.

the chemistry between the two leads was steamy, however i thought that she ended up being kind of a bitch. no he was no saint but it was obvious that he loved her and he protected her. his e.d. was plainly due to the fact that she was more to him than just a shag.

without giving it away, i thought that the ending was ultimately unsatisfying, that is why i did not give it a five star.",1367280000,4,984,4.425414364640884
5009031,5,B006OALDLA,This is a great film! Complex in its simplicity. The attention to detail in caricature development and filmmaking is wonderful. Besides falling in love with Inge Rademeyer I was intrigued by nearly every actor in this film. You get a sense that there is much more going on then meets the eye. Everyone who was part of this film deserves credit. Thank you for the treat Good for Nothing.,1365897600,2,386,4.608695652173913

5009038,5,B006OALDLA,It was a low budget film done in New Zeland (i think) With the low budget there were some things that did not measure up to hollywood mega films but. It was extremely well done and not overly verbose. The humor was subtle. I loved it.,1351209600,7,234,4.108695652173913
5009039,5,B006OALDLA,"I have always loved a good western, especially in the style of Quigley Down Under and any Clint Eastwood western.

5009040,2,B006OALDLA,"It's hard to review this movie because I didn't hate it but it had a lot of issues. It was okay to watch even though it was a bit slow but I enjoyed the characters and the scenery was nice but to me there just wasn't enough happening.

The movie starts off with a bang. Isabelle is kidnapped by The Man and taken off into the desert where he tries to rape her. He can't because he has ED but instead of letting Isabelle go, he drags her along with him to a lot of meaningless spots and destinations as he tries to find a cure for his ED so he can finally get it on with Isabelle.

The plot was definitely different from most westerns but there wasn't enough going on. Once Isabelle and The Man started on their journey the film comes to a standstill. The Man doesn't even speak to Isabelle until twenty minutes after the movie is on and he doesn't say a word for the first ten minutes so you wonder if he's a mute or if something else is wrong. Then all of a sudden The Man murders the sheriff's brother or son or whatever so the sheriff and his gang spend 90 minutes galloping across the desert to find The Man and Isabelle. This part seemed just thrown in because the writer realized there wasn't enough going on.

It's like the writer just ran out of ideas. He had the basic plot but with tons of empty space which ends up making the movie unnecessary.

I couldn't get Isabelle. She didn't act frightened in the least. She only tried to get away from The Man about twice then gave up. I understand she was in the desert but wouldn't she try her best to get away? It was so unrealistic. I couldn't understand how emotionless this woman was. People get shot around her and she doesn't shed a tear or show any fear. The Man tries to rape her and she isn't even shaken up! What does she do? She ends up traipsing (looked like willingly) around with her almost-rapist draped in her underwear. This is when my eyes rolled into the back of my head. Back in those days women didn't even show their undies to their husbands. A woman (especially one as prim and proper as Isabelle) would never have walked around half-naked with a man who not only she didn't know but that tried to rape her. Where was her fear? She acted like she was on a picnic. She wasn't terrified at all. I didn't understand that.

I also don't understand why this is classified as a romance. There was nothing romantic between the two. The Man just wants to rape Isabelle and Isabelle hates him. Where is this romance? Sure they ""kinda"" bond at the end of the film but then it's over. There wasn't any obvious signs of a romance brewing especially on Isabelle's end. She keeps the same scowl on her face when she speaks to The Man that she had when he first took her. So the romance is lost on me. I wish the movie had spent more time on building a romance (even though it would've been weird)than having these two ride around mindlessly with no point.

Also I have an issue with how the men are depicted in this film. I'm a woman but I was still kinda offended. This movie makes all men look like barbaric rapists. Every single man Isabelle encountered except three tried to rape her. I found it ridiculous. Sure back in western days you had men who preyed on women but this was just too much. I could buy The Man stealing her away and trying to rape her, fine. But after that it became tedious. Even the deputy tried to rape her! It just didn't make sense and was just offensive. I can't see how any man who watches this movie wouldn't see that fact.

I thought the acting was well done but there needed to be more action and more things happening besides The Man riding around to cure his ED for 90 minutes.

And the next time this writer/director wants to make a romance he needs to make sure it actually is one.",1345939200,3,3782,4.250347705146036

8501787,5,B006OALDLA,"I just watched this yesterday and wasn't expecting anything.  But man, this is a really good movie, an independent film at that. It kind of reminds me of the Clint Eastwood westerns like Unforgiven and Josey Wales with lots of dry, funny humor interspersed with pretty violent scenes.  It opens when a prim and proper English woman fresh of the boat from the UK, gets kidnapped by an outlaw gunfighter on the way to her uncle's ranch. This happens within five minutes into the film and defines the lawless land of the wild west. The story goes from there. The outlaw tries to ""poke"" the kidnapped woman but he can't get it up and spends his journey searching for a cure with the woman on the horse with him and a bunch of really bad dudes on their tail.  What I like about this is the growth/change that happens to both characters. While their relationship is antagonistic, it turns symbiotic towards the end for the sake of survival as they are confronted by zinging bullets, whizzing arrows, and the lawless ruffians chasing them.  Lots of shootouts in this film, but they are not gratuitous. Some of them are actually comical. The cinematography is excellent.  I thought it was filmed in Southern Utah but it was actually filmed in kiwi land (New Zealand).  The music score is excellent too. Good chemistry between newcomer Inge Rademeyer and Cohen Holbrook.  5 big stars for this indie film.",1517788800,,1395,4.692622950819672
