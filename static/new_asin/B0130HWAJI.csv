7359751,3,B0130HWAJI,"Just received this new release in Sep of 2015.  The picture quality is quite awful.  It's as if it were filmed with a dirty lense.  In fact it looks as if it were recorded from a screen projector.  The only reason it's given 3 stars is it is a classic production.  The sound quality is also very poor.  If this is truly the best recording of Mary Martin's classic recording, it is a real tragity.",1441756800,4,396,4.213333333333333
7359752,5,B0130HWAJI,"Mary Martin enjoyed performing on live TV, and it shows time and time again in this wonderful 1956 ""Peter Pan,"" the second live version (1955 was the first) of this beloved musical. The standard color ""Peter Pan"" from 1960 was filmed in a studio in segments when Martin was starring in ""The Sound Of Music"" on Broadway. In this DVD, Mary Martin is totally engaged, and it is a thrill to watch Mary and her co-star Cyril Ritchard at the height of their respective careers. Jerome Robbins directed this live TV performance, as well as the Broadway show that came first. It may be the closest anyone has gotten to actually bringing Broadway to TV. The booklet says that 65,000,000 people watched this program on NBC. They made the right choice.

Again this is in black and white, rather than color. The songs are excellent, although the three best are in the first hour.  And the story sags a bit in Acr 2, but it's a minor problem. We finally have the original musical version of ""Peter Pan"" with one Broadway's greatest stars leading the way!",1441670400,24,1041,4.591397849462366

The only reason why I am giving it 2 stars, is because I was deceived when buying it. I grew up with it in color, and this one is only in black and white. I understand that is the times back then, but when you're expecting it in color (like the way you grew up with), it can be a huge disappointment when you end up with something not expected.",1502323200,,463,3.783505154639175

However, besides that it was PERFECT!!! My aunt was the one who made me fall in love with Mary Martin as Peter Pan. She video taped it on TV for me to watch over & over again when I would go stay at her house.

It's evenm more surprising, in that the DVD ends by saying that it was shot in ""compatible color.""  I'm aware that most of us that tuned in saw the play in B/W, however, the color master has to exist, so why no color is a shock.
Of course, seeing the best Peter Pan cast takes some of the sting away.",1498521600,,434,3.9770114942528734

But I remembered that I had a VCR version I bought 20 years ago, but never played. Well on unpacking my Christmas stuff, I found it and stuck it in my old VCR Player just to see if it was interesting. And low & behold it was in color and very nice and clear and the sound was as good as to be expected from a VCR tape.. It was produced out by an a company called Goodtimes.
Now I'm wondering why this colored version could not have been included in this newer set!
For the price I originally paid for it - they should have. So if any of you folks still has their ole' VCR up & running I would advise you to try to get a color version on Goodtimes VCR version if you can find it.",1480723200,,941,4.037433155080214

This is not the slick, color, remake for TV from 1960. This is the energetic, original Broadway cast in their final performance together as the Broadway run had just ended.  It's funny and sweet and nave and exhilarating, as Peter Pan should be. The music is wonderful.
The script is a little different from the later versions. It has technical flaws - as many 1956 live productions did.
Mary Martin won the Emmy and Cyril Richard was nominated, both for this version, not the later one.",1462233600,,672,4.694915254237288

There are some variances in performers from the version I know (the children were recast for the 1960 broadcast since they were no longer children) but Mary Martin and Cyril Ritchard both deliver the same amazing performances I remember. The picture is a bit blurry on the edges, and it is in black and white, so if that bothers you then you should probably find a DVR rip of the VHS version instead.

7359818,5,B0130HWAJI,"The first broadcast ever of Peter Pan was heart-stopping to recall in all its black-and-white glory. I was five-years-old when Mary Martin flew into my life, in an NBC telecast version of Peter Pan. It was a big, much-anticipated, national event, termed by the media ""a TV special."" I didn't know anything about it, but my parents were excited for me and my brother to see it. We waited all week. Then, BAM. It blew my head off! Everything about it was wonderful--the story, the characters, the adventure, the special effects. Okay, so it was a flickering light. ""Clap, if you want Tinkerbell to live."" At 5, I was being told I held the power of life and death in my hands.

But most of all, in that magical moment, I fell in love with music and theater. I'd never been to a play, never heard a Broadway score, never experienced music married to words. It was the gayest moment of my young life, and I knew after seeing it, I wasn't the same. I was older, wiser, my spirit set free. Even the gender-flex aspect of a girl playing a boy only added to my realization that nothing was impossible.

Since television repeats had yet to be invented, the airing of Peter Pan came and was gone. Then--miracle of miracles--a year later, NBC did it again! There I sat, reveling all over in the music, the dance, and the out-sized spectacle. Both versions are included in this set--the first a bit better, but that's my nostalgia talking.

I never hear those songs without recalling the night when the world showed itself to me and I was transformed forever.  Craig Bennett Hallenstein, Author of THE DOLPHIN",1457568000,6,1596,4.56993006993007

The 1955 broadcast  contains blocking more similar to the stage production. It doesn't necessarily suit the video medium well. The changes made the following year are obvious. Most pronounced for me was the blocking of Never Never Land.

7359844,5,B0130HWAJI,"With the wildly successful first DVD release of the 1960 color videotaping of the definitive musical version of PETER PAN now long out of print, it is a pity that these producers could not get the rights to include it with these first two airings of the classic show for a near perfect release (the embarrassing recent NBC ""live"" version is out on DVD but best forgotten). These two early (1955 and 56) airings are must-haves for any theatre lover or PETER PAN fan. The first, filmed only a few days after the Broadway production closed to prepare for the Broadcast, is probably still the most exciting. These ARE the Original Broadway Performances flawed only by one minor technical lighting gaff shortly after ""Peter's"" first entrance (at a transition where we are to see his/her shadow). The second airing (shown as this release's MAIN feature because they fixed the lighting glitch in the first airing) not even a year later is essentially the same production and the performances are very close - Cyril Ritchard is still playing Hook basically straight and not camping it us as much as he did in 1960, but a couple of the children have grown out of their roles and been replaced. The original broadcasts were in RCA's ""compatible color"" system but, in the days before videotape, could only be preserved in black & white kinescope (filmed from a TV screen). As well as some of these great early kinescopes have been colorized for more recent broadcast (the 15 November 1959 Hallmark Hall of Fame broadcast of Ibsen's A DOLL'S HOUSE with Julie Harris especially), one can only hope that this release does well enough to justify someone's restoring these broadcasts to a semblance of the color they were originally broadcast in. Failing that, this release should be a ""must have"" for anyone who loves the work.",1446768000,4,1812,4.810897435897436

And Mary Martin is unforgettable. Even if it's in black-and-white and a kinescope it's still great. Better than Cathy Rigby's, better than ""Peter Pan Live!"" and even, in some ways, the Disney version. It's the best version of ""Peter Pan"" out there.

7359848,5,B0130HWAJI,"Watching this - so-far only the 1956 broadcast - I was transported back to the magic of this broadcast.  I briefly had thoughts like, ""Why is Tiger Lily blond?"" or ""Cyril Ritchard is really not a very fierce pirate - none of them are.""  But I soon realize this is all about childhood fantasy.  We watch because we, like Pan, don't want to grow up.  How wonderful to see minimal special effects create more than the new movie did with a much steeper budget.  The children, Indians, and Pirates are all first-rate.  Ritchard is so pristine (or is that Priss-teen) as Hook, but he takes us along on the journey in ways Christopher Walken (of the newer telecast) can't even imagine.  The text makes sense and is fun.  Silly at times, too, but fun!!!
What Mary Martin does, however, is amazing.  When she sings ""Never-neverland"" we feel the longing, whimsy, and ebullience of childhood.  How wonderful.  And when she has fun - the shadow ballet, or ""I gotta crow"" we believe strongly in her as being Peter Pan.  Even the 1960 color tape can't equal this for spirit, fun, and the kind of magic Broadway (and TV) can produce when it sets its mind to it.  Oh, and Ritchard also plays Mr. Darling, as indeed he should.",1445385600,4,1209,4.516129032258065

7359850,4,B0130HWAJI,"Peter Pan was television history.  Live performances in front of gigantic audiences (65 million viewers).  The concocted live events today (Sound of Music, Peter Pan) were tense, unpolished by comparison.  This disc includes both the 1955 and 1956 broadcasts, captured on kinescope, though unfortunately only in black and white (they were broadcast in color).  A separate company released the 1960 taped version several years ago.  All 3 are remarkable.  The 1960 is a bit more spectacular, the Wendy bedroom is somewhat larger, etc..  Still, the performances are amazingly consistant.  My impression is that 1955 is the most smoothly sung, for both Mary Martin and Cyril Ritchard; the 1956 may be the most inspired and highest energy overall.  Martin's flying has a real athletic abandon that night.  1960 is very polished.  This performance was taped in sections late at night, while Mary Martin was performing Sound of Music on Broadway.  They still are performing ""live"", that is, no dubbing and actually flying and singing with a live orchestra,  However, the idea was to immortalize the performance for repeat broadcasts.  Tape, however, was still pretty primitive, so the quality is iffy.  The 1955 and 1956 kinescope are what they are - hardly hi-def.  Still, they may be close to what television actually looked like back then.  It is a pity the 1960 wasn't filmed, ala the I LOVE LUCY shows, instead of taped.  However, Disney had the film rights to Peter Pan and even that would have been a violation.  If you already have 1960, it may be the overall best for produxtion, smoothness, color (dim, but still..), a delightful Michael.  If you really love Mary Martin, Peter Pan and television history, then it is great to have this disc as well as the 1960.",1445212800,4,1765,4.959044368600683
7359851,5,B0130HWAJI,"As in the 1960 color video recording of Peter Pan, these two earlier broadcasts feature an exuberant Mary Martin in her favorite role, Cyril Ritchard having a lovely time in the traditionally doubled role of Mr. Darling/Captain Hook and Sondra Lee as the pert Tiger Lily.
But although the earlier kinescoped recordings lack the color of their original airings, the live 1956 and 1955 broadcasts more than make up for it with an energy and buoyancy that truly demonstrate why Mary Martin as Peter Pan was such a legendary triumph for NBC.
The January 9, 1956 broadcast is the primary feature of the Blu-Ray disc and would be a prized treasure on its own.  Having most of the original Broadway cast and refinements in TV camera work and lighting, it has the freshness of a live on-air performance and a good deal of the magic that must have been in the original stage production of the previous year.
But there is the added treat of the March 7, 1955 live telecast which aired less than two weeks after the end of the original Broadway run.  The lighting is sometimes darker than in 1956 and the camera work is somewhat different - being sometimes tentative, occasionally daring and a few time accidentally letting us see activity off the set, but the first-time enthusiasm and wonder of the whole experience shines through in a way that makes it an essential recording for both Theater and TV enthusiasts.
Fans will also enjoys the added treats of the 1955 NBC sales promotion for and a recent interview with Heller Halliday; Mary Martins daughter and the original Liza on stage and in the 1955 and 1956 broadcasts.",1445126400,,1614,4.719858156028369

The kinescope has been improved as best as it could have been, but it is still a kinescope.  After five minutes, thet is irrelevant.  What we have are the Peter Pan for Forever, a wonderfully delicious Captain Hook in Cyril Richard, and a simply wonderful score.  Watching Mary Martin perform live, always interacting even when silent, having the time of her life, leads us to have the time of our lives.

7359854,5,B0130HWAJI,"This Mary Martin version of ""Peter Pan"" is magnificent. At last on DVD and Blu-ray too. I hardly remember the original National TV broadcast, but this is a terrific nostalgic reminder. And it'd a great trip in the past of how TV was 'back in the day'.  I have seen the remakes including the recent one with Allison Williams and Christopher Walken which was excellent with HD color and much technical inprovements, but without this older 1955-56 versions there wouldn't be any updated versions. Everything is progress-right!
Mary Martin was a STAR of the Golden Age of Hollywood and the Broadway stage and she gave her all as Peter Pan.
This DVD has the first 1955 telecast and the 1956 versions. Of course when they were televised they were in color. These are Kinescope black and white versions. The only complaint I have is why did they not think of colorizing at least one of these versions? A lot of people don't like colorized films, but I think their okay. And I believe colorizations have been vastly improved.  I have the Blu-ray version of this one and I realize they can only improve such dated material just so much here, Blu-ray or not, but it is still nice to have this wonderful Peter Pan available to the public.",1444780800,6,1227,4.623853211009174

7359856,4,B0130HWAJI,"For a generation of theatre-goers, Mary Martin WAS Peter Pan. Fortunately, her production was captured on live TV in 1955 and again in 1956. This is a kinescope of the live 1956 TV broadcast. Most of the same cast reassembled in 1960 to record the show one last time, this time on videotape for posterity. The 1960 color taped show was rebroadcast several times through 1974. The 1960 version came and went quickly on VHS in 1989. I managed to convert that VHS to DVD before my machine broke down. It is interesting to compare the 1956 live show with the 1960 videotape. Mary Martin and her co-star Cyril Ritchard don't vary their performances much from 1956 to 1960. And yes, the 1960 version is in color. But that was filmed in a studio in segments. I'll take the 1956 live kinescope version any day. Why? Because this version captures the ENERGY AND EXCITEMENT of a live performance!!
  I have a theatre background, and I love the energy and excitement of live performances. For those who say, ""I don't like this. It's a black and white kinescope. I don't want to watch it"", that is YOUR problem, and you should get over it, because you are missing out on something wonderful. This version has REAL THEATRE MAGIC. Of course, there are a few drawbacks. Mary Martin and Cathleen Nolan as Wendy perform the first portion of ""I've Got To Crow"" practically in the dark, and the flying ballet is difficult to see. But these setbacks are minor.
  Mary Martin is obviously having the time of her life as Peter Pan. She sparkles and shines, and pulls off the neat trick of being neither masculine or feminine, boy or girl, or child or adult. Her Peter Pan is, appropriately, the sprite or spirit of ""youth, joy and freedom."" Mary Martin is the star, but Cyril Ritchard steals the show as Captain Hook. Most importantly, Martin and Ritchard play together --and with each other-- and have fun!! This quality was sorely and noticeably lacking in NBC's mirthless but ""oh so politically correct"" and overlong 2014 production, where a bizarrely disconnected Christopher Walken as Captain Hook couldn't even be bothered with connecting with Allison Williams as Peter Pan, or any of his other co-stars, for that matter.
  The petite Cathy Rigby enchanted  the next, and different, generation as Peter Pan. Rigby's production was both similar and different-- and equally wonderful. This 1956  live broadcast transports back to a different time and place; when audiences were decidedly less jaded and cynical, and willing to believe in magic and fun for a bit longer. As a response to NBC'S successes with ""Peter Pan"", CBS engaged Rodgers and Hammerstein to write a musical ""Cinderella"" for Julie Andrews in 1957, and Alfred Drake brought an abridged version of ""Kiss Me, Kate"" to NBC in 1958. The kinescopes of both these productions are also available on DVD. Sadly, those days of ""magical Broadway"" are long gone. And we, as audiences, are much the poorer for the loss.",1444608000,22,2956,4.793713163064833

Yes, compared to the recent NBC spectacular, these B&W performances look dated and crude, but their magic is incomparable.  These performances are better than the one recorded in 1960 - more spontaneous and more captivating.  Above all, Mary Martin is wondrous, warm and completely irresistible. Ritchard is hilarious (and a bit sinister). This release is a fantastic blessing for us nostalgic baby boomers, but it's also an important release for anyone interested in American theater.  Mary Martin's star power is nowhere better displayed than here.",1443916800,3,666,5.427184466019417
7359860,5,B0130HWAJI,"I was first introduced to the musical version of Peter Pan in 1960, the year of the first broadcast of the video-taped version. Prior to that it had been telecast live in 1955 with the original Broadway cast and again in 1956 with most of the same cast intact except for some of the children who had grown too tall.
Peter Pan was first introduced at the Duke of Yorks Theatre in London in 1904 where it played annually during the Christmas holiday seasons before going on tour of the provinces. In fact, J. M. Barries classic play continued as a yearly visitor to the London stage basically in its original format until the early seventies except for two years during World War II.  In the United States, Maude Adams played the role in 1905 and revisited the part off and on for the next twelve years. In 1929, Eve Le Gallienne added the play to her Civic Theatre Repertory Company with great success and Jean Arthur was acclaimed for her portrayal on Broadway in 1950. Interestingly, a decade before, Arthur and her close friend, Mary Martin, would take turns dressing as Peter at Hollywood masquerade parties where they shared their desire the play the part on stage. While Arthur beat Martin to the punch in a beautiful production with music by Leonard Bernstein, Mary Martins version, directed by Jerome Robbins, not only became an instant classic of the stage with a best-selling original cast album it also became a television classic when it was presented live in 1955, after the limited Broadway run.
The musical with a score by Carolyn Leigh and Mark Moose Charlap encountered many problems during its inception in California until the New York opening in 1954; one being that Cyril Ritchard and Sondra Lee received greater notices than its star. Some of the songs, I Wont Grow Up, I Gotta Crow, and Flying were exceptional while others merely serviced the book. Enter composer Jule Styne with lyricists Betty Comden and Adolph Green who recognized instantly that the role of Peter could become Marys best role on Broadway. They augmented the score with their version of Never Never Land in addition to Captain Hooks Waltz, Oh, My Mysterious Lady, and other delights. Mary Martin had the final word whether the musical would reach New York, for which she gave a thumbs up. Perhaps, more significantly, a deal was also reached with N.B.C. to limit the run in New York so that the play could be aired on television.
The two live presentations met with much fanfare as did the 1960 video-taped version.  It was rebroadcast a few more times and in the early eighties, when a slightly edited version that cut out Heller Hallidays ballet as Liza the maid entering Never Neverland was aired, it won the highest ratings of the year for N.B.C. Shortly after, the video was released uncut on home video in the form of VHS tapes and laser discs, followed shortly after on DVD. Looking better than ever, the DVD quickly went out of print and now commands up to $200 except for pirated versions which you may also find on eBay for twenty bucks or so. But what about the kinescopes of the first two telecasts?
Over the years I have purchased the two live broadcast versions of Peter Pan in various formats but all suffered in video and audio clarity. Rumors persisted that one company or another was going to officially release them but I gave up all hope a few years ago. Then, last week, while searching eBay for a Christmas gift (I buy all year round) I discovered that the 1955 and 1955 telecasts were released by VAI, a company responsible for introducing other great musical comedy television specials from the past. The programs were called specials because thats what they were, special! And indeed, the DVD of Peter Pan that I just received in the mail from Amazn.com is indeed special. While suffering from the technology of the periodkinescopes were black and white films created by filming the telecast monitors in the studio during the actual performances resulting in unfocused edges of the screen and occasional horizontal wavesthe elements for this transfer are far superior to any I have seen in the last twenty years. The picture quality of both versions is quite good, better than many other kinescopes of the period, while the audio is surprisingly excellent.
Unknowingly, I ordered the regular DVD version from Amazon.com thinking I was getting the two broadcasts plus supplemental materials that I had read about in the reviews. I immediately ordered the Blu-ray version for a few more dollars. Each comes with an insert that includes photos and excellent notes by George Dansker, from which I was surprised to learn that there were even intentions of performing another live broadcast in March of 1958. However, Dansker errors in his assertion that Peter Pan made history as the first Broadway musical to be transferred intact to the television screen, directly from its theatrical run. The musical was advertised as the complete version but it was adapted for television with a few minor cuts in the script, notably, the very funny Hamlet story, fine piece of funny business written by Comden and Green, as told by Wendy and a shortened version of Mary Martin singing Never Never Land.
I find it rather curious that the DVD offers not the first telecast of Peter Pan but instead boasts its 1956 edition as the historic telecast. Really? The 1955 telecast was the historic first. However, judging from my past viewings of the three versions of this television classic and watching then again this weekend, I do find that this second version is the best! True, it is not in color but the performances are delightful and fresh with most of the kinks of the first telecast solved. Compare Flying in both kinescope versions and you will see what I mean.  And then there is Kathy Nolan, giving a far superior performance as Wendy than her predecessor, Maureen Bailey, and Sondra Lee as the cutest Tiger Lily on the block.
The Blu-ray version also includes a rare N.B.C. telesales promo which was telecast live and in color for the closed circuit televisions of the sponsors and N.B.C. affiliates. In the short, we hear from the N.B.C. president, Mary Martin, Peter Foy (who created the flying effects), and best of all, Cyril Ritchard, who not only changes into Captain Hook on camera, but also performs a number from the show. Then there is a sweet but too short interview with Heller Halliday, the daughter of Mary Martin and co-producer Richard Halliday, not to mention sister of Larry Hagman, who reminisces about working with her mother.
But the real reason for purchasing the DVD  or Blu-ray is Mary Martin, giving an extraordinary performance worthy of its legendary reputation, finally captured to be played ver and over again. There have been other performances in the productions of Peter Pan that have gone down as legend, notably Nina Boucicaults in 1904; Pauline Chase for about 14 years starting in 1906; and Jean Forbes-Robertson in the late twenties and early thirties who can also be heard in a 1940 recording on HMV records as well as a Sepia Records CD; Eve Le Gallienne was featured in a radio performance preserved at the Library of Congress, and Jean Arthur on two different Columbia Records original cast albums. We are so fortunate to have a permanent record of the musical version Peter Pan, as close to the original performed on Broadway as possible. The beautifully produced Blu-ray should prove of great interest, not only for baby boomers, but also for theatre historians and those who love musical comedy at its best.

7359861,5,B0130HWAJI,"I have to say some things about this flick.  But first, the recording of it (picture) was the worst I've ever seen in any DVD.  But after about a half hour or so, either I was used to it or it improved, but it was fine and stayed fine.  I think Mary Martin  was wonderful.  Like a true artist, you could see she was not just acting her part, she was living it.  Like Julie Harris in ""Belle Of Amherst"" who actually cried when her character did.  And I cried in only two places - when Martin sang ""Distant Melody"" (that song is so beautiful) and during the epilogue with a grown up Wendy.  Mary Martin's daughter is supposed to have been in it, so I guess she plays the maid who also goes to Never Land.  Only if so, she seems to have been much too old to be Martin's daughter.  I usually dislike Mary Martin (too coy and cute), but she was wonderful in this.  I have the version with Kathy Rigby, and I would like it more than this except Hook in that flick is the meanest thing I have ever seen - he could be Jack the Ripper.  Ritchard (in keeping with everything else about the show) makes a loveable fun Hook.  I have the other Mary Martin version and I remember it being a better recording all the way around.

7359864,5,B0130HWAJI,"This review is for the VAI *Blu-ray* edition containing the *black and white kinescopes* of the original 1955 and 1956 LIVE broadcasts. While the text and the adult actors are the same here as they were in the much better known 1960 color videotape, the energy of the performances far surpasses the later version... making the dramatic drop in picture quality an acceptable trade-off (ideally we'd have all three, but presumably they are controlled by different ""rights holders"" so I can't blame VAI for this... beside, I still have my GoodTimes DVD of the color version, so I'm in good shape).

The 1956 broadcast is presented as the main feature which I thought was rather foolish at first (the 1955 broadcast was presented right after the Broadway run, so it includes all the original children actors as well as the momentum from the original staging), but after comparing the two, I think VAI made the right decision. Almost everything about the 1956 broadcast is cleaner and more confident... almost as if the 1955 broadcast were the ""try-out."" I still think Mary Martin, herself, is at her best in the 1955... she got a little more coy with each successive production... but the staging and television blocking are smoother and I think 1956's John and Michael may have a slight edge over the 1955 pair. The Wendy, Kathy Nolan, is the same in both... and shines in both (and is much less arch than her 1960 color counterpart).

Clearly this is a package for those who appreciate vintage broadcasts; and/or Broadway musicals; and/or James M. Barrie's PETER PAN. Suffice it to say I fall into all three camps and for me, this is the blu-ray release of the year!",1442793600,8,1664,4.774305555555555

It was so popular that NBC aired a second LIVE performance on January 9, 1956.  Both of them were recorded using the kinescope method  in which the show is captured on film from a TV monitor. Though both the 1955 and 1956 airings were in living color, the kinescopes (all that survive) are in black and white.

I may love the show but  since each performance ran two hours (with commercials)  I have not watched both versions yet. I can tell you that the 1955 version runs 1 hour and 41 minutes while the 1956 version clocks in at 1 hour and 45 minutes. The commercials (for Ford) were deleted.
The prints of both are amazingly clear and the sound quite good.

The real GEM here is one of the two bonus features. On February 15, 1955 RCA President Robert Sarnoff hosted what  at that point  was the largest color close-circuit telecast for RCA, NBC and Fold executives and NBC station management. In this 21 minute promotion for the May 7th show (he gives the date at least a half-dozen times!), Sarnoff introduces the head of NBC and they are joined by Mary Martin and Cyril Richard to discuss  and promote  the show. Richard even shows how he changes costumes. We hear from Peter Foy  the British stage technician who was responsible for Martins flying ability. Id tell you more about this but I don't want to give it away. The promo came from the Paley Center for Media and is a GEM. My guess is that no one watching this BD has ever seen this before. There is a second short bonus  and interview with dancer Heller Halliday (Mary Martins daughter who played Liza in both productions), Her memories of being on stage each night with her mother are interesting. This interview segment runs six minutes.

The package includes a six-panel flyer with four panels containing an informative essay on the production. Unlike previous VAI releases, there is no printed index of the chapters, however the chapter stops on the main on-screen menu allow you to jump to a specific scene or song.

If you are old enough to remember seeing either of these productions (I saw both) this set will bring back memories. If you only know the version for the 1960s or the Disney animated version of Peter Pan then this will show you where it started. If you have young children or grandchildren, treat them to see this version and then you can tell them that  before home video or cable or Netflix  there was LIVE television where you could see a full Broadway show  with only a few commercials (between the three acts). And, even though it is in black and white  the performance comes alive.

Five stars all the way!

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7359866,5,B0130HWAJI,"When Captain James T. Kirk flies his final mission as Captain of the Enterprise, in Star Trek VI, his navigator asks for the final destination.  Second Star to right, Kirk says, and straight on till morning.  Even in the 23rd century Peter Pan will resonate. And no matter what new medium he watched it on, I bet it be the version with Mary Martin.

This is a wonderful, spectacular presentation that anyone over the age of 40 will enjoy.  This is the Peter Pan we knew. It is Mary Martin at her best, playing a boy named Peter, who leaves in a faraway place called Neverland and who will never grow up.

His enemy, the only Captain Hook I ever liked, was Cyril Ritchard. Ritchard plays the over the top character with great charm, humor and a bit of villainy.  For a kid he was menacing to watch and yet, this is so obviously a fantasy, you also felt safe.

And the music and songs are timeless and so well done.

This disc contains both the 1955 and 1956 version, which was filmed using a kinescope for the live performances. This means that a camera was placed in front of TV as it aired and filmed a common thing to do in the era before video tape. Sadly, although broadcast in color it was filmed in black and white.  The 1960 color and videotaped version is the one most shown on TV because of the more colorful and sharper image on videotape.  The 1956 version, directed and staged by Jerome Robbins is the best of the bunch.  First, because Robbins was in control and second this is the original Broadcast, just after their run, when their timing was perfect. Broadcast live, the 1955 version had a few technical problems, eliminated in the 1956 version.

The black and white image is not great, it is often soft; often with horizontal lines rotating; the picture loses sharpness on images to the extreme left and right and there is often a speck of dirt you want t to wipe off.  The sound is better, but it is monaural, with not great fidelity, when compared to anything done today.

But the cast, the songs, the story is timeless.  And at the finale, when Peter comes back to see Wendy, she cries. And, frankly I almost did too.

I guess its because Wendy was not the only one who grew up.

So relax, youll soon forget this not a modern version. Oh, and think of lovely things, and your heart will fly on wings.  Forever.  In Never, Neverland.",1442534400,40,2353,4.392609699769053
7359867,3,B0130HWAJI,"This is a lovely production. It really is. But I was really hoping for the 1960 telecast. These are still great, all of my favorite characters are still here and the choreography and music are as good as ever, I was just sad that it was not the performance I anticipated.",1442448000,4,271,4.333333333333333
7359868,5,B0130HWAJI,"For years these shows were not available at all, then we got the 1960 color version in VHS. These versions are even more rare. Sure, I wish they had all been recorded in color but I will take what I can get, since these shows are better in kinescope than anything on TV today.  The interview with Heller Halliday is too short. I'd like more extras for this price. Be warned, it will not look great on your big screen HD television. There is nothing I can add to what other reviewers have said about the wonders of this production. Maybe next we will get the 1960 show in blu ray. Think lovely thoughts!",1442361600,6,602,4.280701754385965

Oh, what  Joy!  I'm actually Kvelling, watching and listening to the Quintessential Petet Pan starring the incredible Mary Martin.
Such fond memories of childhood  have been brought to the surface. Feelings and thoughts so long ago extinguished have been brought to life again. Some bittersweet but most sweet .
Who knew a childhood musical could make one evoke such emotions.
Thank you for finally releasing this. It meant a lot to me and my family.",1442361600,5,495,4.869047619047619
7359870,5,B0130HWAJI,"Mary Martin recreated her Broadway performance of ""Peter Pan"" on TV three times: in 1955, 1956 and 1960. I grew up watching repeats of the 1960 broadcast. That final version (not included on this disc) survives in a very clear recording, but was a kind of clunky, unpolished performance on a cramped set.

So to me, the performances on this wonderful Blu-Ray disc were a revelation.

It contains the live 1955 program (just after the Broadway run, with the New York cast) and the 1956 live telecast (which was smoother technically). It looks like there's also a DVD release of this that contains only the 1956, which is the best of the bunch anyway. Both of these 1950s telecasts were supervised by the original director/choreograper, Jerome Robbins.

Because it's mid-1950s live TV, these are black-and-white kinescopes (a very imperfect recording technology), so don't expect crystal clarity or stereo or color, but seeing Mary Martin in her prime, performing her favorite role, fresh from Broadway, is worth it! And obviously someone has done cleanup work on these, because I've never seen them look better.

Yes, I know, people have fond memories of the 1960 color version, but it really was rough around the edges and Robbins had no hand in it... and it showed. So I'll take these great 1950s performances any day, especially the 1956 one.

The Blu-Ray disc also includes an interview with Martin's daughter, who was in the original cast and talks about what it was like to work with her mother and with Jerome Robbins.",1442361600,40,1524,4.891472868217054
7359871,4,B0130HWAJI,I think they did the best they could with what they had to work with. I'm sure it wasn't crystal clear on our 9 inch television in 1955 either. It's a miracle that it exists at all. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The only minor complaint I have is it would have been nice to have the Ford and Lincoln commercials included.,1442275200,6,316,4.19672131147541
7359872,1,B0130HWAJI,this DVD is a really cruel joke. I am dead serious. I grew up with Mary Martin's Peter Pan and I was overjoyed when I heard my favorite version of the Peter Pan story was coming to DVD after all these years. I even pre-ordered it. So you can imagine my horror and disappointment when I go to play my DVD and instead of getting immersed in childhood nostalgia I get a a really ugly black and white picture with characters I don't recognize AT ALL. It SAYS all of the actors names but I can assure you this is NOT the same movie. I am extremely disappointed.,1442188800,2,556,4.157407407407407

8726844,5,B0130HWAJI,Mary Martin and Cyril Ritchard are wonderful!  The extras are also very interesting to a devoted fan of both.  Too bad it wasn't digitalized to make it more a little brighter and more clear. It looks like it probably did back then. The audio is fine.
