2528764,5,B000EQ5Q4U,"This is my favorite production of Lucia di Lammermoor on DVD. If you're not familiar with the opera, it wouldn't be the best choice because there are no subtitles. Although the picture can be a bit grainy, the all-important sound quality is fine.

Jose Carreras, as Edgardo, is the star of this production. His final scene (staged next to Lucia's deathbed) is as powerful as Lucia's Mad Scene. Carreras' voice flows so naturally from him that it can appear effortless. His voice is full but also beautifully delicate and vulnerable. His acting is restrained but expressive; it's never overwrought (as we sometimes see today) no matter how emotional the scene. This is a great opportunity to see the least famous of The Three Tenors in an opera on DVD.

Katia Ricciarelli as Lucia has a beautiful bel canto voice; there's no straining at the top (always a relief for me). Her voice doesn't create the fireworks of a Joan Sutherland, but she uses her singing and acting ability to draw you right into Lucia's tragic circumstance. It's a gripping portrayal. The duets between Carreras and Ricciarelli are electrifying, starting with their desperate-sounding love duet of Act I and ending with their confrontation after Edgardo discovers that Lucia has married Arturo.

As Enrico, Leo Nucci completes the stellar cast. It's a treat to see Nucci as a young performer before he became a major Verdi baritone.

The conductor, Lamberto Gardelli makes the orchestra an integral part of the production, with spirited execution of the opera's ominous preludes and of Donizetti's unsettling choice to subject us to cheerful wedding and then party music in the midst of such a sad sad tale.

If you love Lucia di Lammermoor, you'll love this production.",1148688000,40,1740,4.9862068965517246
8113061,4,B000EQ5Q4U,"Most of the reviews are from the early 2000's and don't reflect the great improvement in audio and video quality since this DVD was first issued. Some mention the grainy quality of the tape was noted; perhaps it was a second generation of the master or a pirated tape not meant for commercial distribution. The video is often very dark. Additionally, the sound, while listenable, is cramped sounding monaural with somewhat limited range. The orchestra sounds out of tune at times; I am not sure if it the fault of the recording or the actual playing. The other problem is that there are no subtitles. Newer 5.1 Hi Def recording on Blu Ray make this recording dim by comparison.

All that said, we are seeing a very good performance. Some have mentioned that the two principals have shortcomings and were past their best; this may be true, but my ears are no longer able to hear that. If they can't hit the highest notes, they at least had the good taste to transpose the notes down so their limitations  would not be so obvious. Their conception of their roles were both immaculate, a consequence of being together for a long time (apparently on and off the stage). Leo Nucci and John Paul Bogart are immaculate in their roles as the Enrico and Nemorino. The sets, costumes, and stage direction are fine.
All told, well worth the low price for the quality of the performance by a stellar cast.

It should be mentioned that there are some cuts in the performance. The duet between Enrico and Edgardo at the end of Act III for one.

Actually a very nice performance hampered by the technical limitations of it's source.",1423094400,,1617,4.623693379790941

8113064,3,B000EQ5Q4U,"It probably said so in the description, but I had not absorbed that this dvd comes with no subtitles.  Carreras turns his back to Ricciarelli when he's singing to her.  I found that odd.  This recording was made a long time ago, so you have to expect it to look grainy, nothing so clear and crisp as today's dvd's.  I did want to see Carreras because I love his voice; this dvd allowed that to happen.",1359331200,2,401,4.2368421052631575
8113065,2,B000EQ5Q4U,"The best DVD of Lucia I have is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Donizetti-Lucia-di-Lammermoor-Devia-La-Scola-Bruson-Colombara-Berti-Ranzani-La-Scala-Opera/dp/B00027LD5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Donizetti - Lucia di Lammermoor / Devia, La Scola, Bruson, Colombara, Berti, Ranzani, La Scala Opera</a>--an absolutely brilliant performance by Devia. I think her mad scene is the best soprano aria I have in a pretty large collection of opera DVD's. Tenor La Scola and the immortal Brunson as Lord Ashton are also outstanding. I give that DVD an enthusiastic, unqualified recommendation.

I am amazed to see five star reviews of this DVD. Recorded in 1982, the video is quite blurry and, contrary to what others have reported, the audio is subpar. If you are somewhat new to this opera you will be lost without subtitles. The 4:3 format inevitably leads to a loss of dramatic impact because Donizetti's full-width staging cannot be recorded effectively in poor resolution, 4:3 format.

The worst problem is that Ricciarelli's performance is mediocre with minimal colatura and the difficult high notes left out. Perhaps she was better in former years, but in 1982 she can no longer sing the part adequately. You can decide for yourself as Ricciarelli's mad scene is on YouTube. Compare Ricciarelli with the greats: Callas, Southerland, Devia, Lili Pons, Gruberova, and Damrau. Note, I do not include Netrebko among the greats--weak colatura (although she has improved over the years) and skips the high notes. I saw Netrebko live at the Met and was disappointed in her performance, although Beczala and Kwiecien were quite good. Diana Damrau live at the Met was incredible. Too bad she is not on the Met DVD instead of Netrebko. I hope to see Nino Machaidze sometime.

Also note that the beautiful duet with Lord Ashton and Edgardo at the start of Act III was left out--a great disappointment. This is one of the best tenor-baritone duets in all of opera. Hearing Nucci and Carreras sing it would have been fabulous.

There are a few good parts: Nucci was great as Lord Ashton and Carreras started off very strong although he seemed weaker toward the end of Act III. However I prefer Brunson over Nucci and La Scola over Carreras so the Devia DVD is better in all three major roles. John Paul Bogart as Raimondo has an extraordinarily strong base making this smaller part much more exciting that usual.",1329523200,3,2441,5.348958333333333
8113066,5,B000EQ5Q4U,"Lucia is one of my top 5 favorite operas and I've seen it on video and live many times.  Although many people would disagree with the choice, the Met 1983 recording of Joan Sutherland and Alfredo Kraus is still my favorite, perhaps because I first saw this opera at that live performance.

However, this version has amazing performances, and as noted in my title, Leo Nucci's performance as Enrico is the best I've ever seen.  He is young here, his physical acting is great, his facial expressions leave no doubt of the feelings portrayed (and the scheming going on) and his voice is absolutely magnificent, he has the full range of this role, and there are no swallowed notes at the bottom of the range, or straining at the top, every note is fully sung -- almost worth buying the video for him alone, to hear what a magnificent Enrico sounds like.

Likewise, John Paul Bogart as Raimondo has an absolutely MAGNIFICENT bass, richly textured, full, and expressive, the most beautiful Raimondo I have ever heard.  Aside from the two leads, he got the most curtain calls (3 or 4 I forget now) after his 2nd act Duet with Lucia -- and very well deserved.  That's also one of my favorite pieces in the opera -- among all the others !

Another minor character, Arturo, gorgeous voice.  Only Normanno had a voice that did not appeal to me, though it was certainly fully up to the role, it had a sound I didn't care for (and I'm not sufficiently musically knowledgeable to describe it).
The other minor character, Alisa, sung by Waltraud Winsauer, also was a joy to hear.

Carreras' singing was gorgeous, it's so tragic that his leukemia robbed him of the even greater magnificence he would have grown into.
Riciarelli was up the role, but I'm spoiled by the fireworks that younger sopranos (and Sutherland at any age) bring to the role.  Nevertheless, her rendition was totally satisfying, fully expressive, tender and beautiful.

I'm also spoiled by the naturalistic choreography and staging of which the Met is a master.  For example, I prefer Edgardo in the cemetery at the end, with  chorus gathering around, it's much more dramatic to my mind, but that's a minor quibble.

Another quibble is that the video is grainy, and more grayish than true to colors, and my DVD had some noise on the soundtrack, but all in all, I'd recommend this for the  very high level  of singing by artists who no doubt will soon be heard no more.",1319241600,3,2423,4.639344262295082
8113067,5,B000EQ5Q4U,"Every time I play this DVD, I never fail to demand an encore immediately after the love duet.  Of course, all I had to do is to play back electronically.  The Ricciarelli-Carreras duet is emotion-packed.  It is so addictive I have to play back at least once.  They must have sung this many, many times together, and know the love that Walter Scott intended. Ricciarelli's Mad Scene is arresting, with admirable emotional impact.  She is superb.  The final scene with Carreras' soliloquies is an impassioned performance.  He delivers an aura of pain intended by Donizetti.  Of the famous Three Tenors, Carreras has always been my favorite.  This DVD demonstrates why.

If there is a disappointment to this DVD, it is the audience.  With a handful of exceptions, the audience seem to be mostly neuter genders, oblivious to this heart-wrenching performance.  The disappointment is even obvious on the faces of the performers as they line up to acknowledge the passive applause at the end.  These artists know this is one of the best performances ever!  The audience do not.",1263686400,9,1070,4.938202247191011
8113068,5,B000EQ5Q4U,"This was recorded live back in 1982.  For the past 27 years, believe it or not, no other video of this opera has managed to surpass this one.
The immense success of this live performance that wasn't really 'properly' recorded (there was no subtitles, no libretto, plain track description only, no photos)lies solely on the performance itself.
The performers are ALL so good...Katia Ricciarelli is simply the most convincing Lucia on video - blonde, sweet, vulnerable, resolute...and with one of the most beautiful bel canto singing to boot. Some reviewers here pointed out that in this performance, Ricciarelli was already past her vocal prime.  I can testify to this fact, but even so, her portrayal of Donizetti's Lucia did not suffer significantly, though it is noted that the Mad Scene here was being cut short.
Title role apart, the two male leads in the form of Leo Nucci's Enrico and Jose Carreras's Edgardo really made this performance a 'must see'.
Nucci is the perfect Enrico - unscrupulous, schemy, yet still caring for his sister.  His suppression of conscience as the story moves on was so well portrayed in this performance that his was the definitive Enrico todate.
Jose Carreras's Edgardo similarly boasts as being one of the best ever. Edgardo's pathos in this drama was so well carried through vocally that there is no other top tenor ever could surpass. Added onto this is the all-time wonderful visual portrayal by Carreras - his acting was so ardent, so real that even stones would weep, as one reviewer pointed out here.
Lamberto Gardelli led the orchestra in one of the best ever renditions of this opera. The musical drama from the pit follows the vocalists on stage as if hand in glove. Much credit also goes to the director, who did a truly wonderful job in synchronising the musical drama with the theatrical drama, some thing that is so seldom seen these days any more.",1260230400,3,1897,4.848765432098766
8113069,5,B000EQ5Q4U,"After reading Toni Bernhard's review I bought this disc. This is a really fabulous Lucia, although it is 1982 and both Carreras and Ricciarelli are both past their best they are still great. Ricciarelli's ""Mad Scene"" is magnificent both in her singing and her acting, the ""Verranno a te"" duet is first class as is the rest of the opera. Ermanno Lorenzi's Normanno is excellent and John Paul Bogart's Raimondo is absolutely superb, the orchestra under Lamberto Gardelli was magnificent, but one would expect nothing less from this great maestro, his detail in the orchestration is up to his best standard which is always superb. The picture is not as good as it could have been but it is still very watchable, I would have thought that in the transfer to DVD some of the long breaks between scenes and Acts would have been cut, they are a bit annoying at times. Overall this is a fabulous Lucia, forget that there are no subtitles, all the cast in this production paid really great attention to the pronunciation of the words so they are eminently understandable, buy yourself a libretto and learn the principal arias first then gradually learn the rest of the libretto it will be well worth your time and effort.
A marvelous performance from all concerned, congratulations.",1220832000,11,1273,4.8173515981735155
8113070,4,B000EQ5Q4U,"This Bel Canto Society DVD of Lucia di Lammermoor dates from 1982 in Bregenz,Austria. It stars Katia Ricciarelli in the title role, Jos Carreras as Edgardo, Leo Nucci as Enrico, John Paul Bogart as Raimondo, Ermanno Lorenzi as Normanno, Waltraud Winsauer as Alisa, and John Dickie as Arturo. Lamberto Gardelli

conducting the Wiener Symphoniker.

The ""tragedy"" is ascribed not only to the story, of course,

but in hearing the two leads, Ricciarelli and Carreras,

both already in 1982, prematurely on their way out of a

too-early peaked vocal prime.

It WAS a tragedy, because: the soprano and tenor had two of

the most sheerly beautiful, natural voices in opera. Both

lost the sheen in their voices by the choices they made -

singing repertoire wrong for them. Lucia and Edgardo were

roles that could have been theirs, by nature: few singers

had such RIGHT material for this repertoire. But both had

""higher"" ambitions. And their soon-to-be blown-out voices

bore out their choices.

The loss, when hearing them in this performance, is

palpable indeed. So much is so good you just want to weep.

Ricciarelli just takes your breath away in Lucia's

*sortita*. The opening bars of ""Regnava nel silenzio"" has

never sounded so contoured, lyrical, and with such plushy,

velvety tone. All her other set moments of pure lyricism -

""Verranno a' te,"" ""Soffriva nel pianto,"" her contributions

to the wedding scene, and ""Ardon gli incensi"" are

absolutely, ideally sung. She luxuriates in the long,

sculpted line, and it makes you realize the advantage

Italians have in this music: it just sounds impeccably

""right.""

 Ricciarelli's soft-singing is spellbindingly beautiful: it

had a genuine float and with that ubiquitous ""suspension""

quality. The unmistakable Italianate *morbidezza*,

belonging only to to her birthright, is all there.

 Furthermore, her performance is constantly alive: she acts

out Lucia with a good deal more involvement than you

usually see. ""Regnava"" is atmospheric, ""Quando rapito""

rapturous, ""Verranno a te"" quietly joyful. Watch her face

prior to ""Il pallor funesto""; she gives Enrico looks that

kill. Ricciarelli and Nucci really play off each other

well. When she's given the letter, she collapses with

convincing abandon. You see clearly how's she lost hope;

and it makes sense when Raimondo convinces her to put her

family's honor first. But you see the steel in the

character's backbone: she does not merely come off as a

passive simp. You see a natural consequence of the lies and

manipulation.

In the wedding scene, Ricciarelli's `La mia condanna ho

scritto"" is heartbreaking. She and Carreras create a rare

tension: both face off in the story's dilemma with unerring

skill. ""Chi mi frena""is charged, febrile. Her Lucia reacts

violently, hysterically to Edgardo's denunciation. The

entire scene is feverish, excitingly sung (but with cuts! -

and the Wolf's Crag scene is missing. Plus the trio after

the mad scene. what gives??).

The Mad Scene is anything but a canary-bird exercise.

 Ricciarelli's tonal weight and timbral luxuriance give it

a welcome gravitas. Like Callas, she doesn't deal in

looney-tune hysterics. Ricciarelli allows the pathos of

the score dictate her moves - like a lost, forlorn ghost

recalling happier days. Moreover, Ricciarelli is beautiful

to watch, both physically and in the way she carries

herself. There is no cadenza with flute - just a short,

simple a cappela vocalise; after the word `sar' we have

Donizetti's original, eloquent ending - the harmonic

resolution is intensely poignant, and needs no

substitution, actually.

In general, Ricciarelli inserts no upward extensions, and

very, very spare ""extra"" notes. It is interesting hearing

the score like this, but given the factors involved, there

is no choice.

The problem, then? Ricciarelli has audible trouble with

most notes above the staff. The cabalettas to the sortita

and the mad scene tax her sorely. Her upper tones are

tight, spread, and lacking freedom (despite a passable D

flat at the end of the sextet - who knew she had it in

her!). A lot of her passagework, lacking ideal fluidity and

freedom, suffers. Sometimes she has an approximate trill,

more often, not. You can imagine, then, my frustration at

hearing someone so ideal for Lucia, falling short of that

at all the crucial moments. That Ricciarelli took the

direction she did and ended up so is a sad tale indeed.

Then we have Carreras, who was gifted with one of those

beautiful tenor voices in the last 50 years. A nice, light,

lyrical tone, just the match for Ricciarelli. Could have

had a sensational career as a major bel canto tenor - but

no, Verdi, Giordano, and Puccini beckoned.

One will scarcely find a more suitable Edgardo, physically

and vocally. Romantic, properly Byronic-looking. An

exciting, intense actor who gives his all - more

spontaneous and ""real"" than the generic, too-intellectual

Domingo, far more involved than the static Pavarotti. That

golden, Spanish tone turning ""Fra poco a me ricovero"" into

a lesson in Donizettian lyricism. But. All the pushed,

forced highs - from training, beating his voice in the

meantime into Verdian submission - painfully manifest.

The revelation in this performance is Leo Nucci. Probably

the best performance of Enrico I've ever seen. His facial

contortions are difficult to watch, but this singing actor

acts the hell out of his role. His ""Cruda, funesta smania""

is tense, furiously nasty and powerful. His intensity is

amazing -it oozes out of his pores.

John Paul Bogart is one of the better Raimondos. He sings

with a fine, resonant tone, and manages to make his two big

scenes engaging, sympathetic and weightier than we usually

see.

The sets and costumes are spectacular. The atmosphere is

wonderfully, dank, cavernous and Poe-like gloomy. Some

interesting staging effects. Lucia and Enrico have their

duet in her bedroom, where it is obvious that she and

Edgardo have had a tumble in the sheets prior to his

leaving (And::: - in a surprise move of indiscretion, the

program notes coyly mention the affair between Ricciarelli

and Carreras! - ""They remained lovers for 13 years and sang

many performances together, among them this Lucia, warmed

by their love"" !!! So don't tell anyone. Be nice and

respect their privacy.)

Just as Edgardo is about to sing ""Tu che a Dio spiegasti,""

a curtain rises, and Lucia, dead on her bed, is there; he

finishes his scene by stabbing himself and topples in death

at her side. A nice touch, actually.

Despite my frustrated reservations, this really is a very

fine performance, in many respects, much better than most

I've seen. It remains a bittersweet document of the ""could

have been"" aspect of the 2 leads. Still - you don't get

this kind of Lucia and Edgardo much these days, and the

luxury of having two such artists and voices is still a

tantalizing lure, and I'm sure I'll return to it from time

to time.",1157673600,34,7003,5.032456140350877
