534935,5,6303036945,"I bought this for my 18 month old granddaughter after taking her to a real circus.  She watches it over and over and over.  She tries to do some of the routines because there are lots of kids in it, some her age.  I just ordered another one for my daughter's house so that she can enjoy it as much as I do!",1013212800,3,306,3.8253968253968256
534936,4,6303036945,"My 2-year-old loves the ""Sing-along-Songs"" videos so I've seen most of them.  This is one that adults can watch and enjoy along with their children.  Disney characters are prominent but not oppressive.  Most of the circus acts feature children as performers and some include the ""Disney"" children as well.  One surprise is that the featured clown (unnamed in the credits) is David Larible, Ringling Brothers ""clown of clowns.""  He is excellent and interacts well with the Disney characters.  The bell ringing routine is very funny--even after you've seen it 35 times!",985737600,17,567,5.175824175824176
534990,5,6303036945,I bought this for my kids who are now much older. It was their favorite video when they were kids and I also bought one for my great nephew who is three. He loved it!!,1402963200,2,167,3.8
534991,5,6303036945,"I bought this VHS for my daughters many years ago, and it's so very entertaining. My daughters are grown now and I have a young grandson who would love this also, but  I can no longer can play it due to DVD only player. It would be wonderful if this could be put on DVD.",1396569600,2,270,3.909090909090909
534992,5,6303036945,This is a great video! I'm a preschool teacher and this is a favorite! Sadly it broke after years of use and we no longer have VHS players.  This really needs to be out on DVD!,1394841600,,176,3.888888888888889
534993,5,6303036945,"I wish this was in DVD!  We are on our 3rd VHS copy.  Purchased originally about 16 or more years ago.
When both my boys were young this was the DVD I could count on if I needed those few minutes to complete a task.  Parents be warned-- it can suck you in, too !
I think it is the best kids video. Not educational but entertaining.  Do not expect a lot of Disney characters.
As another reviewer wrote, my son with autism,also LOVES this video .  This is why we're on number 3.  It is all he wanted last Christmas. (Thank you, Amazon!)  He is 16 years old.
I can sing every song by heart.
The acrobatics are really cool.  I especially like the Dad and son and the girl who ""tries over and over again"".
You won't regret this purchase unless you no longer own a VHS player .",1393545600,,771,4.059602649006623

534997,3,6303036945,"My children watched this video a few times, but they lost interest in it.  The circus segments are pretty long and there are not that many characters seen in them.
