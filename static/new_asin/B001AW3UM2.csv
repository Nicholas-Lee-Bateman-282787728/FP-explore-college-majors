8279912,5,B001AW3UM2,"I recommend the 8 DVD of the collection of this encyclopedia of BJJ carried out by D. Marcus Vinicius DI Luca.
All the information is perfectly structured, in a such way that, the teaching is very simple for the logic of the teaching method.
The explanations understand all the necessary details to understand all the explained movements perfectly.
In my modest opinion, the initial formation in JUDO of the Teacher Marcus Vinicius facilitates the teaching methodology a lot and it simplifies the understanding of its teaching a lot.
I believe that ALL the DVD of the encyclopedia is basic for all the people that already begin in BJJ, and a very good tool of consultation for people initiate.
For everything it, I recommend the complete purchase of the 8 DVD.",1414195200,,760,4.8538461538461535
