8277377,5,B001AH0IXQ,"I have owned this course for several years now, and presented it to 1 groups of students and 1 group of adults. The course is presented as 13 DVD lectures with discussion afterwards. the DVD lectures are presented by Ken Ham and 2 young scientist, covering the topics of biology/genetics, geology and astronomy/cosmology, with and introduction to science as a discipline and tool to discover knowledge and discuss ideas. The lectures are presented to a class of high school seniors, but the discussion is certainly adult level.
Highly recommended as a study to resolve science and faith conflicts, which are emerging and growing in the Hubble telescope age.
I have used this curriculum as a study at church which is always well received.",1397433600,2,737,5.0
8277378,5,B001AH0IXQ,"Excellent, clear teaching, interesting, and pithy. Easy to remember sayings and devices help drill the info into my mind. :) I want to go through it at least once more, and I would recommend it to anyone.",1344384000,2,204,4.54054054054054
8277379,5,B001AH0IXQ,"This is a deep and penetrating DVD presentation that will cut to the core of evolution myths, and society's attempt to build order without divine morality.

Each segment runs 30 minutes and allows for question and answer time with extra information and links provided to the leader in a separate text.  Here you will find real answers to help defend against the myths of billions of years, millions of minute evolutionary changes.

With detailed diagrams and up to date photos (and videos) you will learn that catastrophic events can and have altered what our earth looks like, and renders useless our imagined steady method of counting time (and projecting our ideas back into history).

Here you will learn that fossils can be formed overnight, large fossils and trees can be found lodged in multiple genealogical layers (yet they remain intact).  Here you will learn about DNA and how new information is never added, but only lost to natural selection.

An excellent teaching tool, rooted in the truth of the Bible - to be used with any group of teens or adults.",1335657600,5,1065,4.856353591160221
