6964672,5,B00S8ONLYM,My 15th purchase of Midsomer Murders and they all add up to pure enjoyment.,1441411200,,75,4.428571428571429
6964673,4,B00S8ONLYM,"everything was fine, just like the old series better. thanks",1440374400,,60,5.1
6964674,5,B00S8ONLYM,Great series.  My husband just loves the Midsomer Murder Mysteries.  It came quickly and I will order from this seller again.,1437868800,,125,4.904761904761905
6964675,5,B00S8ONLYM,It is Midsomer!!!!  what's not to love.,1436745600,,39,4.571428571428571
6964676,5,B00S8ONLYM,great movie,1436745600,,11,5.0
6964677,5,B00S8ONLYM,"Neil Drudgeon took over as John Barnaby, Tom Barnaby's cousin, to become the chief detective of Midsomer. Their styles are different and though they share an assistant, Ben Jones, I do know that changes too. Perhaps those casting the show thought that two changes of their lead characters was too much at one time. This continues to be a superb cast of great and believable actors set in the beautiful English countryside. My only negative comment is to watch...Some of these are sold as ""Series"" and some as ""Season"" and I have duplicated more than once and received the same movies because of it.  I passed the duplicates on to friends who are now hooked on this series, too.",1436313600,14,677,4.689075630252101
6964678,1,B00S8ONLYM,NO. It was a combination of sets 23 & 24 but wasn't on the info when I ordered it. So now I have wasted my money on something I already had. That is sets 23 & 24,1436313600,30,161,3.3783783783783785
6964679,5,B00S8ONLYM,Clever plots and interesting characters.,1435622400,,40,7.2
6964680,1,B00S8ONLYM,"Beware buyers!  The second episode ""Murder of Innocence"" was omitted (although announced on the disc and package).  Instead, the first episode ""The Dark Rider"" is repeated with commentary--and I don't like to have an episode repeated, commentary or not.  I have given the lowest rating because I don't feel Acorn should take this kind of liberty--UNLESS IT IS STATED INITIALLY!  Please, Acorn, how about sending that second episode to everyone who has been deprived?",1434758400,40,466,5.256756756756757
6964681,4,B00S8ONLYM,"Beware this looks like is a reissue of previously sold episodes in sets now gouped under Neil Dudgeon his ""series 15"" not a set like #24 or #25. The episodes are good but not worth buying twice.",1430179200,37,194,4.27027027027027
6964682,5,B00S8ONLYM,"I have to say I was more than a bit sad to see John Nettles leave the Midsomer series. Saying that, Neil Dudgeon stepped into that space and has made it his own. I like the changes and the series still works very well---quirky characters, plots and all. A particular favorite is Sykes.",1518998400,,285,4.39622641509434

6964685,5,B00S8ONLYM,"Love, love, LOVE this series! I highly recommend that you start with season 1 and work your way up. Great series to binge watch!  Love the British sense to humor!!! Midsomer Murders is a great series! They keep you guessing who did it up to the end. Barnaby ALWAYS gets the perpetrator!",1517270400,,286,4.5
6964686,5,B00S8ONLYM,"I have every series,  and when John Nettles left I almost cried.  It was very emotional after so long a time.  Neil Dudgeon is a good
replacement, although his approach differs.  The mysteries remain captivating and this is quite a feat after so long a run.
Please keep going as long as you can, surely you have thousands more whose interest and anticipation remains as keen as mine.
Still miss Nettles but everyone is entitled to retirement  whether full or semi in scope",1511395200,,472,4.63855421686747

6964797,5,B00S8ONLYM,"I am a big fan of John Nettles and was very disappointed that he left the series.
After watching all of Series 15, Neil Dudgeon plays the character John Barnaby in quite a different
way than John Nettles played Tom Barnaby. Yes, i miss John but so far Neil has done a great job.
