6815693,5,B00PKPGMXY,"Mr. Januszczak is, as always, full of fire. The energy of ideas is a delight, whether you agree or cling to your preconceived notions. Knowing HOW art is made contributes to the appreciation of the final product. Mr. Januszczak has been reminding us of this in print and on telly (and when we are lucky) on DVD's such as this. Become a groupie. I am pleased I did.",1428451200,7,364,4.367647058823529
6815694,5,B00PKPGMXY,"I already knew Waldemar Januszack from his work on Impressionism and when I ordered this Baroque and Rococo I had great expectations on it. What I can say and share with customers is that this DVD fully met my expectations, I can state that this is simply superb.",1427587200,6,263,4.5
6815695,5,B00PKPGMXY,"This set includes 3 programs. A 4hr documentary on Baroque, a 4hr documentary on Rococo and a 70min documentary on William Dobson. Buy with confidence, everything this company/Waldemar Janusczack do are great - this is no exception.",1425772800,12,232,5.297297297297297
8688421,5,B00PKPGMXY,"First off, anything Waldemar does is great. In fact, he was the Christmas theme this year for our adult children and myself. LOL! We each gave each other this set of DVDs. We gave the kids, between their birthday and Christmas, at least 4 or more books Waldemar either wrote, or was associated with. The man is truly a genius, not to mention hilarious. He makes complicated things simple to understand. We homeschooled our skulls full of mush, and so when possible, drug them to every art exhibit we could in order to demonstrate how history is reflected in art and music. So they did develop an interest in art, and were THRILLED to find my discovery of him on Amazon Prime. If you are homeschooling, I highly suggest anything he has video wise and book wise. You will not find anyone explain art any better. If you are an art fan, get his books and his DVDs. Even if you don't fit into these categories, please take some time to watch him. Waldemar is not dry, he inserts humor, and he is not an art snob, or biased in any way. I discovered him while recovering from breast cancer surgery, and I since I couldn't do much, and didn't want to turn into a mental vegetable, I started watching him on Amazon Prime, and then got the Acorn app on my firetv in order to watch other Waldemar shows like the Dark Ages. So, if you know someone who is bed stuck due to an illness, or surgery, Waldemar is a great prescription to get well. GREAT!!!! Oh, not paid a dime, or asked to say one word of this. FYI.",1516665600,,1499,4.319148936170213
8688422,5,B00PKPGMXY,Januszcack's  clever and magnificently produced approach to understanding ALL of history through its artists is the best I have ever seen.,1494028800,,138,5.571428571428571
8688423,4,B00PKPGMXY,"Januszczak offers some unique perspectives to learn from. The footage is nicely shot. There are some things he explains very well, and we get to see unique places not shown in textbooks. We spend a little too much time following him around, but he does try to get us into the sense of being travelers on a discovery. As I have not seen another film on Rococo/Baroque to compare, it's hard to say whether this is an excellent choice or not, but it is good in its own way. Januszczak's colorful personality is fine, better, probably, than a dull professor with a stiff upper lip, and his enthusiasm for art history is obvious. When I reflect back on what I remember since last viewing the film, I wish more could be said. However, the hours of footage and education Januszczak provides is a deal. Should be priced at $25 or less.",1466208000,,827,4.483443708609271
8688424,5,B00PKPGMXY,"The main thing is simply how stunningly gorgeous the visuals are in HD. Too bad they didn't have anything approaching HD for Kenneth Clark's Civilization series fifty--yes, fifty--years ago. Waldemar's no Clark, though he's fine. But the main thing is simply the wonderful visuals, including the virtually 3D precision of the brushwork. I hope this company keeps up the great work, surveying all of world art's highlights, as ideally touring the great aesthetic cities of the world for dessert--from Kyoto to Charleston.",1461715200,,520,5.353658536585366

8688426,5,B00PKPGMXY,"Love all the series made and presented by Waldemar Januszczak and collect them.
He is deeply knowledgable, entertaining and has a great sense of humour - perfect combination.",1457049600,,174,5.25
8688427,5,B00PKPGMXY,"I'm an amateur artist, and I'm more interested in Impressionism than Baroque & Rococo, but Waldemar makes anything interesting - and amusing. I'm working my way through this series, one episode at a time, on my Fire, and enjoying the heck out of it. Even if you are not interested in art, and don't enjoy looking at beautiful things and learning a bit of history (what are you, a caveman?), you'll enjoy this series for the humor alone. I also own his 4-part series on Impressionism, and have watched it 3 times now, getting something new out of it every time, and getting a kick out of it every time. I was thrilled to find this new set.",1449187200,2,638,4.415254237288136
