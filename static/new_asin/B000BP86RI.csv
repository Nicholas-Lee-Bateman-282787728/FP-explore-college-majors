2434591,4,B000BP86RI,"Say what you will, opera is all about music, and music is all about tuning. Apart from the choral overture, the first 20 minutes of Ermione are musically undistinguished, and in this production the principal singers in the first three scenes all seem convinced that the orchestra is consistently sharp. I'm just minutes away from running to my computer to re-sell this disc, but suddenly the singers find their tonal centers and Rossini wakes up, and the rest is pure delight, though not without imperfections. Diana Montague (Andromache) never reaches either intensity or A440. Jorge Lopez-Yanez (Pyrrhus)achieves both, but lacks the vocal athleticism to make the characteristic rapid passages of Rossini truly impressive. Anna Antonacci (Ermione)sings and acts her character with such cold hauteur that one begins to look forward to tragedy, but she sings splendidly. Bruce Ford (Orestes) is a painful twerp but he also sings gloriously. Their duets and indeed all the ensemble arias are superb, imaginative, emotionally effective MUSIC, which explains why I'm giving the disk 4 stars.
The production owes a bit to the Cabinet of Doctor Caligari. Set in the gilded boxes and velvet drapes of a traditional opera house tilted 15 degrees askew, it's unrelentingly an ""opera about opera"". I'm not usually keen on self-referential art, but this time it seems to make sense. Certainly it's vivid, lush, and coherent. There are a few token bits of ""relevance"" tossed in, including vague hints of Pyrrhus as Mussolini, but they can be ignored. It's hard to imagine that a pre-modernist production, dressing the roles in Attic bathrobes in the manner of Hollywood Homer, would be nearly as plausible. Once you accept the premises, I think you'll find the production values excellent.
Another reviewer faults the sound recording and especially the balance of singers and orchestra. The criticism is fair, but I found that by turning the volume up to the maximum comfortable, I was able to satisfy my ears.
Give it a chance! It's the only DVD of a rarely-produced opera rich with musical ingenuity. If you've never seen or heard the work before, sit through the first few scenes once and ever after fast-forward to the good stuff.",1139011200,27,2222,5.107142857142857
2434592,5,B000BP86RI,"DVDs, are A DELIGHTFUL FORM OF ENTERTAINMENT
What can be better than to lay Back  to enjoy a great operatic performance comfortably at home. BUT WHAT THEY  WHERE THINKING ??? I wonder why the sound of some Performances are  great and others like this  Ermione is off.
 Technology has to improve on sound's reproduction standards. Is sad to see so many attempts to preserve historical performances ruined by the bad sound reproduction  and that is sad.

Ermione by Rosinni is a great Opera  and I wish that the sound valance of this recording was better. In  many passages is hard to hear the voices over the orchestra.

This is a beautiful production, music and conducting is excellent, and all the  singing is great. Im glad to have it in my collection despite its flows.",1135468800,26,772,4.686567164179104
8090477,4,B000BP86RI,"the singing was  beautiful - the music was very good. The set was okay.  all in all,  I was satisfied with this first purchase of Anna C.",1470441600,,137,4.0
8090478,4,B000BP86RI,"My God!  I thought i was watching refugees from a Traviata production!  For that's exactly how the costumes looked.  That said, I must also add that Antonacci continues to astonish by her beauty and her musical prowess.  Unfortunately, her character is a bipolar weirdo in need of medication,  No matter; she is simply stunning.  Mastagne, Ford and  Lopez Yanez are equally awesome.  It is the only DVD, so I suggest you get it until European productions return to some kind of verisimilitude in staging.  Musically, a 5.",1447545600,,521,4.896551724137931
8090479,5,B000BP86RI,"Frankly, Ermione is not the best Rossini, but Anna Caterina Antonacci is my favorite singer these days, and of course I liked this Ermione. If  you like Antonacci, buy it; if you do not know her, buy it also, because you may make quite a discovery. If you buy it and do not like her, well, that is opera: difference of opinions keeps it alive.",1393718400,,343,4.276923076923077
8090480,3,B000BP86RI,"The sing and acting was good. Setting was OK, but costumes would have been better if a little more representative of the ancient Greek theme. When you consider the religion of the ancient Greeks, it is more difficult to connect the meaning of the words of the singers when costume are removed from the period. I would characterize the production as semi-traditional. I have seen worse costumes, such as found in Antonacci's DVD of Medea.",1357257600,2,437,4.84
8090481,5,B000BP86RI,"This opera is very unusual,as well as a neglected masterpiece.  The overture is joined several times by the backstage chorus.  The mezzo opens the show with her son lamenting her fate and the loss of her husband Hector at the fall of Troy.  It is a little slow getting going until the fiery Ermione { Anna Caterina Antonacci } enters the scene.  She is every bit as beautiful as Netrebko and is a top notch Bel Canto singer and actress. To add to the fun, there are three fine Rossini tenors. The music is very inventive and the 2nd act is a bombshell of emotional music mostly sung by Antonacci in a long scena.  The 2nd act is as exciting as anything Rossini ever wrote.  I ha a huge Rossini collection and have a basis for comparison. Unfortunately the performance is 17 years old and is visually inferior to more recent DVDs.  Still a must buy for those that think Bel Canto is tame.",1336608000,2,887,4.371951219512195
8090482,5,B000BP86RI,"This is a simple, effective staging of a neglected Rossini masterpiece with a powerful, no-holds-barred performance by Antonacci, strongly supported by Ford, Montague, and Howell.  The final scene I find hair-raising. The first performance in Naples was the ONLY performance of this astonishing opera in Rossini's lifetime.  The audience must have been left sitting in silent shock at the end.  I ask myself, ""Why did Rossini write it?""  I speculate that perhaps for once he wanted to let loose the tremendous creative and explosive imaginative forces within him, damn the conventions and atrophied tastes of his audience, just let the chips fall where they may.  He never attempted a revival of the work, but I bet it gave him deep satisfaction to see and hear it before an audience once.  If you don't know the opera, try this performance from Glyndebourne: an amazing artistic creation, and I believe the greatest of Rossini's serious operas.",1310428800,2,945,5.103896103896104
8090483,5,B000BP86RI,"The reviews posted here confuse me a bit:  I found everything about this production top notch.  Of course, you have to research the plot BEFORE you watch, otherwise you're lost from the get go.  Once you realize what's happening, you have to simply give in to the production and enjoy.  There are no tuning problems!  There are no audio problems!!  Montague nearly walks off with the show, and were it not for the Ermione's last monologue and duet the work would seem a little lop sided in Andromache's favor.  However,  Antonacci is one of the greatest singing actresses of our time, and when she is onstage you can do nothing but watch her.
I hate to even bring up the name ""Callas"" but one can't help but make comparisons.  Antonacci displays the kind of blood and guts commitment for which Callas was famous.  Her singing here is splendid, but her middle voice has a ""veil"" and her more recent performances show that she has worked out her initial vocal issues.  Bruce Ford occasionally lets loose a verismo yelp which, while exciting, is not exactly stylistically correct.  These moments simply show an artist at the top of his game investing in his character.  Purists might sneer, but I found him an exiting performer.
But above all, it is Antonacci that one remembers, and especially her closing ""mad scene"", very reminicient of some of Donizetti's doomed Queens.  The production itself is elegant, simple, beautiful and doesn't call attention to itself after it is once revealed.  The staging is a beautiful blend of elegant tableaux.  I loved this production and am thrilled that it was captured on DVD.",1231027200,10,1613,4.810909090909091
8090484,2,B000BP86RI,"Booooor----ing!  Singers just didn't do it for me -- I saw the NYCO give it a few years ago and, 'twas Wonderful!!!!  Mme. Erroney & others were not up to the task -- sorry, fell short - way, way short - give it a try - until a REAL CD or DVD comes your/our way!",1214611200,2,262,3.7454545454545456
8090485,5,B000BP86RI,"Yes, the sound is less than ideal and the plot is awkward but....this is Rossini at his best. I've been watching his operas for many years, I'm entralled by Tancredi and Tell, the comedies are absolutely delightful but...this opera astounded me. This is top of the top Rossini music; real character development, great pathos and superb use of orchestra. I can't imagine why this isn't done more often. Fortunately the production recorded here is terrific. I think the tilted Italian opera house was a brilliant idea. The singers are also super good. Antonacci held me spell-bound. She's scary! The duets are particulary good. Beautiful music, beautiful staging, beautiful singing; I'll forgive a little less than the best sound. It's great Rossini.",1206921600,,748,5.190082644628099
8090486,5,B000BP86RI,"despite the not so great-but acceptable- sound, somewhat twisted libretto and plot, static and boring staging featuring a tilted platform , and crappy subtitles, this is one amazing opera which can only be seen and heard through this dvd.

Just a tragedy that this opera was apparently never recorded until 1986, and that cd is out of print. Why they never recorded a version after this version is another mystery.

But the music may be the best Rossini ever wrote, and he knew it since he preserved the score and borrowed from it frequently.  He called it his ""little William Tell,"" though virtually no one ever heard it. It was way ahead of its time-it feels like a bel canto with deeper psychological development, and more sophisticated taut music that drives the opera to sublime heights.

Despite ""the lack of competition,"" this dvd features some incredible singing and acting by all 4 of the main characters.  Ms. Antonacci took on a formidable role and masterfully conquered it and the audience.  But she has plenty of help from the likes of Ford, Austin Kelly, Montague and conductor Andrew Davis who really surprised me.

I am giving it 5 stars because of the music, singing and acting by the cast-especially Antonacci.  Nearly the entire Second Act is dominated by her.  It's interesting to note that it is believed by many that Rossini wrote it to showcase the talents of his wife.

Now if we can only get a new cd version or a reprint of the 1986 disc.  This is one opera that really needs to be heard.",1188864000,18,1514,4.654135338345864
