My 3-yr old grandson loves these series - he hadn't seen this one yet!  When he opened this Christmas gift, he pulled out the other DVD he had been watching and put this one in right then and there.  I too enjoyed watching it!
Since then, I decided to purchase a couple of other DVD's in this series to keep at my house when he comes over!",1388448000,,362,4.084507042253521

5353259,5,B009MP8KTW,"My kids love Dinosaur Train, especially my daughter Paige! She has had a love for dinosaurs from the time she was a baby and was more into them then Reed even though dinosaurs are widely considered a boys obsession! She was so excited to watch Dinosaur Train Submarine Adventure. Not only does it have her beloved Dinosaur Train characters, its also an underwater adventure which she has been obsessed with ever since watching The Little Mermaid! Anything under water has got to be equally magical in her book. And it was!

As a mom, I always appreciate educational shows and Dinosaur Train is chalk full of information! I have to admit I was learning right along with Paige about the names of different things found in the ocean I had never heard of! Sometimes it breaks away to a real person who explains more in depth what something is. I would think my kids wouldnt enjoy the breakaway from their cartoon but they actually like it and ask questions about it.

The characters are so cute and colorful and fun to watch. This really draws in toddlers. Some of the information provided might be a little over my daughters head but it definitely got her thinking and asking questions. This could appeal to a wide variety of ages. I could see kids up to Jr. High enjoying the entertainment value and learning a lot from the educational aspect.

Dinosaur Train Submarine Adventure is Paiges new favorite and most requested show to watch. You definitely don't want to miss the special on February 18th on PBS Kids!",1361059200,3,1510,4.669172932330827
