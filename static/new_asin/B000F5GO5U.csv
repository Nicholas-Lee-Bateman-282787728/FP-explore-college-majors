2552159,5,B000F5GO5U,"I just picked up the Season Two, volume one DVD boxed set of He-Man and the MOTU, and must say it is just as great as the Season One, volumes 1 and 2 sets.

The effort put into the creation of these boxed sets of this great cartoon show is nothing short of amazing. Everything from the carton design, the character art on the DVD's, and to the cartoons themselves, everything here is first class all the way.

If there are any complaints whatsoever, it would be on the part of Filmation, who recycled some sets and in some cases sacrificed story to introduce new characters. But in 1984 when this occurred, the He-Man cartoon and toy line was exploding with popularity, which no doubt caused a rush to get these cartoons finished and on TV. They are still extremely fun to watch, and if only for a half-hour at a time, transports you back to an easier time in your life.

I highly recommend any fan of this show to buy this set! You most definitely will not be disappointed! I look forward to the fourth and final boxed set, Season Two, vol 2.",1149638400,6,1043,4.338461538461538
2552160,5,B000F5GO5U,"Ever since I was a kid, this has always been my favorite cartoon series. As far as mass media is concerned, this is the first attempt at blending sci-fi and fantasy together, making it a great story full of interesting characters. He-man stands as the ideal hero and role model for kids while Skeletor makes the ultimate villain. As always, this box set contains two art cards drawn by the best artists in the business, documentries on the making of the series, and character bios. In this set in particular, it contains episodes 66-98. You won't regret buying this.",1145836800,11,566,4.7272727272727275
2552161,5,B000F5GO5U,"I liked watching He man when I was growing up and I am glad they are coming out with all these great 80's cartoons so fast.

I wish they bring back the original toys also but somethings are left in the past.",1144108800,8,207,3.9285714285714284
2552181,5,B000F5GO5U,"I love this cartoon, the boxes are very detailed and DVDs come in Spanish and English. The only problem was that the salesman sold them in terrible condition and not indicated in the description.",1381795200,,195,4.764705882352941
2552182,1,B000F5GO5U,"I was so looking forward to finally having this collection specifically a NEW and never opened product. However upon trying to watch the videos I notice wear signs on several disks and scratches that prevented me from watching the episodes all the way through.  I was very saddened and disappointed that this seller felt the need to lie in order to unload damaged merchandise. the outside packaging was fine but the disks are very disappointing.  Anyone can re-shrink wrap an item and claim it is knew. Apparently I was deceived.  Such a disappointment considering I paid a hefty price for a ""perfect"" and ""brand new"" product that was anything but! Shame on you!  I would not recommend using this seller as they are not as honest as they appear.",1379808000,2,745,4.751937984496124
2552183,5,B000F5GO5U,"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe is one the best action series the 80's produce. Filmation the studio that made the animated show, was pioneered on the field of believable motion in cartoons. Their good knowledge in anatomy and fluid movements made the series enjoyable and the morals on every episode, made them stand out. He-Man is back!",1323302400,,345,4.864406779661017
2552184,5,B000F5GO5U,The He-Man and Masters of The Universe DVD set worked and sounded great.  This collection really brought my childhood back to life during the viewing.  I hope others around my age purchase this product and enjoy the memories.,1313798400,,225,4.894736842105263
2552185,4,B000F5GO5U,"I love He-Man, I grew up watching it and I was totally psyched to see it on DVD. I eventually got them all but this one (season two vol. 1). Well, as an avid fan I just had to finish my collection. You can imagine my disgust when I saw that some parasite was selling it on the marketplace for $10,000! Are you kidding me? I can't believe people think they can get away with stuff like this. Well, anyone interested should know it is available online for a reasonable price. I just bought it-- brand new-- for $22 plus shipping.

Shame on you for attempting to sell this volume for such an outrageous price. Especially since the series is being re-released in a box set very soon. Good luck with that...",1298246400,6,702,4.318181818181818
2552186,5,B000F5GO5U,"I grew up an 80's kid in the 90s, so I was graced with stuff like Transformers G1, Thundercats, and He-man, thanks to my older brother who had them recorded off TV onto Beta, but I loved it just the same. This is a great set for people like me who didn't get to see all the episodes, but still like the series. two thumbs up.",1291939200,,325,3.9393939393939394
2552187,4,B000F5GO5U,It stinks that they just don't make a season & sell it entirely. As they've done to the She-Ra series a season is broken into two volumes. So be prepared to fork out an additional fee when you want to complete the season you've begun collecting. The cartoon is the same as ever & Skeletor is just as funny!,1243987200,,306,4.203389830508475
2552188,5,B000F5GO5U,I remember watching He-man and wanted the show never to end now I can see as many times as I want! I really love this DVD it brings back great memories!,1236470400,,152,3.935483870967742

2552190,5,B000F5GO5U,My son is 4.  i was 4 in 1984 so it's fitting my son watch what I watched.  Current cartoons are garbage.  This stuff had a SOUL back then.  He loves it and I find myself watching entire episodes with him.  RUN! don't walk to pick this up.  I own the entire 2 seasons and couldn't be happier.,1221782400,,292,3.9482758620689653
2552201,4,B000F5GO5U,"I was a child of the 80's and I must say I still love my Saturday Morning Cartoons. The cartoons these days are pretty weak sauce, but the 80's rocked big part due to He-man. To watch He-man again in beautiful DVD quality and sound, made me feel like I did on saturdays. When Prince Adam said in the intro ""I have the POWER""  I literally had butterflies again. How something 25 years old can still trigger that emotion is a testament to the hard work and passion of Lou Scheimer and filmation. May He-man truly be eternal, and may the upcoming live action He-man movie not suck.",1211068800,,578,4.351851851851852
2552202,4,B000F5GO5U,"On the next stop of our He-Man/ BCI dvd release tour, we'll be visiting the first volume of the second (and final) season of Filmation's beloved classic series. I was personally looking quite forward to delving into the second season on account of the simple fact that much of my attraction toward He-Man was I was a kid stemmed from the concept of replaying the onscreen action with my modest action figure collection (which did include the Castle Grayskull play set). That said, season 2 introduced many of the characters that made up my toy, er I mean action figure collection. Among the noteworthy additions were the villains Whiplash, Cobra-Kahn, and the ever-cool Webstor. On the side of justice, He-Man's crew expanded to include Buzz-Off, Fisto, and Mekaneck.

Unfortunately, I cannot report all positive as far as the second season is concerned. While the charm of the first season was retained, it starts to become clear by the second or third disc of this collection that the well of material was beginning to dry up. Make no mistake, several of the episodes here represent some of the finest writing of the entire 130 episode run (Into the Abyss, The Origin of the Sorceress for example) but the great works tend to be surrounded by plots that we've experienced time and time again (kidnapping to other dimensions, Skeletor's endless failures). In addition the ever-annoying Orko takes a turn for the worse this season. While I realize that he was placed into the series for the benefit of the children, his continual spoils do grow a bit thin.

This isn't to say this isn't a worthy addition to the BCI collection. In fact, in many ways it is the most impressive box set to be released. The cover art is spectacularly reminiscent of the original production's look and in my estimation, this volume contains one of the most interesting documentary segments of the entire run: The Magic of Filmation. This retrospective really provides a solid feel for the family-like environment of Lou Scheimer's legendary company. To be honest, by this stage of the game, the viewer actually begins to feel like they actually know the individuals involved in the production of He-Man personally. Should I bump into any of them on the street, I suspect maintaining a healthy conversation should be effortless after watching these collections.

As is tradition for this box set release, the sixth disc includes the stories behind select episodes from the first half of season 2 (episodes 66-98) in addition to 3 full episode commentaries. 2 more 4x6"" collectible cards are packaged in this time from Frank Cho and Emiliano Santalucia.

Included on this 6 disc set are the following episodes:

The Cat And The Spider
The Energy Beast
Day Of The Machines
The Gamesman
Fisto's Forest
The Rarest Gift Of All
The Great Books Mystery
To Save Skeletor

Once again BCI has somehow managed to pack way more material into a compilation than previously thought possible. The tradition of excellence BCI has introduced to fans of the original season is present through the transition into the beginning half of the second, and unfortunately final, season of Filmation's He-Man and the Masters of the Universe.",1209945600,,3654,4.866559485530547
2552203,4,B000F5GO5U,"I was glad to see this come out. I've never seen the second season on TV, as I had to prioritize my studying at the time it was on.

He-Man and Skeletor are continuing their beautifully animated battle of good vs evil in Eternia.

Buy all four volumes of season 1 and 2 and stack them side by side on your shelves to enjoy the picture the covers make. Without giving anything away, you can look forward to a good set of extras too.

I'm hanging out in hope that they'll release She-Ra season 2 this year as the obvious follow-up to this.",1175472000,,537,4.194174757281553

I have all of the dvd sets and so far a couple of them have not played correctly. certain episodes skip even though there is no scratches on the disk. they have done it since new. amazon had no trouble exchanging it hassle free for me, and in fact this set was an exchange! don't be discouraged though, they're still totally worth buying!",1173398400,,833,4.180124223602484

2552209,5,B000F5GO5U,"Season 2 Volume 1 is the beginning of the end of DVD sets for the Most Powerful Man in the Universe, but don't count him out. This season marks some pretty powerful episodes. The Problem with Power, The Origin of the Sorceress, Into The Abyss, Teela's Triumph, any of the episodes appearing in the famed 10 best set that sparked the return, will grace the sets. All new featurettes hint at more of the voice acting work, Alan Oppenheimer reminisces about the work he did and how he made Skeletor a part of the American villain gallery.

Note that Tom Tataranowicz, who wrote the Problem with Power, also has a character named after him in that very episode. These shows were hitting an emotional chord as well as still sparking the imaginations of children everywhere. No crossovers from Princess of Power, but never fear. He-Man does crossover to She-Ra and that will obviously with the release of the Best of She-Ra Princess of Power, be the beginning of DVD sets for He-Man's twin.

Note fancy covers does not make He-Man or She-Ra sell, it is the content and imagination, and fantasy and the heroism that we all loved and adored back in 83 and now can relive thanks to BCI Eclipse, He-Man.org and mostly the fans.

They truly have

Let The Power Return",1149811200,10,1256,4.618834080717488
2552210,5,B000F5GO5U,"The prior two releases for season 1 were superior, but the content on this first half of season 2 is truly unique.  First, the animation included more details on the characters, because the animators were building on experience drawing those characters from the first season.  Second, while a lot of stock footage is still used, there is new animation for all of the characters to varying degrees.  Third, the writers were interested in deeply exploring the characters-this show evolved from a simple ""He-Man vs. Skeletor"" to more of ""The adventures of He-Man"" which was very cool.

The documentary about Filmation is something I've wanted to see for many years-it reveals how Lou Schiemer ran Filmation and all kinds of interesting trivia about Filmation studios that has never been disclosed in an organized collection for public viewing before.  Nice job BCI Eclipse!

As always, the boxed set includes an embossed cover, very attractive cells on the DVD's and the internal boxes and I liked the two art postcards in this collection more than the prior releases.

The only way this could have been perfect beyond perfect is if BCI Eclipse included closed captions and if they could include at least one episode with the original music remixed/resampled for stereo (I always loved Shuki Levy's music in this show).

For a He-Man fan (Filmation era), you'd do yourself a huge disservice not to get this DVD boxed set (as well as the others).  Well worth the price, especially if you have an interest in learning a lot more about Filmation studios.",1149638400,6,1548,4.945945945945946

The heroes are awesome and villains are downright badass. Every episode is written to perfection, the music is fantastic and even there's a moral lesson at end of each episode. I would definitely recommended for both girls, boys and adults! ""I've got the poweeeeer! ;D

Also I would like to mention i'm 21 year old male and was not born in the He-man generation. However, this cartoon still stands up todays standard and is definitely without a doubt one of the best cartoons ever made!",1495843200,,610,4.865384615384615
