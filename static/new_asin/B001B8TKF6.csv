This is a really cheap and obscure film with nothing special or elaborate. The obvious low-budget has hampered the film and has kept the FX to a minimum. These budget restraints have probably been responsible for the ugly and cheap scenery because they picked some ghetto and a dump site for the filming locations. Other parts of the film take place indoors at an unattractive nightclub and some other indoor places. I guess it's supposed to be some western type flick. I checked the IMDB, and it says it was filmed in New Haven, CT.; they just picked some trash locations there that they could afford to shoot the film and churned out a simple and cheap action flick. There's this guy who's trying to avenge his brothers death; he's fighting these assorted thugs in this ghetto area. So within the first half hour, there's some stuff like the following: a sex scene with clothes on, which obviously doesn't belong in an exploitation flick; ugly ghetto scenery with that dump; scenes from that badly designed nightclub that the western guy goes to; and there's a shootout with only a low amount of blood. Throughout the film, there's some other shootouts; but the blood content in the movie is really low with virtually no FX, and there's no nudity. Directing is Ok and acting may be considered passable for something really cheap like this. I thought the main soundtrack was decent, and the film did have a certain cheap charm to it that I liked. There's no suspense, atmosphere, or anything really interesting about it. Nevertheless, I actually liked it but many won't.

This is a cheap film, so it has some problems with quality. It doesn't look great and has grain, but the full-frame transfer is good overall.

THE DISTURBANCE
This is the best of the bunch. Gritty, depressing, quite violent and with a dark tone, this film that deals with a maniac plagued by psychotic hallucinations is really good. Within the first 10 minutes, it captures your attention with that guy awaking from a dream when this person's face starts to ooze and split open to reveal a cool looking demon. This is followed by a topless sex scene and that demon appearing again when he looks in the mirror. There's a good amount of topless scenes in the film, it's well scored and directed, and I thought that the guy who plays the maniac did a good acting job. It gets bloody in some scenes, and the film is quite mean-spirited and violent. His hallucinations are cool also. There's one sequence with a cat in a basket that overflows with blood. He throws the cat in the washing machine, and I like what happens next. The climax is also really good with him really loosing it and hallucinating. The grainy low-budget film quality helps to give the entire film a depressing type atmospheric quality to it. Scenery is nothing special, but it might not be a good idea to make the film look to nice.

It could use some improvements with color and contrast, and the film is grainy; but this is probably because of how this low-budget flick was filmed. Some may like the fact that the transfer doesn't look too pristine.

POSED FOR MURDER
This obscure slasher is slow at times with the first murder happening over 30 minutes into the film, but it delivers some good topless scenes with Charlotte Helmkamp and has some juicy gore scenes. It doesn't deliver in terms of scenery and atmosphere, but I thought the directing was pretty good. It should've picked up the pace in parts, but it's redeemed by the nudity and gore. The beginning of the film during the credits shows pictures of Helkamp with a soundtrack that I thought was good; the movie may have been inspired, to some extent, by Bava's DELIRIUM with Serena Grandi. If you like 80s slashers, you might have interest in it.

The quality on this is the best out of the bunch and looks very good.

The packaging on this set is nice with you getting 3 separated cases.",1425513600,,3909,4.649782923299566

Years before the internet, renting a video was done from a Mom and Pop enterprise, and videos like this were what you got. Frequently, the cover was not like the videos contained within, but that was part of the apeal for a dollar a day rental. The boxes for films like this were all too often sunfaded and curved in from having the shrink wrap continue shrinking.  And remember, Be Kind, Rewind.  Truly these films are a nostalgia trip for those of us who remember seeing these films on the shelf, and quite honestly, they would lose something if they were 16*9 enhanced.  These were made to be seen in 4*3, in all their USA Up All Night-esque glory. They should call this the VHS Collection, because after each film instead of returning to the menu, I expect the sound to squeal and the screen to turn blue.  So, if you want to check out your father's home video experience, order this promptly.  And by the way, I am not reviewing each of the films because that would diminish from the experience!
