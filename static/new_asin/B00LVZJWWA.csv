6508247,5,B00LVZJWWA,I'm real thankful they finally re released the forth pokemon movie. About time. I wish I got the movie when it first originally came out which was in 2003. It's harder to find order movies. I always love when they re release movies that hard to find.,1430956800,,250,4.340425531914893
6508248,5,B00LVZJWWA,Always loved the pokemon movies and I do love this one.  This one replaced my old copy because it got so scratched it wouldn't play.,1430352000,,132,4.28

6508250,5,B00LVZJWWA,"This is a re-re-re-release of the 4th Pokemon Movie and this time it's in widescreen but it looks cropped. Even though you could see more the left and right sides, you see less from top and bottom. And, there is no special short! The DVD cover says its fullscreen but it's not. Not bad for the price though!",1412985600,8,307,4.310344827586207

6508255,5,B00LVZJWWA,My son loves it!!,1470873600,,17,3.5
6508256,5,B00LVZJWWA,Out of the first four movies this one is probably my 2ND favorite with the my favorite being pokemon 2000 with that being said I grew up 1st gen at the absolute very begining! Don't get me wrong they're all amazing and can't go wrong with any of the movies but the animation and vibrant colors used in pokemon 4 ever are just gloriously well done.,1469923200,3,347,4.2727272727272725

6508259,5,B00LVZJWWA,I haven't watch Pokemon since I left Japan but this brought memories back with the 20th anniversary and all. The movie had a plot and the children will love it as well. I felt like a kid again in Japan and this movie is worth it,1462838400,2,228,3.9782608695652173

8668401,5,B00LVZJWWA,"My daughter loved this movie. We're watching Pokemon together, and started with season 1 and the corresponding movies with each season. This was prob the best movie so far out of the 4 we've watched.
DVD was perfect.",1512691200,,216,4.7105263157894735

8668406,3,B00LVZJWWA,I prefer the first three over this one. Might just be that this came out as my generation was more or less losing interest in Pokemon.,1491523200,,134,4.1923076923076925
8668407,4,B00LVZJWWA,"I wish a decent blu-ray of this existed but as I go through season four, I had to simply stream it in. The picture quality was good but I missed the Pikachu Short. As far as story, this one is definitely pretty weak. I do love how they kept the original soundtrack (having a cheaper budget helped them out in this movie and the next because they couldn't fiddle with it as much).",1485043200,,379,4.205479452054795
8668408,4,B00LVZJWWA,"This a Pokemon cartoon and it is good.  It doesn't compare to the great Japanese animators, but it is well done and has an interesting story.  Young pokemon fans will enjoy it.",1482624000,,176,4.46875
