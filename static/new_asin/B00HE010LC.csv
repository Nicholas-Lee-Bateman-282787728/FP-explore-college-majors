Additions / Corrections to this list are welcome.

The Criterion Blu-Rays of THE FRESHMAN, SAFETY LAST and SPEEDY are based on the same prints that New Line used
I have no complaint, especially as the New Line DVDs are now out-of-print and starting to get pricey.
They were produced by the Harold Lloyd estate from the original negatives.
Unlike a lot of silent films that are in terrible shape, the Harold Lloyd negatives were stored in a vault on the actor's estate.

Criterion has added additional bonus material, including four shorts that were not on New Line,
plus Kevin Brownlow's 1989 PBS documentary ""Harold Lloyd: The Third Genius"" (with SAFETY LAST) - watch this first if you are new to Harold Lloyd.

I hope Criterion will reissue the remaining New Line titles along with additional shorts.
THE KID BROTHER (1927)  already has a Carl Davis score and would be a likely candidate for the Criterion treatment,
but I have no inside information.",1403654400,10,5956,6.634961439588689
6155655,5,B00HE010LC,"It's not remarkable that one of the most popular comedies of the 1920's is still tremendously funny.  (Some would say funnier than anything made today.  In fact, I would say that.)  The amazing thing is that it doesn't look old.  Once in a while there are a few slight indications that original elements had seen plenty of service, not that most people would notice while absorbed in the story.  But never are there any signs of forced restoration.  The image could not be this sharp and crisp if the preservation elements had been highly compromised by film condition or inferior lab work.  The viewer need not make allowances for the extreme age of this film.  It plays as well now as when new, and looks it.  I highly recommend it as an eye-opener for anyone who thinks that silent movies creak.",1400198400,8,798,4.602836879432624
6155656,4,B00HE010LC,"""The Freshman"" is a silent film comedy about a young man, played by Harold Lloyd, who is desperate to be popular at his college. He does this by trying out for the football team, hosting a fall dance, giving a speech at the school, and more.

The movie is so funny because it utilizes Harold Lloyd's genius in so many ways. His facial expressions and physical comedy are tremendous. The leading lady who plays opposite him is gorgeous, and the scenes are well choreographed.",1399593600,4,474,4.642857142857143
6155657,5,B00HE010LC,This is very much an Harold Lloyd movie.  Criterion did a very good job in bringing it up to blu-ray quality.  I didn't really pay attention to the music so i suppose it fit with the movie.  The movie had many of his characteristic  dilemma's and eventual resolutions.,1398470400,2,268,4.520833333333333
6155658,5,B00HE010LC,"Everytime I have to explain why I spend more than 30 dls on a movie, I explain that Criterion is the home video equivalent of an ""annotated"" edition of a classic book, And sometimes, even the best possible edition, plus the ""Cambridge Companion"" in a bundle. That holds true for this film, that blu-ray.com reviews this way: ""So far, this is one of the year's very best releases"" ([...]). And that kind of praise is reserved only to stuff like the beautiful Zatoichi box-set, the indisputable champion of 2013.",1396828800,6,510,4.741573033707865
6155659,5,B00HE010LC,"Another great winner from our friends at Criterion! This may just be the release of the year!! Harold Lloyd fans rejoice at this amazing blu ray/DVD set Criterion has released onto the world (at least the region A world). Have loved Harold Lloyd since discovering his films on Turner Classics and New Line's massive box set of his amazing work. All his films are preserved and in great condition from seeing these in the New Line box set. And Criterion did an awesome job on releasing our favorite THE FRESHMAN onto blu ray coming from a 4K master. This is the time I crave that the 4K technology catches up, because blu ray upconverted to 4K is not the same as real 4K. And this great film should be seen in real 4K. It is hard to believe this film was released in 1925! The beauty that lies within this masterful work is a sight to be seen. I don't care how old this movie is, but blu ray brings out more detail and sharpness that the DVD (even upconverted) cannot come nowhere close to the blu ray's resolution (although the DVD in this set looks good).
There are tons of special features that we come to expect from Criterion. Several short films in HD among others. I am still impressed on how great this set represents the brilliance of Harold Lloyd's masterpiece. Criterion once again proves why they are the best when it comes to releasing classics onto blu ray. Even if you are not a fan of silent films, this is one funny movie. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1395792000,5,1458,4.4440298507462686
6155660,5,B00HE010LC,"I picked this up a couple days early at a local record store and have been glued to my set enjoying the film and the extras!
Unlike others , I enjoy the BR / DVD sets.... I have a DVD player in my computer and in my office so the ability to watch the recent Criterion releases in both Standard and hi definition with a single purchase I find helpful ...and a space saver for my collection, but I digress.

Normally I cringe when I hear Harold Lloyd described as ""the third genius"" with Chaplin and Keaton.  In my humble opinion at his very best he approaches what the other two did as a matter of routine and I even wondered if I should buy this.  I think what put me over the top was that I rate ""The Freshman"" as one of his best and I know his films are in good state so it should look much more like a vintage Chaplin and much better than (sadly) most of the Keaton classic films of the 20's and the print does not disappoint.
I do believe that this was Lloyd's most popular film and while not of the ""thrill"" variety that he popularized shows his character at his most earnest and likeable. This also predates Buster Keaton's ""College"" by a couple of years.

But this is very expensive for a film of just over an hour in length (76 minutes) so how can I rate it that high? As I said, it is a good film , one of his best and a classic of the silent era.  The bonus features are another thing all together and why I rate this a 5 star value. The first one I checked out was a delicious 7 minutes from Mr Lloyd's appearance on ""What's My Line?""  where he displays such charm and humor.  The nearly 40 minute interview with archivists and friends of Mr Lloyd , Kevin Brownlow and Richard Correll had me thoroughly entertained as well.  Author John Bengston , as he has done for others like Keaton, presents a visual essay on the various locations used for filming.  I should add that as a lifelong resident in Southern California that feature may appeal to me more than those in other parts of the world.  There is a half hour segment from the film ""Harold Lloyd's Funny Side of Life""  which contains an introduction from Mr Lloyd to The Freshman and a chunk of that  feature film featuring many greatest hits clips from his career!  The bonus features continue with 3 very classic Lloyd short films ""The Marathon"" from 1919 , ""High and Dizzy"" and "" An Eastern Westerner"" both from 1920 with newly created scores.  There is a great audio commentary for the main feature with the previously noted Correll, Leonard Maltin and Richard Bann. I almost forgot another half hour of film where Mr Lloyd was being honored by USC fraternity in 1963 ...featuring Steve Allen and Jack Lemmon paying tribute to him and his own appearance.

So... what we have is a legitimate silent classic, lovingly presented and surrounded with a plethora of bonus features that enhance the experience for me to a great extent and I can say have made this a very treasured part of my film collection.  Highly Recommended!",1395532800,16,2993,4.365765765765766
6155661,4,B00HE010LC,"Plot is somewhat predictable but still the comedy bits and situations (Lloyd's ""dance"" of introduction, call me Speedy, etc.) are laugh out loud funny.

6155663,5,B00HE010LC,"Lloyd was one of the three great comic geniuses of the silent era -- and my favorite (although Keaton is a close second; I was never quite as enamored of Chaplin). This is one of his best (maybe second best to Safety Last),

I always wanted to see this movie ever since I saw The Sin of Harold Diddlebock (aka Mad Wednesday) -- that filnm begins with a short segment from The Freshman.

This is a typically superior Criterion release.",1432857600,,434,4.4125
6155664,5,B00HE010LC,"This is a very entertaining old silent film! Harold Lloyd's comedy style is a bit different from Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton--he takes his time to set up each joke, and the payoff really works!",1425340800,,198,4.685714285714286

6155666,5,B00HE010LC,"The movie is a true classic, as many others have noted. It's a truly funny picture that holds up even in our modern times.
I bought from Amazon and received the package on time and in great condition. The film is a Criterion release, so it has a wonderful look to it's packaging. Highly recommended for fans of classic comedy.",1413417600,,326,4.45
6155667,5,B00HE010LC,"You can't go wrong with Harold Lloyd. This film his box office triumph the even had a sequel made some 15 years later.
Sort of, the Sin of Harold Diddlebock, is fun, but the Freshman is what it's all about. It's what defined Lloyd as one of the big three of the silent era. He's right up there with Chaplin and Keaton. If you don't believe me, buy the movie and see fir yourself!",1408233600,,379,4.135135135135135
6155668,5,B00HE010LC,Harold Lloyd is one the greats from the silent era along with Chaplin and Keaton. THE FRESHMAN was his most popular release and has been beautifully restored on the Criterion Blu-ray/DVD release. There are plenty of outstanding Extras included on this set and it has a fine commentary track (carried over from an earlier release) as well as couple of restored Lloyd shorts. If you can about the comedy from the the silent movie era then this is a must have disc.,1407715200,,462,4.646341463414634
6155669,5,B00HE010LC,"This movie is rad. I am a big fan of Harold and I am very happy to have this movie in my collection. My only complaint, which admittedly is no fault of criterion, is that the bluray will not play without updating a security key and since I don't have the internet at home just on my smartphone I can't watch it. Not a big deal since they give you the dvd. Unfortunately, now I can't watch any of my other blurays that I bought and payed good money for, including safety last. I will never buy another bluray now and I've basically got a 500 dollar pile of drink coasters. This is no fault of criterion so it definitely gets 5 stars and is still worth it, but all this drm is crazy and all it does is screw over the people who payed good money for their movie. Sorry to rant I just don't want other people to have the same problem. So if you don't have the internet, DON'T EVEN PUT THE BLURAY IN or say goodbye to all the other blurays you can't watch anymore.",1405641600,,959,4.079365079365079
6155670,5,B00HE010LC,"Chaplin was the tramp, Keaton was the stone face,and Lloyd was just a regular guy and this was one of his best work-superb. Thanks to Criterion for restoring it to its original brilliance.",1405468800,2,188,4.7272727272727275

8631801,3,B00HE010LC,"The first time I saw this movie, years ago, it struck me as very funny.  Seeing it for the second time, it seems merely silly.  Notice that early in the movie, the year is identified as 1925; contradictorily, the invitation announces it's 1921.  Implausibly, a flower shop is open after 10 p.m.",1518220800,,294,4.615384615384615
8631802,5,B00HE010LC,"I prefered the version on the Harold Lloyd DVD collection.

The quality is stunning on this Blu-ray, however I preferred the version on the Harold Lloyd collection because it had a very interesting commentary from Leonard Maltin and others.  Although I like older classic movies very much, silent movies are a bit of a struggle for me. The commentary that is on the Harold Lloyd collection made the movie much more interesting for me.

Don't get me wrong, I do recommend this Blu-ray.  The Freshman is a hilarious movie on many levels. The comedy is of a different style than what we've become accustomed to over the years. In a silent movie all of humor has to be done visually.

After watching all of the Harold Lloyd movies I could get my hands on, I got a couple of books about him also. A very interesting person who overcame many obstacles to achieve success.

Harold Lloyd was always active in republican politics. He even served as a delegate to the 1948 Republican presidential convention.",1515974400,,998,4.706896551724138
8631803,5,B00HE010LC,good,1465776000,,4,4.0
8631804,5,B00HE010LC,"Not only are the prints pristine, I suppose largely thanks to Lloyd having kept so many of his own films safe and sound; BUT, here they are fully restored.  Scratches, blotches, blemishesall gone.  Those involved took time to find alternative camera negatives that were the best to view.  And the film-to-digital scans are perfect!  Wow!  Crisp, clear and full of detail.  You can read the street signs down the block from the actors!

To match the images, the musical accompaniments are fantastic!  One film has only a piano, the others have full orchestra.  They are ALL  full of whimsy, imagination, and highlight the visual activities without fear of being castigated for momentary Mickey Mousing (matching the action exactly with the music).  AND all the soundtracks are recorded ABSOLUTELY perfectly IN SYNCHRONIZATION WITH THE MOVIE!  FOR A CHANGE!

Finally, someone did it right!

I have Kinos THE HAROLD LLOYD COLLECTION and I was unimpressed with the short movie An Eastern Westerner.  But the same movie in THIS collection was riveting!  When you have a truly first-rate, gorgeous print like this, it makes it MUCH easier to watch!  AND, Carl Davis is at his finest as a composer for comedies.  In the past, his music did not always work, like his soundtrack for Buster Keatons The General, which is WAY WAY WAY too valiant and noble and regal with soaring rich horns and full orchestra blah blah blah.  No whimsy at all.  None.  But HERE, for this movie, Davis composed the perfect soundtrack.  Ill watch the movie again soon just because the music is so great.

 (ASIDE:  Incidentally, why are so many people offended by sound effects?  In this compilation is a selection from Harold Lloyds Funny Side of Life (1966).  Lloyd used orchestral music (his preference over a piano or even an organ), AND he put in sound effects FOR EVERYTHING!  Often the sound effects actually cover over the music for long periods of time.  Well, if sound effects were good enough for Harold, they're good enough for me!  They really bring the film to life and make the movie seem less antique (less silent).  Fortunately, Carl Davis actually does add some sound effects in some of his scores.  The more better, I say!)

  ((ASIDE TO THE ASIDE: By the way, I do not mean funny sound effects.  All the sound effects that Harold liked were realistic and made the movie seem more natural, heightening the dramatic effects (of falling through a glass windshield, a car hit by a train, doors shutting, etc.).  Carl Davis mostly follows this principle and his modest sound effects are always appropriate.))

Now about THE FRESHMAN itself:  The Freshman is not at all my favorite Lloyd picture and not a movie I can watch more than once a decade (except for the brilliant tuxedo routine); nor is this my favorite Carl Davis score (I wish Davis were less repetitious, more witty, and used some imagination to highlight the action in the football game! [Robert Israel's score is MUCH better.]).  However, Harold would probably have strongly approved the full orchestral treatment (and added complete sound effects to cover up the musics deficiencies).

And really, considering the incredible restoration of the image, the marvelous sound of a full orchestra accompaniment, and the film as an excellent example of superb character-development script-writing well, these are all such grand accomplishments that any criticism is petty.  I swear that the picture looks like it was shot yesterday.  On Blu-ray the details are startling.  When the actors smile, even in many of the extreme far shots you can see the lines of cheek bones and you can see the characters teeth; you can see the irises of their eyeballs.

 (ASIDE:  35mm film was quite an invention, and captured an astonishing amount of detail even in the earliest Mlis movies.  How I wish THEY were available in true high-definition!).

So  David Shepard, Flicker Alley, Serge Bromberg and Lobster Films, Kino Lorberall you guys, pay attention!!!  Criterion does it right!  You could, too;  but your Chaplin Mutual series, much of Kinos Keaton and Langdon anthologies, some of Lobsters/Flicker Alleys Mlis films, and even many early SOUND movies (Kinos Lost Keaton) have sound that is all out of sync to the picture.

How in the world do you spend so much of your time and energy and money restoring a film, and hiring the best composers in business to sensitively match sound-to-image, and then RUIN

RUIN

your whole product by being so sloppy with the final editing that the sound is not even in sync with the picture?

And it happens ALL THE TIME!  Why?  How can this be???  How can you DO that to your product???  After all that work???  I would be a screaming maniac if that happened to a movie of mine!  Follow Criterions exampleor whoever did this work!  Holy crap, even cheap-o GRAPEVINE VIDEO has soundtracks in sync with the picture (example: their Larry Semon movies)!

My only complaint about this release is that I do NOT need 2 DVDs AND a Blu-Ray.  THREE DISCS!  What can I do with all these disc?  I guess Ill give away the DVDs",1460073600,3,5086,4.842840512223516

8631807,5,B00HE010LC,"This was a great silent film, and a hilarious comedy. For not having the advanced technology of today this film was wonderfully crafted, and easy to fallow. The Freshman is about a guy named Harold Lamb (Harold Lloyd) who goes to college with the goal to become popular, and with a dream to become the most popular guy in college. As he fights to become the most popular guy in college he faces many embarrassing moments, and makes many embarrassing mistakes witch will have you laughing up a storm. While fighting for his dreams he somehow loses sight of who is and pretends to be who others want him to be. On this journey Harold must learn to be himself if he ever wants to accomplish his goals and conquer his dreams.",1453161600,,721,4.46969696969697
8631808,3,B00HE010LC,"I got this movie in part because of the recommendations someone made in their review of another Harold Lloyd film. The restoration (this edition is put together from the best condition parts of European and American original theatrical releases) is the best I've seen from these old movies. It looks almost perfect.
The story itself, however, I just didn't care for, I'm not sure why.  New guy at school gets led around by older students (too many of them looked old enough to be professors), taken advantage of, used for amusement by them.then he saves the football game (he doesn't realize he's only on the team as a joke) by stepping up to play at the last moment. All is well and everyone really likes him now! I don't ""get"" why this movie was Lloyd's biggest hit.
I like some of the extras better, the three shorts each have their moments (High and Dizzy has some very impressive window ledge walking), and ""Harold Lloyd: Big Man on Campus"" tells how many of the film locations still exist.
I don't think I'll watch this one very often",1451520000,,1040,4.591397849462366
