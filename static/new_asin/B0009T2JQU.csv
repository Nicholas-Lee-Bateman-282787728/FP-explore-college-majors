Imagine my surprise when I rushed home, tore open the Amazon package, and found a HUMAN baby on the cover. This book is about some kinda sub-par football team?

*sigh*

I looked at my snarling, rabid little bundles of teeth and claws with disappointment. ""Well, back to the drawing board!"" I thought, as I threw some raw meat into their pen.

So what's a wolverine farmer to do? In my angst, I decided to try to adapt the horribly mis-named book to suit the needs of my, you know, actual BABY WOLVERINES.

First, I tried dressing each of the little guys up in some UM gear, but they shredded (and ingested) these insanely expensive garments in no time.

Worse yet: I found yellow and blue polyester in their droppings a day later.

Fearing that they might be over-agitated, as baby wolverines are apt to be, I've decided that today I'm going to try playing them the UM fight song, per the book's advice.

As I write this, I've turned up my computer's speakers, have brought up ""The Victors"" in iTunes, and am pressing ""Play.""

WHOA that's loud!!!

The little buggers seem to be getting a bit nervous, and baring their fangs. OW! Hey, you little basta  asgg

8066371,5,B0009T2JQU,"I got this for my son when he was 2.  He loves watching it, especially the chapter with the UM Marching band playing The Victors on the football field.  He straps his drum over his neck and marches around the family room playing his drums along with the band.  We have played this part of the DVD over and over and over ......  He is now 4 and he still loves the marching band.  He wants to play tuba in the marching band.  I also take him to 1-2 games a year and the best part is that he wants to stay for the full game so that he can see the marching band play after the game is over.",1242604800,,586,3.841666666666667
