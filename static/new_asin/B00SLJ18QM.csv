This is an alternative or futuristic Tokyo where the areas of the City are ruled and controlled by 23 gangs or `tribes'. If you like `The Warriors' then you will get this angle. They are all fairly distinct; except the thing they all have in common is rap music and hip hop (or hippitty hoppetty to the older out there amongst you).
*May contain mild plot spoilers*.
There is a lot of nudity on display with a plot line that seems to have forgotten to take its Ritalin and has let the imagination go wild - I was reminded a few times of the wonderful Peter Greenaway. The plot is all around taking control of Tokyo, sexual exploitation, cannibalism, sado masochism, bizarre outfits and hair styles and some `wicked beats' - as the `homies' say on the streets.

The characters are all over the top, there is tons of fighting - using everything from Martial arts wire work to blinged up AK - 47's oh yes and a Gatling gun. There is a lot of English used in the raps - mostly the profane sort but also some rather brilliant portmanteaus such as `wan - ksta'.

It is endlessly inventive in terms of the violence and the props as well as the lurid imaginations of all the over the top performances.

This is enough to make you like hip hop - that is if you are not already a fan. Also I was a bit disappointed at first as I wanted this to be the usual type sci-fi violent film. However; once I had given it some time I just could not get enough. This is one I shall be raving about for some time to come. This is what cinema should do - excite, challenge, break the rules, make up some new ones and have a bloody good laugh - screamingly recommended.",1438992000,,1771,4.280597014925373

Non stop action but if you pay attention no real life present--its pure fantasy and if I need fantasy I watch porno. This flick remind me Death Race--same idea--hide emptiness behind action.",1437004800,,340,4.666666666666667
