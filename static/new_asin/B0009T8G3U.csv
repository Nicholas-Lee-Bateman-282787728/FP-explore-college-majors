8066420,3,B0009T8G3U,"Specifically regarding, Desert Trail with Dawn Rider from Cascadia Labs. These two John Wayne films from 1935 were produced by Lone Star Pictures which cranked out films in five days. Unlike other Cascadia releases, this has one excellent version of an early Hollywoood ""Cowboy"" or ""Western"" film. The  Desert Trail source print was in excellent condition. But, the Dawn Rider print was in poor-to-fair condition.

So, if you can find this at a good price then buy it for just Desert Trail. Look for another version of Dawn Rider because it is worth watching but not this version.",1173398400,,580,4.908163265306122
