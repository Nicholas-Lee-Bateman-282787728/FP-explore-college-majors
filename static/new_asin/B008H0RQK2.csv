8527811,4,B008H0RQK2,LOVE the dvd of the concert which is why i got it but i feel as if the picture quality wasn't that good. :/ Other than that there are lots of pictures so i guess it makes up for it but the packaging was also kind of ehh so I'd recommend only if you're a true Inspirit and need it for your collection or just want to watch the videos!!,1381622400,,334,3.7857142857142856
