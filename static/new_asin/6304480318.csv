In the end its those no-good thugs that deservingly get slammed.  Whoa! Good stuff. Personally speaking now, from the opening scene at the  gym to the walk to ring with that smashing finale, I could virtually see,  hear and smell the actual world of a fighter.  I may be crazy, but after  that fatal beating the mob gave big brother I ached all over as if I were  the poor sap. (Except that I am still thankfully alive of course). And the  crunch of ME slamming onto the pavement below the window?...oof! As for all  the other punching blows..the sight & sound of high energy fisted  leather exploding on MY flesh...well, it's almost too much for me to take.  But I keep going back..for more. Viewing that is.",947635200,4,863,4.5816993464052285
