When it arrived, I was impressed with the quality of the DVD case. There are 2 discs in the case. Both with the same artwork. Neither is labeled 1 or 2, so you have to guess. I chose the top disc. I was wrong. I first noticed the horrible menu. It's simply a computer type prompt menu with text. Very amateurish and unprofessional.

I switched discs and the garbage menu is the same on both. Still not worthy of only 1 star though. Once I started chapter 1, that's when I was hit in the face with one of my worst pet peeves. A logo in the bottom right corner, ""SC"". Sinister Cinema didn't create this serial, so they have no business putting their logo on it. Granted it seems to go away after 4 minutes, but I have zero patience for this type of unprofessional behavior.

Regretfully, I still have to recommend this release over Alpha. The picture and sound are much clearer. It's too bad they display underhanded practices. If you don't mind the temporary logo, and I'm guessing most people won't, then you'll want to purchase from Sinister Cinema. I wish Alpha's release wasn't so shoddy, but it is. So without a better option, this is the one to get.",1523318400,,1369,4.446215139442231
