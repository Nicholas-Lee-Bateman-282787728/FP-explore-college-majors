8278556,3,B0000016VL,"This is one of the only two videos which record Mr. Vasiliev's choreaographic talent - the other one being ""Macbeth"".

Anyuta is in a more lyrical vein. The title role is danced by Ekaterina Maximova, who happens to be Mr. Vasiliev's wife. The story is rather sad and very Russian, being based on a short story by Tchekov.

It was recorded in a studio and not on a theater stage. Mr. Vassiliev himself plays the role of Anyuta's father, and does some character dancing in the ballet. The language is that of traditional ballet and the style is gently realistic.

A film with rather subdued emotions but still charming and worth having.",1100217600,4,635,4.651785714285714
