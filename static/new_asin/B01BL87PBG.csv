7659472,2,B01BL87PBG,"So....this movie is bad. Its not a good western, or drama - or movie. The lackluster performance is such that I do not recall exactly the plot. I do however remember that the pacing was way off in this film. I recall being disappointed in the theater and thinking that the more unique westerns that I've seen in the previous months: Hateful Eight and Bone Tomahawk (both oddly enough with Kurt Russell). These two are on the far end of the Western spectrum - but they were certainly unique.

You just don't care as much about the characters because this short film's pacing is choppy and not memorable.

Really wanted to like this.",1460764800,3,631,4.575221238938053
7659473,5,B01BL87PBG,"Directed by Gavin OConnor, JANE GOT A GUN is a handsomely photographed, gritty Western, and one of the best of the genre that Ive seen in some time.

The deceptively simple plot centers on Jane Hammond (Natalie Portman), who has built a life in rugged New Mexico with her husband (Noah Emmerich) and young daughter.

One day, her husband arrives home, riddled with bullets.  He has had a run-in with John Bishop (Ewan McGregor) and his gang.  Because of an incident that occurred years ago, the outlaws want to see the entire family dead.

Jane leaves her child with a neighbor, then while her husband rests from his wounds, she seeks the help of Dan Frost (Joel Edgerton), a man from her past, to help her fend off Bishop and his small army.

During the course of this often-violent drama, we learn the sometimes-surprising back-stories of these characters through brief flashbacks that do not impede the forward action.  However, to reveal more of the plot would not be fair to the viewer.

The actors in JANE GOT A GUN are first-rate and there are some terrific action sequences.  Edgerton co-wrote the tight screenplay with Brian Duffield and Anthony Tambakis.

On Blu-ray+ Digital HD from The Weinstein Company via Anchor Bay Entertainment.

7659474,5,B01BL87PBG,"It was fun seeing Natalie Portman, and Ewan McGregor in a different film together other than Star Wars. I am not a fan of Westerns, but this movie was a must see. I enjoyed this movie, and I will be ordering this.",1459728000,10,213,4.095238095238095
7659475,5,B01BL87PBG,"I completely agree with Martina, the previous reviewer. And yes, I too am a woman who has faced the hardships of being a trailblazing single mom, so the only thing I would add is that, perhaps this awesome movie was mis-marketed. Yes, it's a classic Western in that there's the good guys against the bad guys in the old Wild west, and there's lots of shooting and violence. But beyond that, it's not a traditional Western. The story is told and viewed from the female protagonists perspective and she is the main center of the story. I feel many male Western lovers were disappointed by this, and by elements of the classic love story in here too.

This film is gorgeous in the story telling the acting and the cinematography. Bad reviewer's are either millennial hipsters who only like millennial hipster movies or people who just simply expected one thing and got another.

Open-minded movie-watchers, judge for yourselves!

Awesome movie, with awesome surprise ending.

Highly recommended.",1459036800,49,992,4.957831325301205
7659476,5,B01BL87PBG,"I loved this western.  It was a great story and Natalie rocked the role she played.  You HAD to infer some of the content and story, and that is part of the charm of this film.  Obviously the previous reviewer likes to be told everything about the story in order to feel satisfied, but, some viewers like myself enjoy making inferences and their use of historical education to fill in the gaps. Women during that time had very few choices, and if left alone they could be complete victims of their surroundings.  The story was very clear, Jane felt she was left alone, she thought her father of her child was dead.  She HAD to be strong and fill the shoes she did in order to survive, and she unfortunately, like many of us, trusted the wrong individuals.  I felt disturbed reading the previous reviewers take on this movie.  It was a shallow and thoughtless review, and that is why I had to defend with this rebuttal review.  I loved the movie.  I know what it is like to pioneer and live in a man's world as a single mother, afraid and concerned.  That is why the surprise ending was so wonderful, and such a simple twist of fate.  Sometimes things do end neat and tidy.  Jane Got a Gun made me realize that I too am a survivor, and that woman have been paving the way for those of us who thrive in this great big beautiful maddening world for centuries. Natalie and Demi are both great actresses and this movie is unique to Natalie Portman's style, Demi has her own style!  Demi is one of the role model of toughness in woman roles, and so is Natalie, but in the history of film there are many woman who have craved the way playing tough women.  I love a film that makes me think and allows me to fill in the gaps because so many things could have transpired during that very unsettling time in history, and not any ONE PERCEPTION is correct.
Natalie Portman is OG in JANE GOT A GUN and she rocks her gun.  She made me proud to be a woman and I was so happy that she introduces her strength in her character with so much integrity during such a difficult time and during such difficult circumstances.",1458432000,90,2103,4.315521628498728
7659477,4,B01BL87PBG,"Bill Hammond (Noah Emmerich) with four bullet holes makes it back to his wife Jane (Natalie Portman,co-producer) and warns her the Bishop boys are coming. Jane tries to get help but her husband has a bounty on him. She eventually gets help from Dan Frost (Joel Edgerton) a man who she was once engaged. We know it is New Mexico 1871 and everything else is a mystery. Who are the Bishop boys? What is the history of this conflict? We are feed the information slowly getting half the story at about 30 minutes and the other half at about an hour.

This is a fairly typical western. There is some shooting, killing, horses, and drama. I thought there was too much drama. Natalie Portman reminded me of Demi Moore, tough girl in her performance. Yes, Jane got a gun, but that wasn't overly significant to the tale. I think the author may have been influenced by the Aerosmith song, which didn't play during the closing credits either, but I couldn't help thinking about it. The mystery aspect and flashbacks ate up much of the movie as we awaited the final confrontation with over formula results.

7659481,5,B01BL87PBG,"Stephen King described this film as ""A really good western,"" and he is right. It is beyond any doubt, one of the best. The story is good and so is the acting. What happens in this tragic tale comes out little by little, just as it should, holding our interest. Therefore, I do not want to reveal much. Suffice it to tell just the beginning: a husband returns to his out of the way shack to his wife and daughter shot up by, what he tells his wife, the Bishop gang. He tells her also that Bishop and his gang are coming for him and for her. She and her husband cannot defend themselves against a gang, so she takes her daughter to a friend and goes to the house of a gunfighter. He is very angry at her. He says he told her last time to stay away. He says she needs his help.
As we watch, we find out her history, who she is, who is her husband, who is the gunfighter and why is he angry, will the gunfighter come to help, who is Bishop, why does he want the husband, why does he want the wife, how many men are in Bishops gang, and much more.",1520812800,,1042,3.966666666666667

7659501,4,B01BL87PBG,"Would give it 3.5 if I could.  There's nothing particularly wrong with this movie, and there's a lot to like, it just doesn't always click the way it should.  The plot is a fairly standard western revenge/survival thriller with some melodrama thrown in.  Bad things happened to Portman's character in the past, she escaped with some help and gunplay, now the people she escaped from are looking for vengeance on her.  This is obviously a Natalie Portman star vehicle, and while she turned in a quality performance as she usually does, I found the supporting characters more interesting.  Joel Edgerton and Noah Emmerich were stand-outs.  Emmerich played Portman's husband-of-convenience, and did a good job showing the nuance of a character paying a price for stepping up to protect his wife.  Edgerton plays Portman's emotionally wounded ex-lover, who comes in the protect Portman's character and teach he how to fight.  McGregor plays a good villain, mostly in flashbacks, but there isn't much depth to him.  The action is spread throughout with a long shootout/battle dominated the second-half of the movie.  A fun western but it never really rises up to become something memorable.",1494979200,2,1185,5.125

Very gritty. Cowboy, frontier gritty.  I absolutely loved the feel of Jane Got a Gun.  The scenery was beautiful, characterizations were believeable and there were a number of touching scenes.

I'd heard about the production woes and I am NOT a Natalie Portman fan (I even dislike her in ""Leon: the Professional"", widely considered to be the film that made her a star....I thought she was an awful, non acting brat in the movie) AT ALL.......but I thought the premise was interesting enough, and that I'd watch it. I am so glad I did.

Despite the trailer--this is not a shoot 'em up film. There is very little action, a lot of dialogue and exposition. Which was done really well because I am the Queen of Skipping Through Boring Parts in a Movie, and I did not skip once during this movie. It's a hard love story, between two adults who have been through hardships and tribulations.

My one quibble is that the ending was kind of cheesy, and it had the potential to be a lot darker--especially for an R rated film. Not saying the person had to die (when you see, you'll know), but they kind of glossed over her circumstances, when during that time, she would've been made into a sex slave or prostitute--just to make it into a picture perfect ending. That was my quibble, but overall the film was fantastic....and now it's made me like Joel Edgerton.",1473465600,,1203,4.40990990990991

7659597,3,B01BL87PBG,"The story tells of 'Jane Hammond' ( Natalie Portman) who, with her husband 'Bill' (Ham) (Noah Emmerich) and
young daughter lived in an isolated ranch they'd built-up in Arizona.
When 'Bill' returns home riddled with bullets after a showdown with the Bishop-Boys led by the ruthless 'John
Bishop' (Ewan McGregor) he tells his wife to take their daughter to safety because the gang will be coming for him.
'Jane' takes her daughter to friends in the nearby town on 'Lullaby' then seeks out her former fiancee 'Dan Frost'
(Joel Edgerton) to ask for his help knowing her much-injured husband was in no position to defend their homestead.
At first civil-war veteran 'Dan' turns 'Jane' down, however after she has a run-in with one of the 'Bishop-Gang' he
agree's to help.
'John Bishop' will initially split his gang sending them to the four corners of the valley to locate the whereabouts of
the Hammond ranch which gives 'Dan' who'd learn't a trick or two during the war time to set traps.
With flashbacks to the days when 'Jane' and 'Dan' were together before the war came along and her early encounter
with the Bishop-Gang and her meeting 'Ham' (Bill) who at the time rode with the gang who he walked away from to be
with 'Jane' (She at that time believing 'Dan' to be dead)
The film if but slowly builds up to the inevitable showdown.

action sequences which in my opinion does make it a film to maybe catch on the movie-channels some-time.

There are a few holes in the plot, but not as many as those left in Jane's house after the inevitable shootout.  And the language is at times too modern.

 The producers are still wondering what went wrong with this solidly made Western.  They  spent $25 million to make a strong and conventional Western film with a good cast and some starkly gorgeous New Mexico landscapes.  But the public plunked down a miserly $3 million at the box office.  The horror.
 Natalie Portman leads the cast a Jane, a frontier woman with a young daughter and her ex-outlaw husband (Noah Emmerich).  Emmerich doesn't get much to say and spends most of the movie in bed recovering from a number of bullet wounds.  The male lead, an ex-lover of Jane's, is played by Joel Edgerton with admirable Western tight lipped stoicism.  He needs stoicism in this tragic tale of love gone haywire against a backdrop of outlaw villainy  of the worst sort.  Ewan McGregor gets to play the absolutely evil head of an outlaw band.
 Good acting all around and not at all a bad script by Brian Duffield, Anthony Tambakis and Joel Edgerton himself.  The direction by Gavin O'Connor meets our expectations.
 I think the film failed at the box office because it is simply too grim and too dark.  There is a limit to how much suffering we can gladly watch.  After a hundred years of Westerns the ticket buyers want something spectacular to watch-or at least fun.
 This average three star Western runs for an hour and 38 minutes with an R rating for some good old time killing.",1470182400,3,1394,4.624489795918367

7659629,1,B01BL87PBG,"Same Old Story
This is basically a remake of the 1971 Raquel Welch film HANNIE CAULDER.  Filmed in 2013, it sat on the shelf for three years.  Michael Fassbender was originally cast as Dan Frost but he left the project after clashing with director Lynne Ramsay. After Fassbender departed the project, filming was set to begin the next week but Ramsay dropped the project and didn't arrive on the first day on set. Less than 25 hours later, Gavin O'Connor was hired to replace Ramsay and production was back on track. After Lynne Ramsay departed the project, Jude Law also left the project a day before shooting was scheduled to begin citing that 'he signed on to work with Ramsay'. Bradley Cooper was eventually tapped to replace Law.  Bradley Cooper was cast as the villain but he was forced to drop out before he began filming due to scheduling conflicts. Tobey Maguire, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hiddleston were considered to replace him. Jake Gyllenhaal declined the role. Ramsay quit production on the indie drama Jane Got a Gun (2016) prior to the first day of shooting following a three-day standoff with producer-financier Scott Steindorff in March 2013. Ramsey complained about alleged fraudulent behavior of the producer during pre-production, mainly trying to force upon her an impossible schedule at the last minute while denying her final cut. She felt tricked with false promises and left the production therefore. Ramsay was supposed to receive $750,000 for directing the film plus bonuses, her best salary ever, but she preferred to leave the production because of the producers made it impossible to direct the movie the way she had planed. Ramsey was sued for breach of contract in November 2013, but the resulting lawsuit was settled privately in March 2014: The producers said they would no longer be pursuing the acclaimed director for more than $850,000 (512,000) in reported fees and damages. Famed cinematographer Darius Khondji left the film in solidarity with Lynne Ramsay.

A good story to follow, and the plot develops and gets more interesting as it goes, with the back story being told through flashbacks.

7659661,4,B01BL87PBG,"Possibility of a spoiler.  This western drama directed by Gavin OConnor (Warrior) sat on the shelf for a year and a half before finally coming out in early, 2016.  It was panned by critics and ignored by audiences.  The film had a couple dozen producers including its star, Natalie Portman, famed attorney David Boise and the Weinstein brothers.  The movies cost about $25 million to make and made a fraction of that so at least the loss was spread around.  One critic wrote something to the effect, its hard to know what audience this movie was made for.  Well, I guess that would be me.  So Ill do my best to defend it.

The first thing I noticed was the look of the film.  It takes place in Missouri and New Mexico, shortly after the Civil War.  The vast dusty landscape, at times with a distant horse and rider, has a feel of an old John Ford film.  The sets and costumes look authentic and even some of the dialog seems well placed for the time.  Natalie Portman (Thor) is Jane Hammond.  Portman doesnt try to look ugly, so we know shes not going for an Oscar.  But she is plain and unadorned.  She even appears to have a grey hair or two.

She and her daughter are about to welcome her husband Bill (Noah Emmerich from TVs The Americans) riding to their home when he falls off his horse.  Hes been shot numerous times in the back.  Jane does what she can but learns that Bills old gang of cutthroats is after him and her.  We don't know why at this point, but not to worry.  OConnor and his writers (Brian Duffield, Anthony Tambakis and Joel Edgerton) will ultimately provide the flashback scenes that sets it all up.

Jane needs help defending her family and their homestead.  She approaches Dan Frost (Edgerton, Black Mass), a hard drinking gunslinger who just happens to be Janes former fianc.  Well see that in flashback also as Frost never returned from the War and was presumed dead.  I will admit that OConnor tightens the reigns a little too much in this middle section of the film.  But I think he was trying to set the stage for an appreciation of each character and the events in their lives, including those they are not aware of.

The part of evil gang leader, John Bishop, is played by Englishman Ewan McGregor (The Impossible) in what is certainly a change of pace for him.  Hes excellent as is the rest of the cast.  Portman in particular has delicate role.  She is a mother, a wife, a caretaker and a woman of the frontier.  Shes also lost her innocence.  So she must be tough, and yes she has a gun but is better with a rifle.  Shes been through tough times which will be seen in the backstory.

The final act is one weve seen before.  The last stand, vastly outnumbered.  I bought it all.  The film is no The Searchers or Unforgiven or even Tombstone.  But it is a faithful western and a nice change of pace.

The Blu ray package includes a video resolution of 1080p and has a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The movie was shot on film and retains a grainy, textured quality about it.  The primary colors are absent for the most part.  What we get is dusty shades of brown, tan and grey.  Typical for the landscape and surroundings.  The detail is very good.  Facial blemishes, pores, sweat are easily discernable.  Black levels are very good.  Skin tones well balanced.  The audio comes with DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 as the primary option.  There isn't much going on in the surrounds until the final act.  Then the bullets start flying from every speaker.  The filmmakers weren't shy about loading up the sound effects when the gunfire and explosions begin.  Dialog is properly centered most of the time.  Subtitles are available in Spanish and English SDH.  There are no extras.",1468108800,3,3694,4.468468468468468
7659662,4,B01BL87PBG,"In truth, I've never been big on Westerns.  I find that too many follow the same familiar cliche'  a mysterious cowboy rolls into town, come to find out he's a gunfighter, and in the end he saves the day.  This particular Western, thankfully, does not follow that plotline.  Oh, and after seeing Natalie Portman in riding clothes, suddenly I'm all about Westerns!!

Natalie portrays Jane:  a woman who moves from the Midwest to the Southwest U.S. back in the 19th century, while the civil war is still brewing in the east.  Her fianc fights for the north, but she has no idea whether he is still dead or alive.  Along her path westward, desperation brings her into the company of some bad boy types.  She escaped from them, but now they're looking for her.  That's a brief outline of the plot without giving away too many spoilers.

The Blu Ray really takes you back in time to the old west.  This time, the gorgeous scenery of New Mexico is showcased as opposed to Texas (which is the state I normally think of when it comes to Westerns).  The cinematography is excellent!  I do have one criticism with the making of the movie & that is with the gaffer.  In some of the quiet moments when the characters are whispering, I had a hard time hearing anything they were saying.  Then, in the next scene, when  a gun went off, it would shake my apartment.  Sound quality folks were not 'on their game"" with this one.

If, like me, you have a crush on Natalie Portman, then this movie is a MUST for your collection.  If you don't have a crush on Natalie, then I guarantee that you WILL have a crush on her by the time the final credits roll!!  She is one amazing cowgirl!!  Oh, and did I happen to mention she's built like a cheerleader  & she has bona-fide acting skills?  Whoa!!",1468022400,11,1774,4.404320987654321

7659669,3,B01BL87PBG,"Watchable Western but it's really a simple small wooden shack comes under siege by a gang of bad guys and is defended by a couple of people (good guys).  Portman and Edgerton play the good guys, a former couple who were supposed to marry, but you'll find out through flashbacks why she didn't and has instead shacked up and had a kid with another dude.  The new guy returning home at the start of the film filled with bullets.

For me it was just the same old, same old Western story we've seen a thousand times before and that's coming from someone who doesn't watch a lot of Westerns.  I thought Jane was going to be some sort of bad ass pioneer woman who as the title suggests gets a gun and makes things right.  She does get an actual gun (well quite a few of them) but really the title means she got a hired gun to protect her, as in her ex as she knew since he obviously had feelings for her to want to marry her back in the day, he'd put his life on the line to save her and her new bed ridden man.  Why Portman and her husband didn't just ride to other side of the country or even better get on a ship and go to a different one, rather than buy a farm in the area and hope no one noticed them or gave away their location is beyond me.

With the title which is an obvious play on a famous and highly popular back in the day Aerosmith song title, I was also disappointed we didn't have either a rewritten to fit the plot remake by Aerosmith of that song in at least the credits or a version done by another artist as a cover in the film somewhere.",1467417600,,1553,4.0227272727272725

7659781,3,B01BL87PBG,"There are no decently-sized Hollywood productions that go without incident, but the troubles faced by ""Jane Got A Gun"" are worthy of their own movie. Without falling too deep into the morass of problems that should have derailed it altogether; just days before the shoot was to begin it lost director Lynne Ramsay who simply walked away. Michael Fassbender, then set for the male lead, had vanished not long before that. Then came a litany of casting hires/departures (Bradley Cooper, Jude Law, Jake Gyllenhaal), along with key elements of the crew who didn't want to be part of what was looking like an epic disaster. And really that is just the tip of the iceberg. So that the film even got made and is reasonably competent should be seen as a victory in itself.

Around from the very beginning was producer and star Natalie Portman, whose faith in the material is probably the sole reason for its completion. Gavin O'Connor (""Warrior"") came aboard to fill Ramsay's shoes, and while he does an efficient if workmanlike job, he's hamstrung by a cobbled-together screenplay that can't settle on a consistent tone. Portman plays the titular Jane Hammond, a proud, independent woman living in post-Civil War New Mexico. Moments into the film, her outlaw husband Bill ""Ham"" Hammond (Noah Emmerich) arrives riddled with bullets, shot up by John Bishop (Ewan McGregor) and the Bishop Gang. With the threat that the Bishops will return to finish the job, Jane, not one used to asking anyone for help, turns to the one person who might. That man turns out to be Dan Frost (co-writer Joel Edgerton), a hot-shot gunslinger and Jane's former flame. But he's still pissed over the way things shook out between them, and he's just as likely to shoot her as defend her husband, who he has no reason to like.

Of course he eventually agrees to help, but that means little when there is so much emotional baggage between the two of them. Through an abundance of flashbacks we slowly begin to learn of their tortured past and the many injustices done to Jane over the years, adding a little frontier grit to a story that sorely needs it. The problem is that the screenplay, credited to three different writers, seems torn whether it's a romantic tale of disparate lovers in the Old West, or a violent barnburner in the fashion of ""Unforgiven"".

Fortunately, the siege-like closing act, in which the Bishop Boys shower the screen with deadly buckshot, is closer to the tense thriller this story always demanded. In the midst of the final shootout, all of the pain and resentment faced by Jane and Dan comes crashing to a head, depicted with intensity and honesty by Portman and Edgerton. While they don't share much romantic chemistry, as a gunfighting duo they make an incendiary pair.

The Western has experienced a renaissance of late, and while ""Jane Got A Gun"" isn't a classic by any means, it's a respectable entry in the genre. Few would have predicted that to be the case.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jane-Got-A-Gun/dp/B01BL87P98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jane Got A Gun</a>",1463788800,,3113,5.003861003861004

7659796,4,B01BL87PBG,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

The official trailer for THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN has been released. Last year saw THE HATEFUL EIGHT nominated for several awards. THE REVENANT won for best picture at the Academy Awards. Are we seeing a resurgence in the classic genre known as westerns? Perhaps we are. And this week another released this year makes its way to DVD, JANE GOT A GUN.

Said to be loosely inspired by the 1971 film HANNIE CAULDER (and if it is trust me lose is the main term to consider here) the movie tells the story of Jane Hammond, a woman on the old frontier whose husband Bill (Noah Emmerich) returns home wounded and in need of help, letting her know that John Bishop (Ewan McGregor) and his gang are on their way. Unable to so much as stand to help or to leave, Jane takes their daughter to a nearby friend and seeks out assistance from Dan Frost (Joel Edgerton).

As the movie unfolds we learn the past history of these main characters. Jane was engaged to Dan before he left to join the Civil War. When he never returned she headed west. Bill came to her rescue there and in the process garnered the ire of Bishop. The eventual confrontation between all parties involved is inevitable and makes for the majority of the last third of the movie. And before anyone accuses me of revealing too much let me say that all of this comes out in the trailer.

Like most great westerns the plot here is pretty matter of fact and doesnt contain a lot of ins and outs like most movies being made. Its a simple story with facets weaved into it that fill out the 98 minutes seen on screen. For me thats not a negative aspect but a plus. Far too often movies these days seem determined to fill a full 2 hours with unnecessary items that muddle the plot or add nothing to the story but fulfill the directors need to make as long a movie as possible. The end result is almost always a long movie that drags often. By using a tired and true formula for a western the film makers here have made something both interesting and entertaining.

One thing to note is that the movie seems like its offering a strong female lead in the title role. The trailer for the movie even makes it seem that way. In fact rather than that were presented with co-leads in our story, Jane and Dan. Some will take issue with that. Their problem will come from a 21st century perspective. Women have more rights today than in the past and thats rightfully so. But back in the old west that wasn't the case. And while Jane presents a strong female lead that she would be able to accomplish what happens in this film on her own wouldnt have been possible.

Not only that, the love triangle presented between the characters of Jane, Dan and Bill that is touched on at first and then slowly revealed via flashbacks makes for an interesting story. It adds the depth needed to flesh out an entire film while still never overplaying that and making the movie far too long. It also makes you care more deeply for each person involved in the story and hate the character of Bishop more than you did at the beginning of the film. This format causes the movie to move along at a slower pace than expected in a western but I never felt it hindered anything.

The movie didn't do that well at the box office and was plagued by difficulties getting made. The original male leads intended for the movie backed out and were replaced. The same held true for the original director. Ratings have been unkind to the movie as well. Not knowing that going in and looking into it as I began to write this I reflected back on the movie itself.

Its good. Its not good as in being as memorable as say STAGECOACH good but it is a good movie. The story holds your interest from start to finish. The black hats and white hats are pretty much easy to determine which is refreshing in a world where good guys are often as terrible as those they pursue these days. The acting by all involved is completely believable and that says something. For me a strong performance is one where I lose sight of the fact Im watching someone acting and see just the character instead. Thats in abundance here. And knowing now that director Gavin OConnor was brought in after the project began shows he deserves a tip of the hat.

Fans of the western genre will be happy to see it making a comeback. I for one have wondered why it hasn't happened already. Maybe audiences are too jaded and too invested in superhero films these days (which I love as well). There should always be room for different genres. Heres hoping movies like this continue to be made. For an entertaining evening this is one western worth watching.",1462752000,,4677,4.410196987253766
7659797,4,B01BL87PBG,Surprisingly good. She was the star of the movie as suspected. I would have liked to have seen a bit more of their  life after they dealt with the Bishop brothers.,1462665600,,163,4.258064516129032
7659798,3,B01BL87PBG,"Although this movie wasn't as bad as the box office numbers indicated, I wouldnt rate this as one of the best westerns I have seen either.  I really do think a better title would have helped with drawing in more of an audience than the rather simplistic one it has.  Natalie Portman is ok in the role but I found the chemistry between her and the two main love interests (Edgerton and Emmerich) in the movie, a bit lacking.  Ewan McGregor does a nice job as the villain Bishop but he doesnt get quite enough screen time.  The story itself is decent but feels choppy and is very slow moving.  It really takes way too much time relying on partial flashbacks to fill in the reason that the characters are in the predicament that they are in at the present.  The slow moving story makes it feel longer than its approximate 1 hour and 40 minute run time.  I am not against the flashbacks but the story this could have been done much better than spreading them out over the first half of the movie in small bits and pieces.  The character development of the villain, Bishop, is lacking and could also have been developed a bit more in depth.  The main gunfight action in the movie is primarily toward the end of the movie and to me lacks the excitement of a well done good guy meets bad climatic scene.  In addition, most of the gunfight scenes take place in dimly lit scenes where you rarely see the bad guys which to me that makes it less enjoyable.  The plot is also formulaic and as predictable as they come.  Overall, this is an ok western movie to watch but isn't as compelling as some and its choppy, slow moving feel really hurt my overall opinion of it.  Unlike some western classics that you want to watch over and over, this movie is a rent/watch once and forget about it after.

7659800,2,B01BL87PBG,"This is a review of the film only, not the contents of the DVD or Blu-Ray release.  Now, before reading on please find and take a look at the theatrical release poster (one sheet) for Jane Got a Gun.  Pretty cool right?  I think it's a pretty awesome poster.  If more thought had been put into the actual movie that was put into creating that poster image I'd be a happier film goer right now.  Since I am a lover of western stories and there aren't many of these films being made these days it pains me when one just doesn't work.  Especially one with a talented cast like this one.  The story itself isn't a bad one- A young wife in the New Mexico territory seeks out her former love to help protect her former outlaw husband, and herself, from a band of baddies out to kill him and force her into a life of prostitution.  Jane Got a Gun unfolds very slowly and the action comes in little drabbles here and there.  We also have to wait for fairly important story details to be told to us with flashbacks from time to time.  All of this could have worked but the structure, direction, and an annoying score make this movie seem to be much longer than it's 98 minute running time.  Because some information isn't given until flashbacks we aren't sure what the hell is going on for long stretches of time (at least it felt like it) and once we do learn and think ""Oh, ok, I get it now."" we're annoyed that it didn't come sooner.  The performances by a Star Wars reunion cast- Natalie Portman (Jane), Ewan McGregor (the villain), and Joel Edgerton (Jane's former love) all put in fine enough performances considering what they were working with.  McGregor's character really gets no development beyond being a bad guy, and while those flashbacks explain Portman and Edgerton's backstory it doesn't make up for the plodding pace of the movie.  Not all westerns have to be fun shoot 'em ups (though I do enjoy them) they actually can be carefully paced character studies.  The Ox-Bow Incident and High Noon come to mind, even Shane to a degree, so it can be done.  In the hands of a better film maker the story could have been turned into a fine movie, but director Gavin O'Connor (who's only real claim to fame is the US Hockey team movie Miracle) just doesn't seem to have the chops.  The screenplay was a bit of a mess as far as structure and the aforementioned score is a mess of quasi-stereotypical western music, oddly African sounding drums and voices, and what I think was supposed to be Native American inspired sounds.

7659802,5,B01BL87PBG,"Wow.
I watched Lonesome Dove when I was younger, with my dad, and remembered enjoying it.  But I think it was just that memory of my dad liking it so much that I enjoyed his reactions to it, as I remember little about the actual movie/series.  Since then, I've had no interest in westerns.  I saw the preview for this and thought I'd give it a chance.  I am so glad I did.
Natalie Portman shines in this film, as did the male actors.  The acting, the action, and the scenery were all stellar, in my opinion.  Also, a bittersweet ending... Happy, sad, and hopeful.  It makes me want to watch Lonesome Dove again, as an adult, on my own... And has kindled in me the desire to delve more into the western genre that my dad so loves.

7659814,4,B01BL87PBG,"The title of this 2016 Western is a bit misleading. Natalie Portman's Jane Hammond isn't a gunfighter, she's a settler in post-Civil War New Mexico, living with a daughter and a husband on a small spread. Turns out Jane and her husband Bill have a past with an outlaw gang run by John Bishop.  When that past catches up with Jane, she will be forced to ask for help from embittered former fianc&eacute;e Dan Frost (nicely played by Joel Edgerton)...

""Jane Got a Gun"" is a bit of a slow roller.  It doles out its facts about its characters with a nice precision that slowly fills in the storyline while adding to the suspense.  The result is a plot that is a bit more nuanced than the climactic showdown between Jane and her tormentors that was highlighted in the trailers.  That showdown is in fact dramatic, and savage, but it ends up being almost peripheral to the resolution of the narrative thread.

The post Civil War setting of the story in New Mexico is austere in the extreme, small settlements sprinkled across a tough landscape.  The movie is short and to the point.  This DVD edition has no extras.  Recommended as good entertainment that got overlooked during its brief passage through the theaters.",1462147200,2,1212,4.652582159624413

7659821,4,B01BL87PBG,"One of the things enjoyed about this movie was its subtlety and understated acting - which I think makes it more believable and engaging. One could feel the starkness of what it must have been like, living in that time period and environment. While I often find the use of flashbacks to be distracting, in this case they felt perfectly natural - helping advance the story and its plot twists.

It's a pleasure to see Natalie Portman in a strong woman role, which she certainly deserves. I think Ewan McGregor's villain character could have been fleshed out a bit more. But Boyd Holbrook's creepy yokel character more than made up for that. I was also happy to hear Lisa Gerrard's artistry in the soundtrack.

As some may have heard, there were many difficulties getting this movie produced - but I'm glad Portman 'put her face to it'.",1462060800,2,834,4.666666666666667
7659822,5,B01BL87PBG,"I was intrigued by this film when it was unceremoniously dumped into the marketplace over the holiday movie season last winter.  The advertising was very vague not even suggesting that this was a western  more like a shoot-em-up in the Tarantino-Ritchie vein.  For all I knew it could have been a cinematic rendering of an Aerosmith song not a meditative character study.  Regardless my interest was piqued by the presence of Natalie Portman who gave one of the all-time great performances by an actress in ""Black Swan"" but as luck would have it the film was gone from theatres almost as soon as it got there.  Westerns aren't a particularly easy sell and this had to be a difficult one.  The setting of the film is intimate and concerns itself with personalities and story over gunplay.  The protagonists and antagonists are not purely good or evil rather they are portrayed in subtle shades of gray.  The film starts with Jane's fur trader husband Bill Hammond (Noah Emmerich) falling off his horse after being filled with lead by the nefarious Bishop boys.  The film straddles time and place to meticulously and deliberately relate how Jane, a homesteader from Missouri, arrives in the New Mexico territories circa 1871 with a vicious gang wanting her and her family dead.  Portman's Jane is a portrait of strength and understatement.  Intuitively Portman knows that it is imperative to dial it down allowing the audience a moment to hate Jane before discovering her true nature and modus operandi.  Joel Edgerton is quite good as Dan Frost acting as a conduit to the audience in trying to understand Jane.  Even Ewan McGregor is quite good as John Bishop projecting good qualities to balance out his sociopathic ones.  There's not a wasted frame or false note in the film's compact running time.  Hopefully this film finds the audience denied it by its distributors.",1462060800,,1870,4.8920634920634924

Man, what a WONDERFUL surprise. I cannot understand the mixed reviews.  Contrast this with the accurately titled ""Forsaken,"" with fearsome leprechaun Kiefer in an unintentionally hilarious vanity role to end all vanity roles.

The plot itself unfolds with surprising and satisfying, poignant, unforeseen developments: that plot is feminist without even trying and believably so without stooping to the cartoonish wish-fulfillment school of Tarantino (let's make a magic black man who will wander unscathed killing whites in the 19th-century South, thereby dumping on the trials and heroism of the REAL heroes of that era).

The bonds that emerge between the central characters are affectiing and effective/

The action is more than adequate.

The acting and cast are top notch: Edgerton and McEwan have the BEST American accents I've ever heard, and well, damn, they are good.

You will REALLY care about the good guys and MAN will you hate the bad guys yet this is a real drama not a cartoon for adults.

7659835,4,B01BL87PBG,"""What! A Natalie Portman Western!? F___ Yes!"" was my excited response when I saw this on Amazon. I think I heard it was in production (2012) a while back, but forgot. It was delayed in production, you might have heard about that fiasco. It included a lot of role changes, with Ewan McGregor finally playing the arch villain after Jude Law, Bradley Cooper, and Joel Edgerton (now playing the good guy) all dropped the role. They also lost the original director, a lawsuit happened, so it's safe to say the film almost didn't get made.

As it ended up, it feels a little rushed and like something is left out here and there. The film is first and foremost an interrupted love story; the couple is parted when he goes off to war, and then things happen that keep them apart. When the film starts, she is married to someone else, but goes to her ex for help fighting off a gang led by pimp - yes, literally - Ewan McGregor. I thought the love story part was poignant, but felt abbreviated. The past romance is told primarily in backstory, and consists mostly of a romantic hot air balloon ride. So, even though I wanted to root for the potential rekindled romance, it didn't really feel strongly like they had been in love. We're told they were, but there's just not a lot to go on.

So most - actually all except for the flashbacks - of the movie happens inside her home, while her war hero ex helps prepare for a siege. The current husband is there but 'under the weather' so not much help. The preparation for the battle is almost a sub-plot; while the part that hooks you is their sharing the stories of what happened to each of them after they parted. In a nutshell - they each didn't realize the other would have stayed faithful if not for tragic circumstances. When they realize this, it sets up the possibility they could end up riding off into the sunset. There is a sunset at the end, some people ride off into it, but I won't say who.

Pay close attention to the captions that signal a flashback. I missed one and had to rewind to figure it out.
Ewan McGregor does quite a good psychopath cowboy. Natalie Portman is great with a combination of grit and vulnerability. She's not a gunfighter in this, but more realistically portrayed as a frontier homesteader who only shoots when left no choice. As she says, ""I learned to shoot so I could hunt."" Her skills are mainly on a rifle.
Ultimately, to me this felt like a sprawling Civil war western romance that was pruned down to 1:40 and can hardly fit in that short time frame. It almost seems like it should have been (or was) a thick novel. It might seem slow moving to some, because it's not so much action oriented as interpersonal drama.

Adult themes like violence, prostitution, mild torture (is that an oxymoron?), Ewan McGregor saying ""are you f----n kiddin me?""",1461110400,19,2826,4.47093023255814

8750475,4,B01BL87PBG,"To me, this movie makes a significant impression as it is being in our age of fewer western films because it plays realistically like an old authentic cowboy story used to be and supplies good scenery and props too. Jane, played by Natalie Portman, is convincing as an authentic woman of the frontier living on a tough untamed land where there is not much law and even less sympathy. Acting out of her bravery she is not invulnerable, yet she is believable as she perseveres through hard and traumatic times. Since she is striking out on her own, Jane gets caught up in several dangerous settings. The man acting as her former love plays great in a role where the two people need each other. The story line could almost be seen as a love triangle plot with some twists. This film raises the audience's spirit as pertaining to the quality of Jane's character and her former fiance's. It is a well done, recent cowboy saga reminiscent of some classic early westerns. The film has a good dose of action but one needs to understand the fill-in information flashbacks to appreciate it properly even though the plot is easy to grasp. One area of repulsion I felt in the film action though, was when the main bad guy was torturing a cowboy or farm hand to death in a semi-graphic episode of the movie. Even so, this show has a bittersweet ending overall and I recommend it to romance and western enthusiasts as well as older movie goers.",1522886400,,1430,4.546511627906977
