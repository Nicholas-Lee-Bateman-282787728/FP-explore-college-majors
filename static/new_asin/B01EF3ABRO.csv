8758406,5,B01EF3ABRO,Zuffa has stopped producing DVD's for UFC events in America (UFC 186) so we are stuck with these more expensive ones produced by a company called Beyond Entertainment in Australia. This is a good deal if you are wanting some of the more recent events especially 193 - Rousey vs Holm and UFC 187 Johnson vs. Cormier. I'm disappointed that they stopped producing the DVD's but at least we have this option I guess.,1468713600,7,412,4.581081081081081
