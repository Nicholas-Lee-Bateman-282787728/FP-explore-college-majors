543625,5,6303046959,"This artistic film has much more to say than you ever imagine. It focuses around a poignant and very often unspoken and voluntary ignored issue: the hidden side of the Big Apple.

Julian Glover makes to my mind his best artistic achievement in his career as a homeless man who meets another homeless young who is worse than him Matt Dillon. He believes is taking superb pictures from his empty camera and Glover supports him in his fantasy: his madness land and unhappy bliss.

As the film goes on, an intense friendship will origin sequences of haunting loneliness and moral misery. Somehow that film reminded me to a cult movie: Sporchi, brutti e cattive (Ugly, bad) an Italian film of the middle seventies directed by Ettora Scola. (See my review about that one)

In the other hand the masterful direction and the impressive locations will demand from the viewer a sensitive approach. Valiant film which survived in the Independient Channel and didn't deserve major acclaims, due possibly to such painful argument.

The secure hand of Hunter led this film to an epic resolution inside the limits and possibilities of this homeless human being.

It's more than obvious to recommend you this curious and admirable artwork that simply overpassed the commercial criterions and circuits to get inmersed in a real nightmare in the middle of the Great City of the World.",1108771200,3,1366,4.921739130434783
543626,5,6303046959,"The film borders on melodramatic at times, but the characters are beautiful and their realness add immeasurably to the impact of this film. Danny Glover is brilliant as the caring, street-wise Vietnam vet who takes care of Matt Dillon's character, a young man burdened with untreated schizophrenia. Both are homeless, through no lack of trying, and both are plagued by illness and a few members of a dumb but dangerous gang leader, Little Leroy, played well by a thoroughly nasty and vulgar Ving Rhames, who terrorizes the men's homeless shelter at Fort Washington.
Matt Dillon (Matt) plays the most sincere, nice guy on the planet. He's not immune to the fact that he's handicapped by his mental illness, but can't overcome it until he meets Danny Glover (Jerry). Together, armed with a little money and so much spirit (not to mention unrivaled positive attitudes), they set out to slowly climb the ""economic ladder"" - as Jerry calls it - and meet some of the most extraordinary characters. Unneccesary forshadowing gives the movie a constant feeling of sorrow, doom, and hopelessness, while the characters involved maintain an every-hopefull attitude about the future.
Not a happy film, but so well done it's hard not to feel it was money and time well spent. You will be forever changed.",1003449600,11,1290,4.976851851851852
543627,5,6303046959,"hopeful  honest  friendship  survival These are all word I relate to the Saint of Fort Washington.
This film inspired me to actually do something about the problem of homelessness. Danny Glover and Matt Dillon star in this wonderfully honest movie that might change your views on homelessness. Dillon gives the best performance I've seen from him. The characters are all very believable. A bit like Of Mice and Men. There are some gently humorous scenes with Matthew, Dillon's character, and Jerry, Glover's character. There are other scenes that can seem foolish on the surface, but touching once you think about it. More films like this should be made.  I recommend it to everyone",994809600,5,682,5.008849557522124
543628,4,6303046959,"Hollywood has a way of glamorizing the worst of life's problems and wrapping everything up in happy endings by a film's end.  Not so with SAINT.  Having dedicated 10 years of my life volunteering with the  homeless on the streets of New York City, I can relate firsthand to the  characters depicted by Glover and Dillon.  There is no question that this  movie is realistic.  The emotions behind the words, the feelings behind the  actions, all of it speaks to the portion of humanity that all of us are  guilty of neglecting as we hurry past them on the busy streets.  Stop and  look, listen and lend a hand.  If you buy or rent one  drama this year,  make it THE SAINT OF FORT WASHINGTON.

This movie really captures the feel of being homeless and what it is like,The film captures the poverty and suffering perfectly with the characters. The scenes of New York  streets and life are excellent and how people behave against the poor and how difficult it is to live in poverty. Because the movie captures this so well you feel for the characters to the point of sadness and respect.

543850,5,6303046959,"This movie not only touched my heart, but also made me realize what homeless people experience. I always walked in front of the Armory without any expectation. Since I saw the Saint of Fort Washington, I wonder if I would find among the homeless people who still go to the Armory shelter to sleep, Jerry. The story takes place in places that anybody knows around Washington Heights and Bronx like the J. Hood Wright Park, the Presbyterian Hospital, the Armory and a place in Bronx where Matthew went called Pelham Parkway.

This movie is very profound and it makes people value most of homeless instead or rejecting them so bad because everybody has a story. Anybody who would walk around the places I just mentioned would react differently after seeing the movie because you may expect to see the Sainth of Fort Washington around the corner and his best friend picking up bottles, newspapers or who knows if both of them selling fruits and vegetables to the people around street like they dreamed all along.

I may went a little to far with my review, but these two characters are like the ones from novels who become alive in your imagination in the outside world.",1323734400,3,1166,4.682926829268292
543851,4,6303046959,"I totally loved this movie. Having lived in NYC and worked with people in the homeless shelter system, I am familiar with the subject matter. The sets in this movie are totally authentic and one rarely watches movies made on such locations (particularly the cavernous Fort Washington shelter). There are some flaws in the story, but it is a tough story with a lot of heart. I've seen many movies with Danny Glover, but this is the best I've seen. Excellent performances from the whole cast.",1310169600,,490,4.709302325581396

Yet, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was believable, and had some mighty powerful performances. Shame it wasn't released in theatres, or on dvd.",1293408000,,335,5.109090909090909
543854,5,6303046959,"I have seen this movie 20 times on an old fuzzy VHS tape and this is one of the only movies I have ever seen that can make me cry. Being that at one time of my life I was homeless on the streets of Washington DC I know how bad it can be. I can only imaging how it is in NYC.

This movie has GREAT acting from Glover and Dillon. Proves that Dillon is more then just a ""Pretty"" face. To see his great acting in the movie Crash I smile to myself thinking ""If you think Crash was good then you have to see The Saint""

Not many movies these days can make you appreciate acting without the special effects and yet still have a compelling story line.

The only one downfall is that they never put it on DVD. I wish that it was on DVD so I could share this gem with all my friends.",1235779200,3,773,3.81875
543855,5,6303046959,"They could say it is one more film on the homeless in New York. Right. It is. And yet it has a depth that most films on the subject don't have because it shows too well that homelessness is in the minds of the people concerned. They are, somewhere deep in themselves, convinced that they are responsible for their fate, either by being sick, or lazy, or a-social, or whatever. And that's the worse part of it all, as long as they are convinced the fault is inside them or their mind they will never get out, never recover, never escape that fate. The real question then is to know how and why they got convinced of their ""shortcoming"". The second question is about what we do to reintegrate them in society or to keep them apart from society, invisible. There we get into the system of shelters that are controlled by some network of exploiters, some wardens, some residents, and they exploit their weaker fellows, fellow inmates maybe, and it is incredible the amount of money they can make by just preying on these poor abandoned people who have no faith in themselves, and no faith in a society that has more or less abandoned them. And imagine what it can be in New York when you need an address to get medicare and welfare. But do not imagine it could be better in some other countries. Any human society produces in a way or another a certain percentage of people who cannot integrate the flock or herd and have to remain on the side, marginal forever. It is sad but alas true enough and that can happen to anyone, in anyone's life: a sad episode of any type, a disease or a traumatic shock can burn a couple of fuses and there you are lost in the limbos between here and there, earth and the other side of reality. The film is showing how these people have to find some kind of motivation in themselves to take the upper road that leads out of the bogs. But gosh, how difficult it is to find that compass that will lead you to the sunshine that does not shine only for those who have a two-storied house and a station wagon. But is there an upper road of any kind, is there a road leading to the sunshine when you are lost in perpetual darkness?

543856,5,6303046959,"I won't deny that this is a difficult film to watch especially if, like me, you have lived in New York City for any length of time (I was born here). It's the story of a homeless man named Jerry (Danny Glover) who takes under his wing a schizophrenic but basically kind, gentle and loving young man named Matthew (Matt Dillon). Jerry helps Matthew adjust to homelessness amidst a bureaucratic system that sabotages the success of anyone trying to escape it. It isn't fully clear why Matthew's mother has abandoned him - though with Matthew's history of mental illness, you get a good idea (horribly cruel as it seems). Jerry not only calls Matthew his son but also names him Saint Matthew, the Saint of Fort Washington (because of his healing touch to those in pain). I think this is an important film for everyone to see at least once (even with the few holes in the story - like why Matthew's mother's neighbor doesn't call to ask if Matthew could stay in his mother's apartment while she is away or why Matthew and Jerry don't go back to their friends' place to stay after the friends leave - maybe those answers were left on the cutting room floor).

We live in a society that's absorbed with money, looks, extreme plastic surgery and so many other things that don't matter, that many people don't ever see the profound suffering around them each day. Not to mention all of the nameless, faceless people whose bodies are interred in the Potter's Field on Hart Island (near the Bronx). Interestingly, I learned after some research, that the term Potter's Field comes from the Gospel of Saint Matthew (27:3-8). After Judas had betrayed Jesus and hanged himself, the 30 pieces of silver he received could not be placed back into the treasury because it was blood money. Instead the first Potter's field was purchased with the silver. I believe the actual meaning of Potter's Field is ""Field of Blood."" Pretty powerful, no? Just remember, there are many Matthews out there slipping through the cracks all the time. Having volunteered with the homeless in New York, I can tell you firsthand how awful it is just listening to the stories of mostly good, decent people who, for any number of reasons, fell victim to a system that often fails the very people it is meant to help, including the mentally ill. Imagine having to live in these circumstances - often unspeakably violent and terrifying on a daily basis. When you consider that after a day of work (however difficult it may be), you can go home to your own quiet place (however small it may be), buy yourself a meal on the way (even a sandwich for $4.00), and do something as simple as spending $10.00 on a movie or a book, you are richer than you think. I watch this movie on those days when I am especially ungrateful for all that I have - a good reality check indeed.

Matt Dillon's finest performance.

Why isn't this on DVD?",1142985600,13,2885,4.598058252427184
543857,5,6303046959,"This little known gem is a gourgeous film in many ways. First of all it's a rewarding buddy movie: the young schizofrenic Matthew (Matt Dillon) becomes homeless and it's obvious that he doesn't know the streets and their uncanny laws. But then he meets the elderly black Jerry (Danny Glover), a big wounded Vietnam veteran who takes Matthew under his fatherly wings. Together they wander the streets and try to get by by washing car windows at intersections. Being together (or rather: not alone) makes everything look a little brighter for Matthew, and in a way, for both of them.

The streets can be tough, but the real threat comes from the shelters: huge purgatory-like halls filledwith a thousand plus beds to accomodate as much homeless people during the cold nights. But it's more like a common prison, with the dangers of being harrased, robbed or killed by thugs lurking at every corner.
Main Bad Guy is Little Leroy (a real creepy Ving Rhames), who takes a special interest in Matthew, vowing that one day the young chap will get it for good.

But big Jerry manages to keep Matthew and himself out of danger for a long time. Meanwhile he and the youngster dream about putting a shop together and earn some real money and get a little apartment for the two. These fantasies keep them alive and kicking. They meet other friends, the Latino Rasario and his pregnant girlfriend and the aging Spits who complains about artritis in his hands. Matthew touches these sick hands and mysteriously the pain vanishes, making him the Saint of the movie title all of a sudden.
The question remains whether Matthew with his healing powers and Jerry with his street experience can survive long enough to get out the danger zone for good; there are hints that they truly can, and yet there are forbodings that terrible things will happen indeed.

The entire movie feels honest in every sense, the way the life of homeless people is displayed: they are realy hardworking people, trying to survive. They are people with lives and loves and plans for the future. They are people we can realy care for.
All is thanks to a wonderful cast with every actor in the right place, giving a top notch performance. Director Tim Hunter, who made the raw-edged but touching adolescent drama ""River's edge"", never goes for the obvious or the cheap, but instead gives us a warm hearted, powerful drama, with a stunning eye for details, a comic note at the right time, and with an ending that will leave no viewer unmoved.

This isn't just cinema at it's best, but also a testament of truth: these things really happen to real people, and they're sometimes closer to us then we might expect.",1141862400,6,2666,4.714592274678112
543858,4,6303046959,"Very heartfelt and basically sad movie about homeless men in New York with Danny Glover and Matt Dillon.  I had not seen Dillon in some time and I am once again impressed by his work.  He is very, very good here.  As several critics have written, and I agree, the movie is best on a straightforward level, without trying to put goodness, or threats, or couples in love, into its plot.  The long shots of all the cots in Fort Washington, and the banks of lights going out, were chilling.  But Glover's character was too good, even with one bout of perverseness thrown in.  I thought more should have been done with Dillon's photography, perhaps.  It's always so easy to have a character die in the end; it wraps things up.  It's much harder to write a continuing life.  I felt the same about ""Backdraft"".  It's like the chicken way out.  And how do you know which homeless person is truly deserving and which is not?  Certainly Carl wasn't.  He put himself there - nobody else.  But what a waste of human beings.",1141776000,,1011,4.453551912568306
7835814,4,6303046959,"37This was a film that touched my heart. Here we have a veteran homeless man showing a nave kid the ropes as he descends into the abyss of homelessness and disconnection from society due to his schizophrenia, an illness that can destroy one's life. Matthew (Played Wonderfully By Dillon) is a young man with a kind heart who is forced onto the streets when the building he lives in is torn down, throwing his life out of balance. Unable to go to his Mother for help, he is forced to fend for himself in a cold and hard world. At Fort Washington shelter, Matthew befriends Jerry, a fellow homeless Vietnam Veteran. There they encounter terrors they would never imagine as a bully named Little Leroy terrorizes and intimidates all and everyone in the shelter (With The Assistance Of Some Of The Guards). Leroy eventually murders and robs Matthew of his money.

I was saddened at what the characters went through. I just finished seeing a movie (Suspect) that dealt with homelessness in a tertiary way. This film went into more details of the day to day lives of two men affected by the plight of homelessness. From people who ignored them to those who called city services to tow their homes away to those who assaulted them and harmed them in more ways we could imagine. I never realized how giving a few bucks to a homeless man could be the difference in eating and/or going hungry.

I don't think police force the homeless to go to shelters. To me that sounds illegal. And even if they were in the shelters I can't imagine they would be forced to stay within the shelters. They are shelters, not prisons! Yet that's what led to Matthew's murder. I was saddened because he was buried in a common plot in Staten Island and his Mother and high-school friends would never know what happened to him. That's so sad.

I recommend this movie. I can't believe it's only been reviewed on Amazon 36 times. I'm the 37th person to review it. Kudos to Danny Glover and Matthew Dillon. They had great chemistry together and played their roles remarkably. If you like this film I think you might also like 3 AM. Nevertheless, I wish they would make more films like this showing the lives of the homeless.
