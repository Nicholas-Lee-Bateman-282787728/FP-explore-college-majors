7823517,3,6302263239,"ANGELS DIE HARD is classic summertime drive-in movie fare, released as a ""pick up"" by Roger Corman's recently incorporated NEW WORLD PICTURES. This was New World's first issue-- one seen in select markets only. For modern audiences, the best known cast member is Dan 'Grizzly Adams' Haggerty.

Like most biker pics of that era, ""Angels"" includes brawls, baccanalias and for contrast, a funeral. What distinguishes this episodic story is that the usually ""villainous"" gang members are here the heroes who rescue some trapped miners.

As of 9/09, ""Angels Die Hard"" was not available on DVD.

Also check out ""The Peace Killers"" At this point in the 70's the Hells Angels were infamous. Angels Die Hard tries to ride on their bad rep! William Smith of ""rich man poor man"" TV fame stars as the lead biker. Here as in ""Easy Rider"" and ""The Wild Ones"" hell raising bikers clash with local towns folk. You'll have some authentic looking bikers but even better looking Harley's  and some pretty decent stunts. Check for a cameo from Dan Haggerty. -sideshowvideo",1217203200,,632,4.736363636363636
