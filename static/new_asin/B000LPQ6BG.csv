Just when he thought that the struggle for freedom was over, the neighboring countries come to take advantage of the tired army. With the support of Eruru and his friends, Hakuoro may be able to protect his domain. Even if he can, will he be able to come to terms with his past when it rears it's ugly head?

This is another great volume. The characters are all backgrounded even more here. The war to liberate the kingdom also ends. This series keeps getting better and better. With new characters, even more drama, and intense action, this DVD takes the series to even greater heights than than I expected from the first DVD. I highly recommend Utawarerumono to any anime fan.",1354492800,,781,4.700729927007299

8163078,5,B000LPQ6BG,"Synopsis: Along with his newfound allies, Hakuoro clashes with evil tyrants who challenge his very existence.  As these despots attempt to destroy all that he holds dear, the masked one realizes this anarchy cannot - must not - continue.  He digs deep into his steely resolve to return his people to peace.  Nevertheless, as one army of fiends is dispatched, another is spawned from the depths in its place.  Still one question looms ominous, but unspoken.  What is the meaning behind the mask?  Perhaps, it endows Hakuoro with the clarity of truth to do what is right.  Maybe it allows him to keep his distance from a world where he is essentially an interloper.  Or could it possibly hold the secret to his past that only his savior, Tuskuru, knew of before her demise?  Find out for yourself in these five epic tales of Utawarerumono.",1169683200,2,837,4.7172413793103445
