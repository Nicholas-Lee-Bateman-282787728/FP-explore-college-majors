8280709,2,B001AZUU5Y,"I have been a life-long fan of Conway Twitty. I have been waiting for some feedback on this DVD for some time, with no luck. So I decided to buy it myself.

This has got to be the WORST ""Documentary"" I've ever seen. For the first 25 minutes they talk more about Elvis and hardly even mention Conway. It's only a 30 minute show, with 25 minutes covering Elvis' career. It's got people who don't even know him. Some of the facts are wrong too. Just a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!! DO NOT WAST YOUR MONEY!!!",1302307200,12,497,4.287234042553192
