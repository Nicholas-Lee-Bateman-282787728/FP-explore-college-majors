8375450,1,B002NU6IGU,I expected a parnormal investigation with this video.  But all you get is a group of investigators in a dark room describing what they are feeling and think they are seeing.  Nothing they see is visible to the camera. You get almost zero information about the location or who they think they are contacting.,1407196800,,307,4.666666666666667
8375451,1,B002NU6IGU,"I don't know who reviews these things as the review I read indicated this was 5 star. I am going to give you an honest review.  This is the worst paranormal DVD I  have ever purchased - There is nothing paranormal about it.  You have a medium showing people what he claims to be  paranormal activity  but are just tricks of magic.  There is no evidence of paranormal activity in this DVD.  The DVD is full of credits, smoke swirls and flames.  There are a few segments which are supposed to show activity but no follow through and no evidence.  Please do not waste your money  on this.  Never did see much of the secret bunker.  There is even a segment on the decline of the world which was absolutely true but what did it have to do with Scotland's Secret Bunker and paranormal activity.  Why do all these claims of paranormal activity base there decision of activity  with orbs. All you see are just bugs or peices of dust, maybe a few possible orbs but this is just energy and not an idicator of paranormal activity. Will someone please produce something that makes sense.",1270684800,,1075,4.446153846153846
8375452,5,B002NU6IGU,"A remarkable evening of phenomena experienced by the group. From hands appearing skeletal, and reshaped, to one sitter seeing the materialization of one of McNamara's Spirit Guides, to ...even an intrusion by an elemental !
I had never heard of Scotland's survival bunkers before, and wouldn't have imagined that one as such, would be haunted. But physical medium Patrick McNamara sees the apparitions of several spirits, inviting them quite naturally to join in, as if they were additional sitters happening by.
It's a fascinating learning experience to see how McNamara explains in detail the workings of photoplasm (as it develops), examines the energy emissions of different chakras, and demonstrates his approach (with spirit guidance) to opening a vortex in the floor. When the vortex is opened, one can clearly observe an orb flying out from it.
I especially liked the trumpet levitating from off his hand. Well filmed !
I highly recommend this movie to individuals who have accepted and are interested in advanced spirit phenomena.
Mr. McNamara is generous in sharing the knowledge he's gained, and is freely teaching us all what has taken him great time, and physical and mental devotion to learn.",1253404800,,1206,5.18974358974359
