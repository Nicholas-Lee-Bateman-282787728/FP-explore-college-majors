5058752,5,B007701QD6,The yoga is a great workout. Lots of strength building and stretching. Good use of your time. Program uses lots of muscle groups.,1370995200,,129,4.6521739130434785

5058754,5,B007701QD6,I really enjoy this DVD! I like that all three types of workouts are available on one DVD. I really enjoy the yoga,1358812800,,114,4.0
5058755,3,B007701QD6,"I like 1 of the 3 workouts on this DVD.  The other 2 have girls that are annoying to listen to and the workouts don't work well for me.  Don't rush to buy, but if you have some extra money, it's worth it to mix up your workouts some.",1358553600,,233,3.7346938775510203
5058756,3,B007701QD6,"There are 3 ~20min. segments on this dvd.  I like the idea of 20-30 minute routines because I can almost always fit them into my day, (the 45-1 hour dvd's I'm less likely to do because of the time committment).  I primarily purchased this dvd for the strenghth work out, using hand weights.  The routine is good, but I feel it moves too quickly from one exercise to the next.  I realise they are trying to give a good workout in a short time, however I feel adding just a couple more minutes & doing the same amout of exercise would've worked better, for me at least.  The core routine is also good, however I still feel it moves too fast & didn't offer much instruction.  I enjoyed the yoga routine the most, although it also moves fairly quickly, although I use yoga dvd's daily, so I'm more familiar with the routines.  I will continue to use this dvd, at least for the strength workout, but  will work at my own pace.  The exercise routine is good, works out many areas of the body.",1355875200,9,986,4.315217391304348
5058757,5,B007701QD6,The video is an excellent workout.  I do yoga and pilates workouts and this was a great add on. I was actually sore from the weight workout which is very unusual for me especially in the glutes. I was very happy with the selection.,1355875200,,231,4.25
5058758,5,B007701QD6,This video has short (about 20 min.) workouts that make you feel like you accomplished something by doing one. Perfect for those days you don't have a lot of time,1355011200,,162,4.433333333333334
5058759,5,B007701QD6,It is a well rounded exercise program.  I love that I can do any one of the three workouts in as little as 20 minutes.,1354492800,,118,3.72
5058760,4,B007701QD6,"I had been doing the same workouts for months & I noticed I didn't feel the effects anymore. This dvd appealed to me because the workouts are only 20 minutes (25 with stretching) & didn't involve cardio. The workouts do get your heart pumping & they are difficult enough to feel the effects, but if you can't keep up,it's easy to set your own pace. I like not needing much equipment. The instructors are clear, they keep it moving without excess talk, & before you know it, it's done & you feel good for having gotten your workout in even on a busy day! This dvd combined with my older workouts will give me enough variety for a few years. Highly recommended!",1350777600,4,659,4.409836065573771
