8130336,5,B000GBEWLQ,"The Brotherhood is back - and now they've changed the rules of engagement. The Complex is where America's best and brightest come to be taught and trained by the US Navy. But the Complex isn't your average top of the line military academy. It harbors an ancient secret society - the Black Skulls - whose past members have gone on to the highest government positions. And now the Skulls want Lee (Sebastian Gacki) as their newest member. At first Lee is intrigued, but the more he uncovers the dark origins of this secret society, the more he realizes that their purpose is more sinister than fraternal. Lee will have to use his knowledge of military strategy to defeat this threat.",1349222400,,681,4.683333333333334

8130338,4,B000GBEWLQ,"Though none of the series will be a blockbuster, this was the best of the Brotherhood series.  The acting, sound, lighting were all greatly improved. Not to mention the light homo-eroticism was not over the top unbelievable. The story was a little ""huh?"" especially toward the end but all in all I watched it 3 times so far.  I can't wait for his version of ""The House of Usher"" to come out as I saw it on Here! and it was well done and the sexiest he's done so far in his horror series.",1220313600,,487,4.170212765957447
8130339,1,B000GBEWLQ,"Interchangeable, white, 20-somethings, male twinks in tightly-whites in a not-scary, supernatural horror film.  IT MUST BE A DeCOTEAU MOVIE!

I own 4 of his movies, have watched more, and this is the LAST I will ever watch!  The continuing stupidity of the scripts require to fit The DeCoteau Cliche has become deadly, dull, dull, dull. What a *good* production could be done with original, creative writing!

BUT I just can on longer tolerant the pure HYPOCRICY!  It's just eye-candy for gay men, but *NEVER* rear or frontal nudity (heck, even DANTE'S COVER and THE LAIR does nudity) -- and all those male characters, despite doing all the blatantly homo-erotic stuff -- ALWAYS have to be shown as REALLY being straight.

Enough is enough!  COME OUT, DeCOTEAU MOVIES!",1210118400,8,768,5.0
8130340,1,B000GBEWLQ,"David DeCoteau (the director)has hit the bottom with ""The Brotherhood IV"".

His original film(""The Brotherhood"")was a well acted mystery about a fraternity, like The Skull & Bones at Yale University, but with some occult goings on. I highly recommend it.

His second ""Brotherhood II"" was average but interesting. Worth purchasing.

His third ""Brotherhood III"" was a piece of crap,(period). Don't even go there.

I said I was never going to purchase another DeCoteru film ever after viewing BH III, but for some reason I purchased this one, hoping it was like the first one, it wasn't.

Anyone reading this: Don't you purchase this film (The Brotherhood IV).  It was so bad I can't remember what it was about.  All I remember was a lots of sound effects of thunder and lightning.  Does anyone want my copy, I will give it to you for free and pay the postage.

I am not happy giving this a bad review, but someone had to do it,  maybe it will wake David DeCoteau up, or his producers. Dont't make anymore crap like this.  Oh!, by the way, I own six DeCoteau films, so I use to like him.",1195862400,5,1084,4.536082474226804
8130341,3,B000GBEWLQ,"The guys are hot, the music is pretty good. Even the acting is pretty OK.

The story line is still a bit weak, but it is so much better than the previous 3 Brotherhood. The locker room solo is sexy. The underground tunnel scene should go one step further, instead it gets cut. The ending is always the weakest part of all Brotherhood series.

Still I will watch it again soon.",1179014400,3,376,4.28169014084507
8130342,5,B000GBEWLQ,"Horror auteur David DeCoteau directs another classic installment of his Brotherhood franchise and this is a most welcome addition.  A DeCoteau film has a look that is instantly recognisable for the beauty of the camera work and the dreamlike editing.  He is also known for the beauty of the casts that he assembles to act out his eerie fantasies and he has really outdone himself with this group. The cast is headed by Graham Kosakoski and Sebastian Gacki.  Kosakoski is a real discovery and a truly fine actor.  He steals every scene he appears in and I hope David DeCoteau decides to break his own ""only three films with me"" rule and uses Kosakoski indefinitely. Kosakoski also appears in DeCoteau's KILLER BASH but only in a small supporting role.  It would be a shame not to use his talent in many more pictures.  The storyline returns to the original formula established in the first two films.  The third episode may have lost the way a bit but we are back in traditional Brotherhood territory with this one.  The big erotic sequence that has become a trademark of this series lives up to all expectations.  This film also features some of the best production design of any DeCoteau film to date, although I can't say that it quite lives up to the ""frat party"" playboy club type design of the original film.  Nevertheless, the budget seems to have been beefed up a little for this effort and the visual effects are more elaborate and abundant.  The only thing missing (sadly) is the ever present lightening.  C'mon David, bring out the Lightening Strikes machine again.  WE MISS IT BAD!  All fans of David DeCoteau or the Brotherhood series will be knocked out by this one.  Thanks David, you have truly done it again!",1158278400,26,1724,4.681063122923588
