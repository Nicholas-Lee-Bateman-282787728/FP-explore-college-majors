6698314,5,B00O1D3AX6,Holy Hokage! just finished watching it 2 days ago. & started all over again. Love meeting old shinobi that I have never heard of if not for Kabutos reanimation jutsu. I don't watch the japanese version due to the fact that I am used to the English voice actors. & that I want to focus on the animation & not have to read subtitles.
