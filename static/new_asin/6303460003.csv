I like this format.  Most of the video tape is of the Mahre brothers doing ski clinics with real live, nonprofessional skiers.  I get a lot out of watching real lessons being given to real skiers... just like me.  The students have helpful insights or feedback.  And the teachers have helpful feedback for the students.  And I also enjoy the easy banter and sometimes humorous give and take between the Mahre brothers and students.

Even though the tape was made in the mid 1980's... MUCH of the information is relevant today.  Much of the video is dedicated to balance (fore and aft, lateral, and vertical)... and finding that sweet spot, when it come to balancing on skis.  Balance hasn't changed much (if at all????) in the past 20 years.  They also stress exaggerating the drills or exercises.  I've found this very helpful.

I haven't found the swing turn exercises all that helpful... but I'm not skiing in the back country or down chutes.  Nor have I found the information on picking a line in a race that helpful... but it is fun to watch.  (Honestly, my sister and I enjoy watching this part of the video for the guys bods... ;))  Thus the indecision about giving it 4 stars or 5.  This part of the video... not too helpful... 4 star worthy.  But watching them ski... 5 star worthy.  Even if your only exclamation is ""OMG! Look at the muscles in his back!""  But it IS some great, inspiring skiing, too!

And hey, for the price of a used video tape plus shipping... you really can't go wrong.  Skiing isn't exactly a cheap hobby... but for a couple of bucks... you can get some great tips, drills and advice on this video.",1203206400,,1673,4.528428093645485

When I took up skiing again two years ago, I thought this video would be an easy way to pick up some skills again.  I didn't realize how much times, and skiing changed.  The video is still helpful with certain concepts, but generally I would say it easier to just buy a group lesson.",1182643200,,386,4.333333333333333
