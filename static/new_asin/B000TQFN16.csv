The DVD shows you all of the important highlights of the city and it goes in to detail.  It also has special chapters for families, history, and shopping to name a few.  The DVD-rom features are nice also, some are maps, coupons, and pictures.  The website featured with the DVD also put all of the important links on one page.  I did okay planning my trip without the DVD, but this would have saved me a lot of time.  It also makes a nice souvenir.",1218412800,3,566,4.1
8210395,5,B000TQFN16,"This product has multiple uses. I originally purchased a San Francisco DVD *before* a planned vacation to that area. It worked great to help me prepare for a well-rounded trip. Then I realized that these videos also are a great way to remember a trip so I started giving them to people that come visit me in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area as a gift to let them remember their stay here. It makes a great gift!!!

These DVDs have great information, cover useful destinations, and help you get organized for your trips!

I highly recommend this product!
