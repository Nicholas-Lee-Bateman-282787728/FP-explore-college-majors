I enjoyed the films quite a bit and they are in their original aspect ratios, so there is no empty space on your TV screen. They just don't make them like this anymore.",1390867200,,271,4.44
8453812,4,B0052DG5N6,"As a martial artist I have always loved this movie for it's two great martial artists Bruce Liang and Yasuaki Kurata. Though the plot is very thin it can be overlooked as Bruce Liang(one of the best kickers in the business) displays his abilities. He show great speed,power and he gives his all in an action scene which is important to me. The legendary Yasuaki Kurata of Heroes of the East fame with my other favorite guy Gordon Liu is well known and respected by anyone who has knowledge of the martial arts or love kung fu movies as much as I do. The first release of The Godfather Squad was released by some hip hop guys which was terrible and the ending chopped up. This print comes from the film reel and is uncut. Straight forward martial arts with no wire-work and no excuses. It is now part of my 1,550 martial arts movies. Oh did is mention they threw in a Bruce Le(not Bruce Lee)fight clip movie called Bruce's Last Battle also known as Bruce Le's Greatest Revengs.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godfather-Squad-Bruce-s-Last-Battle/dp/B0052DG5N6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godfather Squad / Bruce's Last Battle</a>If you collect get it before it disappears for good.

8453813,5,B0052DG5N6,I gave this as a gift to my movie lover brother and he loved it and it was just what he wanted. This shipped in a timely fashion and was in perfect condition.,1328572800,,158,3.8181818181818183
8453814,4,B0052DG5N6,"The Godfather Squad is awesome. Even though I don't really like the term, it could be described as ""So bad, it's good"". It stars one of the many Bruce Lee imitators, but this one is actually quite good at imitating some of his fighting styles. The acting is terrible but always entertaining and some of the mob characters are so over the top you can't help but roll your eyes (every single one wears a fedora and duster!). There is no denying the movie is action packed too, while they aren't exactly spectacular fight scenes they still can be quite good and, at times, pretty graphic (exploding dog!). There is also a nice, fast pace to the movie that keeps the action moving along and the soundtrack is excellent (Probably lifted from other movies).

Bruce's Last Battle is OK, although not nearly as good as The Godfather Squad, it still manages to be entertaining. It's basically a bunch of fight scenes and footage from older kung fu movies pieced together to make a action-packed, mess of a movie. It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever but it's still a lot of fun.

The DVD from Code Red is good for these types of films. There aren't that many special features but you can't expect too many from such obscure foreign movies. There is a option called ""42nd Street Experience"" that plays a few trailers before and in between the 2 films, I think this simple feature along with the minimal grain that was left on the films really enhances the experience.

Overall, if you like cheesy movies and if you like kung fu movies, you will love these movies (especially The Godfather Squad!)",1320710400,,1589,4.627659574468085
