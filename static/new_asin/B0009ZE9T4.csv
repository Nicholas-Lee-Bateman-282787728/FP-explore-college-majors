8070868,5,B0009ZE9T4,"How would you like to be a teenager with a cute maid under his employ? How would you react if you were a weapon who fights alien invaders and will die in about a year? This sounds like two totally different anime, but this is the premise of Mahoromatic. Mahoro is a robot who fights Earth's invaders, but has retired because her lifespan decreases when she fights too much. She decides to live as a maid of the son of her late commander.

Suguru Misato is the boy who is fortunate enough to have Mahoro working for him; he's a pretty average anime boy character. Mahoro berates him when he has naughty thoughts or naughty books in her company. She considers it her duty to help him be a diligent young man without naughty thoughts pervading him. This would be easier to do, but his teacher is really into him for some reason. She is a very busty teacher, and has many fantasies about fulfilling his every wish. This pedophilic teacher is rather unnecessary for most of the show except for comic relief. The real plot kicks in after a few episodes, where Mahoro meets a combat android like herself, and they decide to finish their battle to see who is better. Mahoro is also accompanied by her companion, Slash, a very cool looking black panther robot.

This show ranges from slice of life comedy series to an action sci-fi show rather rapidly and frequently in the series. However, one theme that is constant in the show is the fan service. You will see virtually every female character naked in some point, even the minor characters. It can be a little off putting if you were unaware of this aspect of the show. There are other girls in the show other than Mahoro and the teacher, so you may assume that this is a harem anime, but it is really obvious who Suguru has feelings for even at the beginning of the series.

The second season is included in the box set, as well as the Summer Special OVA, which could take place almost anytime in the second season after the new character of the season is introduced. The series has a kind of controversial ending because it is so different than the rest of the series, but I thought that it does resolve the series a lot better than if it wasn't made. This series is made by Gainax, who also made Neon Genesis Evangelion; don't worry, the ending isn't as weird as the ending from that show.

This series is licensed by Geneon, but is currently licensed by Sentai Filmworks, and you can get a much smaller complete collection than this set. This particular set uses a think-pack box set, that has four thin DVD cases, with two discs in each case. It also comes with a music CD too, which is a rather rare treat for anime releases.

Overall, this is a fun series that a lot of people may not know about. I would recommend it to those that are interested in comedy, sci-fi, maids, fan service, and action.",1381363200,,2848,4.437858508604206
8070869,5,B0009ZE9T4,"Mahoro is a retired combat android. She has a little over a year left in her operational life span. She decides to spend it helping people. She takes a job as a live in maid for a middle school boy named Suguru. She quickly works her way into his heart with her devotion and pure intentions. They become very close and overcome many challenges. A sexy teacher who has her eye on Suguru is always trying to split them up, an old enemy returns to settle the score with Mahoro, and Mahoro's impending fate weighs heavy on her heart. Despite these trials, their bond remains strong. Thye may be able to overcome any challenge together, but what will happen when her life span comes to an end?

This is a great anime. It is very similar to Steel Angel Kurumi. It also has a bit of a Love Hina, and Girls Bravo mood about it. I personally like it better than Kurumi, and Love Hina. The animation is pretty good, there are lots of great characters. The voice acting, and soundtrack are also very decent. My favorite part about this show is the many different genres it spans. There is action, comedy, drama, and romance. This show has a very sweet love story going on, but there is also a lot of nudity and pervy stuff thrown in there. This show has everything. I can't believe that I just found out about it by accident. It's over 10 years old. I'm very glad I discovered Maharomatic. I think any mature anime fan can find something to love here.",1353196800,,1440,4.373134328358209
8070870,5,B0009ZE9T4,"I liked it... Had a good romantic story that any teenage boy (or maybe some females) can relate to and get involved with.
At first it is pretty lighthearted and silly. but as it goes on it gets more serious and eventually will make even the most manliest of Otaku shed a bit of a man tear.

Get this... get the summer special... get the whole manga collection... this stuff is gold.",1330300800,,382,4.305555555555555
8070871,5,B0009ZE9T4,"I guess for most US residents this wouldn't be suitable for their kids, it isn't a kids story... it is very much an adult story.  And that is NOT saying it is 'too sexy' it is saying it is really the story of an adults memories...from a science fiction characters viewpoint.  Tenchi Muyo is my all time favorite, but Mahoromatic has taken its place RIGHT BESIDE Tenchi Muyo... and in a different sense.  This is a really great story in anime.  And if you follow the nuances within the basic story, you will see just what I mean. It has romance and a very dark oversoul to it that keeps one in suspense as to what the focus on the days of youth has to do with what is going on, until the very end...  There is only one other anime event that really touched me as emotionally and that was the scene with Ryoko and Tenchi in the final scene of Tenchi Universe... but the scene with Mahoro and Saguru in the final scene of Mahoromatic was a real gripping moment. All in all the mood appears light-hearted and young and adventurous all through the series... to those that glance only casually.  This was a real surprise.  Almost as romantically baroque as Wolf's Rain in android sci-fi clothing... GET THIS, you won't be sorry, if you really want great anime in your collection!",1146268800,16,1273,4.414529914529915
