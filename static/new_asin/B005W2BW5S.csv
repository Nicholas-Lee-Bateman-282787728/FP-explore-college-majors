4898564,5,B005W2BW5S,"I watch a lot of anime, but this one has stood the test of time for me, it is still my favorite even after several years.  I don't know why so few people watch this one, maybe because the original company that marketed it went under, but it is really a gem......this anime draws you in, the story is well written, the characters are awesome, it really tugs at your heart strings too, I cried, I laughed, you name it.......the fighting is a lot of fun in it too, it draws you in & keeps you riveted till the end......I think this is the best anime by CLAMP, with XXXholic following close behind, if you are a fan of one then the recurring characters you recognize are fun to see in another anime.  If you are an anime fan you should check this out, or if you are not, then why not start with this series.  Enjoy!",1279756800,32,811,4.1528662420382165
4898585,5,B005W2BW5S,This is a very good series. Loved it. 7 Angels of Earth v. the 7 Angels of Heaven. Both groups want the person that will be the major factor in there battle. One group wants to save the world and the other wants to destroy it. Series goes in depth  into most of the Angels on both sides and there backstories. Some have personal issues with each other and others have feelings. A good story and pretty good fight. Series is light where as the movie was very dark and rushed. Ending was ok but a series that is worth seeing and getting. One of the best anime series ever made!!,1439942400,3,576,4.1891891891891895

The artwork is pretty and definitely eye catching, but I guess I shouldn't have judged this anime by it's cover.  I was less than impressed with the story and it seemed repetitive.  I disliked this show so much I can't even remember what it was all about.  Not sure I even finished it!",1397692800,,352,4.287878787878788
4898608,5,B005W2BW5S,"These anime shows are awesome to watch. If you love a good anime series, then this is a show for you. This show will blow your mind.",1393545600,,132,3.925925925925926
4898609,5,B005W2BW5S,"Will you decide to save the world as it is or start a revolution to end the world? That is the premise of this show. This series is kind of like Fate Stay Night or Future Diary in the fact that there is a large battle against many interesting characters that may end the world as we know it. There are two groups of seven people that fight against each other to determine the world's fate. There is a lot more to this show than just fighting. This is probably one of the only shows that I have ever seen where all the characters backstories and motivations are revealed. This show makes you even sympathetic towards the bad guys, and that is something that can be quite difficult to accomplish. It also helps that everyone in the series looks very pretty, much like Code Geass.

This series begins with a young man named Kamui Shir, who returns to his former hometown and meets up with his childhood friends, Fma Monou and his sister, Kotori. Kamui does not want to be involved with them again out of fear that they would be hurt in the upcoming battles in the series. He is joined by a group of friends, who like Kamui, are also spiritualists, and wield incredible powers.

This series was done by Clamp, who have also worked on anime such as Rayearth and Chobits. The characters should look familiar to fans of Clamp, and if you are a fan, you definitely have seen or read this series. It is true that the manga is unfinished, but the anime certainly has an ending. And I mean an actual ending, not an anime ending where it just leaves the viewer hanging. The director is Yoshiaki Kawajiri, who directed Ninja Scroll and Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust. When I heard that he was director, I immediately purchased this series; he's that good.

There is also a movie of X as well. The movie is way too short to accompany all the characters, and is downright violent towards the characters. The final battle of the movie made me feel so bad to the loser of the battle, unlike the series, which has an ending I can totally accept. The movie was also made before the series, and looks worse than the series, ironically. Do not watch the movie; it just is completely inferior to the series. Also, the English dub for the movie is completely different than the series. The characters voices do not match up at all, and are absolutely terrible. Speaking of the English dub, it is really good in the series. Anime veterans like Wendee Lee, Steven Blum, and Crispin Freeman are in this show.

This collection is rereleased from the Pioneer license, and is now under Funimation's label. All 24 episodes are included in this collection, as well as the OVA episode, which is on the final disc. Overall, this is an exceptionally good series, and you get to feel the characters' emotions. Also, there is implied boy's love, so be careful if you are against that, but the characters are way too pretty to object against it anyways.",1381276800,2,2913,4.511363636363637
4898610,4,B005W2BW5S,I got this dvd because i'd seen the movie version when i was a child and was very interested in all the characters backgrounds but the movie didn't cover that for me.the tv series gets into most of the characters backgrounds and for that i give it 4 stars.there are certain points where it feels like its lagging on and certain dialog is not needed but i still love it.,1376956800,,369,4.285714285714286
4898611,5,B005W2BW5S,This anime series is one of CLAMP's earlier works and when it arrived I can say it was in good condition.  This one is about two forces fighting each other known as the Dragons of Earth and Heaven which will decide the fate of the world.  I can say the design of this series was way thought out.,1354060800,,295,4.068965517241379
4898612,5,B005W2BW5S,"In 1999 The Dragons of Heaven will gather in Tokyo to prevent the Dragons of Earth from destroying humanity and returning the planet to it's original state. Kamui must choose which group to join. Even though many believe that the future has already been decided, Kamui is determined to create his own future.

This anime is yet another CLAMP masterpiece. It has great animation, characters, and voice actors. The story and plot twists are done amazingly. The drama is X gets pretty intense. This is a story of love, and loss. It can be very touching at times. I can't say enough great things about this series. It's fantastic. I hope you enjoy watching it.

P.S. I almost forgot to mention that the movie is awful. It's a slapdash mess that tries to put an entire series together in an hour. Don't waste your money.",1350777600,2,815,4.613793103448276
4898613,5,B005W2BW5S,"Awesome because its just awesome, why do I have to do this its stupid I cant say anything else its awesome",1328832000,,106,4.095238095238095
4898614,5,B005W2BW5S,"This is an anime series from the accomplished & successful Yoshiaki Kawajiri, who is known for such animes as Wicked City, Ninja Scroll, Vampire Hunter-D, the Animatrix - i.e. some of the most well known & successful anime titles in the west.

 The main characters have powers with different elements, as well as being able to  leap and run from buildings tops to buildings tops. The action scenes are consistently great & epic in this way. The story also involves dreamseers, spells and other dimensions as part of the super-natural clash for the future of planet Earth.

 While basic story is pretty straightforward in it's general overall arc, it does have some interesting naunce also, as well as being a more character focused story, with a wide range of characters all with decently developed stories as part of the plot - in contrast to the Directors more well known purely action works - and has alot more depth in how things come together in keeping track of the whole story.

It is heavily melodramatic & tragic in tone at times to tell the story, but this style is balanced by other elements and there are quite a few moments especially toward the end where the story's overarcing melodrama payoff in very bittersweet & uplifting ways! The action scenes and other supernatural things are always involving in each episode along with the extra depth  provided in the story constantly rewarding as well. The Japanese voice acting is very good as often the case in animes, and the subtitles are fine.

As a fan of the Matrix, i notice quite a few similarities and ideas including visuals, so if you like that kind of anime feel to esthetic, it should be a rewarding & interesting watch overall.

X is rated 16 up & is abit more extreme than a kids cartoon. It is a Unique type of Anime in often being quite Kid type then very Adult in the same episode making X an artistically difficult Anime to easily categorise with all it's different character stories and moments - but overall, X is a well deserved if not widely known anime classic made by a Master of the form i think.",1326153600,3,2082,4.62059620596206
4898615,5,B005W2BW5S,"I love this anime series, for the simple fact that it requires your attention. It's not popcorn anime, you can't just half pay attention to it and enjoy it. There's a lot going on with over a dozen primary characters. The only exposition is sprinkled throughout, usually only given precisely when you need it, and sometimes not given at all. There's a lot to be inferred here. Like other series based on Clamp manga, it is geared more towards teen girls than boys, though due to that the story and relationships take precedence over action. Not to say that there isn't alot of action, the time they spend on the depth of the relationships serves to make sure they're not just having super-powered battles in Tokyo for the hell of it.

Set at the end of the last millennium (As I said earlier, dated) this series deals with the prophecy of the apocalypse, a battle between two groups: The Dragons of Heaven who fight to protect the human race, and the Dragons of Earth who seek to destroy humanity, in order to keep them from destroying the world itself. Much of the plot focuses on a pivotal decision by the one prophesied to be the most powerful of them all, Kamui, and the effect he has on his friends and loved ones.

Though the full television series has around 15 early episodes that aren't included on this DVD set, entitled X: An Omen, they're just a primer told by one of the characters in the series. They are not needed, but enthusiasts may want to look for an older set that includes them.",1316476800,2,1500,4.490842490842491
4898616,4,B005W2BW5S,"Wait. hold on. IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK. If you're first thought after looking at the cover was that this is a yaoi anime then you're incorrect. Fortunately, it's not. Now to what this anime is all about.

Story:
It's about the Dragons of Heaven-the seven seals and the Dragons of Earth-the seven angels. The Dragons of Heaven want to protect earth and preserve the way it is now. The Dragons of Earth want to change the world which has been abused by humans and start over again. Each side has seven characters who come from different parts of Japan and gather in Tokyo for the final battle that will decide the fate of earth. Kamui, (the main character) doesn't choose a side right from the start. (I won't tell you which side he does choose)
If you're wondering if there's history to each character you won't be disappointed. There's history for all the characters. some have more than others. As for the swords, they are called Shinken. they are divine swords that can only be wielded by Kamui.

Video and audio quality;
The quality of the animation and visuals is good and so are the special effects. There's even one part where Kamui's eyes turn visibly brighter when he attacks his enemies. As for the audio both the Japanese and English are in 5.1. Both have good voice acting. The music is good but the one downside to it is that it plays a lot throughout the entire series.

Other thoughts:
The word Kamui has two meanings (this is explained in the anime) The first meaning: A person who acts with God's power. The second meaning: he who hunts the authority of God. In other words Kamui has a choice to become either a Dragon of heaven or a Dragon of Earth.
If you're not really into the whole story line and history then just watch the movie. It's a lot more violent and is under an hour and 40 minutes. The movie and the series have a different end though.

The reason I give this series 4 stars is because it reiterates the same things quite often.",1315180800,3,1960,4.451253481894151
4898617,5,B005W2BW5S,"I loved Tokyo Babylon, like the movie X, but this anime is by far the best of the whole series. It had everything a fan needed to enjoy and cry over this anime. The stroy-line is complex but well-planned, character are beauitful and vioce actors are great. Th artwork is heavenly beautiful. I do have to warn you that no matter who you are this anime will make you cry.... it has drama like rain has water. Do highly recommend this anime^^",1311552000,2,439,4.365853658536586
4898618,2,B005W2BW5S,"The first thing that grabbed my attention was the art work of the box cover. Just looking at it made me crave to buy it. Heres my take on it, the very VERY brief fight scenes were decent nothing special, the art work was decent very typical anime art work. Overall I honestly hated this series and wish I didn't buy it. WHen I watch anime , I want great fight scenes, kick ass music, a good follow aloung plot and I didn't get any of that frim this..",1302393600,2,450,4.067415730337078
4898619,4,B005W2BW5S,"I really do like this show. However it took me a loong time to get into it. I didn't get hooked until episode 7. But when I did, I couldn't tear myself away from it. So just be patient with it.

The dub is pretty good. I personally didn't like Hokuto's voice, being a huge fan of Tokyo Babylon therefore very picky, but Kamui and Subaru's voice, and almost everyone else's were done well. Some of the dialouge is kind of goofy in the wrong spots, but it got a laugh outta me, so it's all good.

As for Tokyo Babylon fans, if you haven't finished the series or you're interested in reading it, I suggest you read that before you watch this show. X takes place 6 years after Tokyo Babylon, and it's the prelogue to X. If you don't finish Tokyo Babylon first, the ending will be spoiled for you in episode 9, Subaru's entrance.

One last thing is that this show is a tragedy. It deals with the end of the world, and over half the cast does not have good endings. But it really is a great show.",1297123200,,990,4.145833333333333
4898620,1,B005W2BW5S,"Ok, so I read the back of the box for this anime and thought the story sounded good, so I purchased it based on that.  But when I got home and began to watch it it became boring very quickly.  The characters spend about 90% of the time flatly stating what they're thinking and feeling instead of showing it through facial expressions, emotion, actions, etc.  What's worse is the dialogues weren't even interesting most of the time.  For what I thought was going to be an action anime there was VERY little action and I only finished watching it because I had purchased it and it would've been a waste not to.  This could've been a great anime if it were executed differently but as it stands it's hardly worth your time.",1291334400,12,720,4.424242424242424
4898621,1,B005W2BW5S,this is a partially fair review--- as i saw up to episode 4.. so maby it gets better....i got bored... tons of dialoge  very little action going on... if there going to be  heroes give them things to do would be helpful...oh yes... another good reason i had for me at least... the guy who is supposed to be the strongest  of the seven heroes... is a complete jerk.. he attacks just about anyone who comes near him.. the show didn't give an explanation as to why he's that way.  but each to his own.... i guess i don't like just any show. maby 2 stars for good graphics  .... finding anime in good graphics should be  something to persue.,1289779200,8,637,4.266666666666667
4898622,4,B005W2BW5S,Item arrived in excellent condition! It's also cheaper than in Best Buy and I got $4 credit! Only that the subtitle is basically the same with the English dialogue.,1285718400,,164,4.689655172413793
4898623,5,B005W2BW5S,"Story:
15 year old Kamui returns to Tokyo after being gone for 6 years. His childhood friends Fuma and Kotori are very excited at his return, but are hurt and confused by his change in character. Rather than the kind and cheerful boy that they knew, Kamui is cold and quite. But Kamui has a reason to be moody - the day of reckoning is near and the Dragons of Earth and the Dragons of Heaven will battle to decided the fate of humanity, and Kamui must pick a side to join.

This series is, in my opinion, CLAMP's greatest masterpiece. X was the first CLAMP series I was introduced to, and has remained my favorite. To explain why this series is great, I have outlined the pros and cons below.

PROS:
~Artwork - As with all CLAMP's work, the artwork and character designs are detailed and beautiful. Some of the characters look very similar to other CLAMP characters, but some are completely unique to X. Some of the imagery is very impressive, and with a wide range of characters (the Dragons alone add up to 14) and a wide range of situations leads to a wide range of different types of scenes that show CLAMP's creativity and imagination.
~Music - The music for this show is some of the best I've heard in any screen production. The main theme, Destiny, is very memorable and beautiful. I bought the soundtrack and Destiny is one of my top played songs, despite being instrumental.
~Story and Characters - X boasts a complicated story with complex characters. The cast of characters is large and many of them have their own story to contribute. The interactions between the Dragons of Earth and the Dragons of Heaven are quite realistic - even the people wishing for the destruction of humanity are only human themselves and this especially evident when they encounter someone from the opposite side.

CONS:
~This isn't a very cheerful series - it is about the end of humanity after all. I don't want to spoil anything, so won't go into detail about any tragedies that occur. I thought that tragedy was essential to the story, but it was still sad and might make you cry (I think I did).
~I like having a lot of characters, but it did get a little confusing at times!
~Even at 24 episodes, this series wasn't quite long enough to fit all of the story into it. The manga is 18 volumes long, and still hasn't ended. I think that the anime creators did a good job of picking which things were cut, but it still felt a little rushed in some places.

Obviously, the pros far outweigh the cons and you should totally watch this series! This set is pretty cheap at $30, which is about half the price I originally paid for the series, so you are getting quite a bargain!
One final note: I watched this series in Japanese and the cast all did an excellent job. I haven't see it in English, so I can't say if it is any good or not. But I really liked the Japanese dub, so I would recommend it.",1283126400,27,2885,4.407129455909944
4898624,4,B005W2BW5S,"Though this is a great series, there are enough gaps in the plot to prevent me from awarding a five star rating.  The animation quality is above average and the Japanese voice acting is very well done.  It is an addictive series as well.  This series did exceed my expectations and I feel more people who like anime should watch it.  But it is not for kids and it is not for novices into anime watching.  I recommend watching Cowboy Bebop to get you into anime, then go for the more serious and violent series.  (Last Exile, Full Metal Alchemist, and Ghost in the Shell being my favs)",1281571200,10,584,4.361111111111111
8487805,4,B005W2BW5S,"A great way to see the complete version of an excellent series. Well, almost complete. I feel it necessary to inform anyone interested in this series that there exists an 'Episode 0' that served as an introduction to this series that I can watch on an earlier version of the first half of the series I previously owned. Normally, I might no5 mention it, but it seems in hindsight like a very important episode that is for some reason missing on this new version. So in short, great to be able to finish this series, but, if you can, YouTube (maybe?) Episode 0- An Omen, and watch that first or something. Its a really great episode that sets the tone for the whole series. Good luck!",1528675200,,683,4.428571428571429
