5051740,5,B0072J7N3E,It really is a touching story. While I don't agree with some of the parents or judges- it is life and gives a true accounting of different cultures. In the beginning the shaik explains this and then we see the story unfold.,1387324800,,223,4.333333333333333
5051741,5,B0072J7N3E,"A very nice documentary that tells the story of three young kids who come from totally different backgrounds, didn't know any Arabic, but were able to memorize the whole Quran and participate in an international contest in Egypt. Very inspiring and motivating ESP for kids who are learning the Quran. Good for both Muslims and non Muslims to watch.",1355356800,2,348,4.915254237288136
5051742,5,B0072J7N3E,There's not much to say except it is well worth the cost of the film. Excellent documentary. I would suggest it to anyone who is interested in seeing a side of Islam that is not shown in the main stream media.,1344038400,,209,4.121951219512195
5051743,5,B0072J7N3E,"This is a beautiful, touching movie. The technique...using the action to drive the narration rather than a ""voice of God"" narrator, draws us into the lives of these beautiful young children. They are far from home, away from everything familiar, thrust into an international competition. It is really a remarkable piece of documentary filmmaking. The children are drawn from very different countries, yet all devoted to memorizing the Koran.  They illustrate through their daily lives the diversity of the world's one billion Muslims. Just a terrific movie.",1327881600,10,557,5.402298850574713
8508934,5,B0072J7N3E,Awesome documentary on Quran and children relationship. Loved the family insights and the ending with what some of the kids are upto. I hope there will be a follow up with these kids progress after 5 or 10 or 20 years.,1515542400,,218,4.341463414634147

8508943,5,B0072J7N3E,"Imagine!  A film that will transport you to beauty in the recitations of young children, their cultures, religions, families and dreams.  Mesmerizing.  The recitations are so calming, vocalized so beautifully,  as are the children who have memorized the Koran and sing from their heart and spirit.",1444003200,,297,5.391304347826087
