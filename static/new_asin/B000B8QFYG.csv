2408768,4,B000B8QFYG,"For starters, I haven't seen The Emperor's New Groove, so I'm pretty much judging this sequel on its own merits.  I liked a lot of things about Kronk's New Groove - maybe I would have enjoyed it less if I could judge it against the first movie, but maybe not.  The only real negative about this one is its length - the credits start rolling after a mere 67 minutes, and that qualifies as short in my book.  In a way, though, the length speaks to the whole aura of the film.  Kronk's New Groove isn't about trying to impress you with the latest supercool animation techniques or framing an epic story that will be talked about for decades to come.  I think it's just trying to entertain and, to some extent, deliver a wholesome message, and it does it in a fairly laid-back manner.

Kronk (Patrick Warburton) is now a chef (and, lest we forget, chief delivery boy) at a popular diner, his henchman days all in his past.  He's pretty happy with his job and all of his friends there in town.  Then, from out of the blue, he learns that his Papi is coming for a visit.  Kronk has always dreamed of the day when his father would tell him he's proud of him - but Papi's hopes for his son involve a wife and kids and a big house on the hill (and no cooking).  The kicker is the fact that Kronk actually had a house and a girl - sort of - for a while.  Cue the flashbacks.  First, we see Kronk get the big house on the hill after naively helping that dastardly Yzma (the still-meowlicious Eartha Kitt) with another one of her schemes.  Then we watch what happens when he meets the woman of his dreams, Ms. Birdwell (Tracey Ullman) at Camp Chippamuka.  Doing the right thing in the end, though, costs him both the house and the girl.  So what happens when Papi finally arrives?  What doesn't happen, as comic mischief ensues?  If you're wondering about Emperor Kuzco, he does manage to insert himself into the film every so often - even though this movie really isn't about him at all.

There are some funny bits in this film.  There's a good helping of your basic, physical humor that youngsters will like, but the jokes I enjoyed the most were ones that a lot of youngsters probably won't ""get.""  In the case of one joke, the writer went way, way, way out of his way to deliver a grimace-worthy play on words that most folks under twenty probably won't even notice.  Then there's the big dance scene with Kronk and his girl grooving to some vintage Earth, Wind, and Fire - it's just one pop culture reference after another.  I loved it, but kids will probably just react to all the funny dancing going on.

Kronk's New Groove isn't going to set a new bar for animated movies, but it's a good, funny film that entertained this adult and will surely entertain the youngsters it's basically aimed at.  The special features are fairly good, as well.  The behind-the-scenes featurette is child-oriented, and it's pretty funny in its own right.  Meanwhile, the two games, one of which puts you inside Kronk's mind, are decent and easy enough for a kid to understand and enjoy.  The DVD also comes with a plethora of sneak peeks at upcoming Disney movies.  Disney may not have hit a home run this time around, but Kronk's New Groove is certainly a solid double into the gap.",1134432000,11,3260,4.406354515050167
2408769,3,B000B8QFYG,"""Kronk's New Groove"" is a direct to video sequel to Disney's 2000 animated feature ""The Emperor's New Groove,"" and the basic rule of thumb that at best such sequels end up being one star less than the original holds true here.  Kronk (voiced by Patrick Warburton), was the chef who became the less than stellar right-hand-man for Yzma (Eartha Kitt) in her attempt to become the ruler of the mythical South American empire ruled by Kuzco (David Spade).  Now Kronk is in the spotlight and gets to prove that he can get into lots of trouble all by himself, as if we have any doubts on that score in the first place.

There are several entwined plot lines at work in ""Kronk's New Groove.""  The main one turns out to be Kronk's involvement as the leader of a Chipmunk troop, where he is teaching kids to win at any cost until he meets Miss Birdwell (Tracey Ullman) and learns that maybe winning is not the only thing.  Unfortunately, he fails to pass that particular lesson on to his young charges.  Meanwhile, Kronk, who is relatively happy working as the head chef at his own diner, learns that his Papi (John Mahoney) is coming for a visit.  Kronk has been waiting his whole life for his father to give him a sign of approval and when he looks at the life he is leading he knows it is not likely to happen this time either.  As for Yzma, she is still trying to cause trouble now that she is back in (mostly) human form (the tail is a nice reminder).  Everything comes together at the end as even Pacha (John Goodman) shows up for the comic resolution of everything in the requisite happy ending.

Overall, I have the strange suspicion that ""Kronk's New Groove"" might actually play better for adults than for children, even though the latter are clearly the target audience.  That is because I think the funniest things in the movie tend to be the references to other films, from ""Pulp Fiction"" to ""Lady and the Tramp,"" and kids are just not going to be able to catch everything.  Plus, the romance between Kronk and Miss Birdwell might distract kids from the point about sportsmanship that the movie wants to make.  Kuzco pops up from time to time to remind us that he still needs a major ego adjustment, but he is just distracting and has his own spin-off, ""The Emperor's New School,"" coming out next year for those who like Spade in low-gear.

The DVD bonus materials are scaled down for a direct to video DVD, with ""Kronk's Brain Game"" and ""Pyramid Scheme"" checking how well you paid attention to the movie (it took me three times to beat the latter; I feel so ashamed).  There is also a short featurette on ""How to Cook a Movie"" that provides youngsters with the basics of how a movie like this gets made.  The bottom line on this one is to simply follow the lead of your children.  If ""The Emperor's New Groove"" is one of their favorite Disney films, then they should enjoy this sequel.  But if you do not already have a copy of the original, then you can forego the sequel.",1134432000,5,2977,4.4411764705882355
2408770,2,B000B8QFYG,Just got done watching this movie and it has a few funny parts but its got nothing on the first movie... The plots thin but I can see kids would like it... Just don't think that its a Shrek 2 type of sequel its more of a Lion King 2 movie...,1134345600,2,241,3.7450980392156863
2408771,2,B000B8QFYG,"If you've seen The Emporer's New Groove then you have practically seen all this ""New"" groove has to offer.  There's hardly a new idea to be found.  Almost all of the one-liners and visual gags are taken directly from the previous film.  Rolling film stock, interruptions in the story by characters who make comments to the audience, even the ""pull the lever"" joke is repeated, and it was it was used twice in the original film!

That said, young kids will probably be taken in by the vivid colors and frenetic action.  It's mindless entertainment with no heart that manages to talk down to everyone over the age of 8.  This groove may have no hope of being anyone's favorite animated film but at elast it offers a chuckle or two.",1134086400,4,729,4.526717557251908
2408772,3,B000B8QFYG,"First of all, let me just say that Kronk's New Groove is very, very funny with a good amount of laugh out loud moments. Surely that is all that matters then, eh? Well, no. Compared to the first film, the story is pretty tepid.

All of the previous characters return. Of course there is Kronk himself, along with Kuzco, Pacha and his family, the babbling squirrel and Yzma (who has now turned mostly back into a 'human' but still features a cat's tail and feline abilities). The movie tries to incorporate all of them into the story but nothing really sticks. It all just seems like an excuse for mayhem.

As before, it is told in flashback with Kronk explaining how he ended up in such sorry circumstances. His dad is coming to visit him and he's afraid of the inevitable disapproval he'll get as all he's managed to do with his life is be a Junior Chipmunk Troup Leader and run a restaurant kitchen. His dad thinks that cooking and talking to animals isn't a 'real job' and won't give Kronk the big thumbs up until he's got his own house on a hill with loads of money.

From this thin idea comes loads of deception, scheming and hijinks. And that's basically the movie. It IS packed full of hilarious moments and wonderful Looney Tunes-inspired humor like the first, but it just lacks that overall high-quality. Still, it's loads of fun and any fan of The Emperor's New Groove must give it a rent.

The DVD is in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 soundtracks. The extras are minimal and aimed at kids.",1134086400,40,1528,4.505415162454874
2408773,3,B000B8QFYG,"I have to confess I have minimal hopes (close to none, actually) when it comes down to Disney ""Part 2"" movies. Almost every single one of them I have seen has dissapointed me. So, in the same way, I had very low hopes for ""Kronk's New Groove"", very much so, the second part of ""The Emperor's New Groove"". To beat the first one or be just as good was a tall order: David Spade stole the show on that one, making it a very happy surprise for most movie viewers.

Kronk, indeed being a secondary character in the first one, takes on center stage here. And while his story lacks some of the appeal that made the first one a hit, the directorial duo manages to pull off a pretty funny flick, starring the same cast of voices from the first movie (Spade, Patrick Warburton -Kronk-, John Goodman -Pacha, the Emperor's partner from the first movie- and Eartha Kitt -Yzma, the villain-, among others). The movie is packed with tongue-in-cheek moments that I found amusing and my son laughed to over and over again. Also, there is a nice lesson to the story that kids older than my two-year-old can also learn from.

Considering the extras were not that big of a deal (that loses the movie half a star), and I would have given it 4 stars for what it was to me and how it was able to entertain my little one, I ended up giving it 3.5 stars. It's not going to be groundbreaking, but it's worth the laughs you will get.",1133827200,24,1406,4.30188679245283
2408774,2,B000B8QFYG,"Disclaimer: I have not seen ""The Emperor's New Groove"" and have no idea what the movie may be about, except that I imagine it has something to do with an emperor who finds a new groove.  Whatever, exactly, that means.

Now, with that disclaimer out of the way let's talk about the sequel to that movie: ""Kronk's New Groove"".  Kronk, to the best of my understanding, is a secondary character from the first movie who now gets his own film with his own misadventures.  Unfortunately, the storyline here is a bit unclear.  We start out with Kronk sitting in a puddle of liquid cheese that seems to have exploded out of a building and made a huge mess out of everything.  He tells us that he used to be somebody and that all of his troubles started earlier that day.  We flash back to earlier that day, but the events in the movie seem to take place over several days so perhaps there is another flashback that I missed as well.

Kronk is a big lug of a muscle-bound man with a bigger heart and the respect of the townspeople.  Somehow he gets mixed up with an evil sorceress who is peddling some ""youth potion"" that doesn't really work but folks get kind of addicted to, but Kronk didn't want to get involved in selling the potions but he does because he thinks the sorceress can help with Kronk making his father proud.  But all this goes away pretty quickly and Kronk is living his life, working at a camp, being a cook and he meets this woman who is also at the camp and things go well, and then the don't, and then there is a big lesson learned and things may or may not be all good in the end depending on what you believe Disney will provide for an ending.  Shocking, all of it shocking.

Or, not so shocking.  Honestly, midway through the movie I wasn't sure what ""Kronk's New Groove"" was all about.  After the movie was over I wasn't sure what ""Kronk's New Groove"" was all about.  As I'm writing this review the next morning, I'm not sure what ""Kronk's New Groove"" is all about.  If I can't even say with any real certainty what the point of the movie is, I can't recommend it.  There were too many musical montages, the movie didn't seem to have a point, the jokes weren't funny, and it was all fairly dull and unoriginal.

There are a couple of bonus features on the DVD.  First off are two ""games"".  The first game makes no sense at all, but is kind of funny.  You are to help Kronk complete three tasks by selecting items that will help him in the task.  Kronk then goes through a description of how that item will help in the task and then says whether or not the idea will work.  Let's just say that the descriptions of how the items will help are by far the most creative and entertaining part of the movie.  The second game is ""Pyramid Scheme"" where you need to amass a certain number of points by answering three questions to move to the next round.  The questions are about the movie and also a little bit about the Incas.  I answered all of the questions correctly, so it wasn't too difficult.  The other bonus feature is a short documentary about how the movie was made.  Not as funny as it was intended to be.

Here's the bottom line: I am a 26 year old male and I normally like Disney's animated movies.  ""Kronk's New Groove"" did nothing for me because I believe it is really intended only for children.  Children younger than the age of 10 will likely love this movie as it has bright colors, some silly jokes, exploding cheese, a nice moral message at the end about family and friends, and it should be fun for the youngsters.  So, parents should feel safe buying this DVD for their children.  Personally, I think there are far better options out there for children's movies, but this is a very safe, harmless movie for kids.  This movie will fit nicely into the children's market for which the movie is intended.  Unfortunately, this is not one which adults will enjoy as much as the kids.  It doesn't really work on that second level.  And that's fine too.

Adult Grade: D +

Children's Grade: B- (I'm just guessing here, I don't have kids yet).",1133740800,7,4068,4.351925630810093

2408810,4,B000B8QFYG,"My prejudice again direct to video sequel movies has come back to bite me.  I avoided Kronk's New Groove for several years now because I just knew it wouldn't live up to the original.  And, if I'm going to be honest, it doesn't.  But that doesn't mean it isn't plenty of fun in its own right.

Some time has gone by between The Emperor's New Groove and the opening of this film.  We reconnect with Kronk (Patrick Warburton) who is now working at the chef in the greasy spoon diner we saw in the first film.  The restaurant is doing well, but Kronk is in a panic because his dad is coming for a visit, and his dad thinks that Kronk has a big house on a hill and a wife and kids.

Through two flashbacks, we get two separate stories of how this confusion came to be.  In the first, Kronk reteams with Yzma (Eartha Kitt) to sell an anti-aging potion to the elderly.  In the second, Kronk meets the woman of his dreams, and she turns out to be a rival Junior Chipmunk leader.  But things are looking grim for Kronk to finally get his dad's approval.  Will he get it?

So let's get back to that honesty thing.  The story (or I should say stories) don't hold together well.  They are very predictable.  The moral about being true to yourself is rammed home a bit as well.  Having seen some of the other direct to video sequels Disney has done, I wasn't that surprised by these things.

However, I really didn't care because I was having so much fun watching it.  The movie is even sillier than the first one.  It's downright slapstick most of the time, in fact.  There are also some pop culture references that will fly over most kid's heads, but their parents will love them.  I watched this movie with a friend of mine (after his wife insisted it was a good film), and we were both laughing from start to finish.

They work hard to bring back all the main characters from the first movie.  Frankly, that was probably the most forced part of the movie.  I mean, would Kronk really work with Yzma again?  Most of the characters are more cameos, and they do work.  They really worked hard to shoehorn Emperor Kuzco (David Spade) in, however, and it was painfully obvious.

The animation is workable, with no noticeable flaws.  It isn't anything groundbreaking; it was exactly what I expected from a direct to video movie.

Anyone going into this movie with high expectations will be disappointed.  Anyone looking to laugh will be highly rewarded.  Kronk's New Groove is pure silly fun, and it doesn't really pretend to be anything else.",1430611200,,2529,4.432608695652174

It features Kronk struggling to find his groove in life after his separation from the ever conniving Yzma (Eartha Kitt).  He cooks and in his spare time he's a camp counselor seeking romance.  Much of the plot is `borrowed' from old sitcom routines that don't wear well in this format.  (He has daddy issues and misrepresents his life to his visiting dad).

2408853,4,B000B8QFYG,"First, I should say that I'm VERY wary of direct-to-DVD sequels.  Even more than theatrical sequels they carry the heavy burden of expectation from the original film as well as the anticipated reek of greed at yet another quick & easy cash-in on our fond memories.

Thankfully, that's not the case with ""Kronk's New Groove.""  While the film does suffer from a not-quite-fully-integrated-and-coherent plot (due mainly to the slightly confusing repeated flashback structure) and animation that's slightly second tier, I was very happily surprised to see many of the familiar elements from the first film used in ways that were appropriate for the sequel, not just a cheesy & manipulative callback to the first.

You've likely already read the other reviews and know the story.  It's pretty simple, and the only complaint I have is the rather quick wrap-up at the end.  Papi's arrival is somewhat anticlimactic after all the build-up, but the pop culture references are fun, the music hip-swivelin' and the characters stay true to their natures.

Had this film had the good fortune to be an A-list project, I think that the story progression could have been made more organic and feel a little less clumsy.  However, given how poor most direct-to-DVD sequels are, ""Kronk's New Groove"" is a very welcome addition to my video groove!",1258070400,,1328,5.031963470319635

Anticipation for obvious reasons, but dread due to Disney's love for half-baked straight to video sequels that aren't worthy of being in the same area code as the original.

Kronk's New Groove is a great movie, holding to the same light-hearted fun as the first, if not being quite at the same budget, which shows a little. But Kronk's Groove holds some of the same great characters while introducing a few more.

Kronk's New Groove becomes one of the lastes in the long string of Disney animated movie sequels, since they brought out The Rescures Down Under in 1990. And since then there has been so many sequels, that I bet a lot of people think that are not needed. How much trouble is Kronk in well, it is not like I am saying that he is in hot water. If you remember how they opened The Emperor's New Groove,. well that is about the same way that open Kronk's New Grrove, with him being carried out by a mess of cheese.

Kronk works as head (and well) only chef in the restaurant, along with head delivery boy, which might also make him the only delivery boy, but the movie does't go that far.

2408865,2,B000B8QFYG,"The Emperor's New Groove was such a startling good movie from Disney, that it became my instant new favorite Disney movie, and even slightly repaired my opinion of the company.  The voice casting was excellent, the story was strong, and the humor was awesome.  David Spade really carried the movie from a simply agreeable good time, to awesome fun.

So, you could imagine my disappointment when I got the sequel for Christmas, and sat down to eagerly watch it.  WHAT. WHERE THEY. THINKING?!

#1 The Kronk character is not funny.

#2 The Kronk character does not have enough depth or personality to it, to carry its own movie.

#3 They cut David Spade's Emperor character down to about 6 lines in the whole movie!

#4 This *isn't* a movie!  It is about 3 disjointed (and barely connected) short stories, wrapped together.  These are after school cartoons at best (and that is being generous) that just go to prove, once again, that Disney releases new content straight to DVD for a reason.

I give it 2 stars for 2 reasons: One, there were some mildly funny parts -- especially when David Spade's Emperor character got to speak his few lines, and Two, at least they sort of attempted to make a sequel.  I really almost wish they had just left it alone, and not done a sequel at all, with this as the result.  Oh well.  My opinion of Disney is now lower than where it was before I saw the original.",1140739200,4,1396,4.50996015936255
2408866,3,B000B8QFYG,"`Kronk's New Groove' is made as a sequel to `Emperor's New Groove' in 2000. The original was a surprisingly good animation with wacky humor abound thanks to the great visuals and effective voice cast from David Spade, Eartha Kitt and John Goodman.

In the sequel, unfortunately however, none of them (and the characters to play) is given enough time to impress us. The above mentioned three stars come back as their original character -- as Kuzco the Emperor, Yzma now a human with a long cat-like tail, and of course Pacha, respectively -- but it is Kronk who plays the main lead of the film.

Frankly the film's story is weak and at times confusing. You can divide this short 72 minute film into two parts, none of which is interesting enough for adults. Kids might find it otherwise - I don't know for I don't have kids yet - but if you think the episodes about Kronk selling counterfeit green potion to the good old folks of the village, and one of them, believing that he is young again, suddenly take off his clothes and speaks like Golem of `LOTR'... well, if you think this is funny and interesting, it is your film. Other episodes include stern Kronk's father coming to the restaurant where Kronk works, and Kronk's sweetheart Ms Birdwell (Tracey Ullman) and how they fall in love (with a disco dance sequence). Those episodes are told in a flashback (with a flashback within flashback), which is not only confusing but also pointless.

Kronk (Patrick Warburton) is again an amusing, and very likable character, and we meet new character Ms. Birdwell in the latter half of the film. They are both so-so, but what is really disappointing is that the film fails to fully use the character of wicked Yzma, who suddenly disappears halfway through the story. And as to the Emperor's role, he is nothing but a cameo, just a meaningless spectator who is watching the entire show outside the film's story.

`Kronk's New Groove's provides some good sight gags, and the directors are obviously trying to retain the Tex Avery-like wacky fast-paced visual touch of the first film, but it is painfully clear that they need either more budget, time, or imagination.

As you know, `Emperor's New Groove' came out a winner after going through very troubled production process, in which the filmmakers had to change the story drastically. It is that kind of drastic decision that Disney really needs to take about the sequel. 'Kronk' is not bad as a whole, but falls short of the infectious feeling of joy of 'Emperor.'",1140480000,2,2511,4.7368421052631575
2408867,2,B000B8QFYG,"Just a warning...don't buy this movie until you've watched it. It is definitely not good enough to spend $20 on. There were a few funny parts, but like many Disney sequels, it was seriously lacking in the ""Interesting"" department.",1139961600,2,230,4.923076923076923
2408868,4,B000B8QFYG,"This is a very funny little film, and that's a very good thing since that's mostly what it's trying to do.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and was either smiling or laughing all the way through.  However, I will agree it isn't quite as good as The Emporer's New Groove because it is too beholden to the style of its predecesser.

What's that mean?  It means the format of the story is quite similar including starting with our hero's lowest moment and relating how he got there in flashback.  Also, there are several re-used jokes that are taken directly from Emporer.  Some work, like the repeated devil and angel gags.  Others seemed forced, including the appearance of the Emporer himself to interrupt the film and even draw diagrams on its still frames.  They're still funny moments, but the movie would do better to stand on its own, which it does more often than not.

Also, though I am a big fan of the original, I am not particularly attached to the Emporer.  David Spade did a fine job in the first film, but I actually find his character's presence in this film forced and unnecessary.  If the Emporer was your favorite character, you'll be disappointed with the film.  Actually, I found it refreshing that they were willing to relegate the stars to the background and allow so many minor characters to step into the spotlight.  But not eveyone evidently feels the same.

Despite some brief lapses into self-referencial humor, it's chock full of gags and witty, silly dialogue.  It's fun and entertaining, and that counts for a lot in this drab, dreary world.  A definite must rent for any fan of Emporer or just looking for a good laugh.",1138838400,2,1641,4.645833333333333
2408869,4,B000B8QFYG,"I have read some of the reviews about this, and everyone has their opinions.  I have no quarrels with them.  However, my opinion would be that this movie should have been the first one.  I say that not because the plot is better.  I say this because I think Kronk steals the show in Emperor's.  His one word lines, his kitchen scene taking over the chef at the restaurant, the ability to talk to squirrels.  It's priceless.  David Spade, in my opinion, did nothing to steal the show, and in fact, he really didn't have many lines that were funny.  The show was drab until Kronk came into the scene.

Which is why I much, much prefer this movie over the first.  It focuses on the Kronk and keeps Spade at a distance.  Apparently Kronk had to have been a favorite to someone or he wouldn't have gotten a movie based around him.  Not a 5 star because Spade's still in it haha.",1137628800,2,873,4.288343558282208
2408870,3,B000B8QFYG,"My whole family loved the Emperor's New Groove and so a movie staring Kronk, one of our favorite characters, seemed like it might be decent. Granted, this is a Disney sequal and not a work of perfection, but it was very entertaining, though lacking in plot structure.
  This story now takes place right after the original film and Kronk is working as a chef and delivery boy for the diner featured in ENG. However, he's terrified as a visit from his unapproving father is on the horizon.
  We get to look back and see how Kronk is once again blinded by promises from Ezma and falls in love with another Chipmunk(?) Troup leader. However, in the later, the romance is more ridiculous than sweet and the silly little nicknames and dances quickly erase any feeling of sympathy for either character.
  BUt we laughed, right? Yeah, I guess, there were several very funny, laugh out loud moments which really makes this movie worth the rent(among those being the little ""headhunter"" gag which makes my brother an I laugh like maniacs (yeah, we're really odd)). However, overall, its lacking enough that I doubt I'll see it very many more times and will likely not purchase it.
  I guess this is one of those things where you can choose whether or not to buy or rent this movie. IT's funny and probably a good watch for anyone, but I would think twice before buying it.",1137196800,6,1362,4.599173553719008

Kronk told the evil woman that he had a proposition for her- she looks at him as if she's excited to hear that- then he says ""not that kind of proposition"".  What the hell are the writers at Disney thinking putting that in a Disney animated movie???  I rented this, and since they want to put sex in kids' movies now, I won't be buying it.

2408873,3,B000B8QFYG,"I bought this movie against my better judgement, given Disney's track record with direct to DVD releases, and this movie just re-inforced my opinion that if it isn't good enough to play in the theater, then it's not worth my time or money.  I bought the movie because I loved the original flick, and was hoping that maybe they'd done something more creative with Kronk than they usually do.

I was extremely disappointed and will probably never by another direct to DVD release from Disney again.

All of the characters from the original are included in the movie, as are all of the original gags.  The gags don't work this time because they are almost exactly the same gags we saw in the first movie, and the chemistry between the characters isn't there to make them work.  The writing and story are both mediocre and best, and are nothing like what Disney is capable of.  It's very evident to me that Disney puts the B team to work to make the direct to DVD movies, while reserving the A team for feature films, and the end product shows it.

The only reason I can see for buying this movie is if you have small children who haven't gotten tired of the story line.  For older children something along the lines of Valient or Chicken Little would be a better bet.  For adults......I'd skip this one all together.",1136073600,3,1313,4.506329113924051
2408874,2,B000B8QFYG,"I believe - and I know I'm not alone in this - the Emporer's New Groove was one of the few movies that trascended the adult/child boundary and was bearable after, say, the 12th watching.

In contrast, I feel embarrassed for this movie.  I can sum it up simply:  if you're a fan of the first because of it's witty, clever dialog, you will be thoroughly disappointed by its sequel.  This may entertain your 4 year old (as most anything animated should), but it's painful to watch as an adult.

There's a lesson to be learned here:  it's rarely a good sign when films are released DVD-only; Kronk's New Groove is no exception.",1135641600,2,623,4.469026548672566
2408875,3,B000B8QFYG,"Before anyone lapses into expending too many neurons on dissecting ""Kronk's New Groove,"" it's important to remember some of your VERY basic ""Hollywood Movie Assembly Line 101.""  First, it's a Disney sequel, which conjures up memories of ""Mighty Ducks 2"" and ""The Return of Jafar,"" neither of which were strokes of cinematic brilliance.  Second, it's a direct-to-video money-making concoction, which obviously doesn't have to appeal to quite the same audience or employ the same strategy for appeal as a movie that appears in theaters.  Third, it's a classic case of ""let's take the adorably hilarious comedy relief from the first film and, THIS time, make HIM the star,"" a tactic that, let's face it, almost never works.
  Having said that, ""Kronk's New Groove"" is sufficient enough entertainment because it doesn't HAVE to be as good as the first one.  No one should have been overly shocked that both David Spade and John Goodman had very brief, essentially mailed-in voice-overs in the sequel, and likely the only way either agreed to appear at all was under the condition that they didn't have to break a sweat (though Goodman probably sweats putting on his socks, but I digress and, admittedly, am just as large as he is).  The plot and action are scattershot and not terrificly well thought out, as the movie tosses in a little Yzma here, a little Kuzko there, some of Ms. Birdwell (in a fitfully goofy performance by Tracey Ullman, who's funny but no Ellen DeGeneres), some of Dad, some of Pacha, a few dashes of Kronk's good and bad angels (even Pacha's middle kid gets his own good and bad angels in this one, which just goes to show too many Disney execs thought the idea was a lot funnier than it really is when played out multiple times).  But on to the good points: Patrick Warburton is hysterical, the running time is easy on the daily planner, and, in maybe the most poignant statement the movie may not necessarily intend to make, the old folks and the little scamps are the funniest secondary characters in the film.  You'll be disappointed if you expect too much, but hopefully after this you won't...be disappointed OR expect too much.  It's funny enough throughout for all ages and, for those of us old enough to appreciate the gesture, it gives John Mahoney (Poppa Kronk) a job that, after years of toil and trial, he's earned: a nice, easy paycheck.  (As Kronk himself may have said, ""Easy paycheck...riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight."")",1135555200,,2451,4.853717026378897

It definately could have been a bit better.

they didn't need to add ALL the characters back from the origional.  And making sure they did kinda took away from other things they could have added to enrich the story line instead of muddleing it down a bit.

I LOVE KRONK, they made a very likeable and sweet charater here, how could you not like him!!!

OHH and I really enjoyed catching some of the nostalgic ""dances"" and scences they threw in there for some of us 30 somethings... How could you not giggle at the reference to 80's Micheal Jackson with the white glove and dance!",1135555200,,608,4.441441441441442
2408877,3,B000B8QFYG,"This is basically what you should expect from a Disney sequel: a shameless, mediocre plot which could play out to a couple episodes of a saturday morning cartoon. If you really really like Kronk from the movie, you'll like this if you're over the age of 10. Anyone under 10 will enjoy this, but it's not really more than a bit of family fun. I'd rent this. You may be dissapointed if you're expecting another ""The Emperor's New Groove"" but hey, just roll with it.",1135382400,2,463,4.458823529411765
2408878,3,B000B8QFYG,"The Emperor's New Groove was definitely one of the more original and satisfyingly funny Disney films, straying away from the typical outcast-becomes-hero storyline that has been plaguing the company's  storytelling for years. To add insult to injury, they have been releasing sequels to all their classics. So upon hearing that they were adding a second 'New Groove' movie, it was both a skeptical and an exciting anticipation. Does Kronk's New Groove live up to its predecessor? Not quite. But much like The Three Musketeers before it, it is still one of the better straight-to-home features that Disney has released, and that alone makes it worth a look.

In this sequel we follow Izma's former henchman, Kronk, and his background and hardships following the events of the first film. Most of the characters make a comeback here, and we are even introduced to a new one, Ms. Birdwell. Her persona is pretty questionable (why'd they give her an English accent?), and the romance between her and Kronk may turn people off, but luckily it's kept to a minimum. The movie retains a very similar visual flair to the first film, so those who enjoyed Emperor should have no difficulty adjusting to this one. The soundtrack has its own share of funky tunes to groove to, while all of the other original characters' voices make a short, but sweet, return.

Kronk's New Groove still lacks the quick wit humor found in its predecessor, which will disappoint those looking for the same kind of laughs. And while it borrows a lot of the same comedic slapstick cues used in the first film, they aren't as effectively funny the second time around. It tries hard to imitate Emperor, but everything comes off recycled and tired. However, the movie makes up for it in its richer well-made storyline, at least enough to keep you interested all the way through. It also goes as far to teach some moral values, even more so than the previous film. As a sequel, this is a three-star movie. But standing on its own, it does deserve four stars. Anyone who enjoyed The Emperor's New Groove should still look into it, and hope that Disney decides to produce more original content.",1135123200,,2155,4.803234501347709
2408879,4,B000B8QFYG,"I'm one of those people that usually thinks the Disney direct-to-video sequels are usually best left to rot.  (Bambi II? what the heck?)  But I'm also one of those people who think that the Emperor's New Groove is one of the most underrated movies that Disney ever made.  So I couldn't help but give Kronk's New Groove a try.  The final verdict?  Well, while most of the jokes are indeed recycled from the first film and the three stories in one movie plot feels a little forced, it's still quite good.  I'll take a good recycled joke over a brand-new dud any day.  The performances from the returning voice cast are all top notch (thank god we don't have to put up with any pale imitations this time).  The ""be true to your groove"" message is heartfelt and true to the story.  And any Disney movie that has the chutzpah to incorporate an old Earth, Wind & Fire song is just fine by me.  True, it's not as good as the first movie, but all in all, it's a darned fine flick.  (And Tracy Ullman lends a nice Katherine Hepburn-y touch as Ms. Birdwell also.)",1134950400,,1053,4.348717948717948
2408880,4,B000B8QFYG,"This movie looks and sounds great.  There are quite a few funny moments and it is nice to have the returning cast from Emperor's New Groove.  Although the storline feels more like three TV episodes tied together, overall this is a decent outing and should definitely be enjoyed by anyone who that Kronk stole the show in Emperor's New Groove.

The movie and menus are presented in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen. And from the get-go the whole DVD looks great.  The DVD main menu is animated with Kronk running around the kitchen while the redheaded waitress presents the navigational options on an order pad.  Besides an animated transition, the submenus are static although I dare say really well designed and quite beautiful.  The sound design and animation really tie together nicely and really give a sense of Kronk's urgency that is apparent in the film.  There are two easter eggs on the main menu that are definitely worth checking out.  This is such a great touch to the usual boring menus that so many other titles receive.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone with young kids.  And the parents will at least get a kick out of all the inside jokes and puns.",1134950400,,1172,4.729064039408867
2408881,4,B000B8QFYG,"My family enjoyed this watching this video.  It's very colorful and the songs can be toe-tapping.  The younger kids enjoyed it the most, as it is very fast moving.  Lots of action.  It's kind of a nice story, and it kept the attention of the kids.  The story line isn't outstanding, but the technology make it interesting. Looking at the credits we were amazed at the number of people it took to make this video.  Also, this video has an array of extras which kept everyone occupied.  We'll watch it over and over.",1134777600,3,514,4.462365591397849
