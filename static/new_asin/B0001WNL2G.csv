2033733,3,B0001WNL2G,"Colr and picture are good. The editing sucks big time. The scene in ""Fagin"" where Albert asked Ingals if he could call him Pa if edited. The scen in ""There's no place like home"", where Garvey loses his job is edited. All episodes are about 43.00 min. long.

2033734,1,B0001WNL2G,"The production of these shows is garbage. They have gotten worse in quality each Season...  Many worse than VHS tape...  Netflix has even PULLed all Season 5 discs from their service...

As Michael Landon was the producer and sometimes director and always the STAR of this show I am sure he would NEVER have let his series be sold to us in this horrible condition... I'd expect this from some reality TV show...  But not ""Little House"". This show as always about doing the right thing above all...  The current owner of this material should be ashamed for dumping such a highly loved show about MORALITY onto the market in this condition just to make a buck. We all deserve a public apology and new versions of the shows when they are properly redone...",1096934400,27,753,4.58955223880597
2033735,4,B0001WNL2G,"I've watched most of the episodes in this set and I'm not sure that all the criticism is justified. The picture quality is sharp and clear, and the audio is as good as can be expected given the age of the master tapes. It's not in stereo or anything but it is clear. As far as the edits go, yes that is a  problem in some spots. Some scenes fade as normal, and some abruptly cut in and out. In most cases you still get the entire episode, with the exception being ""There's No Place Like Home Part 1"" as mentioned previously with an entire scene missing. I don't really like that either but I guess they did it because of space on the disc. The most important episode, Part 2 is complete at least. If that had been edited it would be a crime. It's one of best of the entire series as Karl Swenson makes his last appearance on the show. It should also be noted that the Hallmark channel does not show this 2 part episode in reruns either, so DVD is the only way to watch it right now.

The extras are a good touch, but I would like to have seen more in-depth questions asked with more elaboration on each subject. The interviews are only 10 minutes each. It was still good to see Dabbs Greer and Alison Arngrim after so many years.

Overall the whole set is worth the money as this Season was one of best in the series, also look out for the episodes ""As Long As We're Together"", ""The Man Inside"", ""Blind Journey"", ""Barn Burner"" and ""The Craftsmen"".",1095552000,14,1447,4.216606498194946
2033736,1,B0001WNL2G,"There is about 6 minutes deleted from Disc 2 ""There's No Place Like Home"" (Part 1), which is crucial element in the Ingall's decision to return to Walnut Grove, where life is purer and honest.  In my opinion this is a defect.  I complained to the Imavision (the DVD producer & distributor) and they, reluctantly, were willing give a full refund.  Amazon will only give a refund if the the package is unopened, however, how is anyone able to discover that there is a deleted scene without viewing it first??
Overall the editing is getting poorer with abrupt scene cut-ins / outs, rather than professional fading shots at the commercial break slots.
With these flaws its not worth the money to buy it.",1092528000,12,699,4.666666666666667
2033737,1,B0001WNL2G,Why bother remastering so you get a decent picture? Why bother making sure the complete unedited versions are there? Why bother with any of it. Just stick it in a box and sell it. All those idiots who love the show will buy it no matter. The TV show of course is excellent. The presentation is pathetic. Yes the interviews were wonderful but do NOT make up for the rest. Shame on those responsible!,1090972800,14,398,4.391891891891892
2033738,4,B0001WNL2G,"As with the other seasons, I thoroughly enjoy having them on dvd.  The only complaint I have is that on part 1 of ""There's No Place Like Home"", they edit out about 10 minutes worth of scenes.  I always thought that box sets were uncut.  I hope that the company does not do that with other episodes.  I have only noticed this one.  Other than that, it's great.",1088812800,12,359,4.220588235294118

2033892,4,B0001WNL2G,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Fans of the series LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE continue to have a chance to add season five to their collection with this release. If somehow you still aren't familiar with the series its based on the series of young peoples novels written by Laura Ingalls Wilder and based on her familys life as settlers in early America. Starting in the seventies the books were turned into a popular TV series featuring the talents of Michael Landon as patriarch of the family Charles Ingalls. Alongside Charles were his wife Caroline (Karen Grassle), his oldest daughter Mary (Melissa Sue Anderson), Laura (Melissa Gilbert) and youngest daughter Carrie (Lindsey Greenbush). Their struggles to tame the land and to create a way of life offered mixed events and a full cast of characters, showing what life was like at the time.

When it comes to season five we something new happens to the family, they move away from their beloved Walnut Grove, the home theyve had every season to this point. With things being tough there they move with daughter Mary (who became blind in an earlier season) to Winoka where she will be teaching in a school for the blind. Also in this season they will become acquainted with a young orphan named Albert who will eventually become a part of their family as well.

The season features more moves than this first one. Eventually the family decides that they aren't happy with their lives in Winoka so they leave Mary behind at the school and return to a damaged Walnut Grove where they begin to rebuild along with their fellow citizens and cast members from the past. Later on the school for the blind is about to be closed and Mary writes her father resulting in a new school being opened right in Walnut Grove.

It seems as though the makers of this program wanted to give each cast member a chance to shine as the season progressed so various topics and storylines involve different characters as they interact with one another, everyone from Albert and Laura to nasty Nellie Olsen. Some are played for sentiment and others for laughs. The main thing though was that every episode was entertaining and family oriented, something sorely missing from TV series these days.

That makes series like these coming out on DVD a wonderful opportunity for all. If you're unhappy with the garbage on TV today when it comes to your children watching then you can take a series like this home and watch each episode as you would a weekly series already on the air. Present your children with an option other than whats out there now. I have no doubt that younger adults will laugh at these shows and ridicule them for their wholesomeness but don't let their cynical nature steer you from these.

One other major plus for this series on DVD is the fact that they are being release in season sets that include a digital copy of the series as well. So when you purchase this set you can also add it to the service of your choice such as Vudu. Then on trips or during the evening on vacation you can pull up an episode or two on your laptop or pad to watch or entertain the kids.

For those of you who grew up with this series it is a treasure to have at home once again. If you never watched the show, now is your chance to see why it was so successful, running for nine years. And if you have a family that you want to offer something that everyone can enjoy then this is a series you need to pick up.",1441065600,,3465,4.50796178343949
2033893,5,B0001WNL2G,"Strong story telling with strong moral values seems to be a dying art.  Fortunately, DVDs like this Little House series mean you and your family can enjoy and benefit whenever it's convenient from the great messages and lessons this stellar series provides.  Especially if you have children this is a fantastic moral values teaching tool, while being highly entertaining.
It's great to be able to pause, and discuss parts.  My daughter especially was having me pause more than I was.  Michael Landon (God rest his soul) was a genius of a kind.  No matter how often these are watched, either old lessons and values are reinforced or new ones are noticed and learned.

2033920,5,B0001WNL2G,"Little House is one of the classics. Set in the late 1800s, it's not something that will ever feel dated to modern-day viewers -- because ""dated"" is the name of the game with this series. I watch it with my kids at night, right before bedtime storytime, instead of watching the... shall we say ""less family friendly fare"" broadcast on prime time these days?

As for the Bluray DVD, it's of high quality. The initial run of Little House DVDs, released a decade or so ago, was of poor quality and was roundly derided -- but the reissues coming out today are of superb production value. For $15 or thereabouts, you can't make a much smarter buy for high quality family entertainment, than the Little House discs.",1434412800,,709,4.582677165354331

2033938,5,B0001WNL2G,"Lionsgate claim that all the episodes in this season 5 release have been restored from the original 35mm camera negatives.  In the episode ""The Godsister"", it is clear that they've had to use the NTSC videotape TX masters in the dream sequences featuring the characters Carrie and Alyssa.

As these sequences represent a siginificant part of the running time of this episode, I feel that Lionsgate should have been more upfront and stated on the product packaging that the 35mm film elements for the dream sequence either could not be located or constructed for this bluray release.

It is also disappointing that across all the seasons' releases, Lionsgate haven't bothered to provide a proper stereo or surround audio mix using the original sound elements.

Where there's a will there's a way, but perhaps they just didn't want to spend the money on getting it 100% right.",1432857600,,874,4.965753424657534

2033949,5,B0001WNL2G,"This is my first review since purchasing the lionsgate blu Rays.  Lionsgate has done it right.  I'm very please with my copies. Season 5 is superb but so is the other 4.  Not only is the quality good but you're also getting the full length episodes the way they were shown on nbc before syndication got a hold of them and butchered them. TV didn't advertise as much then so the episodes were a little longer then now. I can understand editing for time but not cutting some scenes that were important.  The cheaters is one of those episodes. I was only 9 when it came on and don't remember every little detailed as I have watched all these years in syndication and found out they did indeed cut a very important scene out that will explain a lot. Won't tell you what that is, you'll have to get the blu ray and find out. I'll be waiving as you drive away from #4 is another such episode. I was 9 as well in March of '78.  And do remember watching it but didn't remember what got cut for syndication. Get the blu ray and find out. Here comes the brides is another one. What I'm most pleased with having the originals is the episodes that were shown in a 2hr night as 1 complete  episode is on blu ray this way. Not as a 2 parter as syndication has it. Those episodes got butchered the most in syndication--The Lord is my Shepard, gold country, may we make them proud, and home again. Btw I was 11 when mwmtp aired and 14 when ha aired and remember watching them both the nights they were first aired and ha is nerve upsetting when your 14 well it was for me. Can't wait to get them on blu ray that way  and watch them both like a full length movie. Any one sceptic about buying the newly remastered ones needn't be they are truly worth buying all of them even if you bought the old dvds as I have done. They blow the old away. If you find any bad reviews they are referring to the old dvds not the new blu rays. No one would complain about the new.  The video quality----what can I say, it's like watching a new movie on blu ray is as good as you can hope for. The audio quality---you won't be disappointed either even if it isn't in 5.1 don't need to be. Lionsgate has made us true lhotp fans proud. All I can say is thanks lionsgate.",1429660800,11,2233,4.140877598152425

2033967,5,B0001WNL2G,"I was going to wait until next week to write this since that is when Little House Season 5 becomes available on DVD/Blu-ray. But curiosity got the better of me and I brought a single episode to watch to keep me going until next week. But I was so blown away by what I saw that I couldn't wait to write this.

It's so fun to watch Little House again. I never knew the series looked so good until the re-issues started coming out. These remastered re-releases don't look like your typical TV show. You feel that you're watching something more akin to a blockbuster movie instead. Whatever cameras Michael Landon chose to use, his choice was pure genius. The outside scenes are so gorgeous you feel like you're actually there. The clearness and sharpness is almost overwhelming. The episode in particular I watched was the ""Lake Kezia Monster"" so there's lot's of darkness. In the old DVD's releases, the darkness was so grainy you could barely tell what was going on. Now the picture's crystal  clear and I have no problem deciphering the action. As with seasons 1-4, scenes appear to be restored to original broadcast length so I can hardly wait to find out what all I've missed - what with having to put up with shortened syndicated re-runs all these years.

Now for the content. Most reading this will probably know something about season 5. As for myself, it was a definite favorite. Michael Landon definitely took the show up a few notches in terms of overall creativity. The kid characters have aged noticeably from the last season so they're handling situations with a more mature outlook. It makes me as an adult relate to them better - and it's probably the reason I don't enjoy seasons 1-4 as much. Of course, the show is as sappy as ever so you'll still need the hanky if you're prone to crying for silly reasons.

Of course, Albert makes his appearance this season. Purists don't like the introduction of Albert, but he arguably adds real depth to the show and makes a convincing foil for Charles who always wanted a son anyway. And Laura definitely needs somebody to play off her character now that Mary is out of the house and married. So I for one am glad they created the character of Albert.

And my favorite part of all is that Mrs. Oleson really gets to shine in this season. She even gets her own theme music. Her squealy crying is comical and her ramped-up meanness makes her character all the more hideously enjoyable. She's really quite a foolish woman and it's pure joy to watch her get a taste of her own medicine. Of course let's not forget plain ole Nasty Nellie Oleson who complements her mother's atrocious behavior quite nicely.

If you've already purchased seasons 1-4, you've gotta get season 5. The stories are great and the remastering puts the proverbial cherry on top. I compared what I watched to the older DVD release. I almost wanted to gag when I saw the differences. I can't believe what we've all put up with all these years. If you buy this season (either on DVD or Blu-ray), I can almost promise you you'll have so much fun, it will make you want watch the whole season in one sitting.",1428624000,10,3127,4.555160142348755
2033968,3,B0001WNL2G,This is the 4th season of Little House that I have ordered from Amazon...and the 3rd set to arrive with at least 1 of the disks coming out of the box not playing correctly. Very frustrating!,1427500800,2,190,4.305555555555555
2033969,1,B0001WNL2G,"My family purchased the first 4 four season and enjoyed them immensely.  There is the occasional lighting issues with the picture, but over all they were a joy to watch and my kids absolutely loved them.  Naturally, I went and ordered the next couple of seasons.  The 5th Season DVDs are absolutely horrendous in quality.  I certainly don't expect HD quality, but what a huge jump downward from the first 4 seasons.  Everything looks ""fuzzy"" and the sound is bad as well.  Such a disappointment in quality.  It basically looks and sounds like someone video taped the episodes with a VHS recorder back in the 80s.  I don't usually write reviews or complain, so I am just warning everyone.  The stories bring back such great memories and have a great wholesome message for the most part.  I haven't tried Season 6 yet, but if it is the same as season 5, I will not be purchasing the other 3 seasons.",1427414400,2,897,4.55

2033984,5,B0001WNL2G,"It is fantastic at how fast the studio is at getting the entire ""Little House on the Prairie"" season sets out!  Following on the heels of Lionsgate's"" release of season 4 a few months back now comes ""Little House on the Prairie-Season 5"". Like the other box sets these are the uncut and cleaned prints that are being offered. Don't get these sets confused with the cheap and cut syndicated DVD sets that came out years ago and were made by some Canadian company who didn't know their feet from their hands. This is the real deal...how a beloved show should be released to its legions of fans to joy for posterity.

 Season 5 of ""Little House on the Prairie"" began in the fall of 1978 and ended the season as the highest-rated show on NBC and coming in at #14 for the year. The stories this year were compelling: The Ingalls family along with other residents of Walnut Grove realize the city life is not for them so they return to their beloved Walnut Grove and rebuild their town; Charles is ecstatic that he now has a son (adopted) named Albert and he fits very well into the story.; The Garvey family is featured heavily and Walnut Grove wouldn't be complete without the Olson's especially Nellie.

 In this set 24 episodes are included. My favorite show this year was called ""The Cheaters"" as Nellie helps Andy Garvey with his school work by teaching him how to cheat. It's hilarious!",1423526400,9,1387,4.532

2034116,5,B0001WNL2G,"Little House on the Prairie - Season 5

The original nine books could never have provided enough material for the nine TV seasons. New stories were created that continued the original characters, as with other TV shows. The real question is: how authentically did they follow the original stories? Some fans of the original books were disappointed by these TV adaptions. New characters were introduced. Hollywood changes books to condense and simplify them to fit into the allotted time slots and reach a wider audience. These books were written in the mid 1930s from her personal experiences which no historian can match. Laura lost her life savings in the Great Depression. An adult who reads Laura's books can see things that a teenager may miss. The economic depressions of their era are referenced implicitly by the family migrations. Young Laura would have little knowledge of these problems. An older Laura censored events that were not suitable for children's books. This was NBC's highest rated series during most of its nine years. Here are the titles of the twenty-four shows.

Disc 1.
As Long as We're Together, Part I.  As Long as We're Together, Part II.
The Winoka Warriors.  The Man Inside.

I especially enjoyed the episodes with Ray Bolger.  The addition of Albert this season seems like a good move.  The DVD quality is generally good, though there are a few dark and a few fuzzy scenes.  My biggest complaint is the hard break between some scenes (probably where the show being aired would break for commercials).  The scenes seem cut off before they ended; there is no soft landing, just a quick transfer to another scene.  It gets annoying when it happens several times per show.

I have collected many 70's TV shows on DVD and none, and I mean none, are even half as bad as the quality of these DVDs.  Also, the editing of the episodes is inexcusable.  For example, during the Cheaters episode Andrew is walking home from school with Laura and Albert after receiving a poor grade on his test. The DVD shows them walking up a dirt path and then it is CUT!!!!!  I know there is some more dialog on the original episode.  The dialog that was cut was about Andrew showing anger at Albert for scoring high on the test.  This is just one example.  I'm sure there are more.  Where there's smoke there's fire.  This show deserves much better treatment but it looks like it was put together by a bunch of 10 year olds on a student project.

2034163,5,B0001WNL2G,"I wasn't alive for most of the Little House series run, being born in 1980, apparently during Season 6.  However, my sister's interest in the show would eventually expose me.  In essence, DVD sets like this one are very similar to what I grew up with, the syndication editions.  When I was in my mid-twenties and becoming absorbed in TVLand, I started playing ""catch-up"" with the reruns and enjoying ever second of it.

This season begins with the Ingalls family preparing for their third major migration, this one from Walnut Grove, Minnesota to Winoka, Dakota Territory, to accompany Mary to her new teaching job at a school for the blind.  In almost no time at all, they're joined by the Garveys (whose presence serves to provide both protection for the Ingalls and education to the poor) and the Olesons.  Upon arrival, they bring a vagrant youth into their circle, Albert.  After their common employer, Mr. Standish comes on too strong, all three families return to Walnut Grove for a second chance; Albert is taken in by the Ingalls.

Before too long, Mary becomes engaged to mary her superior, Adam Kendall, has second thoughts, is brought to her senses during a freak storm and gets married.  In due course, their school is closed, and the couple heads off to Walnut Grove with the students to start another school.  Meanwhile, Albert is accepted as a true Ingalls, and he also begins his tactical campaign of playing practical jokes on the Olesons (as in ""Harriet's Happenings"" and ""The Lake Kezia Monster"").  Mary's pregnancy and tragic miscarriage exposes Adam's father for all his prejudices.  Other members of the Ingalls and Garvey families, as well as Joe Kagen, face similar adversity from the Larabee family and come out of it mostly unharmed.

I've done searches on adjacent materials, and in the process, I found various postings that criticized Michael Landon for creating the character of Albert Ingalls.  Forget what his creation did for the latter half of the series, or what a terrific job Matthew Laborteaux did in the portrayal.  What I read looked to me as if people were furious with the liberties Michael took in bringing in a character who had nothing to do with Laura Ingalls Wilder's writings  I for one appreciate the sheer entertainment value that a character like Albert gave to the show, especially when the family returned to Walnut Grove without Mary (Melissa Sue Anderson).  The show definitely benefited from the creation of both Albert and Adam, as it had from the creations of Grace Sneider and the Sandersons.

It should be noted that there was a real Albert Ingalls who had a doctorate in astronomy.  However, it is highly doubtful that this Albert has any real connection to the family line of Laura Ingalls Wilder.",1232236800,2,2760,4.87152034261242

I've collected a number of television DVDs, and I have to say that this is by far the worst one in terms of quality.  I mean, how difficult is it to transfer it over correctly?  No one else seems to have had the trouble that Imavision has had.

Another note is that the editing is horrific.  Little House episodes always went to commercial breaks with the classic ""fade out.""  You'll note in a many of these episodes, there is an immediate cut from a scene.  Unfortunately, these episodes are NOT complete.  There are many parts missing in various episodes.  I know that these scenes are not ""lost"" or ""missing,"" because I saw them just the other day when the show was on a television network.

Understand that my complaints are due to the lack of quality that has been put into this DVD rather than with a show that I grew up with and loved to watch every week.

I can only hope that enough complaints may prompt NBC to put out the kind of DVDs that they are known for.  You would think they would have put more effort toward one of the best family shows of all time.

I encourage anyone who is unhappy with their product to e-mail imavision and let them know.  Perhaps with enough response, they might one day be prompted to giving us a truly complete season.

Note: It seems that most of the TV series that are released through NBC Home Entertainment are edited.  These include Little House, Cosby Show, and Highway to Heaven from what I've seen and possibly others.",1174953600,55,1837,4.498489425981873

2034173,3,B0001WNL2G,"Little House was and is timeless.  But the manufacturers of the DVD sets have obviously not learned their lesson from Season One.  I have all the seasons now because I'll take Little House any way I can get it....even in a botched up form...which is what these DVDs are!  The transfers are in no way restored or COMPLETE.  If one notices in every boxed set and in every episode there are scenes before supposed commercial breaks that get cut off.  This is an annoying factor and for the price we have to pay for these sets the least the manufacturers could do is to give us ""complete"" and restored decent quality.  Trust me....this is an aspect of all 9 boxed sets.  On a positive note there are some great episodes in Season Five!  Little House is timeless in its appeal and Michael Landon left us a legacy that will probably never be equaled.  A quality family show that promotes good values in light of the moral decadence of today's television.",1168732800,3,948,4.529411764705882

2034175,5,B0001WNL2G,"Okay, season one has a special place in my heart..but season five is maybe my all time favorite season. It wasn't a fan fav but I thought the acting in season five was top notch.

This is the season where the entire show picks up and moves to Winoka. Which just so happens to be where Mary begins teaching with her new love, Adam.lol

The first six episodes takes place with the entire family, as well as their friends, in Winoka.

When it is clear to Charles that his family can not stay there and be happy he must make the heartbreaking decision to go back home, leaving Mary behind and breaking up his family. He has a hard time letting his eldest child go until he realizes she is now an adult.

The family is introduced to Albert. I personally never cared for this addition. Albert did nothing special for this show IMO. Charles decides that he can not leave Albert behind so he takes him home with the family.

The town of Walnut Grove slowing move back home and begin to rebuild the town they love.

Laura becomes jealous when her Pa  starts to spend more and more time with Albert. With good reason. WHY is this kid there anyways?

They could have spent more time or Mary and Carrie..

Adam asks Mary to marry him and she begings to have second thoughts, thinking about their children having two blind parents.

She does in fact marry Adam, knowing that whatever comes their way they can make work.

Soon Mary and Adam's school closes and they must pack up and move their blind school to..yes..Walnut Grove!

Soon after arriving to the new school Mary finds out she is pregnant, only to lose her first baby by miscarriage. Just another grief they gave to Mary's character.

Mary also thinks she might regain her sight, only to find out she will never see again.

The Lake Kezia Monster is the comic relief of the season!

All in all it was a great season and a must have for every Little House fan.:)",1157500800,2,1908,4.396011396011396
2034176,5,B0001WNL2G,"Two years ago my cousin bought my daughter the first season of Little House on DVD. Little did I know she would create a monster! Since then we have purchased (for various holidays and birthdays) all the seasons up to 6. This was a first-rate televison show, and one I feel confident allowing my now nine-year-old daughter to watch. The stories are great, and there are clear family values. I even watch them with her and remember when I was her age watching them in their respective seasons. You can't go wrong with Michael Landon and Melissa Gilbert!",1155340800,2,552,4.642857142857143
2034177,5,B0001WNL2G,"I loved these episodes with the introduction of Albert as he becomes apart of the already loved Ingalls family, and how he struggles to be accepted by Laura as part of the Ingalls family.  It is stories of friendship that unites the clan together as being a whole body of love in the Ingalls home.  It is about moving on to fullfill your dreams as Mary did with uniting with Adam as they start their life together.  It is the stories of acceptence that unites the whole family together to do what is right.",1141689600,6,506,4.361702127659575

Orphan, thief, liar, morphine addict and murderer [well, he DID set the fire that killed Alice Garvey AND the Ingall's grandson!]""Albert"", arrives in Walnut Grove, and the show rapidly sinks to the bottom of the dumpster.

WHY Michael Landon decided to yet AGAIN deviate from the original story and bring in Albert, is a mystery he [Landon] took to his grave. The addition of Albert added nothing to this once great series.

I stopped buying the series at season 4. You should too.",1135555200,7,523,4.853932584269663
2034190,3,B0001WNL2G,"I was excited to buy the DVD box sets especially since the box covers brag at what lengths had gone into making the episodes at such highest quality. Truthfully, you will be getting better quality recording them off TV.

The TV episodes are probably an approximate 42 to 43 minutes to where the DVD episodes are an approximate 45 minutes.  However, there are still some scenes cut out in the DVD episodes.

Some cuts I found are:

In the episode ""Fagin"", an important scene where Charles tells Albert that since he is having a hard time with kids at school making fun of him for not having a father, why not start calling him ""Pa"".  Instead, they cut to the scene where Laura overhears Albert call Charles ""Pa"" and she mentions it to the boy, who tells her that Charles told him to call him that.  The scene between Charles telling Albert to do so is in the TV episodes but not on the DVD.  How on earth could the DVD company consider that a scene to throw away out of all the other scenes in the episode?

Also, a few episodes back, when the Ingalls leave their Little House to move to Winoka, the wagon takes off from their house then quickly cuts to black (doesn't even fade to black, just cuts instead) and then cuts to the Ingalls wagon train driving in the city of Winoka, completely cutting out the wagon train traveling on the trail to get there.

In the city, when Albert yells to the town that the Winoka school is burning down, then starts going around stealing everything he can get his hands on and tells Mrs Olesen that he is working for the church and that gambling is a sin then takes off running, in the original episode it freeze frames on Albert while he is running in the streets saying, ""To Be Continued"". Instead the DVD, fades out of Albert's running scene before the freeze frame arrives.

In the episode where Mrs. Olesen overhears Caroline talking on the phone to Charles about bringing James and Cassandra to live with them, the DVD cuts out Mrs Olesen's comments about how are they all going to fit in that little bitty house of theirs.  Instead the scene also cuts directly to black cutting out the scene.

There are several more cuts throughout the episodes but what is worse is the quality of the episodes.  Some are heavily pixeled like the quality was extremely compressed.  I have never seen a TV series quality this badly compressed before, ever.  Some episodes are to the point of being very blurry.

Also, audio is not consistent.  One episode is of loud volume with the next episode being extremely low.

So if you want complete uncut episodes you will have to rely on both the DVD and the TV versions.",1131580800,3,2640,4.464583333333334

2034193,3,B0001WNL2G,"DVD Box sets are for complete episodes not edited ones. If we want edited episodes, we can get a DVD burner and record the Hallmark Channel. The several minutes missing from the second disk, The Hallmark Channel just showed the 2 parter where they leave the city ro return to Walnut Grove and it had all the missing footage that is gone from the DVD. It was shown 8/13th 2005. I guess I will have to tape it burn a new DVD myself inserting the missing footage. No wonder the sets are so cheap compared with others. The cuts are terrible. The DVD's freeze and lock up some DVD players also. Three stars for poor DVD set. The show gets 5 stars of course.
