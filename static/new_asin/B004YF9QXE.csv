8448245,5,B004YF9QXE,"All three of these videos are great and each contains combat footage I had not seen before. I recommend this set. One tiny flaw from an art editor at History Channel's producers who did not know one person from another: These tapes are about Gen Schwartzkopf, Gen Eisenhower and Adm Nimitz, while the photos on the front of the three-tape collection are of Gen Eisenhower, Gen Patton and Gen Schwartzkopf. Each of the tapes is in a separate sleeve box, and on the side of the one about Adm Nimitz is a photo of Gen Eisenhower, the side of the one about Gen Eisenhower has a photo of Gen Patton, and the one about Gen Schwartzkopf has a proper photo of Gen Schwartzkopf. This in no way detracts from the quality of the films.",1456531200,,724,4.41044776119403
