7879797,5,6304963947,I became a fan of the Boston Red Sox when I watched this in 1975. Watching it again with my son brought me back to the time I watched it with my Dad. Great find for me.,1297123200,,168,3.5675675675675675
7879798,5,6304963947,"This '75 Red Sox team was a great team that was peaking at the end of the year. They swept the A's in the playoffs and played brilliantly in the World Series. It's just too bad for Boston they were up against one of the great baseball teams of all-time (if not the best ever)...the Big Red Machine from Cincinnati. Loaded with talent, the Reds had the most balanced attack in history. They hit for power- led by Bench, Perez, and Foster. They hit for average- led by Rose, Griffey, and Morgan. They had unstoppable speed- led by Morgan, Griffey, Concepcion and Geronimo. And they had the best defense- gold glovers Geronimo, Morgan, Concepcion and Bench.

The video highlights a series that wasn't just dramatic, but played so well. Few errors and outstanding defense. Great hitting and great clutch pitching. The '75 series is so much more than the Fisk home run. It was really an exhibition of star players performing at their very best.",1134086400,2,939,4.6909090909090905
7879799,5,6304963947,"For many people, the defining moment of the 1975 World Series was Carlton Fisk's dramatic, series-tying, sudden-death home run off the foul pole at Fenway Park in Game 6.

Was Fisk's homer a great moment in baseball history?  You're dang straight it was.  But for me (a Reds' fan), the defining moments of the '75 Series came in Game 7, when the Cincinnati Reds pulled out a come-from-behind 4-3 victory over the Sox to win their first World Series title in 35 years.

Those defining moments being -- Joe Morgan's Texas-League single that fell in front of Fred Lynn, scoring the winning run for Cincinnati. .... And the image of Reds' outfielder Cesar Geronimo squeezing Carl Yastrzemski's fly ball in center field for the final out of the Series.

The Reds had been denied World Series crowns twice previously in the 1970s (losing to Baltimore in 1970 and again to Oakland in '72). So the Big Red Machine was no doubt very hungry for this '75 title.

Pete Rose led the Reds' hitting assault in the '75 Series, going 10-for-27 (.370) in the 7 games versus Boston, plus 5 walks. This solid performance earned the Cincy third sacker Series MVP honors.

Tony Perez managed to swat 3 home runs in the Series, but only batted .179. Next to Rose, Cesar Geronimo had the best overall stats for a Reds' hitter, with a .280 average, 2 homers, and 3 RBIs.

On the Red Sox' side of the ledger, Carl Yastrzemski had an excellent final World Series of his career (.310 / 9 hits / 7 runs / 4 RBI). While reserve Bernie Carbo, who was with the Reds when they went to the 1970 Series against the Orioles, provided some mighty punch off the bench (.429 in 4 games, with 2 HR / 4 RBI).

The Reds wrapped up their 7th-game win on October 22nd, 1975, which, ironically, was exactly three years to the day after Cincy's seventh-game loss to Oakland in '72.

Joe Garagiola provides the narration for this Official MLB Productions home-video product. Video is in Full-Frame (1.33:1); audio is in Hi-Fi Mono; run time is about 37 minutes.

All those great highlights from that incredible Game 6 are here --- Evans' leaping catch at the fence, Foster's throw home that kept the game tied, Carbo's three-run blast in the 8th to tie the game @ 6-6, and, of course, Fisk's pleading with the baseball to stay fair in the 12th inning.  What a game that was.

If you want to re-live one of the greatest World Series ever played, just pop in this videocassette from Major League Baseball Home Video.",1099612800,3,2467,4.5542986425339365
7879800,5,6304963947,"The Boston Red Sox won the best game in the history of the World Series but unfortunately that was in Game 6 and not Game 7 and the Cincinnati Reds ended up winning the first of two consecutive titles in 1975.  Of course, now we know that because they sold Babe Ruth to the Yankees the Curse of the Bambino fates the Bosox to lose any World Series in which they play in seven games.  The Big Red Machine had won 108 games during the regular season and swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in the NL Championship series and then promptly ran into Luis Tiant who pitched a five hit shutout in Game 1.  The question then became how often Boston could pitch Tiant, which ended up being not often enough.  The Reds came up with a pair of runs in the ninth inning to pull out a 3-2 victory in Game 2 and the drama was on.
It goes without saying that everybody remembers Carlton Fisk's home run to win the epic Game 6, but there was other drama in this series involving the Boston catcher, namely the wild throw he made in Game 3 after getting tangled with Cincinnati pinch-hitter Ed Armbrister during an attempted sacrifice bunt that led to the winning run.  Tiant pitched another complete game and Tony Perez hit a pair of home runs as the Red Sox and Reds split the next two games to send the series back to Boston.
Watching the highlights of Game 6 only confirms what we already know about how great of a game this was; but did you know that the only reason the television camera stayed on Fisk when he hit his ball down the left field foul line in the 12th inning and urged the ball to stay fair was that a giant rat inside the Green Monster kept the cameraman from following the flight of the ball?  Instead we got to see Fisk's frantic gyrations and the ""reaction shot"" was born in the wonderful wide world of sports broadcasting.
Eventually, after a couple of days of rain cooled off everybody, they finally played Game 7, and the finale was a pretty good baseball game in its all right.  The Red Sox took a 3-0 lead but the Reds came back to tie the game in the 7th inning and once again a game in the 1975 World Series was decided in the final inning.  This explains why relief pitchers got credit for three of the Big Red Machine's four wins.  What more could you ask for? (this question only applies to those who are not Boston Red Sox fans).  Pete Rose led all batters with a .370 average and was named Series MVP.  Of course, nobody remembers anything he did in the series, all because of that Fisk fellow.",1050710400,5,2505,4.274841437632135
7879801,5,6304963947,"The Series featured Carlton Fisks dramatic 12th inning dinger. But the series had a lot more excitement. Joe Garagiola narrates, and the corny sound effects of the ball being hit, sound funny. The whole series was  filmed with real movie film, none of this video tape junk. The grainess of  film gives it a ghostly feel of a era gone past. The fans really were the  winners of this Series. You will be too at such a niffty price.  If you  watch only once world series this october, make it the 1975 world series!!",937526400,,513,4.414893617021277
