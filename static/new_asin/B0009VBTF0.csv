8067318,5,B0009VBTF0,Being French I understand the culture and the subtlety of the humour.  It is such a good study of the environement and atmosphere of a small village in the country.  It is an excellent movie which I enjoy watching over and over.,1365292800,,228,4.404761904761905
8067319,3,B0009VBTF0,"This charming little movie is well worth seeing. Unfortunately, it is advertised as having English subtitles but it does not. I understand French well enough to follow the story but I miss some of the dialogue. The movie itself has a great plot and a number of solid, well known actors. I'm just disappointed it is advertised saying it has English subtitles when it does not. C'est un mauvais jeu!",1242950400,,397,4.685714285714286
8067320,2,B0009VBTF0,"I got this move after watching the hilarious ""The Dinner Game"" (1999) with Jacques Villeret. Big mistake. With the amount of animosity between the main characters, it is hard to even hint at comedy - and I don't care if it's supposed to be regular or black comedy. How can you laugh at a couple that hates each other so much?! The ""jokes"" they play on each other are very stupid and crude - even life threatening. And we're supposed to enjoy this? The only redeeming moments are some relatively short scenes involving a corrupt attorney.",1222819200,,537,4.604166666666667
