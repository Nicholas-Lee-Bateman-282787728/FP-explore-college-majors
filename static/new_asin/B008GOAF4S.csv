5160486,5,B008GOAF4S,"This DVD was so enjoyable - I did not want it to end!!  What a wonderful way to get acquainted with the dynamic Booth Brothers trio and also with them as individuals; plus seeing them perform during some memorable appearances.  Bill Gaither conducted an informative interview with them before and after each song, and there was plenty of good humor and laughter, too.  The joy of the Lord was indeed present!!

Michael and Ronnie Booth are brothers, and as someone commented after hearing and seeing the three of them sing together, Jim Brady could be a brother though he is not (though they are of course brothers in the Lord), because his looks and his voice just meld so nicely with Mike and Ronnie's.  Their harmony is so sweet to the hearing; and when each sings individually, their voices are exceptional as well.

It was also uplifting to hear their personal testimonies of how the Lord has worked in their lives, in their music, and personally.  I am so glad I purchased this DVD, and hope there may be others coming soon.  In the meantime, I am ordering some of their CD's!",1354147200,,1082,4.598958333333333

5160492,5,B008GOAF4S,The Booth Brother's are truly a blessing to my mother. I emailed them how much my mom was blessed to see/hear them in live concert in our hometown. They asked for her address and sent her their latest DVD and a signed personal note card to her. They never asked her for a penny in return. There no other gospel groups I know of who would have done such a nice thing without being asked to do so or for anything in return. They have great harmony and really great voices with a variety of style gossip songs. I don't think I have heard any I haven't liked. Entertaining too.,1477008000,,573,4.218181818181818

5160532,5,B008GOAF4S,"I listen to this CD at least once a day.  I dearly love these young men and appreciate the talent they bring to the public.  This would be a great gift to give your church so they could play the music while people are getting settled in for a service.  God has to be smiling down on this trio for everything they bring to their audience.  I don't know if I have a favorite song but ""In Christ Alone"" is up there in the top 10.  I think Jim Brady is going to write a song that will last through the ages ... if he hasn't already.  For sure he is creative enough to make that happen.  There is sooooooooo much talent here and so little ego.  They are simply a joy!!!  Buy this CD for Christmas gifts.  It's the gift that will keep on giving.  I will ... and thank you Booth Brothers for just being!
LOVE the Booth Brothers!!!",1403740800,,823,4.049689440993789

5160540,5,B008GOAF4S,"These young men are so talented. I enjoyed the music with great hamonies but most of all, I was delighted by  the personal testimonies they gave and the sense of joy and humor they exhibited.",1394841600,,191,4.457142857142857
5160541,5,B008GOAF4S,"Even though  some of these songs are on DVDs that I already own, I could not be more blessed. Michael Booth's singing of Look for Me at Jesus' Feet amazed me on the South Africa video, and had the same affect all over again. Ronnie Booth's personal testimony moved me to tears, -not because I was saddened by it, but because I shared his discovery. This God believing man has a beautiful, never tiring to me, voice. Michael sings beautifully as well, is funny and lively, but when he sang Look for Me at Jesus' Feet, mouths hush, and audience movement was minimal. One could readily tell that this young man meant every word of it. He shared his faith and love for his Savior in that song, leaving me contemplating my final destination, for sure, and listening intently to every word, much like I did when Ronnie gave his spoken testimony.

All three of the guys gave great testimonies, almost casually their gripping words came in-between the song presentations that make up the musical part of this album. They each shared thoughts that I pondered days afterward. I live in Arizona, and this album was sent to me by a dear friend in Oregon, because she knew how much I wanted it, but I had no idea what a joy it would be!

Another was LOVE WAS IN THE ROOM, -what a song!  WHEN I MET THE MASTER had me on the edge of my seat. ALL OVER THE WORLD, was fun as well as inspiring. THANK HIM FOR THE MIRACLE, another song that makes one want to stop and thank our Lord for His great gift to us. LIVIN' FOR THE MOMENT, (written by Jim Brady), a really good song, -cheery and thoughtful..

The songs they sang tell their stories. Jim Brady told Bill Gaither, (and us that listen), he meant what he sang, and he wants folks to know this, H's serious. THEN I MET THE MASTER is a classic, and the Booth Bros. were the first ones I remember hearing sing it. An amazing song, and oh my, wait 'til you hear them sing it!  I loved SAIL ON. It was a fun song, with Jim Murray and Michael Booth hogging the scene, so to speak. I loved it.

I had heard a lot about the song CHRIST ALONE. I was curious, but the title seemed similar too many titles for songs or sermons, and there are a whole bunch of great songs out there, and great singers as well.. Well, what do I know anyway? That song, Christ Alone is another classic, and the Booth Brothers put their hearts into it, -and Larry Gatlin could scarcely keep his seat.  If I had been there, I think I would have joined Larry in his expressions of appreciation. As it was, I simply sat on the edge of my chair, as I tend to do when I hear something so moving.

One of almost everyone's favorites, THROUGH IT ALL,  is also on this DVD, interrupted by Michael's words entering into -and pulling us away- from this Canadian performance to bear witness of the message and meaning it brought to him. Then Ronnie added his most moving testimony. The guys do a wonderful job of blending, in conversation as well as musically. It rather reminds me of Ernie Haas' harmony rock. We all need such harmony, and it is great to see it in action. I can tell you: The testimonies of those three dear children of God were not intrusive to the music, but pleasantly given, and I valued each statement, and I do thank God that we have folks like those and the Gaither people to ""help us on our journey home.""",1394755200,,3324,4.295527156549521

5160543,5,B008GOAF4S,I rated this a 5 because this music really touched my heart.  All of their songs are from the scriptures and they have truth in all of them. I would  reccomend  all their CD's and DVD's to all non believers all so those who believe in Jesus . God Bless all who listen to the Booth Brothers,1394064000,,289,4.035087719298246

Watching this always lifts my spirits.  I love how they bring both some of the older songs together with newer material.  God is using them mightily and my prayer is that He will continue to do so.",1363564800,4,341,4.451612903225806

I heard them on TV and two days later was still hearing their songs in my head.  I found their DVD on Amazon and am delighted with the product.  It is even better than the TV program I heard, which had to leave some of it out to accomodate the commercials.
Anyone who likes uplifting good music would like this DVD.",1356566400,,467,4.458823529411765

Hearing their songs back to back was a richer experience than on the other dvd's
