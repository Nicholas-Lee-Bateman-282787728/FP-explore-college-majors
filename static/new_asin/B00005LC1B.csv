1620739,5,B00005LC1B,"John Cleese brings his signature brand of humor together with interesting and thought-provoking interviews to create such an interesting mini-series about the face - why is it beautiful (or not)?  What do expressions mean?  Do they mean the same thing to everyone?  Who is the BEST at knowing if people tell the truth - or if they lie?  What would life be like if you couldn't recognize the faces of friends?  Why are facial deformities so ""problematic"" for societies - is it because of their elevated importance of beauty, or is there a different reason?  This fascinating video will answer all these and more, leave you laughing... and actually make you SMARTER by the time its over.  Support given by the undeniably beautiful and witty Elizabeth Hurley, funny man Michael Palin, and others round out the experience.  I couldn't recommend this movie more.",1169251200,3,857,4.944055944055944
1620740,5,B00005LC1B,The tone of this series is fantastic.  You get to laugh and you get to learn a little.  I think it would be perfect for showing in an introductory sociology or anthropology class.  Its also great jut to watch.  John Cleese is just fantastic and its great to hear all the different theories about the human face presented so clearly.  Just a great series thats sure to brighten you day . . . and teach you a little something.,1157846400,,424,4.3164556962025316
1620741,4,B00005LC1B,"John Cleese and Elizabeth Hurley make learning fun in this documentary that exposes several interesting facts about human expression and the value placed by society on appearance. I own this documentary and have watched it many times. Any viewer will find his/her favorite segments, but all of them are highlighted with proper references and explanations. The educational journey this film takes is one that I have enjoyed.",1149292800,,423,5.3283582089552235
1620742,4,B00005LC1B,"I rented the move from my local library.  The first half was good, but I was disappointed with how it ended. The bonus features were weak. Overall, the movie was good.",1142899200,3,167,4.387096774193548
1620743,5,B00005LC1B,"this is a brilliant bbc series that is informative and fun! cleese takes us through different aspects of the human face, and interviews leaders in their fields. i wish more documentaries mixed humor with their subjects. i also liked the fact that this dvd could be enjoyed by all ages. it opens your eyes to the fascinating human face. cleese is the professor you wish you had in college.",1114387200,3,388,4.63768115942029
1620744,4,B00005LC1B,"The Human Face is a fascinating but scattershot approach to the topic.  John Cleese's approach is sure to delight his fans and annoy his detractors.  He manages in his own unique way (while ripping Elizabeth Hurley's face off and shooting fellow Monty Python alum Michael Palin not once, but twice!  Pythons always were excessive!) to convey many interesting and pertinent facts concerning the human face and our reactions to it.
Several sections were absolutely fascinating.  The discussion on the evolution of the face claims that humankind's move toward an upright posture created an emphasis toward the eyes and visual stimuli and away from the nose and the sense of smell.  Our profound reactions to facial expressivity are demonstrated in MRI brain scans that reveal activity deep in the amygdala as a reaction to faces showing fear although no conscious reaction was felt.  Several curiosities reminiscent of ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat"" are explored, including a man who, following an automobile accident, wholeheartedly believed that his parents had been replaced by other people who looked exactly like them--he was able to recognize their physical appearance but had lost the emotional attachment that allowed him to recognize their relationship.  Most heartening was a young woman with an exceptionally large jaw who had not only come to accept her looks but further to find her unique appearance a source of pride.
The series closes with an examination of fame, and here it seems to go astray--so much so that Cleese resorts to acts of gratuitous violence against Palin.  The focus shifted rather unsettlingly away from the face to the idea of fame.  The linking premise, of course, is that in the modern day it is our faces which make us famous (or not), while in the past it was our actions, and before the days of photography and portraiture particular faces were unknown.  This departure is not enough to spoil an otherwise excellent and wildly quirky series, though.",1003449600,43,1996,5.03951367781155
1620745,4,B00005LC1B,"John Cleese takes a different style in teaching us about the power of the human face.  The documentary does contain tons of interesting facts about the human face and its role through history.  What makes it stand out as a documentary is the twisted humor John Cleese, Michael Palin, and Liz Hurley (to name a few) inject into it.  Subjects of Beauty, Expressions, Identity, etc are explained not only verbally, but with great skits and sketchs.  Everything from skits with Michael Palin trying to get his face on a coin to Cleese and Hurley posing for the 18th Century French paparazzi painters, help make this as entertaining as it is educational.
Great for the whole family.",999388800,14,677,4.810344827586207
1620746,4,B00005LC1B,"I enjoyed this series and learned some new and amazing aspects of human physiology. I would especially recommend this` for young teenagers who might be caught up in the ""am I beautiful / handsome"" worries of adolescence. Interviews with individuals who have rare facial disorders, gave me a special appreciation of the ""inner beauty"" hidden in all of us.",998956800,11,354,5.016949152542373
1620747,4,B00005LC1B,"I enjoyed The Human Face - it's an interesting examination of how facial features have evolved, how one's face is interpreted by others, and tackles some elusive topics such as defining beauty. It's not a dry documentary, but rather a collection of ""factoids"" strung together in a generally entertaining and informative fashion.

The skits are an major component of each episode and, for the most part, if you're a Cleese fan you'll enjoy them. A few dragged on a bit too long - I would have preferred a bit more information than entertainment in the mix. But overall, an enjoyable way to walk away with some interesting information on the human face.",1276128000,,651,4.8125
1620748,5,B00005LC1B,"This documentary interweaves science, psychology, sociology, and humor to create a very accessible, informative, and entertaining program.  Are we ""hard-wired"" to a particular standard of beauty?  How do facial expressions get us through everyday life?  How can you tell if someone is lying?  What parts of the brain control facial recognition and emotional reaction?  What happens if one of those parts is damaged?  The answers are here, and a whole lot more fascinating stuff!  I sat down to watch episode 1 one afternoon, and wound up watching the whole thing.

John Cleese is an engaging, entertaining host. Some humor, but he's clearly on an adventure and is happy to have the viewer along for the ride.",1247011200,2,708,5.043103448275862
1620749,4,B00005LC1B,"A great series of hour-long episodes with host John Cleese introducing the human expression. It has some humor, but it is also factual with interviews with professionals and sad stories. This video is valuable for an artist to learn more about the reasons behind expression, but it is also a great video to watch for the sake of learning or information. A great tool for the classroom.",1227052800,,385,4.7611940298507465
1620750,4,B00005LC1B,"The product, this dvd, claims some type of ""decode"" software, if you want to see this in your PC, or a kind of domestic dvd machine capable of to read it format, from Englad, I suppose.
I live in Brazil, and now I had already solved the problem in PC, but I'm still in search of another kind of domestic dvd machine to substitute that I have.
In spite of all, I' glad with my purchase. To buy more I have to solve this problems.",1221609600,,428,4.047058823529412
1620751,3,B00005LC1B,"The first 3 episodes are pretty interesting and use a combination of animation and strange setups to make the points vivid and entertaining. There were demonstrations of the principles using things I had never seen before such as Indian laughter groups and the 1:1.618 golden ratio (ok I saw this in PI, but didn't know really how it connected to perfect beauty, and I had never studied otherwise).

(SPOILER - next paragraph)
In one part, a white woman who was raped by a black man helps to wrongly convict an innocent man for ELEVEN years and the worst thing about how she feels is EMBARRASSED? Wow! If I was responsible for something like that I would be devastated at taking away a part of someone's life. They used this to show how we can easily mistake faces and how we tend to lump other races into a prototype. The point was a good point, but a better example of a more regretful person would have been more poignant.

The last episode ""Fame"" was a big drag. There were some fun moments such as Cleese visiting his usual produce store, but a large part of the show was taken up by who this casting director was going pick. Where was the science for this episode? It was more like an expose in why some people are addicted to celebrities, and a reality TV contest. Ugh.

I would say watch it for the first 3 episodes and have fun with it, but don't expect this entire show to be a documentary into how our faces work, and don't expect it to be scientific.",1189382400,8,1462,4.387453874538745
1620752,3,B00005LC1B,"ive watched this program before and ignored the one big part that can enable one to totally disregard the findings of that ""beauty scientist"": the fact that he agreed with the as-expected pathetic selection of the fashion committee to choose that ugly-duckling, Zara, over the other finalist Rachel, a real asian/eurasian beauty.

this time, i just couldn't stand it and had to write a review... i don't mean to be mean, but that zara is one of the ugliest pos ive ever seen.. it's fitting that the gurus of the fashion industry would choose her to be their ridiculous representation of beauty, but for that doctor to approve this, measuring her features and confirming her ""beauty"" when i just wanted to puke, or at least turn away from the tv rather than look at buck-tooth zara, was too much

i mean, she's the type of girl the boys would throw food at during lunch and could only dream of making the high school cheerleading squad... how the hell did she get the idea to become a model??? has the world turned up side down???

zara, if u're reading this, i hope u have a successful career (NOT in the beauty industry b/c that's ridiculous)... and have a fulfilling life outside of the fashion biz, im sure there's SOME1 out there who thinks u're hot, not me though

oh yea, i was so shocked that that old broad, liz hurley, took exception to the doctor's obvious statement that females look their best from 14-24 (a reasonable, if not liberal, range), NOT! of course, she claimed that she got better looking in her late 20's and the program showed old black and white pics of her when she was a teen and w/o much make-up, if at all

first, i don't find old or young liz that hot anyways... second, im sure that by her late 20s, lizzy was already in the acting biz and always had make-up artists and fashion consultants to make her look her best, but i guess she doesnt think $10k of hair and make up and hours and hours of preparation in the make up room makes a big diff to her looks, but rather, her ""natural"" beauty increased as she got older... please, if she thinks she looked better waking up in the morning in her late 20s than when she was a teen, she's fooling herself

still, im giving it 3 stars b/c the 1.68 thingy sounds interesting, even though it failed to ""measure up"" w/ zara

UPDATE: of course chicks r going to rate this review as unhelpful... ill leave it up just to piss off more old hags who think they got prettier as they got older (LOL!) - one more note, liz hurley never mentioned she had plastic surgery (check utube), so not only was she being disingenuous, it didn't work",1185148800,4,2604,4.423799582463466

1620754,4,B00005LC1B,"John Cleese is not an academic but a comedian, so his approach to a serious subject has to be a little frivolous, but that is part of John's charm. None the less, Cleese is no fool. He approaches the subject from a number of directions, and comes up with quite a few surprises on why we recognize caricatures more easily than portraits, and just what is it that makes Elizabeth Hurley beautiful.

i enjoyed it on quite a few levels, for its intelligence, insight and humour.",1180656000,5,474,4.511627906976744
1620755,3,B00005LC1B,"This documentary is entertaining and sometimes informative, but parts of it focus on half-baked pseudo science that is one step above phrenology...

One section concentrates on the ""Duchenne"" or ""felt"" smile theory--this states that we can recognize a genuinely happy smile when the muscles around the eyes are compressed (or crinkled) by the upward action of the cheeks. While there may be truth to this in some cases, psychologists in this documentary make extraordinary claims-- at one point they set out to prove that they can predict a person's entire life based on one snapshot! They search through old yearbook pictures of girls for felt/Duchenne smiles, track some of them down and-- lo and behold-- the Duchenne girls are happily married while the non-Duchenne girls are single and miserable. Amazing!! But if you want to follow that experiment up, try going on some of the major dating websites and look through the pictures of people in their 30's and 40's... you'll find hundreds of the most brilliant, exuberant, eye-crinkling grins you'd ever want to see on those desperate, lonely faces! Yegads--how is it possible that all those people with such gorgeous smiles are still single???

Another section focuses on female beauty. We meet a scientist who claims to have discovered the mathematical formula for the perfect female face. Eureka! He has designed a transparent mask which he compares to women's faces to determine whether or not they are beautiful. We see a few pretty faces that do, indeed, correspond to ze formula. Herr doktor says it is all based on a ratio discovered by the ancient Greeks. Unfortunately, the formula, if it works at all, only seems to work with caucasian faces. I tried comparing the proportions to some gorgeous black models and their noses were all too wide. I'm sure Mediterranean and Semitic longer-faced beauties would also have a hard time fitting his mask. What I want to know is, who on earth funds such hogwash????!! This guy has a laboratory and everything! Please, give me a laboratory, I'll come up with all kinds of wacky stuff to do...

Anyway, if you like kitschy stuff, you will enjoy this show. John Cleese is fun.",1180483200,4,2176,4.956164383561644

Hurley steals the show from Cleese throughout, though viewers really won't mind.
