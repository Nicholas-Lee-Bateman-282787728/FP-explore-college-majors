7838120,3,6303115543,"This is a watchable movie by Jerry and Dean, but throughout the movie Jerry acts like a 7 year-old child and makes the same faces that he makes in all his movies, plus he acts like he's terrified much of the time, which does get old and tired after a while. I guess that almost all of the movies that he made with Dean were like this, so I'm not really surprised. I think that Jerry's best movies were made without Dean, like ""The Nutty Professor"" and ""The Family Jewels"". I love Dean Martin, especially his old TV show, which was great and really funny. I believe that it was all for the best that they broke up and went their separate ways. This is a rare movie that for some strange reason is not available in the USA on DVD, but I found it on videotape after accidently buying it from a country on the other side of the world in the wrong format first. Children might enjoy this silly movie more than adults, but I never really got any laughs out of it.",1468454400,,957,4.178378378378379
7838121,5,6303115543,The DVD is in perfect condition and plays flawlessly in my RCA DVD player - this is a VERY-HTF movie and I really enjoyed watching it again after all these years (decades actually) - Dean and Jerry really were a great team and I remember being saddened by their breakup but now being able to watch their movies again is great. - SBJ,1423699200,,332,4.285714285714286
7838122,5,6303115543,"This VCR tape is a joy! Bought as a gift for son and he loves it! The cover was a bit used up but was a very fair deal considering that. Couldn't be happier. Love this movie. Sweet, touching and funny.",1390348800,,201,3.926829268292683
7838123,3,6303115543,The VHS movie is in Great shape and the movie plays  Ok .  I just wish I could have gotten it on a DVD instead of a VHS,1357689600,,119,3.2142857142857144
7838124,5,6303115543,"""Pardners"" has always been my favorite Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis movie. The combination of this famous team's humor and song, along with a western setting make for an enjoyable time. Some excellent character actors in supporting roles, including Jeff Murrow, add to the western action. I'm glad others have commented on the closing where Dean and Jerry speak directly to the audience about continuing to come and see their films. I saw this in a theater just months before their famous breakup and the irony has stayed with me. Optimist that I am, I kept hoping for M & L to reunite for more films. Never happened, but thankfully we have this and other Martin & Lewis films on tape and hopefully one day, restored on DVDs.

7838125,3,6303115543,"""Pardners"" (1956) was Martin and Lewis' next-to-last film and it remains among their best. A loose remake of Bing Crosby's ""Rhythm on the Range"" (1936), this breezy western comedy has the duo in good form, with a strong supporting cast featuring Agnes Moorehead and Lon Chaney Jr. Unlike ""Hollywood or Bust"" (the team's farewell appearance), Dean and Jerry were on speaking terms during the production and their rapport is evident from beginning to end. One of the film's most memorable (and ironic) scenes has Martin and Lewis taking aim at the final credits, while assuring their fans that they will continue to make beautiful cinema together. It didn't turn out that way, but you have to admire Dean and Jerry for breaking up at the height of their phenomenal success - rather than face the downhill trajectory that greeted most comedy teams.",1082246400,4,845,4.957746478873239
7838126,5,6303115543,"This video is hard to find, except through Amazon.  Worth the price. Soundtrack is one of the better ones, if you can find it, as well. Dean Martin, for western fans, was a very good gun handler (as well as a fine  singer) and you get a glimpse of his  skill in this flick.  I agree with  the previous reviewer, the end credits are fun to watch. As always, the  plot of M & L movies are far-reaching, but if you are watching a M  & L movie for the plot, go back to reading Webster's Dictionary.  If  you half-way like M & L, half-way like comedies or half-way like  westerns, you'll enjoy this movie. Buy it before it's so far out-of-print  that you'll never find it. Enjoy.",941932800,11,674,4.1875
