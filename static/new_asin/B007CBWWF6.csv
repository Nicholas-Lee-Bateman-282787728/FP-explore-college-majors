5077136,5,B007CBWWF6,"This has to be the cutest little DVD ever! My girls really enjoyed the first Gruffalo DVD so I knew my girls would adore the Gruffalo's Child as well. And I was right, they really got into the movie and watched it waiting for the Big Bad Mouse to appear. I really enjoyed watching this DVD with my girls and loved that the story plot rhymed through out the whole movie. My favorite part is when The BIG Bad Mouse Appeared!! We really enjoyed the Gruffalo's Child DVD!!

Over all the Gruffalo and The Gruffalo's Child are delightful stories, and both would be great for any child's movie Library. These Movies would be an awesome gift for the Upcoming Holiday season as well!!",1345680000,,675,4.487804878048781
5077137,5,B007CBWWF6,"I had the great opportunity to not only review this movie, but also the book! My kids love books, as do I, so it was obvious that I started the night before reading the book to my kiddos. They loved it. The pictures are so entertaining and interactive. They enjoyed trying to guess what each creature was on every page and then both were surprised with the cute ending.

The next day we decided to watch the movie. At first I didn't tell the kids there was a movie so they were pleasantly surprised. The book is a quick read so I expected the movie to be super short but instead they drew it out to a reasonable 40 minutes. It was the perfect length. Now, parts were a little spooky for the kids but nothing disturbing or to worry about. My kids are 3 and 4 and they enjoyed the suspense. I put the DVD in while I was resting, they took the book and basically ""read"" along with the movie! Perfect!",1345507200,,897,4.184971098265896
5077138,5,B007CBWWF6,"This movie is beyond adorable and a great addition to The Gruffalo... It's a must have for any family's DVD collection. We have the book, but with the beautiful animation the movie makes it truly special and come to life. As The Gruffalo shares the journey of the mouse's adventure through the deep, dark woods, The Gruffalo's Child tells the tale of The Gruffalo's baby as he ventures through the woods. So cute with a fun twist at the end!!",1345507200,11,442,4.5375
5077139,5,B007CBWWF6,"The Gruffalo's Child is just as cute as The Gruffalo!  Both have soothing, beautiful music and are narrated by an all-star cast.  My kids absolutely love this story!  It starts with the Gruffalo telling his little girl about ""The Big Bad Mouse.""  This show makes my kids giggle and gasp.  It's 40 minutes long which is a perfect amount of time for me to get the kitchen cleaned. :)",1345507200,20,381,4.463768115942029
5077140,5,B007CBWWF6,"I was sent this movie by the studio to review and give my thoughts. I have two daughter (4 & 5) and they absolutely love bedtime stories, but they've got a set few that they want to read. They were happy to add The Gruffalo's Child to the mix. The illustrations are really what drew them in and the sing-song rhyme of the story kept them hooked. They also really enjoyed the DVD that tells the same story. The DVD is just like the book in motion - a narrator telling the story and the action unfolding in animation.

This is a great story and follow-up to The Gruffalo that children will love!",1345075200,10,593,4.247787610619469
5077141,5,B007CBWWF6,"What an enchanting story about a young Gruffalo and her father. Her father tells her of the Big Bad Mouse who lives in the forest and she wants to find out more. Her adventure leads her into the forest where she meets many creatures and of course the Mouse. She learns to be brave but also learns her father will protect her always.

The DVD which tells the story is wonderful . It really makes the story come alive. You can see the facial expressions and the story is enhanced with more details as the young Gruffalo searches for the Big Bad Mouse.

It is a nice family story that I know you and your children will enjoy watching.",1344643200,,631,4.294117647058823

5077163,5,B007CBWWF6,"Thank you JGPR for sending us this DVD to review!

After the resounding success of The Gruffalo, the author, Julia Donaldson released The Gruffalos Child in 2004. The Gruffalos Child was one of the biggest best-sellers of 2004 and won WHS Children's Book of the Year at the British Book Awards. Like the prequel, this childrens storybook has a 5-star rating on Amazon and a DVD based on it.

As spontaneous as the gruffalo came into existence, his daughter followed suit. Still being convinced that all the animals in the forest fear the mouse, he instructs his daughter to not go into the deep dark wood to avoid running into the big bad mouse. Because children are known to be curious, the young gruffalo defies her fathers orders and sneaks out in the middle of the night to see the mouse with her own eyes.

Along the way, she runs into the same snake, fox, and owl who have been out-witted by the mouse before. They gladly tell her the way to the mouses home since they believe that it enjoys feasting on gruffalos. The young gruffalo does indeed meet the mouse and joins the other creatures in being out-witted by him.

Ill leave out the specifics since this thirty minute movie is worth experiencing first hand. While deception and lying is encouraged in this tale, there is a lesson taught about trusting and obeying your parents since they know whats best for you.

The Gruffalos Child can be rented on Amazon for $3.99 or owned for a dollar more. Its well worth picking up if you enjoyed the prequel. The best bargain is a double feature DVD that includes both movies and typically sells for less than $6.50.",1484956800,,1618,4.58477508650519
5077164,5,B007CBWWF6,"My two year old daughter absolutely loves this little film. It's not quite as solid of a story as The Gruffalo, but being set in winter it has a very magical feel, and the soundtrack is lovely and mesmerizing. I enjoy watching it just as much as she does - especially because it's a quiet little film. A welcome relief from some of the more frantic children's programming.",1484265600,,372,4.485294117647059

However, upon watching it for the first time, I found that the illustration style and music are all very soft and sweet.  I like that although the pace is much slower than other animated films these days, the film is very effective in building suspense.

5077319,5,B007CBWWF6,"We read the book as a family first and then watched this movie.  The movie is MUCH longer than we were expecting - which is a great thing!  The animation is crisp and the storyline is fun and engaging for the whole family.  My kids loved the accents of the actors and thought it was hilarious how the Gruffalo's child got tricked!  A very enthusiastic thumbs up from my 2, 5, and 7 year old kiddos!",1346803200,,398,4.197368421052632
5077320,5,B007CBWWF6,"My 3yo daughter is so enamored with this film that she has it memorized.  MEMORIZED.  She quotes lines from it when playing with her big brother.  If I tell her she can't watch the movie, when she asks, she grabs the book and pleads with me to read it.

Seriously one of the favorite stories in our collection.
