This was so funny.
If you want a laugh you have to see this DVD.",1366329600,,140,3.8620689655172415
1687763,5,B0000633TX,"This is comicView when it was funny; Cedric The Entertainer is one of my favorite comedians and in this DVD you get to see him when he was an up & comer. I don't like too much blue comedy because a lot of comedians think being vulagar is a substitute for being funny but Cedric is hilarious and clean in his first stand up showcase. This is a must get if you grew up in an urban household in the 70s & 80s. This is great I was BET would re-release these early ComicView featuring DL, Cedric, Rickey Smiley.",1297728000,3,506,4.121212121212121

1687765,5,B0000633TX,"All Cedric the Entertainer fans need this DVD! I have been watching him since he was the host of BET's Comic View after DL Hughley completed his season the the popular TV show, now in it's 10th year.  The reason I think I like his comedy is because I can relate to many of his jokes.  His skits include: that old music where he explains Al Green and his ""documentary"" song ""Love and Happiness"", the difference between white churches and black churches, ""Old School"", where ""Flashlight"" by the Parliament Funkdelic is playing, while he entertains the audience by doing a series of dances, old and new, plus many others. Other benefits of this DVD include: Quick Clips, the skits/jokes from other comedians.  If you are a Cedric the Entertainer fanatic, you have to have this one to add to your growing DVD collection.",1028246400,11,816,4.6923076923076925
