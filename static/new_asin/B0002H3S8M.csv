2098414,1,B0002H3S8M,the release date on this says 2010 how ridiculous!,1111363200,9,50,4.666666666666667
2098415,5,B0002H3S8M,"I have tried everything from walking miles, running miles, eliptical, treadmill, Leslie Sansone and nothing has worked like this workout.  I am 45 and was in fair shape, and it is definately hard in the beginning, but what a sense of accomplishment when I can do more and more every day!  I have been doing the 55 minute workout for about 2 1/2 months, every other day, and have increased muscle, stamina, and lost only 7 pounds, but that will come with time.  My stomach is flatter, I am stronger, and I still can't do all of the reps with the bands, but that's what makes it fun! Remember, it's a process, and you'll be thrilled with the results if you work at it.",1145404800,7,666,4.354838709677419
2098416,2,B0002H3S8M,"First off, let me start out by saying that this bootcamp series does work.  I used it for about 2 weeks and saw great results..BUT and this is a but B-U-T, I started going insane by his voice.  He doesn't really teach the moves...he is too busy talking and motivating that he often loses count so you wind up doing a whole lot more than on the other side.  You just want to scream, ""Oh SHUT UP AND GET ON WITH IT!""  He just talk, talks, and talks...I swear I don't think he even stopped for one second.  I would even have to put he dvd on pause so I could even out my muscle workouts.  This dvd looks like it was quickly made.  I was very disappointed.",1140825600,6,652,4.046875
2098417,5,B0002H3S8M,I purchased the 3 disc set along with a new tae bo cardio dvd and it is HARD!!! (but in a good way of course!) the resistance bands really help to shape your muscles and after having 3 kids I never thought I could look fit again until I did these exercises. 3 times a week for a month and I was already seeing results... A much better workout than the 'Firm' tapes and my expensive Elliptical machine I am now seeing my old abs again!! My arms are also shapely and no longer thick trunks and I lost 15 lbs. so far. He does a great job motivating you to contine and their counts make it easy for you to keep up with the rest of them. This is an extremely good workout even better than the tae bo cardio dvd I purchased (too easy) and I recommend it to anyone who wants actual results fast.,1133913600,7,788,4.025477707006369
2098418,5,B0002H3S8M,"First off, don't listen to Al Ray. The girl in the video he is talking about is a legendary US female martial artist Shellie Blanks, Billy's daughter. She is an instructor on both BootCamp and TaeBo. Basically, everywhere Billy is, she is. Anyway, Shellie does not scream and shout like Al Ray describes. Billy in the tapes instructs to scream it out to keep pushing yourself in the first place. As for the product it is the greatest home fitness system on the planet, bar none. This is the best way to strength train and lose body fat at the same time. A lot of problems people run into is that if they want to build muscle, they lift, but don't do much cardio because they get so sore. People who do more cardio don't want to lift because they get too sore and don't do their cardio. This is the best middle ground I have ever embraced. These workouts are action packed and garunteed to get you results. In weeks you will see the fat start to melt away and muscle beginning to develop. The workouts don't drain the life out of you like running or lifting might. Everytime I finish a workout, I feel energized. These workouts are tough and require mental fortitude in order to get through each of them strong. Billy and his team are very encouraging and have created a great supportive community for all of those who decide to engage in BootCamp or TaeBo. Both will get you results, but I reccommend BootCamp because it has finally given me the stomach I have always wanted by crunching out the fat that was there and building solid defined muscle. Basic science is that the more muscle you have, the more fat/calories you burn. Billy has been an instructor for over 20 years and only wants an opportunity to change your life. Give Billy that opportunity.",1117065600,27,1756,4.490625
2098419,5,B0002H3S8M,"This is a great workout series!  I highly recommend it if you want to feel the fat fall off your body.  It can be done with and without the ""Billy Bands.""  I just wanted to comment that you can find the Boot Camp series on the QVC website instead of the Billy Blanks websites.  It is a much better deal too!  You get the original four DVD's - basic training, ultimate, cardio-live, ab and then they throw in the lower body work out.  It comes with the bands and the 4 week program!  Also, if that weren't enough they offer it for a cheaper price and their shipping is a TON cheaper!  Enjoy!",1116979200,46,590,4.15929203539823
2098420,2,B0002H3S8M,"I'll start off with what I liked about Ultimate Bootcamp.  Billy Blanks conducted a good workout.  Also, the music was an improvement over the other Tae Bo I have.  The bad news is that one of the people in his video overshadows the music & Billy Blanks. She looked good (Shelly) but screamed/screeched loudly throughout the video. Not only was it extremely irritating, she was given a MICROPHONE!  Sometimes music can help take the edge off exercising which would've been of course preferred along w/Billy Blanks instruction. But, since they gave the woman a microphone the irritating screaming and screeching overshadowed the music and Billy Blanks. The video is hard enough but to have the screaming screech irritation made it impossible for me to keep the sound on. And, that makes it tough because Billy Blanks instruction is needed. It's weird how one screeching negative can adversely affect the positive.",1116201600,5,912,5.06
2098421,5,B0002H3S8M,I just received the tae bo boot camp series today and couldn't wait to start it! I did the basic training and it was awesome! I have been doing tae bo for a while but this really put my arms to the test. I can't wait to try the rest of the DVDs. I ordered mine directly through the Billy Blanks website and it is available now. I don't know why it says 2010. It came with 4 dvds and a 7 day supply of energy supplements. It also comes with 'billy bands' which you use throughout the workout to maximize results. I would take it easy if you are a beginner.,1114387200,16,555,3.9642857142857144
2098422,4,B0002H3S8M,this is a great workout and its already been released.  I do not know if it is a typo that it says 2010 or what but its a great package and very advanced workout.  The band are a little hard on the shoulder joints though.  I have to take breaks myself or else ouch! Other than that its a very challenging workout. Try it!,1113782400,6,321,3.984375
2098423,5,B0002H3S8M,"I purchased the videos on the billy blanks website.  They are not for beginners, but it is possible to start out with them if the ""Billy Bands"" aren't used.  These are the videos I was waiting for when I purchased the Taebo Power series last year.  In other words, I was hoping that The Taebo Power videos would be challenging, but they were not.  The Taebo Boot camp videos build strength, cardio vascular, toning of the arms and legs as well as a great ab workout.  If you can use the ""Billy Bands"", more power to you.  I chose to use the Power Balls that came with the Taebo Power series.  They work the same way without being too stressful on the joints in the shoulders.

The Infomercial I saw regarding this product says that you will see results in 7 days.  This is true if you stick to a sensible diet and work out on a regular basis.  Billy's motivations in the videos are short and to the point.  ""Fight for your Life"".  What else does the man have to say.",1112832000,30,966,4.247252747252747
2098424,1,B0002H3S8M,"I mean REALLY!!!!!  Who is going to buy something now, only to get it several years later.  Who are they KIDDING????  Sounds like a SERIOUS SCAM to me.",1112486400,2,151,4.321428571428571
8027943,5,B0002H3S8M,Awesome workout!!,1453939200,,17,8.0
8027944,5,B0002H3S8M,Love it!!! So far so good! This set is so challenging. I enjoy using the resistance bands for strengthening and toning. Definitely NOT a boring workout. You'll feel it working immediately.,1378339200,,188,5.096774193548387
8027945,5,B0002H3S8M,I love the Billy Blanks exercise videos.  I am someone who enjoys exercising when I feel the motivation.  So being able to slip in the video and begin at any given moment is great.  It is an incredible workout and it leaves me feeling like I have really accomplished something for myself everytime.  He is great at leading the groups and you can begin at any level and stay there until you gain confidence in your ability and then move on!  When I saw it offered on Amazon I knew immediately that I would not be disappointed in the quality of what I would receive.  Amazon's ads are always very accurate.,1322784000,,604,4.396396396396397
8027946,4,B0002H3S8M,"workouts a really good, but i have to say Billy Blanks repeats his words a lot like ""work it, work it, work it"". it does get very annoying but exericises are great, but he's really annoying!",1177027200,,190,4.305555555555555
8027947,4,B0002H3S8M,"Sweating up a storm, cussing, bargaining... all things that happen again and again when i do this video. Am I stuck on basic training without the bands?  Yes. I am. Do I shiver a little when I think about adding the bands or moving on to the Abs video? Of course I do. Does the very thought of attempting the Ultimate bootcamp video make me a little faint? It sure does.  BUT, in three weeks just watching what i eat and doing the Basic Training I have lost over 10 lbs and i am back in my size 5 jeans. Just as a side note while at first I was glad that he had ""normal"" looking, yet strangely muscular women (which kind of makes me a little wary of the results of doing this for too long)as his back up entourage, now that i do it every other day I find myself a little sad that I don't have some hotter people to look at. Also, while Blanks crazy motivational rants were at first... well... motivating, I now try to turn down the sound because it's just another thing that marks the crazy, slow passage of time while I am stuck in the middle of yet another severe-burning-in-some-part-of-my-body excercise.  It works though, do it from start to finish and you will see results like crazy even without the bands, I'm thinking do it with the bands and you might end up looking like the female studs in the video.",1175731200,2,1312,4.261044176706827
8027948,5,B0002H3S8M,"First off let me state, I LOVE TAE-BO.. I have been using Billy Blanks excerise dvd's/tapes from the beginning and The Boot Camp is Great!! However I have to agree with others about Shellie. She is EXTRMELEY IRRITATING. All she does is yell and Screech .It seems like she really needs Attention. Other than that this is a great product and I definitly recommend it..",1160006400,,366,4.6461538461538465
8027949,5,B0002H3S8M,"I have been a Tae-bo fan for years, so after having my son, I decided to get back into it with some new DVD's.  I was AMAZED when I tried the new boot camp basic workout and ultimate workout!!  It really is a total body workout and the resistance bands make a HUGE difference!!!  My abs were sore from top to bottom and muscle were sore that normally don't get worked in any workout, like the very back of your arms.  I began to see results after the first week.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these workouts and reccommend them to any Tae-bo fans.

(I do have to say that I did not like the ab workout or the live workout, but it is still worth every penny to get the bands, and the basic and ultimate workouts.)",1154044800,,702,4.087591240875913
8027950,5,B0002H3S8M,"The Boot camp series are just awesome.  I love how Billy incorporated resistant bands with the workout.  You will feel the burn as you use them. Billy will push you and motivate you at the same time.  If you love Tae Bo, you will really love Boot camp.  Do these workouts and watch your body change!",1153440000,,299,4.285714285714286
8027951,5,B0002H3S8M,"I have been a taebo fan since the begining, and I have to say that this is a great workout, everyone keeps asking what do I do to look so great and I tell them taebo and they laugh, they think I am joking. The bands really work my arms were so flabby before I wasn't able to wear short sleeve shirts, now I can and my arms look so toned.  I can't wait till he comes out with a new workout, I have all of the Taebo workouts and I alternate between all of them some are harder than others but I always get a great workout no matter wich one I do.  I owe my new figure to Billy and his 7 day success plan. Thanks Billy and Shellie, I will be waiting for your next new workout.",1153094400,2,673,3.8
8027952,4,B0002H3S8M,"I received the package and was very excited to get going... now granted, Billy does say not to use the bands for the first couple of times until you get used to the moves but since I consider myself a Taebo ""pro"" I jumped right in with them. (the strain it put on my shoulders and upper arms caused them to swell up, so I recommend starting with the removable weights first!)  My only real complaint is the abs video.  I have never really liked Billy's ab exercises, I find them strange and uncomfortable, but with the bands involved, wrapping them both around your body as you crunch, it was painful!  I had all my arm hair ripped off and identical bruises on my upper arms where the bands pinched.  I find all of the rest of the workouts fun, especially the lower body workout.  I acutally liked the diet program that is included... it gave me all kinds of interesting ideas on cooking things, stuff I've never thought of (putting a veggie burger in a whole wheat pita with avocado and tomatoes? YUM!)I don't really dare try the suppliments that came.  The dogtags are kinda silly. Overall a great workout, as always.",1151971200,2,1119,4.487684729064039
