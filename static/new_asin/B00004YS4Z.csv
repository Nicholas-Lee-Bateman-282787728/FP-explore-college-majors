7927466,5,B00004YS4Z,"John and Emma are back and are here to stay via DVD technology. Being on DVD, the aesthetics about the actual episodes are not in question here. More appropriately one may ask how they look. They look good, very good. If you relish a series like ""The Avengers"" or ""Twilight Zone"" you no doubt know about the content of what you are getting. You are more likely concerned about the quality of what you are getting. Like John might say to Emma, ""You scratch my back I'll scratch your back.""",971308800,,488,4.433333333333334
