A few of the testimonies are from witnesses that sound like they are embellishing on their story. A lot of the so-called expert testimonies are from what sound like pentecostal or even new age spiritualists. I would suggest also watching ""Beware of Angels"" which tells of how new age beliefs about angels can sometimes lead people to do things that are very dangerous, including suicide.",1516492800,,490,5.215189873417722

It ask the question, ""Are We Alone?"" and the answer is NO, but A little truth mixed with lies is a dangerous thing.",1297036800,12,292,4.425925925925926
