8505494,4,B006WA0DT0,The LinkedIn site is not exactly intuitive or user friendly - lost of esoteric terms and actions.  This CD has been extremely helpful in navigating and learning the site.,1408492800,,170,4.862068965517241
8505495,4,B006WA0DT0,I am a newbie to Linkedin. Just wanted to know what it was about to get feel for it. I am not much of a reader so I bought this. The disk is a little funny. A menu runs down left side and you choose video to run by clicking on. It is almost like a book with video chapters. I don't have an Apple so I can not say if any problems running on an Apple but ran fine with Windows. I learned a lot. Nothing mind blowing but I did not feel cheated.,1339977600,,441,3.6526315789473682
8505496,1,B006WA0DT0,"I have no idea if this is good information, my computer could not read the disk. I am taking quite a few courses and I have uploaded several disks and have not had any problems. This is the only disk I have had problems with. Will keep trying to install this for a while and if the problem continues, I am sending this back. I went on the Scribere website to see if they had any information on uploading that might identify problems, they had nothing. I'd be careful ordering this if I were you!",1338508800,,495,4.221052631578948
