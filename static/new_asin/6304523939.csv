895862,5,6304523939,"Don't miss this! This the best oldie movie I have ever seen! The special effects, in crisp black and white, were flawless, not ""hokey"" like most action movies of the period. When I watch this movie I feel that I'm ""there"" - I love the big cars,the street scenes, machines, fire trucks, ambulances, ships, planes and the fashions! Donald Woods is as dashing a hero as Erroll Flynn and Kathyrn Adams is as sweet as your little sister. The bad guys are trying to kill them and steal the protype of the Air Forces military plane. There's a lot of fistfights, car chases, crashes, and we enjoy long displays of flying stunts (small propeller planes)in every segment of the serial. The characters are all very close, like a family and their is a constant light-heartedness and implied romances.

No, it's no Spy Smasher nor Captain Marvel, but it's still marvelous serial in its own right. It's highly entertaining, and isn't that what serials are supposed to be? To be 100% honest, there are plot holes and sudden leaps in the story development that could easily have been smoothed out if it had just been a 15-chapter serial, but they don't irretrievably ruin the story.

896117,3,6304523939,"""Sky Raiders"" is a 12-chapter serial from Universal, released early in 1941, directed by Ford Beebe and Ray Taylor.  The story is by Eliot Gibbons with screenplay by Clarence Upson Young and Paul Huston.

Former World War flying aces, Captain Bob Dayton (Donald Woods) and Ed Carey (Robert Armstrong) have gone into airplane manufacturing as Sky Raiders, Inc.  Dayton has developed a ""miracle"" pursuit 'plane in which the Army is interested.  But foreign agents, headed by Felix Lynx (Eduardo Ciannelli) try to get the plans for the 'plane by getting an agent, R. S. Hinchfield (Irving Mitchell) hired as Controller and Treasurer of Sky Raiders.  Hinchfield tells Lynx there are no plans, that Dayton keeps the design in his head, so Lynx sends another agent, Caddens (Reed Hadley) to steal the 'plane itself.

The goals of the foreign agents are a little weak for a whole serial; Republic would have resolved the attempted theft of the 'plane in a chapter or two, but Universal manages to pad the story out fairly successfully.  There's an ongoing rivalry between the impulsive Dayton and the cautious Ed Carey.  Mary Blake (Kathryn Adams), Dayton's secretary, talks him into hiring young Tim Bryant (Billy Halop) at an ""Air Youth of America"" model 'plane contest, so later we get a chapter where Dayton gives Tim flying lessons.  Mary is in love with her boss, making her especially suspicious when the bad guys use a female agent, Innis Clair (Jacqueline Dalya) with a sob story so Dayton will hire her as Hinchfield's secretary.  So unlike most serials there is something other than fistfights for character interaction.  But it stalls the plot, which descends into possibly an all-time low for Universal in a non-plot-related conversation over breakfast.  Billy Halop is fit awkwardly into the story and Eduardo Ciannelli vanishes for long stretches; neither are used effectively, and several cliffhangers are the result of natural dangers, such as flying through bad weather, rather than being due the activities of the bad guys.  A few of these cliffhangers will be recognised as ""old friends"" first seen in earlier serials, and Universal's model work was not as effective as Republic's.  But Captain Dayton is played well by Donald Woods, and through make-up is made to look old enough to be a World War flying ace, while Robert Armstrong needs no such enhancement.

Alpha's edition, # ALP 4526D is on a single disc, double-layer, and the image is fairly sharp.  The source print was a reissue from Serials Incorporated, and it looks very much like the one I taped from cable TV about 20 years ago.  These prints are hardly ideal, but most of the time the contrast and gray scale are adequate, if some of the white lettering of the opening titles get lost in the bright sky, and in a couple chapters the brightness suddenly changes with things getting a little murky.  There is a slight maroon color cast, which is doubtless Alpha's fault, but it is not especially severe and easy enough to correct.  It also helps to use the ""tone"" controls to adjust the sound, which is usually loud and clear, but with some ""hiss"" and lacking in low frequencies.  The film prints lacked the original ""next week"" titles except on the last chapter, though even having an example, Serials Incorporated didn't follow the format for their substitutes.  But Alpha isn't responsible for those titles, and for once they didn't put their logo on-screen anywhere until the very end of the serial.

VCI's edition on VHS, # 1776 is on two cassettes, and is from the same batch of Serials Incorporated prints.  The copy I got was not duplicated very well, having a washed-out image.  Doubtless other copies didn't have this problem, but they wouldn't likely look any better than Alpha's DVD.

Despite IMDb's rating of 7.1, vs. 7.0 for ""Spy Smasher,"" serial fans are not likely to think of ""Sky Raiders"" as one of Universal's better efforts.  It's a little low on action, the ""love interest"" aspects of the plot require some suspension of disbelief, and it would have helped if the flying scenes had included some air battles with the bad guys.  But if watched with a day or more between chapters, its unusual content helps maintain interest.  Another review warns that it is now issued on a DVD-R DL disc, which my copy was not, but with a compatible player this shouldn't be a big issue.  This is a good release for Alpha, and at the price quite a bargain.",1360108800,5,4438,4.841059602649007
896118,5,6304523939,"A very watchable edition of this serial from 1941.

896163,3,6304523939,"As a kid, my mother would give me 25 cents, thats right a quarter, every Saturday.
I would go downtown to the theater, where on Saturday, there would be two full feature films, six to twelve cartoons, and a drawing during the intermission, for tickets, box of suckers, etc.  And then the weekly serial.  Flash Gordon was always the favorite.  What was also good, I could stay in the theater into the evening and watch the movies again.  They would not show as many cartons.
Anyway, these serials are fun to watch.  I only gave three stars as I have some Charlie Chan that were
re-mastered and look better than what remember as a kid.  I would be nice to have these re-mastered as there are some dark areas that you cannot see the actors.  But they are still fun to watch.  If you are looking for serous drama, forget it, these are corny,  fun, and watch the fights,  nine times out of ten, the hats the men are wearing stay on.

In the case of Sky Raiders, in the 2nd episode, our hero departs the home field of ""Sky Raiders Inc."" en-route to Denver and as he takes to the air he flies past the Glendale CA. hanger of Timm Aircraft Corporation.

Timm Aircraft contributed to our early aircraft industry having started up in 1922. They developed and sold the ""Collegiate"" two seaters, one of which set a world endurance record in 1930 of 378 hours.

Another was an American training monoplane built for the United States Navy as the N2T-1. It was made of plywood (Howard Hughes's 'Spruce Goose' was not the first)and the US Navy bought over 260 of them. More were sold to civilian use after WWII.

Its paint scheme garnered it the sobriquet ""Yellow Bird"".

SKY RAIDERS played theaters half a year before the attack on Pearl Harbor drew America into WWII. With all the war news coming out of Europe in those months prior to that terrible event, it's clear the country was already gearing up for the possibility of military action. Serials such as this one, HOLT OF THE SECRET SERVICE or SEA RAIDERS were good barometers of pre-war America's mood.

THE STORY of SKY RAIDERS (1941):
A former WWI ace (Woods) hires a member of the Air Youth of America (Halop) to help him develop an aircraft with a special bombsight. An enemy agent (Ciannelli) seeks to ruin their goal and steal the plans.
