277274,3,6300248100,"When I first saw ""Enemy Mine"" in the movie theater, I liked the film quite a bit.  But after seeing it again on video, it dropped a few of points.  I do think that the professional critics have a point, it does get a little  uncomfortably warm and fuzzy.  However, it is different enough from the  rest of the crowd, has some unique sets, and a solid performance from  Gossett Jr., that I'll still give it 6 out of 10.  I think most first-time  viewers will like this film and would give it a higher rating.",924134400,2,507,4.208333333333333

Andrews Blu-ray Review: ENEMY MINE [1985] finds us in the far off distant future, where humanity fight for distant star systems against an alien race called the Dracs. When human pilot Willis E. Davidge [Dennis Quaid] crash-lands on a hostile, barren alien world, he must forge an unlikely alliance with Jeriba Shigan [Louis Gossett Jr.], a Drac pilot who crashed nearby; in order to survive. ENEMY MINE is a complex tapestry of heart-warming double-you-tee-eff. Willis E. Davidge, the human fighter pilot who hates Dracs and Lou Gosset Jr. plays the Drac fighter pilot Jeriba Shigan also hates the humans. Together they teach us to live, love, and laugh on a united front.

Based on an award winning novella by Barry B. Longyear and set in the late twenty-first century, and the ENEMY MINE stars Dennis Quaid and Louis Gosset, Jr., and here we find Dennis Quaid plays Willis E. Davidge, an American soldier serving with the Bilateral Terran  Alliance (aka United Earth) while Louis Gosset, Jr. plays Jeriba Shigan, who is a Drac a race of alien humanoids with reptilian skin.

After a serious and dramatic dogfight in outer space, these two sworn enemies both crash-land and find themselves marooned on a planet named Fyrine IV, an alien world uninhabited by intelligent life, with two moons, a breathable atmosphere, water, native fauna, and a hostile environment, where meteors shower down ferociously at random intervals and where some repulsive looking carnivorous creatures emerge from a quicksand pit whenever a potential meal passes by and including at one point, Willis E. Davidge, before he is saved by the Drac who he later nicknames Jerry.

Willis E. Davidge ultimately has to really admit to owing a debt of gratitude to Jerry, as when hed first discovered that he had company on Fyrine IV, where Willis E. Davidge immediately attempted to kill the Drac. Tensions persist between the pair, though they are eventually forced to bond together to improve their chances of survival. Inevitably I was reminded of a similar sci-fi film featuring two unlikely friends in the outer space film, Robinson Crusoe on Mars, which as you know I reviewed the Eureka Blu-ray release awhile back.

Of course at the time of filming and that moment in history when there was the aggressive struggle between the USA and USSR was escalating dramatically, with both Governments becoming increasingly militaristic, the screenplay with its obvious message of its ultimate tolerance for others is certainly well-intentioned and anything that could possibly help decrease the hysterical hatred between both superpowers was surely a good thing.

In Hollywood terms, though, the plot of ENEMY MINE could be judged as slightly nave in context. Cinema-going masses in the United States might just have been willing to consider its message but not when the Dracs were depicted as more likeable aliens, less warlike and more sympathetic all round than the Irkmaans (aka humans), who all seem somehow to be American, which of course was a typical scenario of that period in the 1980s. In fact, we later discover that Alliance soldiers have a policy of kidnapping Dracs and forcing them to mine some unspecified ores under the threat of a whipping from some intergalactic belligerent redneck types.

The main reason why this big budget sci-fi film failed at the box-office, despite the final act in the film was a big problem, despite the good work laid down that was spoiled by Willis Davidge embarking on a far-fetched rescue mission that resembled the James Bond film Moonraker rather than the kind of thoughtful climax that we all hoped for. But despite this ENEMY MINE, I think this sci-fi film still has a place in your Blu-ray Collection. The special effects in 1985 looked very impressive when it was first screened in the cinema, and in the world of todays CGI summer blockbusters, this Eureka Blu-ray disc still looks pretty terrific. The Drac make-up is equally impressive and the acting is even better with Louis Gossett, Jr. in particularly outstanding form. On top of all that with the clever twist at the end of the film that I didn't remotely see coming and, despite the underwhelming popcorn ending, I would still class ENEMY MINE as one of the most under-rated sci-fi films of its era and would recommend any fully fledged sci-fi fans to view this Blu-ray disc. What makes the film work so well is the growing friendship and understanding between Willis Davidge [Dennis Quaid] and Jerry [Louis Gossett Jr.]. The greater part of the sci-fi film has only these two on the screen most of the time and the two actors build up a real sense of a growing deep relationship and of course their ultimate friendship.

ENEMY MINE is a film that explores the ability for differences to be made similar and it is a film that explores how two different cultures, ethnic groups or religious practices can find a common ground that would not primarily be considered sci-fi cinema genre. With ENEMY MINE it led to a film that reminds us of the brilliance of other sci-fi films that had ground breaking situations that covered all aspects of compassionate ways with strangers in a strange land idea. Here we have the idea of difference and similarity and the exploration of diversity and unity.

Visually the film is astonishing, because it makes use of a place that feels totally harsh and hostile, so making it look so real and so much a part of the relationship between the two characters, the place, and the performance. Dennis Quaid plays the role of Willis E. Davidge with intelligence and range which often he is not credited with and gives us a balance and insight into a world that is visually. The other actor Louis Gossett Jr. has a far harder task and does it so well as to be totally amazing in giving us a stunning layering aspect of an enemy come friend and his use of vocal punch and physical stance to give this film that slightly different edge to other types of sci-fi film genres. One thing is for sure, near the end of the film I know for sure that you will want to grab some Kleenex tissues, as you will have a few tears because of the emotional scenes you get to witness. What is also good are the special effects which were at the time in 1985 were totally ground-breaking for audiences, compared to what we see today with sci-fi films and with the stunning 2.35:1 Panavision aspect ratio, and looks totally brilliant to me and I have no complaints, but of course you will always get people who just want a good moan that it looks old fashioned, well when you see the original Star Wars film today, the special effects were on par with the film ENEMY MINE.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Eureka Entertainment Ltd has once again done a superb job in giving this film a stunning 1080p image transfer that is also enhanced with an equally impressive 2.35:1 aspect ratio widescreen presentation and giving us this Blu-ray release is again another gorgeous transfer that picks out the best detail in showing off of the alien landscape in all its glory and giving us the best Blu-ray presentation, ensuring us in giving us a print that is very clean and stable, without any Digital Noise Reduction, so giving the image with a definite proper filmic look, that also gives a strong and consistent colours in great detail, bringing the films lavish set and production design in giving us a brilliant presentation. The 1985 ENEMY MINE film looks very reminiscent to the other sci-fi genre film Robinson Crusoe on Mars, which of course is another Eureka Entertainment Ltd Blu-ray release and I get the feeling that 20th Century Fox were deliberate with this presentation choice, even though the film had its issues with the budget restriction, which you can read all about with the enclosed Beautiful Printed Collectors Booklet. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Eureka Entertainment Ltd presents us with several stunning audio experience, with a choice audio presentations, which includes 5.0 DTS-HD Master Audio, 2.0 LPCM Stereo Audio and Music/Effects: 2.0 LPCM Stereo Audio. Way back in 1985 when the film was first shown in the cinemas, this would have been a stereo production, so with this UK Blu-ray release we have had a remastered 5.0 DTS-HD Master Audio re-mix, so giving the film a little more enjoyable sound experience, but without too many discrete surround extravagances. The dialogue with the actors is clear throughout the film, and once again, its only the occasional overuse of electronic music that sadly dates the sci-fi film, otherwise the music score by the brilliant composer Maurice Jarre is mostly an orchestral presentation, but still an enjoyable listening experience and at time you get some orchestration that reminds you of the film Lawrence of Arabia, which of course as you know Maurice Jarre was also the composer for that ground breaking film.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Gorgeous 1080p High Definition presentation of the film on Blu-ray

Optional English subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing

Theatrical Trailer [1985] [1080i] [2.35:1] [1:59] This is the Original U.S. Theatrical Trailer for the film ENEMY MINE, which is a really good presentation and gives you an incentive to view the film as the trailer packs in quite a lot of visual excitement.

Special Feature: Deleted Scene: Extended Scene [1985] [480i] [1.37:1] [3:07] Here we find Davidge waking up and wanting to get back to his planet where he was marooned, but I am slightly confused why they added this in as an extra, as it is basically the same scenes as what you view in the film, but with one exception of the extra scene in the restaurant. This is in German with English subtitles.

Special Feature: Music and Effects Track: Here we get presented the film with just the Music and Effects in 2.0 LPCM Stereo Audio.

PLUS: Brilliant Double Side Printer Blu-ray Cover with alternate artwork.

BONUS: Beautiful Printed 20 page Collectors Booklet that contains CAST AND CREW; HOSTILE PLANETS: A HISTORY OF ENEMY MINE by Craig Ian Mann [2016]; LEARN TO SPEAK DRAC; DRAC FACTS; TRIVIA; VIEWING NOTES; SPECIAL NOTE: ENEMY MINE and BLU-RAY CREDITS.

Finally, ENEMY MINE [1985] is not in the same league as the great science-fiction pictures of the 1980s. ENEMY MINE doesnt deserve to be consigned to the bottom of the heap either. Because we had an early exercise in fantastical storytelling from director Wolfgang Petersen, who crafts a solid and engaging character driven story from the script, and delivers two committed performances from Dennis Quaid and in particular an unrecognisable Louis Gossett Jr. which nicely delves into the underlying themes about a shared brotherhood of basic humanity, when people are forced to survive; while the film loses its way in the final third, giving into narrative clich and B-movie spectacle, its a perfectly good sci-fi ride for most of the running time, so please give it a fighting chance. Highly Recommended!

277779,5,6300248100,"Finally, Enemy Mine on Blu Ray! This is a Sci-fi classic, not to mention one of Dennis Quaid's best performances on film. Therefore, I never understood why it was not transferred to Blu ray sooner. Lesser, unknown movies have been given the Blu ray treatment ages ago so it made no sense whatsoever. Being an American movie, I'd thought it be ported by a U.S. distributor but it's not the case here. It's on Blu ray from Umbrella Entertainment who is a distributor from Australia. Luckily, it's region B and A1, so it plays on U.S. blu ray players. I can confirm this as I have purchased it and played it on my U.S. Sony Blu ray player. The transfer itself is great and worth upgrading from DVD. Color is good, blacks are deep, and detail is pretty sharp. Some outside daytime shots look a little soft, but I think it has to do more with the way the movie was shot as it uses many foggy and snowy scenes for the exteriors. The print is 99% scratch/artifact free too. There's like a scene or two where you see a tiny spec, but it's pretty much pristine throughout. Extras include the trailer and a photo gallery with movie trivia. If you're a U.S. fan on the fence about buying this Blu ray because it's an import, buy it. It's as good as it's gonna get till an American distributor wisens up and does a local port.",1484092800,17,1314,4.345528455284553

277834,5,6300248100,"My review is mainly based on the content of the movie itself.  I had the DVD movie and then purchased the Blu-Ray version, hoping for Spectacular Results.  NOT-So.  Very little difference.  I read a reviewer that stated the UK version was great and to purchase that.  Sadly, I don't have that issue.  Still, I'm giving this 5 stars, because it's one of my favorite Sci-Fi's and I Love Science Fiction.  Here's my take on the movie:

WARNING:  SPOILER ALERT!!
Outstanding Sci-Fi Production.  What starts out as two Alien Enemies, becomes a fascinating and close bond between two friends.  One alien is Human & the other is a Unisexual Being, being both male & female sexes.  When the alien dies, before giving birth to it's offspring, his human friend is left to raise this foreign alien child.  The birth of the child and death of his friend is a real Tear-Jerker.  The human, ""Uncle"" has no idea how to proceed with raising his friend's child.  He never fails to remind the child of his, ""Parent"" and how great a person he was and that he was his friend.  The child is warned of not ever going near a mining camp run by  off-world ""Humans"" because of the dangers  He thinks it must be safe, because ""Uncle"" is human.  His curiosity gets the better of him and he disobeys Uncle to get a closer look at the camp.  He's captured.  They're astonished that this savage alien is capable of speaking English.  They have slave labor of his race, but none has that capacity.  Once captured, he teaches English to other slaves and tells them about his Human Uncle.  From there on, the story continues, as Uncle tries to locate the alien child and rescue him.  I Highly Recommend.  I've watched Thousands of movies and I don't watch many more than once or twice, at the most.  I've watched this several times.  The acting is good, the casting is great and the story is memorable.  WATCH IT.",1483401600,,1880,4.544910179640719

277837,4,6300248100,"I really wanted to love this more than I did. I know...*bows head in shame*...It's a classic and the tech was limited for its day, a fact that I have always been open minded to with other films (Dedicated classic viewer of Doctor Who and Original Star Trek). However, the sets were phony (?) and the acting felt too...hoaky (?) to be taken seriously. I'm struggling with the words, so forgive my rambling...

I wanted to take this seriously because the story was THAT good! Such a good story! I can't say that enough. The story was ASTOUNDING and the story is why I rated this a solid 4. Had the story been terrible or weak, I would have rated this a 2. I am dying for an updated remake as this one felt rushed. Maybe that's it. The story was rushed. This was clearly a 3 1/2...4 hour story crammed into 90 minutes. If done right (with JJ Abrams, Lucas, or Spielberg), this could easily be a 3 1/2 hour epic science fiction film on par with Planet of the Apes (Original). *sigh* I wish Heston had done the role...Such potential for a great epic and it just...came off as Jim Henson instead. Still good. Still a great story, but this film fell short of its potential.",1482796800,2,1166,4.348623853211009

Despite some hokey effects the storyline is good, tugs at your heart despite some pretty awful banter, and in the end is some time well spent if you want to get away from it all. It's not Star Wars or Rogue One by any means, and it won't win the hearts of those who hate 80's movies per se, but I really enjoyed it and if you like a simple story with a good moral to it, this might work if you're bored on a Saturday afternoon like I was.

The two combatants are from different worlds and cultures at war who must overcome their long-held prejudices.  Enemy Mine comes across more like a pilot for a TV series than an actual movie with themes about trust, faith, honor and other family values dressed up in modest budget Sci-Fi garments.  Low-key and understated, Enemy Mine does boast some good performances by both Louis Gossett, Jr. and Dennis Quaid, earning the film its 3 stars.

278088,1,6300248100,"I recently 'attempted' to watch this film for the first time ever only last night...but only got about 2/3 the way through the movie before I could bear no more. The movie started out (the first 10 minutes) looking very unique and awesome -with pretty good visual effects and space ship designs and battle sequences. Once the character played by Dennis Quaid crash-landed his ship, the movie went all downhill very very quickly from there.

The planetary scenes looked very sub-par (somewhat fake) and the entire rest of the movie had a complete B-movie feel -for the worse. The dialog and so-called 'acting' -especially by Quaid- was juvenile, atrocious and extremely intolerable. Remember when sci-fi movies actually had INTELLIGENT dialog that CORROBORATED with what should be an 'advanced' and 'intelligent' genre of movies (that being ""sci-fi"") -esp. the '60s (i.e.. 2001: A Space Oddyssey). Now you have the '80s and uber-uber terrible actors such as Charlie Sheen, Dennis Quaid, and about all others who have emerged since then -who have no charisma, intelligence, or likability and not surprisingly the dialog they use is replete with profanity and unintelligence and selfishness and juvenility: Dennis Quaid's attitude was terrible, pathetic, juvenile and reprehensible. Imagine a Gregory Peck 'trying' to act a hundredth as juvenile or profane as a typical '80s new generation actor. He would seem so pathetic and unnatural because he -like MOST actors USED to be- is a million times more mature and intelligent than nearly all new generation actors.

The '80s to the present date is a microcosm of society: A constant 'DE'-evolution in every conceivable way which manifests not only in movies but ALL other facets of society as well...

I had forgotten in the intervening years how low-budget it was, though.  I'm surprised ILM put their name on the effects, but if you're expecting Star Wars, you will be disappointed.  Think more along the lines of Flash Gordonthe serial, not the movie with the Queen soundtrack. The ships in space look like they should have wires.  The sound effects are cheesy and unrealistic (and the sound editing is just plain bad, making some parts muddy and overly layered), and the music is forgettable.  As alien worlds go, this one screams ""sound stage.""  Don't see it for the effects.

278299,5,6300248100,Enemy Mine is a very interesting movie.  The whole movie basically comes down to what we can learn about ourselves as human beings.  Overcoming prejudice and finding true friendship where it is least expected.  No point summarizing the movie several people have done that already.  I will just say the movie is very good and thought provoking.  I saw this movie many times as a kid and then quiet a few times as an adult.  The acting by Dennis Quid and Louis Gossett Jr. is excellent throughout the movie.  I liked the overall environment and theme of the world.  It definitely had a different tone which made it seem much different than Earth.  Several scenes such as the meteor showers were pretty cool.  I thought the big revolving space station at the beginning of the film looked great and was really believable.  I also liked how director Wolfgang Peterson does not give us a lot of details how the war between the humans and the dracs started but picks up the story in the middle of the conflict.  The movie is pretty smart and you can tell how Davidge is disgusted by the slave labor miners who seem have even less humanity than the Dracs.  You see Davidge change over the course of the film and it is enjoyable to watch.  The movie is not for everyone and at times is slow paced but overall I think the movie is great.  I wish half the films I have seen would have half the heart of this movie.  5 Stars excellent film IMO.,1453075200,,1432,4.408396946564886

This movie is absolutely one of my favorites. The first time I saw this was on TV when I was younger and it was excellent. The film came out in 1985 and was not considered a success at the box office but I still loved it when I had the chance to see it. A sci-fi movie set on another planet is all I need to enjoy something usually. From the look of the sets to the look of the aliens I thought it was great, not to mention I thought the acting was great.

The movie revolves two warring pilots that crash land on the same planet. At first they are trying to kill each other of course. But as the planets harsh lands, and animals start present a problem they have to come together, at least for the time being. So as the time passes the two must form an uneasy alliance until someones people comes to rescue them. The thing is as members of opposite sides of a war how can they work together, find a way to make it work and form some kind of friendship.

This is a very entertaining film that has action and drama mixed well with some humor thrown in for good measure. The story is excellent and plays to human emotion very well even though one is an alien, see what I did there? I think Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett Jr. both did an excellent job with this film. They way they play off of each other are excellent as you can feel each emotion that they go through with each other. From bitter enemies to an uneasy trust to pure friendship these two did a wonderful job.

The film is based on a book by Barry Longyear and was written for the screen by Ed Khmara who also wrote Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story. I have to mention here that the title of the film means my enemy but the studio thought people wouldnt get it so they added the mine ending, or at least that is what I have heard. The film was directed by Wolfgang Petersen who also directed one of my other all time favorites, The Neverending Story. You may also know him for Das Boot, In the Line of Fire, Air Force One, Shattered, Outbreak, The Perfect Storm, Troy and the remake of Poseidon. I thought he did an excellent job here as well since I have enjoyed everyone of his films, some more than others of course. I really wish he would make more films.

I love the look of this film from the sets to the makeup and special effects. I honestly prefer this kind of film to ones with all that CGI. Practical effects and looks always seem to have been more fun for me, I love the sets here compared to the CG green scene look of other films. Over all this is a really fun film with some heart set in the sci-fi world, which is something I love. I really wish we could have got a commentary for this flick, that would have been great.",1431043200,,2704,4.113636363636363

The clarity and detail in the picture quality is outstanding; there are small details in the picture I'd never really noticed when viewing VHS and DVD editions over the years. The sound quality is excellent, though I have not yet utilized the Isolated Soundtrack Feature. The sound and picture quality are good enough for me  to give this release four stars. I won't give it five due to its sparse special features (no commentary, no behind the scenes, no retrospective features, etc.) as well as its steep asking price. The Twilight Time Releases seem to cater only to existing fans of their film releases, and their premium pricing would probably scare off a more casual potential customer.",1422576000,2,868,4.748344370860927

The movie is funny, action packed, frustrating, sad, and moving. When I was younger, it taught me that even enemies can become friends given enough time and the need to reach common goals. It's a wonderful movie. When I saw it on sale at Target, I snatched it up and did an internal happy dance. Now as an adult, I still love it. I laughed and cried as though it was my first time watching the movie. I think the best feature of this film is that it demonstrates that you don't need a lot of special effects and elaborate sets to make a great movie. If the story is good and the actors are well versed in  their craft then you've got a hit. I wish modern day filmmakers would take this into consideration.

The hep, pregnant, male Reptilian dude.  BUTt they never Really took this issue on and embraced it: Just danced around it. I'm a psychotherapist, and open to various relationships, i.e. No Homophob here.... Just thought that it was handled poorly/ Awkwardly. In any event, I thought that they could have been at least been Moderately more straightforward re: what their intended implications were regarding the ""Relationship"", because the way that they left it, seemed to be just..... silly (There that word again. I'm actually fairly verbal, but it's just the one word that keeps returning). . Beyond that? Poor acting (By the way: I Really have always liked Quaid, which is actually what pushed me into trying the movie in the first place). He does have a history of choosing challenging, strange parts that test the limits, and typically handles them well. But I think that he just went a bit too far on what I now view to be a very crudely put together movie.

Let's just say that as soon as the opening sequence started playing, I was immediately glad that I had made the purchase. I was impressed, as this is one of the better Bluray conversions that I've seen.

And since they are fighting over turf, they don't bother to get to know anything about one another other than fighting.

But then human Willis Davidge (Dennis Quaid) and drack ""Jerry Sheegan"" (Louis Gossett, Jr.) are stranded on a very inhospitable planet together. To survive, they need to learn something of one another's languages and lives. This much is sufficiently predictable that it was even included in the trailer.

There are some dangerous animals on the planet, as well has incredible meteor showers that are sort of like bombs (pay no attention to any logically absurd elements, and to the obvious line between mask and mouth on Louis Gossett), but they survive. They not only learn one another's language, but Jerry teaches Davidge something of his religion, including giving him a miniature of their holy book.

There is one other major danger. A ship of scavengers (human, more or less) shows up and apparently left before they knew Davidge and Jerry were there. They are obviously bad guys, because they left litter laying around, and because they use dracks for slaves. Davidge reminds himself that they are tolerated by the space authority for that reason.

Did I mention that dracks are androgynous and apparently self-fertilizing? Well, again somewhat predictably, Jerry dies giving birth to his/her son/daughter, and extracts a promise from Davidge that he will take the child to Drackon so that he can be formally registered in his lineage. The baby is cute, which is natural, and Davidge raises it to call him Uncle. By this time it should be obvious that these two will bring about peace between the two races. But there's a good bit of action and adventure before that point, so enjoy. It may be a bit corny, but it is entertaining.",1336780800,,2064,4.835694050991502

279278,5,6300248100,"When this film first came out in 1985, it had only been two years since the Israeli attack on Lebanon in 1982 and the Sabra and Chatilla Massacres there.  So I found myself projecting mid-Eastern politics into the story.  I have no idea if this was the intent of the writer or the producer, but the scenes of the mining camp where Davidge first sees how Humans are mistreating the reptilian race called Dracs -- and understands that Earth is not so righteous in her attempts to colonize an already-inhabited part of space -- really hit home for me at that time.  Having just viewed this film again last night, I can still see the mid-East parallels, as well as a more general story about building intercultural bridges and turning enemies into friends.

The film itself is fantastic in terms of acting.  It doesn't have high-tech special effects (the opening scenes are analog and rather dated) but it doesn't really need them.  As other reviewers here have noted, this could easily be performed as a stage play, because its mostly a drama between the two main characters.  The depth and growth of these characters -- and the way the actors have played them -- is still very timely, making this, in my opinion, one of the best of science fiction films of all time.

The film opens with space battles between two sworn enemies, Humans and Dracs, who have been at war for a long time but neither really knows much about the other.  Then a soldier from each side crashes on a hostile planet -- where they must now cooperate in order to survive.  Davidge the human and Jerry the Drac (a nickname, since Davidge can't pronounce the full Drac name) eventually learn each other's languages and develop genuine respect.  Davidge, who had never before even seen a Drac,  learns that they have a deep spirituality and a very sophisticated culture.  Hec also learns that the areas of space Earth has been colonizing (and assuming to be empty, unclaimed territory) have actually been part of the Drac empire for centuries.  So the Dracs see Earth as the invaders -- a perspective Davidge had not considered before.

Dracs are hermaphroditic, and Jerry becomes pregnant, explaining that ""with Humans it is a choice, but with Dracs it just happens.""  Jerry is looking forward to having a child, but the birth goes wrong and Jerry dies in childbirth.  Now it's up to Davidge to raise a Drac child -- which he does, forming a genuine bond of love with this little alien being.  So when the Drac child is captured and enslaved by the Human miners - -well, any more would be a spoiler.  Watch it for yourself.",1299542400,,2591,4.642543859649122

279332,4,6300248100,"1985 might as well have been an eternity ago to today's filmgoer who has become dependent upon heavily computer-generated imagery, fast cuts, and inconceivable perspectives.  Enemy Mine could very easily be considered the opposite of these trends in every possible arena.  Pacing is methodic, visual effects are all practical, and fairly restrictive sets force the viewer into appreciating the writing through dialog exchange.

The premise, based on the 1979 short story of the same title by Barry B. Longyear, takes place in the late 21st century, amidst an ongoing interstellar war between human beings (Bilateral Terran Alliance, or BTA as its referred) and the Dracs (a mysterious reptilian race). Human pilot Willis E. Davidge (Dennis Quaid) and Drac Jeriba ""Jerry"" Shigan (Louis Gossett, Jr.) engage in a spacecraft skirmish, which results in them both crash-landing on a hostile moon known as Fyrine IV.

The core of the tale works of the idea of members of opposing armed forces discovering that they have more in common than they do discrepancies.  After initial residual hostilities, the two pilots eventually come to terms with the idea that cooperation is essential to survive the harsh environment.  The story spans years, whereby the two lead characters learn to overcome their differences, become friends, and eventually share each other's languages and cultures.

Honestly, this is science fiction in the purest sense of the classification and despite a look, feel, and tones that never stray far from that fact, I can state with certainty that this film would likely appeal to anyone who appreciates good storytelling.  The metaphor of enemies with no vendetta against each other aside from what their respective government's assign them is of course easily transferable to our world.  The alien costumes and unearthly environment simply act to enhance the universally relatable prose.  Additionally, themes of love transcending gender, race and even species are not only present here, but serve as the catalyst upon which the whole story is built.

Additionally, especially noteworthy is Louis Gossett, Jr.'s spectacular performance as the Drac.  Say what you will about the charms of CG but Enemy Mine harkens back to a time when latex, rubber, and body paint were the means of creating something otherworldly for the screen.  Not only is Gossett's performance spectacular but the simple fact that his presence opposite Dennis Quaid throughout production seems to have elevated Quaid's performance in terms of believability as well.

In all, Enemy Mine was most certainly lost to the wake left by science fiction giants Star Wars and Star Trek of the early 1980s during its original theatrical debut and while still readily available on the home market (in fact even as an affordable DVD double-pack with fellow 20th Century Fox 1980's science fiction film, Alien Nation), is sadly largely overlooked.  In my opinion Enemy Mine serves a timeless reminder of an era where storytelling took precedence over flashy visuals and the appeal of science fiction was strongly interlaced with what it means to be human.",1276128000,5,3128,5.253012048192771

Since then, every time I saw it on cable, I would change the channel shortly thereafter. I used to wonder why it seem to have always pop up every now and again either in name or display. After watching it tonight, I discovered why.

It is a great film.

When I first saw it, I could not appreciate what makes this film so great, a story of loyalty, friendship, and good characters. This film is not your high speed  space chase with with lasers blasting all over the screen and I think this is why I never gave the film a chance initially but I am glad I did tonight.

279339,4,6300248100,"""Enemy Mine"" is an unusual kind of film. If you walk in on someone watching it, it just looks kind of corny, and in some ways it is. In some ways it is kind of a sci-fi ""dances With Wolves"" (but thankfully not so long) where the protagonist soldier goes ""Native"" when deprived of the company of his own kind.

And while I don't want to read too much into this story, it does have a lot of food for thought, from how differences can seem much bigger than they are if reasonable people take the time to (pardon the metaphor) ""walk a mile in the other persons moccasins"", to what it means to be human. One of my favorite Authors, Orson Scott Card, has posited in one of his stories that it is impossible to really, truly know someone without loving something about them. I know, I know there are a million examples you can counter with, but it is food for thought.

Believe it or not, I used to tell a part of this story when teaching several classes on marriage relations. A weird part in this story is that the ""Draconians"" were asexual and ""Gerry"" the Draconian gives birth, he explains to the Human the reason why humans are so lonely is that they divided into two sexes. I used this as a metaphor to explain the ""they shall no more be twain, but one flesh"" scripture. I'm sure some may have had an issue with it, but it makes sense to me.

So here's the deal, this isn't the best sci-fi movie you'll ever watch, but it is one I really like, and you might too.

279371,2,6300248100,"This 1985 sci-fi film combines the plot of Robinson Crusoe with TV's Odd Couple and the Star Trek episode ""Arena""( #19). The story takes place during the late 21st century when there's an interstellar war between humans and Dracs (reptilian humanoids). After a space dogfight, a human (Dennis Quaid) and a Drac (Louis Gossett Jr.) crashland on a barren alien planet. Quaid's intentions are originally hostile toward the reptile man but a friendship slowly develops as they work together to survive.

I read some good reviews about this film, some even giving it a stellar 5-Star rating, so I thought I'd better check it out. Well, I was quite a bit let down. Don't get me wrong, it's an okay sci-fi film and the message is a good one, but it's certainly not a 5-Star classic (or even 4-Star).

What piqued my interest was that it was described as a ""character study"" more so than a juvenile space dogfight flick. Yeah, there's a little character study but it's nothing deep. You'd do better to watch practically any of the original Star Trek episodes as far as that goes. Take for instance the episode ""Arena"" (which the movie heavily borrows from) where Capt. Kirk is stuck on a deserted planet with a reptilian alien called a Gorn. Kirk doesn't develop a friendship with the Gorn but he does refuse to kill him at the end, which opens the door for warmer relations down the road. This episode is better than ""Enemy Mine"" on practically every level with the exception of F/X, which are a bit better in the film, comparable to the F/X in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and Star Trek III: The Search for Spock.

The so-called character study in ""Enemy Mine"" is on the level of TV's Odd Couple, with Quaid in the Oscar role and Gossett in the Felix role. Too cute.

In addition, there are numerous awkard moments in the filmmaking, plus a character dies prematurely (so much for the character study) and then there's a cringe-inducing pregnency/birth sequence, believe it or not.

They try to beef-up the sci-fi at the end but it fails to create much suspense. The story simply isn't very captivating.

BOTTOM LINE: This is an okay mid-80s sci-fi flick, nothing more. It's too derivative, too light, too awkward, too saccharine and not very compelling. The message of the film is good but that itself can't turn something mediocre into something good or great.

Most fans of this film are likely people who originally saw it as kids and now view it with nostalgia-tinged glasses.

279375,5,6300248100,"Being in a mood for science fiction, I settled in to watch Enemy Mine as it opened with a good old-fashioned space battle, never imagining I would be moved to tears more than once before this most unexpectedly heart-touching film came to an end.  I don't think I've shed a science-fiction related tear since E.T., but Enemy Mine is just an indescribably beautiful and moving film.  Heck, I think I even like Dennis Quaid now, but Lou Gossett, Jr., turned in an even more remarkable performance than Quaid.  The man should have been nominated for an Oscar, in my opinion.

As I alluded to already, this futuristic film opens in a time of war.  Humans may have achieved peace on earth by 2092, but their competition with the reptilian Drac race over colonization of a certain galaxy has erupted into full-scale interstellar war.  Willis Davidge (Dennis Quaid) is a human fighter pilot who ends up crash landing on an alien planet - as does the Drac fighter he was determined to shoot down.  Relatively uninjured by the crash, Davidge heads off toward the smoke of the alien vessel's wreckage; he is sure that the enemy's ejection pod must have landed somewhere nearby.  His attempt to kill the Drac goes awry, however, resulting in his capture.  The harsh circumstances of life on the barren world somehow conspire to keep these two mortal enemies from killing one another, and their relationship of captor and slave gradually grows into a bond of mutual cooperation and ultimately a deep and abiding friendship.  Luckily for us, Jeriba ""Jerry"" Shigan (Louis Gossett, Jr.) learns English much more quickly than Davidge learns Drac.  Mutual understanding actually leads to more enmity between them at times, particularly when it comes to laying the blame for the current war between their races, and Davidge actually goes off on his own looking for help at one point - but their bond of friendship, as unlikely a thing as could ever be, proves to be larger than the both of them.

Unfortunately, I can't risk revealing any more of the plot, which makes it impossible for me to talk about the truly special and heart-warming strengths of this amazing film's plot.  The story's not entirely unpredictable, but that doesn't make it any less powerful.  Above all else, this is an exceedingly human story, replete with more than enough triumph and tragedy to pull at the old heart-strings quite strongly.  It's all about one's perspective and how it could change.  Any other place but here, on this harsh and dangerous alien world, Davidge and Jerry would be the most bitter of enemies, yet each of them come to know the worth and nobility of not only each other but each other's cultures.  And, before all is said and done, one of them is forced to recognize the evil segment that exists within his own culture - and to take action against it.

The true purpose of science fiction is not to merely entertain us; it is, as far as I'm concerned, to further elucidate the underlying humanity of mankind and the place of the individual in an infinite universe that begs the question of his very existence - in other words, why are we here and just who the heck are we, anyway?  Enemy Mine fulfills this purpose in spades.  It will make you laugh, it will very likely make more than a few of you cry, and it will draw you in like few other films in this or any other genre - and, ultimately, it will compel you to look at yourself and your worldview in a new, perhaps even more enlightened way.  This is truly one of the greatest science fiction films ever made.  I didn't know whether to cry or stand up and cheer at the very end - actually, I wanted to do both at the same time.",1223424000,6,3668,4.610769230769231

279379,5,6300248100,"As the movie opens the viewer is confronted by two very surprising things. The first is the name of the director, Wolfgang Peterson. It would be the German Director's first movie for the American mainstream audience and undoubtedly his best to date. The second thing is the gross inclusion of gratuitous Analog Special effects, which might make this movie one of the last films to include effects on this level. Blade Runner strictly used Analog Special Effects, but did far greater things with them. These two things, viewed in today's world, might turn off a few viewers, but the best thing I can offer up: is to stick with it.

However, both those things aside, the film, very rightly and very appropriately, gets to the story quickly and it is the story that makes this one of the best science-fiction movies of the `80's decade.

Enemy Mine is an incredibly touching film about perceived differences between two warring species, but speaks to the larger issue of race and all people. That's a pretty hefty order for sure to address successfully in film, but the story hails from a period of writing where moralist intent seeped into most writing, deftly, and was the norm. Barry Longyear stands firmly beside such Science-Fiction greats as Philip K. Dick, Gene Rodenberry and Walter Tevis.

I have fond memories of watching this film as a boy and can hardly forget Louis Gossett Jnr.'s much quotable: ""Daaahweeech."" The final scene is also very moving and very thought provoking for anyone who wonders why we, as a people, do not go to greater lengths in establishing our lineage.

279441,5,6300248100,"No massive space battles or laser gunplay, though you do get a dose of each of those things. What you have is a purely character driven story that works to what I would call epic proportions. This is a must see for any science fiction fan.

The beauty about Enemy Mine is it cuts into one of the most classic themes in your standard sci-fi genre, which is being at war with an alien race. Instead of focusing on the war itself the focus is on two people on opposite sides of it. Most of the time in war movies of any kind you never really get to know the enemy. This movie changes that and does tells it in such a way where you completely forget the original conflict. Interesting enough the character interaction regarding their war only further serves to humanize them as you don't really know who's race is at fault and it seems these wayward soldiers don't know either. The story even transcends that relationship on the second half of the movie. It's almost like two stories in one.

You can't pull this kind of storytelling off without some amazing talent. Dennis Quaid brings forth a stellar performance as the stubborn human who learns and evolves as a person. Louis Gossett Jr. will blow you away on how well he can act inside an alien costume and mask. His body movements, eye movements, way of speaking, it all culminates in what I would call the best alien acting of all time. The chemistry between Quaid and Gossett really make the movie.

Special effects are good for the year the movie was made. There are some really neat looking Earth fighters and space station that combine that sweet classic 50's rocket ship style with a little bit of 80's starfighter on top of it. The model work does seem obvious, but it just fits so well with the overall look of the movie I actually find myself preferring it that way. The planet sets and landscapes are as gorgeous as they are barren looking. You won't find any bad settings here.

I wish this movie would get a nice DVD treatment and I've been waiting on that for a while now. Or better yet a good Blu-Ray transfer. This DVD has nothing to speak of regarding special features or extras at all. Here's hoping a future release will have at least a commentary or something.

Enemy Mine goes beyond what science fiction movies normally did in 80's era or any post Star Wars era sci-fi. There's enough action to keep it from being called a drama, but it's best to think of it as a grand adventure film. It puts you very much in touch with the characters and doesn't let go. This movie should be considered required viewing for all self-respecting fans of this genre.",1204070400,3,2621,4.463465553235908

279446,4,6300248100,"I hate being nostalgic about movies, but I do remember a time when imagination was evident in every part of a production, when film posters were dynamic, visceral and iconic, when films looked like they were shot on film and not an HD camera with a sunset tint, when scores were done by orchestras instead of synthesizers and death metal guitars and, most important of all, when the lack of CGI technology forced the filmmakers into achieving visual effects through more practical means. The 1980s were filled with such movies and, looking back, I am glad that I grew up in that decade. Children now are exposed to altogether soulless movies.

Set in the late 21st Century, Enemy Mine has humans reaching out into the depths of space after achieving world peace. But a rival species, the alien race of the Drax, don't take to kindly to humans poking about the galaxy and an interstellar war kicks off. A human pilot (Dennis Quaid) and a lone Drac (Louis Gossett Jnr.) crash land on a remote desert planet and learn, the hard way, to stick together if they want to survive. Despite their ultimate conflict they discover that they are not all that different from each other and neither yet both are to blame for the war.

Enemy Mine suffered from severe problems during production. Apparently the original director, Richard Longcraine (Wimbledon, Richard III), shot the entire film on location in Iceland before being replaced by Wolfgang Petersen who re-shot the whole film all over again but changed the story somewhat in the process. So, in reality, there are two completely different versions of Enemy Mine. One which was released into cinemas that has become a classic in its own right and another that only exists in the vaults of Twentieth Century Fox. I would love to see this alternate cut.

The fantastic photography and production design look very, very good for a film from 1985. Some of the effect shots and matte paintings are simply gorgeous and the cutting between desert locations and desert sets is almost seamless. This isn't like an episode of the original Star Trek series in which the cast simply take a half hour drive to a bit of desert outside of LA, the desert locations with the matte painting backgrounds look utterly authentic.

If you like the look and feel of films like The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth then you'll appreciate the fantasy of Enemy Mine. I know I am going to sound like an old coot but they just don't make films like this anymore. Everything these days seems to be geared towards the average ASBO teenage boy. In ten years time I honestly think that films will be no more than a test card that offends and stimulates no one.

I will consider myself lucky that films like this were once made and that they were a part of my formative years.

This movie is a lot like a long ball hitter - the director tries to go for a home run on so many levels that you end up alternating between shaking your head at the cheesiness of it all and wiping at a tear at the way some of the scenes work so perfectly.

The premise is well known so I won't go into that. Louis Gossett, Jr. was very good throughout. Quaid alternates between over the top ridiculousness and touching. The soundtrack is too much - too sentimental, too adventurous, etc. It gets in the way more than anything else in the movie.

The special effects are sometimes great (especially Gossett's make-up) and usually bad - think Star Trek original TV series quality, but the story mostly makes up for it.

All in all, I give this movie a C+ for its up and down nature. The values and message are good, but sometimes the medium that transmits those values and that message is to sacharine for my tastes.",1167350400,2,1145,4.2626728110599075

The novella and its sequel at least give humanity the benefit of a doubt; the war is over and there is an uneasy peace and humanity, if love doesn't prevail, at least strives to be better. In the movie, they made humans brutal savages in the way they treated the Dracs. Did we learn NOTHING from the USA's foray into slavery and brutality? IT seemed that a violent ending was gratuitously grafted onto the movie to make it more palatable to the 13-18 year old testosterone crown, thereby destroying what could have been as perfect a film as the novella was perfect.

279533,4,6300248100,"Draconians and Humans are having a war over territory (what else), firmly establishing that the same sort of nonsense that has occurred in human history between various races continues in space.  The only difference is that the Draconians are actually reptilian versions of us.  This movie attempts not so subtly to compare our racism throughout history, most particularly recent history, with the racism that is expressed against the Draconians.

Draconian Jeriba ""Jerry"" Shigan (Louis Gossett, Jr.) and macho Willis Davidge (Dennis Quaid) crash land on the same planet.  Anything that happens before the crash is background and is nearly extraneous to the real story, which is how Jerry and Davidge grow to see each other as ""people,"" and actually grow to care about each other.  That is what the movie is about.  However, the focus of the movie is not so much where the movie goes as the journey.  The movie focuses a great deal of attention on the events that can draw different people together and cause them to understand each other.  With understanding can come caring.

I know the previous paragraph sounds maudlin, sort of like ""Lassie"" in space, but this movie, in spite of its lukewarm critical reception, is interesting to watch.  For years science fiction fans (as opposed to fantasy fans) have gloried in the fact that science fiction has always been able to explore topics where the main stream has difficulty.  To phrase it another way, only us geeks watch this stuff, so no one cares what is in it.  Thus this movie is able to show how two races come to a common purpose and you start to wonder whether there is any real difference between the races.

The only point I was unsure of in this movie was the birth of Zammis (Bumper Robinson).  The whole birth process and the biological explanation were somewhat interesting.  The attachment of Davidge to Zammis was expected, because biologically we are wired to protect young, regardless of the species (well, the sort of cute cuddly ones, anyway).  Of course, the birth of Zammis did help set up the expected and somehow satisfying end of the movie.

I suppose that one of the biggest criticisms of this movie is that it went for such a clich ending after the marvelous acting when Davidge and Jerry were isolated.  Louis Gossett, Jr., particularly had a difficult acting job, portraying an alien, speaking in an alien language, and expressing emotions in heavy makeup.  Louis Gossett, Jr., received a Saturn Award nomination for Best Actor, one of the six awards for which this movie was nominated.  Unfortunately, the movie did not win any of the nominations.  However, Louis Gossett, Jr., deserved to win at least one of the awards.  Watch this one and see what I mean.

At the movie's heart is the evolving friendship of Quaid and Gossett, as their enmity slowly gives way to mutual respect for each other's cultures and beliefs. It's a wondrous thing to watch. Unfortunately, the film's second half - sans Gossett - falters considerably, introducing cardboard villainy, transparent moralizing, routine action and the very painful sight of Quaid teaching Gossett's lizard son how to play football.
Quaid is at his cocky best as Davidge, a hot-shot, all-American pilot who wears his machismo on his sleeve until Gossett's spirituality brings out his true humanity. All but unrecognizable underneath Chris Walas's amazing make-up, Gossett is marvelous as the reptilian Drac character, a deeply religious male/female hybrid.

Dennis Quaid is no less phenomenal but didn't have to wear a cumbersome outfit and makeup like Mr. Gossett did.  Most notable is the fact that this film was made over 16 years ago and is still an excellent science fiction movie.  Stands the test of time.
The story is that of a pilot out in space on a space station who is helping to 'defend' the mineral rights and other human interests of this sector of the galaxy.  The only other living space-faring species out there are the Dracs.  Mr. Gosset plays a Drac known as Jareeba (or Jerry as Dennis Quaid comes to call him).  They are mortal enemies and nearly kill each other many times after each of their ships crash land on an unihabited planet that has impressive meteor showers, little food and funky weather patterns.  Eventually, through time and circumstances, these two enemies are forced to cooperate together so that they can survive and in so doing learn a little bit about each other and their respective societies.  They aren't that different, humanity and the Dracs.  An age-old story done over and over again, right?  True, but this one gives us a twist.  Jerry becomes pregnant (no he is neither female nor male.  Dracs simply become pregnant when the time is right).  But Jerry's pregnancy goes awry and he dies before giving birth.  Dennis Quaid has to cut the child out and raise it until he's rescued.  But should he be rescued by humans, what will happen to Zamis (the little Drac who grows rapidly)?  And if rescued by Dracs, what will happen to Dennis Quaid?
Dennis becomes the father figure for Zamis and they are eventually 'rescued' from the planet by human slave traders that force Dracs into mining colonies.  What happens to Zamis in the end?  What can Dennis Quaid do to help Zamis survive?  Watch the movie and learn the twist on an old theme.  Excellent.",999475200,27,2091,4.702479338842975
279659,3,6300248100,"Louis Gossett Jr. steals the show! You actually belive he is an alien. You see only his character, his facade and not the actor. The makeup helps, but there is a should behind the latex. He had the quirky head positions and fidgets that are quite iguana like, but he conveys the alieness better than Bridges in ""Starman.""
The one scene that clinches it, is after the first meteor shower, Quaid is accosted by Gossett, then starts yelling at the alien. Quaid inadvertently speaks the Dracon word for meteor, and Gossett looks up, scanning the sky for more meteors! A small detail that brought a big surprise!
Sadly, due to Hollywood and the Academy's strong bias against Sci-Fi and Fantasy, Mr. Gossett will never get the credit he deserves. The Academy occasionally crosses over for mainstream Sci-Fi as ""Star Wars,"" but the closest it ever goes is to Disney or soft-core fantasy, such as ""The Wizard of Oz.""
There are only two drawback in this film. First, the special effects are not Industrial Light and Magic. Second, the story gets a little jumbled at the end. This film might have been better as a TV mini-series--hint, hint, Sci-Fi Channel!",999129600,3,1147,4.768844221105527
279660,4,6300248100,"Enemy Mine is a great depiction of what we would do when confronted with our greatest fear/hate/loathing and forced to deal with or die.
Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett Jr. are fantastic in this film!  Quaid as the human astronaut is great, and gives a real sense of his loathing for the Drac species.  His character's growth and change in attitude is very well done and a believable performance.  Gossett is also remarkable as the Drac, and his portrayal of an asexual creature so different (and yet similar) to us is nothing short of extraordinary.  He also grows, learning to love the human Quaid as a friend/brother and giving him the ultimate gift: his child.
The special effects may not be Academy-material, but they do the job well for this film.  While this is science fiction, the story is what makes this film so great.  I don't know if it would work in any other setting/genre, but it certainly works here.  If you haven't seen this, watch it!",998524800,5,953,4.636904761904762
279661,3,6300248100,"As someone stated in another review, this movie was adapted from Barry B Longyear's novella, ""Enemy Mine"" .  If you can find this original version and read it, I HIGHLY recommend it. I first read it in Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine many years ago. It beats the movie hands-down.  Mind you, the movie wasn't bad, but the novella will have you crying at the end (even if you aren't prone to that sort of thing), and wishing they had stuck to this original story instead of 'Hollywood-izing' it for the masses.",985219200,3,511,4.604395604395604
279662,5,6300248100,"Although the story this movie comes from delves far deaper into the culture of the Dracs (which I thought was one of the best parts), the movie still gets a good piece of it on film.  This is one of the unsung heroes of REAL science fiction films and also manages to have a good helping of action. Dennis Quaid & Lou Gossett both put in great perfomances. But do yourself a favor and read the short story too.",985219200,2,409,4.177215189873418
279663,4,6300248100,"Adapted from Barry B Longyear's novella, ""Enemy Mine"" could almost be a stage play. Only two actors at a time take up the majority of screen time. The sets could be taken out of the original Lost in Space  studio lot and there's not enough action to keep most kids interested.  Despite this, the film is terrific. It's one of those rare stories that  concentrate on the subtle interaction between the characters while taking  them on a moral journey.

Have I put any of the Sci-Fi geeks off  their breakfast yet? Well okay, this is a science fiction movie. But it  didn't have to be. The story throws two indelible enemies together, on a  desolate and dangerous planet. After trying to  continue their struggle, a  truce is eventually called as they both realise cooperation is necessary  for their survival. Despite their common need, differences in culture,  politics and religion continue to wear on their partnership. And it is this  constant friction which works to build their bond, almost against their  will.

Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett Jr play the two characters  I've described. They are Davidge, (a human soldier), and Jerry, (a Draco  soldier). Their respective names are those used for convenience, given  their lack of ability in each other's language. At the start, neither  speaks anything but swearwords in the enemy's tongue. Naturally, this adds  another layer of tension to the situation.

I've always liked Denis  Quaid's acting. He is very likeable in all of his films but in Enemy Mine  we see a lot more depth of pain and caring than he usually portrays. Louis  Gosset Jr however, is the true star of the film. He does a superb job of  conveying his alien essence. His physical attributes, posture,  movement  and reactions are obviously modelled on reptiles and he makes it all seem  perfectly natural.

I can't really convey the path these two  enemies take towards friendship, which is a pity, since it is the best  feature of the film. Suffice to say that they do eventually grow close,  just in time to share in the first Draco birth witnesses by a human.  Unfortunately the birth goes badly and Jerry dies, leaving Davidge to take  responsibility for raising the child, Zammis. And Davidge takes this task  very seriously; teaching the youngster his race's language, heritage and  religion.

My only disappointment is that the film did not portray  the events after Davidge's rescue in the same detail as Longyear wrote it.  We are given only a brief glimpse of the prejudice and revilement that he  goes through as he displays his love for one of humanities hated rivals.  But we do get to experience the most moving part of the tale, as Davidge  accompanies the adolescent Zammis to the home planet of the Dracos, to  present him at his naming day. An event the two of them have been working  towards for years, where Zammis has to name all of his ancestors, their  affiliation and relationships. An event that would not have been possible  without Davidge acting as a bridge of love across the span of two  generations and two species.",957657600,96,3072,4.796934865900383
279664,4,6300248100,"The only thing I regret about this movie is the abrupt ending. The novel has quite a few chapters where the political and sociological problems the Reciting of Lineage of Jeriba Zammis by a Human throws up are meted out. It  was probably cut from the script either because the budget ran out or (more  likely) because the producers feared that political and sociological  problems wouldn't satisfy the die-hard sci-fi fans... Pity. If you think  science fiction should be about Big Strong Men Who Shoot Eachother With  Laser Guns, then skip this movie. If you think interspecies relationships  could be fun to watch, buy this video.  It's not the most brilliant movie I  ever saw, but it's Pretty Good imho. Fuzzy sci-fi? What's wrong with that?",954720000,4,745,4.857142857142857
279665,3,6300248100,"Being post Star wars, Sci Fi movies have to have something that sets them apart from the Star wars movies. And the idea of a human and an Alien, who are mortal enemys, fighting it out on an unchartered planet and having to  learn to get along and survive, sounded great. It sounds like Star wars  meets the Defiant ones, but unfortunately Enemy mine dispenses of the two  creatures hatred for each other in about 20 minutes. there is a 10 minute  battle at the end. The rest of the running time consists of the human and  the alien getting to know and like each other. Which is fine, its  occasionly exciting, nearly always entertaining and its worth-while  veiwing. If it came out before Star wars it would be much more well known.  Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett Jr are both exceptional and they carry the  whole film on there shoulders. Maybe a few more Characters here and there  would have helped.",952819200,,902,4.512345679012346
