8292824,2,B001DDBDIQ,"I knew this was a low-budget effort from new directors, but as I am always on the lookout for new horror flicks I hoped for the best. Oh, well... I suppose I should state from the beginning that those 2 stars above are for unbridled horror film enthusiasm alone; I seldom hate a decent horror film. That said, there just isn't much to thrill at here and none of it new. The atmosphere seldom rises to the occasion, the sets (alot of apartment settings) didn't improve matters, most of the acting is amateurish or simply flat, and the stories seemed to start nowhere and return there as quickly as the thin plots could carry them. Most standard horror film sequels are better than this.",1316476800,,685,4.532258064516129
8292825,1,B001DDBDIQ,If you're accustomed to quality supernatural or horror movies this film is going to be a disappointment An obviously very low budget for this type of film in these days is not going to satisfy an audience accustomed to impressive localities and visual effects. And to have four crammed into an hour just makes it feel undeveloped and rushed. The stories themselves were nothing out of the ordinary. To the directors and crew - keep trying. We all have to start somewhere.,1238630400,2,471,4.7560975609756095
