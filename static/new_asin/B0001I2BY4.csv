8012799,2,B0001I2BY4,"Bought this for nostalgic reasons.  Back in the late 80s to late 90s, I was a big fan of this stuff. Problem for me was at that time much of this stuff was not available on video outside of ""Mind's Eye"" products.",1456617600,,212,4.0476190476190474
8012800,1,B0001I2BY4,"It's definetely not worth buying. It's set of 2 DVDs and out
of all the animations only 3 are worth watching - Bingo, Tight rope
and Migration. Rest is crap.  All the animations
are outdated and even the three good ones are more than five years
old. Instead one should buy a DVD of any latest blockbuster
3d animated movie.",1119657600,,323,4.383333333333334
8012801,5,B0001I2BY4,"I seen this video first at a club when a dj was spinning records.
I was watching it off and on the whole time and made me want to buy it so I did. Watched it all at home a it is good for a laugh and is very good. The main reason I got it was to play when I'm having parties just to play in the background for some visual. It will get people talking. I have watched it twice with sound like I would any other movie. It is a good video and I recommend if you are in to djing and want a club atmosphere or like computer anamation",1073347200,2,526,3.663716814159292
8012802,4,B0001I2BY4,"This is the latest compilation of computer animated short films from Odyssey Productions (known for its popular ""Mind's Eye"" videos).  Presented are sixteen short films from commercial and independent animators: Tightrope, Ronin Romance Classics, Fiat Lux, Pings, Teaspoon, My Lucky Day, Un Temps Pour Elle, Migrations, Fat Cat on a Diet, Ombre Portee, Hollow, La Stele, Tribu, Apples and Oranges, Playground Zero, Butterflies in the Rain.  The video quality varies based on the source material of each film, but most of the films look pretty decent.
Parents, be warned that the DVD comes with a sticker on the front warning of ""mature programming"", although there is nothing that terrible here... just a non-gory gunshot in Tightrope and some minor PG-rated sexual innuendo/bathroom humor in other films.
The totally innocent and playful film ""Butterflies in the Rain"" and the dazzlingly beautiful ""Un Temps Pour Elle"" are two highlights of this very enjoyable DVD.",977184000,18,966,5.348684210526316
