8543888,4,B009RJRH7O,"This is a series of clips showing different moves. There isn't much technical or anatomical instruction. A lot of it, you learn by watching and trying out, which is the way capoeira usually is anyway.

Put it this way, it feels like I'm watching a collection of clips on YouTube from some capoeira guy. They aren't that heavily produced, they are quick, and they're not made by someone who understands pedagogy and exercise science. What advantage this does have is that a lot of the techniques are things you won't be finding for free on YouTube.",1474848000,,547,4.697916666666667
