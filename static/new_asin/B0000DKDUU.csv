1925890,4,B0000DKDUU,"The Muppet Show was endearing and revolutionary - it was adorable, insanely funny, and appealed to all ages not only because of it's roster of top rated guest stars, but because of the Muppet characters themselves. A timeless show to be sure.
I keep hoping that they will come out with every episode, whether it be a few at a time on one DVD like this one or one massive collection, but for now, my family and I make do with a few gems like these. This DVD features commentary by Brian Henson, Jim's son, with some behind the episodes information. That may be my only complaint here - we had thought that there would be more special DVD features, or maybe even room for four episodes.
On the whole, this one is superb - Steve Martin's episode is highlighted by Steve playing his banjo with the Muppet ""jug band"". For anyone who didn't know, Steve Martin is a self-taught banjo and ukelele player, and he is phenominal.
Gilda Radner is at her absolutely ditsy, lovable best - her mock operetta with a carrot in a distinguished tuxedo is wonderful. Her episode also features a rousing chorus of penguins singing Broadway standards. Too cute.
Carol Burnett's selection is definitely the best one here, and won an Emmy for writing. The entire episode takes place in the midst of a dance competition, (suggested by Gonzo, so you know things are bound to go haywire!). Carol winds up with Animal as her partner, and tries unsuccessfully to perform her ballads amid the changing song styles, all with hilarious results.
The best thing about The Muppet Show is that it never grows old or out of style, and never loses it's charm. Our 2 year old is just as happy watching it as our 10 year old, and my husband and I have no problem with popping this in, either. Even if you are just revisiting these episodes after seeing them when you were a child, this show and it's episodes are must haves for any family to enjoy. Three classic comic talents, on one great DVD, from one fantastic show!!!!",1073606400,4,1983,4.5418994413407825
1925891,4,B0000DKDUU,"May I just say that I enjoy all three of the actors on this DVD. But Steve Martin's show was like watching rehearals, and he wasn't that funny. I got bored of him 'trying' to act funny. Kermit had auditions for new acts and Steve's show had been cancelled without telling him, so Steve auditioned too... I wouldn't have hired him...
Regardless! Carol Burnett and Gilda Radner's shows more than made up for it. Carol's episode won an Emmy, I believe for writing. Brian Henson will tell you this in the intro, and I believe it. The whole show was a dance contest Gonzo had convinced Kermit into letting him do while Carol was supposed to perform. She ended up paired with Animal. Carol is a riot!
Gilda Radner's episode stole the whole DVD however, and I'm a huge Carol Burnett fan. They spent most of the show getting stuck to things after an accident with Dr. Honeydew and some Muppets Labs superglue. Gilda's hand was stuck to her forehead for most of it.
A good DVD. I'm disappointed in the other reviews save one that actually was about the DVD itself. Don't bring the ratings of a DVD down because you're too lazy to look for the whole set on the internet and need to complain, that's not fair. Go to timelife.com and for 150.00 you can buy the entire thing. Duh! I get them from Amazon because I get to pick and choose which ones I want. At timelife it's 25.00 a piece to choose.",1072396800,17,1384,4.389105058365759

She interacted with the characters like it was second nature.  She always had a smile on her face.  I would recommend this to anyone on her performance alone.",1315872000,,280,4.431372549019608

8001356,4,B0000DKDUU,"This Best of the Muppet Show Collection contains three episodes. The first episode is the show where Steve Martin guest stars. The big joke about this whole episode is that Kermit cancels the Muppet Show that night because they have to have auditions to book new acts. Steve Martin is a bit upset about the whole thing, but ends up ""auditioning"" a couple of times himself-- performing just for the Muppets themselves. He does a hilarious sketch with balloon animals and later plays a tune on the banjo. As much as I enjoy the Muppet Show and like Steve Martin, this is one of the weaker episodes I have seen (though it is worth watching just to see the balloon animals and Rowlf's response to the doggy balloon).
The second episode guest stars Carol Burnett. Carol arrives to find out that Gonzo has talked Kermit into allowing a dance marathon to take place on the show. Everyone is dancing the whole night, including Burnett. She gets to sing a few songs and a couple times becomes so frustrated that she starts to choke Kermit (in the same way that Homer Simpson does to Bart). This episode netted Jim Henson and company an Emmy for Best Writing for a Comedy Series.
The last episode on the disc is one that guest stars Gilda Radner. I was too young to remember any of Radner's original performances, but from just watching this episode one can tell that the woman was a comic genius and could have been as big as Lucille Ball. This episode is the funniest episode on the disc and includes a couple of hilarious sketches including one where Radner sings a duet with a 7-foot tall carrot and another where Radner accidently releases a tube of Dr. Honeydew's special glue all over the set. Things get really messy and the glue forms a gag that lasts the rest of the show.
This DVD also includes an archive photo and a few facts about Beaker, some Muppetisms (which are essentially public service commercials) and several adds for other Henson films and shows.
From all the Best of Muppet Show discs I have seen, this one is rather weak. Nevertheless, it is THE MUPPET SHOW and a weak episode of THE MUPPET SHOW is ten times better than one of the current comedies(such as FRIENDS) on television today.",1082073600,16,2202,4.563131313131313
8001357,3,B0000DKDUU,"I admit to echoing the opinions of most of the other reviewers thus far, but a consensus about this disc might prevent buyers from being disappointed with it. We buy each of the ""Best of the Muppet Show"" dvds as they come out, and this one is the weakest so far. Steve Martin's episode falls flat, although the sketches remind me of the Ed Sullivan bits available on the ""Muppets Magic"" dvd. The Carol Burnett episode is better but not one of the greatest shows; Carol sings a lot more than she does her signature comedy schtick, and the dance contest gag gets old before the episode ends. By far the best of the three episodes, the Gilda Radner show delivers the kind of laugh out loud comedy that one would expect from this disc.
If you own all of the other dvds and want to expand your collection, then this disc will be worth it for the Gilda Radner show, but don't buy this one as your first Muppet Show dvd! The Peter Sellers/John Cleese/Dudley Moore disc is MUCH funnier if you want Muppets and comedians, and the Harry Belafonte/Linda Ronstadt/John Denver disc has lots of great singing AND great jokes.",1074470400,40,1111,4.5049504950495045
