832379,5,6304286783,I highly recommend this 1950's Doris Day thriller directed by Andrew L. Stone who also wrote it and it was nominated in that category for an academy award at the time.  Frank Lovejoy gives a great supporting performance as a San Francisco detective and Louis Jordan delivers as the heavy with great panache.  Suspenseful throughout with a brilliant ending.,1121385600,5,356,5.016949152542373
832380,5,6304286783,"During her career, Doris Day rarely ventured out of her musical comedy range.  Films like ""Julie"", ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", ""Storm Warning"", ""Young Man with a Horn"" and ""Midnight Lace"" are the exception.

Doris Day could do anything but she was exceptionally fine in her dramatic roles which I wish she would have done more of.  ""Julie"" is a fine example of what she accomplished. She holds your attention throughout and Doris is such a 'natural' actress that you totally believe and get caught up in her circumstance.

The film is spine-tingling and nail biting that rivets you to the screen from its first scene to the last.  The film seems to fly by in minutes....it is THAT good.

Louis Jordan makes a menacing husband provoking bad memories for Doris of her first husband, especially in the first scene.

For those who like suspense at its best, get this!  The other dramatic roles to be recommended are the ones I mentioned above.  Doris was superb in all of them and gave Academy Award caliber performances in ""Midnight Lace"" and ""The Man who Knew Too Much"".  She was superb!!!  ""Julie"" ranks up there with her best work.",1094256000,10,1132,4.666666666666667
832381,5,6304286783,I have always loved Julie it is such a great movie I bought this movie a few years ago the same edition as pictured and i absolutely loved it! It was so clean and so nice. Doris and Louis made such a great couple. This is not a good movie for kids because of the murder and that sort of stuff but for we adults it is a grand movie! Doris and Louis had such great chemistry !,1082678400,2,374,3.8076923076923075
832382,4,6304286783,"What struck me most about ""Julie"" was that the situation it depicts, while it may have seemed outlandish at the time in the 1950s/60s, is actually more true than not. Modern US social history has given us plenty of examples of women married to violent men, men who would rather kill them than let them leave.
Doris Day turns in a pretty good performance as Julie, a remarried widow who has had it with her new husband's jealous fits. It's when she tells him that maybe she wants out of the marriage that he betrays deeper problems, jamming her foot down on the accelerator in a terrifying car ride, that she can no longer make any excuses for him. Then, old family friend Barry Sullivan tells her there was no reason for her first husband to kill himself, and then she and he begin to wonder what Jourdan could possibly have to do with that. What do YOU think, dear reader? Yup, you guessed it, but this gets disclosed about 15 minutes in anyway, so that's no big surprise.
As I wrote above, what is the surprise is how realistic the storyline is in depicting how such a woman would be stalked and terrorized. The police tell her there's nothing much to be done on their end, and sadly, that hasn't changed enough 40 years later, as many domestic homicides would attest.
I thought ""Julie"" was exceptionally well made for a very obscure film. Previously, I had thought Doris' only movie like this was ""Midnight Lace"", but this predates that by a few years. The only discordant note is the theme song, sung by Miss Day over the titles, which show us Doris hurrying to her car to escape Jourdan. Very insensitive musical scoring at that point.
Otherwise, I recommend ""Julie"" as a suspense movie that really works. It's a pity that it's not so well known.",1048550400,29,1751,4.526813880126183
832383,4,6304286783,"Director Andrew Stone had an ability to make a lot of programmers appear to be better than they actually were. He was economic but managed to make his films look like expensive productions. Most of them turned out to be surprisingly entertaining with the exception of his attempt to resurrect the operetta in the early 70's.  ""Song of Norway"", based on the lovely Broadway success, and ""The Great Waltz"", dubbed ""The Great Schmaltz"" by critics, effectively ended his career.
""Julie"" his late 1956 release pleased its intended market thanks to a sincere performance from star Doris Day, and a taut script that rarely falters in its crackling pace. Sure there are holes in the plot and any fan of this kind of story (the wife in peril) will know the ending long before it happens. Nevertheless, its what was known as a ""popcorn movie"" and the picture nabbed two Oscar Nominations (for screenplay and for song). It lost the song nod to another Day tune, ""Whatever Will Be, Will Be"", from her hugely popular Hitchcock release of 1956 co-starring Jimmy Stewart, ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"".
Doris Day plays Julie, a newly remarried widow who works as an airline attendant.  She is married to Lyle, a gifted pianist, and they live in a beautiful coastal town in California.
Lyle is obsessively jealous of anyone taking a look at his wife, and his jealousy manifests itself in a series of unsettling incidents that makes Julie begin to question their relationship as well as the circumstances surrounding the death of her late husband.
The film's conclusion in which Doris successfully pilots a passenger plane has gone down in film lore.  It should be pointed out that Day's acting and piloting skills here are superior to those evidenced by Karen Black in 1973's ""Airport 1974"" in which she too pulls the same trick.
It's all very improbable but dished out with such conviction by the cast that one can overlook the improbability.
As stated, Doris Day delivers a fine performance in the leading role. She is sympathetic but never acts like a victim. She has a great chemistry with Louis Jourdan who plays her husband Lyle believably.  Interestingly Jourdan lived across the street from Day in Beverly Hills for some years. Despite his dashing portrayal as leading man in the classic film, ""Gigi"", Jourdan has always made a much more interesting villian including a turn in a 1983 James Bond film.
Barry Sullivan and Frank Lovejoy, among the supporting players, play stereotypical roles with flair and the stunning scenes shot in Carmel, California translate well even in black and white.
Doris Day loved Carmel so much while making this film that 25 years later she moved her primary residence to this quaint, charming, and dramatic location.
While ""Julie"" is not nearly as good as Doris Day's other two thrillers (""Man Who Knew..."" and 1960's, ""Midnight Lace""), it will satisfy most fans of the genre and Miss Day.",1010534400,51,2910,4.872727272727273
832384,3,6304286783,"Doris Day did not do well at all in Hitchcock's Man Who Knew Too Much, so it comes as a surprise that she handles herself admirably well as Julie, the widowed flight attendant cursed with Louis Jourdan for a husband (that alone would be bad enough, except that he is also homicidally jealous).  There is very little substance in the way of plot or deeper meaning in this movie, but for what it is, a predecessor of the stalker/slasher genre, it can be quite exciting.  Although some below found the airplane finale a bit hokey, I was caught up and thrilled by it.",985564800,2,563,4.456310679611651
832385,4,6304286783,"Great change of pace for Doris Day who plays airline stewardess Julie Benton. After marrying Louis Jourdan, an overly jealous man, she discovers that he killed her first husband in order to have her. She is unable to get  help from the police because it is her word against his and because the law  at that time stated that a wife could not testify against her husband. The  movie is tense and keeps you on the edge of your seat as Julie tries to  escape her pyscopathic husband. The climax is dynamite although it does  stretch your imagination a little bit. Alright, a big bit but remember this  movie was made at a time when people went to the movies to be entertained  by melodramatics and not be buried in reality. This is one of the better  melodramas with Miss Day giving a fine performance. The title song. JULIE,  is beautiful and stayed on top of the Hit Parade for many weeks.

Then comes the interesting part - Day runs for her  life, stalked by husband Jordan.  Police are powerless under laws not made  for helpless women - interesting indictment of then society.  Whole thing  concludes with a silly ending - Day flying captainless plane to a safe  landing after melodramatic shooting death of Jordan and captain in the  cockpit.

832625,4,6304286783,"For all the negative reviews 1956's ""Julie,"" a Doris Day suspense thriller, a about it being irrational, a lot of care went into the making of it.  Still it seems like it was thrown together, with the middle at first, and irritating voice over narratives providing the glue to piece it together or explain what's been missing.  The film was written and directed by Andrew L. Stone (""Cry Terror"") who received an AAN for writing it.  Produced by Martin Melcher, who know had a vested interest in Ms. Day as he was to marry her.  The song, ""Julie"" was written by Leith Stevens and Tom Adair was nominated for an Oscar.  The music also featured a piano composition ""Midnight on the Cliff"" composed and performed by Leonard Pennario.  The tagline on the poster says ""What Happened to Julie on Her Honeymoon?""  This seems something thought in hindsight as her honeymoon is given any screen time.  But we don't need all the glue.  It still is a pretty good noir-ish little thriller that seemed designed to put Doris in an airplane and be forced to land it ala Karen Black in ""Airport 1975"" and who knows how many other countless TV movies, etc.?  The improvements in our society for the rights of women are sorely needed by Julie, but the last image of Day after she lands the plane makes it apparent a girl like Julie would definitely be up to doing it all over again if she had to have her true love.

832694,1,6304286783,"The film seems to start in the middle. Julie (Doris Day) comes out of a building and hops into a convertible. A man, who turns out to be her husband Lyle Benton (Louis Jourdan), comes to the car and gets in. She drives away. For the most part she is going straight (if you look at the ""scenery"" behind her), but she turns the huge steering wheel all the way to the left, and all the way to right. Back and forth, back and forth, like a little kid practicing driving. So maybe it doesn't have power steering, but if she steered like that in real life, she'd be all over the road.

She lights into her husband, who, being played by Louis Jordan has a French accent, but I'm not sure if he is supposed to be French, since his name is not. She's furious because he humiliated her in front of a lot of people, because she was talking to a man, and Lyle got jealous. Lyle doesn't say anything, but he scoots over, and presses his foot down, perpendicular on her right foot, just the toe/half instep part, so that the car is speeding. Julie is wearing pumps (ugly ones) so she could have pulled her foot out of her shoe. Instead of grabbing his private parts with her right hand and squeezing with all her might, or putting the car in neutral, or steering into some grass and pushing down with her left foot on the emergency brake, she whimpers, ""Please take your foot off mine! Please, please!"" Ugh. (Later, she has a chance to throw hot coffee in his face, but instead she scurries away like a scared baby animal.)

During this very fast car ride, Lyle sometimes looks at the road, sometimes just at Julie's profile. His left arm is stretched out behind her on the seat back. He's very relaxed and enjoying himself. After awhile he starts trying to grab the keys in the ignition. Somehow Julie prevents this with her right hand fumbling on his. Lyle seems quite content throughout Julie's panic. They drive around steep curves on cliffs with no barriers, just drop-offs, and tear down the road in between cars, and finally Julie passes out. Her head slumps down. Lyle then reaches over and steers the car, and apparently puts his foot on the brake. When they stop, Julie, very quickly recovered, jumps out of the car and runs a short distance. Suddenly Lyle is crying ""Julie, Julie!"" and running after her, and telling her he's sorry.

For me, sorry wouldn't cut it, but it does for Julie. She feels compassionate toward him. Evidently, Julie was married to Bob, who supposedly committed suicide by hanging himself. Then she married Lyle. But Lyle was around when she was married to Bob. How long was it before she married Lyle? It must have been right after the funeral. Lyle is supposedly madly in love with her, but why did she marry him?

Julie starts to have a suspicion that Lyle killed Bob, so that he could have her. He very quickly admits that he did, and now Julie is ready to leave him. Her friend Henderson helps her. Suddenly, Julie is a stewardess. But Lyle did not know that she was a stewardess?

The first part is very boring, and Julie and Henderson (her male friend) just don't have skills. They do things that intelligent, pro-active people who are running away from a killer would not do. Lyle Benton later does something to hurt Julie, that if he had any brains, would realize wouldn't make a difference.

Then, it gets kind of exciting. Then it gets boring again.  Julie is sometimes very brave, and sometimes very whiny and acts like a little sissy.

The ending was one of those, ""That's it?""",1408233600,3,3511,4.483568075117371

832909,5,6304286783,I remember watching this movie growing up on one of the local tv station afternoon matinee theaters I think they used to call them. I always liked this movie. This is a 1950's noir film I guess is how it would be classified now days. Doris Day plays a young woman recently married to a concert pianist played by Luis Jourdan. Everything starts out OK but Julie played by Ms. Day slowly begins to realize her new husband has a violent jealous streak so she finds out when her husband tells her that he killed her previous husband because he wanted her and was jealous and so determined to have her for his own. He tells her that he is so jealous of anyone she talks to and that if she ever tries to leave him he'll kill her too. She is now so scared all she can think of is to get away from this jealous fiend. She gets help from a friend to played by Barry Sullivan to get away and start again with a new identity. One fatal flaw is she goes back to her previous occupation as an airline stewardess. She thinks she is safe when she suddenly hears  one of his piano sessions blaring from a car parked outside her apartment she shares with a fellow airline stewardess. This is the timed old tale of woman being stalked by a violent predator and the police are unable to do anything to stop her husband...back of course before laws were put into effect to convict stalkers. The films climax is when her jealous husband sneaks aboard the plane she has been scheduled to fill in at the last minute. He gets into the cockpit and shoots both the pilot and the co-pilot and is killed himself in the gun fight. Then it's up to our heroine Ms Day to fly the plane and land it safely. It's a good film for it's time and theme and is suspenseful enough it will have you on the edge of your chair right up to the end of the movie. I recommend this movie whether you are a Doris Day fan or not. It's a good suspenseful film and Doris Day is excellent and has a fine cast to support her.,1370044800,2,1972,4.162303664921466

If you pay attention closely, you will notice any number of scenes in which the boom mike or its shadow bob into the frame.

832916,4,6304286783,"I must confess that I bought this DVD only because I lived in California for 24 years and wanted to see the magnificent coastal California scenery which opens the movie and runs for the first twenty minutes or so.  Even in black and white, the opening scene of Julie running across the golf green toward the Lodge at Pebble Beach and climbing the stairs to enter the Lodge's spacious lobby and then outside to her car is a unique view of how the Lodge has changed over the years.  I used to have Mexican Coffees or English Tea and Cookies in that lobby whenever I visited the Lodge.  What a view of Stillwater Cove from the windows!  The plot, a stunningly handsome man who terrifies and then stalks his new bride, isn't one that appeals to me very much.  But the scenery alone is worth the price of the DVD.  The honeymoon cottage on the dunes is gorgeous!  The shots of Mediterranean Market and all of the quaint shops in Carmel are fun to see again, as are the shots in Pacific Grove, and also of Monterey when Julie goes to the police station. And the hair-raising scene when Lyle forces Julie's foot down on the accelerator of their car as they race along Seventeen Mile Drive heading toward Pacific Grove gives me chills.

Turner Classic Movies usually shows it about once a year during their Doris Day marathon.
This great movie also stars Louis Jourdan and was filmed partially on California's Monterey
Peninsula - Carmel to be exact.  Doris Day said that's when she fell in love with the Carmel
area and has lived there on a large ranch for many years.  To me, this movie is what I
consider to be a suspense/thriller.  Quite different for Miss Day who usually starred in
light, fluffy comedy films (which I also adore).  I was so glad to see that it was finally
remastered and released in November 2011.  This movie is too much of a treasure to be put
away in a dusty vault.  Yes, I am a huge Doris Day fan, and the mysterious and sexy
Louis Jourdan adds the film's ""darkness"" that keeps you in suspense.  This film definitely
qualifies as a movie classic.",1326585600,5,930,4.4035087719298245

833000,4,6304286783,"As some have stated this is Doris Day against type. That's what makes it work so well. Certain actors, especially ones like Ms. Day, who were known for fun and frolic, can surprise with a sullen side. Outside of her sunny singing voice, I always thought she had a greater ability for diversity. She is well suited for the role of Julie. Many a modern film has borrowed concepts from this long forgotten air flight/shock drama. A stewardess in the hot seat with a little murder tossed in should be enough to wet your appetite.

Bigger question, where's the dvd? This wasn't even released on laserdisc which covered many titles so who knows. The VHS tape has cropped or pan and scanned the film. I'm pretty sure this was originally a widescreen release in theatres . A blu ray with extras would shine. B&W is underestimated for high def. It's a spirited little film, enjoy it.

833003,2,6304286783,"This movie was difficult to find and now that I've finally seen it I must admit to some disappointment. The setting, the Carmel-Monterey area lends itself to color, the film is black and white (I know that is supposed to make the drama more stark but in this case it didn't.)The film has a magnificent music theme (later popularized by Les Baxter as ""Midnight on the Cliffs"")that is not properly used.  While it could elevate the role of the location in the story and generate a suspenseful mood it is heard only once, when it is played by Louis Jordan's character, a jealous crazed pschycopathic pianist (ridiculous).The theme song ""Julie"" sounds like a reject from a 50s family sit-com. The complex relationship between the two key characters is never clearly defined nor is there any trace of explanation for this pianist's obsession with jealousy.  The only sympathetic element in Jourdan's character is the fact he ever agreed to play the part (probably due to his close friendship with Doris in real life.) It is easy to understand why Doris didn't want to do the film.  It was her third husband's first film as producer and I understand he convinced her to star. It was a bit shocking to see Doris puffing on cigarettes in this film, probably the result of the stress caused by having to appear in the movie. As usual Doris was excellent but her presence and the brief exposure to Leonard Penario's music are the only reasons to watch this film.  It's ashamed the real talent here was buried with poor writing, poor choices, and produced with poor taste.  It is no wonder this film is hard to find. Those involved probably hoped it would disappear.",1252713600,6,1655,4.71280276816609
833004,5,6304286783,"I first saw this movie in a theater and as with many other young men of my generation, I had a crush on Doris Day. Well, why not?  A tall willowy beautiful blond with a golden voice, this time playing an airline stewardess in a trim uniform with the cute little hat they wore in those days, who is being stalked by a demented husband bent on destroying her. The movie has never been available in any of the rental outlets, and if not for Amazon's dealer network, wouldn't be available at all. I would have liked to have had it on DVD, but I'll settle for VHS.

""Julie"" was one of Miss Day's first dramatic roles with very little of her singing. Maybe the plot was a little contrived, but our idol was in constant danger in this movie and we could do nothing to help. The ending, in which she must land an airliner when the pilots have been killed or disabled, is a thriller and we all stopped biting our fingernails and breathed a sigh of relief when she finally put it safely on the ground, and presumably, everyone lived happily ever after. I don't think we young men noticed at the time, but the performances of Lovejoy, Sullivan and Jourdan were also very good. Fifty years later, I enjoyed it as much as I did in the theater and was madly in love with Doris Day all those years ago.

Doris Day is very convincing as well Louis Jourdan. The acting and the drama are superb. From the very first scene to the very end you have nothing but action.

833006,4,6304286783,"1956's ""Julie"" stars Doris Day, Louis Jourdan, Barry Sullivan, and Frank Lovejoy. Parts of the plot aren't exactly brimming over with realism, but this black-and-white thriller/suspense drama remains one of my favorite Doris Day pictures.

Doris portrays ""Julie Benton"", a woman who suddenly realizes her husband is a murderer. Jourdan plays the obsessive husband, who (it seems) will go to any lengths to track down and do away with the scared-stiff Mrs. Benton.

Both Day and Jourdan do a nice job in this film, IMO, but Sullivan is a tad bit on the ""cardboard"" side here (playing a friend of Julie's who tries to get her out of harm's way). Jourdan, though, is quite creepy and believable as ""Lyle Benton"", whose ""bent on"" (~wink~) seeing Julie suffer.

Doris is an airline stewardess/hostess/flight attendant in ""Julie"", and actually participated in a three-week training course for flight attendants in preparation for making this movie.

The climax of the film has Julie being forced to take the controls of her pilot-less commercial airliner. It's all a bit far afield from reality, but great fun anyway. The most (unintentionally) hilarious portion of the final reel is, in my opinion, when we see the air-traffic controller who's ""talking Julie down"" standing right out there on the runway as Julie brings in the heavy Douglas DC-6 propliner! The controller is standing just outside his airport vehicle, tied to it via a long microphone cord, right on the runway itself, as he's talking Julie in.  It just struck me as hysterical, and certainly ""dates"" the available technology of the era. If that situation were to occur today, I'm doubting that a man would need to PHYSICALLY stand on the runway, without the aid of any radar scope, in order to help the amateur pilot bring the plane in. :-)

""Julie"" sports some very nice photography. Some excellent Northern California scenery can be seen in the movie. The film's original publicity materials, distributed at the time of the film's release in late 1956, boasted that 120 'Live' sets were used on 48 different shooting location sites during production.

The haunting theme song (""Julie"") is sung by the film's heroine (Doris Day) as the opening titles roll. That title song fits the mood of the movie perfectly.

Some Doris Day and ""Julie"" Trivial Tidbits:

>> Doris Day was born ""Doris Kappelhoff"" in April 1924. She was 32 when ""Julie"" premiered in theaters on October 17th, 1956.

>> Doris was in approximately 40 feature films during her movie career (which began in 1948). She made ""Julie"" in between two of her other memorable films -- Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" (1956) and ""The Pajama Game"" (1957). Doris finished up a busy decade of the 1950s with possibly the best role/movie of her career -- as ""Jan Morrow"" in 1959's ""Pillow Talk"".

>> Keep an eye open for veteran character actor Barney Phillips in a supporting role as a doctor in ""Julie"". In fact, Barney helps Doris fly the plane in the final act (as he keeps an eye on the instrument panel while, at the same time, trying to keep the co-pilot alive)! Talk about performing double-duty! LOL!

You might recognize Phillips from a ton of other roles that he had in many TV shows and movies. He was the ""Martian"" (with a third eyeball) in a classic episode of ""The Twilight Zone""; a cop on ""The Dick Van Dyke Show""; a vicious escaped convict on ""The Andy Griffith Show""; and a Sergeant in ""Adam 12""; plus hundreds of other small parts.

>> The name created for the fictional airline that Doris Day works for in ""Julie"" is ""Amalgamated Airlines"". The ""red-eye"" flight in the movie was ""Amalgamated Flight 36"".

MGM/UA Home Video produced this VHS video of ""Julie"". Running time is 97 minutes. Video aspect ratio is Full Frame (1.33:1). Audio sounds pretty good via the Hi-Fi Mono soundtrack.

A Final ""Julie"" Recommendation......

If you want to see the lovely Doris Day in a fairly-entertaining drama/thriller (and hear her belt out the title song, to boot, via that beautiful and always-enchanting singing voice), then place ""Julie"" into the VCR. It's definitely worthy of a look-see.",1132358400,9,4129,4.8855507868383405
