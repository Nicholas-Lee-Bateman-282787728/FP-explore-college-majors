8433489,5,B004KVXCBO,"I chose this rating because I was familiar with the value Mike Wallace places on the truth whether the viewer will like it or not.  This results in wildly different immediate responses, but he usually wins in the long haul.  I loved every minute of this and am recommending it to any thinking adult who can understand English.",1387670400,,326,4.603448275862069

8433491,5,B004KVXCBO,"Korea, Vietnam through to the Gulf War, astonishing film footage, educational, nostalgic to those who lived it, lessons for the future. 10, 47-minute episodes rich with firefight footage, not for the squeamish. A documentary on modern warfare, the good, the bad and the ugly. Propaganda revealed along with leadership decisions on both the pos. and neg. sides. 20 Emmy-winner Mike Wallace is no novice to covering US war and here is a supreme example of his journalistic ability. Reporters such as Murrow, Cronkite, Safer & others are also brought back to life in recovered news-footage. See John McCain as a tortured, wounded, captured pilot,+ MacArthur and McNamara in action.

A worthy DVD set for any history, war historian, US history, or military buff. A must see for anyone born in the 20th century later half. Vets will remember much more than presented here. Scenes are not all heroic winning. Some are. Women in war is covered as well.

SUBTITLES provided. Bonus of 9 text military leader bios.
