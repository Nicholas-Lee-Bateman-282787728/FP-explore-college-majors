Joel Weldon is a very interesting speaker to say the least.

I have kind of mixed feelings about the way Joel presents his story, he has an amazing energy, mixes in a few jokes and makes you laugh. But once in a while it goes a little to far and he gets to be a little much.

The story of the DVD is about when Joel met the cab driver Willie, now I don't want to ruin the story because I think you should see it for yourself, and how Willie proves to be the most skilled salesman I have ever heard of.
This guy is a taxi driver! But still made himself a good living, his usual tip was about 40-60%!

What he did, and did so well, was notice the little things. He was fully prepared for any event and made sure that his customers were as pleased as they possible can be when in his cab.

After watching this DVD I realized there were a lot of things I could do to make my customers more pleased. I have 3 ideas that I am sure will make a enormous difference to the number of repeat customers we get.

I think you should definitely bring your notepad and write down all the good ideas that you get during the DVD. There are a lot of them!

If you have the ambition to become the top salesman in your company or your industry, this DVD will go a long way in helping you achieve it.",1282694400,,1365,4.0
