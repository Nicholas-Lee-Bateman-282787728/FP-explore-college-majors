3788684,5,B001T9O68S,A MUST READ FOR EVERY HUMAN BEING!!! DIFERENCE BETWEEN ETERNAL LIFE AND ETERNAL DAMNATION!!! YES A MUST READ FOR ALL!!!,1361404800,3,119,5.0
3788685,5,B001T9O68S,"The film includes an interview with dramatizations of the author's near-death experience, after he briefly died after drinking water and contracting cholera.  Melvin goes into great detail in his descriptions of hell, telling how people were punished for their acts in cubes.  The demons apparently have the power to recreate events on the earth which are then turned against those punished, over and over again.  He also mentions seeing Hitler in hell.  Scary wake-up call for everyone to get right with God before it's too late.",1305158400,17,530,5.127906976744186

3788691,1,B001T9O68S,"This video unfortunately shows up in searches for the classic 1955 movie ""To Hell And Back""  about the life and heroic war exploits of Audie Murphy. It doesn't only show up in searches since the title matches - it also showed a 1955 release date (clearly this video was recorded decades later) and shows a cast including Mr. Murphy (definitely not).

8340868,1,B001T9O68S,"This video contains many, many inconsistencies. He also describes things about the people he saw that he could not possibly know from the experience he described, for example:

He saw a temple prostitute that died in 69AD (how does he know the year she died?) and said she burned hundreds of babies alive during her life, yet there is no record of any woman burning hundreds of newborns during that time, or ever, which would perhaps be the most haneous crime and most terrible serial murder in human history. Yet nothing exists about this.

Also, a prostitute would not have many funds, and considering the smell human flesh produces when burning is incredibly pungent, and she lived in a city, and there were no windows or door seals at the time... How she could have done it hundreds of times is a great mystery.

He also recalls seeing a woman trapped in a coffin for hundreds of years, yet he stated he only saw her for a few seconds. Also, she was stuck in the coffin, a wodden box sealed tightly as he described it. Yet he also described what she was doing inside the coffin... How did he see her?

He described hell as being very dark and couldn't see very far in front of him, yet also described being able to see for miles, which contradict each other.

He also described seeing Hitler with worms slowly eating his face, but also that his entire body was in flames and he could barely tell who he was, so how did he also describe the maggots in such detail on his face just before?

I also don't like the political messages embedded in this video. I really doubt that God cares that you vote Republican. The Bible states many, many times that God doesn't care about governments and their business and wants us to be no part of the world.

I really doubt Jesus hates Democrats, or any party.

This recount is also told through a naritive, or a 3rd person perspective; as a story, almost entirely. The speaker does not recount events based on his experience, or from the first person except for a few times. This is what law students are taught is a dead giveaway for a liar.

I do not disbelieve in heaven or hell, but I do disbelieve in this story.",1448064000,,2158,4.429292929292929
