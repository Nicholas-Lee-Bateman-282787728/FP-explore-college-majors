MONSTER FROM THE OCEAN FLOOR/SERPENT ISLAND
Another excellent release from the good guys at VCI that pleases way more than it should.  Contained herein are absolutely gorgeous transfers of both films, but there is much more to delight any Monster Kid.

THE MONSTER FROM THE OCEAN FLOOR:
The thing that brings this release up to first class status is the way Tom Weaver, Grand Sultan of `50s Sci Fi cinema, guides us through the history of this film with his entertaining and happily lengthy conversation with Roger Corman.
Then there is the trivia extra.  Before dispatching it, I at first took this to be a throwaway.  It is actually another half hour of extremely interesting info on the film with Mr. Weaver's very pleasant and chummy voice hosting. His astute observation confirms the importance of MONSTER FROM THE OCEAN FLOOR.
I would have never in a million years realized that there are so many Firsts connected with this film!  There are so many to list and I don't want to spoil anyone's listening to this wonderful commentary, but I will point out the obvious one that this is Corman's first monster film.  This is only one of many items that originated with this tiny little film.
Oh yes, I should also mention that this DVD also contains some deleted footage and Tom even tells you where you can see color photos of the mini sub used in the film.

SERPENT ISLAND
Oh well, you can't win them all!  Basically this film is 62 minutes of a gin soaked Sonny Tufts sucking in his gut under a skipper's hat.  I actually did have some fun with the film by noticing all the bad edits and miss-matched shots of stock footage and stocky Sonny Tufts.  There is a moth eaten snake and some voodoo too.  It's one of those fun inept films that needs no annoying MST3 banter interrupting it.  Watch it with some of your more witty friends and you'll do a better job of it than those guys.
The transfer as I mentioned is excellent.  Not sure how the folks at VCI were able to squeeze out the very warm color from a film shot on 16mm.
I also want to mention that VCI makes the absolute best company logos EVER.  They are always coming up with very inventive stuff as the disc is firing up.  The problem I've had with this was that you had to wait through these classy things till you got to the main menu that enables you to see the film.  I put the discs on quite a bit because of the double features and all the extras.  I see the creativity of the VCI logos, but I don't want to HAVE to see them each and every time I put the disc in.  With this release it is now possible get right to the film and skip these intros by hitting the ""next chapter"" button.  Nice!
Do get this DVD ASAP and also see Creepy Creature Double Feature Vol. 2 with THE CRAWLING HAND and THE SLIME PEOPLE.  The same excellence (and Mr. Weaver) is also there.  Cheap films, cheap price and deluxe presentation!
And, if you have read this far, you NEED the Cadillac of Monster Movies on digital discs: The VCI DVD or Blu Ray of GORGO.",1367366400,8,3045,4.390374331550802
5553183,2,B00B2M79XQ,"I watched ""Creepy Creature Double Feature Vol. 2"" before watching ""Creepy Creature Double Feature Vol. 1."" I found ""Creepy Creature Double Feature Vol. 2"" to be quite enjoyable despite the low-budget nature of the two films it contains. Thus, my expectations for ""Creepy Creature Double Feature Vol. 1,"" which features two more low-budget films, were higher than they might otherwise have been.

Alas, ""Creepy Creature Double Feature Vol. 1"" failed to meet my heightened expectations. In fact, it failed even to meet the more meager expectations I would have had if I had not watched ""Creepy Creature Double Feature Vol. 2"" first. ""Monster from the Ocean Floor,"" while crisp and sharp in this black-and-white transfer, offers little plot-wise, and is so simplistic that even its 65-minute run time seems too long for the story line. Other than a brief earlier cameo, the monster itself does not even appear until--literally--five minutes before the movie ends, and the few minutes of its lame, blurry, not-at-all-menacing tentacle-waving is a few minutes of film wasted. The production values are pretty good, the sound is okay (although some of the characters have completely different voices in different scenes), and the cast members are reasonably likeable. But their performances do little to redeem ""Monster from the Ocean Floor."" It's not a horrible movie, but its not one worth watching again in the future.

As for ""Serpent Island""--the less said about it, the better. It's awful, just awful.

I'm surprised Volumes 1 and 2 of the ""Creepy Creature Double Feature"" series are so different from each other. I expected roughly equivalent levels of quality, but such is not the case. I rated Volume 2 with five stars for its value, and for the fact that its two movies are not too bad at all. I found Volume 1, however, to be a waste of time and money.",1365465600,14,1857,4.983870967741935
5553184,5,B00B2M79XQ,"Who would have thought it possible that outtakes from The Monster from the Ocean Floor would find their way to a DVD? The whole movie looks like an outtake. But if you're in the mood to torture yourself you'll be happy to know this VCI release is terrific. Image quality is crisp and there's a good telephone interview with Roger Corman talking about the film. As for Serpent Island, since it was filmed in 16mm, this is the best print you'll ever find, done from a Medalion TV print. Incidentally, Serpent Island was photographed by Bert I. Gordon. Please know he was just as good a photographer as he was a special effects technician. Maybe better!",1364515200,10,650,4.612068965517241

8561518,3,B00B2M79XQ,"BOTTOM LINE: These are ultra-low budget quickies cranked out to make money on the drive-inn circuit back in the day. Fast, harmless time killers/wasters that are safe viewing for the whole family. Good for laughs & late night popcorn fun, they also double as a surefire cure for insomnia. Seriously though, I hope this CREEPY CREATURE DOUBLE FEATURE label becomes an ongoing product line from VCI. At least these prints used here are better than lots of other Public Domain junk I've seen over the years. 3 STARS

SERPENT ISLAND:

THE STORY (contains spoilers): A middle-aged secretary from Scranton, PA, (milky-skinned redhead Rosalind Hayes), has a family heirloom treasure map. Every generation or so someone in the family has tried for the treasure, with no luck. She's decided it's her turn: she's saved $2000 and has six weeks' worth of vacation time. On a friend's recommendation (some friend!), she hires former Marine Engineer turned drunken harbor tramp Sonny Tufts to be her guide, (good thinkin' honey - NOT!), for a flat fee of $50/day plus a percentage of the treasure. Sonny's boat is a small, beat up POS, so she has to engage the services of one Kirk Ellis (Tom Monroe) who Captains a ship big enough to make the voyage. She arranges to have Sonny hired on as a crew member. Of course, the two guys can't stand each other and both want the treasure & the girl, so it's gonna be one long, ugly voyage. Where's the treasure, you ask? Haiti. Where do Sonny & Capt. Ellis reside? San Pedro, CA! Why would anyone looking for hidden treasure in Haiti fly all the way to California to charter a ship which must then traverse halfway down the North American coastline, through the Panama Canal, and across the Gulf of Mexico to the Caribbean??? Imagine how much dough she would've saved if she'd just drove down to Florida, flown Sonny out to meet her, then chartered a boat and sailed from there!? Duh!

THOUGHTS: I had never seen SERPENT ISLAND prior to this so I took a chance. As it turns out, SERPENT ISLAND barely qualifies as a film, much less a creature feature. Technically speaking, yes, it does have a python in it towards the end. (Albeit with its poor mouth rubber-banded shut half the time in order to keep the actors from getting accidentally bitten!) Other than that it's a routine (and rather boring) ""search for hidden treasure"" potboiler. Lots of stock & shot silent footage with voice over narration by our stalwart star, that sun-baked stallion of the sea, Sonny (Cat-Women of The Moon) Tufts helps to pad out the scant 62 minute runtime. Even so, I predict you'll be checking your watch more than once during this thing. BTW... The director of photography was none other than Bert I. Gordon himself.

I have to tell you, watching a flabby, 50-something Sonny Tufts strutting around shirtless with his chest puffed out & his big belly sucked in has to qualify as some sort of video torture. Ack! Once they finally get there we are treated to endless scenes of them laying about on the beach or traipsing around the jungle while the film randomly cuts to stock footage of Haitian (we assume) locals gyrating about with dead chickens, making admittedly pretty sand drawings on the floors of their homes and generally doing naughty Voodoo-type things. Ugh. This isn't one I'll be watching again anytime soon. The only interesting thing about SERPENT ISLAND is that Sonny (in one of his seemingly endless voice over monologues), mentions the Mexican city of Zihuatanejo, (the eventual destination of Andy Dufresne, of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" fame). Neat, but hardly worth enduring 62 minutes of dreck for.

MONSTER FROM THE OCEAN FLOOR:

THE STORY: The mysterious deaths of several swimmers & wildlife at the hands of a strange ""devil"" monster said to live in a nearby cove cause concern among local fishermen types. A vacationing tourist hooks up with a disbelieving marine biologist and soon the two are in a life & death struggle with the beast.

THOUGHTS: An early Roger Corman effort. Highlight of this movie is the way-cool 2-man pedal-powered mini-sub built by Aerojet General. Man, I would've LOVED to have had this thing when I was a little kid and my family spent weekends at a friend's cottage on the lake! Beyond that nifty piece of old-school ""futuristic"" hardware, there's nothing much else really to recommend the film. Usual romantic subplot (with a stupendously bad serenade from Our Hero on the rocky beach), and lots of scenes of people swimming around pad out the movie's already mercifully brief (64min) runtime. The soundmix has issues, too. Almost all of the dialogue sounds post-recorded in a studio (or a 55 gallon drum). Also, in certain scenes the actors' voices sound pitched down a quarter octave. Some scenes play out normally, while others sound undercranked, like little kids trying to talk like adults. It's disturbing and unintentionally hilarious at the same time. Then there's the title monster itself: a really cheap-looking creation that must be seen to be believed; a warped combination of the monsters from The Crawling Eye & the alien from The Atomic Submarine. 1950's-era kids must have been woefully disappointed when they finally got to see the ""terrifying"" devil monster in all its puppet-ish, waddling glory. LOL.

THE DVD: 2-film collection is presented on a single-sided DVD. Both movies are fair looking & sounding. No bonus content for either.",1423440000,,5422,4.885869565217392

8561520,5,B00B2M79XQ,"GREAT 1950's horror/adventure double feature.  Monster from the Ocean Floor is about a girl on vacation in a village in Baja California who gets hooked on the stories of a sea monster that has been causing strange disappearances for years.  The monster is silly when you see it.  A giant octopus with one huge eye that occasionally comes out of the sea at night to hunt land creatures.  Even so, despite the silliness those moments have an eeriness to them.  The locales, no matter where they were filmed, seem authentic.  The picture, for an extremely low-budget film, looks good and the black and white photography is crisp and clear.  Serpent Island is about a young woman after gold her ancestors once stole that's on a Caribbean island.  She hires two seedy characters to help her and only one has any positive character.  They end up on said island where the gold is hidden, but the local voodooists take exception to interlopers looting their treasures.  The quality of the picture is pretty OK and probably about as good as it is ever going to get.  Fun pair of low-budget bad-movie flicks.  Highly recommended for fans of these genres.",1396224000,,1144,4.751269035532995
8561521,4,B00B2M79XQ,"Monster from the Ocean Floor is a good viewable print with good audio/video and no issues to speak of.  Serpent Island is a Medallion TV print, which is before the film starts, with overall good quality.  At the end of the film, there is a scene where Sonny is saving the girl from a serpent.  In the middle of that scene, there is a 1-2 second repeat of a fight Sonny had just before that.  Then it returns to him saving her.  This problem could have been corrected.  The Roger Corman interview and extras for ""Monster"" is worthwhile.  Full screen.",1381536000,,549,4.43
8561522,5,B00B2M79XQ,"A must-see, of course, in that it is Roger Corman's first film as a producer. Much of the film depicts the movements of a rather spiffy peddle-it-yourself submarine; and then there are endless underwater shots of actress Anne Kimbell swimming around with her aqualung -- but the idiot director and atrocious composer have set these scenes to the least suspenseful music imaginable. Imagine the exact opposite of Bernard Herrmann in a Hitchcock film. The movie also gets a star for the utterly ludicrous notion that cheery Mexican fishing villagers believe that a white gringa maiden must be sacrificed to the giant one-eyed amoeba (rarely seen, be warned) in order to satisfy the spirits of their forefather's pagan religion. Stuart Wade is just so-so as a hunkaman wannabe, and even sings a little. The thrills are -- well -- nil. Amazing, really, because Corman had a pretty solid concept of how to keep audiences entranced by a rhythm of alternating moments of calm and action. This flick has no rhythm at all: it's one big snooze. Needless to say, the special effects are minimal and calculatedly out of focus. I watched the Instant Video version with a minimally acceptable image.",1377388800,,1185,4.959798994974874
