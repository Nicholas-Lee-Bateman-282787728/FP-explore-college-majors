8687000,5,B00P8RUQMM,Mokey is my nickname a couple of my aunts had just seen the movie when I was born 1943. So yes I loved the movie,1509235200,,112,3.52
8687001,5,B00P8RUQMM,"In a world today, where a disproportionate number of young children too often become troubled, this film points so easily as to what happens when parents are not nurturing their children to the point where those children do not view their lives as being happy. Robert Blake as a youngster, gives a first-rate performance as a young boy who has problems making sound decisions. His inability to make correct decisions (without much guidance, I should add) leads him into some very unwanted situations. Donna Reed and Dan Dailey play the matter-of-fact parents.",1482710400,,559,5.086956521739131
