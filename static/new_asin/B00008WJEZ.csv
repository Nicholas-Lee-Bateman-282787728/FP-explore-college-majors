1865185,5,B00008WJEZ,I am thrilled with the release of Charlie's Angels on DVD..but let's hope that Season Two is released..after all I do consider Cheryl Ladd a original Charlie's Angel...,1054512000,,168,5.035714285714286
1865186,5,B00008WJEZ,"I can't tell you how excited I am to have the entire first season of CHARLIE'S ANGELS on DVD - 22 episodes.  Unedited and no commercials, and even the PILOT all here in one package.  So what's the scoop?
First off no need to summarize anything.  The plots were always formula - Angels get assignment, go undercover, cover blown, and all 3 have to help each other out of the jam.  Most funny is you always see the villan in the slide show at the beginning in an outfit you will be seeing them in later!  Usually a picture taken from their 1st scene.  And always expect Kate Jackson to go undercover as the dowdy one, except in the pilot where Jill plays the dorky secretary!
Extras?  Only one featurette.  No commentaries, no promotional spots, no photo galleries.  No interviews or anything added.  But the episodes look and sound better than reruns and no EDITING!  Thank you!
The movies from now are fun, but this is the first time we saw the Angels.  And with the original and best three!  Hard to believe Farrah was only there a year, because she left her mark in my mind forever.  The replacements were all fine and fit in well, but hard to beat this chemistry!  And it was there from the start of the pilot which even includes a character later dropped from the series!  Only in the pilot do you get to see Charlie's lawyer named Woodville.  He's a funny addition, and gave the show an interesting balance with 3 girls and 2 guys working on the case.  Too bad he never made it to the series!  But Bosley is enough to keep it together.
""GOOD MORNING ANGELS!""",1054166400,3,1563,4.383275261324042
1865187,4,B00008WJEZ,I was excited to finally get this on dvd only to find that the packaging is appauling!! the box the discs are in is fine but the discs come in cheap flimsy plastic blank coverings...where's the picture covers :-(like other boxsets like Buffy and Angel.,1054080000,2,252,4.622222222222222
1865188,4,B00008WJEZ,"Let me preface this review with the fact that I am huge Charlies Angels fan and have been anxiously awaiting this release for years!
I do not believe these were taken from the master, as they come across a little grainy, but I could be wrong, and with every toss of hair and judo chop I seemed to care less and less how grainy it seemed.
The two reasons I feel this DVD falls short are (1)Each disc is inside a plastic case without any artwork or photograph except a label featuring each actress (making it look as if they were bootlegged). (2)The real disapointment was the featurette which was predominantly clips spliced togteher with interviews with fans and a bunch of nobody's who some have not even seen a single episode! Not a single Angel is intervewed, not even Aaron Spelling (although Leonard Goldberg is shown occasionally).
All in all, I am glad to have these classic episodes at my fingertips and hope the second season is better packaged although Farrah is featured in only one or two episodes.",1054080000,10,1010,4.616666666666666

1865190,5,B00008WJEZ,"What can be said about CHARLIE'S ANGELS, the Primetime television series, which aired on ABC-TV, from 1976-1981, which hasn't already been said or written? Now it can be said that the FIRST of the five ESSENTIAL components of the series, Season One (1976-1977), is to be released on DVD! Hopefully the episodes will be digitally remastered from the original full-length ABC Primetime edits, instead of the excruciatingly disappointing, chopped up-edits from syndicated television.
KUDOS to whomever is responsible for getting the original ABC-TV Movie of the Week, ""CHARLIE'S ANGELS,"" (March, 1976 & September, 1976) included on this DVD release. This made-for-TV movie and Edward J. Lakso's initial 5 scripts for the following episodes are very solid and extremely important for setting the foundation of the series. Included also on the DVD release are many extras and perks, enough to keep the most avid collectors and devoted fans satisfied with the release... at least until time for the DVD release of Season Two (the time when the series increased EVEN MORE in popularity). I watched the whole series while on ABC, and like many fans, believe that the series progressively got BETTER as the seasons unfolded...
Most Charlie's Angels fans tend to have a favorite Angel, season, and/or episode. My favorites all coincided with the arrival of SHELLEY HACK as ""Tiffany Welles,"" at the beginning of Season Four in the Season Premiere Angels Movie, LOVE BOAT ANGELS (1979), from an original script titled ANGELS IN THE SUN. Tiffany's arrival was as awe-inspiring as ""Venus Rising from the Sea,"" with her fluffy Greta Garbo disco hair and all! Since this episode was recently awarded and acknowledged for excellence at the first annual TVLand Awards in March 2003 (YES!!!), I have great hope and confidence that, one day soon, we shall see LOVE BOAT ANGELS released as part of the Season Four DVD release, UNEDITED! In the September 1979 ABC airing, over an hour's worth of airtime was from footage shot in and around ST. THOMAS in the U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS. All that time, energy and money spent on the camera crew sent to The Caribbean, to shoot in the tropical heat of June 1979, is virtually wasted when the episode is split into 2 parts, and edited for syndication (the biggest crime of the whole series!). Too many of the Virgin Islands/Caribbean Sea exterior shots are cut, and too many studio shots are kept in the final syndicated edit. The same applies for the movies from various seasons, filmed in Vail, Honolulu/Hawaii, and Las Vegas. Let's just hope Columbia/Tri-Star has the forsight and fortitude to restore these treasures to their full glory! PLEASE!",1050451200,23,2666,5.0476190476190474

I think the entertainment value of the show still holds up to a satisfying degree although some of the writing and production design shows its age. All three angels are absolutely stunning and gorgeous. My biggest complaint with the product is lack of English subtitles (Product description state that there are English subtitles - that is incorrect). Also the packaging could have been much better. Each disc is in its own plastic DVD case but there are no episode list or titles listed anywhere. The overall picture quality is very good as it is digitally remastered however there are occasional artifacts here and there that show up. I wish they had cleaned them up. I think the show deserves a better edition than this and hope sometime in the future, it will get a better treatment.

I realize I may not be the moral majority here when I say that Kate Jackson is my favorite angel.  There was always something more sexy about her because she wasn't trying to be sexy.  She had such a strong presence on screen that I found I was very drawn to her.  Lynda Carter( Wonder Woman) had the same type of effect on people and not just for looks either.  These two women had very desirable personality traits that made them shine on stage.  If Kate Jackson hadn't been on the show at all, I doubt I would have even made it past the first season.  I think she was much lovelier and naturally smarter and a more cultured actress than the rest in the first 3 years. Jacklyn Smith was also extremely ladylike and very pretty as was Farrah as well.  All of them were likable and I my favorites of the first season.  Kate was a standout though.  Her character was charming and sexy but kept contained and I always wondered if that is the way she wanted to play the part.  After her three seasons and the replacement angels came, I slowly withdrew from the show.  By the time Tanya Roberts came in, the show became very tacky and dull to me but I think the writers got tired.  Tanya was extremely attractive but I still preferred Kate over Tanya and Shelly.  Shelly was more like Kate being the very smart, clever and cunning one.  Oh well, watch all seasons if you want.  It is still better than much else that's on tv today.",1412121600,,1462,4.323529411764706

1865219,5,B00008WJEZ,"Charlie's Angels is one of those shows from the late seventies that particularly stands out. More often than not this series gets a bad rap from the majority. The premise is unusual having three beautiful women fighting the bad guys without the aid from men is a bit outlandish back then, and still is today. I know many who describe Charlie's Angels as being ""corny"", but I beg to differ. The show does have a high camp value, but no one can deny that these episodes have strong and consistent stories. Season One is arguably the peak of the series, especially since the series placed third in the Nielsen ratings with an average 26.0 rating.

The first season of Charlie's Angels consists of 23 episodes, including the 90-minute pilot episode that kicks off the show. This season have episodes that define the premise of the series, especially ""Angels in Chains"", the fourth episode of the series, that plots the three women going undercover in a prison and are forced into prostitution. Other highlight episodes include: ""Lady Killer"", ""Consenting Adults"", ""The Sance"", ""Angels on Wheels"", ""Dancing in the Dark"", ""I Will Be Remembered"", and ""Angels at Sea"" among others.

I have read on numerous sites that this initial season was nicknamed ""The Farrah Season"", but I look beyond that. Although Farrah Fawcett-Majors was hugely popular and was branded a phenomenon (and my particular favorite), Kate Jackson and Jaclyn Smith are equally talented and great for the show. This season is great, my only complaint being the packaging being a cheap cardboard outer box with five separate DVD slim cases inside. That would not be so bad if the slim cases were all the same color, but they are not, all of them are different colors and have absolutely no artwork, they are see-through.",1401667200,,1781,4.894039735099338
1865220,4,B00008WJEZ,"Charlie's Angels as a TV series was based on the series of spy films(oo7,etc.) and Mission Impossible...to the extent there were 'crime fighters' working for a handler, in this case 'Charlie' and his guy.  Each week, they'd be assigned some case, breaking up some criminal enterprise, etc.  Why this wasn't left to the police was an open question.

It might surprise people unfamiliar with the show, having heard only about Jaclyn Smith and Farrah Fawcett, that it was an extremely puritanical show.  Yes, there were some short bikini scenes, but overall, it was conservative compared to say Friends or even Seinfeld.  The show dealt with straight crime fighting with a dollop of humor.  It could've been rife with demeaning exploitation of the stars, but to its credit did not.
If you're a fan from way back when and were disappointed by the movies that followed(and who wasn't?), buy this season to see why you loved the original.  Just seeing Jaclyn Smith's smile will restore your own.

This show is perfect for couples who can watch it and go back to a different time.  The show doesn't challenge you and that's to its credit.  It's just funny, adventurous, and captivating enough to entertain.  That's good enough...",1399680000,,1222,4.912195121951219

1865247,4,B00008WJEZ,"""Charlie's Angels"" was a cultural phenomenon in the first months it appeared on ABC, finishing at #5 in the TV series rankings in its first season.  In one of the most famous police/detective shows of the Seventies, Sabrina Duncan (Kate Jackson), Kelly Garrett (Jaclyn Smith), and Jill Munroe (Farrah Fawcett-Majors) worked with John Bosley (David Doyle) for the detective agency of Charles Townsend.  This DVD set contains the pilot that aired in March 1976 as well as the 22 episodes from Season One that aired from September 1976 to May 1977.

The Angels were called on by Charlie to solve some grisly crimes--murder in most cases, but the team also solved cases dealing with blackmail, rape, and prostitution.  Bosley and the Angels got themselves into tight spots and frequently had to go undercover or pose as other characters in order to help the other team members get information and successfully solve the cases.

The show was panned by some critics as being simply a dose of eye candy and not really serious, but that wasn't the case.  The episodes had good storylines, and unlike some shows that allow the viewer to ""coast"" and do not require full attention, just about all of the episodes of ""Charlie's Angels"" were good enough and tightly written enough that the viewer could easily lose track of the storyline if he let his thoughts wander for a minute or two.

""Charlie's Angels"" also featured an impressive list of guest stars during its run--Season One had appearances by David Ogden Stiers, Tommy Lee Jones, Tom Selleck, and others.  The series evoked a definite sense of setting, with the great scenery in and around Los Angeles as well as the dated Seventies cars and clothes.  Included in each of these episodes on the DVDs is the cool silhouette jingle that was shown when the episode went to a commercial break when it originally aired.

This DVD set also includes a featurette of fans recalling their memories of the show.  ""Charlie's Angels"" was eventually plagued by turnover in the cast and its audience eventually dwindled--the show was cancelled in 1981, but still managed to have a respectable five-season, 110-episode run.  The show's theme song is one of my favorite ten TV theme songs ever.  Anyone who likes police and detective television would find the series entertaining even today.",1351987200,2,2321,4.920512820512821
1865248,5,B00008WJEZ,"I must say that I have never heard of Charlie's Angels until my mother told me that it used to be one of her favorite shows as a teenager. Without looking into the show that much, I ordered this Complete First Season set stritcly on my mother's recomendation.

In the pilot episode, simply title ""Charlie's Angels,"" we meet three little girls who went to the Los Angeles police academy: Sabrina Duncan (Kate Jackson), Jill Munroe (Farrah Fawcett-Majors), and Kelly Garrett (Jaclyn Smith). These girls are hired by Charles ""Charlie"" Townsend to work as his private detective agency, Townsend & Associates. Charlie nicknames the three women Angels. In the pilot we also meet John Bosley (David Boyle), Charlie's right hand man and a overseer of the Angels. The pilot also includes Scott Woodville (David Ogden Steirs), who is something of the Angels' back-up man. This is the only time Scott appears, or even mentioned on the series.

Season one goes on to have some very exiting episodes. The first true episode, ""Hellride,"" particularly stands out. Other season highlights include: ""The Sance,"" ""Angel on Wheels,"" ""Dancing in the Dark,"" ""I Will Be Remembered,"" ""Angels at Sea,"" and the season finale, ""The Blue Angels"".

The fourth broadcast episode, ""Angels in Chains,"" sees the Angels going undercover in a women's prison to investigate the disappearance of a prison inmate. Once there, they are given many false leads and do some unique detective work. The Angels discover the warden makes the prisoners work as prostitutes and that the girl they were searching for was killed. I won't ruin the rest for you, though. This is probably the best episode of the entire series, because it completely defines what you'd think Charlie's Angels is all about.

Overall, this is a very good season full of great episodes to start off a wonderful show. I think it works because it one of the girls personifies a different image: Sabrina is your intelligent and tomboyish one, Jill your seductive, sporty, and somewhat naive one, and Kelly is your sensitive and overly caring Angel.

1865251,3,B00008WJEZ,"Having grown up with the series when it originally aired (the series debuted on my birthday in September 1976!), I have been a fan since the beginning. So when the series finally started being released on DVD- I was thrilled!! Now first off this series debuted 35 years ago this year. The writing, the sets, the clothes...everything is going to seem VERY dated. But that is just part of the charm of Charlie's Angels. The series actually began as a 2 hour TV movie in March of 1976. The ratings were so huge the series was then ordered. Thankfully drastic changes were made between the TV movie and the series debut episode. The character of Woodville-a very starchy and BORING guy-was the main contact for the angels and Charlie. Bosley was there too but clearly there did not need to be 2 bridges to Charlie so they kept just Bosley. Wise decision. David Doyle's sparkling, endearing and befuddling portrayal of Bosley never lost its charm from season to season. Whereas Woodville wore out his welcome within minutes of appearing on screen. Also the angels gained more and more control over their assignments. Initially the men (Charlie, Bosley, Woodville) told them ""you will go here. you will be undercover as this"". The little women under the men's thumb. But once the series came about- episode by episode the girls took control. This was very much unheard of at the time. Sabrina Duncan-the high school cheerleader, formerly married, knows decent Spanish, has a knack for wacky undercover assignments and quickly became the unofficial leader of the angels. She knew how to jump into a case more so than Kelly or Jill. While more likely to be consertatively dressed- Sabrina was a tough cookie. Kelly Garrett- the orphaned little girl who hung with some rough characters in her young adult years (Re: dated a car thief once) was really wet behind the ears when the series began. In Season 1 she tried real hard but wasn't always sure of herself. Thankfully her confidence grew as the series did as well. Jill Munroe- the no bra wearing, fluffy blonde haired dynamo. She was all giggles, wiggles and cotton candy. A nuturing role model to young athletic girls but never came across as a serious investigator. She was the most likely angel to sneak in a room, open a closet and then leave without closing the closet door. Hence tipping off a suspect that someone was on to them. Jill was spunky and a free spirit. The angels really did seem like friends. Their chemistry was unmistakeable. Looking at the series as a whole- this was my least favorite season. Why? I didn't get caught up in Farrah fever and the future angels all seemed more into their roles as investigators. Jill didn't. I never warmed to her as much as all the others angels. Still- this show no matter the season was good clean fun!!",1304294400,3,2807,4.718940936863544
1865252,5,B00008WJEZ,"""Charlie's Angels: The Complete First Season"" was one of the first TV-on-DVD box sets I ever bought and since 2003 I have watched a few episodes here and there, finally having finished viewing them all recently.

Compared to the plastic slim cases used for almost all DVD releases today, this bulky set looks positively archaic. There are six discs and each of them is housed in its own separate plain plastic snapcase. This set could have easily been condensed into half the size, but to be fair, at the time of its original release, the studios were still experimenting with different ways to package these sets.

The episodes themselves are unedited and look brighter and clearer than they ever did on TV, though they are not perfect.

The original 90-minute pilot telefilm is included, and while it lays the groundwork, it's not as entertaining as the episodes that came after.

There was a magic chemistry among the three original Angels during this first season, and the show was an instant ratings hit. After 1976 turned into '77, it seemed Angel-Mania exploded and the ladies appeared on every magazine cover imaginable; the toy production was not far behind.

Kate, Farrah and Jaclyn shine in every episode this season and some of my favorites include:

""Lady Killer"": My favorite of the season. A great script that sort of parodies Hugh Hefner and Playboy but with Hugh O'Brian as the publisher of ""Feline"" magazine. Jill goes undercover as a centerfold. The script has clever dialogue, great action sequences and a ""twist"" ending--all the marks of a great episode.

""The Seance"": Kelly goes undercover as an heiress and while under hypnosis is forced to revisit her unhappy childhood in an abusive orphanage. I love how Sabrina and Jill show genuine concern as Kelly spirals out of control.

""Dancing in the Dark"": Jill teaches disco, Kelly joins a blackmail ring, and Sabrina plays a nerdy victim while Dennis Cole plays the handsome villain.

""Angels at Sea"": Frank Gorshin plays a homicidal maniac who plants three bombs on a luxury liner. Another great team episode that ends with each of the Angels diffusing a bomb.

""Angels in Chains"": The prison episode with guest inmate Kim Basinger--'nuff said.

The first season found a more gritty feel to most of the episodes. It's too bad they lost some good writers like Barney Rozenzweig because from Season 2 onward, the show seemed ""cleaned up and dumbed-down"" a little for the younger viewers, when it moved to 9pm instead of 10.

There's also a fun featurette that looks back on the show. Only downside to it is that it barely touches on the contribution of Cheryl Ladd, Shelley Hack and Tanya Roberts.

Still, if you want to see why ""Charlie's Angels"" became an instant pop-culture phenomenon or you're a child of the '70s looking for a good retro buzz, this set will do the trick.",1299801600,4,2847,4.845360824742268
1865253,5,B00008WJEZ,"If you're on this page, you probably already know that this show is about 3 women (Kate Jackson, Farrah Fawcett, and Jaclyn Smith) in the police department who were underused, and then they get hired by a private investigation firm owned by Charlie.

What makes this show so great is that it is full of interesting contradictions. While Sabrina Duncan (Jackson), Jill Munroe (Fawcett), and Kelly Garret (Smith) are good at their jobs, they aren't afraid to let emotion and vulnerability into their characters.

Bosley is uptight and stiff in the office and about money. But he often goes into these hilarious acting roles (for the purpose of helping with the investigation). He's been a high roller, a wealthy Boss Hogg type, and one time he cried 'really hard' at a staged funeral.

Charlie is also a contradiction. He seems respectful towards the angels, but yet he won't let them see him. (One is entitled to wonder if he is playing God.) And while he seems a champion of women's abilities, he is almost always 'using one' during conversations. Charlie is a good boss to the angels, but he won't let them see him.

While Charlie is professional, he also has compassion. In ""The Big Tap-Out"" he is willing to do a job for a friend for not so much money. In ""Target Angels"" he is clearly concerned for Jackson, Fawcett, and Smith. In ""Dancing In the Dark,"" he is compassionate and sympathetic towards a widow who has had her life savings stolen.

The chemistry is also there. We have Sabrina Duncan (Jackson) who is a thinker, Kelly Garret (Smith) who is kind and vulnerable, and Jill Munroe (Fawcett) who often has a comeback line.

Many people consider ""Angels In Chains"" the defining episode. But I would be quicker to give that award to ""Target Angels."" All 3 of them have some good screen time, we see why holding a relationship is difficult for them, we meet Sabrina's father and x husband, Bosley is uptight about money, but then he has a funny moment when he cries 'too heavily' at a staged funeral, the Angels uncover a plot against Charlie, and they miss seeing Charlie by seconds. The end is great as they run after his car screaming: ""Charlie you get back here!""

Without going through every episode, ""Dancing In The Dark"" is a good one where all 3 of them have some screentime, and Bosley gets to act as a proper rich man, and then a con-artist.

""Angel Trap"" is an interesting episode in that we are permitted some sympathy for the villain being set up.

In ""The Big Tap-Out"" they also have good screentime, and we get to see Bosley ham it up as a wealthy Boss Hogg type.

All in all, this is a great tribute to the wonderful Farrah Fawcett. It's too bad that she only stayed one season.",1284336000,,2702,4.575569358178054

It's so refreshing to watch a show that shows ladies with natural beauty and class without the trash which is all that's on tv today. It's also nice to see people of so many different age groups and backgrounds cast in the story lines, unlike today where most everyone looks eternally young and plastic and is younger than 35.

Watching the angels each week gave me the idea that a girl COULD be beautiful, wear great clothes, have fabulous hair and still kick someone's butt and have an awesome career in something like the police field.  I never went that route, but it opened up a whole generation of girls eyes into believing in themselves for whatever they chose to do.  Each week I tuned in to see what exciting adventure the gals would find themselves in, and although there are episodes that have some corny possibilities in them, this show was meant to entertain.  It still does, 30 years later.  I am sad that Farrah Fawcett was only in season 1, as I think she added a lot to the show with her character, and of course - us girls were just wanting THAT HAIR.  Have some fun, go back in time 30+ years, and watch the first season of Charlie's Angels, which in my opinion, is the best season.",1251504000,,945,4.365714285714286

1865272,5,B00008WJEZ,"i was watching the farrah tribute marathons this week-end and had such a fun time with it that i ordered the first season.  hadn't really watched it since it aired (when i was in middle school-- what a perfect age for this show (i'm a dude)) and was really surprised by how enjoyable it is.  sure, it's as formulaic as they come, but the cast had great chemistry, the actors acquitted themselves quite nicely, and the show was actually pretty funny (intentionally-- as well as unintentionally of course).  and the music was really great (parts actually reminded me of lost's music-- giacchino must have studied 70's t.v. music).  plus, you gotta love all the cars crashing down some hill and totally exploding!  and then there's all the no-bras and bikinis(kinda the bread and butter of the show, i guess).

anyway, this is a super-fun show that has all the best the 70's had to offer.  and you'll be surprised at how fun and innocent and, oddly enough, how girl-power it is.

too bad there's no commentaries(the original angels on a couple of the best eps would have been priceless) or in depth documentaries or making-ofs, but oh well.  at least we have have this classic show.

and a quick word about farrah.  she was never my favorite-- to my 10-year-old eyes kelly was the most beautiful and sabrina was the coolest.  but watching these again it's easy to see why she was such a colossal sensation.  of course she was great lookin', but she was also really funny, flirtatious (in the good, innocent kind of way), and just had this honest, fun way about her.  and man, that smile just dazzled.  rest in peace farrah fawcett.",1246233600,4,1628,4.643356643356643
1865273,5,B00008WJEZ,"""Charlie's Angels"" is the best television crime drama that ever aired on the commercial broadcast networks. Debuting on ABC on September 22, 1976, the series quickly became one of TV's biggest hits, propelling all of its stars to superstardom, most notably Farrah Fawcett who became an international celebrity. The three leads of the show even graced the cover of ""Time"" magazine, a rare feat for a cops and robbers show.
 It was Fred Silverman who gave the green light to ""Charlie's Angels"", as it was he who headed up the network. Originally called ""Alley Cats"", it was designed for a vehicle for Kate Jackson, who had just finished a supporting role run on ABC's ""The Rookies"". It was actually Kate who came up with the change in the series' title, as she suggested using the word angel in the opening sequence. ""Charlie's Angels"" had the kind of ratings that ""American Idol"" now has, and the series ended that first season at #5 in the Nielsens with a whopping 18.4 rating. Millions tuned into the series every week as they watched as three female undercover police officers tackled the bad guys. The show was the first of its kind in that no other television show featured three women in the main leads doing what men had done before. ""Charlie's Angels"" opened the door for other women in television, and it is still regarded today as one of the most beloved crime series ever. The last of the three leads, Jacklyn Smith, also became a star, who would go onto leads in movies made for TV. The voice of Charlie was none other than Blake from ""Dynasty"", John Forsythe, and the opening music is one of the most haunting of all-time.
 The first season's boxset is beautiful, featuring all 22 episodes, as well as the original pilot movie that aired in the spring of 1976, that also has a new opening. Each disc in the boxset has it's own individual case made of hard plastic, so the DVD's themselves will last a lifetime from not being scratched.

1865287,5,B00008WJEZ,"When Charlie's Angels made it's debut in 1976, I had just turned 10 years old. Me and my friends would watch every episode of Season One as if it were required by law!  We convinced our parents to buy us the trading cards, the t-shirts, the magazines, the posters, the stickers that we  placed on our school notebooks, and anything else the merchandising industry would churn out.  Like it or not, the introduction of Charlie's Angels made an enormous impact on pop culture in the 1970's.

A couple of years ago, I noticed the Season One set at a local retailer and purchased it simply because the price was right.  To be quite honest, the front cover of the box also hooked me.  I really didn't remember any details of the show and just thought that I would set it aside for a rainy day.  Finally, that rainy day came and I decided to start watching it while working out on my elliptical trainer in the evenings.  The first few episodes were a bit dull, however, it did not take long for me to remember why I loved watching my Angels in the 1970's.

There are two very good reasons to buy this set.  The first is that watching Charlie's Angels is just plain fun.  The plots are not too heavy, there is plenty of action, the dialogue is light and campy, and anytime anyone is murdered or killed, YOU ARE NOT FORCED TO WITNESS A BLOOD-BATH!  (Sorry ""Law and Order"" Fans.)  Oh yes, I forgot to mention the SEX APPEAL didn't I?  While the show is most certainly full of ""eye-candy"" it is nothing compared to what you see on television today.

The second reason to purchase this set is because Charlie's Angels takes you back to the highest form of glamour and glitz that existed in the 1970's.  (The good, the bad, and the absurd.)  The Angels are beautiful, the automobiles are enormous, the decor is hideous, the hair-styles are gigantic, and the clothing...WHAT IN THE WORLD WERE THEY THINKING?  Then again, what were any of us thinking?

Charlie's Angels was a concept that could not fail and I am quite certain that if you purchase this set, you will agree with me.",1219190400,3,2067,4.464

The dvd has adequate extras like the featurette Angels Forever. I would of like to have seen some current interviews with the stars as well as some behind the scenes clips. The restoration of the series on this dvd collection is great however the packaging is abysmmal and disappointing! If you consider what a cultural juggernaut Charlie's Angels was and the constant media coverage of the show I cannot believe this collection was put together so shabbily! The dvds come housed in see through plastic slimline dvd cases no images of the girls and the dvd cases (five in all) are held together at the spine with a sticker with the logo of the show which after a few times of use peels off. The packaging is cheezier than the polyester and Ford Pinto's on the show! Obviously it's the show that matters but when I see in stores much lesser shows get the royal treatment as far as packaging goes it just stings a little because I'll never have my Farrah poster again!

Charlie's Angels helped changed the face of Police Drama and it also helped inspire young and old women to become cops and detectives.

The series was Created by the late Ivan Goff and the late Ben Roberts who also Produced the CBS Sci-Fi Drama Series Logan's Run Starring Gregory Harrison and Heather Menzies Urich and it was also Produced by Leonard Goldberg and the late Aaron Spelling and it is now in the hands of Columbia TriStar and SONY!

Kate Jackson (Spelling's The Rookies and Scarecrow & Mrs. King) and 2 young Texans Farrah Fawcett (Former Mrs. Lee Majors) and Jaclyn Smith (Former Mrs. Roger Davis) were THE Best!

My favorite Episodes includes The Pilot Movie, Angels in Chains, The Vegas Connection and my all time personal favorite BULLSEYE!

The 1st Season also featured many Guest Stars including Diana Muldaur (Star Trek Alumnus), Tommy Lee Jones (The Fugitive, Men in Black and Double Jeopardy) Bo Hopkins, Tom Selleck (Magnum P.I.), David Huddleston (Santa Claus: The Movie) Kim Basinger (Batman and Cool World), Hugh O'Brian (The Legend of Wyatt Earp), Logan Ramsey, the late John vanDreelan, Renee Auberjonois (Benson, Star Trek: DSN, Disney's The Little Mermaid), Sidney Clute (Cagney & Lacey), the late Robert Donner (Mork & Mindy) the late Richard Mulligan (SOAP & Empty Nest), Marla Pennington (Small Wonder), Robert Pine (""CHiPs""), Jenny O'Hara (As the World Turns), Dirk Benedict (Battlestar Galactica and The A-Team) Laurette Spang (Battlestar Galactica) M*A*S*H Stars G.W. Bailey and David Ogden Stiers and it also featured Special Guest Stars like Neva Patterson, Dennis Cole (Jaclyn Smith's 2nd Husband), Rosemary Forsyth, Carla Borelli (Another World, Texas and Falcon Crest), Jan Shutan, and Ed Lauter (The Longest Yard) and it also featured Special Appearances by the likes of Fernando Lamas (Father of Falcon Crest and Renegade Star Lorenzo Lamas) Robert Lipton and the late Frank Gorshin (Batman's Original Riddler).

and BTW, Dirty Business was Directed by the late Bill Bixby (The Courtship of Eddie's Father) and To Trap an Angel and The Blue Angels were Directed by Kate's Co-Star from The Rookies Georg Stanford Brown.

1865291,4,B00008WJEZ,"There is great television that captures the imagination with its complicated characters and plots.  Then there are shows like this one that are mindless, fluff entertainment but completely fun in their own cheesy way.

The show focuses on three female police officers who quit their boring police jobs to work for mysterious millionaire Charlie Townsend (voiced by the never really seen John Forsyth).  Sabrina (Kate Jackson), Jill (Farrah Fawcett), and Kelly (Jaclyn Smith) now work as private detectives handling cases for people who turn to Charlie for help.  That usually requires the three of them to go undercover to gather the clues needed.  Assisting them in any way needed is Bosley (David Doyle).

So what kind of cases do they take on in this season?  Well, there's the aging film starlet who keeps seeing scenes from her old movies.  There's the case of the rag doll strangler.  The centerfolds at Feline Magazine keep dying.  Jill goes undercover at a roller derby.  And in the most famous episode of the season, the three ladies get themselves arrested to discover the fate of a woman arrested and never heard from again.

While the series will never be mistaken for great television, it is fun.  The acting is decent, at least from the leads.  And there's an impressive display of guest stars including a young Tommy Lee Jones, Kim Basinger, and Tom Selleck.

Unfortunately, the stories sometimes leave a little something to be desired from a mystery standpoint.  Many of the cases are solved by coincidence with the details being explained to us in the last few minutes.  A couple of the episodes are clunkers, like ""The Big Tap-Out"" which is boring the entire way through.  And some of the guest actors are so over the top it really gets annoying.

Fans will enjoy watching this set, which contains the original two hour long pilot plus all 22 first season episodes.  The only extra, a documentary on the popularity of the series, isn't that special.

This show is not great television.  It was popular because it was fun.  And, if you can ignore some of the flaws, it really still is.",1187481600,3,2102,4.810055865921788

Mike Bell (voice of many cartoon characters in 70s and 80s) appears in two episodes as angel Sabrina Duncan's ex husband Sgt Bill Duncan.

I like Charlie's Angels primarily for the music.

In advancing the feminist movement, the producers failed to create one solid male character in the entire five seasons, for viewers like myself to identify with (Sorry, but Bosley clearly doesn't qualify). The Angels continue to fall in love with criminals and uninspiring characters for the five seasons.  And why do we have to see Charlie's endless womanizing at an extremely shallow level?

The greatest weakness is the lack of continuity and character development between episodes. We really see 22 isolated stories. Sadly the serialized writing which made 90s and 2000s shows so much better was done at the cost of spending money on any good music in the modern shows. WHICH IS WHY CHARLIE'S ANGELS IS GREAT FOR ITS INCIDENTAL MUSIC ALONE. Buy it.

My personal favorite season one plot line involves Kelly Garrett helping an orphan boy, who later locates his mother and her new fiance.

Still well worth watching these. Dirk Benedict of Galactic fame guest stars in a later episode, and again in a season 2 episode.

1865294,5,B00008WJEZ,"Long before Magnum, PI put Tom Selleck on the map, Charlie's Angels owned the world of TV private eyes. Nominated for 4 Emmys and 7 Golden Globes, including 2 for Best TV Series - Drama, Charlie's Angels was a truly rare overnight sensation. The forerunner to modern day shows such as La Femme Nikita and Alias, creators Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts capped off long careers as showbiz writers by penning the unforgettable story of three sexy and vivacious private investigators. Executive producer Aaron Spelling (linked to innumerable hit shows such as Beverly Hills 90210, The Love Boat, Melrose Place, Dynasty, 7th Heaven, and Charmed among others) played a prominent role in the pop culture explosion of this series which witnessed the immediate mass marketing of Charlie's Angels trading cards, posters, lunchboxes, and endless other memorabilia - including a full-length feature film of the same name two decades later (2000). Through the duration of the series (five seasons), the cast changed continuously as Charlie's angels became media stars in their own right and left to pursue various opportunities in modeling, film, and TV...

Charlie's Angels centers around a group of gorgeous female ex-police officers hired to work for the Charles Townsend Detective Agency. A mysterious multi-millionaire with seemingly unlimited means, Charles Townsend communicates with his girls via speaker-phone and through the aid of his personal assistant, John Bosley (David Doyle). Charlie sends the girls on various undercover missions and dangerous assignments where they apprehend criminals and pursue justice with a vengeance. The original angels are Sabrina Duncan (Kate Jackson) who plays the role of the ""smartest"" angel, Kelly Garrett (Jaclyn Smith) who plays the part of the ""street-smart"" angel, and Jill Munroe (Farrah Fawcett) who plays the role of the ""athletic"" angel. Together, they unleash their collective talents on the criminal underworld, putting their own lives at risk in process... As the show progressed, Jill Munroe left as a regular on the series and was replaced by her sister Kris (Cheryl Ladd). The following year, Sabrina left the agency to tend to her family and was replaced by Tiffany (Shelley Hack) and later by Julie (Tanya Roberts)...

1865306,5,B00008WJEZ,"Charlie Angels rocked and I get really mad when people criticize it, saying it was jiggle tv. It wasn't meant to be Shakespeare,thank God!!! This show was pure mindless fun, with beautiful women that were strong, smart, and sexy. This show paved the way for female leads in the male dominated cop show genre. The packaging on this dvd set is excellent. The episodes are crisp with great sound quality.

My only complaint was it would have been nice to have included the Charlie's Angels documentary that ran on TV Land a couple of years ago. They interviewed all the angels from the series, except Farrah ofcourse(We all know her story).

Poor Farrah! She was the most beautiful angel in many people's opinion, but Lord! Farrah has not aged well at all. She should have did what Betty Page did when her beauty  faded,by completey dropping out of the spotlight, so we had the pleasure of remembering her the way she was. When I saw a glimpse of Farrah on her reality show ""Chasing Farrah I was horrified at how old she looked!!! I immediately thought perhaps TV Land was just plain desperate to milk what little was left of Farrah Fawcetts past glory, because this broad looked as old as Aaron Spelling!!!

Well, it's nice to see that the other angels have held up very nicely. Jaclyn Smith still looks fantastic!!!! I look forward to purchasing the second season, considering Cheryl Ladd was the perfect replacement for Farrah, and in my opinion the storylines were even better!!!!",1115856000,6,1481,4.728682170542636
1865307,5,B00008WJEZ,"This is a great DVD set to own and always fun to watch with a group of friends.  It was the hottest thing at the time and may be a little predictable and campy now in retrospect but that is part of the fun of watching it.

The packaging could be a little better (like the Wonder Woman series is) but still a must have for any fan of the show or 70's TV in general.",1114214400,6,364,3.776315789473684

The shows are classic ""who dunnit's"".  If you are a fan of Scooby Doo, the Hardy Boys, the Rockford Files, etc...you'll love these.

They could have used a better technical expert on the set back then.  These ladies are terribly unsafe with their firearms.  Guess nobody told them you are supposed to keep your finger OFF the trigger until ready to fire.

If you like Charlie's Angels, or pop culture of the 70's in general, this is a must have collection.",1102291200,4,637,4.7889908256880735
1865309,5,B00008WJEZ,"This is a great DVD. It really shows how much the original Angels complimented each other. Farrah was and still is my favorite Angel.

1865310,5,B00008WJEZ,"Fans of 1970s tv won't want to miss this great DVD of the campy series.

1865311,5,B00008WJEZ,"What we have here is a trip back to 70's television. I picked this set up more for nostalgia than anything else. Well I have to admit that I am very pleased with my purchase of ""Charlie's Angels"" Season One on DVD. The picture and sound are clear and crisp and better than what I remember watching on TV. In this excellent 5 single sided disc boxed set you get the original pilot episode plus all 22 remaining Season One episodes without the commercials.

I've always thought Sabrina was hot for some reason, just something about her. Join the original ""Charlie's Angels"" Farrah Fawcett, Kate Jackson and Jaclyn Smith as they get into some sticky situations doing Charlie's dirty work. I don't mind the packaging and haven't had any problems with the discs. There really isn't much in the way of bonus features for this Season One DVD release; just one bonus featurette has been included.

The Studio should have approached the original angels and had them do interviews or commentaries for the set. A where are they now feature or photo gallery would have been a nice addition to this set. These are the only ""Charlie's Angels"" for me now and forever! If you want to see good clean family entertainment 70's style, pick up your set today. ""Once Upon a Time"" you know the rest.

NO ""plot,"" no ""story line,"" just 45 glorious minutes a week of, ahem, ""gazing"" at Jill, Sabrina, and Kelly. And Kate Jackson - I love you!

The day Charlies Angels Season one came out, it was a few days after my birthday, and it became mine with a gift card from best buy, and i have seen all the episodes from this collcetion. Yes Jill was my favorite angel, and this package is well worth being in my library of DVD's. I will agree that the fact that the episodes are not subdivided into seperate chapters is a little dissappointing, but when you have the enitre season on the shelf to see, it is well worth the wait, The original pilot to see is a plus in my book, as well as the ""Angels Forever"" featurette. I did find out season two is coming out, and yahoo!!! they were as much fun to watch as the first season, but please lets see some personal interviews with the stars and maybe some of the commercials that came out when it was first airred. If you are an Angels fan, get this set, it is worth every penny spent.",1075507200,6,975,4.164021164021164
1865324,5,B00008WJEZ,"This was one of my absloute favorite shows growing up and I was shocked to see that the whole season was out. Well I knew I just had to have it. I think it was totally cool of them to put in the original pilot, since a lot of the shows don't include that. How else will we know how it all began? My only complaint is that there are no extras with any of the cast members, just a silly featurette with people who I've never even heard of. I hope that season two will include a lot more goodies than this one did. My advice is that if you're a true fan of this show, the little bit of money that it costs compared to the other shows that are out on DVD is completely worth it to me! Now that I own it I recognize a lot of people who became stars in the 80s that made guest appearances in many of these episodes. Be sure to check it out!",1075334400,3,834,3.8265895953757227

The series definitely open-up lots of opportunities for all the actors involved especially the Angels and you can see by watching this innovative show why it became so huge. It maybe pallid to compare the show in today's current style of television but no other stars shines likes the Angels.
Impressive, I would say, in the series is Jaclyn Smith. Farrah Fawcett maybe the breakthrough star of the show and the lovely Kate Jackson maybe the most assertive angel but Smith is such a pleasure to watch. She's gorgeous, sophisticated and sexy --all in one and there's this sexiness that appeals to all ages.

1865328,4,B00008WJEZ,"Just having the full first season of Charlie's Angels on DVD is awesome.  Any one of these episodes is right there at your fingertips, with clear pictures and sound -- and no commercials!
A few negatives:
  1) No sub-titles. The closed-captions are there, but on many TVs it's impossible to bring those up without muting the TV, which somewhat defeats the purpose.
  2) The packaging is flimsy and a little difficult to deal with.
  3) No ""extras"" or interviews (the ""Angels Forever"" featurette is just interviews with fans, and the trailers for the recent Angels movies are dull).
However, spending too much time complaining about those three things will overshadow my first point:  having the entire first season of the Angels on DVD is incredible, and well worth the highly reasonable price.",1065571200,5,794,4.962121212121212

It is nice to be able to time warp back to the 70's with Charlie's Angels, who were definately a childhood idol of mine!!! A few dissapointements about this dvd collection were that none of the Angels were interviewed, and it would be nice to have some previews of each later season. I hope that the original Angels will be interviewed, and asked to tell about the way each of them felt about doing the series, and what was it like to work with each other. they had such great chemistry on the set together, but what were they like behind the scenes? Was it fun acting out such heroic women? What would be really neat I think would be to get all the 4 main Angels, that being Sabrina, Kelly, Jill, and Kris to do a few small ""modern"" episodes...only too bad Bosley who I am so used to and also loved will have to be played by a different actor....but I think that would be neat if they will make another show in the 21st century...the modern charlie's Angels with Drew, Cameron, and Lui is great of course, and action packed....but theres no replacing the ones I remember and loved so much...Please make dvd's of the entire 5 seasons.

CONCLUSION
If you grew up watching these shows you will be pleased with how they look now on DVD and enjoy them a lot. Sure there are not really any substantive extras that are found on more expensive boxed sets like Babylon 5 or Star Trek:TNG, but at this price it is a minor issue.",1059696000,2,431,4.333333333333333

I've always loved the entire series, all five seasons, but I must admit, the first season is my favorite. It's very good. Maybe because the show was fresh and just starting out, or perhaps it was Farrah's awesome hair... Now, that it's on DVD, it's better than ever. If you love either the '70s or pop-culture, you should buy it. If you're a fellow ""Charlie's Angels"" fan, you HAVE to buy it!

1865334,5,B00008WJEZ,"Before Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz and Lucy Lu had there 2 Charlie's Angels films, there were real crime fighters, the 1976 Charlie's Angels, who actually faught normally, not flying off motor bikes and jumping in the air in slow motion to end up doing some impossible drop kick, they were normal, humans who faught realistically and when they got caught they didn't break bars off of walls to fight like Cameron did in part 1, they found a clever act to get them out, distraction, or threatened whoever with a gun...Very classic show, just wish the new ones would stop joking around and make a realistic sequel. The DVD for season 1 is very good and there is a nice featurette, the image quality was good and the sound quality was clear and loud, I am very pleased that the DVD came out so well, can't wait for season 2. Buy this set, the msrp is 49.99, but you get 1,160 hours of shows plus the original pilot (23 episodes) on 5 discs. Great series with good plots and action scenes that are real (I could imagine the scene where Kelly jumps away from the car with Dillan (Drew) in it, she would jump over it, kick into the glass, punch the guy in the car, they would fall over a ledge and are on the way to the ocean when suddenly Dillan opens the door, jumps out and lands on a bush...I'm sorry, but the new ones are so ridiculous, I had to say that!",1057708800,5,1358,4.287937743190661

1865338,4,B00008WJEZ,"It's great to have this 5-disc complete first season compilation on DVD. Although no one will confuse Charlie's Angels with ""quality"" television (this show was never meant to be taken seriously), this campy series is just plain fun, even 27 years later. Most episodes are light on plotline but the appeal of it's three stars make up for that. Kate Jackson, Farrah Fawcett-Majors and Jaclyn Smith have a chemistry unmatched by any of the future Angel pairings. Season One contains the series most ""infamous"" episode, ""Angels in Chains."" Every single ""women in prison"" cliche is here......the brutal prison matrons, the leacherous sheriff and deputy, the crooked warden and of course the obligatory shower scene. This is probably the highlight of the season.
  This DVD collection gets high marks for including the original movie pilot. Although the pilot movie is just average, I haven't seen it since it first aired, so it was a nice bonus. Although Jaclyn Smith is featured prominently in the pilot, it was meant to be a showcase for Kate Jackson. Kate (for whom the series was created) was originally supposed to play Kelly Garrett but decided to play Sabrina at the last minute, thus Jaclyn Smith gets most of the screen time in the movie.
  Unfortunately, the pilot movie is the best that can be said about the extras in the DVD collection. It also contains a rather dull featurette called ""Angels Forever"" which consists of a lot of geeky fans reminiscing about the series. TV Land and the E network had much better features about the series. Alas none of the stars are featured offering their thoughts on the series. The DVD also does not contain chapter selections for each episode, which is rather irritating. The packaging of the collection is certainly sparse as well. Each disc is contained in a flimsy plastic cover. Hopefully Sony Entertainment will correct these issues in future seasons.

  I suspect the appeal of this series lies predominantly with those of us who remember when it first aired in the 1970s. Today, it's hard to believe this innocent, cheesey little show caused as much controversy as it did. It's nice to see that Chucky's girls are still fun to watch after all these years.",1055894400,47,2208,4.887700534759358
1865339,3,B00008WJEZ,"It is an extremely great pleasure to have the first season of Charlie's Angels on DVD. I have already spent an entire weekend with the Angels, and loved reliving what constitutes a formidable and formative aspect of my wasted youth. The funny thing is, the episodes are not all that great when viewed back-to-back -- I had no idea there were that many file cabinets in the entire world that needed to be unlocked by those magic, angelic fingers. I was also surprised at how deathly slow the pilot is. I remember it being a lot quicker and sharper. However, Jaclyn Smith is a joy here in what is mostly a solo outing.
In fact, Smith comes out the best of all three Angels in this collection -- Farrah Fawcett-Majors is a known quantity and we all know Kate Jackson is much better than the material, which she proves episode after episode. But Smith's performances have surprising nuance and lend considerable scope to showcase her talents. I was surprised how easily she moves from elegant grace to hometown girl to edgy worldweariness. She plays a busty bubblehead for a few scenes in ""Hellride"" that approaches comic genius, and her turn as a giggly starlet in ""Dirty Business"" is just as good. She is at her best as a husky-voiced shakedown artist, but she truly gains my love when she belts an Amazon Scandanavian in the guts at the climax of ""The Killing Kind"" and gives an over-the-shoulder cynical purr that is devastating. The producers were right to choose that scene to run in the opening credits of every episode.
Who puts out a DVD in this day and age without subtitles? Not that the dialogue is overly complex or the sound overwhelming, but come on! The one (1) extra on this set leaves a lot to be desired: a ""documentary"" featuring none-too-masculine boys (re)living their prepubescence and none-too-feminine girls expressing their nascient feminism. I didn't expect audio commentary, but I expected more than this hagiography of fandom. Of which I too stand guilty, of course. Hopefully, the next time round, more people actually involved in the show will have something to say.",1054598400,25,2093,4.7845303867403315

7987575,4,B00008WJEZ,"""Charlie's Angels"" was such a ground-breaking, marvelous and unique private detective television series.

Kate Jackson was perfect in the role of Los Angeles police academy graduate Sabrina Duncan.
Farrah Fawcett was perfect in the role of Los Angeles police academy graduate Jill Munroe.
Jaclyn Smith was perfect in the role of Los Angeles police academy graduate Kelly Garrett.
David Doyle was perfect in the role of John Bosley.

John Forsythe provided the voice of their boss, the unseen Charles Townsend,
who directed the 'Angels' crime-fighting operations over a speaker-phone.

I rated this 5-disc DVD set just four stars because I'm not a fan of the packaging that was used for it.
There is a cardboard slip-cover case that holds five different slim plastic DVD cases inside.
Each of the slim plastic DVD cases hold just one disc each.
Unfortunately, all five of the slim plastic DVD cases have absolutely no cover artwork.
I would have rated this 5-disc DVD set five stars if all five of the slim plastic DVD cases had cover artwork.
The discs are numbered #1, #2, #3, #4 and #5.
Each of the five discs have cover artwork.
The cover artwork of each of the five discs lets anyone know exactly which episodes are on each disc.

Bonus Featurette: Angels Forever - 20:37

It appears that all 23 of these episodes were presented in uncut form on this Sony Pictures Home Entertainment 5-disc DVD set.

There weren't any teasers included in any of the episodes on this 5-disc DVD set.
It might be possible that each of the 23 episodes didn't have teasers when these episodes originally aired on ABC.

Sadly, Farrah Fawcett departed ""Charlie's Angels"" following the end of the first season.
She didn't appear in seasons two and five.
She appeared in just three episodes in season three and then she appeared in just three episodes in season four.
She appeared in just 29 episodes of ""Charlie's Angels"" overall.

The bonus featurette ""Angels Forever"" was a waste of my time because Kate Jackson, Farrah Fawcett, Jaclyn Smith, Cheryl Ladd,
Shelley Hack and Tanya Roberts all had absolutely nothing to do with it.

""Angels Forever"" mostly features interviews with fans.
The only good thing about this lousy featurette is that ""Charlie's Angels"" executive producer Leonard Goldberg was interviewed for it.

The picture quality and audio quality on this 5-disc DVD set are both good.

Notable guest stars from the 90-minute pilot episode of ""Charlie's Angels"" were David Ogden Stiers, Diana Muldaur and Tommy Lee Jones.

After the 2000 feature film which starred Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore & Lucy Liu I wanted to see the source material. I was immediately impressed with the acting and the tone of the show. The DVD Set came in excellent condition.",1483056000,,297,4.622641509433962
7987577,3,B00008WJEZ,I did not watch this show when it first came out.  I was a sophomore in school and a lot of my friends were talking about it.  I started watching it and getting into it.  And it is good to have all the seasons on dvd.  This started the Farrah Fawcett craze and seeing her t-shirts and posters all over the place.  Although Kate Jackson was set up to be the star.  I really didn't have a favorite among the three of them.  This is a good series and the first season really shows what t.v was like in the '70s.,1482710400,,508,3.9702970297029703
