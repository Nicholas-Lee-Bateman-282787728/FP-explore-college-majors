Lee's music started in the Bebop era and he is a true Jazz explorer still playing with today greats and in Free Jazz settings.  In the DVD Lee is with Dan Tepfer a classical and Jazz pianist who Lee performs and records with the two have a great repore and musically challenge each other in there improvisations.  This DVD has something for everyone stories from someone who was part of the Jazz history, lessons in improvisation, and Free Jazz performance.  Highly recommended.",1402617600,,639,4.578947368421052

First, let me say I LOVE some of the other DVDs Jazz Heaven has created. This one just didn't do it for me at all.

It's pretty much two videos of two great players playing together and occasionally discussing a jazz topic. These topics don't go nearly as in depth as I would have liked them to. I'd guess about 70% of this is watching them play as if it were a concert DVD. No great shots of the keyboard voicings, scales used, or theory behind their playing are included.

It doesn't have a method for students to use for future reference. This is basically a master class so by nature it doesn't focus on theory. Instead it focuses on their point of view on jazz in general and a few topics like jazz history, learning tunes, and how to think about jazz.

Stick with the Bergonzi and Kenny Werner DVDs if you want more material with specifics on theory and explanations as to why and how to apply it all. I much prefer the Bergonzi and Werner DVDs to this type of DVD.

I wish I could have gotten something out of this, but what they actually teach could have been covered in a short paragraph instead of 2 hours of lessons. I can only recommend this to people who really like Lee Konitz and want to watch a private masterclass with a jazz master instead of a more rigorous, methodical, well laid out instructional DVD.",1373155200,3,1343,4.356
