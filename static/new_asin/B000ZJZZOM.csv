8235755,5,B000ZJZZOM,"I am a big fan of fifties' French crime noir, and I was very happy when I saw Razzia Sur La Chnouf available for purchase on Amazon. However,I do not speak French, so I e-mailed Amazon to ask if these dvds were subtitled. I received a typical boiler-plate response explaining things that had no relevance to my question, but nevertheless could not answer. I've wanted to see this movie for a very long time, and I went ahead and paid the fifty bucks for the set, and THESE DVDS ARE NOT SUBTITLED. Still, I recommend these dvds for any fan of crime noir, film noir, Gabin, Ventura, or the black and white world of Paris in the 1950's. Great companion pieces to Melville, Becker, and Dassin. Also get Claude Sautet's Classe Tous Risques on Criterion(Thank you Criterion). I also recommend the cd du Rififi au Cine. Lastly, can someone let me know if an English script or subtitles exist for Razzia Sur La Chnouf?",1216166400,6,910,4.554878048780488
