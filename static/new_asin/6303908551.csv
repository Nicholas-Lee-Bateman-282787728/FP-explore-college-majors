723481,4,6303908551,"This movie is a very good attempt by Meera Syal and Gurinder Chadha to show how Indian women try to embrace new cultural ideals while retaining  traditions of the past.  The women not only suffer from racism in white  England, but also sexism within their own culture.
However the  narrative seems to be somewhat underdeveloped.  It doesn't seem to go  indepth with the different characters.  For instance I would have like to  have learned a little more about the older aunt, Asha, who hallucinates  about the clashes between Indian mores and Western influences.  The  histories of younger teenagers Madhu and Bina, as well as the abused Ginder  and her husband, should have been a little more insightful.
The only  aspect of the movie I really liked is the relationship between Hashida and  her Jamaican boyfriend, played very well by Mo Sesay, who doesn't hesitate  to show emotion towards a life altering decision.
Nonetheless, throughout  the movie it can be noticed that all the women have experiences that  changes her way of thinking towards theirselves and society to some degree.  This is probably what the screenwriter and director of this movie wanted  to convey to the audience.  All and all, this is a very decent movie to  watch.",963705600,17,1244,4.913043478260869

723617,3,6303908551,"A laudable first film, made with some courage, but I find it very hard viewing.
Gurinder Chadha is unflinching in showing vile racism and sexism --- to be fair, we are shown violence and sexism inside British South Asian  and Jamaican cultures.  At my age I can no longer look at and hear the nasty side of life. Chadha's next film, her phenomenally successful BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM, is a massive feel-good counterpoint to BHAJI.

I'd love to know who inserted the rare and little-known poetry book that one of the women is reading during the trip: ""The Rhyme of the Flying Bomb"" by Mervyn Peake.  A little vanity touch there, from one of the crew?

If you don't mind some bad language and coarse lewd references, which are not at all indecent by today's movie and TV standards, you will be fascinated and entertained by this film.",1407283200,,830,4.581081081081081

723619,4,6303908551,I love this movie.  I had it on VHS and I ordered the dvd.  It touches so many emotions that it makes me both happy and sad.  I highly recommend this movie to those who like to see how other cultures deal with family and traditions.  If your not into chick flicks this movie is not for you.,1380844800,2,290,3.9482758620689653

I found it's humor sophisticated but not too. Overall it was unforgetable and I always smile when I think of Bhaji on the Beach.,1228521600,5,281,4.423076923076923
723621,5,6303908551,"I was surprised, like the critic before me, that BHAJI ON THE BEACH was not more frequently reviewed.  This is one of the early films from director Gurinder Chadha's (BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM, BRIDE AND PREJUDICE) repertoire.  Released in the United States in 1994, it takes a modern day look at the struggles and challenges faced by a multi-generational group of Indo-English women.  Very important and thought-provoking topics are covered here, including domestic abuse, interracial dating, and pregnancy.  The life-altering events take place during a holiday weekend at a beach resort in Blackpool, for which the women, as seemingly different as they are, must come together to support and encourage one another.  Especially notable is the late, great Sarita Khajuria, a beautiful actress best known for her role as Hashida in BHAJI.  Don't miss out on this one.",1189296000,2,861,5.202898550724638
723622,5,6303908551,"This is such a great movie that I can't believe that no one has written a review before now.

Essentially, the action takes place over a single day.  A group of women take a holiday to the beach and through a series of events, come to understand the power and comfort of unity with each other.

Each woman represents a different aspect of the experience of diaspora Indian womanhood; ranging from the fully acculturated (which comes with it's own set of problems) youth to the older more conservatively ""Indian"" generation.  There is even a charcter (my favorite) who is a disillusioned middle-aged woman who sees life through a Bollywood lense.

The film tackels race, caste, class, and the typical conflict between the old and the new, and does it in a way that is very moving.  Extremely, highly, recommended.",1157760000,7,812,4.805755395683454
7854547,5,6303908551,"Ah, Gurinder Chadha's work prior to BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM. Rather on the lines of Spike Lee's GET ON THE BUS. And over the top in some areas, namely on the part of the passenger seeking a man's love versus her Sikh traditions. But a better choice than 'Bridesmaids' or 'Rough Night'. Humor is 80% to 90% subtle; no need for screwball antics. And also a clear point is made: that it's no easier for British-Indians and more in the UK than it is for African-Americans and more in the US.",1497484800,,484,4.329670329670329
