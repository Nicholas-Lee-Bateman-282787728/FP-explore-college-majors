Unfortunately its shortcomings are all too obvious. The acting is beyond cretinous, the camerawork shoddy, and the picture grainy and wobbly.
Sound is also chronic in parts with voice sound volume decreasing abruptly when actors walk away from the boom mike.
Although the gore is plenteous and quite well delivered, it seemed that Mr Cavalline was just direcing a series of horrific scenes to shock.
There was no cohesion and it came across like he was trying just that bit too hard. There is not much (if any)storyline, so all in all not a success.
I'd recommend this film to horror boneheads who can understand gore when they see it, but would be confused by any semblance of plot or realistic acting. Strictly Amateur Hour i'm afraid.

PS Ignore Todd Proesl's review. Not only does he ""act"" in this film, he is the worst ""actor"" in the entire thing.",1297728000,,921,4.615853658536586
8348719,5,B0020SPO24,"I saw this movie thinking oh no another Low budget mess created with a video camera. From the first frame to the last I was shocked and brought into this twisted world of the filmmakers. He is brutal and honest is its portrayal of its theme of trafficking.
I really was out of breath and cringed and consider myself a true horror fan. But this takes us were we never have been at low budget filming. But I should not say low budget film making cause it is obvious from the way this flick was filmed there was a writing team and production team behind this that turned out a well polished feature.
From the editing to the FX to the strong characterization! Plus kudos for the not shy away scene of the baby scene. This stand out as the balls this film maker had to not shy away form showing anything.
Anyone who sees this movie may be in shock but not disappointed!",1244851200,,864,4.274390243902439
8348720,5,B0020SPO24,"i was very honored to have stockholm syndrome play at my slumber party that i hosted for films for foods in nov 08 in erie, pa.  even though i was part of this movie, the director, producer, and other actors kept everything hush hush so it would be a surprise once released.  i knew this movie was gonna be something insane....just by watching the movie trailer gave me chills!

stockholm syndrome is not for the close-minded or weak stomach individual.  the movie was very cleverly written to make you think twice about what you just watched.

i will promise you that by adding this movie to your collection, itll stand out cause its one of a kind!

8348721,1,B0020SPO24,"You could go out and buy 100 other movies just like this if you wanted to. Nothing new, nothing original. I'm not saying someone out there wouldn't like it but for me it was a waste of time to be honest",1243728000,2,202,3.951219512195122
8348722,5,B0020SPO24,"I seen this little film at a charity even in Erie back in November. Let me tell you. In my opinion it's one of the best independent low budget flicks I've seen in a long time. You actually care about the characters in the movie. And the gore factor is INSANE! Raw, brutal, and, an engaging story to boot. Definitely give this film a viewing!",1243728000,2,341,4.2615384615384615
8348723,5,B0020SPO24,"I seen this film at the CinemaWasteland Convention and it is RAW and NASTY.  For an independent film, I was impressed.  Bloody and nasty... What a horror movie should be.  The best part is this film doesn't let up.  The film has its set up at the beginning and then you go on this ride that doesn't let up.  Great film, can't wait to get my hands on it and see it again.  Plus the extras will be on this DVD.",1240790400,2,408,3.9753086419753085
8348724,5,B0020SPO24,"I cannot wait to purchase this flick.  I had the opportunity to see it at Cinema Wasteland in Ohio.  What a great, tense piece of work!  The graphic brutality of what is portrayed in this film permeates your mind and lingers with you long after the credits roll.  We were talking about this film all night after viewing it.  It's about human trafficking, which might not be a brand new plot device, but Stockholm delivers it in a way that grabs hold of the viewer and shouts in your face that this kind of stuff is happening in your own backyard or neighborhood.  If you're not sure, let me send your doubts away by saying, it's definitely worth buying.",1238976000,,653,4.445378151260504
