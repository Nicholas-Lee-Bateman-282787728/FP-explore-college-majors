7908369,3,B00000FAE3,"One of the earliest of the Homecoming Video Series ""Landmark"" was filmed and recorded in 1994. A tribute was paid to Stuart Hamblin. Susy Hamblin was present for this concert and participated in the singing of several of his songs. Others receiving special mention included Jake Hess, and Brock Speer.

My personal favorite artists include: Larnelle Harris, Jake Hess, Gary Mc Spadden, Michael English, and Ray Boltz. Unique musical groups included Acapella and Charles Johnson and the Revivers.

I enjoyed the youthful exuberance of many of the old-timers among the original Homecoming Friends. My favorites among the featured songs include: It is No Secret, How Big Is God, Until Then, He's Still Working on Me, and The Lighthouse.

The quality of the sound lacked some of the quality and consistency of the later videos. However, the worship experience, the testimonies, and the message of the songs honored the Lord Jesus, of whom they sang.",1324339200,,945,5.123376623376624
