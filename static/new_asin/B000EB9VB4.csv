8318234,5,B000EB9VB4,"I plan on coming back to this DVD all the time. So much to learn and in a very comfortable one on one for anyone that has the basics down. For Intermediate and way up in my opinion. Does not dwell on scales- although they are there.

Kind of like jamming with an under rated master. He will give you tips and licks that you can turn into your own style.",1375660800,2,353,3.971830985915493
8318235,5,B000EB9VB4,"Jorma Kaukonen takes a simple, classic rock approach to rock and blues lead electric guitar.  Lead lines come from inside the chords used, so you can build awesome solos easily and effectively.  Jorma teaches lots of rock and blues licks and techniques (false harmonics, string bending, 3 octave licks, string snapping, use of pick and fingers) and also gives advice on equipment, practice, tuning, etc.  What really makes this an exciting set of lessons is the demonstration of the material by Electric Hot Tuna.  Each tune is broken down after a performance in the Homespun studio.  I've returned time and again over the years since this first came out (early 90s) and what I like is that it is technique oriented  and doesn't require any memorization of lots of scales and modes or long, superfast licks.  The techniques presented here encourages thinking musically, improvising, and staying fresh.  It probably isn't what the heavy metal shredder types are looking for, though I always think you can benefit from getting tips from an accomplished master.",1180310400,12,1058,5.07514450867052
