3549222,5,B001EC7VBE,"I have both season 1 and season 2 and shout to the heavens, ""when is season 3 coming out?""  I love these coppers singularly, but, even more so together.  Well-rounded and educated Inspector Pascoe makes a great and dignified straight man to, his boss, Detective Dalziel, who is either scratching his boccies in public, or swilling whiskey as if the Scots were going to lose the recipe sometime soon.  This series is very well written, produced, and acted.  Maybe it's not quite the most fun you can have with your clothes on, but, hey, you're home, clothing is optional.",1288051200,4,570,4.7272727272727275
3549223,5,B001EC7VBE,"As a dedicated Reginald Hill fan, I was thrilled to learn that this series had finally been formatted to play on US TV.

I was not disappointed, what great casting.  Could watch them over and over,",1287100800,6,197,4.444444444444445
3549224,3,B001EC7VBE,"Not a bad presentation of Mr. Hill's work.  But Inspector Dalzeil is so badly miscast, the story loses its flavor.  I guess I was expecting a ""Morse""-like acting performance and was sorely disappointed.  This series is certainly not up to the quality of the ""Insp. Morse"" or ""Insp. Lewis"" products.",1278979200,4,298,4.92
3549225,5,B001EC7VBE,"Series 2 improves over Series 1 which was excellent (see my
review).My copy is from the UK so you need a Region 2 (or
all Regions) player. 2 Disks,4 eps: Ruling Passion,A Killing
Kindness,Deadheads,Exit Lines. I've watched 3 of 4. To quote
Blackhorse47 (UK) the actors are settling into their roles.
Ep3  is the most interesting (were the deaths accidents or
murders?). Ep1 looked a little like a Midsommer Murders ep
Dalziel becomes even more humane,becoming a godfather to
Ellie Pascoe's child-though he ""cold-cocks"" a thief in ep1.
One attraction of Brit.mysteries for me is that the police
don't always have to wonder about getting shot or beaten up
(it can happen,but its much rarer than here).Comes with sub
titles (although the actors speak fairly distinctly).Highly
recommended of this type. My wife continues her enjoyment of
the series. In some of these,I was able to pick out the likely culprint (not Ep3 though).",1269561600,21,924,5.03921568627451

3549252,5,B001EC7VBE,"Great series.  Detective Andy Dalziel is an idiosyncratic, no-nonsense copper with a penetrating wit and questionable personal habits.  Inspector Peter Pascoe is his cultured sidekick -- a thoughtful man with a degree in Social Scienced, a caring attitude, and a sharp brain.  These two contrasting characters who share a passionate commitment to justice, forge an impressive crime-solving partnership and a tentative friendship.  There are four episodes with lots of twist and turns.  Subtitles help the deaf and hearing impaired.  I actually use it because of the accents.",1406678400,3,574,5.540229885057471

Warren Clarke as Dalziel is very good and the last story in the set is Exit Lines which it looks like he may have killed someone in a hit and run accident,but never fear the real case will be solved,the other three stories are good too so check it out you might become a fan of D AND P.",1324857600,,396,3.9625

3549263,4,B001EC7VBE,"Great combination of Brit humor and gritty detective work. Fat Andy (Dalziel..pronounced Dee-ehl) is rude, crude and attentive to small detail.

8297598,3,B001EC7VBE,"You gotta like being bullied and degraded and sneered at to like this kind of thing. Dalziel is a pig, a bully, and he's boozed up and cruel. If i met him i wouldn't like him and i don't enjoy watching other people being pushed around and spit on by an abusive cop. It's filmed well, acted well, and a disagreeable show.

8297600,3,B001EC7VBE,"The screenplay faithfully reflects the authors writings, and the acting is superb.  The cinematics are beautiful.  The dialogue is realistic, although it would help most American viewers to turn on subtitles, and learn a little about the slang terminology used in the vicinity of Yorkshire.  Still, I had little trouble understanding what was taking place.

The first episode (Ruling Passion) is very close to the book, even though the plot is very complex.  In it, Pascoe and his very pregnant wife, Ellie, travel to Oxfordshire to celebrate with friends.  When the Pascoes arrive, they find three of them horribly murdered after being shot with a shotgun.  The plot was complicated, but very well executed by the cast and crew.  In this episode, we a I purchased this DVD used from Amazon.com.  It is a faithful presentation of author Reginald Hills police procedural novels set in Yorkshire, England in the modern era.  This set of two discs consists of four episodes representing four of the authors novels: Ruling Passion, A Killing Kindness, Deadheads, and Exit Lines.  I have read all of the authors Dalziel & Pascoe novels, and I have reviewed all of them.  The actors who played the starring roles in the TV series are: Warren Clarke as Detective Superintendent Andy Dalziel, Colin Buchanan as Detective Inspector Peter Pascoe, and Susannah Corbett as Pascoes wife Ellie.  I found that, so far, my reviews and ratings of the TV episodes closely matches my reviews and ratings of the novels.

re introduced to the new police cadet graduate, Police Constable (PC) Singh (Dalziel calls him Gunga).  We have already met Detective Sergeant Wield (Wieldy). who is played very well by David Royle, in Season 1.  Although I did not like the book, awarding it only two stars, I liked the TV episode better, and would easily award it three stars.  In this episode the Pascoe family receives a new addition as Ellie gives birth to a baby girl who they name Rose.  Andy Dalziel becomes her godfather.  The reason for not awarding a higher rating is the complexity of the plot.  It is too difficult to easily follow.

The second episode (A Killing Kindness) also follows the book closely.  In it, women, and especially young women, are being strangled, and their bodies are being posed by a serial killer who calls the local newspaper after each murder.  Using different voices, he quotes from Shakespeares Hamlet.  Coincidentally, that play is being presented by students at a local school, the Bishop Crump Comprehensive, at the time, and rehearsals are under way.  Some of the victims are members of the cast.  At the center of the investigation is a band of gypsies who are camped alongside a local glider club.  The gypsies horses occasionally escape and run out onto the airfield, endangering the glider pilots who are attempting to land.  The gypsies, of course, are feared and resented by the locals, so they become the primary suspects in the minds of the citizenry.  Dalziel and Pascoe are not so sure, but one of the victims is found in the tent of a gypsy fortune teller at the site of a horse fair.  That increases the focus on the gypsies.  Dalziel and Pascoe follow different leads to come to the same conclusion: the real killer is somebody not suspected at all.  In the end, they identify the killer, and determine his motive for what the press has been calling the Hamlet Murders.  This one is a little better than the first episode, so I award it three stars.  It does, however, have a complex plot.

The third episode (Deadheads) is, again, faithful to the book.  When I read the original novel, I awarded it four stars.  This time, however, the TV episode is not as clear in its portrayal of the plot, the characters and the relationship between them.  Some viewers who had not  read the novel might have difficulty following the story.  The title comes from the practice of deadheading roses, and roses seem to be a central theme in the plot.  Unfortunately, the author (Reginald Hill) left his readers with unanswered questions, and the TV episode did not answer them.  Only three stars for this episode.

The fourth episode is titled Exit Lines.  In this episode, we are introduced the Police Constable (PC) Hector, a character who will appear again in future episodes.  This story involves a ring that is smuggling heroin into England using a helicopter that ferries European guests to an exclusive hunting club, where they come to shoot pheasants.  Andy Dalziel is investigating that crime, while Peter Pascoe is investigating the brutal murder of an old man during a burglary that nets the criminal nothing more than a watch and some medals he received during WWII.  The two cases become linked, and both are solved by the intrepid Yorkshire detectives.  This was a four-star production, in my estimation.

These are really well done TV shows.  They are highly entertaining, and represent some of the highest quality video produced by the BBC.  I highly recommend Season 2 of the Dalziel & Pascoe TV Series DVDs.  I award the episode three stars of a total of five.  Excellent television with high entertainment values.  Stay tuned for Season 3.",1513728000,,5168,4.845714285714286
