8679946,4,B00NT4QMNI,"UFC 177 has 2 great fights. They're worth 4 stars

Yancy Medeiros vs Damon Jackson
Round 1 was a balanced fight. Both sides landed many strikes. In round 2, one of the fighters was choked out. This fight was acceptable.

Ramsey Nijem vs Diego Ferreira
This is the second best fight of this show. Round 2 was exciting. The fighter who had been under attacked since round 1 now successfully counter attacked. It ended with a surprise knock out in round 3. This fight was interesting.
Tony Ferguson vs Danny Castillo
Its weird. Danny kept taking Tony down without finishing Tony. The ending is predictable.

TJ Dillashaw vs Joe Soto
This is the best fight of this show. Its a very exciting fight. Both fighters traded fists and kicks frequently. It ended with a knockout kick to the head in round 5.

UFC 178 has only 1 exciting fight. They're worth 3 stars.

Tim Kennedy vs Yeol Romero
Its the bloodiest fight of this show. Its very exciting too. It ended in round 2. Both fighters fought with teeth and nails from the beginning till the end. This fight was worth 5 stars but the whole show was worth only 3 stars.

Dustin Poirier vs Conor McGregor
It ended in round 1 with a knockout. Its too fast to be interesting.

Eddie Alvarez vs Donald Cerrone
Its a lopsided fight. Donald was too tall with much longer reach. His opponent had no chance against him. Its a boring fight.

Demetrieus Johnson vs Chris Carioso
Its another lopsided fight. Its no fun to watch. Demetrieus was so strong and skillful for his opponent. It ended in round 2.

Dominick Cruz vs Takeya Mizugaki
Its  the third lopsided fight of this show. It ended in round 1. Its too fast to be interesting.

Overall, this combo DVD is worth 4 stars.",1432598400,,1711,4.504854368932039

8679950,4,B00NT4QMNI,"Given the state of the UFC pay-per-views of the last few years I'm surprised that this isn't the default format for how pay-per-views are released on DVD.  Placing two events on one DVD set is what I honestly expect to become the standard, and very soon at that.  Most pay-per-views are highlighted by one or two name fights and then highlighted by two or three finishes.  The problem is that a lot of events don't have that ""it"" fight that hardcore fans look for.  Combining events offers a little bit of everything (as long as the events provide).

Looking at the circumstances UFC 177 is likely the reason this set was brought about initially but it worked out.  UFC 137 was the last time a championship main event had to be changed on short notice before UFC 177.  On that event Georges St-Pierre had to be taken off the card from his bout with Carlos Condit due to tearing his ACL during training a week before the event itself.  UFC 177 made history by making the quickest successful change in main event in UFC pay-per-view history when it was revealed Renan Baro could not successfully cut his weight for the weigh-in a day before, to the point that he had to be taken to the hospital.  UFC management did another first by also putting Joe Soto in the championship fight against TJ Dillawshaw to replace Baro, a first since Soto was originally making his UFC debut in a prelim during the undercard.  Along with a few other twists and turns this pay-per-view had the fewest number of fights since 2007.  Strangely enough, this turned into a good card with a solid mixture of fights and finishes, which is typical of cards highlighted by only one big name fight (my personal opinion of course).

While UFC 177 is a decent enough card to me the best buy for you bang is the UFC 178 card.  It is highlighted by the flyweight title fight between Demetrious Johnson and Chris Cariaso.  I kid you not when I saw that Demetrious Johnson is likely the fastest fighter you will ever see perform, while also being one of the most technical sound in the game today in any weight class.  Chris Cariaso has had a decent run in the UFC up to this point with a record of 7-3 in the UFC but would it be enough to put away the champion who has made the number of legitimate contenders in the 125 division very small?  The championship fight is something of a surprise, and also not at the same time.  It's hard to say much without giving much away but if you wanna one of the most technically sound performances of the year I would recommend watching this fight.  The UFC 178 card is also highlighted by debut of Eddie Alvarez against Donald Cerrone (a fantastic matchup) as well as the return of Cat Zingano against women featherweight powerhouse Amanda Nunes (seriously, the women have been bringing it hardcore since the beginning and this is another amazing fight to add into that current run of steam).  Also look out for the fight between Dustin Poirier and Conor McGregor, a fight of bad blood with a nasty finish to boot.

Honestly, I really enjoy this set even though it isn't filled with the best fights in the world.  The reason I lowered the score from a 5 to a 4 is due to a production detail of the the DVDs which bothers me to no end.  The picture is actually quite good and I have come to accept that there will no longer be special features such as the Countdown shows or weigh-ins (a lack of special features has been common for quite some time in DVD releases) mainly due to the fact that the releases have changed into the pay-per-view shows almost exactly as they are aired.  I think the issue of spacing also hurts given the fact that these DVDs will likely become standard bundles in the near future.  My issue with these DVD releases is the sound quality.  Funny enough, when I play my older UFC DVDs the sound isn't something I notice being an issue.  It wasn't until I played the ""Best of 2013"" set that I noticed these releases don't have the quality sound that I get when I watch the events live.  I realize the DVDs don't have the same quality presentation as blu-rays but if you listen you'll notice that the sound of the fights is muffled and the commentary is played unusually loud in contrast to the fight itself.  This is upsetting since I don't enjoy the fact that the fights are being hushed.  I know this might be an issue of spacing to preserve the visual presentation of the DVDs but I hope that this is something that is changed at least in the blu-rays to come.  Again, that is my main issue with this release.

Overall, I think this bundle is definitely worth checking out.  It is likely that a number of the lower name fighters won't get notice on the ""Best of 2014"" release so a number of the good performances and finishes from these pay-per-views will likely go unnoticed to the casual fan.  Considering what is given in the bundle I think most fans would be happy in purchasing this.",1420070400,3,4920,4.449275362318841
