1353607,5,B00004U2A8,"Nighty Night is incredible! My three-year-old declared war every night at bedtime until we discovered this miracle video! The soft music, sweet animals and twinkling stars are enough to make anyone drift off to Dreamland. In fact, I've never seen the end! As a parent, I highly recommend this video. You'll wonder how you ever lived without it!",1037318400,9,344,4.948275862068965
1353608,5,B00004U2A8,"as a single dad navigating his way through the maze of parenthood, i have tried everything to get my kid to sleep at night.  nothing worked - until this.  i consider it indispensable and highly recommend it, especially when all else fails.

1353609,5,B00004U2A8,"This video is a miracle for weary parents of energetic toddlers!  I resorted to this video when I couldn't seem to get my son into bed until 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. EVERY NIGHT!  He just didn't seem to be able to wind down.  But, this video is the perfect thing to calm your toddler down and give him sweet dreams about cute little kitties and puppies!  The classical music is a nice touch, too (very relaxing for mommies and daddies as well!)  My son begs for this video every night!  It is a must-have for every parent of a pre-school child!!",974764800,9,540,4.297029702970297
1353610,5,B00004U2A8,"This video just won two awards from  nonprofit organizations: Film Advisory Board - award of excellence
Dove Foundation - ""Family Approved"" seal -- recommended for family viewing",960940800,7,178,5.592592592592593
7923403,5,B00004U2A8,It was perfect for my baby granddaughter. She loved it.,1413849600,,55,4.6
7923404,3,B00004U2A8,"I bought this because my daughter refused to sleep in her room. I'm not sure that it worked. She liked watching the animals. It would keep her quiet and interested, but when the video was over 9 times out of 10...she was wide awake! (Mom and dad may not be!!) I'm going to try it again though. Not to send her to dreamland. I am going to try to incorporate it into her routine at night as a calming down of sorts. It's a cute video, the animals are great, the music is great but it DOES NOT make my child simply fall asleep!",1283472000,,524,4.048076923076923
7923405,4,B00004U2A8,"I got this video about 3 years ago. It worked great for my 2 oldest sons(my youngest wasn't born yet) even though they both have a very difficult time going to bed at night. We still did the bedtime story/book, and I sang them a song or two before the video and there were nights when we played the video twice(yes longer might be better) but otherwise it was a wonderful bedtime tool!

I saw ""WAS"" because we used it so much that the video actually started to skip and such. So my only complaint is that I wish I could get this in a DVD format. Any hope for that?",1229472000,,564,4.081081081081081
7923406,5,B00004U2A8,"My son has been put to sleep at his daycare for two years with this video.  Now that I have a three year old and a two month old I decided it was a must have at home as well!  Our daycare provider just purchased a new copy because hers was worn out.  If a video can put 10 toddlers to sleep at daycare, I believe it's worth every penny!!",1150243200,,337,3.7857142857142856
7923407,5,B00004U2A8,This tape has been a life style change for our family. It dramatically improved our night time routine. We have used it for years I'm replacing a worn out tape.,1126051200,,160,4.366666666666666
7923408,3,B00004U2A8,"You won't be disappointed in this little video (emphasis on ""little""), parents, if you remember 3 things:  It's short, it's very low-production, and don't rely on it to put your toddler right to sleep.  I almost didn't purchase it, due to so many of the customer ratings being ""I like it, but...""  Ultimately, though, I'm glad I did.  The strength of this tape are the darling animal segments, which I'd describe as well-done amateur photography. Some of the accompanying music sounds homemade, which is simultaneously charming and annoying.  My little boy loves the animals, but gets bored with the starry sky & Liberace-style piano, which makes up about the last third of the tape.  Once the animals are gone, he asks to watch something else.  My biggest complaint is that it's way too short, with too sudden a change from action to sleepy time--- not enough of the winding down stage.  Overall, though, it's a worthwhile purchase.",1055462400,6,933,4.898089171974522
7923409,1,B00004U2A8,"I am happy this works for some children. My child has difficulty winding down to go to bed at night. Due to its reasonable price and great reviews, I was willing to try this product.
I just want to let you know that it does not work for all children. If you have a high need child, don't expect this video to be a miracle to put them to sleep. I played this video for my high need toddler (2 years old) and she watched it all the way through then asked to watch something different. She hasn't asked for this video again. When given the choice of two videos, she doesn't ever choose this one.
If you have a high need child with difficulty going to sleep, then I suggest you read Dr. Sears' book Nighttime Parenting: How to Get Your Baby and Child to Sleep and Elizabeth Pantley's book The No-Cry Sleep Solution: Gentle Ways to Help Your Baby Sleep Through the Night. They will be more helpful to you then this video.",1045440000,10,916,4.24
7923410,4,B00004U2A8,"When I first saw this video, I was astounded at its short length and its simplistic redundancy, and I thought we'd been ripped off.  My 2yo daughter obviously felt otherwise:  this video calms her down at the end of a day so that putting her to bed is easy!  She has absolutely no interest in it during the day - it's definitely a nighttime thing.",1045353600,,347,4.3076923076923075
7923411,5,B00004U2A8,"This 20 minute video begins with very cute baby animals playing -- goats, penguins, bears, etc. -- and as it progresses the animals slow down, begin to yawn, and finally shut their eyes and go to sleep; toward the end, the film of animals is interspersed with an animated starry sky, and finally the film ends with the stars in the sky. When we put on Nighty Night, invariably my husband and I become relaxed and sleepy; unfortunately it doesn't always work for our active toddler.",1039910400,2,481,4.604651162790698
