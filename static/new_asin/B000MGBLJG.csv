2732176,3,B000MGBLJG,Enjoyed this movie 20 + years ago and was delighted to finally find it in DVD.  It is dated and a little corny but still a nice story and well done in that dry British style.,1180310400,3,174,3.8333333333333335
2732177,5,B000MGBLJG,Bravo to Fox for releasing some of the less famous but still superior classics. This is a one of a kind. It clearly establishes Jeffrey Hunter as the most talented of the 1950's handsome hunks.,1175731200,27,193,4.542857142857143
2732178,5,B000MGBLJG,"I caught this movie on American Movie Classics a few years ago and

hoped that one day it would be made available on DVD. Jeffrey

Hunter, a very underrated actor in one of his first starring roles,

is a Canadian sailor in England's Royal Navy. It is World War Two, and

his ship is hunting for a much-feared German battlecruiser. When his ship engages the cruiser in battle, the cruiser is damaged and his ship is sunk. He is taken prisoner aboard the German ship, and when the ship pulls into a remote island harbor for repairs, he escapes to the

island armed with a rifle and plenty of ammunition. He devises a plan

to shoot at the repair crews as they try to fix the ship, to delay

their departure. Doing that will give other Royal Navy ships time

to zero in on the cruiser's location and sink them.

A very good movie with a very satisfying ending...look for a pre-James

Bond Bernard Lee in a fine supporting role.

""Sailor of the King""...with a movie title like that, you can't go wrong.

Thanks, Fox!! Keep these greats coming!",1172880000,83,1040,4.444444444444445

2732220,5,B000MGBLJG,"I first saw this movie as a kid watching NBC Saturday Night At The Movies in 1962. It made a big impact on me, and I was happy to find this reasonably-priced DVD. The disk is well-mastered from a clean print. I expected to be a little disappointed by the movie itself since I was re-watching it as an adult, but it has held up remarkably well. The warship battle scenes are better than those found in most movies about WW II. (I did notice things like ships being filmed at a dead-stop when they were supposed to be moving, and bags from the explosives charges being visible when the supposed ""shells"" exploded, but this was minor compared to the authenticity of the rest of the scenes.) The acting was good, and the story was solid since it was based on a novel by C S Forrester. If you are a fan of older WW II flicks and don't mind watching something in B&W, you won't be disappointed in this DVD.",1443139200,,900,4.269005847953216

2732288,4,B000MGBLJG,"A very good remake of an original film set in WW1.  This version is set in WW2 but follows the same plot.  Two endings are provided just in case you're unhappy with unhappy endings.  Jeffrey Hunter's American/Canadian accent in a British based film grates for a while, but you get used to it.  As with any of these films, they just cannot get the opposition ships right.  Recommended.",1398643200,,384,4.588235294117647

2732290,5,B000MGBLJG,"What more can be said?  A Canadian serving in the Royal Navy as a signalman is captured by a German cruiser after his own ship is sunk.  The German cruiser, damaged in the battle, pulls into a secluded anchorage to effect repairs.  Knowing that other RN ships are searching for the the German captain pushes for quick repair.

The signalman, a championship marksman, slips over the side with a rifle and ammunition and proceeds to delay the repairs, hopefully long enough for the RN to locate and sink the German Raider.

Well acted, excellent staging with RN cruisers involved in the production.  Some slips, such as rifle types being switched about, but that by no means impacts on the film.",1389225600,,693,4.733333333333333

2732293,4,B000MGBLJG,"I thought this black-and-white WWII film was enjoyable. The first 16 minutes is a love story drama...not the best part of the movie in my opinion.  Although you could skip the love drama, it does give meaning to the ending. Also, there is an alternate ending (although I prefer the original ending); it's in the Special Features part of the DVD.

Things I liked about this movie: acting, realism, good pace (except the first 16 minutes), effects.

2732294,3,B000MGBLJG,"First and foremost, this is a bit of a stretch, but then watching most any movie calls for the suspension of disbelief for a few hours.  That Jeffrey Hunter single handed held up a German raider cruiser moored off the Galapagos with a bolt action rifle makes for an interesting but unlikely scenario.  This being said, it is Hollywood in the early days of color filming, and they certainly picked a good location for the shoot.  I was thankful that the DVD came with an alternate ending, and having seen both endings, thought that the proper one was chosen.",1369008000,,557,4.606060606060606
2732295,3,B000MGBLJG,This movie was ok I don't  know if this was fictional or a true story but some of the parts just could not have been possible. Such as when Jeff Hunter was being shelled by 15 inch shells he definantly could not have survived that.,1368230400,,231,4.133333333333334

2732319,1,B000MGBLJG,The movie is great...interesting and believable story.  Kind of reminds you of the Deutschland in the South Atlantic and Indian Ocean in WW2.

2732322,5,B000MGBLJG,Great movie.  I had seen this years before (many years before) and thoroughly enjoyed it. Decided to see if it was still as enjoyable in my old age as it was when I was a kid - it was.  A wonderful adventure tale without all the digitized whiz-bang nonsense which innundate today's movies.  Wonderful acting by some notables of the time.  Great for a rainy Saturday afternoon.,1351728000,,376,4.567164179104478

2732324,5,B000MGBLJG,"As I expected this film has enough elements to consider it a very good movie. Jeffrey Hunter does it well as the young sailor with great convictions about his duty and caught in a almost impossible situation.

Give this film a chance some day and youll enjoy it, specially if you like adventure as well as down-to-earth movie scripts.",1296172800,,334,4.661016949152542
2732325,4,B000MGBLJG,"I enjoyed this movie enough to buy it and add it to my collection. I am a Michael Rennie fan, and so I found the first 20 minutes of the movie just as interesting as the rest of the film and I disagree that the movie has a 'slow' opening. The unexpected and illicit affair, especially for the WWI era in which it takes place, between Rennie's character and the young, proper English girl is crucial to the rest of the plot, so if it had been omitted or if she had agreed to marry him, it would have changed this movie to another average WWII adventure film rather than hint at the amazing coincidence of life that puts an unsuspecting Rennie commanding his own son, the product of that affair and also a young man totally oblivious to who is father is, 20 years or so later in another world war.
This brings me to my only complaint of the movie, which is why I didn't give it a full 5 stars. I watched both the British ending and the American ending, and I can appreciate both. However, at no time is any recognition fully realized that the young sailor is actually Rennie's son from that 5-day affair over 20 years ago, and I wish the connection between them could have been made more definitely, since it is really at the crux of the movie.
As an American, I like the American ending, which is more upbeat and hints that sometime in the future this family (including the mother) might finally have some resolution, but it is not fully realized and we don't know for sure if it will ever happen. I also appreciate the British ending, more somber but still interesting yet also wasting the opportunity to fully draw together the relationship between Hunter's and Rennie's characters at the end of the movie. It is a bit frustrating, but the movie is otherwise quite good.
At any rate, if you are a Michael Rennie fan or a Jeffrey Hunter fan you will enjoy this movie and I recommend it, also recommending it for those who enjoy war movies filmed from a different perspective than Americans usually see. This is a British war movie and so we get to see our allies in WWII dealing with the German navy, which is a refreshing point of view.",1283904000,2,2137,4.385390428211587
2732356,4,B000MGBLJG,"I remember having seen this 1953 movie for the first time in the late 1950s on ""Saturday Night at the Movies.""  This was when the city I lived in only had two television channels and one movie once a week, on Saturday nights.  So, this was a big event (and a far cry from today's television world), and it obviously stuck in my mind.  I had not seen the movie since then (more than 50 years!) and, not having remembered the film title, only found it again because of Amazon.com's superb system for locating films.  Taking into account that it is an older film, I was still not disappointed with it at all.  It was well-done and, although I preferred one of the two alternate endings available on the disk (be sure to see both!), the theatrical version's ending was still good although that used version doesn't explain well the reason for the beginning scenes in the movie.  Yes, the movie starts slowly, but the alternate endings explain more clearly why.  If you like classic war films, then this one is for you.",1271548800,,1014,4.508196721311475

The son is brought up by his mother in Canada and joins the Royal Navy during WW2. After being captured by the crew of a German Navy Ship, he escapes with a stolen rifle and single handly takes on the crew of the German Navy Ship, whilst they're trying to make repairs in the bay of an island. One thing I didn't like was they showed him escaping with a German K98 Mauser rifle, then when he's on the island, he's got a British Lee Enfield No 4 rifle, then he's got a German K98 Mauser rifle and so on.

Middle section picks up during WWII with the same officer now captain and introduces the Jeffrey Hunter signalman character.  Finally we get to the action with the signalman aboard the German vessel where he heroically decides to slow up repairs.  Although the cool premise carries the WWII portions, making them watchable, the whole movie botches the potential of that premise.  The backstory is simply filler, not in any way motivating the choices of the poorly developed characters.

One man holding up an entire evil axis ship by his wits and skill, what an escapist fantasy. The presentation is very dry, almost a documentary. The story screams for drama. His escape from the ship should have had at least a close call. The German Captain should have been very angry, and taking it personal. The hero could have been shown using craft to avoid detection when in the rocks. Possibly a crack German sniper gone ashore to hunt him, and their wary stalking of each other. The love story at the beginning, besides an atraction for the females in the audience, it is a waste of precious screen time. I would have liked to see that time spent on Brown's Canadien outdoors hunting and shooting growing-up background, setting him up for his abilities later. Also a segment showing the German raider doing some nefarious piracy against helpless transport ships, making all the more enjoyable when it is helpless. There is a germ of a great story here.",1227657600,,1051,4.5661375661375665

2732390,4,B000MGBLJG,"I saw this movie years ago on a VHS recording someone else had made when it was shown on a commercial TV channel. Even then, I thought it was a great story. It's based on the 1929 C. S. Forester novel ""Brown on Resolution."" However, Forester's novel was set in World War 1 around the naval battles of Coronel and the Falklands, while this movie was reset in World War 2 with fictional naval encounters.

But, the movie begins in World War 1 when a young naval officer (Michael Rennie) has a chance meeting on a train and brief affair with a young woman (Wendy Hiller). She refuses his offer of marriage and they part, apparently, for good. Then the movie cuts to the beginning of World War 2 when a British squadron of light cruisers is chasing down a German surface raider. Seaman Brown (Jeffrey Hunter), a Canadian in the RN, is a top-notch sailor, best at his job as signalman, and the best rifle marksman in the fleet. Brown's ship is sent ahead by the squadron commander, Michael Rennie, but the ship's encounter with the German raider results in a loss with all hands but two, Brown and another sailor, who has lost his leg. However, the raider has taken damage that requires repair in some secluded spot.

On the German ship, Brown refuses to give information to the German captain about the squadron chasing him, insisting that his ship was operating alone. Nevertheless, the captain suspects that a larger squadron is after him and he must make repairs quickly and get away. They pull into a small inlet on Resolution Island off the coast of South America and begin repairs. During the night, with the encouragement of his wounded comrade, Brown escapes from the ship, steals a rifle and ammunition, and takes position on the island.

When dawn breaks, Brown begins sniping the work crews effecting repairs. This stops all work and severely delays the Germans' departure. The Germans fire blindly into the cliffs where Brown is hidden, but as soon as they resume repairs, he starts firing again. He keeps up his attacks despite wounds and intense thirst. A final attempt to land troops under cover of fire to get Brown is called back after the ship's repairs are complete and the Germans must be underweigh.

Just as they are emerging from the inlet, Rennie and his squadron appear and finish off the raider. A German officer's report after he is captured informs Rennie that a British sailor on Resolution has held them up single handedly. The story ends with Rennie and Brown awaiting a ceremony with the king where Rennie will be knighted and Brown will receive the Victoria Cross. Brown is also awaiting the arrival of his mother from Canada, Wendy Hiller.

This is a classic adventure story with true heroes and enemies who are simply foemen, not villainous monsters. The acting is superb. Hunter does a great job as seaman Brown: young, enthusiatsic, devoted to duty. Rennie and Hiller, though really in supporting roles, are terrific as young lovers who meet and part in wartime. The DVD also contains an alternate ending to the story.",1217635200,,3051,4.727443609022556
2732391,5,B000MGBLJG,"I bought this movie based on the description listed on Amazon, not knowing anything about the movie. I was very surprised to see a consistently well acted movie throughout.  There were terrific acting performances all around.  Even if you don't care for war movies, you could still appreciate and enjoy this film--my wife did!  It is quite simply a well made, well acted movie.  The only thing I wish was different was that I wished the black and white could have been color. It is very much worth your time and money!!",1217030400,,519,4.608695652173913
2732392,5,B000MGBLJG,"This is a movie that every WW2 collector should have on their shelf. Jeffrey Hunter plays, I think one of his best roles ever, excellent plot and story. I really enjoyed this movie, yes I recommend it, not a bad price either. This is a real winner.",1215475200,,248,4.297872340425532
2732393,5,B000MGBLJG,"I'd always enjoyed this movie on TV and was glad to be able to add it to my DVD collection.  Not having seen it in a while there were scenes I did not remember, particularly at the beginning.  I suspect TV stations tended to snip the early scenes to add commercial time since the film-maker took the time to insert something a lot of modern movies don't bother with: Plot Development.  The original 'British' ending probably makes the film more dramatic but I prefer the happier 'American' ending; It makes the movie more re-watchable.
  The transfer is clean and sharp but be advised that despite what it says on the box, this movie is (and always was) in black and white.",1205884800,6,673,4.528925619834711

The story is intriging and captivating.  Even though the script is not one of the finer war story scripts, the film is worth seeing, especially for Jeffrey Hunter fans.",1205193600,2,409,4.513513513513513

The Alternate Ending (the British original, as I've read) is by far the best.  Wendy Hiller's performance in the final 30 seconds on that ending are Oscar-quality.  Took my breath away.  Just great.",1199318400,3,363,4.966666666666667
2732406,3,B000MGBLJG,"This was a good movie but I would classify it as an OLDIE vice a CLASSIC.  It was an enjoyable war flick but not one that I would like to over and over.  The story was fairly realistic but it could have been more of a war flick and less of a predictable love story.  Although, this is a decent movie, it is in my ""trading stack"" since my collection is too large to justify keeping average movies.",1197417600,,396,4.051282051282051
2732407,3,B000MGBLJG,"I had in my mind a film about a man in the navy  who with just a rifle and hidden on a rocky outcrop held off  German sailors  and saved the day. I finally tracked it down and watched it last night. Ah no, not Sailor of the King, but Forever England. Same story, same writer but made years before hand with a very, very young John Mills. I felt that something was missing and it was, I had originally seen this version which was expanded and more developed. An very good film, but if you get the chance have a look at the original. Simple, short and very British. I have not seen the US ending of this film which of course will be rather , well American, after all even Darth Vader had to be a goodie in the end. Never mind still an good film no matter what ending.",1191024000,3,765,4.019736842105263

2732409,4,B000MGBLJG,"Maybe not the greatest war flick ever made, but a worthy example of some highly competent work by Director Ray Boulting, one of the principles involved in the evolution of British Lion Films Corp. Though Boulting's later films were often little more than generic comedies (including some work with Peter Sellers), this film is a good example of his earlier, more ""morally earnest"" work. The hero, who undertakes a lone mission from which he knows he will not return, is contrasted with both a flaky English officer and a fatalistic German commander. Some years ago I read somewhere that this story of a single hero seaman was based on an actual incident from World War II. In any case, the combat sequences are superbly produced - no wonder, since Boulting himself saw similar combat during the period this story covers. The sniping sequence is beautifully executed and edited -- you really do feel as if you're up there in the rocks when the artillery barrage surrounds you. The DVD is among the best b&w transfers around - clean, clear, film-like, with little of the digital over-sharpening often seen with monochrome; and the camera work is exceptional. Performances from all are quite good. Jeffrey Hunter looks even better here than he did in John Ford's ""The Searchers"" - with looks and talent like his, one questions why Hunter didn't achieve superstar status. The plot itself seems as if it had undergone a major revision at some point: the beginning and ending sequences seem as if they were designed to support some message about heroism and individual responsibility. But the message is murky, as if the writers weren't quite willing to make the commitment. Had they done so the film likely would have been raised to a near-classic level.  The middle action portion is superior to the start or finish and works well as an action movie on its own. You might get an idea about the script's supposed overall purpose by watching the alternate British ending, which was not shown in the USA (the original British title was ""Single-Handed""). Deficiencies of message aside, this is a memorable combat film that apparently cost a King's ransom to produce. It's a simple tale, compellingly told.",1188345600,38,2197,4.905913978494624
2732410,4,B000MGBLJG,"Overall a good WWII movie. Starts with some romance and then changes to the lives ot two men aboard British naval ships. One a Captain played by Michael Rennie and the other a signalman played by Jeffrey Hunter. Now I may have missed something but I didn't see a clear line drawn between the two, only a possible hint of it. And there is suppose to be a line. The movie starts a little slow but soon gets into the rousing action of British ships tracking a German Raider that has sunk several ships. Good action, special effects, and acting make it well worth seeing. Jeffrey Hunter and Michael Rennie do very well in their respective roles as well as the support cast. I recommend it for the whole family. This is good and different enough from other WWII movies that I think it is worth owning.

Synopsis:
A young sailor becomes romantically involved with a woman he meets on a train while he is on furlough during World War I. They spend a night together after deciding to get married the next day. The next day they don't marry after she decides it won't work. Shift to action at sea during World War II around twenty years later. Jeffrey Hunter is a young signalman aboard a destroyer escorting a convoy. His ship and another ship are sent to catch a German Raider. His ship is sunk and he escapes off the German Raider with a rifle while it is conducting repairs at the Galapagos. The Germans are trying to get underway before the British ships reach them. Hunter wreaks havoc with the repair crew by sniping them and greatly hampering their efforts. - C. Luster",1185321600,12,1568,4.4825174825174825
2732411,5,B000MGBLJG,"It had been many years since I first saw Sailor of the King, and watching it again brought back many scenes I had forgotten. The romantic parts at the beginning were very mature considering the year the movie was made. The action was better than I remembered too. Even my wife who is not a war movie affectionado liked it. Seeing an alternate ending from a move made in the early 1950's was a pleasant surprise.",1184716800,6,411,4.421052631578948
2732412,5,B000MGBLJG,A very well done movie of a quality war/adventure story. Only one weapon gaff but it didn't significantly subtract from the viewing pleasure.

2732413,5,B000MGBLJG,"I'd been waiting for years for this film to be released on DVD.

This is a great story about man captured by the germans after his ship was sunk by them.

He manages to escape the germans after they have to pull into what amounts to a fiord

and manages to delay the repairs being done on the ship long enough to allow the british

fleet to arrive.

I don't want to give a lot of detail, just make it seem worth looking into.

2732415,4,B000MGBLJG,"Fox's homage to England's Royal Navy is a decent WW II film. Jeffrey Hunter is appropriately brave, and Michael Rennie is stoic and very British. The surprise is a very interesting Wendy Hiller in the first 20 minutes of the story and then again at the end. Included on the DVD is the alternate ending, which is also quite interesting for an early 1950's movie. The surface battle scenes are very fine.",1180396800,3,402,4.597222222222222

The ship that captured him sustains damage and has to put into a port for repairs. This is when Signalman Brown makes his move to escape. and hold off the enemy until his fleet can arrive. This is all I will say but I loved the performances of one and all and not only that the story was superb. 1953 gave us this movie and I thank them. The ending at the end of the movie was the much preferred one, at least by me, there is another alternate ending in the extras, didn't care for that one.
