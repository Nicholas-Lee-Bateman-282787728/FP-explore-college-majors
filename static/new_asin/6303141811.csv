Anthony Andrews is a good actor...dramatically, but he can't do comedy. Thank goodness when this actually was  on series TV , Christopher took over.. This just made me realize even more how much I miss him. He passed away last year, very untimely. Too sad.",1361059200,,410,4.694444444444445
7840175,3,6303141811,"I purchased this movie since I thought the actor pictured was the lead male in this movie.  However, he is not in this movie and obviously the studio must have used a still shot from a screen test with this actor.  This movie wasn't bad, but wasn't that great either.  Just my opinion.",1336521600,,285,4.339622641509434
