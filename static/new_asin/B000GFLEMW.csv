8131316,5,B000GFLEMW,"Paisiello may have been the most popular opera composer of his day, and this says much given his competition from Mozart, Salieri, Haydn and others. This is an excellent example of his music and is well done. The only weakness I find is that Colecchia is not convincing as an irresistible, flirtatious schemer. I have a copy to sell if interested.
