7897606,1,6305895813,I was really looking forward to using this tape but unfortunately things didn't work out and I have to send it back because there were to many black out spots . The instructor and her routine are really good. Who ever taped it or retapped it did not do a good job . :-(,1494115200,,269,4.0
7897607,3,6305895813,"Really awesome video, I love the work outs. I love the price. I think this instructor is amazing. But it broke in my VCR within a week. So sad :(",1391385600,,145,3.8666666666666667
7897608,5,6305895813,This video is a great workout for toning the upper body.  The first time did the Balance Ball Fitness - upper body I was soar the next day.  I was soar in the areas I wanted to tone so I new the workout was doing its job.,1311984000,,221,3.6808510638297873
7897609,3,6305895813,"I repurchased this after losing my original dvd in a move.  I like it for the shoulders, I think it's great for strengthening the shoulder girdle and arms to a lesser extent due to the angled push-ups sequence, but I don't think it does too much for your back unless it's pretty weak.  I combine it with Mari Windsor's Back and/or Upper Body workout to round it out a bit.",1268697600,,372,4.3
7897610,4,6305895813,"I like this program a lot.  It is a challenge, but doable.  I would recommend getting the lower body workout as well.",1168819200,,117,4.2727272727272725
7897611,5,6305895813,"After the first time doing this, my arms and upper body were sore for 2 days! This tape works muscles I didn't even know I had. Suzanne's yoga syle of exercise is very relaxing too.  After the workout, you'll feel refreshed and energized.  Pair this tape with another BalanceBall workout, and you'll have a great hour of exercise.",1046822400,,330,4.672413793103448
7897612,5,6305895813,"It combines yoga & pilates by using just a ball which in turn is loved by my 5-month old boy. It's creative & helps create awareness in movements. Unlike weight-training, this ball-exercise is more interesting  & efficient. Bravo!",960249600,,230,5.052631578947368
