8293684,1,B00000F2F4,Poor picture and sound quality,1466985600,,30,5.2
8293685,5,B00000F2F4,"Silly, sexy and fun! Eddie Deezen is his likable self. 80's Scream Queens Michelle Bauer and Debra Lamb look sexy as hell and show us their talents. Dawn Wildsmith is underused, but she's memorable (at least to me, as I'm a fan of hers).

Is it a laugh a minute? The answer is No. But has a great cast of low budget thespians!",1441843200,,326,4.174603174603175
8293686,1,B00000F2F4,Too stupid for words. I turned it off after 10 minutes.,1438819200,,55,4.090909090909091
8293687,2,B00000F2F4,silly comedy too silly for my liking,1433808000,,36,4.285714285714286
8293688,3,B00000F2F4,"This is one of those 80 comedies.  It is funny b-movie.  So if you enjoy a fun silly movie, then this will fit the bill.",1377475200,,120,3.76
8293689,1,B00000F2F4,I was looking for something to kill 90 minutes. I only made it through the first 15 minutes. I wish I could get those 15 minutes of my life back. You'll be better off counting ceiling tiles or ... anything rather than watching this,1374624000,,231,4.2727272727272725
8293690,5,B00000F2F4,"I found this movie funny and out of the ordinary.  Yes it's corny and not for children.  Eddie Dizzen is one hell of a funny actor, very dry in the way he speaks but funny in the way he reacts to compromisimg situations.  You must have a funny bone to enjoy the 1980's comedies.",1362009600,,278,4.111111111111111
8293691,3,B00000F2F4,"This is a dumb movie, but it's supposed to be dumb.  Even that isn't necessarily enough to keep you watching, but frankly, I found it very enjoyable.  There's some nice looking naked women, which helps.  And the jokes usually pay off with at least a chuckle or two.

But most importantly, it's got Eddie!  You know Eddie.  He's the voice of Mandark in ""Dexter's Laboratory"", and he looks exactly how he sounds.  Eddie Diezen will never get another starring role.  Never again will he get to play the hero.  This is his masterpiece.

I don't think it's worth the $75 asking price unless you're an Eddie fan (of which I'm not sure there are many), but it's worth a rent if you can find it.  Or you could shell out the big bucks and hope, as I do every day, that Eddie will once again rise to his place as a unique, amusing talent.

God bless you, Eddie.",1119312000,3,851,4.3164556962025316
