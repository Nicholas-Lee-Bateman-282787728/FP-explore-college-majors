8670084,5,B00M3TK89Y,"A sweet and well executed ""slice of life"" anime. Technically, the transfer is good and the background scenery is almost of Miayzaki quality, just gorgeous. And the difficult portions of having characters dance and sing was flawless.",1424217600,,232,5.297297297297297
8670085,5,B00M3TK89Y,"Tari Tari has a wonderful animation as expected from the people working at P.A. WORKS and now that sentai filmworks has released on bluray, we will be able to experience all the quality that deserves this anime.

To be honest I was so happy when was announced the bluray, nowdays anime from P.A. WORKS is better watching in HD

It's a series that shows us that everything can be accomplished by working as a team, learning from our mistakes, having fun with friends, staying together no matter what kind the situation is and unconditional support
An anime for everyone!!!
A TOTALLY WORTH IT SHOW!!",1417219200,4,597,4.730769230769231
