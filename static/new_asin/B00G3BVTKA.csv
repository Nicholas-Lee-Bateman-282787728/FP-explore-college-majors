6050413,2,B00G3BVTKA,"The film adaptation of Le bleu est une couleur chaude was incredibly disappointing.

Everyone seems to love this movie, and say its really sad and emotional and whatnot. But it was barely sad compared to the book.
The book can't even be considered to be on the same level as this boring piece of cinematography. The book was an extremely powerful, beautiful, dark and emotional story, whereas the movie was merely a vaguely compelling, overly long and kind of sad movie with too many bad sex scenes. Comparing the two is like comparing how strong Superman is as opposed to Jay Gatsby.

People give me many reasons why they think I may be biased, apart from having read the book, and all of these reasons don't really apply.
I have been told that its because I don't understand French. That's a bit silly, since my first language is French and not English.
I have been told that I must hate all long movies. You can think that, but most of my favorite movies are unusually long, such as Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago, Abel Gance's Napoleon, and many others.
Some people tell me I just dislike lesbians or gay people in general, and that is so untrue it's funny.

Point is I would suggest to anyone to read the book instead of the movie since it actually has a dramatic story, instead of just nice images for the most part. And to those who thought the movie was one of the saddest things ever, read the book, it will break your emotions into a million pieces, and it doesn't come packaged with glue.",1385337600,18,1503,4.498168498168498
6050414,5,B00G3BVTKA,"I just want to give everyone a heads-up that Criterion will be releasing a Special Edition for this film later next year. The film is fantastic, and I am giving it 5 stars, but the review is simply a heads-up in case you didn't know there was a better edition coming out later.

Criterion specifically says this on the product page for the movie:

""A full special edition treatment of this film will follow at a later date.""

I hope this helps someone. I know I'd be upset if I spend $20 on this basic edition, and then found out later that there's another coming out with a lot more extras included.",1385164800,427,600,4.339285714285714
6050415,4,B00G3BVTKA,"SPOILER ALERT!

Story of Adele (a 17-year-old junior in high school) and Emma (an adult painter who has colored her hair blue). Adele sees Emma one day on the street with another gal. Adele pleasures herself and thinks about Emma, though she as of yet does not know her name.  Adele hooks up with a guy but is not satisfied.

She goes to a gay bar to locate Emma.  They begin a physical relationship that the viewer gets to watch intimately and wonder if this is what it is really like.

Some years pass and they live together and satisfy each other, Emma paints Adele in the nude. Adele is a kindergarten teacher but wonders if she is enough for Emma.  When Emma stays late elsewhere Adele goes out to find comfort. This leads to the most painful break up scene perhaps ever to appear, sad and heart wrenching.

Some more years pass and they move on with their lives. A bit long, sub-titled. Many of the scenes are over meals.",1385164800,8,927,4.385964912280702
6050416,3,B00G3BVTKA,"At its core, this really describes the heat of first love, combined with the poor choices of teenagers - a disastrous combination that so many of us have experienced, one way or another. The famed scenes of physical affection seem entirely at home in this context. The relationship is hot and intense in every way, and I think the imagery supports that very appropriately.

But, despite the visual appeal of the leading ladies, this lies away from what I look for in movies. The breakup carried a gut-wrenching sense of reality, and what came after sounded mostly like rubbing salt in self-inflicted wounds. I can imagine many people appreciating the reality of it, but I mostly just found it painful.

6050417,5,B00G3BVTKA,"The film ""Blue is the Warmest Color"" is one of the absolute best films of the 21st century. It's a three-hour long romance epic about a young woman's struggle along the road to self-discovery. Adele, the leading lady, is a tour de force. She's an incredible presence on screen, and deserves an Academy Award for her work.

The film follows Adele's life as a high school student through young adulthood. She wants to become a teacher and loves literature, and her family. Her sexual discoveries as a young woman reach a climax when she meets an older art student, played by Lea Sedoux. The film follows their relationship, through explicit sex scenes, intense arguments, and passionate embraces.

Blue is the Warmest Color is in French, and many viewers will probably shy away because of the subtitles and running time. However, the rewards of watching this film are great. You will be moved, no doubt, by the masterpiece you are experiencing.",1384992000,13,942,4.88125
6050418,5,B00G3BVTKA,"Impressive acting, great directing and the plot is very well paced. You don't have to be into foreign movies to enjoy this.

6050419,4,B00G3BVTKA,"""Blue Is the Warmest Color"" (2013 release from France; 179 min.; original title ""La Vie d'Adele - Chapitre 1 et 2"") brings the story of Adele, a HS junior who is struggling to find her identity. As the movie opens, we see Adele, who lives in Lille, taking the bus to school, getting through the day at school, clearly enjoying her French Lit class, where they are discussing Marivaux's ""The Life of Marianne"", having dinner with her mom and dad (it appears Adele is an only child), and turning in for bed, so that she can do it all over again the next day. Adele has a few dates with Thomas, a senior. At one point Adele briefly crosses paths with a girl who has blue streaks in her hair, and for Adele it is ""le coup de foudre"" (love at first sight). Adele even dreams about her but it isn't till much later that she runs into the girl at a gay bar. The girl's name is Emma, and even though Emma has been with another girl for 2 years, it isn't long before Adele and Emma fall for each other. At this point we are just over an hour into the movie. To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, there is good reason this movie won the Palme d'Or at this year's Cannes festival: this is an epic relationship movie that will move you to your core (and perhaps also shock you). Let's immediately address the infamous sex scenes: yes, they are very graphic, so be forewarned. If you take offense to nudity, save yourself the trouble (and money), and go see another movie, seriously. Second, the acting performances are nothing short of monumental, none more so than Adele Exarchopoulos, in the title role. Surely this will get Oscar Best Actress consideration. Considering she is only 19 years, the sky is the limit for this talented actress. L&eacute;a Seydoux in the role of Emma is quite good too, but clearly in the shadows of Exarchopoulos. Third, I was amazed at how quickly this film flew by. It must be that I was so absorbed by how Adele's life is unfolding on the screen that I completely lost track of time (this isn't giving anything away, but the events in the movie play out over a number of years). Due to the sheer length of the movie and the graphic nudity, this movie clearly isn't for anyone, so be honest with yourself whether this is something worth checking out (if Iron Man 3 is your favorite movie of the year, this is likely not for you).Last, if you wonder how Jean-Paul Sartre and Bob Marley are more similar than you ever imagined, just watch! The movie will explain all.

I had seen the trailer a couple of times and couldn't wait to see this. It finally opened at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati (on 2 screens even, a rarity), and I went to see it today. The matinee screening wasn't particularly well attended, but when I left the movie theatre, a long line had formed at the box office for the evening show. The movie's credits including the movie's title appear only at the end, so I was quite surprised that the original French title makes a reference to ""Chapter 1 and 2"", which seems to indicate that we may not have seen the very last of ""the life of Adele"", which would be great news indeed. If you are interested in a quality foreign movie that is conversation-driven and examines relationships (including some graphic sex), you cannot go wrong with this. ""Blue Is the Warmest Color"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY BRECOMMENDED!",1384560000,49,3469,4.478672985781991

Emma, is more experienced compared to Adele, and the scene towards the end of the movie with the break up has great chemistry.  Adele simply didn't understand the 'rules'.  So Adele, who is barely out of high school, doesn't understand the dynamics of the relationship that was developing.  This is not a short movie (179 minutes) and it takes its time to develop the story and relationships.

6050446,5,B00G3BVTKA,"A beautiful and intense take on lesbian love in a modern era with a very respectful and complex perspective on the issue. Lea & Adele give masterful performances demonstrating real emotion in every scene of this absolute masterpiece of film. The best romance drama film I have ever seen in my life!

Gorgeous cinematography, direction, colors, lighting, and environments build up the amazingly thoughtful script and the incredibly subtle acting performances of the two leading ladies. Lea & Adele have such loving chemistry and give the performances of a lifetime.

Blue Is the Warmest Color absolutely deserved and earned the Palme D'or at Cannes. This is a very faithful adaptation of Julie Maroh's graphic novel Blue Is the Warmest Color with the exception of the ending, which I will not spoil. But I will say the emotional impact of this film left me with a similar emotional state as did the novel.

A harrowing tale of unrequited love, coming of age story, sexual curiosity and maturity, and the most profound and complex look at love as there has ever been captured on film. Artistic in style, while also being so totally relatable and personable in its portrayal.

I highly recommend Blue Is the Warmest Color.",1497398400,4,1219,4.931707317073171
6050447,1,B00G3BVTKA,"Please note that this is a review of the Blu-Ray, NOT the movie itself.

So I originally bought this movie on the Criterion Collection dvd and I was more than happy with it because I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!

BUT, that was before I saw a video on YouTube with this guy who had bought it on Blu-Ray. However, his Blu-Ray looked different from all the other Blu-Rays I had seen up to that point. He explains in the video that he had purchased it from this company called, ""Plain Archive"" which I guess is based out of South Korea. So after watching the video, I decided to look them up and they had a collection of Blu-Rays they make special. Meaning, they don't look like versions we usually see online. Another thing to point out is that, I guess they only make so many copies of any particular title. Like this one for example, I think they only made around 1-2000. So I saw they had a copy, but when I went to see how much it was and what special features, if any, they had, it listed that this item was out of stock. Meaning, I thought I was out of luck and I was pretty bummed about that.

But then, I decided to see if they had any for sale on ebay. And to my surprise, they did. They had a copy from Plain Archive for $40 and free shipping. Plus, it was brand, spanking new. So the very next day, I purchased a copy and it immediately shipped. It didn't take long for it to get to me either. That was another surprise.

But now comes another surprise and the half empty. So I get it, I unwrap it and I immediately decide to watch the special features which consist of a trailer, deleted scenes and interviews with the director and star Adele who plays Adele in the film. I usually wait until after I view a movie before I watch deleted scenes, so I decided to watch the interviews. To my surprise and shock, all of the subtitles are in Korean. Yes, the Blu-Ray does indeed give you subtitle options. Korean, English and French. But it didn't seem to matter because no matter what, the subtitles are always in Korean. The deleted scenes all have Korean subtitles as well. Even the trailer has Korean subtitles. The only thing that isn't subtitled in Korean is the actual movie. I don't need the Blu-Ray for that because I still have my dvd version. And it also doesn't help that everybody is speaking in French. I'm not blaming the people involved with the movie, I'm blaming Plain Archive for not allowing us to view the special features with English subtitles. I don't mind watching foreign movies, just as long as I can understand what they're saying by the subtitles.

$40 down the tank. I couldn't believe it. And of course, I can't send it back because they don't allow returns. So my advice is, don't waste your money on this movie if you want to get it on Blu-Ray from Plain Archive. Unless you speak and understand Korean and French.",1494633600,,2842,4.344632768361582

6050449,4,B00G3BVTKA,"It was a relationship that was doomed from the beginning because of Emma's arrogance. She became increasingly condescending toward Adele and didn't place any value on her vocation as a teacher of children. Emma thought that only people entrenched in the avant garde were intellectually worthy whereas I felt that Adele had far more to offer to society than Emma's garish commercial art. It also seemed apparent that Emma was already cheating on Adele with her pregnant friend when she accused Adele of cheating on her. To me it looked as if Emma was just looking for an excuse to dump Adele, and through her emotional neglect either intentionally or unintentionally instigated Adele's need to seek companionship elsewhere.

The lesbian sex scenes seemed awkward and staged because they were stopping just short of actual sex. It looked more like a game of naked Twister rather than hot sex. They should have just gone for it.

I thought Adele should have gotten over Emma much sooner. Emma wasn't worth it.",1491523200,10,1006,4.946745562130178

6050492,2,B00G3BVTKA,"I really did not like this movie. Although it had potential to be good, and told a pretty good tale, it was twice as long as needed (pet peeve was the repeated shots lingering on the sleeping protagonist's pouty lips and child-like face). And the acting of the lead was pretty dismal - the only time she seemed to be enjoying herself was in the sex scenes and when she was crying, the rest of the time she was mostly lifeless, and she seemed so young Interestingly enough her character was written to have much more depth than she was able to bring to it. So eventually it left me cringing at her lack. Just about everyone else's acting was very good, but the story was all about her. To be fair it must have been very hard to cast a suitable lead - young, physically attractive and willing to do graphic sex, but also fill a complex part emotionally. She fulfilled the first requirement at least.

Yes, I got that it was an existential allegory - broadcast with the discreet mention of Sartre', but kind of taken as a given just because it was French. But an allegory of what - youth, innocence, maturation, carelessness and the inexorable loss that is relationship? But all that just seems like so much adolescent angst, which makes it a typical female coming of age story (with the lesbian twist), kind of interesting, but probably better for someone who is young and in the middle of it all.",1472860800,2,1395,4.470588235294118

Others have written such eloquent comments here, they've obviously been as profoundly touched as I have, so I'll just say a few things. My perspective is that of a pretty cynical 64 year old straight man with my fair share of romantic scars and happy memories.

First and foremost, this indescribable performance by Adele Exarchopoulos is... well, it may be the most powerful, gut wrenching and skilled film performance I've ever seen. In my entire life. She had me in tears twice. Second, director Abdellatif Kechiche deserves limitless praise. A three hour film without a wrong note, a three hour film leaving you wishing for three hours more. A film to remind you how, especially in your youth, true love is both blissful and crushing. There's one scene here that I doubt I'll ever be able to watch again.

6050533,3,B00G3BVTKA,"This film had some very fine moments but in the end, at 3 hours long, it should have generated more enjoyment or thought than it did. Contrary to some reviewers, I enjoyed the movie most before the affair began, when we saw the lead dealing with school and becoming infatuated with a mysterious slightly older woman who found her touching and amusing. Once the affair began, I lost interest, especially as the lead female grew older but seemingly never matured, still constantly crying, frowning and pouting her way alone through life, even when surrounded by beauty (art), pleasure (lovers and good food), purpose (students, protest movements), and ideas (intellectual and philosophical conversation, great literature, great teachers). I'm not sure if the almost cartoonish sex was a man's idea of lesbian or naughty school girl erotica, or if it was meant to showcase Emma's immaturity or her narcissistic personality (more like today's young people I think than those of that time), but none of the sex scenes worked. Even the seemingly endless dance scenes didn't have much life and frankly I found the pregnant lesbian character and the male actors the most charming of the lot. The ""meet the parents"" scenes had some good moments highlighting the differences between the lovers. But the dragged out party scenes and scenes of the children in school...what's with that? Where was the editing?  I'm no expert on camera work but the constant close-ups on the pouty lips and snot must have been awful on a movie screen. And the one crucial scene that was missing: Emma's attraction to her male co-worker and affair. Nice ending though with the Emma in the portraits being more vivid than the blue-clad woman (albeit with a new hairstyle...perhaps a new life ahead?).  However, I don't think the movie was a bomb: the characters were very well portrayed and it was fun to see French culture brought to life so vividly. Someone will have to tell me if it was a realistic representation of young French people's lives at the time: in my day (1970s) and now, young women tend to travel in pairs or packs--Emma seems rather odd almost always by herself on the one hand like a shy nerd, and yet out clubbing and sexually adventurous on the other. And a contradiction: reading and loving literature, but incapable of much intellectual discussion or writing. In the end, I wish the movie had been about her gay friend and his clubbing adventures. Or the failed actor in Hollywood.",1458691200,,2474,4.8880952380952385

6050543,5,B00G3BVTKA,"I love this movie. In every way possible I can express. It allows you to grow a heart of love, feel the power of enthrallment, teaches (perhaps for the first time) what intimacy is all about in countless ways, and yet shows you that unrepentant cruelty exists in the world.

This is a spoiler alert. If youve not seen this movie, you definitely need to do so. But don't read the rest of this review because it is going to dissect just one scene in its entirety, which will ruin the experience for you. Just so you know, the scene in question is the single most powerful performance in the theater Ive seen since Jack Nicholsons Col. Jessup gave his YOU CANT HANDLE THE TRUTH speech (which incredibly took just one take). Its that powerful. I memorized Jessups entire speech because of the unyielding belief in self-righteousness expressed by Colonel Jessup.

So here it is. Im assuming youve seen the movie, so no set-up is given. Adele (magnificently portrayed by the most beautiful Adele Exarchopoulos) is driven home from a party by a male teacher. The first clue something is amiss is she directs him to drop her off at the wrong door, telling you she doesnt want him to know where she lives. She then walks down the block and enters the home she shares with Emma where she is immediately confronted. Already, you can see Adeles face grow troubled, as her face is an unvarnished window into her soul this entire movie. (There has rarely been an intro into the cinematic world as sublime as that given by the divine Exarchopoulos.) It is as if she is playing herself, and the movie is so wonderfully acted, it becomes impossible to know exactly where the actress herself ends and the character she portrays begins.

When confronted, she first lies. But Emma is too worldly, with too much sexual experience and indeed power, to be fooled. Emma pushes, and pushes, and still pushes more, until Adele is forced to admit it was a man, not a woman, who dropped her off. Pushed more still, she admits its true, that she did have sex with him. But here is, in my opinion, the cleverest line of the movie. Maybe two or three times she admits to under forceful attack.

But look at that line for a second. Had she said just once, she could have explained it away as mere self exploration. Emma is well aware that Adele had sexual congress with a male just once in her life, around age 16, many years ago, and may have accepted that explanation as a one off issue. This possibly could have saved Adele. That she instead admits it was more than once, means she is sure to face a harsh penalty.

Two or three times? Not possible. Why? Because if true, she would remember exactly how many times it was. Twice everybody remembers, and three, again, shed know that too. So, in fact, shes admitting to five or more when the mind starts to grow fuzzy in the count, and Emma is smart enough to know that. Thats why she stops pushing to find the exact number, because the damage is now done and cannot be walked back.

But the flaw here for Emma is that she, too, cheated. As you may recall, when they're on the park bench talking much earlier in the story, she admits to being in a relationship for about two years, with Sabine. Shortly after that (a week?) comes the first love scene, which by all accounts, happened before Emma ended her prior relationship. It is this hypocrisy which makes her actions here the more cruel to Adele.

Now that Adele has admitted the infidelity, she can no longer parry Emmas rapacious attacks. Emma, being stronger, more worldly, and older by about six years, is in every way the more powerful of this unequal couple in mind and body, except in the love they deeply hold for each other.

The acting here is incredible. I can FEEL Adeles shame at her transgressions. I can TASTE Emmas anger: I can SEE the relationship, within the briefest of moments, slip away into a verbal slugfest in which no one can end up a winner. Unable to fight back, Adele is back on the high school sandlot, being attacked by the cabal of bullies, but there, she at least put up a fight. Against the superior Emma, she has no defense. Her face is vivid in details of her destruction. You can see her body back away slightly, as if the vitriol being leveled against her has heft, has a weight of its own, and her body cannot withstand the blows. She has lost her will, and its terribly painful to watch in every way. My wife cried during this portion.

The cruelty with which Emma attacks is startling. Always seen as loving and tender, especially during her drawing sessions of her muse, she has replaced her gentle stroking brush using words as rapiers, which stab at her lovers heart, and intensively so. Repeatedly. She gives no quarter, and as quickly as it started, it is done, as is their love. She hits Adele in a manner that so startled me, I felt the blow myself, and it hurt. Adele is lost beyond words.

Adele is like a young girl in the ocean, standing alone without a mother to guide her as Emma had guided her through the initiation of their love. A wave knocks her off her feet. She struggles, becomes upright, only to be knocked over again, and again. She ultimately becomes exhausted, and without help to set her upright, she lays in the water, smothered with the fury of the ocean, as it sucks her deeper down with a vengeance. There is no escape, and she must finally accept the fact that for some reason, fair or otherwise, she has lost this battle and the only response is to drown slowly in the sorrow of a life seemingly lost to indiscretion.

When Emma physically removes Adele from the home, she slams the door so hard, the window bursts. This is done with great effect and is a masterstroke. Its not glass breaking. Rather, its a relationship that is gone, and like the glass metaphor, it cannot be repaired, only replaced (which Emma does with her pregnant friend). Adele cries to be let back in, into the apartment and the life and arms of the woman she still loves, but there is no swaying Emma, and the entreaties go unanswered.

I don't speak French. For this scene, you don't need to, nor need subtitles. Everything they say is conveyed in their body interpretation of what their mouths are saying. I stopped reading the subtitles, dazzled by the flying French and the expressions they elicit. Some things simply don't need translation.

Adele never went back to the place where her love was extinguished, either afraid of what she might find or hear, or realizing there was nothing she could do to calm the hurricane that has wiped her lovers beauty off the map. When they meet at the diner, about three years later (we know that due to the age of the children she had with the lover who was pregnant at her graduation party that Adele did all the work for), we see two former friends, and the rest is beyond the scope of this review.

The book upon which this is based has not Adele, but Clementine. Why the name change? I suspect because once Adele Exarchopoulos was selected for this part, they wanted her to BE the Adele she was portraying. Studies show that even in obtunded individuals, brains respond to often just one thing, and thats their own spoken name. It's engrained into our psyches. By calling Adele by her real name versus Clementine, she BECOMES Adele, and that is very powerful.

I believe the director, who was apparently difficult to work with (but worth the effort), has taken every trick out of his playbook to turn a book, which has a different ending, into a masterstroke of a movie. The acting is so real, at times I felt as though I were watching a documentary about love, lust, voracious passions, cruelty, abandonment, and every emotion in between.

My wife and I are still discussing this movie five days later. Its that powerful.

If you are going to see one movie this year, this is the one to see.

One last comment. The intimate scenes, the first of which lasts approximately 10 minutes, are not gratuitous in any manner. They are integral to this story of girl meets girl, girl comes out, girl finally loves girl. They convey how tender, powerful, forceful, sweaty and even how much work love takes. It is artistic beyond words. At times, I was wondering where one or the other women had disappeared to, only to realize their bodies were intertwined in loving embrace, making them become one where two had previously existed. To call this pornography is to call Michelangelos David just a sculpture. It is beautiful to watch, and is something you cant help but wish you had in your very own life. Sadly, few do. And thats the real shame here, because in the end, neither do Emma or Adele.

This type of experience comes along so rarely, it is to be treasured. I will watch it over and over in the coming years.",1456358400,6,8775,4.517958412098299

Filmed and set in Lille, France, at its core the film is a coming of age romance between two young women.  Adele (Adele Exarchopoulos, Pieces of Me) is a high school junior, anticipating a career in teaching young children.  Sexually inexperienced she rendezvous with a senior boy.  The explicit sexual encounter leaves her unfulfilled, but she continues to date the boy.  Walking to school one day she passes by a somewhat older young woman with blue hair.  They exchange glances, smile and move on.  Later in her French literature class, students read chapters of Pierre de Marivauxs La vie de Marianne, highlighting passages dealing with the concept of love at first sight.  The stage is set.

Adele goes with her gay best friend to a bar he frequents.  She seems out of her element and is clearly looking for a chance encounter with the girl with the blue hair.  She leaves and goes down the street a bit and finds the lesbian bar.  Adele is young, cute and again out of her element, but finds what shes looking for.  The blue-tressed Emma (Lea Seydoux, Spectre) snuggles up to the bar with her but has other plans.  So after a short chat, both depart.

Surprisingly, Emma shows up waiting for Adele after school the next day.  Things move slowly until they dont.  Director Abdellatif Kechiche (The Secret of the Grain) pulls no punches when it comes to the sex scenes.  The first sexual encounter between Adele and Emma lasts 6 or 7 minutes on screen and leaves little to the imagination.  I haven't seen anything like this in a mainstream movie sincewell, anything by Lars von Trier.  While Emma is out and an experienced lesbian, Adele is new at it.  But, shes very good at it, at least sexually.

Kechiche has an obvious oral fixation and Im not just talking about sex.  There are numerous scenes of the characters eating.  Close ups of sloppy red sauce spaghetti, another with slippery oysters and so on.  Adele is a crier by her own admission.  And when Emmas art career begins to blossom, Adele feels lonely and cuddles up with a fellow teacher.  A dude.  A breakup is inevitable and the film lingers forever on Adeles attempt at reconciliation with Emma.  Ms. Exarchopoulos is excellent in the role.  She can command flooding tears and snot running down her face, seemingly any time.  Her character becomes more annoying as the lengthy movie plods along.

As far as the sex scenes, yep they are long, explicit and border on voyeurism.  There are 5 sex scenes between Adele and Emmabut whos counting.  Three are in full monty mode.  Still, they are a small percentage of the 3 hour running time.  This is a technically well done film.  Nicely shot, with terrific sets and background.  While the sex scenes are steamy and the relationships well fleshed out, I had a hard time getting too wrapped up in the one-dimension story line.

Criterion took a rare step and delivered this relatively new movie quickly and at a low purchase price.  It comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 2.38:1 aspect ratio.  Here are the notes Criterion provided inside the accompanying booklet:

""The film was shot with a Canon C300 digital camera, and the entire production was completed in a fully digital workflow. The final color-corrected DPX files were output to Rec. 709 high-definition color space for Blu-ray and DVD release. This master was approved by director Abdellatif Kechiche.

Colorist: Elie Akioka, Marc Boucrot/Film Factory, Clichy, France; Eclair Laboratories, Epinay-sur-Seine, France.""

With a lot of skin to focus on, the camera shows wonderful skin tones.  Worn fingernail polish, skin blemishes, hair stubble and even raised blood vessels are all clearly visible.  The only audio track is  DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and it is problem free as well.  There isn't much going on in the surrounds outside of the club scenes, but the dialog is crystal clear and easily understood.  The film is in French with easy to read English subtitles.  Skimpy extras include a trailer, a TV spot and an essay by critic B. Ruby Rich.",1453766400,16,4269,4.800550206327372

6050559,5,B00G3BVTKA,"There has been so much talk about this movie not only in the lesbian community, but also in the media. A lot has been made about the sex scenes and whether or not they are true to life.  First of all, I don't think that we can say what ""real lesbians"" do or don't do behind closed doors because EVERYONE is different so if that is the biggest thing that someone is taking away from this movie, they are completely missing the point. There are so many great aspects about this film that are being overshadowed because of the discussions about how ""real"" the sex scenes are.

That being said, what I enjoyed about the movie is it details the life and struggles of the main character, Adele, over the span of a decade. She learns what that first young love feels like, as well as all the pain, insecurities, doubt and heartbreak that can come because of it.  I think this film does a fantastic job at showing how someone struggles with all of these things while on the road to learning how to become an adult.

Yes, as some reviewers have stated, there are some parts of the movie that were either not explained well enough, or the film could have just done without, but overall, I think this is probably one of the top 3 ""lesbian movies"" I have seen  IMO. The sex scenes are pretty intense so I wouldn't recommend watching this with someone you might be uncomfortable watching those with and if you don't like reading subtitles then you should steer clear. Otherwise, I HIGHLY recommend this movie!",1451779200,,1496,4.465201465201465

6050585,4,B00G3BVTKA,"Based on the French comic of the same name by Julie Maroh, Blue is the Warmest Color tells a story of romance and heartbreak in intimate detail. The story follows Adle (played by Adle Exarchopoulos), a beautiful young high school student as she discovers her own sexuality and feelings over the course of a few years and an intense relationship with Emma (La Seydoux), an older lesbian art student.

The movies incredibly personal and intimate with the presentation of what could otherwise be a familiar and simple story. A major part of this has to be due to the lead actresses and the director. The acting is extremely naturalistic and believable, benefiting greatly from the handheld camera style of filming. Both of the leads give incredible physical and emotional performances, rendering their acting invisible. Theres no ignoring the sense of reality in the intimate world they inhabit, and their romance sizzles off the screen with its emotional power. They radiate personality and subtly during dialogue and conversations, and even scenes where nothing is being said at all can be read and interpreted.

Whats almost instantly noticeable is Adle Exarchopoulos, and this could very easily be a star making role for her (if it hasn't already in France). Theres no denying that the camera loves her, and quite possibly because director Abdellatif Kechiche does as well. Theres an almost fetishization to the way he films her, adorning her with frequent close ups over almost every inch of her body, often putting a great deal of attention on her large sensual lips. Kechiches eye is infatuated with her face and her mouth, and they take the focus of almost every scene. Because its shot using frequent handheld cameras, shes presented to us through his eyes in a more practical sense, being shown exactly how he sees her. Given that, its nearly impossible not to share in his infatuation.

Its a modern equivalent of the way Josef von Sternberg filmed Marlene Dietrich or Alfred Hitchcock filmed Grace Kelly, and it adds a great deal of captivation and emotional resonance to the movie and her performance in particular. Needless to say, theres not a single scene in this movie without her.

The feelings of the characters and the actresses themselves are laid bare for the story, and the filmmaking only adds to this. You get a terrific feel for the relationship and their romance, as rollercoaster as it is without reeking of melodrama or soap opera. The love depicted here is a passionate and intense one, dominating every aspect of Adles life. Its love at first sight, and nothing else will come close.

The sex scenes are filmed to match this, being very explicit and graphic in their depiction. Even still, they feel appropriate for the emotions being conveyed as well as the passion behind them. Its a highly intimate examination of their love affair and nothing is left out, other than the more common clichs you might expect from a story of this nature. The focus is never even truly about her sexuality, though it does play a key factor. I get the sense that its not about her being a lesbian or bisexual, but more her being struck with her intense emotional connection with another human being.

Blue is the Warmest Color is a powerful and captivating examination of youth and sexuality, crossing the boundaries of gender in a way that feels so effortless in spite of its simplistic brilliance. Its pure emotion onscreen, given to us in all of its glory.",1443225600,4,3470,4.872881355932203
6050586,2,B00G3BVTKA,Slow.... And i like slow but this was beyond slow.... At the end you are left... well you are just left because not much happens.  And i don't mind sex scenes but if you aren't ok with them do not get this movie.,1443225600,,212,3.9302325581395348
6050587,5,B00G3BVTKA,"If you can't tell from the cover, Blue is the Warmest Color is a lesbian movie.  However, the story is even more French than it is lesbian.  The story ends practically where it began, except that the student has become the teacher.  Parents have no idea what their teenagers are doing, such as having sex with adults, everyone smokes like a chimney, and nobody cares that the teens are drinking alcohol in public or in bars.  There are discussions about French philosophers, and lots of eating of excellent food.  Music is emphasized, as well as art, and there is a theme of colorsblue, of course, and also red.  Having seen French films before, I found the plot somewhat predicatable, although that may have been intentional, to convey the sense of inevitabilty, or fate.

Do not read the summary on the back or the chapter list if you wish to avoid spoilers.  However, you can read the very long essay in the booklet inside, as it is a long, eloquent, positive review of the film.  In it, one B. Ruby Rich discusses the public reaction to the film, and points out that the pornographic scenes make up only about 10% of the runtime.  This fact surprised me, as they certainly felt longer, partially because each begins and ends part way through the act.  There is no build-up, or wind down time shown.  After a sudden transition, there it is!  Then without so much as a fade to black, the film skips to a very different scene, such as an awkward dinner scene.  What I really found fascinating was how the actress playing the main character could convey so much emotion without much expression.  I always knew what she was thinking, regardless of her words.

What really struck me, watching Blue is the Warmest Color, besides the terrible and awkward dancing, was the chemistry between the main characters.  They were so obviously drawn to each other, it was like watching magnets.  While the essay included in the case insists this is a tale of self discovery and one girl's journey and process of growing up, to me, I disagree.  It is the story of struggling with the inevitable, and the perceptions of society.  Love or societal acceptance?  Which do you choose?  Watch and decide!",1443052800,2,2184,4.662303664921466
6050588,5,B00G3BVTKA,"It's not often such very, very good movies are made - either from books or an original screenplay - that accurately and sensitively portray a young lesbian coming to terms with and accepting who she is in a world that works in nearly every way to upend or make that journey more difficult. At its core, this is the story of 15-year-old Adele, who does nearly everything in her power not to be who she is over the course of 5+ years: lesbian. Her struggle carries collateral damage to the older Emma, who has to weather the struggle with her girlfriend. Adele's parents come off much better in the movie than in the book, as do secondary characters. In the book, it's clearer that her inner turmoil emanates from sources other than just homophobic classmates. The sex scenes can be too raw for some, but that's the headstrong passion of young love, though any straight folks looking for a cheap thrill need to know the sex scenes are filtered through a straight motif by the director and the 2 lead straight actresses. The slight age difference and uncertainty of her identity of the 15-year-old and the college art student she falls for is the engine of her forward movement into partial acceptance, as well as laying the groundwork for the immaturity, insecurity and choices that will inevitably come between them. Though the central characters are lesbian, this is a universal theme of navigating first love, youth learning their core selves, loss and putting the pieces back together. In the end, youth learn we all get the life we make, tears and all. Both straight actresses do a decent job with their characters and with this story, adapted from the book of the same name. The screenplay does end differently than the book, so anyone who liked the movie would enjoy the book and vice versa.",1442534400,,1796,4.704761904761905

6050598,5,B00G3BVTKA,"Romantic films are not new nor are they a revolutionary concept for cinema. In fact, the love story precedes the film medium itself. One of the first classic works of art and literature was William Shakespeare's tale of ill-fated lovers, Romeo and Juliet. So what was it that made a relatively underground French art film catapult to international attention and later, universal acclaim? The answer is talent. This film has talent in spades, to the nth degree. Every single person involved, from the cast to the crew, have contributed something special to this film that elevates it above modern romance to something electrifying... something magic. Something blue.

The story itself, as previously mentioned, is simple and rather de-rigeur. The only thing that sets this cinematic relationship apart is the fact that it's between two women: one a budding, bookish high schooler who is relatively introverted compared to her boy-crazed, loud-mouthed friends. The other is a wise, street-smart and confident art student with blue hair. These two women, Emma and Adele (played by Adele Exarchopolous and Lea Seydoux respectively) are more than world's apart. They meet seemingly by chance on a street in downtown Lile, France, only to encounter one another again in what appears to be an almost fateful (if not orchestrated) meeting in a gay bar. What ensues is a wild romance than spans several years, changing the women in different ways. Their differences which may have had a hand in bringing them together initially eventually set them apart, leading to a volatile and ugly relationship breakdown.

As I said earlier in this review, the ensuing downfall of the women's love affair is probably predictable and perhaps even somewhat cliched, because a break-up is an inevitable climax for most youngsters in love. Something so wild and so hot has to end in equally wild and hot ways. And so the two women leave one another. What follows, however, and the way their relationship is handled, is anything BUT cliche. It is told with sincerity, with realism and without a contrived, sappy Hollywood happy ending. Mainstream cinema goers who have somehow managed to get their hands on this film will not be satisfied with the conclusion, but for those who appreciate realism, particularly French realism, the ending is very satisfying because it's a reflection of life and most aptly a reflection on young love. It rarely ends well and when it does, there's cause for celebration. But as is the case here, these two women needed to go their own way, forge their own path, build their own lives. There are fragments of scenes that reveal their bond may not be so healthy, particularly for introverted Adele, who seems to become dependent on Emma to be happy - ""I'm happy with you like this. It's my way of being happy"" she declares to Emma in bed. Adele is only young, with plenty of opportunity for love ahead of her, but it's her deep-seated attraction to this blue haired female-Casanova that penetrates every fibre of her being, consuming her heart and her head. She cannot move on, nor does she want to.

The film was not a success story from day one. Production problems plagued the US premiere back in 2013 and feminist/lesbian commentators kicked up a stink, claiming that the film is gratuitous and sexist in its depiction of girl-on-girl romance. They suggest it could have been handled more sensitively by a lesbian director. But does it take a lesbian to understand love? Shouldn't love be equal to everybody, considering it is a universal feeling. Aren't we already limiting and segregating same-sex relationships by suggesting that they can only be captured, told or fine-tuned in a worthy way by same-sex directors? I think Abdellatif Kechiche did a masterful job here, even if his behind-the-scenes candor was questionable. He's never militant about homosexuality, he sees these two women as people, not prisoners or victims of injustice hell-bent on making things right, politically or socially. They merely exist in their worlds, happy to be together, happy to be young and free and passionately in love. They aren't concerned with making a stance or turning their romance into political justice. I think this film is one of the greatest love stories I have ever seen. Very highly recommended.",1440201600,2,4306,5.01958041958042

The authentic, raw, true nature of the human mind, body, and soul was throughout the entire film. Right down to the very core of how we connect with another so intimately.

This film will sit heavy with you for days, if not for the rest of your life. It takes you outside of yourself, all the while making you bear down and realize the darkness, the beauty, and very core nature of whom you are yourself.

The film is quite 'graphic' in it's sexual content but, astoundingly and insanely intimate. It may be too graphic for some but, I can attest to how deeply these scenes affected me and my perceptions (which, if you didn't know, all of these scenes are very real, as the actresses  wanted an authentic portrayal of these moments, as well as the film in it's entirety).

This film has garnered much attention, stellar and filthy in it's critique. Good or bad, this film will make you feel something and definitely move you.

This film will take you outside of yourself, in every way possible. I've never seen or heard a film to be so true to form in how a relationship with the self, with a lover, a friend, and the family has ever been written, filmed, or visually portrayed.

It's quite easily, my number one favorite movie.",1431648000,,1303,4.449579831932773

I see some reviews have picked out the sex scenes and some have even stooped so low as to call them porn. Utterly ridiculous! To me, it was the most powerful love scene ever put to film. If that was acting, they should get an academy award for those scenes alone because you can feel the love and passion pour from the screen.  It was powerful in so many ways and without these scenes, the love between the characters would not be so powerfully laid out before our eyes.

6050654,4,B00G3BVTKA,"Director Abdellatif Kechiche executes this story by employing a visual and character naturalism that not simply tells a lesbian love story, but explores the complexities of relationships in general. There are long periods of intimate, completely realistic dialogue, which I understand to be because because the actors were often instructed to improvise. We are drawn into the intimacy through frequent extreme close ups, that unobtrusively leads us to appreciate textures of skin and people. There is an absence of soundtrack music; Kechiche instead chooses to emphasize sound, often people eating. I believe this is a play on orality

 As much as I enjoyed this film, I agree with part of the controversy that surrounded it that was due to the prolonged sex scenes. The intense sex scenes work and absolutely make sense, but they could have been edited down in terms of length. Because they werent, it reduced what should have remained erotic art to all but a hairline away from porn and sensationalism of lesbian sex for the heterosexual male. This only a tad bit took away the value of this film.

That is, we got lots of slice of life depictions of the two leads, especially the kindergarten teacher in action with her kids (as well as the college student artist and her intellectual companions).  These feel very realistic and offer a glimpse into French culture, but they do little to advance the plot in this three-hour film. The director is overly fond of extreme facial close-ups, but gets good performances from the actors.  The sex scenes have been controversial--and for good reason.  I can understand the director wanting to show the intensity of their passion, but the scenes seem essentially pornographic in style (two attractive lesbians in a variety of sexual positions).

3 hours

Holy cow, ahaha... these scenes were way too long!!!  The movie is way too long.  Yet outside of these lengthy scenes and wishing the cameraman would just back up a little... this was pretty awesome, lol.

Such potential.  I almost loved it for what it could have been with some better editing- ANY editing lol (and if a real lesbian woman had choreographed the sex scenes).  It's a very raw and emotional erotic lesbian romance which chronicles the coming out and coming-of-age of a young French school girl, Adle.  Too bad the ending was so sad and depressing for her.  Or geez, the whole beginning and the whole end are pretty sad, really.  And by that I mean TWO-THIRDS of this 3-hour movie... just sad and painful stuff.  But boy does she get an erotic ride in the middle.

The first 45 minutes or so of the film follows Adle in high school with her homophobic friends, a hunky guy she has no feelings for but boinks anyway (graphically)... and her burgeoning F/F experiences.  The real love story is between Adle and Emma.  Emma is an older, attractive artist with blue hair who only makes a passing but significant cameo in the opening 45 minutes.  She's a sexy tomboy-dyke and she does leave an intriguing first impression.

They eventually meet again in a lesbian bar and develop a friendship that soon turns into a very passionate and very sexual relationship.  And we get every naked minute of it, lol.  Yeah, the sex scenes were pretty pornographic (this isn't pretend sex, it's totally graphic and real) and no lesbian woman I can imagine would have played it out in this way, lol... but it's still better than porn because I could actually believe these two were in love and in lust with each other.  The genuine chemistry and emotional component I needed to buy into it did not get ignored. I think the film really captured something honest and lustful about young first love.

So we follow them through some years as they live together and where they discover they really don't have much in common outside all that hot sex.  Adle doesn't really fit in with Emma's artsy, intellectual friends... she just wants to teach elementary school and have a simple life.  This satisfies her.  Yet Emma has grand artistic aspirations and looks down on her and has a way of making her feel alone. Infidelity abounds.

The last 45 minutes is the harsh breakup and downward spiral of loss and learning to let go and move on for Adle.  It's pretty sad and emotional.

I can't believe the blue-haired lez is the same woman/fembot from Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol.  I'm floored at the transformation.  What a beauty.  Though I think my favorite lead in the film is Adle.  She had some of that Mary Louise Parker something about her that I find so sexy.  And her face conveys so much emotion and sensuality.  I wanted to see her with a woman who would treat her better and take care of her.  If it was a little happier in this regard, I'd probably watch it again.  But this one is much too depressing for me to put on my favorites shelf.",1426982400,2,3105,4.567028985507246

6050700,5,B00G3BVTKA,"Some movies will manage to entertain you for a night or two, but some will hit you like lightning. Inspiration is harder to find when it comes to movies these days, as blockbusters looking for nothing but box office success dominate the film industry. But every now and then, there comes a movie that will leave you speechless. Last week, ""Blue Is the Warmest Color"" convinced me that movies can still cross boundaries and offer more than just entertainment.

""Blue Is the Warmest Color"" introduces us to a young high school girl named Adele who unexpectedly falls for a college girl named Emma. We follow her journey through the path of finding who she is and who she wants to be. What makes this movie so special is that it doesn't follow the rules of the romance genre. It tries to define a new modern meaning for love, and it accomplishes its goal without a single flaw.

""Blue Is the Warmest Color"" is more than a movie. You will not be the viewer watching the screen. You will be the invisible camera following Adele, and you will lose yourself to the world in which she desperately searches for the truth that may be her only shot at finding peace.

Some may call this movie controversial due to its extended scenes of explicit sex, but I call this movie a piece of art that rarely happens. ""Blue Is the Warmest Color"" is the phenomenon that must be welcomed with open arms to keep more of its kind coming.

6050717,3,B00G3BVTKA,"Well, I'm often the type of reviewer here to be the calm voice of reason among a lot of pointless one sentence one star reviews or the dismay posted by those who feel they're doing the world a favor by telling them to avoid certain books, movies, etc because they are a waste of time. So it should be noted that I don't consider any book or movie I partake in to be a waste of my time, so much so that I long for the time or money spent with it back.  Whether I ultimately like them or not, the time spent was creative time gauging another person's artistic point of view.  That's how I go into it and frankly I am never disappointed in the outcome, again, whether I like the finished product or not.  I judge movies by whether or not I would watch it again.  If I would, then it's safe to say I liked it.  That being said, that's why I declined to give this movie the ""Four Star Like Review.""  I may just be inclined to give it one more watch, but it isn't one that will find a home on my DVD shelf with my genuine favorites. It was OK. This movie is for the open-minded.  It isn't a movie for a casual viewer.  This is not to come across as pretension. It's how I view all media.  Just saying.

So I will give the review of someone who watches movies for the mere interest in the story and the open mind to accept what is about the characters and the plot and not taint it with my own ""expectations.""  In all honesty, my interest in seeing it overall was probably piqued by the hype surrounding the sex scenes.  Let's just say I've seen my share of movie sex scenes. I was not offended by the portrayal here in any way. It was graphic in that very few movie sex scenes involve so much heavy breathing and actual grinding.  I'm not gay, and I don't feel it necessary to call the scenes an insult to the gay community, in an attempt to be one of those ""minority allies"" who totally ""gets"" the pain of a protected class.  If anyone in the gay community was insulted by the scenes as an inaccurate portrayal of gay sex, I'm sorry. Frankly, I think you're making it into a ""thing.""  The proverbial mountain out of a molehill.  And while we're on the subject of the accuracy of the sex, many feel it was blemished by the involvement of two many from the male persuasion and therefore depicts their clumsy and insipid fantasy of what two women do in the sack together.  This likely from women (and I am a woman) who feel there wasn't enough wine, flowers and romance involved in the scenes. While I am certainly a sucker for hearts and flowers and hopeless romanticism sometimes, I recognize also that some of the most passionate and tender--in its own way--sort of sex between two people in love, or lust as the case may be, is the kind that happens spontaneously with the ripping off of the clothes,  I can't keep  my hands off you right now fervor that Adele and Emma showed.

Some feel Adele, the character and the actress, were lifeless and dull and without substance.  I think you missed the point. That was in fact who the character of Adele was, so she was portrayed flawlessly to that respect.  Emma was the only one who brought out any level of passion and free spirited-ness in Adele.  Otherwise, you saw that around her family and supposed friends, she was lifeless.  Uncomfortable in her own skin, unable to express to people exactly what she felt and unable to let herself go.  Emma gave her life and ultimately that may have contributed to the downfall of their relationship.  While the character may have found freedom from her insecurities in one aspect of her life, she never truly found herself or grew as a person.  She lived for Emma and had no sense of self outside of/beyond their relationship.  Her dreams were small and mundane, and even when she dreamed slightly bigger than the world she was familiar with, she didn't take seriously her own dreams enough to actually consider seeing them through.

This movie is a character study. Some stories are like that. It's about the character's life, their growth, their change.  If you're looking for high drama, car chases, the supernatural and things exploding, you are certainly not going to find it here.  That makes the story slow-moving and uninteresting to some. I found every moment of Adele's life significant and a step on her path of life.  I was never bored with the things going on.  Something was always going on.  She was feeling and evolving and experiencing and discovering. She was loving and losing.  She ruminated and agonized.  Such is most people's lives.  Very few of us are ever involved in car chases or see dead people or are sought by knife-wielding killers.  As a result of much of this type of Hollywood standard, we've become numb to realism.  Apparently few want realism anymore.  They want total escape.  Therefore, movies that relate to ""reality"" are boring to people.  Even reality can be an escape, if you know how to look at it.  Like all media, this movie is not for everyone.  But those who know what it's supposed to be will take something from it.  It's not a porn movie made for [lesbian] women by women.  It's not high intensity drama.  It's not two pretty people who always seem to roll out of bed first thing in the morning with their hair in place and their skin glowing impossibly, or making love with perfect lighting and the strategically draped bed linens and the well-placed bead of sweat, and nary a glimpse of cellulite or body hair. It's a study of a relationship. What started it, what drove it and what caused it to collapse.",1421539200,22,5544,4.443564356435644

It was real in a way I've rarely seen...the emotional highs and lows of love were so palpable in Adele and Lea that I think my eyes were wet more often than not during the film. This is one of the very few films longer than three hours that I never grew bored of and wished to be longer (same category as Titanic and Once Upon A Time in America). Some may disagree, but I truly feel this film is one of the greatest I've seen. The extended sex scene was the only period where I felt somewhat uneasy, simply because it felt too invasive and overdone. But the actresses were fantastic. I fell in love with Lea Seydoux all over again every time she spoke. This film is a real treasure and a case study in life, love, mistakes, forgiveness and acceptance.",1419811200,2,880,4.33939393939394

6050768,5,B00G3BVTKA,"This film is hauntingly beautiful, sad, painful and yet, you can't stop watching.  It is a story that is about a high school girl Adele, played by Adele Excharpoulos, who feels all the awkward, uncomfortable pressure that most young men and women feel.  Friends pressuring her, while she is confused about her feelings.  Even though this movie is about a young woman and her delving into her feelings for both women and men, it is difficult not to identify with the painful awkwardness that we all feel as a teenager trying to sort it out.  Adele Excharpoulos is a sensational actress, and the tenderness of her relationship, her obsessiveness over her first real love played by Lea Seydoux was so real it was hard to watch at times.  In typical French form, the movie does not resolve the way you expect or hope.  American movies always have a resolution, typically a happy ending, but sometimes tragic.  Either way, the story has a resolution.  Some French films don't feel a need to leave you knowing what happens, leaving it to your imagination, which I love about French films. The sexual scenes are graphic, if that offends you, and most of them are female with female encounters, though not all of them.  But this film is so amazing the feelings, so real about the pain of young love, that it is a beautiful film that anyone can appreciate and likely relate to.",1417651200,6,1368,4.666666666666667

Mr. Donnelly summed up my thoughts on this movie perfectly:

""A breathtaking and monumentally powerful film with two of the best performances of recent years.

...reflects what it truly feels to be in love, and is also so achingly beautiful and sad and heartfelt and real as we watch the relationship progress, flourish and disintegrate through time.""

There was so much going on on so many levels: from color theory, to the way that the director was using symbolism, commentary on art and philosophy and love/relationships (emotionally, intellectually, and physically and the imbalances and inequality between this couple) and all of these subject's their very complicities. Truly a masterful portrayal of realism and film narrative.
On other levels, intellectually and artistically, all of the meaningful dialogue and discussions between characters and asides that comment back on the main story and on art (painting and painters) and philosophy also build and the (at times subversive) plot is never once the typical cliche film love story that you expect.",1414368000,3,922,5.194630872483222

6050800,3,B00G3BVTKA,"No reason at all this should be a three-hour film. So many scenes that are four minutes long could just as easily be two without losing anything. (Two of many examples: when Adele's schoolmates accuse her of being a lesbian; when Emma throws Adele out of the house. Both scenes marred by being too long, by -- even for the circumstances -- insipid dialogue.) This is, for all the hype and sex, a very pedestrian love affair gone wrong. She cheated, she lied, should it ruin her life? No. And it won't. (And why should it? Really: what does Emma offer Adele? Pretty much the same thing every other lesbian would offer her.)

What this film does very well is show us how excruciating that break-up can be, and the scene where Adele and Emma get together in the cafe some time after their affair has ended is probably the best in the film. Adele has been shattered by it. And Emma says just the right thing to her, which comes across as very sincere. In fact, if there's any real surprise in the film it's just how decent and three-dimensional Emma is, whereas Adele is striving for two. And when she gets over this relationship, as she will, w a guy or w a girl, she will achieve that third dimension.

GRAPHIC OBSERVATION: The filmmaker makes a serious error for a film w so much sex: there is not a single shot of any pubic hair. (Adele, we see in a quick shot, has none.) You can put these women in any position you want, doing whatever they like; but, in a film this (more or less) graphic you need what is called in the biz the establishing shot. To show viewers what precisely is the object of each's affection. (Pubic hair is close enough.) It needed only be a second or two long in any of the early sex scenes. That would have lasted the entire film. Yes, their faces or hands might be in that area, suggesting what they're doing, but we need that establishing shot, just once.",1413158400,5,1883,4.361823361823362

6050804,3,B00G3BVTKA,"This film tells the story of a French school girls coming of age, of her first real loving relationship -- both physical and emotional -- and her maturation into womanhood.  There is a lot of very raw emotion on display, as well as some very explicit sex scenes, both equally part of the plot.  The actors are to be commended for making it all so visceral and real.  That said, the film too often travels at a snails pace, with long atmospheric scenes which do little to service the story line.  There are too many weird jumps between scenes, too many instances of poor continuity.  It seems as though the director shot a great deal of background material and instead of trimming out the extraneous stuff, just spliced it all in at random spots, making the finished product seem overly bloated.  Over all, a moving film, but badly in need of better editing.",1412467200,3,857,4.568627450980392
6050805,5,B00G3BVTKA,"I love this film. I have watched it four times, delighted every time. Much of the credit goes to the two leading actresses, who are brilliant individually and in tandem. The older actress is familiar to me from a few earlier movies, including THE BEAUTIFUL PERSON
(utterly charming), the  bar scene in Tarantino's INGLORIOUS BASTARDS (I hated seeing her get killed in the cross-fire) and Raul
Ruiz's MYSTERIES OF LISBON, but the younger actress is completely new to me. Both give performances that merit superlatives.
They portray the tentative beginnings of love with effortless charm, and mime the passion of love with abandon. Both have breakdowns which burn the screen with intensity. And yet what I take away with me from each viewing is how R-E-A-L these two characters are to me. I don't see actresses performing; I see two human beings in the full flush of love, which is overwhelming and scary and the most beautiful thing on earth. There is a long scene at the end when two estranged lovers meet again, and it is one of the most wonderful pieces of drama I have witnessed. And I mean both meanings of drama - what actors do in make-believe and what people do in earnest. That scene  alone makes this one  of my necessary movies.",1412208000,4,1238,4.695852534562212

6050811,3,B00G3BVTKA,"This flick is grossly overrated.  I have given it a three-star rating only for its excellent cinematography.  The storyline is highly implausible and the dialog is mainly banal drivel.  Adele is beautiful and sensuous but is portrayed as far too serious and introspective for a girl of her age.  Yes, Adele has a sexy little mouth, but constant focus upon it in closeups becomes irritating and boring after the first thirty minutes of the film.  The strand of hair constantly in the face of Adele during her high school years is both irritating and distracting from her natural beauty and the story.  Equally irritating and distracting are the closeups of Adele and the other girls' sucking on their cigarettes.  This disgusting habit adds nothing to the story and only served as a glaring turn-off to me of the otherwise very beautiful girls.
OK, now to the sex scenes,...which, after all, is why anyone stays with this film for three hours.  The explicit sex is, for the most part, tastefully, if not convincingly portrayed.  Adele's and Emma's six-minute encounter becomes almost too overdone to endure as an observer.  I was relieved when it was over.  ( Even, after multiple orgasms, both Adele and Emma appeared to be relieved that the ordeal was at an end.)
For all of the hype surrounding this film, I felt that my time waching it was mostly wasted.  The ending was terribly ungratifying and left me feeling that an equally ungratifying sequel was in the works.",1411430400,2,1469,4.832

6050819,5,B00G3BVTKA,"I'll skip over my reaction to the romance scenes, as those are well-covered by the other Amazon customers -- except to say that the on-screen chemistry between La and Adle is undeniable.

I'll get one minor quibble about the film out of the way, and then get on with the more relevant good bits: There is a fast-forward passage of time between the three acts and, if you're not paying attention, you'll not notice. I think this has to do with the fact that the actresses are young, so makeup was important to make it clear to the audience that years have passed since the previous scene. In the case of La, it was not too difficult because she at least changed her hair. Adle, who is consistently the film's focus, remained ageless. I think they could have done more to change her look so that it was easier for her to pull off aging as the film's plot progressed. What clued me in was when a scene changed, for example, she's suddenly in a new job. It took a few moments to realize ""Oh. I guess this is sometime after high school.""

The two central characters are Adle, a high school student, and Emma, a senior at an art college. You'll learn, as the story progresses, that one of them is passionate in her romances and later chooses a stable, conservative career. The other character pursues her professional passions, while maintaining loyalty in her romantic relationship. Ultimately, this dichotomy in their personalities is what drives the plot and the film's tension. To what end, you'll have to find out for yourself.

The performances are powerful, bringing to mind memories of youth's romances and heartaches -- the kinds of memories that still embarrass you, yet still manage to leave behind a dull sadness whenever you re-visit them. I'm tempted to go on further about the film's ending and my interpretation of how it affected each character, but that would ruin the experience for anyone who wants to discover how wonderful this film is.",1409702400,4,1952,4.685131195335277
6050820,3,B00G3BVTKA,"This is a film about a teenage lesbian "" coming out of the closet."" Adele hangs out with her girlfriends, who often talk about sex. Feeling left out she goes out with a boy and has sex, decides it's not for her and dumps him, breaking his heart. She encounters an older girl,Emma, who dyes her hair blue and immediately hit it off. The prolonged lesbian sex scenes are steaming hot. Their relationship comes closer. At some point she is somehow out of her home, we don't see or hear about her parents. They just drop out of sight. Just like her friends. Just like her school. Then she's teaching children. She moves in with Emma. She gets jealous of Emma and a friend Lise (who may be or may not be screwing behind her back) and decides to start screwing a male colleague behind Emma's back. Predictably, Emma finds out and kicks her out. At a later point, they meet again and Adele tries to reconnect, but is unsuccessful (which went contrary to what one would expect from the usual movie plots). Adele ends up alone.

The two actresses are perfect for the roles, one appearing constantly naive and inexperienced, the other one worldly. If they did not personally enjoy the sex scenes they surely gave a good impression.

Incidentally, the movie takes place in France. I was particularly amused at everyone's posing, trying hard to appear to be a genius. How droll.

The movie could have greatly benefitted from drastic editing. It was too long. A ridiculous amount of time was wasted in seeing Adele teach (on and off about 45 minutes).",1409616000,2,1538,4.605839416058394

Emma, on the other hand, is in her fourth year of studying fine arts at the university.

6050833,2,B00G3BVTKA,"Ok first of all I don't know why they bother to call this a Criterion Collection because there are literally NO special features whatsoever. Secondly this cheap-o flick is WAY too long, drawn-out and boring as heck! Third the ""build-up"" to the eventual sex scene is at first taking too long then once the moment arrives it is rushed, no passion or romance what-so-ever! Awful cinematography and camera angles and so very dry, emotionless and in all actuality a turn-off! I have seen x-rated porn with more passion and realism than this flick, taste-less and dull, certainly not what I expected from a so-called ""real film-maker"". Why on Earth does this movie get so much un-warranted attention and un-necessary acclaim?! What is it that fans of this garbage get out of it?! If you like me were thinking of wasting your money on this non-sense I highly recommend reconsidering your options, it is not the ""passionate love story"" everyone is claiming it to be. Might I reiterate that the sex scenes are grotesque and actually quite awful to view, honestly I do not see for the life of me who could possibly get turned or emotionally satisfied by this filth! Take it from someone who is a film-maker, the honesty in a film comes from the on-screen chemistry between the actors and the Director's ability to make the script come alive in a believable and true way that ends up passing on to the audience in order to convey a sense of reality in an otherwise false pretense. This ""film"" (and I use the term lightly) succeeds at none of this and ends up leaving its intended audience listless and lifeless as if 3 God-forsaken hours were simply wasted with no payoff for the time (and money!) invested in pretending to care about the characters situation. I've read the graphic novel on which the flick is based and it is FAR superior in capturing the unique situation of the characters and actual passion that drove them and the emotions that were built. Expecting too much from this movie was my biggest mistake, I hope you don't make the same mistake and reconsider your time and money to be invested elsewhere other than this epic failure of a movie. And if you're wondering why if I hated it so much I am giving it 2 stars instead of one its because the women were very well built and pleasant to look at, but come on you can find pretty women anywhere, what I was looking for was romance, passion and maybe even a little love which this failed to deliver at all.

Now on to the film. It is a very good film and it is about the coming of age of a girl called Adle. We witness her life as she graduates from high school into adulthood.

The controversial intimate scenes are indeed very explicit. And the rest of the film was so good in getting feelings out of me that I wondered whether these were necessary to be as long as they are. But it is the director's choice and I respect that. As a viewer I don't think they served the film better in any way.

This one is recommended if you like those coming of age, slice of life films, it is very good. But beware that the intimate scenes are long and very explicit (but there are only a few, the rest is great cinema).",1407628800,2,807,4.127388535031847

The story encompasses about four years in the life of ADELE, from high school to college and work. ""Coming of age"" is the usual term. ADELE slowly dips her cute little toe into the warm waters of Lesbianism//Bi-Sexuality in a sweetly portrayed way, developing an attraction or crush on alluring LEA SEYDOUX  who's about five years older and twenty years more mature. ADELE's curious and as passionate as only a teenager can be. LEA is a beautiful lesbian who displays a complex mix of aloofness and maturity, passion and sensitivity, assertiveness and vulnerability. She's puzzled by this young girl who's following her around like a puppy. LEA slowly lowers her guard and ADELE storms the castle. Nice, but a relationship with a teenage girl is like handling NITRO.

6050853,4,B00G3BVTKA,"I like this for the SUPERB acting and sense of absolute reality in the emotions of the characters. It has achieved a real-life level that pulls you right in. I could not look at most of the sex scenes, because I don't watch pornography as entertainment. These scenes would be on the level of soft-core or a bit higher level porn without the campiness of a porn film, so from what I could look at, lol, it looked 'real' with real feelings. That's the upside if it doesn't make you feel uncomfortable. ~~~POSSIBLE spoiler: I feel there is an observation that I haven't seen yet, this young girl was exploited as a 'muse' by a somewhat experienced, somewhat predatory and narcissistic older Lesbian. She had no experience full-on with the same sex and it appeared to me she was another relationship on Emma's self-serving relationship conveyer belt, though Emma turned out to be profoundly moved by their intense shared passion. Watching Adele, the ingnue, breakdown (I will not give away why here) was so well done, I haven't seen emotion presented that way before.~~~ I found myself crying, and I am not into same-sex movies or related feelings. So this bridged the principle to all people of first love and its potential devastation (Brokeback Mountain did the same in principle with a different plot). I don't give it five stars because the sex scenes were too gratuitous, it could have been filmed a little more subtly. That was a bit of a shock-value thing the producer/director did for kicks, I believe.

6050855,4,B00G3BVTKA,"The breakout 2013 film Blue is the Warmest Color has been lauded as one of the most passionate, devastating love stories in recent memory. While this epic didn't blow me away as Weekend did, it certainly was a fascinating, intelligent work that justifies its 3-hour length on an intellectual level, even if not an emotional one. This ambitious work is some parts love story, some parts change-over-time, and mostly a coming-of-age tale of a young woman in modern-day France.

This bulky work is best looked at through its two distinct halves: the first of main character Adele as a high school youth, and the second of Adele as a young woman, having become a teacher and coming into her own. There is a fascinating parallel between the two - Adele seen as a student, learning from others, and then as a teacher herself, passing along wisdom rather than receiving it from mentor figures.

From the very beginning, we get a strong sense of intimacy by the sheer closeness of each shot; each character is right against the camera, making us feel like we are right next to them, nearly feeling their breath. Each character is also shot in isolation, giving one moment (nearly 45 minutes into the film) of two characters in the same shot that much greater of impact.

The love story is a sweet and believable one, as we are drawn to the allure, charm, and intelligence of the artistic Emma just as Adele is. Even their first real meeting, after-hours at a lesbian bar, ties back to Adeles school lessons of philosophy; earlier in the film, her teacher mentions the struggle between chance and fate/predestination. When Emma asks what brought Adele to the bar, however, Adele brushes it off as by chance, though neither Emma nor we believe that for a moment.

The romance that ensues, much like the also-excellent Her, is an insightful, poignant tale of love, jealousy, and obsession. With the lengthy running time a film like this has, we clock in enough time in the relationship to feel the trauma and rough waters that Emma and Adele face.

The brilliant subtext of art and philosophy provides a very satisfying finale to the film. Emmas gallery of artwork is full of models (all loved ones) in her life, and, even years later, Adele is still part of it. In a similar vein to Her, which argues that our relationships build us into who we are, Blue is the Warmest Color addresses our projected identities and how we share these pieces of ourselves with the world, and embrace these reflections.

All in all, though, I see this movie less of a romance and more of a coming-of-age story. Any young adult goes through an incredibly impressionable period where a singular person, or way of life, can completely transform your way of life and your outlook, and this film puts all of these together into one personification, Emma.

Blue is the Warmest Color is a sometimes joyful, sometimes heartbreaking, exploration of identity and the sacrifices necessary to achieve that.",1405987200,7,2965,4.779296875

No depth to characters.  Suggestion of loneliness resulting in disloyalty.  Some love, where people don't see each other, other than when they do the wild act; even that feels pornographic not an expression of love.

She eventually discovers that she is a lesbian and meets Emma. The two fall madly in love and move in together. However the course of true love does not go well and the movie ends with a rather cliche shot of Adele walking away by herself into the distance.

The movie is rather infamous for the sex scenes but they are all softcore and about what you would see in the softcore late night movies shown by the premium movie channels on TV. The scenes in this movie are well shot and are actually erotic. The movie is an emotionally draining one of love found and lost and the regrets that came with the lost. It is superbly acted. However at nearly 3 hours, it is also way too long. Much of the movie consists of too many lingering shots of people staring at each other, eating, talking inanely about every day events, etc. Some of the shots are clearly needed to establish mood and story but too many are too long or totally unnecessary. This movie is best seen on video where you can control the flow of the movie and take as many breaks from it as you need.",1403049600,,1221,4.331877729257642
6050881,5,B00G3BVTKA,"This movie was a bit in your face as far as the extended sex scenes go, but I think it was necessary to explain the reality of the relationship between the two main characters which was more physical passion than anything else. I really liked the progression of the main character's ""coming out."" It was very believable and pretty realistic. I also really can't believe how well her heartbreak was captured.

I watched it on Netflix over the course of two nights (it's a very long movie,) and then purchased the film on Amazon so I could own it and watch it again at my leasure.  There is something incredibly alluring about the main actress of this film and she does an excelllent job of making you believe EVERYTHING.  Bravo - well done... and talk about passionate.

6050888,4,B00G3BVTKA,"Based on simply watching this 3-hour-long epic modern romance, you realize what a wonderois accomplishment of realism it is, and how unconcerned with sexuality it is, despite being a highly erotic and emotional roller-coaster. The film traverses around 10 years of time in the life of Adele, from ravenous teenaged high-schooler to wistful young adult schoolteacher, bookending the torrid romance she has with an older lesbian art student.  Theirs is a tender romance turned volatile over time as both come into their own, driven by a lust for knowledge and experiences, both individually and together.

It is here where the controversies about the film's director and actresses begin to color how one looks at this film.  The male director clashed with his stunningly beautiful and totally committed actresses over graphic depictions of sexuality, which women have decried as unrealistic and male-oriented fantasy.  The power of two extended semi-pornographic sex scenes cannot be ignored, and yet with the criticism, become hard to view objectively or properly.  Wherever you fall in how to view these scenes, the work of the two actresses and the director elsewhere create a masterwork of human emotion, in which the two leads happen to be women.  Those who refuse to look past the gender of the two romantic leads need a few more LGBT people in their life, because it's a can't miss film.",1402012800,3,1392,5.110132158590308

I'm giving this film 3 stars, but I'm probably being a bit generous.

There were many scenes that added nothing to the story and should have wound up on the cutting room floor. The most glaring example was a birthday party, the fact that Adele was turning 18 was a relevant story point, but that was established in the first 30 seconds of the scene and was the only dialog in the scene, it then continued showing 3-4 mins of people dancing, it was not interesting, it was not engaging, and it added nothing to the movie.

The sex scenes for which this movie is known were probably the best on screen sex scenes I have ever seen. You could feel their passion for each other, the longing, and how deeply they were connected. While these scenes also went a little long in spots, it was still very well done.

6050901,3,B00G3BVTKA,"What may be suitable in pornography qua pornography is questionable and amounts to exploitation in mainstream films.  How tired I am of hearing actresses say, with a straight face and a touch of professional (if misplaced) pride that they will only submit to nudity ""if the script demands it"".  The point too easily missed is that if the script demands nudity there is a fault in the script.  We do not need to see Romeo and Juliet have sex to know they have been intimate - the language makes it apparent.  I have yet to see a non-ponographic film in which nudity was called for.  Are we so bereft of imagination that we require seeing sex rather than conjuring it up ourselves or having the writer conjure it up in imagery, gestures, etc.?  I do not care what others say - this film stands or falls on the sex scenes - without them the film is pedestrian.  Nothing new is said.  Nothing that has been expressed before is here expressed better.  If I want to see two women flailing about in bed I know where to find it without the self-righteous blather about it having an integral part to play in the character's development.  This has nothing to do with Puritanism.  It has to do with calling ""sex as window dressing"" what it is.  Just once I would love to hear a director, producer, or actress come out and say what is patently obvious - ""I took my clothes off to sell tickets"" or ""I allowed my breasts to be exposed and fondled because my career needed a boost"" or even ""I can't act to save my life and subtlety is beyond me - so voila - I strip"" or, perhaps more cynically, ""The director told me I couldn't get the gig if I didn't spend half the picture in the buff"".  Perhaps Hollywood wants to tap into that billion dollar porn market the only way it can.  Fine.  Take the clothes off.  Parade in your birthday suits.

this was a truly great, daring movie by two young talented actresses.  They nailed their roles perfectly.  It was real, gritty,

Even the scenes that had no dialogue spoke to you, leaving you to draw your own conclusions, which i love in a good movie.  To top it off, it was subtitled, and i sat through the movie fully absorbed.  It takes alot for a foreign film to get me to do that.  To top that off, the content this movie has ""walks a fine line"" between great drama, or a porn production.

I think some things just vanished from the film like Adele's family and friends.  What happened to them?  Did her family disown her when they found out about her sex life? What became of her gay male friend and her girlfriend who kissed her at school?  I think she could have leaned on them during her time of sorrow.

I've watched LGBT film evolve over the past three decades: from Personal Best, Waiting for the Moon, Lianna, Desert Hearts, it's truly gratifying how far we have some in a very short period of time.

Blue Is the Warmest Color was missing all of the tenderness and intimacy I associate with lesbian love-making. The sex scenes felt mechanical, almost technical. (As if there were a list of sexual acts they wanted to cover, while someone stood in the corner and checked tic-boxes). I don't object to sex in film done tastefully.

I found myself questioning if the scenes would have been different if directed by a lesbian, or a woman, at least. Since seeing the movie, I've read the actresses felt exploited. I guess I'm not at all surprised.

 did feel the character development was very thin.  I'm a big fan of ""foreign"" film, but I don't have exposure to much French film. Perhaps my discomfort is cultural, or even stylistic. About 2/3 the way through. I found myself checking to see how much time was remaining. That's very unusual; I don't find many films boring.

I wish I'd learned more about the characters as women. I just didn't really care about Adele or Emma. I found myself really straining to understand them both, but, alas, I just didn't feel I knew enough about either of them as people to care about what happened to them.

Its a brilliantly crafted, brilliantly executed first love story that hits all the notes and hits them well.  Of course it doesn't end happily.  Duh!  How many people marry their high school sweethearts?  So there's pain, which is also part of first love.  The sex scenes are well done but frankly, they could've cut them to five seconds and the movie would have been just as good.  They aren't gratuitous but I dislike the fact that American feminists were so a-twitter with the idea that this movie was nothing more than a straight man's titillation.  Who hijacked my feminism, right?  No disagreement or different perspectives allowed...anyhow, a really, really great story.  It deals in reality, not San Francisco sex-positive PC nonsense.  But then American moviemakers have always had to bend to the fantasy that various special interest groups live in.

As for the dialogs, there is not a word said by anyone that is not relevant.

I read in an article a while ago that the difference between movies and books is that in movies we cannot know what the character is thinking. While I generally agree with this statement, we have an honorable exception here.

It deals with the period in life when we are too young to appreciate our youth and the unique period which that will soon be gone forever. Care free and full of painful concerns simultaneously. All relationships come with it the inevitable pain of lessening passion and the potential of estrangement  and/or abandonment.

The director and the actors... the film score and the cinema photography... the colors... They all make for an artful and compelling film. It is three hours in length and yet the viewer becomes so enthralled with the characters -- it will seem more like an hour. Don't see it because it contains explicit sexual content; for it is so delicate in displaying young erotic and love relationships. And, if you are older, it will remind you that. indeed youth has to be wasted on persons who are far too immature to appreciate it. Well, until later . . .

6050950,4,B00G3BVTKA,"Romance movies, be they comedy or drama (or those awful Judd Apatow fusions), rarely show the full spectrum of tenderness and horror that love can do to a person (and when they do it's usually sugar-coated and 'Hollywood', such as most things adapted from the book by Nicholas Sparks). With love comes happiness and security but when it is suddenly taken away from you there is only hollowness and despair.

Adele is a high school senior pressured into having sex with boys to appease her nasty ""friends"". She enjoys it, but still feels that it is wrong. A split-second encounter in the street with blue-haired artist Emma leads to love at first sight and Adele can't get her out of her mind, fantasizing about her in bed at night. Lesbian urges grow inside her and she finally builds the courage to find Emma and falls head-over-heels in love with her.

Adele's sexuality (and, by extension, Emma's too) causes problems with her school friends, her family (a scene in which she was disowned was unwisely cut from the final movie), and Emma's own circle. Her jealousy eventually leads to critical trust issues. It's a sin that everybody is guilty of at some point.

Abdellatif Kechiche fills the movie with very long, following takes which highlight the mundane existence of Adele as she longs for love. The sex scenes are passionate and believable, punctuated with moans and gasps rather than music and are shot in realistic light which is not too unflattering. None of the actresses wear make-up, allowing their full range of facial expressions to show their true emotions, including messy, greasy hair. The sex scenes are nothing to get offended about, they are tasteful and honest and only a prude would object. Anyone taking the film seriously will find it hard to not be emotionally affected by them. But they are not pornographic.

However I did find the ""food mouth"" close-up shots at the beginning to be a major turn-off.

Blue is the Warmest Color is most certainly a film that will linger in your mind for a long time and will resonate, or maybe open old wounds, of people who have loved and lost. It's a very hard watch and not really a movie you can enjoy, but I'd sooner have this over anything starring Jennifer Aniston or Goldie Hawn's daughter.

The Blu-ray sports a 2.35:1 picture that is good for the most part with lovely warm colors (HA!) but suffers from looking quite ""digital"" during the darker nighttime scenes. I will assume that this is a problem with the fake widescreen photography and loss of resolution with the cropping (the movie was shot with a Canon C300 which has a native ratio of 1.78:1 and then simply cropped to 2.35:1 in post-production, which is a lazy way of achieving the aspect ratio).

The female love interest, Emma, turns out to be very mercurial in her dealings with love. In my mind, she leaves her 1st love in search of excitement and finds it with Adele.

Some of the time shifts are very abrupt which doesn't allow for much back story on supporting characters (the parents, for example).

6050970,5,B00G3BVTKA,"Blue is the Warmest Color is really two filmsas the original French title makes clear (The Life of Adle, Parts I and II).  The first is a very sweet lesbian coming-out story and romance, which ends, as so many such films do, with the lives of the couple as blissfully intertwined as their bodies are in several long, but beautifully filmed segments.  Adle's painfully adolescent insecurity is wonderfully acted by newcomer Adle Exarchopoulos.  Her seducer (not that it takes her much effort) is perhaps a trifle too self-confidentand yet not ironic enoughas a 20-something art student in becoming so deeply involved with a frightened 16-year old, but La Seydoux is convincing throughout, and her wry smile is both seductive and perhaps a foreshadowing of Part II.  The much-touted sex scenes may seem a bit gratuitous in their length and detail (not that I found them so!) but make more sense in the context of the second part of the film.  Because after four years, the physical attraction, though still supposedly strong, is no longer enough for Emma, the artist, who also craves critical understanding of her work, and not merely loving appreciation.

Emma also is used to intellectual companionship, and receives precious little from Adle, who actually appears to regress from her literary interests in Part I, and who has apparently absorbed nothing of either Emma's rationalization of her own art, nor her interest in and admiration for other artists.  In fact, despite being very clearly Emma's muse, Adle seems remarkably uninterested in what Emma is trying to create from her images of her lover.  Instead, she has become the perfect housewife for Emma, and in fact is used as such by herboth spending a whole day cooking for a reception in Emma's honor, and washing the dishes by herself afterward, while Emma lies in bed, reading an art magazine.  In short, their relationship has become banalized.  One of the two defects, though minor, which I found in this extended narrative of the life and death of a passionate relationship, was that Adle appears to have made no attempt to absorb even the superficial trappings and interests of the companion (and muse) of an artist.  She does not even pretend to take an interest in the artists' conversations, is unfamiliar with some of the most famous names (which have clearly been at least a modest influence on Emma) and appears instead completely wrapped up in her career as a teacher in kindergarten.  This is my second objection:  she is very fond of small children, who are shown to be extraordinarily adorable in the scenes in her schoolroom, but shows no interest either in having one to share with Emma, nor does she recognize Emma's obvious desire for a family.  One could say she is merely dense, and just a body to her lover, but we learn at the very beginning that she is a gifted linguist, writes very well (if only for her own benefit), and Emma implores her to write something for publication; it is painfully clear that Emma wishes to have a lover who is more ambitious, and could be seen as worthy of her.

It's the beginning of the end, which is shown with painful realism.  Emma becomes more remote, and spends more and more time with a fellow artist, who not incidentally happens to be pregnant.  In response, Adle begins to go out a bit with other teachers and to haunt some bars alone.  (Another problematic aspect of her personality is that she makes no effort to become involved with women, despite the fact that her only relationship with a man was extremely unsatisfactory for her, that she has shown no physical desire for men, and has been absorbed in a lesbian relationship for four or more years by this point.)  Emma uses her supposed infidelityagain, it is painful to watch because it is so realas an excuse to pick a violent fight with Adle, and throw her out in the street, despite her tearful attempts to make up, when she has nowhere to go, in the middle of the night.  It is needlessly cruel, and Emma seems to be using the incident as a pretext, her own anger rendered more extreme by her probable need to cover up her own unfaithfulness and complicity in the decline of their relationship.  (One explanation for her violent reaction could be that Adle has been consorting with men, a betrayal of their lesbianism.  Cruelly, when they meet again some years later, Emma asks Adle first if she has a boyfriend, and only then, a girlfriend.)

Remarkablyin human termsbut totally believable in the context of the filmAdle makes no effort to fill the hole left in her life by the loss of Emma.  She cries a lot, but neither makes an effort to win Emma back nor does she search for a substitute.  With the exception of one encounter, apparently after a long time, when she arranges for a meeting with Emma, and then makes a frontal assault to try to sleep with her, she simply wanders.  It is a tribute to her acting, and Kechiche's direction, that this overly-long period of unalloyed mourning does not fail to convince.  At the end, she is invited to a major opening for a show of Emma's work.  She is still treated indifferently by Emma, whose love for her subsequent companion is displayed extravagantly, probably for Adle's benefit, and she finally feels ignored enough to leave.  She is seen walking slowly away, and in a cinematic tease typical of French ""realism,"" which reverses Hollywood clichs, is followed, only belatedly, and in the wrong direction, by a handsome young man she has known from some years before, who has shown an interest in her.

Most critics have written of her 'growth,' but frankly, I'm not sure if she has grown, or merely finally been forced to passive acceptance of the fact that the great love of her life is over.  The ending is extremely painful to watch, and as with so many failed relationships, there is really no catharsis.  One of the parties is happy, or at least content, and the other is alone, abandoned.  It was real, and it hurt.",1395360000,17,5967,4.7232401157184185
6050971,5,B00G3BVTKA,"I happen to be a hetero guy who adores women, but no matter your sex, gender ID, orientation, whatever, this is a touching drama.  I initially did not find either of the two actresses physically attractive.  Someone in another review here mentioned that Adele breathed through her mouth, and chewed with her mouth open, and that that was a real turnoff.  I might add that she also let snot run out of her nose, down onto her lip.  I had the opposite reaction.  This character seemed to have no body shame whatsoever, and an oral fixation to rival my own.  The kissing was A++, and while I'd have enjoyed the movie more if there'd also been more tender kisses and sexual doings, that wasn't what they had.  Without that, their 2-1/2 year relationship wasn't likely to be permanent.

While I think that the Emma actress did a spectacular job, I don't feel that her character was supposed to be liked in the end.  She had hurt and rejected the woman whom it was impossible for most of us not to love.  She didn't respect Adele's life goals, and how can you think well of a person who disrespects a teacher of young children who also gets fulfillment out of lovingly preparing you meals, and who wishes that you'd spend more hours at home in bed with her?  By the time that Adele *sexually* cheated, It is implied that Emma had been emotionally cheating with Lise for two years.  And hey, if I were a lesbian who was romantically involved with a bi-woman, I somehow think that I'd be far more threatened by her being sexually involved with another woman, than a few dalliances with a guy..

Again, Emma was an unsympathetic character, and it's all about how the viewer felt about Adele.  Emma does, because she's a very honest person, have to admit that she doesn't have great sex anymore, and I think that the viewer can infer that she really never expects the thrills she felt with Adele.  Jeez, she isn't even thirty.  Some artist.  She paints lesbian themed art--and not merely art that suggests lesbian culture, but art featuring female bodies that seem at least somewhat erotic--yet drives away the most sensuous woman she could ever hope to meet, and calls her a ""whore"" because she's bisexual.  Adele only sought out affection from another *person* because she had been neglected.  Emma rejects expansive love, and uses the word, ""dyke,' while she is being the paradigm of that derisive term.

As the credits rolled, I was left with the impression that Emma would never again know the joy she'd had with Adele, while Adele would eventually move past her longings for Emma, and find love with either a woman or man who was worthy of what she had to offer.  Emma's art is mediocre, but Adele's love is priceless, and her tears, precious.  Any proper lover would seek to make the more precious be making them rare, and given only to her or him who is worthy.

Ladies, this is a great date movie.  If a guy gets all turned on by the sex, and then cries (or almost cries) during the breakup scene, you might have a keeper.",1395360000,14,3021,4.551851851851852

But what really got me was the acting of these two leading ladies - unbelievable.  If movies are about the visual then the lead characters displayed just that in a very moving way.  You can feel the pain of loss in Adele Exarchopoulo;s character (Adele) in scenes that have little or no dialog.  Lea Seydoux's character (Emma) is equally dynamic.  The growth and change of these two in the movie is seamless while you begin to understand why their love affair doesn't work out.  Even though their sex life is passionate and fulfilling, like many relationships, it isn't all you need to be successful.

This movie is a head banger days after you watch it.  It may be a simple love story but it delivers the goods that bursts one's emotions about the complexities of relationships.

The sex scenes are basically what in America we call soft core porn.  That said I didn't mind them even though they were a little longer than they needed to be.  They did add greatly to the movie.  The French are more opened minded when it comes to sex.  Americans have all sorts of insane violence in movies but throw in an intense sex scene and we get upset.  It's silly really. Don't let the headlines about the sex scenes scare you away.",1395100800,13,916,4.135593220338983

  That pretty much covers everything a guy would want in a deep, moving, meaningful film about a young woman coming to terms with adulthood and trying to figure out who she is and what she wants to do with her life. The problem is... the sex was so ridiculously overdone as to render it comical. Sure, I wanted to believe that these women just couldn't keep themselves from humping each other's legs and arms and faces and butts in a parade of endless orgamsic bliss...but all I saw was two women who would've rather been anywhere else doing anything other than the very fake acts in which they were engaged.

6050982,3,B00G3BVTKA,"I give this movie an extra star because the sex scenes were wonderfully done. Otherwise, it's a 2 star for me, and given the other, passionate reviews, I must be missing something. It's a long movie, or I would probably watch again for the deep story line that flew right past me.

The character Adele, is a mouth breather, quite literally. She always has her mouth open  - not only that, but there are too many scenes where she's eating/chewing with her mouth open. Because this is so obvious from the beginning, I think is why I checked out.

Why? I wanted to see what a lot of other reviewers saw. As a lesbian myself, I was not watching only for the storied sex scenes (you'll have to trust me on that one); I wanted to see this heartbreaking love story, but for me, I didn't see it. In my opinion, they spent too much time on plot (what there is of it) and not enough time on character development for both characters. I had to read somewhere else that there was a significant class/culture barrier between the 2 characters that was supposed to be glaring. Regardless, the relationship between the two women seems strictly predicated on attraction and sex (and I know that's not uncommon). I saw very little these two women had in common, and given Adele seemed to still have some attraction to men and given Emma had cheated on her own girlfriend to bed a teenager, it was only a matter of time before one of them cheated on the other. I don't criticize the movie for not having a happy ending, but I do criticize for not showing Adele's conflict or for exploring her budding sexuality. For instance, not going more in depth with why the relationship with her boyfriend at the beginning was not working for her, would have been time better spent than the long scenes for Emma's party. They could have cut that portion in 1/2 and still gotten the same feeling through to the viewer. That Adele cheated on Emma simply because she felt lonely doesn't wash with me. I wanted more than that, and maybe, had I invested another 30 minutes to see it through to the end, I would have?",1395014400,12,2081,4.456692913385827

It turned out to be one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  I am a straight female but did not feel that the sex scenes were too much, in the sense that it felt real.  The entire movie felt real and emotionally raw.  It portrayed real emotion and attraction...no matter what sex.  Trust me, women can have relations like that...when there is passion.  There is no stereotypical lesbian sex.

Obviously the sexual part of the film has to be mentioned because it was quite different and more intense than what we see in the states.  But, as I said it was real to me and a necessary part of the film.  Aside from that aspect, I felt the character developments and portrayals were interesting and new (from the stuff that is usually put out over here).  I see myself in Adele in many ways (personality).  Watching this was like reading a book, I was able to be transformed to that time again... being a young girl, trying to figure yourself out, new relationships, life, transition.  That may be why I relate to this movie and appreciate it so much.  I know many people have negatively reviewed this as being flat, undeveloped, more porn that substance.  But, I have to strongly disagree.

I recommend this to you if you have an open mind and can understand love, growing up, relationships, life.  It is a beautiful, open, and artistically brilliant movie.  It's unfortunate the media and others created a visual of perverseness and pornography around this movie.  Try to forget what you have heard and allow yourself into the movie.  It will be worth your time!  For once I will have to do this backwards.  Now I'm going to go read the book!

This film is nothing but horrendously stilted dialogue - what little there is of it - sandwiched in between gratuitous and overly long sex scenes.

This film has absolutely no character development, a very sparse screenplay, and subpar acting. Because it seems to play into every males voyeuristic fantasies about lesbian sex, it generated quite a buzz in the film world.

A decade later when I was old enough to see it for myself I seriously thought, Ho hum, I've had more exciting [and interesting] escalator rides. It didn't hold up very well, and I think Blue will find itself in a similar category as same sex relationships become more and more mainstream.
 Concerning the male gaze [oh those postmodernist feminists! ] during the sex scenes: the director is male, obviously, and his gaze is prevalent throughout as he focuses an inordinate amount of time on his heroineas she sleeps [ mouth open], cries [ mouth open with snot], eats [ mouth open] , talks with food in [ open] mouth, thinks[ mouth open], plays endlessly with hair [ mouth open]. However  his favorite shot is not of the open mouth, but of her derriereas she showers [ truly gratuitous], has sex, sleeps on stomach, checks herself out and finally in the multiple walking away shots. Clearly, it is his most beloved view. So that by the time we get to the sex, it is merely an extension of her other bodily functions and about as titillating.
 Only an actress as adorable as Adele E. could pull this off, and she really is great in her role: sweet, vulnerable, giving, loving, tormented, shamed, angry, confused and finally, at least in her work as a teacher, confident and fulfilled. Each time I'd  had about enough of  the movie, she would do something so touching that I couldn't help but like her and the film all over again.
 I cannot say the same for Lea Seydoux, who looks like the love child of Kate Moss and a blue lizard [ with her totally dead eyes that convey nothing] in a universe where meals are actually eaten. Her one expression is a sardonic smile, which she puts on whenever she sneers at the innocence of the infinitely more practical working class Adele while she, herself,  and her artsy friends drone on about the subject in the most banal terms ever put on film [ and judging from the results she couldn't sketch her way out of a paper bag]. But perhaps it was the directors intention to expose the pretentiousness of that crowd [?].
 As for the tenderness of first love, my understanding is that the author of the the graphic novel, Julie Maroh, had Adele kill herself at the end. Let me just say to young people who may be reading this: any lover, male or female, who is that disrespectful of one's chosen career and who allows the other to cook for his/her friends and then sits around afterward not helping while the other washes all the dishes by hand isn't worth the time of day, no matter how good the sex.

6050995,5,B00G3BVTKA,"The graphic novel by Julie Maroh is excellent on its own terms. Be prepared, the movie veers from the book. This typically happens from book to film, ""Brokeback Mountain"" being an exception.
Now, this film, which I was deeply moved by:
Emma dumped her girlfriend of two years for Adle. It came as no surprise that she turned around and dumped Adle for Lise. Emma is a prima facie case for unfaithfulness. Unfortunately, Adle was too inexperienced and too fragile for Emma's world.
ALL or NOTHING was Adle as Ennis Del Mar was all or nothing for Jack F*ing Twist. It is very difficult for this kind of person to recover from lost love. It takes a lot of internal work, getting back on the horse, or maybe never trusting love again.
The Arab man who loved Adle, `got' her, and in my opinion was more emotionally sensitive to her than Emma ever was; he would have been the more loving partner. But then, all or nothing. Adle's heart and sexual soul was lesbian. Her body resonated to lesbian first, and when she ""settled' on bisexuality her heart and body was not into it.
This insightful man also provided a practical strategy for her healing when he suggested she visit New York City, adding later, ""Travel opens your mind."" This is one of those breadcrumbs that the Universe throws out. Let's just say she takes him up and gets out of her unhappy environment with all its sad reminders. She goes to NYC; maybe she meets a new love, maybe it's just what the doctor ordered. She gains the bird's eye perspective. Good to follow breadcrumbs!
I have searched filmdom for what appeals to me as the best lesbian sex. `Blue' is by far my favorite portrayal, with Chlo Sevigny and Michelle Williams coming in a close second in ""If These Walls Could Talk 2"".
In chapter 11's sex marathon Emma and Adle cover the techniques except for use of sex toys, and making heightened arousal talk, (scissoring appearing in another part of the film). Also, I was pleased these girls didn't giggle during heat.
Moreover, unlike lesbian porn, the fingernails were actually trimmed to avoid cutting the delicate tissue. And, unlike porn, the orgasm took its time instead of happening in the first five minutes. This alone veers from the male/porn model of female orgasm. Thank you, Betty Dodson and Carlin Ross, for sex education.

6050997,5,B00G3BVTKA,"Hey there,

As another poster pointed out, some comments should have included a spoiler tag, out of courtesy. Here's mine in order to respond freely to a lot of statements made in regards to this movie:

**SPOILER ALERT***

Now my dear reader, there are a few points that I would like for you to consider.

- Some people talk about how it is uber boring for them to watch Adele be filled with grief over the loss of Emma. They are forgetting that this is relevant, because the second chapter of Adele's life revolves around her life without the Blue - without Emma (That's why the literal translation to the original movie title is, ""the life of Adele: Chapters 1 and 2""). And also, this is artistic cinema. If you wanted an action packed blockbuster then perhaps you should have reconsidered watching this one. Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean it is not a masterpiece. The portrayal of emotions is masterful, you even feel the void Adele is experiencing in her life by just looking at her, and that is exactly the kind of feeling the movie wants to provoke, in order for us to understand the main character's feelings. It was a pleasure to watch.

- There is also a mention of an anti-gay sentiment, and I couldn't disagree more with that. The explicit sex scenes are meant to be there BECAUSE it shows the incredible sex our lead characters (used to) have, how passionate their relationship was, and how deeply they were physically into each other. All those asinine arguments about how ""lesbians don't have sex that way"" are nothing but ridiculous - who is to say how someone else is to have sex? Last I checked it is something personal. It is like a straight couple complaining about a movie in which the leads have sex on the kitchen counter (and we have seen that numerous times) and how that doesn't realistically depict their sex lives. Really?

- The film shows that true love CAN and DOES exist between two women. Doesn't mean that it was meant to last forever. Now, it is implied that Adele eventually does come out to society, which is why they end up living together (makes me wonder if that is also why Adele feels so alone as her old friends might have alienated her over her coming out?). Yes, she ends up having flings here and there, but that is only AFTER she and Emma have broken up and you see, even she can't find love elsewhere, which suggests that what they have was the real deal for both of them -during a given period of time- and how they both eventually outgrew it. She doesn't find love with another man, nor with another woman, and in the end scene we see Adele walking out a different direction than the man who chases after her - so it is suggested they won't ever meet up. Either that, or she simply wasn't interested in him anyway. She walked out on her own accord because she couldn't bear being there in the art exhibit one second longer. That's when it truly dawned on her that Emma had already moved on and she still hadn't. So she walks out for her own sake, clearly depicting the first step on her moving on process. And who knows? She might find true love with another girl once she lets go of Emma's memory.

- Both actresses LOVED the end result, and you can see in numerous interviews how the lead actresses comment over and over again that the media blew their comments way out of proportion.

***END OF SPOILER ALERT***

Either way, in order to remain on topic, I would suggest people to watch it, if they are into intense love films - this film doesn't disappoint, at all. And I would also suggest to bear in mind that this is artistic cinema, not a blockbuster, so don't expect fast unrealistic scenes. This movie delivers the joy and pain that comes from love, and does it in such a way that the viewer is compelled to mirror the lead character's feelings as their own. 10/10",1394582400,7,3837,4.462196861626248

What captivated me for nearly three hours was the amazing performance by Adle Exarchopoulos - kudos to her. So captivating that I allowed the film to entrap me for three hours hoping that she would find a love and that suicide would not be her final escape.

6051009,5,B00G3BVTKA,"There are spoilers in this review so don't read on if that bothers you.  This is a pro-lesbian film. If that bothers you don't read on.  This is not pornography, I was told by somewhat reliable sources that the women wore things so you're not seeing real girl on girl sex, just acting faking.  So I am told.  There is, however, a lot of female nudity and love making sequences.  This film is sub-titled, if that bothers you don't read on and don't see the film.  One problem with sub-titles is that you are so busy reading them that you don't watch the actors and French directors make their actors work with their eyes and faces.  So, you have to see this film enough to see their faces.  I first saw Lea Seydoux as the 'assassin who goes flying out the window' in Ghost Protocol the Tom Cruise Mission Impossible film.  What can I say, I fell in lover with her at first sight. I looked her up and there was this film about to go into theaters.  So I waited and it became available as a pre-order and I ordered it.  It will it sit on my shelf next to The Lover.  There were two things that raised eyebrows in 2013, one was Fifty Shades of Grey and the other was Blue is the Warmest Color.  It's about a 15 year old French high school girl who is discovering her own sexuality.  Her friends want her to be hetro.  She, however, see's this older woman with blue hair crossing the street and the two of them meet with their eyes and it's love at first sight.  Adele, the girl, has an affair with a guy who is a senior at school(she's a junior) and they go to bed and have sex but you can see she's not all that into it.  She has dreams of the woman with blue hair making love to her as she mastrubates and dreams.  At school she meets a girl who is curious but not comitted and they share kisses.  Later Adele see's her and goes to kiss her but finds out it was just a passing fancy.  For our young girl it was not.  She, like other students, goes to a crowded political gathering in the town square with union people and students.  One of her friends, a guy who is gay, takes her to a gay bar but she leaves and walks back to her house and passes a lesbian bar that she goes into just to 'see' what goes on.  In there she is confronted by the older woman with blue hair.  They chat.  The share a drink.  They part and the woman in Blue moves on with her friends while Adele goes home.  The woman in blue meets Adele near his school and the two walk away while Adele's friends call after her.  The woman does her portrait and they chat.  The woman says she's into 18 year olds and older (Adele is 15).  They part.  Adele is confronted by her gal pals who now thing she's a lesbian.  A pussy eater. She is confronted and gets into a fight and is osterized.  Adele meets up again with the Woman with the Blue Hair and Adele seduces her.  One of the men Adele crossed paths with in the male Gay Bar said:  Love has no gender.  That is what this movie about.  It's about a 15 year old girl trying to find out what she likes with a 30 year old who can get 5-20 years in jail for kissing the backside of a 15 year old girl or just being with her totally naked.  She goes to dinner at Emma's house and they have oysters.  Adeles doesn't like oysters (remember Tony Curtis in Kubrick's Sparticus? Emma goes to dinner at Adele's house after she turns 18 and they think Emma has a boyfrieind (they don't yet know about Adele).  Orgasmic!  Adele becomes Emma's muse' and poses for her painting.  Even in the gay world Adele has a hard time being suzie home maker  even in the gay world while she does learn to make spagettie from her parents. Adele moves in with Emma, who is a struggling professional artist and Adele is her model.  Adele is more in love with Emma than Emma is with herself and her art.  Slowly they fall apart.  Emma stays out late at night doing 'work'.  Adele takes up with a man from the pre-school where she works.  As a result of this affair Emma throws her out. Much later they meet at a restaurant.  Adele is now the Alpha Dog.  But the love between Adele and Emma is not let to be anymore.  Later Emma invites Adele to her exhibit.  There she meets a man from her past and they talk then part.  She leaves. He goes after her but doesn't know which way she went.  She walks home alone.  He just walks.  The film is about:  Discovery. Confusion.  Mistrust. Betrayal.  Hate.  There are people in this world who say Jewish people can't marry Gentiles.  Whites can't marry blacks.  Red Heads can't marry Brunettes.  You have to decide if you side with Hitler and his Master Race concept of if you let people be what they are and love who they choose.  It's up to all of you to decide and remember that others decide about YOU as well!  This is a fantastic film.  Watch the eyes.  Watch the faces and ignore the skin and nipples. This film is about YOUR ultimate freedom and if you don't get it someone, someday might get you!  Sorry, but that's ultimate reality!  This film won the Palm D'Or. Cannes Film Festival's greatest award. The award the Taxi Driver, Appoclipse Now and many other great films won.  This film is a great novel.  It is worth reading.  It is not easy reading.  You have to go beyond the bare skin, nipples and moans and look into their eyes past the sub-titles.

6051011,2,B00G3BVTKA,"The Worst Part: The French have never heard of a Film Editor.  This 3 hour movie could have easily been cut down to 90 min. without losing one important scene or plot point.

The Cannes Film Festival Best Part:  The lesbian graphic sex scenes. But not simply because of the sex, but because mainstream actress Lea Seydoux was willing to ""play it for real"".  She erased any doubt in your mind that she was acting.  Now that's dedication.

The Bad Part:  She and Adele Exarchopoulos were sabotaged while doing the sex scenes.  We, the audience, are suppose to be watching very intimate moments between two females alone in their room -- then why does the camera jiggle?  Because there is a cinematographer in the room filming the scenes.  Set the camera on a tripod and get the hell out of the room!  Very annoying and distracting.

The Dull Part:  The plot.  Teen girl meets college girl.  They fall in lust.  Teen girl sexually betrays college girl.  Teen girl loses college girl.  The End.

The French love drama, drama, drama.  They hate ""Hollywood Endings"" -- read happy endings -- therefore, you watch their dramas and leave the theater depressed.  This movie would have been so much better and more enlightening if the girls had fallen in love and not simply lust, if they had bonded.  If Mr. Kechiche had given us a movie about two girls meeting, falling in love, and each becoming stronger -- becoming more than the sum of their parts -- who only had hearts for each other and whose lives became fulfilling because of this bond . . . I would have given it 5 stars.

There was no part of this film that was thrilling or enlightening.  Not even the sex.",1394236800,6,1658,4.5423728813559325
6051012,2,B00G3BVTKA,"This movie brought to mind one of those old Alka-Seltzer commercials in which a woozy-looking guy is sitting on the edge of his bed, about to hurl, and says of his predicament, ""I can't believe I ate the whole thing."" Clocking-in at three hours, I can't believe I watched this entire movie, in no small part to my own determination to finish something once I've crossed the half-way mark, aka the point of no return. This is to say I obviously hate myself because this movie is one of those supposedly high-minded art movies in which everything is supposed to a metaphor for something else; the color blue is a metaphor for the things about the world that confuse Adele, the gratuitous shots of Adele sleeping and dining with her family a metaphor for her existential angst, even the bloody spaghetti her parents make and she later prepares for Emma's friends is a metaphor! I don't usually mind symbolism, but I do mind being bludgeoned to death with it. But of course, that is not why any of us are watching this movie. Let's all stop pretending this is art and acknowledge that we're here for lesbian ""love"" scenes that are so graphic, you know that somewhere a 13 year old teenage boy was unable to call or text his friends and tell him what he's just discovered on [your choice of streaming video service]. Worse, the ""love"" scenes are the only time our protagonist, Adele, comes alive; she otherwise spends the entire movie being wishy-washy when she's not staring off into space with her vacant doe eyes which of course must also be a metaphor for something. Ultimately, the movie preys upon the viewer's own existential angst, leaving us with no resolution to the story and unable to reach through the screen to strangle the director for making this movie twice as long as it should have been. Whatever good will French movies may have garnered from ""Amelie"" over a decade ago has now been completely erased, leaving us at the point where everyone remembers why we hate the French - they make movies like this.",1394236800,6,2018,4.65546218487395
6051013,5,B00G3BVTKA,"Like a lot of people I first watched this for the sex scenes, but while they are excellent, not a distraction, and priceless aesthetically and in developing the story, the real value of this movie is the arc of its love story. Like most people I have been lost in that same arc in the real world and the acting and the writing here resonated so vividly that at times it almost had the directive feeling of a dream, where your memories are digested, reassembled and presented to you in a different symbolic form. Not many movies can do this, and I think one reason this movie had that kind of affect was because of the non-linear free format style of the presentation---something I see it has been criticized for. I love French movies and have watched a fair number of them, (this reminded me a bit of ""Waterlilly's"") so this pacing and direction didn't surprise me, in fact I wouldn't have it any other way as I think it is essential in creating such a deep emotional and empathetic reaction as it helps to suspend the disbelief. I didn't feel I was being ""fed"" a plot, I felt I was an observant actor, creating pieces of the story myself, as I viewed the events. The result was a very immersive, and personal experience. At times I felt like grabbing Emma and yelling at her to forget about her career anxiety for a second and pay attention to her lover; and I also felt like screaming at Adele to stand up for herself!--use your ammunition, point out that Emma was unfaithful first, and she was the one alienating Adele--in other words ""she started it!"" Yet at the same time understanding how their relationship was doomed to have major issues because of their divergent interests and personalities (which quixotically can also make a relationship heart-breakingly precious), and like pretty much all of us they weren't prepared to deal with that monster.
The performances are stunning, the real vehicle that makes this a special work of art. Both of the leading actresses are revelations (I am unfamiliar with them both), The sex scenes are graphic, but beautiful...This is one of those rare movies where the sex is actually presented realistically and not soft-core porn formulaic, so that it is actually essential to the movie.

Of course everyone is writing about the sex scenes between two young females, I think it added to the closeness of the two lovers and made what happens between them more realistic in the end.

Next, she gets hit on by a female classmate and ends up kissing her. Perhaps this gets her thinking, because it isn't long before she sees the girl with blue hair on the street (La Seydoux). They exchange looks and one thing leads to another and they strike up a relationship. If France had Oscars, I think that Exarchopoulos should own one. She's amazing to watch. She is extremely sensual in an absolutely innocent way. Her facial expressions are perfect and she is completely believable.

In the one scene where the two high school girls kiss --They could have made the movie about them and about there new friendship and love. This is the movie I would have made !!!! ( Like in the book-- Good Moon Rising-- )

And --when they first make love-- they could have went a little slower and started with them taking each other clothes off and exploring there bodies and kissing and then make love.

These are my thoughts -- I'm the kind of person who would change a little bit on every movie I see -OR- go into another direction all together --like I would have done in this movie --"" Blue is the Warmest Color"".

I'm ashamed to admit that this is why I was curious about the movie.  Does it contain explicit sex? Yes.  This is also the least important point about this film.

""Blue is the Warmest Colour"" is an exquisite coming-of-age story, a search for self, the confusion of youth, and finding and losing your first love.  The joy, eroticism and anguish of love are the same regardless of sexuality - and that's one of the excellent points ""Blue"" makes.  Adele seemed rather shallow throughout the movie to me, and that's the only fault I can find.  Emma urges her to explore her writing talents, and says she wants Adele to find something in life that makes her happy.  ""I am happy with you,"" she replies.  She learns what so many of us already know....that love alone is never enough.

We were absolutely spellbound by the brilliance of the performances of those two amazing young actresses and all the cast, and especially the way the director observed his players.

6051047,5,B00G3BVTKA,"It seems like its been years since Blue is the Warmest Color was released, solely because there has been so much talk about this film since it premiered in Cannes last year.  Whether there be talk on the content, the explicit nature of the sex scenes, the tremendous performances by the stars, the shared Palm win or the tyranny on set (thanks to those candid interviews likening director Abdellatif to Hitler), there has not been a lack of talk surrounding this award winning drama.  So, to say that I cant believe Ive FINALLY seen a film that was only released on DVD this week and only played in select theaters last October thanks to the subject, length and subtitles may seem odd and yet it doesnt at the same time.  It feels like everyone has already seen this and Im VERY late to the party.

Im glad I finally attended.

I love that controversy continually surrounds the very best of films, because there are always going to be critics or self-proclaimed critics trying to degrade any film that is put on a pedestal.  Its too long!  Its too gay!  Its too honest!  Its too European!  The bottom line is that Blue is the Warmest Color is about as good as they come, and to pick it apart or place upon it unfair criticisms is to not fully understand the depths to which this film actually goes.  Yes, it is long and it is gay and it is honest and its European, but I have yet to see a complaint and feels like a detractor.

Count me in!

The basic premise here is quite simple (but its not).  Adele is a young girl living in France who is attending High School and trying to discover herself.  She tries dating boys, but shes uninterested.  Then one day she happens to see a blue haired lesbian crossing the street and their eyes lock and shes hooked.  She thinks about her all the time.  She abuses herself to the thought of her.  She eventually seeks her out in a curiosity infused visit to a gay bar and stumbles across her.  Her name is Emma, and she is equally attracted to the young Adele.  Despite being tepid about announcing her love affair to her friends and family, Adele jumps right in, engulfing Emma and everything she represents.  But love is tricky and never as smooth as wed want it to be and as the years pass by and they settle into their life together, people, professions and insecurities begin to erode their happiness.

I hate the criticism that surrounds this film and others like it.  I remember when Brokeback Mountain was being heralded as THE film of 2005 and all the naysayers were barking about how the only reason people find it interesting is because it is a gay story, and once you take out the gay the story becomes just another troubled love story.  Maybe the GAY aspect of the story is the point.  Maybe it isn't supposed to be so different.  To me, this is such a lazy complaint.  A good story is a good story at the core, and a film like Blue is the Warmest Color reaches Bergman levels of blunt force honesty by dragging us to the depths of this love affair and actually developing a deeply moving portrait of love gained and lost.  Take away the gay aspect and you STILL have a powerful portrait of love gained and lost, but it is in those details that this becomes something so much more.

Adeles depiction as a girl unsure of her sexuality, ashamed almost, is a great plot point because it helps color in the fact that despite the forward steps made in the acceptance of the LGBT community, there are still so many stigmas attached to the idea of homosexuality.  Adele was frightened to embrace who she was, and it was that fear that caused her to make some foolish decisions, to hold back from being herself and ultimately lose out of what she wanted most.

But its more than that.

Strip away the gay aspect and you have a pretty rock solid depiction of a couple who has passed the point of mere infatuation and lust and moved into that area of subtle judgment.  You have the artistic and soulful Emma, older and surer of herself, who was initially attracted to the youthful innocence and high-minded ideals of Adele, but who has grown into quietly condemning her for being complacent in her life and not trying to be something Emma thinks she should be.  There is a moment when they are lying in bed and Emma tells Adele that she wishes she would do something that makes her happy and Adele says I teach and Lea tries to convince her that she should be a writer and then cops out by saying something like but its up to you and you can sense the judgmental mindset, the idea that Adele is beneath her because shes not trying to be like her.  This isn't uncommon in any relationship, and it is films like this that put a very familiar face on LGBT relationships, showing that they aren't any different than the ones we are used to.

We are all human beings.

There are three people who made this film work so well, and it is a beautiful thing that they all share the Palm.  Director Abdellatif Kechiche may have been a terror to work with, but he pulled out so much raw emotion from his stars and depicted such a raw and tremendously honest portrait of love that I cant help but applaud his methods, whatever they were.  His stars, Adele Exarchopoulos and Lea Seydoux, are so committed to these performances that it is no surprise that they were heralded as two of the greatest performances of the year.  Exarchopoulos is so raw here that you can see every shade of innocence get stripped away from her as she discovers her new life.  Seydoux is far more comfortable, easing into every scene, but her moment in the caf is a true testament to how well she built this character.  Her quiet breakdown in the midst of Adeles more vocal one is so heartbreaking.

And yes, there are some very explicit sex scenes here, but they are not gratuitous in the way that they were depicted as in some reviews.  These scenes are there to present us with a complete picture of how deeply invested in each other these two girls were, and that caf scene really brings us back to that in a very strong and connective way.

Her acting, the interesting methodically developed transformation of her sexual identity, her ignition of passion towards the feminine of her choice, the love affair and the eventualities of how the love affair plays out. Reality created true to life nuanced passionate love story. True lived in character became profoundly interesting as the youthful passion became inflamed. Creation of passion was well done by the actresses and director capturing the subtleties and slowness of the developing love, the pause during the eye contract. Her awakening into a sexuality orientation and leap into her identity took dramatic alteration from who she thought she was and it seemed at the end of the movie her transformation is still somewhat being discovered. Sequels can fully explore her sexual identity whether lesbian or perhaps someone who loves the person despite their sex.

Sexuality was utilized to explain and showcase the passions she felt and contrast them to her other love affairs especially the one with the male. Not everything in film needs to be imagined sometimes stark portrayals can truly take the audience into whats going on. We get to be completely immersed into the passions seeing some of the sexuality between the characters. We can therefore not only understand but feel more the character's spiritual love, her painful anguish, her desirous passions since we were allowed to voyeuristically step into the bedroom and take a peak. The relationship was unpredictable and you did not know what would happen next. The movie could have exploited this sexuality giving more of a thrill yet it remained controlled by holding back and focusing on the relationship and the psychoanalysis of love. This created more interesting characters.

A world that delights in the delectable sensuality of life. Not only regarding sex but food takes on a symbol of pleasure. You see side characters not so much indulging as taking real genuine sensual satisfying pleasure in eating.

The exquisite, philosophical, thought provoking, literary referenced, writing coupled with unbelievably believable acting portrayals made this possibly the best made film this year. Philosophical conversations not related to the thrust of the story but its themes such as the comparison of male vs female pleasure, gave the film another level of substance.

It was very long at 3 hours and you were left with wanting to literally follow the main protagonist and find out what would happen next in her life. A sequel was suggested at end credits and it would be wonderful to see more well made explorations of these subject matters following this amazing actress. Further learning and discovering her primordial essence with her and witnessing how she will indulge in it.

This Blu-Ray Is a Must Have!.",1393286400,4,2832,5.201754385964913

6051051,5,B00G3BVTKA,"This Abdellatif Kechiche movie adaption of Julie Maroh's award winning 2010 graphic novel (which she started writing at 19), is an intensely intimate and heart wrenching account of a 15 year's rite of passage, culminating in an intense  relationship. Adle (Adle Excharpoulos) a diligent, nave virgin from a conservative working class family, is initially perplexed by her attraction to Emma (Lea Seydou) a worldly, openly gay college student, when she first notices her in the street. An unfulfilling encounter with an attractive older male student followed by nightly fantasies and curiosity drives her to seek out Emma in a gay bar.

Deservedly, it won the Palme D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, garnering awards for director and both lead actresses. Apparently Kechiche was heavily criticized for the working conditions and poor salaries to which he subjected his actors and crew, many of whom quit mid-way.  The two lead actresses said they will not work with him again, later tempering their criticism after basking in the glow of it's favorable reception. One can only speculate if it was Kechiche's brutal perfectionism that elevated this film from mediocrity into a sublime work of art. His obsessive close-ups of Adle transform her from lead actress to muse, echoing a theme in the story itself - that of Emma's muse. The story takes place over several years, hence the original title ""The Life of Adle - Chapters 1 & 2"".

Without Adle herself being aware of it, we see her latent sensuality early on, greedily devouring spaghetti while making small talk with her parents. This will explode into the unbridled passion that Emma ignites in her. They become two sides of the same coin - Adle submissively nurturing and uninhibitedly physical, Emma intellectually controlling and ambitious. Their relationship is ultimately doomed. Adle is intimidated by and bored with Emma's highbrow friends and their existential philosophical debates; Emma is frustrated by Adle's ignorance and lack of ambition as a kindergarten teacher. But it is ultimately Emma's insecurity that is the undoing of this relationship. While being deeply in love with Emma, Adle is not emancipated enough to admit her sexual orientation to her colleagues and family, or to herself.

The recurring theme of ""Blue"" - Emma's hair, Adle's bedsheets, the primary color of Emma's paintings of Adle, Adle floating in the sea, culminating in the final scene where Adle is wearing a bright blue dress - creates a silent visual counterpoint to the intense dialog and naked angst which dominates the film.

Without a noticeable soundtrack, the audience is focused on the ecstasy and anguish of Adle and Emma's relationship. Their character development as the storyline progresses is subtle and finely nuanced.  Emma becomes more butch and pretentious, while Adle seeks the company of non-threatening peers, dabbling in heterosexual liaisons.  Where this film the has the edge over many of it's American counterparts, is that it draws the viewer in voyeuristically, while American films often sanitize or dilute raw emotion.

I did not read the reviews before watching it. I wanted to form my own unbiased opinion of this Palme D'Or winner and Oscar nominee. I was therefore unprepared for the lengthy graphic unsimulated sex scenes - one of which commanded over 10 minutes of screen time. There were times that I was reminded of the soft porn movies of the 70s, particularly Emmanuelle. Only the French can convey such realism without it feeling gratuitous or dirty, although it did drag on a bit. In fact, at almost 3 hours, the movie itself wallowed self-indulgently, with endless close-ups of the naturally beautiful, pouty lipped, greasy haired Adle. Despite its length, it held my attention - there wasn't a single scene that didn't enrich the story in some way.  Nevertheless, relegating 45 minutes to the cutting room floor would not have hurt, particularly as the ending was so abrupt.

It is undoubtedly one of the best films I have seen in a long time and should fare well at the Oscars, if the voters are not offended by the explicit nudity/sexual content vs the NC17 rating. Adle Excharpoulos' consummate debut performance complemented by Lea Seydou's equal brilliance will stay with you long after the movie is over.",1393027200,10,4296,5.114122681883024
6051052,5,B00G3BVTKA,"I saw this brilliant French film recently at my favourite cinema after eating a very good breakfast and all I can say is if you like watching foreign films with realistic characters and depth then this is for you. The themes explored include first love, identity, friendship, tolerance, forgiveness, social class, happiness, family, and of course physical intimacy. With an amazing acting performance by Adele this is one film that will stick in your mind regardless of where you are in your life. Here's a few poignant quotes from the film:

Adele:
I miss you
I miss not touching each other
Not seeing each other
Not breathing in each other
I want you
All the time
No one else

Emma:
I have infinite tenderness for you
I always will

6051054,4,B00G3BVTKA,"I did not realize it was in French, however I did enjoy the movie.  I thought it realistic and the acting, especially by the lead character Adele, was very good.  First love is always tough for the novice, let alone realizing you're gay.  It's a little long (3 hrs.) but you get to know Adele better.  They say 1 is the loneliest number, but that 2 can be as bad as 1 - so I believe this is the case ultimately with Adele.  Her immaturity and starry-eye love for Emma results in unsatisfactory consequences.  You may not like the film but it is thought provoking at the very least.  In my opinion, Emma was never really in love with her - hence the feeling of isolation by Adele.  The film cannot be compared to Elena Undone which is my #1 favorite concerning the subject matter.  It's apples and oranges.  One is about seasoned, matured adults (read ROMANTIC) whereas this film is about a very young girl facing her attraction to women and falling in love with a young but experienced female.  I differ in opinion with a friend who felt the sex scenes a little raw.  I disagreed and said get over it and remember when you were much, much younger!!!  Both have lovely bodies and the sex scenes are explicit.  After all it is what two women do sexually.  I would have preferred more sensuality and affectionate verbalizing, but you can't have everything bundled up into one package.  Otherwise, direct it yourself!!",1392681600,4,1414,4.529644268774703

It's not that I'm a prude but they were too long (one was about 15 minutes long).  The movie was dragged down by the fact that a story that would have been great at 2 hours or so, was a 3 hour movie.

6051062,1,B00G3BVTKA,"I'm writing this review from the perspective of someone who enjoys movies and needs something to latch onto in order to connect with a film.  This could be anything ... pathos, ethos, comedy, a powerful message, voyeurism, anything. Well, this movie was joyless and uninteresting.  It wasn't poignant at all which would've made me connect with it.  Adele didn't seem capable of experiencing joy at any level, as a teen, a woman, a lesbian, a woman who sleeps with men, as a teacher ... Zip. Emma was almost Aspergerish in her lack of affect.  Whether in the gay or straight world ... these characters were so hollow and boring. What is the subtext, then, that lesbian life is joyless?  This movie was set in France.  I would've appreciated the inclusion of some fashion sense somewhere in the film.  If not that, Adele could've brushed her hair at least once.  And why were all the shots of her crying filled with snot running down her chin? Realism overkill.  I do disagree with some of the issues some viewers have regarding the authenticity of lesbian sex in this movie.  If two women have sex with each other, then this sex is lesbian sex.  Unless someone has been privy to participating in or watching every instance of lesbian sex on planet Earth, who's to say that intimacy between the  two characters wasn't gay enough?  That's a bit arrogant. The sex scenes could've panned out the same way if the director was a woman.  Sex is sex and it's expression is unique to every copulating couple, gay or otherwise. I would've enjoyed the movie if it was three hours worth of character growth ... if it made me once cheer or cry for the characters.  In the worse case, even if Emma had been  cynically predatory as the older woman, at least there would have been some dimension to the film.  It's three hours and $6.95 I will never get back.  What a flat experience.  Sigh.",1392249600,41,1874,4.590361445783133

Tunisian born director Abdelatif Kechiche has shown some sensibility in previous movies (for instance Games of Love and Chance) but this Cannes festival winner feels quite exploitative (his previous movie, Black Venus, was also nasty, disappointing and sensationalistic). The young actresses who play the lead (Lea Seydoux and Adele Exarchopoulos), who are not porn actresses, appear in very explicit, seemingly non simulated sex scenes (including masturbation, oral sex, fingering and doing the sex position popularly known as the 69). It would be interesting to wonder if a lesbian director (instead of a male director) would have filmed this story differently, perhaps less explicitly and more subtly. Interestingly, both actresses have complained after the film was released that they felt exploited during the filming and will not work with the director again.

In three hours time, you'll forget you're watching a movie and you'll instinctively want to reach into the screen and hug her, comfort her pain. It's excruciatingly real..as real as it gets. I only wish the final cut of this movie would've allowed her character to explain in more detail why she did what she did, why she felt the need to be comforted by her co-worker, why she felt so alone. Emma (La Seydoux) wants Adle to be who she's not when she prods her about her writing. Adle explains that she is happy as she is, but she senses that Emma isn't satisfied with that. She feels her drifting emotionally towards her old love Lise. The fight scene never touches this fact, and that bothered me horribly because Adle may have cheated physically, but Emma cheated emotionally. I wanted to scream at Adle to speak up, to say something, anything, to make Emma see that she shared the blame, and instead I had to gut-wrenchingly watch Emma tear Adle apart with her words. It wasn't fair. It just wasn't fair. If they could've understood that, maybe they could've stayed together. Maybe they would've realised that their love for one another was more powerful than the differences that separated them. And, so the words at the end will always haunt me...""She seems totally at peace yet there's something troubling in her eyes. There's an incipient happiness, but also a lot of anguish. Her gaze is absent yet it seems to beckon us."" The controversy over the nudity and explicit sex-scenes is easily extinguished if you've ever watched an interview by Adle.

Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0

Okay I'm generalizing, but in so many cases, If you're looking for an intense film about relationships, French films trump American ones, because the French just seem inherently to be the experts when it comes to love and passion. French-Tunisian director Abdellatif Kechiche's intimate dissection of a romance between two young women is no exception. His film won the Palme d'Or, the top award at the Cannes Film Festival. This was the first time a director and two actresses collectively received the award--by a panel led by such film industry luminaries as Steven Spielberg, Nicole Kidman and director Ang Lee.

The film features a smashing performance by Adle Exarchopoulos who has the same first name as the film's protagonist. When we first meet Adle, she's a high school student confused about her sexual identity. She sees a young blue haired woman on the streets and has dreams about her. Prodded by her gossipy classmates, she has a brief, unsatisfactory relationship with a boy, but soon breaks up with him after an encounter with a female classmate, who first kisses her on the steps outside of the school. The female classmate tells her that she wasn't serious about the encounter but Adle is taken to a gay bar by a male gay friend but she soon wanders off to a lesbian bar, where she meets the blue-haired woman she had seen out on the streets earlier.

The young blue-haired woman is Emma (played by an equally intense La Seydoux), an older art graduate student. They begin a steamy affair, culminating in a series of explicit sex scenes which has garnered quite a bit of publicity for the film. The second Act occurs after a passage of time--now Emma is trying to break into the art world as a professional artist and Adle has begun a job as a kindergarten teacher. Director Kechiche pulls out all the stops in depicting the burgeoning romance between the two women.

The problem with much of it is that it's just too drawn out. That not only includes the sex scenes but other scenes such as when the each women meets one another's parents (Emma's upper middle class parents know that she's gay and are immediately accepting of Adle; but Adle's lower middle-class parents are left in the dark as to the nature of their relationship). Mr. Kechiche can't resist closeups of each character discussing how much they enjoy the pasta they're eating. Another earlier scene, where Emma and Adle engage in a long intellectual discussion about Sartre and other sundry topics on a park bench, also seems to go on and on.

But I was grudgingly willing to put up with the incredibly drawn out spectacle to see what the final outcome of the relationship was between the two lovers. Before the final blowup, cracks in the facade of the relationship, begin to emerge. Adle, working much more simply with children, begins to feel out of place in Emma's more sophisticated world of art professionals. Finally, with Emma spending more time in the art world, Adle has a brief fling with a guy, a fellow male co-worker from her job at the school. Emma finally figures out that Adle has been cheating on her and she flips out. She throws Adle out of her house and tells she never wants to see her again. I like how Emma was depicted in the scene where she dumps Adle, as her lack of flexibility and unwillingness to forgive the vulnerable Adle, showed her to be cold and overly controlling. In other words, there's a multi-dimensionality to the character.

The rest of the film I would say is anti-climactic. Some years pass and Adle spends a good deal of time by herself, trying to get over her relationship with Emma, but not quite doing so. She finally meets with Emma after quite a bit of time has gone by, who ostensibly has forgiven her. Adle attempts to force herself on Emma in a restaurant but Emma is now committed to another woman and rejects her. Flash forward again--Emma invites Adle to her art exhibition, where Adle finally accepts the fact that Emma has moved on. Her run in with the actor (who's now a real estate agent) doesn't seem to go anywhere.

'Blue' is a three hour movie but it probably could have been more effective with 45 minutes of less footage. I wonder if the sex scenes were pared down, the film would have garnered as much publicity as it did. The end of filming was not the end to the controversy. Not only did union members complain about director Kechiche over working them but Exarchopoulos and Seydoux indicated that they never wanted to work with Kechiche again as they indicated that he treated them roughly while shooting the film.. Seydoux went as far as saying that she felt like a ""prostitute"" during the film shoot. Kechiche was offended by his actors' comments and at one point was quoted as saying that he hoped the film would not be released. There was also talk that Kechiche was going to sue Seydoux for her comments.

Probably both parties overreacted. Exarchopoulos and Seydoux knew what kind of film they were getting into, when they signed the contract to act in it and they probably should have known Kechiche was a perfectionist. On the other hand, Kechiche perhaps should have taken into account his actors' sensibilities and directed them a little more gently.

All in all, 'Blue is the warmest color', is a well-made film which captures the intensity of the intense relationship between two young women, who ultimately were not right for each other. The film needed to flow better and the editing was just not there. If you're willing to put up with the film's overall length, you will still be rewarded with some phenomenal acting and intense dissection of a relationship that ran its course.",1390953600,12,5717,4.708

My lovely girlfriend and I were excited to see this film -lauded as an intense and groundbreaking experience that would surely haunt us for days with its portrayal of lovers going beyond the void and finding true bliss!

Yes, we were haunted -first with boredom, then genuine betrayal as opportunities were missed one after another and the events began to veer from unlikely to ridiculous -and seriously out dated.

Finally, an hour into the thing, we erupted in laughter.  No amount of media hype or Kool-Aid consumption could keep us from spontaneously cracking up in the theater as the eager teen and her creepy-pale ghost like lover crashed their prosthetics together repeatedly and spanked each other in uninspired strip club fashion.

Yes, NC17 for shaved latex, avert your gaze, it will captivate!

John Waters should have taken over the Directors chair at this point since the film had finally -and thankfully, collapsed into a queasy farce. Let me cut to the chase. The concept of this agonizing train wreck of a film has the grimy fingerprints of a man cave production all over it. Problems no doubt arose when the brilliant balding gamer knuckleheads put down their joy sticks and realized that they might need a couple hours of filler to make it a film. The final product manages to insult the intelligence of anyone rested up enough to snore their way through it's glacial pace and length.

Every tired coming of age stereotype of the last 20 years was thrown at this thing and the result is about as tasty as a festering scab and as clever as a rotary phone. If you reviewed this film and gave it 5 Stars you have missed an entire fleet of boats. There is just too much wrong with this film to even begin to catalogue it all. Really.

We are greeted by the main starlet -and her mom and dad as they all cram their faces with huge blobs of drippy red pasta that crawls down their chins and bounces from cheek to cheek. Meant to illicit how voracious the tween starlet will be when she takes a mouthful of her eventual bff-gf???  Starlet girl by the way looks about 9 years old, buck teeth full of red pumice. Next scene we get a long loving gaze at her naked bottom as she snoozes in her kid bed.

There are many meals in this film and we are forced to sit through them all... French erotica? Well, they are all disgusting and all pointless unless you needed help regurgitating your Red Vines. Nearly every scene is a stillborn stare since they couldn't manage to convey anything of substance by way of a script, storyline, or acting. The two leads yield so little chemistry that it takes a minute to realize how painful the next 2 plus hours will truly be for us -the captives.

A couple of glances are passed between these girls before they are grinding away silently as if on display for some hidden camera men and the rest of their male crew... Oops. It turned out to be so ghoulish, pornish and pathetic that I felt sorry for any real gay couples in the theater who must have been cringing. This film is not erotic by any definition, it breaks no ground -in fact the film is so retrograde it makes the LGBT community out to be a figment of some straight guy's imagination.

The young couple barely converse and we are left wondering why are they even together? The editor of the film must have quit at some point during the process. Tens of minutes are spent with the camera planted on faces dripping with drool and crocodile tears. Our sad girl walks aimlessly with no clue why she cries for a girl that cheats on her, a girl that ignores her, dumps her. Sad girl continues to pine away, begs for more under the table only to get dumped again... Sad girl never considers how poorly she's been treated and all but gives up on the thought of maybe getting over it or finding someone new! She stays stuck and crying for the final hour with not an ounce of growth or transformation in sight.

The film makers must have had a bucket of drool that they poured over the head of sad girl before every take, she was beyond sympathy by the end of it. The mechanized sex scenes in contrast were painfully dry and powdered as if staged for an Auto Parts calendar.

American audiences are eagerly gobbling up this empty putrid tripe and awards have been given which has led my GF and I to shake our heads and discuss this dumb thing for the past few days...

So, there it is, you WILL discuss it and you will be confounded by its popularity and positive reviews. You will wonder if you are crazy or too picky or too critical... but no, don't doubt yourself here, you are correct, it is an atrocity of a film.",1390089600,54,4640,4.455188679245283
6051088,5,B00G3BVTKA,"""Blue is the Warmest Color"" was my favorite film of 2013 and the best movie I've seen in years. This movie is nothing short of a masterpiece. Steven Spielberg told Adele Exarchopoulos it was the best love story he'd ever seen. I wouldn't doubt it, I can't think of a film that more realistically and honestly depicts the nature of love, which looks the same no matter what the orientation of its players. Two of the bravest and most memorable performances I can remember... Adele Exarchopoulos is the birth of a genius onscreen. Seydoux is also evenly matched with respect to her degree of talent. Director Abdellatif Kechiche leaves you spellbound for the whole movie. Controversy aside, this movie is worth seeing for far more than its NC-17 content and I think audiences will be surprised by the depth of the surrounding material. It's odd that the sex scenes have become such a point of discussion and speaks to cultural hangups more than anything else. Those scenes comprise less than 10 minutes of the 3-hour film, which is in essence the story of growing up and experiencing first love, and the rollercoaster ride that accompanies it. This film is ambitious in its scope and I have yet to see several of the scenes in this film play out in other movies. Truly, some of the best onscreen chemistry and commitment I've seen performers give. They are at 150% the whole way through and there isn't a moment where any of it feels contrived, which isn't suprising given that the actresses improvised most of the film.

This film isn't for everyone; it is 3 hours long, French with subtitles, sex and nudity (which I feel is justified), and it is what I'd call a slice-of-life minimalist film, if that isn't your cup of tea you may want to look elsewhere but personally, this film is a treasure and I'm so glad I stumbled upon it. This film speaks truth, and you can't ask for much more with respect to the magic that transpires on screen and the perfect trifecta of artists that are Kechiche, Seydoux, and Exarchopoulos who won the first ever triple Palm d'Or at Cannes for this very reason. Spielberg mentioned if this movie was as much as 3% different in any aspect it wouldn't have worked, I agree it was just the right amount of everything, you can't lose with these three onboard. This film has been recognized internationally for its brilliance, made most critics top 10 list for the year, and was largely snubbed at US awards shows for political reasons, which is unfortunate. For the curious, this film is not a political commentary, but rather a story of two people who find one another and journey. And a worthy journey it is! I do believe this film will one day be seen as a classic. It is a very special and singular film.

Note: This Criterion Edition DVD is just the movie, if you are waiting for the additional 40 minutes the director plans on including in his Director's Cut version (also a future Criterion edition) you may want to hold out on buying this now.",1389657600,11,2978,4.6169811320754715

UNTIL I SAW THIS FILM.  Matching Glen Close's believability comes the two star women here.  Everything felt as if there were hidden cameras in their lives and you were privy to it.  Even the sex scene and the kissing scenes were so real that I felt in a way intrusive just to watch them!  Nothing was porno about it so this movie won't impress those seeking out x rated girl/girl sex.

6051097,4,B00G3BVTKA,"This French film, the winner of the Palme d'or at the 2013 Cannes film festival, has been generating almost equal amounts of praise and controversy since its arrival stateside. Based on a graphic novel (unread by me), ""Blue"" charts out the stages of an intense romantic relationship between two young women - Adele, a working-class high school student, radiantly played by Adele Exarchopoulos, and a twenty-something middle-class art student, Emma (Lea Seydoux). Most of the controversy, which persists in many of the comments sections of other Amazon reviewers, centers on two fairly extended sex scenes that earned the film an NC-17 (although only a ""no one under 12 permitted"" rating in France).

Most of the film is an introspective but passionate study of Adele: her hopes, desires, resentments, and, ultimately, sadness. Abdellatif Kechiche, the co-writer and director, spends a considerable amount of screen time focused on Exarchopoulos's face - and she *is* beautiful even if at first sight she seems awkward and nondescript. The courtship scenes with Seydoux, when the two circle each other warily, are delicately rendered. The tenderness shared between the two actresses feels so genuine that its no wonder that both shared in the Palme d'or with Kechiche. For the first hour or so, the film is every bit the masterpiece that so many have claimed it to be.

But then the sex scenes take on a formal, almost clinical, tone that, at least for me, threw me out of the movie. Its as though another, more brusque, director took over. They don't reveal anything about the characters or their volatile emotions and are  designed instead to be provocative for their own sake. Maybe I was influenced too much from reading about Kechiche's difficult treatment of the two women on the set, but as I was watching these ""controversial"" scenes, I was thinking of them more as actresses trying to please their director than as their characters in the film. Aiming for extreme realism, Kechiche achieved more than he bargained for: having focused so much in the film's first hour on the characters' faces and their subtle emotional shifts, it seems like a horrible betrayal to spend the better part of ten minutes fixated on their derrieres. These sex scenes, and some of the later overextended sequences of Adele teaching in her classroom, tell us more about Kechiche's self-indulgence than the lives of his characters.

Thus, I can't take this film to my heart as much as others have: Kechiche goes on too long and too far for no apparent reason (contrast this film with Eric Zonka's compact, masterly ""The Dreamlife of Angels"" from 1999 to see what I'm getting at). But the film's strengths are also undeniable. Exarchopoulos and Seydoux's performances are so finely nuanced that you start to feel the sadness encroaching at the slightest hint that they're drifting away from each other. The film is novelistic in its attention to detail and its careful rendering of place. And, even more, ""Blue"" is about how class divisions are replicated even in intimate life: Adele becomes painfully aware that she has neither the cultural background to keep up with Emma's art-school friends nor the interest in Emma's prodding her to become more than an elementary school teacher - a job at which she's quite contented to stay.

""Blue,"" then, is a near-great (or semi-great) film. To dismiss it as simply a ""lesbian film"" (as if there was some problem with that) or an arty porn flick is to do it a great disservice. Flaws aside, the film beautifully modifies Tolstoy's famous dictum: all relationships are the same *and* are unique in themselves - both in how people come together and in the ways they break apart.

While I'm sure Criterion's February 2014 DVD release will be sufficient for most people, diehards should know that a more deluxe edition will be released later in the year.",1387843200,15,3877,4.966101694915254

6051099,5,B00G3BVTKA,"At almost three hours long, this film never once tired me. I must admit I was intrigued wondering what they are going to do with Adele and Emma. Two very different girls who come together. Adele is the protagonist, she is the definition of the word, cherubic. At times beautiful, within the first hour she becomes a family member in your living room, you can't help but understand her entirely and even empathise.

Emma, on the other hand, has a mysterious smile with no fixed stare/gaze in her eyes. Her head is often tilted when she is studying Adele like a book. She has a gap in her teeth. She seems hurt but her behaviour despite her company is so stolid you will really keep thinking about just one thing, the title.

More than 1/6th of the movie involves love making scenes. It makes you understand without meaning to perhaps but it does make you understand how women discover their sexuality. Almost every question you will have will be answered and the film will let you free.

What I liked most about the film were the actors. The central character is this everyday cherubic girl who loves to eat foods. She isn't shy, she is just never easily impressed. Infact almost nothing impresses her in the whole film. She is curious but never over ambitious to prove anything to herself or anyone else around. She has many looks but just one mouth so you always know its her. When you finally see a genuine smile on her face in the film, you will say oh that's how she smiles. I am a 29 year old straight man who has been forever interested in the possibilities and endless angles of sexuality that exists in the female anatomy but maybe I am only saying this because now I know very vaguely what its about. I hope this will not give a wrong message to readers who are reading but this is the most under stated of films that will leave your world rocked.

What I didn't like about the movie is how it just sort of leaves you and walks away with itself. I mean 3 hours into the film you fear you have a sense of entitlement (even though somewhere you know you don't) it just walks away.... But maybe that is what left me crestfallen and deeply missing both Emma and Adele.

Emma is the character to watch out for. Someone who's such a good actor, she should be acknowledged and rewarded by awards.

This film though, from start to finish, is an act of bravery and courage that I never had to exhibit in all my time serving my country.  My enemies were faceless, the actors in this film had to face their enemies, and their demons, up close every second, and they had to do it in the cerebral cauldron of a modern film studio..

This entire film is an act of middle class bravery that few on the front lines of ""real"" war will ever experience, and maybe bullets and mortar shells have more shock value than explicit sex scenes, but I wonder how many servicemen or their families would be willing for them to trade places with actors who aren't just prepared to lay down their lives, but also to lay themselves bare.",1386720000,14,994,4.356756756756757

This movie follows the romantic and sexual awakening of a young girl named Adele who falls in love with a blue-haired (hence the title) girl named Emma.

6051103,5,B00G3BVTKA,"This is the most emotionally painful film I have ever watched concerning romantic love.  It has the most realistic psychological depiction of the after effects of a breakup that I have ever witnessed on film, this is a transcendent film (I am a heterosexual male and I was able to relate to the main character) and performance by the lead actress, who should win every award on the planet for her otherworldly performance.  It is the most impressive performance I have ever seen by any actor or actress anywhere and at anytime, rivaling if not far surpassing anything that I have ever seen on film (and I have watched almost everything both past and present).

Blue is the Warmest Color is a film that completely defies categorization, I hold graduate degrees in Literature, Philosophy and Film Theory and I don't know what it is (tragedy, romance, gothic horror, or some completely new genre).  I don't know what it is, but I do know that it is one of the most intimate dissections of the tragedy of human existence that I have ever seen or read in any  cultural product or any work of art that I have ever experienced in my lifetime.

I have never seen anything quite like this movie, its beautiful depiction of the tragedy of the human experience is devastating.  It is simultaneously the most beautiful and one of the darkest and emotionally complex visions of life that I have ever seen put on film. The actresses performance literally crawls underneath the viewers skin and haunts you for days after the ending of the film, I am trying to forget it, it is that emotionally painful.  All the more gut wrenching in that there is no antagonist in the film, she is totally and completely a victim of the antinomies hidden within human existence itself.

There is the faintest whisper of a very dark nightmare running just below the surface of all of these beautiful luminescent images.  A nightmare not about any particular thing whether social, political or personal, but having to do with existence itself and how we are all victims of it.  There is an uncanny feeling that existence feeds on us, by making and compelling us to feed upon it.  So although there is a critical sociological component to the film concerning the narrow mindedness of the greater society and its intolerance of differing modalities of sexual experience, there is a much deeper and darker layer to the film.

Not for the faint of heart, and that is not because of the sexual content, it is because of the emotional content which is amazingly potent.  It is the most brutally honest film concerning the loneliness and isolation that overcomes someone when they have lost someone they have been emotionally attached to that I have ever seen, or that I will ever care to see, not to sound hyperbolic but this film is quite literally a masterpiece.",1386288000,248,2825,4.715447154471545

It is grown-up movie (especially for the dialogue more than the sex-stealing scenes), one of the protagonist is already quite mature & will eventually meet the "" blue "" of her life, without spoiling the ending, the loved as "" blue "" eyes unlike her younger lover!

Now about Adele, there is a few people who believe that she never achieve maturity but she really does achieve maturity, at the end when walking out by herself, it is a long road, full of obstacle, first her male lover, her school friend, even her parents but she does learn at her own speed.

Is the movie over-rated?

Yes & No, the movie is a bit "" shocking "" like "" Last Tango in Paris "" , you either like it or you don't... you have a pleasant road following the protagonists or the movie is like a visit to the dentist... will it ever end?

No, if scenes of nudity shock you, especially between 2 protagonists of the same-sex

I never got a sense of any kind of chemistry between the two women or indeed between Adele and anyone else in the movie with the exception of the school children and even then she stumbled about like a zombie on valium.

The sex scenes were the worst I'd seen since Fatal Attraction, frantic, awkward, forced with no sense of connection or real attraction.  I have to wonder if the director had any experience with sex at all, gay or straight.

It's a great movie but didn't hit me in a lot of the ways I expected it to nor in the same way many other 5-star films would. It also didn't really help that while the film started to (mostly) follow the book, it went way off in a different direction by the end and it also lost a lot of the book's moments which made it such an emotional gut punch for me.

Despite the initial flaws like that, I wound up really enjoying the film for what it was: an honest look at a deep relationship over the span of years. If nothing else, the film is beautiful and well-made from a technical angle. It's a soft, subtle, yet very grounded-in-reality type of film that in many ways shows us how different we are when we're younger compared to how we are as we get older. The sex scenes that many talk about were very intense at times. While I've seen people talk about them as being almost downright pornographic, they really show multiple shifts in things throughout the film. First, when Adele has sex with a guy, it's short, sweet, and a little boring. When she's with Emma the first time, it's long and passionate, but subsequent scenes get shorter until they get to a point where they're in bed and just cuddling as opposed to having a lot of sex. To me, this was less about being pornographic and more about showing the loss of passion in their relationship, which was quite core to the story.

While I've stated I had issues with how the movie detracted from the book, I also really like what they did at the same time. The emotional gut punches in the book might be gone, but in their place they expanded on the later parts of Adele's life. In the book, Adele (or Clementine as she's called in it) goes to dinner with Emma at her house like in the movie but in specific, her parents actually kick her out of the house in a very angry, heartbreaking scene. After that, there's only a few pages highlighting Adele's life afterwards, like meeting Emma's family, showing how she became a teacher, Emma getting a haircut, etc. but without elaborating on anything. Then suddenly we flash forward about 15 years to where she's now just about 30. Instead, the movie actually goes in depth with her becoming a teacher, going to Emma's art gatherings and art shows, and just her overall adult life. It was enjoyable and refreshing despite the lack of what I felt was the book's overall emotional intensity.

My overall feelings are that this film is beautiful. It's a stellar movie with a great director and two daringly amazing leads, even if they had a lot of negative things to say about the director by the end of it all. It's a very real and down-to-earth film about love and loss. If you haven't read the book, it's worth watching all the same and is very much worth your time. If you have read the book, go in with a bit of caution in mind: it's not the same, but taken for what it is by itself it's still a fantastic film.

6051107,1,B00G3BVTKA,"Highly contrived ""love story"", while beautifully shot, feels more like the director's fantasy than an actual relationship.  The sex was, in my opinion, a distraction- really just stepped up porn.  The story was predictable.  I was left wondering what the hype was all about.

I honestly feel that if this were a ""straight"" movie, no one would have cared too much.  However, beautiful women sell product.  And this movie, despite all the promise of being a revelatory experience, is nothing more than a packaged and monetized product.",1385683200,34,533,5.068965517241379
6051108,1,B00G3BVTKA,"I was extremely excited to see this year's Palm D'Or winner. What I got instead was a sophomoric vision of ""love"" that feels more like a lame morality play than something real. The sex scenes are clearly made to titillate, nothing more, as they add nothing to the story or film is a whole. Sure, both actresses are incredibly beautiful, but the 5- minute long sex scene, which turns laugh-out loud silly by the end, feels exploitative and more like what the director would like to see two attractive women do than actual lesbian sex.

The story is predictable garbage, the dialogue trite and pretentious. Takes seem to last forever with no discernible purpose. Things happen for no particular reason, and the entire third act seems devoid of any logic or characterization, especially after the dissolution of their relationship. As well, Adele as a beautiful body but her mouth is open the entire movie. There are several dinner scenes that are equally disgusting, lest you love watching gross people eat.

This film feels like a giant prank. The director and screenwriter clearly don't know any lesbians and just imagine what a stereotypical lesbian relationship is, the film acts as if homosexuality is still some giant hush hush taboo that no one talks about...the whole thing is just pretentious crap and the art world has bought into it for some reason. The Emperor is naked, his clothes do not exist.",1385596800,49,1406,4.878661087866109
6051109,5,B00G3BVTKA,"BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR is a quite extraordinary movie. From the
first minutes director Abdellatif Kechiche fixes his camera on the
protagonist Adele (Adele Exarchopoulos), and never lets us take our
eyes off her as she embarks on a voyage of discovery, both personal and
sexual. The movie thus becomes extremely claustrophobic; we see Adele's
reactions to each and every situation, and share her pain as she
discovers her sexuality. Set in small-town France, the film explores
how Adele and her girlfriend Emma (La Seydoux) try to continue their
passionate relationship in a world where same-sex affairs are still
stigmatized. That knowledge inevitably affects the way in which Adele
and Emma react to one another. Emma comes across as unsympathetic, more
interested in herself, her life and her career rather than her loved
ones; but we can understand why she behaves in this way in a context
where success depends mostly on career achievement. Adele has not got
to that stage yet, but painful experiences - both at school and out of
school - teach her to become more hardhearted, even if that feeling can
only be expressed through a noncommittal expression direct to camera.
The film has explicit sex scenes, but they seem somehow remote, almost
as if Adele and Emma are trying their best to achieve personal
fulfillment through physical means. The fact that they cannot achieve
it only emphasizes the difficulties of their relationship. Beautifully
photographed with an eye for telling detail, BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR
is one the starkest depictions of love I've seen for a long time.",1385596800,11,1591,5.03030303030303
6051110,5,B00G3BVTKA,"A good romance in American cinema is surprisingly difficult to find because most films of a romantic nature are either romantic comedies or romantic melodramas. They're a dime a dozen. But every once in a great while, you get a film that not only casts off the rom-com or melodrama usually associated with a romance story, but actually draws you in to the relationship in such a mesmerizing way with smart and absorbing storytelling and unbelievably brilliant performances is one of the rarest things imaginable. Director Abdellatif Kechiche's BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR is that film.

Based on the wonderful award-winning graphic novel by Julie Maroh, BLUE is the story of Adele (Adele Excharopoulos), who begins the film as a naturally beautiful 15-year-old high school student who is just trying to do her best to stay uneaten in the feeding frenzy of adolescence. She keeps with her friends; she dates a cute boy; she pleases her working-class parents; she does well in school. But all that changes one day when she walks across a street, and sees Emma (Lea Seydoux), a haunting and beautiful older college student with dyed blue hair. They share a gaze, and in that instant, Adele is transfixed. She can barely move. She has really felt that thing we all look for: love at first sight. After losing her virginity with her boyfriend as an attempt to deny her ""abnormal"" feellings, she clearly doesn't feel the love and desire for him that she wants to, and breaks it off with him. Through a sequence of events, she has a chance meeting with Emma at a gay bar, and they become friends. The friendship clearly blossoms into something more, and their passions reach a fever pitch as they make love for the first time. They begin a relationship that is hidden from Adele's family and friends, but is open and accepted by Emma's. The relationship spans several years from Adele's student days and to her becoming a teacher of kindergarteners, and Emma changes from starving artist to toast of the town. But their relationship has problems. Despite the length of time they've spent together, they seem to be losing one another. Does love overcome, or is the passion of youth weighed down by the practicality of adulthood?

When this film was presented with the Palme D'or, the highest award at the Cannes Film Festival, it wasn't just presented to director Kechiche, but also to leads Excharopoulos (this is her first major film role) and Seydoux (who some filmgoers might recognize from American films like MIDNIGHT IN PARIS or MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL) and the reasoning behind that is that they were all equal parts of what makes this film so remarkable. Kechiche directs the film using a lot of close-ups, allowing the audience very much in the lives and minds of the characters that inhabit the film. He also spares the audience any obvious artistic flourishes. There is barely any soundtrack to the film that isn't ambient sound from the settings within the film, so there are no music cues that instruct the audience how to feel. But Kechiche's skill behind the camera pales in comparison to what is possibly one of the most revelatory screen debuts I've ever seen, and that is from Excharopoulos, who so bares herself in both body and soul that it may be one of the singularly most immersive performances I've seen since Charlize Theron's amazing turn in MONSTER. Seydoux is as close to Excharopoulos's level as possible, which is an obvious challenge, but she plays the wiser, edgier and more experienced Emma close to perfection opposite Adele's wide-eyed, voracious youth, hungry for knowledge, experience and love.

Both regretfully and triumphantly, the film's most talked-about sequence is a nearly 10-minute love scene between Adele and Emma which, while being graphic (but not unsimulated), is exciting, erotic, tender, a little clumsy, and beautiful. It gives the film its NC-17 rating, and I regret that it's the scene that most articles and reviews tend to bring up, but I also think it's a triumph because no one has talked this way about an NC-17 film since the film that effectively killed the rating being taken seriously, and that is Paul Verhoeven's SHOWGIRLS. Another thing that is brought up in regards to this film is the seemingly endless war of words between Kechiche and his two leads, but more than anything, that's just fodder for the gossip columns and not worth the time to remark on it any further.

For fans of the graphic novel, there are certainly differences that will surprise and possibly disappoint them. A major plot point is dropped from this film in favor of something that seems more realistic, and that actually works in the film's favor, however, if how the film plays out is how it played out in the graphic novel, it would not have worked. It's best to think of them as two separate but equally amazing pieces of art that share a great deal, but one story works better in the graphic novel, and one works better in the film.

To me, this is the most romantic film since Ang Lee's BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, and let me qualify that statement. Yes, they are both romance epics about same-sex love, but for whatever reason, I haven't seen another film between the masterpiece of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN in 2005 and this film in 2013 that reflects what it truly feels to be in love, and is also so achingly beautiful and sad and heartfelt and real as we watch the relationship progress, flourish and disintegrate through time.

BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR is certainly one of the very best films of the year and possibly of the decade, and has what is certainly to be the two best female performances in recent years. I can only hope that Exarchopolous and Seydoux are remembered and rightfully recognized during Oscar season.",1385424000,136,5766,4.830971659919029

The two actresses are fabulous, two of the most beautiful women I've ever seen in a movie together, and the supporting cast with their dialogue makes this movie a real joy.  The young girl is beautiful and she's crying in front of her gay friend, because she was trashed and criticized cruelly  by her high school girlfriends.  ""Something's wrong with me, something is missing.  I can't stay with him....

Her friend accents her rant with a hand gesture, ""Finished.""  She laughs and says, ""Thank God I have you.""
