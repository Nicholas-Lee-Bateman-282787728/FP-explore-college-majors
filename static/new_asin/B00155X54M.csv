I was disappointed that a DVD purporting to be about music begins with a poorly sung song (off key and a group of children singing extremely out of sync) To me this DVD seems to be more focused on ""stuff"" to try to make a child interested than it is on actually teaching much about music.",1404259200,,448,4.2823529411764705
8257625,5,B00155X54M,This has been one of my child's favorite DVDS. She loves this movie and wants to watch it all the time while it teachers her basic information.,1314576000,,143,4.333333333333333
8257626,5,B00155X54M,"My 2 year old son, whose not at all interested in cartoons, LOVES this dvd!  I bought it because he is very musical and I wanted him to learn more about music but on his level.  The quality, thought behind the production, and kid driven activities are excellent!!!  I even enjoy watching it...and it's the video he wants to watch over and over and over again!  Great for children 2-6.",1277164800,,384,4.442857142857143
8257627,5,B00155X54M,"My son loves this video and all of the Lots To Learn Videos.  Unlike most vidoes, the Lots to Learn vidoes keep his attention the whole time.  Buster and Gatto are so cute and make him laugh, and the songs are very catchy.  Best of all, they are educational so I don't feel guilty sitting him in front of the TV because I know he is going to learn.  I highly recommend all of these videos.",1226880000,,389,4.078947368421052
8257628,5,B00155X54M,"Lots To Learn continues with their series of entertaining and educational DVDs. Great segments that the kids love. Creative, colorful, fun...we love watching the Lots To Learn series together, and singing and dancing together is priceless. Good stuff, much better than the over-hyped DVDs out there from the large corps.  Music has plenty of short segments, games, alphabet, counting, colors, musical concepts, and lots of fun stuff that my kids and I all enjoy very much.
