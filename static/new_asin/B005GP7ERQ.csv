4693062,4,B005GP7ERQ,"Even though the title of this set is ""The Road to World War II"", going by the description and titles of the episodes given, this is actually a documentary series that was called Between The Wars that aired on TV during the 1970s with Eric Sevareid as host.  If this is the case, this is a long over-due series that is finally coming to DVD.  The series does a fairly good job of chronicling the world events during the 20 years of so-called ""peace"" that started with the end of World War 1 and the beginning of World War 2.  While this is not an exhaustive series on the subject, it does  provide good information for those who have an interest in this time period.",1313971200,30,665,4.296
4693063,4,B005GP7ERQ,This was both informative and entertaining as the topic states.  The Road to WW II.  I would recommend it to viewers.,1446940800,,117,4.523809523809524

4693079,1,B005GP7ERQ,"With unusual openness, this part of the series (not sure if I will watch any more) does its best to lay blame for the Depression, and then everything else bad in the world, at the feet of the capitalist system. Views of facts are presented with only one point of view, and no other opinions are seen. Conveniently, the (lack of ) action by the post WW1 government (Wilson, the Democrats) to stop the usual European money grabs by the other allies, the unsubtle emergence of communist labor organizing and its effect on prices and job creation, and the influx of post-war refugees are barely touched on, as if somehow Hoover managed to make it all happen by himself.",1401926400,,665,4.5966386554621845
4693080,5,B005GP7ERQ,Visual historical overview of one of the most tumultuous periods of the world.  Well worth seeing not only for the historical significance but also because it is so interesting.,1401235200,,177,5.103448275862069
4693081,2,B005GP7ERQ,"Everything, well, almost everything has a purple tint to it. Although I am enjoying it right now, the visual presentation, in this era when they have automated, computerized video 'correction' software, there is NO reason a dvd set should come out like this looking WORSE than a vhs tape at the 6 hour speed. And I am NOT kidding here. I'm at 8min 56 seconds into volume one and the picture literally looks dark and almost totally purple.
Again, a very well put together original series, but this DVD edition isn't worth $4.99. There are Too many companies putting out very well done/remastered dvd's for this to exist. For example, for $52 you can get
The World At War on Blu Ray. Or the Fantastic 'Apocalypse' set done by French Television. There are just a few that feature State Of The Art Video Remastering.  Readers Digest should stop selling these. Again x2, there is automated computer software that would have/can correct for 90% of the Off Color on this transfer, but, whomever transfered this to DVD should lose his or her job. This is an embarrassment to the original producers and to Erik and to Readers Digest. The funny thing is they burned the master at a very high Bit Rate! Just makes Purple Pictures look that much more Purple.
Unbelievable.........

4693082,4,B005GP7ERQ,I've forgotten how good Eric Sevareid was. This is a good narrative of the causes of world war II. Very good.,1398816000,,109,4.238095238095238
4693083,4,B005GP7ERQ,We thoroughly enjoyed this entire series of The Road to World War II.  We learned so much more about that time in our history and it was very enlightening.,1398470400,,155,4.344827586206897
4693084,1,B005GP7ERQ,An historical documentary should be an accurate account of historical events without political judgements. Eric Sevareid was never able to do this as a new reporter which is why he was demoted to commentary. This is just his version of what he wants you to think were the facts. His lack of credibility follows him. Not for history buffs.,1397779200,,338,4.745762711864407
4693085,5,B005GP7ERQ,Great. flix. Great background story.  More substance than I ever learned in school.  This is what they should be learning in school,1395705600,,131,4.909090909090909
4693086,5,B005GP7ERQ,"I believe that everyone and particularly the younger persons of today should know about not only what happened in History but how and why it happened. These movies do not provide all the answers but do provide a perspective that should provide some insight into today's happenings.  In paraphrase ""Those who do not study history are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past"".",1392595200,,376,4.875
4693087,4,B005GP7ERQ,"I found this and the rest of the series to be very informative.  Unfortunately, it feels like an abrupt halt since there's only a 6 part video.  I felt there should have been a 7th or more added to this series. It's like a movie with no ending.",1391990400,,244,4.0625
4693088,4,B005GP7ERQ,"I have always enjoyed history and because I was born during WW II, I have 2 brothers that fought in that war, so I am
especially interested in the events happening before it started.  Some I know, some I discovered.",1391731200,,215,4.375
4693089,2,B005GP7ERQ,"I love history documentaries so I didn't watch this for an editorial on the Hoover administration or the Capitalists VS Communists debate. It might just be me but it did sound as though they were saying the capitalist system proved less able to cope with the great depression than Stalin's communist system. (10,000,000 dead Russians might have disagreed).
I could have overlooked those detractors but then they got basic historical facts wrong. ""Japan did the first meaningful bombing of civilians from the air""? LOL, WTH does that even mean, ""Meaningful""? The people of several European cities and African countries might just disagree or ask ""Bombing us didn't count?"" ""The Japanese attacked China because they were angry about a Chinese boycott of Japanese goods""??? LOL again. ""What boycott""? I really do know a lot about WWI, WWII and the interim years and I don't recall anything about a war causing boycott. So ""Aw shoot"", I always thought they attacked Manchuria then China to seize their raw materials. Also, to copy the European way of expanding their Empire. By military conquest. Guess I was wrong...??
Overall, it's.....heheheh, ...it really is a pretty bad documentary. It LOOKS old, it SOUNDS old and the information errors may be the result of dated information. (IE: The fall of the USSR opened up vast amounts of new film and unseen archival documentation for historians to use) But hell, by way of that first book or film, we all started to learn about WWII somewhere. So, If you know next to nothing about the early 20th century, this doc isn't TOO bad a place to start.",1389052800,3,1591,4.9182156133829
4693090,1,B005GP7ERQ,"Ask yourself, ""How did a free society (Germany) manage to elect a dictator?""  next question to ask is WHO supported hitler?  It was the college youth, the academics, the elitists, and the artists.  Hitler first swept college campuses and professors long before he swept the average joe.  The exact same people in the US today..the leftists, anticapitalists and Obama voters are the same ones who brought the world into a devastating war.",1386115200,4,437,5.027777777777778
4693091,4,B005GP7ERQ,"Interesting view of both the US Great Depression and the associated global depression. Well and accurately narrated with talking points that cover the most important and basic aspects of this timeline. The original footage adds dimension. Certainly not intended as an in depth study but as a fast paced overview. Recommended for those with an interest in composite original footage from this era, beginners and those who want a succinct and accurate overview. For those well versed in military history, it offers a personal touch.  To review this as 'outdated,' is to miss the purpose of the series. It expresses a sentiment of the times. Certainly worth watching and learning for those who want a place to begin!

For the Depresssion Years consided the 'Thirties,' a Ken Burns production.",1385683200,2,789,5.108527131782946
4693092,5,B005GP7ERQ,"I just checked this out from the library and was completely enthralled by the coherent history lesson I received.  I have quite a few documentaries on World War II and one on World War I but this one truly shows the progression of events and political machinations that brought everything to a head resulting in the second world war within 25 years of the first.

As I watched each episode I was disturbed and chilled by the frightening similarities of our government's response to world affairs.  We still ""appease"" and bargain with men and governments who are quite obvious in their intentions to ""rule the world.""  The only thing that's changed is that instead of Nazis and fascists we have radical Islamists with a twisted interpretation of a legitimate religion.  Hatred may have a different face but it's objective is the same:  domination through cruelty, intimidation and terror.

I wish our ""leaders"" would watch this documentary and pay close attention to the ramifications of denying the existence of evil.  Although dated (it was obviously made in the 1970s), this is a very enlightening presentation that is still very relevant today.  It gives one cause to think.",1382486400,3,1177,4.964285714285714
4693093,4,B005GP7ERQ,"Narrated by Eric Sevareid, this well written and produced series covers the inter-war years, and does a very good job of it, too. No fluff and no 'History Channelesque' dramatics. Sadly, the series presents little information regarding the rise of fascism in the countries (except Italy) that became Germany's client states during World War II. However, this missing coverage does not detract from a most interesting and informative view of the world between the world wars.",1379376000,4,474,5.25
4693094,4,B005GP7ERQ,"If you felt like you needed more information about HOW we got involved (especially as a Middle School or High School history review), I thought this was very well done.",1374364800,,168,4.633333333333334
4693095,5,B005GP7ERQ,"Again, real footage and educated commentary/narration make this series a must for WWII buffs - especially for the back ground overview info.",1370563200,,140,5.409090909090909
4693096,5,B005GP7ERQ,"It is sad that to this date we do not learn from our past of horrendous loss of life and property because of decision made by few affecting entire humanity. It still goes on and history keeps repeating itself all over the world, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, etc, etc and the blood keeps being shed for NOTHING to be gained but misery. When will humanity ever learn from its past??",1368489600,,377,4.478260869565218
4693097,5,B005GP7ERQ,"To those of us who grew up hearing Eric Sevareid as the chief CBS news man, and seeing his comments on the world, the history of the War, and American character, this is a treat. His steady delivery and tone of voice make this a joy to listen to and learn from. Well worth the price.",1367193600,6,283,4.071428571428571

4693102,5,B005GP7ERQ,"This is very informative. And I find it one of the better World War II Documentaries.  I've watched many documentaries and read a lot of books on world war II.  And very few mention the state of the American Economy and Politics from 1914 to 1941.  This series does.  As I watch this in November of 2012 when Americans are recovering from the ""Great Recession"" I see a lot of Similarities.
This show illustrates that the argument for Left Wing Capitalism VS Right Wing capitalism has happened before.",1353110400,2,500,4.6477272727272725

8472062,5,B005GP7ERQ,"This series ran about 30 years ago under the name ""Between The Wars"" (There was also a corresponding book).  I had taped the series back in 1987-88 complete with commercials and although the commercials of 1988 can be nostalgic, the quality of those tapes by today's standards are not good.  Enter this DVD set. I have been searching for over ten years for a DVD replacement and here it is. This set is a must have for any mid 20th century history buff, being an excellent prelude to the series ""The World at War"". In addition, I do not think this series has been shown since the late 1980's",1522627200,,591,4.412844036697248

8472068,5,B005GP7ERQ,"Absolutely riveting! Although I have been variously, & voraciously, reading history, this documentary is so instructive in informing the viewers the much broader context which led to this catastrophe. It eloquently spells out the errors by the leaders and by 'democracies', as reflective of plurality, and contrasted against the principled-democracies rooted in laws/constitution and springing form informed electorate: errors that are still being blithely committed.

Particularly touching was the poignant story of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.
