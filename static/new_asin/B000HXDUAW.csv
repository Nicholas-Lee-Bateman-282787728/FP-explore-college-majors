2648603,5,B000HXDUAW,Very easy to buy a video tatch on Amazon.  My kids loved this movie!!  I like that they could go back and watch it again!!,1450483200,2,122,3.84
2648604,5,B000HXDUAW,It was a great movie and it really touches your heart I watch it with my friend and we laughed and cried that's how good it was.:-),1448496000,2,131,3.888888888888889
2648605,5,B000HXDUAW,"This Pokemon movie is my favorite. Plot, characters and animation was pure love. Veronica Taylor (original Ash) and Sean Schemmel (Lucario) are the best voice work. I'm glad it's in HD widescreen to make it perfect. I will enjoy this movie like old times.",1448323200,2,255,4.818181818181818
2648606,5,B000HXDUAW,"This movie is particularly intense for the franchise, but I at least would say that's its main appeal!  I can understand if others don't like it, it's not something that's 'easy' to stomach.",1444694400,2,190,4.757575757575758
2648607,4,B000HXDUAW,"Per my 9 year old Pokemon fan: ""It's pretty cool, but not the best Pokemon movie... Which is the first one"".",1443225600,,108,4.190476190476191

2648611,5,B000HXDUAW,"Is this DVD presentation in widescreen, or is it not? If not, I wouldn't recommend it. The five-star rating is for the film itself.",1349395200,,131,4.5

2648628,5,B000HXDUAW,"Really good pokemon movie but the animation quality/effects seemed less than that of other movies that came out around the same timeframe as this one. Not sure what that was about? Story is cute, my little girl enjoyed watching Mew's frolicking about lol, but the ending was too sad for my little daughter. She was pretty distressed actually. She is really tenderhearted and emotional so that's just a warning if anyone else out there has kiddos like that!",1472515200,2,456,4.858974358974359
2648629,1,B000HXDUAW,"I've seen EVERY episode of the Pokemon anime, played every game, and now, I've watched every Pokemon MOVIE! I must say this is the most boring thing ever created.

8142402,2,B000HXDUAW,"I really wanted to like this movie but can't. Somebody recommended this movie, saying that it is good, but the story just seemed like it was arbitrarily made up along the way... there is tree of life, and it will be destroyed, and who can save the world? Who else? Ash has the power, for some reason, the same with Lucario... and they use the ""Wave"" to save the tree of life... and save the world... oh well...",1509580800,,410,4.269230769230769
8142403,2,B000HXDUAW,"A lot of people praise this movie, but I didn't enjoy it. Not much happens for the first 70% of the movie! The last 30 minutes is pretty good, but before that it's just dancing, taking baths in hot springs, and Lucario whining and being depressed. Wasn't enjoyable to me. Much preferred Zoroark movie to this.",1506643200,,309,4.535714285714286
