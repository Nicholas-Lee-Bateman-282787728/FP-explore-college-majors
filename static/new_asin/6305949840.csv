1092807,5,6305949840,I have seen this movie many times on disney and I fell in love with it. It was so funny. It's one of my favorite Disney shows. It moves right along. The plot has no questions. The main character did the best job as the new headmistress. The girls in this movie are hot! They were so 'a person you don't want to get on the bad side with' it was funny. You got to see this movie!,1007078400,5,377,3.8461538461538463

7898076,5,6305949840,"One of Harland Williams best films (hard to find a bad film of his).  The only bad part of the film is that it isn't out on dvd.
The basic plot is a con man is released from prison and runs into a couple thugs he owes money to.  A series of events leads him to hide out as the new Headmistress of an all girls prep school, while he trys to con the schools main benefactor out of half a million dollars.
Shawna Waldron is excellent as Beryl, a neglected teenage girl who thinks her father has forgotten her.  The interaction between her and Harland is very well done.
The jokes in the movie are clean and humorous.  Definitely a movie worth owning.",1072828800,7,647,4.193548387096774
