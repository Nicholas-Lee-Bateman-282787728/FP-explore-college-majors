7992144,5,B00009OOFC,"I bought this for my 3 year old grandaughter for Christmas this year. I was expecting it to be more exciting with more things to find. I based it on what I saw in the ""I Spy"" books. So, based on my 46 year old mind, I didn't think it was that great. The reason I am giving it 5 stars is because my 3 year old grandaughter would not take her eyes off of it. She loved it! In fact her mom said that she rarely sits and watches anything with that much enthusiasm. Each DVD has like 6 episodes and each one has the child look for certain items. There aren't that many to find and most are pretty easy to spot for anyone over the age of 4. My grandson who is 6 spotted them right away. But, even he enjoyed it and watched it. I would say this is best for ages 2-4.",1387843200,,759,3.840764331210191
7992145,5,B00009OOFC,"I purchased for my 4 yr. old grandson. He loved the other ones in the series so I had to get him this one. It's fun and he gets very
involved while watching and participates.",1288656000,,174,4.0
7992146,5,B00009OOFC,"My son loves this DVD!  He was inspired to make his own contraptions, like the dominoes, in which the action of one item caused a reaction in another.  He also wanted to build his own Spyler.  It had some cute stories and at the same time required the viewer to be attentive and observant while watching, in order to pick out what the items that needed to be found.",1252195200,,365,4.260869565217392
7992147,4,B00009OOFC,My son is almost two. I spy are not his favorite but he likes them. I think he liked the Runaway Robot better.,1154390400,,110,3.8260869565217392
7992148,5,B00009OOFC,"This, along with the other iSPY DVDs, is a well-made and welcomed issue.  The DVD is very high quality and very much in line with the  HBO TV children's series of the same name. I would recommend it for  any parent looking for a ""mobile"" version for their child!",1124582400,2,262,4.3061224489795915
7992149,5,B00009OOFC,"This I Spy dvd, and the other one in the series, are aimed at 2 year olds to 6 year olds (plus or minus).  There are a lot of junk kid videos on the market.  this definitely is not one of them.  it is based on the i spy books.  there are lots of colorful and interesting objects on the screen to look at, and several levels in which kids can play the game (solving problems)  -- including a very difficult ""super challenger"" game in each episode. The language is unoffensive, the main values illustrated are cooperation, friendship, and sharing.  Each dvd has six episodes, divided into three sets of two.  The dvd could be improved by making it possible to play all 6 episodes sequentially.  but that is a minor glitch.  I have a 3 year old and a seven year old.  both consistently find something of interest in it to watch.  It is my three year old's favorite video.",1071273600,15,868,4.329192546583851
