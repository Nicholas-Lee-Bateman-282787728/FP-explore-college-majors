7863955,3,6304190395,"I was pretty disapointed in this item. The title claims the VHS has ""The Snow Queen"", ""The Wild Swans"", and ""Alice and the Mystery of the Third Planet"". Unfortunately the only one actually on the VHS was Alice and the Mystery of the Third Planet.",1285027200,,246,4.488888888888889
7863956,5,6304190395,"I remember this anime from my own childhood, its a story about the daughter of a zoo manager/ exobiologist called Alice who travels to the third planet off Aldebaran to find many interesting and novel animals for  the zoo.  One of the most memorable is the twoheaded  ""Talkingbird"" who says ""Talkingbird is clever and  wise""(I'm not sure about the exact translation in this version - this  is just what I remember) but soon the bird starts to talk about the  original three astronauts and an interesting story soon unfolds as they go  to find out about it, with shady characters on their tracks they find  jewel-covered turtoises and flowers which record and display their  surroundings... All great stuff. A memorable story and one of the best  soviet animation films, worth a watch  to anyone interested in what kind of  animation was created behind the Iron Curtain. The story is based on a  children's story by Kir Bulytchev and he actually wrote seven or more  stories, its just a pity they didn't animate the rest I guess. Hopefully  someone will pick up the yarn, RTBS.",954374400,5,1076,4.771739130434782
