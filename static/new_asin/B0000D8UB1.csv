8000087,5,B0000D8UB1,"A wealth of information is provided on the Grappling aspects of Chin-Na.  The instruction is detailed and the material is easy to follow (so long as you have a willing partner).  My only criticism is that the application of techniques is direct and does not incorporate Chin-na striking or distractionary measures which can be very helpful in applying grappling techniques.  Still, I really liked the material and highly recommend it.",1224806400,,434,5.171428571428572
