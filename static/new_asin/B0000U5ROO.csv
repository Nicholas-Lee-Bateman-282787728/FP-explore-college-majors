8003221,2,B0000U5ROO,When it had came out i couldn't wait to buy them but after i watch it. It was awful! These are not the orginal at all. They sound so horrible! Don't get me wrong I love the care bears but these are fake!,1128038400,2,203,3.744186046511628
8003222,3,B0000U5ROO,"this is a great box set for any care bear fan..it has all the better classic episodes however it isn't an ""amazon"" exclusive..i got mine elsewhere for cheaper and no shipping. i would definatly recommend this. some of the episodes are a tad scary for younger children but not to bad to where they wouldnt enjoy them. i thought this was a great investment. Hours of fun..and it has all the shows that the smaller invididual dvds have so it is a better value.",1106092800,2,457,4.4523809523809526
8003223,4,B0000U5ROO,I thought the point of buying dvds is that they hold up under use unlike vhs.  I was informed recently that yes dvds do wear out.  I guess that's what we did.  We love these shows!  We watched them way too much.  The dvds don't work anymore. :(  We'll be buying more and hoping that it was a fluke.  It's not the dvd player.  Only these discs that don't work.  I like that they teach lessons in every episode unlike other things that have no educational value what so ever.,1086739200,,473,4.166666666666667
8003224,5,B0000U5ROO,"All three of these dvds are better then the two movies. They each have seven or six seperate ten or fifteen minutes stories on each one. My favorite one is Drab City, which is on Bedtime Stories. There are a total of twenty stories between the three. The three dvd's are also sold seperatly, but this is a better deal. If you like the Care Bears, or have or know a child who adores them then this would be a perfect gift. It's probably also better for parents who don't want to sit through over an hour of a cartoon movie, becuase you could just watch one or two stories, unless you want to watch ah hour, but then you could just watch the dvd in it's entirity.",1077580800,5,661,4.171875
