8617553,5,B00FP7A2FQ,"Lust..Longing...Love.. Life... LORNA! I bought this set, having seen MUDHONEY but without ever having seen Lorna before. I was not disappointed. I am a big Russ Meyer fan and I hardly ever hear anyone talk about Lorna or Mudhoney. These are two of his best films. I was really impressed with the beautiful contrast of the black and white photography in both movies. I could see how much RM self parodies in his later work of his older movies. Fans of BENEATH THE VALLEY OF THE ULTRA-VIXENS will notice the parallels of the opening of LORNA. The dumb husband who studies while his wife is moaning in the bedroom next to him, sexually unsatisfied. Another impressive scene from the beginning of the film is the montage that accompanies Lorn'a inner monologue about her sad disillusionment of sex and love in marriage. The 'Man of God' as the Greek chorus throughout the film is very original and strange. Russ Meyer early films were so much better than the overbaked self parodies Roger Ebert wrote in the 70's... I love those films too like UP! and BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS but I think his films were even better when he wasn't so in on the joke. As for the DVD set, the DVDs were in good shape. No special features besides 4 RM trailers and a written bio... The movies play perfectly but for the price the case and artwork looks sort of looks cheap. In a perfect world Russ Meyer films would have a two disc Criterion Collection release, with a booklet and interviews and commentaries...",1396051200,3,1493,4.595505617977528
