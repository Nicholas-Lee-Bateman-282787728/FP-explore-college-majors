2306534,5,B0009O9KD0,Everyone should purchase Suze Orman's products. She really informs you on what's going on and what you need to do about any given situation!!  Thank you so much Suze!!!!,1291248000,,169,4.827586206896552
2306535,5,B0009O9KD0,"Ms Orman is the best writer for young people just beginning their consuming [and saving] life. I bought this for my two children... and was pleasantly surprised that both seemed to use the step-by-step process to move to the next level.(one read the book, while the other watched the DVD) I am a fan of this writer and would give anything she writes high marks for clarity and direction.  Suze is the best financial writer and her TV shows are also worth my time to watch.",1239753600,3,472,4.488372093023256
2306536,2,B0009O9KD0,"I like Suze Orman, but this was at most entertaining, I probably won't watch it a second time. It didn't really provide me with enough new information on what to do with my finances and now I am $15 further into debt. Save yourself the money and just borrow it from the library.",1223251200,,278,4.264150943396227
2306537,5,B0009O9KD0,"This video was really good. Suze Orman covers the basic problems (low wages, no pensions, high education costs, debt) that young people face in the US today.  Suze gives very good advice for handling these problems. Suze plays the role of motivational speaker in this video, its not entirely about finance.

As cheap as this VHS tape is, I would pick it up if you like Suze and/or are Young Fabulous and Broke.  You will probably not be dissapointed.",1178496000,,450,4.670886075949367
2306538,5,B0009O9KD0,"Wish I had seen this DVD at age 10, Suze's advice applys at any age...Grandparents can take advantage of all these principles and make it work for the future of their children and grandchildren. It shows YF&B, how they can stand on their individual financial strength and stay independent and gain self-esteem.",1171065600,3,310,4.980769230769231
2306539,5,B0009O9KD0,"Suze Orman "" The Young Fabulous & Broke "" DVD Provides basic financial management information for people that are always struggling with bad  money, credit cards management issues. She really motivates people on how to be concious about to create a good income source and how to get rid of the bad spending habits.",1169078400,2,314,4.814814814814815
2306540,3,B0009O9KD0,Suze wrote this follow up piece because some folks found her old advice to be impossible. Having several months of emergency money put aside etc. The notion that someone hungry for job advancement should work 12 hour days and put groceries on their credit cards may also be impossible. It could also backfire when the company you are giving all your time to fails to notice your efforts. I was actually scolded for staying around too long at work even when I wasn't trying to collect overtime. I did learn something about credit scores though.,1142294400,8,543,4.726315789473684
2306541,1,B0009O9KD0,Suze only spreads the lies and misconseptions that the credit card company's want you to believe. Listen to Dave Ramsey instead. Debt is NOT A TOOL!!!! Try living debt free and you will accumulate much more in the way of wealth.,1136851200,10,228,4.585365853658536
2306542,5,B0009O9KD0,"I watched this special on PBS three times and was impressed not only by the amount of information on the show but by her motivational speaking abilities.  A wealth of knowledge for those who need a little direction. She explores many aspects of building financial wealth and security, including credit reports and FICO scores, paying off debt, handling credit cards, etc.  A must see for young people starting out as well as older ones who may have made a few mistakes along the way.",1136332800,16,483,4.738095238095238
8063996,4,B0009O9KD0,Decent financial education video.,1483142400,,33,7.5
8063997,5,B0009O9KD0,A very good guide for people entering the work force to financially plan for the rest of their lives. A good update info for the rapidly changing financial environment.,1452038400,,168,4.827586206896552
8063998,5,B0009O9KD0,I got this for my son and watched it with him. I even learned some things I didn't know! So bottom line is this is good for all ages. The scenarios are for the current times!,1420761600,,174,3.861111111111111
8063999,5,B0009O9KD0,Just like brand new. Played wonderful and fast delivery.,1411948800,,56,5.333333333333333
8064000,5,B0009O9KD0,"I am amazed that in high school, nothing is taught on basic financial management.

I wish I had seen this DVD, or even read her book when I was in 12th grade (or before). Luckily, I had a descent background in finances, but young people, starting college, often do not have the skills they need to make the right decisions for their future.

Suze explains things in a very easy to read fashion. I bought this book for a couple of late twenty something folks I am friends with. It really opened their eyes, and I watched as I started to see them save more money, and realize they didn't need that $40,000 car.

There is so much more to this book, but it has been written in other reviews. Buy one for a young person and change their life. :)",1399593600,,740,4.23404255319149
8064001,5,B0009O9KD0,"I expected to learn alot from this lady and hence why I bought this dvd. But my gosh, I didn't expect to be blown out of my mind!",1391644800,,129,3.642857142857143
8064002,3,B0009O9KD0,"It was okay. Some of the info is out of date, being 2013 now, but most of the advice is still relevant and accurate. The video did not have much about student loans like the book did; I bought the video to show a couple of classes and was disappointed that she jumped around a lot. Some of the audience questions weren't terribly valuable.",1372118400,,339,4.3125
8064003,4,B0009O9KD0,"I got this in the mail, realized it was a VHS tape, and threw it into the donation bin.  I was NOT expecting a VHS! I wanted the book! Oh well. lol",1369612800,,147,3.59375
8064004,4,B0009O9KD0,I enjoyed viewing this CD.  Suze Orman made some great points.  I ordered this especially for my son who has just  completed his college education.,1332547200,,147,4.8
8064005,5,B0009O9KD0,"This is easy to understand, suze explains it well, holds your interest. i bought 1 for me and 1 for my boy. he inherited money and is spending it.

i have an insurance license, so i  understand 401ks, etc... middle age and made some mistakes so watching it was great! lost a job and took another one not in my field. also want my boy to watch it to get his priorities straigt.

i gave it 5 out of 5 stars because it was good, but not as comprehensive as i thought it would be, but then again i hold insurance licenses, and this is supposed to be for the young- but good for beginners or those who have no financial knowlege or middle aged mistake makers. SUze holds your interest!  if there were 4 1/2 out of 5 i would have given it that but its definetly better than 4.

i don't even have a 3 month emergency fund and am trying to get rid of credit debt.

i would recommend this to young people who want to get their priorities straight, reduce debt, or even middle aged people like myself who have made mistakes in finances along the way...",1300492800,,1042,4.159203980099503
