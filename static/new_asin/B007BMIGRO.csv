5073951,5,B007BMIGRO,"I really thoroughly enjoyed this anime, even if the whole set put me back $80. And while I do agree that the series might be a bit slow at the start, it didn't bother me as it was still very entertaining and did pick up soon after the start. It was a great story full of twists, and the unique style of animation was good as well. The soundtrack was especially awesome and added just the right amount of creepiness to the show. It wasn't scary though so if that's what you're looking for then I would look elsewhere. Overall this show is definitely one of top animes I have seen and would definitely recommend it to anybody.",1340668800,,624,4.296610169491525
5073952,5,B007BMIGRO,"Best anime I have ever seen, literally! Yes the beginning is slow but it becomes additive where you want to watch the next episode even when you're done watching the series. The plot follows the manga perfectly and as you watch you have think, whose the real 'monsters' the shikis or the humans?",1339891200,3,295,4.584905660377358
5073953,2,B007BMIGRO,"To start, I completely enjoyed the first part of this series. I mean if I had to rate the first 13/16 episodes it would be a 9 out of 10. But this isn't a series you can really  break into parts, you have to watch the whole thing.

The animation is phenomenal,very  well animated. A lot of frames, rich colors and a maybe, questionable, art style. Characters are a mixed bag. There's so many you can't really root for any particular one and a lot of people end up dyeing. Or turning into vampires. Its really up to the viewer to decide if you like the characters or not, many being either annoying or in the case of the monk, pathetic.

The crux of my problem with this series came near the end, as the show tries to be what people call ""deep"". Not really. They start trying to get you to sympathize  for the shiki, vampires, very, very forcibly. As it didn't come across naturally but rather felt very forced, I kept feeling, this is exactly what the writers want me to feel and came across just feeling weak. How exactly am I suppose to feel bad for murders, shiki, monsters that kill just to sustain there undead life. That is the most selfish thing one could ever do and as such I can't feel anything but disgust for the shiki, I mean really, feel bad, or even question which side is right. Umm, yeahhh, OK. That wouldn't be a problem if the writers didn't completely force you to try and feel bad for them, but playing sad music and, hey, look how very barbaric those evil humans are, killing undead monsters, why they should let them kill the rest of there families and friends. And the little shiki girl, give me a break, she's just a little innocent girl. . . . .  Who's actually not little and has killed countless  people, but I'm suppose to feel bad if she dies because she's little. . . . No. I had to start fast forwarding  because the forced ""poor shiki"" parts just dragged on. Shiki kill people for the first 15 episodes. And I'm suppose to feel bad when they start dieing. If it where better written maybe, deep, no, unless you can justify murder. What could have been and should have been phenomenal was squandered away on weak, poorly written and forced ideology.",1339459200,8,2181,4.367901234567901
5073954,3,B007BMIGRO,"IT's not a bad series, but I have a few problems. First, it's slow starting. It's OK on some things like this but in this case left me cold. I founf myself losing interest which just shouldn't happen if the series is good. The thing that really got me more than anything else was the Blu-Ray DVD combo idea. I can understand how some people might want this so that they can have a Blu-Ray disk and a DVD disk so they can play it in any situation, but this set up adds usually about $10.00 to the cost and, in my case, is just NOT worth it. I don't own a Blu-Ray player yet and the main thing that keeps me from buying one is the way it's been put out. I don't care about ""bells and whistles"", I just looked to find a Blu-Ray player what JUST played Blu-Ray disks! Good luck with that. I found that almost every player I checked out has the built-in idea of ""streaming video"" on it. I have NO desire to stream video over the web at all and this just adds to the cost of the player for me. So when I shop for DVD series I look for NO Blu-Rays AT ALL! The problem I have is that for what I spent for half a season of this series, I could get the whole season in the same package if it was JUST DVD and NOT a combo! I noted that this release is four disks. The first two are standard DVD disks and the second two are Blu-Rays and in all this gives you half the season. If you had four regular DVD disks then the whole seaon would be available and I might have given a better review. But now I don't plan on buying the second set as I have no desire to pay for two disks I'll more than likely never see. This way of trying to get people to pay more for Blu-Rays is a total rip off to me. I plan on NOT buying any more combos if I can help it!!",1338940800,4,1738,3.857541899441341
5073955,5,B007BMIGRO,"I love this anime! It's definitely one of my favorites!

Despite it being one of my favorites; it does have some faults. The series starts off slow. I feel as though the director could not make up his mind with this series either; as in different sections of episodes the plot either slows down or speeds up. It isn't as constant as it should be.

Despite that, this is still a great series. In many episodes I was on the edge of my chair, I love horror anime and this series definitely gave me my fix. The art style is also... rather unique. (The outfits you will see. And the hair. It's pretty glorious.) The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack, are all top notch. Shiki has great characters as well, there are many of them, and each one has their own story. (Which makes the ending just heartbreaking.)

The best part of the series, is that you wonder which side to root for. The humans, or Shiki? The answer seems obvious, but both sides show such barbarianism throughout the series. It's really a toss up.",1338854400,2,1014,4.47027027027027
5073956,1,B007BMIGRO,"Ok firstly, i'm not going to verbally abuse this series because i know there are peoply who will thoroughly enjoy it.

I am a huge fan of horror (especially anime horror) but shiki didn't do it for me.

I found it slow moving, boring, tedious and it wasn't scary or gory in my opinion.

Every so often it would show a grotesquely drawn character for a split second and then i'd have to wait 6 episodes for anything remotely interesting like that to happen again.

I didn't like the art style at all. The hair on pretty much every character set me into extreme fits of annoyance it was that bad.
The characters are boring and live in a boring town etc etc.
If your looking for a chilling psychological tale i would go with higurashi no naku koroni or ghost hound.
If its gore your after then i recommend elfen lied or mnemosyne.
I would pass on this one. if you do feel like you would still like to see it then download the first 5 or so episodes and then make up your mind before you decide to buy.

Catch.",1338854400,6,1006,4.21875
5073957,5,B007BMIGRO,"This is really a great show. It starts out slow but by the 3rd or 4th episode you find yourself at the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next. By the time the last six episodes roll around I found my jaw just dropping.

The soundtrack is quite good and it matches the moods quite well. The art does the trick and they don't pull any punches.

This series has a lot of gore and violence. The emotional dilemmas are intense and the boundaries of right and wrong are definitely blurred. It's one of those shows that will leave you thinking for a while afterwards.

Needless to say, it is an adult show. It's comforting to find an anime like this amidst all the fanservice anime. And best of all, unlike a lot of anime, it has a good ending. Definitely worth a watch!",1338595200,3,781,4.263513513513513
5073958,5,B007BMIGRO,"Shiki,translated in english as ""corpse demon"", begins with a series of mysterious deaths in a tiny rural village called Sotoba. Even though many of the victims display the same mysterious symptoms, the towns doctor can't pinpoint the cause of the deaths. They begin around the time a new family moves into a mansion, overlooking the small town. Unfortunately, many of the townsfolk are too focused on their everyday lives to notice that something strange is going on and for some that mistake proves to be fatal.

The village doctor, Ozaki Toshio, begins searching for the cause of the deaths and eventually discovers that the village is being targeted by undead creatures similar to vampires. Another man,Seishin Muroi, the junior monk of Sobata finds himself torn between two worlds, either of which he may not be able to return from.
At the same time, Natsuno Yuuki, a young man who truly hates life in Sobata discovers the same shocking truths as the doctor and searches desperately for a way to put an end to the threat once and for all.

The animation and soundtrack to this series are amazing. This series is genuinely creepy but so fun to watch. The first few episodes are abit slow but it's a good setup and worth the wait. It's hard not to want to continue on to the next episode to see what happens next.

Themes included are guilt, anger and redemption. I found this anime to be very moving and insightful. I highly recommend everyone check this one out. This series will definately have you asking yourself, ""Who are the real monsters in this story?""

The english dub is very good and the artwork and animation by Studio Daume is awesome.
This is a perfectly spooky series to watch with your significant other.
It's worth owning this one for sure.

5073959,5,B007BMIGRO,"(This review covers the entire series, not just part 1. The ratings regarding content are written from a Christian perspective. I covered topics to the best of my ability.)
This anime is NOT a happy anime. This anime is an incredible, thought-provoking tragedy. I'm not going to recite the plot, since someone else already wrote a synopsis.

Pros:
+ Excellent, Thought-Provoking Storyline
+ Very good Sub and Dub
+ Good Animation Quality
+ Excellent Spooky Soundtrack
+ Ending Left Up To The Audience (much like Code Geass regarding Lelouch)
+ Unexpected Ending

Nuetrals:
= Strange Camera Angles in Animation
= Interesting Animation Style (I enjoyed this)

Cons:
- Slow start
- Fanservice (at least for me)

I would rate this show a high PG-13. There is a LOT of blood and violence. Also, the themes are very scary, as the characters are vampires (this is NOT Twilight). As far as Sub goes, language is mild (a-words, b-words, maybe s-word). The dub doesn't have much (h-word), but I haven't watched much. There is some fanservice (revealing female outfits), as well as unnecessary nudity in the credits. So, if your kid can handle violence and scariness, you've got a winner. There is not much negative religious content, but this show is about vampires, so be aware of that. One vampire asks why God has forsaken her, but then again, normal non-Christian characters in television do that, too. Also, one of the main characters is a Buddhist monk, who writes fiction based on Buddhist/Japanese legends. So, some ""spirits"" are mentioned. Also, the Buddhist monk (who is a writer) shares the Cain and Abel story he had been writing.",1334620800,14,1632,4.923636363636364
5073960,5,B007BMIGRO,"Sotobamura is a small, secluded village where the old customs, such as the burial of the dead, are still practiced. Life in Sotobamura is calm and boring. When three old people die in the outskirts of the village, it is marked down as old age or heatstroke. But when a healthy teenage girl expires, it starts to look like the deaths might be connected. The local doctor, Toshio Ozaki, starts to see a pattern--light anemia followed by sudden and inexplicable death-- and suspects an epidemic. But what sort of disease causes its victims to quit their jobs before dying? And what about those families that disappear in the middle of the night in moving vans?

I've always been partial towards the idea of vampires in stories, but I rarely like the sort of stories that have vampires in them (a contradiction, I know). But Shiki manages to create a excellent atmosphere of creepiness and uncertainty. The story moves on at a rather languid pace, but it is never boring. Shiki has the sort of feeling of a horror movie, but it isn't scary. The vampires are rather pretty, but very creepy.
The story follows a range of characters and not all of them survive, which makes it even more interesting. Shiki is more a story about a village, rather than a character. Not that the characters are unimportant or boring. Most of them are quite likable, which makes their situation a little sad.

I really enjoyed Shiki. But I don't think it is a show for everyone. It's biggest appeal is the atmosphere, and if you don't get drawn into it, then there isn't much left for you. When giving this series a try, you should watch at least 3-4 episodes before passing judgment. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!

PS Shiki is based on a book by Fuyumi Ono, who also wrote the source material for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-Hunt/dp/B003SPDSAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost Hunt</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Twelve-Kingdoms/dp/B0021BSOHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Twelve Kingdoms</a>&nbsp;anime.

5073963,5,B007BMIGRO,"One of the best vampire anime and a good representation of the the genre as a hole. The animation is good with lots of style ( the hair is really is fun). The sound is fitting and never feels out of Place. Also there are a lot of Characters but the ones that matter are great.

5073965,5,B007BMIGRO,"This anime is one of the most engrossing, thought provoking, beautiful and frightening shows I have ever had the pleasure of watching. It's very difficult to associate vampires with true terror these days, but somehow Shiki masterfully pulls it off, leaving me with chills episode after episode. The characters are (mostly) incredibly likable, the artwork is stunning, yet creepy all at the same time. The pacing is perfect. Every episode seems to answer a question, slowly unraveling a bit of the mystery, and at the same time poses a new one. This anime will leave you thinking about it long after you turn off your blu-ray player. It kind of has a slow build for the first half of the series (don't get me wrong, a lot happens and it's very interesting) but once you reach the last six or seven episodes, where the show really shines, everything in the little isolated village of Sotoba completely hits the fan in the most grotesque way. It will blur the lines between right and wrong and make you question if you picked the right side to root for.

If you enjoy horror and an excellent story, good characters and don't mind a minimal amount of fanservice, I would highly recommend picking Shiki up. After the first three episodes, I was hooked and finished it in two days. It is a must watch.",1394064000,,1296,4.6347826086956525

5073967,5,B007BMIGRO,"Oh Shiki, how I loveth thee.

I bought this one on a whim, never watched it before, but felt I would like it.

I was not disappointed. I am pretty inclined to believe the pilot episode makes or breaks a series. Not in an overall sense of the term, but rather, in relation to viewers' attention. With that said, this has kept my attention.

It's a watered-down genre, but Shiki kills it nonetheless. If you like anything even close to this anime description, you can feel safe buying it knowing it won't just sit on your shelf and suffer the fate of sad DVDs that never get rewatched.

The BD menu is even pretty nice. Nothing extravagant but more elegant than most.",1392681600,,665,4.426229508196721
5073968,5,B007BMIGRO,"I actually purchased this over a year ago, and I finally got the time to marathon the series.  I have to say it's remarkably deep and thoughtful.  Honestly the advertisements don't do the series justice.  The plot is that in a remote Japanese village, mysterious deaths are occurring.  No one knows why, and as the mystery unravels, creatures as old as time are to blame.
Those of you familiar with the old Salem's Lot TV series, and re-release a few years ago, it's much like an Anime version of that.  However, Far, FAR, better.  The way they portray the monsters, is very unique from other horror stories.  They humanize them in a very good way.  Also give you many perspectives on the main characters.  I simply love the cast of characters.  If you want an extremely action packed series, you probably might be a little let down.  It's more a horror dramatic series.  Overall, it was just a treat for me.  I actually hate myself for having this on my watching pile for so long without going to it.  I think it's very shelf worthy, and any Horror fan should own this series.",1392076800,,1077,4.512953367875648
5073969,5,B007BMIGRO,"Shiki has great animation and was one of the more recent anime series released in North America. In terms of story it wasn't as I expected at all. I mean from the description of what Shiki was about it truly didn't reveal too much. Still after watching have to say it is better go in not knowing a lot since it will give the series much more impact once you do see it.

The more episodes the series went through the more the causes of the disappearances of the villagers in the series became more obvious. There just seemed to be something at work that had to do with the people starting to apparently begin dying from anemia. The only real conclusion was vampires. Still the good thing is that the Shiki anime series spun a new take of the legendary vampire virus. In that respect, Shiki was quite surprising in the fact that even though it is a vampire story the concept it created in such a way that it comes out being unique and different. It is one story where a new take on the legendary vampires exists.

There are also other sub-types within the Shiki so that makes things rather different. The anime series slowly unfolds and mostly we see the lives of humans everyday which are pretty normal other than the fact they are very close-knit and stuck in a rut in most of their lives until they become Shiki. Once Shiki they realize that their lives were in a place that they always wanted or in some cases individuals realize that the isolated village was in reality like their cage. It took the arrival of the Shiki for many to realize just how trapped they were. Still others furiously fight against this invasion because they accept their lives as it is.

All the characters offer various perspectives. The fact that they do causes viewers to feel attached to them and their fates.

The voice acting that best stood out would be the voice actor of Seishin who is voice actor John Burgmeier . You get the feeling of his sense of divided loyalty to his village of his new Shiki friends, Sunako. A divided loyalty dilemma experienced by the entire village too. The voice actress for Sunako, Cherami Leigh, really hit it perfectly since Sunako is a symbol of being a young girl but at the same time a dangerous creature.

*Note saw the series in English Dubbed so highlight the English voice actors for that reason*

All the perfect balance of unique story, developed characters that anyone can easily fall in love with, and amazing voice acting makes Shiki a good addition to your anime collection for 2013.",1391212800,,2513,4.524229074889868

Favorite animes of mine in the spooky arena are Monster, Another, Ghost Hound, Higurashi no naku koro ni, Mirai Nikki, Death Note, Ghost Hunt (not really a favorite as it's not scary to me, but got better towards the end), Paranoia Agent (also not a favorite but worth watching)",1360195200,,628,4.517543859649122
5073977,5,B007BMIGRO,"Please consider this review alongside Part 2. The two parts are not stand-alone.

There is so much to be said about Shiki that perhaps I should answer my rhetorical title question. The answer is, mostly no. If you want to watch a story about villagers heroically banding together and standing firm against an outside threat, this is not for you.

Shiki is a horror story. Bad things happen to nice people. Also to not-so-nice people, and to people that aren't really paying attention.

OK, trying to stay spoiler-free: the writers play with the question of what would happen if vampires actually existed in the modern world? What would they try to do, if they had been around long enough to get wealthy and be able to fund a project. What would the people around that area do? How would they figure out what was going on? Would they react like story-tale heroes, or just regular shmoes? What would be the moral effect of resisting the vampires?

One of the joys of Shiki is that almost nothing goes down the way that you, brought up on tales of Van Helsing staking Drac yet again, would expect to happen in a vampire yarn. Don't get attached to any one character. But you will really be looking forward to Part 2 to find out what happens!

This limited edition product included a box that is designed to hold both parts, which is an excellent idea as far as I am concerned. Other features include a commentary by some of the English voice cast, giving an insight as to how they found the series and the characters.

Picture quality: Excellent.
Music: Generally good and appropriate. This is subjective: some viewers may find some of the music intrusive, but it is ""standard anime"" levels for me.

5073980,5,B007BMIGRO,"Shiki is dark, unforgiving & tragic.

People are dying left & right, dropping like flies, and if they're not already dead when you first see them, then it's still pretty much a guarantee that they're on the ""To-Do"" list.
The main cast is huge, however that doesn't simply mean anyone's going bye-bye when their time is up.
This series is one giant conflict of interests, from the element of survival, to more complex moral issues.
As more of the village's dead rise up as Shiki, they each must continue on, adapting to their newly acquired way of life; while the rest of the village slowly descends into depression, denial & insanity.

Shiki is one hell of a guilty pleasure to watch, with a nice bow on top.

5073981,4,B007BMIGRO,"Dark, eerie, scary...these are are words that some have used to describe Fuyumi Ono's horror novel ""Shiki"".

A story that would lead to a manga adaptation featuring artwork drawn by Ryu Fujisaki and serialized in the magazine ""Jump SQ"" from December 2007-2011, the popularity of the series would lead to an anime TV series in 2010 produced by anime studio, Daume (best known for ""Onegai Teacher!"").  The series also caught a lot of attention when Japanese rock star Gackt announced he would voice one of the characters in the series.

VIDEO:

""Shiki"" is presented in 1080p High Definition and the anime studio Daume has done a wonderful job in character design and art backgrounds.  Typically anime studios are on a time restraint and are working on multiple anime series at a time but Daume is one of the few studios that tend to put all their focus onto a single series at a time.

The art backgrounds are lush and beautiful, homes and overall village structures are well-detailed and the character designs are actually quite stylish and with colors that support the darker anime feel but also a colors that look absolutely vibrant at times.

With that being said, the anime series still has a softness (that most anime TV series has) and one should not expect OVA or film quality type of anime, but still this is a series that looks fantastic with its detail of structures and interior of homes.  ""Shiki"" definitely looks very good!

AUDIO:

""Shiki"" is presented in English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and Japanese DolbyTrue HD 2.0.  This is an anime series that primarily focuses on dialogue and if there are action sequences, the action is quick.  But the series does make up in ambiance.  You'll hear like insects flying, heartbeats, wind, cars passing by and everything that one can expect in a rural village.  If anything, the series utilizes a spooky ambiance and sound effects to freak viewers out.  The English soundtrack has more dynamic range but when it comes to voice acting, both are well-done.

The biggest standout for this series is the music. The musical soundtrack by Yasuharu Takanashi is fantastic, especially the opening and ending theme of the series.

Subtitles are in English.

JUDGMENT CALL:

There have been a few dark, creepy anime that has made it to America within the last five years.  And similar to the United States, even Japan has had its share of anime series incorporating vampires to a storyline.

But what makes ""Shiki"" so unique is that it doesn't retain the banality of the usual vampire storyline.  This is not a series about a group of teenagers unleashing a counterattack against the vampires, nor is this a storyline about a vampire or human falling in love.  This is a story about a rural Japanese town in which the vampires plan to eradicate all humanity and literally turn everyone into a vampire.

Each time we were introduced to a character, you would expect that this character would be a main character in the storyline, but beginning with the first episode, viewers quickly learn that each character is essentially going to be a victim.  In some way, it reminded me of ""Boogiepop Phantom"", a darker anime series from 2000 that seemed every character introduced, their livelihoods were futile.

But what makes the anime series work is that we get to meet these villagers, learn of their quirks and if anything, feel comfortable with each and everyone of them...that is until the okiagari begin to target them.

The same can be said with ""Shiki"" as the townspeople think that people are dying of an epidemic, while very few people suspect that a new family that has moved to the area is responsible.  And sure enough, when people start to see old friends who have died, walking around, what do you do?  How you can fight against these reborn monsters?

The first half of the series focuses on the deaths of many in the village and the discovery by Natsuno Yuuki, Toshio Ozaki and brother and sister, Kaori and Akira Tanaka discovering that there is no epidemic but deaths caused by the okiagari (vampire).  And to make things worst, there appears to be no defense against them.  They keep rising and they are growing by the numbers.  Also, it doesn't help that there are specialized vampires such as Tatsumi who can withstand the sunlight and literally use his charm to get people to let him into their homes and thus leading to a person's quick death.

But of course, with everything looking quite dark and the viewer is left wondering if certain characters are going to survive, one can only hope there is a glimmer of light that these humans can find a way to fight back. And for that, let's hope that things get even better in the second half of the series.

As for the Blu-ray release, Daume, an anime studio who usually doesn't rush into anime production has once again done a fantastic job with this series.  With most TV series, many anime studios are typically hampered by multiple projects they have to get to a television studio but with Daume, one of the few that tends to focus on a series and thus dedicates its staff into making wonderful looking anime series.  Granted, the setting is the country and a lot of the backgrounds one will see are trees, fields, forests, etc.  But they manage to put quite a bit of detail on their background art and also on the actual character designs which are quite stylish.  Especially with the combination of dark to vibrant colors that really pop on Blu-ray.  The voice acting is well-done on both lossless soundtracks and there are a few audio commentary tracks included.

Overall, It's been a long while since I have watched an anime series so dark, eerie and where situations are so unexpected.  And from this first half of ""Shiki"", all I can say is that... I'm loving every minute of it!

Recommended for anime fans who like dark and eerie anime!",1352332800,,7069,4.835833333333333

5073983,5,B007BMIGRO,"Shiki, aka Vampires, are taking over a village in the mountains. The village is cut off from civilization, and a bit behind the times. A family called the Kirishiki's move into town. At the same time the village experiences a long series of deaths. Only a few residents actually start to catch on to the fact that the Kirishiki's are behind it. This anime has everything beautiful art, amazing soundtrack, likable characters, and a very engrossing story. I don't want to say too much in fear of spoiling the fun, but I will say that Shiki stands at the top of the horror anime genre. Definitely check it out.",1348963200,2,608,4.587155963302752
5073984,1,B007BMIGRO,"STORY/PACING/CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT 3 out of 10

Let me start off by saying this was one anime I was dying to see. I watch alot of anime. I own about 300 boxsets, so Shiki seemed like something different to change up the onslaught of ninjas and giant robots. After I purchased the show i ran home to watch. I watched the first ep and thought ""uhhhhhhh. Well that wasn't very good. But its only the first ep. It has to get better."" Sadly it didnt. This show is SLOW. I mean VERY VERY SLOOOOOOW. But thats not the problem. I love slow shows. Monster<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monster-Box-Set-1/dp/B002N1AEY6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monster: Box Set 1</a>&nbsp;is my all time favorite anime and it is very slow. The problem with Shiki is that it tries to pass itself off as a horror mystery but with little horror and absolutely no mystery. Their is an ""epidemic"" going around that is killing members of the town. The problem with this is that the watcher knows that its not an epidemic and that its vampires killing everyone. This would have been somewhat successful if they didn't tell you it was vampires right away and ruin the mystery. Another thing that i did not like was the intros of all the characters. EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER gets a subtitle telling who they are. Even characters who do not effect the story. Example: ""Blah Blah : Nurse"" ""Blah Blah: Another minor characters step father"". Then the characters would die within about 5 seconds. Not 5 seconds as a term. LITERALLY 5 seconds. I only got through 8 episodes before i decided to sell the boxset.

ANIMATION 4 out of 10

The animation quality is bad. Very Very bad. It is a slow frame rate and features jerky images when the images are moving at all. Most of the time is still images with the camera panning. They use limited animation like all anime but take it to a new level. The character designs are annoying. Which just sounds like I'm knit picking but they are distracting. Certain characters have cat like ears on their hair for no reason. Others have all blacked out eyes that are kinda creepy but more distracting.

DUB/SUB 10 out of 10

The one thing that I give this show is an AMAZING english dub. I normally watch everything in Japanese but switched it over to english at about episode 4 because i wasn't enjoying the show so i figured i'd give it a shot. The American voice actors did an amazing job!! WOW! I noticed i even started to enjoy it a little more once i started to watch in English.

OVERALL: PASS",1348444800,6,2534,4.695945945945946
5073985,3,B007BMIGRO,"Shiki: Part 1 is an interesting anime that starts out slow and continues to be slow throughout the first 12 episodes, which is what I'm going to base this review on.

Generally I enjoy slow building stories and finely woven arcs that take time to subtlety bloom, but a painful amount of time is wasted on the lives and deaths of less than minor characters in this anime. There are a couple of points during the 12 episodes where it appears to pick up the pace for an episode, only to fall back into a portrayal of life in a small town. Which is ultimately what Shiki: Part 1 is; a study on how people in a small town react when neighbors and school mates begin dying and how they deal with the resulting grief. There is a certain amount of fear that is mixed in as well, but it never really seems to affect the villagers, except for part of one episode. You do have a handful of characters that figure out what is going on, but they mostly spend their time running around in circles.

As far as this having vampires in it, don't expect much from the vampire end of things, they could have easily been replaced by zombies or a bad flu (that could raise the dead). In fact, don't expect much more than the interrelationships between various characters that may very well annoy the hell out of you, or that you more than likely will never see again.

Now, I must add that I am watching Part 2, but only because I purchased the two volumes together. If I had not ordered it at the same time as Part 1, I would not have purchased the second half. This is by far no ""Elfen Lied"", nor is it even a ""When They Cry""...but it is interesting, as well as being a very serious and mature anime, in a plain bagel kind of way.",1348012800,,1711,4.210365853658536
5073986,5,B007BMIGRO,"In this Creepy and a little scary Anime a small town has been taken over by Vampires and not by the ones you see in Twilight(Movies) but Creepy, undead, Blood sucking fiends.  This anime is classified as a Horor anime and I would agree.  Not many jumpy parts but defintly creep dramadic parts.  I would almost say this anime is in the same as the Classic Movie ""Salem's Lot""(Sp?).

The Drawing of this anime seems to add to how creepy this series is.

The voice acting dose need a little help but other then that this series is enjoyable.",1347840000,,538,4.393939393939394
5073987,1,B007BMIGRO,"Positive:
(1.) Graphics and storyline creativity began to show a little improvement about halfway through the fourth disk.

Negatives:
(1.) 99% of the graphics consists of flat, poorly painted, 2D unchanging backgrounds (e.g. same painted trees; same painted building) with no 3D depth or shadowing or anything that resembles a basic definition of life - movement. Well sometimes there is a movement such as the mouth of humans and any critters that are tossed into scenes to provide a nonhuman living, breathing entity. Or, maybe an eye blink or two. And, of course, that cheap animation technique of stilted walking.
(2.) Dialogue resembles grade school level conversations.
(3.) Ripoff script, of the currently in vogue, vampire theme - nothing imaginative. Vampires take over a community as a safe haven and, of course, fresh blood. Filled with overly stereotyped characters -  nothing imaginative.
(4.) The Japanese film industry with it's perverted suggestive animated nubile young females with short skirts and large boobs are overly represented in this animation suggesting that the male dominated Japanese film industry and culture in general is in need of some serious psychological help.
(5.) Hours of very slow moving script with highly redundant scenes makes ff a useful time saver. English voicing was poorly chosen; did not fit the animated characters accurately. Japanese language with English subs fit better.
(6.) Blu-ray was a waste of money as the scene image quality made Blu-ray a pointless endeavour. Like putting lipstick on a pig, but it's still a ...",1347235200,2,1576,5.274900398406374

Some time passed and I bought the first part of this anime that i (assumingly) had never seen before on a whim. Now for the kicker... I popped the first disc in my player and low and behold it was the anime that i had written off after one episode! I sit here and type this review after watching it through to the end... Fantastic, outstanding, phenominal, incredible. Only a few words to describe this truly masterful piece of anime. If you enjoy a bit of horror, supernatural beings, and a twisted story, then this is the right anime for you. Don't worry about the negative reviews by people on this show... they wouldn't know what great anime really is if it bit them on the @ss!",1346889600,7,846,4.29375

I personally love this anime and how it keeps you in suspense and keeps you guessing what happens next. Both English and Japanese versions go good together.
