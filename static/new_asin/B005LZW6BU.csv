4831057,2,B005LZW6BU,What else can be said about all of the 1313 movies. They all look alike and they all suck. Some good eye candy is all the movies have to offer.,1420070400,,143,3.8
4831058,1,B005LZW6BU,"Wow, who knew that a bunch of gorgeous young men running around scantily clad could be so BORING?  Well, folks, here it is!  Another reviewer here wrote that this was a 20-minute short extended to a 90-minute movie.  That is spot on!  Add to that twenty minutes lots of lingering scenes that have no purpose except to give you time to perhaps refresh your drinks or go to the bathroom without having to hit 'pause.'  I think my favorite was when the so-called grad student, researching extraterrestrial contact, did his ""research"" by randomly walking around what is presented as Roswell, New Mexico (whether it is or isn't doesn't matter).  No recorder, no pad and pencil, not even a backpack, he's just walking around town waiting, apparently, for aliens to come jumping out at him from behind a tree.  YAWN!",1419638400,,809,4.776978417266187
4831059,1,B005LZW6BU,"I have seen several in this 13 13 series a d every one of these films are the same. A group of boys around 21 drive at a fancy house in LA and alone walk around the house. They call for there friends they look for people they are there for a party  or reunion, or a UFO invasion it doesn't matter. There is no story just shirtless boys walking around then it ends. Thats it thats is all this series offers. Now the interesting part; u find your self trying to figure out what really is going on, why dose this exist, is this a gay porn with the sex cut out or is this a way some Hollywood Producer picks up young guys? I can see it now some guy who produced one film in the 80s saying ""hey you come for a test screening at my house when everyone leave you blow me and ill put you on the cover of this pointless film. Why what and why and all you need to know. This and the others all play out like a gay casting call no boy wears a shirt EVER. and nothing happens EVER! Soon you just get sick off even looking at the boys because there as empty ad boring as these films.",1404864000,,1070,3.8858447488584473
4831060,2,B005LZW6BU,"Although I have only seen this film once, it feels like I have seen it thirteen times as we see the same event (only with different people) over and over. To quote the great Yogi Berra, It's deja vu all over again...and again...and again...and again... and again... and again.............",1394150400,,288,4.8979591836734695

4831062,5,B005LZW6BU,"The extraordinary depth of this modern-day masterpiece cannot be overstated. Themes of the unrequited youth in modern society, emotional alienation, the tragedy of prestige, and mysterious personal turmoil pervade subtly, yet powerfully, this moving instant classic. Dare I say this could be one of the greatest movies-- no, it is THE greatest movie-- ever to grace the screen? The audience is held spellbound by the suspense of the greatest actors of our age as they traipse hypnotically through the mysterious yet well-lit mansion in their underwear- black and/or white. And then again. Will it happen to yet another unsuspecting shirtless nubile youth? Yes, it does. Again and again, allowing the emotional suspense to crescendo. Calls of 'Adam?'...  ""Adam?""... ""Adam?""...  chillingly pierce the soul of the audience before the revealing surprise climax at the masterpiece's end. Can Adam successfully overcome the challenges of what it means to be a man in this demasculinating culture? And what role will the mansion- a character in its own right- play in the thrilling climax? Will the mysterious female inhabitant ever be able to escape the chains of her own fate? And just who is Adam- really?  I dare not reveal too much in this review so that you can experience the magic for youself. One must truly watch this film- not with one's eyes or using one's brain, but by using one's gut, or perhaps groin, in order to appreciate the deep beauty that is 1313: UFO Invasion.",1372896000,28,1477,5.045081967213115
4831063,1,B005LZW6BU,"B-Movie Queen Monique Parent deserves better than this, and so do you.  Yet another in the series of films featuring young men in their underwear walking around endlessly in a Malibu mansion and taking showers, with minimal dialogue, story or action.  There are no UFOs or invasions in this bore.  Save your money and skip this.",1353196800,5,328,4.821428571428571
4831064,1,B005LZW6BU,"84 minutes of nothing! That is what this movie is all about. Some movies you wait to see what is going to happen next, 1313 is....will something ever going to happen next?! The only thing I can take from this movie is that a bunch of cute well fit guys parading in a huge hose in white underwear looking for each other.... "" Adam... Adam... where are you Adam? "" It is probably the only line these guys needed to memorize to play this movie. They were supposed to be in new Mexico but they didn't even bother to try not to film the palm trees of Malibu California. Even a voyeur will get bored with this movie. I can't believe I wasted my time watching this awfulness. I guess what kept me going was the hope that nothing could be so bad and something will ever happen in this total flop. Beware!!!",1349222400,4,798,4.222222222222222
4831065,1,B005LZW6BU,"Are these people serious? everything this movie tries to be falls laughably short! Very short! It tries to be suspenseful..... NOT.  It tries to be Erotic.....NOT....it tries to have a plot line and acting....double NOT! It's like they went to the local high school or jr college and held casting calls 4 decent looking guys who wanted to be in a movie......the acting is beyond horrible and the budget is so low they use the same house on all of these 1313 movies......they could at least show an ass cheek here and there or even a female boob......SAVE YOUR MONEY AND YOUR TIME! And just see a gay porn for free online..... It gives u what you want and u feel 1,000 times more satisfied in the end!",1341360000,5,700,4.46875
4831066,1,B005LZW6BU,"I am normally lenient with indie films, but this is absolutely awful.
There are only about 12 minutes of viable action and 8 minutes of plot necessary to carry the story.
A waste of Netflix time -- even free, it wasn't worth it.
I guess it takes place in Roswell, California, judging by everything from the opening to the closing.
It opens in an obviously Californian McMansion by the sea (difficult to find either seacoast or McMansions in Roswell, New Mexico -- trust me on this). Accoutrements like a tree trunk wearing red leather stilletto boots, nautical knick-knacks, etc. don't exactly match the purported location. Neither do seaside caves, palm trees, road signs leading to California locations, or all-Californian license plates.
I'm about to tell you the whole story. COMPLETE SPOILER ALERT.
A guy with over-developed lats but otherwise okay body walks into McMansion and says something like ""Guys? Where are you?"" This continues for about 6 minutes, then he is suddenly strapped onto a bed, struggling. He is suddenly free and walking, zombielike, down the stairs. Cut to opening credit. We are now at 7 minutes, and it could have taken just about 2.50 or maybe 3.00 to create the atmosphere.
Cut to a Our Hero, a guy in ugly shorts walking into same house. He looks around, proud of himself for renting such a great place for himself and his friends, he goes to the fridge, opens it up, sees beer and says ""This just gets better and better."" Then he looks out the window at the ocean and says ""This just gets better and better.""
A female real estate agent comes into the scene, they chat, he gives her a check, and she tells him her office is the last room at the end of the hallway. During the chat, he says he's a Xenobiologist or something (he studies the way humans and other species interact.). The agent expresses curiosity, but with one of those knowing looks that make you say ""She must be an alien doing the exact same thing!""
Some of the male's friends show up. They strip down to tighty whiteys and jump in the pool The Agent watches from above. The guys get out, tan a little, then one stays out on the patio, one gets a beer, and Our Hero goes to Roswell, where he does not meet with anyone. He drives around California and magically ends up in some sea caves, then goes home. But while this is going on, back at McMansion, his friends one by one wind up strapped on a bed in their underwear (some undies change from white to brown. All undies are apparently, um, well-stuffed, but everything is opaque from the front so don't get all lecherous). Some get injections and some apparently don't, (they all did, it turns out), then they are suddenly free and walking, zombielike, down the stairs. It takes a phenomenally long time to do this for each character, and there is little else going on. Occasionally it cuts to Our Hero in Ersatz Roswell, but when I say it shows nothing, I kid you not.
One of Our Hero's buddies (the one who got the beer) has a conversation with The Agent, who zaps him, ties him to a bed, and tells him she is an alien, and is extracting stuff from his friends and they are all dead or dying.
Our Hero comes home, and The Agent zaps him and tells him that she is trying to reverse the process in him. Shades of Maltese Falcon! He's an alien xenobiologist! So he slashes his own throat. The end.
This was horrible. Really horrible. It's listed on Netflix as GL, but there's no sex. Thank goodness. Any film that makes constipation a viable 90-minute alternative to watching TV does not need to ruin the concept of sex.
It never does say what happens to the bodies of the young men. They just disappear.",1334102400,19,3654,4.521148036253776
4831067,1,B005LZW6BU,"I should have read Sandy's review above before paying to see this terrible movie. Not even all the cute guys in underwear could save this movie. If anyone had said Adam one more time I would have thrown my laptop.
