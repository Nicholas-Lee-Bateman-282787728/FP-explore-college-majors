2651697,5,B000I2JDD0,"What a great documentary. You could tell it was done on a shoe-string budget, but a true labor of love.  The old early 80s footage is great quality, and it was fun to see some of the early stuff I had only read about, like the start of the Freebirds-Von Erich feud. I was thoroughly entertained by this dvd and have no complaints. The interviews with Bill Merce,Marc Lowrance and Gary Hart were very informative. These were guys that were along for the whole ride. The documentary shows the quick rise to the top of World Class, and details why it was so successful. But the 2nd half of the DVD steals the show. What a tragedy the Von Erichs went through. Some one points out that 18 of the stars of World Class during it's heyday have all passed on, and most of the deaths weren't pretty. Drug Overdoses, suicides, and murders. Sad, sad Stuff. I highly reccomend this DVD for any 80s wrestling fan, it is absolutely jam packed with great footage and tons of behind the scenes stories.",1169510400,11,985,4.441988950276243

2651815,5,B000I2JDD0,"After purchasing the World Class Championship Wrestling video library in 2006, WWE decided to release a 2-disc DVD set about the famed Texas wrestling promotion. But before the video library sale Big Vision entertainment released this documentary directed by Brian Harrison who gives us a very detailed and dark look at the good, the great, the bad and the tragedy that took place during the spectacular run of WCCW. Its told by various stars of the promotion, like Gary Hart, Bill Mercer, Skandar Akbar, Kevin Adkisson (Kevin Von Erich) and others.

Kevin is the main focus for information throughout the dvd, especially when it comes to the deaths of his 4 brothers, the good parts are too many to mention but I did enjoy how they talked about in detail the deaths of stars like Bruiser Brody (just a sad story), how popular their show was, the fame of the Sportatorium and how the building was so hot during the TV tapings. Other great parts were the Gino Hernadez, Chris Adams and David Von Erich praising and the deaths (which all were sad too).

Brian the director was a huge fan of WCCW from an early age and it shows as he treats this great yet sad tale with the right amount of respect and care. There's some good wrestling clips throughout the bio, along with some great music namely from Stevie Ray Vaughn. Even as a non-wrestling fan one could enjoy this as a stand alone presentation, but for wrestling fans this is one DVD you can't afford to miss. Its a real, honest and sad telling of how one company rose to great heights, only for tragedy after tragedy to engulf the company and swallow it whole. **** out of 4 stars.",1348444800,3,1635,4.557823129251701

2651819,5,B000I2JDD0,"""Heroes of World Class"" is an honest look back at the rise & fall of World Class Championship Wrestling. No stone is left unturned in the story of Fritz Von Erich and the old Dallas wrestling territory of the 70s & 80s. Fritz took his sons into the business, made them national stars on cable tv, then saw them fall to death one by one until only one (Kevin) survived. It's the story of innovative tv production which put their shows miles ahead of the other Promoters (including the McMahons). More than that it's a look at an era, the 1980s, when the highs and lows took people on a roller coaster ride like no other. There were crowds of thousands cheering the action, and the joy and fun that the wrestlers experienced are evident in this dvd. However, Drugs and Money and no sense of a Future led to a tragic ending for many of the people involved, and cost some their lives. Wrestling fans of that era will know the names in this documentary, but fans and non-fans alike, after seeing this dvd, will know the human toll. A fine film about wrestling, but a great film for anyone to savor.",1317600000,,1093,4.389162561576355
2651820,4,B000I2JDD0,"For the record, I've been a rasslin' fan for nearly 30 years, and was fortunate enough to receive World Class wrestling from Texas where I was living during the promotion's heyday. It was fascinating to watch their dramatic rise, and unbearable to at first witness, and later simply read or hear about, their Shakespearean demise.
  I'll assume you're pretty familiar with the goings-on in WCCW if you're reading this, so i'll just mention a few things that may or may not sway you to purchase this documentary.
  First off, be aware that like most of the old territorial wrestling programs, the WWE and Vince McMahon own all of WCCW's viewable product-so don't expect to be rewarded with classic matches. That's the one, and ONLY, part of the WWE's doc on this territory that's an improvement over this humble, direct, and far more factual effort. In other words, unless you want to know what John Cena or Santino Marella thought about the Von Erich tragedies, buy the WWE's show, toss the documentary part, and keep the matches. Then, purchase this one for 1/4 of the price, and listen to the voices of the guys who were there-most haunting, yet oddly uplifting of all being that of the lone Von Erich brother survivor, Kevin Atkisson.
  Even after hearing him explain how he faced such unspeakable horrors within his own close-knit family, I'm still at a loss for why this man isn't comatose from record-breaking doses of anti-depressents floating through his system. Kevin, the oldest of the brothers, was undoubtedly crushed when his young brother Jack, age 7, was accidentally elecrocuted to death in 1959.
  However, father Fritz Von Erich (Jack Atkisson) had prepared his boys to be tough, so bros Kevin, David, Kerry, Mike, and later Chris bonded even more strongly than ever. After each man, a few years apart in age, played high school sports and became very well known amongst locals due to their famous father, they would quickly find themselves sucked into the pro wrestling world-or more factually, were pushed into it by father Fritz. After all, Fritz owned World Class wrestling, a small, unassuming, but up-and-coming territory operating out of a dump called the Sportatorium outside of Dallas. The boys were athletic, young, good looking, and charismatic. The rest, alas, is history.",1301097600,2,2302,4.9765625
2651821,3,B000I2JDD0,"It was somewhat interesting, but I had already watched the WWE's version and even though I hate to admit it.  I found the WWE's version better.",1293321600,,143,4.5
2651822,5,B000I2JDD0,"If you like wrestling then buy this DVD. If you are from Dallas area buy this DVD. The Von Erich/Freebird feud was the best in wrestling history, their matches are historic. I grew up watching this stuff and I remember everything that happens in the DVD. JUST BUY IT. Devastation Inc. was also very funny stuff. Thanks Kevin, for putting this out.",1290902400,,347,4.612903225806452
2651823,4,B000I2JDD0,"A great collection of some of the best from the WCCW days. They had one of the best talent groups of all time, at least for a short period!",1272240000,2,139,3.8275862068965516
2651854,4,B000I2JDD0,"Before I get started, just let me point out for the record that I saw WWE's documentry on World Class first so eventhough this one came out before WWE did their version, just keep in mind that I saw this version after that one. Now just like I stated in my review for the WWE version of his documentry, I'll be honest in that I didn't have the chance to see World Class until I got WWE 24/7 a year ago as it wasn't available to me growing up but after seeing the wonderful WWE documentry & founding a new respect for what I saw there & on the 24/7 channel, I decided to give this video a try. The format of this DVD was different than the usual ones I see (like WWE and others like Forever Hardcore & History Of TNA) in that this came off more as a mix of a documentry movie (like Beyond The Mat). You'll see & hear from various familar faces like Kevin Von Erich, Skandar Akbar, Gary Hart, Bill Mercer along with comments from Chris Adams via an old RF Video shoot interview he did before he died.

The documentry begins talking about the orgins of Fritz Von Erich & World Class Championship Wrestling with the advanced camera & audio production along with bringing in Bill Mercer. The idea of doing something different as far as brining in new young talent such of the Von Erich boys, Chris Adams, Great Kabuki, and the Freebirds is discussed next. The high number of syndication markets the show got is talked about next with very interesting details of how they kept getting new syndication every week along with even getting bigger ratings than the popular Saturday Night Live & even got high ratings than the local territories did in their own markets...including the WWE. Scandar Akbar's devistating stable of Kamala, Missing Link, and the Super Destroyers called Devistation Inc. is profiled next along with their feud with the Von Erich's. How the NWA Champions toured the territory, Brusier Brody, and the companies big events called ""Star Wars"" were talked about next before the thoughts of WCCW alumni regarding Mike Von Erich as a wrestler were discussed next followed by the personality profiles they would do on talent including showing the one with Jimmy Garvin & Sunshine working on the Von Erich's ranch. David Von Erich's death due to stomach problems in Japan is heavily discussed next including the story how thousands showed up to the funeral & burial before moving on to the tribute show & Kerry winning the NWA Championship. Highlights of the Freebirds/Devistation Inc./Von Erich rivarly is shown next before going into Chris Adams turning heel on Kevin & joining up with Gary Hart. Gino Hernandez's run is profiled next showcasing how he lived the high life, his association with Nickla Roberts, forming the dynamic duo with Chris Adams, and the hair feud with the Von Erichs. Highlights of the Midnight Express & Fantastics' feud is shown before heavy discussion regarding the Mike Von Erich shoulder injury that led to his toxic shock syndrome & how he was brought back too soon. The Lance Von Erich incident is briefly mentioned before the heavy drug problems of Gino Hernandez that led to his death is heavily discussed with some people thinking that it was more than just a drug overdose. Brief notes regarding pulling WCCW out of the NWA due to the politics of Jim Crockett along with the ESPN deal were shown before the negative effects of Fritz Von Erich still respecting the old school ""territorial code"" is talked about. Kerry Von Erich's motorcycle accident, absence for 18 months, and the lifetime effects of that accident were focused on next before the suicide of Mike Von Erich was talked about along with how his memorial show showed how WCCW was on a downward spiral. The downfall of the company in regards Fritz's selling the company, attendance dropping, failed merge with AWA before Jerry Jarrett changing it to USWA is noted over before going into the details of the murder of Brusier Brody in Puerto Rico & how that effected people to the point where a wrestler on this documenty stated that he will never go to Puerto Rico. The suicide deaths of Chris & Kerry Von Erich, Fritz' death due to cancer, and Chris Adams murder close out the documentry before Kevin Von Erich takes one last emotional walk through The Sportatorium before the building is torn down.

DVD extras include an alternative documentry beginning, footage of the Von Erichs & Bill Mercer going on a duck hunt, David Von Erich's last interview & match on the World Class show against Freebird Terry Gordy, Bill Mercer & WCCW Executive Producer Mickey Grant infont of the Sportatorium one last time (the audio is very bad on this one), trailers for the documentry, various audio interviews & segments, and the section of the ROH shoot video with Jim Cornette where he talks about his time in World Class including a funny & gross story regarding Percy ""Paul Bearer"" Pringle & french fries.

Unfortunally I saw WWE's documentry on World Class before this one so things I would normally point out as a negative in regards to the documentry itself, I can't because whatever was missed or glanced over in WWE's documentry (Devistation Inc., Brusier Brody, Jim Cornette & Midnight Express, Star Wars, Fritz's & Chris Adams deaths) was picked up here & visa versa (Freebirds, AWA merge, seperation from NWA, Lance Von Erich). Very similar to how the ""Forever Hardcore"" documentry on ECW was to ""Rise & Fall Of ECW,"" both are a perfect alternative to the other. Now outside of the documentry, one big negative I felt was that for a DVD set on a wrestling promotion who actually owned their own footage, there weren't any matches from the feuds they highlighted in the documentry past David's last match. You would think that when you own footage & wrestling matches of popular wrestlers & legends that you would want to put matches on here to attract that non-average viewer/fan of World Class featuring Ric Flair, Jake Roberts, King Kong Bundy, Midnight Express, Junkyard Dog, Rick Rude & Percy ""Paul Bearer"" Pringle. I personally would have enjoyed those more than the bonus audio interviews. In the end, it's the exact same thing I said about the WWE documentry...this isn't just a documenty I just recommend as a wrestling fan who wants to ""take a walk down memory lane"" in regards to World Class Championship Wrestling but also one I would recommend for parents to show their children as well who are wrestling fans when teaching them the dangers of heavy drug use & the negative effects of suicide.",1260230400,5,6511,4.744924977934686
2651855,3,B000I2JDD0,"If you enjoyed the wrestling back when it was WCCW and the Von Erichs then this is certainly a dvd to add to your collection.  Also, If remember correctly, this is the dvd that did provide clips from those days, interviews with Kevin, and also the end shows some big names that have passed along with their ages and what happened.  That was interesting as well.  I had not realized how many young superstars had passed at such young ages and the way that they had.",1258070400,,464,4.372093023255814
2651856,5,B000I2JDD0,"If you are a wrestling fan, that has interest in it's history this is an excellent DVD. It is before Kevin Von Erich sold the library to WWE so there is alot of WCCW footage used. Five Stars.",1258070400,3,191,4.052631578947368
2651857,5,B000I2JDD0,"""Heroes of World Class"" is for wrestling fans who want to learn about the behind-the-scenes story of the great Dallas-based NWA affiliate of the early 1980s and its stars.  Fans who want to relive wrestling bouts in their entirety will be disappointed, but this 2 1/2 hour documentary with bonus disc full of interviews and wrestling clips is what I hoped for and thoroughly enjoyed.  I watched World Class back in the late 1980s in syndication in northern California.  It was several years after the organization's heyday, but the stories and stars were fresh to me.  I remember watching it everyday after school on TBS, I think, and taping my favorite wrestlers (tapes I still have) and wishing I could visit the Sportatorium.  I also bought back issues of Pro Wrestling Illustrated that had covers or features on my favorite World Class stars.  I did not know about the background of World Class though I knew the heartrending story of the Von Erich family and their many tragedies through the book ""The Von Erich Family Album.""  I did not realize how important and innovative World Class was until I watched this DVD.

Director Brian Harrison (who is about my age and also became a fan of World Class as a kid watching the shows in syndication) has collected interviews with many important people like Kevin Von Erich, manager/producer Gary Hart, announcer Marc Lowrance (now a Methodist minister), the late ""Gentleman"" Chris Adams, Gen. Skandar Akbar, executive producer Mickey Grant, commentator/associate producer Bill Mercer, and referee David Manning who, I learned, was much more to World Class than just a referee.  They talk about the innovative techniques they used to bring the wrestling action to life.  Clips from some of the major feuds are shown including the Freebirds vs. the Von Erichs, Devastation Inc. vs. the Freebirds, the Von Erich/Chris Adams and Gino Hernandez feud, Jim Cornette and the Midnight Express vs. the Fantastics, Chris Adams vs. ""Gorgeous"" Jimmy Garvin, as well as clips from when Garvin had to be David Von Erich's valet.

Sadly, no story on World Class can be complete without covering the many tragedies that fell on the stars.  The most poignant was the sudden death of David Von Erich.  David Manning talks about having to break the news to Fritz.  The funeral procession is described which demonstrates how important David was to the city of Dallas and not just Dallas wrestling.  Kevin reminisces on growing up with David.  Mike's toxic shock syndrome and later suicide is discussed as is Kerry's motorcycle accident and later suicide.  The death of Gino Hernandez is covered.  David Manning gives reasons why he suspects foul play.  Gary Hart talks about Bruiser Brody's stabbing and the murder of Chris Adams.  Chris Von Erich is also discussed.  Another very poignant moment in the DVD is when Kevin talks about his father's behavior towards him after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.

The most interesting part of the documentary for me was when Kevin Von Erich visits the Sportatorium before it was torn down.  He goes through the building and describes what it was like back in the day.  It was a miserable dump as described on the bonus disc by Jim Cornette and Bill Mercer, but the producers and crew made it look like an awesome place to be.  Unfortunately, the audio in the clip where Mickey Grant and Bill Mercer visit the Sportatorium is almost non-existent.  Even with the volume turned up to the max, it can barely be heard.

The bonus disc offers many additional interviews.  Manager Jim Cornette talks about the good ol' days and gives his frank opinion on the Von Erich brothers.  He also gives a disgusting story about the grease trap for the fries at the Sportatorium.  There is an  interview with Pro Wrestling Torch's Wade Keller and Bruce Mitchell.  Mitchell is critical of the documentary and thinks it glossed over Fritz Von Erich's treatment of his sons.  Mitchell has a different take on David Von Erich's death.  It is odd that a DVD will include an interview criticizing it.  Mitchell is very critical of the Von Erichs in general.  He also points out some story lines WCCW used to cover up or overshadow things that would be detrimental to the promotion.  It is a very long interview but is worth checking out.  He also mentions the Dingo Warrior (later to be the Ultimate Warrior) and it dawned on me that he was not covered in the documentary.  An interview with DVD creator Brian Harrison and announcer Bill Mercer is included as well as trailers.  My only criticism is that the wrestling clips that are placed between the interviews seem a little disjointed at times.  For example, the Midnight Express clips seemed to be dropped in wherever as if they knew they needed to include them somewhere so they just plopped them in.  They didn't flow well with the rest of the documentary.  Also, I remember the World Class name coming to an end after a match involving Eric Embry, but nothing is mentioned of that. Otherwise, I recommend this DVD to anyone interested in the story behind World Class Championship Wrestling.",1257552000,,5100,4.847398843930636
2651858,5,B000I2JDD0,"This is a great movie! Anyone who was a kid in North Texas in the early 80's would love this movie, even if you don't like wrestling. It brought back so many memories for me. The DVD itself was in great condition. Very, very happy with my purchase!!",1257120000,,249,4.208333333333333
2651859,4,B000I2JDD0,"The Von Erichs came about that close to completely taking over Wrestling, back in the 80's, but because of a lot of negative twists of fate, it was never to be. Had little 5 year old Jack Adkinson Jr. not have died of an electocution accident, there would have basically been 2 ""David Von Erichs"" and from the photos I've seen of him, he was a carbon copy of Fritz. Imagine that scenario? Jack and David Von Erich, along with Kerry and Kevin? Talk about a dynasty. Mike Von Erich would have never had to wrestle, and had David not died in Japan, WCCW would have been much bigger than both the NWA as a whole, and the WWF/AWA. Now imagine Young Chris, if he had not had his growth stunted by asthma medication? Wow, by 1984, instead of being the beginning of the end, WCCW could have overtaken the NWA Territories, had Fritz not been so stubborn and old school. By 1987, if Kerry had never had the accident, and Chris would have been about, say Kevin's size, there would have been no stopping them, as long as they didn't allow substance abuse to take them over, there would have been no stopping them.

But it wasn't to be, and too many negative dominoes fell the wrong way, negative event, after negative event, leading to the Death of WCCW.",1244332800,,1242,4.4

2651862,5,B000I2JDD0,"I have just noticed the release of the heroes of World Class Wrestling but this blu ray title has the run time listed at 300 minutes instead of the 180 for the regular version. I knew that Mickey Grant had a lot of added material that was not used in the first version and I,am hoping that this blu ray title actually does have the extra 120 minutes added to it. From what i understand Kevin went throught the sportatorium for a much longer time than what was on the original and this is what I liked best about the first dvd. Since kevin sold his rights to all the WCCW library to Vince Mcmahon this might be the last hurah for seeing World Class Wrestling as it was.
Scot Denny. As an ad on it was sad that reviewer DK did indeed not see World Class Wrestling except for the WWE doctored shows they run on WWE 24/7. I have probably every WCCW show that was broadcast on CBN at the time,and treasure them. World Class Wrestling was the premier Wrestling Company,but did not have the proper people at the helm. This dvd by its original producer is 10 times better than the WWF,s and just tio see kevin go back in the Sportatorium one more time was worth every penny you spend on this dvd. Understand that Vince mc mahon raided this company WCCW more than any other for their talent,names like the One Mang Gang,the Fabulous Freebirds,the Missing Link,Al Perez,the Ultimate Warrior,and even kerry Von Erich himself all were World Class.the sad part of all of this is the video and Audio values of World Class Wrestling 25 years ago still yops anything The WWF does even today.",1230854400,5,1575,4.415807560137457
2651863,4,B000I2JDD0,"My first exposure to World Class was via a fuzzy UHF channel in the Los Angeles area aroung the mid-eighties. Back then, watching as a little kid, the Sportatorium looked like some cheap ""gymnasium-closet"". Nonetheless, the in-ring action was thrilling to watch.

So when I first heard about this DVD-set about World Class, I was pretty thrilled. The documentary itself is full of old-footage as well as current appearances by all the well-known players from the World Class era(Kevin Von Erich, Skandar Akbar, Gary Hart, Bill Mercer, Marc Lawrence, etc).

As well made and imformative as the documentary was along with all the little extras, the downfall of this set will always be the fact that it contains no matches.

Still, for the historical value and Kevin Von Erich's last visit to a depleted Sportatorium, this DVD set is worth a try.",1223596800,,843,4.922535211267606
2651874,4,B000I2JDD0,Just go this one too.  It's pretty good.  I had no idea some of those folks were so messed up.  Very sad.  It's a good documentary - but very sad at the same time.,1222646400,2,163,3.7058823529411766
2651875,5,B000I2JDD0,"I just watched this last night. The main documentary is about 2 1/2 hours long but worth every minute to watch! It really explores the glory and downfall of WCCW without all the political influence of the WWE release (which was good despite that). While the production values are low budget and the tone of the video is darker than the WWE version, it still comes off quite well in telling the story of WCCW.

Who I was most impressed with was Kevin Von Erich himself. This man has had the proverbial ""scars of time"" roasted onto him yet he manages to see the positive in nearly everything. Through all that tragedy and the loss of his brothers and father, he manages to stay sane! I found him to be a very inspirational man. Definitely pay close attention to how he deals with all of what he's been through because if he can go through that and still stay strong, none of us have any excuse since most of us have never had to deal with that kind of tragedy.

I also liked the interviews with former ring announcer Mark Lawrence, III (who is now a minister), Gary Hart, ring commentator Bill Mercer and others that I remember from that era but can't think of their names at the moment. They provided great insight into the rise and fall of World Class as well as their views on the Von Erich family.

My disc came with two DVD's. On Disc 1, it has the main documentary plus nearly 30 minutes of deleted scenes from the film. One of the ""deleted scenes"" was a match between the late David Von Erich and the late ""Freebird"" Terry Gordy! The match was only about 2 minutes but it was wild and it does give you a glimpse into the talent of David and why he was being touted as the next NWA World Champion before his untimely death in 1984. Counting this added footage, there is really about 3 hours of footage on Disc 1 alone!

Disc 2 is interviews with various people about World Class Championship Wrestling. The main ones of interest are Jim Cornette and Bill Mercer but all the interviews total up 4 hours so you are really getting about 7 hours of footage with this set!

There are some things that are done better on this one than on WWE's ""Triumph And Tragedy Of World Class Championship Wrestling."" The deaths of Bruiser Brody, Gino Hernandez and Chris Adams are covered better here than they were on the WWE release (in fact, neither Brody's nor Adams' deaths are even brought up on their documentary). The Fabulous Freebirds, while given due credit for their part in WCCW's success, aren't as praised on here as in the WWE release (though they certainly weren't slammed in any case). Plus, the death of Fritz Von Erich is discussed in detail here too.

To give credit where its due, the WWE's version discusses the end of World Class in more detail than this release does (though ""Heroes"" does mention it as well as their union with the AWA).

Overall, I can't say enough good things about this documentary. My personal recommendation is to get both ""Heroes Of World Class"" & WWE's ""The Triumph And Tragedy Of World Class Championship Wrestling"" because what one of them lacks, the other fills the gaps. My fancy way of saying that between the two videos, you will have a near complete look at one of the best NWA territories and organizations ever in the 1980's! See it!",1202774400,16,3277,4.469899665551839
2651876,4,B000I2JDD0,"I remember staying up late on saturday nights in junior high/ high school to catch World Class wrestling on Channel 17 in Philadelphia 82-85. What a great promotion. This docu captures all the inside action of the WCCW promotion and also it's downfall in the late 80's. It was sad to see the Sportatorium in the condition it was left. True wrestling fans will be impressed. It's kind of low budget, but done well. Gary Hart and Bill Mercer do a great job of explaining the behind the scenes action.",1202428800,,498,4.544444444444444
2651877,4,B000I2JDD0,"I was very excited when ""Heroes of World Class Championship Wrestling"" was released, and even more satisfied with the product itself, despite its few shortcomings.

The tone of the documenatry is set in the opening minutes with a foreshadowing of the finale: a trip into the now mythical Sportatorium by Kevin von Erich.

The glory days are revisitied, but the darker aspects begin to show their face quickly with the death of David.  The documenatry only gets darker from there.

Compared to the newly released WWE video, this video is just as effective, but much darker in tone.  The video concentrates on the tragic aspects as the video moves forward.  For a fan who grew up to these great heroes, it was quite depressing.

The interviews are set up very informally, which reveal the only production value gripe I have.  But despite that one flaw, the video is a must have for all Texas wrestling fans.",1198627200,2,905,4.756410256410256
2651878,4,B000I2JDD0,This is a great documentary and despite it's flaws it's a one of a kind item. It's true that the old footage is grainy and the interview with Kevin Von Erich is of low quality (you can hear the wind coming into the microphone). Otherwise it's a must have for any fan and for anyone wanting to find out more about the golden age of wrestling.,1194480000,5,341,4.181818181818182
2651879,5,B000I2JDD0,"Growing up as Dusty Rhodes and Magnum T.A. were battling the Four Horseman in the NWA, I had barely even heard of the WCCW and only read of the Von Erich family, usually in regard to the Von Erich curse. After veiwing the trailer for this DVD, I had to check it out. This is extremely well done and ranks right up there with the best wrestling documentaries that I have ever seen(in no order; Beyond the mat, Forever Hardcore, Rise and Fall of ECW, Ric Flair and the Four Horseman). It could be the best. I watched the 2 1/2 hour documentary, then I watched it again. Non wrestling fans actually sat through it and enjoyed it. The story is just so compelling and tragic.

The filmmakers have done a great job in gaining access to the WCCW video library before WWE snatched it for their own use. Being able to get some good information from Kevin made all the difference in the world. Unfortunately, in exchange for that access, you could tell that the director chose to lay off the criticism of the Von Erich family. I have heard they were all on drugs constantly and often missed matches or showed up drunk. No mention of that at all. I think Ricky Morton (Rock n Roll express) mentioned he once had to go and bust out a truck window to get Kerry out of the truck where he was passed out so they could have their match. This documentary doesn't really dwell on the drug abuse much expect to justify some of the suicides.

Overall, the documentary gets up close to the people who lived it and created it and they seemed genuine in their responses to relive the past for us for a couple of hours. The documentary does a good job of taking us chronologically through the years until the organization crumbles and way too many great wrestlers pass away. I would say this one is a MUST SEE dvd for any wrestling fan.",1193356800,7,1812,4.3579881656804735
2651880,5,B000I2JDD0,"While not a wrestling fan, I watched Dallas wrestling on Channel 11 often enough with my husband when we moved back to the Dallas/Fort Worth area to be very familiar with the heroes and villains. This DVD was enthralling to my husband and extremely enjoyable for this gal not so interested in wrestling. We watched it nonstop for about 2-1/2 hours and talked about it afterwards. Extremely well done, incredible personal interviews, old wrestling faces we had forgotten about and many we greatly admired. The ONLY problem was some interviews with Kevin Von Erich in the outdoors of his home when the wind was blowing and the microphone was not protected. The visit to the old Sportatorium was nostalgic. The history of so many good old and new wrestlers from the 80s era was wonderful to see!

This was an extremely well thought-out presentation, showing beginnings of wrestling in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, its development, changes, and ultimate demise of professional wrestling in the Dallas area. We learned numerous things about the Von Erichs we had never known, and appreciated the candor of Kevin Von Erich and Gary Hartman, as well as Bill Murcer and all associated with the organization. Incredible DVD!",1187654400,,1214,5.00990099009901
2651881,5,B000I2JDD0,"This DVD will be attemped by WWE later in 2007. I don't think they can capture what this dvd did. You hear stories from a lot of the guys who were in the midst of all the great stuff that came out of Texas. Not a one sided WWE pre approved statement that you will probably hear Michael Hayes say. I know they will have Kevin Von Erich and Hayes talking a lot because they do the WWE 24/7 WCCW classic TV segment but Hayes has become a real big WWE guy and I rather hear from people in the business that have not become tainted.

Kevin Von Erich seems to be pretty neutral as he was on this dvd talking and actually walking through the old Sportatorium. That was interesting to see him relive that stuff before it was demolished. I lost respect for the ""Freebird"" when Doc Hendrix came along. (remember that...unfortunately I do)

The upcoming WWE dvd will be the same attempt to out do Heroes of World Class like Rise and Fall tried to out do Forever Hardcore. The other productions are better because you hear a non biased and uncensored opinion when you venture away from WWE. You get the truth these guys have nothing to hide and they leave nothing out. Very honest on good things and bad things that were done with that company.

GET THIS DVD BEFORE THE WWE VERSION AND COMPARE. THIS IS WHERE THE TRUTH IS.",1181520000,5,1310,4.317073170731708
2651882,5,B000I2JDD0,"I grew up on WCCW, i loved the von erichs, i wanted to be a wrestler move to Texas and marry Kerry or Kevin. But by the time i turned 18, kerry was dead.  Kevin quit.  (i cant watch WWE it never measured up to what World class was.)  Watching this documentary took me back to my childhood; and watching the clips of the matches made me excited like i was watching it for the first time.  (i haven't seen the footage since the 80s) I was surprised to see Kevin looking so well; he hasn't changed much at all. Still good looking. He's got the same hair, same built. Id still want to marry him.  The most moving footage was when Kevin walked into the abandoned Sportatorium, that was going to be soon demolished.  He walked around and gave a tour of the place. He found his grandfather's old desk was still there. In his dad's old office he explained his dad put in all the paneling himself.  He said he left so much stuff there, like pictures on the wall, and its all gone now. (heart breaking).  Very moving.  This is worth getting if you were a big van of WCCW and the von erichs.  Gary hart is giving alot of information on the DVD. and gives great detail of the rise and fall of WCCW, and gives first hand accounts of the wrestlers he was close to.  GET IT and love it.",1177891200,4,1271,4.146938775510204
2651883,4,B000I2JDD0,"As a huge World Class Championship Wrestling fan and a mega Chris Adams/Gino Hernandez fan, I was waiting for this release with more anticipation than for any product in a long time.  On the plus side, the DVD does a fine job delineating the rise and fall of the promotion.  The archival footage brought back many fond memories.  Also treasured were the comments by Kevin Von Erich, Bill Mercer and Mickey Grant, Mark Lowrance, Johnny Mantell, Skandor Akbar, David Manning, and (especially) Gary Hart.  There are many reasons to recommend this DVD.  However, what was lacking was a little more depth on the out-of-ring troubles of the Von Erichs (which may have not been possible, given Kevin Von Erich owned the WCCW video library at the time) and coverage of another major reason why the promotion tanked- the absence of charismatic heels to face the Von Erichs after the death of Gino Hernandez.  Still, well worth the time and cost.",1175299200,2,936,4.81875
2651905,3,B000I2JDD0,"I have to admit I was disappointed after watching this DVD. Maybe I'm too young and had never the chance to see anything of world class when it was around. The point is the minor quality which makes it hard to follow the story. For me as a non native speaker i hardly understand what David von Erich is saying in his interviews, I better understand what the wind is whispering. And a little bit of light can't cost that much. They should spend a little more money for the production.

And am I blind, there is not one single match to see as a bonus?",1174953600,2,549,4.179245283018868
2651906,4,B000I2JDD0,"I had only previously heard about World Class Championship Wrestling through reading about it on internet websites.  One of the things that always struck me what what happened to the Von Erich (a.k.a. Adkisson) family and the tragedy that befell them during the years when WCCW was going through its downward spiral.  What director Brian Harrison has done is nothing less than a triumph.

The movie takes a look at World Class' humble beginnings as a territory for the National Wrestling Alliance called Southwest Sports.  It then advances to its heyday in the early 80s, when it got so enormously popular that it even started to outdraw Saturday Night Live in Dallas.  It also became very popular in Israel, where the Von Erichs and announcer Bill Mercer were the four most popular entertainment personalities in the country (although in the movie, Mercer admits sarcastically that he didn't like being number four).  According to the Wrestling Observer newsletter, their ratings were so good, they even outdrew the WWF (now WWE) in Boston (which is traditionally a WWF stronghold).

Many personalities were interviewed in the movie.  From manager/booker ""Playboy"" Gary Hart, to the wrestlers who were a part of the promotion, like Chris Adams and Skandor Akbar.  Highlights including the famous Von Erichs - Freebirds feud that lit the Dallas territory on fire during 1982 to 1984.  Included in the footage of the famous moment where Terry Gordy slammed the cage door in the face of Kerry Von Erich on Christmas day 1982, which practically started the feud.  Also interesting is ther perspective of Mickey Grant, the producer of the WCCW TV show, in that he came up with many revolutionary ways (at the time) to film the action for television.

Of course, this story takes the sad turn.  Many of the deaths from World Class, including those of the Von Erichs are highlighted.  This leads to the belief that there might be a ""curse"" over the workers of the promotion.

What really makes this DVD great is Kevin Adkisson (Kevin Von Erich).  The movie really is worth buying to see what Kevin's persepctive was when he was seeing his brothers and his father die.  Kevin doesn't pull any punches and it is worth the price to see the footage where he goes back to the Dallas Sportatorium before it was torn down.

Now the WWE is going to have their own documentary on the promotion now that the tape library of WCCW has been sold to them.  So their documentary will have the political spin.  Apparently, the documentary that the WWE will produce will make the Freebirds responsible for the great run in the early 80s when it was more than that.  So the reason that people should get this video is that they should a more balanced view of what made this promotion so great, only to have it go down in a blaze of glory.

The only gripe I have about the set is that it doesn't have any matches.  It shouldn't deter anyone from buying a great movie about a great wrestling promotion.",1174694400,19,2976,4.735922330097087
2651907,5,B000I2JDD0,"I grew up in San Antonio, so watching clips from World Class, wow, they were ahead of the times.  It was interesting to learn how they did business back in those days.  I've watched this DVD already five times since I've received it.  World Class Championship Wrestling made the Freebirds Fabulous, Jimmy Garvin Gorgous, Chris Adams a Gentleman.  The feuds with the Von Erichs really put alot of wrestlers on the map and I didn't realize the world wide exposure they had back in the early and mid-eighties.  I wish they had talked about some other feuds, Brian Adidas vs. Kevin Von Erich, OMG vs. Kerry Von Erich, and some with Devestation Inc. vs. Iceman King Parsons, but it was a great DVD to purchase.

They do talk about the Von Erich curse in great detail.  Again, it was very interesting on how many wrestlers that have passed on so early in their lives, wrestled in World Class.  I give it two major thumbs up.",1173830400,5,918,4.5212121212121215

I have since become a therapists for other professional wrestlers on the rise in there carrers as well as others in different sports.

I would have loved the opportunity to have met the Von Erich family.

I know that ""Kevin"" is the only brother left in his family & that he has a family of his own.

I wish him & his family all the best & hopefully he will come back in form or another.

2651909,5,B000I2JDD0,"I remember watching wrestling when I was a kid in the late 60's. This man got into the ring and the announcer said ""and in this corner is Fritz Von Erich."" To my 6 year old eyes, he looked to be about 180 years old. The first time that I saw him apply the Von Erich claw, I thought that his apponents head would explode just like stepping on a grape. Years later his son Kerry Von Erich became one of the best wrestlers I had seen thus far. There were also brothers Kevin and David. He later came up with the name of the Texas Tornado, and without a doubt he was a class 5 tornado. I was in Dallas Texas while watching the news, I heard he was arrested. At that time I thought that I had something in common with Kerry Von Erich. I knew that this family was plagued with tradgedies but I had no idea to what extent until after I watched the dvd HEROES OF WORLD CLASS. I hate it when someone tells me how a movie is going to end; so I'm not going to tell you. I gave it a 5 star rating so buy it, watch it and tell me I'm wrong. By the time you finish this video, you will believe that a class 5 tornado went right through the Von Erich family.",1173398400,3,1143,3.9098712446351933
2651910,5,B000I2JDD0,This is a must buy for any World Class Championship Wrestling fan.  I never realized how important WCCW was.  It's truly a big loss now that it's gone.  It's amazing to see what kind of person Kevin Von Erich is.  To stay that positive after all he's been through is truly inspirational.  The one down side is at times the production value is a little low and people are hard to hear talking.  I would still pay top dollar to buy this DVD.,1173052800,5,439,4.228915662650603
2651911,5,B000I2JDD0,"For the average wrestling fan today, the wrestling industry is or was consisted of the WWE, WCW, ECW, and TNA. If you are fortunate, some of them might even read about the AWA and how about this one, the National Wrestling Alliance. How far has our intellect gone? Unfortunately, one organization appears to be out of the conversation due to either a lack of knowledge, an unwillingness to learn, or the various tragedies that occurred. That organization was World Class Championship Wrestling. Thanks to fan and Director Brian Harrison, we all can recall and have a formal education to what this tremendous and inspiring wrestling company did for an industry that was on the brink of explosion during the early to mid-1980's. This DVD is more than simply a documentary on the company, it is an eye-opening presentation of how a wrestling company can succeed through the television medium and how fast it can fall when tragic circumstances occurr in combination with questionable business practices. I realize that this is a cliche that has become so familar, but this DVD is definately a must buy for all wrestling fans.

2651912,4,B000I2JDD0,"I remember reading thew ""Apter"" magazines and in the late 70's early '80's

there was the standard Von-Erich article. I first watched WCCW while visting family in Texas. The chill that went down my spine while Championship Wrestling from Florida when the late great Gordon Solie announced the passing of David Von-Erich. About two years earlier David had a successful run as a heel in the territory.

That seemed to be the begining of ""The Von-Erich"" curse. It seemed that karma caught up with other workers other than the Von-Erichs. However, if there father would have put his foot down and laid the law down to his son's maybe things would have been different. Not to take away from the production and the ahead of its time production and promotion. To see such stars as the Von-Erichs, the Freebirds, Junkyard Dog, and a young Shawn Michaels.

Sadly, as with all of the rest of the promotors of the N.W.A. they were more concerned with their own backyard and the gentleman's agreement ""I won't run shows in your territory if you don't run them in mine"" and their own postion to fail to see the writing on the wall. Fritz Von-Erich could have beaten Vince McMahon to the punch but couldn't see the forest for the tree. It was good to see some of the old matches but sadly because

of his refusal to face reality he coudln't save his sons.

Like most wrestling documentaries tragedy seems to overshadow the good feelings you get from the dvd.
