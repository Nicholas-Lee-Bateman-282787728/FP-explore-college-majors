8142372,5,B000HXE5RO,"These super-short little 50 minute films covering the 1970 thru 1980 seasons of F1 leave the viewer SCREAMING for more footage, but at least it's SOMETHING, as getting our U.S. hands on anything F1 is as unlikely as finding a suitcase full of cash on the sidewalk! One would've thought that by now a lot of F1 historical material released on VHS would've found its way into U.S. DVD players by now, but sadly we are instead flooded with national, rather than international, motorsport such as the idiotic oval racing of NASCAR or the FAR inferior IndyCar 24/7. Oh well, we must be content with the few snippets we can get. This F1 fan hopes for a day when all of the F1 releases that ever made it to VHS be rereleased to the U.S. in DVD form. That is all.",1379030400,,755,4.361702127659575
8142373,1,B000HXE5RO,"This series of DVD's covering specific old Formula One seasons act as a biat for people like me who love F1 from that time.

However, there's a catch: they simply su..k. They compact 15 races of the season in a 52 minutes video. Believe me, you'll be better served navigating You Tube, where you can find (for example) the whole of the 1973 German Grand Prix.",1266710400,,359,4.4393939393939394
