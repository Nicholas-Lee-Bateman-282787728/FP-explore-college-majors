1646199,5,B00005QAPH,"I found it off-putting at first, but Federico Fellini's eighth film (the ""1/2"" represents a short) seems less offensive in retrospect. Basically, Guido Anselmi (Marcello Mastroianni) is a bit of a jerk when it comes to women, and the women in the picture are painted with pretty broad strokes (Anouk Aime is the Uptight Wife, Claudia Cardinale is--literally--the Dream Girl, etc.). But I think we're meant to see them as he does and not necessarily as the director feels we should. The elegantly world weary Mastroianni is probably the only actor in the world who could have made this kind of character sympathetic. Not much happens either, but I guess that's the point: 8-1/2 is a film about a man--a filmmaker--at an impasse in his life. Women frustrate him, he's getting old, and he just can't seem to get his latest production off the ground. It's all one long bad dream. For what it's worth, director Jonathan Nossiter (Sunday, Signs & Wonders) has said he didn't like the film when he first saw it either. Some viewers may find that it takes a combination of time and successive viewings to fully penetrate this self-enclosed world--but it's worth the effort.
As a special bonus, the carnival-esque soundtrack is one of Nino Rota's very best and just gets better the more I hear it. Gianni Di Venanzo's luminous B&W cinematography is also quite stunning.",918172800,3,1360,4.866379310344827

1646283,5,B00005QAPH,"Although Fellini often said Americans over-analyze his films, 8 1/2 is clearly the story of an existential confrontation with the absurd. The director is supposed to have a script ready; a Cape Canaveral-like set is built at the beach; actresses and actors are demanding their parts; an American journalist turns to the audience and says with hysterical glee, ""He has nothing to say he has nothing to say he has nothing to say!""  A directors nightmare! In a classic existential confrontation, one finds oneself in a situation where there is no logical way out. The choices that are left are suicide and continuing with life understanding that it is absurd. Fellini's director gets to take both choices: time seems to stop while first, he crawls under the table, pulls out a gun and shoots himself in the head. But then he is not dead! He gets up and joins hands with everyone as they parade around in a circle led by himself as a child dressed as a clown or Harlequin-like symbol of the absurd. I have never seen a more poignant illustration of an existential confrontation.",1475280000,,1074,4.74331550802139

1646287,5,B00005QAPH,"I have admittedly been on a tear lately watching (or in some cases re-watching) some foreign films that were all the rage among college students and young professionals in the 1960s and 1970s. Recently in reviewing Francois Truffauts Day For Night, a film like the one under review, Frederico Fellinis 8 , which both dealt with making films (or as here not making them) I noted the following that applies here as well:

In the old days, the stretch between the early 1960s and early 1970s, around Harvard Square on the days, or rather nights, when you were not listening to folk music at one of the myriad coffeehouses around the Square or stretched out on Cambridge Common listening to some up and coming young rock and roll talent blast away you would in the interest of having a cheap date based on  your low side funds wind up taking your consort to the Brattle Theater or some such place (sometimes local churches or the various houses at Harvard also ran films) to watch a film. Not usually one of the then current American Hollywood productions, a place which seemed to be in a trough in the movie-making cycle, but some film noir revival with entries like The Maltese Falcon or To Have Or Have Not or foreign, mainly French films, like those of Jean-Luc Godard or Francois Truffaut (at one time friends but because of differences about the film under review that friendship was busted up). At that time anything by a French director like this one by Truffaut, Day for Night, was an automatic go see, whether it was up to snuff or not.

What went for the French directors applied as well to the Italian film-maker Fellini, especially after his early film La Dolce Vita blew us away with it cinematography and its meandering message about the sweet life that many of us were seeking then (although our forte was drugs, sex and rock and roll not among the high society types though). And so when we were older, old enough to go see Fellini films on our own in revivals, which we were not permitted to see earlier  since the good Fathers at Sacred Heart warned us off such fare we would grab a date and go to the Brattle and check it out.

If Truffauts Day for Night was about the craft of film-making Fellinis film is centered elsewhere with what one critic at the time called the travails of Guidos directors block and the facts of his life at that point which had helped him freeze up in trying to create something for the screen that could be produced and produced increasingly under time pressures (the film director is played by Marcello Mastroianni here). So we get, maybe more than we want to get, a full view of Guidos life, his on again off again relationship with his estranged wife, with his mistress, recollections of childhood (a scene we all could appreciate of Guido as a youth dancing with a prostitute and then being punished by the good Fathers at his boarding school for such behavior-very familiar), a visit to a Cardinal, and all the attempts to appease Guido, or goad, him by bringing the film crew to his hotel to make the damn film. In the end something got produced, some sexual problems got resolved, and some of the greatest scenes and close-ups in film got produced. And Mastroianni was masterful in his role as Guido, was on a roll as an actor in those days. I never liked this one as much as my first Fellini film La Dolce Vita but it was close behind as a great film.",1469750400,,3403,4.508914100486224

The conceit about the main character making a film that is the film you are watching probably shouldn't have worked as well as it did, but Fellini seemed supremely confident in his instincts, and the oft-uttered belief that unflinching honesty was all he could offer as an artist. Fortunately he is too much the entertainer to make his confessions bleak, as in the fantasy harem scene in which all the women in his life vie for attention and slowly become an unruly mob that he has to beat back with a whip.

1646346,5,B00005QAPH,"With this movie, one has a choice between writing a long review that seeks to place it in the context of modernism as an artistic movement or writing a short review that just says, in effect, ""It's great.""  And great it is.  This 2-disc Criterion edition reproduces the images beautifully and has a lot of interesting features on the second disc.  The Fellini movie I had seen before this was ""La Strada,"" which was a touching, humane, and involving movie, which touched less on the creation of art than on the persistence under brutal conditions of the imagination and the spirit.  Here, the situation is developed on a completely different economic and cultural level, but the sense of the protagonist's life being a mess is very strong.  The protagonist is the film director Guido Anselmi (Marcello Mastroianni), and much of the movie seems to be set in a spa for rich Italians, where Guido has gone, one assumes, to take some stress off as he seeks to complete his latest project.  When his needy mistress Carla (Sandra Milo) shows up, followed shortly thereafter by his wife, Luisa (Anouk Aimee), the scene is set for a kind of comedy, it would seem -- but Guido seems pathetic and almost passive in his relations, and in the meanwhile, his film crew and the financial backers of his movie are wanting to move on with the project, while Guido seems to dither.  He has flashbacks to his childhood, and he has fantasies, and while they reveal something about him, they also contribute to the sense of impedance or ""block,"" which theme is established in the wonderful opening of the movie.  It seems funny too that the movie Guido contemplates seems to be about space exploration -- the last thing, one would think, that a Fellini would be interested in.  But the whole question underlying the memories, the fantasy, the gentle satire on the spa world and the Italian upper-class is whether beauty can be built out of such seemingly trivial lives and circumstances.  Did Joyce manage it with ""Ulysses,"" or did Picasso with his Avignon whorehouse?  The ending will astound you, for it seems that both Fellini and Guido pull something off that couldn't have been predicted.  I say Fellini too because it's fair to wonder at times if his attention to the triviality of Guido's life doesn't amount to a trivialization of his own art.

Mastroianni gives a great performance -- he's an actor who (as in ""La Dolce Vita"" too) isn't afraid of appearing foolish.  The beautiful women make an impact, but the development of the story in the context of the spa, where many women are older and where the younger ones seem to be candy for older, unattractive men, comes to undermine the impression of their beauty, and perhaps only Claudia (Claudia Cardinale) whom Guido has chosen to play the female lead in his movie even though he doesn't know for much of the movie what he's going to do with her emerges with an attractive self-possession and a sense of proportion and humor.  Still, it would be a mistake to think that ANY of that constitutes a narrative that prepares one  for a conclusion that calls for comparison with Shakespearean or Mozartian comedy -- except that it could only be a movie.  There's nothing else quite like it.",1448928000,5,3226,4.732142857142857

1646382,5,B00005QAPH,"Only one character really matters in this film: Guido. Guido is a famous director and the film opens with him at a health retreat somewhere in Italy. He has dark rings under his eyes and everyone wants something from him. People want to know about or be in his next movie, his opinions on abstruse topics, his money, his love.....

 The first scene sees Guido in a dream sequence: trapped within a car and then at the mercy of people who control him. However, this movie is not solely about a man who is pushed around by the world. It displays how we all want people to be a certain way due to a range of unconscious desires and fears drilled into us through our unique upbringings and the experiences that follow, but how the world will not let us live out the fantasies we secretly desire.

 The film presents the role of film director as a metaphor for each of us. We are the central organising point of our subjectivity. We want people to play the role we assign to them and the world to be a certain way. However, like life, the actors want to be something different, and both the intersubjective life of human beings and the physical environment impose a restricted framework in which we can create our film.

 Throughout the movie Fellini blurs reality, dream, fantasy and nightmare into a whole. Each moves into and informs the other. Guido sees his fantasies in reality and tries to create films based on those fantasies. People then interject their thoughts and feelings into the proposed film which pulls the fantasy back in. We see Guido acting in the world, then Fellini will move into a fantasy sequence where people play the role Guido wants, only for his dream to be shattered by his fears and the demands of others.

 8  reminded me greatly of Synecdoche New York (2008), which clearly modelled itself on it. The fears and fantasies on display are a fascinating presentation of two different times. Guido is a person working through Catholicism and its associated guilt and promise of salvation. In Synecdoche New York the main character Caden deals with his fears of sickness and loneliness and relies on a psychologist and a doctor for the salvation that the priest formally granted.

 Both Guido and Caden are thwarted in their attempts to direct reality to suit their desires. Both seem somewhat cut down and weakened by a world that continuously wants something from them and stands in the way of their fantasies. Synecdoche New York is a darker film though. It lacks the joy that flows through many parts of Fellinis film. 8  is shot in black and white, but it is one of the most lush and colourful films I have seen. Even when Fellinis fears direct reality, it is within the framework of a tender dreamlike river of colour and sound. In contrast Synecdoche New York presents individuals just holding on in the midst of existential despair until eventually finding solace in their coming exit from reality.

 To watch Fellini is to see how confrontation with reality need not turn into darkness and despair. Our lives are dreamlike and much of the time beyond our control. This can lead to fear and despair, but can also lead us to loosen our grip and enter the flow of the river. Never being able to separate reality from fantasy could lead us to throw our quest for truth away on angst, or can lead us to see the game of it all, and relax into it with acknowledgement of its absurdity. Fellini is fundamentally an optimist: maybe not consciously, but his optimism pours out of his unconsciousness into the film and provides an extremely tender experience for the viewer.

1646405,5,B00005QAPH,"8 is an Italian comedy-drama directed by Federico Fellini. Fresh off of the international success of La Dolce Vita, the master director moved into the realm of self-reflexive autobiography with what is widely believed to be his finest and most personal work. Co-scripted by Fellini, Tullio Pinelli, Ennio Flaiano, and Brunello Rondi, it stars Marcello Mastroianni as Guido Anselmi, a famous Italian film director; together with Claudia Cardinale,Anouk Aime and Sandra Milo.

Guido Anselmi is a film director overwhelmed by the large-scale production he has undertaken. He finds himself harangued by producers, his wife, and his mistress while he struggles to find the inspiration to finish his film. He is suffering from ""director's block"". Stalled on his new science fiction film that includes veiled autobiographical references, he has lost interest amid artistic and marital difficulties. As Guido struggles half-heartedly to work on the film, a series of flashbacks and dreams delve into his memories and fantasies; they are frequently interwoven with reality.

Fellini jumbles narrative logic by freely cutting from flashbacks to dream sequences to the present until it becomes impossible to pry them apart, creating both a psychological portrait of Guido's interior world and the surrealistic, circus-like exterior world that came to be known as ""Felliniesque.""The marriage of Fellini's hyperreal imagery, dreamy sidebars, and the gravity of Guido's increasing guilt and self-awareness make this as much a deeply moving, soulful film as it is an electrifying spectacle. Mastroianni is wonderful in the lead, his woozy sensitivity to Guido's freefall both touching and charming--all the more so as the character becomes increasingly divorced from the celebrity hype that ultimately outpaces him. One of the greatest films about film ever made, 8 1/2 turns one man's artistic crisis into a grand epic of the cinema.",1433721600,4,1919,5.523809523809524

I wanted the dubbed one because I'm learning camera-work and wanted to keep my eyes on the action and not have to keep reading captions.

They were wrong - this is captioned.  Apparently there is no reliable way with a foreign film on Amazon to know which kind you're getting.

1646525,4,B00005QAPH,"""8 1/2"" is Frederico Fellini's powerful statement about the desires we have and how they affect our lives. Fellini examines the question of how much we experience is real and what isn't real, but imagined in our heads. Fellini's film is very surrealistic, with beautiful images.

Mastriani gives a fantastic performance as the protagonist of our story. He plays a film director, trying to keep his sanity as the film he's working on seems to be unraveling around him. What is really unraveling is his life, and the film includes some very funny scenes about the toll the labor is taking on him.

Fellini makes it tough in my opinion to determine which scenes are occurring in real life and which scenes are all in the character's head. But I think that's the point, it's about discovering how easy our desires intersect with reality, and how we struggle to survive in the midst of the two.

I think this film requires more than one viewing to understand everything that is going on. I think that will turn some viewers away because it can be a bit frustrating to watch this film the first time.

1646532,5,B00005QAPH,"8 is, unquestionably, one of my favorite films of all time. This film is a mad circus, a mediation on life and love, and the most deliriously perfect film on the face of the earth. In short, 8 is the film equivalent of a baptism, each and every time I watch it I feel as though I am born again. Frederico Fellini's 8 is not just a magical film, the film itself is magic. It is a film about the beauty in artistic confusion and misguided passions, told seemingly autobiographically from the point of view of Guido Anselmi, a popular film director who finds himself awash in creative disunion and romantic pandemonium. Throughout the film Guido seeks out solutions through increasingly bizarre bouts of sordid self reflection that manifests itself in fits of manic hysteria and surreal fantasies that conjure up the most perplexing of answers.

Guido Anselmi is played by one of the finest of all the Italian actors, Marcello Mastroianni, and it is a performance for the history books. Mastroianni bridges the gap between film acting and true self-realization, just as director Frederico Fellini closes the gap between film and art, art and life, and life and dreams. This is a film that tries to communicate a great deal with its audience, therefore I find it best to go into 8 as a dry sponge, eager to absorb all of the wonderful and fantastic ideas the film so eloquently and carefully bestows.

8 is truly a one-of-a-kind experience, and I believe it one of the most important films ever made. It is extremely difficult to be unmoved by this film. I find it deeply affecting, haunting even, but in a very warm, comforting, welcoming, and even forgiving way. The honesty of 8 is unobscured by artistic and financial boundaries, as he explores not only the creative mind but the human spirit as well, and how these two things often war with each other. I recommend 8 to anyone who has ever fallen in love with a film, hell, I actually recommend 8 to anyone and everyone I know! I believe that everyone owes it to themselves to see this film. I believe that everyone should have the good fortune of experiencing of the greatest works of art that has ever been produced.

I honestly cannot stress enough how remarkable 8 truly is. There is not a single wasted frame of film in the whole piece. 8 is a wonderful, hypnotic, and beautiful odyssey. 8 is not just a film about film, it is a film about life.

To sum up all that's been said, I'll just repeat the obvious: 8 is one of my favorite films, and it is a very beautiful film. That is all.",1369008000,,2541,4.541484716157205

1646555,4,B00005QAPH,"I have been an admirer of this movie and of Fellini for more than twenty years and yesterday I saw this movie for about the fifth time.
I still consider it to be a great movie, especially the dreams and memories are portrayed in an admirable way and the cinematography is indeed great throughout.

Guido is in a creative crisis but probably the crisis in his contacts with women is even bigger. He is not mature in his dealings with women.
Among others, there is his mistress Clara, there is his wife Luisa, and there is Claudia who is (for him) the Anima and she has `the power or the key' to turn things straight for him.

I do have two (minor) points of criticism.
(1) Guido happens to be a not really likable character but he also somehow remains distant for the viewer (except in his memories and dreams) and because of this it is quite likely that the viewer does not really care so much for his well-being though his disfunctioning is the main theme of the movie.

- Spoiler alert -
Near the end Guido has a redemptive insight and all the characters of the movie join together in a festive finale. The energy circulates again. (Truly a great scene!)
(2) This liberating insight seemed to come `from nowhere', it was not an effect of (for example) a change in his attitude. For me, this felt rather `unorganic' and `thought out' and arbitrary than organic and natural.

Though I still consider this movie a great artistic achievement, the two points mentioned keep me from really being concerned about Guido's proceedings and from being really enthousiastic about the movie as a whole.",1366070400,3,1591,4.591549295774648

1646560,5,B00005QAPH,"This film is not for everyone which is obvious from the polarized reviews on this page. You will either love it or hate it but it will evoke a strong response either way. Fellini combines dreamlike fantasy sequences and distorted childhood memories with a real contemporary story line in a way that brilliantly blends them and blurs the line between the main character's fantasies and reality. The result is a dissection of  a man's total experience , both external and internal, as he plans to direct a film and struggles inwardly with mid life crises concerning his career and his complex relationship to women both past and present. Watching this I can't help but wonder how Fellini ever convinced others who participated in this artistically and financially of what his vision for this film was. It's hard to imagine anyone making a film like this today. Woody Allen has obviously been heavily influenced by Fellini's work but he only uses some elements while for Fellini the entire 2 1/2 hours is a mesmerizing blend of surreal elements.

1646562,3,B00005QAPH,"I've had to admit this before, but I don't know much about the creator of 8 , Federico Fellini.  I've certainly heard of him for decades, but until recently, I had not seen any of his films.  I recently watched AMARCORD, and found it energetic and evocative, but kind of empty as well.  A man looking back on his childhood with clear memories of how he FELT, portraying events in the over-important manner that kids think about the things that happen to them...like nothing is more important.  I enjoyed the film, but didn't quite understand the fervor.

8  caused many similar feelings for me.  It's filmed in gorgeous black and white, and it's even more of a dreamlike experience than AMARCORD.  On the surface, it tells the story of a famous Italian film director, Guido (played by the really terrific Marcello Mastroianni), who has perhaps had some sort of minor breakdown or creative collapse, and has gone to a spa somewhere in Italy.  Presumably, he has gone to get away from it all for a while, but he is surrounded by producers, critics, actors, who are all ready for him to start his next film.  It's clear Guido has no clear idea of what his film is about, except it is clearly meant to be autobiographical...yet he isn't sure what he's saying with the film.  Guido doesn't exactly have writer's block...he's got TOO much inspiration.  Seemingly, he desires to cram his entire life into the film, making it an homage to the important women in his life, and perhaps an apology.  While Guido clearly knows a lot of men...it is the women who have been important to him and who he has treated poorly throughout his life.  He remembers his mother, the village prostitute (very different than the village prostitute in AMARCORD), his many girlfriends, his wife, his sister, his current mistress.  They are all different.  He clearly has affection for them, and they mostly have some for him as well...but are frustrated, angry even tormented by his poor treatment.  They have offered him love, and he has given much less in return.

The story is intermixed with numerous odd fantasies that Guido has.  He imagines scenes such as living in a harem with all his women, who are happy to share his attention.  He remembers scenes from his life.  Each piece he conjures is like a little absurdist piece...ridiculous and revealing.  But Fellini has even filmed his ""normal"" scenes like some crazy dance sequence...camera swirling, voices coming from all directions, extreme close-ups.  So even Guido's ""real life"" feels dreamlike.  The spa is an odd place, apparently real, yet somehow fantastical in its operation.  The movie set being built for Guido is a huge launching pad for a spaceship...yet we get absolutely no idea how a travel into space has anything to do with the movie Guido is apparently creating.

8  explores (in my mind...I chose not to read any essays before throwing my thoughts out there) the crush of fame, as everyone around him is drowning Guido in their own demands.  It explores the psyche of a man who can't be faithful and/or can't return love.  It explores the creative process itself.  It's a film about a guy making a film about a guy who makes films.  Mastroianni is certainly a stand-in for Fellini himself...the film must surely by auto-biographical to some degree.  It feels too specific not to be.

The cinematography is splendid.  The editing feels way ahead of its 1963 time.  The performances all nicely balance realism and an over-the-top cartoonishness...suitable for the circus-like atmosphere of the proceedings.  The music is appropriately loud and insistent.  We sense Guido is in a pressure cooker, and all these loud, sweaty people, loud, brassy music and swirling cameras are keeping him off balance and ready to explode.  Even in his calmest moments, and there are many, Guido is thinking, thinking, thinking.  How will he meet the demands of those around him...and why should he?

The movie was admirable...yet for me it left me only bemused, not really entranced.  The character of Guido is simply too unlikeable.  He's charming as can be...but Guido (and thus, Fellini) is guilty of too much navel gazing and (as one character says near the end) assumes that people will find his life interesting.  Yes, Fellini is a beloved director and ground-breaking filmmaker...but exploring what a jerk he is and how tormented by his own fame is a bit of a bore.  I was unable to get through the film in one sitting...it took me three chunks of roughly 45 minutes to get to the end.  I feel dreadfully shallow saying this, especially about a film that is practically popping with energy and creativity.  But for me, the shallow philosophizing (really, just the director trying to excuse and ask forgiveness for piggish behavior) just doesn't make it compelling.

I viewed the Criterion Blu-Ray.  The picture is splendidly crisp.  Dialogue, strangely, often seemed slightly out of synch with the actors.  Not sure if this isn't from the original.  But the subtitles are HORRIFIC.  I've complained about Criterion's subtitles before...they insist on white subtitles even on black & white films, with little or no outlining of the letters.  This has been a pain before, but 8  has many scenes with significant swaths of white, and I found myself having to pause from time to time just to squint and read the subtitles.  Criterion does such a great job with so many other aspects of what they do...why for goodness' sake can't they do better with the all-important subtitles?

8  was worth seeing.  It's a classic and it's an important part of cinematic history...thus, I feel I've checked off a film on the list of ""you can't be a true movie buff if you haven't seen these films.""  Yet it felt a little too much like homework for me to give it a ringing endorsement.",1351900800,5,5803,4.82657200811359

Everyone is getting ready to film and the actors are all present but the character played by Marcello Mastroianni doesn't have a story much less a script.  He confronts his wife, his girlfriends, friends and others who are hanging on his every whim and desire for employment and success.  Only with his leading actress, Claudia Cardinale can he let his guard down and allow her to be in the driver's seat (literally).  The others cling to him as he tries to run away and not be bothered in order to think.  The idea comes to him at the last moment before production has shut down and in the face of a staunch critic who tells him that he was right not to try rather than to risk failure.  The effort of creativity, fear of its loss and the vision others have of the artist which can be positive or toxic to artistic talent is a large theme in this movie.

1646587,5,B00005QAPH,"The conventional wisdom is that Federico Fellini went wrong when he abandoned realism for personal fantasy; that starting with ""La Dolce Vita"", his work ran wild through jungles of Freudian, Christian, sexual and autobiographical images. The precise observation in ""La Strada"" was the high point of his career, according to this view, and then he abandoned his neorealist roots. ""La Dolce Vita"" was bad enough, ""8 1/2"" was worse, and by the time he made ""Juliet of the Spirits"", he was completely off the rails. Then all is downhill, in a career that lasted until 1987, except for ""Amarcord"", with its memories of Fellini's childhood; that one is so charming that you have to cave in and enjoy it, regardless of theory.

 This conventional view is completely wrong. What we think of as Felliniesque comes to full flower in ""La Dolce Vita"" and ""8 1/2."" His later films, except for ""Amarcord,"" are not as good, and some are positively bad, but they are stamped with an unmistakable maker's mark. The earlier films, wonderful as they often are, have their Felliniesque charm weighted down by leftover obligations to neorealism.

 The critic Alan Stone, writing in the Boston Review, deplores Fellini's ""stylistic tendency to emphasize images over ideas."" I celebrate it. A filmmaker who prefers ideas to images will never advance above the second rank because he is fighting the nature of his art. The printed word is ideal for ideas; film is made for images, and images are best when they are free to evoke many associations and are not linked to narrowly defined purposes. Here is Stone on the complexity of ""8 1/2"": ""Almost no one knew for sure what they had seen after one viewing."" True enough. But true of all great films, while you know for sure what you've seen after one viewing of a shallow one.

 ""8 1/2"" is the best film ever made about filmmaking. It is told from the director's point of view, and its hero, Guido, is clearly intended to represent Fellini. It begins with a nightmare of asphyxiation, and a memorable image in which Guido floats off into the sky, only to be yanked back to earth by a rope pulled by his associates, who are hectoring him to organize his plans for his next movie. Much of the film takes place at a spa near Rome, and at the enormous set Guido has constructed nearby for his next film, a science fiction epic he has lost all interest in.

 The film weaves in and out of reality and fantasy. Some critics complained that it was impossible to tell what was real and what was taking place only in Guido's head, but I have never had the slightest difficulty, and there is usually a clear turning point as Guido escapes from the uncomfortable present into the accommodating world of his dreams.

 Sometimes the alternate worlds are pure invention, as in the famous harem scene where Guido rules a house occupied by all of the women in his life--his wife, his mistresses, and even those he has only wanted to sleep with. In other cases, we see real memories that are skewed by imagination. When little Guido joins his schoolmates at the beach to ogle the prostitute Saraghina, she is seen as the towering, overpowering, carnal figure a young adolescent would remember. When he is punished by his priests of his Catholic school, one entire wall is occupied by a giant portrait of Dominic Savio, a symbol of purity in that time and place; the portrait, too large to be real, reflects Guido's guilt that he lacks the young saint's resolve.

 All of the images come together into one of the most tightly structured films Fellini made. The screenplay is meticulous in its construction--and yet, because the story is about a confused director who has no idea what he wants to do next, ""8 1/2"" itself is often described as the flailings of a filmmaker without a plan. ""What happens,"" asks a Web-based critic, ""when one of the world's most respected directors runs out of ideas, and not just in a run-of-the-mill kind of way, but whole hog, so far that he actually makes a film about himself not being able to make a film?"" But ""8 1/2"" is not a film about a director out of ideas--it is a film filled to bursting with inspiration. Guido is unable to make a film, but Fellini manifestly is not.

 Mastroianni plays Guido as a man exhausted by his evasions, lies and sensual appetites. He has a wife, chic and intellectual, who he loves but cannot communicate with, and a mistress, cheap and tawdry, who offends his taste but inflames his libido. He manages his affairs so badly that both women are in the spa town at the same time, along with his impatient producer, his critical writer, and uneasy actors who hope or believe they will be in the film. He finds not a moment's peace. ""Happiness,"" Guido muses late in the film, ""consists of being able to tell the truth without hurting anyone."" That gift has not been mastered by Guido's writer, who tells the director his film is ""a series of complete senseless episodes,"" and ""doesn't have the advantage of the avant-garde films, although it has all of the drawbacks.""

 Guido seeks advice. Aged clerics shake their heads sadly and inspire flashbacks to childhood guilt. The writer, a Marxist, is openly contemptuous of his work. Doctors advise him to drink mineral water and get rest, a lot of rest. The producer begs for quick rewrites; having paid for the enormous set, he insists that it be used. And from time to time Guido visualizes his ideal woman, who is embodied by Claudia Cardinale: cool, comforting, beautiful, serene, uncritical, with all the answers and no questions. This vision, when she appears, turns out to be a disappointment, but in his mind he transforms her into a Muse, and takes solace in her imaginary support.

 Fellini's camera is endlessly delighting. His actors often seem to be dancing rather than simply walking. I was interested to read that he played music during every scene. The music must have brought a lift and subtle rhythm to their movements. Of course many scenes have music built into them: In ""8 1/2,"" orchestras, dance bands and strolling musicians are seen, and the actors move in a subtly choreographed way, as if they're synchronized. Fellini's scores, by Nino Rota, combine snatches of pop tunes with dance music, propelling the action.

 Few directors make better use of space. One of his favorite techniques is to focus on a moving group in the background and track with them past foreground faces that slide in and out of frame. He also likes to establish a scene with a master shot, which then becomes a closeup when a character stands up into frame to greet us. Another technique is to follow his characters as they walk, photographing them in three-quarter profile, as they turn back toward the camera. And he likes to begin dance sequences with one partner smiling invitingly toward the camera before the other partner joins in the dance.

 All of these moves are brought together in his characteristic parades. Inspired by a childhood love of the circus, Fellini used parades in all his films--not structured parades but informal ones, people moving together toward a common goal or to the same music, some in the foreground, some farther away. ""8 1/2"" ends with a parade that has deliberate circus overtones, with a parade of musicians, major characters, and the grotesques, eccentrics and ""types"" that Fellini loved to cast in his films.

 I have seen ""8 1/2"" over and over again, and my appreciation only deepens. It does what is almost impossible: Fellini is a magician who discusses, reveals, explains and deconstructs his tricks, while still fooling us with them. He claims he doesn't know what he wants or how to achieve it, and the film proves he knows exactly, and rejoices in his knowledge.",1316995200,9,7733,4.745156482861401

1646591,5,B00005QAPH,"Guido is a director who can't make a film.  Meanwhile, he's the subject of a great film.  Others have given the story, so I won't recap it here.  I will say that watching the film as a woman is a strange experience. We are obviously supposed to identify with Guido for most of the movie, and yet his view of women is warped, as it is always filtered through two foundational experiences, linked to two senses: the bath and talcum powdering given to him by his mother while a child, which is associated with touch, and the dance of Saraghina, linked to sight.

He divides up the women in his life according to these experiences, with his wife (who is explicitly linked to his mother in more than one scene) standing for the sense of touch, while his mistress and most of the other women, are there for - in his mind - his visual pleasure.  While a child, he watched the prostitute Saraghina dancing on the beach and was caught and punished in his Catholic school.  This imprinted on his sexual self, and now desire is linked to shame for him.

The compass rose of his feelings toward women is the following: fear, disgust, longing, and desire.  Usually more than one will be present.  For his wife: fear and longing.  For his mistress: disgust and desire.  For Claudia, his ideal woman: longing and desire. His compass is always spinning around as he encounters other women. Note that love is not one of the options, but then again, neither is hate.  This is not a man who hates women, but also one who doesn't know how to love them.

Note too, that the verbal is missing from his two foundational experiences.  Sight and touch are key, but hearing and words are, for him, a sort of false arena of exchange, where lies are traded for lies in order to allow him to make films.  In his relationship with his wife, who he does long for (although I'm not sure he loves her), he is unable to speak to her in a real way, which drives her away from him due to his constant lies.  I really liked Luisa, Guido's wife, who is a strong character even in this very male-dominated movie.  The scene where Guido is showing his (awful) screen tests is a particularly interesting one, as it shows that Guido is being unfair and cruel to his wife. This scene is one of the few where I believe we're supposed to identify with someone other than Guido -i.e., with Luisa.  If the movie-in-a-movie is unfair, it opens up the possibility that Fellini knows that he has problems and issues with women.

The dance of Saraghina has many echoes in the film. Guido is constantly trying to control and reshape this experience, which showed the power of women over him. Note that Saraghina is older and shown almost as a giantess on film, as she would have seemed to the young Guido.  When he ""directs"" his mistress in fantasy play, he draws big eyebrows on her, like Saraghina had, and he says it's to make her look like a whore. In another long scene, he combines his two foundational experiences and has his wife, along with all the other women in his life, wash and powder him.  An old showgirl dances before them all.  This is a particularly cruel scene, and is another attempt to defuse the power of Saraghina's dance, as the old showgirl is old in a powerless way and her dance is grotesque.  In the end, she is sent upstairs with the other women who are too old for Guido's desire.  But because Saraghina's dance is imprinted on Guido's sexual template, no matter his treatment of other women, it cannot be contained and any victory over it will be a temporary one.

The ending is very powerful because at the very site of the failed transcendence of the spaceship scene from his failed movie, a scene of human collectivity is enacted.  All the characters come out holding hands, as in a parade, thus combining the senses of of touch and sight. Even his wife is connected to the whole, and we see a moment of togetherness.  And yet the secret of a happy ending is knowing where to stop, and the last shot of a lone performer suggests that when this moment is over, Guido will still be alone with his procrustean sexual scenarios.  But then again, he's been in one of the greatest movies ever, so art can redeem life, if only partly and imperfectly.",1292284800,12,4226,4.4603381014304295

1646606,5,B00005QAPH,"One of my top five films of all time.  I won't speak much about the film itself, under the assumption most readers have already seen it.  You can be guaranteed a fantastic film if you haven't seen this yet.

As far as the BD itself, the transfer is absolutely fantastic!  The DVD version itself already had a pretty pristine transfer, but of course with the BD upgrade the resolution and detail is so much better, and of course comes loaded with extras and an accompanying booklet that is actually quite thorough and should be considered an item in itself, and not just a supplement to the disc.

I haven't watched them all, but the extras that are bundled with the film are plentiful and quite informative.  Often times with extras you feel as though it is just filler and fodder (let's be honest, it usually is) but at least Criterion makes a conscious effort to make it interesting.  I'd say the extras are worthwhile, and also an upgrade from the DVD version.

The biggest difference I noticed from my first viewing is that the subtitles are slightly changed from the DVD version, and also theatrically.  There are probably lots of different translations, but it IS different from the DVD but not drastically.  The same point is made, but just using a different delivery.  Not sure how I feel about some of the changes, but I probably just got used to the previous translation.

I'm not sure where some of these discrepancies or complaints are coming from that have surfaced recently, but my copy was packaged in the special made Criterion jewel cases, NOT the cardboard ones, and of course not the actual blue ones.  For a while, with some of the earlier releases, Criterion was releasing its BDs in cardboard slip case and digi-pack format which angered a lot of customers who spoke their voice and got them to upgrade to the now standard jewel cases.  A good move in my opinion, but now I'm stuck with Third Man and 400 Blows in cardboard.  Reportedly, you can send in the old cases to get upgraded to new ones, but it'll cost you 5 bucks each, so...

Then there are his memories, which interweave with reality and are so indistinguishable from it that at times the viewer is uncertain what has really happened.  Much of it is bizarre and surrealistic, a collage of the unresolved, the loved, the pressing need, the hope.  It is all in Mastroianni's expression, which is impassive yet full.  Everything is grotesque yet understated and subtle.

He feels besieged, overwhelmed as so many people keep coming at him, and yet he tries to see his way forward.

1646610,5,B00005QAPH,"""The movie business is macabre.  Grotesque.  It is a combination of a football game and a brothel"".  Fellini, from the book Fellini on Fellini.

Round and round we go with this film, one of the greatest films ever made, one of my top 10 films, and arguably Fellini's greatest work, or close to it (La Dolce Vita is as good as this one).  It's the film where Fellini went into surrealism and dreams and never went back.  It's also one of the greatest films ever made about filmmaking and the artistic process.  Despite being a cinema person, I don't like films about the business, as they become so esoteric (especially films made about Hollywood) that they are far too ""inside"" for most.  The Hollywood films (especially ones of recent vintage) give the impression that only in Hollywood are there problems on film sets, and that making films is difficult.  Problems exist on all films sets.  That's life.  8 1/2 is not esoteric.  It's a universal film.

We see Guido, a famously successful film director, who is suffering from creative block, a ballooning budget on a film he doesn't want to make, martial problems, mistress problems, health problems, etc., etc..  At times, it's hard to tell what's real and what's imaginary, but you're ultimately not to supposed to know what's real and what's imaginary.  This causes much confusion at times, but it's supposed to be, and it works magically.  The film is really striking for many reasons.  Its excellent pace, wonderful, crisp photography, great performances, its unforgettable imagery, and one of the greatest endings in the history of cinema.

For those who don't know, Fellini called this 8 1/2 because, according to him, it was his ""8 1/2th"" film.  He co-directed his first film (which he counted as half), and made 7 features up until this one.  Despite being made over 40 years ago, the film hasn't dated and remains, rightfully so, on many greatest films ever made lists.",1230076800,,1931,4.829268292682927
1646611,4,B00005QAPH,"8 is suffused with the fictive childhood memories of Fellini's onscreen doppelganger, Guido Anselmi (Marcello Mastroianni), which- if the DVD experts on Fellini, and those I've scanned in gathering background information, are correct- are merely Fellini's own true memories transferred to film. They can result in some interesting themes and scenes for the film, but often, most manifestly in the Saraghina and Cardinal digressions, they make far too much of points that could more easily and poetically been conveyed onscreen. Both of these motivs waste a good twenty or more minutes of the film's running time....As for the famed narrative- or meta-narrative. Let me give a brief rundown of what 8 is about. The film opens with shots of 43 year old married filmmaker Guido Anselmi in a traffic jam. It is obviously a dream sequence- or is it a scene from the film that he is to make, the one this film is about? It is clearly a set piece, and after escaping from his car window, as if from the uterus, he takes to the air, and becomes a kite, pulled back down to earth by whom we later recognize as the filmic representatives of Claudia Cardinale (playing herself), the actress who is to star in Guido's film within this film. As he falls to earth he wakens at a health spa where he is recuperating from a breakdown of some sort, along with his screenwriter, a dense film critic named Daumier (Jean Rougeul). Outside the spa he has a vision of a virginal white clad goddess, also played by Claudia Cardinale- although she is a separate character from the Claudia Cardinale who later appears as an actress in 8. She manifestly represents an idealized vision of love and femininity to Guido. Daumier then criticizes Guido's ideas for his upcoming film as immature and self-indulgent, as Fellini obviously is striking the first blows for his film's claim to greatness.
  He then spots Mario Mezzabotta (Mario Pisu), an old friend who is squiring around a dark, sexy young American girl he intends to marry. Her name is Gloria Morin (Barbara Steele, Mario Bava's horror film diva). Guido then heads to the train station to meet his gauche and buffoonish married mistress Carla (Sandra Milo). He already regrets asking her to come, until that night they play a game of hooker and john, and she eagerly plays her naughty role to sexual perfection. Guido falls asleep and dreams of his parents at a cemetery, His father (Annibale Ninchi) is dead, and his mother (Guiditta Rissone) kisses him lasciviously, then pulls back to reveal it is his wife, Luisa (Anouk Aime). Later, Guido tries to avoid movie types and reporters who are after the story of what his next film will be about. Some entertainment ensues at the hotel, and Guido is reminded of a mysterious childish saying from his past, asa nisi masa. This nonsense phrase is the film's equivalent of Citizen Kane's Rosebud. How this all turns out is well known and detailed by others.
  Incidentally, there is some confusion over why the film is called what it is called. The truth is that the film's final title 8 refers to the number of films Fellini directed to that point- six features, two short () films, and his first film, half a feature, Luci del Varieta, which he co-directed with Alberto Lattuada, thus totaling 7 films. This was therefore his 8th film. As for the critical reception and continuing misconstruals this film receives, both positive and negative, it is easy to see why. Much of this confusion is recapitulated in the film's original title La Bella Confusione (The Beautiful Confusion). It is not clear whether or not this internal artistic confusion was genuine, in Fellini's case, but it does not matter to his puppet, Guido Anselmi, for intent is meaningless in art. The end result is all, always all. Thus, 8  is a weird mlange of Freudian pop nonsense (id, ego, superego), and Salvador Dal lite imagery, that badly dates the film intellectually. All of it is well handled, in beautiful black and white cinematography by Gianni de Venanzo, with an intriguing and well-placed musical score by Nino Rota, to enhance the artificiality of it all, but all the personal references, which in the film do little to enhance an understanding of Guido, even as they may lend obsessive critics insight into Fellini's life, drag the film down by its own overblown heft....8 improves with rewatching, but it's still too long, filled with clumsy satire- Saraghina and the Cardinal, pointless digressions, and the like.",1220486400,3,4482,4.85359477124183
1646612,5,B00005QAPH,"After 8 films, having acquired the status of an Italian icon (a much criticized one, of course, as with all Italian icons, which Italians - and Italo-Americans like me - take particular joy in tearing down) and overwhelming international fame, Fellini felt himself trapped, boxed in by demands and expectations and unable to create.  So he shattered the box, threw away his script and wrote this outrageous, self regarding, egoistic, surreal and utterly brilliant meditation on ....himself!  His predicament, his creative problems, his loves, his childhood, his aging, his fantasies.  As in the most famous scene, he takes the whip and makes the elements of his life dance around him... at least until he is overwhelmed.  And, for most folks, it works utterly.  You are swept away in the swirl of images and emotions, and willingly allow yourself to go along for the ride.  The world, as with most of the reviewers here, loved it.  After all, despite the relentlessly inward focus of the film, these concerns of life, love and aging are our own concerns, too.  His unforgettable images resonate with most of us.  Although not everyone is willing to go along for this particular ride, as attested to by the much smaller number of extremely negative reviews.  Hey, if you don't like the roller coaster, don't get on one!

But once you have taken such an extreme and self indulgent step - where do you go next?  Sadly, that is one problem which Fellini never solved.  After this, he mostly just made ""Fellini films"", repeating the same motifs and images that once seemed so daring, far past the point of self parody.  To be sure, there are some wonderful moments in ""Amarcord"" and ""Roma"".  In fact he rarely made a film without some things of real interest.  But never again was he anywhere near as consistently good, as much on the cutting edge of international film, as he was in the ten years from 1953 to 1963.

1646634,5,B00005QAPH,"Federico Fellini's `8 ' is a film about film.  It carries the very essence of art in it's most entrancing form and delivers a beautiful interpretation of the glories as well as the tragedies of creating that said art.  I think that may be why `8 ' is considered to be one of the finest films ever made, because it truly fleshes out the angels and demons involved in getting a directors vision off the ground.  It attacks the distress and anguish over desiring to create something meaningful and original without turning your good name into a disgrace by inventing a flop.  Thanks to a very strong and honest performance by Italian actor Marcello Mastroianni, `8 ' becomes something real and beautiful.

Mastroianni plays Guido Anselmi, an Italian director who is trying to escape pressure to start his next film.  While supposedly resting at a spa he finds himself bombarded by critics and producers and actresses, all wanting to know what his next film is going to be about, what their roles are going to be and when they can expect to start shooting.  The problem is that Guido can't decide what his next film should be about.  He wants to create something beautiful, something strong and meaningful but his ideas are not coming as richly as he would like.  Guido cannot seem to find solace outside of work with his wife and even his mistress giving him grief on a personal level and so Guido finds himself retreating into his mind, concocting dream sequences that prove to be the greatest inspiration for his next film.

It is also within these dreams that we come to know who Guido really his.  We see segments from his childhood, fictionalized to create a dream world in which he is free to explore the facets of his life that helped shape the man, the director, the artist that he is today.  To me, the opening scene alone is what defines the final feeling I was left with at the movies end.  The scene, involving Guido trapped inside a car filling with fumes, cars surrounding him at all sides, his constant screams and pleadings going unanswered, unnoticed even express the struggle one has to undergo in order to create their vision; pressure building from all sides to conform and sell-out and give in to the demands of others.

The acting here is superb, truly elevating this film to masterpiece levels of greatness.  Marcello Mastroianni is marvelous as Guido, really getting into his soul and fleshing out his ever feeling; from distress and desperation to a giddy gleefulness that comes from becoming a part of his vision.  Anouk Aimee is effective as Luisa, Guido's troubled wife.  Her face reads many layers of pain and heartache.  Sandra Milo is superbly cast as Carla, Guido's mistress.  She is charming and funny and full of life; a nice contrast to the cold etched on Mastroianni's face.  Claudia Cardinale is a dream as Guido's muse Claudia, an actress who tends to be almost too demanding for Guido's taste.  Barbara Steele is intriguing as Gloria, the fiance of Guido's good friend Mario and Mario Pisu is impressive as that good friend.  All involved, the ones mentioned as well as each and every other supporting actor, are wonderfully cast and only add to the films greatness.

What I love about `8 ' is the fact that it allows the audience to appreciate what goes into creating the films we all love to watch.  In fact, I think that `8 ' is a film that any lover of film must witness for it completes the obsession so-to-speak, giving us a chance to live the life of the ones responsible for giving us these gifts in film.  It has been noted that `8 ' is somewhat of an autobiographical film for Fellini, and it truly possesses an honesty that could only come from experience.  As the film draws to a close one is forced to face the fear of creating something below you, while confronting the heartbreak that comes from abandoning something you truly treasure because of fear of outside interpretation.

I couldn't help but see a likeness to Woody Allen when watching this movie.  It had that same sort of dramedy vibe that Allen seems to capture (granted I have not seen a lot of Allen's films but it's undeniable the similarities).  The film never seems dated or irrelevant.  The rich black and white tones are beautifully captured and displayed for the audience, and the cinematography, score and set design (including the costumes) are all top notch.  `8 ' could have been made last year, it is that beautifully constructed.  Rightfully winning the Oscar for Best Foreign Film (and rightfully garnering Fellini a directing nomination), `8 ' is one of the greatest films I've had the pleasure of witnessing.  Named by many as one of the top 50 films of all time, I truly feel that `8 ' is actually one of the most important films of all time, for it allows the public to crawl inside their obsession with film and understand the makings of cinema all to a greater degree.",1210896000,2,4901,4.661627906976745

I will refrain from repeating the praise and reiterating Fellini's motivation behind making this film and simply explain what made this movie a joy for me, personally:  This was my first Fellini film and it was an absolute pleasure to watch.  As an artist myself, and having an appreciation for films and the creative process as a whole, I found this film to be inspiring, humorous and unique.  I admire Fellini's ability to carefully weave dream, memory, and the ""present"" so cohesively and with such fluidity - it's a great juggling act that is masterfully crafted and eye opening to experience.  I respect Fellini for the honesty and for the soul he has poured into this film - and furthermore, I appreciate his masterful ability to express it.  If you love film, if you love art, if you love the creative process and want to watch a movie that beautifully celebrates the magic of creation itself, I could not recommend this movie more.",1209427200,,1027,4.806818181818182
1646637,5,B00005QAPH,"I remember a time around jr. high school when there was a spate of kids writing homework papers about how they couldn't write the paper. They always had a ring of authenticity and sometimes some humor but usually very little else.  This movie is about a film director who is making a movie about not being able to make a movie.  The difference here is obviously that Fellini is a genius and his creative effort turns out to be splendidly brilliant and entertaining unlike those jr high school papers.

There's so much to say about it.  It's like life--where do you approach it?  Obviously some folks won't like it and that's understandable and fine.  No one likes everything. For those who want a linear plot and everything spelled out for them, forget it. For those who can let go of logic for a little while, ascend into a space where  where dreams and reality, the past and present intermingle, this film can be deeply rich and satisfying.

I saw it when it came out and was dazzled.  In those days, style was big in my book and this film had all of the elements that impressed me and my friends. It's always a risk for me to re-view those films that I fell in love with so long ago...sort of like meeting a first love  again in middle age...will he still charm? This film stood the test.  I was still wildly entertained by the surface beauty but this time I think I understood the basic story a little better.  It's part of the value of this film that there is more to it than style. It has psychological and social validity as well.

I won't recount the story as so many others here have done that.  A psychiatrist could have a field day analyzing Guido's neuroses. I did actually have a hard time believing the final resolution--it seemed to come a little too easily after the long ""display"" of the problem.  But what comes across, finally, is the joy of it all.  Fellini may escape into a dream world to avoid his adult commitments but he does come back again...just like Guido escaped from his car up into the stratoshere, but was pulled down by the cord tied to his ankle.  We are asked to believe that these descents or ascents into his dreamworld have helped him to resolve his conflicts.

There is a very touching interview included on the second disk with Sandra Milo, who plays Guido's mistress in the film.  She was Fellini's mistress for 17 years and her comments are not to be missed.  I don't know if Fellini's actual conflicts were resolved as Guido's seem to be, in the film.  But the joy and beauty of the film along with the honesty of the self-revelation give this great magic.

Some of my favorite scenese are those remembrances from Guido's childhood-- like playing in the wine vat and then  being adoringly wiped off by the loving mama.  And the unforgettable scene on the beach of the schoolboys jumping up and down for joy as the town prostitute does the rhumba.  The sheer exuberance and joy of these scenes make the film worth watching.  And the music...!! I give it 8 1/2 stars!",1208390400,3,3009,4.475229357798165

But, make no mistake, 8 1/2 is an amazing movie; and, even though you may not understand everything, that does not make the film ""bad"". Some movies take patience, maybe even some research, and sometimes a few more viewings, before the viewer can fully appreciate what the director is trying to accomplish. Some of my favorite movies I hated the first time I watched them. Yet, I gave those movies another try because I thought that I must have overlooked something,  that for some reason I was not glimpsing the true vision of the Director.
Most people want to see movies that they have already seen. Many movies are just repeat plot tricks, with the same characters and heros and anti-heros.

Yet, time and again it's an irresistible lure... the grand tell-off tell-all that creative people can't resist. It always stinks, and this wasn't really an exception. Things are constantly ""told"" rather than shown... from politics, to philosophy, to love, this is more of a director's essay disguised as a story, than a story. Fellini throws in lively dream sequences, and tries to doll the whole thing up as a righteous attempt at clearing the skeletons out of his personal closet by blurring the lines of film and barely disguised confession. Yet, like any artistic adventure so audacious, in the end you feel a little sick that he felt the need to share so personally and so indifferently to the fact people might rather see a good plot, than the weak wailing of his self-abased soul.

For all that, the movie is rather beautiful sometimes, just in looks and music. I'm just at a loss as to where people think this even a ""great"" piece of art though. The revelations in it are nothing if not weak, and ""The Director"" in the fictional sense seems to make out ok in the end without truly atoning for a lifetime of treating his women like garbage.",1186963200,7,1376,4.658436213991769

1646664,4,B00005QAPH,"Unfortunately, for the most part 8 left me cold, one of those films where you get what is being done but it's just not on your wavelength. It's pointless to complain about it being hit-and-miss or confused, since erratic confusion is the nature of the beast as Fellini becomes possibly the first man to film his own nervous breakdown (or at very least his crisis of creativity). In many ways the turning point in Fellini's career where fantasy and grotesquery would become an increasing part of increasingly disjointed phantasmagorias with a design style as cluttered as a tart's dressing table, there are moments that strike home and the latter scenes with his wife and with Claudia work because there's a sense of self-awareness of Fellini's limitations not just as an artist but as a human being. But overall I was just left with the feeling that I'd got on the wrong train by mistake.

(Incidentally, to strike a timely note, it's amusing to note that the producer's brainless bimbo girlfriend is the spitting image of Paris Hilton!)

It's a shame Criterion's otherwise excellent 2-disc DVD couldn't locate the deleted sequences, although they are represented in the excellent stills galleries.

1646666,5,B00005QAPH,"I wrote originally wrote this as a comment on one of the negative reviews, but thought it might be beneficial to expand it and post as a review in its own right:

I can understand why this movie might appear pretentious....  I'm not saying it's especially esoteric, but because the method of expression contrasts with traditional film-making it can appear pretentious until you get the feel for it.  This isn't something that requires special technical knowledge, it just has to be developed intuitively---once you get it, it's like ""ah-hah!"" and it suddenly seems very down-to-earth and human.

This film doesn't follow traditional narrative structure, it is more a series of vignettes or impressions that relate to Fellini's improvisational and personal style.  I can still understand why someone might not relate to Fellini himself, but that doesn't render his art worthless.  It is a highly personal, accurate, and outstanding expression of his self, and that is why it is great--- not because of the hype that has been forever associated with Fellini's films and larger-than-life persona.

This film represents a good place to start if one wished to begin understanding other works of art that make use of subjective or surrealist methods in their presentation.  I think some David Lynch films use a very similar technique, though applied to specific characters which are not strictly auto-biographical.

8 1/2, does a very good job of blending subjectivity and ""objectivity"" throughout.  It is an interesting portrait of a person's psyche---his psyche shapes his reality, and vice versa.  In this light, every person's reality is truly their own, though I can't know if Fellini really intended to make any larger implications such as these.  Fellini knows himself best, his own bank of experiences and perceptions form the basis of the content.  All great art is highly personal like this, whether it admits to it or not.

It is important to stress that this is not a film that makes use of dynamic narrative tensions.  It has basically one situation:  the main character.  It explores that one situation as fully as possible--- all of the things that make him who he is and in turn shape the way he perceives and approaches his circumstance.  The film is highly unique in the skill with which it does so, and the loose, almost improvisational nature of this film-making is suited to presenting its subject.

Relying on circumstance to intervene in the creative process allows aspects to manifest that could not have if he were trying to write a film of this nature.  Subconscious and unintentional aspects could reveal themselves, giving the film a psychological weight that contributes to the feeling of personal depth.  These aspects may not be picked up consciously by the viewer except on repeated viewings...this is what I mean when I say you have to develop an intuitive feel for the way these kinds of films work.

Until you develop that feel and understanding, more emotional than intellectual, these and other films (like those of the aforementioned David Lynch) will just appear pretentious.  I do not deny that there are a lot of folks who act like they understand these kinds of movies more than they do, contributing to the pretentious vibe.

There can still be differences of opinion in terms of interpretation, but the essence of the film is not intellectual---varying interpretations can simultaneously be accurate given the layers of ambiguity and complexity that great minds (and subsequently great works) possess.  People and works with one simplistic message are not nearly as compelling.",1172016000,4,3615,5.0864406779661016

The sheep can't bleat their loyalty to received judgement fast enough. After two viewings, I have found nothing of value in 8 1/2. This movie consists of glamourous Italians going here and there talking about_nothing_, with occasional surrealistic hallucinations interspersed.

1646669,5,B00005QAPH,"Federico Fellini's ""8 1/2"" is considered by many to be one of the best films ever made, but has a large amount of haters too. It's not hard to see why, even if you love the film. It mixes fantasy and reality, sometimes jumping from one to the other with little-to-no warning. Some critics have even complained they couldn't tell what parts of the movie were fantasy and reality, which I think is actually kind of stupid...I knew exactly what was and what wasn't. I think it'll be hard for people to not acknowledge that this is a great film. It's not one of the most entertaining movies I've seen, but it's wonderfully photographed and has some classic moments. Visuals definitely overrule plot in the film. The movie opens in a very trippy dream sequence. Our main character, Guido (Marcello Mastroianni), dreams that he suffers asphxia in his car and then is suddenly floats into the sky; Before being pulled down via a rope by one of his associates. Namely his screenwriter. The movie is basically like this; Guido is a director who wants to make a movie, a good movie to be precise. Problem is, he's ran out of ideas and is stuck directing a science-fiction movie he has no interest in. Meanwhile, he juggles an affair with his mistress and his wife; He's not good at it. In one scene, his wife and mistress end up at the same place together. But, looking away from plot for a second, there's one scene that stands out among all others in my head. There's a flashback scence, where Guido, as a young boy, and his schoolmates go to the beach to watch the prostitute Saraghina. This scene plays almost like a silent film. She, basically, dances for the sex-crazed young boys; But it's not the dance itself, but the music on the soundtrack that she's dancing too. Neither one of these would factors would be of much importance, but it's the combination of them that makes the scene so great. It's very surreal and just really well done. I've only seen this film once, but I'm already curiously eager to see it again. It's not like any movie I've ever seen before; The ending, especially, fits the film so well. A lot of people won't like it; It's in Italian, lots of fantasy sequences, etc. But this is a great film. Most critics, most filmmakers, Roger Ebert, and myself agree. See this film.

1646670,5,B00005QAPH,"My favorite aspect of Fellini's films was that there was  never a shortage of beautiful women and 8 and half(Otto e Mezzo) is of no exception. The scene I enjoy watching repeatedly is of Guido in his fantasy mind with all the women of his life- past and present; from his childhood nannies to Carla his current mistress. The women frolic and giggle whorishly, playing a catch and tame game as Guido cracks his whip. All of Guido's inner fantasies and desires fulfilled, yet he is missing his inner peace and fulfillment of being happy with his wife. We visit Guido's childhood and see glimpses of his strict Catholic upbringing. Guido's escapades with the Saraghina, the town whore who lives in a tiny hut on the beach. Saraghina dances for Guido and his fellow school boys to the dismay of their priest headmasters; as Saraghina is the diablo(devil).

  My favorite Fellini film is ""Juliet of the Spirits""- 1965 and the first one that I saw of his films around 1989 or 1990. As Fellini fans know this was his first color movie. These two films are akin to each other as they share simular storylines and the main character stepping in and out of reality and into their fantasy world to cope with the bitter realities of life.

  Anouk Aimee makes a return appearance as Guido's wife. She was in his previous film ""La Dolce Vita"", as Maddelena the bored Rome socialite. Sandra Milo who plays Carla, the mistress who's vying for Guido's attention and every moment. Sandra Milo also potrays Suzy, the head of a bordello style household in ""Juliet of the Spirits"" and befreinds Juliet, played by the real life Mrs. Fellini, Giulietta Messina. The beautiful Claudia Cardinale as Guido's muse and actress he obsessively desires sexually and desperately wants to cast in his next film which never comes to fruition. Barbara Steele as the young fling of a disolving marriage of Mario, an old freind Guido bumps into at the resort he's staying at in order to get those creative juices flowing for a screenplay. Barbara Steele played the doctor who tries to help rid Barnabas Collins of his vampirism in the prime time revival of ""Dark Shadows"" on NBC in the late 80's. Mario Pisu and Catarina Borato are from his stable of actors he utilizes in his films.

  I suggest If you're a new comer to Fellini, watch ""La Dolce Vita"",""8 and half"", and ""Juliet of the Spirits"". He was on a streak of excellence from the late 50's through the mid to late 60's.",1158105600,4,2441,4.655813953488372

I understood the plot, and enjoyed some of the thoughts raised near the end, but overall was bored silly by stilted, pointless dialogue.

Having said that, the cinematography was stunning and the music almost made the film worth watching.  Perhaps 8 1/2 would have been better off as a series of photographs with musical accompaniment :P.",1151971200,14,492,4.891566265060241
1646672,5,B00005QAPH,"First time I saw 8 1/2 over twenty years ago; I did not like it then and I did not care much for a confused director who did not know how to make his next movie or how to deal with all women in his life. This time it was different. I knew it from the opening scene, from the first sounds of Nino Rota's music. I wanted to know how Guido would balance the demands of his producers and the insecurities of his love life. I sometimes barely could tell the difference between the reality and Guido's surfing the waves of his memory or building the Utopias in his mind where things were exactly the way he wanted them to be - and I really did not want to tell the difference. I just was there, following Guido on his journey where Fellini sent us. Then, that scene came, ""La Saraghina's"" lurid dance on the beach. There was something in that scene that made me return to it over and over again. What was it? The dancing woman was not young, pretty or graceful. On the contrary, she was fat and ugly but there was something about her - that smile, resilience, the promise of joy that attracted eager schoolboys. It was a last time the young Guido felt happy without guilt and shame that inevitably came after the encounter and stayed with him forever; he learned that joy and punishment are inseparable...

There have been fewer than a handful of films that affected me as profoundly as 8  did:

Tarkovsky's ""Zerkalo"" - when the master holds the mirror in front of you that reflects his soul and mind, open you eyes and heart, don't say a word, just watch closely.

Tarkovsky's ""Andrey Rublev"" - What is talent? Is it a God's gift or Devil's curse? Is an Artist free in choosing what to do with that gift?

Bergman's ""Persona"" - How far can one individual go in opening his soul to the other without losing identity and sanity?

Fellini's -""Nights of Cabiria"" - ""Dum Spiro - Spero"" - While there's life there's hope.

In 8 , Fellini explored all these subjects and in the final he took the idea of life and hope ever further: after all the characters in his film disappear from the screen, all what left behind is ""a little orchestra of Hope with Love as its conductor"". The last that we hear is the magic music of Rota, bringing affirmation, hope and love.

Simply wonderful. Perhaps, one of five greatest films ever made.",1151020800,4,2317,4.384615384615385
1646683,5,B00005QAPH,"Or maybe more precisely, a daydream. A man is stuck in heavy traffic. Not a car is moving. It's utter gridlock. It appears that most everyone in close proximity is deeply focused on him, with the exception of a car or two and in short order, his car begins to fill with smoke. He begins to choke and tries to escape the car but cannot. He struggles with the latches, but has to crawl out a window. Then he proceeds to float above the gridlocked traffic and into the sky, where he notices a rope tied to his ankle and a man below is basically flying him like a kite. The man is actually trying to pull him to the ground. The man in the sky reaches to liberate his leg from the rope, wishing to float away free. But the dream ends.

Guido is a mollycoddled famous director who we find, in the beginning of the film, being pampered and who's ""well being"" is being scrutinized by a room full of attendants. I'm tempted to do a straightforward account as if this were a simpler film, but 8 1/2 is a film about the making of a film and simultaneously, what seems to be, a real-time documentary about said film about a film. But I don't think that's complex enough. A fourth dimension to add might be the context of Fellini's actual life is being played out above and beyond that. Fellini does a pretty fine job at intertwining those threads, with an emphasis on his self-examination. He lays it all out there. He may have benefited more from a Freudian examination.

The tortured and eternally frustrated director seems to be at a crossroads in his career. He's on the cusp of his biggest film to date. The only problem is he doesn't seem to be inspired or motivated to make it. He seems willing to play the roll of director, but hardly seems to enjoy getting his hands dirty anymore. All day, everyday, he carries a pained look on his face as he has to fend off his anxious producer or evade countless wanna-be actors or has-been actresses. It doesn't help that the perfect lead actress isn't the one he's been seeing behind his wife's back. On top of juggling his mistresses (of which he's alternately tired and inspired to do), he's constantly getting his ass kissed by staff who have relatives sprouting from everywhere to get in on the film. It begins to pain him to have to meet with his staff, his producers, or longtime friends in the industry who find it difficult to associate with Guido because ""he's changed"".

What's amazing about 8 1/2 is that it's extraordinarily well thought out and meticulously planned. For all the soul searching going on and questions being raised, the film uses Guido's past and several delusional/male fantasies to answer them. Just as a something to ponder comes up, it's addressed. After all, it his his film. But, as segmented and, dare I say, somewhat dissatisfying as that aspect is, it comes off as clever and insightful. I love how Guido seems to always be in a state of reflection, but at the same time, he conducts himself as though the past doesn't exist. He comes off quite self-centered and arrogant; which to those around him choose to accept as charm. But his closest friends & family have become weary of Guido's childish exploits. In a twisted sort of way, I think that's what motivates and inspires him.

Those first few minutes of 8 1/2, in my opinion, is essentially the entire film encapsulated in dream form. I found that fascinating. For the entire movie to be fully effective though, it might have dispensed with what I consider to be an ending that may have appeared to be the allocution the film built up to, but was actually as evasive and nonchalant as Guido was to his wife. I believe his wife was the voice of reason in the film, but was once again, patronized and handed a bill of goods from her husband. Which makes his revelation all the more disingenuous. The journey of Guido (Fellini) into absolution has him remaining the self-centered person he truly is and at the risk of losing his marriage and career, conjures up a moment of lucidity to pacify his wife's contempt. It would be a beautiful thing indeed if it wasn't just a defense mechanism which only enables Guido's ego. Sadly, his revelation is for the benefit of himself, and maybe also for his adoring audience. The irony is, that I didn't (or wouldn't have) expected anything less. How could I?

A brilliant and deep film that is resolute and steadfast with it's content, but can surely mean many different things depending on the viewer.",1147392000,8,4467,4.550995024875622

1646685,5,B00005QAPH,"This movie is about as tiring and confused as the narrator/protagonist. Just like him we know his project is doomed, but we can't do anything about it until he does something about it, so we plod along with him and hope that maybe someone else will work it out for him.

It's a very intimidating film, I think even moreso for filmmakers. It represents just the fear they have, where they want to express something but have no idea how to do it, so try to pass off a bunch of vague and insubstantial images as a plot for a while until other people start getting serious about what's needed to be put in it to make it actually a film. In that way it's a lot like Adaptation, except Adaptation makes it colorful and zany in a twisted way while this makes it pretty dark and brooding. Both films are brilliant, if for no other reason in that I can't believe it actually worked out.

In fact, one thing that's amazing about this film is that I didn't feel like I was watching Fellini (like how in Adaptation I felt I was watching Charlie Kaufman). Despite the inherent self-reflexiveness of having a movie about movies, this one didn't seem to bring attention to the camera or exposition at all, instead making the ""movie within a movie"" moments a product of the antihero's film-centric imagination (how his dreams are filled with set pieces, rigid cutting, and silent, visual aura while the real moments in the film are filled with sound, other people moving, longer, more flowing takes, and less dance numbers.) It also is very interesting to follow the supporting characters, how they all seem to have wives you never see and mistresses you see all the time, how they all do their thing without knowing what they're supposed to do, all because that's all they know how to do, and how they invest themselves with the director and he just pushes them aside. Then with all the introductions to women who want parts, the whole melange of faces and bodies all trying to get something out of nothing... it's a very exhausting film.

But that's what it's trying to express, so it's amazing. I love the obvious and yet completely profound images of stuff like ""The set built on sand"" and ""I need to include everything to express nothing."" Good stuff.

1646686,5,B00005QAPH,"Federico Fellini's deeply personal account of a film director (himself, played by Marcello Mastroianni) who at the start of a new picture finds himself dried up. In a wonderful blend of reality, flashback, and pure fantasy (the last two sometimes indistinguishable) we explore the director's dilemma: actors and actresses are waiting for auditions; the producer hounds him; his writer (actually his alter ego) keeps telling him the script is empty and pointless, the project a waste of time (this ironic character, played by Jean Rougeul, is a marvelous creation). Also there is his wife (Anouk Aimee), who no longer can stand his philandering.

The flashbacks/fantasies are very funny, especially the one in which he imagines all the women in his life make up a willing harem. The only fault with the movie is the last five minutes where Mastroianni concludes he can't procrastinate any longer, and that making pictures is his life and he must get on with it regardless of the failures: it's all much too preachy and cheap. Actually, the movie should have ended in the car with Rougeul lecturing him on the uselessness of his work: that would've been perfect. Anyway, the movie is packed with great ideas and beautifully filmed images. Definitely worth a watch.",1137196800,2,1262,5.038277511961723
1646687,4,B00005QAPH,"This review is for the 2001 Criterion DVD.

The movie '8-1/2' is allegedly an ""artistic"" autobiography of Federico Fellini's life as a director.  The essence of the film is that a director named Guido (Marcello Mastroianni) has started making a movie but has lost his creative energy.  As a means of finding inspiration, Guido goes to an Italian health spa but is still tormented by his producer, auditioning actors and even an intellectual critic who all put great demands on Guido's time, energy and thought.  Guido escapes his peers by having an affair with a trashy mistress in another part of town but is later joined by his embittered wife a few days afterward.

The movie has plenty of abstract allegories, childhood flashbacks, present day issues and even some very restrained sexual fantasies about women.  The movie reveals that Guido is torn in so many directions.  When he has an affair, he is immediately conflicted as a Roman Catholic, as a husband, and as a son of morally upstanding parents.  We also see where his infidelity has damaged his marriage - perhaps beyond repair.  Finally, he also finds that the perfect woman doesn't turn out of be perfect after all.  Eventually the film becomes a movie within a movie.  He wants to make an honest film but is so saturated in the conflict and tormoil of life.  Guido finally liberates himself when he realizes that the beautiful confusion of life is what needs to be celebrated on film.

The movie at times is difficult to follow - especially since much of the abstract artistry is so ambiguous.  But I found the characters very engrossing and early 1960's Italy a fascinating and fashionable setting.  The most of the women in this movie are very beautiful and alluring while the rest had immeasurable entertainment value.  The men are typically very animated and complex.  I was never bored with any of the scenes, but as an art film, I can't say that I was inspired or moved by this picture.  I thoroughly enjoy the energy  of the Italian culture and this film certainly revealed much of it.  The B&W cinematography was top-notch and the music has typically festive and quite enjoyable.  This is a movie that is clearly not for everyone and I'll be the first to admit that on an artistic level I think it's just OK for me.  But at the same time, I think this is a movie everyone needs to experience just once to have some appreciation and understanding for Italian neo-realism films.  I've watched this movie now five times and I still get new insights with each viewing.  The commentary is somewhat helpful but at times does not fully explain Fellini's true intent of some of the artistic episodes.  Perhaps, that's the way he intended it - to mean what you want it to mean.

The DVD is a stunning B&W widescreen transfer and the sound is excellent.  There are plenty of extras in this double DVD package.  As usual, Criterion did a superb job.

The hardest thing for any director to do is make the film following their big hit because one always feels they have to top it. La Dolce Vita (1960) was Fellini's awakening to the world of international cinema, and he was left bemused on what his next project should be. So in one of the boldest and most brilliant moves in cinema history Fellini made a film about the troubles of making that film. 8 1/2 is full of nice imagery, both real and surreal, and the inner emotions of the director come flying out in wonderous scene after scene. The human psyche has never been shown so artistically, and Fellini is able to balance the outrageous moments with more quiet moments in the film to create a thoroughly engrossing, dramatic, and fantastic film masterwork.",1129334400,,827,4.63265306122449

1646713,4,B00005QAPH,"Federico Fellini's cinema displays one of the most mysterious and influential styles at the same time, modern filmmakers such as David Lynch owe a lot to the italian director. With ""8 1/2"" happens something very interesting, there are some scenes that are almost incomprehensible, but they are very interesting to see, because since the movie offers few explanations, the audience must be thinking most of the time, trying to solve the puzzle, so ""8 1/2"" requires an active audience.

The cast is very good, the obvious mentions are Marcello Mastroianni and the gorgeous actress Claudia Cardinale, but Anouk Aime (as Luisa, the central character's wife) is another highlight in the cast. ""8 1/2"" presents some of Fellini's trademarks: there are a lot of surreal scenes that look like a complicated dream, or a nightmare if you wish. The use of the camera is very artistic and groundbreaking. And the pace is slow, but captivating.

From the opening scene, a mysterious and beautiful dream-like sequence, to the final scene, ""8 1/2"" is an intelligent and insightful movie. Fellini carefully introduces the viewer inside the mind and thoughts of Guido, his fears, passions and insecurities, making Guido a very complex character.

1646714,5,B00005QAPH,"How does one begin to talk about 8 1/2? Every frame in this film could be put in a frame and hung on a wall. But it is not just the most brilliantly vivid visual film I've seen, it is indeed brilliantly conceived from beginning to end as well.

Guido is a film director who is struggling with his latest film. He's dealing with inner conflict - how to make a film with complex ideas come across simplistically so anybody can understand it - but also conflict with just about everyone else who is involved in the film, from actors to producers to professional Catholic consultants. On top of all of this, his wife knows that he's unfaithful and their relationship is ready to implode (or explode).

The plot is simple. The execution is complex, as director Federico Fellini shifts freely between the real and surreal, mixing and matching the outer world of Guido with the inner, in order to draw the viewer into the madness that is filmmaking.

I won't pretend to have understood everything that happened in the movie, and I'm not sure I would still pick up on everything after five or ten viewings, but I think the film works as an experience that doesn't necessarily need to make complete sense. In fact, it probably works better if some things don't make any sense at all.

8 1/2 gets a recommendation to anybody with any interest in film. It is an entirely unconventional way to tell a story that would be conventional in the hands of a lesser filmmaker. Fellini is known as one of the great directors for a reason.",1110153600,3,1518,4.529197080291971

1646716,5,B00005QAPH,"hello people of amazon,

this will be maybe too personal what i will write.

this movie is an absolutely transcendental meditation, like a dream, a unique masterpiece, one needs to see it a few times at least to be able to capture the deepness there. like a very nice song you want to listen many times again and again, this movie is something like this. each time you see it you realize a new point, you recognize a new detail in it. you discover that some camera movements, some details you had skipped and did not even recognize previously gain importance when you see the movie again and again.

this is in one hand a disadvantage for the spectator beacuse one needs to have a deep concentration on the movie while watching it which is not easy always. i guess in general there are some prequisites -should i say unfortunately maybe- for the spectators to sit down to watch some of the Fellini, Visconti,  Antonioni, Bergman, Pasolini movies (we might name many great art cinema directors as well). 8 1/2 is without any doubt a very good exaple in this context.

the dream scene in the beginning was so nice and impressive but still personally i found the ""asa nisi masa"" scene absolutely fantastic. some people associate this scene with Jung's ""anima"" (a-sa ni-si ma-sa) theory thinking that Fellini in fact did mean something really beyond. again more personally for me, the camera movements, the zooming into the picture on the wall and zooming out into the face of the little girl, the absolutely great music chosen there, the old lady and her conversations with the children, the discrete images of the burning fire, the woman entering a door all seem irrelevant, however in fact put-together as a whole they serve to complete the plot(s) of the movie. Fellini invites you into his dreams, shares them with you and makes you dream wtih him together.

a great movie, a must see for the people who love cinema.",1103241600,9,1917,4.673590504451038
1646717,5,B00005QAPH,"Wow.  Wow.  Double Wow.  I was unsure what I was about to indulge myself in when I first picked up this film.  Foreign, Fellini, and Oscar were all that I knew about this mythological film.  I had read about it in books, read reviews of it on top ten lists, but never found myself in the same room as it.  I wanted to see this so passionately that when it arrived I immediately popped it into my player and began watching it.  What I witnessed was like a drug on the brain.  The images, the story, the sheer brilliance and force behind the crafty eye of Fellini brought me deeper into this film than any other I have seen.  This is not easy for me to say because I have seen tons of films in my lifetime, but this film really takes the cake.  The brilliant black and white photography, the powerful ear-gobbling music, and the acting - Marcello Mastroianni controls this film.  You cannot seem to get your eyes off his scenes.  All of these elements create an innovative, provocative film based loosely on the life of Fellini, but also about the competitive and dragging world of film creation.

From the opening scene, the tone is set in this film.  As we see Guido (Mastroianni) trying to escape a smoking car while nobody tries to help, we are captured.  The senses are heightened, and claustrophobia sets in and never leaves throughout the rest of the film.  Fellini has trapped us into this character and is beginning our roller-coaster ride known as Guido's life.  As we meet the rest of the characters, that looming claustrophobia continues to stay with us.  We add to this grab bag of emotions the struggle that Guido has with women, the stress pressures of completing a film that he has no clue how to start.  The only idea he has deals with a large structure that seems to keep the producers at bay.  Couple with this his struggling childhood memories of women and the angry power of his wife.  It is hard not to be involved with Guido throughout the course of this film because of these intense emotions that Fellini has fed to us.

Outside of the emotional aspects of this film, it is beautifully directed.  Fellini pulls no stops (nor does Criterion) in the creation of this film.  The music, the actors, and even the beauty of the random, chaotic scene works to perfection everytime.  This is not a film you can sit down and enjoy once, it is definitely one that needs to be played over and over again.  In the film Sideways, Giamatti's character talks about wine being ""never the same each time you drink it"".  Each sip produces a new flavor and even if you open another bottle of the same, it may not be able to replicate the same exact taste.  That is how I feel about this film.  The first time I watched it, I was oblivious to the surroundings and the sub-stories.  I was so engulfed with Guido that I couldn't keep my eyes off him.  If I were to watch 8  again, focusing on a different aspect, I am sure to see a different film than I originally saw.  That is the greatness of Fellini, he directs so that each time you watch you are constantly seeing something new.  I saw that with his film Juliet of the Spirits as well.  I am not as voiced in Fellini as I should be, but these two films have proved that I need to see more and more of his work.

Finally, I would like to say that I enjoyed this film for a direct reason.  You don't see this technique used in many Hollywood films today, and I think that is why it caught my eye in Fellini's masterpiece.  You could be sitting in a room full of friends and family, and honestly each person in the room (as the final credits ran) would say that they saw a different film than what you thought.  It is like going into an art museum for the first time.  You can all look at the same visions, but it is how you perceive these visions that makes it a great piece of art.  Fellini did this with 8 .  I don't know if it was on purpose, or if he had a direct vision for some of the scenes, but when it was done there were several different thoughts about this film.  I guess what I am trying to say is that it creates conversation.  This isn't a film that you sit down, watch, and walk away without a word muttered through your lips.  This is a piece of art that will remain in your mind long after the film is over, causing questions to arise days, weeks, months after viewing.  I still ask questions about Guido's dream where the women from his past and present all live in the same house as him.  It is so deep and beautiful that it erupts with conversation daily.  I find that a great tool for grading films is how much conversation occurs after them.  Good or bad, if you can talk about it at lengths with friends, than you know you have something special on your hands.

Overall, I was extremely impressed with this film.  While the ending was a bit confusing, I continued to think about it long after the film was over and came to realize that Fellini is a master of film.  I cannot wait to watch this film again, and again, and again.  It should have won for best film of the year in 1964, or at least for best director, but alas, I can live with the best Foreign Film of the year.  This film should be at or near the top of everyone's favorites list and should be served with an amazing red wine, an open mind, and good friends.  It is the perfect combination for this priceless film.

1646718,5,B00005QAPH,"I've been re-watching Fellini's 8 1/2 with all the commentaries... supposedly this is a ""film about film"". But, I think, it is a film about love.

Even the title, I think is about the women in his life. Throughout the movie the director-protagonist is beseiged by reporters and critics asking about his new film and one of the repeated questions is, ""Why don't you make a film about love?"". His friend's neice teases him that he does not know how.

Well, I think, this is how this film started- was the story Frederico was trying to tell but, as Guido agonizes to his sister at the rocket launch platform, he has lost his way. He wanted to tell such a simple story, ""No lies at all. One that would help people bury forever all these dead things we carry around.""

  The ""perfect woman"" who appears to him at the spa's healing spring and gives him water is the actress later walking through the streets with him as he agonizes over his life. She tells him then that he does not know how to love.

Oh, sad heart, sad heart, he is Everyman.

We can see the reasons for this as we are taken through his childhood memories, the stark role divisions, the repressive Catholic torture and Madonna/Whore template.

His sister is his best connection to his soul from their childhood games of asa nisa masa (ai ni ma) to her adult connection to Spirit being who tells him, ""You are free-but you must choose And you don't have much time."".

The actress who plays the director's mistress in the film was actually Fellini's mistress for 17 years. The interview with her is AMAZING!

The ending of the film was changed at the last minute-it was originally going to be the protagonist in a dream-visualization seeing all the women of his life together in a dining car, not the parade ending. Did Fellini chicken out, not wanting to give himself away too brazenly, or did he himself even realize what his film was about???

2. Mother

3. Saraghina

4. Wife

I think, the most important thing in this world is to learn how to truly love. To open ourselves deep enough to share a living dream of love, freedom, creativity, divinity. To learn to live this knowledge of the Soul in real life.

Yeah, I think, it's the only Revolution that will save the world.

1646719,5,B00005QAPH,"The prominent film director Guido (Marcello Mastroianni) finds himself overworked, harassed, and fatigued in all aspect of being.  Guido is sent to a health spa where he is supposed to recover from his stressful life, but instead is continuously pursued by people around him, by his past, and by his conscious.  The people around Guido are either dependent on him, desire his company, or merely try to advertise themselves in his presence.  In order to cope with a large number of people Guido has developed a social dance where he is able to circumvent or approach the individuals of his choosing.  This dance is also Guido's way of dealing with life and its complications, which affects him physically, psychologically, and socially.
8 fragmentally displays Guido's life as he dances between reality, dreams, and memories in the developmental stage of a film production.  This cerebral dance helps him to avoid what is deemed as uncomfortable as he escapes into his memories where he can find some joy and peace.  However, Guido often reminds himself of how his past sometimes plagues him as he can recollect deep memories of discomfort and guilt.  These negative emotions lead Guido into an internal crisis where he struggles with his decisions in the light of moral judgment that is heavily weighted by his Catholic upbringing.  Despite the internal crisis, the dance continuous as Guido is compelled to flee his painful memories by seeking company outside of his marriage as he seeks self-affirmation when he is alone.  The cheating provokes further guilt which urges Guido to remain dancing as he escapes into a dream world where he attempts to unify memories with the present where his consciousness sets the rules.  But to Guido's dismay he finds the dreams forcing him back into reality as his dreams rebel against himself.  This is due to his conflicting ideas that are simultaneously rejected and approved of in order to find temporary happiness and please those around him.  In essence, it is Guido's denial of his own lies that is the root to his guilt and unhappiness.
Fellini's 8 is a cinematic masterpiece, which encourages analytical and artistic thinking as it dives into a dense fabric of inventive imagery.  Vividly Fellini paints Guido's moral crisis onto the silver screen, which offers a surreal cinematic experience as it drifts between reality and dreams.  In addition, 8 shows Fellini's profound understanding of human psychology, which possibly could have been based on himself.  The fragmented story line enhances the visual feeling of the stress that Mastroianni's character experiences as well as developing a deep understanding for his mind.  The opening shot where Guido dreams of being enclosed in a smoldering car stuck in traffic displays Fellini's true cinematic genius as he develops an image of panic, anxiety, and fear.  This visualization is something that can be discovered in every film that Fellini has directed as well as his trademark of having a circus-like atmosphere.  8 has everything of what makes it a Fellini film, which offers a unique experience that could only have been accomplished by a true cinematic artist.",1088035200,6,3166,5.102713178294573

Saw the movie again yesterday at the Colonial in Phoenixville, PA, a wonderfully restored small town theatre, and reentered the world of the great director Federico Fellini. The cast consisted of Marcello Mastroianni (mid life crisis of the great director), Claudia Cardinale (the perfect woman), Sandra Milo (the chesty but dim lover) and Anouk Aim?e (the ordinary wife he cheats on).For Fellini, 8 ? continued a trend away from the realism of his early movies to a surrealistic view of his own life. The film has a simple premise. The great director has no idea what his next movie is about, while his producer and film company wait for Mastroianni to tell them what the movie is about. It does not help that Mastroianni falls in love with every woman in the cast and every woman he ever knew. The famous harem scene is near the end of the movie, where all the women in his life await his every whim. The older ones get banished upstairs.

1646721,4,B00005QAPH,"For what it is---an intensely personal statement about Fellini's own frustrations at a film director at a certain point in his life, as reflected by the frustrations of his film director alter ego Guido Anselmi---Federico Fellini's 8 1/2 is indeed brilliant and creative. It is certainly not like any other film you've ever seen, and it deserves to be seen by any serious cinema enthusiast at least once or twice, since it is such an influential film.
That being said, I have to admit that, after having seen it twice, I personally still can only express a cold admiration for Fellini's achievements here. I just can never really get myself personally involved in Fellini's world here to the point that I truly care about Guido and his predicament. Fellini hardly bothers to build up any sympathy for Guido or any of the characters (although I personally did feel some sympathy for Guido's wife Luisa, who is convincingly portrayed by Anouk Aimee as a woman who has had enough of his husband director's cheating ways). The film is on such a personal level that Fellini shuts the audience out and makes us view his universe from afar without truly enveloping us in it, and while what he does in that universe is undeniably brilliant, it means precious little to us in the end. I am almost tempted to echo some of the sentiments of critics (like Pauline Kael) who were less than enthusiastic when the film was first released in America---those who dismissed the film as ""self-indulgent trivia."" I expected a film about filmmaking, and what I saw instead was the story of a director going on and on and on about his own suffering, and frankly sometimes I just didn't truly care.
But then, of course, maybe Fellini never intended to fully engage the audience in this film. Or maybe I just have to watch more Fellini films in order to perhaps get onto his wavelength (so far, 8 1/2 is the only film of Fellini's I have seen). Despite my personal misgivings, 8 1/2 does have some justly famous sequences and images(the harem sequence being the standout), and is interesting enough to warrant a look by any serious film enthusiast. Who knows? Great art sometimes doesn't reveal its depths the first time, and maybe this film will eventually reveal something more in subsequent viewings (although in the back of my mind I have my doubts).",1085961600,5,2330,4.741379310344827
1646722,5,B00005QAPH,"You'll find this movie a real tour de force with a script that doesn't seem get old, but becomes so fresh forty one years after being filmed. The presence of this mytical actor like Mastroinanni, giving one of his three best performances in his carrer. The charisma and beuuty of Claudia Cardinale (The italian image of Anna Karina), and the absolutely irreverent script supported by a cinematic progress in the narrative, the surrealistic elipsis that engage us with the different stages in the life of our undecided and troubled director. His dreams, fantasies of his childhood and youth, are described with elegant insolence.
Together with Luis Buuel, Fellini makes a couple of directors who told all what they wanted without restrictions , with absolute liberty.
Amarcord in my opinion is Fellini's masterpiece, but it's just to recognize that cinematographily is less border edge than 8 1/2.
If you really want to have a real treasure cinematheque, don't think it over.
Buy this , because this film owns the landmark of the inmortality.

1646723,5,B00005QAPH,"I purchased this DVD because of its' sustained superior ratings in the Sight and Sound survey every decade of the best films of all time.  Obviously, there must be something very great about this movie.  There is but but there are some second thoughts that plagued me along the way.  First of all, I am always impressed by a film's ability to hold our attention.  This is often where the skill of film editing is best appreciated.  I confess that I found myself looking for some scenes in ""8 1/2"" to move along.  This is a cerebral movie, not an action movie but there seemed to be a fair amount of redundancy.  Secondly, I was surprized by the sound work on this movie.  I made a quick glance at a few other reviews but didn't see any similar comments.  Thus I don't know if it was just my copy.  However, the sound didn't match up with the film very well at all.  This gives the movie an odd appearance of being an Italian movie dubbed in Italian.  Was I missing something?  Finally, the message in this film, for me, was ""to your own self be true"" which is certainly a valid philosophy; just ask Socrates.  However, it was stretched to come across as ""accept me for who I am, not whom you want me to be"".  This message is still a valid philosophy but a bit harder for some of us to accept.
Having said all of that, let me praise the movie; (I DID give it a ""5"" after all).  The acting is terrific; especially Marcello Mastroianni whose air of detachment fit the movie so well.  The photography (B&W) was excellent, as well.  The story is one of a director who has lost his own direction.  As he stumbles aimlessly along supposedly putting together a film,  his inteactions with others and his reminiscences give us an insight to his confusion.  His world is overwhelming him and he can't figure out where to turn.  He is much the victim of himself (which makes the message that much harder to swallow).  As his crisis reaches its' own crisis, the movie rights itself with his discovery of his own self-awareness.  Everything comes together at the end with a message of hope (primarily for the director).  The beauty of the movie is how we are able to follow the character's collapse and rebirth.  It is also in the way we can see the rest of the world through his own eyes.  This is the sort of movie that will expand with each re-viewing.  The DVD contains a second disc with information and reviews about the movie and the Director.
This is a good movie that caught me off-guard because I was victimized by too much advance hype.  I understand the hype but it would have been better to discover it for myself.  Discover it for yourself and it will be a movie you'll remember.",1081036800,2,2680,4.3991853360488795
1646724,5,B00005QAPH,"In 8 1/2 we enter the fragmented world belonging to a filmmaker struggling with the creation of his next film.  Guido Anselmi is the protagonist and is a thinly-veiled projection of (director) Federico Fellini.  Formally, this film has moments of rare beauty.  In terms of content, it is a confessional piece that appears extremely personal while at the same time giving voice to common struggles of man.  Guido is subjected to a maelstrom of questions which he has no answers to.  One can assume these are all questions that he is silently asking himself.  Guido's conversations become quite loaded and reveal an incomplete man beneath the mystique of an artistic reputation.  Guido navigates often hostile environments with only brief possibilities for fulfillment and repose.  Guido cannot find the worldly rewards that he expects for himself and seems as much a victim of his own pessimism as of the endless demands of his colleages and lovers.  Toward the end, the desperation featured in the story might actually reflect the reality of the production of 8 1/2.  I am only guessing, because as obsurd as the film becomes it seems to remain interested in ""the truth"" of things.  Questions play a large role in this story as much as do the silences that often follow them.
Fellini has left us with a groundbreaking film that has a lot of heart.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone willing to watch it.",1077494400,,1407,4.841004184100418

1646726,5,B00005QAPH,"The first time I saw 8 1/2, I grasped bits of its structure but didn't really understand it. It challenges you to understand it. Then I listened to the commentary track, and everything fell in place, more or less.
The story, if we can say there is one, follows Guido, a movie director, staying at a health spa while trying to organize his next movie. His problem is that he has no idea what the movie is about, nor does he know what he is doing. Everything in his life lacks balance and he cannot admit the truth to himself or others, so he looks inwards to try to find answers, while being hounded by disgruntled actresses and journalists.
8 1/2 has a multitude of narrative levels, even its own critic. At a first viewing, you have an utter but ""Beautiful Confusion"", as the movie was first supposed to be called. But there *is* a method to this madness, and if you are very patient and have the DVD commentary track, you can understand it, I promise you. I think I managed that, but it's difficult (I don't want to give it away, however tempting it is). There is a reason why it's called an art students' favourite.
Contrarily to what some ignorant critics have said, 8 1/2 is not about creativity or making a movie or somesuch nonsense. There is strictly no movie-making in this movie, as Guido has no screenplay, and no idea where he is going. Trying to explain this movie cannot be done, unless you simply tell the truth - that it is an exploration of Fellini's psyche and problems. The movie itself feels more like a sustained emotion than a movie, because we are basically exploring one gigantic theme, and we just don't know it. It is not an easy movie to watch emotionally or to remember, because the storyline is fragmentary. It's more like a dream than an actual story.
From the opening dream scene of Guido trapped in a car, to the bath house (the most inspired scene I've ever seen), to the unfinished spaceship structure, 8 1/2's style is the equal of its content. This is a beautiful movie to look at, and its black-and-white cinematography is not only great, I didn't even notice it was black-and-white unless a commentator mentioned it !",1054080000,8,2155,4.514066496163683
1646727,5,B00005QAPH,"As soon as I saw E E I fell in love with it. Possibly it was because I completely related to the main character's pain of being trapped in a reality that made him paranoid, or that every problem that he had would topple down his other problems like dominoes, pressure from the people who surrounded him, personal and professional alike. Or maybe since it was directed and written by Fellini. In any way, this vision only Fellini could take on, a director who had no idea how to finish his own film, with his personal struggles surrounding him at the same time, was destined to be the film that Fellini should be remembered for. You may want to scream at yourself after watching this film. But do you exactly know why?
Criterion put together the ultimate package for E E supplements galore. Commentary is fun for the enthusiasts, along with Terry Gilliam's intro. But all the fun to me lies in the autobiographical film that Fellini made for television. Just sit back and watch this after the movie. You'll see what I mean by it. Or maybe you won't. The documentary on the amazing Nina Rota from German television is also included, the composer behind many of his films, possibly this one being the most memorable of his film scores. They also held back at nothing and included many essays for the booklet inside, which I still have no idea why other companies feel this is not a `supplementE If you don't own any of Fellini's films on DVD, this is the one to start off with. This has the best extras of any out there.
On a side note, the audio seemed to be slightly off, but it might be a defect on my copy, I haven't seen anything on Criterion's website that says anything about it.
Best shot/sequence:
With Criterion remastering every frame, it's hard to pick out the best of the best. But the opening dream sequence when Guido is stuck in traffic and floats away is still far and away one of the greatest dream sequences ever made, with subtle uses of freeze framing, dissolves, and telephoto lenses. I especially love the old man caressing the younger woman in the other car. Strange, but very much part of the dream that has to be seen to understand.",1053561600,,2155,4.5

1646729,5,B00005QAPH,"It's easy to see Guido Anselmi, the lead character in 8 1/2, as Federico Fellini himself. The movie is easier to understand if you realize this movie is essentially about itself. Quite a departure from Fellini's work in the 50s, such as the mesmerizing Nights of Cabiria. With 8 1/2, he embraced a much more fanciful surrealistic style, later to be dubbed ""Fellini-esque"". It's a much more imaginative and cinematic style than the earlier neo-realist style. It allows us to really get inside the head of Guido (and Fellini also). We witness his dreams, his fantasies, his frustrations, his memories, his ideas, all in vivid carnivalesque vignettes. The opening sequence features Guido stuck in a traffic jam, then climbing out of his car and flying away in the sky. He flies far above a beach almost like a kite, with a rope attached to his leg held by one of his associates. Then he is pulled back down to earth by the rope and promptly returns to reality. This sequence sets the tone for the film. Guido drifts back and forth in between fantasy and reality. Perhaps to escape the frustrations of being unable to make his next film, of dealing with his producers, or of dealing with the women in his life. However, he never manages to escape for long without being pulled back down to earth by his problems.
It's a scenario that we can all relate to. The reason that we go to movies in the first place is to escape from our everyday problems and concerns. This is Guido's (and Fellini's) predicament: that he can't even escape from his own concerns long enough to create a film, so that his viewers can escape theirs. Fellini, however, was able to take this predicament and make it into his film. The result is probably the most clever and complex film about filmmaking ever made.
This can be a bit daunting to a first time viewer. 8 1/2, I think, is a film that you really have to grow into. It takes multiple viewings to really get a good grasp of everything that's going on. And with each viewing, you should notice something new and catch on to the many complexities of the film. I will admit that I have not completely grasped all the meanings of this profound film, but it's a joy to experience even if you absorb only a little. The combination of the images and Nino Rota's music and Fellini's dazzling photography makes for quite an experience.
The Criterion DVD is definitely one to pick up. I haven't seen all the extra material on the disc, but the movie itself looks superb. The picture quality is really astounding. I saw 8 1/2 on an old VHS tape a while back and this DVD looks much, much better! It's a clean, detailed picture that really brings out the beauty of the black and white photography. The picture is also enhanced for 16:9 TVs. Film lovers should definitely have this disc in their collection.",1051142400,11,2821,4.566074950690335

1646743,4,B00005QAPH,"This is my first experience with Fellini.  In my college days, I often heard the expression, ""You don't have to be Fellini to figure that one out,"" and am only now coming to realize what that meant.  Fellini is fearless in exploring the most difficult questions, like one's sexual honesty, the ability of anyone to ""tell the whole truth"" to the public when one is less than honest with onesself, and what level of certainty one must have in order to instruct others.  If these questions seem a bit obtuse -- they are.  Yet, I defy anyone to show these most primal of subjects addressed in American films.  At least Fellini addresses them with a sense of humor, without losing his emotional or physical passion, and with images that will stay with you for many days after viewing this film.
The clarity of picture and sound are impressive.  It is a rather ""honest"" portrayal of a movie director with the cinematic equivalent of writer's block.  On first viewing, I must confess that I missed some of the Italian cultural references, of which I was informed by watching the movie with the running commentary (top notch).  But here is the real rub on this one -- this movie is worth owning for the extras.  These are contained on a separate disk, and merit watching over and over and over again.  The interview with Sandra Milo (Fellini's mistress of some 17 years) is worth the price of the DVD set alone.  The hour-long documentary made by Fellini himself contains clips of movies that never made it into production and, for me, represent the ultimate in entertainment value.  So, even if the subject matter of 8 1/2 does not sound like your cup of Chianti, buy it for the extras alone.  You will want it if you enjoy any of Fellini's other films.",1042329600,3,1746,4.593548387096774
1646744,5,B00005QAPH,"Semi-autobiographical self-analysis mixed with fantasies in a movie?  It worked for Fellini to the point that it yielded him his third Oscar for best foreign film, the other two being La Strada and La Dolce Vita.  It's a unique testament to his vision.
The opening scene itself is memorable.  In it, Guido Anselmi is inside a car surrounded by traffic.  He tries to get out but can't, frantically rapping on the window, unable to breathe.  The occupants of the other cars stare expressionlessly at him.  It's a brilliant symbol of the oppression of society and conformity.  The allegory continues with him soaring into the sky and being a human kite, after which authority orders him to be brought back down to earth instead of being in the clouds.  How repressive!
Guido is a film director in his stride who's onto a rough start with his current project.  Yet his collaborator Daumier finds several flaws.  There is no fundamental guiding principle, no philosophical premise, and ambiguous intention.  One thing that Guido wants for sure is an angelic woman dressed in white, symbolizing innocence, purity, and salvation.  Ironically, in the end, it is she identifies his problem for him.  The reason why there isn't a coherent project going on is that the movie is more scenes from Guido's childhood, and many of those are played throughout the film.  He wants to make a film that is honest, helpful to everyone, and that will bury everything dead in everyone.  But does he really have anything to say?  In the meantime, he is hounded by his producer to stick to schedule, hire actors, and start shooting.
He also has a mistress Carla, who's extravagant, sexy, a bit loquacious, being at an impasse in his marriage to Luisa.  But it's the fantasy-world and the past that he retreats to in times of stress that's the real wonder here.  We learn of his encounter with the hefty and sensuous Saraghina, who lives on the beach and who teaches the local Catholic school kids forbidden dances.  The scene of having his own harem, full of the women whom he has encountered, is nothing more than a big booster shot to his male ego.  I need to daydream something like that more often.
In the scene between Guido and the Catholic cardinal, I found a line there that reminded me why I quit going to church.  Guido complains of not being happy.  The cardinal replies, ""Why should you be happy?  That is not your task in life.  Who said we were put on Earth to be happy?""  He then quotes from Origenes:  ""There is no salvation outside the Church.""
A question from Guido to Claudia, the stunning actress tapped to play his pure angel is also one to us all:  ""Could you choose one single thing and be faithful to it?  Could you make it the one thing that gives your life meaning, just because you believe in it?""
 Marcello Mastroianni is well-placed as Guido, as is Sandra Milo as Carla and Anouk Aimee as Luisa.  Barbara Steele plays someone usually out-of-character compared to the horror films she did during this time, as Gloria, the poetic young fiancee of Guido's friend Mario.  She has a wonderful line:  ""The cruel bees have sucked the life from these poor flowers.""
This movie was called 8-1/2 because Fellini had done seven films plus three collaborations in which he shot a short segment for an anthology, counting each collaboration as half, so he decided this film would be his 8-1/2th.  One of those movies in a league by itself.",1042156800,32,3430,4.69179229480737

We follow Guido who is trying to make a film, but lacks inspiration, and cannot focus or find answers, as everyone in his life frustrates him.

It is a superb autobiographical look at Fellini (played wonderfully by Mastroianni) by Fellini.  He sugarcoats nothing so it is a complete portrait of the artist, the man, the filmmaker.  It is peopled by the many distinctive faces that would be called Felliniesque in later years plus is shot in surreal, dreamy black and white.

Perhaps the most complex issue is the role of women in his life plus its related issue of family.  Those hugely influenced his filmmaking even though most viewers associate him with much more avant garde issues. This film later influenced Woody Allen in making his autobiographical ""Stardust Memories"" and Bob Fosse in making ""All That Jazz.""  The word that comes to mind about all 3 films is ""unflinching.""  There is a companion film to this one that I like as well or even better, Fellini's ""City of Women,"" also starring Mastroianni.

1646749,5,B00005QAPH,"This is among my most favorite films. Fellini's Guido is a director with an identity crisis effecting or as a result of his professional and personal life. The various scenes are powerful examples of what Fellini can do when he's operating at his full artistic capabilities. Part magical realism, part autobiography and done in a style that only Italian film was once able to do, watching 8  has always been a great experience for me.
Fellini's self-conscious artistic manner and self-absorption, which can drag down some of his later works, become the strengths of 8 . His dreams, doubts and visions are the film itself and delivered so masterfully that Fellini never again was able to match (though he came close) this sort of narrative.
There are so many great scenes in this film. Among the best is the imaginary ""revolt"" of the women in his life, where Guido's home is full of a ""harem"" that all turn against him.  Equally great is the circus scene where freaks and mirrors reflect the turmoil and confusion in his life.
Some might call this an ""artsy"" film, which I think is a back handed complement. I don't I think it's film being ""artsy"", I think it's film telling a story the way a great novel can. Along with ""La Dolce Vita"" this is Fellini's greatest work.",1032307200,5,1268,4.65625

Fellini captured the true whirlwind of ideas, fantasies, desires, evocations, memories and nightmares of a film director (in this case, Mastroianni) who suffers from a blank in the middle of his will-be next film.
This is a film where Fellini uses himself as the primary source for his character with beautiful evocations of his own childhood and all the characters that populate his mind.
Constructed against the idea of a plot, the film goes deeper and deeper into the main character's mind allowing Fellini do display his true command of the images.
Beautifully shot in B&W it is incredible how Fellini and his cameraman arrange all the elements inside the frame - resulting in shots that are not found anywhere else. Every shot is a masterpiece of image composition that only DVD can do justice to.
This CRITERION edition is vastly superior to all other versions of this film. Not only it provides top quality on the film itself, but also a huge amount of valuable extras.

Both deal with a director having trouble putting a film together, but they're handled in two amazingly different, yet similar styles (with a bow/jibe to Fellini in Truffaut's work). It's also interesting to note that this film about filmmakig is perhaps the best examination of how an artist works in his medium using that medium - hard to visuallly dramatise the elusive discipline required for writing, singing, painting, poetry, dancing or sculpting on film, no matter how many times filmmakers in the past have tried. Yet 8 1/2 shows AND tells what's it's like to be a filmmaker.
Criterion's splendid rendition of Fellini's chez d'ouvere is a benchmark for the restorative process of DVD! The blacks have never looked this black, except maybe in Gianni di Venanzo's head - and the constast is startling, another reason why the major film distribution companies should spend the time and care restoring them pre-1970 catalogs.

1646764,5,B00005QAPH,"Frederico Fellini's masterwork 8  is difficult to approach largely because of its reputation. Many critics also state that the film is so complex that it requires multiple viewings to understand, and this is likely to intimidate many viewers.  But the truth is that, in spite of its surrealistic flourishes, 8  is more straight-forward than its reputation might lead you to believe.

The storyline itself is very simple.  A famous director is preparing a new film, but finds himself suffering from creative block: he is obsessed by, loves, and feels unending frustration with both art and women, and his attention and ambition flies in so many different directions that he is suddenly incapable of focusing on one possibility lest he negate all others. With deadlines approaching the cast and crew descend upon him demanding information about the film--information that the director does not have because he finds himself incapable of making an artistic choice.

What makes the film interesting is the way in which Fellini ultimately transforms the film as a whole into a commentary on the nature of creativity, art, mid-life crisis, and the battle of the sexes.  Throughout the film, the director dreams dreams, has fantasies, and recalls his childhood-and this internal life is presented on the screen with the same sense of reality as reality itself.  The staging of the various shots is unique; one is seldom aware that the characters have slipped into a dream, fantasy, or memory until one is well into the scene, and as the film progresses the lines between external life and internal thought become increasingly blurred, with Fellini giving as much (if not more) importance to fantasy as to fact.

The performances and the cinematography are key to the film's success.  Even when the film becomes surrealistic, fantastic, the actors perform very realistically and the cinematography presents the scene in keeping with what we understand to be the reality of the characters lives and relationships.  At the same time, however, the film has a remarkably poetic quality, a visual fluidity and beauty  that transforms even the most ordinary events into something slightly tinged by a dream-like quality.  Marcello Mastroianni offers a his greatest performance here, a delicate mixture of desperation and ennui, and he is exceptionally well supported by a cast that includes Claudia Cardinale, Anouk Aimee, and a host of other notables.

I would encourage people not to be intimidated by the film's reputation, for its content can be quickly grasped, and when critics state the film requires repeated viewing what they actually seem to mean is that the film holds up extremely well to repeated viewing; each time it is seen, one finds more and more to enjoy and to contemplate.  Even so, I would be amiss if I did not point out that people who prefer a cinema of tidy plot lines and who dislike ambiguity or the necessity of interpreting content will probably dislike 8  a great deal; if you are uncertain in your taste on these points you would do well to rent or borrow the film before making a purchase.  For all others: strongly, strongly recommended.

1646766,5,B00005QAPH,"...Watching the DVD I bought from Amazon, I was stunned.
The clarity of light on the cars in the famous opening sequence literally shines! There is one other scene in particular where Mastroianni stands in front of a light -- an effect I'm certain Fellini realized -- and you can literally see the light shine from his graying hair. Even the subtitles have been re-done. I can remember looking at the fuzzy subtitles on the VHS and struggling to concentrate. On this Criterion Collection DVD, they are crisp and clear as anything on the market.
Most significant to me, though: the commentary section! Though I've watched this film a few times (I can still remember getting chills up my spine the first time I saw the opening sequence) the commentary will blow you away with how complex this 2 hour film is. Though it is a film that is fun enough to watch for its own sake -- the commentary read like a guidebook to Picasso's cubist period, explaining the significance of casting certain characters, various symbols: for example, the watch given to Mastroianni by the Producer in the film echoes Fellini's own producer giving him a watch under similar circumstances after his filming La Dolce Vita. There are many like images and symbols explained. The depth of commentary made this film Ten Times more complex than without -- and yet, even realizing how much more complex and personal this film is, it's still the fun 2 hour film it'll always be! It's just that watching it now is watching a film with thirty years of wisdom packed into one DVD. Amazing. Nina Rota's score is a trip! I've only had time, so far, to browse over the interview section on Disc 2 (nearly three hours worth of interviews). My hope here is that this amazon.com review will give you an indication that: There's enough info, entertainment, and analysis on this DVD to keep you interested and entertained for plenty 'o time to come!
It is the best DVD I have ever bought...",1017187200,13,1947,4.679300291545189
1646767,5,B00005QAPH,"Federico Fellini's 8 1/2 is mesmerizing in it's tone, style and technique all the while telling a coherent story of the inner depression of a director. It can be somewhat obvious that Fellini used a lot of his personal experience after the success of his film La Dolce Vita and how most likely he was under the gun to make another success. It is also one of the testaments to his imagination and creative flair of film that he decided to use this problem to his advantage. By combining many of his deep, joyful, though troublesome memories with strange and interesting detail around the picture world in Italy, he has crafted a masterpiece about film.
Marcello Mastroianni, who also played the lead in La Dolce Vita and a number of other Fellini movies, takes on playing a verion of Fellini- Guido Orefice is fourty-three, somewhat sick, pulled in several directions at numerous times, the director with little time is assigned to pump out new ideas for his new movie and get the right actors for the job. Mastroianni projects a splendid performance of his version of Fellini (his version by the way, not an exact replica) since he conveys all the sorrow right in his eyes, within at a lot of moments. This is a good mood motivator.
Overall what makes 8 1/2 unique are the numerous sequences where Guido escapes in his dreamworld of women, memories, and the fancy free-flight. Most memorable (indeed one of the most memorable of all time from my standpoint) scenes is the first of the movie, where he is stuck in traffic, surrounded by a many lot of odd looking people, and getting exasperated when some type of gas fumes into the unopenable car. Then he finally reaches his abscond- getting out through the roof of the car and flying away in the sky; only to get tugged at by a counselor while floating without moving in the sky to the words- Down, definitely down. The fact that this scene is only the first in a line of others that ring surreal simplicity while is just one of the many triumphs present here. The last scene is also one for the books if only for it's cheery lunacy.
(By the way, this critertion DVD is also worth 5 stars. There is no English dubbing, but in a way that's a good thing since dubbing is the last thing this movie needs. Terry Gilliam makes a nice intro segment as well on disc 1).",1015977600,2,2313,4.522673031026253
1646768,5,B00005QAPH,"I will leave film critique to others, although this is a very abstract almost surreal film about a director as artist and what happens when ""writers block"" sets in in middle age. The DVD is of unbelievable clarity and crispness. There is a great commentary included which helps explain much of what's going on (remember that the working title for this film was the ""Beautiful Confusion""). The extra CD has a weird film about hippies made around the time of Satyricon, which is kind of a waste of time. There is also a bio on Rota's music and a few interviews, which are nice to have.
This is an extremely well packaged DVD, one of the better ones available. This DVD should set a new standard for the treatment of great classic films! (I wish all the classics were represented as well as this). I don't know exactly who the Criterion corporation are personally, but they should be congratulated on some fine preservation and presentation of great film, and 8 1/2 is one of their landmark acheivments!",1014768000,2,1000,4.655367231638418
1646769,4,B00005QAPH,"Regarding ""8 1/2"" itself, I agree with everything positive that people have already written. But--even with all the extras on it--I only rate the DVD 4 stars because it does not contain the rarely shown but very excellent english language dub. At the least, it provides one more experience of a film that, for me, has stayed pretty fresh since I first stumbled across it back in-when else?-1988. I know that a lot of(most?)dubs are pretty awful (english track on ""Crouching Tiger"" DVD)--but in the case of ""8 1/2"" it was done just right--down to the way it syncs with the actors' mouths. The voices are cartoonish compared to the italian, yet perfectly in sync with the characters on screen--Daumier sounds ""more like"" Daumier in english than italian. And I was actually kinda disappointed when I first heard Marcello's own voice, rather than the burlier english Guido. I appreciate the beautiful new print and the extra stuff, but I consider omitting the english track ridiculous. I'd buy another DVD if Criterion re-issued it with the english track available. Not to insult anyone, but if it's a question of DVD ""bandwidth,"" I'd take the english dub instead of the audio commentary. Sometimes the subtitles obscure things, like Guido's twitching foot when Daumier is excorciating their proposed collaboration. Yes, I've seen the subtitled version many times, but, at least with this particular movie, there is something crucial lost in the necessity of reading subtitles while at the same time trying to take in Fellini's images. It flows perfectly if you don't have that slight disconnect.",1014681600,9,1592,5.057034220532319
1646770,5,B00005QAPH,"This is an amazing film that hits you aesthetically and viscerally. The opening dream sequence is about the truest expression of a male in his forties that I could imagine and Mastroianni as the exhausted director Guido is the perfect blending of anxiety, detachment and ennui that follows the creative mind caught between projects.

1646781,5,B00005QAPH,"This new Criterion Collection edition of *8 1/2* is one of the best DVD ""special edition"" sets I've come across.
The Movie:
Fellini's breakthrough film is a movie about itself. It is archetypal in the Fellini canon because it both settles old scores and announces a new cinema. The film's hero is an Italian filmaker (Mastroianni as ""Guido"" a quasi-alter ego for the director) who has just had his first major hit (=La Dolce Vita). He is not resting on his laurels, however. He is confronted with the necessity of the next movie. This necessity is both personal to the director and apparently contractual: the producer is forever hovering... To Guido, it is an inner necessity, an unrest, a creative suffocation, objectified in the opening sequence of the movie where Guido is seen/not seen by the camera, trapped inside a tiny car that is itself trapped in a traffic jam that stretches endlessly beyond available light as the car fills with toxic gas. We see the as yet unidentified hero in silhouette from behind. We see his hands and feet from outside the car, through the window as he desparately tries to escape. Then, he mysteriously escapes through the car's roof like a new bird escaping its shell and is carried off into the clouds, etc.
The trouble is, this is a wish fulfillment dream. In ""real"" life, Guido is about to make a movie, and he has no idea what it's going to be about, or what to do with all the actors and extras, and the giant launching pad for some kind of space-ship that is the only thing even close to a concrete idea for the projected picture.
The film is not, however, a perfect autobiographical fit. For one thing, Fellini gets to finish his movie and Guido, evidently, does not. But, that said, the movie is a virtual mirror of itself, which was a very hard thing to pull off in 1962, before the concept of ""virtual"" was annexed by the codifiers of computer jargon, and *8 1/2* is nothing if not a virtuoso performance. Fellini's breakthrough is the film we watch. But in the film, the hero finds the resolution to his anguish, not in finding the project - that is, in making what would have been the film-about-itself within the film-about-itself within the film-about-itself that we are, finally, watching - but in letting go of the project, in surrendering to the impossibility of finding it or making it. Precisely *on the other side of his own fantasy-suicide*, at the moment when he apparently gives in to despair, he discovers the circle of life and becomes able to join into the procession of lives into which his own life is finally intertwined.
So, this is an essential film. And it is a film so rich in texture that a person could watch the movie a hundred times and find new things to wonder at, and discover new connections between the One and the Many - Fellini's personal/existential problem.
The DVD:
First disc contains a sparkling transfer of the movie that restores a luster to the angular lights and shadows in Fellini's final black & white movie. Audio commentary by a couple of scholars and Fellini's former close accomplice Gideon Bachman.
Second disc contains Fellini's famous ""Director's Notebook"" of 1968(-9), an hour-long movie that was originally made for television, as well as another documentary about composer Nino Rota, and various interviews, including one with the ever-fiesty Lina Wertmueller who was Fellini's Asst. Director on *8 1/2*.
The package also comes with a really interesting little booklet with lots of information and a thoughtful mini-essay.
Overall a great package that I'll not regret buying.",1010102400,10,3578,4.80064829821718
1646782,5,B00005QAPH,"For anyone who owns the MPI transfer of this film on VHS and is wondering if the Criterion DVD is worth your while (did you ever doubt it?) -- it most definitely is!
I am stunned by what Criterion have done with my favorite film! The uncropped format is only the beginning -- artifacts from obviously decaying source material have been cleaned up and the whole thing takes on a brilliant, sharp look. The technical quality is so good one begins to forget it wasn't filmed yesterday. The sound is clearer and more audible and the subtitles are now of course legible.
I couldn't be happier. It's brilliant. It makes the film that much more immersive and enjoyable. Get the DVD now, you won't regret it.
(As a side note: I have also recently had occasion to see the ""other"" single-disc, non-Criterion DVD transfer of 8 1/2. There is absolutely no comparison; the Criterion DVD is spectacular, while the ""other"" DVD release is hard better than VHS, if it is at all!

After thinking that my third generation copy on VHS was the only right way to watch this masterpiece, I now realize how wrong I was. The clarity of the images and the choreography of the camera and even focus pulling was all designed by Fellini for a reason and the DVD brings all of this new information back from the dead.

In a nutshell, a film that some may not like but can't say anything consistently negative against.
I think the second mastepiece of Fellini is Giulietta degli spiriti (Juliet of the spirits, wich there's only a limited version around in DVD), wich I carry more hauntly in my memory, but it is not as perfect as 8 1/2, i would say.

1646785,4,B00005QAPH,"I will let others speak to the artistic merits of the film and I will only say that I have had the pleasure to enjoy it a few times in the theater over the years.  This is a dvd I have looked forward to for some time and the quality of the Criterion transfer is outstanding, although I did get a little digital weirdness from time to time.  For example, when the film director goes airborne in the beginning, his coat would fracture a bit in motion--very minor and not really distracting.  But here's the rub--I'm getting so tired of inaccurate info on these discs--the cover states the film is presented in 1.85:1 aspect ratio--one look at my tv and it was obviously not 1.85--I got out a ruler and measured--result was 1.60:1.  Now that's close to 1.66:1, which is European widescreen and likely the proper aspect ratio--with the delays in the release of the disc, why can't they get these details right.  I have a region 2 copy of this disc from the u.k.--a basic edition-- and I popped it in to compare with the Criterion disc.  It was widescreen as well--and it measured about 1.90:1--which is pretty close to the 1.85 Criterion claimed--I believe you see more of the frame at the top and bottom in 1.66 anyway if you're worried that image was cropped.  It seems so strange that the American disc is presented in the European 1.66 and the U.K. disc is in the American 1.85 ratio.  The region 2 u.k. disc was also a little less contrasty and so you could see detail a bit better in the shadows, but the image itself was also a bit softer and didn't have the crispness of the Criterion.  This is really a minor complaint in the end, but Criterion has a low number of new releases and I think it is reasonable to hold them to a high standard in both their transfers and their information.",1007683200,13,1790,4.416413373860182
1646786,5,B00005QAPH,"Fellini's 8 1/2 is one of the great filmgoing experiences from one of the four or five greatest filmmakers who has ever lived.  There is nothing like watching Fellini spin his magic in one of his many classic works, and 8 1/2 is the finest of the lot.
As with most of his best work, the film is virtually plotless and filled with scenes of great creative energy.  The film follows a movie director named Guido whose life is slowly spinning out of control while shooting his latest picture.  All manner of ""groupies"" and hangers on keep interrupting his life as does the crew, his mistress and wife.  On top of this, he faces a creative ""block"" and is disturbed by recurring nightmares, dreams and visions.
This is a GREAT film, and as usual, Criterion has presented it in a very fine package.  The supplemental material on this set is superb, it's really one of the best DVD releases this year.

1646787,5,B00005QAPH,"**EDIT 10/4/11: ADDED REVIEW OF 2009 CRITERION BLU-RAY**

The most obvious achievement in 8 1/2, Fellini's mind-boggling piece of self-examination, is its audacious mixture of dreams and reality in order to show the protagonist Guido's whimsical mind state. Dream sequences come and go without warning, depicting Guido's pain, yearning, frustration, guilt that can pop up at any instant. The first time we see Guido's face, it is his mirror image, hinting to us the unreality we are about to face. Some of the dream sequences have a Bunuel-like surrealism. Some of them, however, blend almost seamlessly into scenes of reality, intentionally confounding us. Some are nightmarish, yet some are warm and hopeful. Some are brief flights of fancy, and some are lengthy, elaborate, wild visions that reflect Guido's heightened sense of confusion and anxiety. Although the film is often called the best film ever made about a filmmaker, its theme is universal in that it is a vivid picturization of a person's (and by extension, any person's) mind, which is often haunted by the past, tormented by the present, and apprehensive about the future and the unknown...

The Criterion Blu-ray edition duplicates all the content in the bonus features and booklet of the DVD edition, but offers a high-def picture and lossless uncompressed mono track.  The 1080p video transfer seems to come from the same high-def source that created the DVD edition (which looks very good itself), so you get the inherent advantage of high-def over standard-def, which is 2-3 times higher resolution horizontally and vertically.  The uncompressed audio track is encoded at a bit rate of 1152 kbps, which is 6 times higher than that of the DVD's Dolby Digital mono track.  In short, this is the best the film has ever looked and sounded on home video.  Of course, the better your audio and video equipments (especially screen size), the better your experience.  I viewed mine on a 50"" screen.  As is usually the case in viewing black-and-white films on Blu-ray, you see more optimal black and white levels than the DVD counterpart.  But be sure to calibrate your screen properly, such as with the ""color bars"" screen that comes with all Criterion discs.  Proper calibration is quite important for serious viewing of Blu-rays because of the format's ability to show a lot more subtleties and nuances in the picture than DVDs ever can.

The 52-minute short film ""Fellini: A Director's Notebook"" in the Blu-ray's bonus feature section actually has better picture quality than that on the DVD edition.  It still looks severely battered and scratchy, but the colors are much brighter, whereas on the DVD they look very faded.  Criterion has obviously found a different video copy of the film for the Blu-ray, as indicated by the opening logo that does not exist on the DVD.

For my opinions on the quality of the bonus features, please see my original DVD review below.

**BELOW IS MY REVIEW OF THE 2001 CRITERION DVD EDITION, originally posted Dec-05-2001**

The new Criterion DVD of 8 1/2 has a sparkling video transfer. A frame-by-frame cleanup of the picture has been done, so this DVD is significantly better-looking than Criterion's laserdisc version in 1989. There are momentary freeze frames during the opening scene, but since they also appeared on the LD, I assume they are normal. The 1.0 mono audio track is indistinguishable in quality from that on the LD -- it is mostly clean and sharp, although loud sound shows some distortion. The image is anamorphic. The disc is region-free. The audio is supported by newly-translated optional English subtitles.

There is one slight discrepancy between the LD and the DVD. The LD contained the American release version of the film in which some scenes, such as the one in which Guido first meets his wife, had altered music cues. The DVD, however, is the original Italian version, retaining all of its original music.

The DVD's audio commentary comprises of scene-specific comments (whose authorship is unclear), and additional comments from critic Gideon Bachmann and NYU professor Antonio Monda. The result is a pretty well-rounded audio essay covering the film's conception, production details, themes, and artistic significance, as well as personal recollections, anecdotes, and abandoned concepts and scenes. Other extras include two 1-hour films on the filmmakers. The first is ""Fellini: A Director's Notebook"", directed by and starring Fellini himself. It is a sort of Fellini-style DAY FOR NIGHT, a fictional, somewhat humorous account of how the director goes about making a film. The video/audio quality of this piece is poor, and there are no subtitles or closed captioning. The second film is a documentary made by German filmmakers in 1993 titled ""Nino Rota: Between Cinema and Concert"". It offers an intimate yet enigmatic portrayal of Nino Rota through his personal recordings, film footage of him working with Fellini, clips of some early films scored by Rota, and interviews of his associates and students. One segment is about how Rota recycled his score from the 1957 film FORTUNELLA to create the theme for THE GODFATHER, an act that would cost him the Oscar nomination. The DVD extras also include 3 new interviews. Sandra Milo speaks candidly about her experiences, both personal and professional, with Fellini. Linda Wertmuller lavishes praises on Fellini's genius while offering a fascinating appraisal of Fellini's psychology that figures prominently in 8 1/2. And Vittorio Storaro pays tributes to the achievements of 8 1/2's cinematographer, Gianni di Venanzo. Rounding out the extras are 100 or so still photos from the set of the film, some of which were taken from deleted scenes.",1007510400,62,5730,5.129828326180258
1646788,2,B00005QAPH,"After watching this movie I really wish I had those two hours back.  People will say it went over my head, but I will beg to differ.  I just didn't enjoy the film.  Sure it is an art film, and is one of the, if not the first, to explore freely flowing thoughts.  But give me a break, how predictable can this thing be.  Throw in Strange Religious imagery to show my strict Catholic upbringing.  Add alittle dream girl (Claudio) to represent my dissatisfaction and struggles in my love life.  Make Guido a director so the viewer knows it is a movie about me.  I won't ruin the ending, but you could just fast forward to it.  Whola, 8 1/2.  This movie just isn't as good as everyone says it is.
I really wish someone would have the courage to say this movie sucks!  Everybody jump on the bandwagon, just because ""critics"" love it doesn't mean you have to give it glowing reviews too.  I understand, you have a reputation to keep up, what would the other people at the ""art-house"" say if you disagreed.  And why wouldn't you buy it, you need to own every film in the ""Criterion Collection""!  Come on, admit it, you also have The Rock, and Armageddon, and not because you like the films, you need to impress your friends.  It is really kind of sad actually seeing all these sheep leading other sheep. 2 stars at best.",1004054400,18,1313,4.345679012345679
1646789,5,B00005QAPH,"Criterion's Laser Disc Edition of 8 1/2 featured a stunning transfer of this...one of the most beautiful black-and-white cinematography ever shot. Of course, for their DVD edition, we can expect nothing less. And now, you have the great master Vittorio Storaro explaining how another great master, Gianni di Venanzo did all this and how it's important to the art of cinema.... already a hell of a good reason to own the DVD.
More than a simple autobiography of a filmmaker, 8 1/2 is a journey into the creative human mind, its agony, self doubts, moral and sexual confusion, and its redemption. The sturuggle of art versus life, and the endless search for a proper ballance. That's why, not only fimmakers but all sort of creative people call this ""the best film I have ever seen,"" ""the film that has influenced my life the most.""
Because the film is more a free description of the flow of the human mind, its consciousness as well as its sub-consciousness, than just an autobiography. If you sit back to see just a simple movie in which everything is used to explain a linear story, the film may be confusing. But once you free your mind and let the sweeping camera movements and the stunning, brilliant imagery guide you into the mind of the protagonist-director, I can assure you it will be one of the richest cinematic experience of your life, because then the film allows you to see the reflection of your own psychological life in it.
The special feature of the DVD includes a very rarely-seen self portrait-documentary by the genious himself, ""Fellini: a director's notebook"". I think it's the first time this forgotten film goes to home video, that's already another good reason to add this DVD to your collection. And it's a very appropriate choice to put this unknown, almost unseen masterpiece to Fellini's own official masterpiece 8 1/2.
But a bit distressing, since after all the proper ballance between life and creativity that Fellini seems to have achieved at the end of 8 1/2... well, when you see ""a director's notebook"" you see that the conflict is not resolved at all! But then to see ""Notebook"" and then go back to ""8 1/2"", you may be able to see it in a different perspective, so that's great!!
Life is a constant inner search and inner struggle; whether you will suffer from it and try constantly to escape, or you'll make your mind up to enjoy it since it will never go away anyway, that's up to you. And 8 1/2 is a film that will give you that energy, because it's also so funny. So get this DVD, and it sure will be a great companion to your entire life.",1001203200,12,2580,4.610869565217391
1646800,5,B00005QAPH,"When I first saw the movie, it took me quite a while to figure out what Fellini was trying to tell us. I guess he intended to ridicule himself as a filmmaker, and I find it hilarious and clever in a sensational way. This mesmerizing masterpiece would grip your attention simply with the bizarre and imaginative opening scene, which is really a cinematic feast.
Thanks to Criterion, 8 1/2 is finally on DVD with a load of special features. I found the following information from DVD Planet.

1646801,5,B00005QAPH,"I saw 81/2 when I was quite young and I was dazzled by it. Now when I view it I can relate to adult themes and I can comiserate with Fellini's lead character who is full of self doubt, regret, and yearns for the simple pleasures of the past. But 81/2 is not a great movie because it has a profound story; it's a great movie because it is a profound movie experience. Dreamlike, it is both exotic and familiar at the same time. Fellini presents his story without explanation or judgment so we are free to experience with him. Fellini's great artistry & theatricality open our eyes anew. And if that sounds too high minded to you it's also alot of fun.  Fellini's contribution to film is immense and he is still truly unique. There isn't a film maker who lived through the Fellini era that won't admit that they were influenced by Fellini. Yet, there no other filmmaker remotely like him; his films are a testament to his devotion to make films that express his personal vision.  There is a childlike quality to Fellini's films. Fellini understood that film has ability to create a unique experience for the viewer. I think that to see through someone else's eyes is one of our most cherished dreams and Fellini tries to provide that for us. I think what Fellini wanted was for us was to leave behind our own pretensions and assumptions and see the world innocently and with a sense of wonder.",988416000,2,1391,4.4940711462450595
1646802,3,B00005QAPH,"I was just getting into Foreign movies when I first saw this film. But, I never saw a Fellini movie before this one. I've heard people say this is Fellini's masterpiece. I've even been told by some, that this is one of the greatest films ever made! I don't think this is Fellini's masterpiece, to me that title belongs to ""Nights Of Cabiria"". And as for stating that this is one of the greatest movies ever filmmed, it just may as well be. Marcello Mastroianni stars as what we suspect to be a thin disguise of Fellini himself. He just can't seem to think of an ending for his new movie. After having dreams about flying over cars, due to his feeling ""closed in"" he is taken to a hospital where he can get some rest. Later he meets his wife at a train station. But, none of this is really important, I feel to the story. These aren't really the moment we remember about this film. It's those moments where Mastroianni's mind drifts. The scene where he meets his parents at the deserted area, or him thinking back to when he was a child, and meet a whore. It was these scene we become so taken with. Some might have a hard time getting everything in their very first viewing, and therefor my not like the film. I myself had to watch it twice. Truly a landmark film by Fellini, which won him (I believe) his first Oscar. If you enjoy this movie, I suggest ""La Stada"", ""The White Shiek"", ""Nights Of Cabiria"", and ""La Dolce Vita"". All are considered to be classic by my taste.",987033600,6,1472,4.317689530685921
1646803,5,B00005QAPH,"a great film with all kinds of stuff goin on.  beautiful cinematography (the opening sequence at a spa - every 80's CK add stole it's imagery), great acting (Marcello is dope and so is Anouk), transcendental and metaphysical retributions (what the hell does that mean??) and it's in Italian (my favorite lingua).  only thing missing is a young Sophia Loren (for that, check out 'Marriage Italian Style') who is one of the most beatiful actresses ever.
you'll enjoy this movie more if you see it sans subtitles, but still worth seeing if you hate foreign films in foreign languages...this reviewer also likes 'La Dolce Vita' and 'La Citta Delle Donne(Fellini's take on feminism)'.",981590400,,679,5.0
1646804,5,B00005QAPH,"Before I saw 8 1/2, I'd read the reviews. But nothing prepared me for the after effects. The first time I watched it I endured it. But then a curious thing happened the next day ... a peculiar mood came over me and I couldn't shake certain impressions the film left on me. So I watched it again and this time enjoyed the movie.  I would say forget the critics, forget the fact that it's supposed to be an ""autobiographical"" movie for Fellini. Chances are you'll find something, as I did, that is compelling to you. For me, the cinematography was crisp, the acting was superb (especially the lead), great fantasy and dream sequences that reveal subtexts and highten emotions. Sorry if this review is esoteric. It's a personal film for the director and I think he succeeded in presenting his vision. Like all ""personal"" masterpieces (i.e. Hitchcock's Vertigo), every viewer finds something personal and latches onto it. Enjoy.",979257600,5,924,4.811320754716981
1646805,5,B00005QAPH,"I must say that this dubbed version of what I consider to be the greatest film ever made is much easier to watch than the subtitled version, and I prefer it.  The trouble with the subtitled version is that it is white-on-white, which is quite difficult to read, and in trying to read it, one often misses the breathtaking images on the screen.  As a Fellini fanatic with somewhat purist tendencies, I do not regard the dubbed version as inauthentic, as Fellini himself redubbed the speech onto the original Italian version, and, I may say, that even in the Italian version, the speech doesn't always match the movement of the actors' lips.  Regardless of the slight difference between the movement of the lips and the speech in the redubbed English version, I think that it is far preferable to agonizing over the hard-to-read subtitles.  Now if only I could find a letterboxed version. . .",979257600,6,890,4.72258064516129
1646806,4,B00005QAPH,"This beautifully filmed story features an extremely charismatic performance by Marcello Mastroianni as Guido, an Italian director with a really cool hat and glasses combo but no idea about how to bring his next movie together. As the pressures of of the production bear in on him, he retreats first to a spa, and then into his fantasies, most of which involve women.
The whole thing is a collection of amazing scenes. If only there weren't so many actresses and mistresses and wives, they all run together -- especially when it seems that most of the scenes are filmed with improvised dialogue. The video release contains white-on-white subtitling, so that just makes things even more confusing.",977011200,,695,5.0

This movie is an excellent introduction to Fellini and to world cinema in general. The acting is great, the black-and-white is never distracting, Guido's dreams are excellently executed, and the characters are memorable. This is a movie that one's like-minded friends must watch! This film stands as tough competition for ""Citizen Kane"" as the greatest film in history. I'm looking forward to a lifetime of enjoying this film.",973555200,3,567,4.737373737373737
1646808,5,B00005QAPH,Fantastic Federico Fellini feature film. I can't wait to have this on DVD. The viewer just glides through beautiful images only Fellini could create.  The Wagnerian music compliments Nino Rotta's magical score. Watch La Dolce  Vita first if you've never watched a Fellini film before because this film  is stricly and essentially Fellini!,966729600,,338,5.339622641509434
1646809,5,B00005QAPH,"from what i have read in fellini interviews and his own writings, he was not a terribly interesting person.  we can feel comfort with that in academic studies until the bulb flickers, and the first scene of this movie  start.  this is probably the first of the film making films that dive to  the gut of artistry.  alcoholism, hedonism, selfishness, ridiculous.  he  makes a film about being alive, italian, frustrated, alive, a film about  coming to town with a plate of meat and cheese at your beck and call, and  then wanting to send it through the window for no other reason then it is.  fellini, like fante, felt what it was like to be italian.  like goddard  knew what it was like to be french.",961372800,,700,4.468253968253968

7949984,4,B00005QAPH,"I miss out on why 8 1/2 is so highly ranked among movies--perhaps it's better understood by film students and professionals--but it does have a quality of magic. The notes furnished with the film offer useful insight--that this is a movie about a director who's unsure what his next movie will be about, by a director unsure of what his next movie will be about. The film remarkably follows the structure and character of a dream--odd characters appearing at odd times and scenarios--so it can appear disjointed and confusing. Taking it in requires patience and curiosity, an effort that proves well worthwhile, as Fellini masterfully brings all together in the end.

Just one more thing--during filming, Fellini kept a note on hand to remind him, ""Remember--it's a comedy."" Viewers should so the same. Don't take it too seriously!",1517011200,,831,5.021739130434782

7949987,5,B00005QAPH,"There are very few films that I've seen in my life which leave me speechless with awe and this is one of them!  I've seen ""La Dolce Vita"" and while I like that film a lot in my opinion ""8 1/2"" is by far his best and is also among the best ever films ever made.  I would love to describe this film but that would be doing it a great injustice as no words could do justice to this cinematic experience.  Needless to say this film is among those I can count on my fingers as ones that will get repeated annual viewings.  To call this a masterpiece would be a gross understatement.  The good news is that Criterion's transfer is very good leaving nothing to complain about with regards picture and sound quality.  Also included is a 32-page booklet containing essays on the film and the director.  Every movie buff and fan of great cinema needs to have this in their video library.

Very highly recommended!",1511222400,3,903,4.333333333333333
