8363450,5,B002C7ELNG,"My 2 favorite episodes on this DVD set are ""Deadly Heist"" and ""The Search For Lisa Renee"". The Lisa Renee case gets to me the most. Here is an innocent child home minding her own business and doing her homework. All of the sudden, Lisa is brutally kidnapped by four dangerous men for something that was not her fault in any way whatsoever! She was tortured and repeatedly raped for the next four days and then brutally murdered in an especially cold and cruel manner! I hope that Bruce Webster and Daryl Hall get what's coming to them! The other 2 pieces of crap should have gotten the death penalty, too! Lisa's brothers should have been charged with negligence that resulted in her death.",1435017600,,690,4.57258064516129

8363454,4,B002C7ELNG,"Hard evidence. Hard Science. Real Justice. Whether it handles bullets or bombs, fingerprints or fibers, the FBI's crime lab - the largest facility in the world - takes on tough cases, grappling with fraud, drug trafficking, kidnapping and murder, extortion and terrorism. The FBI Files is a show describing actual FBI cases, with dramatic reenactments and interviews with agents and forensic scientists who worked in the investigations. If you enjoy watching shows like Forensic Files, Dateline NBC, 48 Hours Mysteries or Unsolved Mysteries then you'll enjoy watching this show.

Season 4 is a very solid season. On this DVD set you'll find 18 investigations. Each episode is 45 minutes long.

8363455,5,B002C7ELNG,"I've been watching The FBI Files on the Discovery Channel for many years (re-runs nowadays, since the show was cancelled in 2006).  The show ran from 1998-2006.  It's a high quality ""who-dunnit"" show that is narrated by Anthony Call (A Haunting).  This show describes real-life FBI cases and reenacts the crimes and investigations of murders, bank robberies, kidnappings, bombings, and much more.  The actual FBI agents assigned to the cases are interviewed as well as the forensic scientists involved in solving the cases.  Anthony Call is the perfect narrator for the series.  The actors used in the reenactments do a good job and the reenactments are convincingly believable.  Overall, the production quality is high.

Season Four contains some of the best episodes, my favorites being Deadly Secrets, Hidden Agenda, Held For Ransom, and Betrayed.  My personal favorite season is Season Five, but it hasn't been released on DVD yet.  All seasons are good, though.

I highly recommend this series if you have never seen it before.",1298764800,2,1032,5.156626506024097
8363456,5,B002C7ELNG,"I am a big fan of this series which ran for many years on the Discovery Channel. The production company that handled this show and other great series (New Detectives and A Haunting, both excellent shows) has a great blend of action along with interviews of both law enforcement and relatives of family members intersped with the recreations. Tony Call does an excellent job with the narration that gives information about the cases. I was sorry to see it cancelled. Some of the new shows now on the Investigation Discovery opt for the hand held camera movement with quick cuts that don't always work so well. The FBI files was entertaining and informative. This season had several kidnappings (including a few that had happy endings), bank robberies and murders. While some cases are solved with assistance of the public, solid police investigation is bedrock of the majority of the cases. This was a solid season and I recommend it.

 This set has four discs with the following episodes:

Disc One
The Search for Lisa Renee (a heartbreaker)
Hidden Agenda
Small Town Terror
A Family Torn

Disc Two
Vanished
Deadly Heist
Unlawful Flight
Deadly Secrets (another heartbreaker, this story has been featured on Forensic Files as well)

Disc Three
Death in the Delta
Lost Boys
Deadly Threat
Evil Intent (A happy ending kidnapping story)
The Coffee Shop Murders

Disc Four
Without Remorse
Global Pursuit (Early terrorism case, successfully handled-one of the best of this set)
Betrayed
When Seconds Count
Held for Ransom

I don't want to give too much away, but if you are a fan of investigative stories this is a great set. While I have seen a great deal of Forensic Files, The FBI files does contain many cases that I have not heard about before.",1276300800,9,1741,4.841750841750842
8363457,5,B002C7ELNG,"I own all 4 sets of FBI files and have enjoyed them all. This one was special because it actaully had three cases in which the kidnapped victim lived. If you enjoy this type show, (cops, forensic, true crime) you will want to add the FBI files to your collection. Some of the stories I had herd about and some were new to me. You hear from the investigators, and a few of the victims or family members. The stories vary from kidnaps, to robberies, to murders. We enjoyed them all",1265414400,9,479,4.274725274725275
