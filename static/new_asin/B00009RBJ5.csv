7992762,5,B00009RBJ5,good way to get it down Curt shows the licks slow so you can figure it out..,1442880000,,76,3.5294117647058822
7992763,1,B00009RBJ5,"Curt Mitchell doesn't know how to teach anyone.
You're buying a DVD which shows a rather unprofessional guy play a set of random ACDC licks. He doesn't offer any insight at all on how to play these licks or the theory that goes behind them.",1266019200,,240,4.355555555555555
7992764,5,B00009RBJ5,Great dvd.  Don't pay any attention to the rest of the reviews written by guitarist that wish they could play as good as Curt Mitchell.,1249344000,,135,4.4
7992765,3,B00009RBJ5,LIKE SAID IT DOES  NOT  CONTAIN  AC/DC... I WISH IT DID.,1162512000,,56,3.909090909090909
7992766,1,B00009RBJ5,"He does not go into detail like he should. Just a very poor attempt at teaching. Some people can play. Some people can teach, He can not teach.. I do not recommend this for anyone  ...",1133481600,6,184,4.111111111111111
7992767,1,B00009RBJ5,"Don't bother to buy this. Curt cant play Young riffs better than you probably already can, and he didn't even bother to get a Gibson SG and right amp settings for the occasion. These lessons won't teach you ANYTHING about Angus/Malcolm Young techniques. He just plays some riffs you can find on hundreds of TAB sites and thousands of books.",1110067200,14,340,4.683333333333334
7992768,1,B00009RBJ5,"I bought the definitive ac/dc tab book that has like 85 of thier songs in it, learned a lot of the songs, and then bought the ac/dc guitar method dvd. I couldn't wait to be able to play along to the songs to know if I was doing it all right. When I watched it, he shows you different ways of playing the songs that are much easier, but once again, you can only watch him play it or watch the tabs and hear it. If you cant play any ac/dc then you can get it if you want to but I wouldn't suggest it. If you can read tabs, then get the definitive ac/dc tab book. It is alot better bang for your buck. Overall, Curt Mitchell is a great guitar player but not as good of a teacher.",1088812800,6,676,3.835714285714286
7992769,3,B00009RBJ5,"First off let me say Curt Mitchell seems to be an excellent guitarist and could probably play anything.  On this DVD he covers the best of AC-DC's best.  Some are just the main licks and others show the entire song's guitar parts.
Be advised that this is a low budget DVD meaning Curt is filmed in full frontal playing the riff at normal speed and then playing the same riff played at a slower speed with just a closeup of the guitar neck.  Although he provides the sheet music for all riffs in another section of the DVD, Curt doesn't provide any real verbal instruction(doesn't mention what cords are used in the riff or distinguish the picking style, etc..) and there are no onscreen diagrams or typed instruction.  Unless you can read sheet music real well, you are unfortunately left to try and figure out what cords he's fingering by constantly rewinding and using the repeat feature on your DVD player. Hard to distinguish at the angle this was filmed at...
Curt: Try using more verbal instruction as you are teaching(ie:call out the cords as you play them)and realize that most who order this DVD cannot read sheet music. Some graphics of the guitar neck or other onscreen printed instruction would be helpful and does not require much technology.  My twelve year old is having a real hard time without my help.
All in all this is a great way to learn great riffs from one of the worlds GREATEST bands presented by a guy who really knows and loves great classic rock and roll!!  I'm glad this DVD series is available!!!",1088640000,8,1527,4.595588235294118
