1199923,5,B00000F0HC,"This Troma DVD represents amazing value for money with two films on the disc plus the kind of extras for the main feature you used to get from Anchor Bay and Blue Underground all for a super low price. The picture and sound quality are both acceptable for such a rare movie, which is not a classic, but is very good for such a low budget production, with some creepy-ish moments and sprinklings of gore, but the desolate village location and underground scenes are effectively distinctive from other pictures of this genre. Paul Naschy steals every scene he's in and no-one puts in a shoddy performance. I'd never seen this film before, but I'm proud to add it to my collection. I can only hope Troma gains the support of horror fans enabling them to acquire more rare treats to pour some love over, the DVD case is nice too in a white case with terrific cover art. My 5 star rating is for the overall package of value and love shown to fans by Troma.",1255132800,17,951,4.409090909090909

1199925,5,B00000F0HC,"The recent Troma DVD is the best option to date for watching this gloomy, atmospheric chiller about the walking dead.  Most versiosn are missing gore or nudity, but Troma has taken great pains to present a complete presentation, albiet sourced from a few different places.  Teh film is presneted with the English dub ( no original Spanish with English subs ) and with all the 'good bits' intact.
The disc really excells in the extra department as well, with three interviews with the people responsible for it's creation, a director's commentary track in Spanish with English subtitles, a trailer and poster gallery, and a complete second feature, THE SWEET SOUND OF DEATH from 1965.
If you are a fan of Spanish horror or Paul Naschy ( he is very good here in a supporting role )you simply cannot go wrong here, especially for the asking price.",1254355200,25,844,4.773972602739726
1199926,2,B00000F0HC,"Orgy of the Dead (Jos&eacute; Luis Merino, 1973)

Oh, my, what insanity came out of the Spanish horror mills in the 1970s. Orgy of the Dead (known alternately as The Return of the Zombies or The Hanging Woman in various parts of the world), one of Merino's final potboilers before his semi-retirement in 1974, is about as derivative as they come, roping in various pieces of Spanish, British, and Italian low-budget horror flicks (most notably de Ossorio's Tombs of the Blind Dead, from 1971) and adding in a few touches to make it just different enough that the rubes would pay to see it all again. If you take away the zombies (who really only show up in the final twenty or so minutes of the film), you're left with a pretty standard murder mystery; Serge (Stelvio Rosi in his final screen appearance) has just inherited his uncle's rural estate. On the way there, when he's forced to walk because no one in the village will take him out the cemetery road at night, he spies a body hanging in the cemetery itself. When he gets to the estate, he finds that the body was that of his niece, and that he's suddenly become the prime suspect in her murder. Added to this is the cast of odd characters who already inhabit the house, including an imperious butler, a mad scientist and his lovely daughter, a black magician, and, of course, cult actor Paul Naschy as the gravedigger. (The film is, these days, only remembered because Naschy, who will be recognizable to Sci-Fi Channel Original Movie fans from his recent turn in Rottweiler, is in it.)

But, of course, you can't take away the zombies, with their incredibly bad make-up jobs and wooden acting (that's actually better than some of the supposedly more sentient members of the cast). Once you've got zombies, you've gone from below-average giallo knockoff to really, really bad horror movie. If you thought that no-talent horror movies were the product of cheap video cameras, think again; someone actually gave Merino a budget for this mess. Still, it's fascinating, in a train-wreck sort of way. **",1238371200,2,2057,4.727019498607242
1199927,3,B00000F0HC,"I bought ""The Hanging Woman"" from Amazon. Com for two reasons. A, once I found out what the story was, I was really interested, and B, look how cheap it is! Perfect.
The story is about a man named Serge who, upon  his arrival in some small village in the 19th Century, comes across a  woman's hanging body. He finds the family of the woman, and thus, he stays  with them. (?) Well, a lot of the movie is a jumble. An investigation on  the woman's supposed murder, a woman at the house who is involved with  black magic and some ugly necrophiliac guy who lives under the house, and  the owner of the house being a scientist experimenting with the dead. This  somehow all comes together when Serge and Doris, the scientist's daughter,  team up to solve some of these mysteries. It climaxes with the dead rising  in the caves under the house, with Doris trapped in there, and Serge  fighting off death up at the house as the mystery of it all starts to come  into place.
There are some genuinely scary scenes, and some blood, but  other than that, not much. The ending is a shock, and one of the best I've  seen in a long time. For that, I have to give this movie some points. But  other than that, it is pretty weak, especially for a zombie film. If you  are looking for standard horror, check this out, if you are looking for a  zombie movie, avoid this and find something else.",936576000,11,1377,4.299610894941634

7906213,4,B00000F0HC,"OK typical early 70's Euro horror flick with blood and nudity.  A man goes to his uncle's home and finds him and his uncle's daughter dead, leaving him the heir.  His uncle's second wife gets only what the law allows, basically the shaft.  She richly deserves it as she is a manipulator and out for whatever she can get.  But that is a minor part of the story.  What goes on is people dropping like flies and coming back as decaying zombies.  The heir is something of a jerk, but the real highlight is Paul Naschy (Jacinto Molino) in a bit part as a perverted gravedigger who likes to get it on with female corpses.  ICK.  The town, filmed at some obscure European location, is as dreary as all get out.  The Troma DVD release is not perfect but is very good quality.  The DVD has a lot of extras including the trailer and a second feature, The Sweet Sound of Death, which I have yet to view.  Recommended for Euro horror movie fans.",1440806400,,933,4.304597701149425

7906215,4,B00000F0HC,"I finally got around to watching this Troma package of a Paul Naschy title that was kicked around in bottom of the barrel VHS releases back in the eighties usually under the title 'BEYOND THE LIVING DEAD'.  Director Jose Luis Merino's 'LA ORGIA DE LOS MUERTOS' aka 'THE HANGING WOMAN' aka 'TERROR OF THE LIVING DEAD'- 1970 or if you prefer the bargain basement title is not quite the lost masterpiece that the DVD box insinuates.  Building it up as a Naschy title, he merely appears sporadically throughout the film as a handyman named Igor.  Actually, the film is dominated by actors Stelvio Rosi as a young nobleman seeking his inheritance and Maria Pia Conte as Nadia who is the patriarch of the family and has quirks such as dabbling in black magic , fornicating with Igor for her kinky pleasures and sponsoring the Frankenstein-like experiments of the family doctor played by Euro stalwart Gerard Tichy.  The script tries to make it into a gothic Horror but gets bogged down by long stretches of dialogue and when the doctor's zombie army finally appear, the film is already over. Director Merino's only other horror credit that I have seen is 'SCREAM OF THE DEMON LOVER' also 1970 and is not much better.  What Troma probably didn't realize is that they spotlighted the work of an underrated Spanish actress named Dyanika Zurakowska who appears in this film plus the other extra feature included in the package which was her first screen venture Director Javier Soto's 'THE SWEET SOUND OF DEATH' aka 'LA LLAMADA'- 1965.  If you want to see how a good atmospheric Horror can be done with little money and care, choose this one over the Naschy vehicle.  'SWEET SOUND' belongs in the same class as two other sixties Black & White sleepers Director Herk Harvey's 'CARNIVAL OF SOULS'- 1962 and Director Curtis Harrington's 'NIGHT TIDE'-1961 as an eerie tone poem dealing with love after death.  With gorgeous chiarascuro photography taking place in an ancient, deserted cemetery and a massive, crumbling chateau, it boggles the mind that this film is never talked about in any horror tomes or blogs.  Dyanika is quite memorable and lingers in the mind long after the film fades too black.  Director Soto seems to have stopped making films after 1969 with an Italian Giallo 'MACABRE' starring Giacomo Rossi Stuart and Silvana Venturelli who did many erotic films with Director Radley Metzger.  He also directed a rare epic 'THE CASTILIAN'-1963 with Cesar Romero. The film is presented by Sydney Pink responsible for a number of low grade Danish Sci-Fi films such as 'REPTILICUS'-1960 being unleashed in this country.  Dyanika would star again with Naschy in his Vladimer Daninsky werewolf film Director Enrique Lopez Equiuz's 'FRANKENSTEIN'S BLOODY TERROR'- 1968 and Director Leon Klimovsky's 'THE VAMPIRE'S NIGHT ORGY' -1974 and if you have a keen eye for beauty, a quick cameo in actor Burt Reynolds's only Spaghetti Western, Director Sergio Corbucci's 'NAVAJO JOE' -1968.  The package is loaded with extras: An interview with actor Paul Naschy reveling about his role in the film yet anyone could have played the part since its so brief; Audio Commentary and isolated interview with the Director Merino; an interesting interview with Ben Tatar who did the dubbing on many Euro films including 'SWEET SOUND OF DEATH', a featurette called Paul Naschy 101 introducing viewers to his films and original theatrical trailers and photo galleries.  Both films are presented in their 1.85 ratios and look great making 'THE HANGING WOMAN' the best quality transfer yet.  But this package belongs to beautiful Dyanika and the four star rating is for 'THE SWEET SOUND OF DEATH'.  Thank you, Troma Films, for introducing this atmospheric rarity on the afterlife to Horror fans.  It's a creepy bit of celluloid that leaves 'THE HANGING WOMAN' completely in the dust and.., well.., hanging.",1347580800,2,3878,5.006220839813375

7906218,2,B00000F0HC,"Although I am an admitted lover of horror films, and I admire the Troma team in New York for bringing this Euro-horror thriller to DVD, this is certainly no BLACK SUNDAY or CASTLE OF BLOOD, two of the best of the Euro-cycle in this genre. Restoring or re-releasing under-rated films is a praise-worthy pursuit and Troma should be lauded for this practice alone -- but why they chose this production with its tepid scare tactics is as unclear as some of the images shown in this washed-out color process.

Paul Naschy, well-known for other Euro-trash, appears here in a supporting role. The discussion of this actor included on this DVD suggests that he is someone significant in the horror genre, like Barbara Steele -- someone who might be worthy of a film festival. Maybe this is the case for some of his fans, but his brain-dead performance in this opus suggests nothing worthy of lengthy admiration. When he is killed off about mid-way through the film, the plot, such as it is, seems not to suffer for his absence.

The film does have a couple of beautiful women on hand -- but they are not exactly utilized on-screen in flattering ways. One is shown in a love clinch with the long-haired protagonist. . . shown whirling about, that is, when two are shown naked in bed. Why the director decided to spin the camera around like a top when they are in a non-erotic embrace is not made evident. Is this supposed to be some sort of artistic statement? The blonde actress is cute enough, but why she is shown baring her insignificant breasts to the hero -- who quickly chides her for her exposure -- is also not made evident. Nudity for a purpose -- even if it is only meant to be titillating (pun not originally intended) -- is acceptable for some of us red-blooded males, but in the case of this film, it really does seem to be gratuitous and unexciting.

Perhaps there are a few moment in this film worthy of mentioning. If so, they elude me. Other Spanish horror films -- although nothing like the Brit horror films like THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE and American horror films like THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES -- are significant enough to be re-stored or re-mastered or re-claimed or re. . . something or other. This one ain't, folks. Sorry. Liked the description of it and fell for it. I regret that now.

Other good horror films are out there. Spend your time searching for them. I like to be as positive as I can in my reviews, but this one is probably not worth your time. If you bought it and you like it and you are offended -- my apologies again. Taste is subjective, and nothing, as a professor in graduate school stated, beats interest. If seeing unreal-looking rotting corpses and non-erotic nudity is your cup of tea, have a sip, but don't say I didn't warn you.",1278633600,3,2766,4.526
7906219,4,B00000F0HC,"Troma's release of ""The Hanging Woman"" is flawed, but probably this is the sort of film that may never get to feel the loving touch of the restorer.  Right off, one may notice that it plays like a pretty low-quality VHS tape.  After a bit, you will notice that the picture changes...this was clearly pieced together from various sources to present the film as completely ""uncut"" as possible.  Who knows if this is actually every part of this hithertofore hacked-up film?  It seems to flow pretty well, but there are a few apparent ""lapses"", which may simply be due to the bizarre directorial technique used in many such films!  This is dubbed in English...that's it.  Not other language/soundtrack/subtitle choice.  IN MY OPINION, this is one of the most classic examples of 60s-70s Euro-Gothic (and by ""Gothic"" I don't mean rich, dejected whiners with the lastest shade of black fingernail polish who are REALLY afraid of the dark and would die of an apoplectic seizure before letting a real vampire come anywhere near them) genre.  The buildings and their environs are spot-on, the various CATACOMBS we are treated to are deliciously creepy and usually well-lit (unrealistic, I know, but preferable to the UN-lit sets we sometimes see!), some of the characters have a tangible PERSONALITY(all parts are good-to-well acted, especially the kind've cool cat hero played by Stelvio Rosi's alter ego ""Stan Cooper"" and the wacky, blustery detective), there are instances of nudity and even semi-steamy sex, some keen NON-computer-animated GORE...and some really, really eerie corpses...dead AND living ones!  From what I recall from the too-many-for-my-own-good Horror films I've seen, these are some of the coolest and most unique corpses I've seen.  No they are not scientifically correct, no they are not super-Tom Savini style, but they definitely impress. This was some make-up artist's idea of turning living actors into very gruesome dessicated monuments to death.  Not much gore drooling and flesh ripping for these revenants, just plain super DEAD good looks.  Really elevates this film above the competition.  Plenty of graveyard lurking and yes, Paul Naschy rolls his eyes as a gravedigger named IGOR who prefers the exact opposite of the HOT BABE that offers herself to him.  Naschy is not a major character, however.  AS EXCELLENT AS THAT ALL SOUNDS, though, this film suffers from pacing.  It isn't nearly as bad as some such films, as it does have a lot sprinkled throughout to keep ones interest, but there were a few longish segments when I was tempted to hit the FF on the remote; I did not because the story is just intriguing enough to make you actually want to pay attention...and, yes, most of the mysterious happenings are explained (another cut-above other such films!).  If you like ANY Euro-Gothic films, you will beyond any doubt like this one; you will want to watch it again, but upon subsequent viewings you'll know which segments to FF over!  There is another full-length movie included on this, called ""Sweet Sound of Death"", but I haven't watched it yet...according to my research it has one of the main females from ""The Hanging Woman"", Dyanik Zurakowska(Polish?).  It is from 1965, B+W, and about 87 min. long.  The other bonus features I looked at are the trailer (pretty funny, with a female announcer intoning all the usual warnings of shock!), and a gallery of poster art and lobby cards, which is quite voluminous.  Not a great movie, but quite ahead of most of the similar pack.",1266105600,4,3515,4.994854202401372
