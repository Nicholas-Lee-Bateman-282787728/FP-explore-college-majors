503006,5,6302719666,"The title STALKER is quite misunderstood because many think it is a translation from a Russian word that means 'to stalk.'. Actually Tarkovsky's script inserted the word STALKER thinking it was a catchy  English equivalent for something like a Russian pathfinder or guide. In  that context, the central character's role is better understood, for he  spends time leading the writer and scientist toward discovery and  revelation, which they ultimately cannot achieve. STALKER is a masterpiece  of imposed reality on the viewer. Make no mistake: this film is very  difficult to stay with without your utmost attention. Little artifice, few  physical elements, hardly any plot, STALKER exists as a journey that draws  your mind, heart, and soul into the nature of human existence. Only those  intelligent and sensitive enough to ride Tarkovsky's waves of feeling,  emotion, and thought can comprehend his message of possible salvation and  redemption through love and persistent searching for human truth. The  writing on the video box implies this is another sci fi film, but clearly  it is not. Tarkovsky's great films are mythical allegories in the tradition  of Pilgrim's Progress or Piers Plowman. For me, Tarkovsky is the ultimate  challenge in intellectual film making, because he presents and discusses  his ideas only in the context of the film itself, not just as a media  vehicle to speak. What strikes me most is his absolutely consistent sense  of pace in all his films: slow, deliberate, but fluid and highly organic.  He is one of the few great masters of film as an art form.",930700800,152,1588,5.108949416342412
503007,5,6302719666,"As the one-star review below indicates, this film  isn't for everyone, especially Americans weaned on LETHAL WEAPON, FACE OFF, or CON-AIR.  As is the case with all Tarkovsky's films (especially NOSTALGHIA, my favorite),  each scene here is laid out as a tableau to linger over meticulously, and  the subject matter is profoundly spiritual.  As  always, Tarkovsky is  broaching the uneasy subject  of faith and intellect.  (Pay special  attention, near the end of the film, to the background in the scene where  the ""stalker"" anguishes over the writer's and physicist's lack of  faith.)  Tarkovsky is as essential to serious late 20th-Century film as  Bergman, and may actually have a more visible (technical) influence on  popular contemporary directors: Wim Wenders (his  earlier, better films),  Ridley Scott (his earlier, better films), and even someone as whacky as Tim  Burton.",930614400,2,882,5.360294117647059
503008,5,6302719666,"Describing Tarkovsky to those who didn't see his films is quite impossible.""Stalker"" is in many ways his most radical film. An uncompromising meditation on the search for truth, God, happiness. A very  demanding film, not for anyone's taste, to say the least.

503009,5,6302719666,"You have to like beautiful, contemplative films to like this movie. Lots of conversation, very little action as a group of men try to find the a way to fulfill their hearts' greatest desire. The problem is that fulfilling  our greatest desires may tell us things about ourselves that we don't want  to know. At times you feel as though Tarkovsky found this wonderful piece  of property and made a movie like kids play in their backyards. ""What  if?"" ""Yeh, and what if?"" Imagine Foucault's Pendulum on  video. If you want guns and explosions, you will hate this movie. If you  need a clear plot you will hate this movie. If you have a low threshold of  boredom you will be asleep within minutes. But if you are looking for the  perfect film to go with a French Pinot, pears and brie baked in bread, the  kind of film you can actually talk about long into the evening without ever  coming to an agreement, this should be at the top of your list. In the five  years since I first saw it, I have yet to see a film that would bump it  from my all time top ten list.

503072,5,6302719666,"I enjoyed this new version of Stalker. I did not mind the yellow sepia ish effect. This movie reminds me of 3 guys who just took some wet mushrooms as opposed to dry. When you take them wet it's like this deep concentration and time and space seem to not flow in the normal way humans perceive it. The whole film is like that deep self examination that you go through during a serious psychedelic experience. This movie is like watching 3 guys trip out. I love this film. I was a little on the fence about the new transfer but quickly came to love it. I have thought for years that Andrei Rebleiv is my favorite Tarkovsky film and i still hold that opinion because i feel it is the ultimate ode to real artists. Stalker is a film that is growing on me. It does seem to have a direct message while most of tarkovskies films leave more to ponder. That is not a downside, i am just stressing it took me longer to get into this one.  I now put this in the top 4 with nostalgia, the mirror, and andret r.",1516838400,2,999,4.123076923076923

503075,1,6302719666,"This review applies only to the Criterion Collection version of the film. Normally, learning that Criterion has acquired a film is a reason to celebrate. Their masterful restoration of Satyajit Ray's Apu Trilogy is nothing short of a miracle. So it pains me to have to say this, but they have utterly ruined this film. How, you ask; by turning the opening and closing Black and White sequences to YELLOW. Those sequences are some of the greatest moments in cinema. Scenes of stark black and white with a slight sepia tint (reddish-brown) are now bright and Yellow. Why? Even in the interview with Geoff Dyer on the supplemental disc he describes those sequences as black and white; and the startling affect of the change to color when our protagonists arrive in the Zone as being akin to arriving in Oz. Not any more. The stark, dreary, post-apocalyptic landscape of the original film has been replaced with a brighter, sunnier, drenched in yellow, sunlit world. It makes no sense, and it looks bad. Of all the films to screw up, why did they have to screw up this one. If ever there was a film actually worthy of the over abused word ""masterpiece"", this is it. If you wish to experience the true majesty and mystery of Tarkovsky's 'Stalker' I would suggest getting the original KINO version on dvd. Criterion's ""restoration"" is NOT an improvement of the film, but rather a diminishment.",1514332800,7,1387,4.759336099585062
503076,5,6302719666,"Fantastic re-imagining of the (even better) book. Dreamy and surreal, Tarkovsky works within his technical and budget limitations to produce his usual otherworldly mystical visions, but fair warning this is not Science Fiction the way most Science Fiction is Science Fiction: you need to be patient, attentive and open-minded to enjoy Stalker.",1513728000,,343,5.615384615384615
503077,4,6302719666,"Widely regarded as Tarkovski's ""Solaris"" sequel ""Stalker"" is a different film but only a little so as once again the director chooses to focus more on the cerebral, human issues rather than on the ""science"" in this sci-fi offering.  Tarkovski gives a wink to and seems to make fun of the parts of the audience expecting ""Solaris Pt 2"" by including a strange scene in the beginning of the protagonist's wife writhing on the floor in a kind of painful ecstasy/torment which clearly imitates the scene with the frozen female lead in ""Solaris"".  Otherwise this film deals with the true inner desires of man and whether he is truly ready to face them when given the opportunity or is he just too afraid and so is this endeavour a foolish and pointless one?  Maybe what we truly desire is something very different from what we think and can only be provided for spiritually and not materially?  As all great classic films do this one challenges the audience and not just with the long nearly 3 hour length but it does make you think and assess your own views and values.  Just like ""Solaris"" this film raises spiritual questions but in a subtle enough way to avoid/confound the Soviet censors.

This Criterion release is as expected a well restored picture and sound quality version with a foldout containing an essay on the film also included with the blu ray disc.  There is no doubting the master Tarkovsky's brilliant direction and while this is not his best ever film like say ""The Mirror"" or ""Andrei Rublev"" this is still a classic worthy of any serious film buff's video library.

Highly recommended!",1511395200,3,1601,4.71326164874552

Tarkovsky tries to look for hope somewhere, but it is not to be found.  The film is slow and daunting. I'd watch the half hour documentary to get what the film is about and to hear about some of Tarkovsky's take on how to make a movie.  Some of this is pretty interesting, but please don't sit through the whole film, for it will break you.  The Godless, dirty and violent landscape just crushes you. The cinematography and art direction are in places quite stunning, thus the three stars ( otherwise one), but the portions that are in B&W are not black and white, but piss yellow and black and when it switches to color, it is of wasteland of green surrounding rusted tanks or downed power lines.

503118,5,6302719666,"Andre Tarkovsky's last film to be shot in Russia, ""Stalker"" does a nice job of summarizing many of the themes that dominated his work as a film director. If you haven't seen a film by his before, keep in mind that he tends to have languid pacing for his films.

The film chronicles the journey of three men looking for a room in an area called The Zone heavily guarded by the military. The title character leads those who desire to go there for money. The route they take is never straight forward and they can't go back the way they came. The film defies many of the conventions of western (and even Russian) filmmaking with the narrative never exactly as it seems and with surprises that unfold about each character.

This was the last film that Tarkovsky directed that he shot in his native country and the film is loosely based on the science fiction novel Roadside Picnic written by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky (who also wrote the screenplay). Tarkovsky, his wife, one of the actors all died less than a decade after the film and it has been suggested that this was due to the toxic chemicals they were exposed to during the location shooting of the film.

The Criterion release provides us with a wonderful looking presentation of the film. The original aspect ratio (1.37:1) is used to present the film and the new 2K transfer improves on previous versions of the film on home video. The audio remains serviceable with a 1.00 mono . presentation. Subtitles are presented in English providing a solid translating of the Russian dialog.

The special features are an appreciation by writer Geoff Dryer (what can does not come with subtitles for the hearing impaired) who at first dismissed the film but still found it fasincating enough to come back to eventually developing an appreciation for the film. We also get video interviews some of which date from 1996 featuring the director of photography, editor of the film and the composer of the music. These run for a grand total of a little over 41 minutes and feature English subtitles.

Tarkovsky's film is a fascinating journey that reveals far more about the characters than it does the story. Criterion has done an exceptionally good job with this reissue.",1503014400,9,2216,4.730569948186528

503154,4,6302719666,"So this is specifically in regards to the quality of the Criterion release. The movie itself is a masterpiece.

As far as the quality of the transfer is concerned, it's as good as we're going to get when it comes to Stalker. It's presented in its original format which looks to be close to 4:3 (officially 1.37:1, whereas 4:3 is essentially 1.33:1). The film used was Kodak 5247, which means there is a lot of grain present in the image. Thankfully, in comparison to the DVD versions and earlier, Criterion seem to have cleaned it up as best as they can. It's not an eye-popping change. That's my reason for the 4/5 rating. Call me ""spoiled"" but I was just slightly disappointed that this wonderful film lacked more visual clarity.

In addition, the sepia tone used during the first half hour of the film seems to have been dialed up a little bit. In comparison to earlier versions, the Criterion release sports a very yellow--almost golden--tone. I feel it provides for a more striking change when the film switches to color once the gang arrives in the Zone. Speaking of, the movie just continues to shine more beautifully as the film progresses from locale to locale.

The sound quality is superb. Soft audio, like Beethoven playing being played during the opening of the film, is just that much more present this time around. The actor's dialogue has always appeared to be ADR'd to hell, so at some points it can be a little distracting. Environmental sounds are wonderful, from the clanking of the tracks as the trolley approaches the zone, to the moving sound of water during the Stalker's more reflective moments. The sound design has always seemed to be a mixture of dreaminess and surrealism.

In all, the movie itself is a stone-cold masterpiece. One I will return to at least once a year. The Criterion release, I feel, will be the best transfer this film will ever have. For that, I am very happy.",1501718400,16,1909,4.6726190476190474

503156,5,6302719666,"I just got the Criterion blu ray and the picture quality is greatly improved, as well as the sound. I was disappointed in the supplements/extras and think my old Kino dvd version has better extra features.
If you have watched any Tarkovsky movies, you are aware that he is one of the greatest directors ever; however, you have to be prepared to watch his movies. The films will drain you mentally and Stalker is probably the most brutal of Tarkovsky's films to watch. Stalker moves at it's own deliberate pace and you have to have patience or you will get bored; this is not a Hollywood blockbuster with hyper-pacing, loud explosions and throwaway dialogue. It doesn't help American viewers that the characters are Russian and come from different mindsets. This is not going to be a film for everyone, it has three unhappy ugly dudes talking philosophically while slowly walking.
Stalker requires several viewings to start reaping it's rewards, but the film transcends the screen and takes the viewer on a journey that comments on spirituality (the Stalker), science (the Professor) and commercialism (the Writer).
The ending shot with the child (Monkey) always leaves me wondering how it was pulled off. I think probably with magnets under the table, but perhaps it is best just to watch it and marvel at the brillance of Tarkovsky as a director and the difficulties he overcame during the making of Stalker, to give us one of cinema's greatest masterpieces.",1501200000,13,1459,4.934959349593496

And soon after I got it I found out Criterion is releasing it on 18th July 2017. There is a lot of film damage and it's washed out in places. The audio snaps, crackles and pops heavily, unlike the DVD. I wonder why they bothered to release it in such a condition. It doesn't look or sound restored at all. It looks like they used a worse source than the DVD and didn't clean it up.

There is only mono Russian audio and English subs. Not good for anybody who doesn't speak Russian or English. The DVD had surround tracks and a bunch of subtitles. The DVD was richer and more contrasty with deep blacks and sepia tones outside the Zone. This Region B Blu-ray has worse audio and video, fewer subtitles and audio options, and less extras. About the only clear improvement is that the print looks sharper. But it is badly scratched, dirty and messed up, so your viewing and listening enjoyment is degraded. Criterion will probably have pristine audio and video.

Incidentally, ""The Mirror"" Region B Blu-ray (also from Artificial Eye) is fantastic & blows the USA and Europe DVDs away. As for this, I wish I hadn't wasted money on it.

""Show don't tell."" This film talks and talks and talks -- and doesn't show us anything. The tension is there at moments, but the viewer is left mostly confused.

503254,3,6302719666,"I have to disagree with the praise for this film. I am well-versed in Tarkovsky and read the source novel (Roadside Picnic) this film is based on. What this film has in excess is a sense of texture, and some of it is pretty compelling -- I could almost see this film being in 3D, like Herzog's Cave of Forgotten Dreams. The cinematography and production design is incredible. But that alone cannot float a film. I found that this film was not true enough to the novel, and if it had been, it would have been better. Instead, it basically boils down to a highly textured, plodding, beyond-slow play in which three characters kind of bumble around and speak philosophically. The Zone of the film, like the in the novel -- a place of danger and fascination, alien, possibly sentient -- is beautiful at times, but not really explained like it is in the novel. I think Tarkovsky has a real talent and captured some beautiful things on film, but this film is a misstep. Its slowness is too alienating and punishing for the average viewer, and while it is a visual feast, it ultimately leaves one unsatisfied. I admire how Tarkovsky connected nuclear power and industrial pollution to the Zone, thus making the film have a very Russian signature, and you can see this film's influence on the excellent Russian film 4. And I know the production was troubled, footage was lost, and many crew members ended up sick from filming in a toxic environment. But it just comes across as too artsy, and the beyond-slow pace (some scenes are over four minutes long) I found maddening.

503305,5,6302719666,"From the outset, you will need to bracket your prejudices with the word stalker appearing as the title. Stalker has nothing to do with predatory or obsessional behaviors, i.e. stalking victims, like the movie Fatal Attraction, for example. The name here refers to smugglers, taken from the book this movie is based on. In fact, to get inside this movie at all you will have to bracket most of your expectations about what a movie is supposed to do and be about. Stalker is considered one of the top 50 movies for all time (British Film Institute) and these accolades are probably due in large part to Tarkovskys mastery of the cinematic medium.
I suspect that what I have to say about the greatness of the movie will not belong to the tenor of the general favorable criticisms of the movie. That is to say, my perspective on the movie does not focus on Tarkovskys undoubted artistic mastery. I am seeking simply to say what the movie itself says to us, about itself, in its own terms: the sparse script, the camera work, the colors, the actors, all weave seamlessly together to say something to us, something essential that needs to be heard and I will try to say it. This means that I will not be offering any external interpretation of the movies more enigmatic elements. I will stay within the text of the movie, as it were, and let it speak through its images, script, action, scenes, etc., to us.
For a moment, remove the script, which is sparse enough as it is; remove the sound and lighting effects which are used with the delicacy and precision of a Japanese tea ceremony master, and what do you see for over two hours? Its astonishing to realize that all you see is this: three middle-aged men stumbling around rather aimlessly in the bush land of a gigantic disused rubbish dump (the detritus of a bombed out or abandoned city) during which time nothing much happens! Literally! At the end of the movie even the central character bemoans the fact that the journey was a failure, that nothing has changed after all his efforts to take his companions somewhere. There are no murders, no fireworks, no breath-taking action scenes, no strange appearances of alien figures, and no buildup to a climax or resolution. I suppose we could make a tentative comparison to the style and mood of Waiting for Godot. I thought also of a certain kind of modern mens group, where men go together into the wilderness in order to find their authentic selves, the wild man within, or to rediscover the living quality of nature or animal spirits, etc. At the heart of many such forays into nature is a desire to find otherness in some form or another, some light of intelligence other than the bright light of the ego that so dominates our ordinary perceptions today. Instead, many such well-intentioned journeys into the interior end up with lasting memories of male-bonding to be sure, but little else, in terms of the stated intention of encountering a living other whose light may eclipse that of the ego and truly initiate the human being into a new reality. In other words, although there may be some thrills and spills that are well worth remembering and recounting over a beer, often nothing else much happens in terms of relativizing the light of the ego in deference to a greater light or intelligence that wants to speak.
Stalker can easily be seen this way, i.e. as a portrayal of three tired, disillusioned, middle-aged men, looking for meaning in an age of nihilisma scientist, a writer, and a self-styled group facilitatorwho manage to convince themselves that they are on a journey to encounter an alien presence called the Zone, somewhere on the forbidden outskirts of the burned out, destroyed husk of a city, in order to find its center, simply called the Room where all desires will be satisfied. Stalker even persuades the other two men to pay him for his services. And so they embark on this quixotic journey (imagine Stalker as Don Quixote and his companions as Sancho) together for two hours of my time, a day of theirs, during which nothing much happens!
Why then, was I so gripped by this movie, from start to finish, hanging on every line of speech, every gesture, every mood that came and went? Why was I not disappointed for a second, during the many moments of high tension and expectation of disaster, followed by  nothing much at all. Stalker expects some imminent and dangerous response from the alien Room whenever they make a supposed (according to Stalkers judgment only, by the way) wrong move, even though Writer or Scientist cannot see anything untoward about to happen, at any point on their quest. The expected devastating response never happens, not even once. The tension builds and then simply releases into  ordinariness. No alien presence at all! No punishment! Just a bush here, a mist there, a building, a tunnelall perfectly ordinary and explainable. Why did I not feel let down or even betrayed when Stalker, at the end, weeps with his sense of failure to guide his companions into Fulfillment?

They do not believe in anything. The ... organ with which they believe has atrophied!  nobody believes. Not only those two. Nobody! Whom should I lead in there? Oh, God ... And the most terrifying thing is ... that nobody needs it anymore. And nobody needs that Room. And all my efforts are worthless!

This movie is structured masterfully, from start to finish, by ambiguity. And it is an ambiguity that can be resolved only by destroying the very essence of the movies intent to build ambiguity and hold it in tension through the entirety of the drama. Only then, i.e. holding this ambiguity without resolution, can something true appearto us, the audiencethrough the errancy of our three protagonists. The ambiguity is written into the script this way: Stalker is a humble psychopomp.  His wife knows he is blessed as Gods Fool. He knows the Way. Like Moses he can show the way to others but cannot himself enter the Promised Land where all desires are satisfied. He describes his role in a passionate outburst when the scientist reveals his clandestine purpose to destroy the Room with a bomb:

Yes, you're right, Im a louse, I haven't done anything in this world and I cannot do anything ... And neither could I give anything to my wife! And I do not have any friends and I cannot have, but you cannot take whats mine from me! Everything is already taken from me, there, on the other side of the barbed wire. All I have is here. Can you understand! Here! In the Zone! My happiness, my freedom, my dignity  everythings here! For I lead the same [people] as me in here, unhappy ones, suffering. They... They have no other hope left! And I  I am able to! Can you understand  I am able to help them! Nobody else can help them, but I, louse (shouts), I, louse, am able to! I am ready to shed tears of happiness that I am able to help them. Thats all! And I want nothing else.

Psychopomp or delusional psychotic? Lets continue. What is the Way that Stalker knows? Keep in mind that the mood of the entire movie is one of end of days, apocalyptic, a civilization disintegrated, nihilism near its nadir. In one scene, for example, Stalker falls asleep with his companions and we hear the voice of his wife reciting what seem to be lines from Revelation, And there an immense earthquake took place, and the Sun became dark as sack cloth, and the Moon was like covered with blood ... And the stars of the heaven fell to the ground as if a fig-tree, shaken by a great wind, let its unripe figs fall down. And the sky hid itself, rolled up as a scroll; and various hills and isles moved from their places (laughs)... The Way, then, is into the heart of hopelessness.
Stalker leads his skeptical (and gullible?) companions deeper into the wasteland through an eschatological landscape dominated by the presence of water in a variety of forms (mist, rain, wastewater, pools, streams, puddles, mud, wells, etc.) He uses a variety of methods that can only be called mantic practices: He insists that they must follow a path of indirection; that the Zone is maze-like, shifting all the time, and filled with traps; that it demands respect or else it punishes. He uses his intuition to find the right path by an oracular method of hurling a metal nut tied to a ribbon ahead of them, revealing the right way. He sees signs that no one else notices. Natural events such as a wind rising, or a mist, become warnings about mistakes but, and here is the other side of the ambiguity, in spite of Stalkers dedication and conviction, nothing ever happens. At one point he cries out in alarm that Writer has taken a wrong turn and now is lost to humanity, declaring at one point, I never choose, myself, Im always afraid. You cannot imagine how terrifying it is to make a mistake... But somebody has to go first! Writer, however, turns up quite unharmed a few minutes later. All Stalkers actions are based on his conviction that the Zone is founded on an alien presence. Is Stalker on to something that no-one else notices, i.e. a true psychopomp, or is he psychotic, catching others up in his delusional system? There is simply nothing in the movie to confirm or disconfirm his perceptions of the present or future (e.g. go this way or die).
The Room is the center of the Zone and they finally arrive, according to Stalker anyway. Within an abandoned, gutted building is a doorway (threshold, according to Stalker) to a waterlogged room with a big puddle covering the floor, with its share of litter and garbage. The puddle appears as mirror-like until light rain disturbs the surface. The complete ordinariness of the scene is amazingly highlighted by an old telephone which suddenly rings. Scientist, seeing that it is working, uses the phone to call his colleagues back in the city telling them that he has the bomb and is going to use it, against their wishes, to destroy the Zone. He is doing this to prevent other people from being drawn to the Zone under false pretenses. He is completely rational about the Zone and its non-meaning. Everything we now see seems to support his and Writers skepticism. But now he begins to have doubts:

We assembled it ... with friends, with my ex ... colleagues. This place, as we can see, cannot make anybody happy. (punches in the numbers; assembling is over). If it falls into the wrong hands ... Actually, I do not know now. Then we realized ... that one shouldnt destroy the Zone. If it is ... If it even is a miracle  it is a part of nature, and it means it is a kind of hope, so to speak. They hid this bomb ... And I found it. The old building, fourth bunker. It seems there must be a rule ... one should never perform irreversible actions. I do understand, Im not a maniac (sighs), but while this ulcer here is open for every scum ... I will neither be able to sleep or to rest. On the other hand, maybe the innermost will not let it happen. Ah?

Writer is more susceptible to Stalkers persuasions but he too now has a crisis of doubt asking, ... ah... How do you know, that this miracle really exists? [To Scientist] Who told you, that dreams really come true here? Did you see anybody, who would have been made happy here? Ah, maybe Porcupine (Stalkers mentor)? And actually, who told you about the Zone, about Porcupine, about this Room? Scientist answers, He did, meaning Stalker, and Writer concludes, then I do not understand anything at all. What is the meaning to come here?
Once the two men pass through their crisis of doubt, they notice how very quiet the Room is. Is it merely quiet or have they broken through to a realm of stillness, or Silence, the realm where all desires are satisfied? Is a greater light at last penetrating and eclipsing the light of their ordinary consciousness? Or is the mystery available only to Stalker, once again, leaving his companions in their benighted ignorance? More ambiguity! They sit at the threshold and Scientist, being a scientist, cannot resist casually throwing stones into the Room and its puddle, maybe to see what happens. Nothing happens beyond ripples.
Near the beginning of the movie, Stalker warns his companions that no one ever returns the same way they came and indeed, at the end, we are not shown how they return. The scene simply opens up at the same bar where they all first met. Nothing much has changed, it seems. Stalker believes the trip was a complete failure.
Yet  in an extraordinary final scene, at Stalkers home, his daughter, thought to be a mutant cripple by others, begins to quietly exercise her mental power of telekinesis, moving glasses on a table, simply by looking at them.
Something now indeed is happening! What are we to make of this scene in the light of the entire movies structure of ambiguity, where Stalker can equally be seen as a psychopomp and a delusional psychotic? Right from the beginning we are struck with the mood of nihilism and its anxieties of an epochal loss of meaning. We also hear from Stalker that, in the end, everything has its own meaning. The movie seems to be suggesting that to make a decision about meaning (three men stumbling around in a meaningless rubbish dump, or two initiates being led to a meaningful revelation by a psychopomp) is the wrong way. The Way may be to hold and sustain the ambiguity without trying to resolve it by a decision. Stalker offers us a procedure if you like, for holding this ambiguity:

When a man is born, he is weak and supple, when he dies he is strong and callous. When a tree grows, it is tender and gentle, and when it is dry and hard, it dies. Hardness and strength are companions of death; suppleness and weakness express the freshness of living. That is why what has hardened, will not win.

We can hold this ambiguity of private, subjective meaning (Stalker) vs. public general meaninglessness (Writer and Scientist), by becoming pliable, fluidic, rather than rigid and hard in our convictions or categories of thought. Stalkers admonition is resonant with the plethora of fluidic imagery in the movie: mists, wind, mud, and water in all the variations that I mentioned above. If we can remain thus fluidic in our attitude, then something, a child, may be born out of that condition of ambiguity, something quite unexpected that, without even trying, has already surpassed what for us is an impassable barrier between spirit and matter, mind and body, literal and figurative, inner and outer interpretations, prosaic and poetic realities, etc.all hardened categories of thought easily overcome by a child.

503313,5,6302719666,"""Stalker"", based on the Strugatsky brothers novel ' Roadside Picnic', is that rare film that takes time to watch and understand the story, but it is well worth the effort. It is a surreal road trip... like 'The Wizard of Oz' crossed with an extended episode of 'The X-Files'!
Basically, this is about a 'stalker' - a guide that illegally takes people into a place called 'The Zone', where it it believed that aliens landed years ago & leaving some of their 'alien junk' behind when they left Earth for no known reason. The Zone is very dangerous and mysterious, and many that go in there do not return.
Stalker (a nickname) has an almost spiritual relationship with the Zone. It is like a holy and sacred place for him, even with all its known and hidden dangers. Much of the dialog between him and the two people he guides (Professor and Writer, also nicknames) is a big part of the enjoyment of the story, and all of the visuals and cinematography in many scenes make for some very magical and breathtaking film watching! After 2 viewings I was hooked.
I also read the book this was adapted from, and though there are differences, both are very satisfying adventures that should not be missed!

Stalker is a profound meditation on wish fulfillment and the individual's role in a society.  It rewards multiple careful viewings, and it challenges audience members to construct personalized meanings in order to make better sense of what is seen on the screen.  In this regard, Tarkovsky is one of the rare directors who respects the intelligence of his audience.

At its core, Stalker is a road-trip movie, but its road is never clearly defined, and its resolution leaves viewers with more questions than answers.

503336,4,6302719666,"Andrei Tarkovshy is known for deep and immersive film making, and Stalker is considered his greatest work. Among the sci-fi community his other film. Solaris, is the one noted most. However for me this film pulls off what it intends to much better. Stalker is all art house. A film maker's film. It ignores your average movie convention and gets your attention in a way action or comedy cannot do. As such it is a methodical film that can seem slow to the average viewer. Stalker is definitely a movie worth watching, and those with an adventurous movie spirit will be rewarded with a unique experience.

Stalker is about a mysterious area called ""The Zone"" and a small group of men traveling through it. Nobody really knows what created The Zone. Only that normal laws of nature don't apply there, and it's been cordoned off and guarded to protect the public after several disappearances. A writer and a scientist hire a Stalker (a sort of guide through The Zone) in order to get to epicenter of The Zone. At this center is The Room, which is said to grant your deepest wish when you enter it. The premise is enough to get me interested, but the journey to The Room is what this film is all about.

Tarkovshy is all about the existential discussions, and Stalker brings them up in the best fashion: by way of the travelers and their discussions and thoughts as they move further through The Zone. Each of them have their own reasons for being there, and bit by bit you learn more of their philosophies. This isn't some Godard that uses such themes to defy convention. They are pivotal to the development of the story and the characters. You won't learn everything in one conversation, but combining the whole of the dialog and get a well developed philosophical picture of each man, including the Stalker.

Dialog alone doesn't make a movie... well it can... but not this movie. Imagery is Tarkovshy's strength, and in this film he takes it to the next level. The movie starts of in a gritty black and white look. The cinematography is exceptional. In spite of how archaic the filming looks there lots of detail and contrast. It's like you aren't seeing a grainy film. Just one with so many textures it makes the film look dirty. Then when the three travelers finally get to The Zone everything changes to a color palette. Tarkovshy loves long shots with slow pans so you can really soak in every bit of the imagery. There is so much decay in the film, but he makes it look fascinating. This is evident in every scene of Stalker. You see the images less than you start to experience them. This is Tarkovshy's specialty and more so in this film than any of his others you are able to see with an artistic eye.

So The Zone defies the laws of physics and all that, but in truth you do not see any crazy effects or examples of this. Instead the director uses carefully selected locations and shoot them in such a way where the whole place feels eery and quiet... too quiet. Like something could come down on them at any time. This is the real fun of the film in that nothing necessarily happens, but you are still left wide eyed and wondering. Aside from some interesting and seamlessly done edits that kind of give you a mind bender all of the suspense is in how the actors react to the surrounds and just the wonderful presentation of the setting itself to keep you at the edge of your seat.

The film isn't perfect, even if you like slow burning stories. As awesome as the visual feast is there are issues audio-wise. It seems the movie is 100% dubbed, and while this doesn't bother me regarding the dialog all the foley effects are done to the level of ridiculousness. The foley artist the person who replaces environmental sound effects that couldn't be recorded while filming. Footsteps, water splashing, cars and other vehicle noises. All of it sounds awkward most of the time. Thank God the music does a LOT of damage control and puts you in the proper serious mood when the film demands it. Hats off to Eduard Artemev for making an inspiring minimalist score that perfectly accentuates the film.

This is a Kino release, which isn't bad. However if you were expecting Criterion level mastering you will be disappointed. I still found the visuals immensely watchable even if it's not the high level of detail I saw on Criterion's Solaris release. The DVD is a bit lanky with an interactive menu that doesn't seem to fit the movie. The film is separated into two parts just like how it was released (with intermission at the theaters). It's odd the DVD mentions the film on ""disk one and disk two"" when there is only one disc in the release. Not to fear as the whole movie is there. There are a few odd audio options, but my recommendation is to use the original mono track with subtitles. The 5.1 surround track doesn't do much more than make those annoying foley effects come out more. There is an ""English"" and ""French"" dub, but these are horrible. It's basically just announcer style voices reciting you the subtitles (which are still there) in the language you choose. Not worth the time. A few extras are on the disk as well. There are interviews by the composer, cameraman and production designer that go into Tarkovsky's level of detail in his films. Some other interesting notes about production as well. Portions of Tarkovsky's early film The Steamroller and the Violin can also be seen. Finally a short film called Memory that shows the contrast between scenes in Stalker with footage of Tarkovsky's old home when he was a child.

I definitely recommend anybody to experience this film. However I do know many aren't interested in a film almost completely devoid of any visceral content whatsoever. It is a slow movie by any standard, and has no action to speak of. Think of something a bit like 2001: A Space Odyssey and you are on the right track.

503339,5,6302719666,"A long and somewhat trying movie, Stalker requires repeated viewings and reflection before its rare beauty becomes fully evident.  Associated with the fine SF novel Roadside Picnic by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, any notion that the movie is a cinematic depiction of the book should be immediately set aside.  In the novel, the Zone was a geographical area strewn with mysterious trash left by extraterrestrials who seemingly made a pit-stop on Earth before going on to their unknown destination.  Tarkovsky's Zone, a site possibly created by a large meteor collision somewhere in Russia, is also enigmatic, rich with possibilities, and extremely dangerous.  The director makes use of the Strugatskys' concept of stalkers (treasure-hunting poachers in the novel) and a wish-fulfilling place in the Zone to create a spiritual vision that surpasses the literary work.

The film comprises one day in the life of Stalker, beginning with his early rise from bed, ending with his going to bed, and a short epilogue depicting his daughter on the next day.  Stalker makes his living guiding persons illegally through the Zone with the highpoint being a visit to the wish-fulfilling room.  The movie focuses on the journey of two men, Writer and Professor, led by Stalker.  Proper names are not used in this business.  But the pseudonyms tell us something about each man.

The director paints the shabby town in sepias and greys.  When the men hastily leave the outskirts and enter the Zone, natural color is restored to objects.  The Zone, dotted with abandoned vehicles and an empty house, is a landscape filled with lush weeds, trees, bird sounds, and a sort of unpredictable peace.  But strange rules apply:  one cannot return the way he came and one must keep moving, under supervision of the stalker.

Stalker explains that the Zone allows those to pass (without harm) who have lost all hope - an astounding reference to Dante's Inferno.  Yet this place for those without hope is really the last chance for hope.  Stalker makes painful efforts to guide the men to a moment when they can open themselves up to the Zone and believe in new possibilities for themselves.  But in fact, Writer and Professor have come to test or destroy the Zone.  A religious element pervades the journey.  There are passing references to New Testament scenes and Stalker says a quiet prayer that the men might come to believe.

After a lengthy exchange of speeches in which their souls are bared and they come to a seeming impasse as far as the wish-fulfilling is concerned, the scenery switches.  They have returned to the little bar where they first met to make plans for the journey, and we wonder what exactly happened to them.  Was the Zone purely the creation of Stalker?  Did the men leave the bar to enter the Zone?  This points to the extremely subjective character of the Zone.  It originates for each man individually - this seems to be what Stalker was so concerned for them to understand and believe.  The important thing is what each man does with it.

What makes this movie so much like the Divine Comedy is the fact that, led by a Virgil-like Stalker, the men  passed through states of Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise, as though just sightseers, as though it were purely a vision or a mental experiment.  And yet the consequences were quite real.  Stalker is a believer and struggles to continue to hope.  The others fail.

There is much more to the movie which cannot be described in this already somewhat lengthy review.  Important things are said by Stalker's nameless wife.  There are wonderfully significant details that pass before our eyes:  concerning a dog who follows them home from the Zone, and also hopeful and unforeseen abilities in their daughter Monkey.  This movie may infuriate or bore you but if you give it a chance, it will change you.

503340,5,6302719666,"Andrey Tarkovsky hit a personal and artistic high with Mirror (1974), a film now widely accepted as one of the peaks of cinema. As per usual the Soviet authorities of the time were less than impressed. They down-graded the initial release to the third category and made only 73 copies for the whole of the country. Despite being little shown audiences flocked to see it and Tarkovsky won a victory of sorts although we can imagine him gritting his teeth in private. The stressful experience of making and releasing that film made his next feature an even more daunting prospect. He really wanted to do a literature adaptation - either Dostoyevsky's The Idiot or Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan Ilyich (what would they have been like?), but as with Solaris (1972) he had to settle for science fiction - the Strugatsky Brothers' short story Roadside Picnic, a piece authorities hoped would prevent him veering off again into the religious vagaries of Andrei Roublev (1966) or into the self-indulgent navel-gazing of Mirror. Their hopes were in vain, for although Stalker (1979) may on first sight appear to be simple, it is actually the deepest, the most complex and the most challenging of all Tarkovsky's works. Furthermore, it has an underlying spirituality which is at least as conditioned by Christian faith as Andrei Roublev had been.

Making the film was in itself an article of faith for Tarkovsky. It's a long complicated story and I recommend reading Johnson and Petrie's excellent book The Films of Andrei Tarkovsky: A Visual Fugue to get the full picture, but a year's footage had to be scrapped when it was found that the Kodak film stock couldn't be developed properly. Tarkovsky had to re-shoot long sections from scratch. In addition he fell out with the original cameraman Georgi Rerberg and set designer Boym and even had to replace their replacements (Kalashnikov and Abdusalamov). The opening credits read `cinematographer: Alexander Knyazhinsky' and `set designer: Andrei Tarkovsky', but by the end it was unclear just who had done what. Furthermore, the script was reworked repeatedly to the point where the credited screenwriters (the Strugatskys) told the audience at the film's premire, ""We are not the scriptwriters, he [Tarkovsky] did it all - alone"". To round everything off Tarkovsky toiled away on his film knowing he was suffering from the cancer that would eventually kill him. An article of blind faith and a true leap into the artistic void like Boriska's bell in Andrei Roublev, it's a miracle Stalker ever got made at all. The fact that it is such a stunningly achieved pure work of art fit to stand alongside Mirror as one of the greatest statements in contemporary cinema is testament to Tarkovsky's extraordinary artistic conviction. Perhaps an artist needs to struggle to make his masterpieces, but by the time of the film's completion it was clear the director had had enough of the Soviet bureaucracy that was literally killing him. His last two films were made under pressures of a totally different nature in Italy and Sweden.

Those put off by the poetically fractured a-chronological lurches in time and space of Mirror will welcome the 'simplicity' of Stalker which consists basically of a journey from A to B. In a small unspecified country a meteorite or perhaps an alien incursion has come to earth leaving a 'Zone', a dangerous area permeated with possible radioactive fall-out and/or supernatural properties. Baffled, the authorities throw a military cordon around the perimeter and forbid anyone to enter. In the middle of this Zone is a house and in the house a 'Room' where it is said one's greatest wish is granted. People's curiosity is naturally awakened and many want to undertake the hazardous journey to the Room for self-help. The film's opening scenes introduce us to the main characters - Writer (Anatoly Solonitsyn) and Professor (Nikolai Grinko). They are neither good nor evil. They are simply wretched - men in deep need of spiritual replenishment. Stalker (Alexander Kaidanovsky) is their guide who agrees for money to take them to the Room against the wishes of his wife (Alyssa Freindlikh) who he leaves with their handicapped daughter named 'Monkey' (Natasha Abramova). The film charts their journey in linear fashion - the meeting in the bar, the tense thriller-like border-crossing in a jeep with soldiers firing on them, the long trolley-ride along train tracks, the trek through the woods and swamp of the Zone, the encounter with abandoned tanks and guns, and the negotiation of various 'traps' including a dangerous waterfall.

During this we learn about the characters. Writer is a cynical, self-loathing, embittered, misanthropic intellectual. Ostensibly he wants to regain his artistic inspiration which has been lost through years of celebrity culture-induced bingeing. Throughout the film he argues relentlessly with his spiritual opposite - Professor. Professor (or 'Scientist' as some critics call him) is a pragmatic, largely silent, but no less embittered intellectual whose dialogue conveys most of the narrative information we need to follow the film. We learn about Stalker's prison past, his family background and the story of Porcupine. Another stalker, Porcupine had come back from the Room rich beyond his wildest dreams, but having lost his brother in the process. He hanged himself a week later. This becomes very important at the end of the film when Writer pieces together the real meaning of the Room's wish-fulfillment. Professor's own motives also stay mysterious until this scene. Stalker is a strange character - nervous, sensitive, prone to hysterics, but no less intellectual than the other two. He is a cross between Chingachgook (Fenimore-Cooper's last of the Mohicans) and Jesus Christ. He has spent many years in prison for taking people into the Zone. His motives are twofold - to make money and to answer his 'spiritual calling' which consists of helping the disillusioned regain what they have lost in the normal world outside the Zone.

The first part of the film passes simply enough, but part two becomes deeply enigmatic in the scene after the waterfall where the characters rest and before they enter the 'Meatgrinder'. This sequence has been named ""Stalker's Dream"" and I will come to it later. The Meatgrinder is a terrifying long pipe tunnel through which the party has to enter the house. Writer loses the lottery and has to lead the way. In the house they move through three rooms. The first, the 'dune room', is a long cavernous enclosure with damp walls and sand dunes making up the floor. One of Tarkovsky's trademark wells sits at one end, beside which Writer delivers a long straight to camera monologue talking with intense and honest self-disgust about the meaninglessness of his life and work. Stalker attempts to assuage his feelings saying that if he really was beyond help the Meatgrinder would have killed him, but Writer rounds on him calling him 'a louse' for tricking him in the lottery and making him go first all the time. The second room, the 'telephone room', sees the argument cut off by the telephone ringing. A wrong number, but Professor takes the chance to phone his laboratory. In the conversation he reveals his motive for coming to the Room. He has brought a bomb and plans to destroy that which can't be understood so that those would-be tyrants and despots can't gain access to a place where their evil dreams can be granted. The three step down into the third and final room. Many commentators have said this is the Room of their dreams, but I think it's important to state clearly that none of the characters actually enter the Room. The room where they finish up is simply the 'threshold' of the Room. They all look into the Room which is off-camera right as Stalker announces where they are, but they don't actually enter it. Stalker can't enter as a rule of his profession while both Writer and Professor bottle out. As Tarkovsky describes it in Sculpting in Time, ""They had summoned the strength to look into themselves - and had been horrified; but in the end they lack the spiritual courage to believe in themselves"". Writer guesses the reason Porcupine killed himself was that the Room had granted his 'inner-most' wish (to get rich), not the wish he had consciously made (to save his brother). It was Porcupine's consequent guilt-soaked anguish that led him to suicide. Writer is fully aware of his failings as a human being and can't believe in himself enough to cross the threshold. Professor also backs down. He has the power to blow up everything, but he too lacks the courage to follow through his scientific reasoning to the ultimate end. The only thing to enter the Room is Tarkovsky's camera (taking us with it). The most famous shot of the film is a long slow zoom away from the three characters huddled together on the floor of the threshold as the telephone spookily starts to ring again. Professor dismantles his bomb and throws away the various parts while Writer puts his arm protectively around Stalker's shoulders. As the camera slowly zooms away the Room is revealed to us. It has a tiled floor which is submerged under a large pool of stagnant water in which detritus of humanity floats eerily. A long shot accompanies Stalker as he talks about bringing his family to live in the Zone. This is answered as if by a higher power with a thunder clap and a shower of the most magical indoor rain you can ever hope to imagine. The rain lessens then stops altogether as the three continue to sit staring across the pool directly at the camera - directly at us. Forgive me for going into so much detail, but much of Stalker has been mis-described (and misinterpreted) by many commentators and I want to use this space partly to make things clear. Detail matters here even more than usual in Tarkovsky. Following Professor throwing away a part of his bomb into the pool we cut to an overhead shot of that part in the water and as Ravel's Bolero plays accompanied by train movement on the soundtrack we see a sickly fish swimming next to the bomb part as black sludge gradually fills the frame. The fish is a universally acknowledged symbol for God and the connection here is surely obvious - decadent `developed' society (the Ravel) producing the bomb and crushing all spiritual belief in the process.

And yet all is not lost. We are taken back to the bar from which the film's central journey started and are given a series of ambiguous scenes and images which suggest that though the journey appears to have been an abject failure, perhaps it was successful after all. Professor returns from the Zone NOT having destroyed it as he had set out to do. Writer looks wistfully, longingly even, at the family harmony Stalker enjoys now completed with the addition of a dog, always a sign of humanity at its kindest for Tarkovsky (Writer confesses to having five dogs of his own!). Stalker and his family leave the bar, his daughter at first seeming to have learned how to walk until the frame widens and we see her riding her father's shoulders. They walk beside a filthy polluted lake with a nuclear power plant in the background belching out effluent, but in color this time, not the b/w of the beginning of the film. Stalker returns home exhausted and complaining bitterly about the pseudo-intellectuals he has to take into the Zone, the frame widening again to show his apartment wall filled from floor to ceiling with books and suggesting him to be as intellectual as his clients. As his wife puts him to bed he rejects her offer to come to the Zone with him - what happens if her deepest wish isn't granted? Like Writer and Professor he too lacks self-belief. And yet, the film ends with two of the most stunningly achieved affirmative scenes in the whole of cinema. The first (in b/w) has Stalker's wife confessing straight to camera her love for her husband - how she married him against the advice of her family knowing that any child would likely be handicapped because of the effect the Zone has had on the father. As she puts it, a hard marriage is better than the absolute emptiness of what she had before. Humans ultimately need each other and she wouldn't have her situation any other way. Coming after almost three hours of corrosive spiritual doubt and desperate soul-searching this statement of pure love is incredibly moving. The second scene (in color) has Monkey sitting at a table reciting a love poem by Fyodor Tyuchev from heart in her mind as mysterious fluff flies through the air. In a Tarkovsky film this fluff is always the sign of something miraculous about to happen. The camera slowly zooms back to reveal the table with three glasses on it. Through telekinesis she moves each one by turn with her mind as a dog whimpers on the soundtrack. A glass with some dark liquid in it is moved to the edge of the table left at the bottom of the frame. A glass with a broken egg shell and other unidentified stuff is moved about halfway down the table right. Then a tall empty glass which once had milk in it is moved to the edge center of frame so that it falls off. We hear it bounce but not break. Monkey lays her head on the table as she moves this final glass. As the glass drops so the room begins to rattle as a train passes by with Beethoven's (Schiller's) `Ode to Joy' playing fragmentally in the background. Tarkovsky zooms back in on the girl's head and as the train finally passes and the room stops trembling the shot fades to darkness and the film finishes. This scene has been interpreted in many ways, but one can't deny the `miracle' we are given here. Two declarations of love (by Stalker's wife and then in the poem) followed by a miracle delivered by a child as an 'ode to joy' underlines the hope (the redemption) burning through spiritual belief which may yet rejuvenate the cold, empty, spiritually bankrupt and polluted world.

The film's 'simple' journey has invited many people to interpret it as an allegory on one thing or another - an ecological parable? A dissident anti-Soviet tract? Another slice of Solaris-style science v aesthetics metaphysical speculation? To get the truth we had better turn to Tarkovsky in Sculpting in Time. He says: ""People have asked me what the Zone is, and what it symbolizes, and have put forward wild conjectures on the subject. I'm reduced to a state of fury and despair by such questions. The Zone doesn't symbolize anything, any more than anything else does in my films: the zone is a zone, it's life, and as he makes his way across it a man may break down or he may come through. Whether he comes through or not depends on his own self-respect, and his capacity to distinguish between what matters and what is merely passing"". So the Zone is actually life itself, which means it is the same as what lies outside the Zone. What makes it different is the increased likelihood that in the Zone one might find ""self-respect"" and ""love"", the two most important things that constitute one's meaning of life. To find these things one must ""believe in oneself"" and take a leap of blind faith. That is the meaning of the journey the protagonists take. Whether they have the guts to enter the Room or not, the fact that they still believe that life can be redeemed has been shown by their willingness to undertake the journey for the right reasons and at least to ask the right questions even if answers remains forever elusive.

Key to me is that both Writer and Professor journey across the Zone in search of ""self-respect"", ""love"" or for some spiritual meaning which makes life worth living, and yet it's only on their return when they encounter Stalker's wife and observe married loving harmony that they actually see the answer to their prayers. Tarkovsky says: ""In Stalker I made some sort of complete statement: namely that human love is - miraculously - proof against the blunt assertion that there is no hope in the world. This is our common, and incontrovertibly positive possession. Although we no longer know how to love..."" And he goes even further than that: ""Her [Stalker's wife's] love and her devotion are the final miracle which can be set against the unbelief, cynicism, moral vacuum poisoning the modern world, of which both Writer and Professor are victims"". In the film Professor journeys across the Zone to destroy the Room, but ends up saving it. He comes back redeemed and perhaps ready to love - he senses that the Zone is as much a part of nature as everything else and shouldn't be tampered with and in the bar he witnesses the existence of pure love in front of his very eyes. He sees the very necessity of learning ""how to love"". Similarly Writer crossed the Zone mouthing every bitter and disenchanted feeling he has about the nature of humanity (in language similarly to that adopted by Tarkovsky himself in Sculpting in Time), but comes back thoughtful and perhaps ready to live again, his spirit also having been redeemed. Put another way both Professor and Writer end the film without their conscious ""deepest wishes"" having been granted. This is mainly because they did not really know what they wanted to wish for in the first place. But their deepest ""inner-most"" wish is granted nevertheless - the wish for Faith. In that sense their journey is a resounding success. Tarkovsky: ""In this film I wanted to mark out that essentially human thing that cannot be dissolved or broken down, that forms like a crystal in the soul of each of us and constitutes our worth. And even though outwardly their journey seems to end in fiasco, in fact each of the protagonists acquires something of inestimable value: FAITH. He becomes aware in himself of what is most important of all; and that most important thing is alive in every person"".

Stalker then is a film that goes much deeper than everyday allegory. The complexity is most clearly stated in the sequence often referred to as ""Stalker's Dream"". This scene is the key to the film and presents obliquely Tarkovsky's real agenda. The group are resting having just escaped the trap of the waterfall. Up until this point the film has been strictly linear - as if ""the whole film had been made of a single shot"" observing the classical Aristotelian principle of unity between action, location and time. Suddenly the characters lay on the ground in different poses. Rapid cutting reveals them all in different poses in quick succession. This is strikingly unnatural. Writer lies down virtually in stagnant water and continues his goading of the Professor's scientific specificity with words which could have come straight out of Sculpting in Time: ""A man writes because he's tormented, because he doubts. He needs to constantly prove himself and the others that he's worth something - And if I know for sure that I'm a genius? Why write then? What the hell for?"" Professor insults him. Writer continues: ""[scientific nonsense is] only designed in order to work less and eat more. They [the tools of science] are all just crutches, artificial limbs. And mankind exists in order to create works of art. Unlike all other human activities this one is unselfish."" Professor indicates his disgust and on the soundtrack we hear water dripping in an echoed way typical of Tarkovsky, but also which indicates that aurally we are in the Room - another indication that the Room is more state of mind than actual place. Tarkovsky's camera pans over the tiled floor and pool which we will later discover is inside the Room. We see the detritus of humanity represented by things man uses to make life bearable but which have proved useless(a syringe, a bowl, a glass dish with goldfish - God? - a metal box containing coins, an old pistol, a coiled spring, paper, an old calendar, a fragment of Jan van Eyck's Ghent altarpiece with coins lying beside it, a clockwork mechanism). A woman's voice (probably Stalker's wife) reads on the soundtrack from Revelations (Rev. 6: 12-17) about the opening of the Sixth Seal, the destruction of Heaven and Earth, and the vain attempts of the survivors to hide themselves from ""the wrath of the lamb"". Clearly the arguments of man between science and reason have led to all this waste and the death of spirituality in mankind. But immediately after this shot we cut to a dog looking at Stalker who perhaps 'inspires' him to offer the way out through a recitation from Luke (24: 13-18) which tells of the two disciples on their way to Emmaus who encounter the resurrected Jesus Christ, but fail to recognize him. The camera starts with Professor's sleeping face and pans down to Writer's head. He is lying with his head on Professor's side. Writer is also sleeping. As Stalker recites ""But their eyes were holden that they should not know him"", Writer's eyes open. This suggests immediately the Writer's capacity for redemption. The camera returns to Professor's face, his eyes also at last open to suggest that though he has the capacity to see, he does not yet use it. The scene finishes on Stalker lecturing the pair of them, both looking back at him as if their whole lives depend on his words. Stalker returns to the unselfishness of artistic creation, but uses music to point out how something created can move us in inexplicable ways without needing to be rationalized. All we need is to open our emotions and all of us have the innate capacity to be moved by the sublime - ""After all everything has sense and reason"" Stalker says, but it needn't be necessary to rationalize it. To be happy we need simply to have the faith to believe that it is there.

I have not left enough space to deal sufficiently with the film's marvelous acting and the extraordinary mise-en-scne. As in Mirror Tarkovsky conjurs up a visual palette which shimmers from color to b/w through sepia and beyond. At first it seems life outside the Zone is b/w (actually sepia in a good 35mm print) while life inside is color, but things are more complicated than that with b/w scenes inserted inside the Zone and two sequences at the end (including the closing miracle) in radiant color. Life outside the Zone is dominated by a nuclear power plant that looms over everything - Stalker's home and the bar, both of which are damp, eerie enclosures seemingly about to be reclaimed by nature. Similarly the Zone may at first seem 'natural', but it is polluted by the remnants of mankind which it is in the process of re-claiming. The closer we get to the Room, the grimmer things get, especially the Meatgrinder and the rooms in the house. Most striking is the use of water. It is absolutely everywhere. Tarkovsky's use of it contrasts markedly with the way it is used in Mirror. In that film water is connected through memory and dream to the Mother figure and carries overwhelmingly positive associations - cleansing, rebirth, rejuvenation, purification. In Stalker the connections are diametrically opposite. Almost all liquids are deadly or at least polluted from Writer's alcohol through to the dangerous waterfall. Stagnant polluted water seems to pervade everything with a rotting corrosive stench which seems to exteriorize the inner turmoil of these wretched people passing through it. The eerie acoustic dripping of water in the Room pervades much of the film. The only positive liquids we see are the inside rain that seems to offer hope and the milk offered to the dog which follows them out of the Zone and which also filled the glass before it was moved off the table by Monkey in the film's final epiphany.

Finally, there's the music. Tarkovsky wanted a sound which mixed the traditions of both East and West and Eduard Artemyev came up with an extraordinarily haunting score which accompanies our trek. Announced in the opening credits it returns to accompany the celebrated long trolley sequence which takes the pilgrims from the railway depot into the Zone. The electronic clanging matches the regular clanging of the car over rails - the deeper into the Zone the heavier becomes the electronic dissonance as the camera focuses on the backs of the pilgrims' pensive heads as they wait in trepidation. The music invests much of the film with an oneiric other-worldly quality. Then there are the snatches of real classical music used to accompany a train passing Stalker's home. The music appears to come and go from inside the train as it passes. The music used is (in order) the Marseillaise, Wagner's Tannhuser overture (not Die Meistersinger as Johnson and Petrie say), Ravel's Bolero and then Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 - the 'Ode to Joy'. These choices certainly are not arbitrary. The Tannhuser is easy to explain, connecting as it does Stalker's departure into the Zone leaving his wife writhing in agony on the floor with Tannhuser's pilgrimage to Rome to seek absolution again with his partner (Elizabeth) left behind. This gives the Stalker's character motivation a religious twist from the beginning. Ravel's Bolero I'd say is chosen because it conveys the 'decadence' of a western culture which has veered away from its spiritual essence. The Marseillaise and the Ode to Joy are also connected with this decadence starting as it did with the Enlightenment and the ideals born out of the French Revolution. These were fundamental causes of a move away from love of God towards love of man and the consequent ever-widening estrangement of man from his spiritual essence. To this extent perhaps Tarkovsky does offer a political critique of the state of humanity in his film. However, it is as a spiritual journey towards a recovery of man's essence through love and faith that the film should really be understood.

It should be obvious by now that Stalker is a very special film for me. It is one of the greatest films out there with scenes of unrivalled power even in other Tarkovsky. If I prefer Mirror it is purely subjective taste on my part. This Artificial Eye release is excellent in almost every respect. The visuals (aspect ratio 4:3) and sound are clear and as truthful as a DVD can relate them. It is presented on 2 DVDs which isn't a problem. Tarkovsky knew the film would be shown in 2 parts and the break is not disruptive. To enhance this set's attractions even further there are many fascinating extras including interviews with the crew and an extract from Tarkovsky's graduate film The Steamroller and the Violin. The only slight quibble I have is the quality of the subtitles. I can't speak Russian but I sense a lot has been 'lost in translation'. Never mind, this film must be seen.",1414627200,9,26545,4.820355341083571

503367,5,6302719666,"If 'More of an experience than a movie' applied to any one film, Stalker is probably it. It doesn't really conform to any of the set standards for cinema. The average shot length is over a minute (whereas nowadays it's around 4 seconds). The film has a premise, but no real plot, story, or narrative. It certainly lacks a happy ending, or a digestible ending for that matter. Stalker could best be described as a cross between Dostoevsky's philosophy and Ingmar Bergman's visuals. Thankfully, it's the best and most entrancing of each world. The film's three primary characters, the stalker, the writer, and the professor, interact and contrast in such an abstract yet understandable way, holding in their musings Stalker's complete human appeal. Their journey into 'the zone' makes for an excellent primer and acts as a metaphorical journey into their truest human thoughts and feelings. The film is remarkable as a rumination of human suffering, but even more incredible as a visual and sonic work of art. Moving from a sepia-toned wasteland to an earthy, mystical setting (very much in a Wizard of Oz fashion), Stalker is always off-putting and haunting in the most artistic and rewarding way. Tarkovsky's long and seamless takes lend a real-time quality to the meditation of both picture and sound. The soundtrack by Eduard Artemyev is debatably just as important as Tarkovsky's visuals. This is true in that the film would be drastically altered if either aspect was tampered with. The natural sounds and the soundtrack are so fused that the viewer often loses track of what is real and what is synthetic, adding immensely to the film's transcendental quality. The work from the three main characters and the stalker's wife cannot be understated. Without their realistic and contemplative performances, Stalker might be nothing but pretty pictures and sounds. So much more can be said about the film, but a loss of words seems like a response Tarkovsky was trying to elicit.

This is either dystopian or just marooned banter in the lives of very worried people. The film gave me an almost 1984'ish vibe. The film is largely about the ides of life and society and a major part of it takes place in the form of CONVERSATIONS between the three. The professor, the writer and the stalker.

I didn't like that it is made in a very ambiguous morose style. Yes, I understand the intention of the director of a poor wet sodden world and slow moving cameras over objects destroyed by water. I am not even lost in translation but by the end of 2/3rds of the film i couldn't help but want it to finish already. It is long and it is slow as burden, I feel a film can be slow but it shouldn't make the viewer think it is slow.

The Stalker is one of those slow films which you either love or you hate. I regret watching it and the high ranking is the reason I messed with it in the first place.

What I found was a confusing long drawn out dialog between three under achievers who seek the meaning of something? Their own ineptness. But somehow the film didn't muster enough confidence and even halfway through the film the characters seemed vague and as complete strangers to me.

I wish the film was explained better, I wish I knew the language it was made in, perhaps then I would look at it differently, there is way too much dialogue and I wish there was a monologue to events. 8 years before the Stalker Kubrick did A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and yet THE STALKER seems way older and entirely helpless in comparison.

But these are exactly people who would benefit big time from watching the grass grow, as well as watching the ice move, paint dry etc..

503442,5,6302719666,"The one essential characteristic of any effective work of art, let alone a true work of genius, is its ability to reflect the viewer's consciousness.  True art is never fixed, never stationary, never inert: it shifts and changes slightly in the exact measure as has the consciousness of he or she who experiences it since the last time it was encountered.  That Tarkovsky's Stalker is a work of genius is indisputable as far as I'm concerned.  If you are planning to watch it, however (and I could not encourage you more strongly to do so), there is one caveat: don't approach it expecting to see an action thriller, or anything approaching typical Hollywood fare, otherwise you will be highly confused & sorely disappointed.

In its way, it has its own very powerful moments of action and suspense, but like all of Tarkovsky's work, and this one in particular, it needs to be approached with a sort of open-minded, contemplative attitude, otherwise it will glance off your consciousness like a stone skipping across a pond, leaving behind a similarly irritated & incoherent aftermath.  If, however, you approach it in the right state of mind (which is to allow yourself to be quiet & patient enough to allow IT to determine your state of mind; again, like all of Tarkovsky's work, the cinematography and mise en scene is deliberately intended to evoke a certain, definitely altered state of consciousness in the viewer), then you will find an endlessly rewarding experience in feeling the weight of its  sheer beauty and noetic ineffability plummet and swirl into the deepest levels of your psyche.  This movie is, in my opinion, one of the greatest works, not just of film, but of art, period.

Also, the two bonus interviews at the end of Disc 2 with the cinematographer and set designer are both surprisingly good.  Both of these guys were clearly deeply affected by Tarkovsky as a person and by working with him on this film in general.  The set designer (who lived with Tarkovsky & his family for two years while the film was being made) also has some very interesting behind-the-scenes things to say about the making of the film itself.",1369526400,5,2143,4.814713896457766

503444,3,6302719666,"This Kino release of Stalker has two discs -- one with the film, the other with extras.  Navigation on the first disc is poorly designed, so you have to dig into the audio setup to find out that there are actually two versions of the soundtrack.  The default is _not_ Tarkovsky's soundtrack; it's a 5.1 dolby soundtrack which altered and added sound, including a music track that isn't particularly good and seriously changes how Tarkovsky clearly intended the film to be experienced (for example, by adding music where  Tarkovsky had none). There is a very long, intensely meditative sequence to which music is added. You might as well colorize Citizen Kane.

Visually, the transfer is okay, but could be better. For the price at the time of this writing (about US$17), it's fine.

The film itself is a masterpiece, though people accustomed to contemporary film styles will find Tarkovsky ""boring"" -- no jolting soundtrack, no rapid-fire cutting. Instead, some of the slowest, most prolonged camera moves and cuts you'll see in film. Gorgeous if you like it (which, clearly, I do).",1365206400,44,1082,4.955801104972376
503445,5,6302719666,"Just kidding. I found this movie because the PC game STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl is easily the most immersive game I've ever played. It's a beautiful game, and the story is so bizarrely intriguing. I obviously knew the movie had nothing to do with the game (the game being mostly based off the book ""Roadside Picnic"" from what I understand), but they both share a few similarities; The Zone, the STALKERs themselves, the anomalies, and the mythical room where your heart's desire is fulfilled.

Anyway, I can totally understand why a lot of people wouldn't like this movie. It's slow, nothing really happens, there's no special effects, etc. Actually, I really liked that there were no special effects, the director manages to create a sense of dread based purely upon how the characters behave and what the viewer is imagining. I was really tensed up during quite a few parts, only to realize after the movie was over that you never actually see anything! Very cool, and it takes an extremely talented director and actors to pull that off.

I loved the movie though. Sure, it's just 3 Russian guys talking philosophy for 2.5 hours, but the backdrop of The Zone and the mystery of the room keeps it from ever getting boring. You definitely have to be in the mood for it though, and watch it when you can pay absolute attention to what's being said.

503447,5,6302719666,"Stalker by Tarkovsky is his 2nd incursion into SF following Solaris. There the inability to communicate with the alien force which had drastic effects upon the astronauts' subconscious was transfiguring. Here following the crash of a meteorite or alien craft 20 years before,the landscape has been altered so that the Zone doesn't obey the physical laws of the Earth,matter is warped in mysterious and dangerous ways. The Stalker is the guide of people wishing to enter the Zone,surrounded as it is by soldiers and barbed wire. The mysterious foreign entity left behind industrial debris in this bleak and devastated forbidden landscape,where people are supposed to disappear. Stalkers are adventurous individuals who, for a proper payment, lead people to the Zone and to the mysterious Room at the heart of the Zone where your deepest wishes are allegedly granted. The film tells the story of one such Stalker, an ordinary man with a wife and a crippled daughter with the magic capacity of moving objects, who takes to the Zone two intellectuals, a Writer and a Scientist. When they finally reach the Room, they fail to pronounce their wishes because of their lack of faith, while Stalker himself seems to receive an answer to his wish that his daughter would get better.

The journey is hazardous and Stalker is one of the few able to navigate. The subconscious sets up its own barriers and blocks to going straight to the Room. Tarkovsky has emptied the source novel,Roadside Picnic,of the abandoned technology of advanced aliens in the context of a fascistic state(the aliens,indifferent to the Earth,have left behind 7 Zones on the planet).He has placed into the centre of his film Man's spiritual quest,Man's dreams and desires. The film is a journey through the traps and pitfalls of the Zone. The Writer(Solinitsyn)searches for inspiration,the Scientist(Grinko) searches for truth. The Stalker has been trained by a renowned stalker named Porcupine, who, after an excursion with his brother into The Zone, returned alone and infinitely wealthy, only to commit suicide a week later. Soon, it is evident that reaching The Zone is not their greatest impediment, but the uncertainty over their deepest wish. As the men approach the threshold to The Room, their fear and trepidation for the materialization of their answered prayers leads to profound revelation and self-discovery.

This film is a masterpiece. The language of the Zone is the language of life. Tarkovsky uses chromatic shifts to delineate between the outside world and the Zone,physical reality from the subconscious. He utilises breath-taking long takes,mesmerising images and sounds, moments of surprise like the dog that crosses their path or the birds that fly up over the sand-dunes in the antechamber,the shaking ground. As Tarkovsky said,if you held a shot""a new quality emerges,a special intensity of attention.""There was a lot of heart-break in the making of this film,the first year's filming went to waste as the film-stock was not developed and another film was reshot in another country. Chemical pollution upsteam led to early deaths for Tarkovsky and his wife and a leading actor. The film is full of pulsating rhythm,dialogues and monologues of the travellers. It evokes the disasters of Chernobyl and Japan with forbidden zones. It contains the essence of great film-making,meditations on the soul,breathing in a much larger world,containing many subjects in one.",1359417600,3,3450,5.2481884057971016

503450,5,6302719666,"It'd been many years since I had seen Stalker, Andrei Tarkovsky's excellent science fiction film, and I watched it last night. For a science fiction movie, Stalker is certainly an oddity. Released in 1979, loosely based on the short novel Roadside Picnic by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, and directed by Tarkovsky, the masterful Russian director who lived too short a life, it tells the tale of a part of Russia that has been visited by an odd event. It may have been a meteorite that fell, or it may have been an alien visitation. But the event created the Zone, a dangerous area which was cordoned off by the police, and where few could go.

A Stalker - a sort of guide who takes people through the traps in the Zone - meets up with two men who want to visit the Room, a place where wishes come true. One is a Professor, a man of reason, and the other a writer, a man of inspiration. The Stalker is a man of belief. Very little happens in the movie, which lasts more than 2 1/2 hours, except for their trip to the Room, and their discovery of what they want from it.

Stalker is science fiction only in its premise; there are no aliens, no magic, nothing that would be noticed as science fiction. It is a slow movie; very little happens, and some of the shots are several minutes long. It's a science fiction movie as it would have been written by Samuel Beckett. Yet it's a brilliant existential examination of the desires of men and women.

At first, the film begins in sepia-toned black-and-white, but once the three characters reach the Zone, the film changes to color. Just as Oz was in color, so was the Zone. The Zone is located outside an industrialized city, and is full of the detritus of modernity. Yet Tarkovsky films these banal, cast-off items with the plastic beauty that he showed in all his films. Some of the shots are breathtakingly haunting, yet there is nothing special in them.

In a prescient shot, near the end of the movie, the Stalker can be seen returning to his home with his wife and daughter, and, across the river, a nuclear power plant is seen. The Zone could be the area surrounding Chernobyl. There is no devastation, simply signs of nature taking over some human artefacts.

According to an interview with the production designer, the film took two years to shoot. The first year's footage was lost, apparently because it was an experimental film stock that couldn't be developed. (Though that suggests that it was only sent for development after the entire film was shot, which seems at odds with the way movies were created at the time.) Tarkovsky then started over, reshooting the entire movie, over another year.

The DVD is decently produced, though the English subtitles are a bit clunky. It contains the original mono soundtrack, and also a recent 5.1 mix, which, in my opinion, ruins the movie. It is merely the mono soundtrack with added environmental sounds, trying to create ""atmosphere,"" yet Tarkovsky used a lot of silence in this film, and the surround mix is never quiet.

I first saw Stalker in the early 1980s at a retrospective of movies by Wim Wenders in New York. Wenders had made a selection of films to be shown with his movies, and, preceding his Kings of the Road (In the Course of Time), was Stalker and John Ford's The Searchers. All three of these movies are quests, searches for people or ideas, and the very long program that day (more than 7 hours) was an extraordinary example of three different approaches to the quest movie. Since then, it has been one of my favorite films. It's an odd movie, more like a Beckett play than science fiction, yet it is unforgettable.

If you've never seen Stalker, you should by all means watch it. It is a truly unforgettable movie by one of the great directors of the 20th century. His life and career were too short, but his films are all masterpieces.",1347062400,4,3856,4.570188133140376
503500,5,6302719666,"Watch out -- big spoilers here.

""Stalker"" is the story of a man guiding  two others (a Writer and a Scientist) through The Zone (a cordoned off and abandoned wilderness) to The Room where they will achieve their ""heart's desire"".  During the journey we're given the obligatory and angst ridden insights into each man's character and learn that, while the Stalker can get them to the room, he is himself forbidden entry.  We also learn of a previous visitor (called Porcupine) who returned from the room to fabulous wealth and then killed himself.

""Stalker"" has been hailed by many as a masterpiece.  But ""Stalker"" is long and slow (163 minutes), and lots of people (who seem to be anticipating some kind of ""Citizen Kane"" thing) have trouble with this, get upset, and write reviews about ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", etc..

Which is fine, because the joke is on them.  ""Stalker"" is one of those movies that either you get, or it gets you.

It is, of course, an allegory.  The Writer and Scientist are obviously symbols for the right and left brain, and The Stalker is obviously a Film Director (Artist).  The Journey is the work itself, and the Room is the mirror that great Art is: to enter is to risk discovering something new about yourself.  This is why Porcupine committed suicide: when he discovered his heart's desire he couldn't face it.

Eventually the Stalker gets Writer and Scientist to the threshold of the room, but the journey has shown them enough about themselves to give them second thoughts -- they are petty, vengeful, shallow, narcissistic, insecure -- and on the verge of achieving their ""heart's desire"", they refuse to go in.

Back home they go their separate ways, the Stalker returning to his miserable home, long-suffering wife, and crippled child.  He is despairing: he won't go back there, can't make the journey again. It's a waste of time.  But while he sleeps his wife tells us otherwise.

Tarkovsky's science fiction films are probably his most autobiographical: ""Solaris"" (his relationship with his father), ""Stalker"" (his wife), and ""The Sacrifice"" (his son).  Depending on your mood, they can all be a hard slog,  but it is ""Stalker"" that is probably the most gut-wrenchingly personal: it describes the agony, effort and despair that confronts any artist trying to make something of value.  And the humiliation when it is wasted on fools.

""Stalker"" is a film about Art, The Audience and The Artist that is so masterfully constructed it traps the Audience inside the idea that is the film: a work of Art about the Artist amd his Audience; a complete statement about the relationship between Director and Audience: if you are watching this film, then this film is about you.  It's a gag worthy of the Coen Brothers (maybe even the Marx Brothers in ""Go West"").  Once the film begins, you are there: you *are* on the journey (literally and metaphorically).  You *are* taken to the room (literally and metaphorically).

An artist trying to see their own work is like a magician trying to be surprised by his own tricks.  Whatever the original inspiration might've been, in the end it's reduced to process -- the journey.  Like the Stalker, this was Tarkovksy's lot in life -- no magic, just a long and arduous journey to a place that someone else will get to enjoy.  But if you've ever made art, you will recognize the path, and sometimes that's enough.

For everyone else, love it or hate it, ""Stalker"" -- the movie -- *is* the room.  You looked into the mirror, and you didn't even know it.

503505,5,6302719666,"Is it four stars or five?  Well if you put it right back in and watch it again, I guess it's five.  First off, Stalker is beautiful.  The opening titles just get in the way of the not-quite black-and-white Tarkovsky achieved by filming in color and processing in black and white.  It's my first Tarkovsky and I'm already doing research!
You immediately know that you are in the presence of something great, a Kurosawa, a Besson, an unTarantino.  That Stalker could get made in 1979 in the Soviet Union is incredible, especially considering some of the quotes and allusions.
Oh it's slow and boring, some have complained.  Two minutes of a dude walking across a field; two minutes of the same dude walking back.  Nothing happening.  Not true, there is always something happening in a Tarkovsky shot, you just gotta look for it.  The foreground is shimmering, the background is shimmering, the guy lying motionless in the grass has a leech crawling across his hand and so on.
Stalker is also one of the wettest movies you'll ever see, drip drip dripping like Zed and Two Noughts, The Faculty, or even Das Boot.
The director imbues ordinary scenery and locations with such dread and foreboding that you too fear every step, but feel compelled to go on.  How does he do it without the cellos and the splatter and other hackneyed devices that are currently used to portray suspense?  There is a subtle sense of humor too.  A conversation ensues between the three characters and the camera pans back and forth between them in a conventional way.  The three march off and the camera remains, it was really taking no one's perspective, it was some fourth other, maybe The Zone itself watching them!
Don't turn the sound down for the famous rail transit into the Zone (some claim the scene was intended to be silent) Turn It Up! way up, and enjoy the Persian tar and Tarkovsky at his best.
The ending?  Well enigmatic about covers it, but maybe it's like the couple of slow spots in the film, you just need to view it more.  Besides, anything vaguely M. Night Shyamalan-ish would have been a travesty.  Perhaps the answer is in 'Roadside Picnic' the book Stalker was based on, but I doubt it could be that simple.",1334188800,3,2204,4.641752577319588
503506,5,6302719666,"Tarkovsky's water imagery has captured the imagination of many reviewers, and of course, he denies any special meaning to it.

Be that as it may, water, like all basic elements of life, is ultimately both a solvent and at the same time a catalyst for growth. It is just like eternity, and Tarkovsky's vision of life is very ""dharmic"" which is to say difficult to find a beginning or end in the traditional western sense of these words. Life and death ebb and flow with only an occasional glimpse of what we could call ""grace,"" that is, a transcendent vision.

The ultimate idea of Stalker and most of the other films by this director is the vanity of worldly power in the face of the ultimate question, i.e. death.

The intellectuals are baffled by the zone, yet the physically and mentally challenged son of the stalker at the end transcends the limits of the known laws of the universe.

There is often an extreme strength in the thing that appears to be the weakest. This takes us back to the water symbolism and I don't know if Tarkovsky read ""Tao Te Ching"" but this ancient quote seems appropriate, imo:

""The best of man is like water,
Which benefits all things, and does not contend with them,
Which flows in places that others disdain,
Where it is in harmony with the Way.""

The water symbols of Tarkovsky goes hand in hand with his recurrent theme of the child-as-hero. The soft and silly being who overcomes the rigid and brutal and who shows us a new path.",1330992000,2,1467,4.516981132075472
503507,5,6302719666,"Have you ever been so entranced by a work of art that you can hardly stop gazing at it?  I remember the first time this happened to me was when I was very young and saw an image of Picasso's _Guernica_ in a second-grade textbook.  I didn't want to turn the page; I just kept looking, taking it all in.  Even though I couldn't have expressed myself in words, I felt a deep emotional response, an appreciation for his work that required my total involvement with the image.

Every single frame in _Stalker_ is so carefully and cleverly composed that it elicits such a response.  Sometimes we hardly know what we are looking at, we can't understand it, but what we are seeing is absorbing, often dreamlike.  Tarkovsky has a reverence for his work that is seldom found in film-making, eschewing the sensational and embracing the heartfelt, so that even a blade of grass or a drop of water seems to possess a significance in his world, and even the supernatural can seem very natural.  But, of course a mysterious alien presence could create the Zone.  But, of course you can't go back the way you came (nobody does).  But, of course a room can grant your deepest wish.  But, of course a bandage tied to a nut can guide your way.  After even a single viewing, the viewer recalls scenes from _Stalker_ in much the same way that one remembers sequences from a dream.  Tarkovsky involves the viewer to the point that his world becomes a part of our world in the same way that our sleeping world becomes a part of our waking life.  And isn't this the sign of a great artist: that his work follows us?

Tarkovsky was the kind of artist that later film-makers like Tarantino and Luhrmann rebelled against.  His work is scene-driven and character-driven, not action-driven, and it requires a thoughtful involvement on the part of the viewer.  Just as only certain people can be led into the Zone, it is sad to think that many viewers today may not have the patience required to appreciate such a film.

Even the ""ugly"" scenes are riveting to look at, and the lush greenery of the Zone, interspersed with rusting vehicles and crumbling buildings, is so real I often felt I had to brush the dew off of me while watching. The theme is definitely worthy of Tarkovsky, and like his other films, would require a moderately-sized paragraph in itself to even state what it is.

There are numerous ""stand alone"" scenes which show flashes of Tarkovsky's usual standard of brilliance (the initial scene in the bar where the characters get aquainted with each other, the running of the blockade around the Zone, the Stalker's despair over the lack of Faith in his companions, and one or two others... but (and this is a HUGE ""but"")...

The movie just never manages to make any of it come together. Far too often, we listen to the Stalker referencing ""terrible things"" that will happen to them if they deviate from the path, but we never actually see anything even remotely terrifying. This violates Chekhov's First Law of Drama: If a gun is shown in Act One, it must be fired before Act Five. The ""gun"" is never fired in ""Stalker"". What we are left with is a moderately difficult trek though overgrown fields and abandoned ruins, interspersed with moderately interesting philosophical discussions. As viewers, the characters instruct us to consider all this to be spiritually mysterious and pregnant with meaning, but in the end we as viewers see none of this. In contrast, consider the magnificently structured final scene in Andre Rublev, the Casting of the Great Bell. Here no one tells us ""this is going to be moving and charged with meaning""  - it just is. We need no instruction in how we're supposed to react - we just do.

So is it a ""bad"" movie? No. But it is a disappointing one, mainly because Tarkovsky has set the bar so high in his other, far superior works. It is still better than 99% of the garbage that Hollywood spews out on a daily basis.

I give it 3.1416 stars.",1323043200,4,2034,4.654596100278551
503562,5,6302719666,"Tarkovsky at his best. I guess it would be more respectable to say Andrei Rublev is my favorite Tarkovsky movie, since it's not science fiction, but I like this more.

I admire a director like Tarkovsky who can make a movie strictly on his own terms, taking as much time as he wants to hold a shot, never being hurried by concerns over what ""the audience"" might think. I doubt I could be that brave were I to make a film. Probably the closest any other director came to this philosophy was Stanley Kubrick in 2001.

I advise anybody interested in this movie to read Andrei Tarkovsky's book Sculpting in Time; it's the best thing I've ever read about movies.",1291075200,2,657,4.466666666666667
503563,5,6302719666,"In 1986, the film world lost one of its unique contributors in Andrei Tarkovsky, who helped to redefine the sci-fi genre with Solaris in 1972 and 1979's sometimes-forgotten masterpiece, Stalker. One of the progenitors of the ""slow burn"" plot pace, which came to dominate much of the science-fiction epics of the 1970s, Tarkovsky focused on the psychological consequences, rather than technological aspects, of the future and its revolutionary discoveries. Though both of these films center on indirect meetings between man and intangible alien life forms, Stalker takes the concept one step further and completely strips it of anything resembling technological advancement. Centered on ""the Zone,"" a forbidden area in rural Russia where something happened 20 years ago (nobody knows for sure what), Stalker concerns a noted guide of the Zone and his attempt to bring two passengers into the area for purposes of exploration, enlightenment, and ultimately fulfillment. After sneaking through the heavily guarded gates to the Zone, the guide and his passengers encounter a decrepit village area, littered with rusted objects and distended foliage overgrowth. In a likely homage to the Wizard of Oz, the film itself changes from the drab, depressing sepia of the ""real"" world into vivid color, accentuating the unreality of what appears to be a typical, though abandoned, country village. Nothing, of course, is what it seems in the Zone, and the further the characters delve into it, the more it messes with their minds. We learn the fears, ambitions, and flaws of the characters as they venture deeper into the Zone, and when they arrive at their final destination, a place that supposedly grants one's innermost wishes...well, I don't want to spoil it for you. Stalker requires, like other films of its time and genre, a certain degree of patience from the viewer--patience that is handsomely rewarded in the end. Five invisible, psychokinetic stars. Watch this when you have 1) A better-than average attention span and 2) About three hours to kill.",1284076800,5,2049,5.25

503565,5,6302719666,"In his return to the sci-fi genre, seven years after Solaris, Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky delivers another stupefying vision. This time, it's of a world in ruins following the strike of a meteor, which has left in its wake an area called ""The Zone"", wherein there is a room that is said to have the ability to grant one his or her most intimate desires. Permitted to enter and exit ""The Zone"" are guides called ""Stalkers"", one of which is the film's main focus, a man played by Alexander Kaidanovsky who goes into ""The Zone"" with two others (credited simply as ""Writer"" and ""Scientist""). As great sci-fi films are often able to do, Stalker presents its central idea through sequences of beauty and metaphorical poetry. Its central idea is faith, which, in the film, contends against science and technology. As a production, Stalker is one of the more contemplatively gorgeous movies ever made -- it's articulate, though subtle; modest, yet overwhelming; and extremely powerful, despite its apparent quiet intention to be slip by the viewer unnoticed.",1266364800,2,1056,5.005681818181818
503566,3,6302719666,"The Bottom Line:

In an American road movie you travel along a path and stop to meet interesting characters, in this Russian version you travel along a path and stop to have long, tedious philosophical conversations; while many of the images the film presents (the sepia-toned world, tanks festooned with ivy and overgrowth) are beautiful, it seems that so much more could have been done with the science-fiction premise that would have made the film less staid and soporific.

503567,5,6302719666,"Twenty years ago, a meteorite fell to Earth, and decimated a provincial Russian town. Villagers traveled through this curious area, now known as The Zone, and disappeared. Stories purport that there is an inner chamber within The Zone called The Room that grants one's deepest wish. Fearing the consequences from such an inscrutable resource, the army immediately secured the area with barbed wire and armed patrol. But the desperate and the suffering continue to make the treacherous journey, led by a disciplined, experienced stalker who can stealthily navigate through the constantly changing traps and pitfalls of The Zone. A successful Writer (Anatoli Solonitsyn), perhaps searching for inspiration or adventure, and a Scientist (Nikolai Grinko) searching for Truth, enlist the Stalker (Aleksandr Kaidanovsky) to guide them through The Zone. The Stalker has been trained by a renowned stalker named Porcupine, who, after an excursion with his brother into The Zone, returned alone and infinitely wealthy, only to commit suicide a week later. Soon, it is evident that reaching The Zone is not their greatest impediment, but the uncertainty over their deepest wish. As the men approach the threshold to The Room, their fear and trepidation for the materialization of their answered prayers leads to profound revelation and self-discovery.

Stalker is a visually serene, highly metaphoric, and deeply haunting treatise on the essence of the soul. Episodically, Andrei Tarkovsky uses chromatic shifts to delineate between the outside world and The Zone. Thematically, as in Solaris, the transition serves as an oneiric device to separate physical reality from the subconscious. The created barriers and imposed laws of the outside world parallel the Stalker's incoherent tracking methods for reaching The Room. Note that despite the Stalker's warning not to use the same path twice, the Scientist returns to retrieve his knapsack unharmed, casting doubt on the Stalker's navigational rules. Symbolically, it is as if the subconscious is in denial of its sincerest wish, creating its own boundaries and impediments to prevent its realization. After a circuitous route, the men arrive at the antechamber to The Room, hesitant to proceed, unable to define their innermost wish: their spiritual longing. The floor is strewn with coins, hypodermic needles, weapons, and religious icons: a reflection of the mind's search for escape from its misery. In the end, The Zone's real or imagined powers proves to be inconsequential to the weary, ambivalent seekers. It was all in the journey.",1262822400,11,2581,5.43640897755611
503568,5,6302719666,"Tarkovsky's fifth feature film, and the last one he made in the USSR, depicts a profound and unsettling journey into the mysterious regions of human desire.  Probably his best film and likely the best introduction to his work, the film employs the trappings of science fiction in order to explore the relation between literature and science, between reason and faith, and between the individual and the state.

A strange region, of unknown origins, is created in the midst of an unnamed authoritarian country.  Unable to destroy the ""Zone"" through force, the authorities sealed it off, guarding its borders; only a few have the courage to enter, inspired by legends of a hidden room in the depths of the zone where one's deepest desires can be granted.  A scientist and a writer solicit the help of an outlawed ""stalker"" to help them find their way through the zone.  Only they can determine whether they have courage to face their own deepest longings.

The film exhibits many of Tarkovsky's distinctive stylings - long, slow takes with subtle camera movements, spare and inventive use of soundtracks, obsession with the ruins of human dwellings, quotations from his father's poetry, alternation between color and monochrome photography - but here these are very much in the service of the story, and the story is very much in the service of creating a mood and atmosphere for reflection that evokes the concerns of the characters, who serve both as types (scientist, writer, spiritual guide) and as very distinctive individuals.  The world outside of the zone is depicted in a high contrast sepia, while the inner regions of the zone are in vivid color, for example.  Tarkovsky suggested that his composer not create an orchestral soundtrack, but rather to draw upon the natural sounds of the scenes depicted in order to make music of them, most evident perhaps as the three travelers enter the zone on a train car, and the rhythms of the rails create an otherworldly music.

What makes Stalker so remarkable is that it works on so many levels.  As a science fiction voyage, it is inventive and unusual, and creates a real atmosphere of wonder and dread, and brings the mysteries of the Zone to life through creative use of real locations.  As a poetic exploration of human desire, it is subtle and powerful and the beautiful imagery creates the right atmosphere for and the long takes give the space for real reflection on nature and civilization and possibilities for transcendence.  As a philosophical investigation, the dialogue is sure to stimulate reflections on the relation between art and science, between faith and reason, and between the individual and community.  Highly recommended for seekers of truth and stalkers of exciting cinema.

On the DVD: it looks quite good, and I'm glad to see that Kino put some care into this release, though it seemed to me that sometimes the color balance was off, and that when there was a shift from long establishing shots to medium or closeups the lighting levels didn't match precisely.  As I recall, I didn't notice that issue in the older VHS copy - even though the picture and especially the sound in this version are superior to that one in other respects - or when I saw this in a theater from a 35mm print about 15 years ago.  The extras are valuable - a few interviews with people who worked on the film.  The interview with Eduard Artemyev regarding Tarkovsky's ideas about sound was interesting.  And I thought ""Memory,"" a rare short film depicting the ruins of Tarkovsky's childhood home in Moscow, was quite provocative.  Most intriguing, perhaps, was the interview with production designer Rashit Safiullin.  He lived with Tarkovsky throughout the two years of production, with the first year ending in disaster when the experimental Kodak film they had used could not be developed, so that the film had to be remade completely, with a much smaller budget, and in a very different way.  He describes that period as like being in the zone, where you speak only the most honest words about the most important subjects.  Outside the zone you dissimulate, you seek to impress; inside your inner truth is revealed, whether you are superficial, whether you have something to say, what it is you really want.  He claims to have experienced such intimacy during his time with Tarkovsky.",1262736000,7,4343,4.9030054644808745
503569,5,6302719666,"""The Stalker""(1979) is directed by Andrei Tarkovsky, and based loosely on the novel ""The Roadside Picnic"" by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. The film mostly takes from the last chapter of the novel when Redrick and a boy enter the Zone, only in the movie it is three men who enter the Zone together. The Zone is a region of alien refuse that contains things that are beyond our understanding and are a source of danger and power. The Stalkers are individuals who enter the Zone in order to retrieve alien technology, or safely lead people through the dangerous terrain. The ultimate trophy in the Zone is a device rumored to grant a person's most deep seated wish. Tarkovsky takes us through an amazing terrain of abandoned factories, fields of destroyed tanks, and subterranean tunnels all the while leading us through the psyche and thoughts of the three men on this journey. It is a beautifully haunting journey on the intersection of science, morality, imagination, faith, and skeptism.

This special two disc DVD set has the movie on one disc, and special features, including interviews, on another. The movie can be played in Russian with English, French , or Spanish subtitles, or dubbed in English and French. One can also choose to listen to the movie in 5.1 surround sound, or in mono.

But don't give up :-), after reading the book and the 2nd watching I was so impressed. Every scene is great as a photography, and the lyrics by Arseniy Tarkovsky are very powerful.

503612,5,6302719666,"Having finally come to love Solaris, I set out to watch other Tarkovsky films. This being one of his other most popular, and also a science fiction tale, it was decreed to be next. We open with a slow reveal of a grimy room in sepia photography--even now we can marvel at the richness and texture of the images. After some loooong credits, a quote from a fictitious Nobel Prize winner about The Zone: No one knows whether it was caused by a meteorite or was created by aliens, but it is acknowledged as a miracle. Originally they sent in police to investigate, but they never returned. Since then The Zone has been cordoned off and all access forbidden. It is said that in the room at the center of The Zone one's innermost wish will come true. This has led to the employ of Stalkers, people who lead others in for money, but never enter the room. By the way, the word ""stalker"" is meant in its original sense, that is, one who approaches something very carefully and steadily.

So the camera slowly enters a room where a couple is sleeping. We pan at a glacial pace left across the sleeping couple, then slowly back. The man wakes and tries to slip out, but his wife wakes and berates him for leaving again. She says he's addicted to The Zone, isn't thinking of her and their daughter--who was born with defects as stalkers' children often are--and will be sent be sent back to prison. He replies that to him, everywhere is a prison. He leaves, and his wife falls to the floor, writhing in a highly sensual emotional agony.

A couple waits by a nasty shipyard. The man, who we'll know as the Writer, complains that everything in life is so boring and he has lost his engagement with reality long ago. Again, the photography is gorgeous and impeccably composed: for example, look at the frame below. You have the couple in front of this beautiful jumble of old ships in the distant mist, with a tree dividing the frame toward the left. Much of the movie is just unbelievably gorgeous like this, with shots as composed, rich and textured as paintings. The first part of the movie also lays out this reality as a dank, nasty, polluted nightmare world.
The stalker takes the Writer to meet the Professor, the other guy he'll be escorting into the Zone today. The Writer, who, it must be said, is a trifle bitter, makes a speech about how a treasured antique in a museum might have been just a slop bowl when it was produced and used, and defrauded ""all those connoisseurs."" Yep, life is dead to him--and he won't shut up about it. The Writer is also cut off from life and unable to write. So this happy bunch set off in a jeep to enter the zone and have their wish fulfilled [I want a pony!] and maybe find something to live for again.

They drive through this incredibly evocative deserted industrial city--they obviously have some super-powerful fog machines at their disposal--while the Writer shares his many thoughts on how life totally sucks. I used to think I was bitter. They spot a train being let into the big gate to the zone, and rush their jeep in after it, drawing machine gun fire from the guards. Once inside they are safe--from the guards, at least--because no one would dare venture in.

In the zone, the photography switches to vivid color, although it too is a green wasteland, littered with hulks of abandoned cars, tanks and buildings. It's kind of amazing the low-burning tension this film is able to create while moving at such a slow pace, something those who found themselves getting into Solaris will be familiar with. This one is, comparatively, a total edge-of-your-seat thriller, however.

As they proceed the Stalker keeps warning them about the various terrible things that can happen to them if they wander off alone or try to hurry--yet nothing ever happens. He says that the place is constantly rearranging itself, and that ""no one comes out the same way they came in."" He ties ribbons to steels nuts and throws them ahead in their path, to make sure it's safe to go that way. Soon the writer starts to think the Stalker is just full of stuff--this is his basic view of humanity anyway--and wants to hurry off on his own. The Stalker becomes quite impassioned about how they must listen to him... apparently the personalities of the people one is traveling with affect one's visit, the obstacles one faces, and suchlike. They regroup, continue on, and this is the end of part one.

The Writer is getting nastier and nastier, and they're all starting to hate each other. The Professor has smuggled in instruments to measure the Zone, which the Stalker thinks is just so much silliness. These two do not seem to grasp the mystical nature of the Zone, which the Stalker laments. They lay down to sleep, and the Writer starts up his philosophical musings on how the world is crap and people are rotten, causing the Professor to tell him to shut up and ""Keep your complexes to yourself."" The Writer then says he just wants to say one more thing... and starts on another bitter monologue on another topic. Then we have an absolutely gorgeous slow track up a stream, looking at various little objects embedded in the stream, then a slow track back. The whole shot lasts three minutes.

SPOILERS > > >
They continue. At a certain point they have to go through a tunnel, which the Stalker says is very dangerous and refers to as ""the meat grinder,"" but nothing at all dangerous happens. The Writer was asked to go first, however, a fact that he is very bitter about. The Professor has brought a gun, they now find out, and when a phone suddenly rings, he answers it and indicates that he's going to cause some trouble when they finally reach the room. The Stalker is all psychologically anguished that people could be so nasty, bitter and cynical. They finally reach the threshold of the room.

They are warned that the room will grant their innermost wish, which may not be the best thing. For example, a previous fellow who went in had a wish that in some way required the death of his brother to make possible, and the wishee ended up killing himself a week later for guilt. They ask the Writer to go in first, but had to go through the tunnel first and he's not gonna go. So they ask the Professor to go, and he reveals that he has a bomb. He's going to destroy the room, because it might one day fall into the wrong hands. They have a physical and verbal fight for the bomb, but the Stalker can't get it, causing him more anguish, since the promise of the Zone is ""all the people of this Earth have left.""

They talk. Eventually the Professor disassembles the bomb and throws it away. They all sit down together, and it starts raining inside, into a pool of water in the foreground. We see a fish near the detonator, and then a black pool of oil spreads over the water.

Now we are back in the bar, the men having returned. A black dog that they saw in the Zone has returned with the Stalker. He goes home and laments the soul-deadness of the two men, how you can't choose the personalities of who you travel with, and that people should be so without hope. His wife says that he should pity them, but he seems to take it very personally, that they cannot appreciate the gift he would have given them. We never find out if they made it into the room, but I came away feeling like they all just waited outside.

The Stalker's wife then makes a speech, to the camera, about how difficult it is to love a Stalker, what with him being emotionally distant and the time in jail and the mutant children and all--Girls, it ain't easy. Then we see their daughter wandering around, having to use crutches. She sits down at a table as we hear the sound of a train going by--like in the first scene of the film--and she stares at three glasses, sliding them across a table, apparently with her mind, until one falls off. The end.
< < < SPOILERS END

It was very poetic. I think one has to consider it more as a visual poem than anything, and the reasons I say that is that it unfolds with a number of beautiful images and evocative ideas, none of which come to any definite point or statement, but which define the ideas, and the act of experiencing and processing them, as the point. The images are held so long [the movie is 163 minutes and there are only 142 shots] that in a way you stop paying attention to what is ""happening"" and enter into a subconscious haze, where several interesting thoughts play through your mind: dreary lives in squalor without hope, bitterness and the inability to escape it, having to submit oneself to a higher power, not being able to choose your companions, your combined personalities creating your experience, and more. One spends the entire movie thinking something is just about to happen, but one doesn't really resent the movie when it doesn't, since the whole journey WAS the experience.

Apparently much of the exteriors were shot in Tallin, Estonia, where there is now a plaque up commemorating this movie's production. Tarkovsky shot all of the exteriors with one cinematographer, whom he had a rather troubled relationship with, then later discovered that all of his footage, a year's worth of work, was damaged and unusable. This apparently almost caused the director a nervous breakdown. He began again with another cinematographer, and interestingly, people who have seen both say that the footage was virtually identical. Ultimately it ended up taking three years to finish the film. Some see it as prophetic of Chernobyl, where you have another Russian Zone that is cordoned off and cannot be visited.

This film ends up being strikingly thematically similar to Solaris, in structure and topic. There is a prologue in a dreary real world where the characters are set up, then they venture into a place where the rules of nature are suspended, and they are forced to take a deep journey into their minds and emotions. One could see the planet is Solaris as granting wishes, like the room is said to do here. The personalities of the primary people involved, three men in both cases, create the circumstances they have to deal with. Both films end with them returning, in a sense, to the environment of the beginning, with vastly different perspectives, based on their experience. In retrospect, Solaris has a little more of a hook, but this one is perhaps richer and more rewarding, and also has much greater visual variety.

Anyway, certainly a specialized taste, and a film that will bore the eyelids off people who aren't prepared for how very slow Tarkovsky can be, but one that that is thoughtful and beautiful and very much worth watching.

It's undeniably very good, but also extremely esoteric and most people will probably not want to sit through it.",1252022400,6,10726,4.578645833333334
503613,5,6302719666,"It seemed to me... I don't know, this is probably too simplistic, but it seemed to me that the Zone is the Kingdom of Heaven on earth, which is to say, the Church.  The Stalkers are priests.  Everything both in the Zone and outside the Zone is ruined, signifying the state of the earth after the Fall in the Garden.  Outside the Zone (the world) is colorless and grimy.  Inside the Zone, things are better (colorful) but still not perfect- perfection is found in the Room, which I think is Heaven.  The scary, unseen things that terrorize them are demons. The dog's an angel.  The stalkers (priests) are outlaws because priests were outlaws in the USSR.  The little girl is in color because the Kingdom of Heaven (the Zone) is like a little child. The ""alien"" presence that came to earth, then left, was Christ Himself.  The strange physics of the Zone represent miracles.  Even the gerry can of gasoline which powered their entrance into the Zone-  what else could it be but the Holy Spirit, who is represented as oil (fuel) in the Gospels? The journey to the Room is a long, arduous struggle, which is the Russian view of the path to salvation, a path that you can leave if you choose.

To me, this movie seemed like a Russian Orthodox Pilgrim's Progress, cloaked as sci fi  to get past the Soviet censers.",1247184000,5,1308,4.519148936170213
503614,5,6302719666,"The problems with Stalker is that you have to be a certain kind of person to understand it. Stalker, unfortunately, is more of an artist's movie. The movie is about the three men making a huge metamorphosis, and you have to watch it and really pay attention to every little detail as you move through the movie. It's slow, but it's slow for a purpose. It's a masterpiece, but you won't understand why unless you look deeply into it. The movie has a plot, but not a plot in the sense that Western cinema has brought us to expect. It's like the difference between, say, a novel and a poem. Stalker would be the poem: it relies on symbolism and the subconscious to try and portray it's message, and Tarkovsky accomplishes this wonderfully, provided you're patient and can really pay attention to the full depth of the film. Even the music in this movie is symbolic, in fact, Tarkovsky hinted that his score was sort of a reflection of East-West relations during the cold war, emphasized by the combination of a flute, tar, and Artemyev's synthesizer to give the music a weird, unearthly feel. Don't go into this movie expecting a clear plot, there isn't one. You really have to pay attention and think about the movie, and this is one of the reasons I adore it. It's a quest of faith, a search inside oneself, effecting the viewer as much as it effects the characters. In a way, you almost have to fit the Stalker's description of the kind of man he wishes to take to see the Room in the center of the Zone: A man who has lost all, and is hopeless. The kind of person who needs a journey of such magnitude and emotional depth as Stalker provides. You can enjoy the film either way, but to truly be effected by it, you must be able to relate to the characters, and see the journey through their eyes. It's a difficult movie, without a doubt, and certainly isn't for everyone; but is is an artistic masterpiece and triumph of storytelling through deep symbolism and subtle imagery, as well as a long and thoughtful sojourn through the soul.",1246838400,5,2035,4.487870619946092

503618,5,6302719666,"STALKER is truly the masterpiece of Tarkovsky.  If Andrei Rublev was an exploration of the spiritual artistic suffering of mankind, and if SOLARIS was the exploration of science's inability to ever know what is REAL, and what is not, then STALKER is the combination of both themes.  This film is not about a Stalker, who might follow you around town. This is a STALKER, in the exact sense that there used to be TRIP LEADERS, when a group of people would gather for a spiritual LSD experience.  One person was experienced with THE TRIP, and would lead neophytes thru the maze of illusions, and delusions, looking for that ultimate experience of reality.  This movie works, in many ways, like a psychedelic drug trip, tho there is almost nothing psychedelic about it, in the way most people think of a ""psychedelic"" film, unless that film were ERAISERHEAD. The common motif is the way Lynch used an expanded sense of TIME in his film, to disorientate the viewer.  Time is expanded and stretched all thru THE STALKER. Likewise Space constantly changes from normal vectors and straight lines, to spirals and fractal images. Its as strange as anything from SOLARIS, and as emotional as RUBLEV is.

First off, Tarkovsky's idiomatic artistic devices, are perfected here. The film is Black and white when you are in THE WORLD, and color, when you are in THE ZONE.  The Zone is an off limits area of the world, where an alien intelligence landed THE ROOM like an asteroid. Around THE ROOM arose THE ZONE, which is beyond human conscousness, beyond causality and reality. In these middle parts of the film what is, and what COULD be, combines, and dissolves, and recombines again.  The STALKERS who lead you thru THE ZONE,  are all criminals. Government placed an iron curtain placed around THE ZONE, after suffering great losses trying to attack the ROOM. Still, people enter THE ZONE to reach THE ROOM which grants your INNERMOST WISH.  Some people try and succeed, others die trying. Because there is a menacing danger, more scary than ANY vampire in cinematic history. For who can live with their INNERMOST WISH (subconscous desires) made real? Who is that strong? Who knows what their own heart most wishes to own? In the film, this isn't a philosophical question, but a burning question facing the men before THE ROOM. THE STALKER, who represents a priest, leads THE PROFESSOR and THE WRITER, who represent SCIENCE and ART, to a place beyond human understanding, much like God is.  But knowing this analogy does NOTHING to clarify the film's intent. Instead, if the film has any intention, its to give yourself up to the journey to your innermost desires. Because like all great art, its a journey inside your heart and brain.  In that sense THE ZONE is the esthetic experience, and THE ROOM is artwork. Like a great poem, its all up to you what it means.

 Nothing about the film states a time period, except for a future where all is grey and lifeless, where hope and faith is lost. (THE STALKER often bemoans this fact, like a priest.) The film seems to proceed slower than it does, because so many shots are closer to still art photography. The ""false - energy"" of moving camera cinematography, like in those shaky ""cinema verite"" hand helt video camera angles, or tracking shots, is exchanged for a static, inner stillness with the cinematic viewpoint. Also, the script has periods of spoken poetry in the film, along with a very industrial, minimalistic drone type soundtrack. The KLANGKLANG of trains on rails, is the rythymic backround of JOURNEYING. THE STALKER hears the train sound of journeying, even when he wishes most to escape the journey. Like ERAISERHEAD,  ambient sounds are amplified, and distorted, to give the sense of the hell of modern industrial citylife.  If you can absorb poetry, or read philosophy, or meditate, then you will enjoy this film.  This film works thru a meditation on your innermost desires, and what YOU WOULD DO to realize them. Since the film's basic concept centers on alien intelligence, and how it can manifest your deepest desires, you have SCIENCE FICTION. ( IT's the same concept as SOLARIS.)  Most Tarkovsky's films explore the intersect between art, philosophy and religion.  If you look for it, you will find it. When you find it, it lasts inside your heart a lifetime. Popcorn adventure films might bring you to the edge of your seat when you watch them, but a year later, you won't remember the title of the film.  If you watch STALKER, you will never forget it.
UPDATE
Upon further consideration, I'll make another observation. If SOLARIS is Tarkovsky's 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY, then I think its fair to say that STALKER is his WIZARD OF OZ. Like WoZ, you have someone going from the mundane world, to a special world of dangers and adventures. When the Stalker, the Poet and Scientist enters the ZONE, they move from B&W to color. The whole goal, is to arrive in a special room where your wishes shall be granted. (As the Wizard would do for Dorothy, when she gets to his chamber.) However, the road to OZ is not a direct one, but circuitous, with many dangers, as is true with the road to the special room in the Zone. Finally, what does the STALKER discover? The wishes don't matter from the ZONE. Instead, he learns that there's no place like home. The more I thought about this, the more I had to wonder if perhaps Tarkovsky was making references to WoZ. Like any artist, I'm sure he makes comments on the films that came before him, within his work.",1228780800,10,5505,4.744502617801047

The movie maker has only so much time, so most of the underlying story revealed in ROADSIDE PICNIC will be lost on the viewer, or the viewer lost. This is also a movie that is best viewed in uninterrupted silence.

And, yes, ""Stalker"" was a terrible choice for the title, especially because that term had taken on an awful criminal/psycho association in the US press. He should have left it as simply ""The Guide"".",1225670400,4,577,4.548076923076923
503620,3,6302719666,"Watching Tarkovsky's Stalker was not an enjoyable experience, but it did make something about his achievement much clearer to me. In this film, and in most of his work that I have seen, Tarkovsky tells the viewer nothing: no plot, no characters, no resolution. He sets up an ambience through beautifully textured photography and lighting, stunning command of soundscapes, and a carefully undefined nexus of meaning. Then he allows the viewer to create a meaning. For some it is an overwhelming experience, for others a bore. This is not cinema as we normally know it but much closer to the effect of great poetry. It is sound and setting used as metaphor by means of which we can create what we can. Or not.

Forget the Strugatsky's Roadside Picnic (just as you had to forget Lem's Solaris when watching Tarkovsky's film of the same name). There is something called the Zone, but we don't know what it is, where or why it occurred. For the confused or troubled, something inside the Zone can provide a revelation. What it is or how it works we don't know. It's perimeter is guarded, but we don't know who guards it or why. Three men enter the Zone, we don't really know why, nor who they are. Viewers who claim to know more are reading information from the novel's plot, or quoting other viewers who are.

The Stalker (think of one of Fenimore Cooper's characters like the Deerstalker), the Writer, the Scientist are on a journey like Dante's. They seem confused and inarticulate, but they do know something is wrong, and they hope to remedy it, somehow, within the Zone. The Stalker is as driven as the other two.  Tarkovsky suggests what the men are seeking by filming outside the Zone, a sterile no man's land of ruin, in a washed out sepia, and inside the Zone, a lush natural tangle of vegetation, in vibrant colour.

Stalker is about the search for redemption, filmed in such a way the viewer must conduct the search themselves. Unlike Solaris, whose themes of love and memory were presented in the form of a screenplay the viewer could engage with, Stalker is a much more extreme film which approaches the limit of what a film can do. It is a film which can have no clear climax, no rationale, no explanation. The journey is the important part.

I regret the fact my rational self would not let go while watching it, that I thought the lack of proper names risible and just like everybody's first novel, that the contrast between inside and outside the Zone was too obvious. I hated that the film was unnecessarily divided over two disks as it was for VHS release and that the subtitles were sometimes in such bad English they were hard to follow.  This time around it wasn't for me. Maybe next time.",1224979200,9,2707,4.605809128630705
503681,5,6302719666,"Maybe you know it yourself, the so-called ""Hour of the Wolf"", defined in my favorite Sci-Fi series Babylon 5 as follows:
""My father taught me about it. It's the time between three and four in the morning. You can't sleep and all you can see is the troubles, and the problems, and the ways that your life should have gone, but didn't. All you can hear is the sound of your own heart. At times like this, my father used to take one large glass of vodka before bed, to keep the wolf away he said. Then he would take three very small drinks of vodka, just in case she had cubs while she was waiting outside.""

I think we all have hours like these, maybe at a different time as the one mentioned above, but nevertheless. When in such moments hope seems far off and the beating of your heart is not the knock on a door that is opened as a result offering a new perspective, no, if all doors remain closed and the wolf has not left your house for a long time, wouldn't it be wonderful if there were a place, where hope is reborn and wishes fulfilled?
You say, there is no such place, but there is. You have to go to a place in Russia, strictly off limits to anyone, guarded on the periphery by soldiers, in short almost impossible to get to.
In all likelihood you'll give up on the plan, already ridiculed by friends and acquaintances, since there's no way to get past the soldiers, the road blocks and even if you do succeed, where exactly do you go, because there are no maps of this area where the house is supposed to be located where hope lost can be found again.

That is, unless you know a guide, who knows how to get around the obstacles ... his name is Stalker and the area ominously known as ""The Zone"" he knows like his back pocket. It's the place where he is happy and where each time he makes the trip puts his life at risk.
We get to know his most recent companions in this Tarkovsky masterpiece as a burnt out and cynical writer and a scientist who seems extremely focused on his backpack. Stalker informs them that the Zone has its own laws and you can't get from A to B in a straight line or the Zone will punish you and therefore Stalker uses screws tied to handkerchiefs and throws them haphazardly and wherever it lands, that's their next destination.
What follows is a surreal and philosophical journey to the deepest truth to each of the three men, who are , every one for his own reasons, men without hope, that desperately need to find the Room to find an answer to their desperation.
It will turn out to be Stalker's most difficult journey, which as never before will put to the test the meaning of his endeavors to the Zone as to his entire existence.
The movie Stalker is a work of art difficult to put into words. It is a journey, an exploration of the deepest layers of your being, with half the time not even knowing exactly why. If you allow the movie to take you along, you will experience a journey that is unique which will confront you with difficult questions like the ancient one concerning the meaning of life or whether science has impoverished us to such a degree that the sound of wind in the trees and grass dancing to its rhythm will not make us stop in breathless expectation and that maybe hopelessness has already spread so widely, that the well of wishes has dried up long ago.
The images are of a unique beauty and visual poetry unequalled, supported by the intriguing electronic music of Artemyev (who also wrote the music to Tarkovsky's ""Solyaris"").
Kaidanowsky as the title character is amazing to look at and the Zone itself will bind you in its spell and make an indelible impression.

A journey between black and white and color, science and nature, fear and hope.

503682,4,6302719666,"Andrei Tarkovsky's 1979 film Stalker (''''''') is not the great nor masterful film its most ardent critical supporters proclaim, nor is it the slow, boring Eurotrash that its most vocal critics counterclaim. It lies somewhere in between- a film that risks and occasionally fails, although it is far closer to greatness than trash. That's because Tarkovsky has crafted a film of unusual visuals with even more unusual power. There are scenes that recall the old telefilm The Lathe Of Heaven, released the same year as this film, 1979; Carl Theodor Dreyer's great Vampyr, in its use of shadows and fog; the 1976 sci fi classic Logan's Run, in that the three leads of the film are running away from their society; Tarkovsky's earlier Solaris, in its mix of color and sepia images; and, most of all, with Alex Proyas' 1998 sci fi classic Dark City, which, like Stalker, creates a wholly believable alternate world unlike any other put on screen. Visually, Stalker most reminds me of the human portraits of the great Austrian painter Egon Schiele, with its myriad of gaunt, pallid, balding, dirty, twisted characters.
  But, as in most Tarkovsky films, it is not the visuals that dominate, rather the philosophic depth of the characters. What they don't say or dream is almost always as important as what they do say and dream. Stalker succeeds because its ellipses are more brilliant than its fodder. Stalker misses greatness, however, because its fodder some times fails.... Of course, there are the usual misreadings by critics, who praise the very things that do not work- like the ending, or imbue their own interpretations of Stalker as a Christ-like figure (his being a religious character makes him no stand-in for a religious figure), when the film is surprisingly shorn of any religious mumbo jumbo (humanist philosophy and religion are not analogues), and the three lead characters are in no way merely symbols- of Christian Wise Men, the Trinity, nor any tripartite invocation. Do they bear some symbolism? Of course, since they are known only by their professions. But, each is a unique character, not a caricaturization. Thus, Stalker achieves a rare intimacy in film, one absent from most films, Hollywood or foreign, and if not a great film, certainly it is an excellent film, and one of the most unique visions committed to screen.

503687,2,6302719666,"After seeing the masterpiece 'Ivan's Childhood' by Tarkovsky I was determined to find his other films on DVD. 'Stalker' which, if my memory serves me, is photographed by Tarkovsky, but not directed by him; it's a film that lacks the subjectivity of 'Ivan's Childhood'. Tarkovsky's 'Ivan's Childhood', is a wonderful piece of cinema that places the audience within its' frames and reigns you through a devastating story and not rob you of essential and hypnotic moments, 'Stalker' tends to do the opposite. Even if this was a novel, I can't believe that there would be moments in the story where the reader and in this case the viewer would be toyed like this until an important surprising moment in the film arrives, with no foreshadow or even a slight forboding in its' narrative... an approach this intense story would have deserved ... so it just lays an egg.

Why would you make a film with stunning photography and moments of incredible mood, with an interesting, compelling story, a wonderfully written script with great actors and rob us of the experience?

My review will not give away any details and my disappointment is not generally about pacing; I love slow moving art, but there are some slow moments that mean nothing in this movie. It takes away the experience of cinema, yet expects us to enjoy it as cinema. I do not highly recommend this movie, but for cinema buffs, when it gets it right, it's worth at least one viewing. To be specific, when it does succeed we are reminded of Kubrick and Hitchcock, so don't look for originality in camera shots but look out for the great photography; there are sublime moments.

503731,4,6302719666,"First of all, I don't think I can critique this like a narrative film. Narrative defined as a series of images and dialog used to create dramatic tension and story. Stalker is more like Russian Ark, or Roma in that it is more pure cinema, like a guided tour through someone's imagination (although they ought to change the DVD packaging art - it's dreadful and incredibly inaccurate!!).

My first impression was that the script was very interesting - really, really made sense to me on a lot of levels. Their was one intellectual 'surprise' that I really liked with regards to the nature of the power of the room and how it related to Porcupine's death. That was great - very 'human condition.'

Visually, there is a grimy, filthy beauty to the non-Zone settings and a wonderfully baroque post-apocalyptic feel to the Zone itself. While there are several sublime moments in the film that are transcendant, one has to question the entire package these 'moments' come in.  There was something absurd in the camera tracking the men as they threw nuts with white fabric and walked around the Zone talking. The dialog between them was interesting to me and I did enjoy the play of ideas, but there was a severe disjointment between those ideas and the choice of physical action rendered in scene (maybe on purpose?). What I mean to say is Tarkovsky assumes his images have a larger import than they may have intrinsically. I don't buy a lot of the more mundane Zone imagery even as I understand and deeply buy the screenplay/dialog. To me, this dialog could have been spoken by other characters and rendered in other settings - his final choice of setting and plot doesn't feel like the only choice (or even the preferred one) and I think that is a serious flaw in any art.  I can compare this with 2001 in that Kubrick's cinematic images matched the ideas in the script perfectly: there was really no other way one could imagine the ideas in that film rendered. I didn't feel that way with Stalker.  And even if his argument is that LIFE is like that - the immediate surround is banal vs. the limits of man's imagination, I still don't think it works in action as art.

But as a serious meditation on life and a serious attempt at filmmaking, Tarkovsky ranks with the giants of non-narrative cinema. This is a movie you should see one way or the other, regardless of positive or negative reviews.",1197244800,7,2392,4.629716981132075

You have to concentrate throughout the movie and come to your own conclusions and interpretation at the end.

The story has been explained by other reviewers so I won't bother repeating what they have already said.

The acting and cinematography are faultless. Throughout the movie I felt as if I was on the journey to the ""Zone"" with the 3 main characters. So many of the images could stand alone as a photographic work of art.

The quality of the DVD is excellent reproducing the desired look that Tarkovsky wanted.

503737,2,6302719666,"I read many rave reviews of this film and so bought it confident that I would enjoy the film.  Admittedly I'm not a fanboy of Tarkovsky, but I had heard of the storyline of ""Roadside Picnic"" which this was inspired by and which has translated into a fabulous computer game (Stalker -- 2007).  I was fully expecting something strange and perhaps slow, but had an otherwise open mind.  The beginning of the movie is intriguing -- the Stalker and his companions plan to penetrate into the Zone past the military checkpoint.  This they carry off at great risk to themselves.  Finally clear of the military, they confront the Zone itself with all its dangers.  They confront the first appearance of an anomaly in great trepidation.  There is a glimpse of something unusual in the tall grass.  All this should set the heart of players of the game Stalker racing, and without having read the book, I would imagine up to this point the movie is very faithful to the story.

Now had Tarkovsky continued in however minimal a fashion with this great opening, the film would have been stunning.  But the highpoint of the film after this point -- or, excuse me, the highpoint of the action in the film -- would be an encounter with a real dog.  The interim period up until the finale, which had its moments, consists of long looks at murky mud puddles and beautiful long pans of an ugly albeit colorful landscape.  It's an internal film, all right, which is another way to say it is stupefyingly boring unless you're just fine with zero action.  This was Tarkovsky's stated intention -- he knew the story and could have made a post apocalyptic film like so many others, but he wanted something different.

I'm sure I'm in the minority on this one -- otherwise why would so many wax poetic on the brilliance of this film?  But from the perspective of one with a fairly high tolerance for oddity and slow spots, I must say this movie is worth a rental but a hard sell for a permanent spot in ones collection.  I drifted in and out of conciousness trying to stay awake to see something interesting.  Beautifully photographed and musically scored, this is a yawner of staggering eminence.  Here's hoping someone will adapt the story with a bit of Tarkovsky's genius without his obsessions, which I'm afraid render the whole affair rather sterile.",1176595200,19,2329,4.65281173594132
503738,5,6302719666,"This film is as amazing as you have heard.  It's arguably Tarkovsky's best film (and the last one he made completely under the auspices of the USSR), and a film that gets inside your head and your soul. The plot is rather simple.  An alien force lands on Earth, and then leaves. The area where they landed is a vast wasteland where the laws of physics are suspended.  It's been dubbed the zone (or 3OHA in Russian). A stalker (not the current definition), a writer, and a professor venture into the zone, where there is a room that will grant you your most inner wishes. Now, it's not what you ask for, it's what you really desire. The room reads into your soul. This is a very slow, cerebral movie (it wouldn't be a Tarkovsky movie otherwise), but it has to be seen many times to fully comprehend it.  I love Stalker's ""dream"" sequence, which has one of the most amazing shots I've ever seen in cinema. The ending is really exceptional as well. I have seen Stalker at least 10 times, and I can see 10 more. It was a difficult shoot (Tarkovsky had to stop shooting because there was a defect in the film stock he was using.

The DVD company, RUSCICO, remixed the soundtrack to 5.1 dolby, but they ADDED sound to the original film, including music during the ride to the zone (which originally only had dialogue and the sound of the trolley car).

Filmed mostly in abandoned post-war areas in Russia, he transcends reality through the lens.  The film is in two color templates, when in rough reality it is this rich dark sepia tones, and ""the zone"" is mostly shown in vibrant rich sharp colors.  The lighting is unbelievable.  The film follows ""The Stalker,"" a writer, and a professor of science.  The ""Stalker"" takes two considerably intellectual men with open minds on a journey to ""The Zone.""  The ""Zone"" is a place that can bring you absolute happiness and answers to the hardest questions in life if you are in the right mindset.  It is a metaphysical journey into another world, using the power of nature and powers beyond human comprehension.  The ""Stalker,"" knows the ""Zone,"" you could consider him from another world, but the people who tag along for the journey must have faith in him.  If there was no dialog at all, the movie based on the stunning visuals alone would be worth viewing, but the script raises major philosophical questions.  The writer wants something more beyond his dull lush successful life, the scientist wants some sort of proof, and the stalker is whom they have their faith set in.

The bonuses included with the film are fantastic also.  The interviews are about as intense as the movie itself.  They filmed the movie for a year with experimental Kodak film, and the 1st years worth of shooting was completely lost, it could have been on purpose, maybe not, but it was a horrible set back for the whole crew and Tarkovsky.  They still want on, with a lowered budget and some losses with the set, obviously things couldn't be exactly the same, but yet they still managed to create and absolute masterpiece.  If you want to be mind blown...then this film is for you.  It will take you into another world; it will make you question your existence...  This movie requires more then one viewing.  It is broken into two parts, each part is approximately one hour and twenty minutes.  Nobody makes a film like Tarkovsky, there is always hope in his misery, there is always something new to decode in his work, it can be taken intensely personal, it can reflect society as a whole.",1167004800,17,2335,4.716049382716049
503822,5,6302719666,"Andrei Tarkovsky is one of cinema's great visionaries. But the visions that Tarkovsky explores are ones that lie dormant within us all. That he has chosen the science-fiction genre to explore these inner worlds and landscapes in ""Stalker"", only adds to the obtuse and challenging quality of the film. Like ""Solaris"" before it, this is a film devoid of special effects and devoid of the universal narrative concerns and themes which one associates with the genre, one could ask whether it is science-fiction at all. As one expects the patience of the narrative build up is quite demanding and instead of action set pieces, the main sequences of the film are derived through dialogue exchanges. The zone brings up all kinds of ethical concerns which are explored, but it's presence in the world as an Eden like space is its most important function. Just as the harsh, polluted and decaying modern Russia is sepia tinted, the zone is shot in lustrous colour, giving the greens of the vegetation an added lustre and vitality. This formal device to me works in an allegorical fashion. The Zone is a space separate from the corruption and tyranny of a dehumanising communist regime and as such its very existence is the ultimate wish fulfilment for the people. What it actually means and how it comes to be there, remain a mystery and one open entirely to subjectivity.",1159228800,6,1363,4.854077253218884

503826,5,6302719666,"I just finished watching Stalker for the fourth time over a period of three years, and I am now just a little bit closer to that sense that I ""know"" the film, but at the same time realize I will never understand it in all of its complexity. But I will certainly always appreciate and embrace it for the great achievement that it is. Stalker is unquestionably one of my favorite films of all time, and it's its mystery, its slowness, and intellect that make it such. Tarkovsky was truly a genius, not only evident by this film, but also by the many others he directed, including Nostalghia and Solaris.

There is so much in this film. It's about Christianity, Existentialism, Spiritualism, and Annihilism. It's a bone to the destitute and a slap in the face to the greedy. It's a challenge to examine and continuously reexamine one's existence.

""And if there wasn't any grief, our lives wouldn't be better, they'd be worse. Because then there'd be no happiness either. And no hope.""

This is not the easiest film to watch because it moves very, very slowly. The pace is the total antithesis to current American filmmaking. At its best, it's hypnotic, and pausing the film several times to reengage might be necessary. But the journey, paralleling the one to the Zone, is ultimately well worth it. Highly recommended.",1147478400,6,1316,4.737991266375546
503827,5,6302719666,"As with all of his other films, Tarkovsky is the true author of Stalker.  This film is loosely based on Arkady and Boris Strugatsky's Road Side Picnic, and Tarkovsky tried, as he did with Solaris (1972), to downplay the science fiction aspect of Stalker.  Except for a brief explanation at the beginning of the film, Tarkovsky chooses to ignore the speculations as to what could have created The Zone, and the changes within it.  He changed the Strugastsky brother's characters and events almost unrecognizably, as he had done previously with the characters and events in Lem's Solaris, and he shifted the philosophical implications of the story in a more pleasant direction.  Nevertheless, many of the original details of the novel remain.  Stalker is definitely a science fiction film, but its style is unlike that of the pulp and high-tech films, such as the Star Wars Trilogy (1977 - 1983).  It is a very demanding and sometimes inaccessible viewing experience.

This magnificent film almost did not see the light of day.  As the exteriors were being shot (for some three and a half months in Tallinn, Estonia, beginning in May 1977, Tarkovsky encountered a number of problems, starting with some serious disagreements with key members of his crew, but mostly from the bad processing of the apparently out-of-date film stock.  These events led to a serious financial problem, which somehow, almost miraculously, got resolved.  Eventually, in June 1978, a second shooting in Tallinn took place, with the interiors being shot in Moscow, and the premiere took place in May, 1979, to total official disapproval.  The film met with some recognition in the USSR, toward 1981, following its success at the Cannes Festival in 1980, where it was awarded the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury.

With Stalker, Tarkovsky marks the shift toward his later style, with the long takes throughout the film averaging one minute in length, with many which are four minutes or longer.  The scene in the ""telephone room"" lasts almost seven minutes.  These long scenes in turn rely heavily on the talent of the actors to sustain the mood, like Writer's long monologue in the sand mogul room.  Even in a succession of single shots, the Director wants to give the impression of a long take, such as in the ride into The Zone on the flatbed car, which lasts three and a half minutes and actually consists of five shots.

In Stalker, Tarkovsky is definitely more systematic with his use of black-and-white (sepia) and color stocks than he had been in his previous works.  A sickly black-and-sepia is reserved for the polluted and sterile reality of the world of the future, while color represents the escape from this world provided by The Zone.  In the swamp scene and ""Stalker""'s dream, Tarkovsky reverts to is more usual convention, where dreams are shown in black-and-sepia-tones, and reality in color. However, the last scene is in color, implying a leakage of the powers of The Zone into the outside reality.

As always in Tarkovsky's films, the natural world is present.  Water, which used to be the source of life, a redemptive force and a center of regeneration, is now mostly a symbol of decay and pollution.  Often, the men wade through stagnant water, and when clear water flows, it flows over the rusting, decaying remnants of props of civilization: coins, weapons, religious images, hypodermic needles.  The only exception is in the dream scene in the swamp, where the water is somewhat restored to its positive, life-affirming symbols.  In the last scene in The Zone, the men, resigned to their limitations and weakness, sit outside The Room as the rain falls inside, gently blocking them from entering.

The wind, often associated with the spiritual aspects of life, ominously rises when Writer walks directly toward The Room, and he is told to stop.  The earth is a positive force, and upon arriving in The Zone, ""Stalker""'s first act is to lie down and embrace it, and in the swamp, all three men lie upon it.  Like a miracle, there is the luxuriant, if dangerous, Nature ever-present in the Zone, in contrast to the polluted outside world, where it is totally absent.  Birds are part of this Nature: the call of the cuckoo bird is heard numerous times in The Zone.

There is also the mysterious dog, which first appears in the swamp scene, when all three men are lying down, becoming intimately close to the earth.  Up to this point, the men felt totally alienated from their environment, outside and inside The Zone, and it is at the very moment when they start to meditate and remember, that the dog appears: The Zone is its territory.  But at the end of the film, the dog has followed ""Stalker"" outside the Zone, showing that even there, the hope that the men were looking for inside The Zone must somehow also exist here, outside, as the dog establishes its own space even though he becomes domesticated in the process.

Although Tarkovsky usually favors classics by such composers as Bach, Pergolesi, or Purcell, the musical score in Stalker consists almost exclusively of Eduard Artemiev's electronic music mixed with some folk melodies, contributing efficiently to the eerie atmosphere of the film. There are also few distorted musical fragments from Wagner, Ravel, and Beethoven.

Two of Tarkovsky's favorite actors are Nikolia Grinko and Anatoly Solonitsyn.  They appear in five (Grinko) and four (Solonitsyn) of Tarkovsky's Russian films, including Stalker.  Their performances as two lost souls in search of an answer are convincing.  Aleksandr Kajdanovsky is outstanding in his role of a tormented and somewhat pathetic ""Stalker"".  Although Alisa Frejndlikh's appearance in the film is restricted to only few scenes, she is a powerful presence, especially with her monologue at the end of the film.

In Stalker, Tarkovsky juxtaposes a world in decline, polluted and sterile, with a verdant Zone, which has overtaken all human enterprises, as shown by the remnants of rusting cars and tanks, dilapidated buildings, which have been taken over by the luxuriant vegetation. He portrays a society which has severed all links with nature, with its own past, and, as a result, lost its spiritual and moral bearings.

Stalker explores the conflict between science, rationalism, materialism, and cynicism versus spirituality, faith, art, and love.  The three men embody different philosophical principles.  In the beginning of the film, Professor justifies his going into The Zone as pure scientific curiosity, and probably also to reassure himself that The Room's so-called ""miracles"" can, if they ever happened, be examined through the scientific method and explained in a logical, reasonable way.  Professor is a rational being who tries to understand the world according to the law of physics.  However, when he arrives at The Room, Professor divulges his ulterior motive, which is to destroy it with the bomb he was carrying all along in his knapsack.  In doing so, he would remove the incentive for people to visit The Room with irrational hopes, and because ""this place obviously won't bring anybody happiness.""  By blowing up the Room, Professor will stop gangsters, tyrants, megalomaniacs, and all ""the self-appointed benefactors of the human race"" from misusing The Room's power.  But his main reason to blow up The Room is that he does not understand it.

Writer belongs to those people who cannot accept the world as it is.  He is well aware of humanity's decay and of his own as well, but he abhors science, which he does not understand, and would rather look for answers in the supernatural. Writer believes in the redemptive power of art, but he has lost his inspiration.  He would like to believe in the potential of The Room to restore it, but because of his cynicism and self-loathing, he cannot be sure.  He has lost faith in himself and in his writing's capacity to help other people.  Besides, he hates writing, which is for him a torture.

""Stalker"" is alone in showing an inclination toward faith, with his comments regarding Nature and his prayer for his companions to ""become helpless like children.""  ""Stalker"" knows The Zone, and he has total faith in The Zone.  He speaks about it as if it were a living being. ""Stalker"" simultaneously respects and fears The Zone, as he recognizes its potential to provide comfort to the wretched ones who, like himself, have lost all hope, but at the same time it punishes whoever transgresses its rules.  This is, of course, how most religious people see their own Gods. The film contains many Christian images and biblical references, but it would be a mistake to take them in a Christian context:  they stand in a general framework of faith and spirituality.

The redemptive power of love is personified by ""Stalker""'s wife.  Her love and devotion is the final miracle which opposes cynicism and the emptiness of the modern world.  All these ideas are clearly expressed at the film's end, as she addresses the audience with her heartfelt monologue, while at the same time asking her husband to remember the love she feels for him.

As the three characters reach The Room, they can ask for their dearest wishes to be granted, but this would require a painful and searching self-examination, with the realization that what they thought they wanted was not exactly what they now really want. ""You dream of one thing but you get quite another,"" observes Writer.  The film began with the question, ""Will the three men enter The Room?"" and it ends with, ""Why won't the three men enter The Room?""  Professor's true aim was to destroy The Room, which was beyond his scientific understanding.  Now he is forced to consider that there may be a mystery that his Cartesian mind cannot account for.  He shows some humility and acknowledges that it is not up to him to save humanity from itself.  Writer had said that the purpose of his journey was to regain his genius, his inspiration.  However, on the threshold of The Room, he realizes that he may not worthy of accepting The Room's gift.  While he had previously expressed his unworthiness, he now for the first time truly feels it.  As a result of their journey, both men have changed -- some would say for the better -- and although they do not enter The Room, they nevertheless receive its gifts, something quite different than what they expected.  ""Stalker"", however, asks for nothing of The Room because he is a stalker, and stalkers do not enter The Room.  However, ""Stalker"" has faith in The Zone, and does not need reassurances. He is in touch with his ""self,"" aware of his own wretchedness, and his only purpose in making the trip is to guide to faith and hope those more wretched than he.

Musical fragments of Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy,"" in the last sequence, struggling to be heard over the rumble of a passing train, imply a society in decay and the unsettled nature of the film's resolution.  This ending of the film is typically Tarkovskian, in so far as it is open-ended, and deliberately ambiguous, leaving the viewer to create his or her own meaning of the film.",1145318400,11,11080,4.906652360515022

I did notice something shaky about the NTSC transfer in the beginning of the film.  As one viewer describes it, it seems as though the background is seperating from the foreground, the result is a jittery floating bed and characters as though you are in a dreamlike state.  Now I don't remember this being a problem when I first viewed Stalker on VHS many many years ago, nor have I seen how different the PAL version of this dvd compares, it is quite possible that the original film could have been damaged and it was 'fixed'?? ... it would be worth it to check it out the reviews of the PAL version if this may be a problem to some.

Action: not a lot. Effects: an alternation of B&W and color photography - in other words, not a lot. Plot: not a lot, and cryptic. What really hit me, more than any other movie I've seen lately, was the visuals. It opens in a decrepit tenement that rattles every time a train goes by. Everything is a montonous montone, not sepia but a plain, decayed brown. Somehow, Tarkovksy gives that imagery an edge like broken glass.

The Stalker (more of a ""pathfinder"", with allusions to Last of the Mohicans) leads people into the forbidden Zone. Once in, the world's acid monochrome turns into a colored, pastoral scene. Plenty of mystery remains, though: the preternatural senses of the Stalker, and ruins and rubble of some forgotten human habitation. It's a sustained image that the world could barely have imagined before the Chernobyl poisoned so many hundreds of square kilometers: devastation and ruin, complete depopulation, but no touch of violence. Simply the exile of every human, with every human thing vanishing slowly under layers of time. But something is in there - maybe the most important thing in the world. Maybe only the Stalker's daughter knows.

More goes unsaid than said, and much of the the action exists only in the minds of the characters. This movie doesn't give any easy answers about itself. It gives enough, though, and I expect it to give more as I study it more. And I will.

""The most powerful emotional experience on film, September 26, 2005

Reviewer: Milan de Noojer (India) - See all my reviews"" I am floored!! A review as Great as the film in question! No small accomplishment! BRAVO!! I was reluctant to write a review until reading that review. With 200 or more reviews and most of them positive I figured whats the point?! Who would even see it buried beneath the others. Then again, doing so anyway is very ""Stalkerish""??

A make it a point to rent this every now and then. Years ago I would rent it once a year. One day I'll buy it and lend it to others so that I can introduce it to them. ""The most powerful emotional experience on film.""? If I had to pick one I would say I agree with that viewer.

My first viewing was upon renting it from Blockbuster video. I was such a film buff I took a job at a video store to have access to free movies and for the part time income. I don't know if we carried it but I rented it from Blockbuster and paid more money in late fees for it than any film previous or since. I couldn't bring self to finish it. Maybe it was that legendary tedious first ten minutes.

Strange thing is that happens with other movies and you return it partially viewed or not view. I could neither return it nor watch it!? Finally I completed it and considered that task a major accomplishment (like a art movie-seminar) that left me feeling puzzled and....I don't know what and....

503881,5,6302719666,"I first saw a Tarkovsky film when I was 10. It was a pretty young age to watch a film like Andrei Rublyov, but even then I knew this film maker to be different from all the rest. Over the years I have watched all his films except Zerkalo (Mirror), but I have found this film, Stalker, to be the most powerful emotional experience ever captured on celluloid. It never suffices to waste words on a Tarkovsky work, because primarily he's a poet who has chosen the medium of the film out of necessity and because of his training - and like all good poetry his work - the things he manages to express in his films - cannot really be done justice by words. Like one of his characters (Little Man in Sacrifice) says, 'In the beginning was the word...why was it so, Papa?' It sounds almost like an apology to Andrei Tarkovsky.

The main reason I wrote this was because I felt uneasy that there were so many bad ""reviews"" by morons who can't sit through a film that doesn't have blood or sex in it (I feel this view has already been expressed by one of the more mature reviewers). I cannot believe that people can talk about inane films like Titanic and incredible classics like Stalker in the same breath. At least they should have the discretion to know that these are fundamentally different ways of making film. Why, Tarkovsky used slow-motion in only two instances, and on both those instances he did it reluctantly because he was not being natural! He was a director who respected the rights of all the artists - foremost among them the actors - so much that he did not interfere with their ""secrets"", so to say.

Let us forget the tasteless imbeciles. I know this is just a forum for opinions, but I am also disconcerted by so much talk about symbolism in Tarkovsky's films. What symbolism is there is Stalker? Or Rublev? In any of his films? I think we have forgotten, through the glut of bad films, how a film should be like, or what a film looked like before Hollywood corrupted it with its dose of violence and sensual excess. I think, like the images of nature depicted in his films, Tarkovsky's films are pristine, verdant, untouched... and even the slightest ripple in the river is cause for joy, celebration.

We have come a long way from simple pleasures that we have forgotten what joy is... if we get uneasy if the film shows 30 seconds of a river flowing, is it because our time is so precious that in the thirty seconds we would achieve paradise trying to work out the inches to a celebrated torso? Or is it because we have trained ourselves to become callous idiots seeking after sensual pleasures?

Whatever the reason, it cannot be the fault of a film maker keen on showing the simple truths, on giving rushed individuals a glimpse of the spiritual heights he himself has achieved by turning over the most tormenting thoughts again and again that finally only the thought remained, and all the traces of toil were removed... it is a great gift to present a work of art after removing all traces of preparation and toil. His work is there for you to see, if you want to. He never clamoured for fame or wealth. If he had,then he'd have been a billionaire (such crass flicks like X-Men, Matrix, Syamalan's sci-fi ""original"" sci-fi thrillers wouldn't have existed). The sad truth is, a lot many of wealthy idiots in the business would have been doing the dishes if this film hadn't given them ideas. But such is life.

I'd recommend this film to all of those folks who need to be reassured that all the toemtn, all the guilt, all the wretchedness they have endured trying to makse sense of human values like dignity, brotherhood, sacrifice and faith - ideas that get completely forgotten by that overused word called love - yes: such people would find meaning, and only such people. For others, even sympathetic viewers, Stalker would be much of a sacrifice for nothing. There's nothing to be gained by those others. but to the wretched ones the film addresses, it is the last place of hope.

I am not one of the ""winners"", and in general I do not find it hard to understand why. This film does not really fit in the usual Tarkovsky canon, where every film at least tells a story, because it has no story. Time, space and action all move fluidly to the same point to produce several breathtaking moments of truth where we see man at his most compassionate. It's such moments that remind us that human beings are capable of a higher life, of higher values.

In Stalker, probably Tarkovsky's last great film (I do not believe Nostalghia or Sacrifice come even close, and that's mainly because they are personal films, made after a traumatic defection to the West), he deals with several human values conclusively. The main thread is human dignity, then faith, service of others, compassion, selfless love, and hope. He has said all there is to be said to all those things. The film does not leave any open ends, it's conclusive, and this quality is impressive...almost hard to believe. It's the least poetic of his works, he is matching his wits with the greatest prose works of the mould of, say, Crime and Punishment...

I recall someone ruing that this film has been a disappointment after waiting for 20 years. I'm sorry he expected to see something different. But for all these 19 years this is the film I've been waiting to see, and it could not have been any different. It is unique in every respect, and it's the only film of its kind. I only wish vainly that it were not so, that Mr Tarkovsky left us a few more than the eight films that he did. Be that as it may, we should consider ourselves fortunate that we have what we have...",1127692800,26,5649,4.515151515151516
503882,5,6302719666,"I love the trash review directly below! And I always stupidly thought it was drugs and sophomoric attitudes that made films like this impossible for some people.

Working with next to nothing, Tarkovsky conjures up a unique film experience. Imagine a visually magical film about the search for the Grail filmed in someones backyard--it's kind of like that. In some respects it's a bit like Godard's Alphaville...but only in some. It's certainly not a film to ""get,"" but one to get lost in and I think that's why it frustrates a lot of viewers who sometimes think every intelligent film is a puzzle that needs to be worked out. Some film-goers need to understand that one can't always be poetic and linear/literal (I say ""can't always"" to be ironic). Hard point to make in the world's most unpoetical linear/literal society.

Tarkovsky is a master of the tangential, the sublime, the surreal--anything but the direct. I've watched this film nearly a dozen times and I can't tell you what most of it is about--especially the ending (which is utterly devastating and quite beautiful). Well, that's not totally true, I've a fair idea what it's vaguely about; in some ways the meaning's as clear as French criticism. It's just elusive too, because people's souls are slippery eels, and souls seem to be an obsession with Tarkovsky.

I'd put hard money on this being a great film but it's tough to prove it, especially using the Procrustean critical and analytical tools we find scattered around the garage today (The ""Boring-ometer,"" or the ""Left-handed PC Gauge"") People who strongly dislike it seem to be of two camps: one is the sort of ADD group that can't handle long, slow movies with little visceral stimulation; it's a valid lifestyle for many but insufficient grounds for condemning anything*. The other camp consists of a type that's been with us since the cave man or woman discoverer of the wheel was given one star on Amazon.rock for creating a pointless spinning thing that made folks dizzy. There's no response available to complaints that a complex, advanced, or visionary work of art is ""boring,"" ""artsy,"" or ""pretentious."" The reviewer is writing--quite validly and no irony intended--to his or her equals and they should listen keenly. My dog, Alphonse, once reviewed a Beethoven symphony and described it as ""meaningless and annoying low-frequency noise with no hope of dinner or treat implied in its raucous ending"" and since that was published (in The New Yorker, no less!) no other dog has bothered to listen to the ""Eroica."" My cat hates paintings by Mondrian because the artist didn't leave enough texture on the canvas to sharpen ones nails on. The mice, however, love Pollock. To each according to their needs and abilities.

[* I recently suggested to the Turner folks that since colorizing worked so well to bring boring old black and white films to the attention of the easily distracted (Or ""Differently Attentive"" as the PC folks say), that we should, uh, ""stimulize"" slow-moving old films. This would involve say, adding footage of car crashes and explosions, maybe even a graphic decapitation to ""Twelve Angry Men"" or re-editing ""Jane Eyre"" so that it looked like an MTV video. We could easily digitally minimize clothing so that ""Miracle on 42nd Street"" could get an R rating and an audience. Just a thought]",1124582400,35,3338,4.944741532976827
503883,5,6302719666,"I believe Andrei Tarkovsky once mentioned that his films were meant to touch the soul, rather than the intellect. Indeed, the ""grand"" experience of his works have a way of drifting into your subconcious and stir something inside if only you let them. The feelings that are achieved can lead to meaningful discussions (and thus the intellect) about life and, in the case of Stalker, that elusive search for happiness that consumes our lives.

As is the case in all of Tarkovsky, 'Stalker' does not lend itself to virtually any of the cinema's plot convention, nor easy explanation, nor does it consider Box Office potential. In fact, it is a minor miracle that Tarkovsky was able to create films like this for over 20 years at all. He never found a wide audience in his native Russia, thriving only by independent means, and was eventually exiled. But back to the film:

The world outside of ""The Zone"" is captured in an eerie faded black and white tint that recalls the silent era. The two characters who search for happiness (The Professor and The Writer) are led blindly through the dangerous outer perimeters of the Zone, which is closely guarded by the military. Perhaps not coincidentally, it feels we are in the aftermath of nuclear haulocaust. Mysterious trains seem to float through the fog, like ghost ships. They carry weapons and supplies, but no one is ever shown getting on or off. The music is subtle and strange, and comes and goes as eerily as the trains.

When the characters finally enter the Zone, the screen fades into color to correspond to the ""sacredness"" and supposed ecstasy that this place promises. Tarkovsky often offers us an empty frame, a soft wind, as the characters drift through tall grass and trees, never quite sure what is around the next bend. The Stalker knows the place all too well, and knows that there are unseen traps that can spell death to the overconfident. The two other characters come to symbol our split conciousness: The Writer is brash and daring, always questioning what is ""right"" and never afraid to take risks to satisfy his curiousities; The Professor is quite and contemplative, content to go along with what is expected of him in order to come to a higher understanding (Though his true purpose becomes clear later on.)

It would take several more paragraphs to go into the details of Tarkovsky's meaning through the film (And, in fact, I'm sure there is much I have yet to understand.)

However, at it's center, this film is a meditation on the full meanings and complexities of happiness and the values of one's life. Toward the end, as the character return to the outside world, and the color fades back into blandness, there is a great moment of insight. Without giving it away, I'll just say that one of the most hopeful and moving moments captured on film occurs when the screen suddenly blazes with color once again at a moment of new awakening for one character. It justifies and reaffirms all that we have experienced along the way throughout this profound journey....",1120694400,15,3037,4.777142857142858

The first time I saw it, the experience was like a strange and beautiful dream. The second time (a year or so after the first), it was like coming home. The third time, the psychological and philosophical aspects spoke to me.

 Tarkovsky himself claimed that he aimed at making movies for the soul rather than the intellect, but he actually succeeds at doing both. He is not afraid of letting his protagonists engage each other in slow, ponderous conversations, not necessarily deep, but always deep-felt and full of emotion and life.

From another perspective, it plays out like a horrible examination of the barren borderlands between humanity, individuality and conformity.

Visually, the mythological power of the images surpasses anything I`ve ever seen. Apocalyptic.",1109030400,,890,5.0272108843537415
503947,5,6302719666,"I think that this is the best film I have ever watched, even I can exaggerate a bit: the only film I have ever watched.

If you like action films, where there is no aim of the film, but just a fight/thief story, as Holywood films, you would not like Stalker; even you maybe not understand even a scene. So, this film is not for holywoodians.

But, if you like psychology, the art, to understand real meaning of something, you love to think, in my opinion this is the best fim done ever.

What is this film about?

The stalker with his two friends (author and the professor) goes to a ""Zone"", which is surrounded by military units. There is no permission, but they can able to go there. All the film is the dialogue between them in that area, and there is a strong final.

Although the above paragraph is correct, the film is much much more than any paragraph can tell. First of all stalker is you, me, and every person in the world. There are two friends as Author and the Professor, which represents our emotional and realistic feelings/mind in our lives. And and and the Zone is the happiness/the meaning of life/the religion. As it is true in todays world, all of these 3 key items of life is surrounded by the obstacles. Every person knows that he/she should think about meaning of life, but he/she unconsciously delays it. Todays world is about money and power. Relative thinking is the biggest trap that human being fell into. Every person optimizes his/her happiness with respect to a few people nearby, which lacks the rationalism... etc. etc..

In the film, when they enter the zone, the gray colors of the objects, starts to be colored; the real meaining is seen and understood. And in that zone, Author (emotional side: the heart) makes emotional decisions, goes alone without listing to the mind... etc. etc. And the professor just makes the opposite.

In the zone, every action they took, every sentence they said, meant something, could be translated to heart/mind, emotional/rational dimensions of human being.

The film ends with a very very strong closing... The wife of the priest/stalker/human, tells the reality of human psychlogy in a few words,

and the girl of the stalker, plays the best closing of a film. Its like a summary in one sentence plus 2 minutes of action; The girl moves the glasses on the table with her eye (emotional) and drops the one which is the biggest but nothing inside (rational).

Isnt it true? If a person/organization/nation is big, but there is nothing inside, that persons/orgs/nations collapse is inevitible.. either in his/her period, or just after...

The Stalker (or life) is what you watch and what you get...

I recommend to everybody

I can't believe that people still go on about how his films are slow and pretentious, they just don't have a clue! None. Zero. How amazing Solonytsin is in this movie,I'm absolutely mesmerized by his perfomance!

503949,5,6302719666,"Like Solaris - to which this could form a neat earth-bound companion piece - Stalker turns sci-fi conventions on their heads by insisting that our reactions to an alien intelligence may be more interesting than the alien culture itself. But this is where Tarkovsky's insistence ends; his refusal to promote one fixed point of view leaves it up to the viewer to judge the merits of these reactions. It's his provocative ambilvalence which makes him maddening to some and challenging to others. If nothing else, his films provide an antidote to the almost Wagnerian bombast of Hollywood - even the most modest romantic comedy costs $30 mil plus these days, while Stalker looks as if it was made for 2 bob. But if going to see a big-budget blockbuster is like being strapped into a rollercoaster, watching Stalker is more akin to taking your mind and soul for a punishing session at the gym, followed by an eye-wateringly cold shower. Not your idea of fun? Then stay away.

Short on dialogue but long on ideas and lingering images, Stalker tells the story of a Stalker (directly if meaninglessly translated from the Russian) whose job involves smuggling people into 'the Zone' - site of an alien landing which has been sealed off by the military (the country, like the date, is non-specific leaving even more blanks to be filled in). Weary but still evangelical, he shepards a writer and a professor who are willing to risk their lives in order to find out what the Zone has to offer, and the majority of the film tracks their laborious progress. I don't think it would be giving too much away to say that they never quite find what they are looking for (it being Tarkovsky after all; thank God he died before the concept of 'closure' became common currency, his head would have exploded!). Indeed, this film was pitched at me as being about 'some guys who want to get to this place, and they don't know why they're going and they never get there'! To say that the journey is more important than the end point would be simplifying things a little, as well as ignoring the fact that they never quite reach an end-point. This allows the movie -and the ideas behind it - to live on in your mind long after the film ends...I sometimes catch myself thinking about the Zone at odd moments. And yes I do have a full time job and a family!

If you think this all seems a bit internal and philosophical, you'd only be half-right. There are startling moments of action and a major plot point involving that old dramatic stand-by, the cuckolded husband. Tarkovsky makes these moments co-exist with the weightier aspects without comment,and by the end you feel emotionally as well as intellectually involved. Some might say that he regarded emotions every bit as ridiculous as pompous philosophical musings, but I think the final scene -as ambiguous a closing shot as Solaris's - presents yet another aspect and stops the viewer from parsing Stalker and prescribing nihilism. As my friend who turned me on to it said, after watch you don't quite know what you've seen but you're a different person somehow.",1101772800,3,3091,4.711645101663586
503950,5,6302719666,"I keep returning to Stalker, actually the translation doesn't have such ominous overtones, it is simply closer to ""guide"" or ""one who knows"". We seem to be drawn to this (is it a film) it breaks the genre, or that is simply Tarkovski's visual language. Fear is the Factor here; what makes one travel to the Forbidden Zone?, this is a very Eastern concept, (that a ""place"" can be contaminated, places are usually reserved for the spirit,like nature) They say Russia had kept the barbarian hordes from the West and this has shaped its history giving it a function for better and worse. If it didn't have nuclear weapons, it would have been invaded, robbed by the free democracies long ago.

The Stalker himself is unsure,he wants intellectuals to have committment to humanity, simply to be what they say they are,and they are not; the word ""pravda"" is tossed about throughout the film. But the Writer and the Scientist are simply opportunists. The Scientist is going to the Zone to acquire power,or knowledge. Well that's why you go, but you could return, deformed relatively, (for we are already deformed.) Tarkovski it seems explores this ""grayness"",opaqueness; neither this nor that paradox I think.  The Scientist brought a kiloton bomb with him, to detroy the Zone? Perhaps Not! He was in the Room and phoned his equally opportunist colleague. I guess the phones work in the Zone, but the Flowers don't smell. And one needs to throw these white clothes with a stone enbedded in its head like a dart to see if it is safe to proceed.

The number of shots of the Human Head (turned away from frontal view) while the situation is one of movements/motions are incredible, as in the initial travel to the Zone where all we see is the Writer's Head, and all are on a railcar, we hear only the clickkedy clack of the rails, the pulse of motion. Not knowing where we are going, like traveling on a train with one's eyes closed. And again at the end the Stalker carries his daughter who is deformed without legs, we see only her head bobbling as she rides on the Stalker's shoulders. The price he paid for travelling to the Zone prior, his sperm is infected now.

The slow transformations of colour are also incredible from the darknesses of the opening brwons and greens, blacks and their shadows, to almost full colour. Tarkovski seems to create quite a filmic language with the various horizons is viewed(indoors and outdoors) of the neiboring towns, just enough to get a feel for the serenity that can be part of existence, or the corridors and alleyways in the opening half hour.

The overall grainy-ness of the film is a tension in and of itself, like something that cannot be resolved. Also the""junkspace"" of humanity is here before we called it junk, all the detritus of unsaved humanity floating in the contaminated waters of the Zone. We see all this slowly, gently like Mother Earth and all man;s creations do in fact mean something. A reverance/rememberance for the past is suggested.

The black dog that is found in the Zone and brought back was a nice touch of gentleness, our reverance for the non-human world, environmental ethics perhaps.",1101254400,2,3148,4.745886654478976

503952,5,6302719666,"Awful words told by the Stalker when he thinks in loud voice when he goes to the Zone .

This film is superb and unique ; vivid and powerful ; sinister and cerebral ; poetic and captivating ; stark and eerie.

Grinko and Solonitsin are the two sides of the coin ; science against humanism exchange its disagreement points of view when they decide to make the journey to the wasteland : the Zone .

The mysterious goes in crescendo till you will find its powerful meaning .

This movie runs slowly ; very slowly and it demands from you all the possible attention , the images run with dyonisiac and majestic flowness ; the visual metaphors are countless : the water as a freedom symbol runs before your eyes and are wonderful mesmerizing .

Stalker is a simple man ; a faith man who decides to carry all the people really interested to know the Zone . The riddle is a very complex puzzle ; but Tarkovsky gives you the clues , but beware with certain requisites you need .

Think for instance in The divine comedy and go to the hell journey ; that film has too many devices that run parallel to this concept . Remember the intense dialogue in the last circle of the hell when in his exhaustive seeking for Beatriz he is forced to see the face of a monster consuming men ; he will have to face the monster face to face and he will watch a sad face with tears in its eyes .

The Zone is a very special place ; there is a desire room which only will give you your most sincere desire ; and that premise is clearly hazardous ; because it is going to reveal your real nature and for many people who still scare to their inner demons is really better deny this challenging proposal .

The crudeness and the overwhelming message against the political opressing in those ages in the ancient USSR meant to Andrei Tarkovsky was exiled from his beloved country . You know ; the Politburo patient reached the limit and this collosal , giant , intelligent and artistic work crossed the forbidden red line. The art , intelligence and the talent have always been subversive in totalitarian regimes . And this was the last soviet opus of Tarkovsky, who was forced to live in Italy .

So think it about the powerful and brave message this film meant .

This is one of the giant films in any age ; because as any masterpiece its deep significance trascends its own time to inscribe in the highest artistic and cosmic levels.

A real triumph of the art .",1095033600,3,2433,4.325274725274725

I didn't.  While this film is about many things at once, I found on reflection that (at least to me) ""Stalker"" is essentially about the ethical/non-ethical nature of notions like hope, redemption.  The 'Zone' as it is termed is really a metaphor for what a human has to reach in his/her life to find metaphysical hope.  In the end, that hope is judged (by the most likeable character out of the three) to be invalid, even morally wrong.
The meditative shots of fields alternate with shots of decay, destruction, and a ""1984ish"" state.  These men remind one of some of Beckett's characters, behaving in absurd ways.

Stalkers are the only ones who can sense mysterious forces and avoid the dangers within the Zone.  Many courageous people come to the Zone with stalkers as guides on quests to fulfill their wishes.  In this film the audience is to follow three characters, Stalker, Writer, and Scientist, as they venture into the perilous Zone.  The party's venture becomes a breathtaking journey through armed guards, obscure traps, and  psychological horror.  The journey can symbolically be interpreted as a pilgrimage in order to restore ones faith and hope, which have been lost.

504026,5,6302719666,"This profound and mystical film covers space which is as much interior as it is exterior; a space of faith more and more impeded by the skepticism of the modern world, represented here by both the Writer and Professor. The Stalker, on the other hand, stands for an initiatory wisdom that still lives despite growing oppression and incomprehension. The movie begins with the dark and urban images of the profane condition, but they are gradually eclipsed by the vivid colors and textures of the Zone, which symbolize man's renewed proximity to the sacred. The knowledge one obtains in the Zone is quite unlike ordinary knowledge; one doesn't so much grasp it as one lives it. The characters' ritual journey has deep ties with what they really are, and thus the knowledge of the divine (or what goes beyond man) is inextricably linked to the knowledge of self. The Zone culminates in the Room, where miracle proper can take place; the Zone-Room couple is akin to the Temple-Sanctuary relationship that can be found in ancient mystery cults. In order to get the most out of the Zone, man must be animated by a true vocation (like the Stalker), and not only by ambition and curiosity (like the Writer and Professor); one must surrender to it rather than rationalize its subtle power. This can ultimately be said of Tarkovsky's film itself.",1081036800,2,1335,4.834061135371179

504028,5,6302719666,"Tarkovsky was filming Stalker for over a year when the film lab reported back that the entire negatives had all been destroyed during processing. Having no insurance Tarkovsky had to re-shoot most of the film again on a remaining shoe-string budget which restricted the production dramatically. He was forced to film Stalker without the vast sets that had since been taken down and headed for the fields in order to concentrate on a character driven science-fiction movie.
Stalker is bafflingly simple, but it is the story and characters that take this film to a new level. The premise is quite straightforward - a meteorite has crashed near a small town causing the Russian army to takeover the entire area. During their investigation they discover that the meteorite has caused some form of a psychological disturbance on all who enter The Zone. The Zone is sealed off but our main protagonist, Stalker, has been to The Zone more than once and acts as a tour guide for people who want to visit this strange and dangerous place. The film starts with Stalker disobeying his distraught wife in order to take two men - a writer and a scientist, to The Zone. The rest of the movie concentrates on their journey, spiritually, mentally and physically. There are some surprises in store at the end.
Stalker is like the metaphysics of the Matrix multiplied by ten. It is deeply philosophical in nature and haunting. The locations are beautiful and the camera is always where Tarkovsky wants it to be. Stalker can be a bleak film at times with many slow parts but it is still highly engaging and looks terrific. Not many directors can take three men, put them in a field and then using dialogue alone and a few puddles of water, turn it into an absolutely original sci-fi fest.... for that alone the film is a must see and deserves full marks.
Film students should definitely study this simple masterpiece.
***As a note the transfer is not the best and MPEG encoding does not work well with still shots. In fact DVD does not do Tarkovsky any justice. The film has also been digitally corrected and the start of the film in the bedroom looks terrible, but it does get a lot better after that. The extra are great!***",1069286400,15,2207,4.690721649484536
504029,5,6302719666,"That being said, I'm so overwhelmed by Tarkovsky's work that I don't really know where to begin - I'm not a cinema expert by any means, but I can't resist weighing in with my opinions here.  Rather than re-hash the narrative of the film, I think I'll just stick to some of my impressions...
Tarkovsky's use of color is astonishing - he switches from color to black-and-white in several of his films, for emphasis and mood, and very effectively.  The black-and-white sections of STALKER are actually sepia-toned - and the use of this device is perfect for underlining the bleakness (both physical and spiritual) of the cityscapes depicted.  He also uses it nicely in a dream sequence as the trio is on their way to the Room, journeying through the Zone.  The images of Stalker's dream - water flowing over hypodermic needles, religious icons, weapons, and other debris, all drained of color - are incredibly vivid, and symbolize (at least to me) the attempts of humans to numb themselves, to separate themselves from that which really matters - nature and the human spirit.  The voice-over - a woman or child - reading from the Book of Revelations is chilling as well.
There's a scene in which Stalker leaves his companions for a brief while and makes his way to a well - his soliloquy here can only be termed a prayer, in my opinion - `...Let everything that's been planned come true.  Let them believe.  And let them have a laugh at their passions - because what they call passion actually is not some emotional energy, but just the friction between their souls and the outside world.'  He goes on to speak of the nature of weakness and strength - `...let them be helpless like children, because weakness is a great thing and strength is nothing...Hardness and strength are Death's companions.  Pliancy and weakness are expressions of the freshness of being - because what has hardened will never win.'  This is, for me, one of the most moving scenes in the film - and one of the greatest expressions of the importance of faith and hope that I've ever seen in a film.  Tarkovsky placed great store in hope - it's an idea that surfaces in many of his works.
For the viewer unfamiliar with Tarkovsky's work, STALKER might actually be a good place to start - the non-linear method he used in some of his other works might be a little discouraging for some.  Once the viewer becomes acquainted with the stylistic genius of this master, however, ALL of his films will offer up revelations and rewards.",1062547200,2,2497,4.675799086757991
504030,5,6302719666,"This movie if watched with an open heart can truly 'harrow your soul' as Tarkovsky puts it.
It did so for me and provided a tremendous soul-searching shock that changed the direction of my life. If there has ever been a metanoic religious work of art in cinema this is it.",1060732800,2,272,4.352941176470588

Your life might just be changed forever.",1056326400,,433,4.7105263157894735
504033,2,6302719666,"Problem number one is that Tarkovsky's script is very wooden. In this film, characters with allegorical names like Writer and Scientist are liable to sit down while under threat of machine-gun fire and say ""How can I know what to call that which I want? How can I be certain that that which I want is really that which I want, and that I do not want that which I do not want?"" or gaze gloomily on a sand dune and say ""This is all someone's foolish invention, and you all want to find out whose. But whose conscience will ache from your discovery?"" or assert that ""There is no Bermuda Triangle. There is a triangle A-B-C which is congruent to a triangle A'-B'-C'."" This film is like that for most of its two and a half hours.
Problem number two is that the symbolism used by Tarkovsky very frequently has no emotional effect. Consider, for example, the scene in which Writer takes a crown of thorns which conveniently happened to be lying on the floor of the room he was in, says ""I will not forgive you,"" and puts it on his head. First, this is too blatant, too dependent on the reference, to produce a great emotional reaction in the viewer. Second, the cynical, occasionally vulgar Writer is in no way like Christ. Nor is he that great an opposite of Christ, since he isn't particularly evil or demonic, either. The figure of Christ is irrelevant to his character, so the comparison can't really be made literally or ironically. Why, then, show him as Christ?
Several times in this film, Tarkovsky shows a body of water with various objects floating in it. These include guns, books and religious icons. Now, Tarkovsky always liked to fill space with objects in order to induce a sort of organic or realistic atmosphere. For example, in his film Solaris, he filled the rooms of the cosmonauts with books, vases, ashes, and other objects. But in that film, it served to make the cosmonauts seem more like people, to give them outside interests, to maybe show their intellectual lives a little. Putting icons, books and guns into a river, on the other hand, accomplishes no such thing. Similarly gratuitous and unexplained is the image of Stalker throwing bolts tied to bandages in order to find the ""correct"" path through the ZONE. Regarding this, I recall an unintentionally funny quote said by some intellectual while viewing those scenes - ""That's _exactly_ what life is like in the Soviet Union!"" Indubitably!
Another thing Tarkovsky likes to do is quote things. Here, passages are read out of the Bible, and poetry is quoted on two occasions. The problem is that scenes from the Apocalypse don't seem too relevant to the rest stop of the film's characters in a peaceful landscape. But even when these quotes are applicable to the situation depicted on the screen, they don't work - for example, a passionate love poem, designed to show the love Stalker's wife feels for her husband, is recited in a completely flat, droning monotone, devoid of feeling or even volume, that saps it of absolutely all of its vitality and fire and makes it tedious to listen to.
Problem number three is the central philosophical conceit. Tarkovsky's big films (Andrei Rublev, Solaris and Stalker) are united in their borderline contempt of science and love of religion. The underlying message eventually comes down to the notion that one has to believe in god because otherwise one will never find happiness or achieve self-actualization. Of the three films, however, Stalker is by far the preachiest. Those who believed the talk about Stalker being a ""science-fiction epic"" should beware, since the science-fiction framework is used primarily to create analogies to religion. Here, god is represented by the magical Room at the heart of the Eden-like ZONE, from which people have been expelled. Writer and Scientist are the two unbelievers, whose lives are naturally vapid and meaningless due to their lack of belief. Scientist, as expected, is the worse of the two - he goes to the ZONE out of a desire to exact petty vengeance on a colleague, and wishes to destroy the ZONE - but both are fairly disagreeable. Stalker is the holy fool who believes in the magical powers of the Room and has a purpose in life. The unbelievers preach their nihilistic atheism to him, claiming that there is really no ZONE or Room, and depart to finish their meaningless and vapid lives. Stalker is filled with righteous anger at their lack of faith. Then the director steps in and shows Stalker's invalid daughter moving objects using telekinesis, thus showing that the ZONE is not a fiction after all. So Stalker is proven right and everyone else is proven wrong, because Tarkovsky said so. The debate is thus reduced to asking if there is a god with the premise that there is, and asking if one should believe in god with the premise that one will be unhappy and bitter if one does not. Well, then.
To say the characters are unsympathetic is to miss the point, since the characters as people are unimportant - they are allegorical constructs used to advance the central philosophical conceit. Those who already adhere to this conceit will probably find something to like about this film, although I don't know if all of them will like sitting through all of it. Serious cinema scholars will doubtless have to see it once, due to the reputation Tarkovsky's work has accrued, but by doing so, they will be heading down a road where entertainment is the enemy, sermons fill the air, and accessibility lies dead on the wayside. I won't deride this film by calling it ""pointless,"" because Tarkovsky clearly had a point in mind, but I honestly do not see how it can be called a masterwork.",1054425600,28,5655,4.742131979695431

504095,5,6302719666,"Mindwalk / Dinner with Andre / Stalker Philosophical Trilogy
Other's have reviewed these movies quite well on their own so I will rather review these 3 as a trilogy because I feel that they are each interconnected in a profound way.
Watch in the following order for these reasons.
1) Mindwalk is more contemporary and accessible I think for most people.
Mindwalk is pretty much a stylistic copy off of Stalker except it has Fritjof Capra's views  on the new quantum paradigm replacing the deep conversations in Stalker. So you don't want to view these two back-to-back.
2) My Dinner w/ Andre is certainly a classic, it will always do you some good to see it, especially when bookended by these other two. It sheds insight into the current human condition of ""robotism"" (to quote E.Fromm).  Where Mindwalk works at the surface on an abstract global level Andre works on the intra-personal level. The dialogue focuses on examples of centered around the concept of our personal ""work"" and dips into mystical acts all the while questioning... how can we be more ""alive""? One can envisions Gudreiff and Ouspensky having this same conversation 50 years prior.
At times it's loops back into Mindwalk realm towards the end.
Aside, when I watch this movie I wonder sometimes if this is where Seinfeld got the idea for his show... people just sitting around the coffee shop having discussion, a parody of our robotic natures.
3) When I first saw Stalker I thought... ""I've been waiting my whole life to see this movie"" and I still feel that way on each subsequent viewing. Stalker then moves the viewer into the transcendental levels of questioning, Of note is it's deep visual metaphors.
When you see the final scene of Stalker you will understand what the true transcendental potential of all the discourse and dialog which you have been privy to for 7 hours is all about.
Aside:  Of sad and ironic note, the very radiations which were described in Mindwalk were the cause of Tarkovsky's  early demise after filming this movie in a Soviet radioactive wasteland.
There are no easy answers with these movies and perhaps they bring up more questions than you'd like but if you are up for a good brain-enema these will do the trick.
Oh... you might as well top it all of with a viewing of ""Mulholand Drive""... you might just understand it after viewing these other 3 films. ;)",1053820800,2,2364,4.758536585365854

I have never experienced so many beautiful images, nor had my brains scrambled by so many profound ideas, and all in one film. It is slow moving. It does not need to go faster. All the ideas, arguments and philosophizing done by the characters keeps the film moving at the pace it needs to go at.
A ""ZONE"" has formed, no one knows how. Stalkers are people who can get you in and out of the ZONE without getting killed. People visit the ZONE because there is a room wherein your most heartfelt desire will come true.
This is a science fiction film that needs no special effects, and no particularly special sets to make you believe that it is a science fiction film. The three main characters do a wonderful job of convincing you how otherworldly their experiences are.

A note to the previous reviewer who claims the Dolby 5.1 remix is superior.  Yes, the mono mix does leave out some gunshots as they enter the train car near the beginning, but that is the only dropout.  Everything the 5.1 mix has that the mono mix lacks is stuff that was added to the film later...  There are scenes that are supposed to be silent to which ambient noise has been added.  A sound effect that I consider iconic to the film (the sound of a train travelling over tracks) has been removed and replaced with a very different, and far less effective sound.  The bit of music utilizing Beethoven's 9th Symphony underlying the train noise has been drastically altered; the whole point of it was that the symphony is being covered up by the industrial sounds, sort of smothered.  But in the new 5.1 mix, both the industrial sounds and the symphony come through loud and clear.

504101,5,6302719666,"Tarkovsky is by far my favorite director. Stalker was the first film I saw, and the experience was so memorable that I went on and saw all his other films. Many people have compared it to Stanley Kubrick's ""2001, a space odyssey"". I beg to differ. While Kubrick's film was also a masterpiece in its own respect, it was not delivering a spiritual and metaphysical message like Stalker. Many viewers tend to criticize Stalker for lack of so-called ""action"". In his book, ""Sculpting through time"", Tarkovsky explicitly states that this was indeed what he intended to do. This is about a journey to our inner soul, this side of us that is our most intimate and yet at the same time our most frightening. The Writer is of course our artistic side while the Professor would represent our logical and scientific leanings. Both of these men seem despaired because of lack of faith, only to be redeemed at the end. However, while many would believe that this film seems to give a pessimistic message about the human condition, it actually gives hope. Indeed, we can be redeemed, and that is through love and sacrifice personified by the Stalker's wife.
Now, for the visual aspects of this film. Every shot is a masterpiece, a work of art. The language and the dialogue are all beautiful and poetic.
All in all, Stalker is a philosophical masterpiece, a gem in the world of cinema.",1045094400,31,1371,4.6929460580912865
504102,5,6302719666,"The first Tarkovsky movie I ever saw, this left an instantaneous and indelible impression on me.  Set in an apparently rather totalitarian, and Sovietly grim future, the film follows two men (a writer and a scientist) on their trek, guided by a stalker, into the Zone, at the center of which is said to be a room where one's wishes come true.  Anyone familiar with the novella by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky (they wrote the screenplay as well) will be struck by how different the two are.

Tarkovsky denies that there is any symbolism in his films. If that is the case, then it is not a subtext of spirituality that I get from this film, but an open announcement of it. Because what most makes this film really not science fiction in the final analysis is its deeply felt spirituality. (Not that science and spirituality are mutually antagonistic, but that's a separate issue.)  The stalker, played by Alexander Kaidonovsky, is genuinely heart-breaking in his simplicity and openness, compared to the intellectuality and cynicism of the two men who accompany him.  And the speculations the two educated men engage in are more purely philosophical than inherently science fictional in nature. (Not that science fiction and philosophy are mutually antagonistic either.)

What most makes the film, though, is its intense surreality and the cinematography that makes it possible.  If you are not already familiar with the achingly slow cinematography Tarkovsky loves to employ, then the sense of suspense that this film can drum up in you will be amazing.  Tarkovsky loves to plant the camera on a physical object, and then make you look at it until you have no choice but to decide you're missing something, that more must be there. Thus Tarkovsky inspires you to look at the world in a visionary way so that even the most banal objects start to take on an ominous significance.  Elsewhere, Tarkovsky unnerves you by having his characters keep looking over their shoulders while the camera creeps up on them with murderous intent from an off-angle.

In the novella, the Zone itself is a place where the laws of physics are broken, bent or simply no longer apply.  As such, one cannot approach the Room directly (even though it is just across a field), but must approach with respect by going the long way around.  Tarkovsky encodes this ""non-Euclidean"" reality of the Zone in several ways, but one shot in particular is breathtakingly brilliant and beautiful. The Stalker lies in a stream of water, and the camera then pans in a straight line, treating us to a phenomenally gorgeous still life of submerged objects, when suddenly the stalker comes back into view.  Apparently we've somehow gone in a circle, though it seemed the line of vision was constantly straight.  The way that this is blatantly startling is matched by innumerable other details throughout the film, as Tarkovsky ruthlessly and subtly tweaks things to keep the suspense constantly high.  Tarkovsky will even change grains of film stock in order to unsettle what you are looking at.

Certainly one of the most moving and gorgeous ""science fiction"" movies ever, it is also a meditation on the nature of human responsibility and remorse.  Personally, I find the Stalker to be the most affectingly drawn of all of Tarkovsky's protagonists, perhaps because he is the one who most openly gives voice to Tarkovsky's own intense spirituality.",1042934400,6,3403,4.942105263157894

Stalker should definitely be in 4:3 (and I speak as a former repertory cinema manager).  Anyone claiming to have seen it in widescreen will have seen it projected incorrectly, possibly at one of the many cinemas that can no longer show this aspect ratio.",1039046400,22,644,4.649122807017544
504104,5,6302719666,"This 1979 Andrei Tarkovsky film, a favorite among his fans, is all philosophy in a story of three men searching for meaning in their lives in a hellish environment. Truth, motive, art, meaning, purpose, reason, selfishness, hope, soul, belief, are all examined here. The story focusses on three men. They are called Stalker, Professor and Writer. The Professor and Writer have hired the Stalker to take them to the guarded Zone, where mysterious hidden forces influence the area. In the heart of the Zone is a room, where any wish will be granted. The three men, have to overcome various physical, mental, and social problems among themselves to reach the room. They discuss, debate, and reflect on their world and situation, and philosophize on the room, and the mysterious forces in the world, and their place in it. What will this journey hold for them, and the room, waiting, offer to them? What do they really wish for, and what will it mean to the rest of mankind? And why does the Stalker bring others to the room, but he does not enter?
So many questions are raised in this interesting sci-fi analysis of human existence. The film is long and slow, but nevertheless, the ideas are fascinating, and are a real treat to see laid out masterfully by Tarkovsky, in images, words, and music, within an entertaining story. The film is emotional, and as in other Tarkovsky's films, he creates an experience in you, and warps your views of the world, and offers so much more than mainstream films give after viewing. If you look for films that will offer more than just a two hour cheap thrill ride and then never thought of again; a real beautiful, and meditative journey, that includes you along, and inspires you to look around and beyond life, so memorable, and intelligent then you really should see this film any way you can.

504149,5,6302719666,"I first saw ""Stalker"" nearly 20 years ago with a bunch of friends. The video was a little grainy and no one in the room had the slightest idea what the movie was about, except that it was a Russian film. Within the first 20 mins of the film, most of my friends had drifted to start a poker game, showing little or no interest on what was happening on screen, except for two of us, who were mesmerized with the film, admiring not only the visuals, which were stark and devoid of cinematic effects, but also the ideas that were being exchanged by the film's three central characters - the ""Stalker"", the Writer and the Professor. Just based on this one incident, this is a movie that demands a certain level of introspection as well as acute concentration and involvement, especially to understand where Tarkovsky is leading the viewer and his deep philosophical expositions through his characters on the ultimate fate of ""humankind"". There is a certain statement in the film on the ultimate use of technology, its limitations and its inability to ultimately create something of lasting value. As one of its characters [ ""Writer""] explains, technology has served mankind as a kind of ""crutch"" or artifical prop, but with no lasting value, from an artistic or creative point of view. Also, in the ""Zone"", a mysterious place that seems innocuous visually and presents life amidst decay and detritus [human detritus, left behind by man, ranging from burnt out tanks in green fields to a syringe ], nothing is certain, nothing is ""straight"" and there's no logic to be found here. Only the ""Stalker"" knows his way around the Zone and not by any knowledge of the terrain or his prior forays into the Zone but an immediate, real time assessment of his own state of mind, his internal communication with the mysterious forces acting in the Zone. The ""ultimate"" room is a mental construct of sorts and is actually a dreadful place ultimately for most people, although it supposedly grants people their innermost wishes. In a simplistic way, this is the ""Holy Grail"" for most people, a place where they can get their most secret desires and wishes granted. However, the interesting question being posed here is - does anyone really know or is anyone really interested in having their innermost desires or wishes granted. There is a certain dark truth here that most individuals would actually be better off if such a place did not exist and their innermost desires may actually not be what they are really wishing for. Human beings are complex, selfish and ultimately, self-serving. It is impossible for Tarkovsky to comprehend that any one person can be totally unselfish in his desires. That is his view and I would tend to agree. People are ultimately going to act in their own interests, or in the interests of their family or other things that they are concerned with. No one is going to act for humankind, an altruistic view that has no basis in reality. Witness the Stalker's story in this regard regarding a character called ""Porcupine"", another stalker who killed his brother. He enters the Zone hoping to restore a life and ease his anguish and guilt by entering the mysterious room and asking for his wish to be granted. And what was this wish, you may well ask ? Why , to restore his brother to life and good health and assuage his feelings, bring him peace. Or, to just wipe away the guilt. However, the Zone recognized the real scoundrel that he really was and granted him his innermost, secret desire -... Moral of the story - do you really, really, want to know your innermost desires ? This assumes that in the first place, is anyone really capable of articulating his/her innermost desires ? People are shallow individuals, focused on their own interests and live on the surface. I'm not too sure that anyone can ""know"" what their innermost desires are ?

In these simple things lie the meaning of the human condition. The charcters wander in a Zone that is a metaphore of their ravaged souls. Silence, decay, rain. Yet, in this film there is hope, never ending and one that will always endure. Tarkovsky shows us the Russian soul in a way that only his Andire Rublyov equals",1023062400,4,490,4.336956521739131
504152,2,6302719666,"Much as I love Tarkovsky, and I deeply love three of his movies, I really hate this one. It is boring and silly. In fact it could well lay claim to be the most boring film ever made. The script is nothing much and the usual device of poems seems forced this time. First cringe is the transition from sepia to colour upon entering the zone thus conjuring unfavourable comparisans to 'The Wizard Of Oz'. Unfortunately, the Stalker's wife does not enliven the proceedings with her version of 'Over The Rainbow', deciding instead to roll around the floor of her hovel with belly ache. Originally, the producers of 'Oz' left out that song because they didn't want to delay Dorothy's journey. In 'Stalker' they don't much care if the protagonists are held up or if they don't move at all, so a song might have been nice. Actually, some Can-Can dancers would have been especially welcome.
Once in the zone, our three cheerful chums do pretty much what we all did around derelict building sites and forests as a kid, which is to bicker, roll around on the floor and chuck metal objects at each other. Thanks for the nostalgia trip. Well, maybe not. Someone chucks something into a steel well. Plink. Remember that too? They find a skeleton and this reminds me of an amusing production anecdote in which a newly arrived crew member on the set either sat on, or placed something on the skeleton, squashing it. The budget didn't extend to making a new skeleton so the poor crew member was dispatched to the railway station, presumably for a very drawn out and excrutiatingly boring wait for a rural train. Tarkovsky later relented however, true humanitarian that he was. Actually, it's not that amusing an anecdote, I'm just worried this review is getting boring. Which it is. So to make things even more boring we only get to see half a skeleton because of the damage. Pity, they could have tied some string to the original and had it do Stanislavski's greatest hits, or failing that, the Can-Can.
Tarkovsky railed against the lack of sacrifice people were willing to make in today's materialist culture but the long walk through the catacombs of the building betrays an almost priggish sadism, especially as the writer doing the walking then sits down for ten minutes and whinges about his publishers. Then in one of many naff moments, the writer wears a crown of thorns presumably because he doesn't want to be beaten by the Stalker in a 'Baldest on Building Site' competition. Sadly this man has the unfortunate distinction of being the least disappearing visitor to the zone, thus, to our ultimate existential horror, returning to the outside world to bore some more.
The one saving grace is the intriguing and beautifully shot ending which bumps up some much needed stars for the film.
Incredibly, 'Stalker' was a remake, the original version allegedly spoiled by obstructive lab technicians. Or could it be that God was trying to tell you something, Andrei? After all, if he'd put us on the earth to be bored out of our minds, would he have given us Formula One racing driving? Actually, I can't stand that either, bad example.
On a sadder note, it was speculated that this film caused Tarkovsky and some of the crew to suffer an early demise from cancer because of the Communist block's disastrous environmental policies concerning industrial waste of which 'The Zone' was an alleged dumping ground.",1021334400,7,3396,4.7772108843537415
504153,5,6302719666,"Stalker is an extraordinary film, but what is it all about? A writer and a scientist meet the stalker in a shabby, decaying bar. Afterwards they board a makeshift rail trolley and travel deep into the Zone to the strange room that grants any wisher their innermost wish. And who can forget the flowing pool with it's coins and artwork and detritus of civilization? Later, there's the ending with the spectral black canine prowling about silently and the stalker's child is moving objects across a table by telekinesis.
  The great director himself offers something of an explanation which can be found in ""Sculpting In Time"", a collection of his film writings (which are often rigid and lapse into Soviet locutions -- (but hey, those were the times he was living in, when the Kremlin mindf**cked everybody, and a director was lucky if he or she even had the opportunity to open a film cannister, much less make a film).

  Tarkovsky writes: ""What, then, is the main theme that had to sound through Stalker? In the most general terms, it is the theme of human dignity; of what that dignity is; and of how a man suffers if he has no self-respect...Let me remind the reader that when the characters in the film set out on their journey into the Zone, their destination is a certain room in which, we are told, everybody's most secret wish will be granted. And while the Writer and the Scientist, led by Stalker, are making their hazardous way over the strange expanse of the Zone, their guide tells them at one point either a true story or a legend, about another Stalker, nicknamed Diko-obraz. He had gone to the secret place in order to ask for his brother, who had been killed through his fault, to be brought back to life. When Diko-obraz returned home, however, he discovered that he had becom fabulously wealthy. The Zone had granted what was in reality his most heartfelt desire, and not the wish that he had wanted to imagine was most precious to him. And Diko-obraz had hanged himself.""

  In another part of the book, ""Sculpting in Time"", Tarkovsky offers a portrayal and purpose of the Stalker. Tarkovsky writes:
""Looking back now at the films I have made so far, it strikes me that I have always wanted to tell of people possessed of inner freedom despite being surrounded by others who are inwardly dependent and unfree; whose apparent weakness is born of moral conviction and a moral standpoint and in fact is a sign of strength....The Stalker seems to be weak, but essentially it is he who is imvincible because of his faith and his will to serve others. Ultimately artists work at their profession not for the sake of telling someone about something, but an assertion of their will to serve people. I am staggered by artists who assume that they freely create themselves, that it is actually possible to do so; for it is the lot of the artist to accept that he is created by his time and the people amongst whom he lives.""",1019606400,10,2935,4.630769230769231

A loose adaptation of the novel ROADSIDE PICNIC by the brothers Boris & Arkady Strugatsky, this film is every bit as rewarding an experience to watch as that novel is to read. The film concerns the adventure of a ""stalker"", a guide who leads a team of illegal curiosity seekers through ""the Zone"", an area tainted physically and, perhaps, spiritually by the brief presence of extra-terrestrials who stopped there in their journey. Impressively, THE STALKER achieves its power completely through dialog and direction, without benefit of any kind of visual special effects (beyond those of the director and camerman).

504206,5,6302719666,"When I slipped Andrei Tarkovsky's ""Stalker"" into my VCR I just layed back, openned up a bag of chips, and began contemplating the useless, insignificant quote left by some small time critic on the box: 'this film is the Slavic equvilant to David Lynch's ""Eraserhead"" (Who like that's a good comparison).'
But then, instead of turning out like some third-rate American make-no-sense paranoia noir, Tarkovsky's achievment is so ingenious, so visual, so relative, and so downright different that I was just blown away.
The film begins in stark black, white and brown colors. The look is so bleak that it looks faded and unfocused. Tarkovsky introduces us to a man desperate for color and beauty in a society that depraves him of such things. The smoke, rain and mud seem to forbid him to leave his home just as much as his own wife does. With this scene alone Tarkovsky has painted a finer picture of communist Russia than every film combined that has ever tried to capture the country's atmosphere and spirit (I'm largely speaking of American movies).
I could go on and on about this film, but I can't. I can't describe what you see, feel, and how it purminates in the mind. It goes so beyond anything that English or American 'Ambitious' epic films present. Films like ""Apocalyse Now"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" have a surface, but rarely a living indivualized heart underneath.
This is my first Tarkovsky film, and after watching just one, I have contemplated he is just as brilliant and highly cinema-vocabularic as Bergman, Godard, Ozu and Herzog (at his prime). After witnessing Tarkovsky's work, I have a newfound interest in Russian Cinema, and a newfound interest in Russia in general.
Watch this film, or any other Tarkovsky masterpieces, and I garuantee that the bag of chips will be just as untouched come the end as it was at the beginning.",1001462400,23,1848,4.832807570977918
504207,5,6302719666,"Despite the setting and the idea of the mysterious zone where your wishes come true and to which natural-born guides, Stalkers, can take people, the film has little to do with science fiction. It is a metaphoric tale about people frightened by their own choice of destiny; the style is as un-Russian as a film can get. Understatement is the word; you will not see overblown emotion or people making dramatic statements every step of their way. It is amazing that, ideologically, the director got away with the pictures of barbed wire and dereliction which looked distinctly like home to viewers in the Soviet Union. It is unbelievable that censors went so easy on a film with so many hidden meanings and without a clear-cut politically correct message. The film benefits from Kaydanovsky's very strong acting, it does not feel very long at all and flows beautifully. The tiny role of Stalker's wife, played by Alisa Freindlikh, a prominent Russian actress, is one of her best.
Unfortunately, VHS version does not do justice to supremely soft, understated and subtle picture and cameraman's work. This is best revealed in cinema viewing. Nevertheless, definitely top-notch work. You will be glad you bought this film.",998611200,2,1216,5.024752475247524
504208,3,6302719666,"The very fact that this film has inspired so many thoughtful and well-written reviews shows that it definitely has a lot to offer. I'm a little disturbed by the frequently repeated claim that those who find Stalker too slow must be unable to tolerate anything but the likes of Top Gun, etc.  While I agree that Stalker has moments of stunning ""visual poetry"" (e.g., the scene where the three men lie upon the ground, resting and meditating, is among the most arresting and haunting moments I've encountered, in film), I find the overall pace almost unbearably slow.  After all, isn't the ability to edit visual pacing one of the most powerful assets of cinema?  It might be worth considering that, just as no composer would dare to challenge the audience with three hours of unrelieved largo (even in Indian classical music, where audiences are accustomed to much longer performances than in the west, a slow alap rarely lasts more than an hour), varied pacing is, or can be, a director's best asset.  Tarkovsky merely plods, through this film, though I do understand why some viewers choose to justify this as a meditation.
Ok then, it's a meditation. . . .  I only wish, then, that the exposition weren't so flawed.  Case in point:  the stalker's wife throws herself upon the floor in agony at his departure near the beginning of the film, only to speak directly and smilingly to the camera, in the end, saying that she loves and accepts him as he is, and wouldn't have him any other way.  Likewise, I find the  Writer and Scientist hopelessly inconsistent and muddled, as characters, even as I imagine that some viewers will want to say that this is appropriate to their not being able to identify their own innermost wish, in the end.  I accept that this sort of thing clearly works for some, but it just doesn't do it for me.  Overall, I quite like Zizek's brief assessment in The Fright of Real Tears, where he talks about Tarkovsky's ideological murkiness being redeemed by his ability to interconnect the fate of the human spirit with that of the earth, by capturing the latter's ""dank materiality.""
Overall, the film is well worth watching, if only because it's so provocative, but due to its plodding pace and muddled exposition, it will remain but the intimation of a masterwork for me.  (I was tempted to give the film four stars, since Tarkovsky at least dares so much . . . my actual rating would be something like 3.5, on the Amazon scale.)",997920000,15,2455,4.683720930232558
504209,5,6302719666,"I'm not familiar with Tarkovsky's beliefs or writings but this film still blew me away.  It's fairly slow moving, it's long and it's in Russian.  Normally that description makes for a waste of 3 hours but not in this case.  Instead 'Stalker' is a profound, intelligent, beautiful, interesting journey that hypnotizes you for the entire length.  This film had about 3 or 4 shots that are probably the most beautiful visual moments I've ever experienced.  It was like watching a painting come to life.  Another interesting thing about this film was despite the lack of special effects the mere discussion of 'sci-fi' related ideas kept you interested.  Due to my ignorance of Tarkovsky's other works I'm most likely not appreciating this on as many levels as I should.  Regardless I was enthralled.",994809600,9,796,4.9772727272727275
504210,5,6302719666,"The question is possibly Why did Tarkovsky turn to science fiction? Just possibly. Maybe there's an answer in the diaries, or Sculpting in Time. Maybe memory, as we think about it, or as the modernists thought about it, evokes images of the time machine. Cinema is a time machine, certainly. Whatever the reason, that Stalker or Solaris even fare as science fiction is astonishing, or preposterous, depending on the way you look at it. And it is probably witless to discuss ""painting"" in a Tarkovsky film at this point, but there you have it. It's painting. Or analagous to painting. Or the films maintain a relation to painting that is more or less consistent. The films are meditative, Stalker especially. The films persist. There are people who walk out on Tarkovsky films, at Cannes the year Nostalghia showed lots of folks walked out. ""If I wanted to watch rain fall on bottles, I'll peek out the window,"" etc. In such an atmosphere narrative doesn't matter. The films aren't narrative. Not in a real way. Mirror is about the impossiblity of sustaining narrative. Stalker seems to have a story, and maybe that seeming is the important thing, but the story disappears, constantly, the images wipe it out. Just the focus on images seems to reabsorb the story. Or something. Like the ""driving"" passage in Solaris that flicks between color and black and white, pointless, absorbant, yet saying, at the same time, something about the nature of transit, standing in as it does for the rocket's blast off, saying something also about the monotony of travel, about highways and overpasses and other cars and their drivers, about blinking signals and the sounds you hear, on the road, with their rhythms, pure rhythms, about pylons, and colors, and the portions of people you see, or don't see, it's more or less about the fragments of life you're passing, and the danger of being on the road, but it's also, in the last of things, about the passage of film through the camera, as well as the projector, the medium comments on itself, saying something about the deathly monotony of it all, transit, certainly, travel, yes, all of it, including film, and taking pictures, there's a meditative, but also certainly exhausted feeling one can have while watching Tarkovsky, which is why those folks walked out (because you can), but there is also an exultant feeling, I don't know. This delirium that's present in the films is an ecstasy of absorption in the image, in the dream image, something authentic, in the image far removed from a capitalist use of nearly the same thing, the face of the star or starlet. The films are structured by their own mysterious, completely internal laws, Stalker most of all. There is something happening in Tarkovsky and Stalker that simply doesn't happen elsewhere, the films exist at the furthest possible reaches of cinema, just as In Search of Lost Time exists at the furthest possible reaches of the novel.

And that's not just a cynical remark -- it really is. The same way that 'The Joy of Painting' is pleasant to fall asleep to; or the Japanese film 'Gate of Hell.' But those are far preferable to Tarkovsky's 'Stalker' when all is said and done.
A ""visual poem""? Perhaps. But what's it worth? Go outside, look around: there are visual poems everywhere. The only thing differentiating Tarkovsky's film from, say, me standing around looking at meadows and run-down buildings, is that Tarkovsky's film comes with a pretentious air of self-importance, and three relatively annoying characters who occasionally wax oblique and try to sound deep.
It's not that I don't ""get it"" -- (although it is a bit of a struggle due to the general atmosphere of weird artsy-fartsiness.) It's supposed to be metaphorical. It's supposed to be contemplative and slow-moving. It isn't supposed to be a science fiction thriller (which the back of the box unfortunately makes it sound like.) And it's not that I'm utterly against slow-moving, metaphorical films. I liked Kurosawa's 'Dreams,' preachy as it was. And Kobayashi's 'Kwaidan.' And to a lesser extent the aforementioned 'Gate of Hell.' Though the last two are admittedly not really ""metaphorical"" in the sense that 'Stalker' is, all of them are very slow-moving, aesthetically spacious foreign movies that have a definite feel of ""visual poetry"" to them.
The problem is that Tarkovsky is just flat-out boring and depressing. I can handle a degree of pretention if I feel there's some real flare and aesthetic power to the work in question. But Tarkovsky doesn't make the cut. What he gives us with 'Stalker' is a four-hour exercise in cinematographic (word?) masturbation, peppered with vague dialogue and a silly, throw-away outline of an actual story.
Those who find 'Stalker' engaging or inspirationl must, in my opinion, REALLY be digging hard, doing Tarkovsky's work for him. I don't mind a film which requires some degree of imagination on the viewer's part, but there's nothing about Tarkovsky's work that makes me want to spend time with it in that way.
Dull, pretentious, and silly. One or two vaguely thought-provoking lines can't save a four-hour film. The fact that someone compared this to the Brothers Karamazov makes me slightly ill.

504267,5,6302719666,"Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker is another one of those movies with a bipolar disorder; You either love it or hate it.  Having said this, I must admit that I loved the movie.  So be forewarned.  This is another review by an enthusiast.  Stalker improves upon recollection and has a fascination that one cannot readily explain.
The stalker leads others into a mysterious and forbidden zone that is heavily protected by a police state.  Was the zone caused by a meteorite?  We do not know.  We do know that many have entered the zone never to return.  And we also know that in the twenty some years since the meteorite fell, a legend has grown up that there exists within the zone a room where one's innermost wish may be granted.  The calling of the stalker, who has faith in the legend, is to lead others past the police guards and through the labyrinthine zone to the room.
The action begins when a writer and a physicist meet together with the stalker in a dreary bar.  Everything is wet and slippery here, as it is through most of the movie.  Curiously, the images change from sepia to color as we enter the zone.  As the stalker explains the mysteries to us we know that we are not in Kansas anymore.  In the decidely un-cartesian zone one never traverses the shortest distance between two points.  An indirect approach is always best.  Only the stalker can divine the way, which is confused beyond words.
It is an understatement to say that the scenes are disquieting.  The zone is strewn with syringes, silt, and debris of all kinds.  Everything seems to be wet, including the visitors. But they don't mind.  They are engaged in philosophical-religious speculation!  For shame to think of personal comfort when larger issues are at stake.
It is remarkable that in 1980 Tarkovsky created a film about a dangerous zone strewn with debris, where children of frequent visitors have deformed children.  I cannot escape the conclusion that this film artistically predicted Chernobyl.
In many ways the zone is like life (where sometimes progress is simple and other times it is confused beyond words).  In other ways it is like death.  But it is not all gloom and doom. The Stalker is, in his original way, beatific.  Through the prayerful monologue of the stalker Tarkovsky accomplishes the transcendent moments characteristic of all of his films.  The stalker's faith is reminiscent of the cargo cults of the South Pacific.  That the object of his faith is pathetic makes it no less sincere.
The unnamed ""writer"" and ""professor"" are profoundly different individuals whose only common experience seems to be suffering.  But the quality of their suffering is different.  Our ""writer"" has specialized in a kind of suffering that contaminates all who come within the orbit of his wit.  The professor has suffered alone, in intellectual isolation.  The stalker has suffered as well, but he has sacrificed his suffering and has attained an acceptance of life through faith.  It is a fragile acceptance though, one that can be shaken by intellectuals convinced that they have been ""born for something"".
Stalker convinces us that a man be so misguided as to worship the most pathetic of objects.  If such a man has sacrificed his suffering he is greater than the most exalted intellectual.

504268,5,6302719666,"Twenty years ago, a meteorite fell to Earth, and decimated a provincial  Russian town. Villagers travelled through this curious area, now known  as The Zone, and disappeared. Stories purport that there is an inner  chamber within the Zone, The Room, that grants one's deepest wish.  Fearing the consequences from such an inscrutible resource, the army  immediately secured the area with barbed wire and armed patrol. But  the desperate and the suffering continue to make the treacherous  journey, led by a disciplined, experienced stalker who can stealthily  navigate through the constantly changing traps and pitfalls of the Zone. A  successful Writer (Anatoli Solonitsyn), perhaps searching for inspiration  or adventure, and a Scientist (Nikolai Grinko) searching for Truth, enlist  the Stalker (Aleksandr Kaidanovsky) to guide them through The Zone.  The Stalker has been trained by a renowned stalker named Porcupine,  who, after an excursion with his brother into The Zone, returned alone  and infinitely wealthy, only to commit suicide a week later. Soon, it is  evident that reaching The Zone is not their greatest impediment, but the  uncertainty over their deepest wish. As the men approach the threshold  to The Room, their fear and trepidation for the materialization of their  answered prayers leads to profound revelation and self-discovery.
  ""Stalker"" is a visually serene, highly metaphoric, and deeply haunting  treatise on the essence of the soul. Episodically, Andrei Tarkovsky uses  chromatic shifts to delineate between the outside world and The Zone.  Thematically, as in ""Solaris"", the transition serves as an oneiric device to  separate physical reality from the subconscious. The created barriers  and imposed laws of the outside world parallel the Stalker's incoherent  tracking methods for reaching The Room. Note that despite the  Stalker's warning not to use the same path twice, the Scientist returns to  retrieve his knapsack unharmed, casting doubt on the Stalker's  navigational rules. Symbolically, it is as if the subconscious is in denial of  its sincerest wish, creating its own boundaries and impediments to  prevent its realization. After a circuitous route, the men arrive at the  antechamber to The Room, hesitant to proceed, unable to define their  innermost wish: their spiritual longing. The floor is strewn with coins,  hypodermic needles, weapons, and religious icons: a reflection of the  mind's search for escape from its misery. In the end, The Zone's real or  imagined powers proves to be inconsequential to the weary, ambivalent  seekers. It was all in the journey...",970790400,11,2619,5.4575

STALKER reaches the  point of the ontological question: Who are we, were do we come from and  what is our destination. It does not give answers, that is impossible, but  it describes this unfair struggle.
The film is not divided in scenes or  acts or anything else. It is a collective flow of the human spirit. It is  one act that flows in slow motion because Tarkovsky's notion of time is  completely different than the conventonal one. The time and space inside  the ZONE are badly distorted by the presence of the subconscious of the  three heros, in the same way that space and time are distorted in the  universe by the presence of mass. Tarkovsky manages to visualize this  strange coupling between the human soul and nature through his brilliant  invention of the invinsble ""traps"" inside the ZONE.
The images  that are depicted on the film are greater than life. Tarkovsky's  achievement is unique. It is like the child that pretends that his bed is a  spaceship and travels across the universe without ever leaving its room.  This is the same ""ROOM"" inside the ZONE. The three heroes seem to  travel through wrecked buildings and flooded sewers but in reality they  travel through the entire spectrum of their existence. Dont believe what  you see on this film, try to dig deeper.
I firmly believe that STALKER is  one of the utmost achievements of the human art. It is a priceless gem in  the arsenal of the human kind in its search for the Truth.",964742400,16,1876,4.649390243902439

504273,5,6302719666,"There is a lot of different review here but everything is true because there is one more character of ""Stalker"" movie. It's You. The word ""Stalker"" is English but it's not just Tarkovsky's  innovation. He used a Character from beautiful story of brothers  Strugatsky. This masterpiece is done as a short excerpt from novel  ""Picnic at the roadside"" (it's hoax!). Idea is that Stalker is  professional illegal visitor to Zone for collecting and sale strange  things. It's dangerous job because Zone is not predictable and Stalker must  to STALK through area of unknown dangers. Strugatsky's Zone is a place of  temporary stop of some aliens and it's result of littering. Zone by  Tarkovsky is different one but he used the image of Stalker for few  reasons: 1) story by Strugatsky is an action so it added ground  and  feeling of reality to movie; 2) it gives rise to feeling of possible  mystification by Stalker so you can believe or not to reality of Zone; 3)  it adds a feeling of reality to this psychological movie. Actually this  movie is poetry of reality and reality of poetry at same time. You can love  it or not but it's must see. Be ready to hard work.",956188800,8,1164,4.637254901960785

Then I learned that this CD was inspired by Tarkovski's movie. So, when I moved to  the US, I was able to rented it. And what a journey! The movie is really an  experience of still, solitaire and moody landscapes, a story that should be  experienced instead of watched. The cinematography is dull, but fascinating  at the same time. The characters are terrific, a bit sinister and  captivating. The movie is strange in its own development, of still shots,  and lenghtly stop images.

Instead, I was hypnotized by a wondrous film full of the power and frustration of Faith.  Filmed in the waning days of the Soviet Union the film seems to exemplify  spiritual emptiness and the desperate search for the Divine and Miraculous.  The State has built a Wall around ""The Zone"", as if afraid of  what people might find there. The Guide who leads people through the Zone  tells tales of its mysterious tendencies and fluctuations...which we never  see even though we, like the ""pilgrims"", desperately want to. So  does the guide really believe in the Zone? Or is he the victim, too, of  desperation? The Professor tries to ""get rid"" of the Zone, so as  not to be tortured by it anymore. The Writer tried to be glib about the  Zone, unconvincingly. And then The Child, at the very end, when no one else  is around, neither Politicians or Scientists or Artists or Mystics...is it  the vibration of the train or something else?

It combined elements of psychic powers, religious iconography, government conspiracy, and aliens in a stark, post-apocalyptic setting.  This is an interesting movie, but its not for everyone.  I found myself  very concerned about the dog that turns up in the Zone (which I think is  some sort of ground zero region from a nuclear explosion) seemingly  healthy.  I couldn't figure out why it was there and why it seemed fine.  I  think anyone who sees this movie will interpret the symbols in their own  way.  Its very allegorical, but its personal.

No other film has ever captured me in such a way, I quickly become afraid of what I will find  in the ""zone"" and concern for the characters is secondary.  ""Stalker"" is an experience, not a form of entertainment. Much  like ""Persona"" it is very easy to forget that you are watching a  film. All of Tarkovsky's films are of an unequalled beauty, Stalker is  amongst his most beautiful. To call it ""Science Fiction"" is a  grievous insult, this film is nothing less then poetry.

The important thing to understand going into this film is  that A) it's primarily a visual poem, rather than a plot-based thriller and  B) the dangers of the Zone that the characters enter are metaphysical, not  physical. In other words, they are entering a realm that questions their  lives, their beliefs, and their choices, not throwing razor blades at them  (cf. THE CUBE). STALKER is a strange and beautiful film, but don't expect  action or conflict--it functions on a much more quiet and introspective  plane.",939945600,13,670,4.876106194690266
504313,5,6302719666,"What is great about this film (and, indeed, all of Tarkovsky's films from 'Solaris' on), is his portrayal of time.  In most films, time is abbreviated, eliminating all but the essential devices of plot.  But with  Tarkovsky, the characters exist in time as it truly is.  If someone is  thinking before he makes a statement, we see his deliberations, not a jump  cut to his face, then the statement.  Time is real, here.  And the film  itself acts as an externalized psychology of its characters.  All the doubt  and uncertainty of Scientist and Writer as to the reasons they have entered  The Zone, are not just spoken, they are manifested onscreen.  Tarkovsky's  films represent that which is possible in art and life, but which is rarely  explored.",933811200,6,750,4.7952755905511815

7830305,3,6302719666,"I watched this after reading the book ""Roadside Picnic"" on which it is purportedly based. I liked the book much better--the movie was just OK. It is not the first time that I have compared a movie and the book on which it is based, and finding that the book is much better.

The good: Cinematically, the movie was interestingly done. Nature inside the Zone is depicted in full color, and the landscape is lush and quiet, while outside the Zone, everything is shown in monochrome black and yellow, and looking dingy and run-down; this was the opposite of what I had envisioned while reading the book. While it no doubt matches the typical Westerner's mental picture of ordinary life in Russia, it is really Russian cinematography that is to blame, since in the book, the Zone is apparently (we are never really told for sure) near a small town in Canada.

The not so good: The movie distilled the plot of the book down to a single core theme, which was the pursuit of what was referred to in the book as the Golden Sphere, and in the movie as the Room. Some of the basic facts were changed, many of the earlier sub-stories, actions, characters, and plots of the book were completely eliminated.

Also, had I not read the book, I think I would have had a pretty hard time figuring out what was going on in the movie. There is nothing that explains to the viewer what the Zone is, the fact that it is under armed guard and that entry is forbidden, etc.

Overall, although I made it through to the end of the movie, I was really waiting for something to happen that never did, and although I will probably read the book again, I definitely will NOT watch the movie a second time.",1519171200,,1675,4.411003236245954
