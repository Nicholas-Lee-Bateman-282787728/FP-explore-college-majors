7935134,4,B00005AAA4,This is a continuation of Playboy Inside the Mansion. This from Hefner's Party Posse Days. It mostly a re-cap of topics covered before. Lots of beautiful T and A. It is a decent supplement. But good for any playboy collector.,1389916800,,225,4.65
7935135,3,B00005AAA4,"This movie, along with another Playboy movie (""Playboy: Inside the Playboy Mansion""), seem to be additions and updates to the documentary about Hugh Hefner that came out a few years ago (""Hugh Hefner: Once Upon a Time"").  Both movies go through parts of Hugh Hefner and Playboys history that the first documentary didn't mention or only briefly mentioned.  Then the movies update the story to present day.  This video talks about Hefner restarting the famous Playboy mansion parties after he separated from his wife in the late 90's.  The other movie, (""Playboy: Inside the Playboy Mansion""), goes even further and discusses Hefners life with his multiple girlfriends.

  Even if you've watched the other two documentaries, there are a few things that this movie covers that's not covered in the previous two.  This movie talks about the wild parties that the Playboy mansion used to be famous for (before Hefner married) and the new parties which are starting to become popular now.  It has some great interviews with current and former playmates as well as celebrities like Tony Curtis.

  The only thing I didn't like about this documentary and the other one is that they only discuss the good things in the history of Playboy.  The scandals, which are covered in the original documentary (""Hugh Hefner: Once Upon a Time""), are only barely mentioned or not mentioned at all in these.

  If you are interested in the real history of Playboy and Hugh Hefner, I'd actually recommend that you watch all three movies.
  If you're looking for another move with naked Playmates dancing around, there's very little of that in this movie.  I recommend looking elsewhere.",1031270400,11,1664,4.985454545454545
7935136,3,B00005AAA4,"I think that this movie and the other one just like it (""Inside the Playboy Mansion"") are supposed to be additions and updates to the old documentary about Hugh Hefner (""Hugh Hefner: Once Upon a Time"").  This movie goes over a lot of Hugh Hefners history plus the history of Playboy, then it goes on to talk about what happened in the years after the ""Once Upon a Time"" movie.  That movie concluded with Hefner married, this one goes on to what happened after he sperated from his wife.  (However, if you want to get the up to date story you need to watch the other movie - ""Inside the Playboy Mansion"" - which goes on to discuss Hefs current multiple girlfriends).

  This movie is pretty interesting, but I did have a couple of complaints.  The main thing that I didn't like is that the original ""Once Upon a Time"" movie talked about the good times and the bad times.  This movie just talks about the good times.  The other thing is that this movie only has a little bit of information not covered in ""Once Upon a Time"" or ""Inside the Playboy Mansion"".

  If you're interested in the history of Hef and Playboy, this movie is a good rental.  It's only worth watching once though, I wouldn't say it's worth buying.  Then watch the other two movies as well (especially ""Hugh Hefner: Once Upon a Time"").  If you're looking for a Playboy movie with Playmates dancing around naked, there's very little of that in this movie.  Look elsewhere.",1030924800,4,1438,4.494208494208494
