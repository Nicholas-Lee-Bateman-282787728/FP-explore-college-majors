8021762,4,B000244FYQ,This brief but interesting look at one of the most documented families in the world. Stockard Channing does a great job in her narration and some of the film and photos are some that I have not seen before.  It documents the mystic and the media facination with the family accuratly and with a bit more dignity than so many others.  Well worth the purchase,1250467200,7,356,4.461538461538462
