6254456,2,B00I9H3VTS,"The poor development of the plot requires frequent narration. The Red Reaper (Tara Cardinal) who is half human, half demon was sold into slavery to the demons by her mother (Eliza Swenson). She prattles on about prophecy and battle with the demons and protecting humans, but the early story is about her love for Eris (David Mackey) and the competition for his hand.

The attempts at humor were pitiful. The writing was bad. The fighting choreography was ridiculous. Red is very ""girly"" in her moves and it is hard to imagine her as a fighter. There are flashbacks to torture. The demon scales on her back seem to be an issue. She has a recovery scene that was long and boring. Difficult to sit through.

Favorite line: ""Using my pants as a tourniquet was a good idea.""

Has some unintended cheese value. Not worth renting.

6254467,5,B00I9H3VTS,"Based upon award winning actress Tara Cardinal and Alex Bledsoe's novel ""Sword Sister's,"" this film features a strong, warrior-minded female heroine, that breaks the well-known, and well-worn, alpha male stereotype that has long dominated the fantasy/warrior genre, and introduces Aella, a half-human, half-demon female warrior that belongs to a race of people known as the Reapers. This movie has it all: Sword fighting, blood, gore, romance, epic battles, revenge and rescue, all centered around a rare female heroine not seen since the introduction of Wonder Woman.",1450137600,,568,5.616279069767442
6254468,2,B00I9H3VTS,"Extremely slow movie. Constant flashback scenes are used over and over and over. So much, I couldn't take it at one point and had to skip ahead. It's really unclear what's going on, some of the filming seems random, almost over the top as far as being ""artistic"" , ""reverse color"" type scenes, rather than actually telling the story. Camera work was shaky, uneven, and will probably give you a headache.

When they have a woman heroine, they should use a dancer or ballerina. The lead here was clumsy at best in her acting swordplay. Most of the acting wasn't that great by anyone here, but I blame the writers for that. If you cut out all the repeat garbage, this movie would be about 30 minutes long.

In fairness, I watch a lot of B movies, but this one I will only watch once for sure.

6254469,3,B00I9H3VTS,"As with all books to movies; the book is always better which is based on the Sword Sisters. On that note the movie is what is seeing as how it is rather low budget with a lot of hands in the honeypot. Judging a movie off of others is stupid so I'm judging just purely on my taste of action and fantasy. It's obviously no Lord of the Rings, you're not going to see a bunch of dudes in armor kicking Orc ass with a million dollar score but if you have time to kill and want to watch a damn hot red headed actress beat people and demons up than yeah this is what this is for. The pros would be the decent story with a female lead as well as good casting with good acting from that cast given what they're given it borderlines cheesy/corny without being too cheesy/corny. The bad would be some direction, pacing and editing.",1437782400,,820,4.13125
6254470,5,B00I9H3VTS,"This Movie is awesome!  There is nothing that makes an action movie more exciting than having a heroic, beautiful red haired female action star who can kick butt with not only a sword, but also her bare hands!  What makes the Red Reaper character even more remarkable is that she can even use her skills to destroy Demons!  At the beginning of the film, the back story is explained, which is complex because there is a lot that you have to remember, although it makes you want to watch the movie multiple times so you can remember all the details.
  The main character of Aella, has a rough upbringing, as she was sold to a demon by her mother at a young age.  So you definitely have sympathy for her, and you understand her frustrations that she has with the conflicts she has with what the reapers want her to do, as oppose who she would like to live her own life.
  Overall I really enjoyed it.  The heroine of the Red Reaper played by Tara Cardinal is extremely entertaining, and intriguing.  The complex mythical story, combined with the phenomenal martial arts action sequences made it such an enjoyable film, and I will no doubt be watching my dvd copy again, so I can notice new details that I didn't notice the first time, yet continue to make the film even better.",1436832000,,1274,4.452586206896552
6254471,5,B00I9H3VTS,"I had never seen a movie staring Tara Cardinal before this and am thrilled that I did. Interesting story, fight scenes are well done and not over done as I have seen in to many movies recently. Story flows well and I look forward to more movies with her in them.",1434672000,,262,4.1568627450980395
6254472,5,B00I9H3VTS,"One of the beauties of this movie is that it feels very small and incredibly awesme at the same time.

 Small in the sence of what it is: A small Budget indie movie made largely on two contents cobling together footage shot over a number of years into a movie that more or less makes sence. It does contain naration at times to paper over scenes that probably weren't filmed. Its performances are touch uneven, and the sets while generally good ocasionally feel the size of the world. The couple of attempts at humor do not go over well, though may give a chuckle.  Like a lot of indie Fantasy sci-fi...well like of fantasy its mythology is perhaps to complex for its own good, being at once to much details of something and to little of other. Its an awesome movie.

That said....and that said. its awesome is there. it stinks of ambition-and more often the not it sucseeds at it. The visuals are amazing. The costumes and sets really work The aerial photography is awesome and the special effects are good, and never that destracting-it feels like the worlds largest renfaire in spots and that is a compliment-more then even say the lord of the rings, the world maybe small or large but it feels as if it is real. There is never a question of that.  There is rarely a shot of spectacle-rarely say a bueaty shot...but that almost adds to it. this is a world that doesn't quite need it to know it is there.

And  If you can look past the gobligook about Demons the story goes in interesting places. There is a line that you can tell who the hero of a story is by asking ""Who suffers the most"" And is the  Good Red Reaper suffering is the story...but it plays with that concept. She experiences a thousand arrows in this story and there all unique -how humans Demons and those in between Vex her in consiquence-but never quite her resolove to do the right thing-to fight You could compare it i think to perhaps to Game of Thrones-but that gets the suffering but not the resolve. This is not the story of the mud, but the orchid.

And there a lot to be engangled here. This movie has a ton of ideas. This is a smart movie. Now there is perhaps a tendency to say this movie is Femenist and therefore great- i think you see this a lot now. Not necessairly at all. The fact that it plays around with intelegent ideas does not make it great or even good-it mearly makes it smart-and in a movie with this much narration there is a worry that it turns into a lecture.

and this is in part becuse it is both small and awesome.  both are here.and they do effect each other  The love Triangle for example goes in interesting directions, more so perhaps because there really isn't to much chemistry between the leads-which somehow makes it more poignant. A villian who is never devoloped all that well. The lost footage, and werid pacing adds a touch of weird editing in the middle but that creates a kind of blank, almost an intermission before the last half begins.  Weird Tangents, strange subplots, a big fat tough guy who  tragically gets introduced and ends up not doing much...yeah its all here. this a shakey shambles of a movie at times... but it is not without grace, this is not without bueaty, and most certainly this is not without ideas.

Becuse it is flawed it is great. Becuse it is not perfect it works. Its a movie thats hard to rate-i have a hard time even now quite giving it a number between 1 and 5...and that kind of pushes it to 5. Becuse that is rare in film. And maybe worth your time.",1434585600,,3499,4.36979969183359
6254473,5,B00I9H3VTS,"This is simply good fun! The movie is action-packed and doesn't take itself too seriously. The comic breaks are in good spots to remind you the same!

Tara did an excellent job, not only creating the material but also starring and helming the project--no small endeavor! I'd love to see what she can do with a real budget and with a couple of other talented actors surrounding her!

It was great to see the cameo by Comic Book Legend, George Prez!

Listen, if you're looking to watch Shawshank Redemption, rent that...if you're looking to watch an attractive chick kick a ton of ass and have some fun in the process--this one's for you!",1434499200,,636,4.610619469026549
6254474,5,B00I9H3VTS,It was great to finally see a thriller that put a lot of work into creating an exciting plot in addition to lots of great action! Tara Cardinal did a great job from the opening narrative through the sword fight scenes. I highly recommend this movie!,1434412800,,249,4.434782608695652
6254475,5,B00I9H3VTS,"I thought Legend of the Red Reaper was a unique film with feminist sensibilities. Most action films [written by men] with women as the leads try too hard...they either hyper-sexualize the woman, or make her hyper-masculine. Tara accomplished the perfect balance, probably because she wrote the film. There was depth to her character, and there were scenes in this film that I have never seen before in any other film [like Tara's character fighting multiple men with a sword in one hand, and a baby in the other].

Tara is certainly promising and will be a huge success in Hollywood, particularly because she has talent and a willingness to change the mainstream narratives for women. It was a kick ass film and I would  highly recommend it!!",1434326400,,742,4.834645669291339
6254476,4,B00I9H3VTS,"With a bigger budget this movie has the potential to be a box office smash. The acting is enjoyable and the story is entertaining.

6254477,5,B00I9H3VTS,"If you love independant, action/fantasy movies this is one to add to your list.  There is something to be said about doing a movie with actors, stunts, sets, and locations today.  They do a great job with all of them.  So get it, turn the lights low, and break out your favorite movie snack, and settle in to fall in love with a firey red head, with a sword.",1434326400,,358,4.159420289855072
6254478,5,B00I9H3VTS,"Tara Cardinal is absolutely awesome as Aella, the Red Reaper.  Her character is strong yet so full of passion.  The movie has it all, action, adventure, and fantasy.  She is in love with a human who is pledged to another and she knows she can never have him which also adds to the story.  There is lots of awesome sword play and exciting action.

I think the cast was great and the red reaper really grips your heart and soul throughout the entire movie.
I think its a must watch for all who love action and drama packed movies! I cant wait to see it again!!
Im still in awe of this amazing movie hours after I watched it!

6254480,5,B00I9H3VTS,"It's so refreshing to watch a film where a woman plays the action lead! Best part is that there's still a soft side to the character that keeps the audience engaged. Add to that great panoramic views, sets, costumes, and a great love story. Really enjoyed it.",1434240000,2,259,4.531914893617022
6254481,5,B00I9H3VTS,"Tara Cardinal is an incredibly talented actress--with tons of tenacity. Not only did she star in ""Red Reaper,"" Tara boldly took the helm as a first-time director and writer in her intriguing piece--a truly ambitious but wholly independent feature film which took Tara, literally, years to finish, with (what would be for many, possibly) insurmountable, ongoing obstacles which never kept her from eventually finishing her project & getting this DVD distributed by Lionsgate & subsequently sold here on Amazon. Tara (and I know this to be true because I am working on a series with her right now) is the kind of person that would make any project better. And, I am really looking forward to checking out Tara's new books/novels; as apparently, since releasing ""Reaper,"" she has become a fully-fledged author, to boot.",1434153600,2,816,5.097014925373134
6254482,1,B00I9H3VTS,"OMG what the hell was I thinking? This annoying thing is mislabeled it should be called Legend Of The Flashbacks because all through the bloody movie the reaper chick has so many flashbacks it is enough to drive you insane, so many they could have made a separate story with them. EXAMPLE in the middle of a fight scene it's getting good you guessed it flashback, it ends she's standing there in dream land, really? You'd be sliced in two before you came back to reality DUH, I mean come on people when you write this stuff don't you realize this is overkill?

The idea was good but it fizzled for one thing a demon has the strength of 100 men at least and is pretty much unbeatable, so a half demon would be able to easily take down a few of us weaker humans, she is easily overtaken even when practicing. If a little more of that had of been added to her character it would have been beneficial and more realistic, instead she seems more weak in battle when in reality she'd effortlessly out do humans by a mile. On the upside the actors are great, costumes are cool and the special effects are decent",1434067200,,1103,4.328502415458937
6254483,5,B00I9H3VTS,"Movies like the Red Reaper are special and very hard to find.  From the first frame, you can tell this was a labor of love for the people involved.  Yes, there were some obvious limitations on the scale when compared to Hollywood fantasy films with several factors more budget at their disposal, but in Red Reaper there is a sense of passion that most larger budget films sorely lack.  Aella is a fully drawn protagonist with her own fears and flaws that contribute to her character as much as any standard notions of what a movie hero is supposed to be.  The fight scenes are imaginative and well shot.  The photography is excellent and there is a sense of scale to this movie that rivals films in theaters.",1433980800,2,708,4.5

6254486,1,B00I9H3VTS,"This movie was horrible I'm sorry to say.  The special effects were pretty bad. There is a danger of being too close to a project and I'd say Tara Cardinal got a little too wrapped up in this one.  She wrote, directed and starred in this film. I've seen YouTube productions with better plot.
It's too bad because the story itself isn't a complete failure.  The paranormal parts have some promise, but someone really needed to edit this one and give it a little more continuity.
Aella's story is that she was sold to the demon Ganesh, her biological father, by her mother.  Her mother, a witch, wants to remain young.  Then there's some confused torture that happened to her as a child by the demons. She's rescued by the Reapers who are half demon and half human.  (Their origins are never really explained).  Aella's mind is influenced by her demon father (a part I really didn't get) and she's tormented by his imminent return to slaughter the human population.
Aella is in love with a man she can't have.  Their scenes together are awkward at best.
This is a great concept with really bad execution.  It has the feel of someone who took short cuts to get the film made rather than stick and stay with Hollywood and get the film made better.  According to IMBD she's been acting since 2006 but she hasn't been in a starring role until this year.  It kind of shows.  The thing is that she was probably the best actor of the bunch in the film.  It was pretty awful and if you're looking for something along the lines of Eragon or even Dragon Slayer, this isn't it.",1417305600,,1564,4.445614035087719
