All the performances were outstanding, especially the three leads Jason Ritter, Kevin Zeggers and Taryn Manning.  With solid supporting castmates Peter Fonda (C'mon the guy's a legend!) , Kelly Lynch and Lauren Holly, the actors really tell a great story.  The overall tone and direction were spot on and I found myself loving every minute.  This well crafted story deserves attention.  Plus the music is kick ass, paying tribute to the Blues!  A must have for any and all music and movie lovers alike!",1317945600,4,604,4.805825242718447
4692913,4,B005GP7DZY,"I had seen some of the negative reviews by critics so was prepared to be disappointed.

The critics are wrong!

This is a great movie, good actors and storyline and a great soundtrack.
I loved the scene with the Blues musicians (3 of whom are now no longer with us).

Its well worth buying.",1324166400,,290,4.333333333333333
4692914,4,B005GP7DZY,"What do rock stars have when the music's over? Memories, Rock `n' Roll movies all seem to be told in flashback, like life is a remembered act. ""The Perfect Age of Rock `n' Roll"" keeps up the tradition following in the footsteps and owing some of the plot to ""Eddie and The Cruisers"", ""Almost Famous"" and ""The Doors"".

Spyder (Kevin Zegers) is the lead singer of the band, The Lost Soulz, who had the biggest selling debut album of all time. The problem is he stole the songs on the album from his childhood friend Eric (Jason Ritter), and after the failure of his second album he goes back to childhood home and gets Eric to write new songs for The Lost Soulz next album. Eric agrees to write the songs on the condition that Spyder accompanies him on a trip cross country in the RV of August West (Peter Fonda, playing instead of a motorcycle guru which he's done in recent movies), a Rock `n' Roll guru and sage. Joining them on the trip is Rose (Taryn Manning) a former lover of Spyder's and record company flunky who is supposed to get Spyder to L.A. with his new hit album. On the road they run into old rivalries, new loves, and Spyder's Rock `n' Roll lifestyle.

Kevin Zegers and Jason Ritter are the focus of the movie and as their stories unfold give performances that are the pillar and main support of the movie. Peter Fonda gives a good performance, although he doesn't seem to be extending himself much, it seems he's relishing the roles of his late career as sort of counterculture guru and his presence is supposed to add that creditability. Billy Dee Williams in a short cameo literally phones in his performance as the big time record company executive wanting his promised new hit record.

The soundtrack, essential to any Rock `n' Roll movie doesn't slack here and rocks with a blues, goth rhythm for The Lost Soulz ""original"" songs, and the couple of rock standards used in the movie add moments of recognition for the audience. One scene that stands out musically is when Spyder and Eric stumble into a blues roadhouse with a band that includes blues legends like Pinetop Perkins, Sugar Blue, and Hubert Sumlin.

""The Perfect Age of Rock `n' Roll"" is a good movie, if not perfect, about Rock `n' Roll and the Rock `n' Roll lifestyle and its dark side. Written and directed by Scott Rosenbaum has produced an above average debut film, as writer director, let's hope he doesn't fall into the pitfall of his main character.

The DVD has a nice behind the scenes featurette on the production, a couple of wisely deleted scenes, and a music video for The Lost Soulz hit song ""Turn Me On.""",1323475200,12,2603,4.541577825159915

4692917,5,B005GP7DZY,"This film had more depth and substance than I was expecting and was especially insightful into both the music business and the human psyche. Whomever did the makeup on Kevin Zegers (the ""older"" Spyder) did a terrific job; very believeable!

I especially enjoyed the music of the older bluesmen; some of whom are (already) no longer with us. I do wish Peter Fonda was given more of a role in the film.

Would have been better without all of the unnecessary use of the tobacco drug, but, otherwise, a film I would recommend to most of the adult audience out there!",1321142400,2,562,4.554455445544554

4692920,5,B005GP7DZY,"I saw this film in Dallas when it was in theaters, and I was both pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed it.  As a huge music fan, I went in with my doubts and came out quite impressed.  It's a great little indie film with a big cast and surprisingly big ambitions -- many of which it lives up to.  It's also one of those rare films (certainly by today's standards) that requires a couple of viewings to fully grasp all its subtleties, which is why I will be buying it on DVD when it's released.  I've read much of the on-line criticism by the mainstream critics and all I can say is, wow.  I've always had a healthy measure of skepticism towards movie critics, but there may be no greater example of how out of touch with reality this group tends to be.  There was harsh and undue treatment given to Perfect Age by the same critics who readily sit up and applaud, like trained seals, when Hollywood issues it's steady stream of regurgitated swill.  The film's tremendous cast, their acting, the storytelling, soundtrack, surprising depth and of course the cameo appearance of blues legends combine to make this film a real gem.  A diamond in the rough.  Movie critics to me are on the same rung as politicians, bitter, untrustworthy, bought and paid for.  Check it out and see if I'm wrong.  I doubt it.",1318204800,8,1305,4.487288135593221

8471980,4,B005GP7DZY,"Released in 2009 and directed by Scott D. Rosenbaum, ""The Perfect Age of Rock 'n' Roll"" is a rock drama about an ex-rock star, Spyder (Kevin Zegers), being interviewed twenty years after his prime, living as a withering recluse. The first album of his band, Lost Soulz, was a mega-hit, but their second album bombed because the songwriter, Eric (Jason Ritter), wasn't available and Spyder sucked as a songwriter. Desperate, Spyder travels to his hometown with his girlfriend in tow to reenlist Eric and compose their comeback album, which is complicated by the fact that they only have two weeks to do this; and they must do it while traveling across the country in an RV driven by a rock has-been (Peter Fonda). Rose is the manager, played by Taryn Manning. Lauren Holly, Kelly Lynch, Aimee Teegarden and Billy Dee Williams have small roles.

While the plot is lifted from 1983's ""Eddie and the Cruisers,"" there's enough difference to set ""The Perfect Age of Rock 'n' Roll"" apart. Unfortunately, it's a thoroughly obscure flick, but wrongly so because it's arguably as good as more polished rock films, like 2000's ""Rock Star"" and 1991's ""The Doors. Not to mention it's superior to 2010's ""The Runaways"" and 1979's ""The Rose."" One critic derided the movie as ""a bunch of aimless, lifeless characters in a rambling story meandering across the country,"" which is true, because THAT is what the film is about. Besides, it's a journey worth traveling. The fact that the characters are ""aimless,"" ""lifeless"" and ""meandering"" ties into the pitfalls intrinsic to the 'rock star' lifestyle. The very name of the band, Lost Soulz, tells you everything ya need to know. The movie's basically a warning (note the living shell of Spyder at merely 47 years of age); it's also so much more.

I was in a metal band for several years, playing all-original music (written mostly by me), and we opened for Tim Ripper Owens in the winter of '95 on one occasion. In less than a year he was a member of Judas Priest, touring the world. Of course, Ripper's story was the basis for the aforementioned ""Rock Star."" I'm sharing this to show that I know a little about the lifestyle and this film rings true. There are numerous gems to mine underneath the excesses of drugs, booze & sex. Take, for instance, when the driver of the RV, August West (Fonda), offensively sizes-up Rose; without skipping a beat she returns the favor and August recognizes the truth when he hears it. Rose emphasizes that she wouldn't be there if she ""didn't love the music"" and you know it's genuine; she's not just a ""hot piece of axx,"" as Spyder writes her off in the interview.

Speaking of whom, Taryn Manning is effective as Rose in a challenging role, but in my opinion they needed someone curvier for the part. She's decent lookin', but her no-axx body is a far cry from a ""hot piece of axx."" Someone like an older Aimee Teegarden would've worked better, physically speaking.

The core of the story is that Spyder and Eric are best friends, and intense rivals, who need each other to work their magic: While Eric is the king of composition, it's frontman Spyder who makes his songs soar, which we convincingly observe at a few of their gigs on their road trip. The Lost Soulz songs ""Turn Me On"" and the Guns N' Roses-ish ""Without You"" provide all the evidence we need. Of course, these songs are fake in the sense that Lost Soulz doesn't exist, but they were composed for the movie by Andrew Hollander; and Kevin Zegers & Jason Ritter actually perform on them.

The only reason I don't give this movie a higher grade is because the set-up is shaky and can be confusing, possibly turning off first-time viewers rather than engaging them. If you can get past this, however, the film is full of riches on rock/metal and being a musician in general. Beyond the 'performances' of the Lost Soulz songs, there are a few highlights, like Spyder & Eric's confrontation in the rain and the blues bar sequence (featuring cameos by legends Sugar Blue, Pinetop Perkins, Hubert Sumlin, Willie ""Big Eyes"" Smith and Bob Stroger). Then there's the powerful climatic scene at Spyder's ritzy mansion with Jane's Addiction's ""Three Days"" playing in the background, which just so happens to rank with the all-time best cinematic scenes utilizing rock songs, like the close of 1998's ""Buffalo '66"" with Yes' incredible ""Heart of the Sunrise.""

Let me close by saying that Kevin Zegers was a supreme choice to play Spyder. Ritter is also quite good.

The film runs 92 minutes and was shot in Westfield & Wrightstown, New Jersey; New York City; and Los Angeles.

GRADE: B+

COMMENTARY ON THE ENDING ***SPOILER ALERT***

Eric walks-in on Rose/Spyder having sex and acts like he's been totally betrayed and it's the end of the world. He quits the band and permanently severs ties with Spyder. But wasn't Rose Spyder's girl when the road trip started a mere month earlier? In other words, Eric basically stole her from Spyder in the first place, and very recently. Also, with all the drinking & drugs involved, wouldn't it be likely that Rose & Spyder would hook up again at some point, that is, succumb to temptation when it eventually presented itself?

While this might strike you as bad story-telling, I don't think so. Despite their close friendship, the movie shows that Eric had serious qualms about working with Spyder and even left the fame of a lucrative career several years earlier because he couldn't handle the draining love/hate dynamics thereof. When he catches Spyder and Rose going at it he basically says ""I'm done"" because, for him, the demanding rock 'n' roll lifestyle just wasn't worth the aggravation anymore. Without the necessary chemistry that Eric provides, Spyder devolves into an empty shell.",1480982400,,5756,4.798183652875883

Spyder, played sensationally by Kevin Zegers, debut album made him a star, the songs on the album all stolen from his boyhood friend Eric, Played sensationally by Jason Ritter. spyder's 2nd album tanks and he looks for Eric to write him some songs for his 3rd album. Eric's condition is that they travel cross country in a slip stream mobile home, driven by the sensational Peter Fonda. Watch this for the ups and downs and the interactions within the group.
