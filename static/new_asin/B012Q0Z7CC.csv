8726456,5,B012Q0Z7CC,"Serial Killer # 1 is a French film comparable to well known films like: Seven (1997), Insomnia (2002), or Zodiac (2007).  The film focuses on a life of one cop who in 1991 joins the French Criminal Investigators Bureau that specializes in solving long forgotten unresolved murder cases.  He soon pieces together certain murders that occurred over a period of time and realizes that they were all committed by one person.  He and his colleagues are certain that they have a serial killer roaming the streets of Paris murdering young and attractive women in a brutal manner after sexually assaulting them...it all resembles something comparable to infamous Jack the Ripper case.  Years go by and more murders are being committed...the case of the serial killer drives the cop to insanity and he decides dedicates his career to find  the perpetrator of these heinous crimes and bring him to justice.

Very engaging and well crafted film. One of the best European detective/serial killers films I have watched.",1449360000,,1006,5.030120481927711
8726457,5,B012Q0Z7CC,"Frederic Tellier directed this superb chronicle of tracking in search of this infamous murderer.

The picture focuses its attention(with Paris as huge frame)around the internal in and outs inside the criminal brigade. Their different opinions, struggling ambiance, clash of visions; and meanwhile the succesive murderers happen during the investigation, dare us to understand the enormous responsability of these inspectors facing every new sexual attack while the time is running.

The sequences in the Court are hovered of dazzling realism.

Wonderful cast and the always talented Nathalie Baye (despite her supporting role) steals the show all the way through.

Watch it without restrictions. You'll love it. A treat!",1441152000,,720,5.700934579439252
