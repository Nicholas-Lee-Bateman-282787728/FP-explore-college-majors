627152,5,6303340911,"Michael J Anderson is the epitamy of greatness in acting and in stature. His role in ""The Great Land Of Small"" only solidifies his status in Hollywood as the world's greatest little man as Fritz. He electrifies  audiences with his stellar, Academy award deserving performance. He is a  true American icon in entertainment and society. i recommend this movie to  anyone who enjoys great movie making, pulse pounding action, stunning  cinematography, and of course.....MIDGETS. There's nothing funnier than a  midget in a suit but that has nothing to do with the bottom line....Michael  J. Anderson personifies greatness as the best there is, the best there was,  and the best there ever will be!",920332800,,694,5.088495575221239

627249,4,6303340911,"The movie is from 1986 so that being said, it is it fair condition.  Looks like it once belonged to a movie rental store, so it has a nice sturdy case, movies a little fuzzy at the beginning, but it clears up after a few minutes.  It's in fairly good condition given the age of the movie.",1337472000,,288,4.035087719298246
627250,3,6303340911,"I had fond memories of this movie as a child, but as an adult it falls short.  My children were not impressed with it either.",1329782400,,125,4.0
627251,5,6303340911,"I am so happy that I purchased this movie. I first saw it when I was little and it took me years to remember the name and to find the movie again. When I recieved it my 8 year old daughter and I watched it together, it was a nice bonding experience:)",1328659200,,250,3.826923076923077

627313,4,6303340911,"I remember this movie from my childhood. I couldn't find it anywhere because it is out print. I looked everywhere for this movie and decided to purchase this on amazon.com. It came on the exact same day that. The price of the movie was reasonable. I look forward to purchasing something else from here. I enjoy the Great land of small, even though some scenes are weird.",1242345600,,370,4.537313432835821
627314,5,6303340911,"I had been searching for this movie for years. I could only remember a few details and was soo excited when I found it on here. Watching it brought soo many memories back. Even though I couldn't remember certain scenes off the top of my head, I recognized everything as I was watching the movie. It made me feel like I was back in the 80's! I loved every minute!",1227571200,,362,4.185714285714286
627315,3,6303340911,"When I was little and saw this, I remember it just captivating my imagination. So I ordered it, hoping to relive the sensation. To my disappointment, it's not like how I remember it. I realize now my imagination did a lot to fill in! My main gripe is when they visit the fairy world. It looks more like they traveled to a UFO world, it's more sci-fi than fantasy. That may sound picky, but I was disappointed all the same. Then, I wondered why I didn't remember much past that point and didn't remember the ending. Apparently, after that scene I'd fallen asleep when I was little. It does drag during the second half (or when you're 3/4 the way...I'm not sure how far into it that was). There are some good points. The bag of gold is fun to watch, the moral of the story is good (about greed being bad) and it keeps the faerie faith alive. The kids are sweet and fun to watch as well. Like many reviewers have said before, it's a strange, strange movie but has its merits.",1207180800,,972,4.288043478260869
627316,4,6303340911,I watched this a mind-boggling amount of times as a kid. It's too cheesey for even the most hardcore fantasy-loving adults whom never really grew up though. It's really a shame they didn't release a soundtrack; the music is awesome.,1179100800,,232,4.825
627317,1,6303340911,"this is what happens when you do heroin. you marry club footed midgets, dress up like butterflies, and juggle a lot. after watching this movie my friends and i found ourselves face down in a pool of puke trying to drown ourselves.  I think the real problem was that we were not on acid or any other hallucinagen. If this were a book, we wish that book burnings were still legal.

  I would describe the plot to you but that's impossible being as it doesn't really have one.  But i will tell you that the MOST disturbing part of this movie is that apparently other people actually LIKE IT!

  So if you like freakish movies with chanting midgets who worship giant balls of glitter puking rocks and horrible 80's music......i still strongly suggest you rent this move take it home and burn it before it even gets near your VCR.",1136505600,3,825,4.453333333333333
627318,5,6303340911,"First off I totally Disagree with the moron saying this movie is for kids only. I am 21 right now, i watched this movie when i was 7 or 8, and i still love the movie very much. It's a very memorable tale. Just like (Labyrinth, goonies, flight of the navigator, short circut) and etc. As far as the movie goes, i won't explain it, since theres plenty of that in here. WHERE IS THE DVD??????? That's the only thing i want to know.",1105228800,,428,4.107142857142857
627319,5,6303340911,"Like most of the poeple that have left reviews for this movie, I first saw this film with my older brother when we were quite young. And of course it stuck with us ever since. We were lucky enough to have a really good copy of this movie so we watched it over and over. Then we moved and we were worried it was lost forever. But 4 years later it popped back up. I am now 21 and I still watch this movie.
Its about this brother and sister who go to their grandparents house in a town full of psychotically weird looking people (but i don't think thats what the director wanted people to notice) Mimic the hobo is definitely the most loveable character, hes a normal human being but with some magical powers, he can see leprachauns and other magic beings that come to visit the ""real world"". and he has goldy gold. HAHA! oh man. So this ""small person"" Fritz (also the man from another place on Twin Peaks) comes to the human world to see if people are ready to handle the powers of magic gold dust yet, unfortunately  it falls into the wrong hands, and the power drives the man insane. He wants to get more gold dust and pursues him through the woods in iconic french canadian style. While Fritz is running away he gets discovered by the brother and sister, luckily they become great friends and have a wonderful bonds over sandwich and soda burps and being in a barn. To save the brother and sister from getting caught by the power hungry man,Fritz takes them to the ""other world"" full of magic, wonder, and butterfly people. Their god is a giant ball of dry moaning slime known by the name of Slime-o, who turns...just...man. its weird. He spits magic gold dust whenever magic people want to turn into something else...like butterflies. But get this, they have to jump into a black vastness off slimeo and be consumed, then they transform and he pukes out gold dust... I really cant,
I can't do this. Its an awesome movie, full of imagination and its absolutely hilarious at times.
I recommend this movie to anyone living with a sense of humor.",1088899200,,2044,4.4217506631299734
627320,5,6303340911,"I first saw the Great Land of Small when I was a very small person myself.  It is one of those timeless classics that people get all misty eyed to remember.  It's about a land of 'small' people, and occasionally they are allowed to visit our world by riding over a rainbow, which temporarily links the two worlds.  One unlucky chap gets left behind, you all know how fickle rainbows can be, and becomes fast friends with a few earthen children.  Everyone shares a grand adventure as they try and return the little fellow back to his homeland.  It's a truly wonderful children's movie that even adults will find charming.",1049500800,3,620,4.6
627321,4,6303340911,"Obviously Canadian, this children's feature is one of those films that absolutely cannot be considered a family film because there isn't anything in it for adults. ""The Great Land of Small"" is about a leprecaun-like figure who rides the rainbow to the human world to consider giving gold dust to the humans. He then meets two children visiting their grandparents with their mother who want to help the little man find his dust which has been stolen by a barkeeper...and the only way to do this is to visit the land of Small. Some good synth music, a good and solid kiddy script and marvelous comical scenes for children, this is a film that not only entertains, it teaches children.",1043971200,,682,4.691666666666666
627322,4,6303340911,"A historic film in my mind and life, THE GREAT LAND OF SMALL sends children
and adults this message: ""It doesn't matter how big you are, just how big you dream!""
If I could, I would rate this 4 and a half stars out of 5! There is only one thing negative
about this amazing movie, which will be explained as we go deeper into this review.
New Yorkers, Jenny and David travel with their mother to Qubec to visit their grandparents
on their farmland. While exploring the grounds one day, Jenny and David come across a
magical looking rainbow and begin searching for the end. On their search for the end of the
rainbow, they come across a little man named Fritz who soon becomes the childrens' best
friend. Fritz tells Jenny and David that he comes from a world beyond the one they live in
called the Great Land of Small. He tells the tale of how he lost his bag of gold to a man named Flannigan who runs his own bar. Now, Jenny and David must journey with Fritz to
the other side of the rainbow to the Land of Small and tell the King and Queen the terrible
news. Together, the real world and the Land of Small will fight to save the bag of gold that
truly belongs to people who dream!
The bad thing is about this movie, is that you only get to see the wonderful world for a short
while and then we are transported back to the real world. However, even the real world seems like a wonderful place. Canada, which is the country I live in, is one heck of a place
to live in and like I said in the title, we really have a way with making movies!",1030665600,2,1538,4.112956810631229

7843918,1,6303340911,"I had not seen this movie in nearly 25 years. I used to watch it at my grandma's house and could only ever remember the burping scene in the barn. I watched it recently, thanks to the wonder of the internet, and I have to say it is dreadful. The story is practically non existent, the characters behave stupidly, the production is cheap, and it is so dullllll.

The movie has Fritz, who is a magical being, walking around in our world. Suddenly he loses his magic gold dust pouch and some hunter finds it. Fritz needs to get it back or the world is doomed. Why is it doomed? What does the dust actually do? Who knows. The movie never explains it. Fritz just says ""it makes men greedy for power"". So Fritz bumbles along with some local kids for almost 45 MINUTES before figuring out he can use the last bit of his magic to take him back to the Great Land of Small. WOW, I can't believe this movie kept me amused as a kid. Its so so so boring. When you finally get to see the magical land, you are presented with cheap sets and poor costumes. Everything looks pathetic.

The last 10 minutes don't make any sense. So the hunter guy with the gold dust, runs up to the top of a hill and starts summoning lightening with the dust. Ok, finally something crazy is going to happen. He will awaken a monster or something...nope, he accidentally knocks over his daughter and then begs everyone to forgive him. He gives the dust back to Fritz and the movie ends. What? That's it? What a waste of time.

There are moments where it looks like peoples voices were dubbed over. I don't know if they couldn't adequately pick up audio on location and re-dubbed in studio, or if the people honestly couldn't speak English like a godzilla movie. It was baffling at times how bad the sync up was. The camera often lingers too long on peoples faces after a line is spoken and it looks awkward. The editing should have been tighten up. There are other moments where you will see background characters walking about with no purpose. Edit around that, no one cares, just move the action along.

The only mildly amusing point of this movie is that a lot of lines are delivered so terribly you will crack up. People really ham up their acting, but it comes across so silly. Beyond that, the movie is a disgrace.

Don't recommend. Remember it fondly.",1440115200,,2322,4.390697674418605
