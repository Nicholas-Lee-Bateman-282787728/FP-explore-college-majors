I think the person who gave it to me hates me.

This is one of the worst produced pieces of junk to ever be put on a DVD.

The narration is just stupid.  The images are awful.

Here's a quote. ""As Travis expanded the number of base employees grew rapidly.""  I guess you could have an air base expand without increasing the number of employees, but it would be unusual.

Here's another quote, ""Behind every successful man is a strong woman.""  I think that is what is called a ""cliche.""

The same images appear over and over again on this DVD.

I recommend that you poke yourself in the eye with a sharp needle instead of buying this DVD.",1452297600,,699,4.18796992481203
