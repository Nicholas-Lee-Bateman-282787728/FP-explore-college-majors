But when I received it, I found out that this was a Reg. 2 DVD. . .which meant that I could not play it on my Blu-Ray.

752744,4,630395703X,"As a movie, ""Beloved Infidel"" was a good one.  Not great, but good.  Because I'd researched Sheliah Graham beforehand, I found myself wondering how much of the story was fact and how much was fiction.  Besides that though, the movie was beautifully done.  The scenery, especially the beach scenes, were lovely to look at.

I actually found Gregory Peck believable as F. Scott Fitzgerald.  I'm probably the only person over 40 who hasn't seen ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" (although I do own the video and hope to watch it someday), I didn't have to worry about the ""Atticus Finch Effect"" in watching this film.  My favorite Gregory Peck film is ""Duel in the Sun"" where he plays the evil and sexually charged Lewt McCanles. His mean,selfish, jealous, drunk Scott was enough to make me want to smack him on the head.

As always, Deborah Kerr was absolutely gorgeous and I really did feel that she knew what she was doing when she sometimes played Sheliah as an insecure little girl in a woman's body.  The scene on the beach when she told Scott to ""be nice"" just by the way it was said told me that a.) something big was coming and b.) the revelation was going to explain the tone of that request.

All in all, I enjoyed this film and wouldn't mind watching it again.",1319587200,9,1259,4.506607929515418
752745,3,630395703X,"A glossy, romanticized view of the romance between author F. Scott Fitzgerald (Gregory Peck) and the Hollywood gossip columnist Sheilah Graham (Deborah Kerr) in 1930s Hollywood that fudges on the facts in order to bring us something more along the lines of LOVE IS A MANY SPLENDORED THING. There's even a lush theme song. Directed by Henry King and based on a true story but it rings false on almost every level. Peck and Kerr do well enough (and Kerr sometimes more than that) but Peck's drunk scenes are uneven, often opting for the cliche of a movie drunk rather than the reality of it. Peck and Kerr do have one great scene where he's physically abusive and threatening her with a gun. The film could have used more scenes with that kind of dramatic intensity. Outside of Kerr and Peck, there aren't any performances to speak of and both Eddie Albert (playing Robert Benchley) and John Sutton (reduced to a walk on) seem to have been victims of the cutting room floor. The plush score is by Franz Waxman.

The Fox import from Brazil is in a handsome wide screen transfer in the film original 2.35 CinemaScope format.",1292630400,,1120,4.628140703517588
752746,5,630395703X,"Deborah Kerr is the reason to see this film; she is Sheilah Graham, the gossip columnist from the 40s and 50s in Hollywood. She was featured on both radio and television, and she had an odd voice and her comments were deeply personal about movie stars, so much so you thought she lived with them all intimately.

Deborah Kerr plays her as a woman who has invented her past to impress everyone, including Gregory Peck, who plays F.Scott Fitzgerald. He exposes her fictions in a scene on a large beach, where noone else goes,  and it is one of the most harrowing forced-confession scenes on screen. Further on into the film, we learn about Fitzgerald, and the fictions he wrote and the many fictions he told to Graham and others, and one sees why Sheilah Graham appealed to him..she, a very adept fabricator of fictions, as he was in and out of novels and short stories, and the very occasional screen play.

See this film for Deborah Kerr's incredible gestures and poses and false statements; her complete inability to relate to truth, and her self-righteous fights with Scott, and Gregory peck's violence toward her, as she rejects his drinking as cute, and his teaching her literature as opressive; and then at the end, a  huge dramatic scene with Peck,  and a great soundtrack, finds her on that unihabited beach again..a kind of return to the strangely bleak place of exposure ; but then Sheilah Graham writes the memoir,  Beloved Infidel, with another writer, and it's fiction all over again especially as adapted for the screen. Their affair is awash with questions and speculations..all of which come out in this film. Any kind of story would do, and it works here, just as much as the fiction that Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald were really lovers.

Gregory Peck has, in this, as in many films in the late 50s, an Atticus Finch problem..this film is before To Kill A Mocking Bird, and it is as if Atticus himself were asked to play this alcoholic writer..he could never do it, nor could Gregory Peck. It's stogy and over- worked acting; he's not dissipated enough; but, it adds to the overall fiction of the life of these two people.

See this film, and admire the gloss of cinemascope and DeLuxe color, as it washes over one and all and gives us a disturbing look at lives only hinted at, because that is all they were really, hints of lives.",1183593600,21,2346,4.636144578313253

752748,4,630395703X,"Beloved Infidel is a touching look at the relationship of  Hollywood gossip columnist Sheila Graham & F. Scott Fitzgerald. After successful novels like The Great Gatsby, Tender is the Night and This Side of Paradise, to name a few, Fitzgerald hit a career and personal slump. His wife Zelda was institutionalized  and his writing career at a down turn, Fitgerald was struggling to earn money to cover Zelda's medical fees and his daughter's boarding school while trying to maintain his own sense of self-worth. Enter Sheila Graham who was a life preserver to Fitzgerald and helped him with his struggles, including alcholism. As a fan of F.Scott Fitzgerald, Beloved Infidel is a heartfelt and introspective look at his love affair with Sheila Graham. Gregory Peck does a fantastic job playing Fitzgerald in an honest and charismatic way. Deborah Kerr is equally marvelous, playing the caring and controversial Sheila Graham.  On screen, Peck & Kerr are adorable. While the story is tragic, it is also touching and fantastically done.",1009843200,47,1033,5.136904761904762

752976,4,630395703X,"Gregory Peck proves his versatile ability in this film. Loved him in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" (I think everyone does) but playing an alcoholic seems so out of character for him, and yet he pulls it off convincingly. I actually see the transformation in his personality and it's shocking. Great acting by Deborah Kerr. And Interestingly enough, this romantic film manages to entertain and enlighten without anyone removing all their clothes!

752979,4,630395703X,"Gregory Peck demonstrates an intriguing edge in his performance as F. Scott Fitzgerald near the end of his abbreviated life.  Some of Peck's drunken scenes are discomfiting:  we're not used to seeing him so shamelessly idiotic.  Kerr's presentation is more familiar, though as the somewhat pretentious, hopeful Sheila Graham, she captures the awkwardness of living in a made-up life.  Based on Graham's memoir.

752981,4,630395703X,"Despite its low reputation among devotees of the author, Beloved Infidel is a surprisingly decent attempt to turn a self-destructive F. Scott Fitzgerald's affair with gossip columnist Sheila Graham into a glossy CinemaScope love story in the 20th Century Fox house style of the Fifties. Not that it's going for pure soap, with undervalued and unfairly forgotten A-list director Henry King seemingly using A Star is Born for his template, with his screenwriting career failing because he can't adapt his style to the screen while his books fall out of favour - he can't even find a copy of his book to buy her. The comparisons are particularly pronounced in scenes where Gregory Peck's down on his luck author drunkenly barges in on a rehearsal for a radio broadcast and just keeps on making things worse or when he drunkenly insults an admirer on a plane while Deborah Kerr's would-be muse sits cringing in embarrassment. Elsewhere, it draws parallels with the author's own work as he falls for a woman who, like Jay Gatsby, has reinvented her humble origins but can't forget them.

For all his stolid reputation, Peck was always interested in challenging his screen image and even though he's one of the least likely casting choices imaginable for Fitzgerald, he's clearly relishing the opportunity to cut loose in the second half of the picture with the occasional homicidal drunken rage. Kerr's more obviously in her usual comfort zone, worrying, trying to manage a deteriorating situation and suffering as required. King's direction is polished and intelligent, pulling off a couple of nice moments such as their first meeting being played entirely by subtle eye contact or a nightmarish tableaux giving way to a suddenly empty room near the end of the film, though this being a 50s Fox film, the Love is a Man Splendored Thingish final scene where memories give way to a title song that really struggles to find rhymes with Infidel (the most awkward aspect of an excellent Franz Waxman score) is more likely to provoke smirks than tears. It's not the enduring classic it clearly wants to be, but it's still a much better melodrama than its detractors might claim.

Twilight Time's region-free limited edition Blu-ray release offers an excellent transfer in the film's original widescreen ratio, an isolated score track, original trailer and booklet.",1391990400,3,2354,5.033333333333333

It's a great example of 1950s CinemaScope filmmaking, and stars two beautiful, talented actors in their prime.  Both the production and performances shine in this touching love story about two famous writers.  Also, the Blu-Ray cover of this film is beautiful, full of grainy typed words (a symbol of the film's ""literary lovers"") and a big orange sun (a symbol of ""big bright love"" perhaps).  Then the inside cover (spoiler alert)  has a booklet which shows a blue ""ink teardrop"" coming from a fountain pen.  Overall, the packaging of this  Blu-Ray showcases the poetry and bittersweetness of this film.  I am happy with this film and Blu-Ray.  It's all an obscure, tender gem.",1469491200,2,821,5.112781954887218
