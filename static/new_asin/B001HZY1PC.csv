8310281,2,B001HZY1PC,"I received this item as a gift and I'm going to try and not be biased by the fact that I don't think the final painting is particularly good. The main reason that I won't base my review on that fact is: art is subjective and you may like Sanders' work. However, I still think you should not purchase this and I want to warn you of the other negatives of this product.

Perhaps the most defining feature of this poor demonstration was the camera. The angle never changed and was always very far away. We got to see the entire set-up, photo reference, palette, artist, etc. but I would have much rather been able to actually see some detail of what was going on. After getting through the initial drawing phase I was thinking, ""Oh well, it would have been nice to see him complete that part but I guess the more important part will be where he adds the color...I'm sure the camera will zoom in...any minute now...yep...pretty soon...[approx. 2.2 hours later]...guess not.""
At the completion of the painting we got to see a very close up view--the camera even paned around the picture so that we could study various areas and see brush strokes. Although this was the right idea, the camera was apparently handled by a crack-addict juggling a caffeinated weasel (i.e., the shot was very shaky). And, in addition to the shakiness of the close up, it was really too little too late. We just couldn't see what was going on in any great detail DURING the painting.

The other main detraction was the (lack of) verbal teaching from Ron Sanders. Occasionally he would mention things that would be useful to beginners-intermediates, but most of the time he mumbled (to himself?) while painting. Personally, I wasn't sure what to do with: ""Mumble mumble, reference line, mumble here connecting to mumble mumble darker value...""

So rather than ""3 Hr Portrait..."" I would recommend Richard Schimd's video/dvd ""A Captain's Portrait"" (you can get it from here or from his website). 1. The camera is very professionally run, showing both far and very close shots. 2. Richard is very explanatory (and occasionally humorous) throughout the painting. 3. He gives an informative Q & A session after the work is finished. I will say though that I might be biased because I prefer Schimid's artistic style over Sanders' style.",1255564800,11,2304,4.755
