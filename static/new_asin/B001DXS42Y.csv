Used to hate country music....but the change in Rock & Pop & Rapp have changed the style of Country Music.  Ronnie Dunn's CD ""RONNIE DUNN"" is excellent.",1357257600,,402,4.194805194805195

My husband and I are very much into good bios of some of our famous people to see how they came about. I would recommend this bio to anyone who likes Brooks and Dunn.,1274745600,,304,4.083333333333333
