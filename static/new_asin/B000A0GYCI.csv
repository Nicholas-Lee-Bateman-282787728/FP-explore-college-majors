2345693,3,B000A0GYCI,"Don't get me wrong, I think Bionicle is Ok. I'm not as huge a fan as my brother, but living with him, I've had to get to know a thing or two about this series.

  Web of Shadows was not terrible, it was certainly better than the first and maybe moreso than the second, but it is soooo obvious that these are just one BIG commercial.

  Overall, the plot line is a bit stale and hard to get caught up into. There are several sequences, such as ""Keetongu"" (or however it is spelled) or the transformation of the toa that will have anyone that is not a die hard fan rolling their eyes. Roodaka, the queen, was a refreshing new twist on the scenario and gave us something interesting, however, the relationships of the toa still seemed rather forced, which is somewhat surprising at this point.

  Fans of the ""bionicle"" series will rejoice at yet another installment of their favorite series, but there isn't much here for anyone else. If you don't know much about the plot, watch this with someone who knows all the names, locations, and references made, because you won't understand a word of this story otherwise.",1135987200,13,1113,4.525
2345694,5,B000A0GYCI,"The Bionicle movies just keep getting better with every release!

Web of Shadows features the best CGI thus far in the series along with the greatest action sequences to date. The voice acting is again top level and the storyline logicaly fits between ""Mask"" and ""Ledgends"". This is a must buy for any fans or owners of the first two DVDs.",1128556800,8,339,4.557377049180328
2345729,5,B000A0GYCI,"First of all, the movies should be watched in this order: Legends of Metru Nui, Web of Shadows, Mask of Light, and The Legend Reborn. Read up on some of the back-stories on Wikia, in the books, or even on BionicleStory.com.

Yes, this movie has got its faults, but I love it. Every time I need a good movie to relax with or require my faith in goodness to be redeemed, this is what I watch (and sometimes the other Bionicle movies I own). The voice acting is very appropriate, the CGI is great, and the music (especially at the end) is very enjoyable. This is, without a doubt, my favorite movie.",1342742400,2,596,4.321428571428571
2345730,3,B000A0GYCI,"It was an ok movie, but I could have done better. I'm not from Holywood (I wish I was though) but I have creative Ideas and I could probably do a remake or something, but overall it was OK. The movie isn't a good one nor is it anything special either. If this film had a rating meter up to ten I would say this movie would be a 6.1. The reason, it has good graphics, good characters and filled with good landscapes, but has a wierd plot I'd have to say. This is a movie I kind of enjoyed but, not as much as the second film, buy this if you'd like and, I'm not saying you shouldn't see or buy this, I'm just saying I could have done a movie with the same title, same characters, same landscapes but, a different story plot.",1327795200,,723,3.9931034482758623

2345733,4,B000A0GYCI,"My son wanted all 3 Bionicle dvds, but The Mask of Light is too expensive...He hasn't gotten this yet bc his b'day isn't until December.  But the price I paid & the speed at which it was received were excellent!",1322179200,,211,4.275
2345734,4,B000A0GYCI,"When I first heard there was going to be a third Bionicle movie, I wondered exactly how much better it would be compared to Bionicle 2 - Legends of Metru Nui--a piece I love dearly even to this day. However, after seeing the movie for the first time, I began to wish the people who made it had made a more complex storyline or at least a longer movie.

For a Bionicle movie, the story is pretty simple--a fact I was slightly disappointed in, as I loved Bionicle movies for their complex storylines. However, it still manages to capture my attention.

The story starts with the main protagonists from Bionicle 2: Vakama, Nokama, Nuju, Whenua, Onewa, and Matau. After crash-landing back to Metru Nui to rescue some of the remaining matoran on the island, they discover their city covered with webs and fog. Shortly after are they captured by Visorak: slaves to their king Sidorak and queen Roodahka. Fortunately for the toa, they are placed in cocoons by the Visorak and become the mutated Toa Hordika. Just when they fear they are about to fall to their deaths, they are saved by Turaga-like creatures called Rahaga.

The Rahaga leader, Norik, tells the toa many things about their Hordika forms--and even goes as far as to tell them about the legend of a Rahi named Keetongu. Unfortunately for the toa, Vakama leaves them and makes his way out into the strange city he once knew as his home--only to be captured by the Visorak once again. This time, however, he is introduced to Roodahka and becomes pursuaded to work for her as her servant.

As the other five toa and Rahaga try to find Keetongu, Vakama grows more and more powerful and evil with time. This all leads up to a big fight in the Coliseum in the center of Metru-Nui.

In some ways, the storyline itself is much like the storyline from Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith.

Just like with any other Bionicle movie, Bionicle 3 - Web of Shadows perfectly captures its characters' personalities and offers fantastic 3D visuals. Unfortunately, the weak storyline draw me away from it and make it not as good as the first two movies.",1322092800,,2090,4.604838709677419

2345737,5,B000A0GYCI,A great movie for the Bionicle fan.  My son enjoys the Bionicle movies and action figures very much.  This and the other Bionicle movies helps to incorporate them together.,1237852800,,172,4.896551724137931
2345738,4,B000A0GYCI,"First note: those who gave this 5/5 stars need to be shot.

Now back on topic, this newest installment of Bionicle is actually a well made movie, yes it's corny at parts but it's still decent. The creators even improved the soundtrack (which was fantastic to begin with).

Even non-Bionicle fans might get some enjoyment out of it.

Luckily the series has matured, it even shows some violence, my one complaint about it is that they didn't push for a PG-13 rating (which I think would have helped the film alot) they decided not to rate it, I think it would have been much more intense with a PG-13, and much more enjoyable.

7/10 stars (3.5/5 stars)",1196380800,,650,4.52991452991453

8071372,4,B000A0GYCI,"While not as good as Legends of Metru Nui, Web of Shadows was really a great film. It takes a darker turn from the previous ones, more matching for the aging audience of the time. The plot is still simplistic, but enjoyable all the same.

The book was still better, though!",1371513600,,273,4.352941176470588

8071378,5,B000A0GYCI,"When I was a kid I had Mask of Light on DVD. I was under ten years old, for sure. The other day I remembered this little series and found the movie to rewatch it. I can't make a decent review for that, because though I'm seventeen now and can probably detach from the aspect, most of its power was in nostalgia.
For some reason I didn't know there were two other movies and never watched them. So I did last week. Therefore keep in mind that my knowledge of this whole universe had mostly faded away.
I'm going to throw it out there that I'm not a movie fan. It takes a lot to impress me with movies, and I tend to steer towards animated movies anyway- so these days, my expectations are high with the bar being raised nearly every day for such films.
But though this is a rather old movie, I can say I loved every minute I spent watching this. I absolutely love it, along with the other 2, but this one is of the highest quality.

SpOiLeR, I suppose:

My favorite part, oddly enough, was when Vakama was on the villains' side. Usually I dislike tactics like that- turning the hero into the villain- but it was somehow really enthralling to watch.

All in all I can say that you won't be disappointed with this. I suggest you don't watch it unless you have seen the other movies (or at LEAST Legends of Metru Nui), but those are worth it too.",1354320000,,1342,4.214007782101167
