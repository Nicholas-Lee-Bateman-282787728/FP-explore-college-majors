8381838,5,B002VBD0OY,"Great book. An in depth look at the principal actors at Fort Fisher and the battle. Braxton Bragg comes across as especially inept. The individual bravery of the local commanders was awe inspiring. I really liked the fact that this read more as a story, historical fiction like, then a recap of too much minutia.",1500681600,,312,4.6909090909090905
8381839,5,B002VBD0OY,"Based on Rod Gragg's award-winning book, Emmy nominated Confederate Goliath chronicles the desperate struggle to capture the Confederacy's largest fortress and cut General Robert E. Lee's vital supply line during the American Civil War.

Late in 1864 Federal troops attacked Fort Fisher with a massive naval armada and thousands of ground troops. The bloody battle that followed resulted in the Civil War's heaviest naval bombardment, fifty-one Medal of Honor winners and an innovative combined arms operation that would be studied for generations to come.

Aired on public broadcast stations throughout the country, Confederate Goliath brings this dramatic battle to life through archival photographs, stunning 35mm cinematography and interviews with leading Civil War historians",1303084800,,780,5.893805309734513
