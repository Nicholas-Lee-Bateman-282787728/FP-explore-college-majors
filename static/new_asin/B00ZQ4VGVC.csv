8720653,4,B00ZQ4VGVC,"Wisdoms House is unusual in that it is spiritually moving, down to earth and scientifically truthful all at the same time. You don't necessarily have to throw out your TV, IPhone and refrigerator or raise goats and live off the land as Hannah ultimately does. However, the earth is in crisis and  if the human race is going to survive  on this planet weve got to change our minds and open our hearts.  Wisdoms House is  an uplifting unique film on many levels. Its a film for body and soul that also happens to have a wonderful original soundtrack.",1520294400,,548,4.505050505050505
