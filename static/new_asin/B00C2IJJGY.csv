5688805,5,B00C2IJJGY,"I've been a fan of this series for years.  I'm thrilled to have all the dvd's that are currently available.  It's wonderful to have a series that is family friendly.  It's a criminal shame that they dumped them with an e-mail just to make room for a more modern series.  Longevity and high quality should have stood for something. There's a quality with this series that will never be equaled again. I'm thrilled to have copies to watch to my hearts content.  The series is very, very funny and I never tire of watching them.  Would highly recommend it to anyone.  The 1990's is the very best of all the years.  Very glad it's available to all of us.",1374019200,6,650,4.4033613445378155
5688806,5,B00C2IJJGY,Last of the summer wine is one of my favorite British comedies.  This was the last few episodes that contained Bill Owen/ Compo before he died. He was always the one character that made the series a hit.,1374019200,,203,4.342105263157895
5688807,5,B00C2IJJGY,And the fun continues.  The addition of Frank Thornton(Truely of the Yard)in no way diminishes the fun to be held in this set.  The special is a fine introduction of his character.  I felt that his was a very smooth transition from Foggy to Turely.,1372377600,5,248,4.466666666666667
5688808,5,B00C2IJJGY,Last of the summer wine is the world's longest running sit com. Soothing real comedy. We watch it over and over. Wish we could get the entire shows series in one purchase. Many of the actors have left us. Hated to see it discontinued.,1370908800,10,234,4.340909090909091
5688809,5,B00C2IJJGY,"The product description for this video is incorrect, Foggy has been replaced by Trully and so please refer to Last Of The Summer Wine Website to obtain a complete list of episodes for this DVD.  It is worth the purchase price as this was truly a memorable series and features the last appearances of campo prior to his death of cancer.

5688812,5,B00C2IJJGY,"This is the last full season for Compo.  In my opinion, Compo made the show light and funny when many of the other characters--Klegg and Nora being the exceptions--just made it annoying.  I especially enjoyed the last one on this DVD when the trio make it to France and the place Compo wanted to see the most....Wonderful and touching...",1454630400,,337,4.694915254237288

5688821,5,B00C2IJJGY,"I don't know how true the story line was in ""Last Post and Pigeon"" about the characters in the show. But it did give a glimpse of some of the things WWII soldiers went through in Europe: I should add any war.  And it was sad to see how Bill Owens health had deteriorated before he died. My wife and I both like last of the summer wine, its a good entertaining show.",1430265600,2,365,4.0

5688833,3,B00C2IJJGY,"I love these shows but I am extremely disappointed in the picture quality of these dvds. This is the second set I have had because I returned the first ones because they would not play on my dvd player even though they are formatted for Region 1. I have noticed that on both sets of dvds, at the very bottom of the back side of the case printed on the plastic overlay it says ""Discs made in Mexico."" None of the other LTSW dvds I have bought through Amazon have said this. I believe these may be very poor quality reproductions. It is only my love of the show that keeps from completely returning these discs.",1409702400,3,609,4.258620689655173

5688837,5,B00C2IJJGY,"This DVD is hilarious.  I am still enjoying it.  The first disc: What Happened to Barry's Nose is seriously funny. Who's Thrown Away Her Tom Cruise Photographs is another one that I really enjoyed. I had not seen that one before ordering the DVD.  The second disc is just as funny, especially The Last Pigeon Post.  Vintage 1999 is well worth the price I paid for.  I am still looking at both ; disc #1 and disc #2 and I am still as elated now as if I am watching it for the first time.",1406073600,,486,4.073684210526316
5688838,5,B00C2IJJGY,Looking forward to when entire series is on DVD. These DVDs show episodes not shown on PBS in America. Christmas episodes and the one about Sam coming home from the hospital are great additions.,1402358400,,194,4.735294117647059

5688854,5,B00C2IJJGY,Last of the summer wine was and still is a fun show. 1973 to 2010. If IS just a great show.,1380931200,,91,3.380952380952381
5688855,4,B00C2IJJGY,"This british comedy is well written, the characters are believable (except perhaps for Smiley, who I find exagerated), and it goes beyond the obvious. It also makes you think about those days to come (if they are not already there) when youth is a memory but the will to live clings, still strongly, on a fading body.

I compare it to a piece of art that requires thinking and appreciation from its audience, instead of post-sign (I would say The Simpsons are geared more toward this, specially lately) that you ""get"" with no need to use your brains.",1380844800,,550,4.612244897959184
5688856,5,B00C2IJJGY,I love this TV series and hope that I can purchase all of the CDs.................The men are so funny to watch as they get into all kinds of mischief.,1379894400,,151,4.241379310344827
5688857,5,B00C2IJJGY,"As a devotee of most British comedy, especially the older shows, I place this series right at the top of the list.
Like Seinfeld, it is ""about nothing much"". but oh how endearing the characters are.  As we watch the three old
Yorkshire friends wander in and around the village, we become attached to them more and more.  This
series survives the years since it began in the 1970's, and I shed a tear when Bill Owen (Compo) died a
few years ago.  The team of about 12 professional actors make it look so easy and so appealing.  I either
smile or laugh out loud with every episode.  How I shall miss it when there are no more to view, but
fortunately I have 10 series to watch again and they still release one or two each year.  Peter Sallis, who
we also enjoy in the Wallace and Grommit series, is a brilliant central character and just about the only one
still alive today.  Perhaps not for those who want a quick paced slapstick comedy.  Otherwise: perfection.",1378944000,,961,4.389830508474576
5688858,5,B00C2IJJGY,"My husband and I love this show.  It is quiet  and very entertaining.  A lot of misadventures that seem to
be just in the normal routine of these men and women.  The actors are wonderful and make the scenes
come to life.  You will find yourself looking forward to the next one.",1378944000,,277,4.25
5688859,5,B00C2IJJGY,"Compo, Truly, and Clegg are back to entertaining us. The trio meet a man who claims to be a descendant of Robin Hood.
Marina and Howard are getting together as usual.",1377475200,,166,4.387096774193548
5688860,5,B00C2IJJGY,This is my husband and my favorite of all the British comedies and I wish I could be like these old men who have gone back to their second childhood and have so much fun together.  They make us laugh all the time.  We own every one of the dvd's so far and watch them over and over.,1377216000,,281,3.8275862068965516

5688868,5,B00C2IJJGY,"This is a must have video for Summer Wine fans.  Although Bill Owen appears in 3 episodes of the next DVD, ""Last Post and Pigeon"" contains the last filming he did. The Millennium special features all the regulars but shows the ""Trio"" in France to remember where Compo served during the war.  The story line is excellent and the acting superb. There are many other great episodes in this last full season with Bill Owen, Peter Sallis and Frank Thornton together.",1375401600,4,461,4.679012345679013
5688869,5,B00C2IJJGY,"Bill Owen's last season ends with a poignant special called ""Last Pigeon and Post"".  He would not live to participate in Season 21.

Bill insisted on trying to complete all filming.  In fact, he was not able to complete all the filming for the final special.  The producers of the show were forced to use his double for some scenes and to electronically drop his image into some others.  I think they did a seamless job.

Some of the most touching images in the show feature a frail Compo sitting alone and looking completely disheartened.  The extreme close-ups of Bill Owen's eyes illustrate just how ill the actor was at this point.

Compo's friends and neighbors take up a collection to send him on a vacation to France, to re-visit the country where he served in WWII.  The whole cast show ups to cheer him on his way.  He even gets an  unsolicited farewell kiss from Nora Batty!

In France, compo searches through the country side, looking for the spot where he and his buddies were penned down by the Germans.  Once there, Compo takes out his bugle and plays ""Last Post"", the U.K. military's equivalent of the U.S. military's ""Taps"" in remembrance of his comrades of long ago.

No one who loves this show will be able to watch Bill Owen's farewell performance with dry eyes.

I think you will enjoy this vocal version of the Last of the Summer Wine theme:
