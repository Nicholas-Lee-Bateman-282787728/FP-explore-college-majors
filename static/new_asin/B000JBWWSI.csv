2667471,5,B000JBWWSI,"Bring out the tissue box for you will need it in the end. It is a true story about a man [played by Donald Sutherland] who spent his whole life caught up in his work, neglected his relationship with his wife and forgot to be a father to his son. One day he has a rude awakening and the journey begins as he tries to regain what he lost by helping a mentally challeged Christian man in his employ find his lost father. Good movie on how God works behind the scenes in our lives without even knowing it. It keeps you wondering how it will turn out in the end.",1205452800,80,557,4.027027027027027
2667472,5,B000JBWWSI,"Splendid film! It radiates compassion and goodwill. The sheer acting abilities of the cast held my attention and lift this Canadian-produced film from the good to the top-notch.

Donald Sutherland portrays Dr. Robert Shushan, the director of an institute which employs the mentally handicapped in fulfilling orders to commercial sellers (packing boxes, assembling). Somewhere along the way he's left his hands-on idealism behind and become enmeshed in red-tape and bureacracy, neglecting his wife and son in the process. A crisis with his health and a fortuitous meeting with the interesting and eccentric James Jones sets him back on track.

This is a true story; the screenplay was written by the real Shushan and Jones. It's moving and worth watching more than once.",1201737600,45,769,5.295081967213115

2667474,4,B000JBWWSI,The movie was very good with Sutherland and Fox doing excellent work.  Fox was a new name to me as I had not heard of him before Lost. Sutherland is always good. The storyline was not what I expected and I was pleasantly surprised.,1170720000,17,231,4.25

2667513,5,B000JBWWSI,"It's incomprehensible to me why Donald Sutherland has never won an Oscar. FIX THAT, Hollywood!
Here he plays Dr. Shushan, director of a clinic for the mentally challenged.  Shushan's days are burdened with administrative work; he's forgotten his real love, working with his clients.  He''s also distanced himself from his wife and son.
All of that begins to change after he's saved from a heart attack by clinic maintenance man James Jones (Matthew Fox).  The  two drift into an ""Odd Couple"" bond that deepens over time and changes them both.
This story is deep and complex.  There are scenes superficially hilarious that make you weep, others that take your breath away.  Yet it never sinks into sentimentality.  That's rare.",1438646400,,726,5.050420168067227

2667518,5,B000JBWWSI,"Behind The Mask really changed my life in so many ways. It made me reflect on my own relationship with my father as well as my relationship with my son. Small decisions made have huge impacts later on in life. For our families, those little choices made when our children are still small will either good or bad, come back to either affect us or bless us when we are older. I walked away from this film with boatloads of hope for both my Dad and my son and myself. It is not too late to try to go back and acknowledge mistakes made along the way and it also not too late to say ""I'm sorry."" Better for our loved ones to hear that now that when it is too late, when we are gone. Then all the words in the world cannot fix what is broken. I hope more people come to see and appreciate this giant of a film and be blessed by it as I have. I won't look at anything the same way again after seeing this. Thank you for making this available to own. I treasure this movie.",1413849600,,965,3.979381443298969

2667598,5,B000JBWWSI,"THIS WAS A VERY ENCOURAGING FILM ABOUT A PERSON WHO WAS VIEWED AS DIFFERENT, BUT MADE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIFE OF SOMEONE WHO WOULD BE CONSIDERED SUCCESSFUL. I WAS DELIGHTED NOT ONLY THAT THE FILM WAS TRUE, BUT IT DEMONSTRATES GODS WORD IN THAT HE USES THE UNCOMMON THINGS OF THIS WORLD TO CONFOUND THE WISE THINGS. THAT IS PARTICULARLY TRUE IN THIS FILM. YOU CAN SEE THE HAND OF GOD IN THIS FILM AS HE TAKES THIS YOUNG DESPISED AND MISUNDERSTOOD GENTLEMAN FROM WORKING ALONE, TO FINDING HIS FATHER AND LIVING WITH HIM IN SOUTH  CAROLINA. THE ATTITUDE OF THIS YOUNG MAN IS EVIDENTLY REVEALED  IN A PAIN  DIRECTED TOWARD THE WORLD IN AN ATTEMP TO CLEAR SOME INNER FRUSTRATION ABOUT NOT KNOWING HIS DAD. YOU CAN SEE THAT HES NOT JUST A MEAN AND TROUBLED MAN FOR NO REASON, BUT THAT HE WAS JUST HURT AND DIDNT KNOW WHO TO TALK TO OR HOW TO FIX THE PROBLEM. THE CHURCH HE WAS IN LISTENED TO HIM AND FOUND THAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR LOVE. AS HIS BOSS PROMISED TO FIND HIS DAD, THE LESSON OF LOVE WAS EVIDENT IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BOSS AND HIS OWN SON. THE LOVE THAT THE YOUNG MAN HAD FOR A FATHER HE NEVER MET, ENCOURAGED HIS BOSS TO HAVE A GREATER RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS OWN. FINALLY, THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE YOUNG MAN IN ANTICIPATION FOR HIS FATHER, BROUGHT A BOSS CLOSER TO HIS SON. THE STORY ENDS WITH A BETTER FAMILY STRUCTURE WITH FORGIVENESS IN BOTH HOMES! SATISFYING HEART FELT AND WARM. I LOVED IT,,VERY SWEET. PLUS, AT THE END I SAW THE REAL PEOPLE WITH WHOM THE STORY WAS STRUCTURED AROUND. INSPIRING!!! A TOTAL 5 :)",1287792000,,1527,4.313588850174216

2667600,4,B000JBWWSI,"Both my husband and I thought this was a good movie.  The acting by Mr. Fox was excellent.  He played a man who was labeled ""mentally slow"" and he did it with such respect to the character.  The movie had lessons that we can take from it. We cannot judge others by what we see on the outside, because inside they could have qualities that we never get to see because we never take the time to know them.  We will watch this movie again, it was well worth the price.",1263686400,,465,4.076923076923077

2667620,4,B000JBWWSI,"Dr. Robert Shushan (Donald Sutherland) is a workaholic leader of a clinic helping and giving useful work to mentally handicapped and developmentally disabled adults. His overwork leads to a heart attack. Shushan's reaction to a heart condition and work is typical--I know--I lived through it myself. Sutherland does a masterful work in displaying the emotion and drive, as well as a new look at life and what is important for a heart attack survivor. He must have had a real heart attack, or he talked to some men that did. Of course he was likely coached by one of the writers, the real Dr. Shushan.

His new lease on life awakens him to a need to get closer to his son Brian (Bradley Whitford) who, after years of a civil relationship, questions the need or desire for more of the emotional and loving kinship.

Unfortunately, during the heart episode's recovery time, the board of the clinic developed by Dr. Shushan has decided he needs to step down. Shushan takes one desperate stab at making a difference before he must leave. A mentally handicapped client and maintenance worker, James (Matthew Fox) becomes Shushan's focus. James had initially saved Shushan by being at the scene of the heart attack and responding appropriately.  Shushan's enhanced effort to help this young man, lead to an attempt to find his father.  James one great need/wish is to find his father, and that this father be proud of him. What an amazing portral of this young man who begins to see the doctor as his father.

Of course, the father is found.  That is no surprise. It really happened. It is the reaction to the situation by all four, 2 sons and 2 fathers, that makes the ending. Powerful drama, and knowing it was real, makes the emotional adventure of this DVD all the better.  Father and son bonds are powerful to watch.

Perhaps this is one for all fathers and sons to watch. Perhaps finding more important and realistic goals for life might be approached without the need to have the life-altering heart attack by many viewers.

I'm a little slow in coming across this DVD--but so pleased I finally did.
It's a love story of sorts, of real men, and real lives, and how men can desire and find a father/son relationship that works.",1250208000,3,2226,4.687179487179487
2667621,5,B000JBWWSI,"What an amazing movie!  I can't believe I have not heard anyone talking about this true life story.

Donald Sutherland does a great job as Dr. Shushan who helps a young man with disabilites that most of the system have simply overlooked.  He invests his heart into the young man and it has an amazing transforming affect upon his life due to this friendship and the search for his father.

This is one that will make you cry, very moving.",1246320000,2,438,4.4375

The developing relationship challenges both men and brings them to a place of healing and resolution between James and his father and the head of the center and his own estranged son. The acting is riveting and very satisfying. It is not a children's movie, but involves a deep theme about the value of a father, no matter who he is or how much water has gone under the bridge.",1229904000,9,653,4.637931034482759
