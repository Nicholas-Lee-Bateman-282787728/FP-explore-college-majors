Usually I love anything with a Viking. And I was also easily lured by the fact that this movie contained the music of Dimmu Borgir and Burzum. ""Great!"" I thought, ""a Pathfinder knockoff with a Black Metal soundtrack"". Not even on its best day. Two goons wandering though the woods, spitting crappy dialog and butting heads with like 5 other characters was what I got. DOn't forget the Chapter titles that pop up, on one occasion to one of the viking banging his head while the words are on screen. Thanks for the suspension of disbelief fellas!

As I was saying just the other day, you simply don't see enough good, old-fashioned Viking dramas these days, do you?  Then, lo and behold, what should appear but ""Severed Ways: The Norse Discovery of America"" to help fill the void and make us all wiser as to just how brutal and savage life could be at the turn of the last millennium (the movie is set in 1007 A.D.).  However, let it be noted for the action fans in the audience that ""Severed Ways"" is, if anything, an ""art"" Nordic drama, a documentary-style, largely wordless cross between ""Quest for Fire"" and ""The New World"" - with even a bit of ""The Blair Witch Project"" thrown in for good measure (the palsied camerawork is what reminds us most of that film).

Orn and Volnard (don't ask me which is which) are two young Norsemen who have embarked on an expedition to North America with other members of their tribe.  When their compatriots are killed in a battle with some natives called Skraelings,  the two strapping lads flee to the forest where they hide out, search for food, build a makeshift shelter and fight off packs of  ravenous animals.  They also encounter a couple of Christian monks and more of those dreaded Skraelings.  Heck, there's even a doe-eyed squaw named Abenaki who drugs and kidnaps one of the boys and makes passionate love to him in her thatched wigwam.

I must admit I kind of admire the sheer lunacy of producer/writer/director/editor Tony Stone's vision (he also plays Ork, which makes him pretty much a one-man show on this film).  After all, it isn't often one comes across a movie set in the 11th Century that also features a highly eclectic and utterly anachronistic musical soundtrack ranging in style from pseudo-headbanger to ersatz-Rachmaninoff to quasi-Enya to flat-out monster truck rally commercial.  Just for the record, however, the actual recording artists include Popul Vuh, Dimmu Borger, Judas Priest, and Burzum, among others. Actually, the score is probably the single most intriguing aspect of the movie.

I`m not sure of the wisdom of having these ancient warriors speaking in subtitled modern slang (""This fish is killer,"" ""We`re toast if we stay here,"" etc.), since it encourages us to giggle right at the moments when we should be taking the story most seriously.

Nevertheless, the movie does earn itself some points for its complete lack of sentimentality as well as for its refusal to shy away from depicting the harsh, brutal realities of life at that time (one does wonder, though, just how many trees and animals may have been hurt in the making of this film).  Yet, even here Stone goes too far at points.  Stark realism is one thing, but watching an actor literally emptying his bowels in full view of the camera is quite another.  Still, I guess that's one way of ensuring for yourself and your work a permanent place of record in the annals of motion picture history.

""Severed Ways"" may be easy to poke fun at, but it's so utterly out-there and loopy - and so doggedly sincere in that loopiness - that you simply can't help but be drawn into it.  In all honesty, I'm not entirely sure how I feel about ""Severed Ways,"" but I am sure that I will never forget it.",1250294400,26,3191,4.696588868940754
3841812,1,B0023BZ64Y,"The basic story is trying unsuccessfully to tell a tale of two Norsemen lost in North America in 1007. The encounter hostel Indians and seductive Indian women, the Blair Witch, and even a couple of runaway monks.  We watch them make fire, eat fish and even a close up of one defecating in the woods.

This film must have been made in 1007 as the producers have not figured out how to handle talkies. The voice overlay, what little there is is not in sync with the picture.

Lots of nice colors and bird sounds. Looks mostly like ""Blue Planet"" however there are no animals eating animals unless you are counting the two Viking dudes that get ""left behind.""

3841813,4,B0023BZ64Y,"Here's why I enjoyed this movie:

* gritty (the defecation scene....not ""dirty,"" but simply daily business). The claim that this was the director ""taking art too far"" is a bit presumptuous. I saw this not as a director seeking art at any cost, but rather making a realistic movie that includes the daily lives of these two men, sometimes in near-real time, in a very perilous world.

* the trajectory of this movie isn't like any other movie I've seen. If you see this movie with an open mind, I only suggest this as necessary because of the actual film's structure...and yes, chapter screens function as both stopgap and a fluid transitional choice on the part of the director. I happen to not have a problem with the title screens, and in fact, chalk it up as a nod to Tennessee Williams.

* the democratizing aspect of it: this movie proves that any committed individual. The level of commitment to authenticity -- soundtrack excepted -- in this movie is impressive, and excels in portraying the lack of both protagonists' exposure to Judeo-Christian worldview (whether you judge this as for better or worse is something I leave to you).

This movie might be hailed as the next big step in filmmaking in the Internet age, and I fully understand why.",1249516800,2,1252,4.703196347031963
3841814,4,B0023BZ64Y,"""Severed Ways""
Directed by Tony Stone
(Magnolia Films, 2009)
----------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Spoilers below
----------------------------------------------------------
It is amazing to realize that Viking explorers came to North America over a thousand years ago -- fully five hundred years before the Spanish, French and British colonized the continent.  This film is set in the era of the Viking expansion, in the year 1007, when a Viking landing party near Newfoundland falls afoul of a band of ""skraelings"" (Indians), and leaves two men behind when the skraelings attack. The two castaways pull themselves together and decide to hike cross-country to seek the Viking settlement of Vinland; along the way they confront two aspects of the new, future world -- the unknown frontier and a new religion, Christianity, which (in this script, at least) now challenges the ""old ways"" of the Norse gods of Odin, Thor, et. al.

The movie is an ode to the mythologized Viking spirit which has been seized on by some metalheads as an emblem for their music, but even with this seemingly blunt premise, the film has a surprisingly meditative feel. Although some of the hand-held effects are trying, overall the cinematography is sweeping, evocative and expressive -- the scenes of nature and the endless woods of the Eastern seaboard are continually arresting, and the illusion of these two men being stranded in the 11th Century wilderness is  convincing. There is very little dialogue (and all of it is dubbed into Nordic dialect) with most of the story being told visually, with surprising effectiveness. Some sequences seem gratuitous -- most notably Tony Stone's character seen relieving himself in the woods, with Stone actually defecating onscreen; there is also a scene in which a church is burned and the smoldering cross is felled by an axe.  It's heavyhanded, but ultimately it fits into the vision of the script. Here we see the first thoughtless marauding of European men into the interior of North America; they are violent, frightened and destructive, but also resourceful and bold, and in search of a new way of life. A film that could have been loud and loutish is instead thoughtful and evocative, with a soundtrack to match, both eerie and subtle, and hardly the chord-crunching metalfest you might imagine.

Viewers (and potential viewers) will be split on this film... I imagine most people will avoid it because of what they assume it will be like, but it is not the crude Conan The Barbarian film they foresee.  To be sure, there are elements of this macho swords-and-sandals mythology at play, but on the whole this is a rather effective, believable semi-historical drama about man-versus-nature, and the tragedy of man-versus-man. It's a more mature film than you might imagine, and destined to be a cult favorite for a certain brand of film fans, mainly those creative re-enactment types who value realism and historical narratives. Definitely worth checking out, if you think it's at all something you'd enjoy.  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film review blog)",1248739200,21,3101,5.227364185110664
3841815,5,B0023BZ64Y,"Stoked its finally released on dvd. Saw this at Angelika and it rocked. This is really an excellent film-nothing else like it out right now. The reasons to like Severed Ways are pretty much the same reasons that some of its critics don't get it. Yes, it is a Viking flick that is neither a swashbuckling/love story nor a Monty Python skit. That is a GOOD THING! It picks up on a footnote from a Viking saga and imagines two young Vikings left behind and lost in America. They struggle to survive. They work. They attempt to WALK home and into Viking lore! Its shot in Newfoundland and it's retardedly beautiful. Even some critics were saying it's worth it for that alone...others got bored by this which is totally lazy... Also, this film is a breathe of fresh air. A lot of new films have a huge script about a cool dude crying about his girlfriend in a bar and there are a bunch of telephone calls and then in the end everybody breaks out their guns and heroine. BIG FREAKING DEAL--seen it all before! Rest assured there is none of that garbage in this movie and finally there is a film breaking the mold. You actually get a singular film experience, something to talk about- maybe even argue about. The depiction of natural beauty is not SW's only epic aspect. It also shows the clash of civilizations in a thoughtful way. There are several carefully scripted vignettes in which these vikings talk about, remember and confront both the rise of Christianity in Europe, and their fears of the skraelings(Native Americans) These confrontations become very real when strange monks and skraelings cross their path. You will be caught off guard by the alternately brutal and tenderhearted ways all of these characters behave with each other. Won't spoil it, but it's not what you expect.

Soundtrack: also epic.

It's a meditation on the impossible.

3841816,1,B0023BZ64Y,"I had mistakenly taken this review down last year because of the nasty emails I got - put this back up for fun's sake...wish I could post all of the comments from the nuts that adore this film as art - and from the people who sent nice comments here.

I went into this with an open mind since they had enough clout to distribute this in our ordering magazines and trailer DVDs for customers. I have had this trailer playing in-store for a month now and people have been fascinated by how it looked. Let me be frank and say I do not even want to put this on the shelf. I thought maybe I would give this two stars when I saw how many supplements there were, but even after watching those I felt (for the first time in reviewing films) like giving a negative star rating.

The film takes place in 1007 and follows two abandoned Norsemen traversing the countryside in hopes of finding a way home. And that about covers it. Let's get the laundry list out of the way:

* The format is divided into chapters with BIG RED letters that say ""CHAPTER ONE"" in case we needed to know.

* There are very few words spoken throughout the entire film - but when they do we get such gems as ""We're toast if we stay here"" and ""This fish is really killer"". Toast and killer? I did not research the history on those words but I am pretty sure the slang for those did not exist 1000 years ago.

* The sound does not match what is being said so I am not sure if that involves the dubbing or what, but I felt I was watching an old Godzilla film at times.

* The famous defecation scene (I had read about this in numerous sources); wow - what can I say. Not sure why anyone would ever put that in a movie. At that point I said dude - you need not ever make another film again.

The supplements sounded promising - but then I watched them. The ""Severed Scenes"" show six minutes of shots that could not have hurt an already slow paced, painfully methodical mix of nothing happening into pointless moments. The ""Scenic Ambiance"" has four different elements (Fire, Wind, Water and something else) of nature on a loop repeat. The ""Slow Burn"" is what I call the acid trip section; it shows a six minute cut of the crew (in slow motion mind you) burning and chain-sawing one of the prop huts while they are hammered. Then there is a three minute clip of ""Back Home"" which shows sheep frolicking in the countryside and shorelines.

I am not kidding in any of this - I cannot understand how this film got any praise. I am thinking several critics out there that touted this as a masterpiece thought no one would actually watch this and no counter point would be made. Please skip this, but if you do watch it and want to soak up the wipe with a leaf scene, it takes place at the 20:50 minute mark. Enjoy.",1248480000,3,2770,4.223062381852552

3841821,2,B0023BZ64Y,"This American 2007 (very) low-budget independent film had a lot of potential - but it was almost all comprehensively wasted by morbidly stupid scenario. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

The film begins with an authentic citation from the Leif Ericson saga. During his expedition to Vinland in 1007 he and his people made contact with local Indians, which they called Skraelings and traded with them. However, quite soon an incident caused the Indians to attack Viking explorers, who were forced to embark on their ship and escape in great urgency. Two men who were earlier send on a patrol had to be abandoned. The makers of this film tried to imagine what could have happened to those two men...

The initial idea was great and full of promise and the fact that this film was made on a very limited budget could also have been an asset, as it was possible to focus on atmosphere and conversations. On the first point, this film is to a certain degree succesful (hence two stars instead of one) as indeed, the slow paced, long voyage through pristine wilderness of North America is shown very well indeed. The music, which includes both slow rhytmed melancholic pieces and quite good hard rock is OK too. But those are the ONLY things done well in this film.

It is the stupidity of the scenario that killed ""Severed Ways"". Dialogs are reduced to virtually nothing. People act stupidly and without any logic, like for example destroying the only shelter they can find in wilderness as soon as the see it and later wearing summer clothes in the middle of Canadian winter (and those guys are supposedly Norsemen, so they probably saw winter before...). Some very gross scenes (very graphic defecation and chicken killing) were included for no reason at all. A completely unnecessary sex scene was thrown in in the most irrational idiotic way and forgotten about, etc.

There is a moment when, inspired probably by the story of Saint Brendan of Clonfert, new characters appear opening way to a great cultural shock (always an interesting thing to watch) and possibly some clever dialogs - but the director got scared by his own courage and not knowing what to do killed these characters ASAP. Then some other new characters are introduced allowing another possible cultural shock - and boom, they got killed or otherwise disposed ASAP!

Last but not least, and sorry for the SPOILER here, this whole film is a long voyage to... absolutely nowhere!

After the absolutely awful ""Pathfinder"" this is another failed attempt to show on screen the Norse discovery of America - one could almost think that there is a kind of ancient Skraeling curse attached to this topic...

I really suffered through this initially very promising thing and survived only because of some fast forwarding. I will not keep this DVD. Avoid!",1391990400,,2838,4.851239669421488
3841822,4,B0023BZ64Y,"This one falls in its own special niche.  Yes, it is true to the Viking pictures like Pathfinder, 13th Warrior and Valhalla Rising, but the budget is considerably lower and it has a grass roots feel to it.  The camera work can feel raw, but it adds a transcendent aspect to the action as if it would be captured by an eye at that time?  Not so much brutality as other like films, but some strange moments and animal cameos along with curious Natives.  The soundtrack is equally bizarre as it oscillates between heavier metal selections to more Euro-style prog metal and black metal selections.

There is a lot to back this up and I've seen many other stories that owe something to that idea. Severed Ways fails to meet the bar. Maybe because it's a foreign film and their idea of storytelling is different? I don't know. There is little dialogue between two guys who have been left to fend for themselves, leading to unnecessary problems. The whole tale seems to revolve around the writer's (also one of the actors, director and more) own stark, dark, hopeless worldview. Some of the cinematography is excellent and there are a lot of really cool premises/ideas ... sadly they just aren't well executed. The ""heavy metal"" soundtrack isn't very impressive either.

The real genius here is Tony Stone, and his cinemaphotographers. Amazing creativity. And a dose of real intestinal fortitude too. lol. You'll know what I mean shortly into the film. I have watched this before, and returned for a second viewing. Don't bother with this film if you need everything spelled out for you, and require non-stop action and violence to entertain yourself. This film is for thinkers, and for people interested in realism. Wind is the main background noise. And the crunch of dry leaves.

I mean, really? It's clear there was no script whatsoever for this film, and if there was it should have been used by the Viking to wipe his arse after crapping in the woods- another gratuitous, absurd scene.

3841847,2,B0023BZ64Y,"I had hoped to see a creative treatment of the interactions of Vikings, Christian missionary monks, and Native Americans in North America a thousand years ago--so many possibilities to explore in the interface between these groups.  Instead it's just the small-scale story of a pair of clueless Robinson Crusoes.  When two Vikings get permanently stranded in enemy territory, they right away start noisily chopping down trees and building big fires!  They laboriously construct a lean-to hut but immediately abandon it.  And when they discover the camp of a couple of Christian monks, do they rejoice in finding fellow Scandihoovians in this dangerous place, join forces with them, find out why the Native Americans have allowed them to coexist here, and seek a way to survive long term in this hellacious new world?  No!  They just run over and begin killing them, without even getting a little information from them first.  It's just Dumb and Dumber with attitude and battle axes!

This movie however was rated pretty high and I must say that I have never been more disappointed in a movie as I was with this one. For starters it looked like a high school film class project that was filmed with a camcorder!! It contained little to no action and was extremely boring. I have read much on the vikings/norsemen and these guys hardly stack up to being as even remotely as rugged and vicious as the real thing. So to sum things up it's an extremely low-budget, inaccurate and boring waste of time and money.

3841849,1,B0023BZ64Y,"I am an author and write historical fiction novels set during the Viking Age, so I (1) know quite a lot about the Vikings, and (2) keep hoping that someone, someday, will make a good movie about a people who had a fascinating, complex culture, and are widely misunderstood and misrepresented.

This is not such a movie. It was horrible on every possible level. On a technical level, the film looked like it was made by rank amateurs--it was almost home-movie grade stuff, and I'm amazed it managed to make its way into any kind of distribution system.

From the standpoint of telling a story, it ranged from numbingly slow and boring to ludicrously unrealistic. For example, at one point a female Native American drugs and captures one of the two Vikings, uses him as a sex slave, then turns him loose again. Right--I'm sure that happened quite frequently with the American Indian tribes. At another point, the two Vikings happen upon, in the middle of a North American forest, two Irish or English monks who have literally washed up on the shores of a distant foreign land, and have built a little log cabin mini-monastery, complete with two chickens in the yard. Of course our two lost Vikings must instantly revert to their savage Viking ways, and they attack the monks, burn the cabin, and chop down the cross. See monk, must kill--that's the simplistic view of Vikings this film portrays.

The idea behind this film--that two Vikings who are part of one of the several Scandinavian voyages made to Vinland get left behind and stranded in North America--actually could have been the basis for an interesting, Castaway type of story. Unfortunately, to tell that story, the filmmakers would have had to know something about primitive survival and food gathering skills--things most real Vikings would have known. The two bonehead characters in this film, however, would have starved to death in a week.",1274918400,7,1904,4.87037037037037
3841850,1,B0023BZ64Y,"I bought this film expecting a good Viking yarn mixed with Native Americans. What I got was a VERY poorly filmed farce, with ""Black Metal"" which sounded more like European elevator music. The ""filmagrapher"" with the hand held camera must have been nearsighted, his jogging filming, poor angles and bad choices in lighting  showed a lack of experience. The ""defacating"" shot was revolting! The Native Americans seemed realistic, but that's the ONLY good thing about this pitiful excuse for a ""Norse Adventure"". I will remove this from my collection a.s.a.p. How about a reprint of Nils Gaup's ""Pathfinder"" I've heard it's an excellent North American Norse Adventure.

3841851,1,B0023BZ64Y,"I should really stress that I love Vikings and black metal. So when I heard about this movie touting a soundtrack featuring Burzum, Morbid Angel and others, I was very excited. I was very disappointed with the film for many reasons though:

-Slow pace. This film could have been a lot shorter if they cut some of the walking scenes down. The majority of the movie was just watching them walk, which some may argue stresses that that's all they had to do being stranded like they were, but we get the point after the first minute or so.

-Unnecessary scenes. The movie had a slow, somber pace going, then out of nowhere one of the chapter banners comes up(literally at different points in the movie regular Arial red font comes on the screen and says ""Chapter x some title here"") and the blonde dude is headbanging, completely destroying the mood and the suspension of disbelief.
While we're on unnecessary scenes, the makers thought it necessary to devote a scene to aforementioned headbanging Viking defecating. The actor actually drops his pants and we are made to watch as he actually defecates in the woods. I guess that gives the film the ""gritty realism"" the New York Times claims the film has.

-Soundtrack. Ok, this one is mainly for the Black Metal fans. When they say they that the soundtrack features Burzum, they are talking about ""Daui Baldrs"" and ""Hliskjlf"" Burzum (aka, his prison synthesizer albums.) The bulk of the movie is Burzum's prison synth music, with only bits and pieces of actual metal worked into some of the scenes. A HUGE letdown for me.

-Entertainment value. In general, the movie was not entertaining. The story was very slow paced, and there wasn't enough character development to make you care about either of the protagonists. All the people they met along the way just added further confusion to an already sloppy story, leaving one big ""why am I still watching this?"" mess at the end of the movie when you realize that there truly was no point in the film.

3841852,2,B0023BZ64Y,"It's a shame the director didn't incorporate a little more dialog into his movie and speed up the pace a little bit.  Like many Scandinavian films ""Severed Ways"" seems to suffer from what I call The Curse Of Ingmar Bergman or the belief that a movie must be slow and languring to somehow be considered ""authentic"" and Director Tony Stone seems to have taken Bergman's style to heart.

I once saw an interview with Bergman alumna Liv Ullman speaking defensively about a movie she directed (can't remember the name) in which she seemed defensive about the slow pace.  She said life doesn't move along at a rapid clip so why should a movie?  But she was forgetting the wisdom of Alfred Hitchcock, a far more successful and superior filmmaker to Bergman (and most certainly Ullman) in many ways, who said that movies are (or should be) an imitation of life with all the boring bits cut out.  It seems the Scandinavians want to leave all the boring bits in, which is why their movies generally suck.

BTW, Director Stone seems to have a real thing for both Vikings and felling trees, featuring both again in his 2009 short film ""Out of Our Minds"" ([...]), which looks like a more interesting sophomore effort juxtapositioning modern machinery (cars & trucks) with horse-drawn wagons.  And the trees being chopped down are full of blood--a commentary on devastating the rain forests, global warming, etc.?  The most attractive aspect about ""Out of Our Minds"" is that it's a short movie, so even if it turns out to be just as boring as ""Severed Ways"" you won't have to suffer through it very long.

Back to ""Severed Ways"" and Bergman...

Most people go to the movies to escape the humdrum of their own lives, not to languish in the humdrum of sombody else's life.  ""Severed Ways"" had so much potential for a good story about the tension between abandoned Norse Vikings and Native Americans/Canadians (referred to as the Abenaki tribe on [...]), but for some reason Director Stone thought it would be more interesting to show the Vikings chopping down trees for 10 minutes.  Hint to Mr Stone: this is what's called an ""establishing shot"" and all you needed to do was show them chopping down trees for 10 SECONDS and the audience would've figured out what was going on.

Be warned that the cinematography is a bit annoying, with many shots either 50 feet away from the actors or right in their faces.

If all the boring parts were cut out this movie would probably be 10-15 minutes long.  And get rid of the awful, awful, awful score (which sounds like a rusty old organ piped through a defective synthesizer and certainly doesn't call to mind any ancient Scandinavian or Abenaki tunes, whatever they sound like) and there might be a halfway-decent short movie in here.  I give it two stars for its historical value and because the costumes looked real and the director was more than happy to show the Vikings as the dirty, sweaty ruffians they really were, unlike Ullman whose own Medieval Scandinavians frolicked about in clean, crisp costumes that looked like they just arrived from the dry-cleaner.

One more thing: I don't know what Scandinavian language the actors are speaking (presumably Norwegian or Swedish), but it's not the language you hear because their lip movements don't match the words that are supposedly coming out of their mouths.  Since most of the actors have English names they presumably spoke English when they shot the film, though their lips don't seem to match the subtitles.  It's odd to dub a film not made for kiddies into a Scandinavian language--why not just hire Scandinavian actors in the first place?  Or why not include the original English language track?  It doesn't really make a difference since all of the characters seem nearly mute, anyway.",1263772800,4,3776,4.787365177195686
3841853,3,B0023BZ64Y,"This is an OK movie chronicling the trials and tribulations of a couple of Viking warriors marooned in the New World.

The soundtrack is also pretty decent. Also, the scene of the Viking dude taking a dump in the woods is pretty unforgettable.",1257552000,3,438,4.8533333333333335

Once you get past the bad wigs and the ""pooping"" scene it is actually a pretty good movie. Although I don't think the vikings would have used the phrase about becoming ""toast."" This is the story of two men from the same culture and their differences in dealing with being lost in a new land and new religion and different cultures. It is probably a very realistic view of what could have happened. When I read it contained heavy metal music I had a different vision of what it would sound like but it actually kinda meshed with the movie. It is not light-hearted entertainment.

The videowork is exceptional, the soundtrack is fantastic and the overall pacing and feel of the film is unlike anything I've seen in recent memory.  Some would call it an art film but that suggests (to me) slogging your way through it only to end up feeling resentful.  Granted it's leisurely paced but ultimately this allows the viewer to actually ponder what life may have been like a thousand years ago rather than be subjected to the usual onslaught of narrative exposition.  If you're feeling adventurous, give Severed Ways a shot.  At the very least, you'll find it thought-provoking.",1255910400,5,659,5.0

8349758,2,B0023BZ64Y,"This film is sort of all over the place, and definitely an indie flick. As a fan of gritty, historical stories I really want to like it more. I am okay with films that don't fit a typical narrative, where there a no good guys by today's cultural standards, and I am fine with bleak. I love period props and scenes that show the day to day life of the past. These are the things this film does sort of okay, if you set low expectations. I can also set aside things like somehow crossing the Atlantic in a rowboat without supplies to get into a good period flick.

I am no film school student, but it is really tough for me to overlook its glaring cinematic flaws, however. Intolerably and inexplicably shakey camera work is alternated with still tripod shots. Endlessly fading montages cut from actors running left to right and vice versa all the time while supposedly traveling in one direction. Moreover, many scenes seem clearly included because the filmmakers felt, ""Oh man, I really want to find an excuse to show this bird,"" ""I really want to kill an animal on film,"" or, ""Dude, you know what would rule? Pooping for real on camera!"" Layer in poor cuts and editing. All this makes the film seem like an overlong student project with a neat premise but flawed execution. The baffling synthwave and heavy metal soundtrack doesn't jive with the attempts at drudging realism, but nor does it add anything like the modern soundtrack of Knight's Tale did. The scene cards, 70s style camera effects and poorly written subtitles are likewise anachronisms that do nothing for the film.

Still, it is oddly compelling. I mean why am I even writing this review? There is something going on that sticks with you, but I can't say what it was.",1493683200,,1734,4.590322580645161
