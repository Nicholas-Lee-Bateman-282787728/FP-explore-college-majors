8608025,1,B00EPFEX2C,"The film is bad enough, but DVD itself is terrible. It makes you watch 15-20 minutes of commercials in the beginning, without being able to skip them or fast forward.",1454112000,,166,4.566666666666666
8608026,4,B00EPFEX2C,"Cliched storyline of new girl getting picked on by ss at her new school. No mom, just dad trying to start a new job as a chef. Fairly good acting as father tries to juggle attending to daughter's needs; loss of wife (mom) and job. Fairly good acting on the daughter's part as the abuse at school goes too far. What makes this a little more interesting than other films of this type are the twists and the girl's passiveness which provokes the viewer into asking important questions including the role of the school's administration in monitoring it's ss.  A second question was how the father and daughter went about dealing with their own problems.

Major criticism: I thought that the ending to be rather weak/unclear.",1399075200,,720,4.7063492063492065
