8456865,5,B0054QD5CK,"This collection is something of a grab-bag, encompassing as it does both the old and the new and both concert film and biographical documentary. All in all, however, it's a phenomenal value: four fine films retailing for the price of a single DVD. The rock legends that they profile hail from four different countries: Rolling Stones from England, Neil Young from Canada, Bob Dylan from America, and U2 from Ireland. They're captured at very different times in their careers: the Stones and Young in their late periods, Dylan very early on, and U2 at a midpoint. The Amazon description is not accurate when it states there are only four discs in this box (""No Direction Home"" is actually a two-DVD set) and when it indicates that there are no extras. In fact, there are quite a few.

""Shine a Light"" (122 minutes), directed by Martin Scorsese, presents a 2006 performance by the Stones at New York's Beacon Theatre, incorporating archival footage from the band's long tenure. Jack White, Buddy Guy, and Christina Aguilera join Mick, Keith, Ron, and Charlie for individual songs, and bonuses include backstage and rehearsal footage as well as four performances cut from the film: ""Undercover of the Night,"" ""Paint It Black,"" ""Little T&A,"" and ""I'm Free.""

""Neil Young: Heart of Gold"" (103 minutes) was directed by Jonathan Demme. It documents a 2005 concert by Young at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium, during which he premieres the songs from his album ""Prairie Wind"" and, in an encore set, performs music from his back catalog. Emmylou Harris joins Neil on two duets, ""This Old Guitar"" and ""Old King."" There are two bonus songs: ""He Was the King"" from ""Prairie Wind"" and ""The Needle and the Damage Done"" from a 1971 TV performance on ""The Johnny Cash Show.""

""No Direction Home"" (208 minutes), originally an ""American Masters"" special on PBS, is another Scorsese film, but this one is mainly a bio-doc with brief clips of Dylan performances. It covers the period from his arrival in New York as a folk singer in 1961 to his temporary retirement as a rock singer after a motorcycle accident in 1966. Extras include performances of ""Blowing in the Wind,"" ""Girl of the North Country,"" ""Man of Constant Sorrow,"" ""Mr. Tambourine Man,"" Love Minus Zero / No Limit,"" and ""Like a Rolling Stone,"" in addtion to an unused promo for ""Positively 4th Street.""

""Rattle and Hum"" (98 minutes), directed by Phil Joanou, contains live concert footage from Denver's McNichols Sports Arena and other US venues as well as in the studio. It depicts U2 on their 1987 Joshua Tree tour, fusing American blues, folk, and gospel music with their signature sound. They're joined by Bob Dylan and B.B. King, among others, as well as a New York gospel choir that performs ""I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For."" This black-and-white and color film was the companion to U2's sixth album release. The only special feature is a theatrical trailer.

Shine A Light- This is a wonderful snapshot provivded by the great martin scorcese of the rolling stones in there twillight years and showing that they are still capable as they were 40 years previous in delivering a wonderful performance to a crowded hall,The thing that makes this a more worthy purchase than others is the setlist which includes great rarely heard album cuts and being able to watch the stones work a good venue instead of lost in a see of hundres of thousands watching video monitors,It truly is a great performance and a wonderful collection for any stones fan.

No Direction Home - Marty Scorcese is back up to bat is this awesome 3 hour saga of dylans early years from woody guthrie wannabe to folk god to outcast and recluse from 1961-1966, It has wonderful interviews and performances that will have any music fan glued to there seats with all the early hits from ""blowin in the wind"" to ""like a rolling stone"" and everything in between. This is the story of how Robert Zimmerman became Bob Dylan and what a great tale it is.

Rattle and Hum- This is U2 in their prime before they got wrapped up in fame and politics,this is U2 still hungry and out to prove themselves,while at the same time paying tribute to their heroes The beatles,Bob dylan,Jimi hendrix,BB king and Elvis presley. Amazing performaces of tracks like ""Pride (in the name of love)"" and ""sunday bloody sunday"" are bound to move emotion out of even the most hardened human being or U2 hater.

Heart of Gold- Neil Young's storytelling and musical prowess are on display with this 2005 performace that is meant to show off his newest album (at the time)""Praire Wind"" which takes over te first half of the show,it drags on a little long,but manages to show Young still has some chops,Then comes The harvest heavy second portion of the show with great performaces of songs like ""heart of gold"" ""old man"" ""needle and the damage done"" which make up for any mild short comings that the first half had and overall make for a very enjoyable experince with Neil at the Ryman auditorium.

In conclusion There really is something for any true music lover to enjoy here and like I said every one of these dvds is worth the price you're paying for all 4,So it really is a win win. I whole heartedly reccomend it.",1336780800,,2495,4.523281596452328
8456867,4,B0054QD5CK,I was little disappointed the no way hom was really just a long long long look atDylan up till highway 51 and blond on blonde and only a few glimpses of that Frankley the cd is way better then the movie. But all in all a strong case that this is a great buy.,1334448000,,258,3.7962962962962963
8456868,4,B0054QD5CK,"When I recived this package I couldn't decide which disk to watch first. So right off the top was U2: Rattle and Hum. I was floored when the band opened with Helter Skelter. It was Awsome. I did not know that much about Bob Dylan before this rockumentery, and was amazed how much influance he has had other musicians. Neil Young: Heart of Gold, I can crank this one up, and it doesn't bug my wife.  The Rolling Stones, Love 'em or hate 'em, you will allways find yourslef singing along. This package is SO COOL!",1332460800,8,511,4.322916666666667
