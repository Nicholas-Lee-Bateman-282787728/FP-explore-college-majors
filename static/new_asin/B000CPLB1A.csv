8100130,2,B000CPLB1A,"This DVD contains decent to fair footage quality of these guys catching several flatheads in the 20-40 pound range but I felt it lacked with teaching us how to fish and locating flatheads. Don't get me wrong, there is some information there but not near what I expected. I would recommend buying an Infisherman DVD if you want to learn more for educational purposes and teaching you more about how to fish and how to locate fish. If you want to watch videos footage of people pulling in catfish, just do it for free on youtube. This DVD does show their rigging, how they hook they bait their hooks, but for location when fishing, they just said something about being in 50 foot of water and being near some boulders. They briefly mentioned about using cut bait vs live bait in different parts of their reservoir system due to the seasonal pattern which was interesting and useful. Honestly, there isn't much take away from this DVD in my opinion. I'm not going to approach my home waters any differently for flatheads after watching this video.",1317600000,,1044,4.648648648648648
