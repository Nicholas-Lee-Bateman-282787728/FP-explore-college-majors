8049646,2,B0007OP1YO,"Based on a true story.  Angela has purchased a house that comes with a host of ghosts.  Two psychics begin to help her out in investigating the ghosts.  Angela's home is occupied by quite a few ghosts.  They vary in ability.  Angela keeps trying to tell them that it is now her home and they should leave her alone.  One of the ghosts, a woman, seduces Angela as she sleeps.

Angela is determined to have the house to herself.  The psychics come and go but don't seem to really do anything.  Angela tries to find out about the history of the people now haunting her house.  Eventually she throws a big party for her friends, some of who meet the ghosts without knowing they are ghosts.  In the end very little happens but it all ends with the events of 9/11 (which helps place the story in time).

This is supposedly based on true experiences (check out some of the extras for more info on that).  Apparently they did little to embellish the story and that is why so little happens.  It is hard to keep track of how much time goes by between scenes and it can be a little confusing.  All in all it looks like someone heard the story of Angela and thought it would make a good movie.  They did some research, talked to people involved, but ultimately did not have the skills to actually bring it off.  The acting is dry, the time-frame confusing, and the continuity is very disjointed.  This could have been a much better film but with this crew it rally just missed completely.",1169078400,2,1477,4.367647058823529
8049647,1,B0007OP1YO,"My friend bought GHOSTS OF ANGELA WEBB for $5.00. That's about $5.00 too much. It is one of the worst ""movies"" we have ever seen. everything about it is poor: The script, the acting, the writing,the not so special ""special effects""...EVERYTHING.

This is now the ""movie"" we base all other bad movies on!

""I saw a really bad movie last night. It was GHOSTS OF ANGELA WEBB bad.""

Beare: The guy who directed this has made OTHER poor quality movies (He made a vampire flick that was a little better than ANGELA WEBB...but not by much!)

Any movie that you can tell in the first 15 minutes was made at home with a handheld camera should put up a red flag that the movie is going to be a dud.

ALSO BEWARE the similar cheepie Horror movie box set VAMPS (another waste of $5.00!)",1161302400,2,774,4.347222222222222
8049648,4,B0007OP1YO,"I love ghost stories and I collect obscure B movies. As soon as I saw the box of this DVD I was hooked. The Ghosts of Angela Webb features an entertaining mix of ""based on true events"", eroticism, and ghosts. Glad I picked this one up.",1113782400,2,235,4.130434782608695
