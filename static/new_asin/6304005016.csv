7863424,3,6304005016,"In the early 1950s, 20th Century Fox invited Samuel Fuller to make a picture in Brazil about a jaguar hunter (John Wayne was tipped for the role) falling in love with a woman (Ava Gardner) he helps to rescue as she flees through the jungle with her cowardly husband. Fuller headed for Brazil to make a preliminary study and settled in a village of the indigenous Karaja tribe. He scouted locations, shot some footage of local nature and customs, and discovered some elements that he might work into the screenplay. In the end, however, the whole project came to naught when insurance companies refused to provide coverage for a shoot in what was then a remote and potentially dangerous part of the world.

In Mika Kaurismki's 1992 documentary, TIGRERO: A Film that was Never Made, Sam Fuller returns to the same village he based himself in four decades before. American indie filmmaker Jim Jarmusch tags along as the interlocutor to which Fuller recounts the whole Hollywood story and comments on how rural Brazil has changed since his first visit. Jarmusch is also interested in the culture of the Karaja, taking photographs of the village (some of which are included as extras in the DVD release) and narrating in voiceover some of their traditions and practices. The downside of this is that the duo talk about the Karaja according to the noble savage stereotype, depicting them as an idyllic people without a care in the world, and the film never confronts the challenges they might have faced now as modernity arrives, or forty years ago when life was no bed of roses either.

The film has an inauspicious beginning, where Jarmusch asks Fuller in Rio de Janeiro why he's there, and it's obvious that this whole (very stilted) dialogue is scripted. Once they subsequently reach the Karaja village, their chats seem more real. The first thing they do in the village is project the footage that Fuller he had shot forty years before to the locals. The Karaja are amazed to see their long-dead relatives and friends. As one Karaja explains the visceral impact that this film footage had on him, Fuller tells him Thats called emotion, the same cinematic creed he professed in his cameo role in Godard's Pierrot Le Fou.

Fuller is a funny character. He was already around 80, a wizened old man that seems only about half the height of Jarmusch, but hes full of energy and enthusiasm for this adventure. He appears almost invariably with a cigar in his mouth and a baseball cap and talks in this really old-timey New York Jewish accent. I honestly found him hard to understand at points, it's like watching someone speaking Elizabethan English step out into the world of 1992.

TIGRERO doesn't seem a major achievement in documentary filmmaking, and after one viewing I don't feel in a hurry to ever see it again. Nonetheless, it was an enjoyable 75 minutes and I appreciated learning something about this part of the world.",1479081600,,2922,4.8031809145129225
7863425,4,6304005016,"An interesting documentary by Finnish filmmaker Mika Kaurismaki (brother of the more famous Aki). Filmed in the mid 1990s, it has Jim Jarmusch accompanying the legendary Samuel Fuller (who was in his early eighties by this time) to the Amazon forest to revisit the place where in the mid 1950s he planned to make a film. A film that, as the title says, was unfortunately never made. Fuller tells the story of the failed production. Tigrero, by the way, means a hunter of jaguars (which are called tigers in many parts of South America). Fuller says that John Wayne was going to play the role of the hunter in the movie, and Ava Gardner was set to co-star. It seems hard to believe that top Hollywood stars would be filming in a place that was back then (and still is) extremely remote, without any sort of modern facility. In fact, Fuller tells that one of the reasons the movie was never made was the difficulty of insuring the stars in such a potentially dangerous shooting. In many of the proposed settings for the film, the Kayapo Indians live, and it is interesting to get a glimpse of their lives. The movie is interesting, though perhaps of limited appeal (though you don't have to be a fan of Fuller or Jarmusch to enjoy this).",1366934400,,1235,4.542600896860987

7863427,3,6304005016,"Well, the then octogenarian maverick movie director Samuel Fuller is animated enough, and his co-star, indy director Jim Jarmusch, is laid back enough to make an interesting screen duo in Finnish director Mika Kaurismki's 1994's TIGRERO: A FILM THAT WAS NEVER MADE.

 `Tigrero,' the unmade film in question, is a movie Fuller had sold to the studios in the 1950s.  It's a love story larded onto a profile of a `tigrero,' a hunter of tigers, or jaguars, I guess, in the wilds of Brazil.  The movie was a go, even had a cast - John Wayne as the tiger hunter, Ava Gardner and Tyrone Powell as the uneasily married couple - when it was quashed when insurance companies blanched and refused to underwrite the production.  Not before, however, Fuller and crew had traveled into the interior of Brazil and spent some time filming a native village located on the Amazon River.  The film went into the can and Fuller went on to other projects.  Nearly four decades later Kaurismki, an independent movie producer like Jarmusch, gets funding for a project to revisit the same village with Fuller and Jarmusch.

Part documentary, part travelogue, part improvised fiction, TIGRERO: A FILM THAT WAS NEVER MADE is the result.  The pre-departure scenes are improvised and awkward, and the journey - how they get to the village and get out - is never really shown.  Fuller, an anecdote machine if you've ever seen one, is/was a great hero to Kaurismki and Jarmusch, and simply turning a camera on him and saying action probably would have been enough.  The return to the village - Fuller isn't sure it's the same one, and it takes a while for him to be sure - comes across okay.  Later, the village gathers together and the filmmakers show Fuller's old footage, which causes some people to recognize mothers, fathers, even themselves, and that comes across okay.  In fact, everything comes across okay, although none of it, as Fuller would say, grabbed me by my ... privates.  I guess you can file this one under `Interesting, Mild Disappointment.'

 Also included on the disk is 20 minutes or so of the original, wide screen, color footage Fuller took in the 50s; fifteen-minutes or so of outtakes and additional footage of the 1994 movie; Jim Jarmusch's personal photos (good photographer); and a relaxed and reminiscence filled commentary track with Kaurismki and Jarmusch. Fans of Fuller and Jarmusch should give it a look.",1131753600,5,2410,4.841463414634147
7863428,4,6304005016,"This is on the surface a documentary about a film Sam Fuller once wanted to make, an attempt on which time and effort was spent, but which for various reasons fell apart.  It would have been a fine film, displaying his  far-ranging interests and passions and his deep caring for people and their  plight. All told, of course, in an exciting fashion with spellbinding  action scenes! Romance!  Thrills! Excitement!
But what makes this film  really so interesting is that it really is a tribute to Sam Fuller, the  storyteller.  His voice permeates the film as he recounts his past and  ponders on the future, talking with Jim Jarmusch who follows him on this  journey to the village that he once visited while location scouting for  TIGRERO.
I can just smell the cigarsmoke.  And smile when he laughs!",963360000,9,800,4.759124087591241
