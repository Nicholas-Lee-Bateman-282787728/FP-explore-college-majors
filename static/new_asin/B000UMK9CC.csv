Hard rock and Heavy Metal musicians have often been ignored or passed off as a gimmick with no talent and
often interpreted as just ""skirt-chasing"",""drug and alcohol infused"" heathens with no human or social redeeming value.
this video is a testament to the spirit of these musicians-many who at the time had already started families and were willing to check their egos at the door for the sake of helping a cause that was and remains a global impact on starvation and lending aid to support communities in great need of help.

many great metal stars from the 80's-including some who have passed away;notably Ronnie James Dio and Kevin Dubrow
