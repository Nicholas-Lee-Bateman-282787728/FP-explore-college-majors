8277000,3,B001AD8FGC,This Sinister Cinema version is possibly the best print available but still has issues keeping it from a higher rating. It does seem to be more complete and cohesive than my other copy of this film but there is still missing footage and its obvious this version is cobbled from more than one source print.,1384560000,2,305,4.5636363636363635
8277001,4,B001AD8FGC,"Pretty cruddy but entertaining late 60s early 70s Euro horror/sci-fi flick.  Michael Rennie and some European actors play scientists from an alien planet out to conquer the Earth by resurrecting Universal stock monsters.  The monster makeup is pretty awful.  The Sinister Cinema release is 86 minutes, which is about right for the American release of this film.  The color is fair, the picture is OK, but the DVD-R starts glitching and comes to a standstill near the end.  I've noticed that about some of the Sinister Cinema DVD-Rs. I found a DVD-R release that is reasonable quality with no glitches.  I would like to see a remastered full-length version released very soon, preferably with a good quality Spanish language version included.",1378512000,,741,5.082644628099174
8277002,4,B001AD8FGC,"This was the last movie I needed to get to complete my Naschy as the wolfman collection. The picture isn't all that great, but this seems to be the best looking of the copies on the market. Naschy's Daninsky isn't it in as much as i would like, but if you're gonna be a Waldemar Daninsky completist, buy it like i did.",1376352000,2,318,4.145161290322581
8277003,2,B001AD8FGC,"In an effort to conquer Earth, a none-too-wise race of alien invaders takes control of the planet's most terrifying monsters: Dracula, The Mummy, The Wolfman, and Farancksollen's Monster! Paul Naschy's second major Horror outing as the werewolf Waldemar Daninsky has all of the trappings of Z-Grade Horror, working off of an uninspired story that brainlessly combines aliens, monsters, and the mad scientists into one big, confused mess. As would be expected, the take-over of Earth only ever amounts to two or three people being kidnapped and killed before the alien's master plan is unraveled. The drama unfolds like a poorly-scripted soap opera, especially when the aliens become susceptible to human emotions... And desires! Outside of the clumsily-built Farancksollen's Monster, the costumes are passable, and include another great rendition of the Waldemar Daninsky werewolf. The end features a battle between the werewolf and the other monsters, the only scene worth noting in this otherwise cheap and tacky production.

8277004,5,B001AD8FGC,"It may not have great writing & it is dated, but this film is the ultimate for the classic 30's-60's monster movies. This movie has all your basic ""stock character"" set up, a vampire Count (not named Dracula), a frankenstein knock-off, a living mummy (think Kharis), a mad alien scientist (played by Sci-Fi legend Michael Rennie) & the legendary Paul Naschy's werewolf count Waldemar Danisky (from his string of euro-horror films of the 70's). Overall it is a very nostalgic flick. Shot sort-of like an early 1970's Hammer Studios film & the plot is very, very similar to House of Frankenstein.",1318550400,5,594,4.891089108910891
