6775531,4,B00OW1PQ8E,"Excellent adaptation of the novel. They trimmed away a few subplots and edited the original story to make it easier to follow for a movie. I wish they had left Assad's character more like it was in the book (a simple, immigrant helper/assistant - with unexpected talents and background) but overall I am satisfied.",1466294400,2,314,4.833333333333333
6775532,1,B00OW1PQ8E,"I will give the second and third films a shot but be warned the novel this is based on has the most risible and tiresome plot imaginable.

SPOILER ALERT:

The politician has been kidnapped and held captive FOR YEARS.  You will get gratuitous torture scenes.  You will get ham-handed depictions of the mentally challenged.  Kaas gets credit for trying but the Islamic character SIDEKICK is well, eh, well, secondary in every way.  BTW, did I mention the LAUGHABLE PLOT??? It woulda made a room full of scriptwriters on ""Mannix"" double over in laughter",1466121600,,550,4.860215053763441
6775533,5,B00OW1PQ8E,"As a big fan Of Jussi Adler-Olsen I was delighted in finding this rendition of his first book. The movie came within a reasonable amount of time. I wasn't really happy with the way the movie was done though.
Carl Merk was played by a man that was too young and the long sequences of him looking pensively into the distance were a waste of time. Also they really goofed by not having Asaid be the funny adorable guy that he is in the books. I must say that's one of my favorite parts of the book. He's really funny, and Carl's asides are great.",1455235200,4,543,4.180952380952381
6775534,5,B00OW1PQ8E,"Carl (Nikolaj Lie Kaas - `The Green Butchers') is a homicide officer who, after acting on his own initiative, gets himself and his colleagues shot up. Once back at work he is told he is no longer fit to do his old job and because he is somewhat irascible, no-one is prepared to work with him. However, he is told he can do a new job; this is the head of the stylishly named Department Q.

What it is in reality is looking into cold case files going back over twenty years and he is located in the basement - desk bound in the semi light of a career that is truly over. He is given an assistant - Assad - who is keen as a pup and has the exact opposite of a personality to Carl. They are told that theirs is a desk job, but once Carl gets his interest piqued in a five year old case; he decides to put his detective skills to use. What he and Assad start to uncover will take them both on a nail biting ride of twists and turns and had me wearing out the edge of my seat.

These Nordic Noir's are all generally very good and some are way above that and this is one of the latter. Once again not a very well known cast, but all showing acting ability in the excellent to outstanding range. It is from a novel and was originally released as `Kvinden I buret' and it has all the hallmarks to make it a corker of a film. In Danish, Swedish and a smattering of Arabic - with very good sub titles and is a film I can highly recommend.",1455235200,12,1427,3.9686411149825784
6775535,4,B00OW1PQ8E,"It's been several years since I read the first 'Department Q' book that this movie is based on, so I don't remember the book well enough to say that the movie followed it exactly.  That's neither here nor there...the movie is typical Nordic Noir with dark scenes and deeply conflicted characters, but I was completely caught up in the story and the characters' personalities.  A woman commits suicide...or does she?  A cop who has been banished to the cold cases dept. ('Q') starts a new investigation.  There is enough backstory to make the protagonists real without slowing down the flow.  Now I have to look for movies made from the other books in the series.
Warning:  must be played on All-Region player or computer.",1455148800,3,721,4.774193548387097
6775536,3,B00OW1PQ8E,The movie stopped suddenly and we could not start it again . We had to cancel and start all over again . This happened twice which was very frustrating since it is a crime thriller.,1495497600,,181,4.2

6775544,4,B00OW1PQ8E,Interesting foreign film that held our interest...a murder mystery that does a good job of bringing a different way of presenting a mystery...would of given it 5 stars but it does take place in Denmark you have to read the translation. would recommend it..interesting characters ..,1484870400,,281,5.130434782608695
6775545,5,B00OW1PQ8E,"This was an excellent police procedural mystery/thriller. Terrific story. Great acting. Believable characters. So much so, that the English sub-titles disappeared!",1484784000,,163,6.809523809523809
6775546,5,B00OW1PQ8E,This series never gets old.  I'm hooked!,1484697600,,40,4.714285714285714
6775547,4,B00OW1PQ8E,"Really well done thriller with great plot twists and well acted. I liked the differing perspective of a foreign culture on many issues like good and evil and immigration, if for no other reason than novelty. It has sub titles, so those who struggle with that format should take a pass. It's definitely a made-for-television budget film visually in comparison to what Americans are used to even with the garbage Hollywood throws at us and there are some areas that needed fleshing out or just be left out, but if you are looking for something that has a more pragmatic, nuanced perspective than the Hollywood sledgehammer gives, check it out.",1484524800,3,641,4.836363636363636
6775548,1,B00OW1PQ8E,This did not show it was subtitled.  I wasted my money,1484524800,,54,3.909090909090909

6775552,4,B00OW1PQ8E,"Easily overlooked modern film noir, which is a shame as the movie is excellent. If there were more films based on the series of books I'd like to watch them.",1483833600,,157,4.266666666666667
6775553,5,B00OW1PQ8E,Great! High suspense crime series. Loved it.,1483747200,,44,5.428571428571429
6775554,5,B00OW1PQ8E,"These two Danish detectives had me on the edge of my seat. I really appreciated the noir cinematography that balanced the story telling of this dark tale. For Carl the newly appointed chief of Dept. Q. is a man with a bleak outlook on life and his new partner is a man always hopefully. What they share is a passion for what all great fictional detectives seek. They prowl with relentless passion for truth, justice and the power to overcome any hurdle in their path to solve the case.",1483488000,,485,4.46067415730337
6775555,4,B00OW1PQ8E,Great entertainment! The film was exciting and the storyline compelling. I look forward to seeing the next movie in the series.,1483401600,,127,5.095238095238095

6775566,4,B00OW1PQ8E,"All three movies were good. If you like Foreign Crime Films - all three remind me of a mixture of the Red Riding Hood Trilogy mixed with The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Trilogy. What I Like about the Dept. of Q Trilogy is the films are all different stories, yet they are very interesting, very suspenseful & twist in various areas throughout the films, the acting is fantastic & I love that they make sure to answer any question that seems slightly confusing at times! There is nothing worse then to be introduced to some scene that make absolutely NO Sense! Definitely worth watching!",1471651200,,586,4.59047619047619
6775567,4,B00OW1PQ8E,"This movie is based on a book written by Jussi Adler-Olssen (Sp?) along with several others describing cases handled by Department Q. I thoroughly enjoyed all these books and was surprised to know that movies had been made based on them (3 so far). I found the movie versions, I watched 2 so far, to be excellent. They are, of course, in Danish with subtitles however, I have no problem when the content is as engrossing as this movie is. This is Nordic Noir, done well. In spite of the language difference I thought the acting was well done and the handling of the plot/story was faithful to the book. For the discerning viewer.",1470787200,,629,4.526315789473684

6775572,3,B00OW1PQ8E,"This would have been enjoyable if it had played the right way.  Instead I got the beginning scenes then it jumped to the end.  A total of 15 minutes for the whole movie.  I went back and replayed it and it was ok, but of course I already knew how it would end.  Not planning on renting any more Amazon videos.",1469577600,,309,4.016393442622951

6775575,5,B00OW1PQ8E,"Even though I've read the book and knew the ending, I was riveted. My only suggestion would be to make these for TV, then there is a better chance that more will be made. Films don't tend to go much beyond part 3 or 4.",1469232000,,218,3.8666666666666667

6775581,4,B00OW1PQ8E,Very well made and engaging.  Captures the feel of the book pretty well although there had to be a LOT of trimming to fit into a movie timeframe.  If you like the movies you should try the books.  Much more in depth look at characters and what drives them.,1467417600,,256,4.183673469387755

6775584,5,B00OW1PQ8E,"All of the Dept Q books are reading faves of mine and I'm thrilled to find them so well developed for the screen. In this first one, the characters of Carl and Assad are somewhat different - Carl is younger and more physically fit than I had imagined while reading, less charmingly crotchety; Assad less complex, less adorable, more assertive, more an equal to Carl - but both characters are great, actually superb, in the film. Otherwise, this first film closely follows the book: a terrific, fast paced thriller. Following the order of the books, The Keeper of Lost Causes is first, The Absent One is second, A Conspiracy of Faith is third.",1466726400,9,642,4.6902654867256635

8685111,5,B00OW1PQ8E,"Very, very well done adaptation of the book!  There is not much that they left out, and the acting is just perfect for the part.  The only thing I might change is that sometimes the English subtitles do not stand out enough from the background.
Recommend reading the book anyway.  It will make you appreciate the movie much more.",1509840000,,329,4.5423728813559325
8685112,1,B00OW1PQ8E,The movie was not in English and we hate movies we have to read (closed captions) while watching. So we did not watch it.

8685113,4,B00OW1PQ8E,"I listened to this CD on my trip from Massachusetts to Maryland, and from Maryland to New York State. The miles just flew by! I got into the story, which at first wasn't easy to do, because of the accent of the Danes, as well as life in and around Copenhagen, Denmark as subject matter, a place foreign to me. But the story took hold, and I was caught up into it.
The speaker did a great job bringing in men and women of various backgrounds, and supplying voices to them all!
But the story hold you, or it held me. Yes, there are parts which are too convenient, but that is true with any story of this ilk. The language was a bit rough, certainly not a CD for kids, but it is bearable.
Nice to learn about Danish life, social setting, and the like,
Truly a great story for a long trip!",1498953600,,785,4.103896103896104
