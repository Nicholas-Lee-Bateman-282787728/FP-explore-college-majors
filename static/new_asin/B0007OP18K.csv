8049624,5,B0007OP18K,"""Chinatown After Dark"" is one of those rare low budget B movies that hits all the bases. It was produced in 1931 by tiny Action Pictures Corporation which was near the bottom of the Poverty Row barrel. This Alpha release is watchable, but the print is a little choppy. Still, for the most part, the picture and sound are not bad.

Carmel Myers plays Madame Ying Su who owns a tea room in the mysterious, exotic Chinatown district of San Francisco. Her tea room is actually a front for the opium trade, prostitution, obtaining stolen property, you name it. Madame Su's accent is anything but Asian. It sounds somewhat like Russian, but that just adds to the fun of this film.

Rex Lease plays Jim Bonner, the hero who is out to find a Chinese dagger his brother was supposed to deliver to kindly old Lee Fong. In the process, Lee Fong is murdered, Jim's brother mysteriously disappears, and the dagger goes missing.

Fong's adopted daughter is ""Lotus"" played by the beautiful, petite Barbara Kent. She was the daughter of missionaries who were killed in China years before. So Lee Fong brought the infant to San Francisco, named her Lotus, and raised her as his own daughter.

In the meantime, Jim is accused of murdering Lee Fong and possibly his own brother in order to gain possession of the dagger and discover its secret. He is pursued by a bombastic detective played by the wonderful Billy Gilbert. Gilbert was the foil in countless Laurel and Hardy films.

While Jim is trying to clear his name, find the dagger, and pin Lee Fong's murder on Madame Su, he still has time to fall instantly in love with shy, innocent Lotus.

The dialogue in this film is fast paced and the actors give their all in every role, which makes this little Poverty Row opus one of those rare shoestring budget films that's both fun and entertaining.

One last note: Barbara Kent (""Lotus"") died on October 18, 2011 at the age of 103. She lived a full, rewarding life and appeared in many other films. She was one of the last surviving major stars to begin her career in silent films. Luckily for us, stars like Barbara Kent will continue to live through their work.",1320624000,6,2146,4.587467362924282
