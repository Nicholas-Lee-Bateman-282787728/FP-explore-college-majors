buy it when you can.",1354665600,,134,4.076923076923077
2293190,5,B0009IW8KS,"I purchased them like a tool for my classes. I am very happy because I have a lot of different points of views, excellent images and interesting stories. I recommend strongly this product!",1351296000,,188,4.7272727272727275
2293191,2,B0009IW8KS,"The 2 DVD,s on the life of Leonardo are woeful. They present 'pretty' images and make assumptions on his life which are irrelavant and ,based on other intensive reading,are inaccurate.
The volumes on ""The Dissenter'and ""The Scientist' both narrated by Ian Richardson are worthwhile. The remaining discs ('The Prinnce' and 'The Artist') are rambling and lack cohesion.
I cannot recommend this collection.",1344816000,10,403,5.516129032258065

8061349,4,B0009IW8KS,"I don't know why one must continue to say this to people who complain about 50-minute documentary films on well-researched and prolifically documented historical periods (e.g., the Renaissance) being too superficial, lacking in substance, fit only for high school, too conventional.  You only need half a brain and 5 minutes of reasonable thought to figure out that all one can expect, and all the filmmakers hope to spark in 50 minutes are a few tantalizing ideas that just might get viewers off the couch and into their public libraries to go deeper.  Id still be happy if such films only got them googling for more.

I have only just ordered this particular set, so I haven't seen how exactly it reproduces some/all of the episodes in that series called *Renaissance*.  But I am happy to find that it found its way to DVD, as I have access only to the series on VHS.  It was made for PBS in the 1990s and based on the book *Renaissance Lives* (1993) by Princeton Professor of History Theodore Rabb (now Emeritus).  Now, Rabbs work is the perfect example of mainstream, well-researched, widely-received, eminently readable, if conventional, academic histories of early modern Europe.  Ian Richardsons sonorous, Oxford-English-accented introductions to the episodes give the series away as intended to defend that view against the 25-year tsunami of postmodern, deconstructive, paradigm-shifting critiques of just such conservative, old-school histories as Rabb and his generation of historians write/wrote.

At the time of the PBS broadcast, I was teaching an undergraduate Cultural Studies course on the many intersections of misogyny and antisemitism in Western culture, and I used some of the episodes of *Renaissance* as introductions in the course unit on the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance.  Like all the films I used in my courses, this series provided young students, fed since birth on a diet of screen-delivered information and entertainment, with the visual jolt they need to get interested in a course unit that they might otherwise sit out in the campus pub.  Over the years, at least one student per term, and sometimes several, have fetched Rabbs book from the library and cited him in their essays, sometimes for his erudition, other times for what he leaves out.  When students start asking where the episodes/chapters called The Witch and The Court Jew are, you know the films have done at least some of the work for which youd screened them in class.

So for all the Amazon reviewers who love to fill up the webpages on documentary films with the blindingly obvious, get off your butts and read history books instead of expecting the 50-minute doc to feed you with everything you need to know on a historical period.",1481760000,,2743,5.0176211453744495
8061350,3,B0009IW8KS,These sure seem like the old documentatiers that we had in schoo and i graduated in 1966.  But they gave the information I was looking for but in a 'dry' format and the photography seems to be dated from that era as well.,1400716800,,221,4.1395348837209305
8061351,5,B0009IW8KS,"History is very much of interest to me as try to become more acquainted with pieces of history that I am not familiar.  It seems as time passes, what I have learned in the past has become fuzzy.  I like having references that I can restore sections of history that I should have remembered from my time in school.  Thanks for making this section of history available.",1398643200,,367,4.447761194029851
8061352,3,B0009IW8KS,I thought the mini series on Leonardo's life was outstanding.......It gave me a NEW OUTLOOK on how to approach life!!!!,1394236800,,119,5.0
8061353,3,B0009IW8KS,"I did learn a great deal about Leonardo da Vinci. My only complaint is the audio/video timing. I can't
tell whether it is bad lip syncing, or just poorly made. But that only pertains to the two DVD's on Leonardo.
The other four...are just fine, and are very informative as well. I enjoyed thoroughly.",1393200000,,300,4.574074074074074
8061354,2,B0009IW8KS,"I watched one segment, ""The Artist,"" and put the set on the shelf. ""The Artist,"" initially gave good background on Da Vinci and the period, but then only covered a few of his most influential works. Way too much was left out to get a decent picture of Da Vinci as an artist. Much time was spent on artists, such as Caravaggio, who live well after Leonardo and were not directly influenced by him. Additionally, production values were not outstanding. Not a good choice for learning about either Leonard or the period.",1392595200,2,517,4.630434782608695
8061355,3,B0009IW8KS,"The information is too general and superficial. A lot of words about the attitude to innovate but not enough about the actual innovations. The advantage of a DVD is that, when you do not understand something, you can rewind and watch again until you understand. Therefore I prefer more emphasis on the actual contribution of the personalities described. The level of the presentation should be above high school level. If it is well explained, it will eventually become understandable for everybody. Bad idea to have actors interpreting the attitude and thoughts of the personalities discussed; preferably to accompany the reading voice not with the image of an actor who does not look at all like the personality presented, but with pictures of the real appearance of the personality and images from the time that personality lived. I would also like to hear more about the thinking in the society and of the other artists and scientists of that time than to hear various people of our time talking in general about the pleasure and courage to come with a new idea, without any actual exemplification.",1379721600,5,1102,4.962162162162162
8061356,4,B0009IW8KS,"This was a good documentary,I loved the presentation of Da Vinci life the most. I wish they presented the rest of the information like they dead the life of the Leonardo. Anyway still worth it.",1369872000,,193,4.542857142857143
