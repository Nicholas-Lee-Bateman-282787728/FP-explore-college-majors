3499750,5,B001BWYT58,"Almost in the same league as Earthlings, this documentary takes a look at animal cruelty from a different angle -- that of those that risk their freedom and life to help those that are least able to defend themselves, non-human animals. Labeled as the #1 domestic terrorist organization by the FBI, the ALF, or Animal Liberation Front, is really not an organization that has any structure, making it very difficult for authorities to shut down. It is an abstract entity in which people that have compassion for all animals carry out their missions.

The documentary is graphic, for sure, but I believe it is the most effective way of communicating the message. Watch this film and be moved. Then if you have not had enough tears of pain, or redness because of anger, watch Earthlings (narrated by Joaquin Phoenix).",1219276800,14,814,4.856115107913669
3499751,5,B001BWYT58,"Some people think they're are heroes, some think they are terrorists, and others think they just some nuts. This DVD told me the REAL story of who they are and why they do what they do. No matter how you feel about them, you can't help but be amazed and inspired at the lengths these people are willing to go to for their beliefs, and some people  might just change their minds after watching this.",1218326400,12,398,4.306666666666667

8285040,5,B001BWYT58,"Terrific documentary. Very eye opening piece about the everyday oppression of animals but also that of the individuals legally or illegally fighting for them. What is done to animals in lab experiments for ""science"" is shocking. But what the government imposes on activists for simply standing up for what they believe in is even more shocking. Truly inspiring film and its a call to action for everyone who watches. Highly recommend!",1453680000,,434,5.126760563380282
8285041,5,B001BWYT58,Great watch.  Opens up the animal testing industry.  I don't recommend the raids but I do recommend these testing labs rehoming the animals with qualified rescue organizations such as Beagle Freedom Project. I don't agree with animal testing at and hope that someday soon they will use alternative methods that already have been proven effective.,1417651200,,346,5.2727272727272725

8285045,5,B001BWYT58,"This is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen!

Not only is it exciting but it is incredibly informational.

I never knew the animal liberation front were compassionate people
who save animals.

Thanks ARME!",1292457600,,216,4.944444444444445

8285047,5,B001BWYT58,"Their words are extremely powerful. If you want to understand the reality of the Animal Liberation Front and the humanity of those working within it, you can do no better than to watch this. It looks at the movement both in the UK and the US, and gives you not only interviews with activists withing the movement, but also footage liberated along with the animals during many of the ALF's raids.

It is also useful for any organizers to see how the movement is structured...or unstructured as the case may be. The ALF has a set of principles and anyone can form a chapter, carry out their own direct actions, and there is no communication between them. It really is an ingenious way of propagating the movement in the face of repression.

There were only two things that gave me pause on this film, the first is the beginning and ending footage of Martin Luther King, this comparison really bothers me. A lot. And the second was one of the women who went undercover in a lab, there's a weird screen behind her as she talks, but mostly it's because she fell in love with one of the monkeys because he was the most human...and that bothered me to.

But it's a great film, and a great introduction to the movements against animal cruelty, and a way to understand the importance of direct action in that movement.",1233792000,10,1309,4.514767932489452
