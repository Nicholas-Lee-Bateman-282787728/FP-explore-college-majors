8214152,5,B000UP880E,A great collection if you wish to know how Lina & Naga met. However the English voice actress for Lina is differnt at first it is a little offputting but it grows on you & the new voice actress really does sound like a younger Lina wich is fitting for the timeline,1360800000,2,264,4.096153846153846
8214153,5,B000UP880E,"Greetings;

As near as I can tell, there is actually another set on amazon that included both this title as well as the various movies for the slayers, but all the same, this was actually all I needed. I found it fairly well priced-as for the movies, all good I might add too, its just that I had actually found them in a local shop, used for fairly cheap a year or two back. I said this set was all I needed didn't it?

The voice acting that I have known and loved ^_^ The crazy Naga the serpent...I just remember it all being so much more...Naughty? Back when I was but a boy of um...15 which was how many years ago...Nevermind. Point is, it is good to have these on dvd at last ^^ I had honestly hoped they would have been a part of the movie set I bought way back when but I suppose that would have been asking for too much. I mean, all five or so...Five right? I think it was anyway, been a while...In the special box no less for just $10 was a decent buy. But for those of you out there not as fortunate as I, you may consider finding yourself the set entirely sold elsewhere, but if you wish to buy it up individually, perhaps save yourself some dosh, this too would be a fun way to go.

Thank you...

Oh but how could I forget? That one point that was just puzzling me when I was looking around for these. The actual episodes that are included here-two disks, two OVAs that have three episodes each to their names. The titles are as follows, for all of you who are considering upgrading to dvd from your older vhs copies of these;

Scary Chimera Plan
Jeffery's Knighthood
Mirror, Mirror
Labyrinth
A Frightening Future
Lina-Chan's Lovely Makeover Operation.

Just thought that might come in hand for those of you shopping around and not sure what might be included, like I was.

Again, Thank you...",1280707200,13,1805,4.275659824046921
8214154,4,B000UP880E,"Slayers is enjoyable in any of its video incarnations and the OVAs are no exception. Volume 2 is actually a compilation of both Slayers OVAs. I cannot say it is without fault; however, owing to the fact that the two discs in this set were made at different times with a long gap between them. The older of the two looks noticeably lower in quality in comparison to the newer disc which was released for the first time in 2007. Quality differences aside, the story lines are compelling, focused and funny, but best of all, it is the same price as Volume 1 which only contains the first disc. A worthy addition to any anime aficionado's collection.",1202428800,15,646,4.52991452991453
