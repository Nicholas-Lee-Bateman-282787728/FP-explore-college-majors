7944969,2,B00005M200,"This DVD package was a disappointment:  it contained no printed insert - not even a track list.  The English sub-titles are completely incompetent:  bad punctuation, misspellings, repeated titles, etc.  The performance is rather stodgy, with the entire production staged on a series of severely tilted platforms (perhaps symbolism of the unstable world in which the story is supposed to have taken place).  Singing was good, but not spectacular.  All-in-all not what I have come to expect from the Glyndebourne Festival.",1517702400,,520,5.4375

7944971,3,B00005M200,"I am a newcomer to opera and while I have loved every other Mozart opera that I have seen, this was my first disappointment.  Since watching Tito I have watched another English performance of a different Mozart work and was similarly unimpressed.  I don't have enough experience to tell if this is going to be a pattern.  The sopranos just did not connect with me the way they have done in other presentations.  It was fun to see so many male roles played by women but it was also somewhat disconcerting making me believe that the opera company was short on talent.  I am just initiated to the wonder of Mozart's works and I want to give it all 5 stars because of the composer.  This particular performance just missed the mark.  I do intend to check out other Titos by other opera companies.",1398988800,,792,4.458333333333333
7944972,5,B00005M200,"La Clemenza di Tito was not Mozart's last opera, it was Die Zauberflote. By the time Mozart attended the premier of this opera in September of 1791 in Prague, Die Zauberflote was already half complete. Mozart completed it after his return to Vienna late September 1791. The fact that La Clemenza is cataloged K-621 in he Kchel catalog and Die Zauberflote K-620 it doesn't mean La Clemenza was the last one Mozart composed. Chronological order of his works was frequently inaccurately cataloged by Kchel and by later editions.",1375488000,,525,4.9772727272727275
7944973,2,B00005M200,"My main complaint here is that it is often hard to tell what is going on. Is someone a king or something? What's his problem? There was a nice production at the Met recently, though, so that should become available online.",1365379200,,222,4.439024390243903
7944974,4,B00005M200,"La Clemenza Di Tito, a Mozart opera that seems rarely seen, is an opera seria in two acts.  The opera was commissioned to pay tribute to the emperor, who had recently abolished torture and the death penalty.  Mozart was happy to oblige, and certainly paints Tito in the appropriate light.  Philip Langridge portrays Tito as a sensitive and concerned ruler, with strong loyalties and the strength to forgive wrongs done to him, and it is easy to feel his sense of betrayal and respond to his struggle for what-to-do next.  Mr. Langridge deftly portrays the inner conflict that Tito experiences when he discovers that one of his trusted advisors has tried to kill him (Sesto does this for the love of Vitellia, enjoyably and evilly played by Ashley Putnam).  Sesto is played by Diana Montague, and her angst and lovely voice really draw the viewer in - she does a fantastic job on ""Parto, ma tub en mio"".  It is easy to understand why this production was so popular in the early 1990's.

The Glyndebourne Chorus sounds great, and Andrew Davis leads the London Philharmonic Orchestra.  The Harpsichord continuo is performed by Joyce Fieldsend, and it is spritely and playful and really adds to the overall positive feel of the opera.  The sets themselves are rather minimalist, but that serves this production well as the focus should be on the emotions depicted on-stage.  And while this is not an opera that clamors to be seen again and again, it is certainly one that should be seen and experienced with a fine cast, and this production definitely fits the bill.  Recommended.",1313280000,,1576,4.8
7944975,5,B00005M200,"My understanding is that Mozart began composing La Clemenza di Tito after he'd started The Magic Flute but finished Clemenza first, and that this is why there's disagreement over whether Clemenza or Flute is his last opera. No matter, we're just so fortunate that Mozart squeezed in this little opera seria gem before he died. Lean, with sublime vocal and instrumental music, and with forgiveness as its theme, Clemenza is very moving.

This production has a superb cast. Philip Langridge is touching as the troubled Tito, who naively wants to rule with love, not power, but at least in the end can use that power to grant forgiveness all around. Ashley Putnam has a strong stage presence as the cunning Vitellia. Her aria, ""Non piu di fiori,"" where she duets with the basset horn, is stunning. Diana Montague is excellent as Sesto. The beautiful wind accompaniment in Sesto's aria ""Parto, ma tu ben mio,"" is one of the highlights of the production.

And then we have the love duet, ""Ah perdona al primo affetto,"" beautifully performed by Elzbieta Szmytka and Martine Mahe. It is sweet and tender and understated and, typically Mozart, is not even written for the lead characters. Ending with ""Banish from life, all that is not love,"" it may be the last love duet he left for us.",1146009600,14,1279,4.782805429864253
7944976,4,B00005M200,"This is a beautiful opera, one that lovely melodies and a concise story line make easy to appreciate. To be fair, there are signs that Mozart was rushed. Some of the secondary arias are shorter than what's found in the great comedies. Many numbers lack the musical variety found in even lesser pieces from Figaro, Don Giovanni and such. This isn't to say those works are without baggage-they aren't. Masetto's aria (for instance) is a second rate song at best. Mostly though, more attention seems to have given to the supporting roles in the larger works. The original secco recitatives for this opera are a sore point as well. Mozart assigned the work to a pupil, probably Franz Anton Sssmayr. They're a string of duds, and that's being nice. John Eliot Gardiner recorded Tito around the same time this production was filmed and trimmed most of them. The people in charge here found somebody who cared about what he was doing and paid to have a new set written.
The result was well worth the effort. Stephen Oliver's recitatives provide this opera with something that compliments it and carries the action well. Having something like this done was long overdue. Tito contains some of the most beautiful music Mozart wrote. Yes, many numbers are shorter than usual. That's fine as they fill the  psychological needs of their characters while also preventing their musical phrases from being overplayed. There isn't a weak link in the cast. Yes, Titus is a one dimensional paragon of goodness. Yet, when you watch Philip Langridge perform ""his music"" it's easy to believe a man can be like that. Diana Montague and Martine Mah are superb as Sextus and Annio. There's one complaint and it's a minor one. These ladies look too feminine to forget that they're a pair of (very) attractive women. Peter Rose does well in the role of Publius. Elzbieta Szymytka is ravishing as Servilla. Her voice has that lovely crystalline quality so well suited to Mozart's work. Ashley Putnam is great! The role of Vitellia contains an emotional kaleidoscope and she delivers one. She is jealous and passionate, loving and ruthless, proud and then humbled all at once. Her music, particularly ""Non Piu di Fiori, is fiendishly difficult. Some passages almost call for a soprano with mezzo-soprano's lower range. There are two instances where the music finds her limit but in both instances she recovers quickly. The sets are odd as are some of the camera angles. They suit the action though, and better yet, don't interfere with it. The subtitles are clear (though sometimes off centre) and contain a few typos (""epress""?) but give far more detail than what's found in most productions. New viewers will appreciate that.
This is an excellent production, one that's great for lovers of opera and for those new to opera.
Ah, Perdona Al Primo Affetto
This duet deserves mention on its own merits. It is one of the most perfect and beautiful gems imaginable. The first recording I heard was sung by Frederica von Stade and Lucia Popp under the baton of Sir Colin Davis. The emotional reaction it set off then was uncontrollable. To this day it usually has that effect. This is one of those pieces where beauty doesn't fade or wither with familiarity. Each time you listen there's a new detail to appreciate. The vocal lines are sublimely gentle, each note a caressing touch. The scoring is a miracle of transparent clarity. When performed as it is here, this is a model for what music can be. It touches the heart, caresses the emotions and makes you think about the beauty man can aspire to. To have it performed the way Martine Mah (Annio), Elzbieta Szymytka and Andrew Davis have done it is worth the price of the entire disc.",1080604800,26,3704,4.80564263322884
7944977,2,B00005M200,"Sets and costumes are minimal, little more than limbo sets enhanced with lighting.  Andrew Davis's conducting is slow paced, dry, lacking in nuance or excitement.  Technical quality of picture and sound, however, are excellent.  If you must have a DVD version of this opera, go ahead and purchase.  Otherwise, better to wait for the filmed version, with the Wiener Philharmoniker, James Levine conducting, directed by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle. So much more exciting visually and musically, with principals Tatiana Troyanos, Carol Neblett, Catherine Malfitano, Anne Howels, Eric Tappy and Kurt Rydl.  Hopefully this version will be released on DVD soon, and worth waiting for.  Otherwise, try and get a used copy on LD or simply order on VHS!

Update:  I see that the Ponnelle filmed version is in fact now available so I recommend that as the better option!",1005091200,24,853,5.175182481751825
7944978,5,B00005M200,"It's nice to see that Mozart's operas are showing up more on DVD, especially such lesser known works as Clemenza di Tito--Mozart's last opera.  This is an enjoyable and well sung production, with lots of bright colors that are very eye catching.  The sound and picture are excellent, and as this was the first time I have ever SEEN this opera, it made me appreciate it all the more. The singers, while not all household names, are well chosen; they not only sing well but they act well and have excellent stage presence. This is a quality production that deserves to be seen.",998524800,16,575,4.572815533980583
