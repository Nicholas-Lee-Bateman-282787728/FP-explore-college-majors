7954439,5,B00005U2ET,"Wai Lan's yoga series is just GREAT! In this series she really works your body and challenges your mind. She does this with grace, expertly. She takes her time walking us through each advanced pose, turning you upside down, streching and twisting your body, giving directions for simplified poses, until we are able to accomplish the full pose itself. All of her yoga videos focus on breath, posture, concentration and meditation. It is a fully intergrated program of total awareness. If you are not aware of the postures that you assume, you miss out on the functions that are taking place within you. It is truly amazing. I can not recommend this and her other programs, easy and intermediate series, enough. This is the only yogic program that I follow, as Wai Lana achieves not only in building muscles and toning your body, but toning the functions of your body and your mind. She brings you peace and really teaches you how to meditate. She does this in the most subtle of ways. A few weeks after starting her programs, whether beginner, intermediate or advanced, you will find that you are able to quiet your troubled mind in a moments notice. Truly a gifted teacher, truly a wonderful set. Enjoy...",1266019200,5,1206,4.747619047619048
7954440,5,B00005U2ET,"Fun is definately the word when talking about this tape!  It's challenging yet fun, and you can feel good about having a great workout that is not too strenous, plus it's relaxing.  Have fun!",1220832000,,191,4.588235294117647
7954441,5,B00005U2ET,"Like all her previous series, Fun Challenge is just wonderful.  It is not the traditional approach to Yoga.  None of the tapes start off with traditional Yoga warmups, no sun saluatations and warrior poses, moving through other standing poses and then going to the floor.  This lack of a warm up may be their only draw back. I personally love the way they start out with floor poses but I think it might be a good idea to do something at least mildly aerobic before jumping into these more challening poses. I think you may get even more out of these wonderful tapes this way.  A brief walk, jog, or even just a few of your own sun salutations or whatever warm ups you favor would be perfect and then just glide into Wai Lana's soothing yoga world! As always the scenery is inspring, Wai Lana is a beautiful butterfly in her delightlful costumes and her cueing is gentle and always right on target. Her music is awesome too! All 3 tapes are fantastic but there is a lovely surprise at the end of the ""Burn Off"" tape, instead of the usual seated meditation there is ""yoga dancing""  Meditation in motion! The tapes are between 45 and 55 minutes a piece which makes for the feeling of full workout.  The poses are accessable to someone who is advanced beginner or intermediate and of course you can always modify. There are just not enough great things to say! Love it!",1047168000,10,1366,4.465863453815261
