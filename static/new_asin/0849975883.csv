171564,3,0849975883,"slow start, was hard to keep children interested,Was really disappointed because I have read alot of Sheila Walsh's books expected much more",1296864000,,140,5.409090909090909
171565,1,0849975883,"This series would be great for any ""religious person"", but if you want to read to your children to pass on Christian truths, this book is not a good choice.

Shelia Walsh has a great goal - to use a fictional story to portray the love that God has for each one of us.  One is reminded of Pilgrim's Progress and The Chronicles of Narnia. She even mentions Pilgrim's Progress in the forward.  Sadly, she fails in accomplishing her goals.  She fails because she fudges on Biblical themes.

First, God is portrayed as ""The Great White Tiger"", which sounds like a number of non-Christian religions I can think of.  If you are into Eastern or Native American religions I think you will be quite comfortable reading this book!  But I thought the language she adopted confuses kids on the nature of God.

Secondly, in this series, ""The Great White Tiger"" does not sacrifice anything for love.  The Christian faith centers around the work of the Son of God who gave Himself as a substitute for sinful people.  The Bible answers the question, ""How do we know God loves us?"" with the statement ""[God] loved us and sent his Son to be an atoning sacrifice for our sins.""  By the way, the series denies the existence of sin (calling it a bad influence) and misses the true problem of our children's hearts.

The love in the book rings hollow when the characters get themselves into trouble, yell out a prayer, and ""The Great White Tiger"" answers by sending one of his minions to help.  No sacrifice on his part.  It is the hollow love of a millionaire giving a dollar to a beggar.

The Biblical theme that is missing is the sacrifice that God made in sending His own Son to die.  Any book that leaves out redemptive and sacrificial themes cannot truly be called a Christian book, the kind of sacrifice we see in good fiction like ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"".

The books are not especially good either.  The characters names were complicated and the story uninspiring.  I became tired of hearing how ""cool"" the characters were.

But the worst part about this series was that it masquerades as a Christian series when it is not.  It gives a poor picture of God, a hollow view of love, and a distorted view of human nature.

You may say, it is just a kids book, but I say that I want my kids to be connected with important truths.  I believe the truth will set them free.  Walsh tried to make God's love understandable, and instead makes love a petty thing by removing the concept of sacrifice.

I have never written a negative review of a children's book before and am saddened that I have to.  I like most of the books I read to my kids, even the majority of the non-Christian ones, but these ones were so bad I felt I had to write.

Please, authors, write good Christian books, write good secular books, but don't try to mishmash them together, it makes bad and confusing reading!",1191801600,2,2878,4.474088291746641
171566,5,0849975883,"I used the series on Wednesday nights at church last year.  The kids (K-2nd grade) loved them.  A couple of weeks ago, a third grader asked what was happening with the Great White Tiger.  During the year, I'd see kids out at various places and they would beg me to tell them what was going to happen next.  Those incidences speak for themselves.  I wish Ms. Walsh would write another book to go along with this wonderful series.",1133136000,,428,4.435897435897436
171567,5,0849975883,"This book is wonderful. I bought it for my 4 year-old and 7 year-old nieces. They loved it. After I read it to them, I bought another copy and took it to church so that I could read it to my Sunday school class. The children were so enthralled, sitting quietly so that they could hear the story and see the pictures! My nieces and my sunday school students recognized that the Great White Tiger was God immediately.",1111881600,,415,4.333333333333333

7793164,5,0849975883,"I have always loved Sheila Walsh.  She said once that she began her children's books because of her son.  It's obvious that she is a Momma, and knows boys well.  Great lessons while keeping the boys intrigued, begging for more.",1375401600,,227,4.625
7793165,2,0849975883,"My daughter LOVED the book of the same name that I got her.  So I thought the movie would be the same- Nope.  It seems cheesy and a little hokey.  Not very well produced.  We've only watched it once, and my daughter does not care to watch it again.  The meaning of the story line is great, but the book does a much better job of portraying it than the movie does.  Also, the storyline differs between the two.",1366761600,,409,4.113924050632911
