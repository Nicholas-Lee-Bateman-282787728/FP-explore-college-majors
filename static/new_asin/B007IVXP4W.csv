5090130,1,B007IVXP4W,"I've seen better acting in porn films. The effects are lame. I did not like the way it was filmed. The camera man is all over the place. It's pretty much an indie film. An unknown cast. I'll be selling my copy. You might like Robotropolis, Cowboys & Vampires which again are similar. Better to see Outpost, War Of The Dead, Dead Snow. Might give Dead Mine a look.",1378252800,,363,4.27536231884058
5090131,3,B007IVXP4W,This flick isn't one of what I would characterize as a top 10 blockbuster.  Just another day w/the Nazis.  I would say this is not memorable to be honest.  Save your money.,1375401600,,172,4.3125
5090132,1,B007IVXP4W,"This is an indie film that attempts to sell itself by using the words, ""Nazi"" and ""Zombie"" in the title together. It really is not a Nazi zombie film. The US government wants to shut down a project by that name. It sends in a group of military men to destroy the lab. only to meet with zombies.

The film sounds better than what it is. The acting was dry. The script was horrible. The special effects, weren't. They did but a red filter on the camera lens once and that was about as good as it got. Not worth a free view.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1374969600,,564,4.118181818181818
5090133,1,B007IVXP4W,Was this someone's senior project in college?  I could of made this movie on my phone!  Sorry to tell it like it is but dang!,1373155200,2,125,3.96
5090134,1,B007IVXP4W,"This is an extremely low budget movie, with terrible actors, and no real plot.  It looks like it was filmed in one day at they're backyard. Don't waste your time.",1370390400,2,162,4.4
5090135,2,B007IVXP4W,this movie was bad I mean I thought when I saw the title it meant that these army or navy or armed forces would take on a whole hord of Nazi zombies like the title says and it didn't the story line sucked it was to predictable and the ending was horrible I was generous when I rated this movie 2 stars out of 5,1361750400,4,310,3.7846153846153845
5090136,1,B007IVXP4W,"This is the second worst film I've seen (the first being an appalling indie Sherlock Holmes movie). Not only does the packaging and title seriously mislead (not a Nazi zombie in sight, just a lame link to World War II biological weapons. I guess it's a good way to save on Nazi uniforms, though), but the film fails on every level. The editing is haphazard, a jumble of almost random shots that confuse the hell out of the audience. Lighting is virtually non existent, sound appears to have been recorded live with no thought about audibility, dialogue is a long litany of cliches and the actors only light up when they are smoking cigarettes (there's a lot of smoking acting in the film, presumably because someone told the director this adds depth to the characters).",1351728000,2,769,4.703703703703703
5090137,2,B007IVXP4W,"I must have fallen asleep or went into a coma, but the movie was really lacking any Zombies, Nazi's or Acting or Plot or..........  well you get the picture.  This movie was really really lame, if your looking for a good zombie or Nazi or anything movie then this is ""not"" the movie to watch, now if your looking for a movie to put you to sleep real quick then watch it, Heck it is better than Valium.",1347148800,2,401,4.128205128205129
5090138,2,B007IVXP4W,"This movie was a stinker. The cast's acting was wooden and their voices sounded like they were talking into cups. The tiny, framed screen was also highly annoying. There was no climax to this movie and I ended up not caring if anyone survived or not. Most of the killing comes within the first fifteen minutes of the movie and much of it is caused by the ""elite"" unit of commandos sent to do...something? I was however entertained by the guy with the golden curly perm. It's a shame they made him a red shirt. Don't bother with this movie, it's a waste of time and money.",1337817600,10,571,4.345794392523365
5090139,4,B007IVXP4W,"This is in that `Zombie Nazi' genre niches,That is so beloved by geeks of all ages.

Really an awesome film,There I said it,That shouldn't have set on shelf for almost a dozen years.

The cast was really good,Especially O'Malley (John Weidemoyer),Hey wasn't there a Ken Weiderhorn involved with SHOCK WAVES,A coincidence, We think not.

Seriously Brain Damage has a winner on its hands,After watching Air Collision and Tales Of An Ancient Empire,I needed to clean my viewing palette with something good,Not Great like O:NZ is !

Wow,Look there is an evil plot on American soil to repeat a Nazi experiment on a town of 122 extras...Townspeople.

Kudos,Yippee and thanks to all involved in this addition to a fun genre",1333497600,2,716,4.983193277310924
5090140,1,B007IVXP4W,"super horrible. No nazis, inaccurate uniforms and half the people are generals.. one guy even have a goatee and is supposed to be general?? The framing was horrible and indicative of someone on their first project. The sound editing was horrible and muffled, the acting was the stuff you are supposed to learn NOT to do in acting. The framing again lots of super close ups because it's supposed to be dramatic ..again first timer type of thing. This is a z rated movie not even b",1426809600,,479,4.517241379310345

5090142,1,B007IVXP4W,"This is probably one of the not so good horror zombie movies. The acting is just plain bad, the costumes look like they were dug out of a 13 year old's halloween costume stash, and its just plain unrealistic. I'm guessing the budget on this movie was only about $200-$500, based on the terrible special effects and the lack of proper zombie slaughtering weaponry. There's a youtube channel that can do better special effects than this on only a $40 budget, these people should go look that guy up. But seriously, unless you want awkward lines, bad acting, bad scenery, bad plot, and bad effects, this is a dud. You could do much better watching a movie like Smiley, even though that one is bad, too.",1407628800,,699,4.555555555555555
5090143,1,B007IVXP4W,very boring don't bother wasting your time with this movie.,1404777600,,59,5.0
5090144,1,B007IVXP4W,"This is possibly the worst movie ever.  And it's not so bad that it's good, it's not campy, it's just crappy.  The wardrobe was horrible the acting, writing, direction, audio, and everything was a mess.  White uniforms on a mission, with balaclavas, pistols, and one shotgun.  The good part is that the shotgun does not need to be reloaded except for that one time when the guy needed to die. No fire discipline, no discipline in the ranks and the wise old black sergeant gets snookered by the crazy dude.  Give this one a pass unless you are looking for an example of what not to do in a film or life.  Does she even meet the minimum height requirement?",1401494400,3,654,4.408333333333333
5090145,4,B007IVXP4W,My reviews are not the most objective because i like low budget horror/sci-fy movies (the cheesier the better ! ),1397865600,,113,4.7
5090146,1,B007IVXP4W,"My girlfriend and I couldn't even make it more than 5 consecutive minutes, and we were actively looking for a campy zombie flick. Video looks like it was filmed on a cell phone, Was kind of fun skipping around to random parts of the movie betting on the clip being either ""dude in beret dramatically smoking"" or ""other dude making rapist eyes at nothing""",1395705600,,354,4.546875
5090147,2,B007IVXP4W,I couldn't get through this movie. Not worth wasting any of your time waiting for the first zombie to show up.,1395446400,,110,4.285714285714286
5090148,5,B007IVXP4W,"This movie was really misunderstood.  When it was first made in 1999 it was at the height of the SOV movie era and was far ahead of most of the junk that was being shot on video back then.  It may look terrible to people looking at it in 2015 but that is like looking at old photographs and saying you don't like them because they are grainy or in Black & White.  I actually heard some young punk say ""Night of the Living Dead"" was ""dated"" because it was Black & White.  Really?  Is this what we've come to?  Doesn't anyone who likes anything actually write a review or is it only the people who have nothing nice to say.  This movie has a great story and is fun to watch if you don't take it seriously.  Maybe stay up late, eat a lot of junk and have a beer or six and you might just have some fun with an old SOV movie like ""Operation: Nazi Zombies"" aka ""Maplewoods""  takes be back to the 90s when there were still things like video stores and when people actually talked to each other face to face with that ""dated"" idea called interpersonal communications.  All in all, just have fun with this.  I did.",1393200000,,1106,4.145539906103286

8518028,1,B007IVXP4W,I usually like any zombie movie and am not too harsh a critic. But the story here stinks. The acting is subpar. The filmography is poor. In short - do not watch this movie.,1496448000,,172,4.088235294117647
8518029,1,B007IVXP4W,"Not even decent by Zombie B-movie standards.  I thought the acting was OK for the genre but this nasal-passage offending turd failed in almost every other aspect.  First, the wardrobe wasn't even close to what a military unit would wear into a hot zone.  White shirts with berets; really?  The load-out  consisted of a shotgun, a few handguns, and a knife.  The ending did have some audio of automatic gunfire.",1489622400,,410,4.785714285714286
8518030,1,B007IVXP4W,"I'd give it zero stars if I could. Soooo stupid. A Major General in his late 20's or early 30's? ""Special Forces"" troops dressed like idiots on a covert mission in white shirts? And the acting is the worst imaginable! It's just BAD!",1482969600,,232,4.4186046511627906
