7932731,4,B000056VQG,"This is an intermediate level tape about fighting mainly with handguns, but shotguns, rifles and submachine guns are discussed also. The tape is sequel to Stanfords' Fighting with firearms, but you don't necessarily need to have seen it, as long as you know the basics of shooting and weapon handling.
In the film, Stanford covers a wide variety of topics, like the dynamic isosceles grip/stance, combat drawstroke from variety of carry modes, transitions from shoulder weapons to handgun, and firearms as impact weapons (total 13 chapters). The main problem of the film lies in its' diversity. As there are so many topics, there is not enough time to handle any of the issues adequately. In fact, there are several interesting topics, that could be published in separate training film. But still, you'll probably learn some new tricks even with this hurried presentation.
The quality of the production is of good standard, but not exceptionally so. There are two sequences where lighting was not very good (those were night shooting sequences, but still it would be nice to see Stanfords' face when he is talking to camera), and in one sequence there was some echo on the sound. Otherwise the picture and sound quality are both good.
Overall, this is a very good film, and the only downside is that there is too much material for the length of the tape. If this were a two or three tape series, each tape being 60-90 minutes long, this could very well be worth 5 stars.
