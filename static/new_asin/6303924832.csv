727237,1,6303924832,"There are some people who try to reclaim 'Nadja' - along with Abel Ferrera's 'The Addiction', the most stultifyingly pretentious film ever made, bludgeoning the audience with Wim Wenders-like globs of pseudo-philosophical gabble and supposedly 'arty' screes of visual incoherence - by suggesting it is comic.  Making humour of what, exactly?  Of horror films?  You have to know what horror films do before you can mock them, and director Almedeyra hasn't a clue.  American indie films?  Probably, but it replicates that mind-numbing mindset so faithfully, it forgets to be funny about it.  Students, whose existential angst and elevated notions of 'beauty' find expression in My Bloody Valentine records?  Definitely.  Elena Lowenstein as Dracula's daughter is so gorgeous in her designer Grim Reaper cape, she may even replace Death from 'The Seventh Seal' as my iconic nightmare of choice.",997833600,,891,5.405797101449275
727238,5,6303924832,"This is a flick I'd recommend to two types: the vampire movie fan, and the indie movie fan. For indie fans, they have much originality to expect from the raw style and small budget of Nadja. It is shot with a simple digital camera and uses pixelated effects. The acting is solid. Elina Lwensohn, who plays Nadja, is brilliant. The script is fresh, despite the parallels with the original Dracula.
For vampire fans, Nadja is a must-see movie. That is, unless you prefer recycled goth-style renditions of the vampire story repeated over and over. Nadja is one of the few *modern* vampire movies that does not incorporate a form of martial arts fighting. There is a somber, crisp mood reflected from both the black and white digital film and the character script. It is a modern and fresh story which remains true to the character motives and rarely duplicated creepiness (though many have tried) of Bram Stocker's classic novel Dracula. You'll also find hidden humerous remarks throughout the film referencing aspects of 'dracula culture'.
Also, the dark theme of the music in the film (from such artists as Portishead) adds to the emotional effect the director has intended.",979776000,9,1173,4.929292929292929
727239,4,6303924832,"The film is told as a series of visuals. Shot entirely in black and white, the film goes from startling clarity in some scenes to gritty, pixelated imagery. The imagery at times takes over the movie, and as much as I liked this film, there were some sequences of overlapping imagery that I fast-forwarded. Over all a good film, and it reminds me a lot of Lili Taylor's film ""The Addiction,"" so I can see where the parallels are drawn comparing this movie to that one. This one I can say has more interesting characters and better cinematography, though Annabella Sciorra's cameo in ""The Addiction"" is not to be missed. Cool, and definitely very weird at times, but a neat take on the vampire myth. Here Dracula's children come to America to claim his body when he is dead and the brother looks on while his sister routinely seduces, then feeds on men she meets in bars. Peter Fonda is the only name I recognized on the cast and he is amusing as Van Helsing. The majority of the people are unknown, but Elina Lowensohn is well-cast and superb as Nadja and the one who stands out the most in this film. Compared to tiresome vampire flicks like ""Dracula 2000"" that are being released this film is a breath of fresh air and features a cool soundtrack with Portishead.",978480000,3,1263,4.5196506550218345
727240,3,6303924832,"you don't need to like vampires one bit to enjoy this movie.  if you dig hal hartley movies, especially his number one actor Martin Donovan who plays a lead role as a small-time boxer, then this flick is a must see.  what caught me off gaurd was the peculiar dialogue which seems to be a  clear rip-off of hartley's own awkward style.  elina lowesohn, another  hartley favorite, plays a superb role as dracula's daughter.  the only  downer was the over-use of the toy camera pixellation scenes where lowesohn  feeds on her prey.  but overall, this b&w digital movie has a good  plot, excellent cinematography, and decent acting.  i walked away from it  without any sense of enlightenment, but definitely a smile.",959299200,3,712,4.793388429752066
727241,3,6303924832,"Rich in metaphors, the noveau style of Nadja makes viewing it worthwhile.  Whereas other low budget films of this genre tend to over-do the blood and gore aspects of the vampiric lifestyle, director Almereyda foregos that  method, opting instead to delve into the psychological issues which must  haunt an individual who is forced to spend eternity wandering the night and  feeding on humans.  His play on the ever-present human aspects of the  vampire characters makes for interesting viewing, especially when you  contrast the vampire Edger, who seeks to live a ""normal""  existence with the woman he loves even if it costs him his life, and Nadja,  who accepts her lot and attempts to ""be all she can be"" while  still ""mourning"" the death of her beloved (or possibly not so  beloved) father at the hand of Dr. Van Helsing (Fonda).
As a point of  criticism, the final clash between the two vampire twins Nadja and Edgar is  somewhat anti-climatic.  The buildup left you desiring to see more of a  struggle or something, leaving you with a feeling betrayal, asking yourself  the question, ""Was that all?""  Another weak area was the  filmography during the shots where Nadja attacks her victims.  It seems too  psychadelic, as Almereyda changes the camera film speed and focus, filming  the scenes through a filter in order to provide a ""special  effect.""  It seemed he was attempting to capture something sensual,  almost sinister, with the moment.  However, it failed.  All it did for me  was become a tad irritating after the first occurence, and soon I found  myself longing for a little old fashioned fangs and gore.  However, the  choice of b&w versus color for the film was excellent, allowing the  director the opportunity to splice in vintage Bela Lugosi images during  episodes when Nadja reflects on her departed father.
Overall, Nadja is  definitely worth viewing.  I recommend only the most die hard vampire fans  purchase it, as most ""normal"" fans will find the movie  unimpressive, the plot slow, and the ""special effects"" primitive.",955324800,6,2047,4.970326409495549
727242,5,6303924832,"Today (01/16/2000), people are beginning to pay a bit more attention to low budget movies, usually because they are good. Take attention to ""Blair Witch Project"", even if it's a true story or not, it moved  thousands of person to the cinema, not just because of the story, but also  because it's autheticy, realness and thecnic. As for ""Nadja"" it's  the same, as it is a incredibly real, with its low-budget-yet-fantastic  scenes, proving you can make an excellent film with just a few money.

727243,5,6303924832,"This arthouse vampire film from the very talented Michael Almerayda is a wonderfully offbeat, loose retelling of the Dracula story, except that here, the focus is on the title character, the daughter of the famous  Count.  The setting is updated to New York's East Village, given a  positively Transylvannian feel by the terrific black and white photography.  Themes of existential identity questions, and dysfuctional, incestuous  family relationships (both among the humans and vampires) run throughout  the film, and there is a lot of clever, dry humor as well.  The humor  doesn't detract from the lush, earie atmosphere, though, or from the subtle  and beautiful erotic mood centered around Nadja's relationship with a  young, married woman, who's uncle-in-law, by the way, just happens to be a  crazy, alcoholic who knows about vampires, and just happens to be named Van  Helsing (Peter Fonda is terrifically wierd and funny in the part).  The  rest of the cast is superb too, especially Hal Hartley veterans Elina  Lowensohn as Nadja and Martin Donovan as Najda's lover's befuddled husband.  Galaxy Craze, an actress I'd never seen before, is mesmerizing as Nadja's  human love, Lucy.  ""Nadja"" is the best of Almerayda's films to  date, but also worth checking out is his recent variation on the Mummy  theme, ""The Eternal"", and his earlier film ""Twister""  (not the flying cows movie).  ""Nadja"" is, by the way, my personal  pick for all-time favorite vampire movie.",939772800,3,1472,5.170212765957447
727384,4,6303924832,"Let's make this easy.

If you liked Habit, with all its digressions and character portraits and the director playing coy over whether the vampire is a real vampire, or just part of some alcohol-fueled paranoid delusion...then you will probably not like Nadja.

Nadja is a vampire flick, in that it's all about vampires, and it's apparent that these are the blood-sucking REAL vampires of classic vampire stock, in that they don't wring their hands and moan and cry a lot just because there MIGHT be something morally questionable about tapping somebody's vein and treating fellow humans as prey.

Elina Lwensohn is superb.  As a result of seeing this film I wonder if the actress herself may have the real vampiric power to dominate people's minds.  And Peter Fonda does an excellent job as a latter-day Van Helsing, who, (thank you, God!) is more an eccentric intellectual on a mission than the ridiculous action-hero seen in films not featuring Peter Cushing.

Overall, Nadja is deliciously eerie and definitely a must-see for any fan of the genre.

Visually beautiful with a gorgeous, haunting soundtrack, the movie has the potential to be a pretentious art house flick but avoids it through the occasional use of dead-pan mundane lines that are side-splitting by their incongruous placement in this striking vampire flick.  When I saw this movie in the theater with my friend, we were the only ones laughing at the funny bits at first - not until later on in the movie did other people seem to catch on.

The use of the grainy Fisher Price camera for some of the horror sequences is nothing short of genius.

727389,4,6303924832,"Most vampire movies are all about blood, evil, mayhem, and big jutting fangs that could never actually fit in their mouths.

Fortunately ""Nadja"" never falls into the usual vampire cliches. Instead it focuses on blood, fuzz and the dark snowy streets of Manhatten, and the vampires that wander through it after Dracula's death. Though it occasionally stumbles on pretension, Michael Almereyda's direction and Elina Lwensohn's ethereal Nadja turn this into a quiet gem.

Dracula is dead. His daughter Nadja (Lwensohn) senses it immediately, and pledges to ""start over,"" although Renfield (Karl Geary) is skeptical. As she wanders through New York, Jim (Martin Donovan) springs his eccentric uncle Van Helsing (Peter Fonda) from jail and gets a pep talk on Dracula and his past. But they don't know that Jim's unhappy wife Lucy (Galaxy Craze) is meeting the beguiling Nadja at a club, and the two of them end up having a brief lesbian tryst.

But that encounter with Nadja is slowly transforming Lucy into another zombielike slave, even as the lovely vampire heads to Brooklyn to meet her dying twin brother Edgar (Jared Harris). But when Van Helsing and Jim try to try to stop Nadja, her vampiric nature is fully reawakened -- and now Van Helsing, Jim and Edgar must stop her before

Technically ""Nadja"" is a remake of an old sequel to ""Dracula,"" and a few parts of the newer movie show its origins. But other than that, it's pretty much a unique piece of work -- and while the art-house approach gets a little pretentious (that ridiculous story about butter) its haunting beauty is undeniable.

Michael Almereyda takes an uber-realistic approach for this movie -- it's filmed in crisp black-and-white, with lots of stark lighting, shadowed apartments, and the occasional blurry blood/sex scene. The dialogue varies between plain and poetic (""I was born by the Black Sea, under the shadow of the Carpathian mountains...""), and has the occasional haunting monologue about Draculean offspring and ""the pain of fleeting joy.""

Much of the plot involves the various characters rambling through New York, only to suddenly transform a full-fledged vampire film after Nadja's visit to her brother. As her vampiric nature starts taking over, the movie speeds up into a nightmarish showdown in an overgrown Transylvanian manor. And while the twist ending is a bit of a headscratcher, it's a suitably unconventional ending for an atypical vampire movie.

For such a movie, you need a truly brilliant Nadja. And Elina Lwensohn is perfect -- exotically beautiful, dignified, and capable of both innocence and malevolence. She adds a dreamlike flavour to many otherwise prosaic scenes, whether she's wandering through the snow or reclaiming Dracula's body (""We have come for the body of Count Voivoida Armenios Ceausescu Dracula. I believe there is a wooden stake in the heart"").

The other actors do solid jobs with all their roles -- Peter Fonda is quite good as a mildly crazy, long-haired Van Helsing who drives his relatives crazy with his vampire obsession. Donovan, Craze and Harris do serviceable jobs with their roles. Karl Geary is a real standout as the sexy, moderately predatory Renfield, who is kind only to Nadja.

727391,2,6303924832,"Nadja is a difficult film to review, if reviews are meant to guide others, partly because others' reactions will vary wildly. Cinephiles and Goths may regard Nadja as a profound masterpiece, whereas Fangorians might think it turgid crud.

A black & white vampire film, Nadja falls into that small but intriguing category: the horror art film (e.g., Blood and Roses, Spirits of the Dead, The Company of Wolves, Gothic). Its cast includes such Hal Hartley alums as Rumanian-born Elina Lvwensohn (Flirt, Amateur, Basquiat, Schindler's List) and Martin Donovan (Flirt, Amateur, The Opposite of Sex), and is executive produced by David Lynch (who cameos as a morgue attendant).

Nadja's plot is a lethargic (some would say moody) retelling of the Dracula tale in contemporary Manhattan. Lvwensohn stars as Nadja Dracul, Dracula's daughter. Early in the film, Nadja senses Van Helsing destroy Dracula, both roles played by a long-haired but balding Peter Fonda. In effect, Fonda ""kills himself."" I don't know what this is meant to symbolize, if anything, but throughout most of the film Fonda plays Van Helsing, as Dracula is now truly dead (except in flashbacks).

And there are flashbacks aplenty. Every film school/art house gimmick is on display. The black & white photography is variously beautiful, rich, stark, stunning, moody, sumptuous, smoky, blurry -- everything an Anne Rice fan on acid could desire. Images are framed from every conceivable angle. Rainwater drips on the camera lens. Some scenes are shot with a toy Pixelvision video camera. (Yes, there are slow motion shots.)

The soundtrack features diverse musical styles and discordant nondiegetic noises, sometimes fading in and out, sometimes cutting in and out with jarring abruptness. The black & white photography, discordant noises, and languid pace all evoke David Lynch's Eraserhead. (Yes, there are voiceovers.)

Lvwensohn begins one voiceover amid sound effects while in her castle. We cut to events outside, and although her voiceover continues seamlessly, all else is silenced. Moments later, the sound effects fade back up. No real reason for this audio gimmickry, but some viewers may think it eerie. Some may even regard it profound.

If it sounds like I'm reviewing form rather than content, it's because Nadja is about style rather than substance. This film is to be watched rather than understood. Its story is as disjointed as its editing. (Yes, there are jump cuts.)

Characters flitter about aimlessly; only Van Helsing is consistently driven. Van Helsing destroys Dracula, then wants to destroy Nadja. He enlists Jim (Martin Donovan), who's sort of married to the boyish Lucy (Galaxy Craze), who is seduced by Nadja. (Lucy, as in Stoker's Dracula -- get it?) There's also a Renfield (Karl Geary), Nadja's ""slave."" Nadja also wants to nurse her non-vampire brother with blood plasma. Instead, Nadja seduces his lover/nurse Cassandra (Suzy Amis, of Titanic). (Yes, there are lesbian vampire sex scenes.)

Nadja is burdened with flashbacks and jump cuts and torpid pacing and vapid dialogue, obfuscating a thin story. Many will be too bored to prune away all the pretty padding and make an effort to follow the story. Nonsense lines abound, often spoken in a monotone, Hal Hartley style. Jim stares blankly at Lucy while he expounds his love for her to Van Helsing. Lucy responds: ""Tuesday I ate two diet cokes and a bit of pizza. Today I had some M&Ms."" She's under Nadja's spell, but she's not all that different for it. Her conversations with Jim are both fatalistic and trite. (Yes, there's enough fatalism and pessimism and gloom in this film to delight a whole mausoleum-ful of Goths.)

The story ends in Nadja's Transylvanian castle, which looks like an abandoned New Jersey tenement; the walls are brick rather than large cut stone. That's okay, it's an old low-budget trick. And the tracking shot of a Rumanian map is a stylishly nostalgic manner in which to depict the characters' travels. Goths especially will love the darkly draped bed Nadja shares with Cassandra.

There is a ""surprise twist"" ending, but I saw it coming. So should anyone who is familiar with Roger Vadim's Blood and Roses (a retelling of Carmilla, and a far better film). Since Nadja features a female vampire, one may argue that it too is informed by Carmilla rather than Dracula, but Nadja's character names are lifted from Stoker's novel, not Le Fanu's.

There are some trendy modern themes. Nadja laments her dysfunctional family. Seems Dracula was a lousy dad. That, and the gender-bender lesbian sex, the long-haired puffy-shirted men, the vapid philosophizing that sounds profound if you don't think about it, and a film textbook's worth of cinematic stylistics, makes for a film that many an Anne Rice fan could stare at for endless hours, imagining that they were watching some insightful statement on transcendent love, or whatever. Others will be screaming: ""Get on with it!""

Nadja's story could easily have been compressed into a half hour short, resulting in a quicker pace without losing any substance. Its lavish stylistics are impressive, but its slight story, silly dialogue, lack of philosophical insight, and lethargic pace are a drag on the film. Nadja will enthrall some, bore others. I presume you, dear reader, know which camp you're likely to fall into.",1213488000,,5341,5.140552995391705
727392,2,6303924832,"Here is a vampire movie that had potential, yet was ultimately ruined by some poor choices. It is a tale involving two offspring of Count Dracula, who has recently been stabbed with a wooden spike. The two, Nadja and Edgar, endeavor to retrieve the body so they can return it to his native soil. Showing up so he can try to stop them is a relative of van Helsing, also known as Dr. van Helsing. Why the filmmakers thought they needed to retain Dracula as their vampire character is puzzling, though not nearly as puzzling as the decision to include Lucy, van Helsing and Renfield characters. Are these the only characters from vampire lore they could think of? For me, it only seemed to make the film contrived, less authentic and less appealing. Footage from the Lugosi ""Dracula"" film is also briefly used for some reason, as though we do not know who Dracula is. As Dr. van Helsing, Peter Fonda's performance is sporadic at best; he looks intermittently embarrassed and acts as though he did not take his role seriously. I cannot really blame him though, since the film's budget is noticeably very low. As with most other vampire films, the low budget does not hinder the production very much. There really aren't any special effects and, this being set in the present, the sets are not elaborate. It becomes rather humorous, however, toward the climax of the film, which is supposed to be at Dracula's castle in Romania. One scene, which supposedly takes place at the foot of the castle, was obviously shot at night in some non-descript countryside. The next scene is supposed to be under the castle, though it looks as though it was shot in a drainage ditch. The scenes inside the castle consist of one room, which doesn't really look like a castle.

It is not all bad news, though, as Elina Loewensohn looks and acts very much the part of Dracula's daughter. As Lucy, Galaxy Craze (I swear I did not make that up) is delectable; she is quite competent for an unknown actress and brings a convincing navet, which is consistent with the character. Too bad she has not been in more films. Also, the decision to film in black and white was gutsy and, I think, a good one. It is sometimes beautiful and works tremendously to the film's advantage with use of shadows, etc. Unfortunately, the overall look of the film is really cheapened and ruined by the use of pixel vision. I have NO IDEA why this was employed, as it renders the onscreen action indistinct and utterly incapable of viewing.

David Lynch, who also had a hand in producing this film, shows up in a cameo. Just don't expect Lynch's usual stamp of bizarre, humorous entertainment. If you really want to see this film, I would strongly recommend renting before buying.",1198022400,,2731,4.6521739130434785
727393,3,6303924832,"As soon as I saw David Lynch produced this, I knew I was in for a mixed bag. It's not that I don't think the man has talent, it's just that he always pushes the artistry and existentialism of the viewing experience to the point that his films occasionally cease to entertain and devolve into a near-nonsensical, unfocused mess. Still, Lynch didn't direct ""Nadja"" and it never goes that far, though it veers into that territory from time to time. This is a film custom made for philosophical, art-house vampire fans; the kind who think of goth as The Cure and Morrissey, not Marilyn Manson and Type O Negative. The action is thin, the sexuality brief, and the story difficult to accurately portray in mere words. Definitely a one-of-a-kind sort of vampire flick and that alone is reason enough to look it up and give it a whirl.

""Nadja"" is a bit of a remake of the sequel to the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dracula/dp/B000GPIPSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dracula</a>, entitled ""Dracula's Daughter"". Nadja is the daughter in question, one half of a pair of fraternal twins. Dracula has had many children through rape, but she and her brother Edgar were the only born from love; thus all of the rest were born hideous idiots allowing them to blend into the population (now THAT's black humor!). Nadja is a sexy vampire maiden of perpetual sorrow, enveloped by the sadness of ""fleeting joy""; everything she loves disappears in the end. Her brother, thinking them monsters, wants her dead and is ill from not feeding, her ""cruel and distant"" father has just been killed by Dr. Van Helsing - who is played in an unusual manner by Peter Fonda- who is now aiming for her, and then there's that whole vampire thing: immortality and blood drinking and all that. Her desire for a fresh start in life and inability to break old habits can be a metaphor for many things; drug addiction and bad romantic choices being the two that strike me as relevant. The black and white picture is beautiful, the music is unique, modern, and evocative, and the image of the modern female vamp's hooded form walking down the street smoking a cigarette strikes me as iconic.  Nadja herself is quite likable and the cast overall is good.  There's a lot of indie charm to the film and humorous little bits of dialogue thrown in like Renfield chiming into a conversation with the philosophical nugget ""love is like rabies"".  Hard to argue with that assessment. This is definitely a film to see if you're into artistic gothic horror with an indie touch that still maintains a classical feel. That's the good.

The bad is that after the first half, the film sometimes tries too hard and is often inconsistent in both the vampire mythos and the overall quality. The biggest loser of points is the unique but often annoying use of a blurry, pixelated camera view used in scenes where Nadja uses her vampiric influence to blur her victims' minds. A great idea in theory but it looks terrible in practice, inducing headaches in the lengthier scenes and making the onscreen action hard to follow in others. I actually wondered if the DVD was defective for a while the first time I viewed the film, but then I remembered David Lynch was involved and let out a little sigh. More good artistic intentions gone bad. And let's face it, when two beautiful women are kissing passionately onscreen or the protagonist is fighting for her life, nobody needs a blurry picture. Some of the dialogue is a bit distracting as well, with the use of phrases like ""psychic fax"" -used to explain the telepathic link between vampires- or statements like ""blood is like chewing gum to these creatures"" breaking the sophisticated and otherworldly feel of the film. Some of the plot points are of the WTF variety and the climax is more of an anticlimax, though the ending is somewhat fitting for the character. Still, much more could have been done storywise.

The bottom line is this: if you're looking for the orgy of sex and violence that the back of the box promises, you may as well go buy a coaster because that's all this DVD will be good for (well, that and a non-nude sex scene involving period blood); but if you want a thoughtfully different approach to vampires on film give this one a try.

727459,5,6303924832,"""Nadja"" is not like any other vampire movie ever made.

It is creepy, thoughtful, and very funny. This movie has viewers divided. Obviously the people who hate it did not get the humor, which is subtle and dark.

Nadja is the daughter of Dracula living in modern day New York. She describes her father as ""a cruel and distant man."" For the most part, this film is about the psychological damage caused by growing up in a single parent household with a vampire as the parent. She says things like ""the pain I feel is the pain of fleeting joy."" Instead of saying ""I want to suck your blood,"" she says ""I want to change my life"" in a heavy Transyvanian accent.

Like all Dracula films, the arch nemesis is Van Helsing. In this film, he is the crazy uncle. He rides a bicycle and sleeps in a piano.

Nadja's crazy sidekick is Renfield, but we do not find that out until a third the way through the movie.

If you liked films like ""Blade"" and ""Underworld,"" you are going to hate ""Nadja."" ""Nadja"" is for people who normally hate vampire films and looking for great dialog, stylish camera work, and have a quirky sense of humor.

This is easily my all time favorite vampire movie.",1181952000,21,1173,4.407407407407407
727460,4,6303924832,"I had never even heard of this movie until I started researching David Lynch more thoroughly. He does not direct this film, but I think he was a producer. The film reads ""david lynch presents:"" i think. Anyways, thats why I bought this.

I was pleasantly surprised by this. First of all, it features a couple songs by my favorite band: My Bloody Valentine. That alone shows the film makers had good taste. As far as the actual movie goes, its pretty surreal and sort of just floats along. Its hard to explain, I'm not much of a critic. It's not at all pretentious and it made me want to hunt down one of those toy cameras they used in certain scenes.",1181865600,,650,4.327868852459017
727461,2,6303924832,"Nadja is a difficult film to review, if reviews are meant to guide others, partly because others' reactions will vary wildly.  Cinephiles and Goths may regard Nadja as a profound masterpiece, whereas Fangorians might think it turgid crud.

A black & white vampire film, Nadja falls into that small but intriguing category: the horror art film (e.g., Blood and Roses, Spirits of the Dead, The Company of Wolves, Gothic).  Its cast includes such Hal Hartley alums as Rumanian-born Elina Lvwensohn (Flirt, Amateur, Basquiat, Schindler's List) and Martin Donovan (Flirt, Amateur, The Opposite of Sex), and is executive produced by David Lynch (who cameos as a morgue attendant).

Nadja's plot is a lethargic (some would say moody) retelling of the Dracula tale in contemporary Manhattan.  Lvwensohn stars as Nadja Dracul, Dracula's daughter.  Early in the film, Nadja senses Van Helsing destroy Dracula, both roles played by a long-haired but balding Peter Fonda.  In effect, Fonda ""kills himself.""  I don't know what this is meant to symbolize, if anything, but throughout most of the film Fonda plays Van Helsing, as Dracula is now truly dead (except in flashbacks).

And there are flashbacks aplenty.  Every film school/art house gimmick is on display.  The black & white photography is variously beautiful, rich, stark, stunning, moody, sumptuous, smoky, blurry -- everything an Anne Rice fan on acid could desire.  Images are framed from every conceivable angle.  Rainwater drips on the camera lens.  Some scenes are shot with a toy Pixelvision video camera.  (Yes, there are slow motion shots.)

The soundtrack features diverse musical styles and discordant nondiegetic noises, sometimes fading in and out, sometimes cutting in and out with jarring abruptness.  The black & white photography, discordant noises, and languid pace all evoke David Lynch's Eraserhead.  (Yes, there are voiceovers.)

Lvwensohn begins one voiceover amid sound effects while in her castle.  We cut to events outside, and although her voiceover continues seamlessly, all else is silenced.  Moments later, the sound effects fade back up.  No real reason for this audio gimmickry, but some viewers may think it eerie.  Some may even regard it profound.

If it sounds like I'm reviewing form rather than content, it's because Nadja is about style rather than substance.  This film is to be watched rather than understood.  Its story is as disjointed as its editing.  (Yes, there are jump cuts.)

Characters flitter about aimlessly; only Van Helsing is consistently driven.  Van Helsing destroys Dracula, then wants to destroy Nadja.  He enlists Jim (Martin Donovan), who's sort of married to the boyish Lucy (Galaxy Craze), who is seduced by Nadja.  (Lucy, as in Stoker's Dracula -- get it?)  There's also a Renfield (Karl Geary), Nadja's ""slave.""  Nadja also wants to nurse her non-vampire brother with blood plasma.  Instead, Nadja seduces his lover/nurse Cassandra (Suzy Amis, of Titanic).  (Yes, there are lesbian vampire sex scenes.)

Nadja is burdened with flashbacks and jump cuts and torpid pacing and vapid dialogue, obfuscating a thin story.  Many will be too bored to prune away all the pretty padding and make an effort to follow the story.  Nonsense lines abound, often spoken in a monotone, Hal Hartley style.  Jim stares blankly at Lucy while he expounds his love for her to Van Helsing.  Lucy responds: ""Tuesday I ate two diet cokes and a bit of pizza.  Today I had some M&Ms.""  She's under Nadja's spell, but she's not all that different for it.  Her conversations with Jim are both fatalistic and trite.  (Yes, there's enough fatalism and pessimism and gloom in this film to delight a whole mausoleum-ful of Goths.)

The story ends in Nadja's Transylvanian castle, which looks like an abandoned New Jersey tenement; the walls are brick rather than large cut stone.  That's okay, it's an old low-budget trick.  And the tracking shot of a Rumanian map is a stylishly nostalgic manner in which to depict the characters' travels.  Goths especially will love the darkly draped bed Nadja shares with Cassandra.

There is a ""surprise twist"" ending, but I saw it coming.  So should anyone who is familiar with Roger Vadim's Blood and Roses (a retelling of Carmilla, and a far better film).  Since Nadja features a female vampire, one may argue that it too is informed by Carmilla rather than Dracula, but Nadja's character names are lifted from Stoker's novel, not Le Fanu's.

There are some trendy modern themes.  Nadja laments her dysfunctional family.  Seems Dracula was a lousy dad.  That, and the gender-bender lesbian sex, the long-haired puffy-shirted men, the vapid philosophizing that sounds profound if you don't think about it, and a film textbook's worth of cinematic stylistics, makes for a film that many an Anne Rice fan could stare at for endless hours, imagining that they were watching some insightful statement on transcendent love, or whatever.  Others will be screaming: ""Get on with it!""

Nadja's story could easily have been compressed into a half hour short, resulting in a quicker pace without losing any substance.  Its lavish stylistics are impressive, but its slight story, silly dialogue, lack of philosophical insight, and lethargic pace are a drag on the film.  Nadja will enthrall some, bore others.  I presume you, dear reader, know which camp you're likely to fall into.",1149292800,3,5389,5.140552995391705
727462,5,6303924832,"Great film shot in Black and white that is full of some of the best lines I have ever heard in any film.  I mean COME ON!!! Peter Fonda is the Fearless Vampire Killer!!! Great Stuff.

People seem to whine about the cinematography but why complain?  Who here is creative enough to make a film with some parts shot with a Fisher-Price camera?  Or brave enough rather. . .

Outstanding Vampyre flick that forces you to wax philosophical on life for hours after the film is over.  If you are an indie buff or enjoy low budget masterpieces, this film is for you.  A must own.

727463,5,6303924832,"I'm a huge vampire fanatic. I love just about anything that involves vampires, including Anne Rice's vampire chronicles to the original ""Dracula"" with Bela Lugosi in the starring role. ""Nadja"" is more in the vein of the original ""Dracula"" in a sense that the film is shot in black and white and that there was minimal special effects. What is lacking in special effects, there is plenty of drama. I was pleasantly surprised that Peter Fonda was in this film. Elina Lowensohn gave me the creeps as Nadja, the vampire that Dr. Van Helsing (Peter Fonda) is hunting. At times I was annoyed by the oft distorted cinematography. I enjoyed the fact that there wasn't that typical dazzling special effects as seen in ""Blade"" and ""Interview With the Vampire"". It gets tiring seeing the storyline get passed over by special effects in vampire cinema. ""Nadja"" is a classic indie film.",1104883200,4,873,4.826666666666667

Personally, I think it gives a fabulous perspective to the film.  If you are into films that are gothic, intense, & have many layers, you will like this film.",1058486400,4,415,4.708333333333333
727466,5,6303924832,"5 stars is actually too low for this video, it is by far the best film I`ve ever seen. Ok, the first thing that everyone misses is that this is NOT a vampire film. Vampires are only used to tell a story because the film deals with dark subjects and it attempts to cover an age of a couple of hundred of years and having people who live longer and are more experienced is more effective, that`s why vampires were used.
The film itself is about being unsatisfied with one`s life and attempting to change it. What everyone seems to miss is that all the characters have one thing in common - they are all unsatisfied with their lives, they all feel that something is missing and they all desperately try to change their lives. All but Renfield, who is there to try and present the other option. He even presents himself with - My name is Renfield. I am her slave.
Nadja`s father tried to change his life through love, her brother is also not happy with his life so he tries to find his solutions, the same is with the girl Nadja meets in the bar and her father who tries to do it through religion, which is mentioned in one sentence but still adds to what the film is about. But they all fail or find solutions that are more or less conventional. Nadja is trying to do something else. What she keeps repeating is that she is free now that her father is dead. This can be related to the archetypical criticism used in literature and also in the works of Ted Hughes - such as Shakespeare and the Goddess of Complete being, and also some other writers.
This is a multy level film, it`s not easy to understand it and it needs to be seen at least a few times. Labeling it as a vampire film, a dark comedy or whatever is very wrong, it is a very serious film that deals with a very serious subject and requires a lot of reading and research in order to be understood correctly. But it is definitely worth it.",1014508800,4,1898,4.245856353591161
727467,2,6303924832,"I gave this film two stars out of pity for the two amazing lead actresses who were stuck in this horrible film. The story is a mish mosh of cliche vampire lore extrapolated from every bad Dracula remake you've ever seen.
The black and white cinematography is wonderfully stark and gothic in some scenes only to be ruined by a cheesy (and grainy) mosaic (pixelization) effect in others. That mosaic filter invariably gets applied to the the few scenes in this movie that would otherwise be entertaining if you could actually make out just what the hell was going on. EVERY single time something climactic occurs the film becomes grainy and pixelated. A film school freshman could have done a better job here.
The male characters in this film though are it's true death knell. Not one of them brought anything to their scenes other than the type of boring machismo-laced melodrama that leaves me with an ichy fast-forwarding trigger finger. I had hope for Renfield (Yep, they have a character named Renfield... no dead horse left unbeaten here) but all he ever did was chainsmoke and pout. That left me with the annoying husband, the dull brother, and Peter Fonda who must've ended every day of filming with a quiet night spent cursing the soul of his agent for getting him this gig. The only low left for that guy after this is a role as ""old dude #5"" in the next Pauly Shore movie.
Yes its that bad, worse still if you're a fan of vampire films and bought this one on the strength of the positive reviews on this page. Do not believe those reviews, they lie I tell you. Lie! But seriously if you're looking for a half decent B/Indie vampire DVD you'd be better servered picking up ""Razorblade Smile"", which isn't too great either but is, at the very least, enjoyable.

(Its not surprising that Lynch executive produced this, and appears briefly in the film).

The black and white, stylized photography, the music, and some of the dialogue are terrific; original and compelling. And setting a modern vampire tale in the nightlife of young hip 90s Manhattan yields some very interesting results.  At other times it cant seem to make up its mind about what ratio of camp to reality it wants to be.

I am not a huge vampire film fan, mostly due to the way they are styled and my favorites are a mixed bag and amounts to maybe 6 films.  The film is too dull and lacks suspense.
