1793082,3,B00006SFL7,"For Lil Bow WOW's first movie it's great but for a basketball it is not so good. It's cool that they got all those pro basketball players like Jason Kidd and David Robinson but it dosn't seem any good for a basketball movie. This can't compare to some basketball movies out there. This one isn't as based around basketball as most others,this one is based around Lil Bow Wow finding Michale Jordan's shoe's and being able to play like MJ.I guess it's good for little kid's who like Lil Bow Wow but not for people who want to see it because it is a basketball movie. Take my advice,it is not that good.",1031961600,,601,4.327433628318584
1793083,5,B00006SFL7,"I love Bow Wow's movie Like Mike because it's funny and he is so fine!!! I am one of his biggest fans and I will always support him. The movie had a lot of NBA stars. Morris Chestnut was in it which makes the movie good also!! I really love this movie along with the soundtrack which is tight. So keep doing what you are doing Bow Wow because you are very talented and so cute...Holla,Bow Wow's #1 fan.",1028505600,3,402,4.10126582278481
1793084,5,B00006SFL7,the movie was great and bow wow is so cute in it.i can tell that he might be in the acting busniess in his future.everybody should go and see it especailly if you like bow wow& basketball,1027900800,,187,4.081081081081081
1793085,5,B00006SFL7,"I liked this movie a lot. The plot was very good. The actors and actresses in this movie were excellent. I think it tells kids that they should never give up on their dreams because you never know what can happen. That is why it is a great movie. Also, the soundtrack is perfect. I have that and I think that they couldn't have made a better soundtrack. They have terrific singers. The songs match the movie perfectly. Everything having to do with the movie ""LIKE MIKE"" is PERFECT!",1026691200,2,481,4.415730337078652
1793086,5,B00006SFL7,"I saw Bow Wow's movie Like Mike on it's debut day,July 3rd. The movie defintely gets two thumbs up for me...too bad I wasn't born with an extra thumb because then it would get 3! The movie isn't all about basketball....Bow Wow also has his mind set on finding a family to adopt him in the movie so it's not all about ball! This movie is for kids and grown-ups(they thre Morris Chestnut in there!)The movie is funny,sad,and many more. Go see it for yourself.",1025654400,16,457,4.3882352941176475

1793254,5,B00006SFL7,This is by my favorite basketball movie besides space jam. The movie is about calvin cambridge who's an orphan he has an allen iverson jersey and he loses it in a game of one on one against the orphanage's bully. At the orphanage the lady in charge brings a box of clothes and there's a pair of old sneakers which happens to be sneakers that once belonged to nba legend michael jordan. He puts the sneakers on and goes to an L.A knight game. He gets chosen to take part in a one on one game against tracy reynolds. He schools him and the l.a knight's owner is so impressed with calvin's skills that he gets signed to a contract. Tracy doesn't like calvin at first but by the end of the movie he falls in love and adopts calvin to be his son. It's a lil sad at parts of the movie but it's really a good movie. There's also plenty of cameos by nba stars such as iverson and Jason Kidd. I love Like Mike.,1431302400,,901,4.096045197740113

That may be part of the plot, but I saw the touching scenes of a kid looking for parents who he so desperately wants and needs, come to find out that the father for him was his teammate all along.

They (the preteens) all seem to have this unbreakable, unshakable, special bond that no one can dismember or join.

Calvin runs into these shoes one day (They were Michael Jordan's while he was in the same foster care) and he begins to play better and jump so, so much higher. When the enemy finds out however, they try to assault Calvin and take his shoes.

How low does it go? Very. They try and lock Calvin away so he doesn't get adopted IN addition to taking his shoes away temporarily.

Makes for a decent watch especially for kids. They'll want to see it twice a day for all of the cool moves the basketball players can pull off!

As the older rappers pull the young kids into their ""good 'ol boy"" network, I hope that the quality doesn't start to take a dive, as it did, when this behavior was prevalent in the White corporate world.

I thought movies like ""Scarface"" and ""The Exorcist"" were well written and fantastic, but this... this is simply the best. Move over, Robert DeNiro - there's a new Hollywood legend in town, and his name is Little Bow Wow.
When Little Bow Wow finds the shoes that say ""MJ"" in them, well, I couldn't possible have imagined where this story was going. But when I found out that he would gain great basketball-playing skills by wearing them, I cried ""BRAVISSIMO!"" and gave it a standing ovation. I mean, really! Who ever would have thought of that? And when Little Bow Wow joined the NBA, performed insane tricks, and got attention from all of the NBA, well, I actually had to run to the bathroom and dunk my head in the sink and remind myself it was just a movie. I walked back, and watched more. It wasn't until Little Bow Wow was bragging to his little friend about getting room service that...I wept. I shed a tear. ""E.T."" wishes it could be this heartwarming, touching, and memorable.

1793464,2,B00006SFL7,"OK, so two of our children watched the movie and liked it.  I guess it was made for them, and at that level is not that bad, but it's not a great one for parents to endure.  If you want glowing reviews, check the under-12 review section.
This is the story of an orphan who gets picked on by bigger guys.  He comes across some shoes that have ""MJ"" initialed in them.  When he puts them on he becomes the best basketball player in the world, humiliating today's current stars, who all seem to be having  a good time in the movie.
Two reasons it can't get more stars than me.  Maybe the kids have not seen countless films with exactly the same plot, so for them it's pretty fresh.  But this is the same old story of a very bad team getting some new factor added to their chemistry that makes them winners.  When the new factor is there, they all play way above their former levels.  When the new factor is not available, they all stand around not knowing what to do.  And there is a big game at the end, where the factor showing up or not, instead of everybody continuing on their own merits becomes the big concern.  And on and on.
But that doesn't bug me so much.  Part of the economy of Hollywood consists of the need to put out new products every week, and there are only so many original ideas.  It's not art, but it keeps people employed and young ones who don't know any better occupied for awhile.
What does bother me is when the factor introduced to make the team a winner gives them an unfair advantage.  ""Angels in the Outfield"" did the same thing.  In that movie, balls were caught that shouldn't have been, and hits were made that shouldn't have been.  As rewards come with winning, it means that the team that has just won with this unfair advantage, and the losing team, with more talent, does not get these rewards.  Also, in the case of this movie, who is the player who has to work hard, but get benched when a little kid with magic shoes bumps him out of the lineup?
Finally, the writers have to be careful when constructing the ""factor"" that makes the play better.  What if the kid found a bottle of magic pills that did the same thing?  That would be a big no-no, as we start getting into performance-enhancing-drug territory.  But then, if drugs are banned because they can give an unfair (if short-term) advantage, aren't magic shoes in the same territory?  Or angels?  Or flubber?  I hate to be a spoil-sport on this, but I think these movies teach kids to look for the gimmick to win, instead of working hard, which is what it's going to take in real life.",1046649600,2,2578,4.313929313929314

1793467,3,B00006SFL7,"I didn't have high hopes for this film.  It seemed to be a gimmicky Hollywood cookie-cutter, with the flavor of the month in the leading role.  True, the film had these elements; however, due to superb writing, this movie broke the Hollywood mold.
The main characters have their personalities, but the secondary characters are able to stand on their own.  The were more than place holders; they were actually people.  I think the key moment is when Calvin's friend Murph puts on the shoes, hoping to be able to play like Mike.  Token eccentric Crispin Glover (George McFly) plays the evil manager of the orphanage with a subtle flair.  He is like Brendan Frasier or Peter Weller-they all have talent; it's just tricky to find good roles for them.
This movie is a nice family movie.  It reinforces the values of diversity-the old talent of Tracy Reynolds with the new talent of Calvin Cambridge, and also Calvin's friendship with Asian Reg Stevens and Caucasian Murph.  It has subtle elements of reconciliation-Tracey reconciles with Calvin, Tracey reconciles with his estranged father, and Calvin reconciles with the bully Ox.  This movie is also about living your dreams, and working toward a worthy goal.  And that you cannot beat!
I have only two objections to this movie.  The first is obvious: whoever thought that having a kid climb a tree to grab shoes off a wire should be shot!  Especially climbing a tree in the rain during an electrical storm!  The wet shoes would conduct electricity, and be grounded through Calvin's body, ending the story before it began.  And beyond the bad physics, this is absolutely the wrong thing to show in a family movie.
Two replacement ideas for this rather dumb scene are as follows:  They could have the adventurers look up at the sneakers, and Calvin want to get the shoes, but Murph say that it is dangerous to climb wires, and then have the wind blow the sneakers down.  This would get the shows down, and replace the galvanizing symbolism of  electricity with the subtle inspiration symbolism of wind.  You get the power of myth without the power of bad example.
The other option would be to eliminate the electricity altogether.  You could have Calvin put on the shoes, and just begin playing better-a la Cinderella.  This would make the story a bit more ambiguous and more intriguing.  Is it the shoes, or is it Calvin's power of faith?
My second beef with this film is that  it reinforces the idea that they way out of the ghetto is on the basketball court or in the studio recording rap music.  They way out of the ghetto is the same as the way out of the trailer-park, and it involves being realistic, learning a marketable skill at school, and developing a obsession with drudgery.  I know this is a fantasy film, but all myths need to be gounded in some reality, or they become meaningless.
3 stars-It's a good film, but the ""live wire"" scene is inexcusable.",1045094400,,2912,4.709486166007905

1793469,2,B00006SFL7,"This movie isn't worth too much thought. It's basically one of those Disney live action things we saw as kids in a ""cafetorium"" while sitting cross-legged -- you know, the ones with the short beforehand that started with the paintbrush ""painting in"" the wildlife setting? (""In the Spraaaang, the young otters retahrn to Bahr Coun-tree..."") Anyone who ever saw ""The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes"" will recognize the tone and plot of the ""Like Mike"" instantly.
The performances are pretty good, though. Despite straight-as-an-arrow writing that has no surprises, you get people like Eugene Levy in the supporting parts. You get some fun cameos from real NBA players, and you get Crispin Glover as a truly creepy villain for a movie like this. The coach of l'il Bow Wow's team does a decent job with little to go on, and aside from Glover the adults and kids in the movie interact pretty credibly. Nobody's a complete idiot -- that's kind of unusual in a kids' movie, now I think of it. The movie's well-cast and well-acted, for what it is.
Most of all, though, you get Morris Chestnut's performance as Tracy, the NBA player assigned to keep track of the kid phenom. Chestnut really made the movie for me. He took the sort of role that could have been career death, and he made the movie. He's good enough that I looked him up afterward, to see what else he'd done.
Anyway, if you do happen to have kids who would like to see this one, don't assume you won't be able to sit through it with them. It's got its points.",1044489600,,1510,4.575645756457565

1793481,5,B00006SFL7,"This movie stars Lil' Bow Wow and Jonthan Lipnicki as a pair of ophans that wish for a home, or at least that what Lil' Bow Wow does. When you got actors like Lil' Bow Wow, Jonthan Lipnicki and Morris Chestnut and the game of Basketball, how can you even ask for more. Well, maybe the movie doesn't have Michael Jordan, but you have a lot of famous people who make camos in this movie. Here is what Like Mike is about. Calvin Cambridge (Lil' Bow Wow) is a big basketball fan that can't play the sport very good. He is an orphan, and one night during a game, Calvin, his best freind Murph (Jonthan Lipnicki) has to be on the street outside Staples Center salling candy. He meets the coach of the L.A. Knights, and he tells Calvin that he will have some tickets waiting for him on a Sunday night game. Calvin takes Murph and some orphans to the game, where during half time, a lucky person gets to play 1 on 1 with Tracey Reyolds (Morris Chestnut) and a ticket is drawn, and Calvin has the winning ticket, and he uses sneakers that he found that has gotten struck by lighting and turns him into a basketball super star an before he knows it, an exetive from the L.A. Nights named Frank Bertand (Eugene Lavy) signs him to a contract. At first the team gaves him sneakers to wear, but he fakes a bathroom break and puts on and ties up his sneakers.
And now for the best part on my review of Like Mike, my comments. First this movie reminded me of Eddie, Rookie of the Year and Angles in the Outfield (1994). And you have an actor named Jessie Plemons who plays Calvin's rival Ox. Why does Hollywood like to make a lot of fantasy movies? I mean, if you were on druing a strom wouldn't you in real life be struck by lighting? Or die from touching powerlines, whether you touch them or they touch you? Next thing, would a real team pull a person (or people) out of the stands to be either honory coach or play one on one with a basketball player? This was the first time in young Jonthan Lipnicki's career as an actor that he has had to movies out at the same time. The other is Stuart Little 2. I reccomend this movie to people who love sports or basketball movies. In fact, I would rather watch this movie, then see my local NBA (Chicago Bulls). And have to be happy that none of the current Chicago Bulls that are in this movie. I also reccomend this movie if you love to watch movies on dvd that has deleted scenes. In fact in the end credits, there are outtakes.
If you love live actions movie that are fantasy, I would reccomend this movie to you, or if you love basketball I would reccomend this you also.",1042934400,,2605,4.232931726907631

1793484,5,B00006SFL7,Like Mike is a great Father and Son Movie everyone could enjoy and relate to. The Movie tells a story about Calvin Cambridge(Lil Bow Wow)Who is a orphan and is looking for the perfect family. One day He stumble upon some shoes which was once worn by a really famous Basketball inside the shoes it features the initials MJ he then realize that famous Basketball player shoes belong to Michael Jordan. One day Calvin wears the shoes and goes to a Los Angeles Knights Game. While at the game he wins a chance to go one on one with Tracey Reynolds(Morris Chestnut)of the Los Angeles Knights. He wins the one on one match up with Tracey thanks to his MJ'S now Calvin Cambridge gets to play in The NBA With the LA Knights. I like this movie a lot because I saw the relationship betweeen Tracey and Bow wow build up in this film And at the end I almost cry because The Moment felt so emotional and well there isn't another word to describe it(And I'm not telling you the ending of the Movie).GO SEE LIKE MIKE A great Family film everyone will love they'll laugh and they'll cry in certain parts of the movie.,1039737600,,1101,4.349514563106796
1793485,5,B00006SFL7,"I bought this movie today because it was at a great price, and my 12 year old daughter wanted really badly to see it. Soooo, I bought and called myself reviewing it, and fell in love with Lil Bow Wow myself. You just cannot help but adore him. Morris Chestnut is still foine as usual, but very reluctant to bring Calvin into his space. The part where he tells Calvin that he adopted him was so sweet it made me want to cry. Fine script,good acting, and great moves. When Bow Wow tried asking one of the opposing team members for an autograph was classic. Making that shot and not being able to get down was another.. Selling candy and the people saying who would buy candy from him was another. Ok. So, I am a Bow Wow fan. But. the movie is clean, the whole family can watch without getting offended, and it was just great..",1039564800,,824,4.254777070063694
