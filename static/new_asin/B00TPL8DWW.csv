7014117,5,B00TPL8DWW,Grace Thomas is a girl who goes to paris. She is happy but just a little happy! She smiles steady even when things go wrong and she makes a big mess. She seems terrible advanced for only 9 years old. She looks and acts more like 17. But it is a very good movie that all fans of american girl will want to see!

7014121,3,B00TPL8DWW,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. JUST FYI.

I honestly don't know what to think about this movie. I really wanted to like it, as I LOVED the Grace books. But let me tell you, this movie is NOTHING like the books. I understand that when a movie is based on a book, they have to tweak some things, but come on. There were quite a few noticeable differences between the movie and the books, For example, the cooking show was not present in the books. Also, in the books, Grace continued her cupcake business when she arrived back in the States, instead of simply working to boost her grandparent's bakery business. In addition, in the books, Grace knew that Bonbon was coming home with them before going back to the States. Grace's clumsy episodes? They were so cheesy I had to laugh. Plus, she should have helped clean up after making her messes instead of walking away. Also, I don't watch a lot of American Girl movies in general, so I don't know if all of them are like this, but the main girl characters were SO sugar-coated (sorry, pun intended), especially Maddie and Ella. It felt like everything was giggle-worthy. And I wanted to see more of Bonbon and the French subtitles. But I will say that the scenery was beautiful, Sylvie and the grandparents did AWESOME jobs with their parts, and it was an okay movie in general. Wasn't anything special though. If you want to learn something about this girl of the year, read the Grace books. They are wonderful!

7014123,2,B00TPL8DWW,I'm sure little girls would love this film but not middle school or high school girls. The adult acting is fine but the girls' acting is weak and borders on downright silly.  However it is well written and has some good lessons.,1468540800,,228,4.428571428571429

7014125,3,B00TPL8DWW,"Eh.  It's just okay.  It feels like two films in one (and not in a seamless way) but if you're a collector of all things American Girl it's an okay addition.  If you're not really committed to that world though, don't waste your time.  The acting is okay and the setting is pretty, but the plot leaves a lot to be desired.  That said though, it's one of the few ""tween"" movies out there that doesn't have any romantic aspect; no showing off for boys (unless you count Grace wanting to impress her uncle as a chef) and there's no real girl-on-girl cattiness.  So, compared to much of what's out there, it's better.  But, it's still not a very good film.",1467676800,2,652,4.338842975206612

7014205,5,B00TPL8DWW,"I really enjoyed this movie about a girl who wants to save her grandparents' bakery and does her best to make this come about.  Grace tries to start her own baking business as a summer job so she can buy a new bike.  When her parents announce that they are going to France to visit her uncle and family to help his wife take care of her baby soon to be born, Grace is initially disappointed.  However,  the experience she has lets her bring about a happy ending for her family.  It has a sweetness and joy rarely found in movies for kids these days.  The main character does not act or speak meanly to others who are mean to her, but is kind and eventually wins them over.  There are very good messages about being kind to your enemies, working hard, listening to others so that you can learn, and the importance of friendship.  Olivia Rodrigo does an excellent job and she is just so cute in the movie.  I'm a lady in my mid 50's and so you don't have to be a kid to enjoy it!",1447977600,,977,4.126984126984127

They are bearable and even entertaining to watch for adults and generally have practical but deep messages.  This is in contrast to the extravagant plots and settings that make them so exciting for children and adults alike.  These films make wonderful adventures relateable and encourage both healthy habits and big dreams.

This particular movie is notable for having two plot stages and a longer-than-usual length while maintaining the happiness and high-quality that viewers have come to expect from American Girl.  There is also catchy, clean music that kids and others young-at-heart will love.",1439510400,,697,5.3

7014276,1,B00TPL8DWW,"We were so excited to see this movie, but what a disappointment. First off let me say that when we watch an AG movie, we aren't expecting Meryl Streep acting or an Academy Award screenplay. We expect a sweet film made for children, but pleasant fo adults to watch. Of the 7 AG movies I have seen, 4 were very good, 2 were good, and this 1 is no good. Now, that is from an adult perspective. My daughters enjoyed the movie, but did say it was their least favorite. They did not like the scenes with the two friends because my daughters said, ""The friends were either mean or too silly. They were stupid. I wouldn't be friends with them."" Another thing that they noticed was that Grace met every situation with a smile, even when a smile was inappropriate. It annoyed my daughters that Grace didn't have appropriate emotional responses.

Like others have mentioned, the movie  veered significantly away from the book, and my daughters said the book was a much better story. Some things obviously have to be adapted for a film, but there were unnecessary changes that didn't make sense to them. From an adult perspective so many details were completely unbelievable and ridiculous. Here's one example. The grandparents in the movie are from France (not in the book), and they come to the USA with little money. They decide to open a bakery in a tiny town and build an 18th century thatched roof cottage to house it. What?! On top of that the appliances that they bought new when they opened 40 years ago (1975) are appliances that were made in the 1940's. And their photographs of their opening are black and white. Color film was very standard in the 70's. If this sounds like I am nitpicking, please understand these are only examples of inconsistencies that riddled the entire film. I can forgive a few little things, but this film was full of them, so it got to be totally ridiculous.

Should you let your daughter watch this film? Once is fine; she may enjoy it. Should you buy it? No. The behavior modeled by the children isn't something you want to expose your child to repeatedly, since there is no character growth.",1439164800,18,2121,4.576315789473684

The movie is an adorable tale of a girl who loves to bake but encounters some problems in life. First she visits Paris with her family and makes a mess she has to learn to clean up and then when she comes home she has to help with another mess. The movie features wholesome characters with real dilemmas they need to solve. I love that the story focuses on a girl who is an entrepreneur because it will hopefully motivate and show girls that they can be whatever they want to be. I can definitely see the movie inspiring young girls to start their own businesses, even if it is just a lemonade stand to start.

7014424,5,B00TPL8DWW,"American Girl's latest movie outing (and the fourth to be directed by Vince Marcello) surprisingly takes us away from America and into the iconic streets of Paris as budding baker Grace (Olivia Rodrigo) helps her French family, and of course, learns more about herself in the process.

Though some American Girl fans have lamented the change in direction of recent AG movies (which favor more sparkles, colors, giggles, and modern settings over the historical settings of Samantha, Felicity, etc.), Grace Stirs Up Success is still just as sweet and heartwarming as anything to come from American Girl. The values are very strong, with this film in particular focusing on using your talents for the benefit of others (unlike Disney Channel fare, which usually has an unpleasant ""it's all about me"" taste).

Olivia Rodrigo is terrific as the ever-vivacious, ever-organized, and occasionally klutzy Grace, and her relationship with her snooty French cousin is both touching. . .and funny. There is definitely more outright humor in this film than any previous AG movie, with some pratfalls, whipped cream, and clumsy antics on hand; again, perhaps a departure from American Girl's more serious historical pieces, but still just as fun and just as sweet-spirited. Music and songs also play a very prominent role, as they did in both Isabelle and Saige.

As usual with Vince Marcello's AG movies, the visuals are extremely colorful, looking like a world of dolls and doll houses, as if we are seeing the world that a girl might be imagining as she is playing with her American Girl doll. These films are first-rate family films, with excellent values that are seldom taught in modern children's entertainment. Thanks, American Girl!",1436054400,14,1727,5.1387900355871885

7014457,5,B00TPL8DWW,"Our girls love American Girls, and this latest episode delivers lots of fun, sentiment, Parisian settings, good music, and none of the cattiness seen in others.

Grace goes to Paris to help out her aunt and her French husband's pastry shop. She fancies ferself a pretty good baker until she starts making one mess after another.  Her French cousin is put off by her being there and a new baby on the way.  Back home, her grandparent's bakery is going under.  Things are not working out like she imagined, but Gace is plucky and positive, and of course, things are bound to turn around.

Apropos, we travel to Paris next Spring and, fortunately, they show many shots of Paris, and use a few subtitles, which I think makes the film more realistic.  (The books have French terms in the back).  There's a theme of helping out, friendship,reaching for your dreams and a general uplifitng bounce to the movie, and some slapstick to boot(French actor Fabrice Michel playing the uncle takes a few pies).  Bon Bon the dog lives up to cuteness, although our girls wished there was more of him.

The movie climaxes with a bake off, the clock ticks, who will win... the drums beat, the music plays, stay tuned.  The special features are a few short, snipets behind the scenes in music video style.

""Where's her dress?"" Asked my youngest, early in the movie, speaking of the outfit Grace wears on the book and movie cover.  It shows up later, be patient.  Fun movie... I guess we're off to the AG store again... but we're not buying anything- we're saving for our trip... well, maybe, we'll get a Bon Bon.",1435363200,4,1593,4.6063829787234045

My daughter was beyond excited when I surprised her with this DVD on the very day it was released. Sadly, we were disappointed. The start was extremely slow; so much so that we actually stopped it last night and then resumed the movie today. I honestly think that it would be difficult for this movie to capture the attention of younger ones due to how slow the first half (or more) was. Although the storyline needed to be established, I feel that there was just too much dialogue for the age group that this is targeted for. I was actually bored myself. Without giving away too many details, the movie did pick up during the last big scene in Paris and kept its momentum from there. I am disappointed that the storyline was not more enticing. I expected a more entertaining film compared to Makenna Shoots for the Stars, Saige Paints the Sky & Isabelle Dances into the Spotlight, but my daughter and I did enjoy the last half of the movie. We have both watched the previous three AG movies multiple times (especially the Makenna and Isabelle movies), but I doubt that we will with this one. In fact, I would not be surprised if my daughter didn't even watch this again for at least 6 months. That speaks volumes if you knew how much my daughter loves AG and their movies.",1435104000,9,1400,4.4941176470588236
7014468,1,B00TPL8DWW,"You can 100% now see that Mattel bought out American Girl because this is te first AG film I was horrified to have shown my child.  She lies to try and get a friend, both leads spend like 10 minutes trying various way to deceive a concierge and none of that is portrayed as naughty or a lesson learned the hard way to be honest- it's just flaunted as fun and doing what they need to, to get what they want- made my stomach churn since that's so the opposite of how the AG has always represented itself.  The previews also included characters our Fam avoid- I believe monster high was the name of the sexy/creepy ones.  The Barbie brand seems to be shining through what long was a more wholesome label and I sure hope it improves from backlash to this film rather than continues this road.
