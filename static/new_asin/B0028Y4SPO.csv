3875065,4,B0028Y4SPO,"In this re-write of Dumas' ""The Three Musketeers"", Barbie is a country lass named Corinne.  Like her deceased father, who just happens to have been D'Artagnan, it is her dream to serve and protect the royal family. But unlike her father she faces even more difficulties in getting to prove herself worthy of the Musketeer title because she is a girl.

This then is the pivotal point of the plot, that girls can do whatever they want if they are willing to train for it and not let others squash there dreams.  And, in fact, this theme is extended to include everyone, even the Prince of France, who feels like he will have to give up his scientific interests once he becomes king.

Corrine is joined in this adventure by 3 other girls, who also happen to want to be Musketeers. They are all athletic and bright, differing though in their interests. One quotes poetry, one plays the violin, and so forth. But because they are girls  they end up working as housekeepers in the palace until they discover that there is a plot against the prince's life. Then they are called upon to use all of their skills and inner strength to try to foil the plot.

There is the usual music and dance numbers, as well as the usual avoidance of violence in this film. The talking animals include a mean-spirited dog, Corrine's cat, and a horse named Alexander.

Talking Points:::

I really liked the strong themes in the movie. Like every Barbie film there's a good underlying message and exemplary behavior.

I thought the music was excellent. It's a little more trendy than in previous Barbie movies, and I'm even thinking about seeing if there's a DVD we can purchase.

I thought the animation was not as good as in her other movies. However we saw this at the theater so that may have made small imperfections appear worse than they would at home.

Overall, a very good movie.  I give it 4 Stars because some of the plotting was inferior to previous movies, and if you could only purchase one Barbie video for your child, I would suggest that Barbie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barbie-in-The-Nutcracker/dp/B00005M2BW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barbie in The Nutcracker</a>&nbsp;and Barbie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barbie-As-The-Princess-and-the-Pauper/dp/B0002CHJZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barbie As The Princess and the Pauper</a>&nbsp;were better choices.

3875066,5,B0028Y4SPO,"I am a huge fan of Barbie, and when I saw the trailer, I got so excited. I ordered it the  day it came out. And I've loved it! Barbie stars as Corinne, Teresa stars as Viveca, Nikki as Renee, and Summer (who looks like Melody off of Diamond Castle) stars as Aramina. It has way more action than any of the previous Barbie movies. I loved the music, the animation, everything! The animation has changed so much since Barbie's first movies. The storyline is good, I've enjoyed other plots better, but it's still great. There are a few cheesy moments, were I was like 'yeah right' and the three little girls I babysit were cheering and whooping. (now they all want to be musketeers, so we're training!) It has a little bit of romance, not the kind I like, but it was still sweet. I love Aramina, who fights with her fans (that scene were she's battling a swordsman is really cool.) Viveca's weapons would be the most fun, I think, but she doesn't use them enough. Corinne is the best swordsman, yes, but it seems she relies more on her AMAZING athletic abilities. Renee, I was disappointed in, she only had a tiny slingshot, not the crossbow I thought she used. (and against these clashing swords and swirling ribbons, her weapon doesn't look too great.) I didn't like the sappy, weak, dreamer prince. Couldn't he have fought a little??? I wish they could have had a better blend, where the men and women fought equally, not the girls are better. It's like women's rights taken so far, that pretty soon we'll have a Men's Suffrege movement! This is NOT a classic Barbie movie. It's good, and I love it, but it's VERY different. Lately, everything about Barbie has been changing, and while I generally dislike change, this one was actually a fairly nice one. I was disappointed in Thumbelina, and, truthfully, somewhat in Diamond Castle. I  miss the older style of Barbie movies, with real romance and dance and true girlishness. Diamond Castle was good, the boys were handsome (for animation) and they at least TRIED to fight... but it was somewhat lacking. This one was a good blend of those classic basics and modern music with action and adventure. It could have used some work, though. Overall, it was enjoyable and the little girls I've watched it with enjoyed it, so 5 stars.",1245888000,9,2278,4.608374384236453

3875171,5,B0028Y4SPO,"So first let me say I absolutely LOVE Barbie, and I don't care whether I'm 14 or not, these movies will always have a special place in my heart.

The Three Musketeers is all about following your dreams, and believing in yourself, which are all concepts girls of ALL ages should follow! The movie's theme, and the way they followed the original book 'The Three Musketeers', made me rate this five stars. But I have a few cons with my pros.

PROS:

1) The movie is fun for all ages, I don't believe there is any bad content, except perhaps the fact the Regent (SPOILER ALERT) was trying to kill the Prince!

2) Barbie and her friends use encouraging phrases all through out the movie, even when people are putting them down (which is frequently).

3) (SPOILER ALERT) The kind old woman who helps them along the way is very original and cooky, and I found that was a great aspect to put into the movie.

4) The way they inserted different (non-frightening) weapons beside the usual sword, made the training a lot more interesting. And I was surprised how good Barbie and her friends used them.

CONS:

1) (SPOILER ALERT) Again--the Regent IS trying to kill the Prince, which is fine for someone my age, but for someone of a younger party, the plot might be a bit scary.

2) Some of the things being said by Barbie and her friends gets a little corny, which is not always a BAD thing for the younger ones who may or may not understand, but it gets a little old.

And the graphics in my opinion were great--the bloopers were funny, and the rest of the bonus features were a nice touch to the movie. All in all I recommend this buy, for ALL ages. (Now I must make my mother watch it with me!)",1334534400,5,1686,4.340764331210191

3875177,4,B0028Y4SPO,"To my bafflement, for I am a manly grown-up man, I'm here to review BARBIE AND THE THREE MUSKETEERS, a DVD I happened to sit thru when saddled with babysitting duties. Mattel has apparently been churning out this series of Barbie animated flicks with a focus on princessy fairy tale themes. This latest chapter is, of course, a role reversal take on Dumas' classic adventure. The iconic fashion doll plays Corinne, a hopeful 17-year-old French girl who leaves her lush Gascony countryside for the big city lights of Paris. With an introductory letter to Captain Trville of the King's Royal Musketeers in hand, Corinne is determined to follow in her father D'Artagnan's footsteps. But in Paris she's ill-prepared for the blanket derision that greets her. For who's ever heard of a female Musketeer? Captain Trville kindly rejects her.

A despondent Corinne lands a job as cleaning maid in the royal palace and it's not long before she runs into Aramina, Renee, and Vivica, three enterprising young maids who also dream of becoming a Musketeer. And when an elderly chambermaid turns out to be a sort of swashbuckling sensei, cue the training montages set to generic female empowering pop music. Really, the songs are the only things that cheesed me off about the film. The songs, and Corinne's incredibly annoying kitten who wants to be a ""Muscateer"" (no, seriously).

I'd bet my old collection of burly G.I. Joe action figures that this is one of the more action-oriented Barbie movies in the series. Surprisingly Corinne seems like she'd rather spend more time performing crazy acrobatics and dueling and adventuring than flirting with the handsome young Prince Louis. Prince Louis' coronation is fast approaching, even though he'd rather muck around with his inventions. Corinne and her friends stumble onto a plot to kill the prince, and you only have to cast a glance at the shady regent to suss out who's masterminding these assassinations. Sword fights and close shaves and sinister palace intrigue are elements I don't expect from Barbie movies, but as a manly man forced to sit thru these things, I will take it, and gratefully. The CG animation isn't up to what Pixar brings with its box office releases, but I think it's pretty good, even if the colors are a bit off. But the animators must've done a grip of motion capture renderings because the characters' movements look convincing and natural. Corinne, with her mad flips and somersaults and aerials, is particularly fun to watch.

There's nothing objectionable in the film. In fact, positive themes abound. Young girls should be able to pick up those enduring lessons, ones revolving around the rewards of perseverance and diligence and hard work and that gender shouldn't define one's position or limit one's options in life. Surprisingly, I found myself engaged in watching BARBIE AND THE THREE MUSKETEERS, from the opening moment with Corinne's practice session in the barn to the exciting climax at the masquerade ball (The ""Hedda Lettuce"" bit made me snort unbecomingly). Corinne would make a brilliant Disney heroine even though I keep hoping she'd accidentally skewer her pet kitten. But, yeah, Mattel has got a good thing going with this Barbie animated film franchise.

The DVD's bonus stuff:

- Fake bloopers which the kids may enjoy (00:02:00 minutes long)
- ""All for One"" Music Video
- ""Unbelievable"" Music Video which features that damn kitten's lead vocals
- ""Behind the Scenes: Barbie Fashion Show"" - this segment is pretty creepy as various New York fashion designers, models, and D-list celebrities jostle for camera time during a 2009 Barbie Fashion Show in New York (00:04:42 minutes)
- ""I Can Be... A Songwriter"" - meet songwriter Leslie Mills who co-wrote ""Making My Way"" for the film (00:02:35 minutes)

The modern music and short skirts. My daughters can learn what sexy is anywhere. I valued the classic stories because they were classy. Don't get me wrong, this isn't inappropriate at all! My daughters loved it, and I enjoyed it, but I could see where they were going and then the Mermaid Tale and the Barbie and the Fashion Fairytale. They are leaning towards the modern woman, which my girls see everywhere, I like teaching my daughters about modesty, manners, and being a princess.

3875194,5,B0028Y4SPO,"My 5 year old daughter loves the Barbie movies, so, of course, we had to get Barbie and the Three Musketeers. I happen to be a huge fan of the story of the Three Musketeers, and have seen most of the popular adult movies about this dynamic group, so I was extremely skeptical, but ready to sit down and watch it to make my daughter happy.

I was first surprised by the music in the movie. I have found myself tapping my toes to some of the other songs from previous Barbie movies, but these ones really seemed to catch my attention and to stay stuck in my head. With the exception of the remake of Unbelievable - some things should just not be remade!

The biggest surprise I received, however, was when the villain entered the picture and he was voiced by none other than Mr. Frank N. Furter himself - Tim Curry! This is the first time that I ever remember hearing a well-known actor taking on a role in the Barbie movies, and considering that I love Tim, I was instantly much more interested in the film.

Barbie and the Three Musketeers is a fun movie to watch. The music is fun and the story is classic, with just enough of a twist to make it highly enjoyable for young girls to watch.",1268352000,,1189,4.252212389380531

I know I have a 4 year old.  My daughter was so much in love with this movie that when we went to rent movies she rented it again.  Now I am going to get it for her for Valentines Day.  I would highley recommend this movie if your little girl is a Barbie fan or even loves horses.

I have watched bits and pieces of the movie and it is a really cute ""you can do anything"" story.

3875204,2,B0028Y4SPO,"My almost-4-year-old daughter and I have loved the Barbie videos that we've seen (Rapunzel, Nutcracker, Diamond Castle, 12 Dancing Princesses, Christmas Carol) -- until we watched the Three Musketeers. I'm glad I checked it out from the library for free before buying it. The movie started out good, with Barbie and main character Corrine leaving her home to journey to Paris to become a musketeer. Now, I'm all for having confidence, but I'm not sure how she thought she was prepared to do that when she'd only battled a scarecrow holding a sword. Anyway in Paris she's made fun of and told that girls can't be musketeers. The story continues as she meets three other girls and they all learn they have been secretly training to be musketeers.
My daughter wanted to stop watching the movie about 20 minutes in -- the first Barbie movie she hasn't wanted to watch all the way through. I talked her into continuing watching. But finally I decided it was silly and we skipped ahead to the end.
The musketeers defeated an army with a sword, some pieces of ribbon, fans, and a slingshot. Didn't make sense to me.

After seeing this movie, Barbie and the Three Musketeers, I began to have second thoughts about it. It was an okay movie, but here are some pro's and con's.
Pros:
1. The music was trendier than other movies.
2. The bond between the four girls was quite believable.
3. Kelly Sheridan was the main role in the movie, and lately, she hasn't, so this was definitely a perk.
4. The movie had some serious girl power!
5. The kitten was adorable, and I think it's cute how she wanted to be a ""Musk-cat-eer.""
Cons:
1. I enjoy the more ""princess-y"" movies, and this one, in our opinion, had too much fighting.
2. It didn't exactly have that ""Barbie Charm"" to it, and it's a bit too hard to explain what it is.
3. It just really didn't make me feel good after viewing it.

3875214,1,B0028Y4SPO,"I have most of the other Barbie movies [just for my own guilty pleasure, no kids in my household anymore] and I have to say that this is the weakest of the lot.

The Prince is a sad excuse for a masculine protagonist and dragging Barbie so far out of any recognizable female role just destroys all believability in the movie.  Have the writers run out of all credible female roles for Barbie to play that they must resort to having her do ""crouching tiger, hidden tiger"" type moves in mini-skirts in what is supposed to be pre-Revolutionary France?

Please, give us more on the order of the Twelve Dancing Princesses, Rapunzel, Swan Lake, or the Magic of Pegasus.  Oh, and leave the cutesy modern lingo behind -- responding ""sure"" when the Prince asks Corinne to dance isn't hip, it's just stupid.",1257638400,8,797,4.591549295774648

3875216,5,B0028Y4SPO,"This movie currently ranks #1 as my daughter's favorite Barbie movie, and it's one of her favorite movies overall.  The storyline is cute and holds her attention, and the modern music (especially a remake of EMF's Unbelievable) has her dancing around the living room, much to my amusement.  The parent in me likes that Barbie has friends with varied skin colors and talents (though of course one can criticize that they are all thin and beautiful), and the message that girls (or anyone, even the dreamer Prince) can do whatever they dream of doing is great.  My daughter also noticed and commented that Barbie had a lot to learn from the older woman in the movie.  I liked that Barbie recognizes the hypocrisy of the Prince in having his own dreams but denying the dreams of others, and in the end, Barbie is too busy foiling plots to kill the King to go off on a date:)

Extras:  there are bloopers which send my daughter into the giggles, and the video of the kitty singing Unbelievable is one of her favorites.

Overall:
While the plot is crazy and unrealistic, the movie is entertaining to a kid and provides a storyline that is age appropriate.  Yes, it's a bit saccharine, but that's perfect for the target audience, and it is amusing enough to me to make it tolerable (which is good since this movie is requested all the time).",1256515200,5,1335,4.579831932773109
3875217,4,B0028Y4SPO,"Mattel's latest gender-reversed classic in the ""Barbie"" animated series begins on a farm in Gascony where Corinne, daughter of the famous D'Artagnan, is practicing her swordfighting moves. (Her idea of swordfighting seems to owe more to the ""Zorro"" films than anything you would actually expect to find in 17th century France, but never mind.)

Corinne's life's ambition is to follow in her father's footsteps by becoming a royal musketeer. When she turns 17 she goes to Paris to enlist, carrying as D'Artagnan had before her, a letter of introduction to Monsieur de Treville, who is still Captain of the King's musketeers. (With the silver hair which is the only sign of age in this kind of film.)

Unfortunately for Corinne, the 17th century French authorities are not ready for the idea of a lady musketeer (probably this reluctance is the most plausible part of the film.) So instead she has to accept a job as a maid at the palace.

Just as D'Artagnan fell foul of ""the three musketeers"" on his first day in Paris and agreed to fight duels with each of them, Corinne has unfortunate meetings with three other girls while attempting to rescue her pet cat from an unpleasant dog belonging to the film's villain, and then finds that they are her new work colleagues.

Despite this unfortunate start, Corinne becomes friends with her new colleagues and it turns out that all four share an ambition to be royal musketeers. So they begin to train in secret.

Meanwhile the handsome Prince Louis, heir to the throne, is about to be crowned King on reaching his majority. His cousin Phillipe, who has been ruling France as Regent while Louis was a child, is less than happy at handing over power. Phillipe's nefarious plans are about to run into a most unexpected obstacle ...

From my adult perspective this was quite the most ridiculous of all the Barbie films - the fact that the music to the climax of the film was the song ""unbelievable"" seemed only too appropriate. But this isn't aimed at adults, it's aimed at little girls and I have to report that my eight year old daughter loved it, as did her twin brother. And in fact some of the jokes in the film are quite funny: they had my wife as well as our children laughing out loud and raised a few smiles even from me.

It has all the stock Barbie ingredients - a relentlessly positive heroine, a wicked villain, good and bad talking animals, etc. Like all the Barbie films ""Barbie and The Three Musketeers"" is also beautifully made, charming, and, if my daughter is anything to go by, can hold the attention of a little girl for hours.

Before we first rented any of the Barbie videos for my daughter, I was expecting them to be trite, over-commercialised, and over-sugary. In general, however, I have been pleasantly surprised.

Yes, they do have a lot of commercial spin-offs and a high saccharine count, but the quality of that film and the other Barbie videos we have subsequently bought or rented, was significantly higher than I had originally expected before I saw the first one. They have kept my children engrossed for hours - including my son as well as my daughter - and also introduced them to some beautiful stories. Several of them also introduced my children to some great musical classics: others, of which this is one, had instead enjoyable original or modern music. In all cases Mattel had hired first class international orchestras to provide the instrumental soundtrack.

On more than one occasion I have been listening to a CD of a classic such as Beethoven's pastoral symphony (Beethoven: Symphony No. 6), or ""The Queen of the Night's aria"" from Mozart's opera ""Mozart: The Magic Flute"", and my daughter, who was then five years old, recognised and expressed appreciation of the music, and correctly remembered which Barbie film had used it. (""Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus"" and ""Barbie Fairytopia: Mermaidia"" respectively.)

The music for ""Barbie and the three musketeers"" is easy on the ear, though this is not one of those Barbie films - there are some - which you would buy for the music.

For reference, the Barbie films with beautiful musical scores taken largely from the classics include

""Barbie of Swan Lake"" (with music from the ballet of that name)
""Barbie in The Nutcracker"" (ditto)
""Barbie and the Magic Of Pegasus"" (Beethoven)
""Fairytopia II: Mermaidia"" (Mozart)
""Barbie in the 12 dancing princesses dvd"" (Mendelsohn)
""Barbie in a Christmas Carol"" (various traditional carols)

The two best with music which is original rather than taken from the classics, are ""Barbie as The Island Princess"" and ""Barbie As The Princess and the Pauper"" the music for which I can particularly recommend.

In terms of production values, the DVD runs smoothly and is fairly easy to navigate around: it is as visually beautiful as any of the Barbie films to date, which is quite a high standard, and contains a few extras such as games.

Those people who enjoy criticising the way Mattel operate the Barbie franchise will not have much difficulty finding things in these films to sneer at. If you, or more importantly your kids, are allergic to an excess of twee sweetness, then these DVDs and the Barbie videos generally may not be for them.

One charge which is sometimes made against the Barbie films but which does not hold much water is the idea that they reinforce gender stereotypes, and that criticism does not appear at all applicable to this particular film. It's a gender reversed story, and the heroine and central character is far more interested in foiling plots against the King than in going on a date with him.

To summarise, these films are beautifully made, and will hold the attention of most small children for long enough for the typical exhausted parent to clear the mess they have made in several rooms of the house or collapse for an hour's rest after doing so. And there are enough more sophisticated jokes thrown in that you won't be completely bored to death if you decide to watch ""Barbie and the Three Musketeers"" with your offspring.",1256342400,57,6037,4.788461538461538

It has everything in it.  Sword fighting, action, castles, & a Reinassance time era & theme.  One of the best storylines ever too for the movie.

3875221,4,B0028Y4SPO,"As the mother of daughters, I have seen nearly every Barbie movie ever made.  Some are better than others.  This definitely ranked in the top five, perhaps the top three or four, because it was utterly hilarious.  Barbie (Corinne) goes to the city with a letter of introduction to become a Musketeer.  She is brushed off because she's a girl and ends up working as a servant in the palace.  As is typical in Barbie movies, a pretender to the throne is attempting to bump off the heir apparent, in this case a somewhat clueless prince who literally has his head in the clouds and is trying to invent a viable hot air balloon.  Barbie discovers that her fellow servants are also aspiring Musketeers and an elderly female servant, upon discovering their ambition, decides to train them.

It was refreshing to see an older woman sympathetically portrayed in a Barbie movie, and Madame's skills are clearly superior to the young Barbies.  She teaches them lot of fun moves, more consistent with martial arts sensibilities than old world swashbuckling.  This proves utterly hilarious as the 4 Barbies fend off legions of armed men using rapiers, long ribbons, fans, a slingshot, and a perfume mister.  My kids probably couldn't understand why I was laughing so hard.  Ninja Barbies, how cool!

Of course, there are a few annoying and formulaic anthropomorphic animals thrown in.  But as usual, believing in oneself, not giving up, and proving that girls are just as good as boys prevails in this Barbie feature.  Young girls probably cannot get enough of those messages.

The music wasn't half bad either.

My girls love the movie and are running around pretending to be musketeers now!  However, I am disappointed.  The songs don't fit the movie well and are not easy to sing along with like my girls prefer.  Also, I am all for girl empowerment, I strongly want my girls to feel they can accomplish anything they want.  However; I strongly object to women gaining power by trying to belittle men.  The prince was a weak dreamer who cowered as Corrine (Barbie) fought for him!  Would it have be so bad for them both to have been fighting the bad guys?
On the positive side, I do like the themes of working hard to gain your goals and teamwork that were portrayed.  Also, the cute byplay of the animals from previous movies was there.  (A little too much like Princess and the Pauper as it is the good cat and horse vs. the mean bully dog, but it doesn't detract from the movie.)",1253836800,14,1060,4.427835051546392

My daughter loved it especially the extra bonus features. My daughter is seven. My son who is 11 won't admit it but he enjoyed it too. He'll watch these movies but won't admit to it to his friends.

I monitor whtt my girls watch, ages 5 and 3 very closely. I am always on the lookout for snotty attitudes in movies that they could pick up (if you are a mom of girls you probably agree they don't need any additional assistance!) Anyways, that is why I gave Thumbelina away.

I enjoyed this movie for the most part. I think its neat to see the heroines in this movie work some serious moves. My daughters and their friends were cheering throughout the movie. Afterwards, the immediately set to pretending to be musketeers, and my 5 year old was asking me to buy her a real sword.

There are a couple parts in the movie however that I would have done without. Corinne had a few attitudes I would have done without when she felt she was being wronged. The traditional ""hmph!"" (pictured your 5 year old arms crossed glaring at you) was in there.....As well as some snooty girls at the ball thinking they were better than everybody else and arguing back and forth about it. It is little things like this that my girls will pick up on and I know it will come back to haunt me, so that is why I really did not like these attitudes in the movie. They could have done without them. Overall, it was cute and fun. My favorites are still 12 Dancing Princesses and Island Princess.",1253577600,29,1441,4.333333333333333
3875236,2,B0028Y4SPO,"Like most of the other recent Barbie movies, the animation, setting, characters, and costumes are all very beautiful, especially to a 6-year old girl.

And they want to be taken seriously as musketeers?!  All this while the song ""Unbelievable"" by the 80s rock band EMF plays with new girly lyrics. Barbie herself acts like a cross between Wonderwoman and an Olympic gymnast as she does impossible stunts all over the place to fight off the bad guys and rescue her (inept) prince.  As an adult, it's painful to watch.

We have several of the Barbie movies, and I have found that the ones with the best story and animation combined are the ones that are musicals: Barbie Island Princess (excellent!), Barbie Princess and the Pauper (pretty good), and Barbie Diamond Castle (not bad).  All of the rest of the Barbie movies are bad to awful, this one included.",1253404800,9,1018,4.8497109826589595

3 Musketeers is definitely our Second favorite behind the two I named above. It is a Great Adventure with a wonderful plot! It also teaches girls a great lesson, to go after their dreams....even if everyone tells them its impossible!

Barbie always seems to produce great movies on these classic themes, and Barbie & the 3 Musketeers will not disappoint!

My son liked it for the animation quality. ""Good texturing"" he said.

My 20 year old enjoyed it for the Barbie moments like the first time the four young ladies knocked off the glass fragments with boot, duster, and broom.  There is humor too, with the names of the girls as they enter the ball.

Summer, Ivana Party, Countess Hadda Lettuice and Winter are the hits of the night as they uncover a plot to kill the prince.  The girls are discouraged as they train under the tutelage of the head maid (who seems to be a musketeer in hiding) in the 'old' training hall.  Musketeer or Maid?  It's Girl power to the resuce for the whole family.

We have watched them so much we have had to buy 2nd copies to keep watching!! We love them all, some more than others, but I do recoment all of them...

We just bought ""barbie and the three musketeers"" to add  to our collection. We love it... Its fun, up beat and very exciting. One thing I love about this movie is that it does have great music and makes it fun for the kids so they can dance and sing along!!

I do have to say one thing though... i was a little dissapointed... My daughters favorite thing in the entire world is HORSES.. and when I saw the preview I thought their would be more horses in it.. .but there were not very many horses in it at all!.. I was really dissapointed with that...

I have found many of the previous Barbie movies to be exceedingly well done, so I had high expectations for this one. I realize this is a kids movie, but I just think this is not up to the standard set by ""The Nutcracker"", ""Princess and the Pauper"", ""Rapunzel"", or even any of the Fairytopia movies.
