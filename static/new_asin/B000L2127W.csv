2699678,5,B000L2127W,"It's a pity that ""The Long and Winding Road"" had to be removed from the penultimate scene for the DVD release, but otherwise this classic show is nearly perfect.  Both funny and moving, brilliantly written and beautifully acted, this is one of my all-time favorites, and I'm a huge fan of British TV.  Despite being somewhat dated, it still very much holds up, even with repeated viewings.  David Calder's performance is particularly memorable:  ""I'm a Soviet spy workin' the west, honey.  Whaddya want I should wear, a big fur hat and a 'I Love Leningrad' T-shirt?""  Don't skip the closing credits of the final episode, or you'll miss the last word on many of the characters....",1213920000,12,679,4.810344827586207
2699679,5,B000L2127W,"I saw this when it first aired and loved it.
After all these years, I still enjoyed it immensely!",1208736000,2,97,4.157894736842105
2699680,5,B000L2127W,"This brilliant satire on the bumbling post-Cold-War intelligence services of the UK, the USSR, and the USA, who spend so much time spying on each other that each service wildly misinterprets what the other is actually doing, is not to be missed. The plot may unfold slowly, but it will soon have you laughing out loud. The two KGB sleeper spies left out in the cold of England are Nigel Havers and Warren Clarke. The former, who has taken the capitalistic financial world of London by storm, is thoroughly delightful, and the latter, who has settled down with a wife, three children and a stuffed toy monkey named Morris in a working-class neighborhood in Manchester, is thoroughly lovable. During the previous twenty-five years of their sleeperhood, both have become typically and irrevocably English.

Many of the laughs come from the fine supporting cast (whose names Acorn Media, characteristically, has not provided on the DVD case): the two terribly proper MI5 agents, especially the cheese-paring ""C"" character who demands that his junior officer give a scrupulous account for every pound and pence he has spent on dinner at Burger King; the beauteous all work-and-no-play KGB agent, without an ounce of humor and the junior spy who loves her but cannot persuade her to go with him to see the latest West-End musical; the spy-master who originally sent the pair to England and has meanwhile landed in a Soviet looney bin; the head of the Soviet trade commission (nudge-nudge, wink-wink) with an American accent that is far more convincing than those of the two brash CIA officers, to whom the British refer dryly as their ""cousins."" The antics of all of them as they squabble over territory keep the laughs coming one after the other.

Underlying the humor is the serious issue of communication (or lack of it) between intelligence agencies; and historical hindsight indicates that some of the misreading----getting ""the wrong end of the stick""----by one side about what the other side is doing, is not so far off the mark. As one of the spies remarks in the film, when something is so wildly improbable, it is very likely to be true.

In any event, ""Sleepers"" is a keeper!",1197849600,20,2180,4.902439024390244
2699681,5,B000L2127W,"I don't own the dvd (yet), but I have a battered old VHS from when the series aired on American tv.  This is such a wonderful program, with a beautiful score by Graeme Revell that can be haunting or funny.  The miniseries is also haunting and funny.  An old vault is discovered in the depths of KGB headquarters that seems to contain records of a program to plant moles in England.  The head of the program is locked in an insane asylum and no one can get him to talk.  The idea of rogue agents who have been lost for 20 years understandably provokes panic among the Russian top brass, and Joanna Kanska's character is despatched to reel them in, supported by a hapless assistant and an ambassador who loves football (he means soccer).  The sleepers, who have got themselves British lives, think no way am I going back to Moscow, & go on the run, with plenty of funny moments.  Anyone who remembers all the budgetary complaints from Deputy Chief Peele in Sandbaggers will laugh hysterically when the SIS chief chastises his subordinate for eating at MacDonald's on company money.  (The British & Americans start following the Russians around to find out what they're doing as the Russians follow the sleepers.)  All in all, some of the best of British television.",1191801600,3,1263,4.653153153153153
2699682,5,B000L2127W,"Like the earlier reviewer, I have waited a long time for this terrific BBC miniseries to come to DVD.  It's a very interesting story of two men who were placed by the KGB in Britain as (possible) spies. Their instructions: Melt into the English population as if they were natives. And this they do. They are forgotten.  And when they have become entirely British...indeed one of the men is now married with children...they get

an urgent call on their antique Russian radio to ""reactivate"" as spies.

Panic, panic, panic...as the two men who are friends, try to run from the

Soviet spy machine.  They are everything but willing to have anything to do with the Soviets.  And one of the persons after them is a beautiful Russian agent.  A lot of fun and satire. Don't miss it.",1180396800,25,775,4.605839416058394
2699683,5,B000L2127W,"Warren Clarke and Nigel Havers are living well in England's 1980s-1990s,  respectively as a respected trade union man with wife and family, and as a rich, dashing investment banker.  Little did we know that they are not what they appear to be.  Wonderfully acted. All the actors are perfectly cast. If you're tired of blood and gore and unmentionable bad language, you must view this instead. (Warren Clarke is a talented actor, with ordinary looks, but dependable.  He also appeared in Reilley, Ace of Spies.)",1180310400,8,510,4.964705882352941
2699684,5,B000L2127W,"I've waited for years to see this thriller again.  It's an example of what BBC was once able to do: create the nearly perfect drama.  Everything about this classic is right.  The casting is perfect; in a just world, Clarke would have been given many awards.  There is much humor.  And the spy story keeps your interest from beginning to end.  How delightful to see this available.  Don't miss it.",1175817600,37,396,4.571428571428571
2699685,5,B000L2127W,"The DVD arrived about a week ago in very good condition, therefore I did not realise it was ""used"".  The rating of service is 5 stars, just like the show itself -- which was television at its best.  As an exiled Brit I liked the portrayal of the UK ""class system"", and the uptight CIA operatives.  Zorin (played by Michael Gough) stole the show with his Betjeman quotations.",1368921600,,374,4.470588235294118
2699686,5,B000L2127W,One of the best-ever shows to run on the Masterpiece Theatre series! Only Traffic was better. Very suspensful the entire way through.,1358208000,,133,5.090909090909091

2699688,5,B000L2127W,"This is a good day. I was hunting for something else, as we all do, at another to be unnamed site selling DVDs, when I saw the listing for British TV Series. Suddenly this show flashed back into my brain. Well sort of. You see I have been struggling to remember the name of this series for years. We have all experienced this phenomenon. Frustrating. Quizzing people. Combing the Interwebs. NOTHING.

Well long story short, one WikiGoo search later, I finally found the name and now the DVD. Hurray!

I saw this when it first came out. It was excellent. The plot. The actors. Havers and Clarke are great foils for each other. The sophisticated Havers and the working man Clarke. It has been on my mental wish list, though I could not remember the name, for years.

I highly recommend this series. If you enjoy good British action/comedy/drama you will enjoy this. And do not worry the accents will not do you in.

I only wish my mental processes would have been better at remembering the name. I also got stymied by the Kevin Bacon movie by the same name.

Please get this one you will not be disappointed.

2699689,5,B000L2127W,"First saw this and recorded it on VHS in the early 90's.  Having spent a month in the USSR on a study tour for a month in the late 70's, and got my degree with a minor in Russian language, (4 years worth) history, culture and literature, this cracked me up.

Then going into the Frankfurt PX stereo shop when I was in Deutschland in 1986 when I was in the United States Army and seeing some Russkies in full uniform, with their official military car parked outside, scarfing up stereos and cameras.

Hmmm, I guess they ain't coming thru  the Fulda Gap too soon if they're driving to Frankfurt to shop at the PX.",1281312000,,611,4.28695652173913
2699690,5,B000L2127W,"I am almost embarrassed to join the queue of praise for this . . . well, sleeper of a series. Yet since it is virtually the only sensible or entertaining treatment of this subject ever produced for either the silver or the home screen, it needs all the praise it can get. Truth may be stranger than fiction, but it's seldom as funny. It's certainly not as funny as ""Sleepers.""

Should the BBC ever produce a sequel to ""Sleepers,"" I hope that its stars--Warren Clarke, Nigel Havers, and David Calder--will still be around and be able to assume their old parts. Perhaps the sequel could be entitled ""Sleepers II: We're Doing It for the Children.""",1280448000,,644,4.6
2699691,5,B000L2127W,"Was I glad to see this mini series released on DVD. The chemistry between Warren Clarke and Nigel Havers is superb... Originally starting out with a common goal they each end up on a different level in the social ladder.

2699692,5,B000L2127W,"My wife and I saw the original on TV twice, and the assumed we could soon buy it from PBS or some other vendor. Years went by, and other shows of varying quality came out on VHS and eventually on DVD, but no Sleepers. We queried Google repeatedly, and we got the impression that the BBC had lost the film.
So when Sleepers,the real stuff, not Hollywood, actually arrived, we were overjoyed.  We have watched it several times and always enjoy it. Why it took so long for this masterpiece to be published is hard to explain, but as they say, All is well that ends well.",1241827200,4,567,4.299065420560748
2699693,2,B000L2127W,watched the first two sections - didn't even want to see the rest. I'd put one or no stars but can't get back to edit that.,1235347200,2,123,3.769230769230769
2699694,5,B000L2127W,"Very funny and touching. The acting is superb all round and the interaction between working class Warren Clarke and toff Nigel Havers is excellent. I especially like the way the CIA are portrayed as the rich big brothers driving around in limosines using the latest satellite phones whereas MI5 troll behing in an ageing Metro stopping to use payphones, 'More change George, more change!"". Its a classic farce and vey nostaligic for those of us over 40 who look back fondly at 1980s Britain.",1231804800,2,491,4.857142857142857
8159970,5,B000L2127W,Absolutely brilliant. A gem of a series form the BBC. A few cliches but very enjoyable to watch. Great acting from Warren and Nigel helped by a witty and intelligent script. 5 stars.,1519084800,,182,4.545454545454546
8159971,5,B000L2127W,"This wry spy story about a couple of Soviet 'sleeper agents' who don't want to go home is well written, well acted, and just plain funny. It hasn't lost its bite, either.",1513728000,,170,4.34375

8159973,5,B000L2127W,"Just watched this again last night -All four hours in one go. It really is one of the best series the BBC has ever produced. Well-written, tightly-directed, and cast with actors who totally ""got"" what they were doing. Nigel Havers and Warren Clarke in particular were perfect as the two soviet sleeper spies who refuse to come back in to the cold. They brought tremendous depth to their characters, elevating the series to something better than typical television. Like a good book, the plot takes its time unwinding, but the twists and turns continue to the very end, with plenty of emotion, suspense, and laughter along the way. The satire is wide-ranging, targeting cold war and glasnost politics, counterespionage agencies, and the British class system. If you're too young to remember the 80s-90s you might not get some of the humor, but spy story will keep you engaged and entertained. It's a shame that it took so long for this to be released on DVD, and that it has fallen out of print. It's a classic from the time when they still made television for grownups.",1431820800,,1069,4.752688172043011
8159974,5,B000L2127W,"Fantastic story! Great comedy that is somewhat prescient given the time when it came out. Two KGB moles sent to Britain  in the mid-60s.  The KGB doesn't know about them, but stumbles upon the unauthorized operation and now wants to get them back. The CIA, MI5 and, the Russians are all a bit clueless.",1425340800,,302,4.574074074074074

8159978,5,B000L2127W,"If you're old enough to remember the Cold War and the '60's, this short series will take you back there. The acting is good, the plot, well, it's a spy drama, o.k... There are a few wonderfully funny moments amidst the low speed action.
