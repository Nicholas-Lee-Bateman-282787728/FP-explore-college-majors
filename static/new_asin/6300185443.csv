(By all rights, this should count as a Verified Purchase!)  As befitting the collection and part of the title, Lon  Chaney, Jr. is the true star of this film.

In a juxtaposition of Larry Talbot/Wolf Man wishing death and Frankenstein ['s monster] desiring life, this movie works on numerous levels.  Mostly, the work of Lon Chaney, Jr is what makes this movie believable.  He works hard at his craft.  It's Lugosi as Frankenstein that hurts the movie.

220113,4,6300185443,"Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man & House of Frankenstein, DVD

The story of Frankensteins Monster was written by Mary Shelley nearly two hundred years ago. It found favor with readers over the decades. It was adapted to a movie in 1931 and became a favorite with audiences. Some say that an economic recession creates an interest in horror movies, a symbolism that comforts people. Frankensteins Monster represents the man-made Great Depression that was the worst in the 20th century. Then World War II came along to make these films kid stuff. The 1974 recession saw the most popular horror movie of all time, even if it took place on the seashore [a great white shark attacks people by a town that depends on fishing and tourists].

Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man (1942) uses the characters from The Wolf Man movie for a sequel. Some said the cyclical predations of a werewolf symbolized the economic cycles of prosperity and recession that plagued the world in the 1930s. This has a musical number for entertainment. In the end the village people gather together to put an end to Frankensteins castle and the monster within it. But we know that these monsters will rise again [as long as there is a paying audience].

House of Frankenstein (1944) tells what happened to Draculas coffin and skeleton. This exhibit is mishandled so Dracula is free to attack people until he suffers from a fatal case of sunburn. Later they find the Wolf Man and Frankensteins Monster in an icy cavern. Warmth frees them, and they travel to Visaria. Ilonka knows how to shoot a pistol with a silver bullet. Can the village people put an end to the monster? [This movie has some interesting character developments.]",1465603200,,1697,4.824742268041237

220156,4,6300185443,"Well, it just had to happen. FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLFMAN is one of those blatantly absurd, yet absolutely enjoyable films, created after someone said, ""Hey! Let's find a way to get these two monsters to fight each other!"". Forget about the original films and their stories. Bah! Who needs a plot? FMTW has Lon jr. reprising his fuzzy Larry Talbot role, now trying to find a way to be exterminated, in order to end his accursed, lycanthropic torment. This leads him to his old gypsy friend, Maleva (Maria Ouspenkaya!), who leads him to Dr. Frankenstein, who turns out to be dead. Luckily, the castle ruins remain, and someone tall, green, and grimacing, is trapped in the catacombs below! Enter the lumbering Frankenstein's monster, now played by Bela Lugosi! The Wolfman growls and the monster grunts, and the epic battle is on! Of course, you'll have to wait a while, since the ultimate confrontation is saved for the explosive finale.

220160,5,6300185443,"This section is for ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman,"" which is a misnomer because the only Frankenstein appearing is the Baron's granddaughter and the title obviously refers to the monster although I doubt if that stiff, lumbering creature could've ever moved as limberly as depicted on the movie poster.

This screenplay is much more literate and explanatory than most of them, perhaps because it was penned by Curt Siodmak, and the opening scenes, in the cemetery where Lawrence Talbot is interred in the family tomb are atmospheric and definitely set the stage for a few chills. In fact, the first part of the film, in which Talbot is reawakens, escapes his tomb after dispatching one of his would-be graverobbers, and ends up in a hospital with amnesia, not knowing he's been dead for four years, is the best part of the movie. It's only when he goes in search of the gypsy Maleva, tramping halfway across Europe, in hopes of having her free him of his curse that the story begins to fall back into the usual ""Frankenstein"" mold. A much better story would've been dwelling on Talbot's travails and leaving the monster out of it altogether.  However...

Though the story is fairly free of the usual histrionics and cliches the other films in this series display, the theme from then on out is still the same. There's a cameo by Dwight Frye as a villager, nearly dressed and nearly unrecognizable without his hunched back. The Baroness is mainly notable for her very stylish--and slightly outlandish--40's fashions. The hat she wears in her first scene is a beaut! The villagers' actions to rid themselves of the monster are past stupid. They scream in terror, a few women actually appear to go into convulsions of fear, then all flee in terror. The monster is definitely a party-pooper, breaking up the ""New Wine"" festival with a vengeance. They propose to blow up the dam outside the village to destroy the remains of Frankenstein's castle, not thinking that to do so might also submerge the village.

All in all, I consider this one of the best in the franchise. Certainly better-written and better-acted than most, with all the original characters out of the way and Lon Chaney Jr coming to the fore, displaying a bit of the acting ability he was to show with such force in ""Of Mice and Men."" There's plenty of explanatory and half-way intelligent dialogue, not merely, ""Eek! The monster, let's kill 'em!"" The one irony in the entire film is that Bela Lugosi plays the monster, a role he turned down in the original because of the feature-obscuring make-up, his lines reduced to an occasional ""Aargh"" or two.

This movie can almost stand alone without the others to surround it.

I wish I could be as laudatory about ""House of Frankenstein."" About the only thing outstanding about it is the ""special effect"" called ""special filming"" here, of Dracula transforming into a bat which was revolutionary for its time, I suppose. This film also introduce Dracula's persona of ""Baron Latos"" to the film-viewing world. For the proper chronological order, I think this one should be watched before the Wolfman movie. It does have a little more scope than some, especially with such a cast of actors who were well-known then and became better-known in the 50's. Indeed Elena Verdugo was a familiar face on TV well into the 70's.  As far as I'm concerned, however, the best part of the movie is the segment with Dracula before the monster ever appears. In fact, it's almost like two short movies connected by Dr. Nieman's caravan as it rolled from one portion of the story to the other.

The big draw, of course, was the idea of all Universal's monsters in one film...well, most of them, the invisible man is conspicuously absent...or is he? How can we tell if he's invisible? He may be silently watching and laughing. Nevertheless, it's a fun romp, a little less formulaic than most because it gets out of the castle and has a little more scope and range.

220161,5,6300185443,This is a very scary movie. Bela Lugosi's role as Frankenstein makes the monster frightening. The last scene of the movie is the most memorable.

220357,4,6300185443,"In case people forgot, because it isn't mention in this movie, the monster (Bela Lugosi) is still blind from the botched brain transplant in The Ghost of Frankenstein, hence the need to hold his arms outstretched.  As for the plot, we quickly learn that grave robbing isn't all it's cracked up to be when dealing with the crypt housing Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney).  Someone gets chewed and Wolf Man hits the road to seek a cure from Dr. Frankenstein.  Unfortunately, the doctor is no longer in residence and his home is in ruins.  The next best thing would be to retrieve his notes and to find a doctor willing to utilize the forbidden knowledge.  Unfortunately, mad scientists being what they are, the monster is revived and mayhem quickly takes over.  A dam is involved.  Things do not end well.

The second feature, House of Frankenstein, turns out to be a hodgepodge of craziness introducing a new villain (Boris Karloff as Dr. Niemann).  The first part is a buddy-road-flick as the evil doctor and his crazy sidekick (J. Carrol Naish) set out on a journey of revenge.  But first, Dr. Niemann decides to revive Dracula (John Carradine).  Why?  Why not?  Maybe because they wanted to animate a cartoon bat to kill Niemann's arch nemesis Burgermeister Hussman (Sig Ruman).  That took all of a few minutes before they arrived at the ruins of Frankenstein manor.  They find a secret ice room in the sub-sub-basement housing the monster and the Wolf Man.  Naturally, they all want the records of Dr. Frankenstein and soon set up shop to carry on their mad scheme to give the monster another brain.  While the Wolf Man ends up with a gypsy girl he doesn't want.

As for the plot, it's simply two stories jammed together.  The first half deals with a couple of grave robbers disturbing the rest of wolf man Talbot, unleashing the horror once more on the world.  With the help of Maleva (Maria Ouspenskaya), Larry heads off to find an instant cure from Dr. Frankenstein.  Naturally, the dear doctor is long dead, leaving the only other option his missing diary.  Barring that, help from his daughter Baroness Elsa Frankenstein (Ilona Massey) and a rather duplicitous Dr. Mannering (Patric Knowles).  If not for the pesky neighbors, everything might have turned out quite differently.

I like everything about this film except Lugosi's mutilated footage reducing him to a staggering stiff armed menace.  If they didn't appreciate Lugosi's accent they shouldn't have hired him in the first place.  Or they could have dubbed his speaking part.  Butchering this movie in order to make it ""work"" was not the solution.  They ended up with half of a good movie.",1406419200,,1189,5.01530612244898

The DVD I purchased from Amazon delivered a pristine video of the movie. Quality in reference to picture, contrast, and audio is excellent.

Yes Bela walking around with his arms out and grunting.  He doesn't say one word which is amazing considering that in the previous Frankenstein movie, The Ghost of Frankenstein, Bela played Igor and Igor's brain was put in the monster who then spoke with a Hungarian accent.

Sitting here now, amidst all the mindless CGI, movies with annoying bimbos with their t-shirts falling off and arrogant, talent less jocks polluting the air, there was some magic back then that's not always around today. I recall, writing this review, how the horror crowd was up and antsy about the heavily anticipated Freddy Vs. Jason. When it came on screen, their enthusiasm proved to be true when the sales came in at the box office. Because of the obvious fan love, producers everywhere started slamming their heads together trying to pair off more that would work and work well.
Those producers just don't get it, and sadly they probably never will.

You see, it's not the charm of ____ vs. ____ that sells, it's WHO Vs WHO that sells. There's either magic there, or there's not. There's either history there...or there's not. Bottom line. Freddy Vs Jason worked, it just did. You can't force those things to work. You can't say, hey, because our company owns both of these names, let's throw them together and make money! It works, or it doesn't, and the fans know from the start what will. Of course this bloody wrestling match didn't begin with Freddy Vs Jason, or even Demonic Toys Vs Dolls. It began way back when, before many of us were born...the Universal Monsters.

Ah, Frankenstein, Ah, the wolf man, Ah, where did I put my cigarettes? I know I had the stupid things around here somewhere. Back on topic, and away from my nicotine cravings, I can accurately say that I sat down with the utmost enthusiasm when viewing this little monster bash.

The plot is, of course, unrealistic but still enjoyable. After four years of slumber the wolf man is awakened from an un restful sleep to find himself still cursed with lycanthropy. Twisted inside and emotionally regretful, he ventures out to obtain a cure so that this madness and agony can be ended once and for all. Desperate, he seeks out the gypsy woman from the first film, hoping she has a treatment in mind. She doesn't know of one, but has a spark of inspiration. Why not try the infamous Dr. Frankenstein, the one who meddles with monsters in the first place? Their hunt eventually finds the monster in ice, and after being thawed, the Wolf Man and Frankenstein become friends. Larry Talbot tries to protect the monster from more town mob lynching, while Frankenstein appreciates a friend but still has a large chip on his shoulder. The ending dissolves this friendship, however, as the two fight over an abrupt choice and their 'ending' is decided for both of them.

 Bela Lugosi dons the bolts in this film. He's a wonderful actor but unfortunately as Frankenstein he's lacking. It looks like his earlier refusal of playing the monster turned around when the monster ended up so famous and financially resourceful. While not bad, he just doesn't fit and it shows. As a side note, the studio cut out any references to his blindness or Igor's brain being in his skull from the last film, Ghost of Frankenstein. Thankfully, he is not the major role in this film; Lon Chaney Jr takes the limelight, handling all the verbal exchange and motivations. His desperation and moodiness show through clearly, propelling the flick forward to a tragic, and yet somehow fun, ending. Maria Ouspenskaya is as good as she was in the original. Ilona Masey as Frankenstein's daughter is breathtaking and she performs well, but doesn't have much to keep her occupied.  The acting is a great aide.

The set pieces are breathtaking as always; the whole atmosphere is rich, eerie, gothic, moody, sensational. It doesn't have all the pizzazz and spark of its predecessors, but it's a noteworthy attempt that still fits. The opening in the graveyard sets the mood strong, and the ending is a bit too abrupt yet still tragic and fun at the same time. The further destruction of the castle is a sight to behold; it marks a significant event in the series.

This fun Universal romp does have its shares of flaws. The plot has some holes that make fans of the original films flinch. Larry Talbot's depressing act is played out well, but too much focus on it and no other change can grow a bit stale.  Also, the ending is very sudden. I would have preferred a slow lukewarm response to each other, and then hatred, and finally a fight. This way, though, it was kind of abrupt and sudden, not really what you'd think of when naming a movie ""Frankenstein meets the Wolf Man.""

While a great film, The Wolf Man never did gain the notoriety Dracula and ol' Frank did. Larry Talbot got his sequels, but not as a solo act. Instead, another monster had to be tossed in the ring to bring in the crowds, as was the case here and with House of Frankenstein and House of Dracula. Frankenstein meets the wolf man mainly develops the character of our furry friend, though. It's obvious to anyone watching it that the movie is basically about Larry Talbot and his seeking a cure to end his misery, not really about both of them equally.

Overall it's a good fun flick where it pays off to sit through. If you can get through the choppy editing and some heavily laid on melodrama, you'll be smiling. If you're only a fan of Frankenstein, though, this film may not be for you. He's not shown that often and certainly not as his best. Fans of the Wolf Man will love it, for it shows a definite continuation from the original story.

220543,3,6300185443,"There is a long story involved in why ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man"" is a just-OK entry in the series.

At the end of the previous film, ""The Ghost of Frankenstein"" (in which Lon Chaney Jr. portrayed the Monster), it was found that the brain which Frankenstein's son was going to use to correct his father's mistake had been switched by a jealous rival to that of the murderous Ygor; imagine his horror when in interviewing the ""healed"" Monster, he heard the voice of Ygor coming from the Monster!!  But then the Monster went blind because the blood types were wrong and couldn't feed the sensory nerves; in his rage, he blindly set the place ablaze, and brought about his own destruction one more time.

Based upon this premise, the sequel to the sequel to the sequel, etc., ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man"" needed Bela Lugosi, who had portrayed Ygor, to play the Monster, and the script reflected all that had happened in the previous film.  Upon finding the Monster, Larry Talbot enlists his aid to locate the original Frankenstein journals to put an end to his life as a lycanthrope.  The Monster, who is now blind, weak, and talking in Ygor's voice, tells him when their search ends up fruitless, about the doctor's daughter, who Talbot then enlists to help.

But when the film was shown to a pre-release audience of Universal employees, they laughed at a Frankenstein Monster speaking with a Hungarian accent!  Therefore, all scenes in which Lugosi spoke were excised from the film (there are still two scenes in the finished film where you can see Lugosi mouthing silent words), and the Monster was only shown stumbling around.  A scene where he makes his way into town during festivities, scaring all the townspeople, is in the film, where Larry Talbot runs up to him to take him away, the Monster snarls at him, and Talbot has to tell him ""It's ME!"" so he'll come away.  I'm sure that scene also puzzled audiences then as now.

In the interest of History, and 2013 being the 70th anniversary of this film, Universal should be digging in their archives to release this film AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED; with the Monster's dialogue scenes intact.

This being Hollywood, and occurring way before home video was even a glint in anyone's eye, the scenes may no longer exist.  But it would be a nice way to commemorate the anniversary of a film that wound up more confusing than very good.  As it stands, it's an all-right film.  If it had been issued the way it was intended, it might have been much better.",1373068800,4,2517,4.665158371040724

A bit of trivia : Chaney of course played The Wolfman ( and does again in this film), but he was also played the Frankenstein Monster in the previous film :Ghost of Frankenstein. Bela Lugosi was tapped to play the  Frankenstein Monster in this film which is also interesting because in the previous film he played ""Igor"" whose brain was transplanted into the monster.
House Of Frankenstein is the next sequel which stars Boris Karloff as the evil scientist out to carry on the work of Dr. Frankenstein.
He finds Chaney ( The Wolfman) and The Monster (now played by Glenn Strange) trapped in ice. He revives them and the action begins. Count Dracula (played by John Carridine) also makes an appearance. Both films are good old fashioned wholesome fun.",1372204800,,920,4.859872611464968
220547,5,6300185443,"""Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man"" opens with maybe the most atmospheric and chilling opening in any of Universal's monster movies. The graveyard & Talbot crypt were certainly spooky--even in the daylight--as two unfortunate grave robbers open the grave of Larry Talbot, conveniently on the night of a full moon.

Certainly with that opening scene & the later awesome transformation scene with Lon Chaney in the hospital bed, we were on our way to an outstanding ""Wolf Man"" sequel. Unfortunately, Frankenstein's Monster would rear his ugly head.

And speaking of that Monster, Poor Bela Lugosi seems to always get the blame dumped on him for why this movie was hacked up during post-production--the story being that the Monster with Bela's voice was too ""Hungarian Funny."" Yet no one seemed to have a problem with the Monster's Hungarian voice at the end of ""The Ghost of Frankenstein"". So what was the problem now?

Well, anyone who's ever gotten a peek at the original shooting script can probably decipher what the real problem was--the usually great Curt Siodmak wrote some rather crappy lines for the Monster to speak--lines that would've made Karloff look bad had he been playing the monster for this movie. I believe at one point the Monster says something to the effect of ""I will live to see the fruits of my wisdom for all eternity."" Really, now?

Also, the continuity of the monster's story from ""Ghost"" to this film is all screwed up as the movie seems to hint at times that it was Ludwig Frankenstein who created the monster & not the original Henry Frankenstein played by Colin Clive.

But yet--despite all its problems--I still enjoy the heck out of FMTWM. It serves its purpose as being a great vehicle for Lon Chaney and his baby, The Wolf Man & the ending clash of the monsters is just plain fun.

So overall, I would say the first Universal Monster Mash was a success--even with Bela's chopped up performance. 4 1/2 stars

And ""House of Frankenstein"" is a movie I've always loved from the first time I saw it on AMC many years ago. Boris Karloff makes a welcome return to the Universal monster series as Mad Doctor Gustav Neimann, J. Carrol Naish is excellent as the murderous, yet pitiable hunchback and Lon Chaney is back as the Wolf Man. Throw in Dracula & Frankenstein's Monster to boot & you have a very entertaining ""Monster Mash"" movie. 5 stars

220591,4,6300185443,"Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man has several things going for it while at the same time being severely flawed. First of all, it's really a sequel to The Wolf Man. And what a sequel! It has by far the best Wolf Man footage in the whole series, which for a ""Frankenstein"" series really became The Wolf Man series, as one reviewer pointed out. Chaney's initial transformation in his hospital bed while staring at the full moon outside his window is fantastic! After it is complete, he kind of turns and stares into the camera before the dissolve. Totally cool. And then the next scene is the Wolf Man running around on a dark street, ducking into a doorway, then hopping on top of boxes, then leaps off out of sight. The poor bobby who is watching all this should have called in sick that night because the next thing he knows (with a music cue warning) the Wolf Man pops out of no where and starts ripping into his throat. It always amazed me that a) with all of this neck gnashing, there was NEVER any blood and b) they allowed the Wolf Man to have fangs but NEVER any of the Draculas (Lugosi, Carradine or Chaney Jr.)..Anyway, the opening of Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man is really superior. It is so spooky and well done and underplayed. You imagine the poor Freddy Jolly stuck in the crypt getting attacked by the awakened Wolf Man while his pal is falling over himself to get away from the cemetery, lucky to be alive. The monster, however, does not fair so well. I disagree with everyone who says that Lugosi as the Frankenstein Monster was was casting. Well, I mean, of course, it was - but it's LUGOSI - as the monster. Come on, guys! His close up while getting a much needed jolt of electricity is worth the price of all the butchering Universal did to poor Bela's performance. Lugosi gives Patrick Knowles's Dr. Mannering a Dracula worthy smile/ sneer. It is so Lugosi. But, yea, Bela didn't quite match Ed Parker as the monster in the first few shots of him being discovered by Larry Talbot in the ruins. Parker was obviously a stunt double, but he looked more in shape and svelt than the pudgy Lugosi or the pudgy Chaney Jr. did in the previous film in the series, ""Ghost of Frankenstein"" (or the heavier Boris Karloff in ""Son of Frankenstein"" for that matter). Weird how a monster who was burned in a windmill, then exploded in a castle, then boiled in sulphur, then burned and buried by another castle could keep getting heavier. Anyway, the plot of FMTWM is absurd - Dr. Mannering actually leaves his practice at a large hospital to follow a possible serial murderer (who turns out to be a real McCoy werewolf) through Europe? Really? And then he completely turns on a dime his character of being the voice of reason in the story, the most rational guy in the movie, and goes bent, giving in to an irrational and irresistible urg to see the monster at full power, knowing everyone will be in grave danger. Oh, well. What I want to know, is why does Chaney have to go through all of this just to die? So if he got his head cut off, will he somehow spontaneously grow another and start biting people again? Wouldn't that kill him? He's flesh and blood!! Draw off his power electrically? Really? Okay! I love these movies so much, I'll bye it.

House Of Frankenstein is a lot of fun as well. It's great the way everyone in the movie knows all about Dracula and the Wolf Man and the Frankenstein Monster without the internet or telephones. Karloff, who has been in a dungeon for 15 years actually finishes George Zucco's sentences when describing Dracula's legend. And he knows all about The Wolf Man's story, even the details of Dr. Mannering, when he literally falls over their frozen bodies in Frankenstein's ruins. Amazing! And Karloff saying he never met Dr. Frankenstein but learned his secrets from his brother who assisted Frankenstein. Really? The idiot hunchback Fritz? He didn't even know a normal from an abnormal brain! Anyway, HOF is a lot of fun. And I disagree with the reviewer who said John Carradine was a low rent Dracula. Oh, give me Lugosi any day (his return as the Count in Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein was nothing short of glorious)  but John Carradine had many great moments. It was his lack of fangs and his fake moustache hanging off in his death scene that may throw some off. And maybe that, as written, this is a poor excuse for the king of vampires. I mean he couldn;t just swipe the stake in Karloff's hand before he gets a chance to drive it back in once he took it out? And to give himself over to Karloff who promised to protect his coffin while he sleeps instead of taking care of it for himself and finding a neat hiding spot no one could find in a zillion years? Especially since Karloff's Dr. Neiman eventually does betray him and has his coffin tossed out of the wagon like this morning's trash. Okay.. but don't blame Carradine for that. John Carroll Nash as Daniel was a perfect addition to the rogues gallery of Universal freaks. A poor man's Ygor, but in that grand tradition. Always love to see him in a movie. So, Dracula, The Wolf Man and the Monster AND Boris Karloff as a mad doctor who just happens to have just the right size lab table and electrical equipment to revive a seven foot monster? My favorite line in the movie-Larry Talbot: ""Why have you freed me from the ice which imprisoned the beast that lives within me?"" Because we love the Wolf Man, thats why!",1371081600,2,5434,4.493427704752275
220592,4,6300185443,"Despite its inconsistencies and problems with continuity, anyone who is a fan of the Universal Studios classic monsters and horror movies of the 1940's and '30's will undoubtedly enjoy ""Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman"" released in March of 1943. Brilliantly reprising his role as the tormented lycanthrope Larry Talbot, Lon Chaney Jr. gives a heartfelt and moving performance. Bela Lugosi plays the Frankenstein monster in what I will describe here as an underrated and controversial performance. Fans of classic cinema and the Universal monster rallies of the '40's may already be aware of the unique problem with this film which was caused by Universal execs cutting and deleting an extremely important plot point in this film. At the end of 1942's ""The Ghost of Frankenstein"" the Frankenstein monster's (played by Lon Chaney Jr. for the first time) brain was removed and the second son of Frankenstein Ludwig (played by Cedric Hardwicke) was manipulated by his assistant (played by Lionel Atwill) and unknowingly replaced it with the brain of the evil megalomaniac Ygor (played by Bela Lugosi). However the operation wasn't totally successful and left the Ygor-Monster blind before he wrecked the mansion and a fire destroyed everything. Now after Larry Talbot discovers the monster in an ice cavern below the ruins of the mansion (now a castle) and thaws him out. What happened next was supposed to be a series of scenes and interesting plot dialogue where Bela Lugosi as the Ygor-Monster talks to Larry about what happened in the previous film and how he wants to be rejuvenated and given full power and have his blindness cured and so forth. For some reason, Universal execs weren't happy with Bela's performance, his Hungarian accent coming out of the monster's mouth, etc. which is odd since at the end of ""Ghost of Frankenstein"" Bela as  the Ygor/Monster gives a chilling performance. Anyways, all those scenes were cut, no references to him being blind were mentioned, no references to the monster being Ygor, and what's left is he walks around with the what is now famous outstretched arms groping through the scenery. Stills exist and dialogue from the original script can be viewed on the web and in books. Somewhere in the Universal vaults the footage may be around but as of 2013 it has never been found. Personally, I think they made a big mistake but the film is still enjoyable but its one of those movies which COULD have been so much better. There are more scenes cut, like between Dr. Mannering (played by Patric Knowles) and Bela Lugosi's monster where Bela convinces the doctor not to drain off his energy but to restore him to full power. right at the beginning of the climactic operation/ Wolfman vs. Monster fight scene we can luckily still see a smidgeon of Bela's genius which Universal didn't cut thankfully, as the doctor does indeed begins to restore the monster to full power, a chilling close-up of Bela's face as he gives a knowing, totally evil, satisfied grin of recognition at the doctor as he now knows he is about to be unleashed with full power. The movie is beautifully photographed, the opening Llanwelly Village cemetery scene is  atmospheric and ghostly. Unfortunately Universal often tampered with their monsters, leaving important stuff out, not explaining previous plot points, not bothering to explain continuity in the sequels etc..",1371081600,,3380,5.023172905525847

220594,5,6300185443,"My favorite of Universal's second cycle of horror films. A direct sequel to 1941's The Wolf Man. Grave robbers out to steal gold rings & cash from the Talbot crypt accidently expose Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney) to the full moon reviving the wolf man. This film follows Larry Talbot on his search to find a cure to his curse. His journey takes him to the ruins of Castle frankenstein where he encounters the frankenstein monster played for the only time by Bela Lugosi. Great sets, moody music and solid acting make this one perhaps the best of the 1940's horror series. Some trivia: The previous ""frankenstien"" movie was Ghost of Frankenstein in which Chaney played the monster and Lugosi played ""Igor"" whose brain wound up transplanted in the monster. Also Lon Chaney was the only actor to play all of Universals classic monsters and the only actor to play the wolf man in the universal films. Chaney played the wolf man ( in 5 films ), Dracula in Son Of Dracula, The Mummy (Kharis) in 3 films,  and the Frankenstein monster in Ghost Of Frankenstein. He also double as the monster in place of Glenn Strange for certain scenes in  House of Frankenstein and Abbott & Costello meet Frankenstein. Stock footage of Chaney as the monster also appeared at the climax of House of Dracula. In that film Chaney's Talbot character is cured of his werewolfism and is the hero of the film. Ironically the last scene has Chaney fighting the frankenstein monster in a burning lab which uses stock footage from Ghost Of Frankenstein. Essentially Chaney plays Talbot fighting  Chaney playing the monster. By this point in the series ( House Of Dracula being the final film in the series  excluding A&C meet Frankenstein) and the budget was very low and lots of stock footage was used.",1369699200,,1765,4.720779220779221

220664,5,6300185443,"SPOILER ALERT: This review is written for fans familiar with the Universal Frankenstein series and contains spoilers.

I love the Universal ""two-fer"" DVDs...they don't take the place of the ""Legacy"" sets (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frankenstein-The-Legacy-Collection-Frankenstein-The-Bride-of-Son-of-The-Ghost-of-House-of/dp/B0001CNRLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frankenstein: The Legacy Collection (Frankenstein / The Bride of / Son of / The Ghost of / House of)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dracula-The-Legacy-Collection-Dracula-Dracula-1931-Spanish-Version-Dracula-s-Daughter-Son-of-Dracula-House-of-Dracula/dp/B0001CNRLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dracula - The Legacy Collection (Dracula / Dracula (1931 Spanish Version) / Dracula's Daughter / Son of Dracula / House of Dracula)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wolf-Man-The-Legacy-Collection-The-Wolf-Man-Werewolf-of-London-Frankenstein-Meets-the-Wolf-Man-She-Wolf-of-London/dp/B0001CNRNE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wolf Man - The Legacy Collection (The Wolf Man / Werewolf of London / Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man / She-Wolf of London)</a>, etc). But this pairing is perfect for any Saturday afternoon / evening ""Creature Feature"" craving you might have (and I have around 52 of them every year).

By the time of ""Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman,"" Universal had already unleashed its ""Big Three"" Frankenstein flicks (""Frankenstein,"" ""Bride of Frankenstein,"" ""Son Of Frankenstein,"" plus one more (and a personal favorite), ""Ghost of Frankenstein"").

""Ghost"" took a few chances...notably the infamous ""brain transplant"" of Bela Lugosi's ""Igor"" into the skull of the Lon Chaney ""Frankenstein's Monster."" Different blood types meant that the Bela-monster's body rejected the transplant and he ended up blind (classic moment: the monster lumbering about and breaking up the lab while yelling ""WHAT GOOD IS A BRAIN WITHOUT EYES TO SEE?"").

And the ONLY reason I mention all of this is that if you watch ""Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman"" cold, without knowing the continuity of the series, you wouldn't know that at the beginning of the film, the monster is supposed to be blind.

""Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman"" is one of the more atmospheric films of the series (REALLY making full use of the beloved ""angry villagers""), and the song that makes Larry Talbot flip out (""For life is short, but death is long, fa la la fa lo li"") still entertains, decades later. What you get is a plot that spirals to the ""battle of the Century,"" Frankenstein's monster versus the Wolfman, and it is SO BRIEF (maybe a minute, a minute and a half), but it is completely unhinged, spectacular, and the primary rule of show biz is supposed to be always leave them wanting more, right?

In terms of ""cinema"" and classic film making, the critics favor the first three films, but ""Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman"" might be the last GREAT film, and perhaps this is where the series should have ended.

""House of Frankenstein"" is the first of two films in which Universal tried to make up for a lack of inspiration by having an ""everything but the kitchen sink"" ethic with all of their monsters in one film (what no Mummy?)...you can tell they're stretching by including J Carrol Naish's ""Daniel"" as ""The Hunchback."" Glenn ""Gunsmoke"" Strange takes his first turn as the Frankenstein Monster, and he's pretty gosh-darn good in the role. But the movie is like two short stories slammed together...when John Carradine's ""Dracula"" is disposed of at the halfway point, the movie stops on a dime and lurches into its Frankenstein / Wolfman finale. Still a great flick, but more of a ""Midnight Movie"" than a ""classic horror film.""

The final entry in the series, ""House of Dracula"" (same formula as ""House of Frankenstein"") was a real mess...completely uninspired. So these two films really represent the end of the road for the Frankenstein / Wolfman / Dracula franchises. I love them because they are classic Universal, they have their moments, and the undeniable cheese factor adds a huge dollop of charm.

My primary recommendation is to go for all of the ""Legacy"" sets, but for a quick dose of fun, this double feature can't be beat.",1324166400,,4294,5.946515397082658

220721,4,6300185443,"Before there was Freddy Vs Jason there was Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man. I suppose it was only fitting this would happen sooner or later seeing as Universal was behind the Monster movies so why not take advantage of it? This was the first of the crossover movies and quite possibly the best although this movie is far from perfect and does have its fair share of flaws.

Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein are two of the greatest horror flicks ever made due to the brilliant performance by Boris Karloff and the direction by James Whale, but after Whale left the series Son of Frankenstein just didn't fully work, while I think the movie was overall good and Karloff was solid he wasn't used the way he was in the past two and he was wise to leave the series afterwards and that's where it all went downhill in my opinion; no James Whale or Karloff and the series just wasn't the same.

And that's where my problem lies with this movie if it's not Karloff it just isn't the Frankenstein Monster; no actor has come anywhere near the level of brilliance Karloff did. This time around Bela Lugosi steps into the role and Lugosi was always in Karloff's shadow and as much as I love Lugosi he was in Karloff's shadow for good reason. The interesting thing about Lugosi playing the Monster was he was the original choice to play the role in the original. One report has Lugosi turning it down seeing as an insult coming off Dracula, while other reports are it was James Whale that didn't want Lugosi; which ever one is true doesn't matter now since Lugosi would end up playing the role.

The first half of Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man was very well done, but around the middle of the movie it begins to run out of some steam. The script was written by Curt Siodmak who wrote The Wolf Man and overall his script was solid if not a bit flawed. Not as well written as The Wolf Man, but the script is good, but only really suffers from being a sequel. It doesn't really add anything new to the Frankenstein or Wolf Man series, but it still gets the job done. Curt Siodmak was an excellent writer and also wrote the classic I Walked with a Zombie, if you like Siodmak's work you'll probably enjoy this one. It's not easy taking these two Iconic characters in the Frankenstein Monster and The Wolf Man together, but Siodmak works it well.

Director Roy William Neil does well with the Wolf Man scenes, but there are some problems with the Monster. Like I said after Whale left the series the Monster was miss-used. A lot of people see the Monster as a walking idiot and those who say that obviously never saw the first 2 in the series, but after Whale left the Monster did sort of become that clich that he's seen as. If not for Karloff in Son of Frankenstein the Monster would be a walking idiot, which he became afterwards. The pacing is solid early on, but does drag in some spots in the 2nd half, but Roy William Neil is able to keep the movie above float and never lets things get too slow except for a scene or two. The first half is the better half when the story is only on Larry Talbot, and there are some fairly creepy scenes as well.

Lon Chaney Jr. is great once again in the sympathetic role of Larry Talbot who becomes the Wolf Man when the moon is full. Chaney Jr. despite having a great career and playing one of the most Iconic film monsters of all time was never really able to live up to his full potential and I suppose a lot of that has to do with who his father was, but I personally prefer Jr. over Sr. and once again Chaney Jr. delivers a brilliant performance.

As much as I love Bela Lugosi I didn't really like his take on the Monster. While not as horrible as some make him out to be he really wasn't all that great either. In fairness he isn't playing the same Monster made famous by Karloff. In Ghost of Frankenstein, Ygor played by Lugosi had his brain transplanted into the Monsters so you can I suppose make a case for why Lugosi was good, but none of that is brought up in this one and the Monster just stumbles around sort of like he's drunk. It's not easy to play this character due to how brilliant Karloff was, but while not horrible Lugosi just wasn't all that good either.

Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man is a fun if not flawed movie; seeing these two Iconic characters in the same movie is a real treat for the fans, but it would have been better off with Karloff, but what's done is done and for what it's worth it's a fun movie flaws and all. This was probably the best of the crossover movies well with the exception of Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, which trumps all the crossover movies.",1226966400,,4638,4.342560553633218
220722,5,6300185443,"I just wanted to drop in here and express my sincere enthusiasm for ""House of Frankenstein,"" which is one of the two films on this DVD.

Director Erle (not a typo!) C. Kenton went all out on this 1944 black-and-white film to present a Frankenstein movie which all horror fans could embrace, regardless of their preference for a particular monster. Here, we get Dracula (John Carradine), Lawrence Talbot/The Wolfman (Lon Chaney, Jr.), and Frankenstein himself (Glenn Strange)!

As if that were not enough, this cake is superbly iced with Boris Karloff (as the chief protagonist, Doctor Niemann), the lovely Anne Gwynn (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flash-Gordon-Conquers-the-Universe-The-Complete-Saturday-Morning-Serial/dp/B000NY1EDU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe - The Complete Saturday Morning Serial</a>), George Zucco (playing the snake oil sideshow man, Doctor Lampini), Lionel Atwill (cast as Arnz), and J. Carrol Naish (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dr-Renault-s-Secret/dp/B0013N0PTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dr. Renault's Secret</a>) as Daniel, Niemann's hunch-backed, Igor-like assistant! In addition to the monsters, we get a band of Gypsies, hateable monster-victims, and Doctor Lampini's (Zucco) cool sideshow of the Dracula remains.

THE STORY (Warning! Spoilers ahead!): Doctor Niemann and Daniel escape prison when a lightning bolt explodes the wall of their cells. Niemann has promised the hunch-backed Daniel that he'll give him a new body if only they can locate the original Baron Frankenstein's journal and scientific notes. With that endeavor in mind, they soon fall upon the lamentable Doctor Lampini and take over his sideshow as Niemann has a little vengeance in mind against those who had him imprisoned, prior to setting out in search of Baron Frankenstein's notes.

It's lucky that Lampini's wagon contained the remains of Dracula because Niemann removed the wooden stake which kept him dead in his casket and then utilized the vampire to kill one of Niemann's former antagonists. Unfortunately for Dracula, the authorities catch on fast and they pursue him until the sun rises... and you know what that means for Dracula! Niemann has also fled the town, just ahead of Dracula in a double-cross (pun intended), and at the next village Daniel rescues a Gypsy girl from her brutal shill. They're all run out of this village too but Niemann doesn't care a whit because the remnants of Baron Frankenstein's castle are quite nearby.

Once in the ruins of the old estate, Daniel inadvertently discovers both the Frankenstein Monster and The Wolfman in an ice cave (great effects!), deep under the castle. Niemann commences retrieval of the two and as the ice melts away from The Wolfman, he changes back into the unfortunate Lawrence Talbot who luckily knows just where to dig out Baron Frankenstein's journal. Niemann promises to replace Talbot's brain (with that of one of his local enemies) in return for his assistance in traveling to his own decrepit estate; meanwhile, Daniel has fallen for the Gypsy girl but the latter falls in love with Talbot, a m&eacute;nage-&agrave;-trois which leads to big complications.

Niemann is gratified in seeing a couple more of his former antagonists done in (thank you, Mr. Wolfman!) as he sets to work on re-animating the Frankenstein Monster in his home laboratory, much to the frustration of both Talbot and Daniel who each wanted THEIR problems dealt with first. I absolutely must stop there to avoid telling the end of the movie but rest assured that it's as good as the body of the film.

The filmscore/soundtrack for this one is terrific (and appropriate) and was generated by a number of competent folks: Hans J. Salter, musical director; Paul Dessau, composer; Charles Previn, composer; Max Rapp, composer; Milton Rosen, composer, and; Frank Skinner, composer. All except for Salter went uncredited. Special effects were brilliantly handled by John P. Fulton. The aspect ratio is 1.37:1 (full-frame) and the entire movie was filmed at Universal Studios in California.

As this is a Universal Films production there was a fairly good budget established for it, but ""Kharis the Mummy"" was ultimately excised from the script due to a lack of available funds. Bela Lugosi was also slated to have played Dracula but Universal's producers were displeased with his most recent performance for them as The Frankenstein Monster in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frankenstein-Meets-Wolfman/dp/6300185443/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frankenstein Meets Wolfman</a>. ""The House of Frankenstein"" isn't perfect as there are a few silly boners, the most prevalent of which is when Larry Talbot (Chaney) transforms into the Wolf Man for the final time, his hands aren't made up. The astute viewer can spot this just before he crashes through the glass door. Also, while not really a goof, no member of ""Baron Frankenstein's family"" (the Monster excepted!) ever appears in this film!

If I have a problem at all with this film it's only that I wish George Zucco's role as Doctor Lampini would have played out just a little longer before Daniel (Naish) strangled him to death. I'm Zucco's biggest fan on the planet (see my Amazon Listmania list: ""George Zucco... almost live!!!"") and I think that they could have carried him in the story for a bit longer. But we can't have everything.

In summary, this 71-minute treasure exudes mega-action and the filmscore/soundtrack has become quite renowned:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-Frankenstein/dp/B000U7V99E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of Frankenstein</a>, a rare actuality for an older horror movie.

220723,4,6300185443,"If you're looking for a good ""Monster Mash"" film, then you may find both of the films contained within to be a bit disappointing.  While the team-up aspect of both films is what they're best remembered for, they aren't really at the heart of these stories.

""FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLFMAN"" is absolutely a Wolfman film.  Continuing several years after the events of the first Wolfman installment, Larry Talbot is back and taking on some strong, emotionally rich character development.  Unfortunately, the Frankenstein aspect of the film is superbly disappointing.  First of all, the plot depends upon yet another offspring of Henry Frankenstein, who is alternately referred to as his daughter and granddaughter throughout the film.  In much the same way, previous Frankenstein continuity is alternatively adhered to and outright ignored throughout the film.  For example, the monster doesn't have Ygor's brain, but the previous Dr. Frankenstein's sanitarium was burnt down by the villagers (both incidents occurred in the previous Frankenstein installment, ""Ghost of Frankenstein,"" yet only one is acknowledged here).  The entire Frankenstein aspect of this film seems almost incidental, with the creature holding more importance as an object of curiosity than an actual character.  This is probably a good thing, though, since Bela Lugosi plays the worst Frankenstein monster I've ever seen.  Finally, the end of the film comes out of nowhere and leaves nothing resolved.  Considering all the more thorough ways in which both the Wolfman and the monster have been killed in previous films, I don't think an over-flowing river rushing through the castle is going to do much more than leave them needing a change of clothes.

""HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN,"" the second film in this collection, is a surprisingly excellent installment. Boris Karloff is brilliant as the mad scientist, J Carrol Naish plays a stunningly sympathetic hunchback, and the writing and directing are both truly memorable. However, like ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman,"" this is not the team-up film it claims to be. A terribly executed Dracula appears in the first 30 minutes of the film (which are entirely irrelevant to the rest of the story), and the Frankenstein monster is literally animated in the last ninety seconds of the film. Beyond that, this is clearly yet another Wolfman movie, continuing directly from ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman."" Like the previous film, it spends most of its running time and dramatic focus on Larry Talbot (The Wolfman) and does a tremendous amount to build upon and enrich his story in amazing ways, but it does not do the same for Dracula or the monster, both of whom seem tacked on without any artistic considerations, included merely for advertising purposes. It's saddening to consider how Karloff must have felt watching his legacy tarnish before his very eyes.

What distinguishes The Wolfman from any other Universal Monster is how thoroughly his character and conflict are developed across each of his sequels, unlike the other Universal monster franchises, which are often disjointed, uneven in quality, and seemingly produced with no inspiration beyond the desire to pump a few more dollars out of a character concept.  In these films, we can clearly see Larry Talbot transform beyond the frightened kid in ""The Wolfman"" to a desperate man on the verge of madness in ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman,"" and finally to a mature semi-hero, resigned to his own death in ""House of Frankenstein.""  These are great Wolfman films, but the presence of other monsters in these films is more intrusive and obligatory than worthwhile.

Nevertheless, Bela has a priceless moment when the Monster displays a wicked smile after regaining his full power. The long-awaited ""rumble in the castle"" is a horror-movie classic.

220725,3,6300185443,"I'm sure when this film hit theaters, kids couldn't wait to go see this! Although it doesn't deliver that much in the way of the two monsters meeting, it has one of the most memorable beginnings in any of the Universal horror films.

This film is actually the sequel to two films 'The Ghost Of Frankenstein' and 'The Wolfman' and the beginning of this film deals with the Wolfman. A very atmospheric graveyard scene with two grave robbers finding their way to the Talbot mausoleum. They break in and find the seemingly final resting place of Larry Talbot A.K.A. The Wolfman. This is a very chilling scene and it one of the finest moments in the entire franchise's history.

Exit Chaney as the monster as he wanted to keep the Wolfman as ""his baby"" so, the studio brings in poor old Bela Lugosi to play the monster who has become a walking zombie at this point. Lugosi was not all that young anymore so, they had to have a stunt man play the monster in some scenes adding to the confusion. In the last installment Igor's brain was put in the monster's skull and the monster talked with Igor's voice. This was carried over to this film, but the end result was too ridiculous(even for Universal's standards!),so the dialogue was cut leaving the film an incoherent mess and Lugosi wondering around like a dolt! It's a mixed bag to say the least and this could be next to the worst film in the 'Frankenstein' series.

Even with all these flaws and problems, I do enjoy watching this film from time to time. This is available on DVD on the Frankenstein Legacy collection and in a double bill with 'House of Frankenstein' The DVD transfer is very good for both films.

I wish somehow they could find that cut footage with Lugosi talking, it would be most interesting to see the film the way it was intended originally. ;-( I rate this film 3 1/4 stars.",1203638400,,1845,4.498507462686567

HOF on the other hand shows that Universal had run out of steam by this point (1944). Karloff is merely adequate in a role he sleepwalks through. Surely Lugosi, an actor who gave his all, however ludicrous the script, would have been better in this part. Lon Chaney steals the movie in his Wolf Man role and John Carradine isn't a bad Dracula. It was downhill from here though with House of Dracula following in 1945/6.
However Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein in 1948 was a far more entertaining and exciting finale to Universal Horror than the two House movies. And Bela was back as Dracula - what more could you ask for?",1192924800,,809,4.510204081632653

The first film on this set is the 5th in the series or 6th if you count ""The Wolfman"". Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman"" This film was doomed from the start as the last film left the monster with Igor's brain and blind. Before the release of the film it was cut drastically and all of Lugosi's dialogue was removed from the film because it was thought to look ridiculous. This resulted in a confusing performance that had Lugosi looking like a sleepwalking moron. To add to the confusion they had a stunt double for Lugosi in the scenes the monster was doing anything physical. The film continues to contradict itself as some scenes the monster appears blind and some scenes he appears to have vision! This is never explained in the movie. I would love to see an uncut version of this film. It's a fun film non the less. The second film on this set is ""House Of Frankenstein which picks up where ""Frankenstein meets The Wolman"" left off. Karloff is back in fine form, but this time he plays a mad doctor out for revenge. Glen Strange has his first outing as the monster and proves to be the best replacement in the fading series. Karloff gave Strange instructions on how to play the monster in this film and it shows. This is an all out monster rally featuring Frankenstein's monster, The Wolfman, Dracula, a hunchback and a mad doctor! It's an entertaining enrty that is fun and fast paced.

Although the decline in quality is painfully apparent when you compare them to the first two Frankenstein films, they are still a lot of fun for anyone who loves spooky castles and torch-wielding mobs of villagers.  Lon Chaney, Jr. makes for a sympathetic lycanthrope in both these films, although the Wolfman has always seemed to be a bit of a wimp to me as far as monsters go.  Frankenstein's monster has been reduced to the shambling silent stereotype we know him as today.  Sadly, the complexity of Boris Karloff's portrayal has been lost.  In ""House of Frankenstein,"" John Carradine puts in a terrible performance as Dracula in a subplot that should have been stricken from the script.

220761,3,6300185443,"This text refers to the version found on the Wolfman Legacy Colection. With the exception of what looks to be damage to the print itself during the opening credits the transfer to DVD is stellar.

The first half of this picture stands up well alongside any of the best of the horror films Universal Studios ever made. The story (by Curt Siodmak) is an exciting one that seldom dragged. The direction by Roy William Neil is well paced and made good use of Siodmak's terse scripting. The characters introduced were uniformly strong and the actors who portrayed them did more than just walk through the lines. Patric Knowles was solid as the surgeon/scientist who tries to help the cursed Talbot. Maria Ouspenskaya reprised her role as the gypsy woman who working to protect the cursed Lawrence Talbot and Lon Chaney came up with (what was probably) his best performance as that character. The emotional depth he brought to the role of an average man afflicted with something that's neither his fault or within his ability to control is compelling to this day.

The problems with this film begin when the character of the Monster was introduced. Bela Lugosi's performance as the creature is terrible but it apparently wasn't his fault. The monster had finished the last film blinded and running around speaking with Ygor's voice. After production began someone in some branch of some executive think tank decided to make a few changes. Of course, all this happened after Lugosi had been filmed stumbling around like a wooden dummy. Continuity went in the tank and Lugosi ended up groping around the sets as a stick-figure monster. Given what ended up on the screen (to say nothing of the lousy reviews Lugosi had to have known he'd be getting) one can only sympathize with him. It was, literally, the stiffest portrayal of the monster ever filmed. (It might even be the stiffest portrayal of anything ever filmed, anywhere). It's beyond ridiculous and that's being generous. But it wasn't Bela's fault.

Still, this film still never deteriorated to the point of being really bad. Even the characters introduced after the monster-with-all-his-body-parts-in-splints shows up are developed reasonably well. Ilona Massey brought a level of intelligence to the role of the Baroness Frankenstein that kept the part from being just filler that placed an attractive feminine presence on the screen. Lionel Atwill (one of Universal Studios' great utility players) turned in his usual strong work as the mayor of the town plagued by monster's shadow. His part was a clich, but, as he generally did, he managed to inject it with a measure of depth. The bond that forms between Talbot and the creature (two beings made outcasts through circumstances beyond their control) is an emotionally provocative one. The (inevitable) decision by the curiousity driven Mannering (Knowles) is convincing as is the horror displayed by the Baroness Frankenstein (Massey) when she realizes his true intent.

The picture is plagued by the usual clichs that dogged films of that era. Some of the situations are too obviously contrived. The villagers (from the typical Hollywood village in Central Europe) are so backward they belong in the twelfth century. The confrontation between the monsters is disappointing (Lugosi is just too stiff) and the models of buildings used for panoramic shots are obviously models (the ""bricks"" used are ridiculously large for full sized structures). When the ""castle"" is ""destroyed"" it looks like a model being washed away by tap water. The problems don't overshadow the pluses though. The cinematography is excellent and the use of lighting and shadows (particularly through the first twenty minutes of the film) is nothing short of spectacular. Most of the sets are very good as well. The only exceptions are the few cases where models were used. The script has many strong points and the actors involved in the project all gave it their full effort.

The result was a film that retained its capacity to be enjoyed even after some of the elements went downhill.",1113091200,5,4065,5.034175334323923

House of Frankenstein is pacier and more entertaining all round, starring Karloff as a mad scientist bringing the Frankenstein Monster back to life, with the Wolf Man and an appearance from Dracula thrown in for good measure.",1108684800,2,484,4.761904761904762

220764,4,6300185443,"With the success of The Wolf Man in 1941, it didn't take Universal long to trot out a sequel; the following year, Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man not only capitalized on the success of everybody's favorite werewolf, it also brought in Frankenstein's monster, thus becoming one of the first Universal monster cross-over films.  Lon Chaney, Jr., returns as the ill-fated Larry Talbot, and the legendary Bela Lugosi dons the makeup of the Frankenstein monster - this fact alone makes the film intriguing.
Four years have passed since Larry Talbot's death.  He's been lying in his crypt covered in wolf bane, not bothering anyone, and then two grave robbers happen along.  The light of the full moon calls Talbot back to life, and he flees into the night in his werewolf form, waking up in a hospital in Cardiff the next morning.  A Dr. Mannering (Patric Knowles) has performed surgery on his broken skull, but no one believes his werewolf story, even after he claims his first victim in four years.  He ends up bolting the place and making his way to Europe, where he seeks out the old gypsy woman Maleva.  She tells him that one man can be of help, a scientist named Frankenstein, but it turns out that the doctor is dead and his castle in ruins.  Talbot engineers a means of drawing Baroness Elsa Frankenstein to the village (yet another heretofore unknown heir to the House of Frankenstein), but she refuses to help him.  Searching the ruins, Talbot finds Frankenstein's monster frozen in ice and sets him free.  Dr. Mannering eventually tracks him down to the village, and he agrees to help both the Wolf Man and the monster, but you know how these scientists get when they start delving into the mysteries of life and death.
Talbot, now afraid he cannot die, longs to be killed and put out of his misery.  Baroness Frankenstein is just as desirous of seeing the monster destroyed.  Now, if it were me, I would get an axe and just chop these guys into about a million pieces, but I guess that would be too easy.  And, with the film being titled Wolf Man Meets Frankenstein, you know there has to be a monster clash before all is said and done, and you don't want your monsters battling it out at less than full strength.  The film ends rather abruptly, leaving a slight taste of dissatisfaction in my mouth.
Watching Bela Lugosi play Frankenstein's monster is a pretty weird experience.  Lugosi was the ultimate horror actor, but I don't think he was born to play the monster.  I found it impossible to even recognize him under all the makeup until, toward the end, a fully recharged monster saw fit to give the audience a couple of vintage Lugosi grins.  The film features a number of Universal stalwarts, including Lionel Atwill, Patric Knowles, Maria Ouspenskaya, and Dwight Frye.  All in all, I was pretty impressed by this movie.  Curtis Siodmak returned to write the script, and it did make for a successful sequel to The Wolf Man.
House of Frankenstein is a sequel to Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, one with its good points and its bad points.  This was the first film to feature three of the Universal classic monsters: Frankenstein's Monster (now played by Glenn Strange), the Wolf Man (Lon Chaney, Jr.), and Count Dracula (John Carradine).  It also threw the legendary Boris Karloff into the mix as a mad scientist following in Dr. Frankenstein's footsteps.  John Carradine is probably the worst Dracula I've ever seen; he brings no sense of power or charisma to the role at all.  Dracula doesn't even have a very significant part in the movie, strangely enough.
Boris Karloff is Dr. Gustav Niemann, one of the few mad scientists of note to actually be imprisoned.  After fifteen years of prison life, he is still concentrating on his research; he even has a hunchbacked assistant ready to go as soon as he gets his freedom.  A powerful electrical storm issues Niemann a pardon, and he heads for Frankenstein's castle in hopes of finding his hero's research notes.  A carnival of horrors provides him the cover he needs to make his getaway, and it just so happens that this carnival's main attraction is the actual skeleton of Count Dracula.  The Count returns to life (at least as much life as Carradine manages to give the character), but the film would probably be better served had it left Dracula out of the script entirely.  Once Niemann reaches the village of Frankenstein, he begins searching the ruins of the castle and finds both The Wolf Man and Frankenstein's Monster frozen in ice.  I don't even have to tell you that he revives both of the monsters.  Lon Chaney, Jr., is once again superb in his role of the tormented Wolf Man seeking death but, for a time, pinning his hopes on Dr. Niemann for a cure to his cursed affliction.  Frankenstein's monster basically just stumbles and bumbles his way through the script, having already fallen victim to the awful stereotype of the big, dumb monster.  When Karloff looked into the eyes of the monster, I am sure he saw almost no similarity to the monster he portrayed so powerfully in the first three Frankenstein films.
House of Frankenstein fails to live up to its potential.  Its strengths include Karloff's fine performance as a non-monster character, Chaney's impressive performance as the Wolf Man, and the combination of three classic monsters in one movie.  Its weaknesses come in the form of Carradine's awful performance as Dracula, the silliness of the whole Dracula subplot to begin with, and a fairly boring conclusion regarding Dr. Niemann and the monster.  It's still a fun movie to watch, but it cannot compare to the classic movies that gave birth to the monsters we see exploited here for box office profits.",1085788800,5,5697,4.750253807106599

The legendary actor who was famous for playing Dracula in Universal's classic 1931 film, did a great job as the monster in this film. Although Son of Frankenstein (1939) was a big let down after Frankenstein (1931) and The Bride of Frankenstein (1935), this film returns a little pride in the Frankenstein monster. Even though the title is Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, don't let it fool you. This film is more of a sequal to The Wolf Man featuring Frankenstein, but that doesn't really matter, because the story is very good.
Lon Chaney Jr. plays Larry Talbot (the wolf man) and he wants to rid himself of the werewolf curse. He seeks the gypsy woman from The Wolf Man (1941), who tells him there is nothing she can do to cure him. Talbot figures the only cure he can hope for is Dr. Frankenstein, who knew the secrect of life and death. As a result of Henry and Wolf Frankenstein now being dead, Talbot seeks the diary of Henry to figure out a way to kill himself and give his soul eternal piece. He runs into Frankenstein's monster (Lugosi) and Elsa Frankenstein. He turns into the werewolf and has a pretty good battle with Frankenstein.
This movie was scary at times. You can really feel sorry for Larry in this film. The performences by Lugosi, Chaney Jr., and the rest of the cast were great. The music was great too. The story was interesting and kept you guessing as to what will wind up happening to Larry. All in all, this is a fun monster movie.

Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman in particular was always a childhood creature feature favorite.  The film finds Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr) accidentally brought back to life (recall the Wolfman was killed in the end of the original film) by a couple of would be grave robbers.  None to happy to be alive he begins a journey that would span a few more films to find a cure for his lycanthropy.

Obsessed with the secrets of life and death, his journey takes him to the ruins of the Frankenstein castle.  Here he will find the bodies of the Frankenstein monster and the wolfman, frozen by the dam waters released by the villagers in FMTW.  Lon Chaney Jr reprises his role as the tortured Larry Talbot.  Glenn Strange plays the Frankenstein monster.  I always thought Frank looked a little goofy in this film.  John Carradine rounds out the monster cast as Dracula.

220796,5,6300185443,"I will admit at first when I heard that Bela Lugosi was going to fill the shoes of Frankenstein creature who was originally played brilliantly by Boris Karloff I was sure I wouldn't like it. But Bela Lugosi's performance as the Frankenstein creation definitely surprised me, he made the character come to life and was very believable. As for Lon Chaney he was made for the part of the wolfman, I couldn't see anyone else being this role. The eerie and haunting music was a great addition to the movie, the sets were beautiful, the makeup and costumes for the wolfman and the frankenstein monster were absolutely amazing. What more could you ask for. This movie showcased two widely talented actors who were in their prime and it is a shame they are no longer with us. This is what great horror films are all about.",1034121600,3,814,4.582191780821918
220797,3,6300185443,"First both these films are campy fun. I grew up watching both of these films pretty regularly on Creature Features. It was a natural transition for Bela Lugosi to play the monster in FMWM due to the ending of Ghost of Frankenstein. It's not a terrible film just not all that well written which is a surprise given that the scribe was Curt Sidomak (Donovan's Brain and a number of minor science fiction classics). Earle Kenton's direction is stylish given the budget limitations. The problem in the film is more with the self pitying Larry Talbot. As written Lon Chaney, Jnr. is given little more to do than wallow in self pity. Sure, he's a wolf man at night and usually has to change clothes after every full moon (they rip apart as he changes) but come on!

Anyhow, Lugosi plays the Monster as a lumbering idiot (if the dialog hadn't been trimed his portrayal might have been a bit better). It's ironic that Lugosi ended up playing the role as his star was fading since he turned it down originally. It made Boris Karloff a star. The rest of the cast ranges from weak to competant. This isn't the best in the series but it has a number of entertaining moments. Reportedly, Gil Perkins actually played the Monster in many of the long shots as Lugosi wasn't up to the task.

House of Frankenstein promised much more than it delivered but still has a number of bright spots. First, there's Karloff. Although he doesn't play the Monster (he's an escaped criminal/scientist), he's given plenty of scenery to chew. His performance is one of the best in the picture. Lon Chaney, Jnr. returns and for good measure Dracula shows up as well. There is  a law of dimishing returns when it comes to monsters or villians (we'll call it wtdk's Monster/villian law-- for an example look at the last two Batman films).

I have to agree that John Carradine doesn't do the part of Dracula justice. He just isn't convincing (nor was Lon Chaney, Jnr. when he played the role in Son of Dracula. His delivery was always stiff and deliberate but was exceedingly bad in that film). Carradine would reprise the role in House of Dracula the following year.

It's no surprise that the DVD doesn't have a lot of extras. While both films are solid and entertaining on their own, they're far from classics in the series. Due to the age of the film, it's unlikely that a lot survived in the way of outtakes or alternative endings (both films were shot on volatile nitrate stock). If you're looking for classics stick with Whale's Bride and Lee's Son of Frankenstein. If you're looking for a fun, inoffensive time by all means pick these up.",1033171200,10,2610,4.592274678111588
220798,4,6300185443,"I finally got a copy of ""Frankenstein meets the Wolfman/""House of Frankenstein"" on DVD, (Frankenstein may have stepped on the box for good measure, but I digress) the image quality was better than expected after reading some of the other reviews and the sound was strong. A close comparison to the 1987 Laserdisc release of ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man"" shows an improved overall picture quality. While there may be an additional scratch here or there, considering that another 14 years had passed, between 1987 and 2001 when this DVD was released and that the film is now nearly 60 years old I thought it was very well preserved. I also compared ""House of Frankenstein"" on this DVD to the 1994 Laserdisc release and found the two prints actually very close in quality and the image again improved by the DVD format. I am amazed that people are gripping about extras for the prices these are going for considering that the laserdisc for ""Frankenstein meets the Wolfman"" alone was more and as ""House of Frankenstein"" was released on a two movie-two laserdisc set for considerably more I think the DVD is a bargain.  Also, I found the DVD menu was easy to use and I had no problem pulling up the top menu and going back and forth between the two features after one had finished. Yes, some music on the menu screens would be nice and a running commentary is always a wonderful addition, but considering this DVD package does not cost anymore than the two movies do on VHS, it's a fair price.

220800,3,6300185443,"CHEERS to Universal for their inspired decision to release a wave of their classic horror movies as double feature DVD's.  The pairings make sense, reflecting the chronology of each series, and the double feature format harkens back to the old days of Saturday afternoons at the movies.  However...
JEERS also go out to Universal for lack of extras, lazy mistakes and questionable source material.
Structurally, FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLF MAN has always been a mess.  The plot contrivances, which bring the Wolf Man and Frankenstein's monster together, are a stretch, even by Universal's standards.  The film also suffers from the woeful mis-casting of Bela Lugosi as the Frankenstein monster.  Not only does Lugosi usher in the era of the monster as a lumbering, semi-blind oaf; the post-production decision by Universal to eliminate the monster's lines and reduce his scenes leaves the picture even more disjointed.  (Yes, the monster, as filmed, spoke!  Continuing the story line from the previous entry, ""Ghost of Frankenstein,"" the monster's voice was that of Lugosi.  The result in ""Meets"" was deemed unsatisfactory to Universal, so their solution was to simply eliminate Lugosi's audio track and cut scenes where they couldn't get away with an audio-only fix.  Look closely and you'll still see scenes where the monster's mouth is moving, yet not a word is heard!) ""Meets"" also marks the point where the Frankenstein saga was overshadowed by that of Larry Talbot, the Wolf Man.  From here on through the sequels, the monster is relegated to a supporting and, eventually, cameo role.
As for the quality of FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLF MAN on DVD, Universal clearly expended little energy in finding the best print.  The picture is intermittently dirty and scratchy.  The ""bonus material"" is slim.  We get the trailer, 7 short pages of anecdotes on the making of the film, and bios/filmographies on the principal actors.  Particularly telling is that Lugosi's bio features a picture of his stunt double in the Frankenstein make-up, NOT Lugosi.
HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN is the only instance in the original Universal Frankenstein series where the sequel is superior to the previous chapter.  Boris Karloff makes a welcome return, this time as murderous mad scientist Dr. Niemann.  Again, we're presented with a convoluted plot in order to gather Universal's resident monsters in one time and place.  But, thanks mainly to Karloff and his hunchbacked assistant portrayed by J. Carrol Naish, we're treated to a depth of acting missing in the previous film.  (On the minus side, John Carradine is laughable as Dracula, looking like a low-rent refugee from an escort service.)
The print used here for ""House"" is better than that of ""Meets.""  As for bonus material, it is identical to its disc-mate:  trailer, 7 pages anecdotes, bios.
While applause do go to Universal for their double feature program, this arrangement does leave the final installment in the original Frankenstein series without a partner, and thus, un-released on DVD.  As Universal considers the fate of ""House of Dracula,"" I'd like to nominate another Lon Chaney Jr./Lionel Atwill vehicle of the same period as the second half of a double-bill, namely ""Man Made Monster.""

I have been waiting for this movie to came out on Dvd, and it finally will arrive in August! Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman is one of the best horror movies from the classic Universal Monster series. It is the sequel to The Wolfman, and in my opinion is far better than the original. Once again it stars Lon Chaney, Jr. as the Wolfman, the only actor in the Universal series of horror movies to have originated and played the same monster in all his apperances.
The movie starts out four years after the original Wolfman. Lawrence Talbot is brought back to life, and is not to happy about that. (he would rather have stayed dead!). He seeks out the gypsy woman from the first movie to help him with the curse. She can't help him, but takes him on a journey to find the one man who can...Dr. Frankenstein!
This is the one sequel that does it right. It has all the ingredients- atmosphere, great story that keeps you entertained and never lets up, and characters that make the movie work. Lon Chaney has never portrayed the Wolfman better. In other movies where he played the monster  he was always wandering around feeling sorry for himself and constantly saying how much he wanted to die. In this movie he is energetic and goes on a journey to cure himself and finds hope to get rid of the mark of the werewolf- therby making us care for his character and rooting for him along the way. The supporting cast of characters are great, with Bela Lugosi playing the Frankenstein monster for this one time and Maria Ouspenskaya returning as the gypsy woman Meliva.
The movie is  directed by Roy Willaim Neil, who directed many of the terrific Sherlock Holmes pictures starring Basil Rathbone. Also in the cast is  Dennis Hoey, who played Inspector Lestrade from the Holmes movies. The atmosphere, suspense, and great acting make this one of my favorite Universal Movies.
Hopefully, Universal will give this DVD the deluxe treatment, with commentary and behind the scenes, as it did with its previous dvd releases of the classic monsters.
For all the monster fans, get ready for August when Universal releases its next batch of horror classics including Werewolf of London, the Dracula and Mummy sequels, and my other favorite: Abbott and Costello meet the Mummy!!  I read elsewhere that Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman  DVD will be a double feature with House of Frankenstein, which will make this a great deal for 2 great Universal pictures on one DVD! Do not pass this one up. Keep up the great work Universal!!",992304000,26,2649,4.64957264957265
220859,4,6300185443,"The sequel to ""The Wolf man(1941)"", ""Frankenstein Meets the WolfMan"" remains one of the most influncial Horror/werewolf films of it's decade, if not to the genre as well. Believe it or not, what you have here, well suceeds past the norm of ""B"" programmers, the film is possibly one of Universal's last Horror outings with artistict merits that could gain it's status even amoung the most popular of Universal Horrors. The film is expecitonal crafted by Director Roy William Neil, who brings his customary flair for atmosphereics, and break-neck pacing, contrasted with John B.Goodman's beautifully lit exressionistict-like sets, perfectly conveyed by camera man George Robinson's dazzaling film-noirish camerwork, (wich is possibly his best work in a long and varied career) The screenplay , derived from the Legendary Curt Siodmak, is in it's first half a remarkable,little werewolf jingle, for like it's predeccor ""The Wolf Man (1941)"",  exploiting the Werewolf myth, and it's many interconnections which would set the standard for werewolf movies to come. Lest face it, if this film had never surfaced, the public would never see the like's of such film's as John Landis's 1981 excursion into lycanthropy, ""An American Werewolf In London"", which is an undeniable homage to this film, showcasing many of the key elements, and plot threads. The film in it's own right, paints a perfect picture of the ancestry, and citizen-ship of many of the pesant hokum villages of central Europe, it's tranquilty and many downdrafts of the local underbelly of society. Lon Chaney gives, (though considered by a marginal par, a very winey, irritating performance), through my humble opinion one of his very best perfomances. He beautifully builds up on his careless-now grief striken Lary Talbolt, who lives in a world longing for internal slumber. And as always presented on the backdrop of the ignorant non-believers (scientific anaylisis, and the ignorant common belief of it's officals) While the first half consists of Lary's misfortune to the return of the living, the second half deals with his long-length desires to find a cure, calling upon the ""meaningful-mistreated benifactor""---Dr. Ludwig Frankenstein, (the second son of Henry(Victor) Frankenstein (who merely serves as the film's caytilist), the main purpose for the film to precede, of course)  Though instead of finding Frankenstein himself, he finds his monster (or his father's monster, if you want to put it in correct terms, unlike the film ,which doesn't) The monster this time around is played by Bela Lugosi, and is sadly quit inadaquet, coming off rather silly at times, which aside from the films minor flaws hampers the film serverly. In fact the whole second act of the film, which functions as a sequel to the wonderful, often-underrated ""The Ghost of Frankenstein(1942)"" is a rather passable Frankenstein unit, nothing more, nothing less. And also most of the village sequences, that most notably of  "" the Festival of New Wine"" , though beautifully staged(if not even more memorable than most of the musical pieces from the 1943 Phantom of the Opera) lacks the naturally conveyed atmosphere of the first half. The coupled with the often overly-lit sets, tends to rob the film of it's realism from the first half. And by this time the Director has lost almost all intrest in the film, though it's fair to say that it remains competent to it's rather-unstylisitc finale--when the frightened villagers, (r hypocrtical, bloody thristy villagers, which ever way you like to term them) blow up a damn, wiping out the remains of of Ludwigs Frankenstein's sanituriam (though here it seems to take shap of a medival castle. Strange.) forcing both the Wolf Man and the monster to drown, while being swept up along with the ruble. With a such a rushed ending, one wonders if Universal ran out of money by this point in time, and this theory doesn't lend it self as a fictional statement, becasue one tends to wonder)

220861,4,6300185443,"Good Grade B spook spectacular that combines two classic horror characters  of Universal Studio.  A resurrected Wolfman, Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney,  Jr.), seeks release from his cursed life.  Maleva, the old gypsy woman,  suggests he consult the infamous Dr. Frankenstein.  In Vasaria, Talbot  discovers the Frankenstein monster within the ruins of the defunct  mad-doctor's gloomy castle.  The complicated plot involves Frankenstein's  human granddaughter (Ilona Massey), a psychiatrist named Dr. Mannering  (Patrick Knowles), and the usual irate villagers.  Mannering evolves into a  low-key version of the mad-doctor.  After poring over Frankenstein's  records describing ""the secrets of life and death,"" Mannering  decides to drain the energy forces from both Talbot and the monster.  The  two title characters find themselves strapped to tables in the laboratory  on a night of metamorphosis and terror.  Dr. Mannering has the urge to  crank the monster up to its full strength before undoing Frankenstein's  creation.  When the full moon shines in the lab window, all hell breaks  loose in explosive fashion as the super-charged monster and the Wolfman  tear into each other.
Although Bela Lugosi had previously declined the  role, he plays Frankenstein's monster.  By this stage of his career, Lugosi  suffered from advancing age and other physical ailments that no doubt  contributed to his uninspired performance.  The monster is relegated to a  secondary role, and spends his time hanging around the ruins.  Instead of  terrorizing the countryside, he watches Talbot pace and fume.  The movie  works better as a ""Wolfman"" story.  The opening segment of the  two grave robbers that desecrate the Talbot crypt is one of the scariest  scenes in all of Universal's horror flicks.  Chaney's  ""man-into-werewolf"" transformation is the stuff of troubled  dreams, enhanced by Jack Pierce's classic makeup.  After the action shifts  to Vasaria, a young woman is brutally murdered, and the bewildered  villagers question what animal kills that savagely? On cue, something howls  in distance.  Classic horror fans will recognize Dwight Frye as one of the  respectable villagers.  This is an inside joke because the character actor  previously appeared as the hunchbacked dwarf in the original  ""Frankenstein,"" and played an insane procurer of  ""fresh"" dead bodies in ""Bride of Frankenstein.""  Maria  Ouspenskaya returns as the enigmatic Maleva.  Her mysterious presence  effectively connects with Talbot's lost soul.

Soon,  Lugosi's spitting, snarling monster is found. As is widely known, several  pre-film cuts got rid of many of Lugosi's scenes, many of them speaking  scenes, which made a nonsense of his blind, groping performance, and robbed  the film of a flowing narrative. Stuntman Eddie Parker doubled as the  monster throughout much of the story, especially the wonderful climactic  fight scene at the end in the doomed laboratory. Great fun.
