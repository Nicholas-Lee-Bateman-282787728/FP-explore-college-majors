7882855,4,6305101981,"It is a short DVD, but it is fun to play through to see a different combinations of scenes.  Perfect for starting get togethers with your friends of family, even if they only want to check it out for a short time.  More fun than the VHS Clue games we have played over the years.",1357862400,,278,4.036363636363636
7882856,2,6305101981,"I would like to say (not good)........... but since this is a 1996 production and the first of its kind........it can be said as okay although if more thought have been put into characters build up and story expansion then it should be better.
Its too short and not that funny........ buy if you are a collector of something which is new in the genre......this is the first but if you are not interested in collecting then go for Tender Loving Care or Point of View.",1006646400,3,466,4.430232558139535
7882857,4,6305101981,"Well, I was there when it was made, and as stupid as it looks, we spent A LOT of time thinking about it. To be totally honest, a bunch of us who were there are still thinking about it. there is little question that we were  ahead of the curve....but as we all continue to take part in our media  experience...Some of you might want to try entertain the rest of us...I  hope so...Watch and, find the flaws.",937526400,,405,4.166666666666667
