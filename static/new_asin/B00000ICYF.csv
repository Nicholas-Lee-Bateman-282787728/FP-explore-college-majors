1221368,4,B00000ICYF,"Yet another movie classic not released on DVD.

Come to the Stable, The Uninivited, Farmer's Daughter, I Married a Witch, Remember the Night, The Mad Miss Manton, African Queen - the list goes on and on of good movies not out on DVD.

I ask the various studios to pick up the pace of restoring and releasing movies not yet out on DVD.  It is especially urgent now that a new medium is on the horizon.

I won't give a description as others have done so, but if you have never seen ""Farmer's Daughter"" it's a great movie and well acted all around and worth viewing.",1170979200,4,563,4.283018867924528
1221369,5,B00000ICYF,"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I've watched and loved this movie for years.  The is one of Loretta Young's best, along with ""Rachel and the Stranger"" which is also wonderful.  Being an old movie addict, it just boggles my mind WHY distributors will put out a movie on VHS and then not on DVD???  There are so many unbelieveably wonderful old movies that deserve to be put on DVD and this is one of them!",1145923200,53,408,4.342105263157895
1221370,5,B00000ICYF,"I love this movie!  It starts off with Katie Holstrom (Loretta Young) as a swedish girl going to the big city to be a nurse.  Although the first problem comes when she rides with a con man instead of taking the bus.  He steals her money and threatens her by telling her that he could tell her parents and stuff that there was only one bed in the inn (a total lie!).  Therefore Katie has to keep quiet about him and get a job as a maid of a congressman's family.  A beautiful romance nicely told.  I love the scene where Katie gives cotten a swedish massage!  A great buy.  Though at the end of the movie the con man does use this lie against her when she's running for congress.  In shame and embarrassment she goes back to her farm and family, but, only to be found by Cotten, with a proposal.  Excellent!",1126224000,,806,4.175324675324675
1221371,5,B00000ICYF,"I tripped over this movie one day on TCM and absolutely fell in love with it! Loretta Young plays Katie, a Swedish maid that is very interested in politics. As fate would have it, she is working in the house of a powerful family in politics, but she doesn't always agree with their positions or the candidates they nominate. What she does enjoy, though, is the company of Joseph Cotten, who plays son Glenn Morley. I love their sweet romance, especially when Katie is running around the lake and Glenn can't keep up.

Just as the two protagonists really start to connect, Glenn's mother (the wonderful Ethel Barrymore) calls a meeting of her political party to nominate a candidate, one that Katie really opposes. So she decided to run for Congress herself.

This movie is so wonderful, really filled with romance, comedy, and the spirit of democracy. Not to mention Katie's handsome brothers!",1111622400,26,893,4.830065359477124
1221372,5,B00000ICYF,One of the best movies I have seen.  In my opinion Loretta Youngs's and Joseph Cotton's best movie! Ethel Barrymore is great too! The farmer's daughter is about a young woman who goes off to the city to find a job to put herself through school to be a nurse. She gets a job as a maid and ends up falling in love with her bosses son who happens to be a congressman. Low and behold Kaitie runs for congress herself. Watch to see the ending.  A must see!,1105228800,4,451,4.056179775280899
1221373,5,B00000ICYF,"Loretta Young and Jospeh Cotton make a great couple in this film.  It has everything comedy, romance, and great scenery.  Ethel Barrymore, is equally delightful in it.  It's a film, well worth seeing.",1044835200,8,200,5.0
1221374,4,B00000ICYF,"Belabored, yet charming story of Loretta Young as a small-town girl who makes it big -- real big -- in Capitol City, by sticking to her simple honest values, and by nabbing Joseph Cotten, a state congressman who holds a torch for her.  Very wholesome and very Fifties-ish, with some nice humorous touches (and a weird intimation of a postwar American fascist Fifth Column...)  Charles Bickford is great as Cotton's sidekick/butler, who acts as the conscience of the household, and zips off a few choice zingers...",1032652800,7,513,4.953488372093023

1221400,5,B00000ICYF,"Odds are, Loretta Young's best role was in THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER. It's certainly my favorite of all her movies, and it won her a Best Actress Academy Award for 1947. And to think she had qualms about taking on this part, not because she had to dye her hair blonde but I think because of the Swedish accent she would have to assume. Did you know she lobbied for a southern accent instead, and was turned down? THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER is based on a Finnish play titled HULDA, DAUGHTER OF PARLIAMENT, and I guess it was too much of a chore to shift from ""ya"" to ""y'all."" But it was a canny choice, sticking to the guns. A southern accent and everything that goes with it would have altered the story's dynamics significantly.

Loretta Young plays Katrin Holstrom, the relentlessly resourceful farm girl of Swedish-American stock come to Washington, D.C. to attend nursing school. But mishap in the shape of a weasely, boozy barn painter leaves her with her savings frittered away, and she ends up working as a house maid in a young congressman's ritzy household in D.C.

It doesn't take long for that young congressman, Glenn Morley (Joseph Cotton), and his savvy, lived-in mother (a fantastic Ethel Barrymore) to learn that their new maid knows her politics, in fact, knows plenty about plenty. And, unlike the irascible family butler (Charles Bickford, also fantastic), Katrin Holstrom brews a fine pot of coffee and gives a mean Swedish massage. This being more of a romantic comedy fable than an incisive political expos, what are the odds that the young congressman and the maid mutually fall head over heels? (The odds are good.)

The story conflict surfaces when the congressman's party decides to back an unsavory character to join the ranks. Katrin, never shy about voicing her opinions, disapproves of the party's choice. One thing leads to another, and before you can say ""A mug of hot glug!"" Katrin Holstrom finds herself running for Congress on the opposition's ticket. Talk about your household divided, ya.

The politics that Katrin slings about is pretty naive, corny stuff. Essentially, she runs on the platform of decency and fair play and how the representative's actions should be dictated by those he represents. Still, I found it easy enough to be swayed by the sentimentality of it all because the performances are so good, the story unfolds so delightfully, even if you could see the plot points a mile away. The cast is pitch perfect, from the two leads to Ethel Barrymore, the canny matriarch, and the craggy-faced Charles Bickford who himself was nominated as Best Supporting Actor for his butler role. And if you're a trivia-head, two of Katrin's three strapping big brothers are played by a pre-GUNSMOKE James Arness and a pre-Tarzan Lex Barker. THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER, in my opinion, qualifies as unmissable cinema. There's a Frank Capra-esque whiff to this film, and the writers capitalize on it by staging a dizzy third act colored with a vicious smear campaign, a bit of trickeration employed by Ethel Barrymore's character, and a sprawling, anything-goes scrap involving a dirty politician's thugs on one side and our young senator and Katrin's three large brothers on the other. In a skirmish this freewheeling, you're advised to make sure your chad isn't hanging. It's no fun getting kicked in the ballots.

This film should have been brought up to 1080 standards, its in Spanish and you can have English audio with some difficulty, but I have not been able to turn the Spanish subtitles off which detract from this movie.....This movie should never have been issued in this condition.....I would never have bought this if I had known the quality of the image......save yourself the trouble and don't buy it....",1436745600,14,843,4.467532467532467

1221415,3,B00000ICYF,"enjoyed this film immensely and was surprised how the script exploited the stereotype of swedes, are they really that much stronger, independent, honest, and beautiful as depicted in this film, well, at least in the farming community?  each culture does have a mainstream characteristic that seperates them from other countries and geographical regions and this is prolly no exception.  I always found the Italian stereotype misleading but just looking at what that country produced in music, art, and architecture alone definitely sets it apart from others so perhaps it's not misleading to the unsuspecting viewers with less worldly experience.  I found the whole process of being nominated for a congressional seat to be so delusional that when she was walking alll those steps to the capitol I felt nauseous thinking what did that nice girl do to deserve such a disastrous career choice, post-war idealism at it's height was no match for the cynicism and complete breakdown of current political service.  this ending ruined the entire romance and mostly light hearted and deligfhtful fare maintained througout the film.  Seeing Arness as the strapping brother of Young was startling as I found him to be much more handsome as he grew older.  Can't say that about many actors despite the aid of more knife and less fork...  Young never looked more beautiful in this film and found her accent acceptable and not distracting.  Was expecting the butler to be a real challenge given his rep but never saw a flaw in his interactions as the boss, kinda wanted to see her overcome that with her wit and confidence.  sure glad they did not do a FD2 with her fighting corruption, lobbyists, pork projects, and smiling for the constituents.  and oh btw, they kept talking about replacing the rep for the 15th district but the signs all said the 13th???  high recommend for Young, Cotton, Barrymore fans and swedes(?), would love to hear from the Nordic countries who felt this well represented their culture.",1359590400,,2001,4.996987951807229
1221416,5,B00000ICYF,I would recommend this movie to everyone.  I had never seen it and I enjoyed every minute of it.  I rated it five star because it is a five star movie and everyone in the family can watch it.,1356652800,,191,3.871794871794872
1221417,5,B00000ICYF,"The Farmer's Daughter is one of my favorite films & this movie SHOULD be on AFI's top 100 Film's List.
Credit is given by other reviewers, over the excellent performances by Charles Bickford, Ethel Barrymore, and the much deserved Academy Award win by Loretta Young herself. Others include two great character actors: Harry Davenport & Welshman Rhys Williams, & the picture is full of familiar, lesser known faces, including early James Arness.
Joseph Cotton, whom I've of late begun to appreciate, gives a wonderful performance as the likeable congressman that Young's character Katie, comes to work for.
A brief synopsis:  farm girl Katie loses $$ for nursing course when she goes to big city, & is then forced to take a maid's job in politico's mansion. Conflict ensues when Katie is induced to run for congress herself, & smitten Senator Cotton is in the opposing party. But when Katie's reputation is besmirched, Cotton & friends gallop to the the rescue.
Truly, I think you'll love The Farmer's Daughter; it's not only entertaining but inspiring.
I hope that reasonably priced copies are marketed soon, so a whole new generation can enjoy it.

Who would think that this movie had been translated into Spanish and couldn't be played on my player, and that there were no USA formatted copies in the pile?

1221420,5,B00000ICYF,"Loretta Young deserved the Oscar for her role in The Farmer's Daughter.  Young had had a legendary career as one of Hollywood's leading ladies.  Her beauty was extraordinary in a town where beauties were a dime a dozen.  She was underappreciated for her acting prowess.  She knew she was no Bette Davis, but Davis herself when asked about Young's talent, said that she was ""competent.""  I believe she was far more than competent, and this is quite obvious in The Farmer's Daughter, a delightful comedy.  Young was an excellent comedienne, and she holds her own with some of Hollywood's greatest pros: Joe Cotton, Ethel Barrymore and Charles Bickford.  It is remarkable that the year of 1947, Young made two of her best films, The Farmer's Daughter and The Bishop's Wife, the latter is a great film, in which she stars with Gary Grant.  But the film is really hers:  her radiant, almost spiritual beauty, steals the film right from under Gary Grant and David Niven.  The late 1940s were good years for Young one of a few the stars of the Golden Age to survive into the late forties. She then had the brains and the courage to tackle the new medium of TV.  She became the biggest female TV star of the 1950s (she and Lucille Ball).  Who can ever forget her swinging througn her door in a designer gown every week.  Yes, after a while people would sneer, but in those innocent days, she was the apex of sta glamour.  A classy lady who knew how to wear clothes, created by the best designers in Hollywood including Jean Louis her future husband, he who designed Rita Hayworth's gown in Gilda.  Compared to today's crop of stars, Young is peerless in style and beauty.  There are few who have had such a long career, one that spanned more than seventy years.  As a child, she was an extra in a R. Valentino film.  She fondly recalls him as being very kind to the children on the set, taking tham for rides on his horse.  How's that for a Hollywood memory!  Everyone loved her becasue she was down to earh, no prima donna, very like her former co-star Jean Harlow, both of them staring in the film Platinum Blonde, although Young at the time had top-billing.  And continued to have top billing for most of her carrer.  Always an A-list actress.  No B movies for her!",1328400000,2,2260,4.512315270935961

1221429,5,B00000ICYF,"1947 seems to have been a bit of an off year in Hollywood; its best remembered film is *Miracle on 34th Street*. Even so, the way in which *The Farmer's Daughter*, which won Loretta Young an Oscar for Best Actress, has been neglected is ridiculously unfair. Aside from my being the first Epinions member to tackle it, even the IMDB provides only one review link for this movie (to a German TV listing). Now, no one is going to claim that *The Farmer's Daughter* is a candidate for the AFI's Top 100; but Loretta Young's acting is just one of several attractions the film offers. The dramatic thrust of the story - an honest individual's attempt to break the stranglehold of corrupt backroomers on politics - has lost none of its topicality. Postwar idealism and its conflict with the structure of prewar American politics were hot themes in 1947 (the year's Oscar for Best Picture went to *Gentlemen's Agreement*). And though it would be possible to argue that making a woman the hero in a 1940's film about politics was intended to make the whole plot even more of a romantic fantasy, that's too cynical an assessment by far. Young's feisty Katie Holstrom is given several opportunities in the story to ""go home to Papa"" or even to settle down with the man of her dreams, but she doesn't take them; and its worth pointing out that both Papa and the man of her dreams, both strong characters, support her decision. The moral thrust owes something to Frank Capra's films, obviously, but like those films, *The Farmer's Daughter* maintains that sincere and determined action can change the system, and cynicism is just a cop-out.

The screenplay's origin is also relevant. It was adapted from a play by the female Finnish writer Hella Wuolijoki, called (in English) ""Hulda, Daughter of Parliament"", and had already been filmed in Finland in 1937. The story had been optioned in the U.S. originally as a vehicle for Ingrid Bergman, which helps to explain the Swedish ethnicity of our farmer's daughter - along with the reputation Scandinavia already had at the time for more advanced social equality.

Loretta Young phyically suited the role, tall and with high cheekbones (though not blond, unlike her counterpart Inger Stevens in the 1960's TV series based on the film). Of course the role requires her to assume a fake ""Svedish accent"", and this may grate with some viewers. But Young deploys her rather unconventional good looks to add considerable punch to her part. Loretta Young was not a classic beauty. Aside from the cheekbones, she had a wide mouth and almost overlarge eyes. In a soft mood, the eyes had a luminous glow and the mouth could open in the most radiant of smiles. But when the going gets tough for Katie Holstrom, fire flashes from those eyes and the mouth is set like a bulldog's, and the contrast is particularly stark when the object of her wrath is the easygoing Congressman Morley (affably portrayed by Joseph Cotten), the upright but somewhat lazy product of an established political family, which never had to squeeze a living off the Minnesota prairie through the Great Depression. Cotten's role is tricky; his character has to be honorable enough to make Katie's growing attraction to him credible, but also indolent enough to have put himself in a compromising situation to which Katie must awaken him. This is undoubtably Cotten's finest role as a romantic lead. The extremely strong supporting cast is rounded out by Ethel Barrymore (as Agatha, Glenn Morley's mother and a political heavyweight in her own right), Charles Bickford (as the Morleys' butler - always reliable in this sort of role, he garnered a best supporting actor Oscar nomination) and Harry Shannon (as Katie's down-to-earth farming father).

The plot, although offering ample scope to Young, Cotten and co. to show their stuff, is fairly straightforward. The Holstroms are a hardy Swedish immigrant family farming the Minnesota prairie. Katie Holstrom has long played housekeeper to her father, mother and three brothers. But she longs for a career of her own, and finally, after saving her money and laboriously persuading her menfolk, she sets off for nursing school - only to be swindled out of her tuition money before getting there. Rather than suffer the embarrassment of returning home, Katie takes work as a maid in the mansion of Congressman Glenn Morley and his mother to re-earn her tuition, where she soon crosses swords with the crotchety family butler Clancy. Katie's practised efficiency running a household soon catches the attention of the Morleys (""YOU didn't make this coffee"", winks the Congressman to Clancy, whose foul brew has hitherto ruled the premises). Morley is amused by Katie's characteristic bluntness in political matters; she doesn't hesitate to point out to her employer the gap between a politician's public duty and the self-serving way in which most politicians discharge that duty. In fact the feelings of Congressman (an eligible bachelor, of course) and farmer's daughter towards each other are becoming something more than mutual respect when Morley is drawn into a political scam. His party's other state congressman has suddenly died. When the party bosses come to Morley's house to plot how to anoint an appropriately subservient replacement (and anyone who doubts this is how the system really worked has only to look into the career of then-president Harry Truman from nearby Missouri), Katie is horrified to overhear their scheming in the course of her domestic duties. She attends the rally at which the (corrupt) nominee is announced and causes a sensation by her embarrassing revelations of his early political career in her corner of the state. The opposition party, in a no-hope election situation, immediately offers Katie their nomination. Having breathlessly accepted, she is exposed to slander and mud-slinging as the election approaches. Now Katie's farmgirl origins betray her; completely unaccustomed to this personal aspect of the political rough-and-tumble, she breaks down and goes back to the farm, resolved never to leave it again. Morley is in a quandary. For the first time in his life he must face the morality of his own political position. And, apart from the censure of his mother and his household, he finds himself missing Katie in ways he had never expected. There's just one thing to do: pursue Katie to the family farm and have it out with her there...

*The Farmer's Daughter* was unquestionably the high point of Loretta Young's career. Rosalind Russell was widely touted to win the 1947 Best Actress award for her role in *Mourning Becomes Electra*, and when the judges named Young the winner, she leaped up in delighted surprise and shouted, ""At last!"" She had been making movies for almost 20 years at that point, and nobody knew better than she that her days as a young romantic lead were coming to an end. Her achievement finally established her as a star with serious acting credentials, and she went on to do fine work in Orson Welles' *The Stranger* (1946), *The Bishop's Wife* (1947), and *Come to the Stable* (1949; nominated for another Oscar) before turning very successfully to television. Likewise the film's success was part of the brief postwar renaissance of RKO Studios (Young was the only postwar Best Actor/Actress winner for any of its films), before Howard Hughes gained control and mismanaged the studio into oblivion by 1955.

As of this writing (July 2009) this film, which received two Oscar nominations (Loretta Young's win and Charles Bickford) is unavailable on DVD. It's a TCM favourite and pleas for a DVD are numerous on IMDB and here on Amazon. What's the holdup?",1248307200,8,7675,4.99296875

1221433,5,B00000ICYF,"In an election year when most voters are wondering which candidate is the least dishonest, which is the lesser evil, The Farmer's Daughter is not only refreshing but instructive. It contrasts a political ""machine"" with a lone, honest voice crying in the political wilderness. Katie is that voice. She is the attractive housemaid of a powerful but amiable family, called the Morleys, who have been running their party's political machine for generations.

As one might assume, the Morleys entertain many influential people; but Katie doesn't mind listening to their conversations and interjecting her political views as she hands them a drink or canap. Everyone is taken aback by her candor except for the son, Glenn, who is fascinated by Katie, and eventually falls in love with her, as she does with him. He takes her under his wing and encourages her to improve herself by taking night classes. In one class, she has to give a speech, which has her worried; but the family butler, Joseph, who is like another member of the family, introduces her to a little speech once delivered in the Senate by Glenn's deceased father. Katie's simple reading of it moves Joseph and Mrs. Morley.

Eventually, the family realizes that Katie does not approve of their party's candidate for Congress, and she speaks out against him in a town meeting. When the opposition party hears her, and likes what they hear, they talk her into running on their ticket. Katie's three brothers leave the family farm to come and help with her campaign. But it doesn't go well at first; until Glenn advises that she stay honest by being herself. Then the Morleys unwittingly buy into a smear campaign to destroy Katie's candidacy, which causes Glenn to leave the party and fight to clear her name.

Loretta Young plays the naive but wonderfully wise Katie, and it earned her an Oscar for Best Actress. Amazingly, 1947 was also the year she appeared in The Bishop's Wife, another great classic. Joseph Cotton plays the good-hearted Glenn, who was captain of Yale's greatest hockey team and is now following in his father's footsteps as Senator. Ethel Barrymore is Glenn's world-wise mother, Agatha, the family matriarch, who spots character in Katie and isn't above making side bets with the family butler, Joseph. Charles Bickford is memorable as Joseph, for which he was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Lex Barker (Tarzan), Keith Andes (Clash By Night) and James Arness (Gunsmoke) play Katie's strapping brothers, who are terrific in a knock-down, drag-out fight with the bad guys.

Director H. C. Potter's filmmaking career lasted for little more than ten years; but he is distinguished for not only this film but also Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House (1948), with Cary Grant and Myrna Loy. (Lex Barker is in that film as well.) The Farmer's Daughter was a play by Hella Wuolijoki (Juhni Tervataa), that was adapted for the screen by Allen Rivkin and Laura Kerr. The dialogue is snappy and witty, and the situations fun. It was later turned into a TV show that was entertaining but lost a great deal in translation.

The Farmer's Daughter is smartly insightful. It shows that when We the People are honest, it makes honest politicians possible; but when We the People are corrupt, so are our politicians. Katie, an honest politician, was able to rise to the surface because the people around her were basically honest. That is a great lesson to us in this year of dishonest and disappointing politics.

These elements include a wonderful satiric view of partisan politics and how divergent political views can find common ground. Loretta Young is vibrant as the wide eyed political innocent and demonstrates that innocence is not ignorance when she runs for Congress. Joseph Cotten shows his acting skills as a conservative politician who falls for a woman with divergent political views. However, those views are held with strong conviction and are held by such a delightful woman that he can't help falling in love. It's beyond comprehension how this movie has disappeared.",1471219200,2,726,5.213675213675214
