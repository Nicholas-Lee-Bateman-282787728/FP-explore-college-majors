4586225,5,B00565DXJY,As Good As Meet the Sight Words Series . Kid like them all. The Best DVD I have ever seen.,1316908800,4,90,3.55
4586226,2,B00565DXJY,"I love the 3 MEET THE SIGHT WORDS DVD'S.  However MEET THE PHONICS is not the best I wish I would have listen to the other reviews for both of the new Phonics dvd's. Meet the sight words was fun and engaging with colors and actions but,the sounds of the blends are pronounced but when you put the word together to make like ""change"" for example it not pronounced.  It's a really strange dvd.  I don't like it and I'm disappointed.  Meet the sight words had such a great impact on my son's learning and reading them I just knew this dvd had to be perfect.  Maybe this dvd is for an older group, but it's not working for us.  I guess I will watch this one collect dust, because I cannot use it.",1314835200,12,692,4.126865671641791
4586227,5,B00565DXJY,"Let me preface this with saying I may have an odd duck, my son (almost 3) won't watch conventional TV or movies and the only thing he's ever been interested in is the Preschool Prep series.  We own every one, this being our latest addition.  He loves it so much I can use it as a bribe to come back inside, take a bath, brush his teeth, eat his veggies (do ______ and you can watch Meet the Phonics!).  After only a week or two of watching he is pointing our digraphs he sees in books, on signs, on graffiti, etc.  He prefers this one over the Meet the Phonics: Blends but he does like that one as well.  I kid you not, we will be doing a phonics themed birthday party in October if this keeps up.  My only complaint? I wish they were making more videos!",1314057600,7,754,4.0608108108108105
4586228,5,B00565DXJY,"I purchased the Preschool Prep Series two years ago for my then 2yo and she has LOVED it. I found the books that go with the WORDs DVDs and she LOVES them too! When she and I were flipping through a magazine at the doctor's office she saw the ad for the Blends and Diagraphs and said "" oh pretty please Mama can I have those?!?!"". How could I say no to that! :)
I looked on the website but they were full price. So I checked Amazon and discovered them on sale and free shipping!!
When the first one came in the mail she literally was jumping for joy and ran in to watch it immediately. Now everywhere we go she is pointing out letter combos. She's been reading for some time now but this helps because it's not Mama telling her! Yes, I get little sighs already and she's only 4. :0

I have to say, listening to the original series is very boring for adults, (as my friend said ""or-ange. or-ange. Orange!"" drives her crazy) however it must appeal to the kids because my daughter has known her shapes, colors, numbers, letters and words for 2 years and still likes watching these DVDs. These new Phonics DVDs are just a wonderful addition to our educational library! And it's so cute hearing her say the intro to the parents along with the narrator each time she watches.

4586242,5,B00565DXJY,"Oh my gosh , I absolutely love this movie for helping me to introduce the digraphs to my kindergartners. It is so funny how each digraphs comes alive and the kids laugh at examine of their acts. they love to say the sounds of each digraphs along with the movie. The movie is so fun it holds their attention and helps them to learn without even probably realizing they're even learning. I even recommend this movie to the parents of my students to order and use at home.",1438905600,,469,4.340909090909091
4586243,5,B00565DXJY,"We love the Meet the Phonics videos, including the Sight Word videos. In my opinion, this is one of the best. My kiddo is autistic with a speech delay and this video has been great. It repeats the digraphs over and over (""th,"" ""wh,"" and others). My son has trouble pronouncing these tough sounds and this video is a great, fun way to practice. The animation is cute but simple, so he stays focused on the letters and sounds without getting distracted or overstimulated. Great video!!",1436140800,,483,4.627906976744186

4586245,5,B00565DXJY,I love all these videos. Both my 7 yr old and 3 yr old use these. Consistency is best at least once a week and you never know how much they're learning until they suddenly just know it.,1427241600,,185,3.8947368421052633
4586246,5,B00565DXJY,This is FABULOUS for little ones who are just learning letter sounds. I let them watch it in the car when we're driving someplace. They also have a few sight words cartoons and they actually work! GREAT series of educational cartoons.,1427155200,,234,4.7317073170731705

4586248,5,B00565DXJY,"Cannot say enough! Kids loved all these videos. Even though to me they seemed 'dry' they held the kids attention and they even request them over their other videos.
They are learning to read in kindergarten now and have taken off where other kids are struggling with some of the things these videos cover. A big help!",1423526400,,317,4.578947368421052

4586253,5,B00565DXJY,All of this series is truly amazing! I loved it! I bought them for my son when he was three and he started reading before he was 4. He loves to learn but had the attention span of a k nat so these were awesome.,1412726400,,210,3.688888888888889
4586254,5,B00565DXJY,"I used this with my daughter at the age of 3 and it really has helped wonders with her spelling! She is now 6 and has been tested as gifted and has already written papers. If she gets stuck on a word that has a digraph in it, I just have to tell her that there is a digraph and she can figure it out. I really love everything the pre-school prep has.

4586258,5,B00565DXJY,"I got this series for my four year old so he could have an easier time once he gets to kindergarten. I also have the added bonus of this working for my 8 y/o, who has difficulties with his blends, They both like the way the different letter combintions say all their 'names'.  It is a little longer then the other videos, so we do break it up a little. All in all, great series!!",1401753600,,379,4.053333333333334
4586259,3,B00565DXJY,"I am a Kindergarten teacher and downloaded this movie for my little ones. While parts of it are effective, other parts were confusing. This video is aimed toward small children but starts naming alot of exceptions, and ""somtimes"". Also, the pronunciation of the ""wh"" sound was confusing. It just basically shows different words that start with, or contain that digraph with nothing else",1399852800,3,386,5.142857142857143
4586260,5,B00565DXJY,"My children really love watching these videos.  My 2 yo, 5 yo, and 7 yo will watch them repeatedly and love them.  I purchased the Your Baby Can Read set (which is oh-so-much-higher) and they weren't even interested.  It was such a chore.  With this, they actually *want* to view it.",1399075200,,283,4.490196078431373
4586261,5,B00565DXJY,"My two year old loves learning. Between 14 and 18 months she picked up the alphabet and recognition, sounds, shapes, colors, and numbers 1-10 in english and spanish. She taught herself through apps. It's a year later and i decided she may like sight words and learning to read. I rented the Meet the Sight words 1-3 and it was a hit. After 1 or 2 viewings each, she had learned them all. She knew some of them already, but because of this company's videos, she learned the rest with ease. After she proved she knew those, I rented this digraph video and again, it only took a few viewings for her to learn them. She's still young and new to reading, so she's still figuring out how to sound out words, but she knows the sounds these digraphs make when she sees them. She also learned to recognize a few more words from the parts when they give an example of a word using the digraph. I love these videos and though I'm not sure I'll buy them physically since she caught on so fast, I'll definitely give as gifts or recommend to others I know. She's currently watching the blends video. It's longer than the other videos, so she loses interest towards the end and doesn't catch those blends. However, she's catching on quickly. I should add that all of the stuff I just said happened over a period of a week. They're awesome videos, I'm glad I ran across the 'sh' video on youtube. My daughter instantly loved it, which is what prompted our week of Sight Words and Phonics. I'm elated that she's pre-k/kindergarten ready at only 2.5! If you're still hesitant, go on youtube and let your little one watch the previews to determine if these are the right videos for them.",1397347200,,1668,4.436482084690554
4586262,4,B00565DXJY,"Like all the preschool prep DVDs, this is a simple easy way for kids to learn basic phonic principles. I have used this in conjunction with hooked on phonics and my 4 year old can read tons of words.",1395532800,,199,4.128205128205129
4586263,5,B00565DXJY,these videos are very helpful in teaching the different parts of speech to children and they really get into the video. My son who is 3 years old now can read on a 2nd grade reading level,1395187200,,187,4.081081081081081
4586264,5,B00565DXJY,"Once again, Kathy Oxley has not disappointed me. This is another segment to Phonics. My 4 year old knows all the words by the 3rd viewing. We watch it once a day everyday, so he can get used to the words. The animation is the best and it's not annoying due to the repetition, it actually works for kids to see the words come to life and say it's pronunciation. You have to get this. And what's convenient is that the rental is $1.99 for 7 days!!!!",1395100800,,447,4.149425287356322

4586267,1,B00565DXJY,"I cannot believe that to-date there are 23 5Star Ratings for such a terrible product. Maybe there is a new version that corrected everything that was wrong, but the one i got on 12/2013 teaches a language from another planet.  There are actually multiple pronunciations.  The worst is how they instruct to pronounce the ""ng"" as ""Nnnn"". The are implying the 'g' is silent. What!! Crazy!!  Moreover, the full word example they use is ""strong"".  It is obvious they should have taught the reverse: ""gn"" as in ""sign"".  I should only hope Amazon stops distributing this item completely.  It needs to be considered damages goods and should not be available for purchase. In fact the supplier needs to be fined by the US Dept of Education for distributing misinformation and use it as revenue for public education improvements.",1390435200,,819,4.898550724637682

The illustrations capture his attention and he is enthralled.  The first thing he says when he comes in the door is ""Can we watch Phonics?""  It is amazing how well these teach.  I have all of the sight words, the blends, and digraphs.  All are of equal quality.  There are also videos of colors, shapes, and letters from this company.  I suspect they are equally good, but haven't watched them since Little Man already knew those concepts when I found this resource.",1386288000,,589,4.650485436893204

4586271,5,B00565DXJY,"My son was introduced to the Preschool Prep DVD's a few months before he turned 3 and he loves all of them! The first time he watches a new DVD, he does not express an interest, but I watch it with him and say the words out loud and he catches on very quickly. He just turned three and now knows about 30 sight words by memory and loves looking for them in books and signs. I understand what people are saying about the animations not matching the words, but they make the connection. My son will point to the word ""in"" and say that it is the peacock one (because there is a peacock in the animation). He makes that connection and then memorizes the word that much faster. I did not buy the letters/numbers/colors DVD's because he knows all of those already.

Parents need to watch this with their kids and apply it to the real word!!",1384214400,,834,4.245283018867925

As evidence of their effectiveness, my three year old daughter can pick out any of the sounds in this series any time we are reading a book togehter, when we are out in public, and if she happens to look at a page that I am reading. My son, who can barely speak, has also memorized these , and in his limited speech capacity he is able to distinctly verbalize these words.

4586287,4,B00565DXJY,"My son recently turned four years old, and I have been a fan of the Meet the Sight Words DVDs and companion books for over a year. ((A little background, I began using Baby Einstein and Baby Bumblebee DVDs at a very early age since my son stays with me at home while I telecommute for work. I then progressed to the LeapFrog videos and have since moved him on to the ""Meet The___"" series))

Our son was already reading but was having trouble with words which can not obviously be worked out using letter sounds such as where (which may be appear to sound like 'wuh-here') or phonics (which could be sounded out as 'puh-honics') The Digraphs DVD is perfect for explaining these words where two letters make a single sound. If you haven't watched the series before, the creators makes characters of the letters they are teaching such as a CH appearing as a chef eating chocolate chips. This series does a great job of reinforcing the appearance of the letters with the sounds used in pronouncing the associated word(s). My only issue with this particular DVD was the use of a Gnu (a type of Wildebeest) as an example for the GN sound when I think something such as a Gnat may be more common to most kids. Again, kinda picky and not a deal breaker.

This is another great DVD in the ""Meet The ___"" series, and I highly recommend it as well as the other DVDs.",1325635200,4,1355,4.394422310756972
4586288,1,B00565DXJY,"Meet the Phonics is very confusing!  I have purchase all the Meet the Sight Words videos and we love them.  My son has learned a great deal and has shocked everyone who has worked with him.  I thought it would compare are even be a better learning tool then the collection of ""meet the sight words"" for my son.  It just did not work for us and we are huge fans of Preschool Prep, I rushed and brought both of the ""meet the phonics"" dvd's and I'm very disappointed.  Wish I would have waited on reviews.",1323734400,8,502,4.1875

At first I thought the DVD's seemed too simple but I watched my toddler LEARN overnight from them and have grown to love what they are and what they have to offer!!  They are THE BEST, and I would highly recommend ANY of the DVD's, books or digital learning tools!!!  I have all of them.  I started out with the DVD's from a consignment shop and have bought the rest on Preschool Preps website.  THANK YOU for these WONDERFUL tools!!!",1321142400,4,532,4.5

8459224,5,B00565DXJY,"The preschool prep flashcards and dvd's are fantastic. My 3 yr old who had some speech delay now knows and can say the alphabet, count to 20, and knows dozens of sight words.
The flash cards are wonderful for practice AFTER your children have watched the videos several times.
The videos are very entertaining and my 18mo old twins and 3 yr old love them.
I would highly recommend these products for anyone who wants to help get their kiddos' speech/ language/ reading skills jump started!!!
Well worth the money!",1478476800,,513,4.711111111111111
