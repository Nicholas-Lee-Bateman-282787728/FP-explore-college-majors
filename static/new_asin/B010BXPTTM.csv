That's right folks, you can correct and improve the NUT that holds the handle-bars to the seat, and make it a more skilled and safer part! Software is the most important thing you can do to make riding your scoot safer, take the time and learn these skills and you will be a much better and safer rider no matter what kind of motor scooter you ride or the type of riding you do.

8721759,4,B010BXPTTM,"For those that ride motorcycles and wish to improved your low speed skills these DVDs and Booklet are a great place to start. Ride Like A Pro also does formal classes and if there is a class near you the cost is about $50 more than the $100 these DVDs and booklet cost.

Great information of the Friction Zone and how to use it to pull U turns and other low speed maneuvers that can challenge those with large heavy motorcycles (HD Goldwings ... 600 - 900 lbs).
