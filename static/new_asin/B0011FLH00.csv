3064547,5,B0011FLH00,"I watched this series when it was on Sci-Fi, and it is one of the best shows to ever be aired (especially on that channel) and was actually one of the highest rated shows on Sci-fi (only being canceled due to the huge costs to make an episode)  I recommend this series to any sci-fi fan, or fan of shows like X-Files.  Very great stories while funny at the same time!  Glad to see that Sci-fi finally listened to all the petitions and is bringing this out, just hope Season 2 sees a release too!",1198800000,34,495,4.189473684210526

3064636,3,B0011FLH00,"I was quite disappointed in this series.  However, I am not a big fan of science fiction.  If the dialogue is good, the characters are well drawn, and the plotting is reasonable, then I can certainly accept the sci-fi aspect of it.  I loved Buffy the Vampire Slayer and enjoyed Firefly (despite the goofy combination of guns and space ships).

In the Invisible Man, I don't find the characters to be interesting or compelling, apart from the babe in the lab.  I am a sucker of a cute nerd, I guess.

I never buy into the lead character's motivation, his back-story, or his rebelliousness.  He simply doesn't sell it for me.  His boss is okay, but so much of it strikes me as corny.

The plotting and the writing strike me as being weak as well.  I am about 8 episodes into the first season, and I don't know if I really want to finish this series or just put it back on the shelf.  I don't find myself wondering where this next episode will take the characters, or what new layers of back story will be added to them.  If I am tired and it is mid-episode, I shut it down.  I don't get interested enough to stay up late to see what happens next.

Obviously, I am in a minority here and there seem to be a number of people who really like this series.  Maybe if I was 16, had not seen many well-crafted series, this might have a great appeal to me.  But, at my age, it just doesn't float my boat.

If you are a parent thinking about this for your kid, it is fairly clean with not a lot of innuendo (so far) and very little swearing (except one episode where one character uses God's name in vain, when it was unnecessary).  However, for the most part, as far as I have gone in the series, there is very little swearing, which I believe is a plus.",1354233600,3,1744,4.186186186186186
3064637,4,B0011FLH00,"I was hesitant about checking this out at first, thinking that the show's effects looked as hokey as The Secret World of Alex Mack, but after viewing the series, there's a lot to enjoy in this entertaining and fast-paced show. One of the cool things they do with the invisible man on this particular series, is that sometimes he goes nuts due to the power of the quicksilver gene that gave him his powers, which is more in line with the original HG Well's story. It's a fun show, with decent acting and good scripts.",1342051200,,516,4.442105263157894
3064648,4,B0011FLH00,"Great series - thief can go invisible for governament (humor) jobs but can't get away or what makes him invisible would make him go crazy. Light, fun show. ...

3064651,5,B0011FLH00,Great TV Show at a great price. I loved this show on the SciFi channel. It originally came out syndicated and I missed several episodes. Action packed and funny.

3064654,5,B0011FLH00,The series The Invisible Man truly was ahead of its time in both effect and comedic timing!!! The two main characters really jelled as partners and played off of each other's crazy banter Perfectly! So the show could be dramatic and funny all at the same time and worth picking up!!! Miss these guys!!,1320364800,3,301,4.592592592592593
3064655,5,B0011FLH00,I remember watching this show when I was in junior high. This and Farscape were definitely the highlight of my weekends when it came to tv. I just wish they would release the second season on dvd as well.,1320105600,2,204,4.256410256410256
3064656,2,B0011FLH00,"Considering the plethora of positive reviews awarded this series, I'm wondering now if there's something appealingly obvious about it I might have missed.

Admittedly, I got as far as halfway through episode three -- then decided to call it quits.

I really wanted to like THE INVISIBLE MAN, but I found no respite from the persistent, annoying whining and contrived (""comic-relief"") humor afforded by Paul Ben-Victor (an otherwise excellent actor, who played Hobbes).  And the plot itself seemed at times rather...well, I don't exactly want to say ""dopey"" -- so I'll just stop here and say nothing.

There was a ""refreshing"" touch of Dr.-Mengele-type cynicism on the part of some top government secret agents, who -- adhering unwaveringly to the principle that the ends justify the means -- had absolutely no qualms about subjecting an unwilling Darien Fawkes (played well enough, I suppose, by Vincent Ventresca) to their possibly lethal experiments.

At any rate, considering once again how many folks raved about INVISIBLE MAN, take my review with a grain of salt.  I'm honest enough to admit I may not have given it the chance it rightly merited.",1318982400,10,1151,5.095744680851064
3064657,4,B0011FLH00,"I remember watching this when it aired on TV and I also remember liking it, mostly due to Darien's quotes.  After seeing this again, it is apparent that while this show clearly worked with a small budget (few extras, lot of indoor sequences), this didn't prevent it from being good.  In nearly all of the episodes there is some emotional hook to it that lets us peek beneath the usual facades of the characters and thus making them more real.  I am certainly glad I bought this.",1315180800,4,478,4.471264367816092
3064668,5,B0011FLH00,"This is a great value for a DVD box set. For only $6 I got a chance to keep one of my favorite shows from the early 2000s.

What I didn't realize was that you can watch the entire SHOW for free on IMDB, oops.

So, if you've got an extra $6, it's worth to see the packaging and DVDs for those days when the internet goes down...

Actor Vincent Ventresca is one of the most likeable characters ever shines in this series as Darrian Fawkes ( The Invisible Man). A Petty crook who is given a power anyone would want. This series just works, wiity dialogue , likeable characters,and a story you hate to have end. In the inevitable wisdom of the scifi channel they chose to end the series way too soon, in exhange they gave us such gems as python v.s. boa v.s......something else and marabunta 7 starring mitch pileggi's 3rd cousin (twice removed). The Invisible Man series is one of the best produced series next to the underrated fox tv series, Sliders.

3064689,5,B0011FLH00,"Great cast, great dialogue, some clever episodes. This was the first action/comedy/sci fi baby to grace the airwaves. Great casting puts Vincent Ventresca and Paul Ben-Victor together as two spooks for a mysterious and always underfunded organization known only as the Agency. Ventresca's character Darien Fawkes is a reformed thief. His brother got him out of jail by making him a guinea pig for a government project he was working on, thus Darien ends up with a Bio-synthetic gland in his skull that allows him to go invisible. Unfortunately the gland is the target of a mole inside the project who eventually destroys the project, kills Darien's brother Kevin and sets Darien on a path to revenge via the agency. Darien just wants the gland out of his head but due to the meddling of the mole he suffers from a condition called Quicksilver Madness something the mole designed into the gland to insure whoever recieved the gland would be dependent on a counter agent which prevents the madness. The only way to remove the gland that is known will kill Darien so he works for the agency partnered with a deranged but lovable partner in Bobby Hobbs (sp?)

It's a shame it was cancelled, but they were able to complete the story line in the 2 seasons that were completed. I highly recommend the show, sci-fi, X-file fans, even police drama fans will enjoy the show. The show is about Darien Fawks a burglary expert, caught one too many times by the police and as a plea to get out of jail takes his brothers advice to be apart of a gov't experiment. Fawks's brother Kevin heading up the team involved in the i-man project implants Darien with a gland that allows his to 'go invisible...' Things go wrong, the gland cannot be removed and without a shot of 'counter agent,' Darien's gland makes him go psycho, also called Quicksilver madness...

3064695,5,B0011FLH00,"Alas, poor I-Man, you were taken from us far too soon. It's about time jilted fans got a DVD release. Amid a slew of mediocre shows and some truly awful Scifi Original Movies, the Invisible Man was a diamond in the rough. And, as with most of my favorite shows, was cancelled suddenly for no apparent reason.
The show tells the story of Darien Fawkes (played by the talented and underappreciated Vincent Ventresca), one-time thief and con-man who ends up playing guinea pig in his older brother's secret government experiment. Unfortunately, Kevin is killed, leaving Fawkes with a highly-experimental, incredibly unstable synthetic gland implanted in his brain, and no way of removing it without killing him. And then there's Quicksilver Madness; without frequent shots of a chemical cocktail called counteragent, the gland that allows him to go incognito sometimes turns him into a homicidal psychopath. Enter the Agency, a super-secret government research facility operating under the guise of the Department of Fish and Game, headed by a caustic, overweight jerk known as the Official (Eddie Jones). However, despite the fine mess he's found himself in, Fawkes becomes the center of a motley crew of paranoid agents, brilliant scientists and bizarre bureaucrats.
I-Man was well written, well acted, witty and thought-provoking, probably one of the best shows that the Scifi Channel has ever put out. Fawkes and Hobbes (Paul-Ben Victor) make quite the comedic pair (think classic comedy duos), Eberts, the Official's earnest, geeky assistant, is hilarious, and the Keeper (Shannon Kenny), the mysterious, dry-witted doctor assigned to take over Project Quicksilver after Kevin Fawkes' death, is an interesting character as well.
This was a brilliant, fun show that ended before it's time. I hope they don't make us wait forever for season 2...",1219622400,4,1845,5.300341296928328

As the show progressed, they went from being forced together, to being partners, then buddies, then brothers.  It was an amazing transformation to watch.  By the end of the series, there literally wasn't anything one wouldn't do for the other.

Eberts and The Official were a riot together (in one episode Darien walks into The Official's office and almost catches them watching a soap opera).

The Keeper was beautiful and smart (and blonde).  She wasn't just a token female on a guy show, but a valued member of the team.

The special effects were extraordinary, and they were always trying something new, so you wouldn't get bored seeing the same old thing.  The show wasn't about the invisibility... it was about the characters, and that is what made this show so great.

The writing was very clever, and everytime you saw Craig Silverstein's name in the opening credits, you knew you were in for a wonderful evening in front of the TV.

I was shocked when it was canceled.  You would think after 911, they would want to produce a show about federal agents keeping our country safe, but apparently not.

I can hardly believe it's been 6 years since I've watched this show on the Sci-Fi Channel. I'm so glad there's no more waiting!

Oh, you haven't been introduced? Well, let me take you into a world where nothing is as it seems, and you'll meet a man so transparent, you can see right through him.

Darien Fawkes, a two-bit hood who tries to do good on his latest job, gets thrown into jail for the longest stretch possible: life imprisonment.

Darien's brother Kevin decides to help out, and gets Darien paroled into his own little science project. It's quite simple, really...Kevin operates on Darien and implants a gland into his brain that delivers a substance called Quicksilver. This substance has a unique benefit - it turns its host completely invisible.

But this kind of power can't come without a catch, right?

Well, it turns out that Kevin's little gift has an unforeseen side effect on Darien. After prolonged use of the gland, it causes him to become a murderous psychopath, a condition called 'Quicksilver Madness', which can only be suppressed with a counteragent injection.

Over the course of this first season boxed set, we get to watch the adventures of an unlikely cop-buddy comedy/sci-fi team up between Darien Fawkes, the man with the Gland, and his partner Bobby Hobbes, who can't even get a prepaid calling card from their boss, a man only known as ""The Official"". You'll watch their adventures of taking out spy networks, disabling assassins, uncovering Agency experiments that went horribly awry, and much more.

It's all in a day's work for - The Department of Fish & Game?!?!?

Okay, so that's the recap of the first season...now let's tackle the DVD treatment itself.

I had to give this one 4 stars because the special features fell short of my expectations. The sit-down with series creator Matt Greenberg provides some insight into how he conceived the show, but at only 10 minutes long, this left me with more questions than answers. The bonus episode of ""Legends"" from season two was a nice touch - it's like our own little shot of counteragent to offset the Madness of waiting until season two becomes available. I also expected commentaries on more than just the pilot episode. Why doesn't the commentary track have input from Paul Ben-Victor? That's like having a Dukes of Hazzard commentary without Tom Wopat.

I'm hoping that when the next season comes out it'll have features like how the Quicksilver special effects were done, or the TV ads that aired for the show, bloopers, anything to make up for the lack of features here.

3064731,4,B0011FLH00,"An invisible Man?  H G Wells must have been mad, or a genius?  History shows that he was the latter, so the concept of being 'invisible' being rooted in science and psychology can create an amazing series.  Just think of Sue Storm (Invisible Woman).  Other than the sexist moments that could be envisioned, it opens so many doors to incredible fiction.

This Universal release is excellent.  The First Season is so far superior to most of the series out there that the MSRP is justified.  Special effects are expensive, and unfortunately, like so many series before SFX make and break them.

Darien Fawkes is a lifetime thief.  Caught once too often, he is jailed for the long haul until his brother, Kevin has a conditional release dependant on his co-operation in a scientific experiment. Implanting technology into Dariens' brain, Kevin creates an 'invisible' man whom is dependant on Quicksilver.  Unfortunately Quicksilver madness overtakes him when the dosage is waning with terrible side effects.  His brother is killed by outside forces, and leaves Darien to deal with his power on his own.

That's where the fun begins. The 23 episodes on this set include some spectacular scenarios.  Darien is assigned to protect a witness in ""Raplph"", a phony spiritualist is uncovered with great danger (Tiresias), another invisible man comes to visit in ""It Hurts When You Do This"", and the Chinese government is thwarted in ""Cat and Mouse"".
The 'Fly on the wall' scenario can be very powerful indeed.

Vincent Ventresca plays Darien, the con man/invisible man and Shannon Kenny plays his new 'boss' with great applomb.

Look for this if you can at your local video store.

This show demonstrates one of those rare confluences of talent: Great acting, chemistry and occasionally brilliant writing, all of which came together to produce something far greater than the sum of its parts. The Invisible Man was part of that once-epic friday night prime Sci-Fi Channel lineup that now resorts to rehashes (excuse me: 're-imaginings' if you go with Hammer-speak) of other networks' old shows.

Together with Farscape, another Sci-Fi Channel masterpiece, I-Man illustrated the truly original programming that now-blighted network once produced. I'm delighted that it will finally be appearing on DVD in its home country. We've waited an awfully long time for it, considering the drek Sci Fi HAS released (Black Scorpion, anyone?). But I-Man was always treated like the proverbial red-headed stepchild,  ignored by its parent who showed every sign of being embarrassed by this quirky, funny, wonderful show.

Watching I-Man is a treat, and makes me long for a few good, old-fashioned scripted series. Ones with the same heart, brains, humor and talent behind them as The Invisible Man. I miss the adventures of Darien Fawkes and Bobby Hobbes. Give a me buddy show with characters like these any time! When Sci Fi killed both its original series in rapid succession, I left and have never gone back.

It really was a show if given a chance and maybe shown a year or two later could have had a much better chance, and the worst part was the now gone UPN was willing to pick it up but Sci-fi simply wanted it dead.

Anyways - this was one of my favorite shows when it first came out while I was in HS. And remains. I even modeled my hair and style after Darien Fawkes, I always had a similar one before but man just made it more fun. He had a great personal style and the hair became another character! =D

The characters, writing and acting made the show.

This is by far the best show that the Sci-Fi Channel has ever created (aside from the great BATTLESTAR GALACTICA) and it has been deserving of reruns at the VERY least, but other less interesting and less entertaining shows have been clogging up Sci-Fi's airwaves (STARGATE series, I'm looking at you!).

But onto the show itself. Darien Fawkes (the underappreciated Vincent Ventresca) is a thief who is finally caught and put in prison. He's looking at a life sentence, but his brother comes to his ""rescue"" of sorts when he offers him a deal: Testing an experimental gland implant in the brain that will release a chemical nicknamed ""Quicksilver"" that coats the skin for a brief period of time that bends light around the subject, allowing them to become invisible to the naked eye. Darien accepts the deal, but we know what road good intentions lead to. Fawkes' brother is double-crossed and killed by his assistant Arnaud DeFehrn (the wonderfully sleazy Joel Bissonette), and Fawkes is stuck with the experimental gland before it's perfected. The gland has a potentially fatal flaw which is that if used for too long of a period of time, the user (in this case, Fawkes) will experience what is called ""Quicksilver Madness"" which he experiences psychotic and sociopathic tendencies. Fawkes is recruited by ""The Agency"", a covert ops organization that answers only to The President, run by a perenially frustrated bean-counter usually referred to as ""The Official"" or ""The Fat Man"" (the hilarious Eddie Jones) and his yes-man Eberts (the also-hilarious Michael McCafferty). Fawkes' condition is watched over by the lovely Claire ""The Keeper"" Keeply (beautiful and dry-witted Shannon Kenny), who must regularly give him injections of a counter-agent that wards off the Quicksilver Madness, and is determined to find a way to remove the gland from Darien without the procedure killing him.

The show also gives us a brilliant buddy cop story with Fawkes partnered with Agent Bobby Hobbes (the wonderful and easily recognizable Paul Ben-Victor), a self-professed ladies man and martial arts master, who also may be suffering from schizophrenia that may be fueling these delusions of grandeur (or are they delusions?). The chemistry that is developed between Fawkes and Hobbes is just amazing, and it becomes one of the high points of the show.

One of the other high points is the amazing special effects. When Fawkes goes invisible (and vice versa), the transition is totally seamless. It was this level of achievement that unfortunately brought this show to an all-too premature end because it was just too expensive to keep up that level.

Overall, this is a really great and really fun show that just ended way too soon but it finally is back to watch on this DVD series!",1199664000,87,3044,4.974459724950884
3064765,4,B0011FLH00,"This is a great guilty pleasure!  Not an epic sci-fi show like B5 or even Farscape or anything like that, ""just"" a really fun, fast-paced, witty, sci-fi laden secret agent-type show with well-delivered humor, action and special effects to boot.  I watched this show every week when it was part of Sci Fi Prime on the Sci Fi Channel.  This was one of those rare periods when they were producing and airing a decent line-up.  The lead actor was great fun and quite endearing, and the supporting cast was just right for the action/humor combo nature of the show.  Not that this was a comedic series or anything.  The lead was wise cracking and he and his buddy-agent had their differences, and it worked.  This show even had a fair amount of heart.  Take the worst of what Sci Fi Channel has thrown at us on the cheap every Friday and Saturday night during their worst cycles, and this is the antithesis of that.  This is the type of show Sci Fi should still be producing instead of that really lame Flash Gordon rip or 99%-100% of their Saturday night movies.  Since they will continue to toss the cheapest crap they can come up with at us Friday and Saturday nights, maybe watching reruns of this in your DVD player will hold you over until they stumble on the next Battlestar Galactica by the same sheer, blind luck that ever brought us Farscape or SG1.

3299133,3,B0011FLH00,"I was quite disappointed in this series.  However, I am not a big fan of science fiction.  If the dialogue is good, the characters are well drawn, and the plotting is reasonable, then I can certainly accept the sci-fi aspect of it.  I loved Buffy the Vampire Slayer and enjoyed Firefly (despite the goofy combination of guns and space ships).

In the Invisible Man, I don't find the characters to be interesting or compelling, apart from the babe in the lab.  I am a sucker of a cute nerd, I guess.

I never buy into the lead character's motivation, his back-story, or his rebelliousness.  He simply doesn't sell it for me.  His boss is okay, but so much of it strikes me as corny.

The plotting and the writing strike me as being weak as well.  I am about 8 episodes into the first season, and I don't know if I really want to finish this series or just put it back on the shelf.  I don't find myself wondering where this next episode will take the characters, or what new layers of back story will be added to them.  If I am tired and it is mid-episode, I shut it down.  I don't get interested enough to stay up late to see what happens next.

Obviously, I am in a minority here and there seem to be a number of people who really like this series.  Maybe if I was 16, had not seen many well-crafted series, this might have a great appeal to me.  But, at my age, it just doesn't float my boat.

If you are a parent thinking about this for your kid, it is fairly clean with not a lot of innuendo (so far) and very little swearing (except one episode where one character uses God's name in vain, when it was unnecessary).  However, for the most part, as far as I have gone in the series, there is very little swearing, which I believe is a plus.",1354233600,3,1744,4.186186186186186

One of the cool things they do with the invisible man on this particular series, is that sometimes he goes nuts due to the power of the quicksilver gene that gave him his powers, which is more in line with the original HG Well's story. It's a fun show, with decent acting and good scripts.",1342051200,,516,4.442105263157894

3299153,2,B0011FLH00,"Considering the plethora of positive reviews awarded this series, I'm wondering now if there's something appealingly obvious about it I might have missed.

Admittedly, I got as far as halfway through episode three -- then decided to call it quits.

I really wanted to like THE INVISIBLE MAN, but I found no respite from the persistent, annoying whining and contrived (""comic-relief"") humor afforded by Paul Ben-Victor (an otherwise excellent actor, who played Hobbes).  And the plot itself seemed at times rather...well, I don't exactly want to say ""dopey"" -- so I'll just stop here and say nothing.

There was a ""refreshing"" touch of Dr.-Mengele-type cynicism on the part of some top government secret agents, who -- adhering unwaveringly to the principle that the ends justify the means -- had absolutely no qualms about subjecting an unwilling Darien Fawkes (played well enough, I suppose, by Vincent Ventresca) to their possibly lethal experiments.

At any rate, considering once again how many folks raved about INVISIBLE MAN, take my review with a grain of salt.  I'm honest enough to admit I may not have given it the chance it rightly merited.",1318982400,10,1151,5.095744680851064

After seeing this again, it is apparent that while this show clearly worked with a small budget (few extras, lot of indoor sequences), this didn't prevent it from being good.  In nearly all of the episodes there is some emotional hook to it that lets us peek beneath the usual facades of the characters and thus making them more real.

Great casting puts Vincent Ventresca and Paul Ben-Victor together as two spooks for a mysterious and always underfunded organization known only as the Agency. Ventresca's character Darien Fawkes is a reformed thief. His brother got him out of jail by making him a guinea pig for a government project he was working on, thus Darien ends up with a Bio-synthetic gland in his skull that allows him to go invisible. Unfortunately the gland is the target of a mole inside the project who eventually destroys the project, kills Darien's brother Kevin and sets Darien on a path to revenge via the agency. Darien just wants the gland out of his head but due to the meddling of the mole he suffers from a condition called Quicksilver Madness something the mole designed into the gland to insure whoever recieved the gland would be dependent on a counter agent which prevents the madness. The only way to remove the gland that is known will kill Darien so he works for the agency partnered with a deranged but lovable partner in Bobby Hobbs (sp?) Paul Ben-Victor's character and watched over by the Keeper, the Official and the hapless Eberts, the ultimate yes man.

The show is about Darien Fawks a burglary expert, caught one too many times by the police and as a plea to get out of jail takes his brothers advice to be apart of a gov't experiment. Fawks's brother Kevin heading up the team involved in the i-man project implants Darien with a gland that allows his to 'go invisible...' Things go wrong, the gland cannot be removed and without a shot of 'counter agent,' Darien's gland makes him go psycho, also called Quicksilver madness...

Amid a slew of mediocre shows and some truly awful Scifi Original Movies, the Invisible Man was a diamond in the rough. And, as with most of my favorite shows, was cancelled suddenly for no apparent reason.
The show tells the story of Darien Fawkes (played by the talented and underappreciated Vincent Ventresca), one-time thief and con-man who ends up playing guinea pig in his older brother's secret government experiment. Unfortunately, Kevin is killed, leaving Fawkes with a highly-experimental, incredibly unstable synthetic gland implanted in his brain, and no way of removing it without killing him. And then there's Quicksilver Madness; without frequent shots of a chemical cocktail called counteragent, the gland that allows him to go incognito sometimes turns him into a homicidal psychopath. Enter the Agency, a super-secret government research facility operating under the guise of the Department of Fish and Game, headed by a caustic, overweight jerk known as the Official (Eddie Jones). However, despite the fine mess he's found himself in, Fawkes becomes the center of a motley crew of paranoid agents, brilliant scientists and bizarre bureaucrats.
I-Man was well written, well acted, witty and thought-provoking, probably one of the best shows that the Scifi Channel has ever put out. Fawkes and Hobbes (Paul-Ben Victor) make quite the comedic pair (think classic comedy duos), Eberts, the Official's earnest, geeky assistant, is hilarious, and the Keeper (Shannon Kenny), the mysterious, dry-witted doctor assigned to take over Project Quicksilver after Kevin Fawkes' death, is an interesting character as well.
This was a brilliant, fun show that ended before it's time. I hope they don't make us wait forever for season 2...",1219622400,4,1845,5.300341296928328

3299204,5,B0011FLH00,"This is definitely one of the best cast shows ever.  Vincent Ventresca and Paul Ben-Victor were born to work together.  They were the heart and soul of this show.

As the show progressed, they went from being forced together, to being partners, then buddies, then brothers.  It was an amazing transformation to watch.  By the end of the series, there literally wasn't anything one wouldn't do for the other.

Eberts and The Official were a riot together (in one episode Darien walks into The Official's office and almost catches them watching a soap opera).

The Keeper was beautiful and smart (and blonde).  She wasn't just a token female on a guy show, but a valued member of the team.

The special effects were extraordinary, and they were always trying something new, so you wouldn't get bored seeing the same old thing.  The show wasn't about the invisibility... it was about the characters, and that is what made this show so great.

The writing was very clever, and everytime you saw Craig Silverstein's name in the opening credits, you knew you were in for a wonderful evening in front of the TV.

I was shocked when it was canceled.  You would think after 911, they would want to produce a show about federal agents keeping our country safe, but apparently not.

I can hardly believe it's been 6 years since I've watched this show on the Sci-Fi Channel. I'm so glad there's no more waiting!

Oh, you haven't been introduced? Well, let me take you into a world where nothing is as it seems, and you'll meet a man so transparent, you can see right through him.

Darien Fawkes, a two-bit hood who tries to do good on his latest job, gets thrown into jail for the longest stretch possible: life imprisonment.

Darien's brother Kevin decides to help out, and gets Darien paroled into his own little science project. It's quite simple, really...Kevin operates on Darien and implants a gland into his brain that delivers a substance called Quicksilver. This substance has a unique benefit - it turns its host completely invisible.

But this kind of power can't come without a catch, right?

Well, it turns out that Kevin's little gift has an unforeseen side effect on Darien. After prolonged use of the gland, it causes him to become a murderous psychopath, a condition called 'Quicksilver Madness', which can only be suppressed with a counteragent injection.

Over the course of this first season boxed set, we get to watch the adventures of an unlikely cop-buddy comedy/sci-fi team up between Darien Fawkes, the man with the Gland, and his partner Bobby Hobbes, who can't even get a prepaid calling card from their boss, a man only known as ""The Official"". You'll watch their adventures of taking out spy networks, disabling assassins, uncovering Agency experiments that went horribly awry, and much more.

It's all in a day's work for - The Department of Fish & Game?!?!?

Okay, so that's the recap of the first season...now let's tackle the DVD treatment itself.

I had to give this one 4 stars because the special features fell short of my expectations. The sit-down with series creator Matt Greenberg provides some insight into how he conceived the show, but at only 10 minutes long, this left me with more questions than answers. The bonus episode of ""Legends"" from season two was a nice touch - it's like our own little shot of counteragent to offset the Madness of waiting until season two becomes available. I also expected commentaries on more than just the pilot episode. Why doesn't the commentary track have input from Paul Ben-Victor? That's like having a Dukes of Hazzard commentary without Tom Wopat.

I'm hoping that when the next season comes out it'll have features like how the Quicksilver special effects were done, or the TV ads that aired for the show, bloopers, anything to make up for the lack of features here.

3299228,4,B0011FLH00,"An invisible Man?  H G Wells must have been mad, or a genius?  History shows that he was the latter, so the concept of being 'invisible' being rooted in science and psychology can create an amazing series.  Just think of Sue Storm (Invisible Woman).  Other than the sexist moments that could be envisioned, it opens so many doors to incredible fiction.

This Universal release is excellent.  The First Season is so far superior to most of the series out there that the MSRP is justified.  Special effects are expensive, and unfortunately, like so many series before SFX make and break them.

Darien Fawkes is a lifetime thief.  Caught once too often, he is jailed for the long haul until his brother, Kevin has a conditional release dependant on his co-operation in a scientific experiment. Implanting technology into Dariens' brain, Kevin creates an 'invisible' man whom is dependant on Quicksilver.  Unfortunately Quicksilver madness overtakes him when the dosage is waning with terrible side effects.  His brother is killed by outside forces, and leaves Darien to deal with his power on his own.

That's where the fun begins. The 23 episodes on this set include some spectacular scenarios.  Darien is assigned to protect a witness in ""Raplph"", a phony spiritualist is uncovered with great danger (Tiresias), another invisible man comes to visit in ""It Hurts When You Do This"", and the Chinese government is thwarted in ""Cat and Mouse"".
The 'Fly on the wall' scenario can be very powerful indeed.

Vincent Ventresca plays Darien, the con man/invisible man and Shannon Kenny plays his new 'boss' with great applomb.

Look for this if you can at your local video store.

This show demonstrates one of those rare confluences of talent: Great acting, chemistry and occasionally brilliant writing, all of which came together to produce something far greater than the sum of its parts. The Invisible Man was part of that once-epic friday night prime Sci-Fi Channel lineup that now resorts to rehashes (excuse me: 're-imaginings' if you go with Hammer-speak) of other networks' old shows.

Together with Farscape, another Sci-Fi Channel masterpiece, I-Man illustrated the truly original programming that now-blighted network once produced. I'm delighted that it will finally be appearing on DVD in its home country. We've waited an awfully long time for it, considering the drek Sci Fi HAS released (Black Scorpion, anyone?). But I-Man was always treated like the proverbial red-headed stepchild,  ignored by its parent who showed every sign of being embarrassed by this quirky, funny, wonderful show.

Watching I-Man is a treat, and makes me long for a few good, old-fashioned scripted series. Ones with the same heart, brains, humor and talent behind them as The Invisible Man. I miss the adventures of Darien Fawkes and Bobby Hobbes. Give a me buddy show with characters like these any time!

Cancelling this show and greenlighting some fluffy piece of crap? Mind-boggling. Okay, its Friday night and I'm excited because for two whole hours I know I'm going to be pinned in front of the television watching SciFi showing  two of the BEST shows on television: The Invisible Man and Farscape. The Invisible Man was that rare gem where the writing, directing, cast, acting and concept actually came together in producing unbelievable television!!! What do we have now? Reality television? Yuck!!!!! And the thing that kills me is that The Invisible Man was cancelled while it was in its prime and SciFi refused to let it live on!! I no longer watch SciFi...all the good stuff is gone. But I am very, very, completely happy that this show is finally coming out on DVD!!!! Hopefully, the 2nd season will make it to DVD as well. I do miss I-Man, but, now, I can relive this amazing series in all of its glory!!!!!",1201824000,7,1098,4.630769230769231

3299260,5,B0011FLH00,"I gotta say I was losing hope, but kept with the petitions and everything, FINALLY Sci-Fi listens! Luckily in good relations with Vincent Ventressca and others who were involved with the show, it's FINALLY being released on DVD! For whatever reason Sci-fi had a bone to pick with the show, should have been released a long time ago... It really was a show if given a chance and maybe shown a year or two later could have had a much better chance, and the worst part was the now gone UPN was willing to pick it up but Sci-fi simply wanted it dead.

Anyways - this was one of my favorite shows when it first came out while I was in HS. And remains. I even modeled my hair and style after Darien Fawkes, I always had a similar one before but man just made it more fun. He had a great personal style and the hair became another character! =D

The characters, writing and acting made the show. Fawkes and Hobbes was an incredible duo by the 2nd season heh, Paul Ben Victor (Hobbes) and Vincent Ventressca (Fawkes) just had an infectious tongue and cheek chemistry really one of the greatest on screen duos of recent years they complimented eachother so well. It was so sad to see I-Man disappear...

The acting was underrated and heh Ventressca just was SO great, his sarcastic dry wit, and the things said without words. The whole cast.

I cannot wait till March it's way too far away lol. Nor can I wait for the great 2nd season! I guess I'll have to rely on my ancient VHS tapes I still have of only a dozen or so episodes! =D",1200096000,6,1524,4.299651567944251
3299261,5,B0011FLH00,"After seeing so many poor or banal sci-fi series released on DVD, I was upset that the Sci-Fi Channel's THE INVISIBLE MAN series was not amongst them (at least not in the US anyway... it's been available for years on Region 2 DVD's), but now, at long last, it's coming! This is by far the best show that the Sci-Fi Channel has ever created (aside from the great BATTLESTAR GALACTICA) and it has been deserving of reruns at the VERY least, but other less interesting and less entertaining shows have been clogging up Sci-Fi's airwaves (STARGATE series, I'm looking at you!).

But onto the show itself. Darien Fawkes (the underappreciated Vincent Ventresca) is a thief who is finally caught and put in prison. He's looking at a life sentence, but his brother comes to his ""rescue"" of sorts when he offers him a deal: Testing an experimental gland implant in the brain that will release a chemical nicknamed ""Quicksilver"" that coats the skin for a brief period of time that bends light around the subject, allowing them to become invisible to the naked eye. Darien accepts the deal, but we know what road good intentions lead to. Fawkes' brother is double-crossed and killed by his assistant Arnaud DeFehrn (the wonderfully sleazy Joel Bissonette), and Fawkes is stuck with the experimental gland before it's perfected. The gland has a potentially fatal flaw which is that if used for too long of a period of time, the user (in this case, Fawkes) will experience what is called ""Quicksilver Madness"" which he experiences psychotic and sociopathic tendencies. Fawkes is recruited by ""The Agency"", a covert ops organization that answers only to The President, run by a perenially frustrated bean-counter usually referred to as ""The Official"" or ""The Fat Man"" (the hilarious Eddie Jones) and his yes-man Eberts (the also-hilarious Michael McCafferty). Fawkes' condition is watched over by the lovely Claire ""The Keeper"" Keeply (beautiful and dry-witted Shannon Kenny), who must regularly give him injections of a counter-agent that wards off the Quicksilver Madness, and is determined to find a way to remove the gland from Darien without the procedure killing him.

The show also gives us a brilliant buddy cop story with Fawkes partnered with Agent Bobby Hobbes (the wonderful and easily recognizable Paul Ben-Victor), a self-professed ladies man and martial arts master, who also may be suffering from schizophrenia that may be fueling these delusions of grandeur (or are they delusions?). The chemistry that is developed between Fawkes and Hobbes is just amazing, and it becomes one of the high points of the show.

One of the other high points is the amazing special effects. When Fawkes goes invisible (and vice versa), the transition is totally seamless. It was this level of achievement that unfortunately brought this show to an all-too premature end because it was just too expensive to keep up that level.

Overall, this is a really great and really fun show that just ended way too soon but it finally is back to watch on this DVD series!",1199664000,87,3044,4.974459724950884
3299262,4,B0011FLH00,"This is a great guilty pleasure!  Not an epic sci-fi show like B5 or even Farscape or anything like that, ""just"" a really fun, fast-paced, witty, sci-fi laden secret agent-type show with well-delivered humor, action and special effects to boot.  I watched this show every week when it was part of Sci Fi Prime on the Sci Fi Channel.  This was one of those rare periods when they were producing and airing a decent line-up.  The lead actor was great fun and quite endearing, and the supporting cast was just right for the action/humor combo nature of the show.  Not that this was a comedic series or anything.  The lead was wise cracking and he and his buddy-agent had their differences, and it worked.  This show even had a fair amount of heart.  Take the worst of what Sci Fi Channel has thrown at us on the cheap every Friday and Saturday night during their worst cycles, and this is the antithesis of that.  This is the type of show Sci Fi should still be producing instead of that really lame Flash Gordon rip or 99%-100% of their Saturday night movies.  Since they will continue to toss the cheapest crap they can come up with at us Friday and Saturday nights, maybe watching reruns of this in your DVD player will hold you over until they stumble on the next Battlestar Galactica by the same sheer, blind luck that ever brought us Farscape or SG1.
