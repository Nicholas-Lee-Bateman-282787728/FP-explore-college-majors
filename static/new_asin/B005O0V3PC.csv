4850911,5,B005O0V3PC,"This movie is really great!  It feels like a Twilight sequel- only better.  The story is very interesting and it has some humor for a horror type movie.  The music is awesome and original. I liked the multiple stories all connected in the end.  It is an ""indie"" movie, but it was surprisingly good! The acting was scary and funny at the same time!",1353715200,,347,4.375

4850913,1,B005O0V3PC,"Do you want to see just how bad a bad movie can be?  Rent this one and see for yourself. The acting is horrible, the script is trying to be Twilight, the music is just okay, and the effects are beyond cheap and cheesy.  How on earth do these movies get made?",1325030400,,258,3.9423076923076925
4850914,5,B005O0V3PC,This was an awesome movie! Shayne Leighton is a brilliant writer/actress. Before buying the movie I watched webisodes on youtube that drew me in.,1319760000,5,145,5.083333333333333
8480869,4,B005O0V3PC,"When I first saw this movie, I didn't know what to expect. and was ready to give up on it. Now I've seen the movie more the required amount lol. It really good and has a new take on different creatures. The Acting sub-par for high schoolers. But very good attempt. It's not bad but It's a movie would watch every now and then just for a change of pace. I'm my case it an Idea starter.",1524009600,,384,4.0

8480873,1,B005O0V3PC,"I think my neighbor garage band, that's terrible by the way, made this terrible movie. Awful acting. Awful accents, just terrible. Pass, pass, pass on this. It's beyond a B rated film. It F for flunked totally. And what special effects? LOL",1489795200,,240,4.738095238095238
8480874,1,B005O0V3PC,"The acting, filming, and effects seem to have been done by high school kids.  Remember those films you did in school where there is too long of a pause in between each person's line.  This is one of those.  At four minutes in I had enough.  I fast forwarded twice in hopes that there would be any improvement, but sadly there wasn't.",1489190400,,333,4.32258064516129

8480877,3,B005O0V3PC,The best acting came from the supporting actors and if it wasn't for them this movie would be getting 1 star. The story line was interesting just needed more money for better special effects.,1481328000,,191,4.647058823529412
