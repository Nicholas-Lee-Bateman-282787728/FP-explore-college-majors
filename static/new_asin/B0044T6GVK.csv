4261525,5,B0044T6GVK,"I have just finished watching the videos and absolutely can give it a 5 star rating. I have been in practice for 12 years and spent my fair share of money going to Chiropractic Seminars and have heard most of the big name Chiropractors talk. The Chiropractic Marketing Unleashed Videos are bar none the best investment I have made in my career. The strategies Ben discusses are real life, trackable ways to get patients in the door. It is pure marketing. I got tired of the gurus always focusing on philosophy, and making sure you are on purpose. Blah, Blah, Blah. What I need is patients in the door, and on the phone making appointments. That is my purpose. Ben's marketing ideas work. I have been implementing the ideas over the last month and see the difference in my stats. As long as I continue to take action and implement the ideas, I will have a steady stream of patients. Thank You Ben for giving us real world solutions to filling our practices.",1286841600,,956,4.531791907514451

I have studied and subscribed to Ben's material for nearly 14 years. I'm proud to report that not a year has gone by where I'm not impressed by how much forward thinking Ben is and how he keeps coming up with new ideas, new ways to implement, new ways to motivate. I have followed most of the major marketing gurus from different professions, and I can truly say whatever Ben puts out is worth gold (when compared to what you paid). Once you enter ""Planet Ben"", your income, your practice, your lifestyle will soar to new heights. I would highly recommend making this small investment in the DVD and as the saying goes ""little hinges swing big doors"" - this DVD is that little hinge that can swing the big million dollar door for you.",1286841600,,851,4.461538461538462
8416309,1,B0044T6GVK,"This was not worth the money. I think I may have gave my copy away or it is in the garage somewhere. If you notice all the five star reviews are nearly all the same time. So, maybe that says something about this type of marketing. Look at the other 1 star because I agree.",1369612800,2,272,3.963636363636364
8416310,1,B0044T6GVK,"Most all of this DVD is a about joining Ben Cummings management group. He is constantly directing you to his website to join his practice management group (for big money)...then maybe (maybe) he'll actually tell you some marketing ideas once you've joined.  Very very few ideas were on the DVD itself.  He is too busy marketing himself by telling you that he has a brilliant idea....Unfortunately, the only way to find out more about how the idea works is to join his management group. Hmmm.  Seems like a bait/switch to me.  He is not offering much as far a good marketing ideas for chiropractors to use by just buying the DVD.  It was a waste of money as well as a waste of time to listen to it. If you want to commit to spending a ton of money for his ideas, just go directly to his website and join there.  Either way, I'll pass!!!!  Don't waste your money on this.",1336953600,8,869,4.3602484472049685

Marketing chiropractic has become increasingly difficult in recent years but Ben Cummings is masterful at teaching highly-profitable chiropractic advertising techniques.
