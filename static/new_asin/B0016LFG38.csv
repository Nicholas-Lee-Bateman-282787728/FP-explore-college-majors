3158951,1,B0016LFG38,"Low budget movie with no shots of outdoors. Everything is shown inside of a hollywood studio room shown as a bunker with steel doors. Everything about this movie is fanasty, and not at all accurate. I really had to laugh at during the last moments of Hitler's life, he calls his wife a bitch. This movie sucks so bad that I actually was very pissed off I actually paid money and my time to watch this. It really ticks me off that people are paying money 35 years later, to the people that produced this crap!",1257897600,2,508,4.302083333333333
3158952,5,B0016LFG38,"Alec Guiness as Hitler is amazing, the events are truly as history dictatesfor as much is as really known. Even the deterioration of Hitler's mind & body as his General's celebrate. Eva Braun's character is wonderful as she soothe's Hitler on his b'day & entertain's the faithful in the final days is outstanding as history is speculative for the most part here. Guiness outshines even Anthony Hopkins in the remake & if you want to see a more shining performance, get this older version of the final time up & to the suicide even to softer side of Hitler as he shows his true love for Eva & her faithfulness to him & her complete lack of knowledge & care of his evil nature. A true dipiction of Hitler's failure to recognize Germany's doom. A must see.",1252800000,3,753,4.5036496350364965
3158953,2,B0016LFG38,"Burdened by old film clips that we've seen millions of times in the past, as well as by stereoptyped portrayals of Hitler and his companions. Hence the viewing experience is essential boring and unexciting, despite the explosiveness of the content. Updated versions of this apocalyptic period give much better and more nuanced portrayals.  For example--""Downfall""-- if you can tolerate subtitles.",1250553600,2,396,5.6
3158954,3,B0016LFG38,"Defiantly cast against type, Alec Guinness transforms ""Hitler: The Last Ten Days"" (1973) into a strangely compelling cinema of the absurd. When considering the claustrophobic madness of those final days in April 1945, director Ennio De Concini's surreal approach works better than expected. Speaking with a grandfatherly British accent, Guinness offers an eccentric yet mesmerizing interpretation of Adolf Hitler  punctuated by striking close-ups that emphasize the German ruler's charismatic evil. Individual sequences evoke the perverse quality of a two-reel comedy, especially Hitler and Eva Braun's suicide pact and its reaction from the Fhrer's inner circle. Despite its erratic tone and pacing, ""The Last Ten Days"" is worth seeing for Guinness' admirably off-kilter performance.",1244592000,7,784,5.938053097345133
3158955,1,B0016LFG38,"I saw this movie (on DVD) again, after many years, mainly to compare it with the other main films as to Hitler's last days: ""The Bunker"" and ""Downfall"" (A/K/A Der Untergang). Of the those three, it is by far the weakest in several respects: Hitler is one dimensional and over the top in presentation; his dialogue is generally made up of cobbled together verses and phrases from his speeches. Many of the Bunker principle players are missing.

The film is dated and the inter-cut original footage does not work well. It looks out of place and only serves as a distraction. The movie really does not measure up next to ""Downfall"". I do give them credit for being the first to take on this subject matter as a feature film with some sort of depth. However, don't think you're watching history unfold in this movie, especially at the end when there is a fictional ""soap opera"" turn of events as Eva Braun and then Hitler commit suicide. With that said, this film is better than two other Hitler films: 1962 U.S. film, ""Hitler"", starring Richard Basehart and the 1973 British TV production, ""The Death of Adolf Hitler"". The latter being so bad it is akin to watching a high school drama production.",1230940800,8,1194,4.632075471698113
3158956,5,B0016LFG38,"AMONG THE PICTURES ABOUT HITLER'S LAST DAYS, THIS IS THE MOST REALISTIC, WITHOUT EXAGERATION IN THE PORTRAITS, AND WITH A VERY INTERESTING MANNER TO INTRODUCE HITLER'S THINKINGS ABOUT NAZI PAST GLORY - WITH SCENES OF REAL DOCUMENTARY FILMS - AS FEED BACK OF HIS AGONY.",1229385600,2,268,4.977777777777778
3158957,5,B0016LFG38,"Alec Guinness is my all-time ""favorite Hitler"" in this very entertaining film. AG is an extremely gifted character actor and he pulls out all the stops in this marvelous performance. I say the movie is entertaining because some of the scenes amount to sly parodies of the personalities & situations involved. I can't really say for sure if the director planned it that way like the ""Springtime for Hitler"" theme in THE PRODUCERS.

The editing is a little ""jerky"" at times, but it works because, after all, the whole movie takes place in Hitler's underground bunker in Berlin. The entire city was under constant Allied bombing. To some extent the editing also conveys a ""home movie"" feel to the production.

Another factor that enhances this ""peek into the past"" genre of HITLER is that certain scenes & speeches are juxtaposed with actual archival footage of the War. Often this is done in counterpoint. For example, the movie Hitler will be ""predicting"" that the Russian & Allied Forces will clash & turn against each other before they get any closer to the bunker. This tirade is montaged with archival film that shows these forces meeting, yes--but East & West embrace & there's singing & dancing & drinking & just general comradship. Hitler is wrong...again.

One of the humorous scenes--and forgive me if I don't name most of the characters: Hitler has summoned a Luftwaffer general back to Berlin because he (Hitler) has become paranoid of the people in his inner circle (for the exception of his secretaries & Minister of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels and his wife Magda.) Now this was an insane request not only because the general was needed where he was, but he--and his lover--almost got shot down before landing near the bunker. His lover is a female flying Ace and a Nazi fanatic as well. When she & the general sit down with Hitler for de-briefing, she can't take her eyes off Eva Braun. Later when she's alone with one of the secretaries she says, ""What does he see in her? You can't mean that they actually..."" The secretary knowingly nods and the lady flyer exclaims, ""But she's so bourgeois!""

Later Hitler throws a small birthday party for the inner circle. As party favors, he hands out little boxes of cyanide capsules. The group begins to fantasize about their impending suicide. The lady flyer says that she and her flyer lover plan to soar over enemy lines & release a hand grenade between the two as they engage in their last embrace. All the guests Woo! & Aah! in approval. The Cook says that she plans to stick her head in the oven. One of the guests says, ""But, Frau Cook, the kitchen is all electric."" The Cook replies, ""Then I'll electrocute myself!""

Diane Cilento turns in an excellent performance as Hitler's long time mistress. She is pretty, fun-loving, loyal, sympathetic--and rather vaporous. While Hitler withdraws with a secretary to compose his Last Testament, Eva fulfills her role as hostess by putting on black face make-up & singing ""When You're Smiling"" in an obvious Marlene Dietrich style. In the end she is a pathetic figure who has blithely allowed herself to be used as Hitler's doormat. It's true that he married her before the very end, but the ceremony is grotesque. When she and her brand new husband go into their private room to kill themselves, Hitler starts ranting about how he knew the war was lost in 1943 with the fiasco of Stalingrad. For the first time Eva hesitantly confronts Hitler. ""You knew two years ago...then why did all those people have to die?"" Hitler has his back to her and immediately becomes abusive, screaming about her being nothing more than a stupid woman, a cow, etc. Then he turns to face her--and she's dead.

While the walls are literally falling down all around them, Hitler pedantically muses about everything from vegetarianism to his conviction that Wagnerian opera singers should perform in the nude. It is a maudlin, morose & ridiculous Hitler, but there is menace & malice as well. Actors are often taught that if they play an evil character, they should find at least one good quality to portray. I think Guinness must have had an almost impossible job of trying to do that. His Hitler is a totally self-obsessed, evil buffoon without one iota of insight. I think Alec Guiness really nailed the S.O.B.

3158958,5,B0016LFG38,Hitler the Last Ten Days is based on a book written by a German Captain who was in the bunker at the time.  It is told from his point of view and the majority of the action takes place in the bunker.  It is true to the book and provides great insight to the figures who visited Hitler in the last few days of the war.  I had it on VHS and upgraded to the DVD.,1220659200,2,359,3.6973684210526314
3158959,5,B0016LFG38,"I think this movie is great,
You can really believe in Alec Gunniss",1215475200,,67,4.230769230769231
3158960,5,B0016LFG38,"At long last, this 1973 British-Italian production has come out on DVD.  I found it well done, although a bit unusual. The director seems to have wanted Hitler's Germany to appear in an ironic way, showing Nazi pomp and circumstance one minute and Germany's devastation and starvation the next.  The film moves in and out of these moods and from black-and-white to color.  Some reviewers have found this strange if not humorous.  I believe it's meant to be ironic and to mock the ridiculous theories of the Third Reich.

""Hitler's Last Ten Days"" tells an important story not only from an historical standpoint but also to help in understanding today's world.  Moreover, the movie follows the facts pretty well, with an occasional lapse of literary license.  In an insightful scene, Hitler declares that SS Gen. Fegelein, who had married Eva Braun's sister Gretl, was guilty of treason in the last few days of the Third Reich.  Hitler rightly saw that Fegelein was in league with his boss, SS Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmler, to present Hitler's corpse to the Allies as a peace offering.  In contrast, Hitler is shown cursing out his new wife Eva at the end of the movie for betraying him by committing suicide before he did.  That was a sheer invention of the screenwriters.  Nevertheless, I'm giving the movie five stars for its fine acting and overall impact.

It's difficult to compare ""Hitler's Last Ten Days"" to other productions covering the end of Hitler and his Third Reich.  These are all done in a straight, serious vein and include a made-for-TV piece, ""The Death of Adolph Hitler,"" from the BBC, 1973, starring Frank Finlay as Hitler.  Also, there is 1981's ""The Bunker"" with Anthony Hopkins as Hitler--another TV drama done for HBO.  Finally, we have the very theatrical and gloomy German production, ""Downfall,"" with Bruno Ganz playing the Nazi dictator, 2005.  While all these all have their moments, I think the one with Alec Guinness is the best.  This is for its wit, irony, and above all, Sir Alec's performance.  His is the best Hitler rendering I've seen to date, with Derek Jacobi a close second in the TV miniseries, ""Inside the Third Reich,"" 1982.

To be a bit critical of ""Hitler's Last Ten Days,"" Simon Ward plays a fictional Nazi soldier who starts out as a hero-worshipper but later becomes disenchanted with Hitler's ways.  Though entrusted with a copy of the dictator's political testament at the end he tears up the document once he escapes from the bunker and is never seen again.  Also odd is the fact that no one plays Albert Speer in ""Hitler's Last Ten Days,"" despite Guinness's Hitler saying he was, ""a genius."" Moreover, Speer did play a key role in Hitler's end game, as most authors and historians will agree.

It must be pointed out that ""Hitler's Last Ten Days"" has not been digitally remastered, as would help its audio and video quality.  Also, casting is surprising in places with Italian actors playing Germans.  But that may be nit-picking since they all do a decent job.  Finally, there are no special features or subtitles with the new DVD, which is unfortunate.  The price of the DVD is modest so we may have to wait further for a collector's edition.

To make up for the lack of special features in ""Hitler's Last Ten Days,"" viewers might wish to acquire the documentary DVD, ""Death in the Bunker.""  It was produced in 2005, by Spiegel TV of Germany.  This is an excellent production and carries interviews with several eye witnesses.  These include Traudl Junge, one of Hitler's secretaries, Rochus Misch, the telephone switchboard operator and SS bodyguard, and even Dr. Schenk, one of Hitler's attending physicians.  There are a number of other good testimonials, too.  It's apparent that several wartime films were remastered and blended into the DVD.  Other clips are left as they were which may be disappointing but perhaps are meant to stand out in contrast.

In summing up, ""Hitler's Last Ten Days"" is an important and valuable production. The portrayal of Hitler by Alec Guinness is first-rate, if not somewhat mocking to the dictator's depleted emotional state.  I'd strongly recommend that others interested in Hitler and World War II add this DVD to their library.  Now to complete the picture we need a DVD of Marvin Chomsky's ""Inside the Third Reich.""  Despite the literary license it takes, ""Inside the Third Reich,"" with its all-star cast, deserves to be remastered on DVD and made available to the viewing public.",1214092800,30,4478,4.875661375661376

3158965,5,B0016LFG38,Great movie. unfortunately I made the mistake on Amazon Prime that it was free. Then I saw I was billed 18 bucks. Probably the most expensive movie they have. Amazon should give you at least two warnings that you are about to be charged to view this 30 year old movie. It was impossible to reach them to tell them that I made a mistake.

That having been said, this is a very well-done production. Very well-researched and Guiness is his usual awesome self when he imitates a character. This movie gives one a very good idea of the delusions which Hitler, Borman and Goebbels lived under right up to the very end. And it also gives good representation of the dawning realization of the rest of the bunker occupants that Hitler had lost everything - Germany and his mind.",1467504000,,649,4.794642857142857

This one is. And so are the other two that are named here.  Alec guiness is a fine hitler in this movie and the film looks great on blu ray too.  It's the story of a deluded psycho tyrant as he comes to realize finally that he has lost the war.  And that's a hard thing for him considering he almost won it at one point.

3158976,4,B0016LFG38,"I have often felt this was an underappreciated film. This British Italian film has a wonderful cast of actors. An exploration of Adolf Hitlers last ten days inside the Furhur Bunker in Nazi Germany. The movie is something that captures great acting, flawless cinematography, and is directed in a wonderful, stand out way. This film is memorable, and is something to return to often.

Olive Films gave a wonderful outlet for this film. A Blu-ray fits this film perfectly. A worthy product to enjoy and speak highly of. Olive Films has allowed this older film to be enjoyed on this new outlet. Another great example of Olive Films choice of sometimes forgotten, or overlooked cinema.

This is a Blu-ray product that I think should be owned and enjoyed. Olive Films like always, gives a great Blu-ray product to a film that should be watched.

This stars an ensemble cast of brilliant actors. First and foremost is the one and only genius actor, Alec Guinness in the main role of Adolf Hitler. Guinness is one of those actors that was able to bring an emotional reality toward the viewer. He was able to create his characters in a living, breathing reality, and the character of Adolf Hitler is no different. His performance of Adolf Hitler is one of those memorable performances that create the human side to one of the most brutal monsters in all of history. Guinness owned the part and crafted an excellent, emotional performance that stands out.

Next I have to mention Simon Ward. Ward is another brilliant example of a flawless performer in films. That is something that makes this film stand out, is the whole cast. The beautiful and extraordinary Doris Kunstmann as Hitlers girlfriend Eva Braun. Also starring Adolfo Celi, Joss Ackland, Philip Stone, Diane Cilento, Sheila Gish, Gabriele Ferzetti, and Eric Porter. Each performer play off each other with utterly wonderful chemistry. Doris Kunstmann and Alex Guinness are flawless together as two characters in history that are displayed in this film with a high quality of believability.

Another example of this film is the music displayed and performed by Mischa Spoliansky. Spoliansky was an amazing Russian born music composer that left the world with a great, vast brilliance, and love of music. Hitler The Last Ten Days was his final film that he composed for. He had composed and worked on many upon many films and TV projects in his life. He passed away in 1985 but left an amazing range of music which can be heard throughout Hitler The Last Ten Days. His music is still used today and most recently for the film soundtrack of Woody Allens Magic in the Moonlight (2014).

This movie is based on the book written by Gerhardt Boldt. Boldt was a Nazi who was there in the Bunker in the last ten days. The book was titled Hitlers Last Days: An Eye-Witness Account. Being stationed in Adolf Hitlers Fuhrerbunker, Boldt was able to attend daily briefings with Hitler, and top Nazis. He was able to observe and be placed in a pivotal reality in history. He saw the workings first hand of top Nazis such as Martin Bormann, Herman Goring, Joseph Goebbels and the monster himself, Adolf Hitler.  His book is an extraordinary journey that firsthand knowledge captured. If you get a chance seek out the book and read it. This movie captures in great detail the inner workings, destruction, and failure of Nazi Germany in the last days, and moments of World War 2. Boldt is played by actor Kenneth Colley in Hitler The Last Ten Days. Colley is probably most remembered for playing the character Admiral Piett in Star Wars Empire Strikes Back, and Star Wars Return of the Jedi. Colley is so much more than that, he is a flawless actor who captured many wonderful examples of characters throughout his vast career. He was a stable as a character actor in many films and TV.

This is directed by the Academy Award winning screenplay writer, Ennio de Concini. Concini was a powerhouse in the Italian film world. Interesting is that he only directed 3 films, and Hitler The Last Ten Days was one of those films. His main focus was writing screenplays for film and TV. He had a vast career starting in the 1940s and went all the way up until the late 90s. I will always know him from writing the screenplay to one of the great horror films of all time, 1960s Black Sunday. He also wrote the screenplay for one of my favorite directors of all time, Lucio Fulcis 1975 western, Four of the Apocalypse. What is also interesting to note about Concini is he had a lot of misses in his screenplay writing. Yes he was an Academy Award Winning Screenplay writer, but he also created films of lessor value and quality. A lot of cheesy, low budget films such as Assignment: Outer Space, and Colossus and the Amazon Queen, amongst many others. Now as I have mentioned he was a talented screenplay writer that did win an award for his writing of the screenplay, for the amazing film 1961s Divorce Italian Style. This is a great extraordinary film and deserves all the accolades it gets. Concini directed Hitler The Last Ten Days as a film to be remembered. He directed a tight structured film with amazing performers.

The film clearly shows Herr Obnoxious in a last-ditch mental effort to convince all those around him that victory still lay ahead, unwilling to admit for a second that his empire was on its last legs.  The usual accusations of betrayal were cast about with abandon.

Guinness had to play the role of a madman growing even more insane scene-by-scene.  He handled it magnificently, and I'd say there weren't many other who'd have done equally well.

The most perplexing and well depicted mood of the film, is how his inner circle was still 100% devoted to their Fuehrer as the Russians systematically dismembered Berlin. Absolute insanity. What were these people afraid of? I enjoyed the way the few surviving OKW officers refused to take blame for the failures on the front or even confront Hitler with the painful truth that the Third Reich was in its death throes. I don't care what psychiatrists, psychologists or sociologists write or say, there is no sane explanation for the the undying devotion these people showed for a mad man.

I found the performances given very enticing and enjoyable. Everyone of the actors and actresses portrayed the senseless devotion to a man who was responsible for the deaths of over forty million people in six short years. And I personally enjoyed the the fade-ins of past glories as Hitler relives his greatest triumphant moments.

3159010,1,B0016LFG38,"Hoo boy ,where to start.
This film is so full of problems that its easier to list the few good things about it than the overwhelming problems that it has.

Good- The period uniforms worn by the Nazi princelings in the film are pretty close to the originals. The cinematography is well done,the sound is clear and the ""bunker"" set looks reasonably close to what you would imagine it to be. Beyond that...

The bad- I've always had a problem with British actors playing Germans (and especially high Nazi officers). The accents are bizarre ,the mannerisms are all wrong and the overall feel is that of a (really) low rent production. This movie continues that proud tradition. Sir Alec Guinness plays Adolf Hitler here and he's easily the least believable man to play the character of all the ""major"" productions of this story. ( ""Downfall"" and  ""The Bunker"" are the other two) If you see these movies in some sort of chronological order ,with this one going first ,it doesn't seem so bad. (Indeed , the producers of Downfall seem to have borrowed liberally from this film) Next , watch ""The Bunker"" and you will get a better appreciation of just how hard it is for a producer to make this subject compelling. Finally , watch ""Downfall"" in the original German and you realize that you are viewing the definitive film on the subject, a true masterpiece.

The pacing and narrative of this one are accurate ,but boring,and Guinness alternates between an almost giddy ,silly, gay Hitler and an almost expressionless zombie that really never generates any enthusiasm or rage as his Third Reich is compressed on all sides by his enemies. Indeed ,at times its almost as if Guinness is staring at the other actors speaking their parts as if he is in a trance that is only broken when he has to say some more of his poorly written and implausibly delivered lines. This we know : Hitler was NOT calm , collected and in good humor over the last ten days of his life. At times this movie makes you wonder if Guinness is about to burst into a song (and dance) as he smiles and chuckles and tells little anecdotes to his cardboard cutout supporting cast. He plays other scenes as if he swallowed a quart of Robitussin before the cameras rolled.

Hitlers love interest Eva Braun is played by Doris Kunstmann . Horribly miscast ,she probably didn't put this movie on her resume as she forged a nearly 4 decade career in cinema. In this effort , she appears almost child like and wayyyyyyy too young ( Eva Braun was 33 when she died, Kunstmann was 29 when this film was made and looks about 19) for Guinness (as Hitler) . Her wardrobe for this role looks like she borrowed a few loose odds and ends from a soft core porn production in a nearby studio. Her song and dance number (in blackface !) is not to be missed.

Other casting and narrative gaffes abound. Aviatrix Hanna Reitch is played by  Diane Cilento and she too ,evokes fizzy- soda- pop- nose- burning laughter for her portrayal of one of Hitlers most fanatical and psychotic followers. Cilento looks like she was just sent over from that same soft core film referenced earlier... Her makeup and hair actually produced audible giggles when we viewed this film the first time. Perfectly coiffed with a tailored uniform ,the real Reitch never (ever) looked this good.

Man for all nationalities Adolfo Celi plays General Hans Krebs and its hard to tell if his dialog is dubbed.( It's also hard to tell if the producers knew that he is Sicilian)  Celi has alternately played just about every ethnic group on earth ( Greek , Italian , Spaniard , German ) I half expect to someday see a film where he pulls off a Penguins head and says "" Top o' the marnin' to ya"" in an Irish brogue. ( I wouldn't have been shocked if he had done it in this film) Anyway , he is just lost and as out of place as one man can be. As ridiculous as he appears, at least he got a paycheck from this dung heap.

The rest of the cast is a mixture of non entities and never was'es that leave the whole thing just kind of piled up on the floor begging to be thrown out with the trash. The editing suffers from the quaint Italian custom of quick cuts and non sequitor film noir insertions. All in all ,not easy to watch and even harder to fathom.

Questions and inconsistencies characterize this film. Like , where the heck did Albert Speer disappear to ? History buffs know that Speer played a significant role in the final drama in the bunker ,but he seems to have disappeared down the memory hole in this film. He is not mentioned and no character portrays him here. Odd. Likewise Joeseph Goebbels. The "" Poison Dwarf"" has a mere bit part in this production with just a few lines and almost no screen presence. Perhaps its because the producers wanted to keep Guinness on screen as much as possible to maximize their investment. Hard to say ,but in real life , Goebbels was not a bit player,he was a major part of the regime. Just another pair of minor mysteries that are in keeping with this deeply flawed production.

Summary- IF you can find this film on DVD and IF you can score a copy for a dollar...You will have wasted your dollar. This movie is wretched and unsatisfying. Better to take that dollar and rent Downfall and watch it again than this pile of crap.",1275782400,9,5278,4.486458333333333

3393451,3,B0016LFG38,"Defiantly cast against type, Alec Guinness transforms ""Hitler: The Last Ten Days"" (1973) into a strangely compelling cinema of the absurd. When considering the claustrophobic madness of those final days in April 1945, director Ennio De Concini's surreal approach works better than expected. Speaking with a grandfatherly British accent, Guinness offers an eccentric yet mesmerizing interpretation of Adolf Hitler  punctuated by striking close-ups that emphasize the German ruler's charismatic evil. Individual sequences evoke the perverse quality of a two-reel comedy, especially Hitler and Eva Braun's suicide pact and its reaction from the Fhrer's inner circle. Despite its erratic tone and pacing, ""The Last Ten Days"" is worth seeing for Guinness' admirably off-kilter performance.",1244592000,7,784,5.938053097345133
3393452,1,B0016LFG38,"I saw this movie (on DVD) again, after many years, mainly to compare it with the other main films as to Hitler's last days: ""The Bunker"" and ""Downfall"" (A/K/A Der Untergang). Of the those three, it is by far the weakest in several respects: Hitler is one dimensional and over the top in presentation; his dialogue is generally made up of cobbled together verses and phrases from his speeches. Many of the Bunker principle players are missing.

The film is dated and the inter-cut original footage does not work well. It looks out of place and only serves as a distraction. The movie really does not measure up next to ""Downfall"". I do give them credit for being the first to take on this subject matter as a feature film with some sort of depth. However, don't think you're watching history unfold in this movie, especially at the end when there is a fictional ""soap opera"" turn of events as Eva Braun and then Hitler commit suicide. With that said, this film is better than two other Hitler films: 1962 U.S. film, ""Hitler"", starring Richard Basehart and the 1973 British TV production, ""The Death of Adolf Hitler"". The latter being so bad it is akin to watching a high school drama production.",1230940800,8,1194,4.632075471698113

3393454,5,B0016LFG38,"Alec Guinness is my all-time ""favorite Hitler"" in this very entertaining film. AG is an extremely gifted character actor and he pulls out all the stops in this marvelous performance. I say the movie is entertaining because some of the scenes amount to sly parodies of the personalities & situations involved. I can't really say for sure if the director planned it that way like the ""Springtime for Hitler"" theme in THE PRODUCERS.

The editing is a little ""jerky"" at times, but it works because, after all, the whole movie takes place in Hitler's underground bunker in Berlin. The entire city was under constant Allied bombing. To some extent the editing also conveys a ""home movie"" feel to the production.

Another factor that enhances this ""peek into the past"" genre of HITLER is that certain scenes & speeches are juxtaposed with actual archival footage of the War. Often this is done in counterpoint. For example, the movie Hitler will be ""predicting"" that the Russian & Allied Forces will clash & turn against each other before they get any closer to the bunker. This tirade is montaged with archival film that shows these forces meeting, yes--but East & West embrace & there's singing & dancing & drinking & just general comradship. Hitler is wrong...again.

One of the humorous scenes--and forgive me if I don't name most of the characters: Hitler has summoned a Luftwaffer general back to Berlin because he (Hitler) has become paranoid of the people in his inner circle (for the exception of his secretaries & Minister of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels and his wife Magda.) Now this was an insane request not only because the general was needed where he was, but he--and his lover--almost got shot down before landing near the bunker. His lover is a female flying Ace and a Nazi fanatic as well. When she & the general sit down with Hitler for de-briefing, she can't take her eyes off Eva Braun. Later when she's alone with one of the secretaries she says, ""What does he see in her? You can't mean that they actually..."" The secretary knowingly nods and the lady flyer exclaims, ""But she's so bourgeois!""

Later Hitler throws a small birthday party for the inner circle. As party favors, he hands out little boxes of cyanide capsules. The group begins to fantasize about their impending suicide. The lady flyer says that she and her flyer lover plan to soar over enemy lines & release a hand grenade between the two as they engage in their last embrace. All the guests Woo! & Aah! in approval. The Cook says that she plans to stick her head in the oven. One of the guests says, ""But, Frau Cook, the kitchen is all electric."" The Cook replies, ""Then I'll electrocute myself!""

Diane Cilento turns in an excellent performance as Hitler's long time mistress. She is pretty, fun-loving, loyal, sympathetic--and rather vaporous. While Hitler withdraws with a secretary to compose his Last Testament, Eva fulfills her role as hostess by putting on black face make-up & singing ""When You're Smiling"" in an obvious Marlene Dietrich style. In the end she is a pathetic figure who has blithely allowed herself to be used as Hitler's doormat. It's true that he married her before the very end, but the ceremony is grotesque. When she and her brand new husband go into their private room to kill themselves, Hitler starts ranting about how he knew the war was lost in 1943 with the fiasco of Stalingrad. For the first time Eva hesitantly confronts Hitler. ""You knew two years ago...then why did all those people have to die?"" Hitler has his back to her and immediately becomes abusive, screaming about her being nothing more than a stupid woman, a cow, etc. Then he turns to face her--and she's dead.

While the walls are literally falling down all around them, Hitler pedantically muses about everything from vegetarianism to his conviction that Wagnerian opera singers should perform in the nude. It is a maudlin, morose & ridiculous Hitler, but there is menace & malice as well. Actors are often taught that if they play an evil character, they should find at least one good quality to portray. I think Guinness must have had an almost impossible job of trying to do that. His Hitler is a totally self-obsessed, evil buffoon without one iota of insight. I think Alec Guiness really nailed the S.O.B.

3393455,5,B0016LFG38,Hitler the Last Ten Days is based on a book written by a German Captain who was in the bunker at the time.  It is told from his point of view and the majority of the action takes place in the bunker.  It is true to the book and provides great insight to the figures who visited Hitler in the last few days of the war.  I had it on VHS and upgraded to the DVD.,1220659200,2,359,3.6973684210526314

3393457,5,B0016LFG38,"At long last, this 1973 British-Italian production has come out on DVD.  I found it well done, although a bit unusual. The director seems to have wanted Hitler's Germany to appear in an ironic way, showing Nazi pomp and circumstance one minute and Germany's devastation and starvation the next.  The film moves in and out of these moods and from black-and-white to color.  Some reviewers have found this strange if not humorous.  I believe it's meant to be ironic and to mock the ridiculous theories of the Third Reich.

""Hitler's Last Ten Days"" tells an important story not only from an historical standpoint but also to help in understanding today's world.  Moreover, the movie follows the facts pretty well, with an occasional lapse of literary license.  In an insightful scene, Hitler declares that SS Gen. Fegelein, who had married Eva Braun's sister Gretl, was guilty of treason in the last few days of the Third Reich.  Hitler rightly saw that Fegelein was in league with his boss, SS Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmler, to present Hitler's corpse to the Allies as a peace offering.  In contrast, Hitler is shown cursing out his new wife Eva at the end of the movie for betraying him by committing suicide before he did.  That was a sheer invention of the screenwriters.  Nevertheless, I'm giving the movie five stars for its fine acting and overall impact.

It's difficult to compare ""Hitler's Last Ten Days"" to other productions covering the end of Hitler and his Third Reich.  These are all done in a straight, serious vein and include a made-for-TV piece, ""The Death of Adolph Hitler,"" from the BBC, 1973, starring Frank Finlay as Hitler.  Also, there is 1981's ""The Bunker"" with Anthony Hopkins as Hitler--another TV drama done for HBO.  Finally, we have the very theatrical and gloomy German production, ""Downfall,"" with Bruno Ganz playing the Nazi dictator, 2005.  While all these all have their moments, I think the one with Alec Guinness is the best.  This is for its wit, irony, and above all, Sir Alec's performance.  His is the best Hitler rendering I've seen to date, with Derek Jacobi a close second in the TV miniseries, ""Inside the Third Reich,"" 1982.

To be a bit critical of ""Hitler's Last Ten Days,"" Simon Ward plays a fictional Nazi soldier who starts out as a hero-worshipper but later becomes disenchanted with Hitler's ways.  Though entrusted with a copy of the dictator's political testament at the end he tears up the document once he escapes from the bunker and is never seen again.  Also odd is the fact that no one plays Albert Speer in ""Hitler's Last Ten Days,"" despite Guinness's Hitler saying he was, ""a genius."" Moreover, Speer did play a key role in Hitler's end game, as most authors and historians will agree.

It must be pointed out that ""Hitler's Last Ten Days"" has not been digitally remastered, as would help its audio and video quality.  Also, casting is surprising in places with Italian actors playing Germans.  But that may be nit-picking since they all do a decent job.  Finally, there are no special features or subtitles with the new DVD, which is unfortunate.  The price of the DVD is modest so we may have to wait further for a collector's edition.

To make up for the lack of special features in ""Hitler's Last Ten Days,"" viewers might wish to acquire the documentary DVD, ""Death in the Bunker.""  It was produced in 2005, by Spiegel TV of Germany.  This is an excellent production and carries interviews with several eye witnesses.  These include Traudl Junge, one of Hitler's secretaries, Rochus Misch, the telephone switchboard operator and SS bodyguard, and even Dr. Schenk, one of Hitler's attending physicians.  There are a number of other good testimonials, too.  It's apparent that several wartime films were remastered and blended into the DVD.  Other clips are left as they were which may be disappointing but perhaps are meant to stand out in contrast.

In summing up, ""Hitler's Last Ten Days"" is an important and valuable production. The portrayal of Hitler by Alec Guinness is first-rate, if not somewhat mocking to the dictator's depleted emotional state.  I'd strongly recommend that others interested in Hitler and World War II add this DVD to their library.  Now to complete the picture we need a DVD of Marvin Chomsky's ""Inside the Third Reich.""  Despite the literary license it takes, ""Inside the Third Reich,"" with its all-star cast, deserves to be remastered on DVD and made available to the viewing public.",1214092800,30,4478,4.875661375661376

And it also gives good representation of the dawning realization of the rest of the bunker occupants that Hitler had lost everything - Germany and his mind.",1467504000,,649,4.794642857142857

There is also a film with anthony hopkins called the bunker which is also excellent.  However as much as I like richard baseheart , his movie on hitler from the 60's was not very factual.  This one is. And so are the other two that are named here.  Alec guiness is a fine hitler in this movie and the film looks great on blu ray too.  It's the story of a deluded psycho tyrant as he comes to realize finally that he has lost the war.  And that's a hard thing for him considering he almost won it at one point.

3393473,4,B0016LFG38,"I have often felt this was an underappreciated film. This British Italian film has a wonderful cast of actors. An exploration of Adolf Hitlers last ten days inside the Furhur Bunker in Nazi Germany. The movie is something that captures great acting, flawless cinematography, and is directed in a wonderful, stand out way. This film is memorable, and is something to return to often.

Olive Films gave a wonderful outlet for this film. A Blu-ray fits this film perfectly. A worthy product to enjoy and speak highly of. Olive Films has allowed this older film to be enjoyed on this new outlet. Another great example of Olive Films choice of sometimes forgotten, or overlooked cinema.

This is a Blu-ray product that I think should be owned and enjoyed. Olive Films like always, gives a great Blu-ray product to a film that should be watched.

This stars an ensemble cast of brilliant actors. First and foremost is the one and only genius actor, Alec Guinness in the main role of Adolf Hitler. Guinness is one of those actors that was able to bring an emotional reality toward the viewer. He was able to create his characters in a living, breathing reality, and the character of Adolf Hitler is no different. His performance of Adolf Hitler is one of those memorable performances that create the human side to one of the most brutal monsters in all of history. Guinness owned the part and crafted an excellent, emotional performance that stands out.

Next I have to mention Simon Ward. Ward is another brilliant example of a flawless performer in films. That is something that makes this film stand out, is the whole cast. The beautiful and extraordinary Doris Kunstmann as Hitlers girlfriend Eva Braun. Also starring Adolfo Celi, Joss Ackland, Philip Stone, Diane Cilento, Sheila Gish, Gabriele Ferzetti, and Eric Porter. Each performer play off each other with utterly wonderful chemistry. Doris Kunstmann and Alex Guinness are flawless together as two characters in history that are displayed in this film with a high quality of believability.

Another example of this film is the music displayed and performed by Mischa Spoliansky. Spoliansky was an amazing Russian born music composer that left the world with a great, vast brilliance, and love of music. Hitler The Last Ten Days was his final film that he composed for. He had composed and worked on many upon many films and TV projects in his life. He passed away in 1985 but left an amazing range of music which can be heard throughout Hitler The Last Ten Days. His music is still used today and most recently for the film soundtrack of Woody Allens Magic in the Moonlight (2014).

This movie is based on the book written by Gerhardt Boldt. Boldt was a Nazi who was there in the Bunker in the last ten days. The book was titled Hitlers Last Days: An Eye-Witness Account. Being stationed in Adolf Hitlers Fuhrerbunker, Boldt was able to attend daily briefings with Hitler, and top Nazis. He was able to observe and be placed in a pivotal reality in history. He saw the workings first hand of top Nazis such as Martin Bormann, Herman Goring, Joseph Goebbels and the monster himself, Adolf Hitler.  His book is an extraordinary journey that firsthand knowledge captured. If you get a chance seek out the book and read it. This movie captures in great detail the inner workings, destruction, and failure of Nazi Germany in the last days, and moments of World War 2. Boldt is played by actor Kenneth Colley in Hitler The Last Ten Days. Colley is probably most remembered for playing the character Admiral Piett in Star Wars Empire Strikes Back, and Star Wars Return of the Jedi. Colley is so much more than that, he is a flawless actor who captured many wonderful examples of characters throughout his vast career. He was a stable as a character actor in many films and TV.

This is directed by the Academy Award winning screenplay writer, Ennio de Concini. Concini was a powerhouse in the Italian film world. Interesting is that he only directed 3 films, and Hitler The Last Ten Days was one of those films. His main focus was writing screenplays for film and TV. He had a vast career starting in the 1940s and went all the way up until the late 90s. I will always know him from writing the screenplay to one of the great horror films of all time, 1960s Black Sunday. He also wrote the screenplay for one of my favorite directors of all time, Lucio Fulcis 1975 western, Four of the Apocalypse. What is also interesting to note about Concini is he had a lot of misses in his screenplay writing. Yes he was an Academy Award Winning Screenplay writer, but he also created films of lessor value and quality. A lot of cheesy, low budget films such as Assignment: Outer Space, and Colossus and the Amazon Queen, amongst many others. Now as I have mentioned he was a talented screenplay writer that did win an award for his writing of the screenplay, for the amazing film 1961s Divorce Italian Style. This is a great extraordinary film and deserves all the accolades it gets. Concini directed Hitler The Last Ten Days as a film to be remembered. He directed a tight structured film with amazing performers.

Overall:

Olive Films did another great choice of film to bring out. I am a huge World War 2 buff and being able to see this, and own this is a great reality. Olive Films always picks great films for Blu-ray, and Hitler The Last Ten Days is no different.",1448409600,2,5559,4.700924974306269

This is evidentially a factual account, having come from an eye witness during those last days in the Fuehrerbunker.

The film clearly shows Herr Obnoxious in a last-ditch mental effort to convince all those around him that victory still lay ahead, unwilling to admit for a second that his empire was on its last legs.  The usual accusations of betrayal were cast about with abandon.

Guinness had to play the role of a madman growing even more insane scene-by-scene.  He handled it magnificently, and I'd say there weren't many other who'd have done equally well.

This film is a fitting addition to any movie-lover's library, not only for a poignant story, but also a brilliant acting job in the lead role.",1379808000,2,898,4.953333333333333

3393500,4,B0016LFG38,"I remember seeing this when it first came out in 1973. Alex Guinness was superb in the role. I know there is a more recent depiction of the film, but this is still my favorite.

The most perplexing and well depicted mood of the film, is how his inner circle was still 100% devoted to their Fuehrer as the Russians systematically dismembered Berlin. Absolute insanity. What were these people afraid of? I enjoyed the way the few surviving OKW officers refused to take blame for the failures on the front or even confront Hitler with the painful truth that the Third Reich was in its death throes. I don't care what psychiatrists, psychologists or sociologists write or say, there is no sane explanation for the the undying devotion these people showed for a mad man.

I found the performances given very enticing and enjoyable. Everyone of the actors and actresses portrayed the senseless devotion to a man who was responsible for the deaths of over forty million people in six short years. And I personally enjoyed the the fade-ins of past glories as Hitler relives his greatest triumphant moments.

It pales me that so many people are critical of this work.

3393507,1,B0016LFG38,"Hoo boy ,where to start.
This film is so full of problems that its easier to list the few good things about it than the overwhelming problems that it has.

Good- The period uniforms worn by the Nazi princelings in the film are pretty close to the originals. The cinematography is well done,the sound is clear and the ""bunker"" set looks reasonably close to what you would imagine it to be. Beyond that...

The bad- I've always had a problem with British actors playing Germans (and especially high Nazi officers). The accents are bizarre ,the mannerisms are all wrong and the overall feel is that of a (really) low rent production. This movie continues that proud tradition. Sir Alec Guinness plays Adolf Hitler here and he's easily the least believable man to play the character of all the ""major"" productions of this story. ( ""Downfall"" and  ""The Bunker"" are the other two) If you see these movies in some sort of chronological order ,with this one going first ,it doesn't seem so bad. (Indeed , the producers of Downfall seem to have borrowed liberally from this film) Next , watch ""The Bunker"" and you will get a better appreciation of just how hard it is for a producer to make this subject compelling. Finally , watch ""Downfall"" in the original German and you realize that you are viewing the definitive film on the subject, a true masterpiece.

The pacing and narrative of this one are accurate ,but boring,and Guinness alternates between an almost giddy ,silly, gay Hitler and an almost expressionless zombie that really never generates any enthusiasm or rage as his Third Reich is compressed on all sides by his enemies. Indeed ,at times its almost as if Guinness is staring at the other actors speaking their parts as if he is in a trance that is only broken when he has to say some more of his poorly written and implausibly delivered lines. This we know : Hitler was NOT calm , collected and in good humor over the last ten days of his life. At times this movie makes you wonder if Guinness is about to burst into a song (and dance) as he smiles and chuckles and tells little anecdotes to his cardboard cutout supporting cast. He plays other scenes as if he swallowed a quart of Robitussin before the cameras rolled.

Hitlers love interest Eva Braun is played by Doris Kunstmann . Horribly miscast ,she probably didn't put this movie on her resume as she forged a nearly 4 decade career in cinema. In this effort , she appears almost child like and wayyyyyyy too young ( Eva Braun was 33 when she died, Kunstmann was 29 when this film was made and looks about 19) for Guinness (as Hitler) . Her wardrobe for this role looks like she borrowed a few loose odds and ends from a soft core porn production in a nearby studio. Her song and dance number (in blackface !) is not to be missed.

Other casting and narrative gaffes abound. Aviatrix Hanna Reitch is played by  Diane Cilento and she too ,evokes fizzy- soda- pop- nose- burning laughter for her portrayal of one of Hitlers most fanatical and psychotic followers. Cilento looks like she was just sent over from that same soft core film referenced earlier... Her makeup and hair actually produced audible giggles when we viewed this film the first time. Perfectly coiffed with a tailored uniform ,the real Reitch never (ever) looked this good.

Man for all nationalities Adolfo Celi plays General Hans Krebs and its hard to tell if his dialog is dubbed.( It's also hard to tell if the producers knew that he is Sicilian)  Celi has alternately played just about every ethnic group on earth ( Greek , Italian , Spaniard , German ) I half expect to someday see a film where he pulls off a Penguins head and says "" Top o' the marnin' to ya"" in an Irish brogue. ( I wouldn't have been shocked if he had done it in this film) Anyway , he is just lost and as out of place as one man can be. As ridiculous as he appears, at least he got a paycheck from this dung heap.

The rest of the cast is a mixture of non entities and never was'es that leave the whole thing just kind of piled up on the floor begging to be thrown out with the trash. The editing suffers from the quaint Italian custom of quick cuts and non sequitor film noir insertions. All in all ,not easy to watch and even harder to fathom.

Questions and inconsistencies characterize this film. Like , where the heck did Albert Speer disappear to ? History buffs know that Speer played a significant role in the final drama in the bunker ,but he seems to have disappeared down the memory hole in this film. He is not mentioned and no character portrays him here. Odd. Likewise Joeseph Goebbels. The "" Poison Dwarf"" has a mere bit part in this production with just a few lines and almost no screen presence. Perhaps its because the producers wanted to keep Guinness on screen as much as possible to maximize their investment. Hard to say ,but in real life , Goebbels was not a bit player,he was a major part of the regime. Just another pair of minor mysteries that are in keeping with this deeply flawed production.

Summary- IF you can find this film on DVD and IF you can score a copy for a dollar...You will have wasted your dollar. This movie is wretched and unsatisfying. Better to take that dollar and rent Downfall and watch it again than this pile of crap.",1275782400,9,5278,4.486458333333333
