3004445,5,B000XNZ7NO,"Having been a Joan Crawford fan for many, many years, it was great news to hear of the second collection. Having received it, the movies are great but I am not in love with the packaging. The discs come in a fold out design with no cover art. Had I known this, I would have waited to purchase the movies individually when they became available, even at a higher cost. I thought the price was too good to be true! Still, the collection is priced well.

Another thing I was looking forward to viewing was the extras, especially Gable and Crawford and Crawford at Warners. It is interesting that they call it Gable and Crawford? Clark Gable was the KING of hollywood but Joans name in all their movies was always before his, even on Strange Cargo. Promotional materials for the film list Gable first. The packaging on this set also lists Gables name first. Even footage from the period shows this. However, first billing did come up during the filming and the quotes below are from the book, Joan Crawford, The Ultimate Star by Alexander Walker: When Mr. Mayer returned, he had to make one of the most delicate arbitrations. The outcome was fixed satisfyingly, and permanently, on the credits when it opened a month later: ""JOAN CRAWFORD & CLARKE GABLE in Strange Cargo"". Play the disc and see. Although I was annoyed at the appearance of Christina Crawford in Gable and Crawford, she did not say anything negative about her mother.  When WB or TCM comes out with the Crawford/Gable boxed set, it should be appropriatley titled.

The Crawford at Warners feature started out great, then five minutes into the film Christina Crawford appeared and was allowed to speak about her mothers drinking, rage and how she took it out on the kids. I cannot understand why Warner Brothers and TCM movies would allow this content to be included? This is a Joan Crawford collection, not a plug for Mommie Dearest. I hear Christina is planning a Mommie Dearest 30 Year Anniversary book. Enough said.

The packaging did not prevent me from returning the collection. It is a great mix of Joan classics.

3004446,2,B000XNZ7NO,"The 5 films on this box-set are very good and entertaining, however, I am VERY angry at Warner Bros. for not releasing them separately with no original artwork for each title! This means the customer has to pay $50 for the entire set, instead of having the option to purchasing these movies individually! You call that good service to the customer?? Once again, these so-called big studios are leaving the customer with no options.

I find that box sets are cute for the die-hard fans, but I would have preferred to see these movies released separately in their own keep case, the same way Warner did with the first Crawford collection three years ago. Let's hope they don't make the same mistake with future Crawford collection sets!",1202947200,12,734,4.7795275590551185
3004447,3,B000XNZ7NO,Warner Bros usually makes good on most box sets and when we buy them you can usually bet you get each film housed in its own keep case. Not the case in this box set. It is a digipack foldout style case that houses the dvds. So I have to buy each title seperatly to get the cool cover art that each film gets when it is releases on its own. Warner bros should know fans want the good cases. and at 14.99 a film that runs about 75.00! GREAT SET WARNER BROS thanks for bleeding the customer who wants the best possible for the DVD release.,1202083200,12,536,4.018691588785047
3004448,5,B000XNZ7NO,"Joan Crawford was the screen's greatest superstar. She was famous for her beauty, her sizzling affairs, and her fabulous, glamorous lifestyle. She is Hollywood personified, and is a shining symbol of its golden age. Beyond that, she was a questionable mother and an underrated actress. I want to underline the word underrated because, in contrast to her dizzyingly over-the-top, rags-to-riches life story, which is still the stuff of rumor and speculation, her film work is sometimes neglected.

Crawford is often referred to as a great actress, which indeed she is, but never as the greatest actress. That title is often reserved for the likes of Katharine Hepburn or Bette Davis (not that Crawford is far behind in the ranks). Although most film critics and fans respect Crawford, there is often a condescending note to their adulation.

Crawford is, more often than not, described as: ""a star, not an actress."" This is a label, and a misguided one. Crawford's glamour and personality, as well as the subtlety in which she approaches roles, make it too easy to overlook her talent. Because she is not acting in the crafty, mechanical sense: she works on instinct, and reaches the soul of her characters through her own soul.

Crawford had a peerless ability to reach the heart and soul of every character she played. You will see it in those haunting, sad Crawford eyes in every closeup. Those emotions will stay with you because they are not the mere work of an actress--they are real, and come from a very real place--her past.

The vulnerability Crawford projects makes a dynamic contrast to her tough, and sometimes hardened, persona. It is a contrast which is striking--and extremely effective. In each role highlighted in Warner Bros.' second edition Crawford box set, you will see the side of Crawford I have tried to describe in these paragraphs, and why she is a sterling actress with a gift for revealing characters through herself which is unmatched by any other actress of her time, or ours.

SADIE MCKEE (1934). Although your first impression of Crawford in this film may be of her youthful vibrance, keep in mind that by this time in her career Crawford had already been an established star for six years. Her breakthrough role was in the 1928 silent film Our Dancing Daughters, in which she became a star overnight playing a jazz age flapper. By 1934, Crawford had discarded her dancing girl image in favor of playing hard-working girls trying to get by in depression-era America. SADIE MCKEE is the quintessential depression-era, working girl Crawford. She is at all times a vision of art deco splendor, in a film which introduced to us the standard, ""All I Do is Dream of You.""

TORCH SONG (1953). This is a technicolor treat, and a fun piece of fluff which must qualify as style over substance. The screenplay is horrid, the costumes are shocking, and there is a parade of Crawfordisms on display. Forget what I said about subtlety earlier: Crawford throws all of that out of the window here, and plays this tough Broadway star with ferocious bitchery. Of course the Crawford sorcery is as bewitching as ever, as she injects every scene with as much glamour as is humanly possible, but project is so deliriously campy and over-the-top as to diminish any serious artistic risk Crawford may have been taking. The highlight, however, is the song ""Tenderly,"" played throughout.

A WOMAN'S FACE (1941). One of Crawford's touchstone performances. A timeless portrait of a criminal who finds a chance at redemption through a physical transformation which offers spiritual renewal.

STRANGE CARGO (1940). Gable and Crawford bring romantic fireworks to this adventure story of prisoners trying to escape an island. Crawford is again cast as a fallen woman who has reason to reconsider the course her life has taken, with astonishing results.

FLAMINGO ROAD (1949). One of Crawford's most entertaining movies casts her as a carnival girl in love with a respectable politician. His love for her doesn't fit in with his career plans, but we know Crawford is too ambitious to leave it at that!

So there you have it. A timeless collection of films made by a timeless film goddess. You can't afford to not add this set to your collection. It's taken too long to get here.",1201824000,6,4277,4.911357340720222
3004449,5,B000XNZ7NO,"I am extremely pleased that Joan's releases are relatively constant out in the market, especially this year. I know most people complained about Bette Davis vol 2 released so soon and not Joan's but lets remember that Joan still was being released during that time without a new box set: Bette's set included a Joan movie ""Baby Jane"", Gable's set included""Dancing Lady"", Wayne's collection had ""Reunion in France"" and then there was Trog too...  The great thing is that some of her best are here with the new box set: especially A Woman's Face, Flamingo Road, and Strange Cargo. On top of that, a separate release of Daysi Keynon is coming just weeks after that. There might be a Harriet Craig and Today We Live release in 2008.  Now nothing would make me happier if they released a Double-DVD for Johnny Guitar, such a rich film , funny and exciting that just gets better with time. It deserves to be released in the US. I think that maybe they re working on something major for this release and when it comes it will be wonderful. After that, in my opinion the last 2 major Joan releases that fans urgently need to have are: 1. a Joan Crawford Silents collection that includes 5 features:  Our Dancing Daughter (they should do it NOW!!!!!!!!!! while Anita Page is still alive and her mind still intact to do a commentary.  Also included must be:Four Walls, Across to Singapore, West Point, and Our Modern Maidens.
2.  A Classic 1930s MGM Joan release:  1. Dance Fools Dance, 2. Paid,  3. Possesed(31), 4. LETTY LYNTON!!! please yes yes yes, 5. The Shining Hour.

After that, I should be content enough and won't bitch about other releases cause the rest of the movies aren't really outstanding in my opinion, and the ones i ve mentioned pretty much cover every stage of Crawford's career from silents to early talkies, from shop girl to villain, from strong young woman to mature sexy woman, from black and white to color. Lets hope they all come out soon.",1199318400,13,1958,4.638728323699422
3004450,5,B000XNZ7NO,"FINALLY! If you haven't seen A WOMAN'S FACE and STRANGE CARGO, by all means, GET THIS SET! These are two of my all time favorite Crawford films and it's about time we get to have them on DVD! Now all we need is JOHNNY GUITAR! HURRY UP, ALREADY!!!!",1198713600,2,247,4.166666666666667
3004451,4,B000XNZ7NO,"I have been a fan of joans for a few years, and I have 28 of her movies. I was dissapointed and felt cheated like all of you at the box set format. But I got used to it. At least they were generous with the number of beautiful images all over and inside the set. Now,on to the films...

Sadie Mckee(1934) - 5 stars

As mentioned many times,this is a love triangle melodrama typical of 1930's joan, but it has heart and its share of quite serious scenes...
Young Joan is very beautiful, and after being a major star for 6 years,
was quite a good actress already. This movie grew on me like most Joan movies after I paid attention to the more intentionally serious plot points. This movie should really be classified as a tearjearker-weepie,although it definetly is still a comedy. There is some priceless dialogue especially from Joans friend/neighbor/would be bridesmaid as well
as the Mae West impersonator(You will see what I mean). It has some beautiful music and Joan has a drunk scene where she is SUPERB!... Incidently, this film is the one Blanche Hudson watches early on  in ""Baby Jane""

Strange Cargo(1940) - 4 stars

After ""The Women"" proved to be the 2nd highest grossing movie of 1939, Joan was somewhat initially more successfull at getting the front office to get her better roles. As mentioned, the movie starts slow,there are some over long scenes and the plot is impossible to follow and has too much inneuendo and subtext sometimes. The movie flows at a faster pace  when Joan is on screen and is worth it to see the whole film to observe the journey the characters make and see Joan brave the jungle wildlife with Clark Gable:)

 A Woman's Face(1941) - 5 stars
This movie is awesome! She gives a BETTER performance than in ""Mildred Pierce"" (although she is really good there). She is excellent as Anna Holm, a physically disfigured and embitted con-asrtist/extortionist. This movie has many ""NOIR"" qualities;the lighting,the flashbacks, unlikable character(s)the potentiol for tragedy near the end. As noted in the ""MIldred Pierce"" documentary,you can just tell Joan has been starved for a role this juicy and she is taking full advantage of it! For the first time ever, you really get the feeling she is an actress,not a movie star. This movies also boasts some first rate character actors( as do all the movies here, even ""Torch Song""), beautiful costumes,music directing.(although to be fair,this movie does not flow smoothly all the time either ).In the suspensful third act scenes Joan really has to depend on the emoting and pantomiming she developed during her silent days and proved herself still excellent at almost 10 years later in the excellent ""Sudden Fear"".This part of the movie is so good, it almost reminds you of Hitchcock film. The scene where Joan is playing the piano and unviels one of the most beautiful laughs in movie history should be a special treat ...

Flamingo Road(1949) - 4 stars

This movie is a B movie,but a fun one. Joan plays one of her tough girl from the wrong of the tracks roles. She is way too old for the part of
world-weary carnival girl,but she doesnt care, so why should we?As noted in the ""Joan at Warners"" featurette, she is very very good at being hard and cheap. Sydney Greenstreet plays her enemy and they DO have great chemistry together! He played bad guys in other Warners classics ""The Maltese  Falcon"" and ""Casablanca"" and he appropriatly scary/creepy/gross for the part. The scene where Joan doubleslaps him is classic as is the their final showdown. Great,but bordering on campy Fun.

and Torch Song(1953)- 3 stars

This is ABSOLUTELY a B movie, but still alot of fun as well. I won't give anything away of course, but Joan is Jenny Stewart, a broadway star and the biggest bitch that ever lived! She, like the queen in ""Alice in Wonderland"" always just wants things HER way. Right into the very first seconds ,Torch Song sets the tone for the narcissism that is JOAN! There aren't ALOT of great things about this movie,but Joans dialogue is FIERCE(when is it not?the line with the dog is CLASSIC),she dances decently,the technicolor(s) are pretty,and the furniture in Joans bedroom is very interesting, and the lady playing Joans mom is a great actress(Marjorie Rambeau).Lets be fair, Joan DOES overact here to the point of turning it into the drag queen convention it has become today. With her bright orange hair,huge mouth and eyebrows,Joan is rather terrifying. The ""two-faced woman"" musical number has already gone down as extremely bizzare .Well worth watching for a well intended campfest.............You may recognize her assistant,Anne(played by Madie Norman) as the maid Elvira in ""Baby Jane""

For a great,GREAT GREAT overview of joan films go to [..]",1195862400,,4739,4.841779975278121
3004452,5,B000XNZ7NO,"These are the Films of the first true Movie-Star, Miss Joan Crawford. I cannot wait for this DVD set, because it will include some of Joan's best movies!! And, the movies in this boxed set include Joan at her most stunning! ""Sadie McKee"" is absolutely my favorite movie, ever. Joan looks so beautiful in this 1934 MGM classic. I first saw this movie 5 years ago when TCM did a month-long Joan Crawford marathon; this was the first movie I ever saw with Miss Crawford and since then I became a huge fan and completely fell in love with this kind, beautiful and very talented actress! I also absolutely adore ""Strange Cargo."" This is one of Joan's best pictures with her number-one leading man, Clark Gable; and as far as I'm aware it is the only movie she ever made with Mr. Gable where she took second billing! After you view these movies you will see why Miss Crawford was the hardest working woman in Hollywood!

Isn't the picture on the cover of this set really beautiful! Below is a list of each movie included in this set, all movies are shown in pan and scan except for ""Torch Song"" which is in widescreen. (Scroll down, to see a list of each one of the special features included, as well)

Brief Synopsis:

What Miss Crawford had to say about this movie: Everything about ""Sadie McKee"" was right - Gene Raymond, Franchot Tone, the script, Clarence Brown's direction, Adrian's customs, the works.

Brief Synopsis:
Devil's Island escapees are changed forever by a prisoner who thinks he's Jesus.
What Miss Crawford said about her last picture with Clark Gable: Two absolutely wonderful films and so different (also discussing ""Susan and God"") It's a shame I couldn't have retired right then, and come back to do ""Mildred Pierce."" Clark and I did our best work together in ""Strange Cargo."" We had always been close, sometimes too close, but now we knew each other as mature persons and the chemistry was still there and it added to the fire.

(Joan played: Anna Holm aka Ingrid Paulson)
Brief Synopsis:
Plastic surgery gives a scarred female criminal a new outlook on life.
This is what Miss Crawford says about this picture: I have nothing but the best to say for ""A Woman's Face."" It was a splendid script and George(George Cukor, the director) let me run with it. I finally shocked both the critics and the public into realizing the fact that I was, at heart, a dramatic actress. Great thanks to Melvyn Douglas; I think he is one of the least-appreciated actors the screen has ever used.

Brief Synopsis:
A stranded carnival dancer takes on a corrupt political boss when she marries.
Here are Miss Crawford's comments on this film: ...This script missed, Curtiz (the director) missed, I missed. I just didn't jell, that's all, and it's another time  when my judgment screwed up completely, because we were shooting it I thought it would be good.

(Joan played: Jenny Stewart)
Brief Synopsis:
Musical comedy legend Jenny Stewart, who has been hardened by the worst life has to offer, finds romance when blinded war-veteran Tye Graham becomes her new piano accompanist.
Miss Crawford's comments on this movie: ...Back at Metro, after all those years... it was like a homecoming, and half the people on the set, the prop men and the grips.... they remembered me and I remembered  them. I loved doing that film. It gave me a chance to dance again, to pretend to sing, to emote all over the place and in color yet! (Note: This is Miss Crawford's first staring role in a major motion picture that is entirely in color!) If I hadn't brought it off I'd only have myself to blame because all the elements were there.

This boxed set also includes a lot of special features, many of which I enjoyed very much. I especially got a kick out of Joan's ""Torch Song"" recording sessions! And, I enjoyed Joan's rendition of ""Flamingo Road"" very much because this is one of her first radio performances that I have heard and it also included a brief interview afterwards!

Why was Miss Crawford such a fascinating and unconventional star...?

Miss Crawford was a first-rate star, who worked her a-s-s off to get to where she was! And, do you know what she did once she got there? She worked 10 times harder...! Joan had the longest and most impressive film career of any star during Tinseltown's famed Golden Age of Cinema! Joan's career lasted 5 decades! And her career proved to be more loyal to her than any lover or husband! Miss Crawford was always known for her fashion-sense, classical beauty and the ability to constantly re-invent herself (half a century before the Material Girl was a household name!)

Joan Crawford started her career in 1925 as a flapper, playing in bit parts as a contract-player for the most glorious studio in town, MGM. She was nothing more than a glorified prop, unbilled in her first film, ""Lady of the Night."" Soon, Joan was promoted to leading-lady, appearing in such critically-acclaimed pictures as, Harry Langdon's Tramp Tramp Tramp, and Lon Chaney's The Unknown. But it wasn't until Joan accepted the role of Diana Medford, in Our Dancing Daughters that she became a bona fide star! By the end of the decade Joan had more than 20 pictures under her belt!

In the 30's when many silent stars were bowing out gracefully, Joan was back with a vengeance! This time Joan was the little shop girl that Depression-Era American ladies (and maybe even some boys, too) could really identify with. Miss Crawford could be seen acting in such famed movies as, ""Letty Lynton,"" Rain, Grand Hotel, and one of my personal favorites, Forsaking All Others (1934). Some of the 25 classics that Joan also made during the 30's include: Dancing Lady, Laughing Sinners, Dance, Fools, Dance (Forbidden Hollywood), Chained, ""No More Ladies,"" Gorgeous Hussy, Love on the Run (1936), The Bride Wore Red, Mannequin (1938) and of course one of her most popular ever, The Women !

""No more goddamn shop girls,"" Joan was once quoted as saying to MGM chief-honcho, Louis B. Mayer. In the 40's Joan yet again came back in another one of her many incarnations, this time as the society matron in such movies as, When Ladies Meet , Reunion in France and Above Suspicion (1943). In 1942 Miss Crawford donated her entire salary from Columbia's They All Kissed the Bride to the war-effort and then she turned around and fired her agent when he didn't do the same! After 18 years of being a member of the MGM family, Miss Crawford took a huge gamble and decided to branch out, this time working for the actor's studio, Warners. Joan's first film for Warners, was her most famous movie, and it garnered her the Oscar for Best Actress; playing the title role in her defining-film, Mildred Pierce . Joan also made a slew other first-rate pictures during this period, such as: Humoresque and Daisy Kenyon . Moving to Warners really paid off for Miss Crawford, because she also received her second Academy Award nomination for Possessed, playing the harried Louise Howell! Of course, Miss Crawford had all the time in the world for our servicemen. Joan was often seen at the Hollywood Canteen entertaining our boys; ...how many of today's movie stars get off their pedestals to do this?

The 50's marked a very pivotal time in Joan's illustrious career. Because in the next chapter of her picture resume, she played the determined and strong matriarch in many wonderful dramatic cinematic masterpieces. Such as, Harriet Craig, Queen Bee, ""Female on the Beach,"" The Damned Don't Cry, ""Goodbye My Fancy,"" Story of Esther Costello and Autumn Leaves. Miss Crawford also received her third Academy Award nomination playing Myra Hudson in RKO's Sudden Fear. And never one to be typecast, Joan made a big splash in Johnny Guitar, portraying a tough saloon owner in the wild-west! Also beginning in the 50's, Joan took up the campaign as official spokeswoman for Pepsi-Cola; a coveted role that she enjoyed for more than 18 years!

In the 60's Miss Crawford didn't slow down for a second! Nope! She came out swinging. Joan made the whole country ask in droves, What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? . In one of her most well-known pictures ever, Joan played Blanche Hudson, opposite another very talented actress, Ms. Davis, in this gorgeous Warners film! Throughout all the 60's Joan was known as the ""Scream Queen."" She stared in such cult-favorites as, Strait-Jacket, Della, I Saw What You Did and Berserk!! It was also around this time, that Miss Crawford penned her autobiography, A Portrait of Joan Crawford.

Even in semi-retirement, Miss Crawford still always kept busy during the 1970's. This time she was the Hollywood Legend, and everyone knew it! When the movie studios weren't knocking on her door, she switched to television. In one of her last television appearances, Miss Crawford played the part of Joan Fairchild in ABC's ""The Sixth Sense: Dear Joan: We're Going to Scare You to Death."" She also wrote her second book, the best-selling My Way of Life. And, Joan always found the time for some of her favorite charities; donating her talent and time to The Muscular Dystrophy Association and The American Cancer Society. Of course, Joan also made time to speak to her good friend and journalist Roy Newquist. Mr. Newquist was actually the only journalist that Miss Crawford chose to speak to during the late 70's, and his thoughtful (and unprecedented) interviews with Joan were published in the 1980 book, Conversations with Joan Crawford.

Miss Crawford perished a second time when the majority of the public threw her away and vilified her as a lunatic. But this death was much more painful. Because not only were Joan's films forgotten, but all of the good she did during her lifetime was also completely erased! The true Joan Crawford was kind, compassionate and generous to a fault. Joan was a self-made lady who worked for everything she got. She just wanted to keep her head above water in a man's world where women didn't have a voice or a choice. Miss Crawford never for a second forgot where she came from or who she was, and she never for a moment let her beloved fans down! All Joan wanted was for someone to give her a chance and believe in her. I really am so glad that this set is coming out because maybe now the public can see the real Joan Crawford and remember her as she truly was!",1194566400,119,16666,5.398230088495575
3004453,4,B000XNZ7NO,"I'm excited to own this set in February.  I saw ""A Woman's Face"" on TV years ago and thought it was really good.  I've seen ""Flamingo Road"" several times.  I've been hosting a series of classic film screenings at my place for more than a year.  Two of these events have included double features of Crawford and Bette Davis films.  I'll be pairing the five new Crawford DVDs with Davis films eventually.  I just hope the Davis set expected from WB in '08 is good.  With ""All This, and Heaven Too"", as has been rumored, it should be!  WB should consider a set of Crawford and Gable films!

3004454,5,B000XNZ7NO,"This is the long awaited second volume of the Joan Crawford Collection. Joan had a very long career in films spanning from the silent era and MGM into the 1970's. She was one of the few actresses to successfully make the transition from silents to sound, and this set gives you a sampling of her roles from 1934 to 1953. The following are the five films in this set and their extra features:

Sadie McKee (1934)
One of the last precodes, this film is a melodrama that has Joan Crawford playing a totally virtuous character throughout. She's a maid who is fired for telling off the head of the household (Franchot Tone). Next, her boyfriend deserts her for a chorus girl. She ends up marrying an alcoholic millionaire strictly as a matter of survival, but she does help her husband cure himself of his alcoholism. Afterwards she asks for a divorce so she can go look for her old boyfriend, who is now alone and quite ill. This movie introduced the song ""All I Do is Dream of You"" by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown.

Strange Cargo (1940)
Andre (Clark Gable) is a convict in a French penal colony in South America. The first time he tries to escape saloon girl Julie (Joan Crawford) turns him in. His second attempt is successful, and this time he throws in his lot with several other escapees, one of which seems to always know what is about to happen, and is even able to draw accurate maps of escape routes. During this escape Andre runs into Julie again. At the conclusion of the escape Andre realizes the reason for the one prisoner's extraordinary abilities and has a change of heart. A very strange film and a strange role for Crawford, although I found it intriguing. Directed by Frank Borzage who is noted for his love stories involving crime, loss, and redemption.

A Woman's Face (1941)
One of Joan Crawford's best performances as a woman whose scarred face embitters her and leads her into a life of crime until a surgeon (Melvin Douglas) decides to operate and remove her outer scars. However, her inner scars remain and she finds it hard to change even with the help of the good doctor. This film initially failed at the box office, but was recognized as a classic years later.

Lane Bellamy (Joan Crawford) is a dancer touring with a carnival who falls in love with Fielding Carlisle. However, a marriage to a carnival dancer is not what Fielding's political handler, Titus Semple, considers a suitable move for his protege. Thus he has Lane framed and sent to jail and arranges a loveless marriage for Fielding with a girl more appropriate for the future he has planned for him. Once out of jail, Lane falls in love with and marries another prominent person, but their future together is threatened when Fielding comes to call. Directed by Michael Curtiz.

Torch Song (1953)
This was Joan Crawford's return vehicle to MGM after having left ten years earlier, and is the weakest of the films in the bunch, but that doesn't mean it's bad. Instead it is great fun because it is such a camp classic. Too bad there's no commentary, because I would really like to know what went on behind the scenes in this one. It has everything - Technicolor, an over-the-top wardrobe for Joan, and of course there's Joan as a steamroller of a woman that no man can stand up to except a British pianist, blinded in WWII. And then there are the musical numbers - well, you'll have to see it for yourself.

3004467,5,B000XNZ7NO,"Just a quick review of this set, since so many other reviewers have done a good job of describing it.  Time to put my two cents in...

The Joan Crawford Collection, Vol. 2 (2008) contains five Crawford classics.  They are:

Sadie McKee (1934)
Strange Cargo (1940)
A Woman's Face (1941)
Flamingo Road (1949)
Torch Song (1953)

This set will provide a wide variety of Crawford roles and movies.  These movies are from the Golden Age of Hollywood and star the symbol of Hollywood's Golden Age, Joan Crawford.  All are gems, but my favorites are A Woman's Face (1941) and Sadie McKee (1934).  In fact, I'll do my own rating of these movies:

Sadie McKee  - 5 stars
Strange Cargo - 5 stars
A Woman's Face - 5 stars
Flamingo Road - 4 stars
Torch Song - 3 stars

Strange Cargo was the eight and last time Crawford and Clark Gable starred in a movie together and has Crawford in an unglamorous, tougher role where she's even getting dirty.  The Alfred Hitchcock movie Lifeboat (1944) reminds me of certain parts of Strange Cargo.

A Woman's Face is a cool movie.  I've seen the original Swedish version from 1938 starring Ingrid Bergman, which was good, but I like this 1941 remake starring Joan Crawford and Melvyn Douglas even better.  Crawford plays a woman who was physically scarred as a child and takes up a life of crime as an adult.  Some corrective surgery changes everything.  Crawford's disfigured face is quite unsettling, which makes her have kind of a scary look.  This movie is quite dark and shadowy as well, kind of like a film noir movie.  Crawford was unglamorous in this movie, which audiences at the time weren't expecting and ultimately disliked.  Her acting is superb.  In fact, she should have been nominated for an Academy Award, but wasn't due to the movie's failure at the box office.  Time has been kind to this movie, however, and it is now seen as a classic, and Crawford's performance is now receiving the praise and appreciation that was missing in 1941.  For me personally, Crawford's best performances are (in no particular order) Possessed (1947), Sudden Fear (1952), Humoresque (1946), Mildred Pierce (1945), A Woman's Face (1941), Rain (1932), Paid (1930), Chained (1934), Sadie McKee (1934), and The Women (1939).

It was always said that Joan was a star and not an actress.  How wrong they are.  This set highlights Crawford's acting skills which were formidable.  Even when one of her movies does not quite live up to your expectations, Joan never disappoints.  She put everything she had into every role she undertook and you cannot help but be impressed by such a talented actress.

3004484,5,B000XNZ7NO,"After nearly 2 years since the last Joan Crawford boxset came out, comes this wonderful collection of Joan's films, which will more than satisfy those ardent Crawford fans, as well as the ordinary novie buff. In this set we get 5 classic Joan films; ""A Woman's Face"", ""Sadie McKee"", ""Strange Cargo"", ""Flamingo Road"", and my favorite ""Torch Song"". All the films come in full screen format, as that's the way they were filmed, except ""Torch Song"", which is in a beautiful widescreen edition. We get a good glimpse into the kind of actress Crawford was in these films. In  ""A Woman's Face"", Joan should have received an Oscar for her role, as most critics agree her performance of a woman disfigured is one of her best. In ""Strange Cargo"" Joan is reunited with her former lover and co-star Clark Gable, and it's one of their best films together. I also love ""Flamingo Road"", where she plays Lane, a carnival girl trying to improve her status as a reputable lady in a small southern town. This film served as the basis for the TV primetime soap of the same name in the 1980's starring Morgan Fairchild. ""Sadie McKee"" is another one of Joan's early MGM films where she crosses the side of the tracks and becomes a society woman. Scenes from this film are also used in ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?""; they are in scenes where Joan's character, Blanche, is watching herself on television at the beginning of the film. Finally, ""Torch Song"" is campy as hell, and Joan pulls off being a fantastic bitch. She plays Jenny, a Broadway star with a heart made of metal, but she finally changes when she meets a blind pianist and she falls passionately in love. The film is also in color. This is also one of Crawford's favorite movies that she ever appeared in; as she said, ""...it was a field day for actess, especially one that reached a certain age...I had the chance to act, dance, and pretend to sing""( as her voice was overdubbed).
 This is a splendid boxset at a great price. So far the only was to own any of these films is by purchasing the boxset, as the films themselves are not sold individually. The packaging is beautiful too; it opens up like a book with the 5 films impacted neatly in their jewel cases. The plastic that holds the DVD's are extemely strong, so we shouldn't have any problems with the dics becoming dislogged and scratched. Hopefully more Crawford boxsets will become available in the future too. If you haven't already bought the first Crawford boxset please buy it; it too covers a large area of Crawford's work, and it features her best movie, ""Mildred Pierce"", which won her the Oscar. Those 5 movies in that boxset are in their own individual cases.",1237766400,,2675,4.60587002096436
3004485,5,B000XNZ7NO,"All of the films are very entertaining, Flamingo Road could almost singularly define 'potboiler' and Crawford's at her best, if a bit ridiculous early-on as a 50-ish carnival 'dancing girl', i guess that was the point.  She's terrific in the film once you get beyond the first few minutes.
And the price!  At this writing (11/21/08) it is DEEPLY discounted at 52% off list- i paid way more than that last year, and it was worth it.  Anyone reading, SNAP THIS UP at 23 bucks! Christmas stocking stuffer for the classic film enthusiastic, female impersonator or great-grandmother on your shopping list.  And at this price, buy one for yourself- Very nicely packaged, good extras- it's been out for a year, so read the earlier reviews for all of the details ( i was most partial, again, to Flamingo Road, Strange Cargo and Torch Song, but as in all things, its only a subjective opinion), and to be less glib, i meant no disrespect to female impersonators or great-grandmothers.

Slo tengo ciertos reparos acerca del formato del box set, que es un poco engorroso de manipular, comparado con el box set N1 de Joan, con cajas independientes. Otra cosa es la ausencia de subttulos en espaol o francs; pienso que se le habra dado una difusin ms amplia y dado ms categora a los discos. Tambin pienso que le sobran unos cortos animados, que nada tienen que ver con la Crawford, existiendo tanto material visual indito sobre ella. An as lo importante es el contenido, que no obstante representa una muy buena seleccin de films y un trabajo de restauracin impecable. Particularmente mi favorita fue ""Torch Song"": una explosin de color y estilo, sumado a unos temas musicales hermosos. Categora aparte es el nmero musical de ""Two faced woman"", la performance ms freak de la historia del cine!.
Es de esperar que salgan a la venta otros sets de DVD de Joan Crawford; siento que los estudios estn en deuda, con cintas como ""Our dancing daughters"", ""Harriet Craig"", ""Susan and God"" o ""Letty Lynton"", adems de haber dejado pasar el aniversario 100 de su nacimiento (punto para Davis!... por ahora).",1215388800,2,1231,4.784037558685446

I won't review each movie in detail, suffice it to say that ""Sadie McKee"" is a classic example of Joan in Shopgirl-To-Socialite mode - not for everyone, particularly not when movies like ""Mildred Pierce"", ""Possessed"" or ""A Woman's Face"" show that Crawford's acting capabilities stretch far and beyond the limitations of Sadie's trite storyline - but is an enjoyable sort of ""Pretty Woman"" prototype nonetheless. ""Strange Cargo"" IS strange - gorgeous performances by Gable and Crawford in an ahead-of-its-time tale of morality and redemption that - dare I say it - doesn't work as well as it could have (again, a laboured and overlong script robs this film of the talents of its two principal stars).

""A Woman's Face"" is a fabulous movie - if you can look past the dodgy makeup effects Joan turns in a stellar performance here, and the plot moves from drama to melodrama to thriller with polished facility, and I am delighted that this is finally out on DVD!! ""Flamingo Road"" is great, too - sure, we can't really believe coiffed, refined Joan as a carney stripper Lane Bellamy, but the film itself is well-made, well-acted and thoroughly enjoyable.

And ""Torch Song"". If you can picture Marlene Dietrich astride a pink unicorn, eating chocolate clairs and blowing soap bubbles from her tiara, while ""Pop Goes The Weasel"" plays in the background, you are still nowhere near picturing the all-conquering campness of this particular motion picture.

And it's fabulous!

The presentation and extras on this set range from the ridiculous (vintage cartoons?!?!) to the sublime (audio recordings of Bette Davis and Ida Lupino in ""A Woman's Face"", Crawford's own vocal stylings for her ultimately dubbed role in ""Torch Song"", and pleasing Crawford & Gable and Jimmy Fund PSA shorts).

This is a very worthwhile purchase for any Crawford fan: what are you waiting for? Thoroughly recommended, and containing great examples of Ye Olde Chick Flick (Sadie McKee), searing dramatic talent (A Woman's Face, Strange Cargo) brilliant direction and storytelling (A Woman's Face, Flamingo Road) and boundless hilarity (Torch Song).

3004491,5,B000XNZ7NO,"I love having this set. It includes some of my favorite Crawford films, so I was very excited when the release date was announced. I ordered it right away, and just received it and again, while I love the films in the set, the box 'set up' really annoys me. The fold out type of case is not what I was expecting. Since I have Volume 1, where all the DVDs are in individual cases with cover art, this is what I was expecting. I really wanted to put all the DVDs together in my media cabinet in alphabetical order, with the hopes that someday all Joan Crawford's films would be available on DVD and I would have a complete shelf of Joan!!!
This may sound petty, but I feel that sometimes the studios are trying to save money by cutting back on the boxed sets yet they don't lower the prices for the consumer. I like to take DVDs with me to watch on a long car trip (no... I am not the driver on these trips!) so the individual cases work best for me- Overall I give this a 5 star rating for the films and for a wonderful actress who is unforgettable, but the box/packaging leaves me flat-",1207094400,16,1086,4.151658767772512

It is really too much seeing her sitting there talking about her ""mother."" I guess Joan really knew what she was talking about when she remembered her and Christopher in her will the way she did.

But you gotta hand it to Joansie...she soldiered on through great suspense (A Woman's Face, Strange Cargo) and parody (Torch Song). It's nice to see Sadie McKee. She's really great as the Florence Nightingale of a rich drunkard in Sadie McKee. I think she works best in Strange Cargo alongside Gable, especially in the scenes on the boat where she's unkempt and with little make-up. It's an enjoyable collection for any Crawford fan.",1205884800,6,696,5.060869565217391

Anyway, Strange Cargo and A Woman's Face are two of Joan's best, she really sinks her teeth into the parts she plays in both films. She really should have been nominated for an Oscar for A Woman's Face. Torch Song is campy, but still entertaining. Flamingo Road is great fun, Sydney Greenstreet and Joan have great chemistry and work very well together. With Sadie McKee we get to see a young and innocent Joan working her way up the ladder in society. A typical role of her early MGM days, but one of the really good ones(along with Possessed '31).

3004496,4,B000XNZ7NO,"The 2 best are ""Saddie McKee"" and ""Strange Cargo"", by Clarence Thomas and Frank Borzage respectively.

Then come ""Flamingo Road"", a very good -though not great- Curtiz classic, and ""Torchsong"", a good -but not very good- semi-musical. The one that is no good at all is Cukor's ""A Woman's Face"", which must be Cukor's worst film ever, or thereabouts.

""Torch Song"" reminds me of Bette Davis's ""All About Eve""; of course not as good, but it's a film where the leading star carries the show all by herself, it's all about the female star. This one in beautiful technicolor.

The picture that lasts in my mind is that of Crawford and Gable together in the rough characters of the adventuresome and spiritually filled film by Borzage; by the way, one of the most plain Christian films I've seen. The Christ-like character though is too stiff. It would be asking too much of the film, considering its time in Hollywood history.

A great bunch of truly American classic movies, with Crawford's signature all over.

3004497,2,B000XNZ7NO,"A good actress in good films it is sad that Crawford made so few good films.  The ones represented here each have their moments but most of them are so bad that they couldn't hold my attention.  First Sadie McKee...Crawford's leading men are so bland that no one cares who she winds up with in the end.  Crawford's acting is artificial (who in the world speaks with a british accent if she was brought up a poor girl as her character in this picture????)  The only thing good about the movie is the song, ""All I Do is Dream of You"".  Second movie:  Strange Cargo:  Perhaps I need to watch this film again.  I've seen it three or four times and I cannot get into it.  It drags along at an exceedingly slow pace and Gable is annoying as all get out in it, even more so than Crawford.  The movie is much too long and the plot is very confusing.  Not even MGMs glossiness can help this one (probably the worst of the lot).  Flamingo Road is pure soap opera trash but Crawford does have her moments in this one.  They are relatively few, though.  This is a film Barbara Stanwyck would have excelled in.  It does manage to keep your attention for the most part thanks to the supporting players (Gladys George, Sydney Greenstreet and Zachary Scott) who manage to make Joan look good.  She's showing her age with this one, though.  ""A Woman's Face"" is the best of the lot here, but again, the plot is contrived and silly.  Crawford does turn in a good performance here and sometimes even great.  THe film was not a box office success.  The last film here, ""Torch Song"" is pure grade B- movie.  It is one of the few films that shows the true persona of Joan Crawford (not the movie star but the human being).  Insecure, selfish, and totally narcissistic.  A bad performance and a bad film that does not stand the test of time well.  The worst part is watching Crawford lip synch to the vocals (provided by India Adams).  Crawford could dance but she couldn't sing.  The set does have some great extras in it (though inexplicably, Christina Crawford is in them!!!!??????  Huh???)  Joan's best movies have already been released on DVD:  They are ""Humoresque"", ""Possessed (1947)"" ""Sudden Fear"" (which contains her all time best performance) and ""The Women"".

3004498,4,B000XNZ7NO,"A fine set offering a good cross section of Joan's career. The only clunker in this set would be Torch Song-a rather clunky, odd musical that could have been left out of this set and replaced with something more fitting. Even Johnny Guitar would have been fun for this set. The extras are again on the weak side but afterall we don't buy DVD's for the extras but for the movies themselves, and these movies look pretty good considering their age. On another note, the presentation for this boxed set is great.",1204156800,3,509,4.543478260869565
3004499,4,B000XNZ7NO,"Those responsible for the choice of films in this Crawford collection must have had their tongues firmly in their cheeks. The set covers 3 films from MGM from 1934 to 1941, one post war melodrama from Warners, then back to MGM for a one off return engagement in 1953. The films parallel a change in Crawford's image as she consistently tried to re-invent herself and eventually ended up a parody. The journey is not necessarily flattering to the star when you view the films in chronological order.

- in 1934, Crawford was at the height of her popularity at MGM and ""Sadie McKee"" is one of her high budget working girl sagas. She overacts most of her scenes but  radiates warmth and was still able to ""connect"" with her co-stars, including future husband Franchot Tone, who is a real drip here and does some really bad acting. The film is well made but Clarence Brown directs at a plod and every scene is drawn out and could be edited without loss of narrative. The pace induces boredom. The plot is pure Mills and Boon and the story strains credibility in every way. The best performance is given by Jean Dixon as a jaded lady. She has some great pre-code zingers which she delivers with aplomb. Esther Ralston does a parody of Mae West which comes over as very mannered. The print is good.
- By 1940, Crawford was an actress with the ambition to take some risks and both ""Strange Cargo"" and ""A Woman's Face"" contain 2 of her best performances, if only because they divert from the standard Crawford formula. Both films are well made with unusual, in fact, incredible stories, great casts, good directors and a degree of suspense. In both, at some point, Crawford is stripped of her glamour, looks great and really tries to act a character. In ""A Woman's Face"", she benefits from George Cukor's detailed direction. Conrad Veidt is particularly sinister and riveting. However, whereas Veidt embodies evil, Crawford only enacts it so her reformation is entirely predictable. The prints of both films are excellent.
- By 1948 in ""Flamingo Road"", she plays a carnival dancer and at 40 plus, she is too old for the part. Her toughness is more than just an act. The film starts well but deteriorates into overwrought melodrama after a series of incredible confrontations. Crawford herself thought that this was a film which did not turn out as well as she expected and thought it could have been due to the editing. Gladys George is the best performer here in her familiar role of a nightclub/brothel owner and Sydney Greenstreet is decadent and convincing. The print is excellent.
- by ""Torch Song"", Crawford's persona was from another planet. While this film may be a camp classic, it is dreadful and Crawford projects a complete zombie in a really horrible musical performance. The disconnect from those around her is complete.

The extras with this set are quite interesting. The short documentary on Gable and Crawford tracks their relationship but without generating the heat the stars did. I was expecting something more gutsy. The one on the Warner's years captures well how Crawford moved towards alcoholism and deep insecurity in her private life, ironically reflected in the generally angry and aggressive women she played at this time. Unlike other reviewers, Christina Crawford's involvement seems logical to me. She watched first hand her mother's transition from woman to zombie and since the set tracks this so well, her comments are relevant and not necessarily negative. For example, she speaks nicely of her mother's deep compassion and kindness to Clark Gable when Carole Lombard died.

The most unusual extra is Crawford's recording session from ""Torch Song"". In each take, Crawford's confidence grows and the result has a sort of masochistic appeal which suits the mood of the film, I suppose. The short documentary on the film is excellent and Janine Basinger is amusing when she offers no explanation for the bizarre musical number ""Two Faced Woman"".

For ""A Woman's Face"", 2 radio performances are included with 2 other major dramatic actresses, Bette Davis and Ida Lupino, in the leading role. Given the limitations of the curtailed radio scripts, it is interesting to compare the 3 interpretations of the role. Davis uses a subtle accent and gives a subdued reading. Lupino spits out her lines and is hysterical, her trademark at this time. Other extras include cartoons and shorts, some good and others indifferent. All of the films contain the original trailers.

For Crawford fans, this set is, of course, compulsory buying. If one of Crawford's silents had been included when she was young and raunchy, the transition would have been complete. As it is, this is a more interesting set to me than Volume 1.",1203811200,3,4732,4.88667496886675

There are some entertaining special features including period trailers, cartoons and clips as well as some interesting expert commentary (although I don't understand why Christina Crawford--whether or not you consider her bias justified and/or honest--continues to be sought after as a pundit).

The extras are pretty forgettable and Neal's commentary is too short. Who wants to hear from Christina? Ick! I think we've all heard enough from her already...""yes we know Joan mistreated her""...

3004502,5,B000XNZ7NO,"At long last, the campest of all Joan Crawford camp classics, ""Torch Song,"" is on DVD!  Only in 1953 -- with the Red Scare, the threat of nuclear annihilation and the growing threat from televsion bewildering studio executives -- could so tone-deaf a concept get green-lighted.  You see, it's an MGM musical with our Joan as a voice-of-brass, heart-of-brass, Helen Lawson-esqe Broadway diva who falls in love with a disabled rehearsal pianist (Michael Wilding.)

Yes, you'll shudder as a chorus boy trips over Joan's outstretched leg during a not-very-complicated dance routine! You'll cringe as Joan belts out the politically incorrect ""Two Faced Woman"" number! And you'll retch as Joan, on a lunch break from rehearsal, stomps into a restaurant and snarls her order at the maitre d': ""Lobster thermidor and black coffee!""

Also included in this set, The Joan Crawford Collection, Vol. 2, is one of Joan's very best performances in ""A Woman's Face,"" a rare employment of her startling beauty as something more than mere eye-candy. Another change of pace film is ""Strange Cargo,"" with Joan as a Sadie Thompson-ish hooker (in fact a much better performance than what she did with the real thing in ""Rain.)

""Sadie McKee"" and ""Flamingo Road"" are more run-of-the-mill films, but they do demonstrate most clearly the differences in face and manner of Joan pre and post ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mildred-Pierce/dp/B0008ENIAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mildred Pierce</a>.""",1203552000,3,1512,5.585152838427947
3004503,4,B000XNZ7NO,"After the powerhouse release of Volume 1, it doesn't take too much to realize that the Volume 2 would be slightly weaker. This set contains the following 5 movies:

1.  Sadie McKee (1934) This one is actually one of my favorites from the set. Joan plays Sadie, a young girl who falls in love with bad boy Tommy Wallace (Gene Raymond). When Sadie's rich employer's son, Michael Alderson (Franchot Tone), badmouths Tommy, Sadie tells him, quits her job, and follows Tommy to NY. As always, Tommy makes some bad choices and strands Sadie for a cheap blond singer, Dolly (Esther Ralston). Sadie makes friends a woman living in the same boarding house, Opal (Jean Dixon), who helps Sadie get a job at a Dance Hall. While working one night, Sadie catches of the eye of an alcoholic millionaire, Jack Brennan (Edward Arnold). Sadie marries him for his money, but soon learns that money doesn't buy happiness. How things resolve with the three men in her life, Jack, Tommy, and Michael, makes for a good film that shows the growth of all its characters. Especially appealing is the performance of Jean Dixon as the heart of gold Opal, who is not as hard as she appears. For a film that is more than 70 years old, it holds up very well, thanks to a good script and solid performances. Extras: A silly Pete Smith short ""Goofy Movies #4"", a two-strip 1934 technicolor short ""Toyland Broadcast"" (which includes caricatures of Bing Crosby, Paul Whiteman, and a somewhat offensive black-face band named ""Sambo""), and the theatrical trailer.

2. Strange Cargo (1940) is strange indeed! The plot: a bunch of convicts from Devil's Island attempt an escape for a second chance at life. One of the convicts, Verne (Clark Gable) happens upon Julie (Crawford), a hardened prostitute, before his attempted escape. Ratted out by a strange stalker, ""Pig"" (Peter Lorre) for talking to Verne, a convict, Julie is also forced off the island. Besides Julie and the convicts, there is a Christ-like man, Cambreau (Ian Hunter) who joins the group and leads each one of the hardened men to redemption before they die. Of course, the last 2 to get redemption are Verne & Julie; whether they will turn on each other and retain their hardened personas will have to be found out by viewing this film. Crawford is fantastic, showing much depth to her characterization of a typical heart-of-gold prostitute who eventually finds redemption. Gable's limited depth as an actor unfortunately shows through with his character given an extremely poor script. However, as in their previous teamings, there is a great deal of chemistry between the 2. Hunter's character of an all-knowing spiritual man seems a little odd in the middle of a somewhat gritty movie, and his final scene with Gable just seems a little too pat. Hunter gives a strong performance in this rather weird role. Of course, Lorre is perfectly creepy as Crawford's stalking admirer. Somewhat enjoyable to watch, but also a little uneven. Extras: The featurette ""Gable & Crawford"" is enjoyable, but doesn't go into a lot of depth. Christina Crawford gives a few details about her mother and Gable, as do film historians. It seems extremely odd that Christina, who denounced her mother 30 years ago, is now being trotted out as an authority on Joan in all the featurettes on this set. The vintage short ""More About Nostradamus"" (1941) is somewhat interesting, and mixes reenactments of the famous man who made so many prophecies about the future and current historical footage. Also included are the theatrical trailer for ""Strange Cargo"" and a vintage short, ""Lonesome Stranger.""

3. ""A Woman's Face"" (1941) After watching this movie, it is difficult to continually hear that Joan Crawford was a star/personality, but not an actress. She gives an excellent performance as Anna Holm, a blackmailer who was facially scarred in a fire as a child, and bears the inner and outer scars as an adult. Most likely, director George Cukor can be given much of the credit for Joan's performance (as in the 1939 classic ""The Women""). Even after her ""new"" face is revealed from plastic surgeries, Joan does not go back to being a classic star persona; she maintains the gestures and facial tics that she had previously. The film is somewhat predictable, but nonetheless enjoyable to watch. Marjorie Main has a nice cameo in this movie as well. Extras include: vintage short ""You Can't Fool A Camera"" (1941) which is somewhat funny today in the era of CGI. It shows the history of motion pictures VERY briefly from Edward Muybridge to the present films currently being shot or in development at MGM. A vintage color MGM cartoon ""Little Cesario"" (1941) and a theatrical trailer are also on hand. Most interesting are the 2 radio adaptations of ""A Woman's Face,"" one with Bette Davis and one with Ida Lupino. Both were recorded in the same year...must have been a popular story!

4. ""Flamingo Road"" (1949) is the only film in this set from Joan's Warner Brothers career. Again, she plays a hardened woman, Lane Bellamy, a carny dancer who is able to cross over to the right side of the tracks against the wishes of the corrupt small town political boss, Titus Semple (Sydney Greenstreet). She falls for weak sheriff Fielding Carlisle (Zachary Scott), but ends up marrying wealthy politician Dan Reynolds (David Brian). Titus does all that he can to bring both Lane and Dan down. This is a fun and trashy film, again, somewhat predictable. Excellent performances by the entire cast. Extras include the short featurette ""Crawford at Warners"" which rehashes fairly common knowledge about Joan's jump from MGM as she sought better roles. Again, a few film critics and Christina are trotted out for this 10 minute or so documentary. Nothing really revealing here. The theatrical trailer and a vintage cartoon short, ""Curtain Razor"" are included, along with the audio-only radio adaptation.

5. ""Torch Song"" (1953) has become a cult classic...and not in a good way. Crawford came back to MGM for this one film, her first technicolor feature. Originally it was to be a Lana Turner vehicle, but she wisely turned it down. Joan plays Jenny Stewart a (surprise!) tough Broadway star used to getting things her way. This all changes when a blind piano accompanist (Michael Wilding) enters her life and tries to change her. Fairly predictable, with an embarassingly quick and bad finale (the only thing missing from making it a total disaster is the lead character getting his sight back!). Joan looks fantastic and does the best that she can with a very trite script. Sadly, her singing is dubbed by India Adams. Although interesting, but somewhat cruel, the extras include her original recording sessions. The voice is good, but off a little in pitch and at times, support. Had this been more than a B-Grade musical cashing in on the Crawford name, surely some time could have been spent to pick songs that she was more comfortable with. Many campy elements and all the earmarkings of a film that was put together rather cheaply and quickly. A sad return for the former Queen of the Lot. There is also absolutely zero chemistry between Wilding and Crawford. The featurette ""Tough Baby: TorchSong"" is probably the best of the featurettes on this set, as it reveals what did (and didn't) go into the making of this movie. Very sad to hear Joan cursing herself as she is unable to get the desired results in her vocal recordings. The vintage film ""Jimmy Fund Public Service Announcement"" is a little creepy; Crawford is seen putting the kids to sleep (as they shot out ""Good Night Mommie"" with the soundtrack of the ""Wizard of Oz"" playing in the background. This is a film to promote donations to a children's cancer facility in Boston. The other extras include a theatrical trailer and vintage cartoon ""TV of Tomorrow.""

For the price, this set is a good value, and it would be hard to imagine buying these films separately as a result. The picture and sound quality are good overall...even the 1934 Sadie McKee. Still, the lackluster short featurettes are a little disappointing, and the vintage cartoons are also a little annoying as they don't really have much to do with Joan. Hopefully future box sets will have more related extras that delve a little deeper into the archives. NOTE: Although some other reviews show that all the movies are ""color/bw"" only ""Torch Song"" is actually in color. What the color/bw refers to are the documentary featurettes and vintage cartoons. This is what happens when you blindly copy info from a pre-release website.",1203292800,12,8549,4.8795595320027525
3004504,5,B000XNZ7NO,"Excellent cross section of Crawford's films from the period 1934-1953. A spectrum of good performances that show how she was evolving as an actress and a star is captured on 5 discs that have been rather meticulously preserved with only very minor scratching on some. Not a bad offering that was long overdue. She shines as ""Sadie Mckee"", she's edgy as a hard luck dame with Clark Gable in ""Strange Cargo"", she's great as a scarred blackmailer in the melodramatic ""A Woman's Face"", then the Crawford we've come to really know faces off with dirty politics in ""Flamingo Road"" and dominates the Technicolor musical drama ""Torch Song"". She does a little bit of everything in these films and shows why she earned ""star"" status, maintained legions of fans over the years and still impresses fans today.

Having received it, the movies are great but I am not in love with the packaging. The discs come in a fold out design with no cover art. Had I known this, I would have waited to purchase the movies individually when they became available, even at a higher cost. I thought the price was too good to be true! Still, the collection is priced well.

Another thing I was looking forward to viewing was the extras, especially Gable and Crawford and Crawford at Warners. It is interesting that they call it Gable and Crawford? Clark Gable was the KING of hollywood but Joans name in all their movies was always before his, even on Strange Cargo. Promotional materials for the film list Gable first. The packaging on this set also lists Gables name first. Even footage from the period shows this. However, first billing did come up during the filming and the quotes below are from the book, Joan Crawford, The Ultimate Star by Alexander Walker: When Mr. Mayer returned, he had to make one of the most delicate arbitrations. The outcome was fixed satisfyingly, and permanently, on the credits when it opened a month later: ""JOAN CRAWFORD & CLARKE GABLE in Strange Cargo"". Play the disc and see. Although I was annoyed at the appearance of Christina Crawford in Gable and Crawford, she did not say anything negative about her mother.  When WB or TCM comes out with the Crawford/Gable boxed set, it should be appropriatley titled.

The Crawford at Warners feature started out great, then five minutes into the film Christina Crawford appeared and was allowed to speak about her mothers drinking, rage and how she took it out on the kids. I cannot understand why Warner Brothers and TCM movies would allow this content to be included? This is a Joan Crawford collection, not a plug for Mommie Dearest. I hear Christina is planning a Mommie Dearest 30 Year Anniversary book. Enough said.

The packaging did not prevent me from returning the collection. It is a great mix of Joan classics.

3238945,5,B000XNZ7NO,"Joan Crawford was the screen's greatest superstar. She was famous for her beauty, her sizzling affairs, and her fabulous, glamorous lifestyle. She is Hollywood personified, and is a shining symbol of its golden age. Beyond that, she was a questionable mother and an underrated actress. I want to underline the word underrated because, in contrast to her dizzyingly over-the-top, rags-to-riches life story, which is still the stuff of rumor and speculation, her film work is sometimes neglected.

Crawford is often referred to as a great actress, which indeed she is, but never as the greatest actress. That title is often reserved for the likes of Katharine Hepburn or Bette Davis (not that Crawford is far behind in the ranks). Although most film critics and fans respect Crawford, there is often a condescending note to their adulation.

Crawford is, more often than not, described as: ""a star, not an actress."" This is a label, and a misguided one. Crawford's glamour and personality, as well as the subtlety in which she approaches roles, make it too easy to overlook her talent. Because she is not acting in the crafty, mechanical sense: she works on instinct, and reaches the soul of her characters through her own soul.

Crawford had a peerless ability to reach the heart and soul of every character she played. You will see it in those haunting, sad Crawford eyes in every closeup. Those emotions will stay with you because they are not the mere work of an actress--they are real, and come from a very real place--her past.

The vulnerability Crawford projects makes a dynamic contrast to her tough, and sometimes hardened, persona. It is a contrast which is striking--and extremely effective. In each role highlighted in Warner Bros.' second edition Crawford box set, you will see the side of Crawford I have tried to describe in these paragraphs, and why she is a sterling actress with a gift for revealing characters through herself which is unmatched by any other actress of her time, or ours.

SADIE MCKEE (1934). Although your first impression of Crawford in this film may be of her youthful vibrance, keep in mind that by this time in her career Crawford had already been an established star for six years. Her breakthrough role was in the 1928 silent film Our Dancing Daughters, in which she became a star overnight playing a jazz age flapper. By 1934, Crawford had discarded her dancing girl image in favor of playing hard-working girls trying to get by in depression-era America. SADIE MCKEE is the quintessential depression-era, working girl Crawford. She is at all times a vision of art deco splendor, in a film which introduced to us the standard, ""All I Do is Dream of You.""

TORCH SONG (1953). This is a technicolor treat, and a fun piece of fluff which must qualify as style over substance. The screenplay is horrid, the costumes are shocking, and there is a parade of Crawfordisms on display. Forget what I said about subtlety earlier: Crawford throws all of that out of the window here, and plays this tough Broadway star with ferocious bitchery. Of course the Crawford sorcery is as bewitching as ever, as she injects every scene with as much glamour as is humanly possible, but project is so deliriously campy and over-the-top as to diminish any serious artistic risk Crawford may have been taking. The highlight, however, is the song ""Tenderly,"" played throughout.

A WOMAN'S FACE (1941). One of Crawford's touchstone performances. A timeless portrait of a criminal who finds a chance at redemption through a physical transformation which offers spiritual renewal.

STRANGE CARGO (1940). Gable and Crawford bring romantic fireworks to this adventure story of prisoners trying to escape an island. Crawford is again cast as a fallen woman who has reason to reconsider the course her life has taken, with astonishing results.

FLAMINGO ROAD (1949). One of Crawford's most entertaining movies casts her as a carnival girl in love with a respectable politician. His love for her doesn't fit in with his career plans, but we know Crawford is too ambitious to leave it at that!

So there you have it. A timeless collection of films made by a timeless film goddess. You can't afford to not add this set to your collection. It's taken too long to get here.",1201824000,6,4277,4.911357340720222
3238946,5,B000XNZ7NO,"I am extremely pleased that Joan's releases are relatively constant out in the market, especially this year. I know most people complained about Bette Davis vol 2 released so soon and not Joan's but lets remember that Joan still was being released during that time without a new box set: Bette's set included a Joan movie ""Baby Jane"", Gable's set included""Dancing Lady"", Wayne's collection had ""Reunion in France"" and then there was Trog too...  The great thing is that some of her best are here with the new box set: especially A Woman's Face, Flamingo Road, and Strange Cargo. On top of that, a separate release of Daysi Keynon is coming just weeks after that. There might be a Harriet Craig and Today We Live release in 2008.  Now nothing would make me happier if they released a Double-DVD for Johnny Guitar, such a rich film , funny and exciting that just gets better with time. It deserves to be released in the US. I think that maybe they re working on something major for this release and when it comes it will be wonderful. After that, in my opinion the last 2 major Joan releases that fans urgently need to have are: 1. a Joan Crawford Silents collection that includes 5 features:  Our Dancing Daughter (they should do it NOW!!!!!!!!!! while Anita Page is still alive and her mind still intact to do a commentary.  Also included must be:Four Walls, Across to Singapore, West Point, and Our Modern Maidens.
2.  A Classic 1930s MGM Joan release:  1. Dance Fools Dance, 2. Paid,  3. Possesed(31), 4. LETTY LYNTON!!! please yes yes yes, 5. The Shining Hour.

After that, I should be content enough and won't bitch about other releases cause the rest of the movies aren't really outstanding in my opinion, and the ones i ve mentioned pretty much cover every stage of Crawford's career from silents to early talkies, from shop girl to villain, from strong young woman to mature sexy woman, from black and white to color. Lets hope they all come out soon.",1199318400,13,1958,4.638728323699422

3238948,4,B000XNZ7NO,"I have been a fan of joans for a few years, and I have 28 of her movies. I was dissapointed and felt cheated like all of you at the box set format. But I got used to it. At least they were generous with the number of beautiful images all over and inside the set. Now,on to the films...

Sadie Mckee(1934) - 5 stars

As mentioned many times,this is a love triangle melodrama typical of 1930's joan, but it has heart and its share of quite serious scenes...
Young Joan is very beautiful, and after being a major star for 6 years,
was quite a good actress already. This movie grew on me like most Joan movies after I paid attention to the more intentionally serious plot points. This movie should really be classified as a tearjearker-weepie,although it definetly is still a comedy. There is some priceless dialogue especially from Joans friend/neighbor/would be bridesmaid as well
as the Mae West impersonator(You will see what I mean). It has some beautiful music and Joan has a drunk scene where she is SUPERB!... Incidently, this film is the one Blanche Hudson watches early on  in ""Baby Jane""

Strange Cargo(1940) - 4 stars

After ""The Women"" proved to be the 2nd highest grossing movie of 1939, Joan was somewhat initially more successfull at getting the front office to get her better roles. As mentioned, the movie starts slow,there are some over long scenes and the plot is impossible to follow and has too much inneuendo and subtext sometimes. The movie flows at a faster pace  when Joan is on screen and is worth it to see the whole film to observe the journey the characters make and see Joan brave the jungle wildlife with Clark Gable:)

 A Woman's Face(1941) - 5 stars
This movie is awesome! She gives a BETTER performance than in ""Mildred Pierce"" (although she is really good there). She is excellent as Anna Holm, a physically disfigured and embitted con-asrtist/extortionist. This movie has many ""NOIR"" qualities;the lighting,the flashbacks, unlikable character(s)the potentiol for tragedy near the end. As noted in the ""MIldred Pierce"" documentary,you can just tell Joan has been starved for a role this juicy and she is taking full advantage of it! For the first time ever, you really get the feeling she is an actress,not a movie star. This movies also boasts some first rate character actors( as do all the movies here, even ""Torch Song""), beautiful costumes,music directing.(although to be fair,this movie does not flow smoothly all the time either ).In the suspensful third act scenes Joan really has to depend on the emoting and pantomiming she developed during her silent days and proved herself still excellent at almost 10 years later in the excellent ""Sudden Fear"".This part of the movie is so good, it almost reminds you of Hitchcock film. The scene where Joan is playing the piano and unviels one of the most beautiful laughs in movie history should be a special treat ...

Flamingo Road(1949) - 4 stars

This movie is a B movie,but a fun one. Joan plays one of her tough girl from the wrong of the tracks roles. She is way too old for the part of
world-weary carnival girl,but she doesnt care, so why should we?As noted in the ""Joan at Warners"" featurette, she is very very good at being hard and cheap. Sydney Greenstreet plays her enemy and they DO have great chemistry together! He played bad guys in other Warners classics ""The Maltese  Falcon"" and ""Casablanca"" and he appropriatly scary/creepy/gross for the part. The scene where Joan doubleslaps him is classic as is the their final showdown. Great,but bordering on campy Fun.

and Torch Song(1953)- 3 stars

This is ABSOLUTELY a B movie, but still alot of fun as well. I won't give anything away of course, but Joan is Jenny Stewart, a broadway star and the biggest bitch that ever lived! She, like the queen in ""Alice in Wonderland"" always just wants things HER way. Right into the very first seconds ,Torch Song sets the tone for the narcissism that is JOAN! There aren't ALOT of great things about this movie,but Joans dialogue is FIERCE(when is it not?the line with the dog is CLASSIC),she dances decently,the technicolor(s) are pretty,and the furniture in Joans bedroom is very interesting, and the lady playing Joans mom is a great actress(Marjorie Rambeau).Lets be fair, Joan DOES overact here to the point of turning it into the drag queen convention it has become today. With her bright orange hair,huge mouth and eyebrows,Joan is rather terrifying. The ""two-faced woman"" musical number has already gone down as extremely bizzare .Well worth watching for a well intended campfest.............You may recognize her assistant,Anne(played by Madie Norman) as the maid Elvira in ""Baby Jane""

For a great,GREAT GREAT overview of joan films go to [..]",1195862400,,4739,4.841779975278121
3238949,5,B000XNZ7NO,"These are the Films of the first true Movie-Star, Miss Joan Crawford. I cannot wait for this DVD set, because it will include some of Joan's best movies!! And, the movies in this boxed set include Joan at her most stunning! ""Sadie McKee"" is absolutely my favorite movie, ever. Joan looks so beautiful in this 1934 MGM classic. I first saw this movie 5 years ago when TCM did a month-long Joan Crawford marathon; this was the first movie I ever saw with Miss Crawford and since then I became a huge fan and completely fell in love with this kind, beautiful and very talented actress! I also absolutely adore ""Strange Cargo."" This is one of Joan's best pictures with her number-one leading man, Clark Gable; and as far as I'm aware it is the only movie she ever made with Mr. Gable where she took second billing! After you view these movies you will see why Miss Crawford was the hardest working woman in Hollywood!

Isn't the picture on the cover of this set really beautiful! Below is a list of each movie included in this set, all movies are shown in pan and scan except for ""Torch Song"" which is in widescreen. (Scroll down, to see a list of each one of the special features included, as well)

Runtime Listing: 90 mins.
(Joan played: Sadie McKee Brennan)
Color/BW: Black and White
Brief Synopsis:
A working girl suffers through three troubled relationships on her road to prosperity.
What Miss Crawford had to say about this movie: Everything about ""Sadie McKee"" was right - Gene Raymond, Franchot Tone, the script, Clarence Brown's direction, Adrian's customs, the works.

Brief Synopsis:
Devil's Island escapees are changed forever by a prisoner who thinks he's Jesus.
What Miss Crawford said about her last picture with Clark Gable: Two absolutely wonderful films and so different (also discussing ""Susan and God"") It's a shame I couldn't have retired right then, and come back to do ""Mildred Pierce."" Clark and I did our best work together in ""Strange Cargo."" We had always been close, sometimes too close, but now we knew each other as mature persons and the chemistry was still there and it added to the fire.

(Joan played: Anna Holm aka Ingrid Paulson)
Brief Synopsis:
Plastic surgery gives a scarred female criminal a new outlook on life.
This is what Miss Crawford says about this picture: I have nothing but the best to say for ""A Woman's Face."" It was a splendid script and George(George Cukor, the director) let me run with it. I finally shocked both the critics and the public into realizing the fact that I was, at heart, a dramatic actress. Great thanks to Melvyn Douglas; I think he is one of the least-appreciated actors the screen has ever used.

Brief Synopsis:
A stranded carnival dancer takes on a corrupt political boss when she marries.
Here are Miss Crawford's comments on this film: ...This script missed, Curtiz (the director) missed, I missed. I just didn't jell, that's all, and it's another time  when my judgment screwed up completely, because we were shooting it I thought it would be good.

(Joan played: Jenny Stewart)
Brief Synopsis:
Musical comedy legend Jenny Stewart, who has been hardened by the worst life has to offer, finds romance when blinded war-veteran Tye Graham becomes her new piano accompanist.
Miss Crawford's comments on this movie: ...Back at Metro, after all those years... it was like a homecoming, and half the people on the set, the prop men and the grips.... they remembered me and I remembered  them. I loved doing that film. It gave me a chance to dance again, to pretend to sing, to emote all over the place and in color yet! (Note: This is Miss Crawford's first staring role in a major motion picture that is entirely in color!) If I hadn't brought it off I'd only have myself to blame because all the elements were there.

This boxed set also includes a lot of special features, many of which I enjoyed very much. I especially got a kick out of Joan's ""Torch Song"" recording sessions! And, I enjoyed Joan's rendition of ""Flamingo Road"" very much because this is one of her first radio performances that I have heard and it also included a brief interview afterwards!

Why was Miss Crawford such a fascinating and unconventional star...?

Miss Crawford was a first-rate star, who worked her a-s-s off to get to where she was! And, do you know what she did once she got there? She worked 10 times harder...! Joan had the longest and most impressive film career of any star during Tinseltown's famed Golden Age of Cinema! Joan's career lasted 5 decades! And her career proved to be more loyal to her than any lover or husband! Miss Crawford was always known for her fashion-sense, classical beauty and the ability to constantly re-invent herself (half a century before the Material Girl was a household name!)

Joan Crawford started her career in 1925 as a flapper, playing in bit parts as a contract-player for the most glorious studio in town, MGM. She was nothing more than a glorified prop, unbilled in her first film, ""Lady of the Night."" Soon, Joan was promoted to leading-lady, appearing in such critically-acclaimed pictures as, Harry Langdon's Tramp Tramp Tramp, and Lon Chaney's The Unknown. But it wasn't until Joan accepted the role of Diana Medford, in Our Dancing Daughters that she became a bona fide star! By the end of the decade Joan had more than 20 pictures under her belt!

In the 30's when many silent stars were bowing out gracefully, Joan was back with a vengeance! This time Joan was the little shop girl that Depression-Era American ladies (and maybe even some boys, too) could really identify with. Miss Crawford could be seen acting in such famed movies as, ""Letty Lynton,"" Rain, Grand Hotel, and one of my personal favorites, Forsaking All Others (1934). Some of the 25 classics that Joan also made during the 30's include: Dancing Lady, Laughing Sinners, Dance, Fools, Dance (Forbidden Hollywood), Chained, ""No More Ladies,"" Gorgeous Hussy, Love on the Run (1936), The Bride Wore Red, Mannequin (1938) and of course one of her most popular ever, The Women !

""No more goddamn shop girls,"" Joan was once quoted as saying to MGM chief-honcho, Louis B. Mayer. In the 40's Joan yet again came back in another one of her many incarnations, this time as the society matron in such movies as, When Ladies Meet , Reunion in France and Above Suspicion (1943). In 1942 Miss Crawford donated her entire salary from Columbia's They All Kissed the Bride to the war-effort and then she turned around and fired her agent when he didn't do the same! After 18 years of being a member of the MGM family, Miss Crawford took a huge gamble and decided to branch out, this time working for the actor's studio, Warners. Joan's first film for Warners, was her most famous movie, and it garnered her the Oscar for Best Actress; playing the title role in her defining-film, Mildred Pierce . Joan also made a slew other first-rate pictures during this period, such as: Humoresque and Daisy Kenyon . Moving to Warners really paid off for Miss Crawford, because she also received her second Academy Award nomination for Possessed, playing the harried Louise Howell! Of course, Miss Crawford had all the time in the world for our servicemen. Joan was often seen at the Hollywood Canteen entertaining our boys; ...how many of today's movie stars get off their pedestals to do this?

The 50's marked a very pivotal time in Joan's illustrious career. Because in the next chapter of her picture resume, she played the determined and strong matriarch in many wonderful dramatic cinematic masterpieces. Such as, Harriet Craig, Queen Bee, ""Female on the Beach,"" The Damned Don't Cry, ""Goodbye My Fancy,"" Story of Esther Costello and Autumn Leaves. Miss Crawford also received her third Academy Award nomination playing Myra Hudson in RKO's Sudden Fear. And never one to be typecast, Joan made a big splash in Johnny Guitar, portraying a tough saloon owner in the wild-west! Also beginning in the 50's, Joan took up the campaign as official spokeswoman for Pepsi-Cola; a coveted role that she enjoyed for more than 18 years!

In the 60's Miss Crawford didn't slow down for a second! Nope! She came out swinging. Joan made the whole country ask in droves, What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? . In one of her most well-known pictures ever, Joan played Blanche Hudson, opposite another very talented actress, Ms. Davis, in this gorgeous Warners film! Throughout all the 60's Joan was known as the ""Scream Queen."" She stared in such cult-favorites as, Strait-Jacket, Della, I Saw What You Did and Berserk!! It was also around this time, that Miss Crawford penned her autobiography, A Portrait of Joan Crawford.

Even in semi-retirement, Miss Crawford still always kept busy during the 1970's. This time she was the Hollywood Legend, and everyone knew it! When the movie studios weren't knocking on her door, she switched to television. In one of her last television appearances, Miss Crawford played the part of Joan Fairchild in ABC's ""The Sixth Sense: Dear Joan: We're Going to Scare You to Death."" She also wrote her second book, the best-selling My Way of Life. And, Joan always found the time for some of her favorite charities; donating her talent and time to The Muscular Dystrophy Association and The American Cancer Society. Of course, Joan also made time to speak to her good friend and journalist Roy Newquist. Mr. Newquist was actually the only journalist that Miss Crawford chose to speak to during the late 70's, and his thoughtful (and unprecedented) interviews with Joan were published in the 1980 book, Conversations with Joan Crawford.

Miss Crawford perished a second time when the majority of the public threw her away and vilified her as a lunatic. But this death was much more painful. Because not only were Joan's films forgotten, but all of the good she did during her lifetime was also completely erased! The true Joan Crawford was kind, compassionate and generous to a fault. Joan was a self-made lady who worked for everything she got. She just wanted to keep her head above water in a man's world where women didn't have a voice or a choice. Miss Crawford never for a second forgot where she came from or who she was, and she never for a moment let her beloved fans down! All Joan wanted was for someone to give her a chance and believe in her. I really am so glad that this set is coming out because maybe now the public can see the real Joan Crawford and remember her as she truly was!",1194566400,119,16666,5.398230088495575
3238950,4,B000XNZ7NO,"I'm excited to own this set in February.  I saw ""A Woman's Face"" on TV years ago and thought it was really good.  I've seen ""Flamingo Road"" several times.  I've been hosting a series of classic film screenings at my place for more than a year.  Two of these events have included double features of Crawford and Bette Davis films.  I'll be pairing the five new Crawford DVDs with Davis films eventually.  I just hope the Davis set expected from WB in '08 is good.  With ""All This, and Heaven Too"", as has been rumored, it should be!  WB should consider a set of Crawford and Gable films!  And where is ""Waterloo Bridge"" with Vivien Leigh?",1194480000,6,637,4.422413793103448
3238951,5,B000XNZ7NO,"This is the long awaited second volume of the Joan Crawford Collection. Joan had a very long career in films spanning from the silent era and MGM into the 1970's. She was one of the few actresses to successfully make the transition from silents to sound, and this set gives you a sampling of her roles from 1934 to 1953. The following are the five films in this set and their extra features:

Sadie McKee (1934)
One of the last precodes, this film is a melodrama that has Joan Crawford playing a totally virtuous character throughout. She's a maid who is fired for telling off the head of the household (Franchot Tone). Next, her boyfriend deserts her for a chorus girl. She ends up marrying an alcoholic millionaire strictly as a matter of survival, but she does help her husband cure himself of his alcoholism. Afterwards she asks for a divorce so she can go look for her old boyfriend, who is now alone and quite ill. This movie introduced the song ""All I Do is Dream of You"" by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown.

Strange Cargo (1940)
Andre (Clark Gable) is a convict in a French penal colony in South America. The first time he tries to escape saloon girl Julie (Joan Crawford) turns him in. His second attempt is successful, and this time he throws in his lot with several other escapees, one of which seems to always know what is about to happen, and is even able to draw accurate maps of escape routes. During this escape Andre runs into Julie again. At the conclusion of the escape Andre realizes the reason for the one prisoner's extraordinary abilities and has a change of heart. A very strange film and a strange role for Crawford, although I found it intriguing. Directed by Frank Borzage who is noted for his love stories involving crime, loss, and redemption.

One of Joan Crawford's best performances as a woman whose scarred face embitters her and leads her into a life of crime until a surgeon (Melvin Douglas) decides to operate and remove her outer scars. However, her inner scars remain and she finds it hard to change even with the help of the good doctor. This film initially failed at the box office, but was recognized as a classic years later.

Lane Bellamy (Joan Crawford) is a dancer touring with a carnival who falls in love with Fielding Carlisle. However, a marriage to a carnival dancer is not what Fielding's political handler, Titus Semple, considers a suitable move for his protege. Thus he has Lane framed and sent to jail and arranges a loveless marriage for Fielding with a girl more appropriate for the future he has planned for him. Once out of jail, Lane falls in love with and marries another prominent person, but their future together is threatened when Fielding comes to call. Directed by Michael Curtiz.

Torch Song (1953)
This was Joan Crawford's return vehicle to MGM after having left ten years earlier, and is the weakest of the films in the bunch, but that doesn't mean it's bad. Instead it is great fun because it is such a camp classic. Too bad there's no commentary, because I would really like to know what went on behind the scenes in this one. It has everything - Technicolor, an over-the-top wardrobe for Joan, and of course there's Joan as a steamroller of a woman that no man can stand up to except a British pianist, blinded in WWII. And then there are the musical numbers - well, you'll have to see it for yourself.

3238964,5,B000XNZ7NO,"Just a quick review of this set, since so many other reviewers have done a good job of describing it.  Time to put my two cents in...

The Joan Crawford Collection, Vol. 2 (2008) contains five Crawford classics.  They are:

Sadie McKee (1934)
Strange Cargo (1940)
A Woman's Face (1941)
Flamingo Road (1949)
Torch Song (1953)

This set will provide a wide variety of Crawford roles and movies.  These movies are from the Golden Age of Hollywood and star the symbol of Hollywood's Golden Age, Joan Crawford.  All are gems, but my favorites are A Woman's Face (1941) and Sadie McKee (1934).  In fact, I'll do my own rating of these movies:

Sadie McKee  - 5 stars
Strange Cargo - 5 stars
A Woman's Face - 5 stars
Flamingo Road - 4 stars
Torch Song - 3 stars

Strange Cargo was the eight and last time Crawford and Clark Gable starred in a movie together and has Crawford in an unglamorous, tougher role where she's even getting dirty.  The Alfred Hitchcock movie Lifeboat (1944) reminds me of certain parts of Strange Cargo.

A Woman's Face is a cool movie.  I've seen the original Swedish version from 1938 starring Ingrid Bergman, which was good, but I like this 1941 remake starring Joan Crawford and Melvyn Douglas even better.  Crawford plays a woman who was physically scarred as a child and takes up a life of crime as an adult.  Some corrective surgery changes everything.  Crawford's disfigured face is quite unsettling, which makes her have kind of a scary look.  This movie is quite dark and shadowy as well, kind of like a film noir movie.  Crawford was unglamorous in this movie, which audiences at the time weren't expecting and ultimately disliked.  Her acting is superb.  In fact, she should have been nominated for an Academy Award, but wasn't due to the movie's failure at the box office.  Time has been kind to this movie, however, and it is now seen as a classic, and Crawford's performance is now receiving the praise and appreciation that was missing in 1941.  For me personally, Crawford's best performances are (in no particular order) Possessed (1947), Sudden Fear (1952), Humoresque (1946), Mildred Pierce (1945), A Woman's Face (1941), Rain (1932), Paid (1930), Chained (1934), Sadie McKee (1934), and The Women (1939).

It was always said that Joan was a star and not an actress.  How wrong they are.  This set highlights Crawford's acting skills which were formidable.  Even when one of her movies does not quite live up to your expectations, Joan never disappoints.  She put everything she had into every role she undertook and you cannot help but be impressed by such a talented actress.  Yes, Joan was one of Hollywood's greatest stars, but also one of its greatest actresses, a true queen among mere mortals.",1270252800,2,659,4.629310344827586

3238981,5,B000XNZ7NO,"After nearly 2 years since the last Joan Crawford boxset came out, comes this wonderful collection of Joan's films, which will more than satisfy those ardent Crawford fans, as well as the ordinary novie buff. In this set we get 5 classic Joan films; ""A Woman's Face"", ""Sadie McKee"", ""Strange Cargo"", ""Flamingo Road"", and my favorite ""Torch Song"". All the films come in full screen format, as that's the way they were filmed, except ""Torch Song"", which is in a beautiful widescreen edition. We get a good glimpse into the kind of actress Crawford was in these films. In  ""A Woman's Face"", Joan should have received an Oscar for her role, as most critics agree her performance of a woman disfigured is one of her best. In ""Strange Cargo"" Joan is reunited with her former lover and co-star Clark Gable, and it's one of their best films together. I also love ""Flamingo Road"", where she plays Lane, a carnival girl trying to improve her status as a reputable lady in a small southern town. This film served as the basis for the TV primetime soap of the same name in the 1980's starring Morgan Fairchild. ""Sadie McKee"" is another one of Joan's early MGM films where she crosses the side of the tracks and becomes a society woman. Scenes from this film are also used in ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?""; they are in scenes where Joan's character, Blanche, is watching herself on television at the beginning of the film. Finally, ""Torch Song"" is campy as hell, and Joan pulls off being a fantastic bitch. She plays Jenny, a Broadway star with a heart made of metal, but she finally changes when she meets a blind pianist and she falls passionately in love. The film is also in color. This is also one of Crawford's favorite movies that she ever appeared in; as she said, ""...it was a field day for actess, especially one that reached a certain age...I had the chance to act, dance, and pretend to sing""( as her voice was overdubbed).
 This is a splendid boxset at a great price. So far the only was to own any of these films is by purchasing the boxset, as the films themselves are not sold individually. The packaging is beautiful too; it opens up like a book with the 5 films impacted neatly in their jewel cases. The plastic that holds the DVD's are extemely strong, so we shouldn't have any problems with the dics becoming dislogged and scratched. Hopefully more Crawford boxsets will become available in the future too. If you haven't already bought the first Crawford boxset please buy it; it too covers a large area of Crawford's work, and it features her best movie, ""Mildred Pierce"", which won her the Oscar. Those 5 movies in that boxset are in their own individual cases.",1237766400,,2675,4.60587002096436
3238982,5,B000XNZ7NO,"All of the films are very entertaining, Flamingo Road could almost singularly define 'potboiler' and Crawford's at her best, if a bit ridiculous early-on as a 50-ish carnival 'dancing girl', i guess that was the point.  She's terrific in the film once you get beyond the first few minutes.
And the price!  At this writing (11/21/08) it is DEEPLY discounted at 52% off list- i paid way more than that last year, and it was worth it.  Anyone reading, SNAP THIS UP at 23 bucks! Christmas stocking stuffer for the classic film enthusiastic, female impersonator or great-grandmother on your shopping list.  And at this price, buy one for yourself- Very nicely packaged, good extras- it's been out for a year, so read the earlier reviews for all of the details ( i was most partial, again, to Flamingo Road, Strange Cargo and Torch Song, but as in all things, its only a subjective opinion), and to be less glib, i meant no disrespect to female impersonators or great-grandmothers.

Slo tengo ciertos reparos acerca del formato del box set, que es un poco engorroso de manipular, comparado con el box set N1 de Joan, con cajas independientes. Otra cosa es la ausencia de subttulos en espaol o francs; pienso que se le habra dado una difusin ms amplia y dado ms categora a los discos. Tambin pienso que le sobran unos cortos animados, que nada tienen que ver con la Crawford, existiendo tanto material visual indito sobre ella. An as lo importante es el contenido, que no obstante representa una muy buena seleccin de films y un trabajo de restauracin impecable. Particularmente mi favorita fue ""Torch Song"": una explosin de color y estilo, sumado a unos temas musicales hermosos. Categora aparte es el nmero musical de ""Two faced woman"", la performance ms freak de la historia del cine!.
Es de esperar que salgan a la venta otros sets de DVD de Joan Crawford; siento que los estudios estn en deuda, con cintas como ""Our dancing daughters"", ""Harriet Craig"", ""Susan and God"" o ""Letty Lynton"", adems de haber dejado pasar el aniversario 100 de su nacimiento (punto para Davis!... por ahora).",1215388800,2,1231,4.784037558685446

I won't review each movie in detail, suffice it to say that ""Sadie McKee"" is a classic example of Joan in Shopgirl-To-Socialite mode - not for everyone, particularly not when movies like ""Mildred Pierce"", ""Possessed"" or ""A Woman's Face"" show that Crawford's acting capabilities stretch far and beyond the limitations of Sadie's trite storyline - but is an enjoyable sort of ""Pretty Woman"" prototype nonetheless. ""Strange Cargo"" IS strange - gorgeous performances by Gable and Crawford in an ahead-of-its-time tale of morality and redemption that - dare I say it - doesn't work as well as it could have (again, a laboured and overlong script robs this film of the talents of its two principal stars).

""A Woman's Face"" is a fabulous movie - if you can look past the dodgy makeup effects Joan turns in a stellar performance here, and the plot moves from drama to melodrama to thriller with polished facility, and I am delighted that this is finally out on DVD!! ""Flamingo Road"" is great, too - sure, we can't really believe coiffed, refined Joan as a carney stripper Lane Bellamy, but the film itself is well-made, well-acted and thoroughly enjoyable.

And ""Torch Song"". If you can picture Marlene Dietrich astride a pink unicorn, eating chocolate clairs and blowing soap bubbles from her tiara, while ""Pop Goes The Weasel"" plays in the background, you are still nowhere near picturing the all-conquering campness of this particular motion picture.

And it's fabulous!

The presentation and extras on this set range from the ridiculous (vintage cartoons?!?!) to the sublime (audio recordings of Bette Davis and Ida Lupino in ""A Woman's Face"", Crawford's own vocal stylings for her ultimately dubbed role in ""Torch Song"", and pleasing Crawford & Gable and Jimmy Fund PSA shorts).

This is a very worthwhile purchase for any Crawford fan: what are you waiting for? Thoroughly recommended, and containing great examples of Ye Olde Chick Flick (Sadie McKee), searing dramatic talent (A Woman's Face, Strange Cargo) brilliant direction and storytelling (A Woman's Face, Flamingo Road) and boundless hilarity (Torch Song).

I ordered it right away, and just received it and again, while I love the films in the set, the box 'set up' really annoys me. The fold out type of case is not what I was expecting. Since I have Volume 1, where all the DVDs are in individual cases with cover art, this is what I was expecting. I really wanted to put all the DVDs together in my media cabinet in alphabetical order, with the hopes that someday all Joan Crawford's films would be available on DVD and I would have a complete shelf of Joan!!!
This may sound petty, but I feel that sometimes the studios are trying to save money by cutting back on the boxed sets yet they don't lower the prices for the consumer. I like to take DVDs with me to watch on a long car trip (no...

But you gotta hand it to Joansie...she soldiered on through great suspense (A Woman's Face, Strange Cargo) and parody (Torch Song). It's nice to see Sadie McKee. She's really great as the Florence Nightingale of a rich drunkard in Sadie McKee.

Anyway, Strange Cargo and A Woman's Face are two of Joan's best, she really sinks her teeth into the parts she plays in both films. She really should have been nominated for an Oscar for A Woman's Face. Torch Song is campy, but still entertaining. Flamingo Road is great fun, Sydney Greenstreet and Joan have great chemistry and work very well together. With Sadie McKee we get to see a young and innocent Joan working her way up the ladder in society. A typical role of her early MGM days, but one of the really good ones(along with Possessed '31).

3238993,4,B000XNZ7NO,"The 2 best are ""Saddie McKee"" and ""Strange Cargo"", by Clarence Thomas and Frank Borzage respectively.

Then come ""Flamingo Road"", a very good -though not great- Curtiz classic, and ""Torchsong"", a good -but not very good- semi-musical. The one that is no good at all is Cukor's ""A Woman's Face"", which must be Cukor's worst film ever, or thereabouts.

""Torch Song"" reminds me of Bette Davis's ""All About Eve""; of course not as good, but it's a film where the leading star carries the show all by herself, it's all about the female star. This one in beautiful technicolor.

The picture that lasts in my mind is that of Crawford and Gable together in the rough characters of the adventuresome and spiritually filled film by Borzage; by the way, one of the most plain Christian films I've seen. The Christ-like character though is too stiff. It would be asking too much of the film, considering its time in Hollywood history.

A great bunch of truly American classic movies, with Crawford's signature all over.

3238994,2,B000XNZ7NO,"A good actress in good films it is sad that Crawford made so few good films.  The ones represented here each have their moments but most of them are so bad that they couldn't hold my attention.  First Sadie McKee...Crawford's leading men are so bland that no one cares who she winds up with in the end.  Crawford's acting is artificial (who in the world speaks with a british accent if she was brought up a poor girl as her character in this picture????)  The only thing good about the movie is the song, ""All I Do is Dream of You"".  Second movie:  Strange Cargo:  Perhaps I need to watch this film again.  I've seen it three or four times and I cannot get into it.  It drags along at an exceedingly slow pace and Gable is annoying as all get out in it, even more so than Crawford.  The movie is much too long and the plot is very confusing.  Not even MGMs glossiness can help this one (probably the worst of the lot).  Flamingo Road is pure soap opera trash but Crawford does have her moments in this one.  They are relatively few, though.  This is a film Barbara Stanwyck would have excelled in.  It does manage to keep your attention for the most part thanks to the supporting players (Gladys George, Sydney Greenstreet and Zachary Scott) who manage to make Joan look good.  She's showing her age with this one, though.  ""A Woman's Face"" is the best of the lot here, but again, the plot is contrived and silly.  Crawford does turn in a good performance here and sometimes even great.  THe film was not a box office success.  The last film here, ""Torch Song"" is pure grade B- movie.  It is one of the few films that shows the true persona of Joan Crawford (not the movie star but the human being).  Insecure, selfish, and totally narcissistic.  A bad performance and a bad film that does not stand the test of time well.  The worst part is watching Crawford lip synch to the vocals (provided by India Adams).  Crawford could dance but she couldn't sing.  The set does have some great extras in it (though inexplicably, Christina Crawford is in them!!!!??????  Huh???)  Joan's best movies have already been released on DVD:  They are ""Humoresque"", ""Possessed (1947)"" ""Sudden Fear"" (which contains her all time best performance) and ""The Women"".  I'm sorry I was very disappointed with this collection.",1204156800,11,2302,4.530413625304136
3238995,4,B000XNZ7NO,"A fine set offering a good cross section of Joan's career. The only clunker in this set would be Torch Song-a rather clunky, odd musical that could have been left out of this set and replaced with something more fitting. Even Johnny Guitar would have been fun for this set. The extras are again on the weak side but afterall we don't buy DVD's for the extras but for the movies themselves, and these movies look pretty good considering their age. On another note, the presentation for this boxed set is great.",1204156800,3,509,4.543478260869565
3238996,4,B000XNZ7NO,"Those responsible for the choice of films in this Crawford collection must have had their tongues firmly in their cheeks. The set covers 3 films from MGM from 1934 to 1941, one post war melodrama from Warners, then back to MGM for a one off return engagement in 1953. The films parallel a change in Crawford's image as she consistently tried to re-invent herself and eventually ended up a parody. The journey is not necessarily flattering to the star when you view the films in chronological order.

- in 1934, Crawford was at the height of her popularity at MGM and ""Sadie McKee"" is one of her high budget working girl sagas. She overacts most of her scenes but  radiates warmth and was still able to ""connect"" with her co-stars, including future husband Franchot Tone, who is a real drip here and does some really bad acting. The film is well made but Clarence Brown directs at a plod and every scene is drawn out and could be edited without loss of narrative. The pace induces boredom. The plot is pure Mills and Boon and the story strains credibility in every way. The best performance is given by Jean Dixon as a jaded lady. She has some great pre-code zingers which she delivers with aplomb. Esther Ralston does a parody of Mae West which comes over as very mannered. The print is good.
- By 1940, Crawford was an actress with the ambition to take some risks and both ""Strange Cargo"" and ""A Woman's Face"" contain 2 of her best performances, if only because they divert from the standard Crawford formula. Both films are well made with unusual, in fact, incredible stories, great casts, good directors and a degree of suspense. In both, at some point, Crawford is stripped of her glamour, looks great and really tries to act a character. In ""A Woman's Face"", she benefits from George Cukor's detailed direction. Conrad Veidt is particularly sinister and riveting. However, whereas Veidt embodies evil, Crawford only enacts it so her reformation is entirely predictable. The prints of both films are excellent.
- By 1948 in ""Flamingo Road"", she plays a carnival dancer and at 40 plus, she is too old for the part. Her toughness is more than just an act. The film starts well but deteriorates into overwrought melodrama after a series of incredible confrontations. Crawford herself thought that this was a film which did not turn out as well as she expected and thought it could have been due to the editing. Gladys George is the best performer here in her familiar role of a nightclub/brothel owner and Sydney Greenstreet is decadent and convincing. The print is excellent.
- by ""Torch Song"", Crawford's persona was from another planet. While this film may be a camp classic, it is dreadful and Crawford projects a complete zombie in a really horrible musical performance. The disconnect from those around her is complete.

The extras with this set are quite interesting. The short documentary on Gable and Crawford tracks their relationship but without generating the heat the stars did. I was expecting something more gutsy. The one on the Warner's years captures well how Crawford moved towards alcoholism and deep insecurity in her private life, ironically reflected in the generally angry and aggressive women she played at this time. Unlike other reviewers, Christina Crawford's involvement seems logical to me. She watched first hand her mother's transition from woman to zombie and since the set tracks this so well, her comments are relevant and not necessarily negative. For example, she speaks nicely of her mother's deep compassion and kindness to Clark Gable when Carole Lombard died.

The most unusual extra is Crawford's recording session from ""Torch Song"". In each take, Crawford's confidence grows and the result has a sort of masochistic appeal which suits the mood of the film, I suppose. The short documentary on the film is excellent and Janine Basinger is amusing when she offers no explanation for the bizarre musical number ""Two Faced Woman"".

For ""A Woman's Face"", 2 radio performances are included with 2 other major dramatic actresses, Bette Davis and Ida Lupino, in the leading role. Given the limitations of the curtailed radio scripts, it is interesting to compare the 3 interpretations of the role. Davis uses a subtle accent and gives a subdued reading. Lupino spits out her lines and is hysterical, her trademark at this time. Other extras include cartoons and shorts, some good and others indifferent. All of the films contain the original trailers.

For Crawford fans, this set is, of course, compulsory buying. If one of Crawford's silents had been included when she was young and raunchy, the transition would have been complete. As it is, this is a more interesting set to me than Volume 1.",1203811200,3,4732,4.88667496886675

It's wonderful to be reminded that her career wasn't all camp or hysterics...and this set amply displays her talent and physical gifts.

There are some entertaining special features including period trailers, cartoons and clips as well as some interesting expert commentary (although I don't understand why Christina Crawford--whether or not you consider her bias justified and/or honest--continues to be sought after as a pundit).

All these great films in one collection make this a real value.",1203724800,2,667,5.394230769230769
3238998,3,B000XNZ7NO,"I've been waiting a long time for this set and I was not really happy with the lack of restoration that they did on the four Joan classics! The contrast and audio are good in HD but they didn't spend much time (if any) cleaning up the dirt and scratches on the prints. Joan deserves so much better! The extras are pretty forgettable and Neal's commentary is too short. Who wants to hear from Christina? Ick! I think we've all heard enough from her already...""yes we know Joan mistreated her""... I'd like to see some of Joan's earlier films included on the next set...and please, spend a little time restoring these!",1203638400,6,615,4.54954954954955
3238999,5,B000XNZ7NO,"At long last, the campest of all Joan Crawford camp classics, ""Torch Song,"" is on DVD!  Only in 1953 -- with the Red Scare, the threat of nuclear annihilation and the growing threat from televsion bewildering studio executives -- could so tone-deaf a concept get green-lighted.  You see, it's an MGM musical with our Joan as a voice-of-brass, heart-of-brass, Helen Lawson-esqe Broadway diva who falls in love with a disabled rehearsal pianist (Michael Wilding.)

Yes, you'll shudder as a chorus boy trips over Joan's outstretched leg during a not-very-complicated dance routine! You'll cringe as Joan belts out the politically incorrect ""Two Faced Woman"" number! And you'll retch as Joan, on a lunch break from rehearsal, stomps into a restaurant and snarls her order at the maitre d': ""Lobster thermidor and black coffee!""

Also included in this set, The Joan Crawford Collection, Vol. 2, is one of Joan's very best performances in ""A Woman's Face,"" a rare employment of her startling beauty as something more than mere eye-candy. Another change of pace film is ""Strange Cargo,"" with Joan as a Sadie Thompson-ish hooker (in fact a much better performance than what she did with the real thing in ""Rain.)

""Sadie McKee"" and ""Flamingo Road"" are more run-of-the-mill films, but they do demonstrate most clearly the differences in face and manner of Joan pre and post ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mildred-Pierce/dp/B0008ENIAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mildred Pierce</a>.""",1203552000,3,1512,5.585152838427947
3239000,4,B000XNZ7NO,"After the powerhouse release of Volume 1, it doesn't take too much to realize that the Volume 2 would be slightly weaker. This set contains the following 5 movies:

1.  Sadie McKee (1934) This one is actually one of my favorites from the set. Joan plays Sadie, a young girl who falls in love with bad boy Tommy Wallace (Gene Raymond). When Sadie's rich employer's son, Michael Alderson (Franchot Tone), badmouths Tommy, Sadie tells him, quits her job, and follows Tommy to NY. As always, Tommy makes some bad choices and strands Sadie for a cheap blond singer, Dolly (Esther Ralston). Sadie makes friends a woman living in the same boarding house, Opal (Jean Dixon), who helps Sadie get a job at a Dance Hall. While working one night, Sadie catches of the eye of an alcoholic millionaire, Jack Brennan (Edward Arnold). Sadie marries him for his money, but soon learns that money doesn't buy happiness. How things resolve with the three men in her life, Jack, Tommy, and Michael, makes for a good film that shows the growth of all its characters. Especially appealing is the performance of Jean Dixon as the heart of gold Opal, who is not as hard as she appears. For a film that is more than 70 years old, it holds up very well, thanks to a good script and solid performances. Extras: A silly Pete Smith short ""Goofy Movies #4"", a two-strip 1934 technicolor short ""Toyland Broadcast"" (which includes caricatures of Bing Crosby, Paul Whiteman, and a somewhat offensive black-face band named ""Sambo""), and the theatrical trailer.

2. Strange Cargo (1940) is strange indeed! The plot: a bunch of convicts from Devil's Island attempt an escape for a second chance at life. One of the convicts, Verne (Clark Gable) happens upon Julie (Crawford), a hardened prostitute, before his attempted escape. Ratted out by a strange stalker, ""Pig"" (Peter Lorre) for talking to Verne, a convict, Julie is also forced off the island. Besides Julie and the convicts, there is a Christ-like man, Cambreau (Ian Hunter) who joins the group and leads each one of the hardened men to redemption before they die. Of course, the last 2 to get redemption are Verne & Julie; whether they will turn on each other and retain their hardened personas will have to be found out by viewing this film. Crawford is fantastic, showing much depth to her characterization of a typical heart-of-gold prostitute who eventually finds redemption. Gable's limited depth as an actor unfortunately shows through with his character given an extremely poor script. However, as in their previous teamings, there is a great deal of chemistry between the 2. Hunter's character of an all-knowing spiritual man seems a little odd in the middle of a somewhat gritty movie, and his final scene with Gable just seems a little too pat. Hunter gives a strong performance in this rather weird role. Of course, Lorre is perfectly creepy as Crawford's stalking admirer. Somewhat enjoyable to watch, but also a little uneven. Extras: The featurette ""Gable & Crawford"" is enjoyable, but doesn't go into a lot of depth. Christina Crawford gives a few details about her mother and Gable, as do film historians. It seems extremely odd that Christina, who denounced her mother 30 years ago, is now being trotted out as an authority on Joan in all the featurettes on this set. The vintage short ""More About Nostradamus"" (1941) is somewhat interesting, and mixes reenactments of the famous man who made so many prophecies about the future and current historical footage. Also included are the theatrical trailer for ""Strange Cargo"" and a vintage short, ""Lonesome Stranger.""

3. ""A Woman's Face"" (1941) After watching this movie, it is difficult to continually hear that Joan Crawford was a star/personality, but not an actress. She gives an excellent performance as Anna Holm, a blackmailer who was facially scarred in a fire as a child, and bears the inner and outer scars as an adult. Most likely, director George Cukor can be given much of the credit for Joan's performance (as in the 1939 classic ""The Women""). Even after her ""new"" face is revealed from plastic surgeries, Joan does not go back to being a classic star persona; she maintains the gestures and facial tics that she had previously. The film is somewhat predictable, but nonetheless enjoyable to watch. Marjorie Main has a nice cameo in this movie as well. Extras include: vintage short ""You Can't Fool A Camera"" (1941) which is somewhat funny today in the era of CGI. It shows the history of motion pictures VERY briefly from Edward Muybridge to the present films currently being shot or in development at MGM. A vintage color MGM cartoon ""Little Cesario"" (1941) and a theatrical trailer are also on hand. Most interesting are the 2 radio adaptations of ""A Woman's Face,"" one with Bette Davis and one with Ida Lupino. Both were recorded in the same year...must have been a popular story!

4. ""Flamingo Road"" (1949) is the only film in this set from Joan's Warner Brothers career. Again, she plays a hardened woman, Lane Bellamy, a carny dancer who is able to cross over to the right side of the tracks against the wishes of the corrupt small town political boss, Titus Semple (Sydney Greenstreet). She falls for weak sheriff Fielding Carlisle (Zachary Scott), but ends up marrying wealthy politician Dan Reynolds (David Brian). Titus does all that he can to bring both Lane and Dan down. This is a fun and trashy film, again, somewhat predictable. Excellent performances by the entire cast. Extras include the short featurette ""Crawford at Warners"" which rehashes fairly common knowledge about Joan's jump from MGM as she sought better roles. Again, a few film critics and Christina are trotted out for this 10 minute or so documentary. Nothing really revealing here. The theatrical trailer and a vintage cartoon short, ""Curtain Razor"" are included, along with the audio-only radio adaptation.

5. ""Torch Song"" (1953) has become a cult classic...and not in a good way. Crawford came back to MGM for this one film, her first technicolor feature. Originally it was to be a Lana Turner vehicle, but she wisely turned it down. Joan plays Jenny Stewart a (surprise!) tough Broadway star used to getting things her way. This all changes when a blind piano accompanist (Michael Wilding) enters her life and tries to change her. Fairly predictable, with an embarassingly quick and bad finale (the only thing missing from making it a total disaster is the lead character getting his sight back!). Joan looks fantastic and does the best that she can with a very trite script. Sadly, her singing is dubbed by India Adams. Although interesting, but somewhat cruel, the extras include her original recording sessions. The voice is good, but off a little in pitch and at times, support. Had this been more than a B-Grade musical cashing in on the Crawford name, surely some time could have been spent to pick songs that she was more comfortable with. Many campy elements and all the earmarkings of a film that was put together rather cheaply and quickly. A sad return for the former Queen of the Lot. There is also absolutely zero chemistry between Wilding and Crawford. The featurette ""Tough Baby: TorchSong"" is probably the best of the featurettes on this set, as it reveals what did (and didn't) go into the making of this movie. Very sad to hear Joan cursing herself as she is unable to get the desired results in her vocal recordings. The vintage film ""Jimmy Fund Public Service Announcement"" is a little creepy; Crawford is seen putting the kids to sleep (as they shot out ""Good Night Mommie"" with the soundtrack of the ""Wizard of Oz"" playing in the background. This is a film to promote donations to a children's cancer facility in Boston. The other extras include a theatrical trailer and vintage cartoon ""TV of Tomorrow.""

For the price, this set is a good value, and it would be hard to imagine buying these films separately as a result. The picture and sound quality are good overall...even the 1934 Sadie McKee. Still, the lackluster short featurettes are a little disappointing, and the vintage cartoons are also a little annoying as they don't really have much to do with Joan. Hopefully future box sets will have more related extras that delve a little deeper into the archives. NOTE: Although some other reviews show that all the movies are ""color/bw"" only ""Torch Song"" is actually in color. What the color/bw refers to are the documentary featurettes and vintage cartoons. This is what happens when you blindly copy info from a pre-release website.",1203292800,12,8549,4.8795595320027525
3239001,5,B000XNZ7NO,"Excellent cross section of Crawford's films from the period 1934-1953. A spectrum of good performances that show how she was evolving as an actress and a star is captured on 5 discs that have been rather meticulously preserved with only very minor scratching on some.

She shines as ""Sadie Mckee"", she's edgy as a hard luck dame with Clark Gable in ""Strange Cargo"", she's great as a scarred blackmailer in the melodramatic ""A Woman's Face"", then the Crawford we've come to really know faces off with dirty politics in ""Flamingo Road"" and dominates the Technicolor musical drama ""Torch Song"". She does a little bit of everything in these films and shows why she earned ""star"" status, maintained legions of fans over the years and still impresses fans today.
