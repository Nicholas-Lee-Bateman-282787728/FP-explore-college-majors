Halfway through the video the tape went black, and the section with Charles Coburn singing the September Song was missing.
You required a star rating.  I gave it one star since it was required.
I am very happy that these matters were handled to my complete satisfaction and I continue to purchase products you offer.
If by chance, you can come up with a copy of the original, I would be happy to purchase it.",1391212800,,533,4.541666666666667
7938269,1,B00005IBNV,"As a Nelson Eddy fan who was looking forward to seeing this movie for the first time, I must say, I have never been as disappointed in a movie as this one.  But my disappointment had nothing to do with the storyline or singing.  The quality of the VHS produced by Palm Beach Entertainment is so terrible it is hard to say if either the plot or singing are good. Let me add here, that the copy of this movie which I bought on Amazon was received in what appeared to be factory sealed condition and was listed as a NEW (as opposed to Used) video.  The seller has assured me it was ""new"", so the flaws I am noting below are not the result of an overused rental, etc.

The Palm Beach Entertainment video contrast is extremely dark & the picture image is distorted & flat (as if it is a copy of a copy of an originally poor copy).  The sound is muffled & there is a scratchy background noise throughout that makes dialog and song lyrics hard to understand.  If that isn't bad enough, in the middle of the movie, the picture & sound is lost completely; the screen goes black for several long seconds & when the movie return, it is to a completely different scene & dialog from where it left off, leaving the viewer to wonder what & how much is missing.  When this movie was released in 1944, it was listed as being 85 mins. long.  The Palm Beach Entertainment version is listed as 71 mins.  So something is definitely missing. This version of the movie has the look & sound of an early 1920s talkie, instead of a film produced in 1944 when film & cameras were capable of good quality movies.  Whereever this version of the movie came from it is of such disgraceful quality it should never have been allowed to be sold commercially.  I do not know if other versions of this movie exist or if they would be of better quality than the Palm Beach Entertainment version.  But I can not recommend this version to anyone...not even a die-hard Nelson Eddy fan.",1237593600,13,1946,4.315934065934066
