I am a huge fan of this show when you order you will get two tapes with great episodes on each of them.  If  you are a big fan you should check out the other videos that Amazon.com has  to offer for this show like, The Best of the Wonder Years which has the  last eposiode in its entirty and clips for the whole running of the sitcom.  Also The Original Pilot & Swinger, My Fathers Office & Angel, and  The Holiday Episodes which makes a great christmas gift.  But this set  today!",961286400,4,594,4.051724137931035
6729511,5,B00O97HZ3A,I first saw this in the 1980's and I was hooked from day one.  There had never been a show quite like it before and there hasn't been since.  Fred Savage was one of the most talented kid actors around at that time and it was just a delight to watch him express himself and to see him interact with girlfriend Winnie Cooper.  Not only was he great but the entire cast.  I had it all on video but now hopefully I can enjoy the complete show on DVD.  Thanks for bringing this out.,1435017600,,477,4.031914893617022

6729527,4,B00O97HZ3A,"The Wonder Years. I've loved it ever since its debut after the 1988 Winter Olympics. My brother and I have always wondered if the creators of the show were following us around with a notepad and 8mm camera as we grew up in the 1960s, secretly embedding themselves in our home and school. The writers nailed the times we lived in and our family dynamic down to the last detail! I mean, we could relate to almost everything in the Arnold family (except their lack of Christian faith and Wayne the bully brother -- although Wayne is typical of school bullies in that era), and the show perfectly depicted the way we thought, talked, and acted back in the day, even though they occasionally got the clothing fashions (not enough bell-bottom jeans) and boys' hairstyles (no guy I knew in high school in 1972-73 had hair that wasn't at least grown over his ears, if not longer) wrong. The movie Miracle with Kurt Russell was far more consistently accurate in that regard in case you're interested. The Wonder Years certainly captured the zeitgeist, that's for sure. No, more than that. Somebody managed to take zeitgeist air and soil samples from each year in the 1968-1973 timeline and let them out a little at a time with each episode! This show brought back a mindset, memories, feelings -- good, bad, happy, and painful -- whenever I'd watch it. Did I mention I liked it?

On to the technical aspects of this DVD set.  Time Life did an okay job, but not a great job.  The picture quality isn't terrible, but it's not fantastic, either.  The slightly edited versions of the series that I recorded onto blank DVDs off the HUB Channel are actually a little crisper with more vibrant colors and overall picture.  So I'll have to give the visual quality only three stars.  Like I said, it's not bad, but it could be better.  Audio's good, but again, my homemade DVDs off of HUB have the songs mixed a little louder with more prominence, which is important to me.  On the plus side, of course, all the episodes are uncut.  You get all the scenes you remember when they first aired on ABC.  However, and this is a big ""however,"" some of the songs have been edited.  And herein lies my major beef with this set:

THE MUSIC!  They did a pretty good job of getting most of the originals, but for me, The Wonder Years is really a case of all or nothing.  Season One is advertised on the cover as having ALL the original songs.  That's mostly true, sort of.  Here's what I mean:

In the episode titled ""The Phone Call,"" the familiar theme from the movie Romeo and Juliet is replaced with a tune I don't recognize.  I know it sounds picky, but it really does change the feel of the scenes in which it's featured.  I believe the writers and directors of each episode chose the music carefully to fit and enhance the mood.  Take away their original choices and you mostly kill the mood.  That's what happens in this episode.

The episode titled ""Dance With Me"" is a welcome improvement over the Netflix version.  Some key songs are restored in this episode during the scene where Kevin's family members demonstrate dance moves for him and Paul.  ""The Girl From Ipanema"" is restored for Jack and Norma's cheek-to-cheek dance, and ""Louie Louie"" by the Kingsmen is restored for Wayne's macho dance.  I'm very grateful for that.  Now for the major klinkers.  During the scene where Kevin and Lisa exchange notes, leading up to Kevin's asking ""the best-smelling head of hair in the seventh grade"" to go to the dance with him, Joe Cocker's version of ""The Letter"" is replaced with an earlier version of that song.  So technically it is the ""original"" song, but Cocker's version is the one that should be there because it fits better comically.  Cocker's version is much more passionate and insistently sexual.  His over-the-top rendition is a great comic counterpoint to the comparatively innocent ritual of passing puppy love notes in class.  That hilarious nuance is swept away by substituting the earlier, tamer version of the song.  Another less-than-satisfying substitute concerns the song ""There's A Kind Of Hush.""  If I'd never seen the original broadcast or the syndicated reruns it might not matter.  But I have!  So replacing the Herman's Hermits version of the song with another band's version is somewhat jarring to me, although it is a vast improvement over the lame replacement tune they had for the beginning of Paul and Carla's first dance in the Netflix version.

I also have a couple musical nits to pick with a couple of Season Two episodes.  In the very first episode, ""Heart Of Darkness,"" the Doors' ""Riders On The Storm"" is replaced with the song ""Children of the Night"" by a Doors tribute band.  Inexplicably, Netflix keeps the original ""Riders On The Storm"" while the DVD version does not.  I'm left scratching my head!  ""Riders On The Storm"" is obviously the better choice because it's much more recognizable and sets the mood far better.  Getting the rights to all the originals (especially from the Doors' label) must be a real bear, and I do sympathize, but really, folks, let's try to get the whole playlist in line if and when this gets the Blu Ray treatment (and while you're at it, work on improving the visual quality)!

The other Season Two episode that disappoints somewhat is ""How I'm Spending My Summer Vacation.""  Again, this is an improvement over the Netflix version, but there are still a couple of lame substitutions that are more or less scene-killers.  First the good news:  All the original tunes for the annual Cooper barbecue are intact -- ""Smoke Gets In Your Eyes"" by the Platters, ""Never on Sunday"" by the Chordettes, and ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" by the Flamingos -- all there.  This is a significant improvement over Netflix where the only original that survived was the Flamingos tune.  But the DVD version still substitutes ""Theme From 'A Summer Place'"" by the Percy Faith Orchestra with a bland and unsatisfying sound-alike at the beginning of the episode, and, the lamest substitution of all -- some really hokey sophomoric home-grown sound-alike tune stands in for the Doors' classic, ""Light My Fire,"" during Kevin's shower scene.  I mean, that's almost an unforgivable sin!  Again, I'm suspecting the Doors' label must be hard to deal with, but I'm pleading with the producers of this DVD set (or anybody else who might pick up the distribution rights in the future) -- please try again, and try harder, will ya'?  This is one of my favorite episodes!  For now I'll have to settle for watching my off-the-airways DVD recording of ""How I'm Spending My Summer Vacation.""  They really didn't cut much good stuff out of the syndicated version of that episode anyway!

I am glad the original Joe Cocker version of the Beatles' ""A Little Help From My Friends"" has been restored for the opening credits.  Neflix has some weird, bland doppelganger for the opening.  It sounds kind of like Cocker, but confidence is high that it's some Cocker impressionist.  Kudos for snagging the original again for the DVD!

All in all this two season set is a very good effort when it comes to the music, but it's not perfect, and here's why that matters as far as I'm concerned:  The Wonder Years by its very nature is not an ""any tune will do to set the mood"" type of show.  It's the very familiarity of the songs, the fact that we know them so well, that gives any given scene its comedic or dramatic punch.  Take away the familiarity and you take away the punch.  The version of any given song matters as well.  Believe it or not, as I said earlier, it does alter the comic sense of a scene or the mood of a scene when you substitute a different version of ""The Letter"" for Cocker's, or a different version of ""There's A Kind Of Hush"" for Herman's Hermits'.  Don't ask me why, it just does!  I hope someday they'll be able to get everything in line.

So I give this set four stars for the show being uncut with every scene intact, with one star subtracted for the video quality.  Like I said, I got slightly better quality off the airwaves, even though the syndicated versions have some content cuts which annoy me.  I give it three stars for the music.  It's mostly there, but agonizingly in some places, not all there.  Four stars overall.  I don't regret buying it because I don't like the content edits that happen with the syndies.  But I do wish they'd get it absolutely perfect someday!",1423440000,8,8410,4.64276048714479

6729538,4,B00O97HZ3A,"I hadn't seen the show in years and it remains as good as I remmember it when it first came out. The DVD presentation does leave a lot to be desired. Video and sound are basically VHS quality. There are no subtitles or alterante languages. Hard to understand when you consider the Batman 1960s show was just released remastered to HD and has a price tag in the mid $100s.
The first two seasons for fortysomething dollars seem reasonable enough but I can't imagine people paying three or four hundred for the entirety of the series, especially with such mediocre presentation.",1418947200,4,575,4.702970297029703

I must admit that I did purchase the complete ""wonder years"" several years ago thru the ""I offer"" site and the package came from China. These were recorded off a computer from youtube but the picture and sound quality are pristine. They actualy look even better then the newly released sets from Time Warner/Star vista althogh there is absolutly nothing wrong with them. Anyway,this show is fantastic viewing for anyone. Theres plenty of laughs,some drama and every once in a while a little intrigue.

6729544,5,B00O97HZ3A,"I have to say I'm getting tired of reading the reviews by people who say the picture quality is bad or substandard. They are completely wrong.

I bought the set of the first two seasons of ""The Wonder Years"" at Costco, having bought Season 1 at Amazon first. I can assure the readers of this review that the picture quality is excellent, and absolutely the best this show has ever looked. No, it's not Blu-ray, so for those who say this series should have been ""updated for high-definition televisions,"" that is a ridiculous comment-- DVDs are and always were meant for tube/CRT televisions, never for HD televisions. The show was not shot in high-definition, which didn't exist in 1988, and this offering is a DVD, not a Blu-ray. Which you knew before you made the purchase.

Second, for those of you complaining about lines going down the middle of the screen, both black lines and white lines, which are actually white dots, that is only in the opening montage with the opening credits. That's it. AND, guess what, as every long-time viewer of this show knows, that was all done ON PURPOSE. That opening sequence is meant to look like an old 8mm film, as if it was someone's home movie of that time period, 1968.  Understand, that was intentional, and it was ALWAYS that way from the very first season in 1988. My God, just look at the shape and footprint of the opening sequence-- it is smaller than the regular-size frame of the remainder of the show, and it has rounded corners, for goodness' sake, just like an old 8mm home movie.

However, once each new episode begins (after the opening credits), the film becomes much sharper and of a much higher quality. Again, just as in 1988, but this DVD set is just a little bit sharper and better.  Clearly, this DVD set WAS remastered, and these DVDs have excellent picture quality, better than any Wonder Years episodes that we viewed in 1988 or 1990-- not much better, but clearly a little better. I would rate the picture quality as being about excellent for this TV show, I'd call it a 9 out of 10.  Most other TV shows made at the same time, that may look better today on DVD, were shot on video, which is inherently much sharper than film.  Or, even if on film, other TV shows from that time were meant to look newer. This TV show, conversely, was always meant to look a little bit less than brand-new-- evidently, to invoke feelings of nostalgia.

Regarding everything else about this DVD set, this is a 10+.  The Time-Life/Star Vista people who put together this DVD set obviously did it with a lot of love for this TV show, its characters, producers, writers, and actors.

There really isn't much more to say. This was a unique, memorable TV series for the ages, and this DVD set more than does it justice. As there is no reason to expect a Blu-ray offering, this will be the best picture quality we can get. But, again, the picture quality is excellent, and those of you who are judging each entire 23-minute episode by just the opening montage, which was MEANT to look old, grainy, and amateur-home-movie-ish, you simply don't know what you're talking about.",1415664000,39,3120,4.585278276481149
6729545,5,B00O97HZ3A,"Have been waiting forever for these to be released! Just like I remember them.  Quality isn't as clear as newly produced shows, no complaints here, though.",1415059200,2,155,4.961538461538462
6729546,3,B00O97HZ3A,"I have been waiting for The Wonder Years to be released ever since they started putting television shows on DVD.  This is one of my all time TV favorites.  When it ended I had it on VHS and watched it over and over again.  I can recite the dialogue and it got so that when I heard a 70's song on the radio I could visualize the scene it was featured in.  By the way, the person that said he didn't understand the big deal about the original music must not be a music fan.  This show is as much about the music as the writing, the story lines, the acting...all of it.  The music IS the show,  It sets the emotion of the scenes.  So imagine how highly disappointed I was when I discovered that, contrary to what the advertising and packaging says, all the music is NOT the original. (How can you replace Light My Fire by the Doors?  You can't.)  Another disappointment is the quality of the video. It is very grainy.  Why couldn't they have enhanced the video?  The best I can say is that I didn't spend a lot on it; I got the 1st and 2nd season set at Costco for $29.00.  I've seen advertising for the complete series for over $200.  As much as a fan as I am, and much as I don't want to ""dis"" this set, I would recommend not spending that kind of money on this kind of quality.  If you like the series get this at Costco (sorry Amazon.)  I've always hated when people didn't review a movie for its content, but really, those that are familiar with the show know the quality of it.  Unfortunately this is a case where I have to review based on matters other than content.",1414713600,17,1570,4.128712871287129
6729547,4,B00O97HZ3A,"So I've finished watching the first 2 seasons of Wonder Years and have the following comments and ratings to make. First of all, there seems to be too much attention made over the music rights, most of music clips are great to hear but are only 15 - 30 seconds long. Secondly, Winnie Cooper, one of the cutest girls of all time, is only featured in 7 of the 23 episodes, wanted to see more of her. And thirdly, Wayne is so mean, cruel and unlikeable in all of his appearances, there is just no redeeming qualities in his character to have any sympathy for him. The extra features are basically commentaries on the episodes we've just seen, the interviews are repetitive with similar observations in both seasons, and seem to ramble on for too long, and Daniel Stern's long wiry beard makes him look like a Willie Nelson clone. Overall I'm giving it 4 stars, but I remember the later seasons got a lot better.

Note on the VIDEO QUALITY: You have to understand that TV shows produced in the late 1980's & 1990's were filmed, sometimes on 16mm instead of 35mm, then transferred to analogue video tape for editing. Thus the final edit of the episodes are on analogue video tape. So unless the original camera film negatives are re-transfered to HD Video and re-edited to match the original edits (like Star Trek TNG, Seinfeld, That 70's Show), this is the best it will look.
I notice that there is no continuity to the run times of each show, which indicates if a song was cut out.

As far as the show itself, Fred Savage & Danica McKellar give amazing performances as Kevin & Winnie. Every subtle nuance of their personalities is perfectly portrayed. The stories themselves capture the 1960's era perfectly. The original music included is essential to the mood of the show and thankfully most of it is here.

This is much more affordable than the cheaply packaged complete series sold at Time-Life's website.",1412812800,31,2882,4.923711340206186

8682662,5,B00O97HZ3A,"""The Wonder Years"" Remains One Of My Favourite Television Series Of All Time. Before I Received My Copy Of The Series On DVD I Had Not Seen The Show Since It Originally Screened On Television Many Years Ago- I Wondered If The Show Would Live Up To My High Expectations- I'm Happy To Say That After Recent Viewing, ""The Wonder Years"" Exceeded My Very Fond Memories! The Series Contains Many Timeless Storylines That Deal With The Trials & Tribulations Of Growing Up; Each Episode Is Delivered With The Help Of An Insightful & Humorous Adult Narrator- And Add To This Mix The Wonderful Music From The Late 1960's, Amazing!

I Purchased ""The Wonder Years"" In A Boxed Set That Contained ""Series One"" And ""Series Two""- I'm Very Glad That I Did So. ""Season One"" Contains Only 6 Episodes! This Helps To Explain Why ""Series One"" Contains Lots Of ""Bonus Features""- Mainly Fresh Interviews With The Cast Looking Back. Fortunately ""Series Two"" Contains 17 Episodes. Nevertheless, This Boxed Set Only Contains A Combined Total Of 23 Episodes.

If You Are Interested In Owning ""The Wonder Years"" On DVD Then I Highly Recommend Purchasing The ""Series 1 & 2 Boxed Set"", So You Get A Reasonable Number Of Episodes To Watch And Make Your Purchase Worthwhile.",1437955200,3,1241,4.794392523364486
