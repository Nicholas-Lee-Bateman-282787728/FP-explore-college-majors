True, it isn't the most original thing around, but then, few cyberpunk films are.  What I generally look for in a cyberpunk film is interesting characters and computer graphics, rather than an original plot.  I already KNOW it's going to be about an evil mega-corporation or AI trying to take over the world, and a lone hacker or group of rebels trying to stop it.  I already KNOW that the world I'm going to see onscreen will be over-crowded and dreary.  It's not originality of plot I'm looking for, but interesting execution.

""Cyber Wars"" delivers on that.  Genevieve O'Reilly is likeable and interesting in the lead part, and of course David Warner is always great.  Some of the other actors are mediocre, at best, but I didn't mind.  I thoroughly enjoyed the world the filmmaker created.  The computer effects were above average, and at times very beautiful.

My biggest complaint about the film was that the ""evil plot"" was a bit vague, and frankly didn't frighten me much.  I had a hard time distinguishing between ""The Game"" and the manipulation of politics and markets that giant corporations already do every day (or so I suspect).

But after having recently watched a number of appalling ""cyber"" films recently, I have to say this one is very high up in the genre.",1150675200,8,1296,4.732142857142857

In fact, `Cyber War' (aka `Avatar' in some countries) comes from Singapore, but slight curiosity generated from the locations aside, there is nothing I can recommend about this awfully boring version of cyber world.

Genevieve O'Reilly (who had been in two sequels of Joel Silver's mega-hit `Matrix', according to IMDb, but sorry, I cannot remember) plays Dash MacKenzie, licensed bounty hunter in the near-future world of Sintawan, Asian city where the IDs of the citizens are registered in the city's Cyber Link. Dash gets money from her clients, hunting down those who have got fake IDs (called SIM), assisted through cyber space by her friend Julius (Kay Siu Lim).

One day Dash is asked to find out the hiding place of a CEO who knows the top secrets about the SIM. She succeeds, but things get complicated because a dedicated police detective Victor (Luoyong Wang) suspects that some insidious schemes are going on among the `game players' of the city including David Warner and Joan Chen.

The `futuristic' world is represented by the existing buildings and landscapes of Singapore. Occasionally the images created by special effects are added to them, but the effects are at best OK. The quality of each CGI is acceptable if not perfect, but the sheer lack of originality in the story and the concept of cyber (or alternative) world damages the film fatally. Everything you see here can be seen in the recent sci-fi films using cyber world theme such as `Dark City,'`The Thirteenth Floor,' or 'Matrix' all of which used it much more effectively.

But it is awfully flat storytelling of the director that really killed the film. Despite its title, `Cyber War' can create no sense of impending danger. Things are told in by-the-number way, sometimes paying almost no attention to the continuity of the story, and the end results are the so-so images showing no emotional or intellectual power. To make matters worse, the heroine has no charisma of Carrie-Anne, and the actions (not many) are often poorly executed.

`Cyber War' has a pretty cool DVD cover, and that's exactly the best thing you can find in the film. Except for that (and the unique locations) the film is only a poorly-done version of borrowed ideas from any cyber world films you have seen in the last decade.",1146268800,7,2449,4.905797101449275
8108238,1,B000EBGFRM,"Although it may have hit theatres some place, this looks like a straight-to-DVD film.  I saw a trailer for it somewhere and thought it might be interesting.  OKI was wrong.

In the future the worldor at least the part of it depicted here, which seems to be somewhere in Asiais controlled by a small group of corporate leaders playing an elaborate game, which involves not only manipulating people, but manipulating the appearance of reality as well.  The cyber-world has so inter-penetrated the real world that it has become almost impossible to tell the difference.

If you had thought about watching the Matrix series but never did because---whateverbecause 3 movies seemed like too much, or you were afraid there would be too many ideas to handle, or the acting would be too intense or whatever, heres your opportunity to watch a really dumbed-down Matrix story.  Yes the acting was lame in the Matrix series, but rest assured, this is lamer.  Not to mention the script, dialog, pacing or pretty much anything else.  Perhaps this should be called Cyber Bores.

Somewhere around 60% of the way through, I stopped even caring how it was going to end :-(",1442966400,,1154,4.846938775510204

8108241,1,B000EBGFRM,I had heard of this movie and thought I would try it out.  Whoever wrote the critique of this film must have been paid.  Boring!  I paid almost nothing for it and got my money's worth.,1394668800,,184,4.055555555555555
8108242,5,B000EBGFRM,"In Order To Like This Movie, One Has To Really Like Virtual Reality Movies. I Love This Movie As All Virtual Reality Movies. Need I Say More ? lol",1366416000,,146,4.068965517241379
8108243,5,B000EBGFRM,"I watch it on a program that I use on my TV and then they took it off for a while so I couldn't find it. I forgot the name and for months I hunted it then Amazon listed it in one of a group selection. and bang it was on my order list. I really enjoy the theme behind the whole story and Genevieve O'Reilly did a great job in her part. I would like to see her in more movies. Cyber Wars had great action scenes, fantastic futuristic devices like those dragon fly spys, most governments probably started working on prototypes. I love the Orient so it added to my enjoyment. This movie was a real trip and I hope some sequal will show up soon. It had a great cast of Actors that helped build the movie but Genevieve did what was needed to bring success in my thoughts to it. Now the cridits might not have liked it but lets face fact critics are just that critics and not us who watch the movies and determine if we like it or not so why don't we do away with these people who probably have ruined hundreds of moves because of what they like which from the way they call the shoot I wonder if they like themselves !!",1345075200,,1113,4.018018018018018
8108244,1,B000EBGFRM,"You know, the really bad ones you have to sit through because your son or daughter has a part in it? Whoever this Dash what's-her-name actress is, I believe could be voted as one of the worse performances in a stupid, inane, boring and lifeless film. I mean, she really sucks. Special effects - laughable. I think I remember seeing the old man in TRON. And the little dude in the bar from ""The Blade Runner."" The interaction between characters really does border on truly amateurish. Someone mentioned a 4 million dollar budget? Sounds about right. Don't waste tour time or money on this clunker.",1219968000,,596,4.685714285714286
8108245,4,B000EBGFRM,"I first saw this movie back in January. I have seen it on cable about 4 times so decided maybe I should own it. I've seen it twice already. What attracts me to it, is the individual performences and seeing Joan Chen and David Warner. Gosh, I've missed seeing them in movies. The story isn't that oridignal, but I didn't pay that much attention to it. Seeing  the interaction between all of the characters and the  hint of a future plot is more than enough to keep me fixed on the screen.
If you want a nice, warm fuzzy movie to watch this weekend, go get Cyber Wars.",1218499200,,566,4.231481481481482
8108246,3,B000EBGFRM,"My favorite part about this film were the futuristic ideas. The way Dash visually surfed through computer files. The interesting cybernetic adaptions. The idea of being able to tell your phone to turn off, and not allow incoming calls. That would be handy. I was amazed to see the entire budget was about $4 million. The effects in this movie are more than adequate if compared to some bigger-budget movies.",1161993600,3,407,4.828571428571428
8108247,3,B000EBGFRM,I saw a preview of Cyber Wars while viewing another DVD. The visuals looked good so I ordered it. I was not disappointed.,1156464000,2,121,4.304347826086956
