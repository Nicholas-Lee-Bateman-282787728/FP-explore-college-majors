8290179,5,B001CW7ZWQ,"What could be better than zombies on DVD? How about zombies on blur ray. If you like to watch head shots and flesh ripping normally, you are going to die (pun intended) for it on Bluray! As for The Thing, it seems that the Bluray actually makes it colder! maybe because you can see all of the snowflakes. Anyway, buy this product. You won't regret it.",1259712000,,351,4.333333333333333
8290180,5,B001CW7ZWQ,"All of these movies look good on blu-ray. John Carpenters The Thing is among them and one of my favorites. Not much for special features on some of the discs, but the picture quality is very nice.",1254268800,,196,4.324324324324325

8290183,5,B001CW7ZWQ,I loved getting three blu-ray movies for less than the cost of one blu-ray alone. All three were freakin fabulous but the Thing...just classic awsomeness. LOVED. IT.,1233792000,,165,5.148148148148148
8290184,4,B001CW7ZWQ,"Great value pack of three must have movies for the Horror aficionado. For me The Thing is the greatest horror flick ever made but the inclusion of the modern day Classic Day Of The Dead and Romero's Land Of The dead make it an essential purchase.
The only thing that stops it getting full marks is the fact that there are virtually no special features on two of the discs.",1225584000,2,372,4.328571428571428
