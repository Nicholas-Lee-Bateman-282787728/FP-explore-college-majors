8130748,2,B000GDI2JM,"This video wasn't that cool. The quality sucked and the sound quality of the actual interviewees was horrible! I felt like someone made this with their home camera and nothing else. You definitely would have to be a pretty big drifting fan to appreciate the low quality of this dvd but if you are, then hey, it's great for you. There were some cool parts but overall, this wasn't worth the purchase and definitely wasn't what I expected.",1335052800,,437,4.615384615384615
