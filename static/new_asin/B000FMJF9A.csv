Reviewing music/art is much different than writing a technical review on, say, the performance of a piece of audio equipment.  Possibly telling something about the music reviewer may be helpful to the reader to decide on any common ground to support the review.  To that end, my tastes in music span many genres.  This is probably due to my love of music, studying classical piano at an early age, later performing as a DJ, audio engineer/mixer, audiophile, radio station DJ, sound system designer, and audio hardware designer.  Over some decades, this allowed me to hear and appreciate a wide range of music from classical to rock, easy listening, popular, jazz, funk, folk, new age, dubstep, electronic, country, bossa nova, dance, and more.  Good music can exist in most all genres and may vary with one's mood, for sure, yet my preference now leans to the uplifting.  My conclusion is that music should help us escape to a better place.

So why do I give Sandy & Junior 5 stars for this performance?  First because they are true musicians.  In some ways, I'm reminded of American music of the 50's to the 70's before it became overly commercialized and made to fit some formula as it generally is now.  Their honesty comes through--they enjoy what they do and care about their fans.  Fans aren't assaulted with vulgar/trash lyrics but instead lyrics that express deeper, and still innocent, feelings of young people.  Technically, and especially for young performers, they sing, dance, and play various instruments confidently well beyond their years.  Melody, rhythm and performance come together nicely in songs that cover a variety of styles.  Sandy has an angelic voice and uses it very well; Junior sings well and shows his talent on drums and other instruments.  This is a very impressive live performance in front of an audience of 70,000 which is never let down, and I'm sure leaves feeling good after the performance in Maracana.  Production quality and recording are very good for a live venue as are the visuals.

The music could be compared with the Beach Boys, The Bee Gees, The Carpenters, Abba, and some others yet sometimes with a dose of smooth jazz and of course Brazilian pop flavor.  A part of me was transported back to feel those young years time of my life even though that was before their time.  Sandy and Junior have both grown more accomplished in their abilities since this performance, performing separately.  I can only hope that Sandy continues to make her style of pure, uplifting, quality music with Junior and the support of her family.  Lovely!",1437177600,,2831,4.854166666666667
