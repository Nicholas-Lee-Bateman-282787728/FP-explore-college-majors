8032749,5,B0002VEPG2,"A nice addition to you rotation Tae Bo workout. You don't need the bar, just hand weights and you are good to go, or none at all.
Both DVDs are 40 mins long (actual workout) and 5 mins cool down at the end-which I don't have time for. A solid 40 mins of ab work, I have only worked out on this once and I woke up sore, even though am very fit and Tae Bo 6 days a day. I can wait to see my abs pop up more in a month or so, I already have abs from Abs Bootcamp DVD, but I needed a change of routine. My butt too is aching this morning but I call that sweet pain and am going in for more today.
Great workouts, fun music. The 40 mins really goes by so fast! Make that, 80 mins for me.",1478822400,,682,3.614864864864865

I'm am so pleased because I've been looking a long time for this DVD set, because it has the best glute workout I have ever had. This is also my first shipment and I am pleased.

8032751,4,B0002VEPG2,"I get such compliments on my abs and especially my butt. I used to dislike Mr.
Blank's dvds, but they've improved over the years. Now I can ""drop it like a top""!",1379635200,,161,4.0625
8032752,5,B0002VEPG2,"Great Tae Bo workout that does not have a lot of jumping around, just focusing on abs on one dvd and legs and bun on the other.",1345507200,,127,3.740740740740741
8032753,4,B0002VEPG2,"There's some sort of Tae Bo rule that the second video in a series is a lighter workout than the first.  That rule holds true for Cardio Circuit 2.

The classic moves are here, with the occasional twist for variety like new combinations and added footwork.  As in Cardio Circuit 1, the video goes through a progression of warm-up, ab circuit (using twisting moves and standing leg lifts, etc.), upper body circuit, lower body, more abs, total body circuit, and cool-down.  As in all Tae Bo, you'll find knee lifts, punches, kicks, squats, and lots of ab-builders at a pace meant to be aerobically challenging.  This video is geared towards Basic level.

Billy will never get less than 3 stars from me, because Tae Bo is just the most solid, honest workout out there.  What I didn't like about this one is the choppiness.  For some reason, on the ab and lower-body circuits he splits up slow and fast sets, ie you do a slow set on one side, slow on the other side, and then one fast set each side.  So you're bored and then scrambling to keep up, bored then scrambling to keep up.  By the time I get set up for the second side fast set, it's done and I've missed the boat.  That's frustrating and also means that in the end, I've not worked out as hard as with the first one.  I also don't like the music as much as the first.

Overall, it works as a change-up from other Tae Bo videos, which is what I use it for.  If you have to choose, though, get Cardio Circuit 1 or Tae Bo Cardio (in the blue box), especially if you're new to Tae Bo.  In which case, you're still in for a great workout, no matter what you choose!",1112918400,4,1618,4.259016393442623
