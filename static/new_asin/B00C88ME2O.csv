Yetis was a fun movie to watch, and I think if you like independent movies you will enjoy it.
I had a lot more fun watching Vampire Ticks from Outer Space though. Despite the small budget I found it really entertaining, I liked the story, and it had an ending that I have never seen done before.
Altogether very worth it!",1457654400,,507,4.404255319148936
8578646,5,B00C88ME2O,Love the stories and the fun the people in the films seem to be having.  Would like to see these films made with a big budget.,1392076800,,126,3.8461538461538463
8578647,4,B00C88ME2O,"ok, so the effects are bad, but the storylines are neat. Yetis had a horrible suit, and i wish they had put more money into it. vampire ticks was actualy pretty good, you have to look past a fishing line or two though.",1382313600,,218,4.093023255813954
8578648,2,B00C88ME2O,"I gave both of the movies a benefit of doubt (I collect bigfoot movies so would have to have this regardless.) Ticks is by far the best of these two (not saying that much) in at least it moves at a decent pace & they attempted special effects (the ticks look like brown rubber gloves with fruit punch in them.)

""Yetis"" easily ranks up there with one of the dumbest bigfoot movies ever made. Horrid acting, sound, editing, script, and one of the most pathetic bigfoot costumes you will ever see make up this time waster. If you aren't a diehard collector, there is absolutely no reason to watch this.

The 2 stars is for Ticks. Yetis is a zero star if there ever was one.",1375833600,,671,4.317460317460317
