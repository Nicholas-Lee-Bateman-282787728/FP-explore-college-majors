First of all, they are *full* of drills, so it's a worthy expenditure.  You're not paying for a bunch of filler, you are buying a good amount of knowledge.

I think what I especially liked was the clear practicality of the exercises.  The training was not biased toward ""traditional"" vs ""MMA"" like so many things are, there were students demonstrating who have backgrounds in many different styles.  What was great was that the drills give you a key to understanding how to make your system WORK in a real scenario.  Not the kind of scenario where people square off with their hands up after talking trash, but the kind where you might be attacked suddenly and by surprise, or where you have to get out of a tight spot.  I actually gained some new understanding about the type of drills that some traditional schools use, which seem contradicted by modern MMA science.  This work showed me the angles from which those trainings can be very practical.  Rory Miller also talks a bit about the places where many martial styles - both trad and modern - can go wrong, and develop ways of training that are unrealistic and impractical.

In my own martial arts practice and teaching, I'll be taking these drills and using them immediately.  Many of them fit with things I already do, and will help to round out missing pieces in my training.",1472083200,6,1421,4.595238095238095
7781114,5,B01H780HG4,"If you train or teach self defense Rory Miller's material is a must.
I have all of Rory Miller's books and videos and I think Training for Sudden Violence is his best work so far.
The hows and whys of the principles and techniques are clearly explained and then put into drills that will build functional skills.
I also liked Rory's explanation on how so many martial arts schools go wrong because of style inbreeding.",1470787200,2,418,4.586666666666667

8764824,5,B01H780HG4,"I love everything about this dvd and Rory millers books Ive already finish reading three of his books just order another!
The only issue I had was I order Rory miller joint lock dvd and they sent me the wrong one. So I returned it. I haven't reorder yet because I decided to buy another one of his books instead.
I guess I am a Rory miller junkie !",1521158400,,348,4.057971014492754
8764825,4,B01H780HG4,"Author Rory Miller has successfully made the jump from the printed page to the video screen with his two DVD set, based upon his book: Training for Sudden Violence.  Training for Sudden Violence: Drills (2016, YMAA Productions) has Miller and his team working through a variety of drills, situations, and instructions to those who want to take their training from the book to a more realistic setting.

 Miller, a former Corrections Officer and veteran self-defense instructor of multiple styles and levels, does very well in walking the viewer through what is needed to get out of messy situations.  Both DVD discs have some 16 sections, or chapters.  Disc one has such goodies as Targeting, Sumo Pushing, and Conditioning.  Disc two has such items as The Brawl, Bull in the Ring (a great endurance training), and Grappling.",1519603200,,825,5.029411764705882
8764826,5,B01H780HG4,I have only read part of the book but I already have implemented a drill out of it in my class.,1499904000,2,95,3.5714285714285716
8764827,5,B01H780HG4,"These videos are extremely useful for learning and teaching self-defense in real situations. There are many many clever ideas of drills, powerful trainings which are in addition very great fun to be performed.
I watch a lot of videos to catch ideas for my teaching and training and really these dvd are the most intelligent ones I ever saw: if I should have to choose only one set of videos this should be this one.
 One among many over interesting points is the fact that Miller doesn't teach any specific style of fighting, but a method which lets you do your own way of fighting. This is not a method ""if the guy does that you must do that"", this is a method which puts you directly in the context of a real and messy situation, that is at very close distance, and make you improve your spontaneous response on a sudden attacks.
 These drills will make you improving your ability to defend yourselves in a pedagogical way.  This has nothing to do with the context of a dojo or of a ring of any martial arts, but somewhere it helps you on the way of all martial arts final purpose, that is to develop a spontaneous response to any kind of aggressions in any contexts.
I blindfold recommend it! (Sorry for my bad English.)",1494115200,4,1223,4.426666666666667
8764828,5,B01H780HG4,"If you already have a back ground in self-defense. This drills can help as you keep learning.
Thanks Rory Miller for sharing your knowledge.",1484524800,3,140,4.875
8764829,5,B01H780HG4,"Once again, I feel that Rory Miller has provided an excellent guide on this subject, as he has with all of his other works.  I highly recommend this work to others that wish to learn much about how to deal with the possibility of sudden violence.  This dvd package offers both excellent video instruction along with excellent commentary.",1476057600,2,337,4.793103448275862
8764830,1,B01H780HG4,"I guess I should've expected what I got when I purchased at such a low price. This guy is a cardboard cut out of about 100+ guys out there teaching martial arts. Honestly dude, get over yourself. I don't belive there should be a charge for this dvd set, should be free on you tube.
It's gonna end up at a bargain bin at a dollar store and still overpriced, in my opinion.",1474848000,5,371,4.095890410958904
8764831,5,B01H780HG4,"I have always appreciated Rory Millers work.  There is always something to learn. The Training for Sudden Violence DVD is no exception. The laid back soft spoken attitude of Rory Miller is a misnomer of the amount of knowledge he has and the way he has with words. I especially like that he is carrying what looks like a cup of coffee throughout the whole DVD. Also Rory is trying really hard not to drop the F bomb which unfortunately he drops. If that will offend you, as Rory would put it get over it because you will be missing out on a lot of information that will make your art so much better.
This DVD is 180 minutes and covers fundamental and immediate drills including structure, targeting, off lining and much more. As always Rory has a vast number of training partners coming from different backgrounds such as Karate and Jiu-Jistu. No matter what the background, there is always a learning experience. The second DVD makes a mention of scenario training. This is something that Rory Miller addresses with extreme caution and does not make light of. I really took to this warning because scenario training or what I called scenario training is something that should be taken seriously. This was a real eye opener.
Rory created this DVD for more of a reference to the book. The book has goal oriented ideas that would not work well in the DVD. I would recommend purchasing the book as well.",1474761600,9,1400,4.6
8764832,5,B01H780HG4,"Training for Sudden Violence: Drills 2-DVD set contains many useful self-defense training drills that accurately mimic violent encounters.  The drills presented will appeal to self-defense instructors and both traditional and mixed martial artists.  The DVD pair is a must-have companion to the similarly titled book Training for Sudden Violence, which discusses even more of the exercises (72 to be exact).

Disk 1 mostly covers fundamentals of surviving violent encounters, such as structure for power/energy, initiative, conservation of motion/energy, targeting, offline stepping, etc.  Disk 2 contains a dozen or so more drills, including multiple assailants, stalking, and discussions on articulating what happened - how to speak about the incident in a legally smart manner.  Overall the drills presented by Rory provide structured practice and training drills for an otherwise chaotic (read: realistic) method of fighting.  The ""flow"" of real fighting is recreated through many of the drills, something that is not inherent in controlled sparring matches.  Rory's training drills also allow for the ""dirty"" of street fighting in a safe and controlled manner, including weapons, objects, and structures in the environment.

Rory's presentation is very relaxed (he even occasionally holds a cup of coffee during his presentations) and comforting, especially given the seriousness of the topic and potential for injury in some drills, yet he coveys his expertise in a no-BS manner.  Just like his writing style, Rory tells the viewer like it is.  If you enjoy his other publications, this one is a must have because not only does he demonstrate many of the drills discussed in his book, the drills are fun to watch and will make the viewer want to jump of the couch and give them a go.",1473897600,6,1789,5.334519572953736
