7810983,4,6301118332,"The 1988 Stretch & Tone (46 minutes) is adapted from Judi Sheppard Missett's ""Super Session"" and includes  a variety of muscle toning routines that concentrate on the hips, thighs, derriere, abdomen and upper torso.  The goal is to improve muscle tone for strength and endurance.  The workout is challenging as it clearly aims for the muscles!  It is focused, very well done and effective.  With the aid of 4 jazzercise instructors, we have the option of a ""lighter"" side workout and an option to include light weights.
The 7-mnute warm-up includes isolated movements while warming each section of the body, head, neck, shoulders, ribs, arms, pelvis, torso and feet.
The Stretch & Tone program begins with outer leg and hip work, abdominal workout, derriere and hip and inner thigh.  For the upper torso, Missett offers three levels of difficulty as leaders guide you for your chosen level of workout, but sometimes you can't always follow that leader as the camera angle prevents you from ""following"" that person.  A wonderful stretch routine ends the program.
Doing this workout is certainly intense and challenging, but with consistency, no doubt you will look and feel better.  Missett is highly qualified and one of the better leaders in the conglomerate of exercise instructors.  Surprisingly, Missett doesn't want you to ""feel the burn"" like other fitness experts push for.
If you want great muscle toning and stretching incorporated into your fitness program, try this one.  I am a firm believer in the Jazzercise founder Judi Sheppard Missett videotapes, they are challenging while done with precision, and while the tape is '88, it doesn't have that dated look... .....MzRizz.",1013299200,13,1686,5.142857142857143
