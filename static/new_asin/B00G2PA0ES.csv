6045281,1,B00G2PA0ES,"I didn't want to see this film, but I had no choice. i thought the male anatomy was something that couldn't be shown in an R-rated film. Boy, was I wrong. The male anatomy should be kept inside the pants. This film ranks with Scarface (1983) is being one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There were only a few genuinely funny moments. The scene with the fish was also disgusting. Don't waste your time viewing this garbage.",1384387200,10,426,4.405063291139241
6045282,5,B00G2PA0ES,"I just saw this movie yesterday and it was the funniest movie I have ever seen in my life.  I admit I like raunchy humor, but, to me, what really makes this movie hilarious are the real reactions from people. I was laughing until tears were streaming down my face and my stomach muscles hurt from laughing so hard all throughout the movie.  I had never seen a ""Jackass"" movie before, but I think Johnny Knoxville is a genius and the child actor playing his grandson was completely believable and brilliant. I want this movie in my permanent collection. Up to this point, Billy Bob Thornton's ""Bad Santa"" was my favorite all-time comedy, but this one is even better than Bad Santa. All the high jinks these two get into on their road trip are just hysterical. So, let loose and let yourself enjoy this with some big old belly laughs, people. It is such a hoot!",1384041600,4,859,4.464968152866242
6045283,3,B00G2PA0ES,"This film is disgustingly funny and wrong on so many levels. Grandpa (Johnny Knoxville) is saddled with young Billy (Jackson Nicoll) until Billie's mom (Georgina Cates) gets out of prison. Grandpa opts to pass on the kid to the biological father. This requires a road trip from Lincoln, Nebraska to Raleigh. The trip consists of skits and/or practical jokes. Grandpa did gags that looked like something Willi P. Richardson would do if he was being filmed, while Billy reminded me of the kid in Jimmy Kimmel gags.

Most of the supporting cast played themselves which made me believe some of these may have been actual stunts as the camera quality wasn't good. This is a film for those who enjoy low brow humor.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Male nudity.",1383436800,,747,4.828125
6045284,4,B00G2PA0ES,"It was last year when I went with my family to go see the reboot of ""The Three Stooges."" For the entire 5-10 minute car trip home, I could not stop laughing, to the point where I had to make myself focus on my breathing so I wouldn't choke. The point being, that was the last time I remember a movie making me laugh so riotously, and I thought it would take years for me to find another. Low and behold, Johnny Knoxville and the rest of the ""Jackass"" crew nearly made me pass out from laughter with their latest masterpiece of raunch.

""Bad Grandpa"" follows Irving, a crotchety old man who has recently been widowed, much to his delight. His aspirations of sleeping with everything living, breathing and female are cut short, however, by his daughter being sent to prison (again.) This wouldn't be a problem if she didn't have a son whose deadbeat father was across the country, but much to the grandfather's chagrin, that's precisely the case. And so begins a cross-country journey with Irving and eight year-old Billy, who can never quite seem to go anywhere without getting in some sort ridiculous antics. Whether it being trying to move Irving's dead wife from his trunk to a hotel room, or putting Billy in drag to win money in a child beauty pageant, the hijinks in this movie are among the best in a modern comedy.

What makes these moments even more special is that, for the most part, Knoxville and company made the very wise decision to stage this in a ""Borat""-like fashion. This means that all of the shocked, bewildered, and offended reactions you see on camera were not staged, which is surprising when taking into consideration some of the things that they get away with here. A funeral is crashed in the most heinously inappropriate way possible, a kiddie ride goes haywire and crashes through a store window, and a farting competition in a restaurant results in explosive wall defecation. Just when you think this movie can't get any more over the top, it winks at you and laughs, then does something completely unexpected and out of the blue. It keeps upping its own ante, which is exactly what makes these kinds of flicks work.

Even more of a delight is the fact that there is, believe it or not, a soul to this movie. The cross-country road trip with Irving and Billy is refreshingly touching at times, showing some of the signature heart that Knoxville typically displays in his non-""Jackass"" outings. The writers wisely stayed away from making fun of the mother and father's situation too much, probably realizing that this is a very real reality for many children. Instead, we get to see an old geezer and a reckless little boy duke it out, then realize over time that they actually are very fond of each other. It's pretty touching at times, and while it certainly isn't anything groundbreaking, it's still a sort of feel-good movie.

That isn't to say everything here is great. Some gags get overused a bit too much, such as Billy trying to pick up women for his grandfather, and the continuous usage of the dead grandmother prop. There are also occasionally jokes that just don't work that well, like Knoxville wrangling a fish that has a massive human penis. Also, it feels like the movie could have perhaps benefited from a slightly shorter running time, by about 10 minutes or so. Still, these are very minor complaints for a movie that is, by and large, one of the funniest I've seen.

When I saw this film, I was laughing harder than anybody in the entire theater. There were tears streaking down my face during some of the more outrageous gags, and even some of the not-so-funny stuff managed to elicit some strong chuckles. And at the end of the whole experience, right through the hilarious outtakes, none of it really made me feel bad for any of the bystanders involved (you'll get to see why during the credits), and I felt happy at the ultimate outcome for these two likable oafs of characters.

""Bad Grandpa"" is not going to win any awards, but it is going to make you bust a gut and care about the characters, which is more than I can say for most comedies these days.

This movie made me laugh to the point of tearing up. I hope they produce a sequel!",1383091200,10,246,4.25531914893617
6045286,1,B00G2PA0ES,"This movie wasn't edited well.

It did not have the good reactions & setup of the Borat movie.
It took wayyy too long to set up their pranks.
so most of the movie you will be waiting and waiting then the payoff isn't so good.
repeat x 50

I left unimpressed. bored.

only 2x I laughed a tiny bit. the whole theater never busted out in laughter in unison.
very quiet crowd for a comedy

the reactions of the people being pranked on were the best thing in the movie.
and there was too little of that.

6045287,5,B00G2PA0ES,"This movie was a lot funnier than I was expecting. Knoxville's Irving character is dirty, crude, and hilarously BAD! When his wife dies, Irving must take his grandson Billy on a road trip to get him to his whitetrash dad. Throughout the film, Irving and Billy prank people at strip clubs, convenient stores, restaurants, beauty pageants and much more. Jackson Nicoll who played Billy really has a lot of guts to dress up like a girl at a beauty pageant and do a pole-dance.

6045303,2,B00G2PA0ES,"Bad Grandpa is a vulgar version of candid camera. It is very funny at times, somewhat funny at other times, but mostly obscene and crude. It starts at a hospital where Grandpa learns that his wife has just died. He is overjoyed. He says he has been badgered for many years by his wife and is now free. He claims that he hadn't had sex with her since 1990; I guess this means some twenty years. He says he is now free; which seems to mean that he can now go out and have sex. No explanation is given why he could not have had extramarital sex during the past decades. His attempts to have sex is often ridiculous and, as I said, crude. His daughter is incarcerated and he needs to care for his grandson, which sometimes adds to the humor.
The best parts of the film are the reactions of people to how he acts. It seems that the people watching are bystanders, not paid actors, a couple of them have their faces covered over, as if they did not give the producers the right to use their image.
While many people liked the film, I feel it is not worth one's time to watch.",1505606400,,1069,4.169082125603865

It took a friend to email me the trailer for 'Bad Grandpa' who said she had seen it and found it so hilarious.  We laugh at the same kind of stuff more or less.  I cracked up at the trailer and immediately watched the movie.  You know Johnny K always pushes the envelope as far as possible, and if I wasn't so ill right now I certainly would have been doubled over laughing practically thru the whole thing.  Johnny disguises himself as an old man who is taking his grandson to live with his no-good father.  All the people in all the places they drive thru don't know he's in disguise, so he and his 'grandson' are doing and saying these ridiculous things and people think it's all real.  Their reactions are as good as Knoxville and the boy are.  I could sit here and say this humor is below me and I didn't enjoy it.  But everything is so over-the-edge, so unexpected, it's just all one big laugh with hardly a break in between.  One of the funniest movies ever.",1449360000,,1071,4.231527093596059

Would I buy it.. no..  Would I recommend it... Only to someone who likes Jacka$$ comedy.  Overall I am glad I watched it at least once but probably would not watch it again.",1448496000,,512,4.28125

6046065,5,B00G2PA0ES,"Crass comedy to some it impressed me as very impressive in that it integrated real people into the scenes and showed real Americans reacting to outrageous behavior of a crass obnoxious and pervy grandfather and his abandoned grandson (actors).  Everyone who was put on the spot, normal Americans working and living, passed the tolerance test with flying colors. There was most notably a scene at a beauty pageant for little girls in the south that was so wrong on so many levels and such an abomination on a spiritual level. These mothers showing their children off as if they were grown women with all the sexual innuendoes and the shock they had at seeing the little boy acting like a stripper was so strange.

I always thought it was one of the best parts of the Jackass series. And here we get an actually, somewhat, touching story played for laughs and heart with the old man as the centerpiece. No, it isn't going to win an Oscar for acting or directing, but in actuality Johnny does the film right and really does make this character his own. The kid is mostly fantastic, superb in the pageant scene, and the make-up artists were actually nominated for an Oscar. And they deserved it.

No other film is quite like this. Hidden cameras are used everywhere to provoke reactions, and the setups are all but maybe one or two thought out extremely well.

Plenty actually and for the strangest comment of the review, most of the laughs were at the funeral.  The rest was dotted with some fairly good laughs.  It's not something you'd ever want to pay for, but if it comes with your prime, why not.  Sensitive viewers will be offended probably.  The one thing you'll be talking about after you watch it is how could people not know it's a prank?

I thought it was funny, not funny throughout, but funny.  Watch it if you're okay with toilet humor that day and you're not taking life so seriously.

To be fair, the only thing i find funny about Jackass (the shows and movies), is re-telling the scenes.  I don't think I have ever laughed while watching the scenes...and so Grandpa is no different to me.  I respect the creative attempt, and the writing of the pranks (they are funny on paper), but watching real people react to stupidity just doesnt make me laugh.

It's one of those things that's difficult to watch because it's awkward, embarrassing, and just plain WRONG on so many levels, but at the same time, so freakin' funny you can't stop, even though it may make you squirm a little. Some of the funniest scenes (the strip club and the diner especially) actually made me glad that I was watching alone. Pretty much the whole movie was one laugh after another, and the thing he had going throughout most of the first half with his dead wife was an absolute RIOT!

I am not much of a Jackass fan only because I don't like seeing them injure themselves, and some of their stunts look painful. That said, in this movie Johnny Knoxville is fantastic (as was his makeup), and a true genius. I had to keep reminding myself each time I began to marvel about how well he could run, dance, and jump around that he isn't actually an old man--LOL! He's really THAT convincing. The kid was great too. Normally I find mouthy kids to be obnoxious and avoid films that feature them, but this boy was SOOOO funny!

Definitely see it if you have a good sense of humor, are open minded, and don't buy into the idiocy that is ""political correctness"". If you're a fan of twisted, black comedy, this movie will not disappoint. If you're prudish, or can't comprehend why over-the-top, in-your-face, blatant, offensiveness IS funny, then this movie isn't for you.

6047709,5,B00G2PA0ES,"So i kind of lost my taste for movies like this after bruno.

However, this movie was entertaining the whole way through. I was looking at some other reviews and people comment negatively on the ""crassness"" of this movie and how immature it is... um... yeah? It's the guys from Jackass, what else would it be? You wouldn't go to a transformers expecting requiem for a dream, why would you expect anything other than juvenile hilarity from the guys from jackass?

In short: the movie follows Knoxville (the grandpa) on a quest to return his grand son to his father after the child's mother (the grandpa's daughter) is sent to jail. The grandpa, recently free from the shackles of matrimony and wants to be rid of the kid as fast as possible so he can ""chase some tail"". But, along the way the two come to care for each other.

Extremely simple and cliche set up. Still, the simplicity works, instead of trying to be anything remarkable, it frames a series of absolutely ridiculous and largely disjointed events inside of this simple frame. Now for your cinema snobs out there that like to ""tut tut"" at linear movies while swirling your crystal glass filled with your own farts, there are actually two levels to this ""ordinary vs insane"" set up. The comedy of the movie barrows from the jackass franchise of crazy crap happening during every day situations. So really the ""ordinary vs insane"" motif works on two levels (oh snap!)

Anyway, the long and short of it is that the movie is funny the way watching a drunk baby is funny. Sure, it's wrong, silly, and disgusting but that's the point.

Also, the pageant at the end is FANTASTIC! It's funny to watch the faces of women be horrified with the overly adult and sexualized way the boy dances while covering the blue eye shadow painted eyes of their daughters wearing evening gowns.",1417910400,,1832,4.6419753086419755

I really don't know how they do these stunts without really hurting someone.  Being launched through a window from a kiddie ride was brilliant!  I assume Johnny Knoxville did his own stunts, and we really enjoyed them.  Watching the reaction of the bystanders was really the best part.

If we had paid to see this movie in the theaters I would've probably considered requesting a refund. This movie is basically a toned down version of Jackass edited to have a plot.

Financially speaking this movie was a huge success earning more than 6 times what it cost to make, but from a movie go'ers perspective I will never get the two hours we wasted on the movie back and we're probably a little stupider for watching it.

Bottom line, you'll get a few laughs out of this movie as well as some shock and awe, but I don't think it's worth the pain of sitting through the whole flick. In my opinion you'll get more pleasure watching the first and last scenes of the movie than you will sitting through the whole thing.",1415059200,,886,4.331325301204819

I have to ask, how did the director and writers find the humour for this movie? My only guess is that they pulled together a room of boys between the ages of eight and ten and watched their reactions to the juvenile ""potty"" gags. If ten percent of that audience laughed, then the joke got included.

My 19 years old granddaughter watched the movie in the theatre when it was first released, I asked her opinion, she used words like juvenile, pathetic, crude and gross.

6048442,3,B00G2PA0ES,"As much as wed all love the Jackass movies to continue, the guys are getting older, and if you saw the last movie, its clear that a couple of them aren't exactly eager when it comes to dangerous stunts any more. Johnny Knoxville keeps the brands humor alive by playing an old man, something done in the show with great results, for a whole movie. When I first saw trailers for Bad Grandpa, I was worried that it might only be funny for a few minutes, then fizzle out. Instead, Bad Grandpa had me laughing out loud a couple of times, and it manages to deliver the same kind of humor and style that made Borat so great. I say that, but then you look at my 3 star rating. Why? Unfortunately, Bad Grandpa, while it has some genuinely funny segments (literally and figuratively), also falls flat a couple of times, enough to the point where I was itching to fast forward through the scene and move on to the next. Its still very much worth your time if you're a fan of Knoxville and his friends antics.

Irving Zisman is an old man who isn't exactly a model citizen. Hes rude, constantly complains about his wife, and his old age gets in the way of everyday activities. He also has a lot of pent up energy, as shown early on when he gets his genitals stuck in a vending machine outside of a convenience store. Irving ends up taking care of his grandson, Billy, after the boys mom gets in some legal trouble. The old man isn't happy about this one bit, and immediately sets out to get Billy together with his dad, who isn't any better than Irving or Billys mom. The two go on a long road trip to take care of everything, and in the process, the trip also has them finding a spot to bury grandma after she passes away. There are a lot of stops on the way, with Irving using the young kid to help him attempt to get women, shoplift and much more.

If you ever saw the Jackass skits with the old people, thats exactly what the majority of this movie is. Its shot in a documentary style similar to Borat, with all kinds of camera angles to pick up the best of every scene. The duo go to a good variety of places to get reactions from people, from adult shops to a diner parking lot to a male strip club. Knoxville does a great job with the character of Irving, going all out and doing whatever it takes to get the most laughs out of whatever hes doing. The boy who plays Billy is great too, and reminds me a lot of The Kid from Bad Santa in that he plays the part pretty straight and never freaks out about what his grandpa is doing. There are even some kind of touching scenes where he talks to complete strangers about his parents, asking some guys if theyll be his new dad because he doesnt really have one. Youd think that something like this might break the film up and have the laughs come to a screeching halt, but they dont. Things tend to pick up with the laughs very quickly here. Some of my favorite gags included Irving dealing with a tough guy after breaking a restaurants mascot statue and the films climax involving a certain kind of beauty/talent contest.

I watched the unrated version, which was a little longer than the original cut, so maybe they just cut too much back into the movie, but some scenes went on for too long. Usually, they were the ones that didn't get any laughs out of me or I felt could have been better. The beginning and end of Bad Grandpa are hilarious, while the middle had me wondering when something good was going to happen. What may turn a lot of people off though, is how disgusting some of the humor is. I hate to bring it up again, but if something like Borat offends you, you should stay away from Bad Grandpa. Its not as bad but it is very similar. This is the old people skits from Jackass turned up a few notches.

Bad Grandpa is sure to make a lot of people laugh, provided they're used to the likes of Johnny Knoxville and pals. Casual viewers may abandon ship within the first 20 minutes. Even then, you should try to stick through the whole thing because the payoff near the end is absolutely worth it. When you're making real people on camera cry because of what you did, you've struck gold.",1414368000,,4139,4.268789808917197

Of course, that was when I was in my late college years when Knoxville first showed up on MTV. This was more of a move-like adaptation of the old nastiness tied up in a story of a single mother who tries to pawn her son off to 'bad grandpa' (Knoxville). Of course, she does this aggressively during the funeral of Knoxville's wife, so you can imagine that her carcass will hit the floor sooner or later. The son's father is only interested in the boy when he finds out he can receive a $600 stipend.

Of course, he uses shots of homeless and lingerers to compliment the setup, using a lower middle class neighborhood. Why didn't he try that in an elite area, like Beverly Hills so that we can get the reaction of them, instead of the mockery he was looking for?

Second, accept the fact there will be isolated crude (corpse, testicles, feces) humor, not overdone (in my opinion), but enough to evoke a reaction from the unwitting victims/targets.

It's not just johnny knoxville and some kid messing with people(even though it actually is but at the same time it isn't) it's an old man and his grandson and a couple others who are ""characters in a movie"" whilst the rest are just regular people who have no idea a movie is being made.

6049164,3,B00G2PA0ES,"Moving in another direction for their fourth film, the producers of Jackass decided to focus on a single character from the franchise, Johnny Knoxville's Irving Zisman. The film has everything you've come to expect from the series, as Knoxville plays a Grandfather, on vacation with his Grandson. Knoxville does his usual schtick, crashing into to things, saying outrageous things to strangers, and of course showing off his giant rubber testicles. As with most of the Jackass stuff, it's outrageous and hilarious for the first half hour, but quickly gets old. Maybe I'm just too old to appreciate Jackass anymore, but when I start out watching one of their films, I love it, and by the end, I'm just waiting for it to be over with. Knoxville is impressive, and while he's done films on his own, I think he was giving a message to the rest of the group in this film. The message being, if you guys don't want to do this anymore, I can make it work with anyone, even a 10 year old kid. Hopefully the message gets through and we'll get some more Jackass films. I really do love the simplistic comedic genius of the films, but it's repetitive nature makes anything more than an episode of the show wear on me. Maybe it's just not made for someone in my age group anymore, but regardless of age, Jackass has always been good for a few laughs and Bad Grandpa is no exception.",1406419200,5,1370,4.550607287449393

The Bad Grandpa skit was always hilarious on the show, but they tried to put a story line to the movie instead of just creating a montage of silly skits. I also didn't appreciate all the antics they had the young boy do. They exposed him to some adult behaviors that I thought was inappropriate.

I knew that the movie was filmed a la Candid Camera and he was pulling these stunts on unsuspecting people! I don't know how he got away with it. But after the shock was gone, I kept thinking of it and kept laughing. Everything he does is funny but the nightclub scene where the men strip for the ladies...again, I was in shock the first time but have been laughing out loud every time I think of it since then. This is why I bought this movie. The young boy is incredible. To know that he's pulling off this fake stuff with a straight face...I'm sure we'll be seeing more of him! The only thing I would suggest is do not treat it as family night. Watch the movie before you let your children see it. There may be some scenes you don't want them to see...like the nightclub!

6049251,3,B00G2PA0ES,"There's no denying Johnny Knoxville's  Irving Zisman  was the highlight of ""Jackass 2"".  He was funny, ribald, and fresh.  That said giving the old geezer his own vehicle stretches the limits of the character.  There's just not enough material to sustain feature length.  There is no arguing that the film has its moments.  Best bits include Irving making he and his grandson a sandwich at the supermarket and Old Irv dropping into ladies night at an African-American burlesque club.  Probably would have worked better as a one-off special on MTV.  If anything the film does answer the question as to whether fish have genitalia.",1403395200,,629,4.971153846153846

6049257,4,B00G2PA0ES,"And now for something completely different.  If you think, like most,  this is simply an overused clich, especially within comedies, then stop here.  This isn't something you're open to.  If, on the other hand, you are open-minded and seek a different flavor of comedy then you're in luck.

As many know, the MTV show Jackass celebrated outrageously bad behavior wrapped in the guise of mind-numbing stupid, and many times dangerous, stunts.  The bent mind behind that, of course, was one Johnny Knoxville.  That show was best consumed in small servings as it tested the bounds of taste.  The show ran its course, but Knoxville didn't fade into the night.  Its been a while since the show and the cash-in movie.  So, the time could be right for a revival of sorts.

While jumping off of Jackass, Bad Grandpa is a very different animal.  Its a fictitious story even as it intersperses some almost stunt-like vignettes as the story unfolds.  The bad taste is wholly intact.  The question of just how much the, supposedly uninformed, normal people appearing really know looms large.  It really doesnt matter if they're wholly in or not because they seem clueless for the most part and act accordingly.  Its funny and works.",1403049600,,1220,4.849514563106796

6049273,3,B00G2PA0ES,"As with all the Jackass style movies, there is some real funny stuff in here.  It's a bit of a change because this one actually had a story.  Unfortunately, this is one of those movies where the ""previews"" really had all the funny moments in them, and there really weren't too many surprises.

I wish they showed a bit more of the reactions of the people when they revealed that they were filming a movie and it was all a prank.  Perhaps ""Bad Grandpa .5 has a bit more of this, I don't know.  I didn't think this one warrants the price of another rental.  Perhaps if .5 comes out on HBO or Showtime in the future, I'll watch it then.

I must add one more thing.  The real star of the show was the little boy.  Some of the comments and questions that came out of his mouth were priceless.  I don't know how much of it was scripted (I'm sure much of it was), but it couldn't have all been scripted because he had to react to other people's reactions on the fly.

Knoxville plays the part to perfection, and his deadpan character is amazing.  Furthermore, the kid who plays his grandson (with the help of a cleverly placed earpiece I'm sure) is dynamite.

I do have to say that if you are offended by 5th grade boy humor or you don't find farts and balls funny, you probably won't care for this movie. Then again, if you don't find farts or balls funny, you're probably a stick in the mud anyway. I rarely ever buy DVDs. Ever.

6049328,4,B00G2PA0ES,"There may be spoilers.

Writer, star and original jackass Johnny Knoxville eschews his normal companions and their plot-less hijinks for a boy and a journey.  The story is simple.  Irving Zisman (Knoxville), an 86 year old recently widowed (co-writer Spike Jonze) grandfather.  At the funeral, Irving's daughter (Georgina Cates) drops off her 8 year old son, Billy (a game Jackson Nicoll) on her way to prison where she'll spend the next 6 months.  Irving is going to deliver Billy to the boy's bumpkin dad (Greg Harris) several hundred miles away in South Carolina.  The trip is a hoot.

Along the way Irving and Billy engage a bar filled with black male strippers, a couple of FedEx/UPS type clerks unwilling to ship Billy in a carton, funeral home mourners and sympathetic bikers in a bar.  All this while transporting his wife's body (Jonze) in the trunk of a Lincoln coupe.  It's a Lincoln even if the steering wheel said Ford.  Perhaps the funniest, if unoriginal, scene comes when Irving enters Billy in one of those repulsive beauty pageants designed for young girls.

It would appear that throughout the movie, only a few actors were in on the shenanigans and the real fun comes as the bystanders react.  It's priceless.  This couldn't have been pulled off without the Oscar nominated (not kidding) make up work of Stephen Prouty and some great comedic performances by Knoxville and young Nicoll.  The Jeff Tremaine directed movie isn't for everyone as there are plenty of jokes involving bodily functions and the nether regions but I was laughing throughout the picture.

The Blu ray disc comes in 1080P with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  Don't expect eye popping HD here as many of the scenes are shot with well hidden small cameras.  Still it's all watchable and as good as to be expected.  Much like the video, the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is about as good as it can be.  Hidden mics, some distant, occasionally have a difficult time picking up nuances.  I have no complaints.  Subtitles are available in English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.  Extras include several behind-the-scene shorts, alternative takes, deleted scenes, a DVD and a digital copy.  Several outtakes and the reaction of the unknowing participants, after being told what was going on, run during the closing credits.",1399939200,,2305,4.92987012987013

The entire affair becomes a little more intelligent from the sociological experiment of guessing and seeing how different people react to these offenses. While the story is somewhat negligible to the main attraction of the gags, the filmmakers and cast still do a decent job of injecting some heart into the proceedings. Similar more to the prank comedy on unsuspecting marks like ""Borat"" more than the physical punishment of ""Jackass,"" there are numerous points that will leave the viewer crying with laughter.",1399420800,,677,4.947368421052632

6049409,1,B00G2PA0ES,Saw the trailer but did not realize this movie was so much worse/trashier than the trailer.  I would not recommend this to anyone.,1397433600,,130,4.6521739130434785
6049410,3,B00G2PA0ES,I'm not into this kind of comedy but there were funny parts. There were also some disturbing parts as well but that's to be expected:),1397433600,,134,4.4

6049416,5,B00G2PA0ES,I laughed from beginning til the end. I watched it 3 times back 2 back. I really enjoyed this movie!!,1397347200,,101,4.1
6049417,2,B00G2PA0ES,This movie is very raunchy in terms of sexual jokes. It's funny if you have followed all of the other section of bad grandpa from jackass.,1397260800,,138,4.346153846153846
6049418,4,B00G2PA0ES,"Okay, this movie is NOT for the easily offended... but hubby and I haven't laughed this hard at a movie in a long time.  It's definitely silly, but the expressions on the people who are ""punk'd"" in this movie are priceless.  The child pageant scene was definitely our favorite.",1397260800,,277,4.63265306122449

6049422,4,B00G2PA0ES,"There were 3 scenes that brought me to tears that we're so funny. One of those scenes I seriously lost my breathe.  Movie doesn't really have much of a plot, but is really just a set up to punk a bunch of people.  I found the movie entertaining and didn't start to multitask while watching.  Whereas with Jack Ass there were times you just kind of got numb, bored or just scratched your head by wondering what's funny about some of the things they did.  Haven't laughed or have been this entertained by a movie in a long time - maybe the first Hangover movie.",1397174400,2,559,4.295238095238095

6049424,1,B00G2PA0ES,One of the worst movies I have ever watched. It is at best a one star movie perhaps for the middle school prank level,1397174400,,117,3.9166666666666665

6049427,3,B00G2PA0ES,This movie is okay.  It wasn't as funny as I expected to be. Some parts were really funny and some of them weren't. I wouldn't watch it again.,1397174400,,142,4.071428571428571

6049431,3,B00G2PA0ES,Great sales transaction. But the movie it's self was not what we expected. It was very funny but we where expecting it to be more of a movie like the ringer not ongoing pranks like jackass. I would not recommend children watch this movie,1397088000,,237,4.409090909090909

6049439,5,B00G2PA0ES,This is definitely not a movie for everyone. Anyone even slightly easily offended - will be offended. Memaw and Pepaw will enjoy it I think. I've warned them it's a little raunchy at times but I think they'll be okay.,1396915200,,217,4.45

6049480,3,B00G2PA0ES,Very much NOT for anyone under 13 years old.  About five serious laughter moments in the whole movie and not really worth four bucks.  Shoulda been a Prime so I could have watched the ending in a month or so...,1396051200,,210,4.225
6049481,4,B00G2PA0ES,"Jackass presents Bad Grandpa made me and my brother laugh so hard we cry in mutiple scenes.  He bought it for my birthday and I watch it and again laugh very hard in the same scenes from the movie theathre.  If your a fan of Jackass stunts and humor then you will very much enjoy what this movie has to offer their fans.  But as fair warning to their fans their is many touching scenes between the grandson and the the Grandpa,  I will give you the example that made me actual cry was near the end of the movie with the bikers gang that take care of kids from bad parents and the one biker guy told Grandpa ""no matter what that boy will be taken care of.""  I might be in my 30's but still a touching scene hit home in my heart.  But as for myself the scene that made me laugh the strongest was (spoiler) the talent show to find a girl to be a new princess and grandson posing as a girl to win the contest.  Still overall a great movie for laughs, touching moments between family memebers, and proves Johnny Knoxville can hit homerun with the laughs and at times be a serious actor in some of the scenes.",1396051200,,1103,4.102325581395349

6049484,2,B00G2PA0ES,I think if you were in the next room while I watched this movie you would have heard me laugh extremely loud 3 times... other than those 3 times it was pretty much boring.,1395964800,,171,4.0588235294117645
6049485,3,B00G2PA0ES,Very funny. Reminds me of the old bloopers on TV. Must see john Knoxville at his best and the young boy as well he did an awesome job,1395878400,,133,3.7857142857142856
6049486,5,B00G2PA0ES,Hilarious and inappropriate but thats why I liked it. If you are easily offended this is not the movie for you.,1395878400,,111,4.333333333333333
6049487,2,B00G2PA0ES,I thought this might be pretty funny but there was just so much missing from the writing and direction of the movie I was really bored watching it.,1395878400,,147,4.285714285714286
6049488,4,B00G2PA0ES,"This movie was really funny. Knoxville killed it yet again! It is an interesting look at society and how people act in crazy situations. I found it rude, crude, socially unacceptable, and down right gross....all three times I watched it. Very funny",1395878400,,248,4.928571428571429
6049489,5,B00G2PA0ES,this movie had me laughing so hard i lost my breath.....make sure you don't let the kids watch it...funny!!!..especially the strip club scenes....lol,1395878400,,149,5.521739130434782
6049490,5,B00G2PA0ES,Loved this movie..So funny...Haven't seen a movie that made me laugh this hard in a really long time. Enjoyed it....,1395878400,,116,4.85
6049491,1,B00G2PA0ES,Really did not like bad grandpa.  Looked like they sat down and decided all the awful things that they could throw in one movie about the relationship of a kid and his grandpa.  Really thought it was in bad taste.,1395792000,,213,4.3
6049492,3,B00G2PA0ES,"The premise is really very clever ... there's an actual story and the filmmakers used actual people in crazy situations.  The looks on their faces are so classic and so funny ... but the language, teaching the kid to drink beer, ""Sharting"" up a wall in a restaurant ... yuck.  Can't say I recommend those parts of the movie.  Of course, what else would you expect from the ""Jackass"" people.  It's 12 year old boy toilet humor elevated to grownup art.  Even though parts of it are revolting, overall, it's absolutely hilarious.  When Grandpa mows down the Penguin in front of a diner/convenience store and the owner comes out to fight with him, I was crying I was laughing so hard.  Who hasn't had a Grandpa who could get into a pickle like that?  The Bingo hall part was also off the charts funny.

6049505,3,B00G2PA0ES,"I don't know anyone who would honestly say that any film in the Jackass franchise is ""the best film"".  At least while sober and lucid.

That having been said, this film is fun with some great scenes that you will find yourself laughing in spite of your higher sensibilities.  Being from NC, I like the numerous scenes of my hometown and home state.  I can actually see the reactions of the supporting characters really happening.  In fact, the biker group who stepped up to defend the boy is a real group in the town where the scene was filmed.  That's what makes the Jackass franchise good - it is reality film on ludicrous steroids!

Watch it if you've had a crummy day or week.  With a drink.  Or ten.  Then report to the Politically Correct re-education camp the next day!  :)",1395705600,,780,4.460992907801418

This movie I find totally sick, disgusting, above all else inappropriate for children. No wonder it was rated R in the theaters. The sexual enuendo, the inappropriate adult dialogue spoken in some scenes by the little boy and so much more. I always thought John Hughes was the king of having young children use adult dialogue in films. These people beat his act in a second, I think. Thanks to this movie, I refuse to ever go see another comedy film again no matter how much it's being talked about. Steven Spielberg's directed comedy before; or at least produced. Why couldn't he have done this? It would of been at least a million times better than these stupid so-called filmmakers. BAD GRANDPA is a disgrace!",1395619200,,865,4.587096774193548

If you don't watch any of the rest of the movie, see that one scene - just laugh out loud funny!) I'm a huge Jackass fan and they really did a great one this time - knocked it out of the park on the hilarity scale. The kid in this movie should win an Oscar.",1395446400,,429,3.831460674157303

It's incredible how little effort was put into something that we're expected to pay for like it is a real movie. Johnny Knoxville is totally unbelievable as an 87 year old grandfather of an around 8 year old (wait, didn't we skip a generation?)

The production values are so shoddy that in many scenes they have subtitles because the sound is unintelligible. I kid you not.",1395360000,,535,4.572916666666667

Bad Grandpa changes it up and tries to add a story in with the madness. Its a nice touch, and works well however could have been improved upon like anything else in the movie industry. The real attraction is the pranks, and I don't want to ruin it, but every scene will give you a good chuckle.",1395273600,,532,4.383838383838384

The premise is pretty clever. Sort of a cross between Jackass, Borat, Punked and ABC's What Would You Do? I have to admit, I was crying laughing at times. Had to pause several times just to recover and make sure I didn't miss anything. Some bits are relentlessly funny.

Definitely worth a watch.",1395187200,,539,4.604166666666667

6049545,2,B00G2PA0ES,"I thought this movie was going to be in the tradition of the other Jack-ass movies. Sadly disappointed. I only chuckled twice during this film. One was the preview scene of grandpa being shot through the window in the coin operated ride. The other was when he and the grandson were in a restaurant and had a f--t contest. I may have snickered at a couple of other scenes, but very few. Lot of cussing, but no nudity, unless you would consider those fake mountain oysters seen in other Jack-ass films nudity. Basically the movie is about grandpa getting rid of his dear wifes body after she died. Packs the body in the back of his car and drives it across the country to take his grandson back to his father on the east coast, who's a loser with a bikers gang. After dropping off the grandson with his dad, he goes back and gets him and have more zany experiences together including a beauty contest the grandson enters as a girl. They eventually end up dumping grandmas body in a river,( her last wish). Some people may really enjoy this film, but not me. I should have saved the money.

6049580,5,B00G2PA0ES,"The concept of taking the besst elements of Jackass and combining them with an actual story (as light as that story may be) was pretty brilliant. Getting those visceral reactions from people who had no idea they were being filmed was pretty awesome...and of course hilarious. I laughed pretty much all the way through the movie,and just when you think it couldn't get any more over the top, they prove you wrong, lol. Knoxville was in top form for this and the kid was actually pretty amazing. He pulled off some stuff straight faced that most adults would never be able to do. I highly recommend this. Maybe don't let your kids watch it though. ;)",1394841600,,648,4.594827586206897

6049585,5,B00G2PA0ES,"If you don't like the Jackass movies, you won't like this. But after watching the amount of behind the scenes work they go through is amazing. The extras on the disc are worth it alone. The reveal to the marks are worth their weight in gold!

I saw this in the theater when it came out. The entire audience was on the floor laughing throughout the entire movie.

If you take your comedy seriously, you won't like this. If you want to be entertained for 90 minutes (Plus a lot of deleted scenes and behind the scenes  extras) then you need to buy this!",1394668800,,551,4.278846153846154

6049588,3,B00G2PA0ES,"Not for teens or parents who do not approve of swearing, crudeness or lack of civility.

6049589,1,B00G2PA0ES,"Hands down the worst movie I've seen, possibly ever.  I shut it off 40 minutes into it and went to bed.  Bad acting, pretty lame jokes.  The movie trailer will give you all the 1/2 decent scenes, don't get suckered into it.",1394668800,,223,4.261904761904762

6049592,4,B00G2PA0ES,Funny and entertaining. It's a great movie to watch with friends. It might be too graphic for kids. Johny Knoxville's makeup looked amazing.,1394668800,,140,5.130434782608695
6049593,1,B00G2PA0ES,i can tell you  there were some funny parts. but most of the time i felt really uncomfortable. child neglect and abuse i do not find funny. i do say watch it once if you really want to. but once i guarantee is all you will need. trust me.,1394668800,,238,3.857142857142857

6049597,2,B00G2PA0ES,"I won't go into a long review, because I'm sure there are plenty of those. For Jackass fans; prepare for a movie that is slow, toned down, and in which you don't get the see the reaction of people realizing this is a prank until the end. The format is that of an actual movie, not a series of pranks. What made this movie unappealing to me was the music. It was really dreary. Had they chosen different music, the pranks would have seemed funnier. But having really sad music over the scenes, made them seems like scenes from a crappy tragedy instead of a comedy. I did laugh a handful of times, but I think at that point I was desperately trying to enjoy myself. It's good acting, but just an odd combination of Jackass humor mixed with a somber plot. Wouldn't buy. Rent if you're bored and okay with staying bored.",1394582400,,816,4.339869281045751
6049598,1,B00G2PA0ES,This is supposed to be a movie.  It tells a story however there is no plot and not very funny.  Got through twenty minutes and had to turn it off cause it was so boring.,1394582400,,169,3.8
6049599,1,B00G2PA0ES,I am a liberal in many ways but if I had to not stand for something wrong it would be this movie.,1394582400,,97,3.4545454545454546

6049602,5,B00G2PA0ES,"Yes,Knoxville bulled out another out the rear performance. My thirteen year loved it. It may be a little strong for some people's taste, so take caution if you kids are going to watch it. It not called jackass for nothing. Lol",1394582400,,226,4.536585365853658

6049604,5,B00G2PA0ES,"Intricate movie. Filmed with a story but all the scenes have random people in them that don't know they are in a movie. Very funny, but really inappropriate. I give it 5 stars cause it's unique the way they filmed it. It's a work of art.",1394496000,,237,4.173913043478261

6049606,4,B00G2PA0ES,still has the tasteless humor that the Jackass crew enjoying displaying but definitely has its moments. it is worth multiple viewing.,1394496000,,133,5.380952380952381
6049607,1,B00G2PA0ES,this whole thing looked set up. all the best parts were in the commercial. i love the idea but it wasn't executed properly,1394496000,,122,4.3478260869565215

6049609,4,B00G2PA0ES,"I have two teenage boys, and we've watched every Jackass movie made. So, no stranger to this Knoxville character, I was still impressed with this movie, they took the character well beyond anything Jackass has ever done before. The movie really had it all. The kid was so cute, and played his part extremely well. There was comedy and touching moments. I liked the blend of movie parts, and all the parts that were skits played out in the real world. The end, where you get to see how the people reacted to finding out the characters were actors was just as funny. A genius idea that was well executed.",1394496000,,602,4.4818181818181815
6049610,1,B00G2PA0ES,"More than a handful of people told me this movie was hilarious.  It is not.  In fact, it's borderline terrible.  You're better off watching a handful of prank videos on you tube.  This movie has a great premise, but fails to deliver.",1394496000,,233,4.476190476190476

6049612,4,B00G2PA0ES,it was funny and didn't go to far like all the other movies did...their was a story line and a heart warming ending... best movie they made in a long time.,1394409600,,155,4.032258064516129
6049613,5,B00G2PA0ES,This was a very funny movie! Love Johnnie Knoxville he is funny and so was the little kid! So funny,1394409600,,99,4.0

6049617,4,B00G2PA0ES,"This is quite a funny film about a Grandpa who has to take his 8-year old grandson on a journey from Nebraska to North Carolina to return him to his father.  Like other Jackass movies, Grandpa (Knoxville) and the grandson set up elaborate pranks and jokes on the unsuspecting public.  Hilarious at times, the plot gives the movie a lot more cohesion than the Jackass films, and you end up rooting for the pair by the end.",1394409600,,421,4.454545454545454

6049619,2,B00G2PA0ES,"The movie is fine for few minutes initially then it becomes monotonous with concept of comedy being overturned. I have watched Hangover I, II and III. The second and third parts almost had similar concept to the first one but the flow of story was different in each one and the  humor was blended well in to the story. This one has failed to blend the humor in the story instead the tries to force humor which actually sounds cheap.",1394409600,,432,4.4
6049620,2,B00G2PA0ES,Since I had not seen other Jackass movie I wasn't prepared for the way this movie started out. Did they really need to show grandpa's penis? (or fake penis) It could have been a kind of cute movie without the gross parts. Of course we hope that any man that teaches his 8-yr old grandkid to hustle and do other nasty things like in this movie should be charged with child abuse but this is a movie not real life.  I would have loved to see it end that way!,1394409600,,456,4.066666666666666

I did not watch the movie more that ten minutes before I shut it off. Amazon, is it possible to get a credit for not watching this trash?  Very bad, an insult to comedy.",1394409600,,343,3.9

What was left was more uncomfortable than funny. I actually fell asleep about 2/3 through which is saying a lot because I almost never fall asleep during a movie.

6049629,5,B00G2PA0ES,"Ok, I'm not a jackass fan. Matter of fact, I think those movies are really dumb & can't imagine anyone paying to see them. However, when I saw a trailer for Bad Grandpa I thought I could possibly be converted - and I was.

Not only is the 'grandpa' character hilarious in this movie, but the kid....the kid is unbelievable & I don't think they would've had much of a movie without him. He keeps a straight face throughout the entire movie, even through his grandpas crazy stunts & insults. I don't know how he did it.

The funniest scene in this movie is **SPOILER ALERT** when the kid dresses up & enters in a children's pageant as a girl. He starts his dance routine all simple & cute a la 'good ship lollypop', then the song changes into 'Cherry Pie' and he rips off his dress, exposing his lingerie, and thrusting on the ground like a stripper. The looks on the pageant mom's faces in the audience is classic....apparently, it's ok to dress your child like a whore, but not ok if the child dances around on the stage like one. There are other funny scenes, but this one is so classic & funny that I actually went back & watched the scene again. Unreal. I bet the cameramen were having a field day shooting that scene!

The credits are also funny to watch, as they go through how they told people they were shooting a movie (after-the-fact, of course). Overall, I thought the movie was genius, even though I'm not a jackass fan. If you've got an hour-and-a-half to kill - rent it, it will make you laugh.",1394323200,,1507,4.375

It looked like this would be a masterpiece to share it's place along side other legends such as Animal House, for its comedic genius.  This movie did have some straight up turn your face red, pee your pants, gut busting laughs.  Unfortunately, they were too few and far in between.  This was really a boring movie that was difficult to watch from start to finish.  Maybe it would have been better to pop it in and skip from one gag to the next and cut out the filler.

6049655,4,B00G2PA0ES,"It is a funny movie and it hits its intended audience square in the nose.  The movie has quite a few raunchy parts.  Mostly involving Grandpa's anatomy.  My wife and I are on the conservative side of the sphere and a few parts made her put her hand over her mouth and look down :)  I just shook my head at times.  There is a lot of juvenile humor in the movie.

There were several spells during the movie that I did laugh out loud.  The reactions from real people are priceless.  I appreciated the outtakes at the end of the film which ""proved"" these were true reactions from real people.  My wife was skeptical about it at during the movie, as many people will be if they have not read up on it beforehand.

There are just a couple of parts during the movie that appeared like the real people were acting, but I think it just so happened that they were actually very colorful folks.  Only the directors know the true answer.  I want to watch this one again with my adult son.",1394150400,,976,4.216216216216216

The Bad Grandpa gag is a small part of the Jackass series and movies, I always found it funny, but it wasn't my favorite of their gags. And having a whole movie about it, I thought to myself I'd rather see Jackass 4 or something like that. But I loved this movie more than I thought.

What makes this movie is the little kid. He's great. Also having a story line helped keep it from getting stale with old man prank after another. Still hoping they make Jackass 4 but this was a great movie and I recommend it to anyone who likes this kind of humor.",1393977600,,632,4.223140495867769

There are still plenty of pranks, similar to those in Borat (intentionally putting unsuspecting people in to uncomfortable/strange situations). However, there is also a storyline in the background that is actually kind of sweet in between the crude moments.

I'd recommend watching it with friends, significant other, or while at home by yourself on a Tuesday night.

While it wasn't an amazing movie, it was very good and I'd give it 4.5/5 stars if possible. I decided to give the other half-star in memory of Ryan Dunn.",1393632000,,676,4.921052631578948
6049704,2,B00G2PA0ES,"when the grandpa character goes over the top, which he does frequently, the filmmakers should've shown more believable, and interactive, witness aka ordinary joe responses.  lots of times the witnesses were believable, merely staring at the politically incorrect grandpa and/or grandson, and whispering amongst themselves. it was also believable when the manager of the convenience store where grandpa was shoplifting got seriously on his case. and a couple of women ignored grandpa, which rang true. other times witnesses should've tried to get away from grandpa, instead of standing there staring. if the filmmakers filmed the scenes exactly how they went down, the team still needed to get something more from some of the witnesses. for instance, in one of the opening scenes when the dead woman fell out of her casket and people attending the funeral kept singing and left her on the floor, that may have been how it actually happened during filming, but to the audience the people attending the funeral were unbelievable in their response; who continues to sing leaving a corpse on the floor that's fallen out of a casket at a funeral they're attending. the witnesses clearly knew a body falling out of a casket was highly suspect, so their choice to do nothing reflected their knowledge that this was a staged event. the filmmakers needed to better assess what would play for a reasonable person in the movie audience. the actor playing grandpa didn't walk or talk like an elderly man. I laughed a few times mostly when grandpa tried to entice the ladies at a male stripper event; the ladies reaction was funny and believable, as well as one of the miffed exotic dancers who thought grandpa was cutting into his action. lots of penis humor and physical humor an 8 year old might like.",1393632000,,1790,4.927152317880795

One quickly realizes that 'Billy' is not exactly what Grandpa had planned on, hence the story of taking his grandson to his biological father!!!  What a tale to tell! The antics & problems these two manage to get in are nothing short of spectacular; problem with a soda machine, a 'broken' children's ride, the art of shopping and eating without paying...the list goes on and the funnier it gets!!!

In case you are unfamiliar with the what Bad Grandpa is about; Bad Grandpa is a 2013 hidden camera comedy film written by Jeff Tremaine, Spike Jonze and Johnny Knoxville and directed by Jeff Tremaine.  Bad Grandpa has a loose plot that connects the stunts and pranks together as opposed to the three original Jackass films which had no plot.  The story follows 86-year-old Irving Zisman (Knoxville) takes a trip from Nebraska to North Carolina to take his 8 year-old grandson, Billy, back to his real father.  I am glad I watched this movie and would definitely recommend it to others.

I have now watched it 4 times and it still has not gotten old.  I appreciate the crude humor and was amazed how well they disquised Johnny Knoxville as an old man.  I highly recommend if you need a good laugh!  If you get offended easily you may want to skip this movie.
Quality:  I was excited to purchase and watch immediately on Amazon before it was released to DVD.  I purchased the HD version for immediate streaming and was a little disappointed because it did not look like the HD i am use to viewing, it looked to be standard video quality eventhough I was playing it on a HD device.

6049785,5,B00G2PA0ES,"I didn't care much for the first ""Jackass"" film, though a few sequences were truly funny, so I avoided the sequels.  But some
acquaintances told me that ""Bad Grandpa"" was much better and very funny, so I rented it on Netflix.  I think I laughed as much
and hard through this movie as any I have ever seen, including ""Airplane"", ""Dumb and Dumber"", and ""Something About Mary"".
Rude and Crude, this is not for people who are easily offended, or find so-called ""dumb"" movies inherently unfunny.  But if you
are open to any comedy that might really make you laugh, and you used to like ""Candid Camera"", then you will probably like
this one.  Unlike the original Jackass films, this one has a story line going through it, and even approaches moments of slight
poignancy, despite its over the top gross-outs and hilarious sight gags.  The credits are a riot too, so don't turn it off too soon.
I've now seen it 5 times, with different people, and still laugh hard at some of the gags and situations.  The young boy in it
is excellent, and while it is a definite ""R"", much of it is okay for older children who have seen many PG-13 films.  This one has
no mayhem, violence,  gunplay, or explosions.  Just a lot of sexual innuendoes, and one scene in a black dance club that is
graphic.  But plenty of poor taste, so be advised.",1393027200,,1318,4.454166666666667

However, for those very conservative ppl I do warn that there is a bit v nudity and vulgar language. It's a stunner when u first see it but what makes it so funny is that there r some v us who have had bad grandpas and uncles and it reminds some v us v them. This is really a story about the relationship between a grandson and his grandpa showing love for each other by hanging out like pals. But to enjoy this film u really do have to turn off the moralistic judgmental radar in ur head and turn on the ""could there actually b a bad grandpa like this. Oh, yes I remember Roberts uncle or grand pa acted similar to this. Bless him even though he's in the nursing home now.""

6049818,4,B00G2PA0ES,"If you are like the Jackass movies then you will certainly love Bad Grandpa. On the other hand if you are like me and are not a big fan of the Jackass movies, give Bad Grandpa a chance. It is slightly different because there is a story line to the movie and the whole movie does not consist of ridiculous stunts where the guys in the movie put themselves in danger.
The movie ""Bad Grandpa"" is hysterical. It combines Knoxville's tendency for ridiculous stunts with a scripted story about a dirty old man and his clever grandson. Johnny Knoxville plays Irving Zisman, the 86-year old grandfather of Billy, who is played by Jackson Nicholl. Irving's wife of 46 years has died, and as ""Bad Grandpa"" opens, he reacts with a laugh and proclamation of freedom. He then has only one thing on his mind which was made clear when he tells one woman, ""I may be too old to stir the gravy, but I can still lick the spoon."" At the funeral of Mrs. Zisman, Billy's Mom pawns him off on his grandpa and asks him to take Billy to his dads. The movie then develops into a comical  story of Billy and his Grandpa on a road trip to Billys dads. I would recommend this movie for not only it's hilarious scenes but also because of the chemistry between Knoxville and Nicholl and the movies original comedy.
For the Jackass fans it might take a little while to get used to the scenes in between the pranks where Irving and Billy continue to act out the story line. At first it feels like they should drop the act when no-one else is around but Knoxville and Nicholl never break character. This is an aspect of the movie I really liked. Although the story line is hard to relate to due to the lack of emotion portrayed in the bond between Billy and his Grandpa, they do quickly prove to be an effective double act since Knoxville and Nicholl play off of each other quite well.
Even though the story is not as captivating as other comedies, Bad Grandpa is still an absolute must see original comedy. What made Bad Grandpa original is that other than a few characters such as Billy and Irving, everyone else in the movie were not actors they were real people reacting to what Billy and Irving were doing. Bad Grandpa was able to capture the true reactions of people because they had hidden cameras all over the areas they were shooting. The comedy in Bad Grandpa is not from Knoxville or Nicholl as much as it is from how the real people react to their characters. These are everyday people who react in much the same way that you or I would in the different situations. This aspect of the movie can have a negative impact on the movies story line. Since they're real people, the scenes trail off; either the people walk away, or the shot abruptly ends.
 Although the story line in Bad Grandpa is not award winning the scenes are kind of like a joy-buzzer handshake or a hidden whoopee cushion and sometimes that's all you really need for a good laugh or two. So unless you have a low tolerance for crud and sometimes rude humor Bad Grandpa is a must see comedy.

The kid that appears as the grandson is a revelation of sorts, he seems so composed in the role, and absolutely funny on his own.

There is a lot to be said for the music in this movie, very tasty and well chosen, almost want to buy the soundtrack, definitely a laugh out loud movie, where sometimes one forgets that most of the scenes are done in front of unsuspecting participants.

6049929,4,B00G2PA0ES,"Im a huge fan of Jackass and their ridiculous stunts. I can watch TruTVs World Dumbest series for an inhumanly long amount of time. As a connoisseur of stupidity gone public I had high expectations for Bad Grandpa. I wasn't disappointed.

A typical Jackass movie is just one stunt after another. I actually liked Bad Grandpa better because the film weaved the stunts in such a way that it told a story. The loose plot was this: a guys wife dies, so he needs to get his grandson away from the childs no-good mother (his daughter) and into the hands of his no-good father.

As you can see, theres plenty of room here for playing pranks on unsuspecting folks (the funeral for Bad Grandpas wife, the behavior of his daughter at the funeral, the video conference in a coffee shop with the son-in-law, and many more.)

Along the way, the usual happens, but its always unpredictable: Grandpa does and says outrageous things and innocent people who witness it are left shaking their heads or gasping in horror. Bad Grandpas grandson was hilarious, too. He even got in on the act with the stunt at the climax. Like the best pranks, there was also a bit of a statement, but Ill say no more so I don't spoil it.

I generally avoid comedies because they are too often some ex-SNL cast member performing excruciatingly long versions of their already done-to-death skits. The Jackass crew and Johnny Knoxville are not so tone-deaf, so I hope to see more like movies this.

A micro-mini spoiler follows: During the credits, you get to see the reactions of the people once they are told that they are part of a film. Those clips were almost as entertaining as the pranks themselves and I wish they had shown more of that.

There were only a few moments when I laughed, but my husband, the perpetual kid, was laughing the entire time. The only down side to this movie was that it took on an actual movie plot-line, instead of it just being stupid stunts that you'd have to be a real jackass to perform.

Slow parts for a higher rating",1391990400,,103,4.1
6049972,5,B00G2PA0ES,"Hilarious! Genius...well done, so funny I plan on watching all the Jack Ass movies!
I would recommend this movie to friends !",1391990400,,125,4.7272727272727275
6049973,4,B00G2PA0ES,Funny on so many levels. I enjoyed all the antics of Johnny Knoxville and Jackson Nicoll. Well timed stunts really made the movie.,1391990400,,130,4.695652173913044
6049974,1,B00G2PA0ES,"It is Just very poor.  I can't think of any other way to rate this "" movie""  if that's what you wanna call it.",1391990400,4,110,3.5416666666666665
6049975,3,B00G2PA0ES,"I expected a lot more from the Jackass crew on this one.  The movie wasn't bad at all, just not up to par.  Think the Hangover 2 and 3; the bar was set so high on the first that anything beyond that was going to be difficult to top.  Similarly, Jackass has been such a hit that you would have expected more from a movie like this.  Again, the movie was just that, ok.",1391990400,,367,3.918918918918919
6049976,4,B00G2PA0ES,"I love the Jackass movies and tv series and this was no let down. Several scenes had me rolling in laughter.
A must see if your a fan.",1391990400,,134,3.8214285714285716
6049977,5,B00G2PA0ES,This movie is brilliant. The formula is simple: series of staged gags with the one central character. This movie is definitely not for those that based their viewing what the New Yorker magazine suggests. It's poop-and-fart jokes all the way.,1391990400,,242,5.075
6049978,5,B00G2PA0ES,"Yes, it's still prank comedy, but it actually follows a plot and tells a story. I laughed like crazy for most of it, and I'm really not a fan of prank style comedy.",1391990400,,164,4.0
6049979,3,B00G2PA0ES,I watched the extended explicit version. It was ok. After seeing the previews like a lot of movies you have seen the best bits.,1391990400,,127,4.333333333333333
6049980,5,B00G2PA0ES,"Got all the normal Jackass dialog, and visual humor molded into an actual story line. Laughed my @#* off. Not for kids for sure, and not for those who don't get the Jackass (Johnny Knoxville ) humor.",1391990400,,199,4.405405405405405
6049981,5,B00G2PA0ES,This movie was hilarious! One of the best comedies I've seen in a long time. Hell yeah. The kid was funny.,1391990400,,106,4.095238095238095
6049982,1,B00G2PA0ES,"One of the worst movies I have every seen and I am over 60 years old.  Anyone who ordered this movie should get their money back and Amazon should take it off the website for viewing.  I was expecting a comedy and it definitely was not funny. There was no substance to movie and hopefully we don't have too many bad grandfathers as shown in the movie.

A ""GOOD"" Grandpa",1391990400,,369,4.242857142857143
6049983,5,B00G2PA0ES,Very funny  The movie was well done and kept us laughing from start to end  We could watch this movie over and over,1391990400,,115,3.9565217391304346
6049984,1,B00G2PA0ES,This is better suited to a 20 minute youtube special.  No volume necessary.  If I had 3 hands I'd give it 3 thumbs down.,1391990400,3,120,3.9583333333333335
6049985,4,B00G2PA0ES,"Movie is funny but don't be letting young ones around when you watch it.  Don't believe me, 5 mins into the movie will show you why.  Only bad with the movie is that you see most of the funny parts in the Theater Previews.",1391990400,,222,4.0227272727272725
6049986,4,B00G2PA0ES,"I didn't know what to expect going in to this show. I'd watched the Jackass movies, and was only mildly amused. Yes, they can be funny, but it gets a bit old to me after awhile. My husband, though, loved them, so we decided to watch Bad Grandpa as soon as it was available on Amazon. What a surprise! This show had me laughing the entire time! It was a great concept with a fun plot to follow - yes! There is a plot!! I definitely recommend it.",1391990400,,444,4.056818181818182
6049987,5,B00G2PA0ES,The movie was funny but was slow to get to the funny parts.  Once it got to the funny scenes it was hilarious.,1391990400,,110,3.782608695652174
6049988,5,B00G2PA0ES,"This is exactly what I thought it would be based on the previews. The execution and content were fantastic. I'm not a ""Jack Ass"" fan at all. This reminded me of the old ""Candid Camera"" tv show. This movie was a lot of fun.",1391990400,,222,4.068181818181818
6049989,2,B00G2PA0ES,"The plot was not very thought out. Although there were a few funny part, the movie would have been better as a half hour TV show.",1391990400,,129,4.0
6049990,5,B00G2PA0ES,I fell out of my chair twice.  Literally fell out of the chair. The best of the jackass movies by far.,1391990400,,102,3.857142857142857
6049991,2,B00G2PA0ES,"Although I only gave it two stars, I did enjoy the film.  The two stars was based solely on the fact that the movie was caught between being a typical Jackass prank movie and a road trip bonding film between a surly grandfather and his grandson.  I thought Knoxville and the kid playing his grandson both did a great job when they were playing the road trip roles and I hope their performances here will convince them to do other traditional films.

So, three stars for the road trip portion and one star for the Jackass portion averages out to a solid two.",1391990400,,557,4.388349514563107
6049992,5,B00G2PA0ES,The movie was funny. Non stop laughs. I would definately watch it again. I recommend anyone who likes funny movies to watch.,1391990400,,124,4.681818181818182

6049994,5,B00G2PA0ES,I normally do not like this type of movie. I decided to watch it with my husband and it made me laugh so much. I could have done without some of the scenes and the little boy using bad language was uncalled for. He was a cute and funny child without using bad words.,1391990400,,266,3.9444444444444446
6049995,5,B00G2PA0ES,We rented the movie and laughed from the begininning until the end.  This movie is hilarious I could watch it over and over again.  It's rare I would rent a movie and still want to buy it and that's exactly what I'm going to do.  I'm buying a copy today. Get it and get ready to laugh until it hurts.,1391904000,,300,3.966666666666667
6049996,1,B00G2PA0ES,"I rented this solely based on my experience with previous Jackass movies and the TV series. I always really liked the grandpa skits.

This movie was just awful. The skits were shallow and I didn't even laugh once. Any comedy movie that you rent I feel should guarantee at least one.

Sorry Johnny - something missed in the carry over between the tv series and this movie.",1391904000,,371,4.522388059701493
6049997,5,B00G2PA0ES,"HAHAHAHAHahahaha!

That's what you can expect to do if you watch this movie, which I recommend.

Bonus: This Jackass movie has a decent plot as well. The other ones weren't worth watching in my humble opinion, but this one is worth every penny!",1391904000,,244,4.651162790697675
6049998,5,B00G2PA0ES,It may be a little crude at times but it made us laugh till we cried.... Unbelievably.... It has a cute story behind it :),1391904000,,122,3.92
6049999,5,B00G2PA0ES,I could really appreciate the fact that the comedy was based in reality. I loved it :) Johnny Knoxville is genius.,1391904000,,114,4.476190476190476

6050004,4,B00G2PA0ES,Bad Grandpa is a comedy that is funnier than the smell of a Puerto Rican's poop. This movie also has balls (literally!).,1391904000,,120,4.5
6050005,1,B00G2PA0ES,"It was not funny, the plot dragged, took to long, stupid and perverted, the takes after the movie was better than the movie itself.",1391817600,2,131,4.5
6050006,5,B00G2PA0ES,I despise most of the jacka$$ movies (if not all) and so I was reluctant to see Bad Grandpa......but I LOVED it! This movie is hilarious with a surprisingly good story line. I am watching it for the second time and laughing just as hard as the first.,1391817600,,250,4.229166666666667
6050007,3,B00G2PA0ES,"Im in my 40's and even if the funny parts made me my face hurt from laughing, the movie was putting me to sleep inbetween laughs.

6050011,3,B00G2PA0ES,The movie had some funny moments.  Good movie to watch if you are in the mood for a movie that requires no concentration,1391817600,,120,4.217391304347826

6050014,5,B00G2PA0ES,"Honestly - I almost hurt myself I was laughing so hard.  Just watching these innocent bystanders' expressions was worth the rental price alone.  Johnny Knoxville and the kid are both brilliant and you never know what is coming up next - except that it will be something insane.  It should go without saying that you  don't bring your Grandma or kiddies to this (or any of the Jackass movies - duh!). But if you just wanna fall off your couch laughing for 90 mins or so, this will do that, for sure.",1391817600,,498,4.380434782608695

6050019,1,B00G2PA0ES,Tasteless and the funniest scenes you already watched when the previews were on tv. Don't waste your time with this movie.,1391817600,2,122,4.857142857142857
6050020,5,B00G2PA0ES,I have not laughed that hard in a long time! This movie was a surprise. We will watch it again.,1391817600,,95,3.8

6050022,3,B00G2PA0ES,It's fine... Lil light on the zingers ... Tryin a little too hard to pull the heart strings. It's sort of original in that everything is played straight within standard Jackass joke territory.....,1391817600,,196,4.96969696969697
6050023,1,B00G2PA0ES,Probably one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time! Don't waste your money! Should be in the B category!,1391817600,,113,3.9565217391304346
6050024,2,B00G2PA0ES,I was disappointed I thought it would be funnier and more Jackass but it was kind of lame to be honest.,1391817600,,103,3.9523809523809526
6050025,1,B00G2PA0ES,"I use to watch the Jackass crew when they were on TV and all and I use to enjoy the stuff that they did on the show however when they started making movies like this, the funny went out the door.  Now I half expected the movie to be good when I first rented it however after popping it in the player it after about 10 minutes or so I finally hit stop and put it back in its case.

If I am asked if I can place it with another movie, it would be Due Date as it starts out funny then it is nothing more than disgusting the rest of the movie.  The lude humor might be good for TV but you need to tone the thing down enough that I would ever recommend it to anyone else.

Save your money for a better movie, this isn't worth it",1391731200,,723,3.7682119205298013

6050027,1,B00G2PA0ES,could not watch more than a few minutes.  I thought it would be a funny movie.  I did not see anything funny about the first three minutes.  that will teach me to read the reviews before I order a movie.,1391731200,,203,4.025
6050028,5,B00G2PA0ES,"Watched it with the family and we've never laughed so hard in our lives.  I've never watched the Jackass movies before, but I knew I could expect a lot of physical comedy and bathroom humor.  This movie delivered and absolutely brought us to tears.  Worth the rental.",1391731200,,267,4.638297872340425
6050029,5,B00G2PA0ES,"I've never paid much attention to Knoxville, didn't watch the Jackass movies. But I read a compelling review of his performance as the Bad Grandpa and gave it a chance.

First off, no matter how you feel about pranks, ""candid camera"" setups, etc., this film is just plain hilarious. So funny that I couldn't catch my breath at points. The way people react to the insane scenarios Grandpa perpetrates is priceless. Chances are you'll at least chuckle, but if you're like me, you'll fall out of your chair laughing.

But more than that, Knoxville and crew have created a kind of fascinating and wide-ranging social commentary. It exposes a delightful empathy that most people have for the elderly, plays with sexual attitudes/norms, and in the final scene (no spoilers) hilariously lambasts the sexualization of girls.

Finally, despite the outlandish setups, Knoxville and his young co-star surprised me by creating characters I actually cared about.

This film was more than I bargained for, in a really good way, and I suspect it will be a subject of serious study in years to come.",1391731200,,1083,4.934065934065934

6050033,5,B00G2PA0ES,Hilarious!!! The kid steals the show. Great chemistry between he and Knoxville. Do not miss this movie. Not for young kids.,1391731200,,123,4.904761904761905
6050034,5,B00G2PA0ES,"My husband and I loved this movie!  If you are reading bad reviews, I think it's because some people don't realize that none of the other people in the movie are 'in' in the joke... it's all being filmed in front of real people, which makes it even funnier.  Johnny Knoxville does an amazing job, and the kid in the movie is such a great actor! We were laughing so hard at many of the scenes.  If you need a funny (albeit a bit raunchy, but hilarious) movie to watch, this is the one!",1391644800,,484,4.127659574468085

6050046,5,B00G2PA0ES,The movie was funnier than Borat and had a lot more heart. The Knoxville character is really believeable and the kid was excellent.,1391644800,,131,4.739130434782608
6050047,5,B00G2PA0ES,Funny funny funny movie. I laughed extremely hard throughout the whole thing. Knoxville puts himself through some amazing stuff for our enjoyment.,1391644800,,146,5.681818181818182

6050051,4,B00G2PA0ES,It's a funny movie. It's not like their other  movies. This actually follows a story line. Which in some parts is just really slow.,1391558400,,131,4.458333333333333
6050052,5,B00G2PA0ES,The story is actually good and a bit moving. The pranks are hillarious too. I'd rent it again for sure.,1391558400,,103,4.2

Not being familiar with Johnny Knoxville nor Jackass, I was not expecting the vulgarity in the first part of the movie.  Once I saw what direction the movie was taking, I turned it off.

6050058,5,B00G2PA0ES,I truly liked this movie. It was hilarious. I know it is not good for children to act as they had the child do in this show. BUT I found it very entertaining to see the reactions from these complete strangers. Especially when he acted like the stranger was his new daddy. LOL. This is waaaaaay better than the Jack Ass shows he has done.,1391558400,,337,4.2
6050059,3,B00G2PA0ES,"Ok, Ok, Jackass is Jackass. What do you expect? The 6th grade humor is dominant, yet gives us a chance to snap out of our shells for a moment, and explore the protective paradigms that we call social order- even when we cover our faces in embarrassment - as though we were afraid of blood ( Or other body fluids) while watching open heart surgery.
 The one episode that glows, is the pageant scene- where over-the-top-already socially perverted mothers are forced to watch a 10 year old do a pole dance! Where did they get that kid actor?? What a performance! I had to laugh ( or barf) at the program-- yet I could barley watch my wife as she laughed out loud at things that I did not! So, in that regard, it is a real lie-detector. So, I must go to our dinner now of butchered chicken, toasted in our auschwitz oven to a crippy aroma, and have a glass of papaya juice from the fruitful planes of Argentina. Face it. We live in a perverted world. This movie is just a reminder.",1391558400,,977,4.281081081081081

6050073,5,B00G2PA0ES,"It's rude crude and totally unacceptable, but I love it.
DEFINITELY not something for kids to watch but it's everything you expect from the jackaxx crew trying to get reactions out of people.
It's a bit strange in that it's like a reality t.v. hidden camera show, but it's also flowing a long as a directed movie.  So it's ""Different"" in it's approach.
Knoxville is great, the grandson sidekick is hilarious and really cracks you up with his believability.
And, finally, at the end they show the people they're on a hidden filming and their reactions, which is priceless.
Definitely recommend, but be prepared to shield some eyes if they're sensitive to outrageous behavior.",1391472000,13,674,4.912280701754386

6050081,5,B00G2PA0ES,"This is a laugh out loud, and well thought out film. In my opinion, this is the Johnny Knoxville take on 'Paper Moon', and the 'Jackass' team pulls it off amazingly well. Imagine an unwilling, amoral, old man, who has to transport a young child who he doesn't know across country. As I said before, this is a wonderful take on the classic movie 'Paper Moon', but with no holds barred! I strongly recommend this movie, especially for the disturbing scene regarding the children's 'Beauty Pageant'. That one scene puts the questionable practice of children's 'Beauty Pageants' on trial in a hilarious way. But besides that, it's a hysterical series of pranks on an unknowing public, glued together by a great story.",1391472000,,713,4.852459016393443

Although it was a novel idea to link these hidden camera segments with (poorly) scripted scenes it doesn't work AT ALL.  The segue portions are slow, not funny, poorly acted and completely unnecessary. All they do is break the momentum of the mildly amusing pranks, all of which you've seen in a more concise version in the trailer.  And seeing the pranks in a longer scene actually only makes them less amusing.  I guess what I'm trying to say is don't bother.

I paid $3.99 to rent it but  didn't care about letting it go to waste because it was worth more to me to pay to turn it off than to pay & watch it.

With the exception of a few skits that were absolutely hilarious it was basically ha-ha funny with a few chuckles and in spite of the absurdity of it all they still managed to pull off a genuinely emotional ending ! I believe many who left a bad rating had no idea what to expect, maybe they looked at the cover and thought, ""oh that looks like a nice movie about a Grandfather and his grandson, lets watch that"" ! Especially the ones who let their kids see it... My advice to the naysayers, do a little research before you watch next time. A relative of mine tried to watch this movie and hated it, cut it off, said it was stupid ! I said yeah, it is stupid, and funny as hell ! Some people just cant deal with FUN !

With so many staged youtube videos and fake reactions, it's refreshing to see genuine shock out of regular people on the street.  Johnny Knoxville does and amazing job of becoming an old man and his ""grandson"" is just the right mixture of innocent and irreverent.  It's too bad the game has been exposed now because I would have loved to see them hit a few more towns.  It obviously takes a lot of advance preparation to hide the cameras in just the right places at the right time.  Howlingly funny.",1391385600,3,565,4.554455445544554

So what we're seeing is sort of a midwestern/southern ""Borat"" or ""Candid Camera""--an ""on the road"" saga with a really cute kid estranged from his parents and a randy old codger on the make.

As the film progressed we realized we could not sit through it to the end and be any kind of example that our kids could look up to.
Grampa is a lusty geezer stuck with his grandson while on a roadtrip/quest to get laid and more.  The scrapes into which he gets himself are sophomoric at best (like getting his privates stuck in a soda machine--really???).

There is an actual plot to the movie, with a relationship being built between grandpa and grandson.  But the main reason to watch is for the few scenes that were so funny (strip club, bed, etc) that I had tears in my eyes!  I haven't laughed that hard in years!  All in all, it is worth watching.  Probably more so for guys; but I did talk my girlfriend into watching it--and she admitted it was better than she thought it would be.

If you enjoy the ambush style of humor employed by Sacha Baron Cohen in ""Borat"", where the humor lies mainly in the reactions of unsuspecting people who have no idea they're being filmed as part of a comedy, then you are going to love this movie!

Also, if you have the opportunity, you will want to watch the making of this film, too.  Some very funny moments in it; both in the form of outtakes and cut footage.

Caution, though: don't watch this movie if you take yourself too seriously or are easily offended.  But if you have a slight irreverent streak to your humor (like me), and think political correctness is for pansies, then you should enjoy this movie enough to at least give it four stars.

No you don't Johnny...you have an old idea, and you've redone it half as well, and much too late. While the kid is great, and there are a few funny scenes, this is an idea that is past it's prime. Maybe if we knew the storyline earlier on, it might have had a certain charm. But really, is the kid in on the joke? Are the people in on the joke? Are we in on the joke?

There were some funny parts in this but it came across more as a clip type movie rather then a real movie. I'm sure many people will like this (mainly a younger crowd) but to me I was disappointed.

Bad Grandpa (Johnny Knoxville) is left with his grandson after the kid's mother walks out. So it's Bad Grandpa's job to haul the 8 year old kid across country to his father. While the scripted story is humorous enough on its own, it's the unscripted reactions of the people that they encounter along the trip that are as unforgettable as they are hilarious....And not just the reactions to Bad Grandpa's antics; Director Jeff Tremiane gets the child actor to pull off some hysterical, awkward and comically inappropriate shenanigans of his own. I'm guessing that the kid had a hidden earpiece and was getting fed lines as each live, real-life encounter developed, but who knows...maybe the kid is just a natural.

This movie is one of the best comedies I have ever seen. It's raw; it's silly; it's real; and for a short 90 minutes it will crack you up.

The people bad-mouthing this movie are suspect, and they might just be on a fugitive list somewhere, or a congregation list. In any case, you will find much to laugh about. Some scenes are way funny, some...not so much.

I liked the fact that they show the outtakes at the end and make it clear that the cameras were set up as HIDDEN before the scene was shot. I say that because in some scenes I was not certain that the ""pranked"" parties were not in on the prank. There are some memorable bits in this movie and the pranks blend in well with the back story plot.

On the sad note, there really are some people who see kids as nothing but a meal ticket, a way to collect a government check each month. The movie father of the little boy is one such numb nert. I wish that that scene had been a little more violent, but then, the father was an actor and not a real dead bead scumbag. Protect the children!

There are so many laugh-out-loud moments in this movie, based on ludicrous and perverted scenarios, that it is a film worth re-watching when you need some laughs.

The interesting thing about this movie is that, like Borat, the film has a plot that incorporates all of its skits.  And it actually works.  The relationship between Irving and his grandson is a little bit touching.

For the record, I thought the actor who plays the boy's father might actually die in the biker bar.  You'll see.  That guy deserves a medal for bravery.

Does the story line work? Sure, I guess. But it is the least enjoyable part of the movie. Luckily the are short and should be considered as more of a setup for the next gag.

I have to admit, I did expect more big laughs. Having said that, I did bust a gut in a few scenes! I just had hoped for more.

If I had to compare this movie with the Sacha Baron Cohen movies (similar style of movie...Bad Grandpa just has stunts), I think Cohen does a better job. Especially with connecting each gag with a lose storyline.

6050279,2,B00G2PA0ES,"'Bad Grandpa' is certainly funny. Johnny Knoxville (actually, this is the first time I watched his movie) is very believable, entertaining and engaging as the 86 year old Irving.

Throughout the movie he pulls of many funny gags. I definitely did get quite a few laughs and would rate this 5 out of 10 and would give it the two and a half star option if Amazon made it available to me.

I can't imagine I could give it more because the whole movie smacks of amateurishness and some poor acting by supporting cast, particularly the 'penguin' incident. That guy threatens to bash him or whatever, but he's facing away from the camera, and it's clear why, because he can't keep a straight face.

Many of the gags are very telegraphed, and occasionally it feels like the people being pranked are onto it before the audience can get a truly hilarious reaction of 'outrage'.

Some of the pranks are poorly executed, particularly the post office episode, which takes some of the fun out.

That said, there are also times when people are fully serious and it will definitely make you laugh.

Bad Grandpa is okay as a modern gross-comedy. It's passable, along with the recent 'Grown Ups 2'. However, 'We're the Millers' was a stronger, more funnier movie released this year.",1385251200,3,1265,4.701357466063349
6050280,3,B00G2PA0ES,"This movie has some really funny moments.  However, This movie could have been a lot better.  It's basically just a prank movie with a stupid storyline. You could completely ignore the storyline. Most of the pranks have nothing to do with the actual story. If you love the Jackass movies then you'll like this movie. If you don't then you should definitely pass on this one. I thought the kid in the movie was really funny. However, most of the pranks are just TOO SHORT!  You know at some point the people were told that they were being pranked. It would have been nice to actually see there reactions. One lady calls the police on Bad Grandpa but we never get to see the police arrive. The girl nicknamed Cinnamon says that she's going to take the kid to his hotel. Then, she just stands there as he walks off. I guess she really didn't care about the kid. They might be saving a few these things for the DVD and Blu-ray.  If you're looking for a few laughs then this movie will not disappoint you. Don't expect a great story. Remember, It's still a Johnny Knoxville production.",1384905600,,1080,4.4393939393939394
6050281,5,B00G2PA0ES,"Funny all the way through. I really loved the penguin bit! A great, nasty, rauncy, silly, gross comedy that had a story line. If you wanna laugh, please, please get this movie!",1384560000,28,176,4.53125
6050282,4,B00G2PA0ES,"Synopsis:  Irving Zisman (played by Johnny Knoxville) is a recent widower who finds out he must also take care of his 8-year-old grandson Billy (Jackson Nicoll) after finding out his daughter has to go back to prison for a parole violation.  Intending to celebrate his newfound bachelorhood by living a life of total debauchery, Irving makes the plan to drive from Nebraska to North Carolina in an effort to leave Billy with his deadbeat dad Chuck (Greg Harris), who agrees to take Billy in solely because he'll get child support from the state for doing so (Irving also plans on disposing of his dead wife along the way, so her body accompanies them in the trunk for the entire drive.)  Though Irving sees Billy to be a nuisance, they both manage to form a bond with each other as they get into a myriad of antics along the way.  Will Irving leave Billy with his deadbeat dad, or will have have a change of heart?  And what in the world will happen to Irving's dead wife?

When I saw the previews for the film, I figured it was going to be weak because what was advertized on TV wasn't that laugh out loud funny.  Upon seeing the film, however, it was clear most of it couldn't be shown because it was too hot for TV. I laughed hard and often throughout seeing this movie.  Just when I thought they couldn't have topped it further, they took it up to a whole other level.  Jackson Nicholl was the perfect counterpart to Johnny Knoxville in this case, as he was as up to task on conducting pranks as any of the veteran Jackass crew would have been.  Kudos to everyone who got pranked yet weren't too stuck on themselves to appear in the film; the credits were long because everyone who agreed to allow their likeness to be used on camera received an actor credit as themselves.  Though the movie was wrought with bad manners, there were also elements that showed how real people still do good in the world on a day-to-day basis (such as a church group who was willing to grieve with a lone widower, or a biker group who stood up for children.)

Though people with more prudent tastes may be turned off by some of the vulgarity, fans of Jackass or Borat will undoubtedly love this film.  I recommend it to fans of comedies and age-appropriate people who want something fun to watch.",1384473600,77,2281,4.454326923076923
