3098402,5,B0012S62X8,"As a nurse, I have seen the devastating  and deteriorating  side  effects of conventional medicinal treatments for cancer.  Chemotherapy, just to name one, has not only debilitating side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, malaise, fatigue and weight loss, but also impairing effects on immunity, ""good cells"" and overall quality of life. I was fortunate to be able to attend a screening  of ""icurecancer.com"" in a local theater. The film included physicians, both western medicine and homeopathic, and cancer survivors who share their stories and success on curing themselves. It is a true eye opener and a must see for anyone who has had, has or knows someone who has cancer. The film gives much insight to the fact that, there are other cancer curing modalities other than western medicine. You do have a choice. Know your options!",1200787200,13,833,5.0510948905109485

8247565,1,B0012S62X8,"This is a horrible movie. Don't get me wrong; I agree with the message. There are natural alternatives to curing cancer. Unfortunately, this movie didn't talk about one of them. It was just a bunch of people just babbling on about nothing. And then at the end, there was a rock musician screaming into the screen. What was that all about.  I can say is SAVE YOUR MONEY. This movie is so not worth price. Like I said, I am not giving this a low rating because I disagree with the message. The message is right up my alley; that's why I rented it. It was just all over the place and really had no advice on how to cure cancer naturally. Not only that, but everyone (except Cynthia) looked like death, yet they were espousing how they cure cancer. One doctor who is natureopath had horrible skin. And another guy talked about alternative treatments was a big fat guy who looked near death. I hope no one else sees this movie because it doesn't help the argument that there are alternative treatments to cancer. There are.",1441324800,,1018,4.44385026737968

8247567,5,B0012S62X8,"One of the the most helpful and informative documentaries on cancer! Full of testimonies from the actual cancer patients who have successfully cured their diseases with alternative treatments themselves. Anyone who is suffering from cancer needs to watch this documentary FIRST before seeking medical treatment and, if possible, BEFORE SUBMITTING TO A BIOPSY (it could save your life)!",1408233600,3,385,5.655172413793103

8247569,1,B0012S62X8,This was intended as a Christmas gift for a family member who wanted the dvd very badly. It's pretty embarrassing having to present this as a gift to someone when the dvd case is literally falling to pieces in their hands!!!!,1389052800,,225,4.512195121951219
8247570,5,B0012S62X8,"I Cure Cancer should be part of everyone's library! People need to be proactive about their health! It confirms what I share with people who want to listen and take action.  I'm loaning my copy for one day to a colleague who's wife has AML(Acute myeloid leukemia) and is skeptical about alternative options.  Today, I found out another colleague's mother passed away over the weekend from cancer.  Neither took me seriously and that's just too bad.  We can't force people to take action, but we hope that they would at least do their research instead of being totally dependent on the conventional system.",1373241600,2,605,4.844660194174757
8247571,5,B0012S62X8,"Produced, edited, directed and presented by former martial arts champion turned actor turned documentary-maker Ian Jacklin, icurecancer.com is easily one of the most important documentaries I've ever seen.

To anyone who has Cancer, or knows someone who has, I urge you to see this eye-opening documentary and find out how its possible to cure yourself of the dreaded disease without going through the trauma of chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
Never underestimate the depths to which a government will sink to keep your pennies rolling into their pockets - it doesn't have to be that way. Watch this and know you have a choice.

I was absorbed from start to finish. An excellent, hugely important film by Ian Jacklin, whose passion and belief in the subject matter really comes through on the screen.

5 stars *****",1339200000,8,813,5.052238805970149
8247572,5,B0012S62X8,"Everyone will know someone, a friend, a relative or even themselves, who will get cancer.  You need to know all sides of the story regarding treatments.  I highly recommend this dvd...  It could be life safer.",1339200000,3,209,4.75
8247573,5,B0012S62X8,"This film and the associated web site directly influenced my wife's cancer treatment. We were able to learn so many things thatainstream doctors do not even know, or choose no to share.
I can honestly say that icurecancer and Ian jacklin helped save my wife's life and is part of the reason my wife remains free from the disease of cancer.
Thank you Ian",1339200000,9,353,4.53125
