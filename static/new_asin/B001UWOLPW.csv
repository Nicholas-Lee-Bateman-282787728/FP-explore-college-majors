3816041,4,B001UWOLPW,"I am such an Amanda Burton fan and try to see as many of her films as I can. I ran across this three episode series of Amanda Burton as Helen West, a dedicated crown prosecutor. Her life revolves around her work and her love, Detective Superintendent Geoffrey Bailey. This is an excellent series and much too short.

The three cases in this series are well done and all so very different. There are two main characters, Helen West and Connor Mullen as Detective Superintendent. They are connected via the cases they are working on and in their private life. And, Nicholas Woodeson plays Brian Redwood, Helen's implacable boss, always in the way, but in the end, he has her back. The three cases bring to life the good, the bad, and the ugly. Helen has the intellect and emotional base to bring the innocent justice. Her counterpart, Detective Superintendent Bailey has the guts and intelligence and know how to find the perpetrators and find them guilty.

The personal relationships are what bring these cases their finesse. The romance between Helen and Bailey goes hot and then cold when Bailey begins to have some qualms about marriage and lasting relationships. We are not privy to all of the past history or how they got together. But, we do believe them as a couple. Helen has friends who at her back and give her advice, but they are both perplexed by their heavy workloads. Somehow they make it work and at times we believe in them.

All three cases are well acted and even though the characters are not as well defined as I would like, they ring true. There was a lot of background noise which made it difficult to hear at times.  All in all I was disappointed that the series did not continue. I found this series by chance on Netflix, and I will look for more films that feature Amanda Burton.

3816042,2,B001UWOLPW,"Nice cast, but the stories are something like 75 minutes of sheer boredom which suddenly try to turn into a thriller in the last 15 minutes or so.  My wife and I could develop zero regard for the characters.",1309910400,4,207,4.3076923076923075
3816043,3,B001UWOLPW,"This is a decent enough drama show with the great Amanda Burton, (she adds class to anything she's in) however mystery fans will find not a courtroom drama without the courtroom scenes and dectective work done by others than helen. This is prime chick flick material (there's nothing wrong with that though)  about Helen and the murders that surround her!  In fact the murders are solved but not explained or followed through in complete detail. I did enjoy these three movies but they are more about helen's life than anything, I would say. The ep in which a child mollestor is rampaging through the chambers is the best because it's obvious , although we know he's a double murderer it's not explained if he's gonna get away with it. Probably because he is! which we must assume is the case because there is no scene of any awareness of these murders by the authorities in the show.  Maybe that's how it was written? These are adapted from a book series that was written by a real criminal lawyer so that's a plus but for mystery fans you may find this less than what you wanted unless you are into relationship drama.",1282262400,4,1120,4.562189054726368
3816044,1,B001UWOLPW,"If you're looking for detective story, this isn't it by a long shot.  It moves very slowly for the first half of the movie, concentrating mostly on Helen's sexual attractions.  This is to the extent that the men are focused more on Helen than solving crimes, Helen does absolutely nothing in that regard.  In fact, she just happens up on the crime through people with whom she works.  A little set up, don't you think.  It's just down right boring!

3816045,5,B001UWOLPW,"This is not West, Q.C. in the mode of the John Thall series.  Helen West is a prosecuting attorney, but this is not courtroom drama.  The protagonist is involved with a police detective and, as we first meet her, is in surgery for the removal of an ovarian cyst.  She is pulled in multiple directions, both in her personal and professional life, but still manages to become involved in cases whose nature evolves across a complex set of plot lines.  This is adult material, but not adult in the pornographic sense.  The sexual material is explicitly inferred rather than explictly rendered.  The characters are interesting and multi-dimensional, the ethos gritty but not overwhelmingly so.  The supporting cast is exceptional, with Anthony Howell of Foyle's War fame, Nicholas Woodeson from Rome, Foyle's War, and other productions and Conor Mullen as Chief Superintendent Bailey, Helen West's lover.  Amanda Burton is effective in the title role, but the plots are broad and deep and West is only one of many important characters in the stories' plot arcs.  Strong production values, good direction, but, unfortunately, no subtitles.  Turn up the volume if you want to hear all of the words and have half a chance of understanding them.  Highly recommended.",1265328000,5,1258,5.058252427184466
3816046,5,B001UWOLPW,"I remember watching these three episodes on tv several years ago and enjoyed them very much. I really like watching Amanda Burton's characters, she's a wonderful actress. If you're a fan of her work, you won't be disappointed. Viewing these episodes now brought back memories and still kept me on the edge of my seat.",1252195200,12,317,4.781818181818182
3816047,5,B001UWOLPW,"""The Helen West Casebook, a British mystery suspense television series, was produced in 2001 by Arrowhead Productions for the United Kingdom's ITV (Independent - i.e., commercial, stations).  A police procedural/thriller, it aired on ""A & E"" in the United States in 2002.  It is now released as a box set consisting of three feature-length crime dramas, totaling approximately 289 minutes.  The set features biographies of star, award-winning actress Amanda Burton; and author of the best-selling thrillers on which the series is based, the award-winning Frances Fyfeld.  Unfortunately, the set does not come equipped with subtitles, and it could use them, as the actors are seemingly following the current protocol in accents: use whatever you think best, and let the audience struggle.

Burton, who plays the title character, Helen West, a crown prosecutor, has won three National Television Awards for most popular actress in the U.K.  She also  stars in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Commander-Set-1/dp/B001B43IW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Commander Set 1</a>; and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Silent-Witness-Complete-1-2-Series-8-DVD-Set/dp/B000V2QYA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Silent Witness Complete 1&2 Series 8-DVD Set</a>.  (I absolutely loved Burton as ""Sam Ryan"" in ""Silent Witness,"" which she co-produced. I believe that show also aired on ""A & E"" in the U.S. for a while, but, unfortunately, it seems so far to have been released only in European DVD form.) (Burton also played ""Elly van Roekel"" in one episode of the 1990's series of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Van-der-Valk-Mysteries-Set-1/dp/B001Y44DKE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Van der Valk Mysteries, Set 1</a>). For years, I thought that Burton was the daughter of famed Welsh actor Richard Burton, but the Northern Ireland-born actress evidently is not.

Author Fyfield based her stories on her own experience as a crown prosecutor.  She has made her character here, Helen West, also a dedicated prosecutor, who deals in gruesome crimes - murder, domestic abuse, sexual assault -- and has an abiding commitment to truth and justice.  But West's personal life is messy: she can't quite seem to rationalize a troubled relationship with Geoffrey Bailey, (Conor Mullen,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reckless/dp/B0001WTUKI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reckless</a>) the handsome policeman with whom she works.  Other series regulars, both of whom turn in excellent jobs, include Anthony Howell (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Foyle-s-War-Series-1-5-From-Dunkirk-to-VE-Day/dp/B0024OW1QQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Foyle's War: Series 1-5 - From Dunkirk to VE-Day</a>); and Nicholas Woodeson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rome-The-Complete-Series/dp/B0028RXXE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rome: The Complete Series</a>).  The series, which is uniformly well-acted, also showcases Dermot Crowley (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bleak-House/dp/B000CEXG0U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bleak House</a>); Rita Tushingham (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Knack-and-How-to-Get-It/dp/B000069HZV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Knack... and How to Get It</a>;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Zhivago/dp/B001TOCCRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Zhivago</a>) and Martin Freeman (""The Office (U.K.),"" ""The Old Curiosity Shop.""). The episodes are:

Deep Sleep.  The wife of a respected pharmacist dies in her sleep.  West smells a rat; everyone urges her to move on.

Shadow Play.  Lowlife street sweeper Lycett is often seen in court, suspected of child abuse. He claims his long-lost daughter is the only reason he seems so inappropriately interest in other people's children.

A Clear Conscience.  West's new house cleaner/painter comes trailing suspicion in the high-profile death of her brother, a champion boxer.

The shows are unique, sophisticated, suspenseful, intriguing and well-written, told from a feminine perspective.  Plotting is intelligent and tight: the mysteries let us in on clues as they go. Production values are high: Location filming in some of London's darker and dirtier streets is satisfyingly atmospheric.  These are stories squarely aimed at the intelligent woman, who will enjoy them.",1251331200,27,4564,7.3646408839779
3816048,5,B001UWOLPW,"""The HELEN WEST CASEBOOK"" is a set of 3 full-length TV crime/mystery dramas with each episode simultaneously mixing person, professional, & romantic lives. Police crime fighting, prosecution, and after-office hours are packed into this British collection.

Frances Fyfield, English lawyer/author, worked for the Crown Prosecution Service and wrote the suspense book series ""Helen West Novels"".  The main character, Helen West, mimics the author's life as a CPS lawyer and romance addict. Is it based on Fyfield's own life and crime vocation?

Amanda Burton plays Helen West in the DVD set. She works in the office of Crime Prosecution Service as a Crown Prosecutor. She's beautiful, a fanatic at law work, a raucous lover, sassy, tactfully insubordinate, and bent on justice. She's a women's libber that men could drool over--and they do.  Burton wins awards with this type of character. See BURTON also in ""THE COMMANDER SET 1"", another recommended DVD set (see my review.)

One of my favorite lines is Miss West brushing off her amorous police beau, ""You're adorable, and so is a large donkey."" Later he responds, ""Could we not just be good lovers?"" Marriage potential?

Vol 1. DEEP SLEEP is 93 min. (Adapted novel was published in 1991)
  A death turns to murder since the victim could not have administered the final lethal dose of chloroform herself. CPS lawyer West seeks new evidence against her significant-other/lover/partner's suggestion to ""forget it."" Lover, 'copper' beau, police Chief Supt. Geoffrey Bailey, is played by Conor Mullen.
  Other regulars introduced in this first story are CPS boss Brian Redwood (Nicholas Woodeson) and Dinsdale Cotton (Anthony Howell) a lawyer office romantic want-to-be toward West.

Vol 2. SHADOW PLAY is 98 min. (Adapted from a 1993 novel by same title)
  A low-class man, Lycett (Robert Pugh), looks for his child, Ernie, (a 10-yr search) while continually getting arrested as a pervert.  West has her frisky relationship with cop Goeffrey escalating.  Miss West's clerk, Rose Darvey (Jessica Dyelowo), is ""working"" her way through the police force causing fights among ""the boys"". West is instructed to ""have a talk with her."" They connect after both test negative for possible pregnancy.
  There is a surprise, suspenseful conclusion you'll enjoy.

Vol 3. A CLEAR CONSCIENCE is 98 min. (Adapted book from 1994)
  West's apartment spring cleaner can also help paint the planned redecoration.  West and Chief Sgt. Bailey have cooled a bit.  Troublesome cases at work.  Bailey's incomplete murder case may have a connection to West's cleaning lady, Cath (Lynda Steadman.)
  Again police investigation, lawyer cases, romances, and secrets go spinning like tops, bouncing against each other.  One plot rubs against another till they fuse together to a climax. Good mystery stuff.

Extras: Burton and Fyfield bios. No subtitles for the dialect challenged or CC for the hearing impaired. Not for wee lads & lassies: violence, blood, and those semi-graphic 'romantic activity' situations.
Just really good crime, mystery, romance, police, and yes, lawyer drama.",1248825600,17,3105,5.322381930184805

I do not understand why there are so many negative reviews. I would give this a 4.5, if that were possible.  This is slow paced;  it is not fierce frenzied action, which is maybe what is now expected in mystery series.  Coupled with special effects and mountains of gratuitous violence.  This was more subtle.  The impact of human pathology, the ties that bind and unbind us, evolves little by little.  With a smattering of the ordinary and some romance, it is entirely watchable and enjoyable.",1500595200,,615,4.970588235294118
