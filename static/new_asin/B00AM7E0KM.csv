5450347,5,B00AM7E0KM,"I have never seen this series and the only reason I got it was because James Arness was in it, and I wasn't disappointed.

The pilot episode sets the stage for what is to be a great series, and is about a family who left Virginia just before the civil war started, about a mountain man (James Arness) who could destroy a barn with one punch, about a man who is destined to return to Virginia to save his parents and ending up dead because of the civil war, and last, about a boy who returns to find his father and ends up on the run because he deserted an army he had no right to be in, and a sheriff he had to shoot to save his neck from a linch mob.

It is about a family who travelled west to find a better way of life, of the hardships they endured that no one today could imagine, and interwoven are stories of how settlers coped with the ever present fear of having their name wiped out in a blink of an eye. It was a time of hardship for both the white man and the indians, but not all was as bad as it semed. Through all this the Macahans found a way to survive, but when things got a bit rough Zeb always seemed to appear to save the day.

When the series starts it sees the Macahans homesteading a piece of land which once belonged to long gone slettlers, etching out a life from less than nothing, and Zeb going after a bounty hunter who was after Luke (the deserter). The Macahans put down roots twice before they found a place to call home in Wyoming and ended up rich from horses and a gold mine.

Staring James Arness (Zeb), Eva Marie Saint (Kate), Bruce Boxleitner (Luke), Kathryn Holcomb (Laura), William Kirby Cullen (Josh), Vicki Schreck (Jessie) and Trisha Noble (Aunt Molly) made up the Macahan family. With a fine cast of surporting actors made this an exciting series for anyone interested in the old western days, when any day could be your last, where you are lucky to live to a ripe old age, when a bullet was mostly the only way to resolve a dispute.

For 40 hours I enjoyed a series (of this kind) I have not delighted in for a long time. In some respects I envy the time, but it was a time of much hardship and a strong back was needed.

I would be glad to recommend this series to anyone wanting to know what the life of pioneers was like, who made the best of what was at hand, and survived a time we can only imagine. This box set deserves five stars and gets them from me.",1380153600,10,2405,4.11727078891258
5450348,5,B00AM7E0KM,"Can't understand why this box set isn't yet available in USA DVD format.  As one of the most outstanding western mini-series of all time, surely it would sell here as well as or better than it is in Europe.  Please produce this set in USA format soon!!",1374451200,23,252,4.340425531914893
5450349,4,B00AM7E0KM,"These dvd's are region 2 only and is an official studio release from Warner Brothers. This set also includes the original pilot The Macahans and yes, you can elect to remove the sub-titles! When you put a disc in and the menu appears just click on NO SUBTITLES. Did I mention you can do away with the subtitles??? OK, good. The dvd's are well protected by the case they are held in don't shift around any. The only downside is that there is no list of episodes, but you can go to Wiki and print one out easy enough. As for the picture quality, even with an HDMI connection the images look good, but the colors will not jump off the screen at you even though this set says ""remastered."" The sound is ok, after all this was 1978 folks and thats why I'm not playing them through my sound system, your tv speakers will do just fine here. These dvd's will even play on your computer as an added bonus which is probably a good thing. I have a 60 inch Sony HDTV and a bigger screen will really show you the flaws, ironically these shows look better on my 30 inch Dell. But , I have no reason to complain. The entire series uncut for your enjoyment. Who knows, if they sell enough of these in Europe it will convince WB to release them in the region 1 format. I have looked at the first two discs and have discovered that night scenes are washed out and blotchy, made me think I was looking at VHS. Day scenes were much better, almost laserdisc quality. These are not remastered episodes, they just slapped them onto dvd with no effort to clean them up. I recently discovered that this set plays on my Oppo 103 dvd player. I have no idea why because this is a region 2 dvd. I have another region 2 dvd that will not play on my Oppo (Colossus The Forbin Project).",1363219200,13,1754,4.223214285714286

The picture is crisp and the sound is perfect but why it was a Danish company rather than an American that produced it is very strange. This series was one of the best westerns ever made and it hasn't dated at all. James Arness towers above the rest of the cast and when he isn't the main focus of the story I have to admit its not as good as when he is but all in all the whole thing is wonderful. All you have to do is click on No Subtitles and you can watch as you did when it was first shown only with a better picture. Buy it you won't be sorry.",1361318400,15,1074,5.142857142857143

8553537,5,B00AM7E0KM,"I love this show but I'm not crazy enough to pay some crook $180.00 for this complete set, a set that was only $80 a couple months ago. So instead I bought the seasons separate, seasons 1 & 2 region 1,, season 3 parts 1 & 2 region 2. A small price for a region free player will fix the region playing problem between region 1 & 2, complete series with region free player a little over $120 with about 60 bucks left over. It pays to shop around! Hope this helps those wanting to buy this series.",1448323200,,494,4.051020408163265

8553542,1,B00AM7E0KM,"I purchased the first season of this series some time ago and loved it, but I purchased the entire 14 DVD set from European Movies and never received it. No tracking information and having to contact seller serveral times I finally get this email that has a tracking link which tracks it to a distination over 1300 miles away telling me it has been at the post office since 12th of December, then I contacted Amazon...whom was very helpful. Then I get another email from European Movies telling me they sent me the wrong tracking link , so I track this new tracking number and there is no such number registered...what a huge run around and this was all a week or more after the said delivery date. I have never had a more stressful Christmas. I will continue dealing with Amazxon, but will never deal with European Movies again.",1388448000,,829,4.533333333333333
8553543,3,B00AM7E0KM,"The picture was great but the sound system could be better.
It was very soft and I had to bump up the volume to very high just to hear normal conversation

2ndly, there were no English substitles as this was produced in Denmark.

Last but not least, can someone confirm that Season 5 is the last of this series?  The storyline seems incomplete.
Cheers!",1387065600,4,352,4.46875
8553544,5,B00AM7E0KM,I was verry pleased when i found this set for the first time after so many years. I have seen them  in the seventies. I wonder why WARNER have not brought this serie out sooner. At the time here in Belgium and the rest of Europe the serie was a great success. It seems to be recording from the old VHS videos. But wat in heavens name we care. It was en it still is good old fashion western. It was also one of the first to use the guns that where actualy used at that period of the west. So one thing i have the say is buy it and enjoy it.

8553545,5,B00AM7E0KM,"I was a little concerned at first as all the info about the series was in Scandinavian and I thought perhaps I would have to watch them all with English subtitles but I soon realised when I put the first dvd into the player it was okay!
I am very pleased with the complete Collection, a good purchase I would say  !!!",1383868800,,317,4.112903225806452
