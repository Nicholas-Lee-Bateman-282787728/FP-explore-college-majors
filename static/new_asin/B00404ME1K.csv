4237965,5,B00404ME1K,"This is a wonderful movie for any girl that thinks they want to grow up. Abbey Jensen (Debby Ryan) has been dreaming of becoming 16 since a little girl. She wants to have a sweet 16 and do everything on her wish-list. However, when she makes a wish to be treated like an adult, a horrible mistake goes wrong and she ends up being an adult. This movie will hopefully show teenagers who want to grow up and move out that there is more to it. :) I know it did for me. I would highly highly recommend this movie to anyone!",1341964800,2,518,4.088235294117647
4237966,5,B00404ME1K,"What can I say ? Debby Ryan OMG!! This movie was really sweet.  I liked the part near the end where Debby said she couldn't believe the things she was into were so important to her.  As she went through her wishes, it was interesting when she came to the conclusion of enjoying things in the moment and not wanting to be in such a hurry to grow up.  You basically grow up in an instant anyway, so enjoy what you have while you have it.  I liked the way the film ended.  First with Debby using her final wish to erase everything and start over, plus all the final scene surprises.  Great movie.",1341532800,2,593,4.157894736842105
4237967,3,B00404ME1K,"Girl gets wishes granted, but then regrets them and learns to appreciate her life. It's a pretty old story and has been reused in hundreds of teen girl movies. Still, 16 Wishes isn't a bad retake for the intended audience. It's a bit unrealistic and tough to suspend disbelief during some scenes (like when the girl suddenly becomes an adult). A bit more time with the script would have helped. The better moments are more of a take on Dickens' Christmas Tale. It's certainly not a classic in the genre but should entertain young girls for a while.",1330560000,9,548,4.6020408163265305

This movie was blended with comedy/drama (in a sense),& heartwarming also a good message to becareful what you wish for. And remember what you have right in front of you. You have plently time for things at 16 yers old. Debby Ryan might just be a great actress after all.",1297123200,4,438,4.226190476190476

4237972,5,B00404ME1K,"16 Wishes tells the story of Abby Jensen, a girl who's been eager to reach her 16th birthday and has kept a secret wish list since she was a little girl.  When the Big Day actually arrives, utter disaster strikes, leaving Abby to think her birthday is ruined.  But when a mysterious box of magical birthday candles arrives to turn things around, Abby's 16 Wishes start to come true.  Her day gets better and better...until she makes one wish that threatens to change everything.

Abby Jensen has been making a secret wish-list for her Sweet 16th Birthday ever since she was a little girl. Her and her best friend, Jay run into a mysterious woman named Celeste. Celeste gives her candles with numbers on them. Everytime she makes a wish, it comes true. Abby makes a wish that everyone treats her like an adult, and it comes true as well, but not the way Abby wanted. She turns 22 and loses all her friends and her parents kick her out. She must figure out the rules of the wishes and tries to become 16 again before midnight, or else the wish becomes permanent. I highly recommend 16 WISHES!!!",1289520000,25,700,4.392307692307693

4238017,4,B00404ME1K,Not quite 5 stars.  The story was quite good.  It kept me guessing till the end on how she was going to fix the problem which one of the wishes caused.  It is a good family movie with a moral to it while it entertains.  No bad language or sexual content.  Well written and mostly well acted.  There were a few rough spots.  The music was typical teen movie music.  The lines were pretty good and well delivered.  It is worth watching.  The old warning: be careful what you wish for - you might get it - is the basis of tis story.  Parents might enjoy watching this as much to enjoy seeing a typical teen get what they need by getting what they think they want.  Watch and see!,1431129600,2,676,4.115384615384615

Great acting and directing talent, Debby Ryan is going to make you fall in love with this movie.
