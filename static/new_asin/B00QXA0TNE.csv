6889296,2,B00QXA0TNE,"I am going to be reviewing just the movie ""Sofia the First: The Curse of Princess Ivy"" and not the bonus episodes included. There will also be spoilers, so take note of the review.

Brief Review (little to no spoilers):
Pros:
1. Rapunzel makes an appearance (with her own song).
2. Animation, voice acting, etc are great like always.

Cons:
1. I honestly found the story to be kind of lacking and kind of contrived (especially the lesson).
2. There's not as much fun or cheerfulness in this movie as the other movie or episodes.

Lengthy Review with Spoilers.

First of all, I am a huge fan of Sofia the First. Ever since I started watching it, it has become one my favorite Disney series. Sofia the First has a huge cast of characters, a variety of things happening, and a lot of humor even for adult fans.

The ""Sofia the First: The Curse of Princess Ivy"" is around a 45 minute movie (two episodes worth) where Amber finally finds out about Sofia's amulet.

The main problem I have with the movie is how the story (and the characters) treats Amber. In the movie, after Amber finds out about Sofia's amulet, Amber later secretly takes it without permission (while Sofia is sleeping) and uses it to try to call a Disney Princess.

After this occurs, the rest of the movie is about ""teaching Amber a lesson"". The problem I have with this is that it seems contrived and I don't think Amber needed to be taught any ""lessons"" in this movie. Personally I found both Sofia and Cedric constant criticism of Amber to be unfounded, and it also made the movie not as cheerful as the other movies (or episodes).

Finally I felt with the way Sofia acted, it was kind of out of character (I'll explain more below). There have been several times where something bad happens to Sofia and Sofia still keeps her positive self (S1E8 - ""The Princess Test"" is a good example), and there are plenty of times where Sofia lost the amulet (or thought she was going to lose the amulet) and still also kept to her positive self. In this movie it seems Sofia didn't take it as well. However there's one moment at the movie where I felt that she was really out of character honestly (I'll explain later below).

As an adult fan of Sofia the First, I find the writing and stories to be excellent, and there's a great sense of continuity and development with all the characters. However I felt this movie took a few steps back.

Here's a brief summary of the problems I have with the movie:
Amber wants to try out Sofia's amulet just once. Amber ends up doing it (without Sofia's permission). The rest of the movie is about trying to teach Amber a lesson. It makes the lesson, the story, etc feel really contrived (like this movie is there just to try to development Amber's character). The problem with that is, even if you ignore the movie, Amber doesn't really change from the movie at all. Going into the movie, Amber was (is) very considerate of others' feelings. After the movie, Amber is the same (that is, you probably wouldn't notice; plus they even did a memory wipe for everyone except Sofia at the end, which makes the point of the movie make even less sense (Amber doesn't know about the amulet's powers anymore at the end) as there's not much that it will contribute to the continuity of the series).

The main issue is that the reason for the conflict in this story was simply due to Amber's ignorance of Sofia's amulet (Sofia never actually told Amber not to take her amulet, or that there were limitations to the amulet's uses, or that it may curse anyone) rather than any malice from Amber.

The rest of the movie (after the conflict happens) focuses on Amber and trying to teach her (or trying to get Amber to learn) a lesson.

The problem again is that the reason for the conflict in the movie in the first place was never due to Amber's malice (or selfishness) but due to Amber's ignorance.

In the movie itself, Amber really hesitated in taking Sofia's amulet. Amber ended up taking it without Sofia's permission but Amber herself said that she'll give it right back after (she only wanted to try it out). Now, you can say Amber was selfish in doing that, however the major problem I have with this is that Amber didn't know of all the drawbacks.

And technically speaking, Sofia said that she promised to never take the Amulet off; Sofia never actually said that it shouldn't be removed (major difference). For example, Amber probably thought Sofia said that their father told Sofia not to take it off because maybe Sofia just wanted to show their father that Sofia appreciated the gift (the amulet).

So, it could make sense (to Amber) that it wouldn't be okay for Sofia to remove the amulet but (someone else) could remove it without issue (again, Amber didn't know of any curses or drawbacks from the amulet; Sofia only told Amber that she promised never to take it off).

Now, you may think my reasoning is contrived but personally I think it make sense. It's important to note Amber is very sensitive. When Amber goes ""bad girl mode"", it is usually because she is afraid of losing something (not being cared for anymore, not as important to her father, etc). It's not because she thinks the person (Sofia for example) is getting something that she doesn't deserve. This major difference is important. In this movie, Amber is shown that she is a bit hurt that Sofia got a neat amulet and she didn't get one, and she is also a bit hurt that Sofia can't share it (Amber isn't told or really explained why Sofia can't share it; Amber was simply told that Sofia promised their father that she (Sofia) wouldn't take it off).

Amber is also a person that likes a lot of things and likes to try them out. Considering Amber's knowledge at the time, I don't consider Amber to have been selfish considering she just wanted to try it out, before giving it back (the common definition of selfish is being concerned with only yourself ""and"" being inconsiderate of others feelings; Amber was being concerned with herself but she was also very considerate).

Amber may seem shallow and vain and selfish (sometimes she is) at times but she has consistently shown to be considerate and caring of others (S1E1, S1E5, S2E1, etc).

Overall, that's why I give this movie just a 2/5. I find Amber's action to be reasonable ""but"" the movie really tries to make Amber seem like she done something terrible to Sofia, and that she (Amber) needed 40 minutes worth of lectures from both Sofia and Cedric about what she (Amber) did was wrong.

Now, what they could have done was made Amber forget everything and really made her to be the bad girl (in this movie just to have the movie have her learn a lesson) but that fact that her fault was due to her ignorance rather than her malice or selfishness is appreciated. For example, if they even just made Sofia tell Amber the drawbacks of the amulet and Amber took the amulet anyway, that'd change things dramatically (it would actually make the lessons in the movie make more sense).

However they avoided that and Amber was really considerate and reasonable when she took Sofia's amulet just to try it out (again, I try to defend her reasoning above on why I don't think she was selfish in doing so). So that's why I give it an extra star (Amber stayed in character). Personally though, I find the overall plot to be contrived simply because ""Sofia the First"" is such a great series (IMO) in terms of character development and conflict, and this movie really didn't do as well in terms of the conflict or lesson as the other episodes. If I had to compare an episode, I think S2E8 ""When You Wish Upon a Well"" was a well done episode where Amber does do something bad and she did need a lesson.

Summary:
Amber (considering her knowledge of the situation at the time) took Sofia's amulet without permission (though she said she would give it back; she just wanted one try). Bad stuff happens (Princess Ivy appears). Sofia and Cedric spend the next 40 minutes lecturing and criticizing poor Amber. At the end, everyone except Sofia gets a memory wipe which makes the point of the movie make even less sense.

Finally, after Sofia tells Amber that she saved the day, Amber says that doesn't sound like some she (Amber herself) would do, and Sofia agrees and says I know, which is kind of an insensitive thing to say honestly and it really felt ""Out of Character"" for Sofia (Sofia is almost always considerate of others; so honestly I find the dialogue at the end to be out of character and insensitive of Sofia).

I love both Amber and Sofia equally but honestly this movie was not as cheerful as others, the conflict was contrived and felt really forced (poor Amber), and the reset at the end made me only give the movie a 2/5.

(Background stuff - Why I wrote this review and my thoughts on the series, characters, and the movie):

Amber is one of my favorite characters of all time. She is the typical character that seems shallow, vain, and selfish but there's a lot more to her than that and honestly you can even argue that she's all positive. Instead of shallow or vain, you can simply say she is self-conscious in a positive way (like she really cares to act a certain way around others; she cares about being popular but another aspect of being popular is wanting to be friends with everyone).

While she is been shown selfish (wanting something and being inconsiderate of others when trying to get that thing), it is usually only happens as a response to her fear of losing something (the pilot movie, S2E8 When You Wish Upon A Well, etc). There are a few cases where she is kind of selfish and wants something for herself (S2E1 most notably where she intentionally tries to take away James's birthday so she can have one herself) but even those cases, she goes back on it and becomes considerate of others again.

Usually, Sofia the First does a great job at handling Amber. They presented a very kind and loving girl, and they have been consistent with her character throughout the series. She is still shown to be the case in the movie.

The overall main problem with the movie though is how inconsiderate of Sofia and Cedric were to Amber's feelings and circumstance.

I find the lesson of the movie to be poor because Amber is the ""more than meets the eye"" type character (while I do love both Amber and Sofia equally, I consider Amber to be the kinder and nicer of the two since Amber has been consistently shown to be kind, even when things don't go her way, while Sofia goes from kind and polite to blunt and mean if things don't go her way).

The major thing is that it's a really poor lesson to assume the worse of Amber or anyone in this case without knowing the full details (why they did it, what of their knowledge when they did it, how far they would go, etc).

Finally, the movie does the ""tough love"" thing with Amber but Amber isn't a ""needs tough love to learn lessons"" type of character but rather a ""be sensitive about it"" type of character. The two distinctions are important. It's also poor lesson to also assume someone would be as receptive to a certain way (how you talk with them about something they did that you didn't want them to do). Amber isn't a ""needs tough love"" person, she has consistently shown to be if you talk with her in a considerate and sensitive way, she'll follow through.

Overall, I found the movie to be poorly done in story.

Anyway, this is my analysis and review of the movie (and the characters in relation to the episodes and series as a whole). I'll be honest and say what drove me to write this review is because I am a major fan of Amber (and Sofia equally too) and the series as a whole is one of my favorites of all time. Amber was mistreated in this movie (considering her circumstance and knowledge) and I felt Sofia wasn't as kind or considerate like her usual self (being a bit out of character).

So it only gets a 2/5 from me due to the above.",1437696000,4,11934,4.503700277520814
