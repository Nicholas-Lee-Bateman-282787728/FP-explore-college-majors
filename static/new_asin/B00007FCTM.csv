1808170,5,B00007FCTM,"I think the important thing here is ""What do the Kids Think?"" - not the parents, and my kids, grandkids, and their friends simply LOVE this CD.  They sing with it, they dance with it and they don't even have to watch it to do so. All they need is to hear it (talking 2 to 5 year olds here...). It's well worth the money just to watch them watch or listen to this DVD.

1808171,2,B00007FCTM,"I know there have been a few different voices for Barney since the original retired and while sometimes you can hear a subtle difference, this one is *awful*. At times he sounds almost as if he is talking normally and other times it's so exaggerated he just sounds bad. Even my 2 1/2 year old noticed the change. Stick w/ the earlier releases, this new guy isn't cutting it.",1042416000,4,374,4.434782608695652
1808172,2,B00007FCTM,In the past I've bought some Barney tapes and discovered that they weren't new shows at all. Sometimes they take old TV shows and put them in new boxes to sell. I try to avoid buying these tapes but sometimes the packaging will fool you. This is what they have done again. The box does not say that this is a collection of recycled clips from the free Public television series but that's all it is. My sons quickly became bored and walked away. Save your money and just tape these episodes off the TV if you want them.,1041552000,15,518,4.242424242424242

1808210,5,B00007FCTM,"I bought this video for the car before going on vacation 8 hours away from home. My toddler loves this Barney video and watches it frequently on Netflix. She was thrilled to have it in the car, and even more excited when I played the accompanying CD that had her favorite songs from the video on it. The only thing that would have made it better is if the CD had the ""I Love You"" song on it - I was surprised it wasn't included. However, if you're little one is a Barney fan, this still deserves 5 stars.",1368748800,,504,4.101010101010101

1808212,5,B00007FCTM,"I love Barney and I was interested in this one because it has a lot of the common nursery rhymes, my daughter is singing those songs at the daycare and loves them. Plus she loves to dance and she loves singing them (well at least she tries too). I would definitely recommend it to someone.",1361145600,,289,4.2727272727272725

1808234,5,B00007FCTM,"My son is 18 months old and obsessed with Barney. Now all these songs are stuck in my head and thank goodness they are likeable. I enjoy watching it with him and singing along. This is probably the 6th Barney DVD I have purchased and by far it's the ""Greatest Hits"" of Barney with back to back song after song. Buy it - it's adorable.",1316044800,2,334,4.153846153846154

1808236,5,B00007FCTM,My daughter loves barney and this is her 2nd copy because the first one became a bit scratched and wouldn't play and so I had to replace it! This is one of her most favorite dvds of Barney! It features really great songs and they are simple to sing and my little girl knows each song and it is just great! It also comes with a song only music cd so you can take it along for a car ride or pop it in the dvd player also! I highly recommend this to any barney lover!!,1295481600,4,465,3.8541666666666665
1808237,4,B00007FCTM,"I thought this DVD was Barney-rific!  Full of music and silly songs, my boys were dancing all over.  It is funny too because they typically don't prefer to watch Barney, but they do love anything with music.  I love that it came with a bonus CD that I can keep in the car.  This is a great DVD for both old and new Barney fans!",1276387200,3,327,3.9846153846153847
1808238,5,B00007FCTM,My granddaughter loves watching TV on a cold and rainy day. And this looked like a good one to add to her collection. She loves it. It was a good buy.,1274832000,,150,3.870967741935484
1808239,5,B00007FCTM,"***Parent Annoyance Meter Rating: 3*** (1= not annoying whatsoever, I would watch this without my child - 5=If I have to watch this again, someone better bring me a straitjacket)

This is one of the Barney DVDs with obvious higher quality production. There is lots of dancing and singing and my two-year-old really likes it. She actually picked it out herself at F.Y.E. and she had her choice of several other Barney episodes. I'd recommend it.",1258243200,2,444,4.842105263157895
1808240,5,B00007FCTM,"I'm very surprised by so many negative reviews on this DVD. My daughter is 18 months old, and this is, by far, her favorite Barney DVD. It has loads of singing and dancing--which are most entertaining for her--and it's not plot-heavy. Some people have commented that Barney has a different voice in this DVD, but I honestly never noticed a difference. Had I not read the reviews here, I wouldn't have even thought about it. I highly recommend this DVD.",1245542400,,452,4.6625

1808242,2,B00007FCTM,"I totally agree with what a previous viewer stated about the new Barney voice.  I loved Barney when I was younger ... I used to be a memeber of the fan club - I've got the t-shirts, photos and I have even begun to collect the original videos so when I have kids they can watch them.  I do not enjoy the new voice of Barney.  He is trying too hard to sound the same and it sounds awful.",1099353600,,385,3.848101265822785
