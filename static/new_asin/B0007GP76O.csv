All 3 of my children Love them. I buy them as gifts for friends with little ones too!",1452556800,,188,4.25

8047241,5,B0007GP76O,"For the price I paid this show is great. I bought it for my two year old daughter and my six year old son even gets into it. It has 4 episodes on it. One is about a flower that eats ice cream, but when someone judges to hastily and plans to replant the tree far far away, it is up to Todd and his friends to help change his mind. Another episode is about a porcupine who has trouble finding a dance partner because his quills keep poking everyone. They must find a way to help him keep control of his quills so he can be in the square dance. Than there is another about how pickles starts a band and only he likes the music. The others have to learn to accept everyone elses likes and dislikes. The last one is about pickles socks smelling bad because he never takes them off. They try to find a nice way to tell him he stinks. I like the show because it teaches good leason about accepting everybodys differences. Also the bright colors help keep my daughter hooked.",1416614400,,967,4.148936170212766
8047242,5,B0007GP76O,My 4 1/2 year old son loves this show! We have every episode now and couldn't be happier. This is def a cartoon a parent can sit thru and enjoy too!,1355270400,,148,3.806451612903226
8047243,5,B0007GP76O,"Don't be fooled by the simple drawings or you might not realize that the show is VERY VERY special. The show has a special message. It teaches toddlers about acceptance and diversity.

Not many cartoons teach your kids about how normal it is to be different, to come from different backgrounds, to have different tastes, etc. The show deals with very important yet simple ideas/ lessons of life.

It's a really smart and fun way for young kids to learn while they watch a fun show.",1134691200,3,481,4.5813953488372094
8047244,5,B0007GP76O,"My 4 year old loves all of these Toddworld DVDs.  They have all of the elements that she finds funny and teaches great lessons per episode.  My 20 month old also enjoys watching them, though probably not getting as much out of it.  Very bright and colorful, silly and smart.",1127865600,2,274,4.44
