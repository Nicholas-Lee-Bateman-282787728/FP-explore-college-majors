8077279,3,B000AARK62,"I've purchased several DVD box sets from DIAMOND ENTERTAINMENT and have found the DVDs to be free of defects, with strong audio. Video quality has been variable, but never so poor as to be unwatchable.

About a third of the titles in THE SPAGHETTI WESTERN aren't available on any other multi-movie box set. Noticeably absent here is Lee Van Cleef, who made more European westerns than any other American actor. On the other hand, his public domain films are in wide circulation.
