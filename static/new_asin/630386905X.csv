728205,5,630386905X,"The scene starts on a gorgeous summer's day in Russia, not too far outside Moscow.  Idyllic, but at what price comes Stalin's 'utopia'?  This movie  demonstrates a case of this seeming utopia crashing down for one family.  Stalin's victims included everybody, the young, the old, those opposed to  Stalin, and those who truly believed in the Soviet dream.  The performances  given by the actors in this movie are extraordinary, and the depth  portrayed by their characters is amazing.  The tragedy is one that was  repeated over and over through Stalin's and Soviet rule, and this movie  stands as a memorial for us to remember that.",954201600,7,633,4.933333333333334
728206,1,630386905X,"Imagine yourself the following plot for the movie: to the house of a high-rank SS/Nazi officer comes a jew. Long time ago he was a first love of the Nazi's wife, and still loves her. And was somewhere abroad, running  away in 1933. And meanwhile the Big Nazi was building a bright future for  all German people, the jew became the agent of Gestapo, and a right hand of  Himmler. And actually has come to arrest the true national-socialist. Does  this sound to you believable, or is it totally disgusting?
This is about  how the story told in Michalkov's movie is related to the true history of  Russia in 1930s. Not only the plot is highly unrealistic, the good and bad  are really turned upside down. It's a pity, actually, since practically any  other movie of Michalkov is quite good. This one is even directed poorly.",951955200,4,821,4.575342465753424
728207,5,630386905X,"This film is a painful look at the effect Stalin's terror had on even his closest officials. The film itself is beautiful, set at a peaceful country ""dacha"".  The action begins to pick up when Mitya arrives.  The  Mitya and Kotov characters provide an interesting contrast of Russian men.  Mitya is a hollowed out soul searching for reminents of his past life and  Kotov is the ideal Russian who always believes in his homeland. Several  scenes are very poignant, particularly the one where Marussia realizes that  Mitya has returned.  The conclusion is painful and frightening, but that is  how Stalin's crimes were to the Russian people.",944784000,3,639,4.952830188679245

However, I learned that the slow pace was vital to the character development, and that exposition was essential to understanding the relationship between Kotov, his young daughter Nadya, the antagonist Mitya, and (in a not so subtle way) Stalin.

728319,4,630386905X,"What if a great Russian writer like Chekhov had written a story or play about the time of Stalin? The result would be something like Burnt by the Sun (Utomlennye solntsem) a poignant story of people living quietly in the peaceful countryside in the 1936 Soviet Union.

The story of Burnt by the Sun unfolds like that of a stage play, taking place in one day. We are introduced to a Russian revolution hero Colonel Sergei Petrovich Kotov (Nikita Mikhalkov), his wife Maroussia (Ingeborga Dapknait) and daughter Nadia (directors daughter Nadezhda Mikhalkova). To Sergeis happy family living in an idyllic countryside comes Uncle Mitya (Oleg Menshikov), who has suddenly disappeared more than ten years ago.

Mikhalkovs Oscar-winning drama slowly reveals why Mitya had to leave the village years ago, and why he has come back. Told in an understated way, Burnt by the Sun often looks more like a tragi-comedy. The beautifully-shot film has romances, mysteries to be solved and sly humor that is sprinkled throughout the story.

The best thing of the film would be the little girl Nadir, who is always adorable, representing pure innocence. The film is overlong (Chekhov would have ended it fifteen minutes earlier), but it is still powerful and emotional.",1391558400,,1252,5.067961165048544
728345,4,630386905X,"This is an interestingly broken-backed film.  Set during the Stalinist era during one idyllic summer, it begins by contrasting the lives of Dmitriy (Oleg Menshikov) and Sergey (Nikita Mikhailkov) - the one a dilettante musician and pianist, the other a colonel in the Russian army and favorite of the premier.  They both have a claim on Marusya (Ingeborg Dapkunaite): Srgey is married to her, and Dmitriy was a former lover of hers.  It seems that the film's moral scheme is relatively straightorward: Dmitriy is talented but feckless, while Sergey seems virtualy untouchable - not only does he have a great career, but he is happily married as well.  However director Mikhailkov turns the tables on our expectations and thereby transforms BURNT BY THE SUN into a penetrating analysis of how dictatorships corrupt everyone around them.  Concepts of 'good' and 'evil# no longer prevail: everyone simply does what it takes in order to survive.  The ending is both shocking yet predictable.  Visually speaking, the film contrasts the idyllic surroundings of Dmitriy's dacha with the behavior of the protagonists - it seems that no one can actively enjoy the delights of glorious summer weather, for fear of being discovered.  Life at that time must have been precarious, with no one actually being sure as to what would happen to them next.  BURNT BY THE SUN is slow-moving, but Mikhailkov's camera has an eye for telling detail and significant gestures.  Definitely worth watching.",1386028800,,1479,5.125
728346,4,630386905X,"This film has perhaps the best child actress you've ever seen: sweet, lively, and unspoiled.  Perhaps the whole point is to draw your attention to her world instead of the impossible complexities of the adults.  My only gripe is that the character of Mitya should have had more revealing dialogue.

728413,5,630386905X,"The film ""Burnt by the Sun"" captures the period of Soviet history just before Stalin's Great Purges, I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Russia and its gruesome past.  Nikita Sergeyevich Mikhalkov produced, directed and even starred in it (along with his daughter) needless to say there was something that he really wanted to get across.

In one of his interviews he defended the film as an artistic creation rather than a historical documentary, but held that his portrayal of that time in history was reality for him-- it was the way that he viewed and understood the events of that period.  He presented the events of the time from many different viewpoints without laying the blame on any one in particular, ""what right do we have, looking with the hindsight of the 1990's, to analyze any of the past eras and condemn them for what happened then?""  Nikita Sergeyevich claimed that he wanted to go beyond judging the era, ""I am only trying to show through a tragic perspective, the charm of a simple existence: of children continuing to be born, of people loving each other, living their life's moments, and having faith that all that was happening around them was for the best.""

The title served as a sort of backbone for the film.  It was borrowed from a popular song of the 1930's.  It was originally composed by Jerzy Petersburski as a Polish tango called To Ostatnia Niedziela.  Eventually the song tangoed its way into the Soviet Union under the name and picked up the name Burnt by the Sun.  The director first heard it in his brother's movie and liked it so much that he stole it for his own film and weaved it in and out of nearly every scene.  Nadia hummed it while she danced the tango in the hallway ""cha, cha, cha.""  Kirk loaded it into the phonograph during breakfasted.  Dimitri strummed it on his guitar after his pitiful tale and so on.

The film was set in 1936 over the course of one sunny day. Sergei Kotov, Maroussia and the rest of their large family were relishing life at their country house.  The house had a sort of Chekhovian feel to it: full of light, charm, eccentricities and the most divine music.  Nikita Sergeyevich showed the past in this way in order to set up a warning toward the future.

This film is never boring and, for Americans, yields an incredible sense of Russian culture under Stalin; however, the tale is not at all limited to misery -- there is no shortage of light humor and very interesting day to day life experience here.
This film tells the story of a (very likeable) major Russian hero, (retired and living at an art camp of sorts), and his lovely family, and how the tide of his life turns as a direct result of Stalin's lunatic madness and paranoia. Now, I want to say up front that I usually hate smooshy script and there's none of that here, albeit, there's a basic underlying love story.

I seriously doubt it. Here we have a truly great film masterpiece by Nikita Mikhalkov...that of General Serfei Kotov, a great hero of the revolution. He has always tried to live like and ideolize himself as a true upstanding communist and respected revolutionary war hero. He is with his family at his dacha, where other guests are present, vacationing, also. However, his bucholic lakeside ""visit"" moves from one of restful bliss to sheer and utter terror as he realizes he has become another victim of Stalin's supreme spying league. Interwoven are other details and bits of the lives of other characters. Absolutely one of the most beautifully filmed movies ever committed to film (think of the photography of ""Days of Heaven"")... just breathtaking to look at. The nature of the story makes it somewhat hard to discuss, in review here, without giving away more than one should, and I do not intend to make this review a ""Spoiler"". Just trust me, it's a ""keeper"".

Nikita Mikhalkov plays General Sergei Kotov, a hero of the revolution who is holidaying in his dacha with his family and whose nave love for the Soviet motherland is rewarded in the same fashion that Stalin rewarded most of the genuine revolutionary communists. But this is not the only story; there are many other little stories that portray the lives of people trapped between the past and the present, between lies and truths, between illusions and realities. Oleg Menshikov is extraordinary in this sense. He plays Mitya, a NVKD agent and an old friend of Kotov's wife, whose ruthlessness is the product of the Soviet spying apparatus, but who has also managed to preserve something noble in his personality from his tranquil past.

728547,5,630386905X,"Viewers (this includes most of the professional reviewers) who saw this movie as the last day of freedom for Kotov, an up-from-the ranks Soviet hero, beloved by his men and honored by a grateful nation, saw only half the movie. The charming family enjoying a lazy summer day in the country, the devotion between Kotov and his daughter while doubting his wife's fidelity and his  growing realization that  his friend, Stalin, has ordered his arrest is movie enough! But there is more....

At second look, the family life is far from idyllic.  The family (the dacha is theirs, not Kotov's) are the wife, daughter, relatives, friends of Boris the famous Bolshoi Theater conductor.  They are retired artists and intellectuals who had mingled with the royal family before the revolution.  They regard the Soviet regime as a kind of occupation and must be careful about what they say in Kotov's presence. Clearly he would like to assume Boris' place as head of the family, but they regard him as declasse', a braggart, and a bully.  In the famous boat scene, the hero father has only platitudes to offer his daughter.  His view of national progress lies in technological advances.  He plays baby games with this exceptional little girl who longs for the kind of challenge that Mitya will offer her.

The second hero is Mitya, beloved of Boris and his family, who greet him as the prodigal son, coming alive to his laughter  and music. They see him as Boris' rightful heir, a kind of Hamlet-- home to clean house. Unlike his adopted family,  he has been unable to escape direct conflict with the Soviet regime.  As an White Army exile, he had made a deal with the devil, the infamous NKVD, in order to return home. But Kotov has sent him away again, for a total of almost 20 years abroad.  At the beginning of the film he gambles his life against taking his misery home.  When he finally agrees to go, his aim is to clean up his act (the washing of the steps in Red Square).  He is not an assassin-IT IS STALIN WHO ORDERED THE ARREST--but he will take revenge on the man who robbed him of his life.

Although the men engage in competitions (including a dance competition!) throughout the day, Nadya (literally) leads them out of the woods of such futility. Both men will lose.  Only Stalin is the winner! Neither man is a villain; both deserve compassion. Poor Kotov finally broke--I believe it was because of his acknowledgment of his own complicity in the truckdriver's murder--groaning his way to Moscow. But the dirge in the cellos was for Mitya, signalling the death of his soul. Supported by his family's love, he had almost achieved redemption, but the incident with the truck driver demanded the concentration of the NKVD man.  His series of errors in the car led inevitably to the truck driver's death. I hated him so much as he gathered his white coat about him and entered the car on the opposite side, that his suicide had little effect on me.  So why did I mourn him for weeks and weeks?",1146268800,14,2993,4.632575757575758
728548,5,630386905X,"Clearly one of the most visually stunning, intelligent, sophisticated films about life in Russia during the Stalinist years, BURNT BY THE SUN is an experience all lovers of fine filmmaking should see.  Directed and starring Nikita Mikhalkov who also co-wrote the screenplay with Rustam Ibragimbekov, this film allows us entry into the inside stories of Russia under Stalin.  It is an emotionally devastating tale.

On the grounds of his dacha in 1936 revolutionary hero Colonel Kotov (Nikita Mikhalkov) cavorts in his sauna with his young daughter Nadya (Nadezhda Mikhalkova) and his elegantly beautiful young wife Marusia (Ingeborga Dapkunaite). Outside on the lawn is the rest of Kotov's family in a peaceful, sun-drenched summer garden, drinking, singing, and blissfully enjoying life in the country. On the vast horizon is a group of men assembling a balloon to honor Stalin, and a group of army tanks treads onto the wheat fields threatening to destroy the crops.  The townsfolk workers run for Kotov to rescue the situation, underlining the fact the Kotov is their hero from the revolution, much loved and respected.  Abruptly onto the scene comes the handsome young cousin Dimitri/Mitya (Oleg Menshikov), an ex-lover of Kotov's wife. He ingratiates himself with Nadia and the rest of the family as a pianist and singer, but there is a note of evil lurking.  Kotov understands the threat that Mitya's arrival indicates, that he has been betrayed and has become one of the many to be purged by Stalin.  But the life in the dacha remains leisurely and elegant until the fateful end when Mitya's mission is fulfilled.  The film ends with phrases telling us about the destinies of Kotov and his family up to the end of the purge after Stalin's death.

The story is history: the telling is art.  Blest with a cast of extraordinary luminosity, Nikita Mikhalkov directs this tale of repression with style and leisurely pacing, such as allowing for moments at table when one of the grandmothers sings an aria from Puccini's 'Madama Butterfly', an aria whose text foreshadows the future of the story.  It is this contrast between the residual classy elegance of Russia before the revolution and the gritty reality of the cruelty of Stalinism that makes the film so resonant.  The cinematography by Vilen Kalyuta and the musical score by Eduard Artemyev  enhance the film immeasurably.  In Russian and French with English subtitles.  Highly Recommended.

Under the rays of a Stalinist sun, a story of tragic heroism becomes illuminated against the ""fertile"" landscape of communist Russia. The threads of a few seemingly disconnected lives weave together to provide a portrait of characters in various stages of maturity: the pitiful self-destructive bitterness of a talented young man, the guarded confusion of a young wife preoccupied with doubt, the grace under fire of an anti-hero learning to accept and savor life, and the innocent precocity of a little girl caught in the middle of it all. The stark brevity of the language, which is utilized masterfully by an excellent cast, lends a heartbreaking poetry to the backdrop of a ""common wealth"" among comrades. The director then brings this script to life with scenery choices and visual tricks that would make any baby filmmaker drool. All in all, this was one of the films that helped to form me as an artistic person, and I am certain that it will move anyone who draws breath.",1141516800,5,1175,4.816831683168317

728669,5,630386905X,"I am surprised that so few reviews acknowledge Mikhalkov's subtlety in this film and the masterful way in which he allows the plot to unfold. I strongly advise viewers not to go into this looking for the prefabricated ""good guy"" and ""bad guy."" There were so many layers to what was happening, and Mikhalkov never created such binaries. With a rudimentary knowledge of revolutionary history and/or a good intuition, the viewer will notice that there is an underlying tension in the Kotov home even before Mitya's arrival--between the old guard and their ""bourgeois"" values and the commander's ideals. [Not to read if you haven't seen the film: While undeniably kind and typically good-hearted, his response to Mitya is nothing if not passive-aggressive. He later takes his aggression out on his wife in what is, by Western standards, certainly rape, a little self-righteous manipulation, and above all, a statement of ownership. This demonstrates that Kotov is not as sure about the security offered him by Comrade Stalin as reviewers remarking on a ""sudden breakdown"" are offering. Not having much background on the story, I expected Kotov to become the prototypical Soviet bad guy (especially in the scene upstairs with his wife), if anyone. And Mitya is certainly not lacking in conscience; we see him  wavering up to and including the truck driver's final scene. They were all ""burnt"" in different ways. I could go on.]

What is most stunning is how the viewer is handed small clues that serve to build doubt over the course of the film and it is only toward the end that anything is clarified. None of these characters were held us as heroes, enemies, or even victims -- all of them played some part in building and sustaining the system they were living under, from the bourgeois woman in her mid-summer fur coat to the charming and wounded NKVD officer whose bitter indifference toward the fate of others eventually cuts him like a broken glass left behind.

I truly hope that, for nothing if not viewing pleasure, reviewers can cease to categorize this film as just another one of those cathartic, ""look how bad Stalin was"" movies. Masterful though such films may be (I myself find the seminal ""Repentance"" one of the most touching and beautiful movies of that period), this is a different animal -- a little more subtle, a little more human, and heart-wrenching in an utterly different way.

Sometimes I think about people who were borne 20 years before World War II in Germany, Poland or Russia. I wonder whether they had a feeling that the life was extremely unfair to them. The feeling that your fate was determined by the time you were borne in, and that you couldn't do anything at all to somehow change it. If Mitya, Kotov and Marusya would not die then, they would have to wait for 50 years to be able to truly understand what happened to them and who was to blame for it.

I was puzzled why Mitya picked up the phone and agreed to arrest Kotov. Why didn't he stop his suffering immediately, as he knew that he had no other option than ruining lives of the people he loved. Was it his hatred towards Kotov and the opportunity to take revenge for being expelled for 10 years? Was it the last hope that his love to Marusya would reverse her marriage?

After watched the film again I decided that he knew from the offset there was no way out. Mitya went to his old home because he wanted just one thing - to say farewell to his dream that the old times would ever return.

They either debate whether or not ""Burnt by the Sun"" deserved an Oscar or criticize the controversial figure of the film's director, Mikhalkov, his political stances, deficiencies, faults, etc.  A few if any reviews talk about the emotional power of this picture, which affected me tremendously.
""Burnt by the Sun"", or ""Drained by the Sun"" (a more accurate translation from Russian) has impressed me with its depth and subtle nuances in portraying people's inner psyche, their desires, fears, hopes and illusions.  It is a very humane and cruel movie at the same time.  It's hard if not impossible to choose sides, e.g. in the beginning I found myself sympathizing with Mitya, the antagonist, who was forced to leave his home, who lost the love of his life to Kotov but survived the horrors of wars, only to find out later for me that he is in fact just a merciless murderer and betrayer, burned out and empty as a carcass of the corpse, cynical enough to befriend and play with a six-year old daughter of his victim.
Starting with the opening scene, the movie grabbed my attention and never let go.  A young, handsome man returns home to his apartment close to the heart of Soviet Russia - the Kremlin, exhausted, apathetic, and drained emotionally and physically.  We presume that he is a big shot in a new Soviet government, for he has a big place all to himself and his French servant.  He turns on the radio, doesn't answer the phone calls, pulls out his gun, and takes out all but one bullet.  Classical Russian roulette.  What is it that makes a man cross that line?  Is it fear?  Is it necessity? Is it the last escape before the path from which you cannot steer? Is it the last noble thing that you can do?.... <ok, I'm giving out too much here already..>
The movie is ""heavy"" for an average viewer, and, yes, it is somewhat hard to keep track of all characters and developments in the beginning.  You'll have to go trough lots of innuendos, hints, and subtlety. But the ultimate shock in the end is worth the wait.

At first, I really did think there was a problem with my copy of the film...like a hole was being burned into it, a la the 8mm films of my youth.

- The movie is Mikhalkov's blatant try at an Oscar nomination.
- The dialogue is stilted and unreal.

The choice of content might actually have made a good film, in theory, but as it is, the only surefire way to improve Burnt By The Sun would have been not to make it. Upon dissection, every move Mikhalkov made here looks like nothing but a deliberate, calculated grab for the Academy Award. The emotional manipulativeness of the film is astoundingly shameless. First off, there are all the devices that are blatantly meant to draw nostalgic sighs and sentimental tears out of West-based emigres - the recurring Vertinsky waltz, the ornate dacha, the self-conscious quoting of Pushkin. Then there are the moves designed to win over the Western critics: for instance, that ridiculous, facile scene with the fireball moving through the house, which just _screams_ ""Look! Inscrutable brooding Russian symbolism, deep enough for an Academy Award!"" Then there's the cloyingly precious child; that always wins points with the audience. And of course, there's that disgustingly turgid ""symbol"" at the end - a balloon bearing a huge portrait of Stalin, rising out of nowhere and ""ominously looming over"" the setting. (Wait, Nikita? So you're saying that Stalin was ruthless? Good heavens, what a visionary! Oh, I never saw _that_ one coming!) It's as if Mikhalkov knew he had to remind the audience that the film actually had an Important Message, lest they had forgotten it in the preceding two hours. Crass beyond words.
Am I being too cynical here? Hardly. Certainly no more than Mikhalkov; he wouldn't have made something this artless by accident. After all, if you remove from consideration the deliberate and unsubtle political message of the film, there is absolutely nothing left. The actor playing Mitya does exude a certain menace, but his efforts are wasted in his surroundings. Despite being the sole reason for all Mitya's deviousness, whoever plays Marusya gets no screen time at all aside from the obligatory sex scene and one brief scene with Mitya, in which she doesn't say more than five lines. Mikhalkov's character likewise never does anything of any importance - his most interesting appearance is when he starts tap dancing to impress his daughter, and that's mainly due to the incredulous laughter it causes. And, in fact, aside from Mitya and Mikhalkov's daughter, and Mikhalkov himself in the final scene, the characters in this film only put in short, obligatory appearances, apparently to break up the monotony. Unfortunately, they fail to do so, and the film, whose story could safely have been told in half an hour without leaving anything out, drags on and on for over two hours. The fact that Mikhalkov really did get the Academy Award (through yet another dishonest device - it was deliberately kept from theatrical release, and was privately screened only for the favourably inclined judges) is just depressing.",1034553600,14,2905,5.079497907949791

Ah, the advantages of capitalism.  It's just too bad that the fall of communism in Russia had to bring along some less auspicious consequences.  Unlike their predecessors, films made in Russia after 1991 had to actually make money.  This resulted in an overall ""Westernification""--a slicker package at the expense of complex themes and poetic photography.  ""Burnt by the Sun"" is a perfect example of this.  You won't be struggling to comprehend all of the different levels of meaning in ""Burnt by the Sun"" the way you might in ""Andrei Rublev"".  Things are spelled out quite clearly here, and the plot is easy to follow and takes precedence (somewhat of a rarity in ""highbrow"" Soviet films--compare this one to ""The Color of Pomegranates"").  There's also very little of the wonderful symbolism you find in the earlier films--in ""Burnt by the Sun"", water is just water.  It is by no means a bad movie--in fact, quite good by Hollywood standards--but I can't help but wonder what might have become of it had it not been made under the commercial pressures of capitalism.

Having a knowledge of Russian culture was helpful; I found myself explaining, to other viewers, about some of the behaviors and even some of the props used in different scenes. I have been told that the video's theme is very sad, and that is true: if you consider what Russians have lived through (very nearly every generation has had some sort of purge or revolution) you can appreciate the strong emotional content and nature of the film; this is how life is for them.  Yet it is not lacking in humor, as well; they have learned to have happiness and appreciate life amidst the turbulent times. This video portrays very accurately the times and people.",972259200,2,883,4.873333333333333
728817,4,630386905X,"Wrenchingly emotional, this is one day in the life of a family that is on  the surface idyllic...so full of life and love...and is actually a  nightmare when the political reality of Stalin's rule intrudes into their  world. The entire cast is brilliant with Nikita Mikhalkov ( who also wrote  and directed ) as the war hero and patriarch, and Oleg Menshikov as the man  who sells his soul for survival standouts. Like the fireballs that waft  through rooms and over landscapes in this film, there is something magical  about it that becomes more evident with each viewing. The winner of many  awards, ( including an Oscar for Best Foreign Film ) it shouldn't be  missed, you'll see they were well deserved.",962755200,5,707,4.729508196721311
728818,1,630386905X,"The fild does not reflect history in all its dimensions. I would even say  it distorts the truth by presenting a very single-sided point of view. It  is definitly popular abroad, as people in the West tend not to know much  about Russia and the former Soviet Union. In Russia, however, very few find  the director historically honest.  The West is also very often scared by  the Russian mafia. Perhaps, it would be interesting for many to know that  the film's director is one of the Oligarchs' men, a servant of robber  barons, who pay him for service with money they steal from the people.",956880000,6,591,4.561904761904762
728819,5,630386905X,"This film breaches the boundaries of nationality, language, and history in order to display the spirit of the Russian people and the horrible times this people has been through. The plot is a beatiful tragedy. Alexei Kotov,  a hero of the Russian Revolution, is living out his last day with his  family, to be taken away and executed by Stalin's secret police at the end.  A truly devastating film, perfectly accurate historically, sophisticated  and well-wrought. There is no happy ending.",956275200,2,490,5.0875
728820,5,630386905X,"I loved this movie, but I think there has been some confusion on its political contexts. It seems to me that the point of this film has not been to indict the communitarian practices of communism, nor does it seem to  condemn the values of equality and proletariat populism promised by the  Lenninist revolutionaries. Instead it riles against the Naziesque  autocratic regime of Stalin.
Only the least educated of people could  think that this was a film that, in the spirit of Joseph McCarthy and many  elected officials of the city of Miami, highlights the evils of communist  ideology. Instead it is a film that warns against the damage that can be  done by people who persue personal success and power above all else, even  at the expense of those they love the best.
We all know these kinds of  people, that is what makes this film so great.",955065600,7,846,4.624161073825503
7855277,5,630386905X,This is a terrific Russian film. There is so much packed into it visually and culturally. The story is intriguing and keeps the viewer asking questions from start to finish.

7855280,5,630386905X,"The film Burnt by the Sun is a drama film which takes place in Stalinist Russia during in 1936, during the Great Purge of the 1930s. The cast  includes the director himself, Nikita Mikhalkov, as the main character Sergei Kotov, Oleg Menshikov as Mitya, Ingeborga Dapknait as Kotovs wife Maroussia, and Nadeya Mikhalkova as Kotovs daughter Nadya.
 The movies central focus is around Kotovs family as they relax on vacation, but throughout the movie the politics of Soviet Russia seem to intrude their relaxation. The plot of the movie carries on in a lackadaisical manner much like a family vacation. However, the calm timeline is often interrupted by political affairs. The movie opens with Kotovs family in the bath house, when they are interrupted by a neighbor who tells them that soviet soldiers were about to destroy the wheat with their tanks. Later in the film, the family sits down to their meal, you can hear the radio drone of current events of Soviet politics. During their time at the dacha, a man who has ties with Kotov and his wife appear at their doorstep. When the family goes to spend time at the lake, a soviet group interrupts their time with a gasmask test. And towards the end ta lighthearted game of football is delayed with the bickering of Kotov and Mitya. The plot shows a life of a soviet soldier constantly intruded upon by the political affairs of his country.
 One aspect of the film that stands out is the acting. When one watches this film, one will not feel as if they are being entertained by a screen, but rather being an observer of the characters lives. The reason for this is feeling is the acting. The characters are not portrayed in a larger than life manner, nor are they shallow or wooden. The actors succeeded in making their characters human and realistic. This attribute makes the characters more relatable and easier to sympathize with.
 The second aspect of this film which stands out is the music. The film uses a mix of scores and already existing music. A song which appears frequently is "" "" (or Weary Sun), which was a popular song during the soviet period. For a majority of the film the music is light hearted, with joyful scores and some characters playing giddy tunes on the piano . During times of conflict, the score will switch to more solemn tones. The music helps reflect the plot of the movie, the slow easy going timeline with hints of conflict and unease.
 As someone who enjoys history, especially Russian history, I enjoyed watching this film. Not only was the subject matter to my liking, but the presentation was appealing. To those who are debating about watching this movie, I recommend it. For those who decide to watch this film, be prepared for an emotional experience, an experience filled with both insight on life in Soviet Russia and the emotions of the people who lived in such a country.",1488844800,,2866,4.68986083499006
