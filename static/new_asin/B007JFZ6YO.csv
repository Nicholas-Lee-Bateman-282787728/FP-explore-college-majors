8518343,4,B007JFZ6YO,"I was just a little girl when this movie was played on national television, my Dad had seen reviews for it so he set the VCR to record. Several years has gone by and for Christmas a couple years ago I can across this movie and ordered it for my Dad. Now Dad has me ordering copies for his siblings who all grew up on a farm and knew the stress of what a farmer goes thru to get the crops in and out and the turmoil that goes along with it. A must see movie",1385251200,,456,3.7604166666666665
8518344,5,B007JFZ6YO,A must see movie. Farmers today still go through a lot with making a living. It'll never get easier. Glad this movie was made. It really makes you think how arguments start and should of been thought through first before acting out.  One day every farmer will need a helping hand of some kind.  The older machinery still does a good job and costs less to operate.,1359158400,,363,4.402985074626866
