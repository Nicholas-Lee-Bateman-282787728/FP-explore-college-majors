4983134,4,B006C1S1IO,"As a big fan of Tak Sakaguchi films in specific and Japanese films in general, I couldn't wait to get my hands on Yakuza Weapon. Actor, martial artist and stunt man, Tak Sakaguchi made his name not just in Japanese cinema but action and obscure film as a whole with roles in such films as the cult favorite Versus, Death Trance, Battlefield Baseball, Azumi 2, etc. Now in Yakuza Weapon, a release by Sushi Typhoon, Nikkatsu and Well Go USA, Tak Sakaguchi plays Shozo Iwaki, a tough-as-nails Yakuza with a mad dog approach to battling his enemies. He is actually son to boss of the Iwaki family - one of the most powerful crime families in Japan - and as such, he is out to make a name for himself and usher the family into the new age of Yakuza business. But before that, he goes overseas to fight in a militarized zone, though the exact location and reason are absent from the film so far as I can tell.

When he returns to his beloved Japan four years later, much has changed. His father has been assassinated by Yakuza underboss Kurawaki, who has the ambitious plans of taking over not just the Iwaki crime business but that of all the Yakuza families in Japan. When Shozo learns of Kurawaki's treachery, he seeks him out. Full of vengeance, Shozo wreaks havoc on Japan, blasting, blowing up, puching, kicking and insulting his way to his target. All the while, he is pursued by the beautiful, overly smitten Nayoko, the daughter of a Yakuza boss and new head of that family, whom Shozo promised to marry upon his return to Japan.

What follows is an orgy of violence, mechanic body alterations, unhealthy sexual obsessions, dildos, irreverent humor, more violence, betrayal, a battalion of drug-addled zombies, genital rocket launchers and nipple machine guns, and when all is said and done love and revenge.

Also, Yoshihiro Nishimura was involved in the prosthetics and other effects, and one can always be sure his involvement in any film will make it that much better.

Like so many other Japanese films of its kind - Machine Girl, RoboGeisha, Helldriver, Battlefield Baseball, Death Trance, Versus, Samurai Princess, Meatball Machine, Ichi the Killer, Hard Revenge Milly, etc. - I absolutely recommend this one.",1328918400,10,2220,4.7734375
8496294,3,B006C1S1IO,"Like it happenned in the most of show-killing movies, it's hard to figure out any logic or sense in bloodthirsty murdering and gore manifesting themselves for themselves. Copulating scenes also collapsed into relentless killings.
This produce is somehow innovative for introducing the bionic body parts - limbs self-transforming into bullet-endlessly-firing assault weaponry, and even a penice-to-a-nuke-bomb.
Well, a part somehow matching such appendage was equally demonstrated in action.",1520467200,,490,6.220588235294118

8496297,5,B006C1S1IO,"As with most B movies to come from Japan, this one IS NOT FOR CHILDREN.. it campy and extremely violent, loaded with nudity, gore, unbelievable acts of violence and perversion...this is an ABSOLUTE MUST for any fan of B-movies!",1360886400,,227,4.846153846153846
8496298,4,B006C1S1IO,"The DVD box describes this as ""hard edged"" action. Simply stated, this is Japanese grindhouse.

The plot is fairly simple. Shozo (Tak Sakaguchi), who is a great fighter, but not the sharpest tack in the box, returns to Japan to discover his crime boss father has been over-thrown. He opts to get his empire back. About midway through the film he is transformed into the man you see on the cover. The action is over the top, sometimes 3 Stooges style. In an early scene a man steps on a landmine and uses it to blow himself up so he can soar through the air and land in the enemy camp.

The story includes bad hair pieces, lines from American films, school girl uniforms, pink ooze squirting from a cell phone, a nurse with Freddy's claw, and a man who dodges bullets. This is for extreme grindhouse fans who enjoy immature bloody movies. If you didn't enjoy the American ""Planet Terror"" or ""Smokin' Aces"" films, you should pass on this one. The comedy is called ""manga style."" It is similar to what we call ""mid-brow"" humor...like listening to Lou Reed, but without any political commentary. I might have to watch a few more of these films before I can decide if I really like them or not. English subtitles are used in the film and in the extra features.

Parental Guide: F-bombs, sex, and weird nudity. Excessive blood, killing, and violence.",1348963200,2,1344,4.568464730290456
8496299,4,B006C1S1IO,"I haven't yet purchased this movie but I seen it on netflix and I gotta have it. Yes it is ultra cheesy at times, and some of the stuff is wayyyy over the top even for me. But these are the reasons it simply is a must have. When I saw the like 5 minute fight scene in the locker room I knew it must be part of the family. Plus its my boy from versus and that was a good one.",1347062400,,374,3.573170731707317
8496300,1,B006C1S1IO,"First of all, I really like Asian cinema...over the past 5 years they have produced unbelievably good movies (Crouching Tiger, House of Flying Daggers, IP Man, Curse of the Golden Flower among many others).  This one, however, is embarassing to watch.  Maybe it's the genre (outlandish comic book type humor/action that reminds me of a combination of the mob and the three stooges), but it just didn't pass the smell test after the first 10 minutes.  I usually can find something redeamable in most movies, but no luck on this one.  This baby will be passed around next Christmas to some unsuspecting ""friend.""  For those who like this kind of stuff, go for it.  For the vast majority I would wager they will find it a waste of time.  Machine girl is much better.",1336435200,2,763,4.649253731343284
8496301,4,B006C1S1IO,"UPDATE*
I can understand the negative reviews for this movie as well as towards my review.
The movie lacks REWATCHABILITY and is pretty much no fun after the first viewing.
In fact the only scene I like re-watching are the ones with the naked dead girl...lol
particularly when she is used as nunchukus and her transformations. oh well...

I can see people are not really getting this movie.
There is little to get so it's a bit perplexing.

This is based on a Manga/comic of the same name.
The Manga was completely ridiculous and over the top, the movie follows suit.
It is about a guy so BADA$$ that he can basically walk through a hail storm of bullets shrugging off explosions while making snarky comments.

What is so hard to grasp about that?
Tak is as entertaining to watch as always and the rest of the cast and scenarios as ridiculous as the Japanese are know for.

My only gripe is the use of CGI, I wish they would just stick to Nishimura style gore effects and cherry juice.
BUT a splatterfest movie it is NOT, so...

With some of the crap being pumped out by Hollywood and Europe just with more money dumped in to them. I don't wanna hear any whining about ""lack of realism""...",1334448000,,1189,4.435779816513762

8496303,1,B006C1S1IO,"This is really a bad film or it's a bad parody. Either case, still a really bad film.
Plot: Something to do with Japanese Yakuza gangs. No story; disjointed script and I lost nothing while saving a lot of time by fast forwarding.
Actors were just cut out characters about as dimensional as poster boards.
Entire movie script was just fight scenes followed by some posing followed by fight scenes and so on. You would expect in a Yakuza movie that the fight scenes would be well acted and scripted. Wrong! We open (and it continues throughout the movie) with kick scenes consisting of a single leg swing (my grandma could do it) and the bad guys start falling well before the kick arrives. Not kidding. Even editing couldn't rescue their falling when the kick is still two feet away. Then there are the machine gun scenes where the bad guys (ranging up to six at one time) standing fifteen feet away and emptying their magazines totally miss our main protagonist. Even the grenades do nothing but toss him into the air. All the machine gun fire, grenade explosions were post production edited with obviously fake CGI fire with a two dimensional look that coincidentally matched the acting.",1329955200,3,1188,4.716346153846154
