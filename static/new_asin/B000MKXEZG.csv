2736430,4,B000MKXEZG,"A mild mannered, exuding the aura of innocence and sweetness, was merely a pretense hiding a blood thirsty maniac who took delight in torture, murder and cannibalism. Goes to show you you can never trust a book by its cover!

My only gripe against this movie was the appearance of Joe Coleman, artist, in the middle of the movie, and he takes entirely TOO MUCH of the movie. He was given the ORIGINAL letter of this maniac, and the secretary kept the photocopy (hopefully that secrtary was fired--what an airhead!) that confessed the killing and eating of a little girl.  I didn't feel he added much insight and was entirely his own opinion. More should have been given to facts about Fish's life.

I thought, too, there were too many artistic renditions of Fish seeing Christ.  More attention toward what happened during Fish's life and the courtroom.

Despite the shortcomings of the movie, it held my attention and was very informative. ALthough John Coleman did make me yawn a few times and was totally annoying. (I can see maybe a few minutes just because he owned that original letter); it would have been better to edit him out.
So I'm giving it 4 stars.",1184976000,6,1161,4.671568627450981
2736431,5,B000MKXEZG,"I first saw this at a website and thought id give it a try. I wasn't sure if it was a 'horror' film and had an actor and showed what he did, or if it was a documentary. The best way to describe this is that it would be an uncut documentary from TLC or court tv, maybe even from Unsolved Mysteries Its a bunch of photos of him and his victims, along with some footage from that time period, along with a guy that runs a museum of weird collectable(fishs confession) and a psychologist. Obviously a lot of this stuff is disturbing, but its not really a gory movie. The bloodiest is when he whips a boy and himself. Theres even scenes of meat in an oven and being cut, but its no different then normal things.

I would definetely recommend this if your interested in him",1175731200,24,767,4.1824324324324325
2736432,5,B000MKXEZG,"Back in 2004 while doing a radio interview with director John Borowski, I first heard of his desire to make an Albert Fish movie. Now, 3 years later, I get to see it. Finally. I've been waiting for a while to see this flick. Was it worth the wait? Read on...

For starters, this movie has the same narrator as John's HH Holmes film, Tony Jay. He's got a really good deep creepy voice (sadly, he passed away shortly after narrating this film). The sound is great, the camera work is great, and all in all, it's a really good documentary.

So..on to the movie.

 The flick starts out with the Grace Budd kidnapping and murder. I don't know where the movie was shot, but it looks like it was filmed in the 30's. The show goes pretty in depth about the Budd murder, even as far as showing the actual letter that Fish sent to the Budd family, that is considered to be the sickest letter ever written. The letter itself is now in artist Joe Coleman's ""Odditorium"" collection. The story of how he came to get it is pretty cool. I wish I could have the same luck as he did.

After the Budd murders and Fish's arrest the show goes on to tell about Fish's childhood & life up until the murders. It also goes pretty in depth on the letters he would send to random women from the want ad's, giving a good insight into the sick mind that he had.

The one thing that I really didn't like about the movie was the voice used for Fish. The actor that plays him does a fine job, but the voice over actor for his voice just didn't seem to fit. The voice used seems like a younger guy. I always pictured fish to have a creepy Vincent Price-ish voice. But all in all, it doesn't distract from the quality of the film.

The DVD also has some great bonus features. Including interviews with the band Macabre's lead singer, French cannibal and grave robber Nicolas Claux, and a behind the scenes interview with the film-maker John Borowski. Also included are trailers for the film, a breakdown of Joe Coleman's Albert Fish painting, a complete reading of the Budd & Gaffney letters, a still gallery, outtakes and cut scenes, and a live performance of Albert Was Worse Than Any Fish In The Sea by Macabre. The first 1000 DVD's sold include a signed (by the filmmaker) and numbered X-Ray of Albert Fish showing all the needles he inserted into his groin.

This is the first time I've seen a documentary on Albert Fish anywhere, and it does him justice. As innocent and frail as Fish looked in many of the photos you see of him, John's film shows him to be an extremely creepy man. Kinda like that weird guy you see walking through town, the guy that makes you want to walk on the other side of the street...

On a scale of one to ten, I'd give this show a 9. Had the voice-over been different, it would very well be a 10.

For the bonus features, they get a 9 as well. I was kinda let down during the interview with Nico. I've heard other interviews with him and he speaks English very well, but in the interview he talks in French and it's subtitled in English. Either way, the bonus features are just as good as the movie.",1174867200,13,3098,4.289383561643835
2736433,5,B000MKXEZG,"Without relying on sensationalism or voyeuristic gore, John Borowski's film ALBERT FISH delves into the confronting nightmarish life of Albert Fish and provides an incredibly accurate and compelling account of the serial killer's life.

While serial killer films may have become the norm of late, one film-maker continues to stand out from the crowd. With a perfectionist eye for detail, Borowski proves once again that he is second to none when researching and producing films about real-life serial killers. With a carefully selected cast to bring the horrific case to life, ALBERT FISH leaves the viewer reeling at the possibility of such a monster residing in such an innocuous facade.

2736506,3,B000MKXEZG,"Overall, this documentary does have a lot of good information about Albert Fish. The problem is the way in which the material is presented. I personally did not mind the narrator, whom I enjoy as a voice actor in other films, but the voice acting of the individuals depicted are truly horrendous. The reenactments are cheesy and poorly done, and the voice actors used (especially the voice of Fish himself) are difficult to listen to. They are very unnatural in their presentation. There are times that they attempt to reenact horrific moments, and it is enough to make the viewer uncomfortable- not because of the horrific content, but because of the delivery and the fact that (in lack of better terms) you feel embarrassed just listening to them. Another unflattering piece of this documentary are the awkward Joe Coleman segments. He is featured, presumably because of the shady way in which he happened to acquire Albert Fish's written confession via an accident and his conscious decision not to mention or bring light to said accident. He is brought into the documentary many times, and frankly, it would have been better without him. His unsavory character is revealed first in how he acquired the letter which is of no consequence to the actually telling of Fish's story, and is only perpetuated as he discusses his thoughts on Fish, which come across as admiration and praise for the cannibalistic serial killer. It would have been much more tasteful without his commentary. Not to mention, as the documentary progresses, Coleman regresses in his vocabulary and speech, to where he uses the F word repetitively to ineffectively describe and convey ideas about Fish and the situations involving him. It would have been significantly more enjoyable with him having never been featured. On the other hand, the interview segments with Katherine Ramsland (Ph. D) were interesting, insightful, and I feel were presented much more appropriately; and were significantly more useful in conveying ideas about the serial killer. The theories featured as to why Fish did the things that he did, and his relationship with Jesus and religion, the reasons he cannibalized his victims, and what he might have felt his role was in respect to the roles of others in the Bible were interesting. Unfortunately, they seemed like an afterthought, as they were not presented as clearly as they frankly could have been, and were really only supplemented with Katherine Ramsland's interviews. I feel the theories and the whole ""point"" can be easily missed due to this inability to coherently present them to the viewer, and bits with Coleman haphazardly thrown in the mix, which falls on creator John Borowski. It -feels- like Borowski just wanted to make a documentary, and put his ""buddy"" Coleman in, and since he didn't know how to do that but already promised his buddy he could be in it, he just let Coleman say whatever he wanted regardless of the impressions or outcome, had fun with that, then realized that he had a serious documentary to ""hand in"" for his next class, and threw in a couple theories near the end to be done with it. I have complained a great deal of the Coleman pieces, in part because they detract that much from what would have been a much better documentary, and was just nearly impossible to get past. I really wish there were more documentaries about Albert Fish, because unfortunately, this is one of the few in depth looks we have of him, and what could have been a great documentary is just kind of mediocre. I do not want to recommend this, however it is one of the few pieces on Fish to choose from. I feel bad for the narrator (the late Tony Jay), and for Katherine Ramsland, as I feel they were the best parts of this documentary, barring the black and white facts of ""he did this, he did that"". Borowski makes the serious subject feel nearly laughable, which is a completely inappropriate way of presenting this kind of topic.",1480982400,2,3950,4.836041358936485

Bad enough he misrepresented the symbolism but includes the odd guy seemingly trying to link Catholicism with fish's protestant understanding of Christianity.

Then the rest of the documentary jumps around to different parts of his life, punctuated by excessively long photo montages of New York that seem only to eat up screen time.  Beyond that, the documentary was very anti-Catholic, even though Fish wasn't Catholic.  Even Protestants will find its focus on Christianity as the root of Fish's psychosis excessive and unwarranted (based on the modern understanding of a sociopath).  Their ""expert"" that kept appearing was a truly scary individual whose only claim to fame is his disturbing artwork, his private museum of freaks, oddities and perverse criminals as heroes.  His only connection with Fish is the fact that he managed (by a fluke) to get his hands on the original letter Fish wrote describing his actions.  That in itself is a bad thing-- this guy appears to believe that the letter is alive and is speaking to us and has some message for us that in some way justifies or vindicates Fish.

I wouldn't go to a dog walker to find information on medical issues, so why are we hearing the artist/collectors unfounded opinions on abnormal psychology? There is literally no way you could prove, or disprove, anything he says on the film! I'm guessing he traded showing the Fish letter on film for getting his asinine ideas on film.

2736610,1,B000MKXEZG,"Will no one stop this man?!  And by this man, I don't mean Albert Fish; I mean the director, John Borowski.  For some unknown reason, Borowski attempts to sensationalize a story that is sensational in its own right.  As if Fish's own crimes of kidnapping, torture, murder, and cannibalism were not enough, Borowski feels the need to ""heighten"" the drama using cheesy re-enactments, overwrought and repetitive imagery, new footage doctored to appear old, and truly laughable voice overs, the most grating of which are those of the attempted re-creation of an old-time radio announcer's voice.

And then there is the artist Joe Coleman.  In an interview which Borowski over-uses, Coleman smugly tells the story of how he, due a clerk's inattention, came into possession of the original letter in which Fish confesses to murder.  Coleman's justification for taking advantage of this accident and essentially stealing this document?  Well, obviously, Fish intended for him to have it all along.

Instead of spending your money on this film, I suggest making a donation to the Center for Missing and Exploited Children and to your local film school--- that is, of course, if you can find your wallet.

In that day and age everyone was so trusting of one another and because of that blind trust so many children lost their lives. I mean today if a complete stranger said they wanted to take your kid to a party, you would say I don't think so. Times were so different then. My grandfather was born in 1900 and I remember him telling us stories, before he died in 1985, that when he was 8 he would hop on the train and disappear for days and my great grandparents wouldn't even think twice about it. If my daughter doesn't answer my call or texts right away I start to panic.
  Anyway back to the movie, I have read several different books and articles about Albert Fish and this by far is the worst, not because of what he did, but because of how the director put this together. It was extremely boring and the reenactments were juvenile. I cannot even tell you how many times I rolled my eyes during this.

Using film footage from future decades was sloppy and rotating the same handful of pictures was boring. No, it wasn't the frankness of the crime, or the gore that was painted (literally), it was the amaturish editing, melodramatic narrative, and slow pace that made me eject this  of the way through.

I found this video a little boring and it tended to ramble on and on about how it was connected to
the bible. I am very tough skinned but this movie is probably not for about 99% of the public.",1299888000,2,381,4.026315789473684
2736623,1,B000MKXEZG,I don't know why this video got all these amazing reviews. I was so disappointed. The story itself is very interesting (and disturbing) but it could have been told in probably thirty minutes. They kept repeating stuff over and over and it was like they were trying to use filler to make it longer. It got to the point where i just wanted it to be over cause it was dragging on. Go to wikipedia and and read his bio and save yourself a bunch of time.,1290297600,6,449,4.172413793103448
2736624,5,B000MKXEZG,I fear I will not be able to get this movie out of my mind for a long time after watching it.  It is very dark and educational.  It travels deep inside the mind of Albert Fish and gives you strong detail to his life.  The narration of the film is fantastic and gives the movie a chilly presentation.  I highly recommend this movie for the ones who find the serial killer and their lives facinating.  5 stars in my book! very well put together!  It is not a horror film it is a dark documentary about Alber Fish.  Totally worth watching!,1275350400,4,536,4.196078431372549
2736625,3,B000MKXEZG,The blood and gore used to dramatize the movie was overkill....other than that it was good.,1270512000,,91,4.75
2736626,1,B000MKXEZG,"The creators of this documentary make a pretense of being horrified at this man's behavior, and then proceed to wallow in it for 90 minutes. Honestly, some of the ""dramatic recreations"" (eg Albert Fish kneels in front of Jesus Christ and starts biting off chunks of his flesh) would be laughable if they weren't flat out disgraceful.

There's a fine line with these kinds of documentaries between offering genuine insight into the human condition, and showing off a prurient fascination with tedious, sordid details. This doc is wedged hopelessly in the latter camp. It's over-long, lacking genuine insight, and is too much in love with the subject matter. Did we really need to see and hear a prolonged recitation of the way he liked to cook and eat little boys? Save your money, and don't give it to them.",1259884800,8,807,4.805755395683454
2736627,4,B000MKXEZG,"Documentary about a real-life 'sado-cannibal' who enjoyed the taste of human flesh and the sensation of being tortured. The music and narration set the right mood for this ghastly story sure to shock and horrify even those with the strongest nerves. There are plenty of scenes of old New York which I liked.

There are also plenty of pictures of Fish as well as some recreated scenes. I find that artist who runs the horror museum to be a pretty interesting character. He seems to have a deep fascination with Fish's inner workings. He's very proud to have Fish's authentic letter framed. A very disturbing film, watch if you dare.",1255392000,8,631,4.736363636363636
2736628,4,B000MKXEZG,"This was not a movie that you will be able to shrug off after you have seen it. You will think about it. It was detailed, heavy, frightening, interesting, hard to comprehend, gives you some explanation of his way of thinking, religion, perverse, Narration man's voice is good and creepy at same time. Every true horro person should see this. Not for everyone. Made me sick and very disturbed-some of his discriptions when cooking children. Glad he is dead. How many others are there? They are so good at fitting in with the rest of us.  SCARY.",1246665600,12,543,4.597938144329897

2736630,5,B000MKXEZG,"As a Private Detective and Cult Investigator I found this specific film extremely educational and entertaining. There are still in our society multiple serial killers that have not been identified or arrested. This film proves again about the continued lack of law enforcement intervention as with the 1960's Zodiac murders, and others at large in our century! This film is well documented, accurate and set forth with great reviews! The H.H Holmes Film should also be watched in order to psychologically analyze the sadistic nature of these Machiavelical characters who practice Canibalism as Jefrey Dammer did!

2736632,1,B000MKXEZG,"I found the free information about this child-killer over the internet as informative as this incredibly boring, sprawling, repetitive, unprofessionally produced, shoe-string budgeted video. The only two people interviewed in this taped attempt at documentary are a woman who drones on in psycho-bable that carries nothing but the obvious observations we can make ourselves, and the carnival ramblings of a freak show/oddities collector. This guy is about as scary as the subject matter. Viewing this video left me with a bad taste in my mouth, and I'm no cannibal. Save your money.",1205798400,10,582,5.336956521739131
2736633,4,B000MKXEZG,"We got this from Netflix not really sure what to expect.  Not a bad documentary.  The narration was great and the imagery and acting were amazing.  It would have flowed a little better if the timeline had gone in chronological order; none-the-less, one could easily follow what was going on.  Some of the really graphic scenes were also a little drawn out. The gentleman interviewed that owns the 'Odditorium' needs his own show.  Once you watch, you'll know what I mean. He's crazy and eccentric and almost seems to worship Fish for the religious murders that took place.  Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who is into True Crime or murder cases.  I wouldn't, however, let my kid watch it.  Many scenes and descriptions are extremely graphic and were a little difficult for an adult to get through.",1196899200,8,807,4.755395683453237

Don't get me started on Joe Coleman, seriously, ""he felt like or thought, and like I have too, that he was Jesus Christ"". The guy thinks Fish's story is beautiful, in his own words. ""Jesus Christ"" is right, the dude probably gets off on that Albert Fish letter.
