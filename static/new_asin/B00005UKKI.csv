1665402,4,B00005UKKI,Good video to sit down and talk to kids in their early development process. It also gives parents the opportunity to communicate to them on what they have seen. Expect giggles and laughter but overall a very educational tape to help the children understand sexual relationships and where babies come from,1226361600,,304,4.980392156862745
1665403,5,B00005UKKI,"My mother showed us this movie when we were little kids (over 20 years ago).  Things I remember: the sperm dancing with the egg, and um, that's about it.  I had seen people breastfeed in real life, so none of that was odd to me.  I remember that my mom's friends would come over with their kids to have them watch the movie too.  It was just so straightforward and not at all ""dirty"" or ""sexy"" to our little minds.  It was funny, weird, and a cartoon.  I think this is a great way to introduce sex and the different body parts to children.  Of course, the parent(s) should be there to answer ANY questions that may arise and to talk about the movie after.  At the time, we learned that babies were made when mom & dad were in love.  Then the sperm met the egg and the baby was created.  Children do not see this as ""people humping"".  The film is tasteful, lighthearted and straightforward.",1216684800,2,889,4.263473053892215
1665404,4,B00005UKKI,"I got the movie and book as a ""pack"" after our 5 year old asked about sex and babies.  Yes SEX and babies....horrifying thought isn't it.

I enjoyed how it explained what really happens to make a baby.  How it takes a man and a woman, sperm and eggs etc. And I liked how they used ""LOVE"" in a lot of it.  It was all about the man and the woman loving each other.  :)

What I could have done with out was the detail about sex.

To me they just went a little to far...I would have left it at the man and woman are naked and very close to each other...end of story.

The movie however goes into detail about the man putting his penis into the woman's vagina and wiggling around.  Then explains how it has the same feeling as being tickled.  Its one thing to know that ""sex"" is the reason babies are made, but not a manual for how it's done.

So overall I give this 4 stars, but I would have cut out the one part.  Luckily in the book you can skip over it (until they learn to read anyway)",1214179200,3,985,3.9441624365482233
1665405,5,B00005UKKI,"This film has become a tradition to use with our teenagers during our ""Faith & Sex"" weekends.  It's an easy way to open up difficult topics!",1210464000,,140,4.384615384615385
1665406,5,B00005UKKI,"The seller was super great, this was a used CD, but it worked great and came super fast, thank you.
The CD is self was graphic at times, but sticked to subject matter as expected and helped out a lot as our daughter definitely needed more than just the book.
THANK YOU",1208908800,,268,4.173076923076923
1665407,2,B00005UKKI,"I went to the library to get some sex ed books for my nine year old son. I had the book ""Where did I come from as a child"" and was looking for that for my son, it was checked out but I found this movie and thought it would just be pictures from the book being read on tape so I just played it for him. I was so horrified I could not even get up to turn it off. They zoomed in on the womens breasts, showed a cartoon baby suckling from them and the sex seen with the tickling sensation talk went on for ever monopolizing the video much more then the book. I don't even remember that part as a child in the book. Now I am going to half to back peddle or I will have him experimenting on his sisters for that fun tickly feeling. Terrible.",1124582400,6,735,3.8421052631578947
1665408,5,B00005UKKI,This is a very informative video for children on an easy level to understand.,976233600,2,77,4.571428571428571
1665409,3,B00005UKKI,"I bought this b/c this is what I watched as a child to find out about sex.  As I watched it with my 10 yr old, I was uncomfortable a bit...but this is uncomfortable for parents anyway.  The only part I could have done without was them saying how good it feels to have sex.  I just wanted the basics...how you do it, why you do it, when you do it, etc.  I didn't want her to know that sex feels really good yet!!!!  So, just be careful and I would watch it before you pop it in for you child to see if it's suitable for your family.",1335398400,,531,3.834862385321101
1665410,5,B00005UKKI,"My parents bought this when it first came out around 1985.  I would have been 5 when I viewed it.  I'm thought it was so honest that I'm trying to find it on DVD now (we don't have a VHS player anymore) and not having much success.  I have young children of my own and would like them to be educated on sex before it becomes embarrassing.  The sooner they know, the less embarrassing it will be--or at least that was my experience as a child!",1324166400,,442,4.104651162790698
1665411,5,B00005UKKI,"I learned what sex was by watching our cows have sex, gross! I was completely misinformed. I learned the rest in middle school.  I didn't want to make that mistake with my kids. I rented this for my 10 year old daughter to help explain sex.  She had been asking to know how babies were made.  It's a great way to completely explain the process to a 10 year old.  For the narrowminded reviewers, Your kids are going to hear all kinds of things about sex from school.  I want to be there when they watch the video and begin to understand.  When it's over, sit with your child and discuss your family's particular religious beliefs and answer any questions they have.  Best video I've seen.  Still works 30 years later.

For the reviewers that complained that they showed it to their kids before they watched it themselves, shame on YOU!",1313625600,,834,4.470198675496689

1665413,5,B00005UKKI,This video is well done. I showed it to my children when they were young and asking question. It helped develop the much needed communication on the subject of sex and babies. The complaints of other reviews on this video I believe are very narrow minded.,1288483200,,255,4.565217391304348
1665414,5,B00005UKKI,"This is a great companion video to the book. Here's a way to open up the topic of sex for discussion with younger children.

The nine-year-old granddaughter (this was not news to her) calls the video ""totally inappropriate"" as she plays it for the umpteenth time this week. ""It's all about penises and vaginas"" she says. The six-year-old sister is a bit more surprised about the details. But the positive and cheerful tone of the video make it seem more matter-of-fact than profound.

Wow, I wish that I could have found these great analogies and explanations when my kids were young. It makes it seem so easy to talk about sex with kids. A really great place to start the discussion.",1287878400,4,684,4.644628099173554
1665415,1,B00005UKKI,"I rented this movie from the library and really wish I would have previewed it first.  It was a little too graphic for my three boys ages 11, 9, and 7.  My boys were covering up their eyes and telling me to turn it off.  I expected it to be on the lines of the ""Once Upon a Potty"" cartoon that they watched years ago when learning to potty train.  This was more like ""Adult Swim"" on Cartoon Network.  When the mother's breast was shown, it looked like she had a breast enhancement and then they zoomed in on them.  Then, the bedroom scene was inappropriate for children.  Even the dialog was too much.  Instead of this movie, I would recommend the ""God's Design for Sex"" book series.  It's very informative, purposeful and in good taste.  This movie is not appropriate for a child of any age to watch.  To quote my oldest son, ""I'd rather you tell me about [sex] than to see that movie.""",1283212800,,887,4.283132530120482
1665416,2,B00005UKKI,"My parents showed this to me when I was 7 and they were expecting my younger brother. I'm now 30 and 23 years later, I still have the vivid memories of a bed bouncing up and down and swimming sperm with top hats racing to meet an egg dressed up as a bride. If you don't mind your kids having such images left permanently in their minds and leaving them only more confused about the birds and the bees process, then by all means, show them the film!",1272672000,4,448,4.1022727272727275

1665418,5,B00005UKKI,"I had this movie on VHS years ago for my kids to learn where babies come from and it is the most perfect educational tool ever! I bought it for my daughter to show our grandkids. Both our girls remembered the movie and were glad we got a copy for them to share with their kids. I recommend it for all kids, from very young to older kids. It's a bit juvenile for teens, but it still teaches them what they need to know.",1232496000,2,418,3.988095238095238

However, given the pic, I was expecting both videos, not just the one.
I would not have gotten this, as there were cheaper copies available if I'd realized that ahead of time.  My fault for not confirming that beforehand though.",1384473600,,274,4.829787234042553
