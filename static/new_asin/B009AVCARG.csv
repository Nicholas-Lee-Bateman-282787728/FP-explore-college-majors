5310976,5,B009AVCARG,My boys love Bob the Builder and this DVD couldn't have come at a better time for them.  My boys are only 17 months apart and they fight like cats and dogs.  This DVD features Bob and his friends working together to solve the problem and save the day!  It was great for me to points point to my boys how friends help one another and brothers should too!  There are five episodes on this DVD perfect for watching one episode at a time or having an hour long Bob marathon!,1359590400,,470,4.131868131868132
5310977,5,B009AVCARG,"By the title alone I knew that I would love this DVD!  My kids already love Bob the Builder and I love that it is such a uplifting show with great messages for my kids.  Hit Entertainment's shows are definitely of a higher caliber than others with regard to integrity and emphasis on the positive.

Bob and his friends are encouraging and supportive of each other when things don't always go as planned.  Not everyone is equally good at things and as adults we know that's what makes us unique individuals.  As kids, it can really hurt their feelings of self worth and confidence.  Dizzy has some issues in their department and it really created some thought provoking questions from my son and gave me the opportunity to discuss this subject with him.

I think that the moral lessons might still be over my three year olds head a bit but I like filling her head with things that are positive, even if she doesn't quite know what they mean yet.  So much of toddler's behavior is learned so I like having a positive role model, even if it's on TV!  She is really drawn to the characters and colors, which are always bright and invigorating to help stimulate little brains!

This DVD has cute bonus features with three music videos!  My daughter LOVES these because she's all about the music and singing and dancing along!  This will be great for any boy or girl on your Christmas list!",1355788800,,1384,4.514056224899599
