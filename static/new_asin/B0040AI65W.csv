8607337,5,B0040AI65W,My two boys (6 & 2) love these videos as well a my nephews! They are learning so much with the great characters and catchy tunes that teach about the books and stories of the Bible.,1351987200,,181,4.055555555555555
8607338,5,B0040AI65W,"I bought the first DVD in this series after hearing an interview about it with the creator, Phil Vischer (also creator of ""Veggie Tales"").  When I popped in the DVD and started watching it, I thought it was going to be a little advanced for my just-turned 2-year-old, BUT - to my amazement - he became glued to the screen.  After that, he started asking to ""watch the Bible"", which brought joy to our hearts.  We now own all 5 DVDs in the series, and he loves watching all of them.",1311379200,,481,4.263736263736264
8607339,5,B0040AI65W,"Our family was recently exposed to the fairly new DVD series for children called What's in the Bible.  Keeping in mind that we are jumping in here with DVD #5, from what I've seen of this DVD What's in the Bible is a zany, but comprehensive overview of the Bible for children.  The fifth DVD in the series - Israel Gets a King! gives children an overview of I Samuel, II Samuel, and part of I Kings - the life of King Saul, King David, and King Solomon.

Created by Phil Vischer (one of the creators of the ever-popular Veggie Tales) the series exudes the same wildsense of humor that Vischer brings to his projects.  We even get to see Phil in the flesh as he handles parts of the speaking in the series.  Basically, the cast is a crew of puppets (no veggies - all humanoid), Phil, and a few other voices and people.  They have come together to form a television show (think The Muppets - there is even a pair of elderly ladies who watch the show on their TV.) that educates children about the Bible.  There is quite an assortment of puppets, personalities, voices etc. that make my children laugh out loud and keeps them entertained while they learn.  The puppets and Phil switch off speaking parts very often to keep children engaged.

The DVD is divided into two parts - each complete with theme song and ending segments, so you can watch the parts independently (around 30 minutes each), or in a single sitting.  There is also standard chapter navigation built in.  Part one revolves around Saul and David up until the point when Saul dies.  Part two covers David's reign and Solomon's life.

This is a great, grammar-stage overview of the main people, places, and events of the books covered.  This would be an excellent way to get a big-picture view of certain parts of the Bible before reading those books together as a family.  Unlike Veggie Tales episodes that fictionalize and simplify biblical events for young children, What's in the Bible is very up-front about even the aspects of these men's lives that are typically omitted from children's Bible stories.  I love that.  I can't tell you how much.

Not only does this DVD not shy away from David's adultery and Solomon's 700 wives but it interprets these events correctly through God's word, displays the consequences of disobedience, and shows God's mercy when repentance is present.  It is beautifully done and challenges children to decide which king THEY want to be like in their response to their inevitable sins and shortcomings.  Brilliant.  The series is also careful to weave God's plan of salvation throughout the entire Bible, even back in I Samuel.

There is also a ""Big Idea"" segment where important theological truths are shared.  In episode #5 the trinity is tackled.  That's a big idea for sure!  It is very well done and my husband has referenced it a few times already when speaking of God with our children (he really digs this DVD too).

There are fun songs, colorful puppets, popsicle stick theater segments, flannelgraphs - all very upbeat and attention grabbing.  I asked my children what they thought, ""Hilarious!""  They are 8, 5, and 2 - they will all sit through the entire DVD AND bonus features (bloopers, deleted scenes, and a popsicle stick theater skit about a melon monkey - think the boy who cried wolf).  We have watched this DVD together as a family twice and my children are always glued to the screen.  Better yet, they are retaining what they learn and sharing it with us at meal times.",1304640000,3,3490,4.655228758169935
