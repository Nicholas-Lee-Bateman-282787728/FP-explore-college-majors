8552458,4,B00AJ7ACB6,"This film presents an important new angle on the land mine issue. I had not really considered the cost of landmines to non-humans.

Perhaps what makes this film so moving is the seesaw for the viewer between the worst and best of humanity. Worst: that we created landmines and continue to use them despite the horror they cause. Best: that we care enough about our fellow creatures to do so much to help them.

I was somewhat disappointed that the US was not called out for its obstructiveness on this issue (as with most other international laws, e.g. the chemical weapons ban).

All in all though a good film that I feel richer for having watched.",1381795200,,649,4.577586206896552
8552459,5,B00AJ7ACB6,"I know Soraida and the work she does at the ""FAE"" in Thailand. She is a true hero and I do not say that lightly..or often.
There are soooo many out there ""claiming"" to help elephants but do more harm than good.
So many people have no idea what is going on with the plight of the Asian elephants.
As a former performer with Ringling Brothers Circus (of horrors) I can tell you that the elephants live's here in this Country as well as in their homelands is an ugly and heartbreaking situation.
i have devoted my life to helping them...33 years as of Jan. 2014 to be exact.
Zoos, circuses, the argraian crisis taking place in their homelands, war, illegal logging camps, tourism, Temples...endless list of atrocities that continue to make life HELL for these amazing souls.
Please consider getting involved with helping these gentle giants.
If not..at least do no more harm.
Thank you.",1380672000,4,883,4.666666666666667
8552460,5,B00AJ7ACB6,"The 10-time award-winning documentary, ""The Eyes of Thailand"", is one of the most moving films I've seen. It brilliantly weaves together the story of the world's largest landmine victims with the struggles facing Asian elephants and the on-going threat of landmines around the world.  If this film doesn't make you an elephant lover, you have a heart of stone. I give the film ""2 Trunks Up!""",1379289600,,391,4.924242424242424
8552461,5,B00AJ7ACB6,"""The Eyes of Thailand"" is a short documentary film that is really more intended as an intentionally conspicuous film device to make aware the plight of war and its horrible, devastating aftermath on elephants in Thailand.  It focuses mainly on poor elephants mutilated by landmines, but it also includes human victims of war.

Elephants are the symbols of Asia, and yet the people there use them as draft animals, slaves, and beasts of burden.  They routinely beat them, take away their offspring, and subject them to harsh conditions on logging farms or sell them off to circuses.

Anyone watching this documentary film who does not cry for at least one year, is well, inhumane.  If you are prone to suffering, it will be extremely difficult to watch the elephant's leg damage due to  landmine explosions.

It also details Soraida Salwala, who founded the first elephant hospital, ""Friends of Asian Elephants Hospital"" in Lampang, Thailand, who I regard as a saint to elephants.",1372032000,4,979,5.006172839506172
8552462,5,B00AJ7ACB6,This amazing true story follows a group of dedicated people saving the lives of elephants. They create prostheses for elephants who are injured from land mines. Imagine building a new leg or foot to support an elephant. It is amazing to watch. Soraida's dedication and love for these injured elephants moved my heart and soul. Thank you for the hopeful movie.,1362009600,8,359,4.901639344262295
