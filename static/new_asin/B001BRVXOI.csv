8284382,3,B001BRVXOI,"WORD OF WARNING ON ALL OF THE REDSKINS SUPERBOWL GAMES, THEY SHOULD SAY, THE REDSKINS SEASON THAT ENABLED THE REDSKINS TO GO TO, AMERICA'S GAME. SUPERBOWLS FILMS LAST ABOUT 10 MINS. IF I WANTED TO WATCH THE STRIKE SEASON GAMES, I WOULD HAVE ORDERED SOMETHING ELSE.

8284383,5,B001BRVXOI,Awesome. I bought the gift for Xmas for my father.  My dad went to Grambling in school with Doug Williams and he recorded the game back in 1987 when we had vcr tapes.  And one night he came home and played it and it was a movie that my brother taped from HBO on it. And he was soooo upset.  So I surprised him after 30 years with a DVD tape of the best Super Bowl of all time!!!!!!,1519948800,,381,3.7974683544303796

8284387,4,B001BRVXOI,"This was the season history was made. That is what makes this DVD so significant. It really is the story of the end of the belief that Black Quarterbacks simply lacked the leadership abilities and intelligence to play the position much less participate in a Super Bowl Win. How Doug Williams 4th. in votes for the Heiseman while playing for Coach Eddie Robinson at Grambling was drafted by the lowly Tampa Bay Bucs. The Little Big Horn for Quarterbacks. How he lost his young bride who  tragically passed away suddenly. His stint with the USFL black uniformed Oklahoma Outlaws for 2 seasons & have the league fold. But one man was allways in his corner. Joe Gibbs. For older African Americans who remember Marlin Brisco of Denver, Jefferson street Joe Gilliam of the Steelers, & James Harris of the Rams this DVD is a tearfull reminder of a long hard journey for all of us.",1403827200,,873,4.632258064516129
