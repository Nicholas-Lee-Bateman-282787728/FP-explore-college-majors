In this tale, thought not fantastic in itself, you have some of the very best choreography of any Bollywood film.  In the US if we were talking about a really good group of musicians who were perfectly synchronized we would call that group 'tight'.  Well, the dancers in this film are really good, really tight, and the visual appearance during the dance numbers is exceptional.  It is the kind of film that can make you really happy to be alive through seeing the romance alternating and intertwined with the dance numbers.  Very well done.",1369440000,,649,4.707964601769912
8427143,3,B004EL5NGM,"A wonderful tag line, a beautiful crew and a re-owned director - well the combination should have worked but it fails to do so. The story is very new to Hindi cinema although you tend to feel seeing glimpses from Titanic in the beginning. All mistakes that a director can make is been made in this movie. Even Vivekoberoi fails to shine in what i call a mess of a screenplay. Isha Sharvani - should have been in circus, apart from her dangling from ropes shes ""made"" to do nothing in the movie. A sweet surprise is Antonia Bernath, shes a natural actor-too bad KISNA turned out to be her debut in Indian Cinema.

A word on the stunts and action,I feel Indian cinema lacks a good stunt co-coordinator, the film makes a mockery of tense action scenes. in what is supposed to be a edge of seat experience it makes us to laugh at its silliness. perhaps we need to import stunt so-coordinators from holly hood instead of just heroins.

well to sum it up, The film is average",1303084800,,969,4.377777777777778
