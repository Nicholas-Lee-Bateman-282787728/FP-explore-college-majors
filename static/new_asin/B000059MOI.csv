7933608,5,B000059MOI,"I was a litle dubious about this Korean copy of a seldom seen Archers film that I've wanted for awhile for my collection, especially because I'd already had bad luck with a couple of so-called ""Region 0"" DVDs I'd purchased on EBay (fortunately, each seller refunded my purchase price); however, this DVD was advertised as NTSC encoded so I thought I'd take a chance and also assumed Amazon might back me up if there was a problem.  Fortunately, the DVD plays well and I'm quite pleased with this addition to my Archers collection.",1398211200,3,530,4.698924731182796
7933609,5,B000059MOI,I love this movie and was thrilled to find the movie in great condition and just as described and fast shipping. Loved it!,1354579200,2,122,4.3478260869565215
7933610,4,B000059MOI,"An overlooked wonder. The Korean import is perfect. The film looks as good as it did when first released, and this is the origial verson, not the version David O. Selznick cut and butchered. A lovely film.",1268524800,6,205,4.5675675675675675
7933611,5,B000059MOI,Very odd but exquisite movie; unusual and very far-out. Not a movie you would see all the time.  I really like it. The main thing is that Jennifer Jones is a very free spirit.  She loves animals and that's what's so interesting---it drives her and I understand that.,1264809600,4,266,4.520833333333333

Thanks for such a quick delivery.",1250812800,2,88,4.235294117647059
7933613,3,B000059MOI,"This Korean release is the only Region 1 version available in early 2009. Yes, the Korean subtitles can be suppressed. As a Powell-Pressburger film (1950), Criterion is sure to issue a definitive version sooner or later, with supplements to explicate the ups and downs of the movie's exhibition. Originally 110 minutes, the film was cut to 82 minutes and retitled The Wild Heart for American release in 1952, and included narration by Joseph Cotten. So the Korean version is the long version, but not quite complete at the end (?). The print is good but does have pulsating tone values (due to PAL-NTSC conversion?), on the subtle side. And of course, switches between outdoor shots and process shots are obvious.

Set in the countryside of Shropshire in 1897, the Thomas Hardy-esqe story is from a Mary Webb novel (1917). Jennifer Jones, running barefoot over hill and dale and in the first blush of womanhood, clutching to her breast her treasured fox (the animal, not the furpiece), soon marries Parson Cyril Cusack, a fine man but not given to consummaton through the flesh. Lusty Squire David Farrar, with a strong horse between his legs and often riding out with the fox-hunting hounds, soon appropriates Jennifer the new virginal wife for his own use. Actually, SHE goes to HIM after incanting at a great rock, leaving her wide colored scarf there blowing in the wind. Torn between the two men, she finally rushes out to save Foxy during a hunt in progress, knowing both she and the rusty-coated pet may be taken by the dogs. But no, she is spared by God, Who Works In Strange Ways. Next the screen fills with mountainous clouds, and a strong male voice calls out ""Gone To Earthhhh!"", the quarry is beyond reach.

At this point, I recollect there used to be a cut to the scarf on the rock fluttering gossamer-like as the deep purple falls (but I may be confusing with Wild Heart). These five seconds are missing from the Korean print, as well as ""The End"" title. There is no screen crediting a digitizing-processing source. An inexpensive video with just this small flaw.

The film is in strong color (at least on this Korean DVD), more the Hollywood palette than the Old Oil Painting smoked colors of Shropshire County, with a fine music score, like those pastoral suites which British composers are so good at. David O. Selznick, husband of Jennifer Jones, cofinanced the production. With girlish voice, Jennifer hardly manifests any accent though surrounded by accents. She gets a lot of costumes and three or four coiffures. She's always grabbing at that fox but, damn, it never bites her. Did the vet use wires, screws, rubber rings, or dental bond to shut its temperamental mouth?",1235260800,9,2693,4.8120950323974085
7933614,4,B000059MOI,I found this to be an engaging and thought-provoking film.  Not a Sunday afternoon comedy.  Typical Powell and Pressburger quality - definitely a keeper that you will want to watch again.,1203552000,5,187,5.0
7933615,1,B000059MOI,"Very strange, very uneven film. Save your money. There ARE a few scenes that are worth looking at - but really only a few minutes worth and the rest of the movie's just an ordeal to sit through. Definitely a committee effort, and I think jennifer jones was an appalling choice (not least because she's unable to conceal her oklahoma accent...)",1147564800,5,343,4.639344262295082
