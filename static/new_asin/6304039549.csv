776183,5,6304039549,"Hemingway decide to make an apparent simple story when in reality , he would write one of his most emblematic and passionate works.
Santiago is a simple man . In all his life nothing has happened , a flat life in the middle of this fisher community.
Suddenly the fate's call comes for him . 84 days in the sea ? twelve weeks without getting any important piece.
This means the unavoidable journey , the invisible conflicy between the man and the nature . You have to realize that the sea has been for this single fisherman a friend and a silent lover and witeness of his miseries and hopeless.
Suddenly he catchs a gorgeous piece; a beauty blue needle fish. His triumph deserved all the hunger since three months he left his home. This means the epic fight. But the long arm of the fate smiled him just for a brief moment , the sharks will appear and the tragedy begins .
Now Santiago has to fight to preserve his piece . The fight is inhuman and awful , he must leave that zone and keep the fish .
More than a fish you've killed a man replies in loud voice our simple man.
When our hero arrives to the coast he's another man . He won the combat and no matter there were no witeness . The life in many times it's capricious , but you must never give up . You must follow your bliss , no matter how high be the prize you pay.
Spencer Tracy made a top knotch performance with this one.
The film  keeps its inner force and the spirit of the original novel, since its release forty six years ago.
Watch this movie . It goes far beyond than a simple entertaining !
Dazzling direction and obviously who can fail with a script like this one?
A cult movie !",1088726400,9,1649,4.185534591194968
776184,5,6304039549,"Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea is a story about an old sea fisherman and his struggle with a greatest fish he has ever seen.  The story takes place on the coast of Cuba in a small fishing village.  Due to the fact he has not caught a fish in eighty-four days, his young apprentice is forced to go fish in a more prosperous boat. Although the book seems to have a simple plot, there is a lot of symbolism and the ending was interesting.
Some criticize The Old Man and the Sea for dragging on, but the character development only makes it more interesting to find out what happens.  The main character, Santiago, is modest and keeps up hope despite his circumstance. His willingness to keep on, even despite his outcome, is moving.
Hemingway's style of writing also creates a detailed environment.  The plot may be too straightforward but what it lacks, it makes up for rich detail.  The way Hemingway depicts man's battle with nature makes it a good book to read.
The symbolism in the book is hard to read at first. As the book goes on, Hemingway uses more and more words that link Santiago to Christ and are very hard to miss.  During the old man's battle with the fish, fishing cable cuts his palms.  When carrying a mast across his shoulders in the village, images of Christ's march to Calgary can be related.
I would suggest this book to almost anyone over fifteen. The book is short (around a hundred pages) and straightforward. Although it has such a simple plot, the symbolism is a little more difficult to understand.  Writing in short declarative sentences, Hemingway's style of writing makes it harder to read.",1080432000,3,1630,4.577319587628866
776185,5,6304039549,"Santiago is an aged Cuban fisherman who has not caught any fish for eighty-four straight days. Because he is considered unlucky by the other villagers, the young boy who usually assists Santiago is told by his parents to join a luckier boat which has recently been catching some fish.
On the eighty-fifth day Santiago sets out alone and after a while he hooks a huge marlin. Most of the rest of the movie is about Santiago's struggle with the marlin and his battles with attacking sharks which are trying to eat the big fish. The story is also about Santiago's relationship with the boy who cares for the old man both before and after his epic voyage. The boy is indebted to Santiago for all that he has learned from him about fishing. Santiago is a widower and childless.
Much of the film shows Santiago alone at sea struggling with the marlin. In other words the movie is mostly focused on Spencer Tracy who does an excellent job of holding the viewer's interest.
In spite of Tracy's great performance, however, I still think that Anthony Quinn would have been a better choice for the role of Santiago - except for the fact that Quinn was fifteen years younger than Tracy.
The script closely follows Hemingway's novel which makes the movie even more remarkable.",1035676800,16,1263,4.668161434977579
776186,4,6304039549,"I was 8 years old when my Mother and I went to see this movie.  I remember how determined this man was to land a fish, any fish, not just a big one.  Spencer Tracy was a fine actor and this film probably has been much overlooked, especially by the younger generation, whom rely on special effects more than true human qualities. It is a powerful performance and a testament to human strength , courage and perseverance.  I'm glad it was released on DVD and I was able to see it again after many years.",1010793600,14,501,4.252631578947368

The film progresses as a Hemmingway novel reads...superbly  narrated throughout.  Watch it when you're able to devote your full  attention to it, and you will find yourself drawn into this great story  about hardship, perserverence, and respect.  A great tale, with a very  human core, set against the great power of Nature...done superbly in movie  format.  It became an instant favorite on my first viewing.",913680000,6,561,5.202247191011236

776410,5,6304039549,"This is a well-told tale about an old fisherman and his love for the sea. He lives on a small island in an old shack. One of his few friends is a young boy who looks after him.  He goes fishing hoping to catch anything because he hasn't caught anything in a long time and needs the money and fish. He is wondering in the sea not knowing where he is. he throws his line hoping to catch some fish. while he is waiting for something to bite, he reflects on his life and his love for the sea. This story is written in the stream of consciousness literary method like Virginia Woolf. Suddenly a fish bites his line and he struggles to pull his catch in. it is a large Dpohin which he ties to his small boat and turns around and head back to shore. Suddenly, a shark appears and heads toward his fish. he uses his paddle to chase the shark away. but the shark takes a large bite of his Dolphin and then leaves, but he leaves a trail of blood which soon attracts other sharks. He tries to run for it, but the shark bite from his Dolphin and when he returns home most of the Dolphin has been eaten. He goes to his shack and the young boy helps him. Some tourist look at the remains of the shark tied to his small boat. One of them is a woman who marvels at the perfect shape of the Dolphins tail. The old man is the center of this novel and meditates about his relationship to the sea as if it were a woman he was in love with. But he is in love with nature. This is a novella about an old man's struggle in a wild environment.  Richard Shaw is the author of Writing As Consolation. Audible and Kindle.",1510617600,,1594,4.041139240506329

But okay, I'll accept the huge stretch of genres, even geography. So, the film itself is, of course, lovely, and from what I remember very faithful to the novel. I actually taught the book to students in a previous lifetime of mine.  I think the film, unlike the novel which will always have a readership, will not suit all contemporary sensibilities here in America.  Still, for those of us who can still focus on a single, brilliant act (Aristotelian?), Spencer Tracy's performance makes this film a must see.  A wide viewership or not, this film will always deserve five stars.",1414886400,,778,4.698529411764706

It was good viewing for us both. I recommend this film as a fine black and white movie classic based on a novel by a well regarded author.

776986,5,6304039549,"A classic novel written by the famed Author - Ernest Hemingway, which is brought to the big-screen. In this masterful DVD production of ""paying the price to get what you want but once you get it, how will you go about keeping it?"" Everybody always wants something. But with limited resources, isolated and completely alone, how does one defend and keep the prize that the sharks, so diligently, want to steal from you? In this story, things are a little bit, simpler. The village thinks he's a lonesome loser, who will never catch the big fish he always claims, he will. A little boy, is his only friend, who visits and looks out for him, daily. Then one day, the old fisherman sets sail and gets a bite. Recognizing that it's no ordinary bite..., but THE BITE, he hangs on! He continues to hang on. Then, he hangs on, some more. Drifting and being pulled out to sea, hungry and thirsty, he still..., hangs on. Meanwhile, his loyal, little friend, the boy, canvases the coastline in search of his friend, the fisherman. Having allowed himself to be pulled out of familiar and safe territory and out onto the  uncharted depths of the sea, the old man was losing his battle with the waves, that all but washed him over. With the tenacity of a crab, his hands bleeding from his refusal to let go of the weight of his prize, he utilizes his last ounce of strength and out maneuvers the big fish. He reels it in and ties it to the side of the boat. He finally..., got his prize. The fish, that nobody thought that he would catch, he has caught. And on his, own. With his second wind in strength, he ties the huge fish to the side of the boat. He got his prize. Oh, what a story he will tell but first, he has to get back to shore. Initially, this movie starts out slowly but dear reader, when viewing the film, pretend you're a patient fisherman waiting..., for the fish to come to your hook and take the bait. Then, when it does, that's when the action starts. I call it, 'film-fishing'. It starts slowly but picks up, fast. The further he gets out to sea, the more it stirs your mind and heart. This book and film were called 'classics' for a very good reason. Because there is a very poignant message within simplicity and all that it has to offer.

But nevertheless,he did a marvelous job of portraying the Cuban fisherman as he managed to help the viewers relate to the experiences that he was undergoing while fishing in the middle of the sea. Added to that,he also captured the emotions that the fisherman felt in every events that he is experiencing and how it could relate to the viewer with respect to his/her different life experiences.

He goes out on his 85th day w/o a fish (he appears to be fishing for marlin) and hooks a big one that carries him way out to sea. He finally gets the fish after several days at sea fighting him and ties him along side his skiff.

777334,4,6304039549,"Having read Hemingway's novella by the same title several times I was and am quite familiar with the story as it was originally written.  This is one of the few movies which have been made from novels that hit pretty close to the mark as to following the original plot and following the author's intentions.

It has been quite a number of years since I first saw this film and to be frank, I had forgotten much.  I was delighted to give this one another viewing and assess it though the eyes of a much, much older man.  I was not disappointed.  The plot is pretty well known; or most certainly should be by now, so I will not give a blow by blow account.  Suffice to say that the Old Man, Santiago has gone for a total of 84 days without catching a fish.  Spencer Tracy, playing the lead as Santiago sets out despite the loss of respect (for lack of a better term) of his village and despite the fact that he has lost confidence in his abilities.

Tracy plays his part as well as I have seen an actor play any part in any movie.  He has it down perfect.

This entire movie is the story of a man; a man against nature.  There are no scenes of things being blown up, there are no vampires, there is little to no sharp dialog and I fear that by today's movie standards that this movie will no longer appeal to everyone.  It is an extremely thoughtful movie which strips human emotions down to the bare bone, slowly a layer at a time.  Most of the movie, like the novel is purely symbolic - a method of writing and indeed, movie making that is becoming quite rare these days.  This movie causes; or at least should cause, the viewer to become rather introspective as to him or her self and as to humanity and nature overall.

Yes, we have an old man battling a very big fish under what we now would consider very primitive conditions.  The real battle though is not between the man and the fish, but rather the man against himself.  Tracy does a spectacular job in this area.  It is not the sort of role you would expect Tracy to play but I have to tell you that I feel he nails it perfectly.

Even the interaction between the Old Man and the young boy is symbolic in nature in that the story allows us to consider faith and respect.  And as to ""respect,"" the story also forces us to evaluate and examine our respect, or in some cases, our lack of respect for ""Nature.""  This is an aspect of living in our modern world that we quite too often fail, much to our detriment.

Excellent movie but as I said, this one will not be for everyone. I personally am glad I gave this one a third viewing - older eyes do see things differently!

This is a movie that requires soul searching.  It is partially about aging and what it does to the mind and body; the body because that is simply organic and must return gradually to the earth (or to the sea) and the mind because it is far above the body, it's anguish magnified tenfold by what it knows is happening but is powerless to control anymore.  It is a tale of triumph and defeat; of the strange and infuriating elements of ""luck and nature"" that life is made of.  There is background narrative of excerpts from the book which underscores the power of Hemingway's intent for those who take the time to feel the movie as well as see it.

In a strange role reversal, the Old Man (Spencer Tracy) is being taken care of by a boy who lives in the same fishing village; a boy who somehow is connected with him through tradition and unexplained psyche.  The boy is refusing to let the Old Man give up - because he somehow recognizes that this man had been a ""man of men"" who must not be abandoned in his old age.  On this fateful morning, the Old Man awakens early, hoping for ""good luck"" goes back out equipped with bait supplied by the boy.  Many times during the journey, the Old Man ""wishes the boy were there"" with him, grasping for the youthful vigor ""of the as yet undefeated spirit"" to support him.

The sea in the early morning light is breathtaking - the light of dawn touching the water, blue clouds drifting past a silver moon peeking out behind; a flock of sea birds diving and calling as they too, pit themselves against the open ocean in search of sustenance.  This untrammeled ethereal splendor soon turns to physical fury as the Old man actually rows out into a school of Marlin, and his ""luck"" changes.  The struggle with the Marlin is beautiful and breathtaking; blue sea erupting in white foam as the magnificent fish leaps and crashes back in sprays of animated glory.  As I watched the struggle, I couldn't help but wonder why the old boy didn't just give a wrap or two around the knob on the front of his boat, dally style rather than watching the skin disappear from his hands beneath the fury of the fish during the fight; but I didn't write the script.

The final poignant scenes as the Old Man returns to his village after his battle with sea and fin - are some that almost everyone can identify with at some time or another in their own life's drama.",1330732800,3,2595,4.412997903563942

Considering that Hemingway's novel is really not very cinematic this was probably as good a film as could have been made out of the source material, but between the laughable model of the ship and the constant, constant narration by a not-Hispanic looking Spencer Tracy, there's not much to recommend here; the filmmakers get points for their devotion and effort, but they didn't make an especially good film.

Well I can only say that this person probably has no interest in Character study, Human Nature, Literature, Human Inner Struggle and even Good Comedy and should consider confining his/her  Comments & Critiques to Subjects that have nothing to do with the Human Condition. I would also suggest for this person to find a way to broaden his/her horizon by Traveling,Good Books,Literary works by renowned Authors and even merely observing other people and maybe only maybe his/her horizon might broaden.
I will be honest and have not been able to get into it yet, because unfortunately I have a short attention span. I am willing to give it a second try knowing that Ernest Hemingway was such an accomplished writer and got a Nobel Prize for this work. I will probably read the Book first then see the Movie again.
I have a special interest in this story because I am Cuban born and have also been in Cojimar, the fishing Town where the story took place. It will be of interest that Hemingway was adopted by the Cuban people and he based his story on a real fisherman who lived in Cojimar and became his friend.
I was a a young girl when the story was written (1953) and lived there until 1962. In the 1940's & 50's the pace of life in Cuba was much slower than here, specially in small Fishing Towns like Cojimar. It is a very different world from the one we know here in the USA but it is a wonderful one to live or vacation since it is so relaxing. Your tensions just melt away. The Movie may not be for everyone for its style departs from the ones where they chew it for you. I am sure the book is much better as you can enjoy Heminway's wonderful descriptive prose and enjoy a world foreign to so many here in the USA.
I spent my best Summer days/hours at a Beach named Baracoa, in Havana's North Coast, not far from where the story took place, and met real Cuban Fisherman there.

777472,3,6304039549,"This version of Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea is a faithful adaptation of the novel. The story focuses on Santiago, an old man who has spent 84 days without catching a fish. Spencer Tracey plays the old man to perfection for the most part, as he sets out on the 85th day to capture his big prize. While it isn't a movie that blows you away with either script or action, it is a film with a purpose.

Perhaps what most viewers or critics of this movie won't get is that it is richly symbolic in nature, and therefore probably won't appeal to viewers who lack attention spans. Most of Santiago's stuggle is within himself, and his age is a symbol for wisdom and perseverance. The boy, his counterpart, continually befriends him in hopes that the one day will arrive when he brings home the big catch.

The movie really is a testament to Man versus Nature, and is able to depict this sucessfully. One of the most essential points of the story is not only Santiago's respect for the sea and its inhabitants, but the essential quality of being successful at something.

If you are expecting a ton of action, or some big crash or storm scenes, then this probably isn't your movie. However, if you want a movie that successfully illustrates what Hemingway wanted for his short novela, then this is it.

777473,4,6304039549,"Spencer Tracy gives a powerful performance as Santiago, the desperate old fisherman who must struggle to subdue and then keep the giant marlin that represents his salvation.  Director John Sturges and screenwriter Peter Viertel retain much of Ernest Hemingway's symbolism, making of Santiago a Christ-like figure.  A more apt Biblical analog might be Job; like him, Santiago endures the indignities and strife thrust upon him, but perseveres and endures while retaining his appreciation of nature and simple pleasures./

There is a lot of voice-over narration in this film.  In addition to playing Santiago, Tracy reads excerpts from the novel to deepen and comment upon the action.  In most cases, I would be annoyed by such pervasive intrusion, but it makes sense here because Santiago spends so much time alone.  In addition, since the narration is drawn directly from the novel, it provides the added pleasure of a wonderful actor performing Hemingway's deceptively simple prose.",1109376000,53,983,5.35064935064935
777474,5,6304039549,"The title says it all. The most compelling thing to note in the story of Santiago, (the lead character)is the implication that any of his contemporaries would likely have reacted to his plight in the same way. Not through any special courage, but through a plain lack of choice. A simple fisherman on a hard luck streak, he does the only thing he can do, he keeps fishing. The sea is the only thing he has ever known, and so he turns to it day after day despite recent failure.

 His protoge' too is no doubt typical; a young boy who loves his mentor and cares for him unconditionally. Any boy who watches will want to help a man, and any man who sees this will want to teach a boy.

 The movie is touching enough to have ""Hollywood"" written across it's face...or to have ""real life"" written accross it's face. Thanks to Hemmingway, and Tracy, it is decidedly the latter.",1102723200,26,871,4.391304347826087

They were captivated by the shark scene and felt the loss of the Old Man.
