I don't have many, but this is one of my all time favorites.  Others are:  The Protector, The Ninja and Five Fingers of Death.",1328486400,,264,3.9245283018867925

8107618,3,B000E99U94,"Philip Kwok, Lu Feng, and Chiang Sheng are members of a righteous gang who have a fight with a group of rivals that results in their leader's death.  After deciding that Lu Feng should be the new leader, the authorities arrive and say that someone has to take the fall for the fight.  Mister Kwok is elected scapegoat and the officers let him take off for a while 'til the heat blows over and he can return.  A while later(presumably months) dudes start coming after Philip in the restaurant that he's employed at.  Chiang Sheng shows up after being excommunicated to help his brother fight off the assassins with the additional help of the mysterious Spearman and figure out what's going on.

If you've ever seen a Venoms movie, you know what's going on; Lu Feng is a jerk and actually usurped leadership in the first place and is now involving their organization in assorted debauchery.  It's now up to our 3 heroes to take him down.

There are a few slow stretches in this, but it's pretty good.  I bought this at the same time as ""Crippled Avengers"" and I liked this one quite a bit more, though it's far from the best of the Venoms.  The last fight between Philip Kwok and Lu Feng is fantastic, though by this time in their respective careers, they were quite accustomed to fighting one another.

This copy is titled ""Flag of Iron"" and though there is nothing printed on the box about it being remastered, the picture quality is EXCELLENT.  It's not quite as crisp as restored versions of other Shaw films, but if it had said it on the cover, I wouldn't have questioned it.  This film is recommended to fans of old-school kung fu in general and fans of Shaw Bros. and the Venoms in particular.  3.5
