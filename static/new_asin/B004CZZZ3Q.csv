4331109,3,B004CZZZ3Q,This movie had a lot of acting (good) but not enough of the real battle---would like to have seen more,1373155200,,102,4.15
4331110,5,B004CZZZ3Q,U.S. Navy submarine Lt. Commander Jeff Conway played by Cliff Robertson is the Commanding Officer on two different submarine war patrols to start the film. The Commanding Officer manages to save his crew from certain death on his second submarine war patrol and escapes from a Japanese prisoner of war camp to make a difference in the Battle of Coral Sea. The United States of America owes its success to winning WWII from Commanding Officers like these and their submarine crews. The historical film footage looks GREAT.,1371859200,3,521,5.0
4331111,4,B004CZZZ3Q,this movie was very well done and has lots of intresting war time footage and action to boot. overall any person who likes wwII films will find this movie very intresting to watch and should be added to any serious movie buffs wwII collection,1370908800,,242,4.5227272727272725
4331112,4,B004CZZZ3Q,"If you are interested in WW II, this is an interesting movie about what led up to the defeat of the Japanese in the South Seas.",1364169600,,127,3.923076923076923
4331113,1,B004CZZZ3Q,"This movie was bad when it was first released and it is bad now.  The title is totally misleading,  (it has almost nothing to do with the battle of the Coral Sea) the ""special effects"" look like they were filmed in the 1920's and not in 1959, and the entire film is dreary, completely unrealistic and boring.  Give this one a pass.",1359590400,24,331,4.306451612903226
4331114,1,B004CZZZ3Q,I know the histroy of this very important battle. This story is objectionable and insulting to the people who were involved.,1353974400,6,124,4.9523809523809526
4331115,3,B004CZZZ3Q,"The dvd is in it's self good, the movie is realy poorly done for a cliff robertson movie. The story line is not writen very good and realy does not have anything to do with the battle it self, as I would have thought the title was going to portray some seans from the war.",1352246400,2,272,3.963636363636364
4331116,4,B004CZZZ3Q,"This film had its' moments, but some of the acting was wooden and some of the story was a bit far fetched for WW2. On the whole it was entertaining, not a film for folks who prefer a lot of realism,just one to watch and not dwell on the details much.",1341446400,16,250,3.9215686274509802
4331117,3,B004CZZZ3Q,"The title of the movie is is not what the movie is about.
This movie is 1 hour 45 minutes of Cliff Robertson and
Gia Scala and 15 minutes of the actual Coral Sea battle.
Dissapointing to say the least.",1338249600,35,201,4.05

4331120,4,B004CZZZ3Q,A Great Classic War film. Worth seeing a number of times,1467936000,,56,4.181818181818182
4331121,2,B004CZZZ3Q,It was more of a romance novel that documentary information on the actual event.  Not bad but not what I thought it would be,1467158400,,124,4.166666666666667
4331122,3,B004CZZZ3Q,I wouldn't say this is the best film.,1442880000,,37,3.75

4331124,1,B004CZZZ3Q,"Not about the Battle of Coral Sea at all.  If you are looking for a movie about the battle, this is not it.",1438560000,4,107,3.652173913043478
4331125,3,B004CZZZ3Q,A bit cheesy for a Cliff Robertson movie but it is OK.,1431820800,,54,3.5833333333333335

4331129,5,B004CZZZ3Q,"The Battle of the Coral Sea, was the first Naval battle in history, where the fleets did not see each other. The Carrier was high, low, Jack in this Game. We lost the Lexington, with many sailors, and the Yorktown, was critically wounded. They stopped the Japanese from invading Port Moresby, New Guinea. This was May 4th, 1942. My Father arrived at Port Moresby on May 3rd, 1942. Thank you men, from a grateful Son. Rest Well. Lest We Forget.",1405728000,,443,4.55
4331130,5,B004CZZZ3Q,I remember watching this movie when I was growing up. I liked it then and I still do. It's a great WWII movie. You would enjoy it.,1404864000,,130,3.8518518518518516
4331131,5,B004CZZZ3Q,"Excellent movie for the whole family to watch, to learn about history, from  world war 2, naval sea battles that our navy men fought and won, against all odds against them",1401840000,,171,4.516129032258065
4331132,1,B004CZZZ3Q,Totally misleading title and a terrible movie besides. As a history buff I am insulted that such a piece of garbage was allowed to be sold with such a title.,1395187200,8,157,4.266666666666667
4331133,2,B004CZZZ3Q,"The title has little to do with the film.  Promises to be a good naval war film and ends up as an implausible escape from Japanese POW camp.  The US film makers have many real heroes' stories to tell, many CMH recipients, but ignores their exploits in favour of tripe.",1393718400,9,268,4.34
4331134,3,B004CZZZ3Q,I expected more on the actual battle of the Coral Sea. The movie showed the capture an escape of the submarine's officers and then only 5 minutes of some dive bombers and exploding Japanese ships. I  was disappointed that more of the historical facts of the battle were not portrayed....,1392768000,10,287,4.74
4331135,1,B004CZZZ3Q,More documentary than a war movie when I am watching a war movie I want a war movie. Gung ho.,1388016000,,93,3.7
4331136,3,B004CZZZ3Q,"Doesn't really cover the battle, more a story up to the battle. It lacks action, but is interesting enough to keep your attention.",1383436800,,130,4.695652173913044
4331137,1,B004CZZZ3Q,I had never heard of the movie before. Now I know why. The movie has nothing to do with the Battle of the Coral Sea. Weak plot despite big star name. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. Watching it is a compete waste of time.,1383091200,,229,3.893617021276596
8424462,1,B004CZZZ3Q,"Played great for about 40 minutes then the picture pixelated and locked up the player.  Good movie, poor quality control in manufacture.",1521158400,,136,5.181818181818182
8424463,5,B004CZZZ3Q,no comment,1504396800,,10,4.5

8424470,4,B004CZZZ3Q,"good film, with some things we did not know",1484179200,,43,3.888888888888889
8424471,2,B004CZZZ3Q,I agree this movie has nothing to do about the real battle as stated in the title...always liked Cliff Robertson but this one was a dud..hopefully someday a producer/director will redo this movie like it should been done in the first place...also another movie on the Battle of Midway is long overdue too...why can't someone finally get it right????,1481673600,,349,4.932203389830509
