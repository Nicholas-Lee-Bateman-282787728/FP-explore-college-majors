8382839,3,B002W64ZWO,Too much time wasted on the changing of the guard.  Narrator was very dry.  Not as good as other videos in the Cities of the World series.  The narration and what is being shown on the screen often do not match up.,1484352000,,214,4.0476190476190474

8382841,1,B002W64ZWO,This is just pictures of places with a very little bit of not very interesting narration. Extremely boring and not useful for planning travel.,1425945600,,142,4.958333333333333
8382842,4,B002W64ZWO,"The narrator has a soothing voice, pleasant to listen to and follow.  The photography is spectacular.  It discusses each place with just enough info to keep your interest but leaves you wanting more...You get a good feel for Athens and its surrounding areas.  Great DVD for someone planning a first visit.
I would have liked, though, a bit of info on the transportation system such as how to get the new tram, the on off bus, how to hail a taxi without the world renowned rip off, are signs in english, etc.  I think first time Athens visitors would appreciate the information.",1284163200,,577,4.627450980392157
