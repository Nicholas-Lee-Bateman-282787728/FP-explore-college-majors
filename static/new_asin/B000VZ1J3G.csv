I love all of these stories but I have to say that The 3 Little Pigs and the Owl and the Pussycat were my favorites and I'll explain why.

The 3 Little Pigs. I LOVED the narrator in this story!!!!! He did a PHENOMENAL performance giving the characters unique voices! I especially loves the voice he gave to the wolf!! He really made that wolf sound really wicked and evil!!

The Owl and the Pussycat. Those gutairs. Need I say more? It's the most GORGEOUS music on the guitar I've ever heard in my enitire life!!!

Happy Birthday Moon had really great music too. It's so peacful and serene that it could make the earilest risers sleep in for an hour or two.

And the other two stories Peter's Chair and the Napping House are wonderful too.

Get this movie for your kids. It tells five wonderful stories with beautiful music.",1261872000,,973,4.3535911602209945
