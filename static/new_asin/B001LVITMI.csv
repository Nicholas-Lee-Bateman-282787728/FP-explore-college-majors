8319890,5,B001LVITMI,"Effie Chow is one of the leading alternative healers in the world, as well as an award winning doctor, and Qigong Master. I was really happy to finally get her videos, and the book which she co-authored with Charles McGee; ""Miracle Healing from China-Qigong"". The book and DVDs are available from Amazon. In addition, Dr Chow also has a Qigong meditation CD which isn't available through Amazon, but can be purchased through a link on her site which is the East West Academy for the Healing Arts - [...]

I became interested in Dr Chow after fracturing my spine and suffering from severe chronic pain, as well as being diagnosed with fibromalgia and chronic fatigue. I believe the latter stem from numerous accidents over the years. My body finally said enough is enough! When western medicine didn't offer any real and long lasting relief, I turned to alternative methods of pain relief. Combining the two - Eastern and Western medicine has been much more helpful in relieving pain.

Dr Chow and the East West Academy offer many intensive programs to learn their Qigong method of healing as well as shorter classes and seminars for those who would like to learn how to heal themselves. The more intensive 100 or 400 hour program is for anyone who would like to learn the complete method, but mostly for people who are learning to become Qigong healers themselves. Dr Chow teaches throughout the world each year and also offers private consultations at the East West Academy in San Francisco.

Chow Qigong is a powerful system where one can learn techniques of health assessment using energy concepts, skills in touch healing, acupressure, energy manipulation, traditional Chinese massage, relaxation skills, as well as Qigong exercises which boost your Qi in order to maximize stamina, wellness, and disease prevention.  The above is augmented by methods of visualization and meditation specially developed by Dr Chow.

Dr Chow's 100 hour training program is an integral component of a more extensive 400 hour training course. Dr. Chow's training program is based on the model developed at the East West Academy of Healing Arts by Dr. Chow with the cooperation of the University of California, San Francisco Extension, Division of Nursing Continuing Education.  It has been implemented in Kalispel, Minneapolis, San Francisco, Seatle, Spokane, Washington D.C. and the Canadian cities of Edmonton, Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto, and Waterloo, as well as many other areas.  Dr. Chow  combines the ancient and modern, Eastern and Western theories and practices, as well as her own original theories and practices utilizing Energy Principles.  The Chow Integrated Healing System is dynamically effective, as well as cost effective.

Dr Chow was a Presidential Appointee to the White House Commission on
Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy. She's had 40 years of Qigong and TCM training and practice. In addition, she also has a Ph. D. and a Masters in behavioral sciences and communication, as well as being a skilled acupuncturist, and public health and psychiatric nurse",1235174400,8,3076,5.158634538152611
