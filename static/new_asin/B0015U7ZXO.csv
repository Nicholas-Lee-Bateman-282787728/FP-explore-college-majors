While there are other recorded performances with ""bigger name"" artists, none of the singers in this DVD need apologize.  It is a fine production, musically.  However, in an attempt to emphasize the sarcasm, portions of the libretto were re-written with very obvious sexual innuendos.  This simply was not necessary.  Strauss wrote a masterpiece and Die Fledermaus doesn't need any help.",1234224000,6,451,5.295774647887324
3147452,4,B0015U7ZXO,"Although I prefer the Kleiber version (with Pamela Coburn), and the version conducted by Domingo with te Kanawa, this Blu-ray version of Die Fledermaus is quite the spectacle [widescreen, excellent picture and sound, colorful costumes, creative set(s), wonderful cinematography, and fine singing].  The last act (at the jail) is also probably better in this version than the other two.  In the first act, and the most important second act, however,  the Kleiber and Domingo version(s) seem to get much closer to the operetta's spirit, frivolity, and joie de vivre; it's too bad that those gems will forever remain trapped in their pre-Blu-ray, full screen, medium.  But for those of you with widescreen HDTVs, who have grown tired of the fullscreen (1.33:1) black (or worse, grey) sidebars, this Bluray Fledermaus takes full advantage of your HDTV's entire widescreen aspect, and it's not likely that you will be disappointed with it.",1230422400,26,934,5.248322147651007

8259958,2,B0015U7ZXO,"I bought this when it first came out because I wanted the blu ray picture and sound.  But looking at this again, it is depressing to watch.  Deadly serious, dull production.  No life.  This is supposed to be a comic opera!  Compared to the Otto Schenk production this is a real snoozer!",1515888000,,286,4.423076923076923

8259961,3,B0015U7ZXO,"I just watched this version again last night, and it is just too modern for me. As the only blue ray I have found so far the picture and sound is great. The singers cannot be faulted, and it is among my favorite operas. But this production tries to be more modern or different or something. I don't mind it trying to be more sexy. But, Prince Orlofsky and her butler are not convincing or funny, and the final jail scene is not very good. And I miss my slivowitz.",1353542400,,463,4.155555555555556
8259962,5,B0015U7ZXO,"This production of Die Fledermaus was recorded at Glyndebourne in 2003 and delivers a sparkling production and performances to match from an experienced cast.

The singing and the acting is excellent throughout and the cast clearly seem to have a particularly vibrant stage relationship with each other - so important with opera, which after all, is really a sung play at its most basic level. The extensive spoken dialogue, and there really is a great deal, is essential to the plot of course and is very easy to follow in the production which makes use of an adapted script by Stephen Lawless and Daniel Dooner and which can be considered a success.

The whole cast is on top form and it would be invidious to particularly highlight any one or more members as being outstanding within such a group. However, there remain stand-out items that are clearly worth mentioning. Lyubov Petrova delivers an Adel of tremendous technical accuracy and this is clearly established with her early `laughing' song and prepares us for her fine delivery throughout the production. She also has a very attractive stage presence and the humour of the role is well-delivered. Malena Ernman delivers a remarkable performance as Prince Orlofsky. This applies to both her acting and vocal abilities and which is underpinned by the very distinctive tonal qualities of her voice, both in speech and in song. Her actual appearance as the prince is equally distinctive and she brings a dominating aura to the role whenever she is on stage.

The experienced Pamela Armstrong as Rosilinde is well partnered with the equally experienced Thomas Allen as Eisenstein and Par Lindskog maintains a pleasing twinkle in his eye as Alfred. Together they make a satisfying dramatic group to which can be added Artur Korn as Frank the prison governor. Haken Hagegard is a serious Dr. Falke intent on revenge and in this he is matched by Ragner Ulfung as Dr. Blind, Eisenstein's lawyer. The non-singing role of Frosch, played by Udo Samel is as convincing as it can be in the circumstances. Renee Schuttengruber is a suitably flighty sister to Adel in her rather lesser role. The chorus is well up to Glyndebourne standards and the staging is suitably opulent in the first two acts. The slight updating of the setting seems totally appropriate and convincing to my mind.

The orchestra plays superbly under the watchful eye of conductor Vladimir Jurowski and who makes sure that the pace of the performance never falters for a moment.

The recording offers sharp imaging that is detailed without being invasive. It fully captures the changing situations and moods unravelling on stage. The sound is provided in excellent surround 5.0 and stereo. There are a number of bonus features including cast and costume galleries, a description of the architecture of Glyndebourne's new opera house, a documentary on the development of the waltz and a number of interviews with the cast and conductor.

This was, justifiably, a particularly successful Glyndebourne production and here it is captured in all its spontaneous glory and with a particularly fine recording to match. Indeed, this performance is so good and of such a uniformly excellent production that it makes one wonder if there will ever be the need for another, although of course there inevitably will be!

The production and performance sparkles like the champagne so often featured in the opera! I have enjoyed it immensely and am sure many other purchasers will too. It seems very likely that most purchasers of this disc will consider that it is a clear 5 star issue and I would be astonished if there were any serious objections to this enthusiastic rating.

8259963,3,B0015U7ZXO,"Would purchase it:
This Blu Ray is state of the art video and sound,in my estimation very important components in the enjoyment of any audio-visual presentation; after all, our two most important and sense organs are our eyes and ears. The cinematography is excellent, the right framing throughout (unlike many other productions).
The principals are competent and enjoyable: especially Mr & Mrs, the maid Adele, and Count Orlofsky.
The set is wonderful; but alas only one -the same- set is used throughout the performance for all three acts and scenes.
The costuming and lighting are excellent.
The orchestra and conductor are excellent.
The reservations:
Sadly, Orlofsky's party scene is much fore-shortened.
Frosch's part is almost non-existent, a hoot in many other productions
The speaking portions, though often and long, I believe are an addition rather than a detraction. Likewise the time-shifting (30 or so years)from the late 1870's to the early 1900's is handled well.
As previously mentioned, the one-dimensional set though wonderful gets quite repetitive.
Will see several other versions before definitively deciding on a purchase. The three stars reflect this decision.",1303689600,,1183,5.469945355191257
8259964,3,B0015U7ZXO,"Many reviewers before me have gone gaga over the technical excellence of this blu ray disc. Actually the casting and singing and the orchestra is of very good standard, and I have NO complaints about the singing or the acting or the performance/conducting... per se. It is shot very well and sounds great too. One may read what the other reviewers have had to say about the performance insofar as singing is concerned. I agree, I will not repeat those points...

HOWEVER, The producers have gone a little overboard with the conversation part. They tried to make it into a very lengthy evening of play and singing which is of course, what an operetta is all about... but crossed the limits insofar as the un-sung portions are concerned. It makes you wait quite a while between the parts that are sung and makes it into more like a lengthy musical rather than the one notch higher qualities that an operetta is supposed to have. I did not buy this to watch a play... It is the singing that I was more interested in.

If one were to compare this production with say, Kiri te Kanawa/Hermann Prey production, this sounds like Largo compared to the Allegro vivace tempo of that one. With just adequate amount of conversations, that production just kept one enthralled from the beginning to the end.

In this one, after the first time one watches it, I am sure that one would be tempted to press the 'next chapter' button on the remote. Repeatedly watching this one in its entirety would be in the realm of masochists.
I would recommend this blu ray for precisely the same reasons that my fellow reviewers who wrote earlier than me gave it four and five stars,... provided those qualities are the only things you are looking for.... a very fine blu ray disc well shot..
I don't regret buying it, but.......",1297123200,13,1799,4.615625
8259965,4,B0015U7ZXO,"This is the first blue-ray version of an operetta that lends itself to detailed stagecraft. It doesn't disappoint on that score. All of the performances are first rate, notably those of Adele and the Prince. Set decoration uses bright flashes of costume colour against a muted background suggestive of Vienna between the Wars. The second act lacks the sparkle we often expect at a live performance, with none of the 'guest appearances' that we often expect, and none of the ensemble dance numbers. The dialogue has been modernized in a way I found appealing [contrary to another review], a long-standing tradition and not at all inappropriate for an audience that (let's face it) that's out late at night on New Year's Eve and likely drinking during the interval. Frosch unfortunately doesn't get to make a topical standup routine.",1264723200,5,831,5.028985507246377
8259966,5,B0015U7ZXO,"This production is hands-down the best I have seen. All of the principal performers were truly excellent. The sound, lighting and sets were fabulous on the blue-ray disk. Thomas Allen and Pamela Armstrong were hilarious throughout. The role of Prince Orlofsky was performed with absolutely amazing virtuosity by Malena Ernman, while Lyubov Petrova was bubbly as the maid. The nuanced gestures and glances of all the characters were a joy to see on the screen--many times in a theater, the audience misses out on the true subtlety and strength of the acting. Here each twitch and bat of the eyelash were captured perfectly. I applaud the result of rewriting some of the text of this opera-it added a freshness and relevance to today's audiences that was superb. Other productions may have some bigger names, but this production is uniformly outstanding in its entirety. Bravo!",1245628800,10,875,5.083333333333333
