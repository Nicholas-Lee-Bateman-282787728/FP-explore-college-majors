3176698,5,B00180R07W,"Production is not of the highest quality on this DVD, however...

This is a superb choice for those looking for a club-style barre workout.  It offers lots and lots of reps, good cueing for technique, plus unique and very effective exercises (especially for hips, thighs, and seat).  I found it effective because (unlike many DVDs), it works both small and large muscles from different angles. It is ballet-oriented in the sense that you work at times in plie (and sometimes in a ballet 2nd-position).  The stretches should be held longer--I don't mind hitting pause for this, but others might.  I look forward to more pure barre DVDS.",1219881600,4,635,4.897196261682243
3176699,1,B00180R07W,"This is the most cheaply made video. It may as well be a home video that was made in someone's basement. The sound quality is also terrible.  I recommend ballet inspired videos such as Tracy Effinger's ""Squeeze"",Bar Method Body, or any of the Callanetics videos, especially the two new ones.  Don't waste your money on this cheapy.",1219363200,15,331,4.7894736842105265
3176700,3,B00180R07W,"I love barre workouts.  I own a lot of DVDs devoted to this method and it's very effective, especially on the lower body.  Like another reveiwer stated, the set and the production quality is bad.  Really bad.  It looks like something a high school AV Class threw together for a class project.  The set is dark and ugly, the camera work is inadequate, cutting off body parts, and failing to show different angles to help with proper form.  The instruction, is so-so, although I felt form pointers and modifications were a bit lacking.

If you're looking for really good, thorough instruction and a little more refined production quality, check out Lotte Berk, or if you can get your hands on some Bar Method DVDs, definitely do that.  This isn't a bad DVD for a first try, there is just lots of room for improvement.",1219017600,80,815,4.611111111111111
3176701,1,B00180R07W,"This dvd provided a good burn once I figured out what on earth the instructor was doing. It is filmed very poorly, shot from the wrong angles so that you often have no idea what the instructor is doing. Secondarily, her instructions seem to have little to do with her actions. I was yelling angrily at the screen during the first 30 minutes but noticed when I finished the workout that I felt toned and trembly. A good workout but a terrible production.",1216944000,14,453,4.469879518072289
3176702,2,B00180R07W,"The only reason I gave this video even 2 stars is because the instructor clearly knows her stuff.  My legs burned after the workout, and she moves quickly from exercise to exercise without a lot of set up, which is nice.  However, there is no to very little stretching between difficult sets, and when you do get stretching it's only a few seconds. I paused the video to continue the stretching. This video has a lot of problems.  First, I believe it was produced by a child. The camera even cuts off the top of her head for some of it. There is one hilarious scene with an overhead shoulder press in which halfway through the set, the camera operator finally figures out that the viewer cannot see the instructor's arms (during an arm workout!). So, the camera sluggishly tilts up, but by the time you can view the entire exercise, it's over! For most of the sets done at the barre, the very top of the instructor's head is cut off by the camera, and her feet are not always in the entire frame. The camera was too close. On top of that flub, you get very few side views of the instructor, so you can't see which way her foot is moving and you have to rely on her instruction, which is OK, but not always enough.  If you are a beginner, you probably won't get it.

As if that is not enough to deter you from buying this, the set is HORRIBLE! There is a black floor and a mix of bright pink and white floor/can lights along the wall in the background, and you can even see an extension cord. It is very industrial, no soft colors, all very dark and not at all pleasant to look at. AND, the instructor is wearing all black against a black floor. Also, the music is the same 10 beats repeated over, and over, and over...

I wish I had never wasted my money on this video.  I am no beginner, but if you are, this is NOT for you.  There is little to no modification for beginners and you can't always see what the instructor is doing. The only reason I think I did most of the moves correctly is because they are familiar from other videos. If you want a good set of ballet inspired videos, you should try the Lotte Berk Method 4 pack. There is an entire beginner video (Basic Essentials), and on each of the 4 videos one of the instructors modifies the moves to make them easier.",1215907200,84,2276,4.228110599078341
3176703,5,B00180R07W,"I had bought this a few months ago directly from the pure barre website, guess they have major distribution now..anyway i love it and I hope she makes another one.  It is truely unique and refreshing.  Not just another fitness DVD.",1212019200,3,231,4.609756097560975
3176704,3,B00180R07W,"I bought this DVD based on a review in the Washington Post about the classes they offer. I thought buying this DVD would be a good substitute for the class but I was somewhat disappointed. Although the video is tough and does work out all parts of the body it didn't really seem to have much to do with ballet training as the video promises it does. The stretches are pretty remedial and only last for a minute.

The production on the video isn't great either and the music and atmosphere tend to get boring. I did feel my muscles for a bit after the workout and will continue trying it in hopes that it will produce some noticable results.",1211500800,13,640,4.333333333333333
3176705,5,B00180R07W,"Rave reviews on Video Fitness Forum lured me into purchasing this WONDERFUL DVD! It's tough, but can be adjusted to your own fitness level. Carrie Rezabek, the instructor has a warm, peaceful, friendly personality-with an adorable dimpled smile. The sequence worked is: warm up, biceps, back, shoulders, triceps, thighs ,short stretch, glutes, short stretch, abs, cooldown/stretch. Carrie packs a lot into the 45 minutes and doesn't waste workout time with long, drawn-out set ups (which I so appreciate!) I hear she will be coming out with another DVD and will be one of the first to order.
 I gravitate to Cathe, Tony Horton , and Amy Bento and still found this to be really challenging & fun! I have more than 100 exercise DVD's and haven't been this excited about a new instructor for years! FANTASTIC!!!!!",1209427200,11,810,4.955882352941177

3176708,4,B00180R07W,"I have all of the Burr Leonard Bar Method Dvds. I wanted to add something new to the mix, and I bought this even though really complained about the quality.

I agree. The lighting and general professional quality is totally lacking.

But it's a tough workout! It made my thighs and butt sore, and I'm pretty experienced at the bar workouts, I bought a fluidity bar on Craigslist and use it w/ the bar videos. It was a great deal for a quality bar, and I feel like I can get studio-quality workouts at home.

This DVD is worth owning if you are like me in that you want a great selection of dvds to keep you from feeling bored w/ the workouts. It's tough, it's challenging, and it was done in less than an hour. There was less stretching after each set (the way Bar Method does, sometimes maybe too much stretching, i.m.o.)

So if you can get over the bad lighting and you want a where-the-rubber-meets-the-road dvd w/ no bells and whistles, buy it.

Prime gets it there in two days if you have the membership, I always recommend Prime if you shop from Amazon a lot. Almost everything I buy is available on Prime.",1335657600,5,1112,4.352657004830918
3176709,1,B00180R07W,"The music was god awful and the lights were tacky. Simple overhead lighting would have accommodated or at least, enabled the viewer to actually see her feet. I want to know in what universe does anyone who is instructing movement wear black pants with black tights on a black floor? It makes it impossible to discern proper placement.

These points aside, the exercises are a mix of pilates, beginner barre, and Gilad's workout. None of the movement was anything new. In fact, I could have easily put these combinations together at home for free.

If you are after a good beginning ballet workout, David Howard is fantastic. If you are more advanced, New York City Ballet workout is quickly paced and has various sections so you are in control of what you want to work out.

However, if you just want a great workout, run in the other direction of this video.",1329523200,2,859,4.6381578947368425
3176710,2,B00180R07W,"I am a Pilates instructor and dancer and bought this DVD for fresh ideas for class.  There were none.  Grace Lazenby's All the Right Moves had all this and then some, and she just used a pole for balance!  This was not Ballet inspired even though she does use the word ""plie"".  I bought the DVD after reading the bad reviews thinking how bad could it be?  It was THAT bad, I wish I never bought it.  I gave two stars because I have enough experience that I didn't have to follow along with a visual as much,  as long as you pay extra attention to her verbal cues which are hard to understand,  so I ended up getting a good thigh workout.  Hmmm. maybe resell....?",1313020800,3,662,4.190476190476191
3176711,5,B00180R07W,"I've used the Pure Barre DVD three times a week for two months, and have never seen my body transform so quickly. I have been doing cardio, weights, and Pilates for years with moderate success, but nothing has given me the lean, firm, shapely thighs and muscular butt I've achieved in a very short time with Pure Barre. The upper body work is fairly light, so I wouldn't recommend relying on this DVD if your upper body is your trouble zone; but if you are a pear shape looking to trim your hip line, this workout is for you.

I do not share some other reviewers' strong reactions to the production values. The lighting and sound are far from stellar, but I can see the instructor's foot position just fine, and had no trouble following her instructions.",1310774400,5,754,4.5036496350364965
3176712,1,B00180R07W,"I have never been more frustrated with an exercise DVD in all my life. I just could not see what the instructor was doing because of the extremely poor lighting. I went through approximately 1/2 of the DVD and then shut it off. This product is garbage! The exercises themselves may be wonderful, but not to be able to see how to do the exercises.....forget it!

I bought this DVD due to the title. In between my ballet classes, I work out at home. If you are looking for a DVD for exercise or for additional help with your dancing, do NOT buy Pure Barre.

3176713,5,B00180R07W,"I live in Colorado and I have been hearing a lot about Pure Barre.  The in person classes seemed a little expensive so I wanted to try it out first at home and with the video.  I am a big workout video person.  I loved this video and the Pure barre technique.  The first time I did it my legs were shaking and I had to keep stopping.  My husband still laughs when he watches me do the video because it doesn't look like that big of a deal but when you are doing the workout it really kills.

I have done a ton of different types of workouts and I really have seen the biggest difference in my body, the fastest, with this DVD. I have always had bigger hips and a butt--and it is crazy how fast my thighs, hips and butt started to slim down.  You will see results so fast with this workout. I also like it because I am not jumping around or doing silly moves. This will kick your butt.

I read a review that said they didn't like this video as much as the Bar Method so I ordered one of the workout videos. I can see how it is the grandfather of this type of workout but Pure Barre is much harder and really takes it to another level so I disagree with the review I read.",1305849600,2,1170,3.948936170212766
3176714,3,B00180R07W,"Ballet and Barre is definitely my choice for exercise any chance I get.  This video was appealing to me for that reason.  I really liked some of the variations on moves at the barre that I haven't done before in that particular way and I definitely felt my legs shaking even though I teach Barre at a dance studio.  The biggest complaint I have is the lighting was so bad that I could not make out her legs for most of the workout.  A dark background with dark clothes was less than ideal for an instructional DVD.  Her explanations of what she was doing did help, but I am pretty sure someone new to barre would really have difficulty.  Also, the stretching was basically non-existent.  To get anything out of a stretch, you have to hold it longer than 2-3 seconds!  I am not sorry I bought this, but I am very surprised it was produced in such bad quality.  I am happy to feel my muscles shaky!  Why bother if you don't feel it?  The instructor definitely is the saving grace in this DVD",1303776000,3,989,4.291891891891892
3176715,3,B00180R07W,"I was honestly excited to try this video because there is a Pure Barre Studio in the city where I live. I wasn't exactly thrilled when I tried my first workout with this video.

Positive;

* Very effective. Many repetitions.
* Different types of movement so you work all your muscles.
* Very encouraging though out the video.
* I liked how she would say ""almost done"" when you feel your leg is about to tire.

Negative;

* I could have done without the techno music in the background.
* Very choppy production. She will go from thigh work on barre, to the floor, back to the barre, back to the floor. Why not complete the entire barre, then move to the floor for stretching? And during those times, I didn't feel there was even pause to move my barre and get onto the floor. I had to stop the DVD so I could keep up with the ""up & down"".
* I didn't like that she didn't have a few stand in's showing how to do the moves easier/harder. There is one stretch she does, THE SPLITS, and it's not like she gives an easier way of doing that for those who aren't as flexible (ie; bend one leg behind you).

I will continue to use this video because it is effective, but it is not my favorite barre workout video. And this has almost soured me wanting to go to the Pure Barre Studio here.",1302566400,,1279,4.161943319838056
3176716,5,B00180R07W,"I am totally addicted to this video.

I am an experienced weight lifter and love this as an alternative. It will make your legs shake without using weights through the use of endurance. And it never seems to get easier, because the better you get at it, the deeper you can bend the knees and the higher you can lift the heels for a greater challenge.

The only downside is it's not chaptered. Also, the first time you do it there are moments where it's hard to see what her black-socked foot is doing against the black floor, but once you do it a couple times you won't notice anymore.

Her Pershing Square 1 & 2 videos are well-chaptered, but not as complete when done individually. This Pure Barre is better because in one video you work the legs from every angle: in parallel front and back, 45 degrees front and 45 degrees back, and turned out.

Carrie Rezabek has a nice voice and a lovely personality and makes the Lotte Berk method fun!",1295827200,3,943,4.402298850574713
3176717,1,B00180R07W,I would have to agree with the production. The black clothes and black background make it so VERY hard to see what she is doing the first time through.,1293753600,,151,4.241379310344827
3176718,5,B00180R07W,"I'm also glad I ignored the negative reviews and bought this DVD. I now have all three of her workouts and find this one to be the most effective and difficult. I'm an advanced exerciser who has been a gym rat my whole life and has done it all: cardio (HIT, step and running) heavy weights,  martial arts etc. I am now focusing on these workouts that provide the body shape I want and give me the greatest results in the least amount of time.  I have never been in better shape. This is a very advanced workout and I suspect if one is a beginner or unfamiliar with these types of workouts, they are probably not assuming the correct form and pushing themselves to the point where they should be or they would be shaking to the point where they can hardly go on. Carrie's coaching is exactly as Lotte Berk (where this workout originated) would have taught it and her form and coaching is perfect. The 45 mintues feels very long when you're doing it right. The only thing I miss is the back dancing which I love. I don't get all the criticism about the set or her dark clothes, that's hardly noticeable to me. I like this workout so much, I ordered her new workouts which are being released this month and available on her website: [...]. The other workouts I do are The Bar Method (my favorite), Squeeze Stronger, Cardio Barre, Physique 57, Core Fusion, Tracy Anderson and the many good Ballet workouts that are available out there. Give it a shot, but remember to pay close attention to form, --FOCUS--, and push yourself to the end of every single set with all the strength you can muster and you will see dramatic results after a few workouts.",1283040000,11,1645,4.425742574257426

The exercises are not well explained, and you can't watch them either because the instructor is wearing black pants and what look like black tights against a dark grey, dimly-lit floor - so any nuance is absolutely lost. I just couldn't figure out what she was doing, and again, her instructions are worse than poor.

The ab work is very similar to 1980s ab work, hard on the neck, and not necessarily proven to streamline the core. I have avoided this type of ""crunch"" ab work for years because so many instructors provide better and more proven alternatives.

I wouldn't call this DVD a workout; just a random selection of exercises done in semi-darkness.

There are better ballet-inspired workouts on Amazon; buy them and skip this.",1281312000,10,839,4.805555555555555
3176720,4,B00180R07W,"I did this DVD two days ago and I'm still recovering!  This is a very challenging and thorough workout but I do have one complaint.  While I am a very big fan of the video taking the time to do stretching exercises, the stretches are only held for 2-3 seconds by the instructor.  The stretches should be held for at least 30 seconds (as reccommended by the National Strength and Conditioning Association)and I've had dance instructors make me hold stretches for a whole 60 seconds.  So I end up pausing the DVD to give me extra time to stretch and do my own stretching at the end of the workout.  Other than that I love it.  I've been doing once or twice a week for the past couple weeks and I'm already noticing a difference, especially in my legs.",1271980800,3,749,4.35251798561151
3176721,2,B00180R07W,"I, on the other hand, failed to do so and was disappointed...
It's not because it was too hard or too easy I just could not see what the hell she was doing! I mean really, black clothes and black shoes on a black floor in a dark room? Why did she bother? She should have saved her money and just made a cd explaining what each move was, because I spent most of my time struggling to figure out what she was doing. It doesn't help that I couldn't skip ahead or replay what she said/did, the dvd won't let you.

If you have done Pure Barre before, I imagine you won't have a hard time keeping up. If you're a beginner, look else where.

I am currently using Tracy Anderson MAT workout, Physique 57, and the Core Fusion series. And, to give credit to these above DVD's, I have to say that they have done a great job of changing my physique. I did not think that this DVD could surpass those, but I was pleasantly surprised and sore less than 5 minutes after working out.  I do not understand the critiques of the production or of the instructor.  Of all the above DVD's mentioned, this one is right on target.  The instructor's instructions and examples of how to do an exercise are absolutely right on the money.  I love her personality and look forward to moving this up to #1 of my DVD rotation.

Carrie is strong and flexible, and healthy bodies come in all different shapes.
Bar Method (and/or Lotte Berk) is a good precursor to this, as it explains the ""tuck"" more clearly.",1252627200,4,519,5.154761904761905
3176730,2,B00180R07W,"The splash screen just plain sucks. The music is loud and the aspect ratio off. All sadly indicative of the quality of the video.

The video jumps right into the workout with little fanfare, no ads, no introduction and Carrie Rezabek; the instructor, offers basically no information about the workout and only a few vague words about what equipment you will need. These are both good and bad things. But I was a little disappointed right from the start because of the amateur look and feel of the video. The lighting is insufficient and the sound poorly mixed. As far as `set dressing' goes - oh there are some pretty blue and pink can lights at the wall behind her, cables and all. They fail to relieve how cold and dark looking the studio is.

In the workout itself, Rezabek does a lot of cuing for ""up and hold"" but NEVER holds the move. It got pretty annoying by  the way through. She does talk non-stop through the workout, but she is no where near as obnoxious as Ellen Barrett. To be fair, some of her cues and why you are doing the moves are very good.

Rezabek's choice of an outfit makes it difficult to see what she is doing. She wears very long, flared black pants (complete with white stains on them) and a mismatched black top. And as I said previously, the lighting is low, so these things succeeded in obscuring exactly how she was moving. Tuck? What tuck? All I see is your black pants behind the bar, in shadows cast from 3 different places. (So there are lights, just in the wrong place.)

The camera zooms on the wrong things at the right time, and the right things are OUT OF FOCUS when they bother. The editing is choppy and the 'zoom' portions happen too fast to be of use anyway. How on earth the movie production company (who shall remain nameless) let this go out like this with their name on it is beyond me. The instructor will be on a part when the count is fast, but the video will cut to a blurry zoom of her moving slowly. Or the instruction will be ""keep your foot flexed"" and the blurry zoom is on her foot pointed. This sort of thing happens a lot in this video. And to give a great example of the level of expert cinematography: at one point it looks like the camera nearly gets dropped, home movie style. I kid you not.

The sound is bad, bad, bad and I am not talking about the crappy canned music. What I mean is that sometimes Rezabek's voice fades out and other times it booms out way too loud. For about the second half on, the music is too loud over all, making it difficult to hear her. This gets worse as the workout progresses.

Rezabek does not look like a dancer to me. There is quite a bit of extra sand in the bottom of the hour glass and on other parts, too. On the one hand, she looks okay; on the other hand, I aspire to be in above average shape, so I found this less than inspirational.

Finally, for as disappointed as I am with the production values of this video, the deal killer is that the workout itself is not significantly different than The Lotte Berk Method (well duh - it is another hybrid) or The Bar Method Body (however both of those DVDs have far, far superiour production, lighting, sound, music and sets). Pure Barre presents some work with hand weights (very little for upper body), work at the bar (extremely similar to The Bar Method Designer Sculpting) and some mat work (pretty much generic leg lifts and ab work) and basically no stretching. So ultimately, absolutely nothing about this workout stands out or makes it better. I've pointed out several examples of what makes it inferior but will add this: Rezabek's planks were not what I am used to - a straight fluid line from the top of the head to the feet. Hers were bent and awkward.

Is this a tough workout? Yes. But again, The Lotte Berk Method or The Bar Method DVDs are butt kicking workouts that are far more effective because you can see what the instructors are doing and hear what they are saying.",1251504000,8,3939,4.348299319727891

(I'm afraid I will be like her if I use this DVD.)  She also wears a pair of flared pants and it is difficult to follow her turn out or her leg positions.  The production is also terrible.

The 45 minute tape is challenging and effective. It does not include the round and flat back series. The only teeny tiny criticism is that the camera does not show the feet placement and with her black leotards on a dark background sometimes the positioning can get lost but she provides plenty of cues and instruction without being boring or pedantic. Her homespun Midwestern accent is a plus as is her broad smile and attitude. Of the three tapes she has put out this original one is still my favorite.

Although I agree with other reviewers about the poor production quality, overall I enjoy using this DVD in rotation with my others. It is a nononsense workout that moves quickly and is effective.",1247097600,4,870,4.686274509803922

You will feel it most in your lower body, but every muscle in your body is addressed.  This video deals with very small controlled movements - which might take some people a while to master.  If you are unfamiliar with barre type workouts, this probably isn't a good first choice.  The negative reviews are right when they say the production value leaves a bit to be desired, but if you are already familiar with Pilates and barre type workouts it isn't such a big deal. Also, there are two new Pure Barre workout videos which were made using a different production company.  I haven't tried these yet, but you can be sure I'll be ordering them. So if you're put off by the negative reviews maybe wait a while to see if the newer videos have better reviews.  Bottom line, if you're new to Barre or exercising you should probably look else where first.

After reading several reviews citing poor production/instruction, I was nervous about wasting my $ again since I just purchased and was very unimpressed with the Tracy Anderson DVD. Luckily, I liked this one.

The instructor is likable- she gives good direction, form pointers, seems happy (but not annoyingly so). It's a well rounded workout of arms, legs using the barre/mat, and abs. There's some stretching between sections. Overall, the exercises seem effective, especially when you remember correct form when doing them (seems obvious but really makes a difference).

Cons: there's no title menu. Also, she's wearing a black outfit against a dark background so you can't really see what her legs doing, if her toes are pointed, etc. They do some closeups but it's annoying to have to wait for them.

Any repetitive movement not done correctly can cause pain.  My hamstrings and knees hurt more now than ever after many trys at this routine.  My pilates teacher and massage therapist have told me to stop immediately so i do not hurt myself further.  The only reason i give this one star is that its better than doing nothing at all.

My butt has never been so lifted and my thighs have NEVER been this thin. Yes, the camera angles and editing can be annoying but I'll take a compromise in that regard to look as good as I am doing pure barre.  If you want an amazing body get this dvd, you won't regret it.

Edited to add that I have been doing pure barre at least three times a week for over six months and my body is still changing for the better.

Update:  I've continued to work out to this dvd along with the two most recent Pure Barre dvds and I have never been so well proportioned in my entire life.

My legs were trembling throughout the thigh work. The seat exercises are relentless. She starts you off at the bar and then goes down for floor work. Seriously, I kept thinking, ""This is Super Callanetics on steroids!""

I really liked the instructor, Carrie. She was tough and encouraging at the same time. My only gripe is that the stretching didn't last longer. I can't believe I waited so long to give this a try.

3176739,3,B00180R07W,"I purchased this video on recommendation from a fellow heath enthusiast.  I was very excited to start working on my problem areas and have done so 3 times a week for the past month.

I have to say the editing and production quality are really bad.  The previous poster who wrote that it looks like a child's work was pretty right on except one thing - my kids would have done a better job as they have both created much better videos than this for you tube.

The colors of the set were dark and dingy - there are shadows on her face when she works with the dumbbells - the close up shots are of completely different moves than what she's actually working on, for instance 1) when she pumps up and down with dumbbells without a pause, it shows a close-up pumping with a pause 2) the close up of lifting the leg at 7 o'clock with a pointed toe shows a flexed foot 3) one session gets cut off with Carrie grimacing, another session gets cut off too early 4) a tilting pelvis shoes a close up of knees pushing back at a completely different speed; there are far more than this that I can't remember off the top of my head - it is like the person editing it had no clue about the workouts AT ALL.  You would think that this production company should have at least been interested in the workout enough to understand the moves to match the close-ups to what she's actually doing.  The one thing that seems in sync is the beat of the music to the moves.

That said, I continue to do this workout because it STILL burns, so I know something's working!  I have new definition in my arms and I know my legs are following soon.  I do wish this was geared a bit more for a beginner as the seat work is a killer and it would have been less of a challenge if there was more changing and stretching in between the moves, that is the one thing that gets me.  You don't stretch out the side of your seat before going to the next side I have to stop and stretch on my own.  Other than some extra stretching I find this a very thorough workout and recommend it to anyone who can handle getting through the sappy production.

I really hope Carrie reproduces this with a more reputable production company and a reconfigured work-out.  This could really take off as the newest and greatest workout!",1238803200,5,2276,4.2407407407407405

This is a superb choice for those looking for a club-style barre workout.

I found it effective because (unlike many DVDs), it works both small and large muscles from different angles.

My legs burned after the workout, and she moves quickly from exercise to exercise without a lot of set up, which is nice.  However, there is no to very little stretching between difficult sets, and when you do get stretching it's only a few seconds. I paused the video to continue the stretching. This video has a lot of problems.  First, I believe it was produced by a child. The camera even cuts off the top of her head for some of it. There is one hilarious scene with an overhead shoulder press in which halfway through the set, the camera operator finally figures out that the viewer cannot see the instructor's arms (during an arm workout!). So, the camera sluggishly tilts up, but by the time you can view the entire exercise, it's over! For most of the sets done at the barre, the very top of the instructor's head is cut off by the camera, and her feet are not always in the entire frame. The camera was too close. On top of that flub, you get very few side views of the instructor, so you can't see which way her foot is moving and you have to rely on her instruction, which is OK, but not always enough.  If you are a beginner, you probably won't get it.

As if that is not enough to deter you from buying this, the set is HORRIBLE! There is a black floor and a mix of bright pink and white floor/can lights along the wall in the background, and you can even see an extension cord. It is very industrial, no soft colors, all very dark and not at all pleasant to look at. AND, the instructor is wearing all black against a black floor. Also, the music is the same 10 beats repeated over, and over, and over...

I wish I had never wasted my money on this video.  I am no beginner, but if you are, this is NOT for you.  There is little to no modification for beginners and you can't always see what the instructor is doing. The only reason I think I did most of the moves correctly is because they are familiar from other videos. If you want a good set of ballet inspired videos, you should try the Lotte Berk Method 4 pack. There is an entire beginner video (Basic Essentials), and on each of the 4 videos one of the instructors modifies the moves to make them easier.",1215907200,84,2276,4.228110599078341

But it's a tough workout! It made my thighs and butt sore, and I'm pretty experienced at the bar workouts, I bought a fluidity bar on Craigslist and use it w/ the bar videos. It was a great deal for a quality bar, and I feel like I can get studio-quality workouts at home.

This DVD is worth owning if you are like me in that you want a great selection of dvds to keep you from feeling bored w/ the workouts. It's tough, it's challenging, and it was done in less than an hour. There was less stretching after each set (the way Bar Method does, sometimes maybe too much stretching, i.m.o.)

These points aside, the exercises are a mix of pilates, beginner barre, and Gilad's workout. None of the movement was anything new. In fact, I could have easily put these combinations together at home for free.

If you are after a good beginning ballet workout, David Howard is fantastic. If you are more advanced, New York City Ballet workout is quickly paced and has various sections so you are in control of what you want to work out.

My husband still laughs when he watches me do the video because it doesn't look like that big of a deal but when you are doing the workout it really kills.

I have done a ton of different types of workouts and I really have seen the biggest difference in my body, the fastest, with this DVD. I have always had bigger hips and a butt--and it is crazy how fast my thighs, hips and butt started to slim down.  You will see results so fast with this workout.

* Very encouraging though out the video.
* I liked how she would say ""almost done"" when you feel your leg is about to tire.

Negative;

And during those times, I didn't feel there was even pause to move my barre and get onto the floor. I had to stop the DVD so I could keep up with the ""up & down"".
* I didn't like that she didn't have a few stand in's showing how to do the moves easier/harder. There is one stretch she does, THE SPLITS, and it's not like she gives an easier way of doing that for those who aren't as flexible (ie; bend one leg behind you).

I will continue to use this video because it is effective, but it is not my favorite barre workout video. And this has almost soured me wanting to go to the Pure Barre Studio here.",1302566400,,1279,4.161943319838056
3411213,5,B00180R07W,"I am totally addicted to this video.

I am an experienced weight lifter and love this as an alternative. It will make your legs shake without using weights through the use of endurance. And it never seems to get easier, because the better you get at it, the deeper you can bend the knees and the higher you can lift the heels for a greater challenge.

The only downside is it's not chaptered. Also, the first time you do it there are moments where it's hard to see what her black-socked foot is doing against the black floor, but once you do it a couple times you won't notice anymore.

Her Pershing Square 1 & 2 videos are well-chaptered, but not as complete when done individually. This Pure Barre is better because in one video you work the legs from every angle: in parallel front and back, 45 degrees front and 45 degrees back, and turned out.

I have never been in better shape. This is a very advanced workout and I suspect if one is a beginner or unfamiliar with these types of workouts, they are probably not assuming the correct form and pushing themselves to the point where they should be or they would be shaking to the point where they can hardly go on. Carrie's coaching is exactly as Lotte Berk (where this workout originated) would have taught it and her form and coaching is perfect. The 45 mintues feels very long when you're doing it right. The only thing I miss is the back dancing which I love. I don't get all the criticism about the set or her dark clothes, that's hardly noticeable to me. I like this workout so much, I ordered her new workouts which are being released this month and available on her website: [...]. The other workouts I do are The Bar Method (my favorite), Squeeze Stronger, Cardio Barre, Physique 57, Core Fusion, Tracy Anderson and the many good Ballet workouts that are available out there.

I just couldn't figure out what she was doing, and again, her instructions are worse than poor.

The ab work is very similar to 1980s ab work, hard on the neck, and not necessarily proven to streamline the core. I have avoided this type of ""crunch"" ab work for years because so many instructors provide better and more proven alternatives.

I wouldn't call this DVD a workout; just a random selection of exercises done in semi-darkness.

While I am a very big fan of the video taking the time to do stretching exercises, the stretches are only held for 2-3 seconds by the instructor.  The stretches should be held for at least 30 seconds (as reccommended by the National Strength and Conditioning Association)and I've had dance instructors make me hold stretches for a whole 60 seconds.  So I end up pausing the DVD to give me extra time to stretch and do my own stretching at the end of the workout.  Other than that I love it.  I've been doing once or twice a week for the past couple weeks and I'm already noticing a difference, especially in my legs.",1271980800,3,749,4.35251798561151

It's not because it was too hard or too easy I just could not see what the hell she was doing! I mean really, black clothes and black shoes on a black floor in a dark room? Why did she bother? She should have saved her money and just made a cd explaining what each move was, because I spent most of my time struggling to figure out what she was doing. It doesn't help that I couldn't skip ahead or replay what she said/did, the dvd won't let you.

I am currently using Tracy Anderson MAT workout, Physique 57, and the Core Fusion series. And, to give credit to these above DVD's, I have to say that they have done a great job of changing my physique. I did not think that this DVD could surpass those, but I was pleasantly surprised and sore less than 5 minutes after working out.  I do not understand the critiques of the production or of the instructor.  Of all the above DVD's mentioned, this one is right on target.  The instructor's instructions and examples of how to do an exercise are absolutely right on the money.  I love her personality and look forward to moving this up to #1 of my DVD rotation.

For others who don't like the way the instructor looks, there are hundreds of cookie-cutter, skinny instructors out there to choose from.  Carrie is strong and flexible, and healthy bodies come in all different shapes.
Bar Method (and/or Lotte Berk) is a good precursor to this, as it explains the ""tuck"" more clearly.",1252627200,4,519,5.154761904761905
3411227,2,B00180R07W,"The splash screen just plain sucks. The music is loud and the aspect ratio off. All sadly indicative of the quality of the video.

The video jumps right into the workout with little fanfare, no ads, no introduction and Carrie Rezabek; the instructor, offers basically no information about the workout and only a few vague words about what equipment you will need. These are both good and bad things. But I was a little disappointed right from the start because of the amateur look and feel of the video. The lighting is insufficient and the sound poorly mixed. As far as `set dressing' goes - oh there are some pretty blue and pink can lights at the wall behind her, cables and all. They fail to relieve how cold and dark looking the studio is.

In the workout itself, Rezabek does a lot of cuing for ""up and hold"" but NEVER holds the move. It got pretty annoying by  the way through. She does talk non-stop through the workout, but she is no where near as obnoxious as Ellen Barrett. To be fair, some of her cues and why you are doing the moves are very good.

Rezabek's choice of an outfit makes it difficult to see what she is doing. She wears very long, flared black pants (complete with white stains on them) and a mismatched black top. And as I said previously, the lighting is low, so these things succeeded in obscuring exactly how she was moving. Tuck? What tuck? All I see is your black pants behind the bar, in shadows cast from 3 different places. (So there are lights, just in the wrong place.)

The camera zooms on the wrong things at the right time, and the right things are OUT OF FOCUS when they bother. The editing is choppy and the 'zoom' portions happen too fast to be of use anyway. How on earth the movie production company (who shall remain nameless) let this go out like this with their name on it is beyond me. The instructor will be on a part when the count is fast, but the video will cut to a blurry zoom of her moving slowly. Or the instruction will be ""keep your foot flexed"" and the blurry zoom is on her foot pointed. This sort of thing happens a lot in this video. And to give a great example of the level of expert cinematography: at one point it looks like the camera nearly gets dropped, home movie style. I kid you not.

The sound is bad, bad, bad and I am not talking about the crappy canned music. What I mean is that sometimes Rezabek's voice fades out and other times it booms out way too loud. For about the second half on, the music is too loud over all, making it difficult to hear her. This gets worse as the workout progresses.

Rezabek does not look like a dancer to me. There is quite a bit of extra sand in the bottom of the hour glass and on other parts, too. On the one hand, she looks okay; on the other hand, I aspire to be in above average shape, so I found this less than inspirational.

Finally, for as disappointed as I am with the production values of this video, the deal killer is that the workout itself is not significantly different than The Lotte Berk Method (well duh - it is another hybrid) or The Bar Method Body (however both of those DVDs have far, far superiour production, lighting, sound, music and sets). Pure Barre presents some work with hand weights (very little for upper body), work at the bar (extremely similar to The Bar Method Designer Sculpting) and some mat work (pretty much generic leg lifts and ab work) and basically no stretching. So ultimately, absolutely nothing about this workout stands out or makes it better. I've pointed out several examples of what makes it inferior but will add this: Rezabek's planks were not what I am used to - a straight fluid line from the top of the head to the feet. Hers were bent and awkward.

Is this a tough workout? Yes. But again, The Lotte Berk Method or The Bar Method DVDs are butt kicking workouts that are far more effective because you can see what the instructors are doing and hear what they are saying.",1251504000,8,3939,4.348299319727891

The only teeny tiny criticism is that the camera does not show the feet placement and with her black leotards on a dark background sometimes the positioning can get lost but she provides plenty of cues and instruction without being boring or pedantic. Her homespun Midwestern accent is a plus as is her broad smile and attitude. Of the three tapes she has put out this original one is still my favorite.

You will feel it most in your lower body, but every muscle in your body is addressed.  This video deals with very small controlled movements - which might take some people a while to master.  If you are unfamiliar with barre type workouts, this probably isn't a good first choice.  The negative reviews are right when they say the production value leaves a bit to be desired, but if you are already familiar with Pilates and barre type workouts it isn't such a big deal. Also, there are two new Pure Barre workout videos which were made using a different production company.  I haven't tried these yet, but you can be sure I'll be ordering them. So if you're put off by the negative reviews maybe wait a while to see if the newer videos have better reviews.

Luckily, I liked this one.

The instructor is likable- she gives good direction, form pointers, seems happy (but not annoyingly so). It's a well rounded workout of arms, legs using the barre/mat, and abs. There's some stretching between sections. Overall, the exercises seem effective, especially when you remember correct form when doing them (seems obvious but really makes a difference).

Cons: there's no title menu. Also, she's wearing a black outfit against a dark background so you can't really see what her legs doing, if her toes are pointed, etc. They do some closeups but it's annoying to have to wait for them.

Any repetitive movement not done correctly can cause pain.  My hamstrings and knees hurt more now than ever after many trys at this routine.

Seriously, I kept thinking, ""This is Super Callanetics on steroids!""

3411236,3,B00180R07W,"I purchased this video on recommendation from a fellow heath enthusiast.  I was very excited to start working on my problem areas and have done so 3 times a week for the past month.

I have to say the editing and production quality are really bad.  The previous poster who wrote that it looks like a child's work was pretty right on except one thing - my kids would have done a better job as they have both created much better videos than this for you tube.

The colors of the set were dark and dingy - there are shadows on her face when she works with the dumbbells - the close up shots are of completely different moves than what she's actually working on, for instance 1) when she pumps up and down with dumbbells without a pause, it shows a close-up pumping with a pause 2) the close up of lifting the leg at 7 o'clock with a pointed toe shows a flexed foot 3) one session gets cut off with Carrie grimacing, another session gets cut off too early 4) a tilting pelvis shoes a close up of knees pushing back at a completely different speed; there are far more than this that I can't remember off the top of my head - it is like the person editing it had no clue about the workouts AT ALL.  You would think that this production company should have at least been interested in the workout enough to understand the moves to match the close-ups to what she's actually doing.  The one thing that seems in sync is the beat of the music to the moves.

That said, I continue to do this workout because it STILL burns, so I know something's working!  I have new definition in my arms and I know my legs are following soon.  I do wish this was geared a bit more for a beginner as the seat work is a killer and it would have been less of a challenge if there was more changing and stretching in between the moves, that is the one thing that gets me.  You don't stretch out the side of your seat before going to the next side I have to stop and stretch on my own.  Other than some extra stretching I find this a very thorough workout and recommend it to anyone who can handle getting through the sappy production.

I really hope Carrie reproduces this with a more reputable production company and a reconfigured work-out.  This could really take off as the newest and greatest workout!",1238803200,5,2276,4.2407407407407405

Carrie is a wonderful, non annoying instructor, and she puts you through your paces without wasting a minute. There is no filler in this workout. I am happy with my results, and it is challenging but fun at the same time. Honestly, this is my favorite video. In my opinion exercise is exercise,and nothing is going to make is painless or wildly enjoyable for me, so effectiveness is my sole motivator. Give this one a try, and don't judge it for things that really will not change your outcome if you put the work in as suggested.",1480204800,,1032,4.243654822335025
8268199,5,B00180R07W,"I love Carrie and the Pure Barre Method. She's personable, knowledgeable, effective, and sober (The overgrown adolescent cheerleader ambiance of Physique 57  et sim. quickly get on my nerves; Suzanne Bowen leaves me feeling completely unchallenged; Exhale's Fred DeVito and Elisabeth Halfpapp put me to sleep; and I've sampled countless others on youtube, deciding not to purchase for bad form, grating personality, and worse). Quite frankly I'm mystified by commenters who suggest that the set is unattractive, or the camera work inadequate, or the workout as lacking in cohesion. When I pop a workout DVD in my machine, I expect to get a workout, not a highly polished Hollywood extravaganza. I am very glad to have this early effort of Carrie's in my barre DVD rotation now. The workout is a solid Barre workout which left all the muscles of this fairly fit body shaking.",1430524800,3,874,5.027586206896552
8268200,2,B00180R07W,"I've done Cardio Barre and Studio Barre and the Pure Barre contained some familiar moves. What I didn't care for is that she goes so slowly, the set is boring with no options for modifications, sometimes you can't see clearly what she is doing, the music is a generic beat that you cant really get into or count phrases. I did the whole thing through once then got frustrated. This isn't a good video for beginners. Even though she goes slowly, in a way, there isn't good visibility to see what she is doing if you aren't already familiar with the moves.",1419638400,,554,4.4411764705882355
8268201,5,B00180R07W,"Have been doing Pure Barre for 1 + years and I love this very first DVD of Carrie's.  You need to have taken some classes so you know the correct form and position before taking this DVD on.  Once you know you are doing the positions in the correct form this is a killer workout.  I sweat up a storm doing this and I must say I am able to keep a size 0-2 no problem.  I lost 2 1 /2 inches around each thigh and my stomach muscles are rock hard.  I have more defined arms and I'm almost 50. I am toned all over and people ask if I am a dancer all the time.  I look better now than I did in my 20's,30's and 40's.
I love PureBarre.  Thanks Carrie for your inspiration.  If anyone has followed Carrie through the years she looks amazing now after having three little ones two of which are twins.  This DVD is especially an inspiration because it gives a ""benchmark"" with her figure then and you should understand that she was in the process of getting in better shape.  Just like you and me.  She is real.  You should see her now!  This is proof that you can transform yourself to look even more amazing if you stick with it.  Carrie LOOKS AMAZING!  You can do it in less time with PureBarre.  You don't have to spend an hour each day to get the results.  Check out her PureBarre website for all her new DVD's.  The new Studio Series 1,2.3.4 are killers.  Hold onto your seat belts! I am not paid to say these things nor do I go to the classes anymore I do them all from home.  I am just an enthusiastic purebarre diehard fan!  You get results quick and that's why I like it so much and I feel good!",1418515200,2,1596,4.035143769968051
8268202,2,B00180R07W,"I wish I would have read these reviews because it seems the later DVDs don't get better. I purchased Pure Barre Studio Series 3 & 4 after several months of live classes in my area & I didn't expect the DVDs to be on the same level but they're really a let down. Carrie is in tremendous shape and is obviously very talented and gifted to be the force behind this company, but unfortunately, she is not a fitness teacher. Her sleepy soft voice quality is not cut out for taking the lead track in an instructional DVD. The teachers in live class are so much more direct, instructive and motivating and any one of them would have been more effective as the workout tone setter in these DVDs.

It also takes some adjustment to the fact that the music is not the peppy current tunes blared through class but some lame, almost irritating staccato in the background. I'm sure that has to do with copyright issues for publication but there had to be better stock music out there to better fit what's needed in this workout :(",1408924800,,1016,4.404255319148936

8268204,5,B00180R07W,"This DVD has been in my regular rotation for several years (which should say something). Long enough that I can relate to every mediocre-to-bad review that I see here.

The production quality sucks. So what? If I wanted nice production value I'd watch Core Fusion and die of boredom.

The music belongs in a bad porno. Honestly, it kind propels me to get the workout over with and not dawdle.

The camera angle frequently doesn't show important things like hip, leg & foot positioning. Which is why you should really get a good grasp of basic barre theory from a Bar Method DVD or Lotte Berk.

Carrie isn't so incredibly slender and sleek that I long for her physique. So what? I bet she is in way better shape than I am, evidenced by her businesslike, perky commentary while I sweat and whine.

I am in full agreement that if you don't already have an in-depth grasp of barre workouts and the body mechanics you need, this workout could seem easy and like a waste of time. If it's not hard as hell, you're not doing it right. Try, try again.

Now that I've addressed all of the gripes, here's why this is my all-time favorite barre workout. It crams everything necessary to have a RAD body into under 45 minutes. It goes by at a screaming pace, but that's why I love it. I don't want to spend all day working out. That's why I pop in a DVD instead of driving to the gym. My favorite part is the standing glute work, it's like standing pretzel and it's the best barre glute set I've ever done. When I do this workout regularly, I get envious glares from the ladies and blatant ogling from the menfolk. I'm going to reiterate: if it's not hard as hell, you're not doing it right. Not for beginners, but if you love barre you should try it. All you need is a sturdy chair or support and 1-3 lb hand weights.",1367712000,18,1805,4.325443786982248

8268207,1,B00180R07W,"I have done ballet workouts before and I enjoy them.  I could not even finish this one.  The production was terrible and the instructor did not visibly appear toned which was uninspiring for me personally. My goal is to maintain a lean, toned physique. If the workout did not help the instructor to achieve that then it doesn't inspire confidence that it would do so for myself.",1365033600,2,378,4.626865671641791
