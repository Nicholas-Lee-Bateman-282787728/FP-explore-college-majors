If you are looking for great music and fantastic voices, this is the opera for you. But even despite the foregoing, I had a hard time to sit through it.

The libretto is really from hunger and has practically nothing to do with Shakespeares Othello and the contemporary costumes and drab production offer nothing to enliven the tedium. Maybe conventional, gorgeous costumes and sets might have made a difference.

One just wonders why Rossini bothered to waste his tremendous talent and music on so little to go on and why incredible singers like Cecilia Bartoli, John Osborn, Javier Camarena - the latter I have heard here for the first time in full glory - et al in superb form, were willing to participate in this none-entity. No wonder this opera is given so infrequently.

Too bad Rossini was not aware of Verdis Otello - an historical impossibility - so he could have saved a great effort wasted on an outrageously awful libretto.

P.S. - I had a hard time to ""rate"" the opera. Rossini's music and especially the singing deserve clearly 5 stars but the total opera and this particular production barely rate 1 star.",1405728000,4,1155,4.72636815920398
6255552,5,B00IAD18FK,"A tremendously exciting, raw-edged production of this brilliant masterpiece by Rossini. The producers Leiser and Cauriier of Zurich Opera have made a taunt, rapidly evolving drama with a breath-taking and frighteningly tense tragic ending of Shakespeare magnificent play. The stark sets and unadorned stage bring this 1960's setting to be barren but most effective as the background to the inevitable death dealing climax.
Rossini's librettist Francesco Berio wrote the script from both the Shakespeare play as well as other versions of the Otello story. For the 1816 Italian audience his version would follow the recent trend for ""unhappy endings"" in opera. Berio was a nobleman and highly literate as well as an amateur musician and was familiar with the conventions of the then opera seria. He too was mindful to use the ""unities"" prescribed for drama by Aristotle as far as action, place and time are concerned. Thus the action in the opera all occurs within 48 hours and involves less than eight characters.
In Shakespeare's play there are three main characters  Othello, Desdemona and Iago. In the Rossini opera Otello is somewhat underdeveloped, Iago is still enigmatic but Desdemona is fully fleshed out and becomes more sympathetic than even in the play.
The first act of the opera is formed from the usual tools of Italian style opera of the time in that it has jealousy, battling rivals, an incriminating letter gone astray (no handkerchief here), betrayals, unhappy father, love besotted daughter etc. so that it is far from the Shakespeare model. It is also the least effective of the three acts in the opera. By the end of Act 2 the real tragedy begins and here the music and vocal score are, with the great third act, among the most effective ever penned by Rossini (he was 24).
The cast in this production is superb; Bartoli  can still do it. In fact she does it with breathtaking virtuosity. Her coloratura shows pinpoint accuracy though sometimes tempi are stretched. Her roulades and melisma passage work are thrilling and they convey the deeply tragic nature they describe. There is no love duet nor happy, light showpiece. Desdemona from the very beginning  is under suspicion by her husband Otello, father Elmiro and lover Rodrigo. She has only one showpiece aria and that is the willow song after the gondolier's plaintive lines ""Nessun maggior dolore..."" The willow song is accompanied by a wind-up record player and is grippingly tragic: Bartoli's best and Rossini's best.
The male singers are all excellent in this recording. John Osborn has a stentorian tenor voice with baritone overtones. His music is rather underdeveloped in characterizing him but what he does with it fills in the composers gaps. He is black and the ""race card"" appears often in the opera. Desdemona's father is horrified that his daughter has taken up with a black. When after being exiled by the Doge, Otello takes refuge in a migrants dive/bar and hears snatches of ""black"" music. M. Osborn climaxes the opera with superb acting and singing when he kills himself after having killed Desdemona and learning of Iago's deceit.
The Rodrigo (son of the Doge in this opera) of Javier Camarena has the best music of any of the soloists and is a very gifted singer. He exploits the score and provides great moments of right-on bel canto; he had the loudest applause after his show piece aria.
The Iago of Edgardo Rocha was another great creation of characterization. He has a gleaming voice that can be sweet and mocking at the same time. His final duet with Otello as he twists him into hating her and himself is a high point in the opera. He is laughing as he is destroying Otello faith in and love for Desdemona. Recently in Paris opera he has sung Rodrigo to great acclaim.
Elmiro is the man to hate in this opera. And a nasty is how the excellent Peter Kalman plays him; a domineering father, a patrician, a racist, a bigot and a manipulator. But Kalman  does it all very well.
This is a great album. It takes several listenings and viewings to appreciate how very well done this project is, but it is well worth the effort. Highly recommended.",1403568000,16,4143,4.855728429985856
6255553,5,B00IAD18FK,"Finally we have Rossini's Otello to cherish. This rarely performed, magnificent opera by Rossini has been much maligned in the years since it was banished from the opera house by Verdi's masterpiece. These are very different operas, but Rossini's version does not deserve to be confined to oblivion. It deserves to heard, and seen, being performed by truly outstanding singers who can act even as they are vocally enchanting. This production meets that objective splendidly. Hooray for Cecilia Bartoli, John Osborn and their companions. Thank you, Zurich, for resurrecting this great work and breathing into it such glorious light.",1401494400,7,631,5.383838383838384
6255554,4,B00IAD18FK,"Vocally  scrumptious but visually quite boring, the stage belongs to the three tenors (what a coincidence) and only peripherally to Santa Cecilia (thank God).  Every time I see her I think of an operatic avatar of Elena Bonham-Carter as Belle Malfoy in the Harry Potter movies. Maria Malibran?  Not by a long shot. Personally, I  think productions like this one create an aporic (related to oxymoronic) distance between the music, the voices and the modern staging. The Zurich Opera seems quite fond of ""modern"" productions.  Spectacle is needed, not a chorus in penguin suits. There is nothing to watch, so go back to the computer and listen. And once you do, you will discover the treasure in the coffer: the voices, which are, as the French say, hors de concours. Extremely beautiful singing.",1400716800,8,795,4.947368421052632
6255555,5,B00IAD18FK,"This new disc from the Zurich Opera presents just about as thoughtful and coherent account of Rossini's Otello as one could hope for.  This isn't the first time the company has made something of a splash with the bel canto repertory.  Some will remember their CD release, a few years back, of Bellini's Norma, also featuring Bartoli. That set got very mixed reviews, and those who hated that will probably hate this too, no doubt before they even watch it.  But for those not initiated in the trench warfare that music loving often attracts, this disc will be most welcome. The world class cast, led by Cecilia Bartoli and tenor John Osborn, are (mostly) young, committed and talented.  They deliver, here, an intense performance that makes a very strong case for this neglected opera.

Although in the past I've never been entirely sold by Ms. Bartoli's singing, I was moved by her performance on this disc, as well as her aforementioned Norma.  So I guess I'm starting to be intrigued. In her Act II duet with Terzetto with Otello and Rodrigo, and her duet with Otello, she is very persuasive indeed. Her electrifying rendition of the Willow Song in Act III will break your heart and make you forget Verdi, if only for a few minutes. . Too often, her voice sounds punchy, and in florid passages, she sometimes achieves rhythmic clarity at the expense of tonal clarity.  Her singing line is always tender, but often bordering on brittle, and here, there's some of that, especially in the first Act.  But the fact is, Desdemona doesn't have a great many big numbers all by herself.  In the title role, Osborn is a little stiff at first, but starting in the second act, he shows a dramatic concentration that matches his florid and incredibly accomplished vocal line.  Still, dramatically, he's rather monochrome, but this is Rossini's, not Verdi's Otello, and sometimes the music is more well-behaved than the dramatic situation it sets.  Equally entertaining are tenors Javier Camarena as Rodrigo, Otello's rival for Desdemona's affections, and Edgardo Rocha as Jago.  Orchestra La Scintilla, the house band for the Zurich Opera, conducted with vigor and finesse by Muhai Tang, play expertly on period instruments or copies, and demonstrate persuasively that Rossini's orchestra was more than just a ""big guitar"", as Wagner supposedly intimated.

Because, at least during the first two acts, Rossini's opera bears scant resemblance to Shakespeare, and because it was effectively and completely replaced in the repertory by Verdi's opera on the same subject, Rossini's Otello comes to us today as something of an oddity.  Composed relatively early in Rossini's career (in 1816, Rossini was 24), Otello was an enormously popular opera throughout the 19th century.  Between it's premier in 1816 and the late 1870s, it was performed repeatedly from St. Petersburg to Mexico City and most stops in between.  After the premier of Verdi's Otello in 1887, however, Rossini's Moor disappeared altogether for over a century.  In 1978, Philips released a landmark audio recording under conductor Jesus Lopez Coboz, featuring a cast led by Jose Carreras and Frederica von Stade, which has since attained a semi-legendary status.

Successful as that album was and continues to be (although Philips doesn't really exist anymore, and the recording appears to be officially OOP, copies are not that hard to find), Otello is still rarely offered on stage.  I think there are a number of reasons for this.  For one thing, it requires 3 tenors capable of sustaining extremely florid and technically difficult musical lines, who can sound differently enough from each other to distinguish them in the ensemble music that dominates this work.  More abstractly, as innovative as Rossini's Otello was (and it was enormously innovative for its time), it belongs to an era where theatrical and musical conventions obtained, which have since been entirely replaced, particularly the conventions of Italian opera that were shaped during the second half of the 19th century by Verdi and, later, by Puccini and the masters of verismo.

But the opera world, and the world of classical music in general, has been showing signs of restlessness for over 30 years, with the advent of ""historically informed performance"" practice (""HIP"" for short), and a broad renewal of interest in ""early"" music, which generally means anything before Beethoven, and the music and reputation of Rossini has benefitted from this trend enormously.  The most important manifestation of this trend is the Rossini festival in Pesaro, Italy that has been gaining steam since the early 1980s, and by now has become a go-to summer destination for opera lovers.  I don't really know the exact age of the individual singers in this production, but i don't think I'd be wrong in saying that most of them are young enough to have grown up in the midst of this sea-change in classical music.  Thus, what may appear to be a novelty to audiences more used to Verdi and Wagner, seems to come naturally to this group.

So, basta!  This is an extremely entraining revival of an unjustly neglected opera.  Whether you know Rossini's serious side, or are just curious, this is a great place to start.  Congratulations to the Zurich Opera and everyone involved in making this available to an international audience.",1399420800,54,5345,5.0420454545454545
8640385,5,B00IAD18FK,"I never cease to be amazed at how ignorant folk are. Rossinis opera is not based on Shakespeares play. Nor did Shakespeare invent the tale of the Moor. The story of Otello was a tale that circulated Italy in several different versions. Shakespeare based his play on one, and Rossini based his on another. The two versions have a common overall plot, but differ in important central details. Shakespeares drama is driven by a missing handkerchief of great symbolic significance to Otello. Rossinis opera is driven by a love letter from Rodrigo to Desdemona, intercepted by Jago. Shakespeares Othello is driven by implacable jealousy and possessiveness. Rossinis Otello is drive by outrage at Desdemonas perfidy and betrayal. In Shakespeare, Desdemona is openly Othellos wife. In Rossini, the marriage has taken place in secret. Shakespeares Othello murders his innocent Desdemona in Cyprus. Rossinis Otello murders her in Venice.

It is also pointless to attempt to compare Verdis Otello with Rossinis. Verdis opera, which is based on Shakespeares play, is a romantic drama. Rossinis Otello is a bel canto tragedy. They differ like chalk and cheese. But both are masterpieces of their respective genres.

This production is masterly. The modernization of the setting works well and makes the intensity of the tragedy less remote and more immediate to modern audiences. The singing is excellent. The young Bartoli is in exceptionally good voice and in full control of the difficult coloratura. Her vibrato, disturbingly pronounced in later life, is here firmly controlled and effective. The three tenors all give very good performances. Javier Camarenas performance as Rodrigo is especially fine and he executes this very difficult role with gusto.

I strongly recommend this recording. But your enjoyment of it will be greatly enhanced if you are aware that you are not watching a musical setting of Shakespeares Othello and are aware of the important plot differences. You should also keep in mind that this is a bel canto tragedy and not a romantic drama.",1511308800,,2056,5.205438066465256
8640386,3,B00IAD18FK,I am glad to have this seldom viewed Rossini opera loosely based on Otello. The music is quite beautiful and the Bel Canto fireworks remarkable; the principle performers were top-notch. I do not mind that the story strays dramatically from Shakespeare or Verdi. But I am incredulous that this deranged director possibly under the influence of drugs transported the play into the 1950s or 1960s to some American city. The bedroom scene looks like a ghetto room on the west side of Chicago. We are stuck with this version until something more sensible comes out.,1429228800,4,560,4.905263157894737

8640388,3,B00IAD18FK,"This opera is loosely based on Shakespeares The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice. If not for the name of the opera and the protagonists, the viewer might believe the first two acts were based on other sources. In fact, the librettist Berio di Salsa direct source was a play by Jean-Francois Ducis, a French dramatists and adapter of Shakespeare plays, which he tailored to fit Rossinis composition style. The cast requires three main tenors: Otello, Iago, and Rodrigo.  The three of them are attracted to Desdemona. Otello, apparently married to Desdemona, is consumed by jealousy that brings on their mutual demise. Iago channels his frustration at not possessing her by convincing Otello of Desdemonas infidelity; and Rodrigo openly expresses his love for her in many opportunities. The first two acts are the typical opera seria of its time, 1816, with the exception of the tragic ending which was contrary to the customary ending in those days.
The main jewel of the opera is Act III, the Willow Song in particular, an intensely emotional music carried with free flowing expression.  It shows a musically maturing composer (at age 24) who would go on to influence composers including Verdi, whose own Otello displaced from popularity Rossinis 70 years later.
The orchestra uses period instruments, which makes the staging (placed in the 60s) even more out of place. Shakespeare and refrigerators don't mix well for me.  Luckily, the singers are really great and save the production.  The three tenors and Bartoli, the soprano, sing beautifully and their vocal Bell Canto fireworks are amazing and enjoyable.
 This is the only DVD/Blue-Ray of this opera known to me, so I'll stick to it until a new and hopefully better-staged one comes to light.",1421625600,2,1755,5.037931034482758
8640389,3,B00IAD18FK,"Will they never learn? Shakespeare did not set his play in downtown Los Angeles! CA is strange, but have you ever seen a Doge un LA? They ruined a perfectly good performance with their self-centered idiocy. They think they are more talented than Rossini.

8640390,5,B00IAD18FK,Forget the title.  This was one of Rossini's great successes during his lifetime.  Here it is in a magnificent production with great singing.  No where else would one think of comparing Verdi and Rossini.  There is no need to here.,1410825600,2,231,4.7
8640391,4,B00IAD18FK,"It is a pity that the first DVD available of Rossinis ""Otello"" does not give us the visual imagery that librettist Berio di Salza and composer Rossini had in mind to reinforce their dramatic and musical imagery.  Instead we are given yet another directors concept production set in what appears to be some shabby and dilapidated 1960s unspecified locale.  We of course have the usual anachronisms, such as the doges characteristic ducal hat, last worn by a doge in 1797, next to the womens Jackie Kennedy-esque 1960s pill box hats, and the mens swords next to the portable phonograph of the final act.  And the costumes, pleasant enough to look at, convey nothing of the grandeur of the time and place of St. Marks Square or Venice where Berio and Rossini set their story.

Which is not to say that the stage directors (Moshe Leiser and Patrice Caurier) are totally unsuccessful.  The staging and blocking of the first act (in an attractive, wood-paneled reception room) gives great logic and coherence to the entrances and exits of the characters which, in opera staging in general, can often have little more justification than its now time to sing my aria.  The chorus is especially believably handled in justifying their presence in scenes for reasons other than its now time to sing a choral number.  But other pieces of the staging are mystifying and even misleading.

At the end of Act I, for instance, the stage directors have directed Rodrigo to sing his line Parti crudel (Away cruel one) to Desdemona; the libretto is ambiguous as to whom he sings this line, so singing it to Desdemona could initially seem to make sense.  But the next line is Otellos: Ti sprezzo (You I despise) with the stage direction a Rod.(rigo) (to Rodrigo).  Not only does it therefore seem that Otellos line is a response to Rodrigos previous line (away cruel one), but Berio has specified that the line is to be sung to Rodrigo; nevertheless, the directors have Otello sing the line not to Rodrigo but rather to, or more precisely at, Desdemona.  Rodrigos next line: Soon you shall see who I am and  then Otellos: Learn to dread my anger seem to be interchanges between Rodrigo and Otello, beginning with Otellos line Ti sprezzo, designated by Berio to be delivered to Rodrigo.  Yet the directors have all of these lines directed at Desdemona.  The verbal, and certainly the visual, impression is that all of the characters in the scene - Elmiro (Desdemonas father), Otello, and Rodrigo - are attacking Desdemona.  This simply does not seem to be supported by the text.

Although Otellos opening line in this scene is Linfida (the untrustworthy one), he has not been seen since the end of the first scene of this act, where his last words were:
  But then only shall I be happy
  When love crowns the wishes of my heart...
  Oh love, disperse the storm
  That has been the cause of all my woes;
  Upon thy pinions,
  Let hope be wafted to me. (Translation: uncredited in Harvard College library edition: The Bequest of Evert Jansen Wendell)

At this earlier point in the plot, therefore, Otello has just been made a citizen of Venice, and thus now has reason to hope that his secret marriage to Desdemona will be accepted by her father and the court; at this point he knows nothing of the letter with the lock of hair from Desdemona addressed to him which has been intercepted and is now in the possession of Jago and will soon be used against him.  At the end of Act One, therefore, it seems more logical that Otellos linfida is prompted by the fact that he has not received any missives from Desdemona recently and he now sees her standing next to his rivale (rival) Rodrigo.  Based on his closing lines when last seen, it makes more sense that Otello and Desdemona are united in love against the other characters, especially since Otello tells Rodrigo in this later scene that he bases his claim to Desdemona on Virtue, constancy, love; the oath she pledged me,  and Desdemona replies: It is true: I have sworn- before she is cut off by her father and Rodrigo.  In addition to which, the final stage direction for the Act says: Elmiro takes Desdemona and leads her away.  She retires, casting a look of tenderness on Otello.  The directors will have none of this; they have Elmiro chase Otello (the warrior who has just re-captured Cyprus) off the stage while Desdemona hurriedly escapes through another exit.

Another mystifying piece of staging is the end of Act Two.  Set in a seedy pool hall where drug deals are going down, Desdemona has attempted to prevent a duel (with cue sticks) between Otello and Rodrigo, but they rush off anyway.  The chorus then enters to assure her that Otello is safe, but her father enters to express the shame he has experienced because of Desdemonas actions.  Desdemona is distraught over her fathers feelings: If my father desert me, where am I to look for pity?  To stage this, the directors have Desdemona take a bottle of beer from the refrigerator, climb onto the pool table in her bare feet, and end the magnificent vocal ensemble by pouring the bottle of beer over her head.  Even in the 1960s, this would seem an unlikely way for a daughter to express the shame she feels over losing the pity and respect of her father.  But the real point is that none of this staging enhances the music or the drama, which, after all, should be the job description of a director.

Which is all the more distressing since reviews like this ought to be able to concentrate on how well the performers have re-created the vision of the librettist and composer instead of how the directors have interfered with it.  And it is doubly distressing because the acting and singing in this production are excellent and, in some cases, superb.  Cecilia Bartoli is simply magnificent; she has somehow miraculously rid herself of the facial contortions and eyelid twitching that made it so distracting and uncomfortable to watch some of her earlier performances, and she now simply sings with beautiful tone and line.  Given a production which supported Berios and Rossinis vision, she would be the ideal Rossini Desdemona.  And the tenors are almost as good.  Rossini gave each of the three tenors about equal amounts of music to sing, and each does an excellent job.  Javier Camarena in particular, as Rodrigo, handles the  treacherously high tessitura and fioritura brilliantly.

This is the most I have ever enjoyed an opera by Rossini.  And I have seen several productions of ""Il Barbiere"" in person, including Covent Gardens and the Mets; but for my taste, this is a better opera.  It was after all one of Rossinis most popular operas during the first half of the nineteenth century.  Would that it had been given a staging equal to its merits so that these excellent singers could have made it one of the most popular operas during the first half of the twenty-first century.",1408406400,16,6887,4.718828451882845
8640392,5,B00IAD18FK,"I found this the equal to Verdi's in every way  and, sometimes even better and certainly more accessible and more melodic. Dramatically lighter than Verdi's, musically more entertaining. This is not your average Rossini. I was so glad I had the opportunity to compare the two. I think you owe to yourself to compare the both of them as well.",1407974400,,341,4.683333333333334
8640393,4,B00IAD18FK,"As with the other reviewers, I am grateful at last to be able to see on DVD an excellent performance of this important work. After several decades of bel canto revival we at last have singers who do not ""just make it"" through the demands of range and agility but can execute those demands with panache and drama. The casting in this performance was excellent. Apart from the wonderful singing and acting of the leads (Cecilia Bartoli and John Osborn), special mention should be made of the excellent performances of the ""other"" tenors: Javier Camarena and Edgardo Rocha. In particular, the sensitive lyrical singing of Javier Camarena provided a gorgeous contrast to all the fireworks heard throughout the ensembles.

The directing was superb, completely in sync with the music and text. I especially like the way the asides, so often awkward, were really brought to life and made believable.

The only problem was the unfortunate decision to set the opera in the 1960s. Edgy avant-garde productions are fine for the war horses of the repertoire, but when a rare work is being made available to the public for the first time it would be nice to see a production more in accord with the composer's and librettist's intentions. I found the director's commentary on racism (through stage business involving a black servant) just awkwardand it had nothing to do with the original. And do we really want to see Cecilia Bartoli embracing a refrigerator?

I wish someone would call a moratorium on all these ""relevant"", ""politically-correct"", modern productions. We've had so many of them that by now they're ho-hum. Can't directors think up anything different?

In this case it was especially strange inasmuch as the orchestra was using period instruments. Why not use period costumes? Opera in Rossini's time was supposed to present the audience with a spectacular evening's performanceboth sight and sound. I wish they could just take the same cast, the same acting, but film it again with different sets and costumes. I would much rather see Cecila Bartoli in velvet and pearls than in an ugly black shift; and I would much rather see evoked the gold and marble of Venice than the drab bare walls of what looked like the interior of a tenement.

Nonetheless, the performance more than makes up for the deficiencies of the production. And this gives one an idea of how exciting this work was for audiences of the early 19th century. The drama works! Rossini needn't be apologetic either to Shakespeare or Verdi.",1406246400,4,2507,4.931279620853081
