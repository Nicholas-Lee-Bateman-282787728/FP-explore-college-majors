8246742,5,B0012LUO20,"I received this DVD as part of a boxed set sold at Walgreens in the ""As seen On TV section.  It is gentle, and has a short set of stretches using a green ball while lying on the floor.  (ball and way to inflate it is included) The instructor's experience is evident in her choice of just the stretches which are effective, and no more.

The stretches were doable even with a good deal of back pain AND my not being very limber.  I was sore the first evening after doing it, but in the morning I was better than I had been!

It acted like first aid in a crisis.

Peggy Cappy's ""Easy Yoga for the rest of us"", also helped me get my back to normal.  I recommend both these items!

8246744,3,B0012LUO20,"I've always been curious about the Bender Ball workouts, when I saw this DVD at a used book sale, I picked it up.  Instructor Leslee Bender leads two background exercisers, Lucy, who displays easier modifications, and Kitty, who slightly harder variations for some of the exercises.  Although Leslee performs a few of the moves herself, she mostly walks around Mari Winsor style.  Leslie and crew use a Bender ball; I used this:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Body-Back-Ball-Porcupine-Massage-Ball/dp/B0037LY8PM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Body Back Ball & Porcupine Massage Ball</a>.

The Main Menu offers options for Play All with Introduction, Play All without Introduction, as well as lists all of the available chapters.  I have briefly described each chapter below, adding in approximate times.

STANDING WARM-UP (2.5m)
Starting with the ball between the knees, Leslee performs a few pelvic tucks to find neutral spine.  This segment also includes stretches to warm-up the lower back and arm swings to loosen the arms/shoulders.

LOWER BACK STRETCH (4m)
Coming to hands and knees, Leslee cues a cat/cow series, performing a more modified version of cow pose (stomach drawing in while the back stays flat).  She also adds what she calls a ""wagging tail"" to this move.

SPINE STABILIZATION (3m)
The spine stabilization work is basically back strengthening work performed on the stomach.  Here Leslee has you use a small towel placed under the forehead as she leads you through a series of back extensions/superman-type moves.

CORRECT SPINAL CURL (2m)
In this section, Leslee does just a few seated crunches, using the ball placed behind the low back for support.

SIDE PLANK (2m)
This work is performed with either the legs stretch or the knees bent, lifting the hips up and down.

LYING BACK EXERCISES (4m)
Here Leslee lies supine with the ball under the tailbone for a hip hiker move (raise one hip, then the other) and typewriter (moving the hips side-to-side).  This is followed by a series of hip flexors stretches.

SIDE LYING CRUNCHES (4m)
This segment actually consists of side-lying hip/glutes work.  Lying on your side with the ball under one ankle, you'll lift your top leg up and down, toes pointed down.

Stretch (2.5m)
To stretch, Leslee begins lying on the back for a Figure 4 stretch.  She then places the ball under the upper back, stretching this area by lying back over it.  The final stretches include mermaid and thread the needle.

Note that all the DVD case says that the running time for this workout is ""about 30 minutes,"" the actual time for this workout was closer to 17 minutes.

Overall, I found this workout somewhat disappointing.  I was looking for a good therapeutic video for my back, which has been getting tight at times since I recently started kettlebell work, but for me, these moves were way too basic, especially at the slow pace that Leslee sets (in particular, she spends A LOT of time on setup).  In my opinion, this would be best suited to someone who is more limited in mobility or perhaps is in more active pain and thus needs a very gentle program.  My final rating would be 3 1/2 stars.",1319241600,7,3183,5.086705202312139
8246745,5,B0012LUO20,"I had a serious back surgery earlier this year and after 4 months of physical therapy I am looking for various books and videos that will help me continuing exercising on my own. My physical therapist used a Bender Ball for a few exercises so I already had the ball. I purchased this DVD to give me more ideas of what to do with the ball. And it certainly did!

This DVD contained a set of very nice exercises, I felt they really stretched my back and were effective.  The DVD has two sets of exercises going at the same time, beginner and advanced, so you can choose what fits your level best.  The exercises were not strenuous.  I was able to follow the beginner level despite being weakened by surgery/inactivity.

The first time I ran through the DVD  I was really enjoying the exercises and when I got through all the exercises the time really flew and I thought the DVD was really short.  On the second playing I timed it and not counting the introduction the DVD had 30 minutes of exercise so it was not as short as I felt the first time through it.  It is a pretty good sign when you think the exercise did not last long enough!

All exercises are aimed at strengthening the back muscles, some are laying on the back, some are sitting, some are on your hands and knees, some are laying on your belly.  While following the tape there are not enough repetitions to get fatigued (which is good, so the valuable DVD time is not taken up by long repetitions).  Once you learn the basics you can extend each exercise for more repetitions on your own.

I am so pleased with this DVD that I am planning to purchase several more Bender Balls DVDs.",1308268800,4,1646,4.3431372549019605
8246746,4,B0012LUO20,The DVD is relatively short but does provide a great exercise routine that actually helps reduce tension and tightness in the back. Worked for me!,1249776000,,146,4.88
8246747,4,B0012LUO20,I was glad to see this workout was not strenuous.  I have periodic back pain and this workout makes my back feel good without a lot of strain.  Contains good stretches that leave you feeling healthier and more flexible.,1248912000,2,219,4.589743589743589
