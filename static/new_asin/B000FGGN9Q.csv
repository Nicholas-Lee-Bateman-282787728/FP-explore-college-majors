2565305,5,B000FGGN9Q,"What a relief to see, at last, a film that celebrates friendship over sexuality! This is a well-written, well-acted, heart-warming tale of comradeship, the joy of living, and the nobility of dying.",1365033600,,197,5.1875
2565306,4,B000FGGN9Q,"This a touching story that is told without kid gloves.  A random encounter between a free spirited womanizer with a quiet, reserved professional gay man, leads to a long term friendship between the pair.  Good natured teasing is part of their relationship, but underneath it all is a true love and friendship.  When one becomes terminally ill, the other is there for him til the very end.  Very touching and heartfelt story.",1360800000,,424,4.847222222222222
2565307,4,B000FGGN9Q,"I usually don't like subtitled movies, but this was a good one. I'm sorry that more people don't know about it. It's funny, touching, and real.",1353974400,,143,4.538461538461538
2565308,5,B000FGGN9Q,What a great movie. An exploration of just how much opposites attract and affect the lives of so many people. Give Simon a chance; you won't be disappointed.,1326412800,2,157,4.642857142857143
2565309,4,B000FGGN9Q,"The film was a little slow to make an impact but once it did I was hooked. What might be thought of as unlikable characters, unfavorable activity and unexpected character relationships somehow work to convey that heart, is at the heart of life. The characters and events became endearing. A very enjoyable movie I can highly recommend.",1308009600,,335,4.894736842105263
2565310,4,B000FGGN9Q,Good story that just happens to be slightly incorrect. Definitely all sorts of disfunction going on but in a good way mostly. I disagree with the implication that it's a gay film. Would definitely recommend it to others.,1299369600,2,220,4.815789473684211
2565311,5,B000FGGN9Q,"Most of my close friendships, which are small, are quite similar to the friendship these guys had. Sometimes, opposites do attract and for Camiel to have been friends with Simon is so moving and wonderful. And the kids, talk about high support and misbehaving at the same time. I love it. highly recommended",1241136000,4,307,4.811320754716981
2565312,5,B000FGGN9Q,"And now, as they used to say on Monty Python, for something completely different. This film is a kind of screwball comedy that portrays an odd-couple friendship between its title character, a crudely hilarious cafe owner and drug dealer (""soft drugs,"" we are informed) and women's boxing coach, and a mild-mannered gay dentist named Camiel. It is Simon who takes Camiel under his wing, after knocking him down with his car. In mid-winter, they spend vacation time on the beaches of Thailand, along with an entourage of Simon's friends, including two women who are fiercely attached to him. All very Dutch in its free-wheeling embrace of life lived to its absolute limits.

Fourteen years later, the two men's paths cross again, and this time Simon, still capable of just about any kind of social outrage, has been diagnosed with inoperable cancer, and his old friend Camiel is drawn again into the circle of friends - plus two growing children -  who love and support him. While Simon's potential for outrage is pretty much undaunted by his declining health, it's clear that some arrangements need to be made for his approaching demise, and there the film begins a fascinating dance on the margin between farce and the maudlin. Finally, after a gay wedding (how often do you see that in the movies?), what begins as an accidental meeting is played out with a touching inevitability. Absolutely recommended for anyone with a yen for a life-affirming film that is unlike anything you've ever seen.",1204761600,7,1495,4.928571428571429
2565313,4,B000FGGN9Q,"SIMON is a little jewel of a film. In a manner more typically Dutch than most it is an exploration of the interaction of two men, opposites in almost every way except in their potential power of friendship.

Camiel is a gay, tender, polite, dental student while Simon is straight, seemingly critical of gay aspects (though always with tongue in cheek), noisy, outspoken, crafty, boisterous and a bit crude caf  owner. The two collide in an accident, an act that bonds them inextricably, and the film shows the two polar opposites reconnecting fourteen years later when Simon is dying of cancer and calls upon all his resources and involves Camiel in the difficult process of life's ending. Simon's strength of character (despite his previous outwardly bombastic and crude manner) gives Camiel much to learn - and gives the audience some touching and tender thoughts on which to dwell. The film is a fun, at times naughty, smart, and ultimately life-affirming tale about the importance of friendship and family...and a strong sense of humor...that are the stuff that allow us to survive even the most difficult of moments in life.

The entire cast is excellent but the performances by Cees Geel as Simon and Marcel Hensema as Camiel Vrolijk are worthy of awards. This is an extravagantly fun film, completely open and honest about its sexuality, that results in a memorable emotional experience for the viewer. In Dutch with English subtitles.

8122427,5,B000FGGN9Q,A fantastic movie about friendship that transcends gender or sexual preference. A very touching movie that made you feel good inside.,1497571200,,133,5.380952380952381

8122429,1,B000FGGN9Q,"This is not the film I ordered - The film in the queue that I ordered is, Simon a 1980 film  starring Alan Arkin - you have that film in the queue but then when you click on it,  it's a completely different film  with the same title that I do not want to see- I thought it was just different artwork or different packaging but it's a completely different film with the same title- The picture I attached is the film I thought I purchased .",1484524800,,439,4.022988505747127

8122431,4,B000FGGN9Q,"What a wonderful heartfelt story, wish it was longer though. I enjoyed getting to know the lives of the main characters. Interesting twist and turns, leading into a surprise ending.",1400112000,,181,5.066666666666666
8122432,5,B000FGGN9Q,"This is a movie about complex relationship of the title character--a Bon vivant, a womanizer, a drug dealer, and as time passes a genuine and authentic character of his own making. His friend Camiel is swept into this constellation as an observer and participant in Simon's world passion and compassion.  Settle in because this story develops in a leisurely manner but with enough going on to keep it interesting.",1392249600,,413,4.9855072463768115
8122433,5,B000FGGN9Q,"The movie starts out as a lighthearted story of a man living in the present, then it turned serious fast and the ending may be somewhat of a shock for Americans. It's a wonderful take on the fluid family dynamics that exist in Amsterdam. As I understand Dutch, I noticed the caption translator had trouble finding proper translations for the many idiomatic expressions used by the actors. This movie may have less impact on non-Dutch speakers, but it's one of my all time favorites.",1390176000,,482,4.75
8122434,5,B000FGGN9Q,"This is hardly what I would classify as a gay film. One of the main characters happens to be a  gay male, the other and ""understanding""  straight male, who has plenty of (black) money who develops a platonic, but intriguing, very strong,  friendship with the other (gay) guy . You could be forgiven for expecting some moves, but they never happen. They part their ways for a number of years after the gay guy has a one night stand with the others girlfriend, but resume their close friendship after a chance meeting. This movie is all about the straight guy and you will be talking about him, and his character, well after the movie ends. There is a black suspense with this movie and if you participate with it you will have plenty of thought provoking questions and discussion.",1389830400,,779,4.589928057553957

8122436,5,B000FGGN9Q,"I didn't warm up to the characters at first but after the first 20 minutes things started to coalesce and I fell in love.  Towards the end, the tears flowed.  Reminded me so much of being with a loved one while they passed on.",1376438400,,226,4.113636363636363
