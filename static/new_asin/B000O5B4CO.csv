2790877,3,B000O5B4CO,"A demonic, homicidal restaurant mascot, a la Ronald McDonald, hacking teenagers into coleslaw.  That's right up my alley and sounds like alot of fun.  I live for that kinda stuff.  Problem is, the film's not quite sure about what it wants to be.  Sure, it's certainly got some laugh out loud moments(The Hellaburger tv commercials are great), and I've always loved killers that use horrible puns(when a character finds a dead girl in a freezer, Horny the Clown tells him ""she's just chillin'"").  The thing I didn't quite care for was that the directors at times seemed liked they actually were trying to make a scary movie.  Certain scenes seem to be done for honest to god, ass reaming suspense.  That doesn't mix too well considering the many intentionally tongue in cheek scenes we'd already been laughing at.  With a plot this silly, you'd might as well go tongue in cheek.  After all, it'd be nearly impossible to make a terrifying film about a guy called Horny the Clown.  And if you're gonna go tongue in cheek, you'd might as well do it all the way.  Also, in between rather quiet scenes of dialogue, the loud blasts of metalcore when the killer attacks will have you constantly monitoring the volume control if you're trying not to wake up the household/apartment building/neighborhood.  All in all, not bad for what it is, but it's certainly no Ice Cream Man(but then again, what is?).",1181347200,3,1395,4.742738589211618

2790888,3,B000O5B4CO,"In this slasher flick, one of the main characters receives a $400 `noise' citation from the police.  They should have done the same thing with this movie.  It's loud, obnoxious, and not all that inspired.  To say that it's a horror film and a comedy is pushing all credibility.  There's just not enough (consistent) horror or comedy to sustain that declaration.  It's definitely hit and miss.  Some of the actors treat their roles seriously; some are so over the top that the disparity is glaring (in particular, Larry Joe Campbell as Detective Crockers).  It's like they shuffled two different versions of the script together and only some of them got the memo to `act up.'  As for the villain of this piece, he's dead and yet not dead.  He utilizes a Ouija board, an Etch-a-sketch, and a magic 8-ball to send messages from beyond (very bizarre and one of the few running gags that work).  Otherwise, kids are killed in a host of unimpressive ways.  If you're going to claim to be a notch above the usual slasher flick then you had better deliver on that promise.  This movie doesn't quite fulfill its potential, however `hip' the writers think they are with stale Republican jokes and cheep shots at California.  It's been done to death and by better filmmakers.",1411257600,,1264,4.71689497716895

2790891,3,B000O5B4CO,"This film is so bad they couldn't possibly have been unaware of how terrible they made it. Thankfully, though, they seem to have taken the opportunity and just have as much absolute fun as possible. Make no mistake: this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Despite that, I've rarely had as much fun watching a horror movie as I did with this one. It's like a terrible Nightmare on Elm Street rip-off involving a murderous fast-food clown mascot known only as...Horny the Clown. Yes, this is a real thing. And it makes for some fantastic laughs. Plot holes, endless raunchy jokes, and bad acting are abound here, not to mention bland and generic 2000's alterna-rock. Needless to say, if you go in with the lowest possible expectations, you'll have a grand old time and it's plenty of good fun, just be sure you recognize that the movie is pure trash at the end of the day.",1387843200,,879,4.5
2790892,4,B000O5B4CO,"Our main character of this film is Mackenzie Carpenter (played by the beautiful Leighton Meester), who plays the role of your typical sneaky and rebellious teenage girl.  Drive Thru revolves around a demonic, killer clown named Horny who comes to town and begins  hacking Mackenzie's friends to death, one by one, with his signature meat cleaver. Horny has some sort of an obsession with Mackenzie and wants something from her, but she can't seem to figure out what. As the body count piles up, he stalks her and plays mind games with her by the day via 70's kitsch toys.

Mackenzie's 18th birthday is just days away and the closer her birthday gets, the closer he gets to her. She ends up discovering that due to her mom's past involving the spirit of the man in the clown suit, that she and her dead friends share an unfortunate connection with Horny. Mackenzie realizes that unless she wants to become Horny's next victim, she must confront and defeat the demonic clown and send him back to hell's freak circus. The ending of the movie left room for a sequel which supposedly began production in 2010 but has yet to be released. No idea what the hold up is but I wish they'd go ahead and get it done because I'm anxious to see the sequel.

Right off the bat, it needs to be said that this is NOT a strict horror movie! This is comedy mixed with horror, so expect some cheesy and comical kills and lines being said. If you want a clown horror movie that's all horror, I recommend Stephen King's IT or the 1976 film Clown Murders. Because this is a low budget movie, the effects of this movie are very cheap and the acting is average but the movie overall is enjoyable, nonetheless. It should also be noted that whoever the makers of thus movie were probably die-hard Republicans as a shot is taken at Democrats and Republicans, there's a picture of George W. Bush hanging up in a police detective's office, and a teenage girl is shown wearing a shirt that says ""I <3 Bush"".

Drive Thru earns a 4/5 from me and if you're a fan of evil clown movies (horror comedy or just horror) then I'd give this movie a chance. You might just like it",1387670400,,2137,4.441326530612245

2790894,1,B000O5B4CO,"Why are movies like this made?  Do writers and directors really do this on purpose?  Is there some nefarious organization that puts out crap like this just to make brain cells regress to an infantile state?  Could this be a plot to turn the human race into drooling idiots?  Nah....it's just a pathetic attempt to try and make a teen horror movie with extremely irritating lead characters and un-funny humor.  You know when the so-called funny bits die a sad death that you are in for a miserable time.  When every other word is an F bomb and you wish immediate death to everyone involved including Horny The Clown, then there are some major problems.  Yeah....Horny The Clown.  I guess that's what passes for humor in this pile of excrement.  The fact is that a colonoscopy would be a better option then being subjected to this slop shows how low the scale has dropped.  And wait until you see the thug rappers going to the drive thru at the beginning.  It's enough to make you despise everything that comes afterwards, like the pathetic ""alternative girl rock band"" garbage.  Yeah, that was real convincing.  And what's with the unreal teen sex and drug scenes?  They are all talk and no real sex.  I was hoping they would overdose on the drugs but no such luck.  The screenwriter reminds me of a 50 year old trying to write scenes for a time in his life he can barely remember.  I doubt any teen could relate to this garbage.  But then it's back to the clown again.  Truthfully, Bozo The Clown was more frightenting than this.  Even Jack In The Box holds more interest and he even makes better burgers.

""SPOILER ALERT"" (The quotations are to indicate that I don't really consider this stuff spoilers)

So apparently the filmmakers got really high one night, watched the 1984 classic A Nightmare on Elm Street, and then decided to go get some McDonald's, when they suddenly got the inspiration for a slasher film.

MORON FILMMAKER #1: Hey! I got an awesome idea for a movie! (takes a hit from his joint)

MORON FILMMAKER #2: Yeah!? What!?

MORON FILMMAKER #1: We should make a movie where a killer mascot of a drive-thru goes on a killing spree!

MORON FILMMAKER #2: That's so awesome!

That's at least how I think it went down, I could be wrong. But yeah, this is one of the stupidest slasher films I've ever come across. As a horror film it fails, as a comedy it isn't funny in the slightest. It even tries to be be political, and a slasher film is not the place to be shoving your politics down someone's throat.

Mackenzie (Leighton Meester, of stuff, I really have yet to see her in anything that really says ""someone to look out for"") is an upper class stoner teen who acts like she's better than the other upper class teens because she and her friends are all hip and now. During a party, her friends play around with a ouija board (which they are confused by what it is, because after all young people don't know anything about non electronic stuff). Although we later see Mackenzie playing with a magic 8 ball, so I guess they're only familiar with certain older novelty items. Anywho, the ouija board moves on it's own to spell out a license plate number to a car belonging to a couple of idiot white guys trying to be gangsta (who probably produce the worst dialogue in the entire movie). The idiot gangstas are the opening kills by Horny the Clown, the mascot of local fast food restaurant Hella Burger. Sigh...in what universe would a restaurant be called that? And this place apparently opened in the 1970's, so I seriously doubt anyone would use that name back then. And Horny the Clown, sure that sounds like a character you want entertaining little kids. I get that it's supposed to be satire (at least I'm assuming they were going for satire), but you could've put a little more effort into the name and design even. Horny just looks stupid, and spouts off terrible one liners that would make Mr. Freeze from Batman and Robin role his eyes. Mackenzie and her friends are unlikeable jerks who judge other people for being supposedly stupid, when they themselves talk about idiotic crap and smoke a lot of pot. I'll give kudos that most of the special effects seem to be done practically, but that can't save this pile of nothing. And that's the biggest problem really, it's an incredibly dull film. The main reason I'm writing this is that I'm hoping my rating will bump this movie's average rating down a little. I don't feel that this movie even deserves a 2 star average, it barely deserves 1.",1360368000,3,3070,4.508992805755396

On to the actual review. It's good. It's a ripoff of several other horror movies but not like 'Scary Movie' or anything. Acting isn't bad at all, it's not Brad Pitt level of course, but it's good enough for the average person. Good storyline even though it's largely from 'Nightmare on Elm St.'

Infact the clown looks like a rejected member of the Killer Clowns from Outer Space or a cheap verison of the clown from IT. The film is mostly boring with little to no jump scares.

2790907,4,B000O5B4CO,"This is one of those horror films that works because it is just so hysterical. There are more laughs in this film than in many comedies, and the ""cheese factor"" of the special effects makes it even more laughable.

Leighton Meester is a very likable actress, no matter what she is in, and clearly she delivers in this role as a headstrong teenager who is a bit more sophisticated than the typical young girl in horror films. Her cast of well-intentioned but dim-witted friends are funny also. But the cameos and small roles are what makes this film. The Morgan Spurlock cameo is a nice touch, as well as some other characters such as the fast-food restaurant owner (John Gilbert), the fat rambling detective (Larry Joe Campbell), and the deranged janitor (Sean Whalen) are all funny and well-played.

When it comes down to it, there are two types of movies in this genre: ones that take themselves WAY too seriously and fail because they try to be too ""smart,"" and there are the other films that succeed because they are so preposterous by their very nature that they make humorous situations out of the self-parody. This film falls into the latter category. There is plenty of gore, screams, off-color jokes, and funny one-liners. After all, when we go through a drive-thru, we're not looking for a five course meal. We're looking for a particular item or two that will satisfy our appetite at the time.

There are some pretty funny commercials for the fast food restaurant placed throughout. I don't know if anyone caught this, but the HellaBurger manager is the dude that filmed the Super Size Me documentary, and he is pretty funny in his short scene.

To me, this movie was pretty ironic being that my ""break food"" was either a Big Mac or a Double Cheeseburger meal. Anyway, to the point, I never thought that ""Drive Thru"" would be a horror/comical/slasher movie. The cast members were a little obscure but hella-good! Now, we have a beautiful teenage girl named Mackenzie played by Leighton Meester. She's the lead singer of her band. She plays her heart out towards her fans and afterwards she chills with her boyfriend and the rest of the group. The night begins when the teens smoke weed and laugh about the Ouja Board. They think it's a loved one contacting them, but they were wrong. Horny the Clown is the killer with a huge meat cleaver. He slices, he dices, and makes chicken strips in three different ways. He was the one that sent Mackenzie the message on the board. And it doesn't stop there. See, Horny had a real name, and it was Archie. He was just an original, shy teen. He was unpopular and became a mascot at a hella-burger restaurant. He had a crush on Mackenzie's mom when she was a teen. And because of that, her boyfriend hated him for it. So, he and his crew thought of a plan to play a prank on him. And when Archie is celebrating his b-day all by himself, they start by breaking in the place and teased him, somebody knocked him over, one thing lead to another and the crew left him to burn. Since then, nobody told a soul. After that, Horny was ressurected into a murdering hellspawn and now he goes after teen kids, making them pay for the sins of their parents. As for Mac, she has to be threatened and chased by him constantly. The things that Horny says are hilarious. The particular scene I like is when he scares the hell out of those stoners. He literally slices and dices them in the playroom. What a bloody mess! And about Larry Joe Campbell's character Crockers, I hated him. He was always bossy, stuffing his face with junk food and arrogant, too blunt and fat. Ms. Meester has a permanent purpose in movies. She has beauty, charisma, humour and style. Hopefully, after she's done with ""Gossip Girl"", she can start her acting career, for real. All in all, I liked this movie. It has everything a slasher fan could ask for. Be prepared to see it again if you have it on DVD, I wonder if they can sell a Special Edition, we need to see those bloopers again. I clap my hands to this one, great job well done.

Mackenzie (Gossip Girl's Leighton Meester) finds herself to be one of the many targeted kills of Horny the clown. Since he only communicates with her through innocent childhood toys, its up to her to save his next possible victims- and ultimately herself.

This is not a serious horror movie. And its not MEANT to be a serious horror movie. That fact is made blatantly clear with the plot: A knife wielding clown? Named HORNY? But that doesn't take away from the overall fun of the movie!

If you liked the horror movies of yesteryear, this movie is a really good homage using plot devices from Nightmare on Elm Street, Carrie, IT, Chucky... plus there's some good comic relief sprinkled throughout the film as well. The acting is definitely NOT bad. The woman who played Mackenzie's mother made me cringe a few times, but besides that, I think they all did a pretty good job with what they were given!

Since everyone else here at Amazon have done some great reviews already all that leaves me with is:  The chase scenes with Horny the Clown coming after Leighter Meester were indeed suspenseful, Horny's line where he shouts "" You're my girlfriend now, and I'm horny!"" cracks me up every time! Also it felt like a fond tribute to ""The Funhouse"" when Horny kills that snob couple in the funhouse/trick mirrors scene! That scene where one of Mackenzie's friends get her head nuked through the bottum of a microwave was one incomparably clever murder scene! My only criticizisms of this movie are that dreadful and annoying not to mention intrusive metal music and that whole unexplained thing with Horny possessing supernatural/demonic powers! Other than that definitely watch this movie for that sweet Hottie Leighton Meester and of course Horny the Clown! And dare I say ""It's Hella Good!""",1223942400,2,1899,4.93125

I'd say, if you're looking to pick this one up it's iffy so don't pay more than like 5.00 for it, that way you don't feel like you've lost out too much if you end up hating it.",1213488000,2,344,4.029411764705882

A mentaly challanged boy who was burned alive in a drive thrue resteraunt comes back for revenge against those that wronged him.

Full of Sadistic comedy, great killings and a wonderful plot full of revenge and judgment. I was suprised by the quality of the film compared to such films as Mr. Jingles this is a good step up.",1212883200,6,401,4.714285714285714
2790918,1,B000O5B4CO,"I don't know how, i just seemed to be drawn into renting the worst movies anyone can possibly find.

Clowns are a good way to scare people, they don't scare me personally, but movies like ""IT"" and other horror movies about clowns can freak some people out just by them being dressed as a clown.

However, this clown is like something you would see in a stupid episode of Power Rangers. And it's not even a movie thats like so bad it's funny, this one is just so bad it's pathetic.

So the opening scene you see some white kid's trying to be homie boy gangstas saying the stupidest dialog possibly imaginable, they drive to a drive through acting like morons and end up being killed by the spice-girl-shoe wearing clown.

Then a girl has a party, gets stoned with her friends, a uigi board, a license plate, a killer after them.... blurgh, you've scene the plot before, however done much better then they did for this p.o.s.

The acting is terrible, the bad guy is stupid, the cop is annoying, just avoid this movie, take my word on it, you will never regret never have seeing this p.o.s.

I turned it off halfway through it was so bad, being an AC/DC fan I am sick to death of these stupid movies that make out like AC/DC was a band people only listened to in the 70's, and hearing the main character playing something backwards that was supposed to be Highway To Hell to hear 7 messages from Satan.... enough said... that Clich is dead ok, come back to reality and realize heard rock is about the only form of music that has never died out and surpassed every genre there is.

And the clown costume, ohhhhhh, soooooooooo scary... congratulations on killing off the scary clown image for anyone who sees this piece of s...garbage.

Avoid it, it's the worst movie I've seen this year. Next time make a movie that has a title that actually has anything to do with the whole movie other then the first 5 minutes of it.

2790921,4,B000O5B4CO,"Mackenzie Carpenter (super-hottie Leighton Meester) is a typical teen on the verge of adulthood. She suffers from extreme boredom in her town of Blanca Carne (trans: White Meat). That is until a killer-clown named ""Horny"" starts chopping her friends and classmates into McNuggets! The vicious clown communicates w/ Mackenzie through a Ouija board, a Magic 8-Ball, and an Etch-a-Sketch, giving her vital clues as to whom his next victims will be! Can Mackenzie and her remaining friends (including Rachael Bella from The Ring) stop this bozo-berzerker, or will the bloodbath continue? DRIVE THRU is funny, gory, and even suspenseful in places. I enjoyed the goofy, dark humor and homage to 80s-type slashers. Watch for the death-by-microwave sequence, as it's a real goosher!...",1188259200,2,777,5.377049180327869
2790922,2,B000O5B4CO,"I saw this movie in an ad for upcoming dvd releases and I had to get it. The first copy I got was a promo and was worthless, but I recently bought the dvd to watch the movie. IT SUCKS! The clown is becoming the killer in ever horror movie that is put out by anyone these days.  The worst of them being Mr. Jingles. This movie has many plot holes and doesnt really add up. The clown is killing people and he is a mascot, but the resturant was barely used in the film. I thought it would have been used more and could have been at least more fun. This movie has ever basic cliche that todays straight to dvd horror movies have and I cant believe the ending to this movie. Im surprised because ive seen alot of straight to dvd horror films and Amazon critics are not kind to them. Ive seen some that are good, decent, and some that I cant belive that I wasted my money on. This movie had some moments but all in all, it really sucked and im surprised some people enjoyed this film.",1187049600,4,978,4.067357512953368

Drive Thru has just about everything that a great B-movie should. It has a lot of laughs, gore, and cheese. If only it had some nudity.
Most of the death scenes are fun, especially when the guy is cut in half, his guts spilling out. Then Horny The Clown says ""that kid sure had a lot of guts."" It's stuff like that that makes Drive Thru brilliant and one of the most entertaining movies of the year.",1184630400,8,578,4.3119266055045875

2790927,4,B000O5B4CO,"One thing I do before I rent a straight to DVD movie is...I flip the case over and look at the movie stills on the back.  If there are no movie stills or if the stills look low budget, then I either don't rent the movie or I log on to amazon.com to check out the reviews.  The stills on the back of DRIVE-THRU gave a good indication it wasn't cheaply made and could possibly be a hidden gem. And a hidden gem it was!

The leads were well cast.  The one-liners were actually funny. And the villan was scary.  Although the mystery surrounding has been seen before, because the movie was so well done, the worn-out premise is easily overlooked and works.

Scariest scene is when Horny's mask is torn off and his true face is revealed.  How the heroine saves herself is brilliant! Let's hope the sequel is just as good!",1181865600,6,815,4.287581699346405
