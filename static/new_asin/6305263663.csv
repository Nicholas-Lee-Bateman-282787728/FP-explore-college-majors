8233151,4,6305263663,One of the lasts old school kung-fu movie...but a great way to go! Yuen biao plays a coward washer boy who somehow gets tangled with a killer. The story is confusing but the martial arts are unique. The scene where the tailor wants to kill master wong fei-hung is a classic that is copy move by move in the new legend of shaolin featuring jet li. The final showdown between biao ad the killer is fascinating as biao proves his ability to jump and move like jackie chan. A must have for all kung-fu old school fans.,1006560000,,514,4.309278350515464
