8682528,5,B00O8J0L62,"My kiddo checked this dvd out at the library twice.  Watched it almost everyday for the week that we had it on loan.  I wasn't sure that he would enjoy all of the people talking, but he was totally into it.  Though the cover is cheesy, the video is actually pretty good.  The computer generated ice age giants are well done and seem very realistic.",1509408000,2,348,4.3076923076923075

8682530,2,B00O8J0L62,"Not the Attenborough standard . Poor story stretched to fill a disk. Lots of talking heads, 3D animation trying to keep the reader interest about molecules (Hb), with little in depth information. The 3D of the mammoths is the same sequence run over and over with different backgrounds and camera positions, but feels very repetitive.",1469750400,,333,5.072727272727272
8682531,2,B00O8J0L62,"I bought this with the intention of it being a new story  The cover is extremely misleading from the manufacturer  It is completely different
It is only a re-release of a previous documentary Needless to say, my grandson was very disappointed as was I  It is entirely overpriced and would like a refund  Definitely not a problem with Amazon, just the manufacturer for re packaging an old product!!
Don't be mislead!!",1436832000,,416,4.816901408450704
