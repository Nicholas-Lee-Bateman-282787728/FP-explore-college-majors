5058671,4,B0076YFJPO,"Want an example of a ""so-bad-it's-good"" movie? Here it is! Everything in this feature was so laughably bad, that I found myself almost falling off the couch. I did appreciate the lack of its horrible CGI. They didn't over rely on it like most other movies, and used miniature sets and live animals instead, which added a bit of charm to the film. This movie is definitely not for those who expect the best.",1356480000,,406,4.5
5058672,5,B0076YFJPO,"Randal Malone's robotic voice in here annoyed me at first until I recognized it as a tribute to Dr. Phibes (and the ungloving of the face punctuated it); this flick is fun; shades of Jim Wynorski, Brett Piper and Fred Olan Ray, furry traces of Food of the Gods and Deadly Eyes and droppings of 1950's sci-fi nature run amuck made this entertaining (and garishly colorful); it reminded me of Pacific Comics's Alien Worlds from the 1980's, and the rat crawling into the girl's yoohoo nearly made me fall onto the floor...the Marquis de Sade would have approved. And thanks to the special features I now know that the stylish house that has appeared so often in Randal Malone movies is his actual home. FIVE BLOODY PAW PRINTS, fellas.",1349827200,2,731,4.674418604651163
5058673,4,B0076YFJPO,"""Rat Scratch Fever"" is an micro-budget epic.  It's has explosions and action galore.  Does it show its' budget at times?  Heck yeah, but you have to enjoy its' ambition even it doesn't always reach it's production value goal.",1338163200,2,225,4.868421052631579

5058675,5,B0076YFJPO,"So bad its hilarious.  Cheesy special effects.  Lots of rat killing and funny as hell.  No one could act so poorly, it had to be on purpose.",1503705600,,140,4.111111111111111
5058676,2,B0076YFJPO,"I usually like cheesy but this was overacting, bad sets, and wrong reactions. If you're just looking for noise while you clean, It might be okay.",1503360000,,145,4.615384615384615
5058677,4,B0076YFJPO,"After a disastrous visit to the mysterious Planet X, where mammoth rats run rampant, a spaceship returns to Earth. Unfortunately, it contains only one survivor out of its four original astronauts. It also contains rats! Lots of them! Something has happened to these fuzzy stowaways, as well as to the remaining human on board. When the ship crash-lands, Sonja Trenton (Tasha Tacosa) emerges. When she is rescued, the men who find her have no idea just how much danger they're in! Horrible, gory deaths soon follow, as Sonja becomes an extremely lethal nuisance. She's become some kind of rodent-driven vampire! Joined by her boyfriend, Jake (ford Austin), Sonja attempts to evade the attacks of the diabolical Dr. Christopher Steele (Randall Malone). The good doctor has a sort of Dr. Phibes thing going on, and has mechanical hands to boot! This all brings us to the rat-a-strophic finale, featuring Dr. Steele's ultimate killing machine! Now, while this movie is quite cheeeze-filled, it is still very entertaining. Plus, instead of the usual, godawful CGI monsters, we get real rats w/ glowing red eyes, and big old rat puppets for the close-ups w/ their human prey! There's even a bit of stop-motion action! Annnnd, the vehicles are miniatures, as well as the exterior sets! Cheap? Oh yes, wonderfully so! Co-stars Phoebe Dollar (HELL'S HIGHWAY, GOTH, ALIEN 3000) in yet another of her crazy, a$$-kicking roles. Outrageous! Absurd! Hilarious! More fun than a barrel full of rat-traps! This movie is the rat's pajamas! Wha...? Are you still here?? Go watch this mouse-ter-piece! Right now!...",1503100800,,1595,5.138461538461539
5058678,4,B0076YFJPO,"Hey, if you like campy B-movies this is it! This is a fun ride. Be ready for silly B-movie horror movie scenes. You got to love it! A cult classic in the making for sure. Travel to another planet with giant rats that come back to earth?!!! What could be better.",1499472000,2,261,4.137254901960785
5058679,4,B0076YFJPO,"Thanks to some extremely well detailed Gerry Anderson-esque sets and craft that looks like they just RC'd off the UFO back lot, and the willpower to do some unusual things, this movie rises from absolute stinker to somewhat of a gem in the current B-movie world. I can smell the love of the animators and puppeteers infused into every scene, and where it doesn't quite hold up, you still get a surprise in most scenes that leaves you going WTF was that?  I ended up appreciating the film maker's efforts here, thanks to eye-popping set designs, fast moving plot, unusual scenery, and  willingness to go over the top whenever required!",1499385600,,634,4.754545454545455
5058680,2,B0076YFJPO,"Planet X on an gross elliptical orbit comes by Earth. A private company owned by  Dr. Christopher Steele  (Randal Malone) sends a spaceship to explore the planet, which we discover is inhabited by rats. The rats manage to kill off all the humans except Sonja (Tasha Tacosa). A small one appears to climb inside her vee only to eat its way out of her tummy, clearly an Alien spoof that didn't work well. She manages to return to earth with rats that battle the humans.

First off, this was designed to be a camp ""so bad it is good"" film. As far as the special effects, if achieves the goal. However the dialogue and plot lack engagement and cleverness needed to go along with the bad props. If you are going to create a guy to spoof Dr. Strangelove, don't go half way. Weak characters.

Guide: f-word. No sex or nudity.",1475020800,2,818,4.397350993377484

5058684,2,B0076YFJPO,"Everyone involved in this sham studied at the Ed Wood School of filmmaking.  The sets are made of cardboard and whatever else they could find to fake a planet, a bar, the Steel Space Corporation headquarters.........  The budget had to have been a buck fifty.  Everyone must have worked for free (I'd hate to think they were paid to produce this garbage).  It's like a flashy colorful reject from 60's TV only not as good or half as fun.  Yes, it involves real rats, easily the best actors in the piece, the rest is bad CGI.  I'm assuming it was meant to be a spoof.  But I may be giving them too much credit.  It felt like a bunch of friends got together, got drunk, suggested they make a sci-fi horror flick, and came up with this.  If any of them had any real training I'd be surprised.

The plot is ripped off from a b-zillion better movies.  A space mission goes awry, there's one lone survivor and she brings back the rats who eventually rampage, killing everyone they can get their paws on.

It's stupid in a bad way and not funny in a good way.  Normally, I like crap films but there is a limit as to how crappy it can be and still be good.  This is just crap, the kind that makes you cringe.  It's an inside joke without a punch line.",1437004800,5,1243,4.2076271186440675
8511267,2,B0076YFJPO,"Was it supposed to be a parody of sci-fi horror? If so, it's great; pure schlock. If not, it's a low budget, amateur production. A choice party movie to MSTize. Gave it an extra star 'cause it's probably a future cult classic.",1527465600,,226,4.404761904761905

8511272,4,B0076YFJPO,"Great gore and lots of fun. Yes, it's an ultra low budget flick. If you're expecting the glossy look of a studio movie, then don't bother. But if you're looking for a nice, creative underappreciated sci-fi, horror flick that cuts loose in every way, sit back and enjoy the ratty mess that is Rat Scratch Fever.

8511275,4,B0076YFJPO,"Sure it is a Grade less-than-B movie with some horrible acting and a bizarre incredible plot and unbelievable events.......but I was looking for something stupid to watch with a pot of home-made chili and a 6-pack of beer and a salt shaker and desk-work to do. I had fun watching the incredibleness of a big rat with red eyes eating into the chick's bowels and living there. True, it was super hard to watch a rat drag an infant across the screen leaving a trail of blood....but......hey....it is just fake fun. Get something boring you have to do and watch this.....you will be entertained ...especially as you laugh through the bad acting and ""are you kidding me?"" sets and plot. Have fun! I did!",1506124800,,698,4.637096774193548

The middle 20-30 mins or so of the movie was a bit slow, but the rat scenes are fantastic.  And the special effects were absolutely hilarious.

If you are at all into campy / low budget / sci-fi flicks...  this one has to be on your list...  it's great...",1504656000,2,343,4.349206349206349
