6242905,4,B00HXEWG4E,"the price dropped $3 in four days. which was annoying but i can be reimbursed.
as for the product itself: the case is very clean and solid. The downside to this was that the S.A.V.E sticker was held on with a very good glue. in pealing it off as carefully as possible it still pulled some of the graphic off the case. So do yourself a favor and be very careful.
as for the two individual DVD cases inside, they both have alternate cover art, with episode listing. all four disks were very secure in the case and don't seem to be at risk of coming out on their own.
overall the whole thing is very nice and i cant wait to get into watching it.",1399939200,,642,4.103174603174603
6242906,5,B00HXEWG4E,"This is just a brief about the ""SAVE"" edition. I payed almost $70 for parts one and two...Part one I bought the ""Limited Edition"". Well much to my surprise...when I bought this version as a gift, it was the Chipboard box like my limited edition. Basically it IS the ""Limited Edition"" Chipboard box with Part Two included.
  It is the Limited Edition box....""That people are trying to sell you for $60 - part one"" with both parts. If you were to buy both parts as of now - Part 1 ""Limited Edition"" = $60....Part 2 = $37. With this version you get the Chipboard box - Parts 1 & 2 = $20.
 No....it does not have SAVE plastered all over the front of the box. I really wish all SAVE Editions were like this. It is the best edition I have seen and truly lives up the word ""SAVE"".

 I hope to see more like this!!!

 As far as the animation goes.....it is done by GONZO and as a whole is above average. Kuniko Hojo is your main character and is the heir apparent to rebel group known as Metal Age. Kuniko and her almost ever present Tranny friend ""Momoko"" are a great team. Even during the heat of battle Momoko always drops lines...she grabs one soldier and while she is surrounded by more Soldiers she'll say ""Patience boys..You all get a turn""...then proceeds to drop them. Two very likeable and inseparable characters. Yet there are three more that the story centers around and all are headed in the same direction. Whom will lay claim to Atlas, a haven amoung their ruinous existence...a city free of the strife endured by the masses aournd it.
 After the second great Konto quake - Tokyo is left to be reclaimed by nature. Hence the premises of the story. Their economy is carbon based and the more your nation pollutes the worse your econmy is...so Tokyo was left to be reclaimed  by nature hoping to cool the planet and lower carbon emissions.
 In my opinion this is a sleeper and at least worth watching.",1399593600,22,1906,4.42
6242907,5,B00HXEWG4E,"When pollution levels cause the governments of the world to transform the global economic system to one centered on the buying, selling and trading of carbon emissions. Under this new economic system the nation of Japan is unable to recover after a series of environmental catastrophes leaving them no option except turn to the atlas corporation for help.

The atlas corporation has chosen to build the walled city of atlas and abandon the rest of the country to be reclaimed by nature. Years later the people atlas has abandoned to fend for themselves outside the walled city want in by any means necessary. Destined to lead these desperate people is a rambunctious teenage girl armed with a boomerang and together they will learn that not everything is as it seems.

The animation is top notch, the characters range from quirky to endearing, the story is intriguing and engrossing with an excellent English dub making this series a must own for any anime fan!

6242929,2,B00HXEWG4E,"It's unusual these days to find a 26 episode anime that isn't divided into two distinct seasons, but Shangri-La does.  Unfortunately, the show really doesn't seem to have enough plot for that many episodes and really drags on.  The characters are flat and boring, downer elements are suddenly thrust on the viewer without warning, the villains are villainous for no appreciable reason, meh.

6242956,5,B00HXEWG4E,"Shangri-La is one of those series that, though fairly new, will always be overlooked by series such as One Piece or Attack on Titan. In spite of all that, it is quite possibly one of the best anime series I have ever seen in my entire life.

The Story
Shangri-La's story is one that has been told multiple times in the anime universe, but Shangri-La tells it in such a way, that it seems entirely new. If I had to describe Shangri-La, I'd say it has the same overgrown, toxic forests of Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, and has the evil army/government of Origin: Spirits of the Past, searching for this one important girl. Despite it's borrowed narrative, it is still a great series that deserves to be watched. Now as far as age rating goes, I'd recommend ages 15 and up.  It has a well deserved TV-MA rating, as it contains nudity, mature sexual content/themes, language, and violence and some blood/gore. Even with all of it's mature content, it's still not as adult as series like Speed Grapher or Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne, so it could be viewed by slightly younger audiences.

Now, about this particular S.A.V.E. Edition....
This is the S.A.V.E. Edition of the Gods. It is what all S.A.V.E. editions should strive to be. I'm not even kidding. While my own copy hasn't arrived yet, I have seen the same edition elsewhere, and I must admit, I was entirely surprised. If you're not familiar with S.A.V.E. Edition DVD's/Blu-Ray's, they are normally in a standard DVD or Blu-Ray case depending on the format, wrapped up with a hideous, booger-green border on the side, which reads S.A.V.E. and all the other stuff about how this edition is great for your wallet and whatnot. Well, this edition was a nice surprise indeed. Originally, I considered picking this up in parts, being Limited Edition Part 1 and then Part 2, thereby allowing me to get the gorgeous chipboard box. When I saw the actual S.A.V.E. edition, I was surprised to see that it was THE EXACT SAME as buying the first two parts, with a Limited Edition Part 1. In other words, you were ripped off if you picked up the first two parts separately. If you want the best deal, go with the S.A.V.E. version of Shangri-La, and you shouldn't be disappointed.

All in all, this is a great series that deserves to be watched, and this edition is a steal. If you're interested in a story that is somewhat similar to Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind or Origin: Spirits of the Past, then this is probably for you. I myself, highly recommend it.",1401667200,24,2506,4.587053571428571
6242957,5,B00HXEWG4E,"I posted a pretty grumpy review when Funimation first released this series (first half was over $60!!!, second half was around $40).  The prices were outrageous for a 24 episode series ($100+ with both sets combined).  So here is why I am laughing all the way home:

The S.A.V.E. set I received is actually a repackaged version of the Volume 1 Special Edition with Volume 2 inserted into it.  I know this because the set has the Special Edition case and the first volume does not have a UPC.  The second volume does have a UPC.  The entire thing was covered with a SAVE paper that was easily removed.  Now I have the deluxe set case with the complete series for FIFTEEN BUCKS!!!

So now is a great time to nab this underrated series.

The story is great, albeit a bit confusing at times.  It's based off a two part light novel (which I haven't read) but I feel that they probably fleshed out a bit more of the story (considering No. 6 was 11 episodes based on a 9 volume light novel series).

The story is set mid to late 21st century.  Global warming has wreaked havoc on the planet.  The new 'capitalism' involves trading carbon credits (pollution).  There are areas of massive jungles in order to absorb carbon.  Tokyo is one of these so called ""jungle-polises"".

The story revolves around several central characters.  Kuniko is the main heroine, though many other characters receive nearly as much screen time.  She joins a band of rebels called 'Metal Age' whose goal is to overthrow the Atlas Corporation, a company that has control over the military, the legal system, and even commerce.

Several of the themes are typical for any future-dystopian anime series, but the characters are what make this series interesting.  Kuniko's 'adult figurehead', Momoko, is actually a cross dressing man.  Her grandmother raised her, but Momoko is definitely a 'mothering' personality.  Ryoko is a very interesting female villain, and head of Atlas Corp, Sayoko is a clairvoyant young girl who puts liars to death, and Karin (my favorite) is a super genius young girl who creates a computer program (MEDUSA) in order to control the world economy - and Atlas is not amused.

If you enjoy anime, or just good, complex dystopian stories, then this is a great purchase.  It is one of the best deals Funimation has offered.  This and Mushi-shi (also S.A.V.E.).  Get it now while the getting is good!",1401148800,,2388,4.721549636803874

8637175,5,B00HXEWG4E,"This anime will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The rating is MA because of the language and mild nutty and violence.
When I started to watch the anime I wasn't sure if I was going to like.it or not. I gave it a chance and soon there after I found myself being drawn into the story and wanting to keep watching. The artwork I find to be very well done and the characters well developed. If you want a story that will keep you coming back to find out what happens in the next episode, this one will fill the bill. The price I paid was worth it. A very good value for the current price. If you have an anime collection, you will want this title to be one of them. You can watch and watch again and you will not be board with it.

8637179,5,B00HXEWG4E,"This anime was excellent with a few, ""that doesn't make sense"" parts. To start with the negatives, the lead protagonist apparently can jump off buildings without suffering a single bruise and fly thousands of feet in the air without falling to her death. The physical rules were inconsistent and seemed to change specifically for the MC's benefit, which was distracting.

The storyline became a bit bizarre and was somewhat rushed the last couple of episodes. The ending was interesting but rather confusing when one considers all the scientific activities occurring in the world.

With all that said, the anime makes up where it falters in it's lovable, amusing and downright endearing characters. The story, despite it's faults, was epic to say the least, and was enjoyable from start to finish. Plot development and character development were both well done with minor flaws in mind and best of all, the anime is really cheap for a 24 episode anime. Overall, the anime was a great purchase.",1499817600,,993,5.012121212121212
