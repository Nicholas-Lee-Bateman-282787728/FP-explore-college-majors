8229694,3,B000XTSWCQ,"Having practiced yoga for 11 years now, I still find it difficult to really get the full experience out of a yoga video/DVD.  Maybe it's the fact that the phone doesn't always get shut off or the teacher isn't present to push me when I'm not expressing a pose to my full potential.

Aras's ""Yoga for Health and Wellness"" did a great job of capturing my attention for the full hour plus practice.  Starting out with a couple simple stretches, he wasted no time getting into a warming flow of sun salutations.  From there, he moved into some more challenging poses, going back and forth at times between standing and seated poses.  Even the 10 minute meditation at the end of the practice following the savasana which I didn't think I'd be into, proved to be a really relaxing, nice addition to the practice.  Overall, this was a solid yoga practice for the intermediate yoga student.

A couple of observations: Aras spends the first couple minutes before starting the practice talking to camera about his start with yoga.  He talks about feeling self-conscious at not being able to do everything that the other students could do when he started out and then coming to the realization that he had to be ok with where his own practice was and let the rest come.  I felt a bit like he was talking to the beginner yogi with this speech and then was a bit surprised that the practice was not at all for a beginner.  There was very little instruction about the actual poses and even less attention paid to the areas of the body on which to focus.  For the experienced yogi, this is fine because the poses were very common for someone that has a continuing practice, however for the beginner, this instruction would be more necessary.  At times instruction was also missing about pivoting feet a certain way or bending a knee and I'd have to look at the pose to know what was going on.  The second thing was, alternatives for modifying poses was rarely given.  Again, fine for the practiced yogi, but difficult for a beginner who may not be able to hold a crescent twist.  And lastly, very little mention was made of injuries which I think is important in any practice especially one where the teacher is not present.

Overall, I was very happy with the level of strength building, stretching and variation of poses.  I appreciated that he spend time on core strengthening as well as stretching.  Aras had a pleasant speaking voice and a very strong looking practice.  He is really good looking too which is always a plus!  I will do this practice again....especially when I don't have time to go to a live class.  It was time well spent and I felt great afterwards.",1212796800,2,2658,4.565400843881856

The Warm-Up begins on the floor for some gentle leg stretches, cat/cow, and bird/dog before gradually moving to standing for a total of 4A and 4B sun salutations.  Chapter 2 begins with one additional sun salutation B and then moves into a series of forward bending postures.  There are several standing flows, the first of which includes crescent lunge, revolved crescent, standing splits, and half moon.  Next, Aras performs a series which moves from side-to-side, with different versions of wide-legged standing forward bend performed between each side; postures here include warrior 1, warrior 2, triangle, and side angle pose.  This chapter concludes on the floor for squat, bridge, and yogi push-ups.

The third chapter begins with a seated forward bend series which includes both full seated forward bend and head-to-knee pose; also included are Sage 3 twist, cobbler's pose, and additional cat/cow flows.  Finally, there is a hip-opening series of lizard to kneeling hamstring stretch to pigeon.  The final chapter begins with bow pose and a plow/shoulderstand sequence.  Final postures here include fish, reclined twist, and happy babies pose; a 4-minute savasana concludes the physical part of the practice, bringing it in at just over 65 minutes.  However, Aras also includes a 9.5-minute seated meditation.  He states that the intent of this meditation is to focus on relaxing; after taking a few minutes to set it up and provide breath reminders, he allows silence, with the only sounds coming from the soft background music.

A final option on this DVD is the 10-minute (actually 8.5 minutes) strengthening power yoga segment.  For those who enjoy challenging power yoga, this is short and to the point:  Aras begins with quick down dog/up dog flows, repeating several times.  He then transitions into a hold of boat pose while moving the arms quickly in and out; he rests in plow pose and then repeats the sequence several times.

Overall, Aras does a nice job on this DVD.  I am sure that this practice is likely to appeal to many, as Aras's voice is calm and soothing (he's kind of nice to look at, too!), and he includes a nice variety of poses.  However, those who have a wider range of experience with yoga media like myself might be more likely to pass on this DVD in favor of better options available.  Finally, I would not recommend this DVD for those new to yoga, as Aras does not provide enough instruction for true beginners, and he includes some more challenging postures such as standing splits, half-moon, bow, and plow.  This DVD would be more ideally suited to experienced beginners who have taken a few yoga classes or for low intermediates.",1212364800,3,3146,5.073929961089494
8229696,5,B000XTSWCQ,Aras's yoga is so gentle and relaxing.  Yet I still get a nice workout.  Recommend this for beginners and for those who want a work out AND de-stress.,1211760000,5,150,4.321428571428571
8229697,5,B000XTSWCQ,"I loved this yoga DVD! I have been doing yoga since the early 90's, and I have always struggled to find a video which will give me what I want: to be challenged and  entertained. This video was great b/c it did both! I liked the instructor's speed....he wasn't so fast that I was falling behind, but he also didn't put me to sleep. I got a great workout, and felt that he really covered all the bases. This video got my heart going, and really strengthened my muscles as well. I liked this video so much that I actually bought one for my sister, who is a yoga instructor!",1211587200,6,571,4.1909090909090905

Yoga For Overall Health & Wellness
TRP Yoga

Instructor: Aras Baskauskas
Running Time: 90 minutes
Equipment Needed: None
Can You Really Do This In Your Living Room: Yes

""The Weekend Workout For Your Mind, Body & Soul"" is my tag line for Yoga For Overall Health & Wellness instructed by Aras Baskauskas.

This program is truly about ""me time"" as it works not only with working on the physical body, but also in connecting the mind and body, enhancing your awareness of what exactly you are doing with each move and how it is helping both your muscles and your overall well being.

I do not consider myself a ""Yoga Person,"" nor am I one to meditate. In this program I found the transitions from the physical demands to the mental focus to be seamless and physically rewarding in the sense that they became one, and even in the quiet moments of meditation I felt the physical rewards of the exercise that most of us crave.

This workout is both relaxing and physically challenging at the same time.

An added bonus with many Yoga moves, as I understand it, is that they do help a great deal in keeping things moving on our insides. Yoga workouts can be great in assisting with our organ function, and keeping our skin glowing, and our nails and hair growing.

Aras is clear and straight forward in his instruction and provides you with the time to go from one move to the next with ease.

The TRP Yoga, Yoga For Overall Health & Wellness is a program for beginning to intermediate yoga practitioners who already have a good, healthy fitness routine in place. This is a Five-Star DVD Workout.
