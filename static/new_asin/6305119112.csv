967434,5,6305119112,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer epitomizes everything about what entertainment should be.  It is a show with insightful plots, and wonderfully developed characters.  These videos offer a person the chance to enjoy the fantastic  gift to entertainment that is Buffy.",913593600,,258,5.564102564102564
967595,4,6305119112,"If you are a fan of the series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, you will definitely like all that you can get.  I missed most of it when it was on television many years ago, but have found that I have never outgrown either this series or Angel which went pretty much hand in hand,",1376179200,,273,4.055555555555555
967596,5,6305119112,"I was so disappointed when I realized this wasn't actually available. I only write this review to lend my support for this release.

I stumbled on this series one day when I was bored and looking for something to watch, six years after the seventh season had already ended. It looked a little silly, but it got high praise from random internet folk and I thought I'd give it a shot.

I downloaded the first season and just couldn't stop watching. I flew through the first 12 episodes within three days(about 45 minutes each episode, no commercials) and immediately downloaded the rest of the series. I ended up falling in love with each and every character. Buffy, Joyce, Xander, Willow, Oz, Giles, Angel, Faith, Spike, Cordelia, Anya, etc... even Dawn... All of them. I was so sad when it finally ended, but I enjoyed every step of the way.

After it ended I went to purchase the blu-ray to re-watch this wonderful show in glorious HD, only to find it's unavailable anywhere. I understand there are difficulties, and it's important that whoever remasters this needs it to be worth their while, but I for one am willing to pay (almost!) anything for a quality blu-ray release of one of my favorite shows of all time",1373760000,2,1215,4.641860465116279

967903,5,6305119112,I saw a recent magazine list a couple episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer as being one of the top 20 TV series from the last decade. I was not familiar with the show but after a few rentals I bought the set. Watching how each actor handles their fears and aspirations and the need to conform as their lives change from HS to college draws you into each of the characters. Joss Whedon is a brilliant director and his actors hold no punches with their emotions as they transition to adulthood. A must see TV series that has turned into a cult classic.,1277510400,4,550,4.298076923076923

Buffy fans are going nowhere, but we are getting older.  Buffy fans love the heart of the show, not cold facts and figures. This makes us loyal in a way thats unique, and it is never a fleeting connection.  Price isn't even a consideration.

One day, my kids will watch these blu rays and love them and you know why?, becuase Blu Rays need less love to live longer then Dvds.  Also if they don't proclaim their love for the show they don't eat.  Come on Fox, it's time to make it up to us for your 'reorder' of firefly.",1269475200,24,689,4.142857142857143

Also some added extra's would always be nice, like a full BTVS/Angel history timeline (with individual timelines for each of the main characters, and showing where they crossover).

And to anyone asking for a WIDESCREEN version, this is impossible since the original footage used was 4:3 aspect ratio. To force a ""widescreen"" would mean you would be loosing part of the image. Joss Whedon spoke of this on one of the series dvd's (paper insert).",1242086400,3,564,4.755102040816326

Like others, I would also love to see it in widescreen format, but I've heard there may be issues there (e.g., cameras, props, etc in the frame that wouldn't be seen in the 4:3 ratio but would in widescreen); however, with today's technology I am quite sure that could all be cleaned up.  Please Joss give your fans what they really want!  Would also like to see Angel released similarly.  Finally, I can't be the only one hoping that Joss is considering a full budget movie release that combines the Buffy and Angel series and brings a final closure to both series and brings Buffy and Angel together for good.  It's time to bring back Buffy, Angel, Spike, Willow, Xander, Giles, Fred, Wesley et al for one final curtain call!  Well, one can hope...",1235174400,31,889,4.666666666666667

Enhanced effects scenes or changes in the aspect ratio would just be a bonus.  I can't tell you how great this BD would be, after all these years this show is still the best.

Angel on BD wouldn't hurt either. :)",1234051200,6,397,4.064102564102564
967911,5,6305119112,"One of the greatest television series ever ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" would be perfect for a high definition re-release. The series was mainly filmed on 35 mm film which makes a great source for an HD transfer. Hopefully the producers won't wait to long to get a Buffy blu-ray out. I'm just wondering if they are going to start with season 1, which was filmed on 16 mm. Well, I think with Buffy's cult following a blu-ray - no matter which season - would definitely be a hit. I for one would buy it immediately without hesitation.",1232236800,6,530,4.474226804123711

968047,3,6305119112,"I bought the Chosen Collection for around 200. If you're a casual fan, then maybe Eight is Enough. But, ultimately, it's a better deal to just buy the show in a larger package, since buying them 8 at a time will cost you over 400 (about 144 eps in all, I believe) , in the end. (Yes, I realize that logic only works if the person intends to buy the entire show piecemeal.) You'd be better off, though, picking you're fave season and buying it cheap somewhere. But, you can't really go too wrong buying the set, especially if you're an interested novitiate to the Whedon-verses, and this will be a good introduction.",1151971200,11,615,4.451327433628318
968048,4,6305119112,"For ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Spike - Love Is Hell"" there were only four choice episodes from ""BtVS"" focusing on everybody's favorite vampire with a bloody chip in his head.  But Joss Whedon and the folks at Mutant Enemy have doubled down for this eclectic collection of episodes.  You might expect these episodes to focus on the Slayer, but despite her face on the box that is not the case.  Consequently, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Curse of the Hellmouth"" consists of two DVDs offering up eight select episodes of the late lamented cult television series and a special featurette, ""Buffy, the Fear Inside,"" which offers Whedon, David Greenwalt, Nicholas Brendon and Anthony Stewart Head as the talking heads providing insights and lesser revelations.  As for the eight episodes, here is what you get:

Episode 6 of Season 1, ""The Pack"" (Written by Matt Kiene & Joe Reinkemeyer) is really a Xander episode, except that Xander is possessed by the predatory sprit of a hyena along with some other Sunnydale High troublemakers.  You would think from the title of this set that you would have the pilot episode ""Welcome to the Hellmouth,"" but you would be wrong.  Besides, it is already available separately if you want to have it and this collection without the entire run of ""BtVS"" on DVD (4 Stakes).

Episode 6 of Season 2, ""Halloween"" (Written by Carl Ellsworth) is a fun episode where Buffy spends most of it as an 18th-century maiden, Willow becomes a ghost, and this time Xander is a army soldier (4.5 Stakes).

Episode 17 of Season 2, ""Passion"" (Written by Ty King) is the classic episode where Angelus kills Jenny.  This is one of the best Giles episodes especially in the final act where he goes after Angelus (5 Stakes).

Episode 9 of Season 3, ""The Wish"" (Written by Marti Noxon) takes us to a Sunnydale where Buffy Summers never showed up.  This is Cordelia's wish and it is granted by the vengeance demon Anyanka.  However it is the vampire version of Willow that steals this one.  The only bad news is that ""Dopplegangland"" is not included in the set as well (4.5 Stakes).

Episode 12 of Season 3, ""Helpless"" (Written by David Fury) finds Buffy turning 18 and facing a stupid Watches Council test where she has to face a vampire striped of her powers.  Also known as the episode where Giles gets fired (4.5 Stakes).

Episode 4 of Season 4, ""Fear Itself"" (Written by David Fury) is the second classic Halloween episode from ""BtVS"" where a party at a fraternity turns into a real house of horrors where Gachnar the Fear Demon feeds on their fears.  Also known as the episode where we learn of Anya's fear of bunnies (4.5 Stakes).

Episode 10 of season 4, ""Hush"" (Written by Joss Whedon for his one Emmy nomination for writing on the show) is the classic episode where the Gentlemen come to Sunnydale and steal everybody's voices.  Consequently, most of the episode is done without dialogue.  Also known as the one where Riley finds out about Buffy (and Buffy finds out about Riley) and where Willow meets Tara (5 Stakes-plus).

Episode 3 of Season 7 (Written by Jane Espenson) suddenly skips ahead to the final season of the show as Willow returns from England and Buffy, Xander, and Dawn go to the airport to pick her up.  But they miss each other because of a spell that works in favor a flesh-eating demon (4 Stakes).

On balance most of these episodes are well worth having (the first and last ones are the weakest of the eight) and I guess they all show what life is like on the Hellmouth.  But then what episodes of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" do not?  Of course most fans of the show already have its seven seasons on DVD, even if they were waiting for ""The Slayer Collection"" to have it all in one box rather than seven.  So I suspect this is the sort of gift fans will give to get others hooked.  Having both Halloween episodes and ""Hush"" are strong points, but much of what is here plays on your knowledge of the characters, so you might have to spend a lot of time explaining why things are so funny.",1133654400,53,4021,4.593837535014005
968049,5,6305119112,"Though not fully complete as there is one more season to come where all is wrapped up, ""Buffy"" has undergone quite a long road during the first six seasons.  Each episode had its own arc and plot points that sometimes were more important than they appear at first.  There was no truely 'bad' episode, as each contributed to the overall arc for the season and the story they wanted to tell.  Yet even the seasons aren't modular, as the show itself had a much wider story arc which started in Season One, Episode One, and ends in the Series Finale of Season Seven.
Season One:  This introduces Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) into the quirky town of Sunnydale, located directly above a 'Hellmouth,' which is a center for demonic activity.  The character was first introduced in a movie by the same name, but gladly, this season is actually taken more seriously.  Buffy, with the help of Xander (Nicholas Brendan), Willow (Allison Hannigan), and her Watcher Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), must protect the town from The Master, an ancient Vampire.  Season One originally debuted mid-season, and thus is the shortest of all the seasons.
Season Two: Introduces Spike (James Marsters), a british vampire who blasts into Sunnydale one night.  Angel (David Boreanaz), Buffy's Vampiric love intrest with a soul, loses it after a moment of pure joy.  Buffy must make the hard choice to save the world by sacrificing the one she loves.
Season Three: A new slayer in town, Faith (Eliza Dushku) goes bad and joins up with the mayor of Sunnydale to destroy the world by having the Mayor ascend to true demon status.  The scholars of Sunnydale High must fight for their diplomas as they graduate from high school.
Season Four: Freshman year at college and different life choices abound.  Spike returns only to be captured by the military and made docile by a computer chip inserted into his brain.  What other secrets are hidden behind closed doors?
Season Five: Bring many boxes of tissues for this season, with the death of two main characters, both done very well, you will be sure to cry.  A Hell Goddess searches for a 'Key' whom is given to Buffy in the form of her new sister, Dawn (Michelle Trachtenburg).
Season Six:  ""Life is the Big Bad.""  Buffy, risen from the grave by her friends who later come to find that she did not go to a hell dimension as they had feared, but Heaven.  This season is marked by the fact that the one trying to end the world is one of the four who started the show, our lovable to dark nemesis is a trio of nerdy kids, and how Buffy learns to live with life ""post-postmortem"".  Bring more tissues with the loss of another, and a season finale shocker to setup the start of Season Seven, this season is the dark before the light at the end of the tunnel.
Season Seven is scheduled at this time to be released to DVD in the Fall of 2004.
Though not truely complete, this item is good if you have not yet had the chance or opportunity to purchase any of the other seasons yet and want to save a bundle of money by purchasing the first six at once then later getting the final season when it comes out.  I recommend this series for anyone who even remotely likes a good story, just remember, it is just that:  ""A Great Story"".  Congratulations to Joss Whedon, Creator, for a job wonderfully done!",1087171200,,3310,4.568527918781726
968189,4,6305119112,"With the DVD of Season 1 out, this is a true collector's item.
Treasure it, it's going to be worth a lot.",1045958400,,105,3.8181818181818183
968190,4,6305119112,"Not the most coherent introduction to the show  -  which could have been thematically smoother by including all the primary episodes composing the story arc of the Slayer's first nemesis, The Master  -  but still a good selection.  The three most important story and character establishing episodes are present, ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" and ""The Harvest"" comprising the single story with all the pertinent exposition (and fabulously presented, at that), and ""Angel"" introducing Buffy's most important ""significant other"" and eventual greatest foe.
The other three episodes are more of a grab-bag, but at least one or two of them are sure to please.  ""Never Kill A Boy On the First Date"" is pretty standard fare, hardly an extraordinary episode but at least a good and satisfying one.  Buffy first deals with the sad fact that she will never have ""a normal life,"" given her unique calling, gaining and losing a boyfriend in a single action-packed night and ending with a touching bonding scene with Giles, her Watcher and moral support.
""The Witch"" is quite good, the show's first attempt to prove it could survive without overdoing the vampires.  It's a cleverly written piece, with a few genuine surprises and chills.  One of the Buffy series' virtues is the ability to dramatize darker realities in metaphor  -  there was a time that the suggestion of a jealous mother murdering her daughter's cheerleading competition would have been considered absurd, but of course those missed days of innocence are now long gone.
""The Puppet Show"" is a popular favorite of many of the show's fans, pulling a clever variation on the theme of the schizophrenic ventriloquist/living dummy routine.  It has some of the series' most sparkling character interplay and humorous moments, and a few rather gruesome ones as well.  Sarah Michelle Gellar has one of her funniest lines ever, in the opening teaser:  beholding a classmate performing with his ventriloquist's dummy at a talent show audition, she mutters, ""I hate dummies.  Ever since I was a kid, I hated them.""  Everyone looks at her, she realizes they're looking, and she remarks, anticlimactically, ""There's no story, here.  I just don't like them, that's all.""
There are better episodes from the first season, and episodes more cohesive in a single story arc.  But these choices are all still quite good, and a suitable ""welcome to the hellmouth""  -  for newbies to the series, as well as old fans.",1020902400,5,2446,5.022332506203474
968191,5,6305119112,"This is a very good set. It includes all of the first Buffy videos.

The videos have:

""Welcome To The Hellmouth"" It is Buffy's first day at her new school. You get to watch Buffy make all new friends. The Master, a powerful vampire, is gathering his dark forces to destroy the human race. Buffy meets a guy named Angel.

""The Harvest"" The Master tries to raise power by sending vampires to kill innocent people. When they feed off of humans, the vampires give The Master strength. It's up to Buffy to keep the human race from being destroyed.

""The Witch"" Weird things start happening in Sunnydale. Then Buffy realizes that there is a witch on the loose who is casting dangerous spells.

""Never Kill A Boy On The First Date"" Buffy meets a boy she likes. She wants a normal life. She goes out with the guy instead of helping Giles and he nearly gets killed.

968192,4,6305119112,"I thoroughly enjoyed my introduction into the Buffyverse especially since I did not start watching the show until well into its third season.  It was great fun seeing the characters interact and get to know each other as they battled the creatures of the dark.  With this video I get to track the development of the Slayer, the Scooby gang, and everyone's favorite Watcher/Librarian, Giles. Can't wait to get my hands on another boxed set.",1010707200,,439,4.84
968193,5,6305119112,"Where to begin?  The series has often been scoffed at for its title, but here 'Buffy' is again proving itself to be one of the most intelligent, thought-provoking and emotional pieces of dramatic work on television.  In the two episodes here we see Buffy's forays into the darker side of her nature, the Slayer side of her nature that was to become a bigger feature later on.  Faith's always been a bit of an outsider, someone who refuses to let herself be constrained by society's rules.  She's exciting and before long is tempting Buffy away from her friends.
Basically what we have here is the allure of evil.  In this episode it's not a demon or a vampire but herself that Buffy is fighting.  The scenes at the end show that the dark that is so evident in Faith is also right there in Buffy.  Not only is Buffy seen to come off the rails a little but is also given a glimpse at Faith's life, the fact that evil may be attractive but what does it lead to?  The series steered away from conventiality here by suggesting that Buffy isn't the perfect girl after all, she's not the goody-two-shoes that she might seem.  Unlike any other series before it, 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' has human characters, ones that change and grow as time passes.  Whilst obviously having links to a teenager getting in with a 'bad crowd', this also a forbidding tone by suggesting that the Slayer's power is rooted in darkness, that evil needs to be fought to rid yourself of the image of what could be you.
Besides all the drama though, there is a nice touch of humanity in all this.  The audience is made to feel sympathetic towards Faith, a character that is dangerously close to the edge.  In creating a fantasy show that not only embraces various genres - comedy, drama, tragedy - but also imbues itself with a realistically human feel to it, 'Buffy' beats other shows hands down.  This two-parter is yet more evidence of this, containing every element of a TV show that anyone could ever want.",1010620800,2,1981,4.530898876404494
968194,5,6305119112,"Anybody who thought this new series based on the disastrous 1992 movie would be more of the same, were in for a big shock. Creator Joss Whedon gave television his vision. The way he had originally wanted Buffy from the beginning. What was to come was a series that would change the T.V. genre. The series was much darker and deeper, with a touch of great, intelligent humor. It gave T.V. a boost. This 3 tape 6 episode collection starts off with monumental episodes from the first season. The first tape is ""Welcome To The Hellmouth"" and ""The Harvest"". These are 2 episodes, but were put together as a 2 hour debut movie. It sets up the series and characters. Buffy Summers(Sarah Michelle Gellar), a vampire slayer, comes to Sunnydale, CA. She learns that the school is on top of a mystical portal called the Hellmouth. A mystical portal that draws all the weird things and happenings to town. The school librarian Giles(Anthony Stewart Head), is her watcher. She befriends geeky Willow(Alyson Hannigan), Cool loser Xander(Nicholas Brendon), and snobby, prissy queen of the school Cordelia(Charisma Carpenter). She also meets shadowy, strange Angel(David Boreanaz). This first tape consists of the Master, the oldest vampire, trying to break free from his prison underground. It's a great set up for the series. The second tape has ""The Witch"" and ""Never Kill A Boy On The First Date"". ""Witch"" is about Buffy wanting to join the cheerleading team as a powerful witch tries to do away with the squad. The second one is a pretty average episode. Buffy tries to date Owen, the same night a big vampire prophecy is going to happen. ""Witch"" is standard stuff, but a real eye catcher, if you know what I mean. The third tape features ""Angel"" and ""The Puppet Show"". ""Angel"" is a very pivotal, important episode. This episode shows us who Angel really is and changes the relationship between him and Buffy forever. A great episode with dynamic writing and acting. ""The Puppet Show"" is routine stuff about the school talent show and Buffy seeing a student's dummy come to life. I won't tell anymore. These 6 episodes don't all follow the season's story arc, which is about the Master. The cast showcased instant chemistry in the very first episode. A tight bunch of characters and acting on television. The writing is phenomenal. Funny, Meaningful, powerful. Great stuff. This is a show that re-defined T.V. horror. Anything that follows can't possibly be as good as Buffy. Buy these!.",1010275200,10,2476,4.869668246445498
968195,5,6305119112,"Looking back at the earliest 'Buffy' episodes, it's always hard not to get at least a little bit nostalgic.  These two episodes are stand-alone ones, not really anything to do with the main story arc.  That doesn't mean to say that they're not wonderful fun though.  In a way, it's these episodes just as much as the big ones that make it.  In these earlier years, the show was new and exciting.  It's blend of action with drama and comedy made it a slow but undeniable hit with British and American audiences.
'Witch' sees the introduction of Amy Madison, who was later to feature prominently in episodes such as 'Bewitched, Bewildered and Beautiful' and 'Gingerbread'.  The supernatural intrigue story may seem old but it's the way it's told which makes 'Buffy' such a winner.  There's pop culture references which punctuate the punchy dialogue and some hilarious comedy made from Buffy's formidable strength as she throws one cheerleader across the room whilst trying out a new routine.
In 'Never Kill A Boy On The First Date', the audience gets to meet shy quiet Owen who has a penchant for Emily Dickinson and Buffy.  Here a nightmare date brings a whole new quality to it, with the night ending at the Sunnydale Funeral Home.
It's strange looking back because we know what's to come for the characters that we have grown to love.  We know the fates of Angel, Joyce and Buffy.  We know that shy retiring Willow becomes something else entirely.  In this the show has really broken all expectations.  It's managed to give its characters dimension without it appearing ludicrous.  Looking back only goes to show how much they've changed in not only a realistic but also a touching way.",1008460800,5,1687,4.775862068965517
968196,5,6305119112,"With 100 episodes already aired and the new series currently being broadcast, this TV show has only gone from strength to strength.  But whatever you think about the later series, there's no denying that 'Becoming' parts 1 and 2 make for fantastic watching.  Here we see in full evidence what Joss Whedon managed to create: a show that seems to be aimed at teens but actually has a lot more to it, a gothic-fantasy-comi-tragedy masterpiece.
In this episode Angelus plans the end of the world when he finds the tomb of the demon Acathla.  Buffy has to keep her romantic feelings for the vicious killer under wraps and stop him before Acathla can destroy the world.  Sounds silly doesn't it?  Well, what most people don't realise is the genius of 'Buffy'.  It uses overexaggeration to demonstrate the true trauma of adolescense, a horror unto itself.  Here it literally is the end of the world when Buffy's boyfriend doesn't want her anymore.  He changes, only literally.
Among this we also get a fantastic fight between Buffy and Xander, Kendra's return and some dramatic outbursts.  There are some fantastic scenes, such as when Buffy's mother finds out about her 'identity'.  We get mom on the side asking her daughter if she's 'tried not being a slayer' and the mutual frustration at loving one another but quite understanding each other.  Then there's the end, which will blow the audience away.  The acting from all concerned (but particularly Gellar and Boreanaz) is excellent, as we are led to a tragic conclusion.  Sarah McLachlan's 'Full Of Grace' perfectly fits the end.
All in all, a real winner.",1008374400,2,1606,4.860294117647059
968197,5,6305119112,"Enemies - Here we see Faith in her quest to steal Angel's soul.  Or is it that simple?  Eliza Dushku's consistently brilliant performance as troubled Faith is especially brilliant here as she first conveys sorrow at Angel's rejection of here sexual advances and later taking solace in her villainous streak.  This episode is also notable because we get to see Angelus again, which is always a treat.  Obviously, there's no need to mention Sarah Michelle Gellar, who is outstanding as ever in her reaction to Angel's conversion.  All three principal actors are particularly mesmerising in a pull-the-rug-from-under-you endings.
Earshot - This controversial episode was pulled in the U.S. due to its similarities to the Columbine Massacre.  It's one of the best 'Buffy' episodes made - Jane Espenson is a true genius - as Buffy's new 'gift' to read minds is first used for humour before she's let into the trauma and insecurities of the entire school.  It's totally involving, with several essentially supporting roles being given a full character with a matter of lines.  Danny Strong as Jonathan is good value also, as the spurned geek.  Plus, the ultimate message - that everyone, be they pretty, popular, or athletic, experience pain - doesn't seem cheesy.",1007856000,2,1258,5.097560975609756

Buffy has already been slaying vampires for some time as ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" begins and, after adults perceive her actions as part of a violent attitude, she moves to Sunnydale to start her life over.  Despite Buffy's determination to retire from slaying, the new watcher Giles convinces her of Sunnydale's proxmity to the Hellmouth and the importance of fighting the Master.

Also, the story introduces Buffy's mother, Joyce, and her first meeting with the mysterious Angel.

968289,5,6305119112,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer became an immediate cult hit when it started airing in 1996. With slyly funny dialogue and a passel of superb actors to carry the show, it shows no sign of slowing down. This boxed set is the perfect way to learn about the world of Buffy.
""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" is the series premiere, and the first half of a two-part episode. It introduces Buffy, a normal teen who happens to be a vampire slayer; Giles, her Watcher and the high school librarian; the sweet, computer-savvy Willow and slacker Xander, Buffy's best friends; Cordelia, queen of acerbic zingers; and Angel, whose eventual elevation to Buffy's boyfriend comes as a surprise to no one. ""The Harvest"" features the thwarting of the evil Master's plan to unleash the apocalypse (or rather, an apocalypse; there are multiple attempts in the course of the series to bring forth hell on earth).
""The Witch"" features the first non-vampire baddie, when gawky Amy (who returns later in the series) is suspected of using witchcraft to win a place on the cheerleading squad. And the enjoyable ""Never Kill a Boy on the First Date"" shows what happens when Buffy tries to have a normal life -- she ends up dragging her date to a funeral home!
""Angel"" reveals the mysterious man's secret: he's a vampire! (As if it hadn't been obvious from the very beginning.) But a good vampire -- a Gypsy curse left him with a soul. Finally, the set ends with ""The Puppet Show,"" which may not be important in the larger storyline, but is immensely enjoyable. It revolves around ventriloquist's dummy Sid -- is he alive? is he killing people? This episode's twist is particularly enjoyable, and chances are you won't see it coming.
My only gripe with this boxed set is that they didn't see fit to include ""Prophecy Girl,"" the season finale where Buffy is killed (albeit briefly) by the Master, rather than ""The Puppet Show."" At least the latter episode is entertaining in its own right.
Anyone wanting to familiarize themselves with the Slayer backstory will do well to get this boxed set.",991094400,,2050,4.76123595505618

968292,5,6305119112,"In ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" Buffy Summers moves to Sunnydale in the wake of that unfortunate incident where the gym burned down (an allusion to the climax of the film version, which you certainly do not need to see to appreciate these episodes).  She yearns for a normal life, but suddenly she is confronted with a new Watcher, a mysterious dark stranger named Angel, and the  little known fact that Sunnydale is located on the Hellmouth, a demon portal of the first order.  At the present time the big bad in town is the Master, a vampire lord trapped below and waiting for his time to rise up, kill the Slayer, destroy the human race, etc.  However, the most important element for redefining Whedon's vision is the creation of the Scooby Gang of Willow, Xander and (later) Cordelia.  The master metaphor here is that High School is Hell, and it is the Scoobies that help bring that out the most and gives the Buffy storyline added depth.
""The Harvest"" picks up right where Part One left off, with Buffy about to get the bite from Luke, the Master's right hand vamp.  The title refers to a rather special night where the Master selects a vessel who will go out and feed upon the Sunnydale night life with all that power being transferred to the big bad guy trapped down below.  The mystery of Angel is played out a bit more, but the most important thing is that this is merely round one in what would prove to be a season long battle between the Slayer and the Master.
Joss Whedon did not like the campy twist his script was given in the theatrical version of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" and this two-part pilot episode for the television series reaffirms the correctness of his original twist on the girl who beats up the monsters that attack her in the dark alleyway.

Fortunately, Joss Whedon has been more selective in his collections for seasons two and three.
""Angel,"" written by David Greenwalt, really completes the initial set up for the series as Buffy learns that the mysterious man in her life is not only a vampire, but also a vampire with a soul.  What a difference a kiss can make.

In ""The Witch"" we meet Amy Madison, who is currently known to Buffy viewers as Willow's pet white rat.  However, at this point she is just another girl trying out for the Sunnydale High Cheerleading squad along with Buffy and Cordelia.  This is one of those early episodes that does acknowledge the original feature film as background for the series.  Of course this is Sunnydale, so we are not surprised when one of the girls spontaneously bursts into flames during the tryouts.  Eventually our attention is drawn to Amy, who is pretty uncoordinated but whose mother really, really, REALLY wants her to be on the sqaud.  Every time something bad happens to another one of the girls, Buffy and Amy move up the ladder of cheerleading success.  ""The Witch"" is--surprise, surprise--the episode that introduces the occult into the Buffy universe, which has major implications for Willow down the road.

""Never Kill A Boy On The First Date"" does have a marvelous moment where Buffy goes after the bad guy screaming, ""You killed my date!""

Show creator Joss Whedon has made a teenage girl fighting vampires and otherworldly demons into the perfect allegory to a teenage fighting through the perils of high school and growing up.  The show has a dark theme, but doesn't become too heavy or morose as there is a liberal amount of humor mixed in.  The first tape of this three tape set is the show's two part pilot, ""Welcome To The Hellmouth"" & ""The Harvest"" and right from the beginning you can tell that this is a special show.  The show opens with an immediate twist.  A teenage boy and girl are in the high school at night.  There are noises and instead of the girl being afraid, it is the boy.  He wants to leave, but the girl wants to stay.  He gets more and more nervous and for good reason as it turns out the girl is a vampire and she attacks him.  The show flips all conventional stereotypes. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays Buffy Summers with the right amount of attitude.  She is brash, sassy and strong, but she undercuts it with a sense fragility.  Anthony Stewart Head plays her English watcher with comical English indignation and Nicholas Brendon gets many laughs as Xander, the geeky male friend in the gang.  The above two episodes and ""Angel"" are essential watching and the other three are all enjoyable.",978912000,6,1349,4.528925619834711
968426,3,6305119112,"These are two season 1 episodes which early on sets out the intention of the show's creator, Joss Whedon. Even though the most common adversary faced is vampires and each series has an overall theme that is developed during the series in various episodes and a supervillain to be defeated by the end; he also wanted episodes that could stand alone and be a totally self contained story.
Witch (Season 1 episode 3): Those who have seen the feature film would remember Buffy was a cheerleader. In this episode, she decides to give it another go and try out for the team in her new school. However, it becomes very quickly apparent that someone has it in for those trying out as they start to be struck blind, dumb and spontaneously combust. It's a very exciting episode and with a very good twist just everyone thinks they've worked it all out and quite an action packed finale in a race against the clock. This is a hallmark of the show, many episodes have surprises that come completely out of nowhere. Also, as part of the episode, the recurring characters are further developed with Xander in love with the oblivious Buffy, Willow in love with the oblivious Xander and Cordelia being set up as someone the group is going to continually cross swords with. These situations all come to a head in later episodes in season one and later seasons but this is the near the beginning of the various character's relationships. This is another attraction of the show, which progressively develops the characters over the course of several series even in a self contained episode like this one. Over time, all the characters have progressively changed and are quite different in ways but this is what they were like in the beginning.
Never Kill a Boy on the First Date (Season 1 episode 5): This is an episode which ties into the overall theme of the series, that of Buffy's battle with The Master. However, it can be watched as a self-contained episode in its own right, not too much information is required. It also highlights another theme of the show, that of Buffy having to deal with the supernatural on the one hand and growing up, school and dating on the other and the difficulty of trying to keep the two separate.
In this episode, Giles has a warning that a vampire warrior who can help The Master defeat Buffy and they have to try and stop him. Unfortunately the day in question co-incides with a date with the boy of the title, Owen, who has attracted her attention. At first there seems to be no problem with the aforementioned vampire being a no-show but then after thinking it is reasonable to go on a date as nothing is happening, well something happens which ends up with everyone at the Sunnydale Morgue (a place that sees a lot of business), Owen included and fighting for their lives. Then there's the added complication of not letting Owen finding out what's going on at the same time. Not surprisingly, there's a twist in it all.
A good episode, only let down by the poor ending, where after the traumatic events inflicted on a key character in the episode; they come to a conclusion about their experience that is very, very unlikely under the circumstances and in fact you'd think the experience would have lead that character to come to exactly the opposite conclusion. In my opinion, the ending didn't work.
Overall, two good episodes but there is actually an episode in between these two that was televised called
""Teacher's Pet"". You can find out the order of episodes in each season by going to the official site and checking the ""Mortuary"" (where the past episode details are 'buried') section to see where in the scheme of things the episodes on video you are buying fit. It's very easy to find, simply the first name of the lead character of the show, a dot and then com. The fact there is an episode between these when buying the tapes is something you should be aware of.
All twelve episodes of Season 1 are slated for release on DVD in 2001 in at least Zones 1,2 and 4 and now is as good a time as any to invest in a DVD player as Season 1 was one of the best (if not the best) seasons and the opportunity to get the whole series complete and with the quality DVD has to offer is quite appealing. Of course, there's future seasons of this show, the spin-off Angel, not to mention lots of other movies and TV shows that make a DVD player a good investment.
However, two good episodes. Along with ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" and ""The Harvest"" (Season 1 episodes 1&2), that tape and this tape are a good introduction to the show",975974400,7,4551,4.544457978075518

However, the most memorable sequence on this entire tape is when Buffy and Faith are dancing together at the Bronze in ""Bad Girls.""

In ""Enemies,"" written by Douglas Petrie, the Mayor arranges to steal Angel's soul as a way of distracting Buffy.  The plan appears to work, especially when Angelus takes a liking to Faith and the pair begin torturing a captured Buffy.  ""Earshot,"" by Jane Esperson, was the infamous episode that the WB decided not to air the day after the Columbine tragedy.  The plot has to do with Buffy killing a demon and ending up with the power to read minds.  Before all the voices start to drive her insane she hears someone planning to kill everybody at Sunnydale High.  However, the reason the network was nervous about the episode, which Sarah Michelle Gellar picked as one of her favorites because of what it says about surviving the horrors of high school, was Xander's off handed comment about sometimes thiking about opening up on the school with a gun.
""Earshot"" is not really important to the Faith/Mayor story arc but it has to be included because it is a footnote to a national tragedy.  The Vamp Willow episodes of ""The Wish"" and/or ""Doppelgangland"" might be more popular with Buffy fans, but you have to respect Whedon's decision to include these episodes.  Still, it would be nice if they filled in some of the gaps from the first three seasons by having tapes focusing on Willow, Xander, Giles, etc., the same way they do with the paperback novelizations of episodes.",973468800,16,1600,4.709677419354839

It also offers Buffy and Cordelia as cheerleaders, a direction too reminiscent of the original Buffy movie that Joss Whedon wisely abandons.  ""Never Kill a Boy on the First Date"" is a below average Buffy episode with a pretty good title.  Four stars for ""Witch"" and three for ""Never Kill..."" rounded up to a four overall.

968510,5,6305119112,"Let me start off with a simple declaration: ""BECOMING, PART 2,"" IS ONE OF THE TEN BEST TELEVISION EPISODES I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.
Both parts are written and directed by Joss Whedon, who finally received an Emmy nomination for writing this past year because of the changes in who gets to vote on such things.  While we would expect more such nominations for him in the future, this is the apex of Whedon's work on this series.  ""Becoming, Part 1"" sets up the whole experience with Angel's plan to resurrect the demon Acathla and includes several pivotal flashbacks in Angel's life: being turned into a vampire by Darla, being cursed by the Romany people, and coming to L.A. to see Buffy learn she is the Slayer.  The episode ends with Drusilla's attack on the library where Kendra is killed, Willow and Xander badly hurt and Giles kidnapped.  The ""to be continued"" part comes as the police discover Buffy over Kendra's body.
In addition to the stunning climax, ""Becoming, Part 2"" includes other key moments in the series:  Joyce learning her daughter is the slayer, with a hysterical brief conversation between a stunned Joyce and a nervous Spike in the Summers living room; Angel tortures Giles, who finally breaks when Drusilla creates the illusion of Jenny Calendar in his mind, a scene which shows that brutality can be psychological as well as physical; and Willow's possession at the key moment during the spell to restore Angel's soul.  Tragically, it is too late.  Angelus has opened up the portal to hell and the only thing that will stop the end of the world as we know it is the death of the person who pulled out the sword, forcing Buffy to do the unthinkable.
I watch a LOT of television and I have taught Television Criticism courses for a couple of decades and in my ""professional"" opinion Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the best show on television today.  I have described it as operatic and that term best applies to this culmination of the Buffy and Angel/Angelus plot line.  The last act of this episode is a dramatic culmination of all that has come before, contains the best fight sequence (with swords) in a show that prides itself on innovative staging of its fights, and is an ultimately emotionally shattering experience captured beautifully by Sarah Michelle Gellar's slow dissolve into tears while the haunting Sarah McLachlan song ""Full of Grace"" is played. Joss Whedon had set this moment up from the first episode of the series.  It is a payoff usually reserved for the final episode of a series and not simply the end of the second season.  ""Becoming"" is truly an astounding accomplishment in the history of dramatic television.",970790400,13,2668,4.753246753246753
968511,4,6305119112,"""Angel"" is a very pivotal episode from the first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer when Buffy discovers her boyfriend is a vampire with a soul, but ""The Puppet Show"" is a below average one, although the tag sequence is a hoot.

968512,4,6305119112,"This is the first Buffy pack in the series of them to come but I am going  to have to say that this first pack is a 50/50 compared to the already  released second pack which gives you the viewer more of the episodes that  impacted the series compared to this pack. Welcome to the Hellmouth/The  Harvest video is the best tape in the pack because it sets both the mood  and feel of things to come considering that this is the first 2 episodes of  the series. This video supplys more action and story than the other 2  videos do and the villains are far better here than the videos to come. The  Witch/Never Kill A Boy on the First Date is probably the only other video  worth watching in this pack. The Witch is an all right episode but  sometimes lacks the action that the first video supplys but it introduces  us to an enemy thats not a vampire. The other episode on this tape is  probably the better one to watch because it dives right back into the whole  vampires storyline and contures up an enemy that Buffy must deal with in  the beginning of Season 2, this being - The Anointed One. Angel/The Puppet  Show is just like the 2nd tape - It only gives us one episode worth  watching on it. Angel - the episode I'm talking about - reveals to us the  viewers that Angel is in fact a vampire but he has a soul and is on Buffy's  side. The vampire who made Angel a vampire, Darla, is out to eliminate the  slayer but in the end Angel chooses Buffy over Darla and turns her to dust.  The Puppet Show is probably the stupidest episode in this pack of tapes  because for one thing it isn't original and two because it is boring up  until the end when The Scooby Gang finally finds out who is taking out the  talent show students - A Demon who likes Brains. The only thing good about  this episode is that during the credits you get to see Buffy,Xander &  Willow's talent show skit that didn't get to air on the tube. I recommend  this pack to you Buffy fans out their but if you really wan't to enjoy  better episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer I suggest you get the second  video pack - Buffy the Vampire Slayer:The Buffy & Angel Chronicles,  because this is by far the better pack because all the episodes on the 3  tapes in this pack mainly focuse on Angel's return to evil and his  showdowns with Buffy.

968513,5,6305119112,"I was so happy when my Buffy and Angel Gift Pack arrived- three cassettes!  Since I'd only read BTVS books and none of the episodes (no cable), my  expectations for these 6 episodes were quite high. Now, all I have to say  is: It was everything I hoped it would be and more.
The Third and final  part of the Buffy Chronicles contains the `Becoming Part 1' and `Becoming  Part 2' and is dark violet in colour.
In ""Becoming, Part 1', When a stone  sarcophagus is discovered buried near the Hellmouth, Angel, Drusilla and  Spike know they must have it. It contains the petrified body of a demon  killed by a virtuous knight during the Middle Ages. If the demon is  resurrected, he will open a vortex to suck every living thing on earth into  Hell, to suffer eternal torture. Meanwhile, Buffy finds the disk containing  the spell to restore Angel's soul, which raises the question whether to  curse him, or kill him.
In `Becoming, Part 2', Angel captures Giles to  torture him into revealing the secret of resurrecting the demon Acathla and  opening the vortex to Hell. But Spike has other plans, and teams up with  Buffy to prevent the destruction of the world he's grown so fond of. While  Buffy learns the key to the vortex and battles Angelus to stop it from  opening. Willow attempts to restore Angel's soul. But time is quickly  running out.
B & A Chronicles Vol. 3 is the best among the three  volumes. It's shocking to see Kendra killed by Drusilla, Buffy accused of  the murder, Giles kidnapped, and Buffy's mother finding out the truth about  her. The ending swordplay between Angel and Buffy is fantastic and the part  where she sends him to hell (even though he now has a soul), to close the  portal, is heart wrenching. You have to watch it yourself!
I still think  it's better to get the Gift Pack than the individual tapes because the  experience won't be the same. You're worth it so don't cut yourself short.",968025600,3,1921,4.546783625730995

While I initially wanted to know what happened to Pike (who of course  was Buffy's sole peer confidant in the movie)David Boreanaz's Angel grew  very fast on me. I am certain that had Angel been included in the original  movie, he would have 1)looked horrible and 2)done some unconvincing  brooding. The romantic-sexual tension in the Angel episode is done very  well.
I also liked the fact that Buffy had a larger support circle, and  (unlike the movie) was not shunned by the female world once she became  atypical. Willow (and later Cordelia, and Anya)provide evidence that strong  women come from all backgrounds. In most teen dramas, the grungy/punky  Willow would have not been the friend of the still more trendy Buffy.",963619200,,941,4.753086419753086

968600,4,6305119112,"This is where the television series began and picks up more or less
where the movie left off. You can start here, you don't need to have
seen the original movie. All you need to know is that Buffy is the
current slayer and that a slayer is someone given special superhuman
powers that enables them to fight the supernatural in all their
forms.
Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) has been brought from her old
school (in the movie) to the town of Sunnydale by her mother for a new
start, unfortunately it turns out that as luck (or design would have
it), Sunnydale is built on a gate to hell called the Hellmouth. This
sets the premise for the show, in that frequently various monsters are
attracted to the presence of the Hellmouth and cause all kinds of
mayhem each week.
This tape is the first two episodes of the first
series. It introduces and brings the major characters together for the
first time: Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), Buffy's new watcher
and doubling (as cover) as the school librarian, Xander (Nicholas
Brendon) and Willow (Alyson Hannigan), two of the people so far on the
outer of the in crowd they might as well be in another solar system
and Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), very much part of the in crowd and
someone that the rest of the group continually cross swords
with.
This two part opener is fairly straightforward, it introduces
the Season 1 villain, The Master (Mark Metcalf) who is trapped
underground....
...his henchmen led by Luke (Brian Thompson - best known as the
shapeshifting alien bounty hunter from the X-Files) and Darla (Julie
Benz)...
This
is a great start to the television series and it is amazing how the
actors have portrayed their characters so well from the very first
episode. It also sets the tone of the show, in that not only is there
frequent battles with monsters but also having to deal with high
school, classes, the principal and people who just don't like you
because you're not in the 'in crowd' at the same time.
This tape is
a great introduction to the show and makes a great gift to introduce
the show to anyone who hasn't seen it before, with a great mix of
humour and action. ....
Anyway, as I said these two episodes are better than most
movies made and chances are if you like this sort of thing, you will
especially like this.  Hopefully, you will also want to keep following
the show as it is also actually one of the most skillfully written and
insightful shows around at the moment as well.
Highly recommended.",962496000,20,2484,4.594594594594595
968601,5,6305119112,"I like this video the most out of the slayer 3-pack because it contains one of the funniest angel and buffy moments in ""angel."" Angel has been hiding in her bedroom while Buffy was in school. When she comes back,  she sees her diary on the table and freaks out. Accusing him of reading it,  she rambles on that when she called him a hunk in the diary, she meant it  in a bad way and that when she described his eyes as penetrating, she  really meant to write bulgy. I just think this moment was well-written,  which is the norm for the show anyway. In this episode, she discovers that  angel is a vampire but that doesn't really seem to throw her off too much  as buffy and willow discuss a possible relationship with angel. Their first  kiss occurs in this show. ""Puppet show"" was also funny with the  trio forced into participating in the school talent show while trying to  find a murderer. As the end credits roll, you'll see how horrible xander,  willow and buffy are in the talent show. Also, if they can put the whole  1st season of sex in the city on video, they can certainly do the same for  buffy (which is a better show anyway). Or at least produce more videos for  us buffy fans.

I love buffy. she's what i live for. anyway, these videos are to die for! it has ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"", ""The Harvest"", ""Witch"", ""Never Kill a Boy on the first Date"", ""Angel"",and ""The Puppet  Show."" These were the bomb. ""Welcome to the..."" and  ""The Harvest"" introduce Xander and Willow. It also shows Buffy  coming to Sunnydale to start a new life. in ""the witch"", buffy  wants to be a normal life so she tries cheerleading. of course, she's the  slayer so she can't have a very normal life and the cheerleading didn't  work out. The others are just as good as these. I really recommend this  video and the price is a pretty good bargain compared to buying each video  indivisually. that's all i have to say. oh, 1 more thing: buffy rules!",945993600,,785,4.440559440559441

To quote USA  Today's Robert Bianco, it is, quite simply ""the most consistently  entertaining hour on television.""  What could have easily turned into  a self-indulgent camp-fest long ago has gotten better and better because of  its development of characters and the consistently great writing.  Rather  than become a live action version of Scooby Doo with the gang of plucky  kids fighting the monster of the week, the show has come up with  season-long story arcs that allow complex relationships to develop.  Watch  it for a few episodes and even you older viewers will be surprised at how  attached you have become to the characters.  If you don't believe me, look  at any given TV critic's list of the best shows on right now - every one I  have ever seen has the show at or near the top of their list.  This three  pack is a good primer for the 1st season and the episodes in the upcoming  set should catch you up on the basics of the 2nd season, where the show  really ups the emotional ante and rises to a whole other level. BTW, for  what it's worth my wife also thinks Angel is ""pretty hot.""",921110400,,1301,4.382352941176471

Some definite pluses in these videos is the inciteful comments from Joss Whedon at the beginning talking about the  specific episodes.  This is the only place where you can see a continuous  version of the Welcome to the Hellmout/Harvest episodes, the way they were  meant to be seen.  Also I didn't know that the Puppet episode was only  shown once in its entirety.  These videos is the only place you can see  Xander, Willow and Buffy performing in the talent show, because the episode  ran too long.  One last thing, it is great to see these shows without the  ratings and TV station logo splattered all over the screen.  I LOVED this  set.",915235200,,740,4.507575757575758

7883185,5,6305119112,"A lot of what I am reading makes no sense. The whole Blu-ray is 16:9 argument is crap. Aspect ratio fullscreen vs. widescreen has nothing to do with picture quality, it's just the shape of the video. Star Trek The Original series and Star Trek The Next Generation are being released on Blu-ray in their original 4:3 aspect ratio and they look beautiful, so that totally shoots down that poor excuse

Secondly, Buffy the Vampire Slayer seasons 4-7 do have widescreen versions available, you can see them on Netflix and Amazon. All they need to do is go through them and digitally remove a few things on the edges that aren't supposed to be seen.

As far as the filmed in standard definition and special effects, yes they will have to redo them. It will take time and money, but Buffy is so popular a Blu-ray release will give the studio incredible returns in profit believe me the show will fly off the shelves! It is very possible to do this it just has to be done right.  If they can re-master a show from the 1960's in Blu-ray and have it come out beautifully then they can certainly do it for a show that came out in the 90's.  The first couple of seasons will struggle because of the lousy 16mm film but season 3 and up will be perfect.

And they need to reinsert every single one of the ""Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" recaps that they moronically decided to cut from the DVD's for no reason at all! Despite what anyone says they are absolutely a part of the show and should be included.  Because of that stupid decision a scene from ""End Of Days"" is missing, the idiot that did the editing over at Fox cut out the bomb exploding when Faith discovers it because he thought it was part of the recap which it was not.  They never showed the bomb explode in the previous episode!  Since it was cut you never get to see this explosion at all on the DVD's!  It can only be seen on TV re-runs or streaming versions, because they left the damn recaps alone!  This was a major travesty that MUST be corrected!  So technically if you own the complete series on DVD you really don't because of these missing things.

The DVD menus are horrible too, this show needs a complete facelift and do over on Blu-ray to compensate for the poor DVD's that were put out a decade ago. The annoying looping menu music that was exactly the same for each disc for each season was horrible.  And the relentless sub menus for language selection and subtitles when all they needed was to put it once on the main menu.  No play all feature was added either.  All Fox has done is re-release DVD's again and again in new packages without improving the product one bit. It's time for a better version of Buffy!  If Buffy had been produced by a better studio like Paramount, like Star Trek was, it would already be in the process of a Blu-ray upgrade.  Fox is the problem.",1378857600,11,2853,4.3731060606060606
7883186,5,6305119112,"I just write this review and i rate it 5/5 because it would be totally awesome that Buffy is out on Bluray.

But i will just explain why this can be an impossible task:

- Buffy first 2 seasons were shot at 4:3 and the show fits the 4:3 perfectly. Bluray is 16:9 and the executives would want it to make it 16:9 and things can be messed up since original is made for 4:3.

- Buffy whole series were shot on film but transfered to SD Video standard that is really lower resolution than a Bluray standard ( 1080p ) . This was because they saved up for the CGI effects. If they would release it on Bluray they would have to RE do all the CGI effects to fit the Bluray standard resolution. They also need to use the original film again and RE do the transfer, that takes too much time and effort and of course a lot of money.

They could just recode the orignal SD video to Bluray ( upscaling and the original CFI effects with SD resolution ) but it will look horrible and it won't sell much because of this. Actually it will look that bad that the DVD version will be much better to purchase.

If they do the whole transfer from film, they re do all the CGI effects that needs to be done from zero all over again for the 144 episodes and they also don't care about the Season 1 and 2 4:3 format to a wicked 16:9 version... they will release it on Bluray.

Its actually not even possible if you think about all this and the money , effort and executives reasons to release it on Bluray or not.

I hope no one feels bad about this but its just how it is.",1376179200,,1549,4.042483660130719
