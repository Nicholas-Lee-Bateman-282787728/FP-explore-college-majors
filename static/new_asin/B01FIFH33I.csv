8760824,3,B01FIFH33I,"Three ex-GIs agree to meet again ten years after the end of WWII but when meeting find they no longer have anything in common. Dated and corny musical. It gets pretty silly at times. Decent singing and dancing but no memorable hits. Gene Kelly is good, as usual, and does some great dance routines, but the interest level doubled when Cyd Charisse entered the film about 1/4 way through. She outshines by far all other actors. If you're a passionate Gene Kelly or Cyd Charisse fan, this movie is for you. If not, there are many other far better musicals to watch.",1470787200,,563,4.529411764705882
