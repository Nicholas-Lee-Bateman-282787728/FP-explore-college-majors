4886100,5,B005SQRYEG,"This was a great movie for the whole family. As a parent I am always looking for movies that teach values that I want my daughters to understand and this movie fit that so well. As a person who works with students who have  forms of autism I could relate with the main character and what the coach and the player were going through. This movie has some great messages within it that all will enjoy, including ones of acceptance, passion, hard work and belief, but there are so many more. The movie is emotional, but is one that the whole family will enjoy. I highly recommend this to all!",1326153600,3,588,4.345454545454546
4886101,3,B005SQRYEG,"""Your son Mickey is a very special boy.""  Arthur Murphy (Cain) is the manager of a minor league baseball team that is stuck in an 0-13 start.  While on a trip to find a hot prospect ""Murph"" gets stuck in a ditch outside of a farm.  While waiting for a tow he sees Micky throwing apples and sees what he is looking for.  I have said this before...I am a sucker for all sports movies.  There has been a long string of sports movies lately that I have really enjoyed.  It stopped here.  While this is not a terrible movie it has the same problem that a lot of family movies have lately.  I know that it has to be this way because it is a family movie but it seems like there is no push back against the ""good guys"" at all.  For example : Murph sees Micky...he has no pitching mechanics...he says I'll work with him...paint's a red dot on a glove...Micky is now best pitcher ever.  To me when a movie is unbelievable it's not good to me.  Overall, not a bad movie, but too unbelievable for me to fully enjoy.  I give it a B-.",1325980800,7,1021,4.075376884422111

4886114,1,B005SQRYEG,"There's no better way to put it: This movie is awful, and I mean AWFUL! I'm a huge baseball fan who's mildly autistic, and when I saw the description on Netflix I thought, ""Hey, a story about an autistic baseball player! Awesome!""

Not awesome.

It's not that Luke Schroder's portrayal of an autistic kid was all that bad, but this movie is an abomination. The storyline is absolutely garbage; the events are completely unrealistic (he throws two knuckleballs in practice and has it MASTERED! Oh and then he doesn't throw another knuckleball for like three months until the end); nobody can act -- this point needs emphasized: NOBODY CAN ACT -- and there are plot holes big enough to drive a tank through:

1) Mickey reminds Coach Murphy of his dead son. Anyway, let's not mention that again, like at all;
2) A girl helps sabotage Mickey and then, in the very next scene, is in a confessional talking about how bad she feels about it, with zero recognition leading up to it that she felt bad;
3) ""They call him Sauce."" Why? Most convoluted reason ever -- a reason mentioned in passing and never shown in action;
4) Oh, only NOW did you see the telltale tattoos? Not at any point leading up to the climax? How convenient;
5) Mickey's scared of his father because he's autistic and doesn't understand some stuff, which is fine, but they show this in two flashbacks and do nothing to resolve this issue;
6) Murphy pleads with Mickey's father to let him pitch the final game, and he never answers ... then we cut to Mickey in the clubhouse getting ready to pitch.
7) The name of this movie is ""A Mile in his Shoes,"" which makes you think, oh, hey, it's about trying to relate to someone with autism, which would be great ... except it totally isn't. Instead it's about a kid who's autistic and someone finds him throwing apples hard in his parents' barn in BFE, so he signs him to pitch. His ASD doesn't really play in so much, and the attempts to relate with autism are few and hokey. You could call it ""Oddball Pitches Well"" and be more accurate.

This is just the tip of the iceberg. I've literally seen more logical and sensical sequences involving Wile E. Coyote than those in this movie.

Credit where due, the movie starts with a pleasant-sounding country song (by George Canyon, the guy who plays Mickey's father) along with an attractive montage of farmland. This 2-3 minute span is BY FAR the best part of the movie. This is because there's no dialogue.

Also, there's an irony to this movie because it has a Christian theme, yet it's a total abortion.

Only buy this if you're looking for the baseball version of The Room. If you somehow are, then congratulations, because here it is.",1473811200,,2691,4.547520661157025

4886124,3,B005SQRYEG,"A Mile in His Shoes is an easygoing, empathetic, encouraging, engaging, if somewhat elementary baseball story about a talented young pitcher suffering from an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Its been a long time since I read The Legend of Mickey Tussler, the novel on which this film is based, but I remember the novel being significantly more complex than the film. Also, the film has a low-budget feel to it. For example, the baseball scenes have a decidedly economy-class look. Mickeys pitches don't look like they could get many people out, and the villains in the film seem too uncomplicated. Plus, the ending involves some implausibilities. Still, the film does a decent job of stressing the importance of seeing things from anothers point of view in an entertaining way. My favorite character was Murph, but I liked Mickey too. He reminded me of Forrest Gump. This is the life is like a basket of apples version. Finally, in spite of some of the more Christophobic reviews, the films religion is a very generic kind. All in all, A Mile in His Shoes reaches base safely.",1449705600,,1076,4.821621621621621

4886171,3,B005SQRYEG,"Based on the novel, The Legend of Micky Tussler by Frank Nappi, comes the Canadian film, A Mile In His Shoes. While the basic story remains the same, the film was significantly different than the novel. The new story transfers much better to film, but takes far too much away from the original novel. Micky Tussler (Luke Schroeder) is a mid-western farm boy, who suffers from Aspergers Syndrome. One day fortune finds him, as the manager of an independent baseball team's car breaks down in front of his farm. While waiting for a tow truck, Arthur Murphy (Dean Cain) observes Tussler throwing apples to his pigs, and realizes that the kid has a lot of potential. The story originally took place in the 1940's and it was much easier to understand the hardship and discrimination Tussler faced. When the film changes the story to modern day, there isn't much of a stigma associated with Aspergers and that whole angle seemingly disappears from the story. The film being made for TV is also problematic, as rather than being a story of a kid who had to overcome overwhelming odds, it plays more like a Disney movie, about some loveable idiot and the coach who takes him under his wing. The whole message of the original story is basically gutted for TV and as someone who really enjoyed the novel, I resent that. Luke Schroder, son of Rick Schroder, stars as Micky and was really the only bright spot in this film. This was his film debut and he played it as though he'd been acting for years. Growing up around the business must have made it very easy for him to slip into the profession, and his performance was very admirable. As for the rest of the cast, they are just along for the ride and as I said, for me, the film takes too much away from the original story and plays like a dreaded Disney movie, in one of those rare instances where I wish I'd just stuck with the novel.",1407024000,4,1878,4.494152046783626

4886183,3,B005SQRYEG,"""A Mile in His Shoes"" is one of those low-budget touchy-feely movies... that needs to be said off the bat. Context is king, there's your context.

The movie features Dean Cain (that one actor who you recognize but can't recall his name) who plays coach Arthur Murphy, the manager of a semi-pro baseball team who plays Fargo literally every night (seriously, there is not another opponent featured in this movie). When things aren't going right, the owner/president/guy-in-charge of the River Rats sends him to Indiana to check out a kid who could bolster their rotation.

Murphy wrecks his car and finds himself in rural Indiana at the farm of Mickey Tussler and his family. Mickey is an 18-year-old kid who has Aspergers Syndrome, a form of autism, and parents who really have no clue how to work with their child. Murphy approaches Mickey, played by Luke Schroder, who is portrayed as more of a Forrest Gump character and not really a kid with Aspergers, but I'll get to that later. Murphy watches Mickey chuck apples at a metal pan and likes the kid's arm... so Murphy pitches the idea of playing baseball to Mickey and his parents, but Mickey's parent don't want him to, but obviously allow him to, otherwise I wouldn't be writing this movie review.

Mickey shows up in the locker room and is immediately accepted by the team, except for one royal jerk named Lefty (Jesse Hutch, not that it's important)... this movie could win an award for the most vilified character... this guy was bad news bad, bad news. The whole time he's playing on the team, Mickey's dad (George Canyon), which was one of the most painfully awful acting performances I've ever witnessed, is a ""my way or the highway"" type dad who sees the light (obviously) and lets his boy finish the season.

The movie was filled with your typical low-budget baseball movie shenanigansthe guy who hits a bazillion home runs, starting pitchers who go 9 innings no matter the score, two managers who have a long history and are at each others throats, the star player who switches to the rival team, the umpire who holds everyone to rules which don't actually exist in baseball, and the always required minority baseball player who can teach anyone to be coolneedless to say, there's not much to the story line you haven't seen, in terms of a baseball movie that is.

I'll rank a couple categories for y'all:

Acting- 2 out of 5. Dean Cain saved this movie. George Canyon's role, as I already stated, nearly killed it completely. The guy who played Mickey needed serious coaching on how to portray someone with Aspergers... I've worked with kids with Aspergers, they missed it completely. They all owe it to Dean Cain, I can't emphasize that enough.

Storyline- 4 out of 5. Despite being low-budget, the storyline was actually pretty good. They kept a good rhythm to the movie, didn't overplay certain scenes, and it was a unique story. If they would've played more than the team from Fargo and not have the seemingly obvious baseball shenanigans, this movie would've been 5 out of 5 on the story line.

Believability- 1 out of 5. I give it 1 because I'd feel bad giving it a zero. They go find a kid with no baseball experience and offer him a contract to play baseball? Extremely unlikely. Mickey's Aspergers did not seem like Aspergers, at all (people with Aspergers generally have high intelligence and very poor social skills, Mickey was the exact opposite for the most part). Mickey's dad was so back-and-forth with his emotions and his mom seemed to have no personality... they were portrayed as though when Mickey was gone at baseball, they stared at blank walls... seriously, no personality whatsoever.

Faith elements- 2 out of 5. This movie is a ""faith"" film, made by Thomas Kincade. I wouldn't call it a ""faith film"" as much as I would say it had some faith elements in the movie. There where Mickey wanted to keep the Bible on his bed near him, a prayer scene, and a moment where a church pastor shares a nugget of Biblical truth, but that's about it... there weren't really any blatant attempts to make it about faith... which leaves me at the awkward spot of having to rate it a 2 instead of a 1, but not a 3.

Safe for the family? 4 out of 5. At the risk of including a spoiler, there is a scene where Mickey is beat up by masked men. That and there's a scene where Mickey gets kissed (it's for like, maybe a second) and a moment where Cain's character yells ""bush"" in response to a call he disagreed with... if you can explain those scenes to your children, you'll be fine. I give it a 4 because there's enough to have to explain to your children should they watch with you.

Overall- 3 out of 5. The unique storyline made it so I didn't turn the movie off and find another, but it definitely didn't leave me thinking, ""gee, I'm glad I watched that movie"".. it was okay. There was just too many bad elements filming wise that made me not really care for it... to each their own, I guess. As for the overall message, I was left not really completely understanding it... they showed me a character who's faced tremendous diversity in life, but did little to make you really empathize with him... it lacked teaching moments for your kids it was a nice movie, that's about it.",1406764800,,5251,4.593383137673426

Review: I wanted to love this movie but it lacked the depth of character and development of plot that makes the Mickey Tussler novels so wonderful.  Not sure why Mr. Nappi agreed to this adaptation. Books are outstanding as is. Changes spoil the story.",1405555200,,321,5.037735849056604

4886223,5,B005SQRYEG,"I just finished watching this movie and enjoyed it a great deal, even though going into it I was doubtful.  I do enjoy watching sports movies but I'm leery of anything that has Thomas Kinkade's name on it.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just not appealing to me.  I watched this movie because of the Asperger Syndrome main character.  I can see from the reviews that there are people who think it was a good portrayal and those who thought it was terrible.  I actually liked it, as you can tell from the 5 stars.  In fact, the scene where the coach is driving at night and Mickey just keeps talking about tomato soup... cracked me up.  I don't know how many times I've lived that scene on a variety of topics, just wishing for a little silence. I don't think it's a perfect representation all the time, but it's better than most, and if some young boys out there watch it, and are able to have some empathy for a classmate on the spectrum, that's good enough for me.

Frankly, I'd encourage everyone to watch this movie hoping to raise awareness about high functioning autism and I wish that every person on the spectrum had a coach like ""Murph"" and a friend like ""PeeWee"".  The story wasn't the about baseball, and I didn't feel hit over the head with a Christian inspirational message.  I liked that it was about sportsmanship and being a good friend.",1405209600,3,1371,4.469879518072289

4886233,1,B005SQRYEG,OK...Dean Cain was the only actor in this movie. I saw him as a baseball coach...but everything else was so poorly done that it was unbearable to watch! Where did they find the kid to play an autistic boy?! At least find someone who has picked up a baseball before...I know tee-ballers who have more skill and technique.

4886411,3,B005SQRYEG,"If you are in search of a top notch baseball movie -- with an emphasis on the ""baseball"" -- then don't bother with this one.  Its amateurish acting, low budget production values, a clunky, ham-handed plot and utterly unrealistic on-the-field and in-the-locker-room sequences are just this side of painful to watch.  It gets three stars for having its heart in the right place, although to be honest, this ""heartwarming tale"" of a kid with Asperger's leans dangerously over the line from the realm of the ""sensitive"" into the world of the maudlin and smarmy.

Furthermore, there is nothing at all realistic about this kid's ""Asperger's.""  This is an ill-defined behavioral syndrome that includes a lack of social skills, ability to interpret nonverbal cues and, in many cases, supranormal attention to detail and proficiency in a narrow range of endeavors.  Indeed, there are a number of historical figures who might well be diagnosed with ""Asperger's syndrome"" were they in grade school today, including Albert Einstein and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Whether this syndrome is, in fact, an ""ailment,"" is open to question.  In many cases, it is more about being different and far less about being ""impaired.""  Watching this film, one might believe those diagnosed with Asperger's are barely able to function.  Simply not true.

The actor playing this supposedly afflicted young man lurches through this film as though he were Anne Bancroft playing Helen Keller playing The Thing from Outer Space in a low budget horror film from the 50's. The film gives the viewer no real idea what the syndrome is or what, in reality, those who have it project to the rest of the world or may face in their day to day lives.

In all, the film oversimplifies, stereotypes and presents its subject matter in cartoonish fashion. You got your good guys, you got your bad guys, you got your ""handicapped kid,"" you got your heartwarming ending and justice done.  Someone referred to this as a ""Hallmark Movie of the Week"" style production.  That's being charitable.  It probably wouldn't make the Hallmark cut.

There are some really stellar baseball films out there, but admittedly few of them will fill the bill for the Christian fundamentalist crowd this one appears to be targeting.  If you want baseball with some grit, look to 42, Moneyball, Pastime, Trouble With the Curve, The Natural, Field of Dreams, A League of Their Own, For Love of the Game, Bull Durham, A Player to Be Named Later, Eight Men Out - or go way back to Pride of the Yankees, It Happens Every Spring, or The Pride of St. Louis.

You also don't need to watch amateurish piffle like this to find a baseball story that is suitable for kids and that conveys valuable ""life lessons.""  You want ""heartwarming,"" there is the original b&w Angels in the Outfield (misanthropic, foul mouthed loser manager finds love, God and a lovely daughter, not to mention a pennant), The Stratton Story (with Jimmy Stewart as a star pitcher and Major League prospect who loses his leg and manages a comeback, with the wholesome June Allyson as his childhood sweetheart and wife), The Kid from Left Field (Dan Dailey plays a washed up former Major Leaguer and single father, down on his luck and heavy into ""the sauce,"" who is redeemed through the love of his son and his love of The Game) -- and there are others.",1385251200,,3343,4.836842105263158

4886435,4,B005SQRYEG,"The movie was good but was a ""movie of the week"" type of production, perhaps more appropriate for the Hallmark Channel.  The actors did a good job, and perhaps would have been more convincing if I had not read the book first.  I think the beauty of the book being written based on a true story, was lost in the decision to ""update"" the time period in which ""A Mile in His Shoes"" took place which was more or less in the present.  That change sold out the history of baseball, the significance of where,how and when Mickey was discovered.  I think that in our present time, with Autism Spectrum Disorders being so prevelent and in so many discussions and part of so many pushes to ""include"" all individuals with ASD in our communities...the power of what happened with Mickey loses its punch being set in current times.  The actor who played Mickey did an outstanding job.  As the parent of a son on the Spectrum,  I appreciated the dignity and respect paid to the Autism Community, by even attempting to translate the book to film.

It is based on the true story of Mickey Tussler.  One word of caution.  The movies screen play is based on the novel ""The Legend of Mickey Tussler"" Because I enjoyed the movie, I ordered the book through Amazon. The book is completely different and NOT family friendly.  It is full of locker room language, and the use of four letter words and taking God's name in vain is frequent throughout.  The happy ending in the movie, is also different. In the book  Mickey is arrested for assaulting Lefty and is put in the county jail!  So parents beware of the book, watch the film instead.

4886521,4,B005SQRYEG,"This was a positive, feel-good film.  Coach Murphy, played well by Dean Cain, is sent to find a baseball prospect and stumbles across a natural pitching phenomenon who incidentally also has Aspberger's Syndrome (a type of Autism).  ""Murph"" encourages the young man, Tyler, to come and play with his team, where he finds rapid pitching success and general acceptance from his team (with jealousy from one teammate).  Tyler does struggle with dealing with the world as a whole, and his protective father attempts to shelter him from harm.  However Tyler overcomes his situation and performs very well.

Production is limited, and other than Dean Cain there were no recognizable actors.  In many ways I felt as though I was watching a film on Hallmark or another tv channel.

However the film has a great message, with the redemption and success of Tyler, Coach Murphy, the father and others.  The positive vibe carries over particularly to baseball fans, who will likely appreciate the game sequences, team interaction, and office banter that much more.",1346284800,,1051,5.069767441860465

It was painful to watch the stupidity and outright meanness of teammates, one in particular, who did not support him.  I hate bullies, and this one was the worst kind.  I might have rated the film a 4 if the young man's Autism had been more completely portrayed.  I'm not an expert by any stretch of the imagination, but I noticed that Shroeder's character always made eye contact with those he talked with.  I've worked as a one-on-one teacher's aide with boys with Asperger's for a few years now and the boys I spend time with rarely make eye contact.  Even when you lift their chins and tell them to look at your eyes, they always look slightly off to the side, avoiding your eyes.  There may be exceptions to the rule, but I feel that if you're going to make a film focused on a character with Autism, that character should be an example of the norm, not the exception.  I also feel that the movie did not display the characteristic ""tunnel vision"" or narrow focus aspect of Asperger's/Autism as a dominant aspect of the young man's nature.",1332547200,3,1195,4.470046082949309

4886532,5,B005SQRYEG,"When I first  heard about this movie, I couldn't wait to watch it for family night. I wasn't disappointed.

""A Mile in His Shoes"" stars Dean Cain as a minor league baseball coach named nicknamed ""Murph."" Murph enjoys his job, but can't quite shake the losing streak his team has been experiencing lately. When Murph goes in search of a possible recruit, he accidentally runs his car off the road and becomes stranded on a country highway. A young man named Mickey offers him the use of his family's phone. Murph takes Mickey up on his offer, and that's when Murph discovers something amazing - Mickey's pitching arm could be just the thing needed to end Murph's team's losing streak.

There's only one problem - Mickey has Asperger's Syndrome (a form of Autism), and as such, his parents (especially his dad) are very protective of him. Can Murph convince Mickey's parents to allow their son the chance of a lifetime? And if Mickey's parents do agree, how will Mickey fit in with the rest of the team? How will he adapt to life away from his family's farm - the only life he's ever known?

This movie has wonderful discussion points including the topics of faith, loyalty, friendship, never giving up,  envy, mistreatment of others because they are different, grief, worry, and telling the truth.

A word of caution to those with young children: there is a brief scene at a party where Mickey is injured that will scare younger viewers.

Beautiful scenery, an inspiring story line based on a true story, and a well-rounded family movie make this a must-see. I highly recommend adding it to your list for your family's next movie night! I have added this movie to my list of mom-approved movies on my wordpress blog.

Film Critic Sam C. When I was first sitting down to watch this, I thought ""Oh please, don't be as bad as I think it's going to be!"" But that was unfair because, first of all I didn't know anything about it, and second of all it really is a very good movie.

The film is about an autistic farm boy who has Asperger's syndrome, and he likes to feed his pigs by throwing apples into a tub that is nailed sideways to a tree so his pigs can eat smashed apples. A baseball coach sees him doing that, so he has the kid try it with a real baseball and the kid throws the ball so hard that it goes straight through the tub.

The baseball coach realizes that this kid is a natural pitcher, so he recruits the kid whose name is Mickey.
Much of the movie is about his troubles communicating with the world outside the farm, functioning in society.
Luke Schroder played Mickey in this, and I was very surprised when I went onto IMDB.com to find that there was really nothing on him. Then I realized that this movie was filmed just last year (2011), so this was probably his first film. But, I have absolutely no doubt whatsoever that he is going to be a gigantic star. He was so incredibly wonderful in this role. He doesn't have much to his credit yet, but he will.

I liked the way that they showed things through Mickey's eyes. I don't have Asperger's, but they showed it in a way that gave you a better idea of what it's like to have Asperger's, and look around and comprehend what's happening. I think that was very well done.

I'd have to say that the age range is pretty much 8 to 12 or even older. Very small kids might not like it because there's a lot of talkig, although some of the stuff that Mickey says is very funny.

All in all, I'd have to give this a five out of five stars, because this was really a wonderful movie. This is something I'd recommend to friends. It's very good.

4886534,4,B005SQRYEG,"I'm not one to watch and like sports related movies but ""A Mile in His Shoes"" really touched my heart. it's about a baseball team that is struggling to make it, when the coach is asked to travel somewhere to recruit a new player he has some car issues and stops at a farm. There he meets this boy with an amazing arm. His parents are reluctant to let him go join this team because he has aspergers. They don't want to see him get hurt like he had been all his live. He does join and the team becomes the talk of the State.
While watching this movie, I kept hoping that Mickey won't get hurt or picked on. I found myself cheering him on and crying when his teammate were so supportive of his aspergers.
I don't know much about aspergers, so I can't say if the actor was believable or not. But I can say Luke Schroder made his character lovable.
This movie will make you laugh, cry, get mad and smile. This is one we will be keeping on our shelves for a long time. I can't wait to watch it with my kids. The only thing I could have done without was the country music. But that's just a personal preference, I know a lot of people who would love it.
I would totally recommend this movie for all ages. It's clean, fun and inspiring.

My Thoughts

Our girls are getting to the age where they want to watch movies that are more `real life' based and often I am at a loss to find movies that are clean and provide a redeeming story line. A Mile in His Shoes is one that I am happy to add to our collection and am not worried about the kids watching without me there. This is a movie that will also encourage conversation about how we treat others and encourage others who may not be just like us, and also how they may influence and change our view of things.

Based on 'The legend of Mickey Tussler', a novel written by talented Frank Nappi, 'A mile in his shoes' is the story of a remarkable young Ohio farmer with a sensational pitcher's arm.
Mickey is undeniably warm and caring and has a remarkable memory for numbers. He also suffers from Asperger's syndrome, a form of Autism.

Wonderful quotes from the movie:
 'You'll never know what's possible until your learn to believe in yourself' and 'Sometimes miracles happen when you least expect them and late in the game'.
What better messages to pass on to our children?

A presentation of Thomas Kinkade the Painter of Light, this movie is directed by William Dear (remember Harry and the Hendersons?) and stars actor Dean Cain with the million dollar smile as the friendly Coach with a past.
Luke Schroder also makes his acting debut and gives us a heartfelt performance you will find endearing!  Luke's tasteful rendition of 'Mickey' reminds us of his famous Dad, Rick Schroder. A quick look at the Special Features explains also Luke's respect for the character he plays in the movie and how he came to study the part. A young actor with much promise!

This is is a movie the whole family can appreciate and worth 5 stars!

Mickey, a young man diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome (a form of autism), is discovered by a minor league baseball coach and offered a spot on the team. His parents reluctantly agree and Mickey is thrust into a world of new, and sometimes frightening, experiences.

Jealous teammate Lefty causes trouble for Mickey, but the boy's spirit is not broken. Despite the obstacles, Mickey's determination becomes an inspiration for his whole team, and even his gruff and skeptical father.

The PG rating concerned me, but I did not find anything alarming. **SPOILER:** Mickey is invited to a party by a fellow teammate whose jealousy has given root to evil intentions towards the newest member of the team. The scenes suggest that drinking may be going on, but no closeups or offers to Mickey are given. When Mickey is taken away from the party and overwhelmed by 'bad guys,' the beating isn't shown - you just assume that's what happens - as the movie quickly progresses to the next scene.**

Based on a true story, A Mile in His Shoes is a family-friendly movie that teaches both acceptance and perseverance. Our whole family enjoyed watching Mickey's story.

4886538,5,B005SQRYEG,"One of the most exciting things this year has been to be able to view some incredible family films and today is no exception. Based on a true story, Dean Cain and Luke Schroder star in movie based on the book, The Legend of Mickey Tussler.

A Mile In His Shoes tells the story of a failing baseball coach Arthur Murphy (Dean Cain) who is trying to find a way to salvage his minor league teach, The River Rats. Taking a drive to interview a prospective candidate who may just turn out to be the next big thing, Murphy has a minor accident while trying to find his way into town. When he seeks the aid from a young boy, Mickey Tussler searching for his lost pig, Oscar  to use a phone, he soon discovers God has bigger plans in store for Murphy and Tussler.

Watching Tussler 'smash apples' as he's feeding the pigs, Murphy discovers the boy can deliver the heat in his accurate pitches to throw apples into a tin barrel. Sensing a bright spot in both their lives, Murphy must convince the Tussler family of Mickey's potential at pitching baseball. However he discovers that Mickey has Asperger's syndrome, which is a form of autism that can overwhelm his sense if he is surprised or confused. They relent to allow Mickey to try out and soon discover that all roads lead to where God will call those who are willing to listen.

I received this DVD, A Mile in His Shoes compliments of Propeller, Thomas Kinkade and Nasser Group North for my honest review. This was is sure to be a homerun for fans of baseball, under dog stories of determination and the love of friendship and family and is also a movie from the director of Angels in the Outfield. I just know that you're going to love this film as much as my family did and that's why this one rates a 5 out of 5 stars in my opinion",1326585600,3,1781,4.323353293413174
4886539,4,B005SQRYEG,"Team manager and Coach Arthur ""Murph"" Murphy needs a miracle.  His team is 0-13 when Murph sets out to meet with a promising pitcher.  Unfortunately Fortunately, fate has other plans and Murph meets Mickey Tussler, a boy devoted to his pet pig Oscar.  You quickly realize that this kid has some issues.  Mickey has Asperger's Syndrome, yet he has the most amazing pitching arm.  Murph has found his miracle.

Murph has to convince his paranoid parents to let their 18-year-old son go; no small fete.  The dad is paranoid or angry or both.  The mom is your typical abused wife.  Both mom and son are afraid of the dad.  You want to just scream at them!  Finally, the dad relents and let's Mickey go to Ohio to play baseball.

Wisely, coach introduces Mickey to Pewee and asks Pewee to take care of Mickey.  Long story short, Mickey becomes the hero of Ohio...but not before he manages to make the previous star pitcher Lefty jealous.  In the end, good overcomes evil and Mickey is reconciled with his dad.

The movie was heart-warming.  There are a few awkward scenes: the feud between the rival team coaches, the supposed girlfriend of Lefty, the locker room scenes.  You felt apprehension for the kid; he is clearly a child in a man's body.  Yet, as the movie progresses, you can see him grow up under the care of Murph.

A friend of mine pointed out that the title does not make sense.  I have to agree.  There is no clear connection between the movie and the title.  Who is ""HIS"" in this case?  I'm assuming that it refers to Mickey, but that is not clear at all.

Although there is a consistent theme of faith throughout the movie, it is not preachy or evangelistic as some other TV family movies.  Overall, I would rate this as a good family movie.

I received this movie to review. Opinions are my own.",1326326400,,1808,4.486153846153846
4886540,4,B005SQRYEG,"Another Thomas Kinkade movie for you to love.
  I really enjoyed this DVD and am happy to review it.
The actors did an excellent job. The main actors are Dean Cain and Luke Schroder. This is the first movie I've seen Luke Schroder play in and thought what a marvelous story. This movie was based on the book ""The Legend of Mickey Tussler.""
  Mickey has Asperger's Syndrome and Luke does a wonderful job of portraying a boy with this syndrome. He is quiet and really is respectful of this syndrome and doesn't make it seem dumb or stupid.
  I like how the team doesn't give up even when they are losing and neither does Mickey. It is really hard for Mickey to keep himself from being to overwhelmed, but with help and his own determination he does it.
  Of course you have your bully's in this movie as you do in real life and I really liked how this movie ended and the faith and love Mickey had to do the right thing.
  This is a very enjoyable movie that is very family friendly and would be an excellent addition to your library. I recommend it and know you will like it.

4886541,4,B005SQRYEG,"Such a beautiful movie. I loved it!

Dean Cain plays a ""Murph"", a minor league coach who is sent out on a wild goose chase by his superior to visit a potential new recruit. Divine intervention steps in and provides him with a flat that forces him to do some leg work and find a phone. He ends up at a farm house where young Mickey is pitching apples like a pro for the pigs on his parents farm.

Murph recognizes talent and asks his reluctant parents if he can have Mickey try out for the league. His protective father isn't into it, Mickey has Aspergers. In the scene where his mother quietly talks the father into allowing Mickey to try out, I felt my throat clench up in what would be my first cry of the movie!

Things are hard for Mickey in the beginning since change isn't something that is easy for him and some evil, jealous teammates try to bring him down. But Mickey has good people watching his back and eventually manages to change the whole team plus the coach who has some healing of his own to do.

Based on a true story, this is a wonderful, feel good movie that will have you smiling at the end.

Dean Cain superman does a great job as the hero who plucks a farm boy from obscurity and gives him a life his parents couldn't have even dream of.

Luke Schroder (Rick Schroder's son) does a great job in his first movie as Mickey. Big props to the writers and director who didn't focus allow the umbrella of Aspergers to overshadow a really great movie about strength, hope, taking chances, and the power of love.",1326153600,,1527,4.284722222222222
