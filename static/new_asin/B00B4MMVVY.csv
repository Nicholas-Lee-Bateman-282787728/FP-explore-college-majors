5555647,5,B00B4MMVVY,"I have not only studied martial arts my whole life but I am a life long lover of Asian cinema. This movie has down right awesome. It is one part x-men, one part man with the iron fists, one part mission impossible all mixed together with an Asian dose of awesome.",1371340800,,263,4.176470588235294
5555648,4,B00B4MMVVY,"This is a decent  ""quy type"" Action film.  Men will get into the action, the martial arts and the story line.",1370649600,,109,4.142857142857143
5555649,2,B00B4MMVVY,The movie was okay but a little far off. I watched because I bought. Its more for kids.  It was like X-men meets the Kung Fu world but not executed right. Sorry I would buy this again.,1370217600,,184,3.972972972972973
5555650,3,B00B4MMVVY,it was okay some action scenes were far fetched but story base i liked reminded me of the x-men would consider watching if a  second one came out,1369353600,,145,4.178571428571429
5555651,5,B00B4MMVVY,I frist saw it on Youtube. I like the story.  I grew up watching this type of movie. It is based on a book. The movie  was well made. The price is good as well.,1368144000,12,160,3.5428571428571427
5555652,4,B00B4MMVVY,"This is based on the Manhua (Chinese Comicbook) The Four Constables. This movie was very well done. What holds me back for giving 5 stars is that its hard to tell their story in just one movie. Also they changed one of the main characters to a woman. This change actually destroys 2 of the main heroes back stories in a bad way. If you want to see a better adaption get TVB TV series... also named ""The Four"" but I also suggest the comicbook. Its just awesome!!!",1367625600,,462,4.261363636363637
5555653,5,B00B4MMVVY,"I watch a lot of martial arts movies, and this one stands out. It has a lot of quirky characters, a good plot, magical villians, and excellent martial arts. I loved it.",1367452800,2,168,4.28125
5555654,4,B00B4MMVVY,"The movie is well worth renting it.  The fighting seens are great, but I wish they would of spend more time in the development of the characters.",1366761600,3,145,4.37037037037037
5555655,5,B00B4MMVVY,"This movie is an unapologetic Wuxia film; swordsmanship, kung-fu, and magic on very side. It doesn't transcend the genera, but it is among the very best examples of it. Other reviewers have noted that there is some skimping on the character development, and that is true, but Wuxia is not a style that goes in for much character development beyond certain basic archetypes. Furthermore, as the Wikipedia entry on the film notes, the novels this film is based on have already been adapted to television several times, in Hong Kong, so the target audience already knows these people. We Westerners are just going to have to catch up.

If you are looking for historical accuracy, or realistic fighting, or shakespearean eloquence, then you have come to the wrong place. But if you are looking for top-flight fantasy fun, well shot, well acted, with thrilling fights and glorious special effects, then by no means pass this one up.",1366243200,30,927,4.904458598726115
5555656,5,B00B4MMVVY,"Was well worth watching. Effects are very well done and the acting was just as good.
For comparison sake I would have to say this movie is equal in production to movies such as ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" and ""The Forbidden Kingdom""... etc.
Though the fist half of the movie jumped right over character development(Lacked in good introduction), it did not take away from the overall experience.
Glad I took the chance with this one.. ""thoroughly enjoyed it"".",1365724800,11,462,4.935897435897436

5555691,4,B00B4MMVVY,"Terrific martial arts movie with Asian mysticism woven in. Many Asian films/TV series imbue their heroes and villains with mystical, supernatural - some say, magical - powers in keeping with the Asian belief in that divine forces can rule Nature and change the course of history. The Emperor of the Song dynasty established Department Six, a secret police organization tasked to fight criminals. ""The Four"" of the film title refers to the Top Four Constables in Department Six who are each determined by their level of fighting skills and successful efforts. However, another royal mandate also created the ""Divine Constabulary,"" a very secretive organization with royal authority and headed by one of China's nobles. Although battling the ""bad guys,"" both secret police organizations are at odds and very competitive. There are several key members of each secret group and this may cause confusion in the beginning as to who's who in the cast; however, the battle lines soon become clear as the story unfolds. ""The Four"" showcases the martial arts and mystical powers of these secret forces battling the greedy, criminals of ancient China. Fun, Fast-paced, Must-See!",1430006400,,1167,5.245989304812834

5555713,4,B00B4MMVVY,"My nonexistent ability to understand the Chinese language didn't hurt my enjoyment of this film. The mystery was a bit complex, but the action was nearly nonstop. The subtitles made sense in most cases, although I might have preferred good dubbing. There is just the right amount of comic relief that seems to be present in most recent action movies. That may help save the film from being gratuitously gory. Overall pretty good balance between the main characters.",1400803200,2,465,4.9743589743589745

5555723,5,B00B4MMVVY,I enjoyed the movie and the special effects as well as the martial art moves. It was an inspiration and a great addition to my Martial Arts film library. Will be looking for more exciting titles to purchase.....the price is right !!!!!,1386547200,,235,4.619047619047619
5555724,3,B00B4MMVVY,"I went into this movie expecting to see lots of bad guys get punched in the face, and I was not disappointed. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised by how attractive the cast was and how cute the puppy was. Those are, in fact, the three reasons to see this movie: you want to see zombies get kicked in the face until their heads explode, you think the cast is hot, or you like adorable puppies. Otherwise, don't expect a cinematic masterpiece.",1386374400,,441,4.390243902439025
5555725,5,B00B4MMVVY,This was a very good and entertaining movie. I'm a kung fu buff so any good kung fu movie I would love to sit down and just watch the action. It would help if they would make all movies in english that are sold in the United States. I don't like spending time trying to read the translation. I spend a lot of time re-playing different scenes that I missed while trying to read the translations.,1383782400,,394,4.197368421052632

5555727,4,B00B4MMVVY,"So I'v been watching Asian cinema for about 20 years now or more.
And in the past few years a lot of movies, Kung-fu fantasy movies come out and they are nowhere near as good as what it used to be.

This movie is great, for many reasons
1. The Fights are very cool and well done, old style with fantasy, nothing over the top silly, just good choreography
2. the Characters are super cool, like something out of an Anime
3. the CGI is good, so many movies have horrible CGI but this one is just great
4. Plot is good, not mind blowing but not super stupid
5. the People are likeable and look good

All around fun good movie with Great fight choreography",1379980800,,652,4.166666666666667
5555728,4,B00B4MMVVY,"The Four is a great popcorn movie. Essentially X-Men meets Sherlock Holmes in old China, although not as cheesy as that sounds. Has all the action you would expect of a movie with its concept, even if it does also have the expectant scarceness of plot or character development.

It's pretty straight-forward -- if you read the story summary and think you'll get a kick out of it, you will. It's no classic or epic by any means, but it is thoroughly enjoyable for what it is and does fine for repeat viewings as well.",1378857600,,516,4.431578947368421

5555733,4,B00B4MMVVY,"America has its fair share of superhero groups on the big screen.  From the Avengers, Fanastic Four and the X-Men, in Asia, we have seen many films featuring people with supernatural powers.  But what about an investigative team with supernatural powers?

This is the concept featured in Gordon Chan's (""The Medallion"", ""Fist of Legend"", 2000 AD"") and Janet Chun's (""All's Well Ends Well 2011, ""La Lingerie"") film ""The Four"", the first film of a planned trilogy and a loose big screen adaptation of Wen Ruian's novel series ""The Four Great Constables"".

Featuring a cast with talent from mainland China and Hong Kong, the film stars Chao Deng (""Assembly"", ""Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame""), Yifei Liu (""The Assassins"", ""White Vengeance""), Ronald Cheng (""Fatal Contact"", ""Vulgaria""), Collin Chou (""The Matrix Revolutions"", ""The Matrix Reloaded"", ""The Forbidden Kingdom"", ""Fearless"") and Anthony Wong Chau-Sang (""Infernal Affairs"" films, ""Ip Man: The Final Fight"", ""White Vengeance"").

VIDEO:

""The Four"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:20:1 aspect ratio).  The film looks fantastic when it comes to close-up details but also its use of the spider-cam to really capture the sense of movement and blend in the wirework and CG elements wonderfully.  Contrast is well-done, some scenes may be a tad too dark but for the most part, ""The Four"" looks very good on Blu-ray.

I personally didn't notice any banding or compression artifacts issues during my viewing of the film.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Four"" is presented in Mandarin 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  One thing I learned while watching this film is how amazing the film sounds in lossless and surround.  There are times where I'm watching the film and you can hear the environments such as wind blowing through the wind, good use of surround during the more action-intense sequences.  Lossless audio for the film is fantastic!

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Four"" comes with the following special features:

  Making Of - (24:22) A combination of several short making of featurettes, featuring interviews with the director Gordon Chan, interviews with the cast about the characters and the use of the Spider-cam, the amount of makeup for Cold Blood's feral look and more!
  Deleted Scenes - (4:10) A combination of deleted scenes featuring the other characters who are members of the Divine Constabulary.
  Trailer - (1:41) Theatrical trailer for ""The Four"".

EXTRAS:

""The Four"" comes with a slipcover case.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""The Four"" will probably be known for two things.

The first is for its spectacular use of a spider-cam in which multiple cranes were hold wired cameras above the set, so the camera can travel up from high above and carefully following the wire back down and to go back again.  The spider-cam would be able to capture people jumping from building to building without the use of CG but actual wire work.  And complicated as it was to film, Gordon Chan and his crew were ready for the challenge and were successful, despite the various attempts and mistakes before getting the final cut.

The second part about ""The Four"" that will be known for its its criticism by Chinese publications for the film trying to be a combination of ""X-Men"", ""Resident Evil"" and ""Van Helsing"", characters with supernatural ability and of course, with the Chinese flair.

And in some ways, I can see the comparisons because I thought of the film the same way.  I immediately saw the comparisons to ""X-Men"" with Professor X preaching to his X-Men to fight for the positive cause and not cause trouble and not to be like the others (ie. The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants).  The same can be said with the wise Zhuge Zhengwo (portrayed by Anthony Wong).  Emotionless has similarities to Jean Grey, Iron Fist has similarities to scientist Henry Pym (The Beast) but with the strength and ability to wield iron ala Colossus.  While Life Snatcher is like Warren Worthington (Angel) and his ability to woo the women but in this case, the ability to use his feet as weapons and last, Cold Blood.  The person trying to be on the side of good but has a feral side (ala Wolverine) because he was raised by wolves.

Throw in an antagonist who tries to revive the dead and thus the ""Resident Evil"" zombie comparisons.  And you have the crazy antagonist with the God of Wealth who is able to wield hot and cold and whatever unknown power that he is responsible for.

As the first film in the planned trilogy, with the film establishing its characters and their abilities but also the mysterious background of certain characters who may be good or bad, ""The Four"" is kept interesting because of its characters and the predicaments they are in.

While fight choreography looks amazing, some will find the comparison to other American films to be bothersome or unoriginal. But the fact is that Gordon Chan wanted to do something different from Wen Ruian's novels by focusing on the characters and giving some back story to them, but as some questions are answered throughout the film, some tend to linger and keep viewers waiting to get answers for the second film.

Plus, aside from the action and drama, there is also a romantic love triangle storyline tacked into the film as well.

As for the Blu-ray, picture quality is very good but its the lossless soundtrack that stands out with great use of ambiance for the surround channels.  You literally hear the wind all around you and of course, a good number of action sequences throughout the film.

Overall, ""The Four"" is a film that really goes all out in showcasing the challenges to shoot with the spider-cam and with Chinese cinematic innovation, they really made certain scenes look fantastic but yet so difficult to pull off.  I was impressed!  While some may criticize the film for having similarities to ""The X-Men"" and the addition of the undead to this film, if anything, it's an enjoyable popcorn action Chinese film with enough differences that it's far from being an X-Men wannabe but becoming its own intriguing storyline about an investigative team with supernatural abilities.",1372896000,6,6100,4.941118743866536

8562424,4,B00B4MMVVY,"there are some nice surprises with this DVD - (1) it's Region 1 so i can play it on my laptop instead of my region-free player - (2) it has english subtitled extras - primarily a behind-the-scenes featurette that goes on for 24 minutes (it looks like it's ending - then i starts a new segment)

when i first saw this film - i got hooked - the story is a extremely complex cuz there are many characters on screen and off  to remember - and their dynamics are pretty complicated - frankly i had to watch it more than once to get it straight in my head - but at least i enjoyed it during subsequent viewings too - this film is a thoughtful one with action scenes rather than the other way around - and i'm the type that likes something deep rather than something simple and superficial

while the film has been chided as being derivative of hollywood superhero films - it really isn't (in fact - hollywood films have appropriated the martial arts and other stunts used by the chinese) - long time fans of chinese martial arts films will find nothing new here - except the movie-making techniques - which have become highly sophisticated - with lots of traveling & sweeping camerawork - and special effects - on par with the best of hollywood

i must admit a non-cinematic bias tho - i fell in love with Liu Yifei while watching this film - she played a moody wheelchair-bound mind-reader - she's made up in a kinda of plain looking style to suit her character & the fashion of the time - yet she was able to bewitch me - enabling me to see thru to the stunning beauty beneath - i compelled me to go find her other films and tv shows - which include the english-language Jet Li/Jackie Chan film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forbidden-Kingdom/dp/B001BEK8HO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forbidden Kingdom</a>&nbsp;- (she lived a few years in the US while young - so she speaks english clearly & fluently with a very slight and adorable accent) - she is absolutely stunning in the 2011 remake of A Chinese Ghost Story - (i must warn against the cheap DVD available from a 3rd party available on Amazon - i have a review of the movie explaining that)

my later viewings allowed other actresses to work their charms on me - Jiang Yi Yan as the sexy female police officer of Dept 6 - and pixish Anna Fang in a small role as Butterfly - and the cute Taiwanese-born Emma Wu (nickname: Gui Gui) in a supporting role as Ding Dong - (for kpop fans - she was 2PM Taecyeon's ""wife"" in Global WGM) - and there's Sheren Tang who seems almost too young for her role opposite the Divine Constabulary leader altho the actors are only 5 years apart - there are many other pretty women in this film - watch it and find your own dream woman

but i shouldn't ignore capable male actors who may not be familiar to western audiences - Deng Chao plays the mangy leading man - Ronald Cheng plays the mustachioed one - Taiwanese-born Collin Chou is the tattooed one - they along with Liu Yi Fei round out The Four crime fighters of the Divine Constabulary - a secret group setup by the King - (based on a series of novels by Woon Swee Oan's called The Four Great Constables)

the aging boss of the Divine Constabulary is played by Anthony Chau-Sang Wong - (fyi - a mixed race actor who's father was an aussie who abandoned the mother and child) - the suave villain is played with relish by Wu Xiubo who's character has the maddening habit of touching a finger to women's faces - and evil looking Cheng Taishen plays the ""Sheriff King"" - the head of the local constabulary (""Dept 6"") who jealously guards his jurisdiction from the upstart Divine Constabulary

even tho his role as the Prince in this movie was minor - i mention Waise Lee cuz in 1990's CHINESE GHOST STORY 2 in which he played the cool swordsman who unknowingly works with the bad side

this particular dvd resides in my home library and i re-watch a lot",1477008000,2,3932,4.518987341772152

8562426,1,B00B4MMVVY,"Incoherent plot, one-dimensional characterization, cheap CGI, action sequences punctuated by senseless pauses.  This is one of the worst pieces of trash I have seen.  Why all the positive reviews?  Waste of time and money that I can't get back.  They should stop making movies like this.",1471478400,,287,5.173913043478261
