8145389,5,B000IHVKFO,"Every shot and ever edit in ""Motor Psycho"" are as perfectly crafted as any in Orson Welles's pictures. Russ Meyer shows how a low budget is not always an impediment to quality filmmaking.
Technically, ""Motor Psycho"" is probably better than ""Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!"".
It is fast-moving violent picture, though not graphically so, with moments of breathless excitement.
The acting is typical of a Meyer film, so don't look for Olivier here, but it's strong and gripping storyline will take you along for the ride.
One of Meyer's best.
For a nudie, ""Good Morning and Goodbye"" is actually a film about moral values and the comeuppance at the end is gratifying. Worth a look.",1281225600,,676,4.93859649122807
8145390,4,B000IHVKFO,"Motor Psycho is one of my favorite Meyer's films; it has everything that made him famous: Skin, tits, confusing plot, violence, memorable lines.",1271635200,,144,5.304347826086956
8145391,5,B000IHVKFO,"O.K. in all honesty MOTOR PSYCHO isn't one of my favorite RM flicks.  its basically the film that came before Faster Pussycat... Faster Pussy was a remake, but with an all gal gang... and wound up history... But poor Russ... apparently it bombed at the box office, so back to the nudies... kind of...

Good Morning and Good Bye has a lot of the rock and roll campyness of FAST PUSSY... only the (revealed) big boobs and overt sexual content are back... (of course its Russ style sex... meaning hillariously funny.)  - - I like to think of it as Bunuel w/ Boobies.

This film (in glorious color) is about a MENAGE-a-errrr... 11...  but mainly the story of a husband and wife who have a bad relationship...  The wife is a swinger, and sleeping around with everyone because her husband (played by Stuart Lancaster, the old man from Faster Pussy) isn't - - up to the task.  The problem is she has a hot step daughter and everyone wants to sleep with her (she's only 17 - - jail bait) - - and step mommy's not too happy... Meanwhile, Haji (who's looking her most hot and exotic) plays a - - lady of of mysticism and nature who has a magical solution that's bound to prove that 50 ain't old... its just the start of things.

John Waters was a huge RW fan... and he claims that the RM chicks influenced a lot of the chicks in his film... in fact, if you're a JW film some of the dialogue will really sound familiar...

Featuring RMs hottest cast... the film drags a bit in the begining (there's some funny Ed Wood type narraration) - - but once it starts rolling, its rolling with some pretty mega-groovy dialogue  - - Overall, a dramatization about the battle of the sexes as only Russ Meyer could imagine it...  What it lacks in the sharp camera shoots and fast pacing of Pussycat, it makes up for in great lines (I won't spoil 'em - - they're so well delivered its best to hear) - - and it doesn't hurt when they're coming from the mouth of one of Russ's all time hottest discoveries, Alaina Capri.  (Oh and a very young Don Johnson is in it too... but don't hold that against the film!)",1162425600,,2083,4.326478149100257
