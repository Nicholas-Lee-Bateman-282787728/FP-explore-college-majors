5672759,4,B00BTJTYB2,"There is no question that Warner Brothers this year is celebrating its 90th anniversary in motion pictures. They have appealed to all ages young and old from greats like The Bodyguard and Casablanca. But anyway that it states, there is still that has never gone out of style for nearly a century. The classic acts of the definitive Looney Tunes cartoons. Throughout the original Termite Terrace days, and beyond, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and many others have continued to entertain kids and adults of all ages of generations. Even with time and grace, the class cartoons from Warner Brothers have honestly gotten better with age, because like when cartoons stay young by only laughter, they still remain fresh and exciting with time and fun. hard to believe it has been a decade since the Looney Tunes have been on DVD with the classic Golden Collection. Since then, there have been nearly 400 of the delightful greats that have been on video, better than ever. But they are being reissued again, to celebrate a great era of animation. The past Platinum Collections have been fair, but there could have been better. Now, there is a more definitive collection.

Best Of Warner Brothers: 50 Cartoon Collection Looney Tunes, is a cavalcade of Warner Brothers most iconic Looney Tunes cartoons that have ever been made from greats like Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng, to Robert McKimson. The collection shows the best of the best, and shorts that still remain a joy to watch today, as they did back then with classics from Oscar-winning funnies like Knighty Knight Bugs and the iconic Speedy Gonzales, to the definitive musical masterpiece What's Opera Doc? and the surreal of dreams like The Great Piggy Bank robbery with Daffy Duck. The cartoons have all been remastered to the best intentions well, and still remain as fresh to watch today, as when they did back then. The collection stands out a lot more not just in price, but also as a full-blown reintroduction. While you mostly do get your moneys' worth here well, most of these shorts were from the past Platinum Collections from last year, and the Golden Collections from 2003-2008, they are still great to watch, because this really stands out to be the best of the best. You really do get better for your moneys' worth in laughter, but as a reminder of why we shouldn't ""That's All Folks!"" to some of the most influential animation that hasn't even came close for this generation to enjoy.

All in all, there have been Looney Tunes collections that have mainly offered mixed bags for their money the past several years, but this one definitely delivers better for die hard Looney Tunes fans, as well as anyone that has never seen a classic line What's Up Doc?, be uttered from Bugs Bunny before. The Best Of Warner Brothers: 50 Cartoon Collection Looney Tunes is definitely a great buy for the young at heart. Maybe this one, will finally make another generation finally laugh their hearts off.

There were some other ones, whose titles escape my memory, i.e. Bugs Bunny the one with the opera star(Leopold) and the one with the Big Bad Wolf and the 3 Little Pigs(click).  The Daffy Duck cartoon where he's the sheriff and Porky Pig as comic relief. They're missing the other 2 Bugs, Daffy and Elmer hunting cartoons. Foghorn Leghorn with the chicken hawk or Rhode Island Red. I would put them in get rid of the pre 1950's. No question about it, the 50's was the golden age of Looney Tunes.

5672869,5,B00BTJTYB2,"It seems that the fans and WB have been at war for a while, with the fan's demanding every single Looney Tunes and Merry Melodies cartoon remastered and released and WB, instead, releasing only a certain amount (usually featuring the more famous characters) and frequently re-releasing the same ones in multiple releases.

I can understand both sides. As a fan, I wouldn't mind having every cartoon WB ever made (although there are a few rough black and white entries and late '60s cheapies that I'd probably only watch once). But when you look at it from the perspective of the company, what's really the impetus to invest the time and money on remastering over a thousand cartoons when a great deal of them (most not featuring the bunny, the pig, or the rest of the marketable characters) inspire little interest in most consumers?

... that has nothing to do with this release, because this is something new, unique: a 'best-of' release for casual fans. A veritable Whitman's sampler. Personally, I wonder why a release like this hasn't existed for years. My nephews love these cartoons, and every time they come to visit I'm digging through my DVDs to show them various cartoons. Now, these kids aren't obsessive fans like me, and aren't likely to invest in dozens of DVDs and Blu-Rays, so last Christmas I got them this set. It doesn't contain all their favorites, but it does have a great many of them. They loved it!

So this isn't a release for obsessives: it's one for nephews. It's a perfect gift for those with foggy memories of loving these cartoons or for those young folks who'll make up the next generation of fans.",1389398400,13,1630,4.732394366197183

I have seen what they call cartoons today and now I know where all the kids get their violent actions from.  it isn't from what I and a lot of the baby boomers out there have seen while growing up.  i'll get off my soap box now.  love the dvd's and they were a great gift from santa.
