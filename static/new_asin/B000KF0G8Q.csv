8156270,5,B000KF0G8Q,"If you're looking for something that is inexpensive to use for teaching elementary-age kids, this is it!  I teach 5th and 6th graders at my church and we rotate through this 18-week series every 2 years.  The 3D graphics are wonderful and the stories are all very educational and entertaining (including Creation, Noah and the Flood, Tower of Babel, Abraham and Isaac, Sodom and Gomorrah, Jacob and Esau, and Joseph).  They also include music videos to sing and a review quiz to see what the kid's remembered.  A must buy!!",1386115200,,523,4.777777777777778
8156271,5,B000KF0G8Q,"Wow!  This set is really amazing.  My niece and nephew have watched all of these dvd's over and over again, and they show no sign of slowing down.  Every time they come to my house, these dvd's are their go to.  They pick these over my collection of Pixar movies.  That really says something about the quality of these shows, and the message.  This set is really the best you can get.  If you want to keep your kids entertained while teaching them about the bible, then this is for you.  The special features are also outstanding.  This will keep the kids entertained for hours, and honestly, I love watching them as well!",1384732800,,622,4.433628318584071
8156272,5,B000KF0G8Q,"This is a must have Genesis Bible DVD Set.  We love the way it is made and we watch it repeatedly.  However, make sure you do not overpay for it.  We got ours brand new for around $60.",1307750400,,184,3.789473684210526
8156273,4,B000KF0G8Q,"great videos for all ages, I gained new insights from watching. Transaction time was awesome, arrived even faster then projected and kids could watch it easter Sunday. Thanks",1273190400,,174,5.25
8156274,4,B000KF0G8Q,"I homeschool my two girls ages 7 and 10.  I bought these from [...] and only paid $24.97 on sale plus shipping.  Normally I find Amazon has the best price but not at the moment.  My kids really enjoyed watching these and it prompted lots of interesting questions, some of which I needed to ask my husband how to answer.  Definately keeps them captivated and also is a good learning tool to use for learning about the Bible in addition books and attending church. I would recommend them after watching the complete set.  I would also suggest watching them with your kids so it is easier to answer the questions about it they may have.",1267315200,,633,4.469565217391304
8156275,5,B000KF0G8Q,I teach a class of six and seven year old kids on Wednesday night and they love these videos. They love the 3-D effect.  It looks and sounds so much better than ordinary cartoon videos.,1229385600,5,185,4.285714285714286
