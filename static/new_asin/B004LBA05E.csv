8434198,1,B004LBA05E,"One of the worst ""documentaries"" I've ever seen. Poorly conceived, badly researched, badly shot on obviously cheap equipment, full of factual error and nonsense preconceptions about Japanese culture and the supposed reverence for nature that the Japanese evince. How this got shown at SBSW or got distribution is beyond me...as it's really a student grade POS.",1513468800,,360,5.446428571428571

8434200,5,B004LBA05E,"Documentary and poetry weave together the sense of what it feels like to be among those who embrace this culture. If you are looking for a history channel style documentary this isn't it. If you are looking for relief from the staleness and excess from your documentaries, this IS it. This is a rare sort of film, but not necessarily for a rare sort of film watcher. Try it, you might find yourself craving more films that break the mold such as this.",1412553600,,451,4.445783132530121
8434201,1,B004LBA05E,My local natural history museum showed this film so I thought it would be filled with philosophical and scientific information.  I loved the sections with haiku but the rest of the film seemed to be taken up with long footage of beetles trapped in jars and boxes being purchased for exorbitant prices.,1389139200,,301,4.788461538461538
8434202,4,B004LBA05E,"Poetic and visually stunning documentary that offers a vision of the Japanese culture's infatuation with insects. The film observes, interprets and presents gorgeous visual documentation of this phenomenon that really transports the viewer to another world.",1388707200,,257,6.166666666666667
8434203,5,B004LBA05E,"Fast service - good product.  What more do I need to say?  It is exactly what I wanted and I would recommend this product and seller.  I love this documentary.  It combines science, culture and is wonderful.  Expand your world and appreciate nature.",1358640000,,249,4.6976744186046515
8434204,5,B004LBA05E,Excellent editing of fascinating subject matter and great soundtrack; film causes one to reflect upon life in general as well as wonderful cultural differences.,1353801600,,160,5.708333333333333
8434205,5,B004LBA05E,"I first saw this at the Gene Siskel Film Center in Chicago in 09, great educational film, my 10 year old brothers loved it!  Some of the bugs shown are ones that I as a western viewer would have never even thought existed.  Beautifully done, a little bit like microcosmos.",1353110400,,272,4.42
