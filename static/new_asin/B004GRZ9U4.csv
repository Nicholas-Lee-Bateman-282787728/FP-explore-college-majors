4373691,5,B004GRZ9U4,"Instead of having expensive bootlegs dvd's and video floating around for sale, the company that have made the six million dollar man series ( universal, i think) should seriously think about releasing the episodes on dvd.

There is tons of fans out there that are just begging for that kind of set, me included.

The 80's fad and 70's fad is in.

dukes of hazzard, charlie's angels, starsky and hutch. etc... are being released out in dvd form so why can't smdm can't?

makes good business sense and it would benefit a lot of hardcore fans!!!

we should try to make some kind of formal demand for it and see if the company would move...along that a release of bionic woman would be great!!!",1090627200,7,690,4.532258064516129
4373692,5,B004GRZ9U4,"Oh Man, how long have I waited for this. I loved the SMDM back in the day. I guess I was around 9 or 10 when it first came on. From the pilot episode to the last one, I was hooked. Did you know that the UK and other parts of Europe already have the SMDM and also the Bionic Woman on dvd? My question is, Why haven't we got these classic shows on dvd already? These are American shows. We should have gotten these first. Dont get me wrong, I have nothing against our British friends for having them, but why neglect us here in America? I just hope that Universal wakes up and discovers that there IS an American market for these classic shows to be put on dvd format. If they can put CRAP like Friends and Celebrity Mole, and other lame shows on dvd, why not great, classic shows like the SMDM on dvd? Im still waiting....",1089849600,107,821,4.105590062111801

I would like to see Steve Austin ( Lee Majors ) in the crash and be turned into a machine. The Stunts are outstanding. I am also of interest of The Bionic Woman.

I barely remember this show to be honest lol But my dad assures me that it's the coolest thing ever. I read that Lee Majors is the one holding up the release...shame on you Lee! lol Apparently he was injured during an episode or something and wants more of a percentage from this being released. Well that was what I read anyway lol.

4373699,4,B004GRZ9U4,"When the NASA pilot crashes in a near-fatal accident, Colonel Steve Austin becomes a test subject for state-of-the-art cybernetic enhancements. In return for his new abilities, Steve begins working for OSI, an agency that guards the United States from continuous threats and danger.

Lee Majors stars as the iconic Colonel Steve Austin the ""Six Million Dollar Man."" The show, beginning first as two movie pilots, started as a slow-paced drama. But as the show was picked up for regular season, so did the action and adventure. Lee Majors played Steve as a reluctant hero and very down-to-earth (even though a famous NASA pilot), who happens to have an extraordinary gift. Though of course, the special effects are very out-of-date and some situations are a bit hokey, this incredible show still holds up today, with plenty of drama, action and adventure.

The Six Million Dollar Man also produced the spin-off The Bionic Woman, starring Lindsay Wagner, (an almost equally iconic character of the decade) and several reunion specials. Science fiction enthusiasts that were around in the 70s and early 80s remember the show with fondness. I was a child, who caught the show on reruns and was especially fond of the Bionic Woman as well. And I'm happy to say that re-watching this classic series, and reunion specials in particular, was still a fun and memorable experience as an adult.

4373700,5,B004GRZ9U4,"First off, just received this set yesterday and reviewed a few episodes. The episodes have never looked better, even better than the original broadcasts.

However, they have only mastered and fine tuned the videotape stock of the series and not struck a new master from the original negative. Therefore, you will notice that redness of the color and specks of dirt from the syndicated versions of the series. It is uncut and not altered in any way. It is unfortunate that the films were not available to be fine tuned and remastered.

Sound is in it's original mono and was not mastered into any surround channels... Would have been a nice audio option.

But the abundance of Bonus materials and all new interviews, plus the inclusion of all three pilot movies, including the syndicated versions. plus the reunion movies, more documentaries and interviews, including a nearly two hour Lee Major featurette as well as one on Richard Anderson!!!

If you are a huge fan of the series and want the entire series; all 100 episodes plus the movies, than I highly recommend this set. The box is nicely designed and compact. and neatly packaged. All episode titles and air dates are clearly listed... To bad there is no plot synopsis to make it easier to pinpoint the episodes you want to review.

For me, this is a real treat and was my favorite series growing up as a kid. Rewatching the series, although somewhat dated, is still very nostalgic and helps me recall how simple the times were during the 70's growing up, without the video games, or computer influence. Back in those days, you really had to use your imagination to inspire your own adventures as a child.

This what the series meant for lots of fans my age and I'm proud to endorse this set.",1290124800,,1749,4.680781758957655

4373702,5,B004GRZ9U4,"I used to love watching Colonel Steve Austin and Jaime Sommers do their thing...bionic thing, back in the days. I was living in Concord when I first watched The Six Million Dollar Man at the age of 8yrs old. I loved it then, and I still love it now,at mid-forties. I was extremely upset when Jiame died. But then I was happy when the producers and directors decided to bring her back to life. My question is why are other seasons imported, not made for USA? That Sucks!!! I'm sure there are lots of Bionic Fans like me who are angry with that. I mean, we got ""garbage"" shows on television that aren't worth the time and energy! I believe that The Six Million Dollar Man and The Bionic Woman should be made for USA. They are our old-time classics which we are now deprived of seeing!

Even during the brief run of the Bionic Woman remake there wasn't enough financial incentive to cut through the legal problems, so you can bet there won't be now that the remake bitten the dust.

I've beenw waiting for the past 4 years when they said they were going to release them and now I'm tired of waiting.  I'm just going to order the boxed sets from either the UK or Australia!  A friend told me that Netflix has already set up a page on their TV shows section for SMDM, which means it's about to be released.  I checked it out and they indeed have set it up for SMDM but NOT TBW.

He says that Universal owes him, because he now has back and leg problems due to the physical stunts that he used to do for the show.  It'll be soon, be patient.  At least, The Incredible Hulk (now season 2)and Wonder Woman (The Complete Series)are now out.

4373721,5,B004GRZ9U4,Oh Man! I'm feeling so nostaligic right now. Because I just loved this show when I was a kid. Although it came out before I was born I think it ran in syndication well into the 80's. As soon as I'd finish watching an episode I'd go outside and try to run in slow motion like Steve Austin did. Or find something high to jump off of. I'll never forget that special sound effect whenever Steve used his bionics. I just loved that sound. I know the sound affects and footage may seem cheesy by today's standards but I think these shows aired when television was at its best. Nowadays with all these reality shows (that's as about as close to reality as superman)is just really getting boring. I was wondering what was taking so long for these shows to get released. Because I can't wait to see them again! This show and Wonder Woman were the bomb back in the day.,1176422400,5,859,4.308641975308642

One of my friends is a big fan of The Bionic Woman, so for his birthday I bought him season one of the series and backed up the DVDs without a problem.

This is my request to Universal... PLEASE get this series to DVD, while those of us who remember the show can still enjoy it!
UPDATE:  I agree that Universal SHOULD cut Majors in for a piece of the action.  Why not?  Certainly they will still profit.
And since there are two sides to every negotiation, I also implore Mr. Majors to be reasonable in settling a deal.  What does anyone gain by waiting?  Everyone loses...especially us fans who have been waiting patiently for soooo long.

Is Lee Majors a part of this delay? Would be nice to get an update of some kind.

The Six Million Dollar Man and The Bionic Woman were awesome tv shows with GREAT action and special effects. Lindsay Wagner won an Emmy for her portrayal of ""Jaime Sommers"" and her double ""Lisa Galloway"" in the two parter ""Deadly Ringer"". The Special effects of the millineum pretty much suck because they are pretty much computerized (digital CGI) and actually looks cartoonish/fake. As opposed to real men and women doing hardcore stunts. These 2 shows should come out already, come on Universal let these shows take that Bionic leap onto DVD!

***************************************************************

...At a special 25th anniversary screening last night at the American Cinematheque in Hollywood of the Buck Rogers in the 25th Century theatrical film, Universal Studios Home Entertainment VP of Marketing Robert Reed confirmed that both The Six Million Dollar Man and The Bionic Woman are currently being prepared for DVD release in 2005. Figured you classic TV fans would like to hear that good news!

***************************************************************

Fantastic news!  No date yet in '05 but we'll keep watching for it :)

Bionic Woman was thought to have originally been scheduled for late '04 release since Universal had included this series in a recent promo DVD ""DVD's in 2004"" chapter but it looks like they decided to release it together with the Six Million Dollar Man series next year.

4373740,5,B004GRZ9U4,"Like everyone else, Ive been wondering when this would be out in DVD format.  I recently read a rumour that Lee Majors is suing Universal for unpaid royalties during all the years that the show has been running in syndication.  If true, this is probably the reason we don't have it yet.  I hope he gets all he wants from it.  In the meantime, Jim Carrey(??!!) has signed on to play Steve Austin in an upcoming 'comedic' remake.  The director is the same guy who directed 'Old School' and the recent film version of ""Starsky and Hutch"" with Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson.  This is bad news as far as Im concerned.  If they would take the story seriously and get a serious actor, it could be a great sci-fi/action flick.  It just goes to prove that you can never underestimate the bad taste of studio executives.

However, as long as the studio gives us a well made package of the original with good extras, we'll just have to be satisfied.",1093132800,11,936,4.426900584795321

8428942,5,B004GRZ9U4,"Relive the thrill of watching the Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman, as they both reprise their old familiar roles of the '70s and team up to stop spies and espionage from pentetrating Washington, DC!!

Steve Austin (Lee Majors) and Jamie Sommers (Lindsay Wagner)return in three major TV reunion movies to take on secret missions given to then by their boss Oscar Goldman (Richard Anderson). Together, they help stop crime dead in its tracks, nail the bad guys and help restore law and order with their extraordinary bionic powers!!

Also, keeping a watchful eye over them just in case things might go wrong with their bionics, is Dr Rudy Wells (Martin E. Brooks), who rebuilt them and made them better, stonger and faster that they ever were before they had their top-secret surgeries.

Leaping on the tops of small buildings, lifting and turning cars over, running in excess of 60 mph, bending steel with their bare hands and tossing their attackers up to 30 feet in the air, they take on assignments that no one else would dare to touch!!

This collection of movies is great to have!! Plus, witth the set are several featuretts, where the stars of the movies go behind the scenes to tell you how it's all done and the roles they play, as well as bionics being used by patients in real life!!

This set of DVD's is rather expensive, but I think it is something that you'll want to have, cherish and watch over & over again, possibly forever!!!

The full-length TV films are;

1. The Return of the Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman.

Fortress is hell-bent on getting even with Steve & Washington for helping put Lyle Standing in prison. It takes the help of both Steve & Jamie, plus Steve's son Michael who is now bionic also, to help put the perpetrators back behind bars!

2. The Bionic Showdown.

Steve & Jamie return for another secret mission; To find out who the person is that filtrated Washington as a bionic betrayer. In this one, Sandra Bullock who plays Kate, gets a bionic makeover.

3. Bionic Ever After.

In the 3rd film, Steve and Jamie go abroad to stop another epionage takeover. Their bionics powers are sabotaged by an evil agent who is trying to stop them from foiling their mission. Also, the long-awaited wedding that never took place between Steve and Jamie in any of the shows, finally happens after Steve and Jamie complete their secret mission!!

Plenty of action-packed high-speed super-charged adventure in all three films!!!
