8482865,5,B005Q325NQ,"I loved this movie when I was younger. I thought it was one of the best ones Shirley Temple ever did. I hope it comes out on DVD soon.

I would really love to own a copy.",1392508800,4,170,3.5945945945945947
8482866,4,B005Q325NQ,"Clifton Webb is even more witty and clever as he reprises his role as Mr. Belvedere. He supplies many amusing zingers throughout the film, leaving most of the other characters repeatedly non-plused.  The supporting cast is also strong.  I hope this film makes it to DVD at least.  A Blu-ray set of all three Belvedere films, even better.",1381449600,6,337,4.775862068965517
