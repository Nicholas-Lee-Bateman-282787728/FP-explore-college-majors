The actor who played the husband didn't do a good job, but Alice, the wife makes up for it. The reviewer before this says there isn't gore...but there is implied gore...like a shovel on a wrist, and blood on white gowns.
Filmed with suspence in mind, the movie moves at a fast pace. The images are top notch, and the chills down right creepy at  times. The ending on the lake, however, did not fit with the rest of the story and I took a star away because of that and the husband's bad acting.

Special note: The most chilling scene is when the killer puts a bloody finger to his lips going ""Shhhhhh............""",1159056000,,706,4.3816793893129775

I bought this movie previously viewed and with nightmare in the title and being a horror movie fan, it looked like it might be a good horror/slasher flick. Not the case. I have seen worse so that's the reason for the 2 star rating. The plot: a married couple witness a murder so now they are taken to a secluded safe house for their own protection by a FBI special agent. When the 3 arrive at the home, they find it abandoned. The FBI agent suddenly begins to act strangely. Alice (the wife) begins having visions of murder and starts suspecting the FBI agent is possessed by the spirit of a psycho who murdered his family in the same house many years ago. She confronts her husband with all of this and tries to convince him it's time for them to leave but he doesn't believe her and thinks she is going crazy. From that point on, Alice must do whatever it takes to save her and her husband's lives. No great acting, no great filming and no gore. Christmas Nightmare fails to live up to it's name.",1141430400,2,1151,4.236363636363636
