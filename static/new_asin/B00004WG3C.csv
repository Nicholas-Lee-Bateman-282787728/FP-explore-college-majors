1364438,5,B00004WG3C,"My family bought this series because we enjoyed Penelope Keith so much as Margot Ledbetter in Good Neighbors. I must say that though I enjoyed Good Neighbors, I liked this series much better.
Penelope Keith plays Audrey fforbes-Hamilton, a new widow whose family has owned Grantleigh Estate for 400 years. Much to yher snobbish dismay, she is forced to auction the house to cover her late husband's death. The manor is bought by Richard DeVere (Peter Bowles). He is charming and well intentioned but he is (gasp!) in trade and (double gasp!) of Eastern European descent. He naturally makes many a faux pas trying to settle into his new home. He and Audrey are attracted to one another but they are both too set in their ways. He is too blue collar, she is too blue blood.
Every episode in the series involves one of Audrey's plots. Either to win Richard, control him, snub him or put him in his place. To make money, to wrangle her way back into the manor, to run the Girl Guides or to save the town's railway station. She is aptly described by another character as a female bossy boots. And a very amusing one, I must add. Richard is usually caught unprepared by the Audrey onslaught but he wins a few battles himself. It's all great fun.
While it is easy to make a big deal of the two very talented lead actors, the supporting cast is also very good. The slippery vicar; Audrey's mousy best friend Marjory; the grumpy shop keeper; and Richard's mother ""Mrs. Pooh"" are all great character actors and greatly add to the overall series.
Unlike many sit-coms, To the Manor Born has something of a linear plot line. (Though not so much of one that you cannot watch an episode on it's own) And it has an actual ending. A very nice one too.
The humor style is quite British so if you are not a fan of Brit-coms, you probably won't like it. If you feel you will like the series, I encourage you to buy the complete set rather than piece meal. Partly because of the linear plot line and partly because you will be hungry for more. This is a great series for snow days and when you are under the weather. It is suitable for children and very amusing for adults.",1017446400,31,2153,4.425692695214106
1364439,3,B00004WG3C,"As a comedy, 'To the Manor Born' was never particularly uproarious, even at the time.  During especially lumbering episodes, you can imagine a young producer prodding audience members with a pole, such is the feeble muffle of the laughter.  The inert primitivism of the comic drama is matched by a far more serious ridiculing of the labouring classes, all bumbling 'oo-ar' stereotypes that would have seemed far-fetched in Stella Gibbons' classic rural satire 'Cold Comfort Farm'.  The sheen of glamour the country house setting should suggest is actually tatty and tarnished (budgetary stinginess?).  The whole thing would actually be unwatchable if it wasn't for the relaxed skill and immense charm of the leads, Peter Bowles and Penelope Keith, King and Queen of British Light Entertainment.
If it fails as comedy or romance, 'Manor' was of immense cultural importance.  Made in the early years of the Thatcher administration, the programme aimed to reconcile two mutually conflicting ideals of British Conservatism - the centuries-old, tradition-bound, socially congealed yet communal, landed gentry, represented by Audrey fforbes-Hamilton, now economically and politically a dead duck, but receptacle for what so any believe is best and characteristic in British Culture; and the radical conservatism of the new regime, economically aggressive, socially fluid, rule-breaking, go-getting.  In fact, the laissez-faire decentralising self-centredness of the latter was actually destroying the former, leading to anxieties this programme seeks to assauge.  Beginning with a death and the disruptions of homelessness, the programme moves like a Shakespearean comedy towards political Hymen, playing out all the tensions and fears in between, crises about identity, class, nationality, gender, generations, home.  In a superb, time-honoured allegory, the manor represents the nation, and the struggle beween Audrey and Richard is for its soul.  As happened so often during the 1980s, the proletariat are bandied about like so many frayed shuttlecocks.",1010534400,8,2050,5.717105263157895
1364440,4,B00004WG3C,"The main character is a rich widow who in the first episode throws her hat up in the air in joy upon leaving her husband's funeral service.  Unfortunately, she finds her husband left her with less money than expected, and horrors! A businessman of Polish decent moves into her old mansion, and she decides that the man is not her kind of people.  Much of the humor comes out of the main character being out of touch with how other people live and her own snobbishness.",1008806400,3,468,4.430232558139535
1364441,5,B00004WG3C,"I was looking for another intelligent Britcom and decided to give this a try. What a pleasant surprise! I have to admit not being a fan of ""Good Neighbors"" nor did I care much for the character Penelope Keith played in that earlier series. But she is PERFECT as Mrs. fforbes-Hamilton. In fact this is about as well-cast a series as I've ever seen. I've let several friends borrow my tapes and they've all enjoyed them.
To answer a question others seem to be asking, this gift set contains the entire set of 20 episodes - including the rare 1979 Christmas special. I sure wish they'd release this (and Yes Prime Minister) on DVD. Until then, we have this great gift set.",981763200,,669,4.491803278688525
1364442,4,B00004WG3C,"Set in the rural English countryside, this very-English comedy series pokes fun at both English life and the aristocracy.  The self-made businessman (and imigrant) Richard Devere and the recently widowed Audrey fforbes-Hamiliton are at odds after she is forced to sell, and he in-turn buys her ancestral home.  Moving to a nearby (and much smaller home), Audrey keeps an eye on her beloved estate all the while scheming to get it back someday.  Throughout the series Audrey and DeVere clash and occasionally get along, engaging in one-upsmanship, and all the while begin to develop an admiration for each other, leading to a surprise conclusion to the series.
The series was very well done and will leave you laughing for weeks, especially if you enjoy British humor.  My family and I enjoyed the series so much we made a special side trip while in England to see the estate used in the filming of the series.
Cheers!",972432000,15,917,4.858974358974359

7925232,5,B00004WG3C,"First bought this on VHS, before DVD existed.

I loved this series when I first saw it on PBS.  Penelope Keith is perfect in her role as the former lady of the manor, forced to sell off after the death of her husband.  She ends up in the cottage on the estate.  The new owner is a ""new"" millionaire.  Audrey (Keith) soon bullies, cajoles, begs and tricks the new lord of the manor into conforming with the age old traditions of the village.

Lots of fun.

For Keith fans, she recently appeared in ""Death at Pemberley"" in a small part 2013.  Still great.  Also, don't miss The Good Neighbors.  She is even funnier in that series.",1417219200,,628,4.336206896551724
7925233,5,B00004WG3C,"This product arrived quickly and was in excellent condition, despite having been ""used"".  I would not hesitate to buy from the seller in future.",1243900800,,144,5.0
7925234,5,B00004WG3C,"""To the Manor Born"" is one of my favorite BBC comedies.  I first viewed this series on PBS in the early 1980s, shortly after it was filmed (1979-81) and recognized Penelope Keith, Lady Audrey Fforbes-Hamilton, as the same actress who played Margo Ledbetter in ""Good Neighbors.""  This show was well cast, with supporting actress Angela Thorne (Marjorie Frobisher), and Audrey's protagonist (played by Peter Bowles), Richard DeVere.

I enjoy the witty dialogue and repartee between actors.  There is humor, but it is never overstated, never tacky, never vulgar.

The chaste language should appeal to anyone, no matter how conservative.  Yet, the class distinctions, snobbishness (Audrey's reference to Richard, a native born Slovak turned British citizen as ""not one of us"") tells volumes about class struggles, jealousy, bitterness over changing circumstances which can apply to anyone, not only Britain in the 1980s with changing economic status, class system, etc.  Richard, a self made millionaire and owner of a grocery store chain, buys Audrey's home and grounds (The Manor) in Episode 1, and Audrey, forced to sell on her late husband's death, is broke and forced to endure someone of a lesser social class (but much greater wealth) living in her former home.

The scenery is beautiful, the plots more believable than many TV shows, and overall quality very high.  I have owned this series for the past 7 years (VHS), enjoying it very much, and expect to re-watch these for more enjoyment in the future.  This is so superior to many American TV shows, and to much of what I've seen from the BBC and other British productions over the past ten years.",1125705600,5,1654,5.047794117647059
7925235,5,B00004WG3C,"'To the Manor Born' is one of the better Brit-coms, witty and intelligent without being over-the-top or inaccessible.  It has an oh-so-British tone to it, deliberately so, as it looks with grace and humour at the clash of cultures in modern Britain, the clash between tradition and modernity (finding out that neither is always what it seems), as well as the clash between social classes.  All of this is done in such a light-hearted manor, er, manner, that one scarcely realises the biting and insightful satire that runs alongside the comedic situations.

The series begins as Audrey fforbes-Hamilton, a straight-backed, upper-crust woman of breeding who revels in her situation, is celebrating the funeral of her husband (yes, celebrating).  Meanwhile, Richard Devere, wealthy (read, nouveau riche) financial officer heading a multinational conglomerate of food stores, arrives in the village in search of a classic gentleman's period home in the English countryside.  As Audrey's husband was not one to keep up with the bills, she discovers that she is in fact bankrupt, and is forced to sell the manor.  Richard Devere buys it at auction; Audrey is a surprising twist retains the estate's hunting lodge down the road, and the stage is set for the tensions between new homeowner and historical lady of the manor.

Supplementing the main characters are Audrey's best friend Marjorie, who variously has designs on Richard Devere, but these are almost always thwarted; Richard's mother, Mrs. Pu (Poluviska, actually, but the name is reduced for ease by Audrey); Ned, the traditional groundskeeper who helps keep the traditions alive with Audrey; and finally, Brabinger, the quintessential English butler, who relocates to the old lodge with his mistress Audrey, and always has a few suprises up his sleeve.

There are twenty-one episodes in all, filmed and broadcast over a two-year period in 1979-1981.  These run from the start of Audrey's losing the manor through to her regaining the manor, along with the hand of Richard in marriage, but not by the means often expected throughout the series.  Throughout the episodes, Audrey is constantly introduced to 'ordinary life', from having to rely on the National Health for her doctor rather than private-pay, personal service, to having difficulties in shopping in supermarkets (Devere's, as it turns out) and not being able to entertain as she once did, or go on holiday (this makes for perhaps the best episode of the lot, save for the first and final episodes).  Meanwhile, Devere gets lessons in being lord of the manor by the ever-present Audrey, who counsels him on everything from horse-purchasing to community responsbilities.  Despite his wealth, Audrey says, 'he is still at the bottom of it all a grocer.'  This is a biting commentary -- the upper-class disdain for the working class is an undercurrent here, and the entitled/en-nobled folk in Parliament used to insult both Ted Heath and Margaret Thatcher, who were both children of shopkeepers, by using the term 'grocer' to describe them.

From the threadbare carpets to the when-we-were-in-India knick-knacks to the church clock that never worked properly, this is a wonderfully crafted comedy trip through a slice of British culture that is both past and future.  These are not 'issues' episodes -- 'To the Manor Born' educates by stealth.  One might be completely unaware of having been taught ways of acting and being.  Grantley Manor is a perfect backdrop (shot in a town with the very English-sounding name of Cricket St. Thomas), and the actors are perfectly selected.  Penelope Keith as Audrey fforbes-Hamilton has the kind of mannerisms and deadpan delivery befitting a displaced socialite; Peter Bowles has the blustering presence as a self-assured businessman flustered in his new environment.  Old Ned (played by MIchael Bilton) and Brabinger (John Rudling) are perfected cast in both physical type and acting ability.  Angela Thorne as Marjorie Frobisher, the life-long friend of Audrey, always in her shadow, is great as the 'straight man' against whom Audrey's humour unfolds.

The DVD release contains special features including bits about Penelope Keith and Peter Bowles, as well as excerpts from the late-90s radio broadcasts on BBC2.

This is a perfect show, certain to win the heart of any Anglophile.",1091491200,6,4336,5.217579250720461
7925236,5,B00004WG3C,"Audrey fforbes-Hamilton (Penelope Keith) isn't mourning her unloved late husband much, because she now controls the Grantley Manor estate!  Yet almost immediately, she learns the property must be sold to satisfy her husband's death.  When it is sold to Richard DeVere (formerly named Polouvicka, as his aging mother still is) (played by Peter Bowles), owner of a grocery chain, she is shaken to see the land sold to someone (gasp) in trade, but her retreat takes her only as far as the Lodge, in good viewing distance of the Manor.  From there, she will alternately assist and wage war on DeVere, who is determined to bring change to the Manor.  And, as she learns that DeVere is not quite as unattractive as she thought, she wonders if marriage is not the quickest path back to the Manor and out of her financial woes . . .
  Penelope Keith makes this series.  She convincingly plays an aristocrat brought on hard times, but never surrendering in any way.  She is assisted not only by Bowles, but by a cast of supporting actors who bring to life rural England in this classy class-warfare comedy.  The settings are beautiful, but the acting is exceptional.
  Highly recommended.  Buy the boxed set to have the entire series plus one Christmas episode which is rarely shown on TV.
  Perhaps the best of the BritCom series.",1033430400,23,1322,4.741228070175438
7925237,5,B00004WG3C,"One of my fondest memories of childhhod was our local PBS station continuously playing ""Good Neighbors"" reruns.  That cast was perfect and the show a classic, but the person who stood out for me was Penelope Keith.  She just stole every scene she was in.  Quite recently I discovered ""To The Manor Born"" at my local library in their video department and was so happy to see that this series starred Miss Keith as well.  I checked out as many as I was allowed on my card and couldn't wait to watch them all.  Needless to say (or I wouldn't bother to write this) this show was wonderful as well and Penelope Keith is at her best.  Upon viewing every episode, although a ""special Christmas episode"" was NOT on my library's edition, I discovered the boxed set for sale on Amazon and ordered it as soon I saw it.
  Not as cartoonish as Margot in Good Neighbors, her ""Audrey fforbes-Hamilton"" is quite a character indeed and Miss Keith makes her pathetic, comedic, pompous AND accessible all at the same time.  I can't imagine anyone else playing this role as well as Penelope Keith.  If you are a fan of her work or if you are a just a fan of Britain's funniest female actors such as Patricia Routledge, Mollie Sudgen, The AbFab ""Ladies"" etc.,then you MUST, MUST, MUST own the work of Penelope Keith, as she, at least to me, is the Grande Dame of them all!  I would highly suggest that you please buy the boxed set to see the entire series in order.  And as a special feature there's a ""lost"" Christmas episode at the end of the last episode on Tape 6.  In addition to Penelope Keith, I'm sure you'll enjoy this very gifted supporting cast as well and the location shots are very beautiful!  Cheers.",1023494400,15,1694,4.440129449838188
