8423132,1,B004CJQVNK,"Actually I'm writing about a Christmas gift I received.  Two DVDs from Amazon:  this one and Sydney Poitier's Lilies of the Field.  Both were total failures.  We've watched two of the movies off this 3Pack.  Halfway thru each of them the sound and video synch falls totally apart by some 10-15 seconds.  When that happened, I went online to Amazon and ordered a new one at my own expense, hoping it was just a freak occurrence.  So now I have another one on the way (Order 102-2032897-2609065).  I did this because I didn't want the giver of the gift to know the present was useless.  This morning (Dec 26) I decided to watch the Sydney Poitier DVD.  Guess what, folks!  I gives a loading error on each of our three Magnavox DVD players, which have never before failed and don't fail now with other DVDs.  The REGION ERROR indicates the DVD can't be played in this geological area...Texas.  Hmmm.  So I'm online trying to stop yesterday's order and see about getting the two gifts replaced with functional DVDs, but Amazon apparently gives customers no way to contact them.  I'd certainly appreciate an email from them explaining how I can speak with a live human being about this matter, which may otherwise result in my never ordering from Amazon again, etc.  Buyers beware!!!  Oh yes, I tried both of these DVDs several times including two of the movies on the 3Pack.  Same poor results each time.  Shame on you Amazon!",1388016000,3,1422,4.63855421686747
