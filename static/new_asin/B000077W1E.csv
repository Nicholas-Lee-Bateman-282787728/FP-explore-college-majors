The pictures were a bit dark and not very colorful. We will probably never watch the DVD again.",1438300800,,273,4.269230769230769
7974380,5,B000077W1E,"I purchased this cd for my father who has alzhiemers.  I was trying to find anything that would engage him and give my mother, his full time care giver, a small break.  They BOTH love the cd.  The pictures are breathtaking and the piano soundtrack is soothing.",1340841600,,260,4.48936170212766
7974381,5,B000077W1E,"I just had a dinner party and put Living Landscapes on. I knew that I'm easily hypnotized (in a good way!) by it, but I was amazed at how compelling my guests found it to be. We tried the music, which is very pleasant but not cloying piano instrumentals, and the natural sounds won out. There are so many varieties of scenes and I find it fascinating. I used to put this on when I was cleaning the house but then I'd just sit and zone out in front of it!",1181692800,3,454,4.0
