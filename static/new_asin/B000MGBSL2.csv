2734731,3,B000MGBSL2,"This movie is also titled as *Breaking Through* which can be seen on Lifetime channel.  Anyways, I'm surprised that I haven't heard nor seen this movie before.

Kellie Martin plays a 20-year-old deaf woman, Laura.  Laura was never let out of the apartment.  Her father kept her inside, along with her mother, and never let her go to school.  After one too many abusive espisodes, Laura escapes by jumping out of the window but falling down 2 stories.

She wakes up in a hospital with a social worker, who knew signs, looking after her.  It is discovered that she doesn't know signs and is illiterate.  So, in order to have a ""successful"" trial against Laura's father, Laura has to learn a language.

Throughout the rest of the film, Pam, the social worker, works diligently with Laura with (sign) language as well as looking for a place that will take Laura in.  Since many places would not take in a Deaf client or have been shut down, Pam has no choice but to break professional boundaries and let Laura live with her.  This is a modern-day version of Helen Keller and her teacher, Anne Sullivan.

Overall, it was a good movie.  I just think that it's tiresome seeing everyone sign and talk at the same time.  Why hasn't Hollywood thought of adding subtitles during signed dialogues between characters?  Of course, it's also tiresome to see hearing actors play Deaf characters.  ...sigh...

It's amazing to see how young S. Epatha Merkerson looked before she joined Law & Order.

Otherwise, an ok movie.",1178841600,13,1505,4.723076923076923

8168961,3,B000MGBSL2,I was disappointed that a deaf actress was not chosen to play the young woman without language.

8168964,4,B000MGBSL2,I found this movie to be very good and the acting to be excellent. I originally saw this movie on t.v. and was happy to be able to purchase it on d.v. This is definitely worth watching.,1293926400,,185,4.027027027027027
8168965,4,B000MGBSL2,"I first saw this movie on a cable channel, and saw through the made-for-tv nonsense.  The story is about a young woman who is deaf. Her story starts, in the movie that is, with her abusive father dealing drugs in the living room of a very small apartment. Laura, played by Kellie Martin, is taking a basket of freshly folded laundry, and happens in on her father. Furious, he begins to hit her, until her mother attempts to step in. With his rage focused on her mother, Laura desperately tries to escape from his wrath. He charges back at Laura, and literally scares her out of a two story window. Rather than face him, she decides to drop, to what could possibly her demise.
This is how the movie starts. And i was captured immediately.  The acting for the most part is very well done.  The two main actresses, JoBeth Williams, and Kellie Martin are pretty much the focus of the entire film.  As this was made for TV, there are some eye rolling scenes, but overall, they were excusable because of the power behind the story.  This movie, while not perfect, has a lot of heart, and often makes you smile.  While i agree with the previous reviewer that Hollywood should do something about subtitles, i don't fault this movie for not being the pioneer in that aspect.  They took a good story, and did what they could with it.
I would rate this as 4 1/2 if i could.  The cheesy aspect takes little away from the story, and even if it did, i didn't notice it.
I applaud Kellie Martin for her performance in this movie, as she relies on body language to get her feelings across, and does a fantastic job at doing so.
I own this movie. There are no special features, or even chapter selection on the main menu, but i don't regret purchasing it at all.",1219363200,15,1745,4.3808049535603715
8168966,4,B000MGBSL2,this is a story of a girl who cannot hear. Her father thinks she is stupid & makes a slave out of her plus beats her. She jumps out of a window to get away from him. In the hospital a caring woman who can sign takes her in & teaches her how to sign & understand & gets her into a school for the deaf. I have a friend who is deaf so I bought this movie for her even tho it is  not C.C. If the signing is correct I figured she could understand it.,1214956800,,445,3.5876288659793816
