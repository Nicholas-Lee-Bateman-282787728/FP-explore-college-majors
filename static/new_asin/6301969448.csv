395467,4,6301969448,"This film was released by MGM in 1980 as an attempt to capsize the success of John Carpenter's Halloween and it didn't do to bad during it's release because this film does have some good shocks. Armand Masterolini (Perfect Target, Cameron's Closet) is in his directing debuet here, and it centers around a killer who stalks brides. He picks out one named Amy Jensen and starts killing her friends, when she thinks she is being stalked, she gets help from her funny ex boyfriend and a cop who's wife was killed by the stalker three years before. He Knows You're Alone isn't bad at all, it's got an all star cast including Don Scardino and Tom Rolfing (both from Days of Our Lives), Caitleen O'Heaney (Tale of the Gold Monkey), James Rebhorn (Independance Day), and early role for Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan), Paul Gleason (Breakfast Club), Russell Todd (Friday the 13th Part 2, Chopping Mall), Lewis Arlt (TV's Law and Order) and Dana Barron (National Lampoon's Vacation). Just to point out a trivia scene, the beginning of this film is reference to a similar scene at the beginning of Scream 2.",1045267200,,1112,4.737113402061856
395468,4,6301969448,"This movie seems to be a bit underrated, when in fact, the movie itself as well as the actors are very good. Just for the simple fact that it has alot of great, well-known actors starring in it and a decent story-line to follow, it should be rated in a classic-style category. This movie, to me, is one of the best horror flicks of all time. Very scary, indeed!! Definitely gets 4 stars!!!

 Of course Tom Hanks, (the cute jogger in the woods) steals the show. The only thing is, the poor girl (Elizabeth Kemp)didn't get a chance to go out on a date with him, especially after she got up the nerve to get his attention during a jog in the woods. Instead, she agreed to stay at her friends house until her friend arrived home from taking her sister to a slumber party.

395470,2,6301969448,"""He Knows You're Alone"" is one of the ten billion nondescript slasher films released without much interest in the 1980s.  It sets up a simple plot (psycho killer murders brides-to-be), tosses in a few stock characters, and lets loose with the standard genre conventions (people wandering off by themselves, the 'dead' killer rising up for another round, etc.).  The film's key strength is Tom Rolfing's genuinely chilling portrayal of the mute, unhinged maniac.  Unfortunately, you have to put up with a lot of lame padding to make it to his key scenes (many of which rip off John Carpenter's ""Halloween,"" but at least do it well).
Other than that, fans of pop culture will enjoy picking out several actors who appeared in this movie before achieving 'real fame': Paul Gleason (""The Breakfast Club,"" ""Die Hard"") as a standard-issue cop; James Rebhorn (""The Game,"" ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"") as an adulterous college professor, and yes, Tom Hanks as a cocky psychology student.",999216000,,976,5.049689440993789
395471,1,6301969448,"He Knows You're Alone (Armand Mastroianni, 1980)

Mastroianni, who has since become a rather well-known director of TV movies (Virus, The Ring, First Daughter) and series episodes (the remake of ""Dark Shadows"" and the highly underrated ""Friday the 13th: The Series""), made his debut over two decades ago with an absolutely typical B-grade slasher film. This particular piece of mediocrity would have gone the similarly obscure way of such eternal classics as Final Exam and My Bloody Valentine were it not the screen debut of some guy named Tom Hanks, who's gone on to do a few more movies that got much better critical reviews than this-- and for good reason. (It was also the first big-screen role for James Rebhorn, who has since become one of Hollywood's most-seen and lest-known character actors.) You may feel tempted to watch it just to see Tom Hanks.

395472,3,6301969448,"Several years after a jilted bridegroom (Tom Rolfing) killed his fiance,' he returns to town and starts picking off other brides-to-be. He begins to stalk Amy (Caitlin O' Heaney), who's being wooed by her former boyfriend Marvin (Don Scardino), a likable mortician who tries to get her to reconsider her wedding plans while her boorish fiance' is out of town for his bachelor party.  As Amy and her girlfriends (Patsy Pease and Elizabeth Kemp) prepare for her wedding she finds herself being followed by a strange man whom no one else seems to see.  While her friends reassure her that it's just pre-wedding jitters that's making her upset, the stranger closes in on Amy's friends and soon Amy alone is confronted by the man dogging her steps.
This is an overlooked but decent early '80s slasher flick, though it shamelessly steals from Halloween to the point where it makes you wonder if John Carpenter considered taking legal action.  But it's still an enjoyable horror movie with some genuine suspense and scares, as well as some likable characters.  The opening sequence of Scream 2 parodied the opening of this movie years later.  Tom Hanks, James Rebhorn, and Paul Gleason turn up in small roles here.

The hero of the story is a hapless fellow named Marvin who sort of helps stop the killer before he kills the girl but oh so ironically perpetuates the cycle of abuse. (Every jilted groom is a potential serial killer, you know.)
This movie is some kind of time capsule of 1980. The hair styles, the jogging, a post-""Bosom Buddies"", pre-Oscar Tom Hanks in a brief, completely irrelevant role: If you lived through that decade, you'll probably find this a hoot.

With something like 75% of its duration dedicated to pointless errands, unnecessary supporting characters and a drab, one-way relationship drama, this is quite easily the least suspenseful thriller I've ever been unlucky enough to sit through. Even the kills are yawners, perpetrated by a hopelessly wacky, unexplained knifeman without a motive or even a loose pattern. He'll creep out from behind a curtain for a big scare, then stand around in confusion as his prey rushes past to a waiting doorway. At one point he desperately tries to nail down a quarry by furiously stabbing the windshield of their car. It's a total mess; before long it's useless even as fodder for a good riffing or unintentional comedy. A very young Tom Hanks stumbles in for a throwaway role late in the action, but moments later he stumbles right back out, never to be seen again.

I'm surprised this was rated ""R"". This felt more towards the thriller/suspense category in my opinion. The lead girl and lead guy are both likeable people, but the lead girl could be a little more quiet when trying to hide from the killer.

395924,5,6301969448,i love this movie... old horror is the best horror. Creepy movie i love it. Not many big name stars but good!,1372204800,,109,4.0
395925,4,6301969448,"I'm not going to big deal about Tom Hanks. His total screen time was only 5 minutes. His character added nothing to the story whatsoever. But everyone is making a big deal because it is his debut. Do I really need to make a big deal out of the debut performance of a big name actor? No.

The story: a man's girl dumps him for another man. The dumped guy kills the woman an hour before her wedding. Then the killer goes on a killing spree of soon-to-be brides. The dead woman's fiance is a cop who spends years of his life trying to track the guy down.

I felt it was quite suspense without having the dreary moodiness of 70s slasher films such as Silent Night, Bloody Night (a movie I kind of liked). There wasn't mystery here since the killer and his M.O. is revealed from the beginning. I thought the woman who played Amy was realistic in her terror. She didn't go hysterically over the top like some women do in horror movies where they are stalked by killers.

The situations were believable, unlike today's horror. Ever watch ""I Know What You Did Last Summer""? A female character screams and runs away when she finds a messy corpse in her trunk. She returns to the trunk to find the corpse gone entirely. There isn't any blood. So the moviegoer is supposed to believe a killer would put a messy corpse in and out of a woman's trunk for no other reason than to scare her, and in this heavily populated town no one sees him walk around with a corpse in broad daylight? Come on!

However, it is funny how even non-supernatural horror today can be unbelievable. Say what you will about 70s and 80s horror being boring, at least many of those flicks tried hard to be believable. In horror movies today, the victims will be be chased by the killer (sometimes for hours or days), go through rain, mud, snow, dirt, and other types of grime, and in the end, the she'll have her hair and makeup perfect. Aside from a few smudges of mud on her face and dirty clothes, she'll look good enough for a photoshoot for a prestigious fashion magazine. By contrast, the women in this movie actually look and act like the girl next door. Therefore, it's easy to emphasize with them. How about that, a horror movie with good characterization! We don't see that from horror flicks these days.

All in all, I'd recommend this to people who want a quieter slasher flick. There is little to no blood in this movie. That proves gore isn't necessary to jolt the audience (but I still like gore, nevertheless). A good slasher flick needs good suspense, believable characters and situations, a steady pace, and grainy cinematography. I am one of those people who thinks today's horror suffers from the fact that the cinematography is too glossy, high quality, and thus loses the raunchy feel that grainy cinematography from decades ago have that make such an unsettling atmosphere.",1362268800,,2857,4.539805825242718
395926,4,6301969448,"The movie called ""He Knows You're Alone"" may be a blatant Halloween ripoff, but it is a great slasher film anyway, as the killer does seem pretty original. Most slasher films have the killer horribly disfigured or wearing a mask or both, but this killer is just a regular personified lunatic.

This movie is criticized as a complete Halloween clone but its not. It blatantly steals many elements from Halloween, right down to similar music and even shots of the movie but it does contain a lot of originality in plot, villain and a very strong ending. These elements ultimately make the film a effective and suspenseful piece.

In this film, the plot is laid out for the audience rather quickly and violently. A young girl about to get married is murdered in the beginning of the film by a creepy, mysterious and very angry man, who incidentally never speaks throughout the entire film. The audience comes to find out that this particular man is a very dangerous serial killer who HATES ""brides to be."" After the first girl is murdered in a scenario that mirrors the opening of SCREAM 2, the main character is introduced, a girl named Amy played by Caitlin O'Heaney who is about to have a wedding. The killer somehow finds out about it and he begins stalking her. She becomes paranoid and begins excessively watching her back. A detective in this movie named Len, who is obsessed with the killer just as Dr. Loomis was obsessed with Michael Myers, begins to pick up her trail and that leads to a confrontation with the killer.

Perhaps this film's notoriety comes from the fact that this was mega star Tom Hanks' first film as he plays a small but competent role as a young jogger that another girl in the film becomes interested in romantically.

In conclusion, ""He Knows You're Alone"" contains quite a few scary scenes in large part because the killer seems so manic, crazed,determined and violent. While it does borrow from Halloween, the movie does play on its variations enough to be convincing and entertaining in its own right. I recommend this movie to all horror movie fans.",1357948800,,2083,4.714285714285714

395928,3,6301969448,"Some hearts should never be broken.

Poor Amy (Caitlin O'Heaney: 3:00 High, Savage Weekend), not only is she having second doubts about marrying her fiancee but she seems to have garnered some unwanted stalker attention from a complete stranger. She's seeing him everywhere, from her final fitting to buying an ice cream cone to even hiding in the shadows in the haunted house attraction at the local fairgrounds. Who is this guy and what does he want?

Well, as luck would have it, Amy's new friend happens to be a man name Ray (Tom Rolfing) who was jilted by his bride to be and now holds a grudge against any young lady about to say her vows. Not only that, he has the former groom-to-be hot on his trail wanting to bring his own brand of justice to this second rate Michael Myers. Will he succeed or will Amy become the next blood splattered bride?

After the phenomenal success of Halloween, slasher flicks became all the rage, especially holiday theme ones. He Knows You're Alone has taken a more personal holiday and made it the last few days leading up to every bride's big day. Yes, it borrows heavily from Halloween but then what slasher flick doesn't? Halloween borrowed from Black Christmas which in turn borrowed heavily from Silent Night Bloody Night.

He Knows You're Alone is no classic and has largely remained forgotten and for good reasons. For a slasher flick, it lacks any real tension. Our heroine  continually makes the stupidest decisions such as locking the killer in a room behind a door that has a glass window in the center of it and then leaning against said door with the obvious result. Plus never once does she decide to call the police after each continuous encounter with the killer.  Its a miracle in and of itself that the guy just doesn't bump her off after the first five minutes. We also never know why Amy is having her doubts about marrying her fiancee Phil (James Carroll: Girls Nite Out). He seems like a nice enough guy and he isn't stalking her like her nerdy mortican ex-boyfriend Marvin (Don Scardino) who is always just casually popping up.

But despite all its flaws, this movie isn't all that bad. It was made in the 80s and the film makers did strive to try and make it stand out from the rest of the crowd that would eventually follow. Like Final Exam, another largely forgotten slasher flick, Ray doesn't wear a mask. He simply stares with this blank, vacant face like the Stranger in When A Stranger Calls.  And we never really learn why he targets other brides-to-be. Yes he was dumped and he does stab his ex-fiancee to death a mere few hours before her wedding but is that any reason to keeping  picking off random women? And, unlike the rest, there is a rather shocking outcome for Amy.

As a fan of the genre, I picked this up just for enjoyment of seeing it. I wasn't expecting much but I certainly got my $10 worth. Not bad for a rainy evening waster.",1333843200,2,2912,4.540076335877862
396019,5,6301969448,"Yeah, okay, we've heard from a half dozen other reviewers mention that this film came out on the heels of Halloween and that it was cashing in on that film's success. We know that the plot is very similar. So what! This film has that feel of the late '70s and very early '80s that can't be duplicated in modern cinema. From the hairstyles to the clothes, to the .90 cent candy at the movie theater in the opening scenes, to the plethora of '79 or '80 Fords (I guess they got a deal on them - they are everywhere), this film can, under the right circumstances, envelop the viewer and transport him/her into the era. The lighting and the grain of the film is right at home for the period, and the Staten Island locations are just right for the plot. The amusement park, bridal shop, ice cream parlor, and even the creepy old morgue that just happened to be a fallout shelter (this morgue has a massive underground system of tunnels) from the '60s are perfect for a film in this genre. The jogging scenes through the woods is suitably scary as well as the huge old house that is the main setting for quite a few of the scenes (just where were Amy's parents?). All of the main actors/actresses are wonderful in my opinion, Caitlin O'Heaney (Amy) in particular is perfect for the lead. She has that ""victim"" look almost from the getgo with her wide eyes. Amy's friends are also noteworthy, as they all commit horror film ""sins"" (sleeping with the married man, smoking dope, etc.) that lead to their demise. Interestingly, some future big name actors appear in this film, including the mentioned (from other reviews) Tom Hanks (for about 5 minutes - but manages to deliver his lines in a very convincing manner) and Paul Gleason. I also thought that James Rebhorn (Scent of a Woman, etc.) played a convincing hard up professor in this film. All in all, I recommend this film to any fans of this era as the nostalgia factor is very high. While not terribly scary, the film does provide a lot of suspense, and the acting is surprising high quality.",1320624000,,2040,4.501347708894879

I'm almost surprised they weren't sued, especially in the case of the music, which is nearly identical.  That being said, the plot is completely different in many ways.  The mood created, the (somewhat) likeable and relatable characters, and the overall feel of the film elevate it to classic status, meaning one that I personally would watch over and over and that doesn't happen a lot for me. If you like Halloween, The Fog, Prom Night, The Omen (the 70's original versions) you'll most likely like this movie and probably even want to own it. Just watch with an open mind, especially on the first viewing...for me it was one of those movies that I made fun of at first but it can stick to the bones and really grow on you.

396022,2,6301969448,"This is one of those early 80s slasher films that I was just never able to see....until now. As a fan of the genre, I try to see as many little or obscure films that I missed. That you just don't see airing anymore. This is one I have always heard about. I liked the premise, the title was classic, and Tom Hanks made his debut feature film appearance in this. It's gotta be one of those little slasher gems, right?....right? Well, not so much. Here we go....

""He Knows You're Alone"" tells the tale of a serial killer who targets young women who are about to get married. So far, so good. After a great opening, the detective picks up on the killer's trail (and an explanation to the detective's connection to the killer is made). We then meet future Bride Amy (Caitlin O'Heaney), who is having doubts about her upcoming marriage, especially since her ex is always hanging around. It isn't long before the killer sets his sights on Amy, and she and her friends become new fodder for the bride killer.

Released in 1980, the movie came out at a time where Halloween had already exploded, and Friday The 13th was released the same year. This was the beginning of the slasher boom. The movie definitely stole heavily from Carpenter's 1978 classic. The killer coming into view, the music, etc. The idea of the movie seems to be pretty new, but everything else comes from someone else. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, especially since these slasher movies are supposed to be fun and entertaining. The problem is that this movie doesn't do anything, and isn't all that fun, except for the opening minutes and finale. Star Caitlin O'Heaney(who later went on to star as Snow White on the short lived 80s sitcom ""The Charmings"") is a likable ""final girl"", but there isn't much else to offer. There are some decent mood settings here and there, but you get the feeling that the director isn't really in his genre. He knows the beats, but doesn't know exactly how to execute it, or work with a slasher script. Most of it is handled kinda clumsily, and the suspense and tension doesn't ever register too high on the fear meter. It's all photographed in the most workman-like way.

What brings the movie down? I never liked the kinds of slashers where you see the killer as a human being. The killer here is dressed normally, and we see his face every time. For me, that has always lessened the impact whenever there are suspense and tension scenes. He isn't interesting, nor is there anything made clear about him. Pretty boring, laughable killer. Reminded me of the drill killer in ""The Slumber Party Massacre"". Then there is the 'slasher' aspect. The movie is relatively bloodless, the kills(with one exception involving a fish tank) are mundane, the killer stabbing comes off as comical and fake, etc. It doesn't even really succeed on being just a fun, mindless slasher. It's really a dull affair all the way around. The only moments of excitment and interest is in the opening and closing minutes of the movie. And, if you are expecting a lot of newcomer Tom Hanks, forget it. He's in two scenes and that is it. Another familiar face in the movie is Paul Gleason, principal Vernon from ""The Breakfast Club"", as well as other 80s classics such as ""Trading Places"" and ""Die Hard"".

Interestingly enough, Caitlin O'Heaney has never married in real life. I guess the movie scared her too much.

""He Knows You're Alone"" starts off great, and it has a fun ending. It's the drab, boring, bloodless stuff in between that makes it tough to get to the decent climax.",1303862400,,3554,4.625990491283677
396023,2,6301969448,"The opening sequence is pretty good. After that, you might as well turn it off. I guess the remake of Prom Night ripped off the villian. A guy with a crazy stare that can be anyone. It is possibly the worst villian in the history of horror. The movie is slow paced and has no blood whatsoever. Matter of fact, it has barely any cursing and no nudity. It could have easily passed for PG by 80 movie standards. Not really recommended viewing unless you want to see a pre Bossom Buddies Tom Hanks, and he is only in this film for maybe three minutes.",1302220800,,547,4.219047619047619
396024,3,6301969448,"Here's a slasher film more in the mold of Halloween than Friday The 13th, which is to say that the focus is less blood and body count and more of a stab(hehe) at suspense.  Though I wouldn't say the movie is lousy by any means, I actually wish it would have been a bit more on the bloody side, coz as it is, it's too close to Halloween for comfort at times....and not done as well.
A psycho who got the green weenie on his wedding day decides to kill his bride and then go around killing any other bride-to-be he can get his hands on.  His sights are set on the cute, yet naive and kinda loopy Caitlin O'Heaney(I'd always remembered her as the hot english teacher in Three O'Clock High). She's set to marry a guy she doesn't particularly want to marry, though it's never really explained why she seems almost forced to go through with it.  Maybe she just can't say ""no""(my kind of woman).  Aside from being stalked and tormented by the killer, she's also stalked and tormented by her ex boyfriend, Marvin, who's a kooky, lovable, nerdy mortician.  Caitlin seems to have no hangups about flirting like crazy with Marvin while her fiancee is away at his bachelor party.  And speaking of bachelor parties, you may already know that Tom Hanks is here in a small role as the romantic interest of Caitlin's best friend.  Don't get too excited, Hankophiles, he's not on camera too long and his role isn't very relevant, only to spout some psychobabble about why we like being scared by horror films and roller coasters.  There's also a detective with a personal vendetta hunting down the killer, along with that token authority figure jerk from every 80s film(the detention teacher from The Breakfast Club).  The killer, like the killer in Slumber Party Massacre, is shown frequently and is not hidden behind a mask, or disfigured or anything.  He doesn't speak.......but we do know his name is Ray!!
All in all, this movie is just so-so in my opinion.  Aside from a silly looking severed head in a fish tank, the movie is very bloodless.  Plus, it's not terribly suspenseful, especially when many of the techniques are lifted from Halloween.  But it still has it's entertainment value, as pretty much all slasher films from this era do.",1301184000,3,2230,4.615189873417721

I'm going through a nostalgia phase, so I have been looking for a good ""aged"" suspenseful and realistic horror flick from the 70's/80's, that would keep me on the edge of my seat. I decided to purchase this movie just a few weeks ago. This movie had everything I was looking for and more! What I like about this movie is that the events that take place can actually really happen. I'm not one who can sit too long, through movies involving some immortal ""creature"" in the woods killing off teens. This movie takes you into the lives of everyday, average young women, who have no idea of their destiny. The killer looks incredibly deranged, which gives you chills throughout the movie... The movie isn't overly gory, which is a plus. Some movies are a little over the top with the blood, guts etc... This movie gives you just enough to freak you out, but doesn't make you feel like you want to vomit. Look for a young Tom Hanks, which is a pleasnt surprise. Get some popcorn, pop this movie in on a Friday night around 11pm. Make sure the house is very dark and be prepared for a classic scare.",1298851200,4,1202,4.418918918918919

396099,1,6301969448,"He Knows You're Alone is PROBABLY one of the worst horror films I have ever seen. I only recently saw it for the first time and I can't believe I actually wound up sitting through the whole thing. I can honestly saw that I have NEVER been as bored while watching a ""slasher"" flick as I was while viewing this.

I have to say that the WORST aspect of this film would be the killer. I am not SPOILING anything in saying that the killer has no mask or hidden identity in this movie. We see his face right off the bat as he kills his first bride-to-be. The fact that the killer's face is fully in view during his slashings is a total bore. I actually kept thinking they cast the actor for his slightly Michael Myer's-ish facial features and wide eyes. He actually kind of looked like an uncle of mine, which made me laugh. He was totally NOT scary.

The ""killings"" are REALLY REALLY REALLY bad. There is no gore and hardly any blood at all. Gore-hounds would HATE this movie for that fact alone.

The main heroine is a Susan Sarandon look-a-like who annoyed me throughout the whole movie. For a film made in the 80's I was surprised at how un-liberated her character was. She is getting married to a guy she barely likes as if she has no choice, and even mentions how she is going to have to deal with the fact that her fiance told her he doesn't want her to work once they are married. As if she has no right to do what she pleases. That irritated me. Also, what was up with her STRANGE relationship with her ex-boyfriend/mortician. Her behavior was excruciatingly odd to me. What engaged woman would flirt and consider starting  up a relationship with an ex 2 weeks before her wedding??? WEIRD.

Bottom line: The characters were REALLY bad.

The film also blatantly copies Halloween in tons of spots. I couldn't believe some of the scenes! I was like, ""That is almost the SAME shot down to a tee!"" at certain points. I do NOT like copy-cats!!! ahhhh!!

Anyways, I just had to write a review to say how bad I thought this film was. I normally LOVE 80's horror, but this movie killed me with boredom.",1214265600,,2096,4.345268542199489

My babysitter got so freaked out while watching this movie that she grabbed a big kitchen knife to hold onto. I remember being a little freaked out to. So when I saw that it was comming to DVD I was excited. The thing I remembered the most was the fish tank scene. I had told my girlfriend about the movie and even though she doesn't like this kind of movie she watched it anyway. She wasn't scared or creeped out in any way infact we were both extremely bored with it (the only good thing about it was the fish tank scene). This movie was better in my youth simply because I didn't know any better, that and the fact that my babysitter was so freaked out. But now that I'm older I can say without a doubt this movie just sucks, just like another movie I thought was good back then ""Blue Sunshine"".

396102,2,6301969448,"I just rented this movie today because its one of the horror movies of my youth that scared the heck out of me as a teen adult.  I have never forgotten some of the scenes in this movie and still get spooked when I envision the various scenarios.  This is probably a good example of why a young impressionable person shouldn't watch these types of movies.  I am about to watch this movie again after not having seen it for 25 years so I'm curious to see if it still freaks me out like it did then.  I'm a big fan of the older style horror movie, lots of suspense, minimal gore so let's see if this movie is as scary as I remembered back then.  Stay tuned.......

Ok, I'm back, I finished watching the movie.  I can't believe this movie scared me when I was younger.  This is a great example of a movie you remember as a child as being ""sooooo good"" and then when you watch it you realize how we grow up and how time can change things.  I had to stop the movie half way through because I needed a break.  Movie had a great premise but is your quintessential ""b"" rated movie; bad music and bad acting.  I must say though the second half contained 2 scenes that actually had me almost on the edge of my seat.  I can't help but think that if this movie had a bigger budget and some slight story alterations, it could have been a good movie.  Except for a couple of characters in the movie, you don't really get to know any of the victims before they become victims.  This movie clearly jumped on the bandwagon of the ""horror"" parade of movies started by Brian de Palma's Halloween.  I can see distinct similarities in concept i.e. the same house was used as one of the murder scenes and the whole ""someone's following me"" concept is in both movies.  However, the similarities are conceptual only as Halloween is one of the greatest movies of all time and clearly had a bigger budget.

All that being said, this isn't a ""bad"" movie, I mean it's your typical B rated old movie from 1980 but if you know this going in, it's not horrible, just cheesy.",1180915200,,2042,4.248704663212435

396104,2,6301969448,"""He Knows You're Alone"" isn't exactly an apt title considering most of the kills take place when the victim has at least one other person close by, but I guess ""He Knows You're Somewhat alone with Other People in the General Vicinity"" doesn't have quite the same ring? Right off the bat we learn the identity of the killer, so there is no mystery, which is fine if we are looking at a flat-out slasher with a high body count. But ""He Knows"" doesn't really come off as a straight slasher flick, it feels more like a mystery film. The body count is low, the special effects are limited, meaning very little gore. Quite a bit of the film is taken up by Don Scardino and the guy who played the principal in ""The Breakfast Club"" trying to find out when and where the ever-sweaty murderer will strike next. I would have been more generous in my review if there had been either a higher body count, or if we got to see more of the red stuff flow. My guess is, if this came out in theaters today it would have a PG-13 rating instead of R.

I thought the acting was pretty good for a B-Level flick. The comic relief ex-boyfriend/morgue attendant guy was not annoying like most 80's slasher comic relief guys. And I am sure I am dating myself here, but when one of the actresses in the movie puts on these huge headphones and settles down on the floor to jam to some tunes with some.....refreshments. That took me right back to my High School days. I remember doing the same thing many times...only my head didn't later end up in the fish bowl.

 This is an 80's slasher film not very different from other movies of the time; it features young girls being stalked and murdered.  If I had to compare it to other better-known films it's more similar to Halloween (which has a smaller body count and relies more on suspense to make viewers scared than gore) than it is Friday the 13th (which is shocking more due to the large amounts of gory deaths). I wouldn't recommend this movie to people interested in more modern, ultra blood and explicit horror movies He Know's You're Alone does not have much to stand out above the rest, but fans of this genre will at the very least have a good time watching

. The acting is ok, with only a few moments where I didn't find it believable. It even has a few moments where I felt genuine suspense. At the same time it also have a problems. The climax isn't the most . . . climactic, and was one of the less-suspenseful parts of the movie. It also lacked music that would have aided in the suspense, and often, even during the climax, it was just silent.

396200,3,6301969448,"This is now out on DVD with a commentary by Director Armand Mastroianni and Writer Scott Parker. The movie isn't much by itself but is worth watching with the commentary ""on"" if you enjoy observing self-delusion. They seem to actually believe that they made a very clever movie and Mastroianni name drops anyone or anything that ever said a kind word about anything he was involved with; I kept waiting for a reference to his third grade teacher's praise of his watercolor painting ability. But otherwise they seem like nice guys. The film was shot on Staton Island for about half its original budget and the commentary gives an interesting account of the various economy measures that were used to squeeze this thing out.

Anyway this is a horror film from 1980; and like a lot of the stuff made at that time it shamelessly cheats rather than bother to create plausible scenarios for its plot elements. I've never been sure whether this type of cheating was due to lazy scriptwriting, budget issues, or because the producers of these things believed that audiences did not want to be scared ""too much"" and would welcome it when the suspense was destroyed by an absurd plot development. Certainly movies like ""Psycho"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"" are scarier because they go to some length to make the terror plausible. Even the first ""Jason"" and ""Halloween"" movies are scarier than their sequels for this same reason. But audiences paid to see this formula stuff throughout the 1980's so it must have been OK with fans of the genre at that time.

In one moronically contrived scene the killer stands beside Caitlin's parked car and slaps listlessly at the windshield, a few seconds later (while hanging onto the roof of the speeding car) he smashes in the windshield with his fist. The climax is filmed inside a complex of fuhrer-bunker-like tunnels (actually an abandoned sanitarium) but the night establishing shot is of just one tiny brick building; where this tunnel maze came from is never explained.

Anyway, the star of the film (and the only good reason to watch) is Caitlin O'Heaney (remember Snow White Charming). Although better suited to romantic comedy than to horror, O'Heaney is smart and beautiful and does fine in this role. Dana Barron (remember Audrey Griswald at Wally World) plays Caitlin's little sister, Tom Hanks has a minor role as a jogging college student, and Paul Gleason (Breakfast Club) has a minor role as a detective.

Perhaps the most puzzling element of this film is the ""tribute to Hitchcock"" shower scene. Not because the girl is never actually attacked in the shower but because instead of a nude Caitlin (something you would want to see) they show a nude Elizabeth Kemp (something that you wish you had not seen...""must purge the image of her slug-like body from memory"").

There are a few original elements in this film although most of them are teases; like setting the stage for a standard horror moment and then not pulling the trigger. It does have a clever twist at the end which you can guess if you have been paying attention but not until just a few seconds before it occurs.",1116806400,2,3122,4.795539033457249

396206,3,6301969448,"Every girl is frightened the night before her wedding, but this time...there's good reason!  That's the fairly tame tagline for He Knows You're Alone (1980) aka Blood Wedding, a fairly generic post Halloween (1978) slasher film that most notable probably because it was the first film Tom Hanks ever appeared in...

Directed by Armand Mastroianni, who went on to direct mainly episodes of television series like Friday the 13th: The Series and War of the Worlds: The Second invasion, the film stars Caitlan O'Heaney, whom I most remember from the early 80's TV show Tales of the Gold Monkey.  Also appearing are Don Scardino (Squirm), James Rebhorn (Meet the Parents, Independence Day), Paul Gleason (Trading Places, The Breakfast Club, Die Hard), and, of course, Tom Hanks in a minor bit parts encompassing all of about 5 minutes of screen time.

Okay, so here's the basic plot...Amy (O'Heaney) is about to be married.  Along with the usual problems, dress fittings, flower arrangements, etc., she's been noticing a mysterious figure everywhere she goes.  Turns out a killer is on the loose, and he seems to have a thing for brides to be...also, it seems the killer is somewhat known by the local police, as he's struck before, but had stopped for awhile, confounding the efforts of law enforcement to capture him...but now has returned and is up to his old ways again.  One detective in particular has a personal interest in seeing the serial killer stopped.  Anyway, Amy continues to be stalked, yet those around here think her sightings are due to nervousness of her impending nuptials, and don't take her seriously.  The killer not only stalks Amy, but begins finding victims in Amy's friends and those associated with the wedding in general (pity the poor tailor...).  Will Amy be able convince not only herself, but also her friends (the ones that are left) and the police of the existence of this mysterious killer before it's too late?  I hope so, because the reception hall isn't keen on returning the deposit...

The first thing I noticed in He Know You're Alone is how much the musical score apes that of Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells, used so effectively in The Exorcist.  Often lesser films, especially within the horror genre, borrow from better films, but this just seemed a little too blatant for my tastes.  The characters are a bit hollow and lifeless, lacking any real chemistry, and don't do enough to really endear themselves to the audience which is pretty important as ideally you should be concerned for their welfare thus increasing the tension when danger is near.  I never really connected with any of the characters, so I cared little if they found themselves victims of the killer.  Also, the motivation of the killer never seemed clear (well, at least until the end, and even then, it was pretty translucent).  The whole idea of him killing women soon to be wed fell apart, as we soon saw this wasn't really the case, as victims were pretty much random.  There was no mystery (other than his motivations) to the killer as we saw his face often, and he didn't really present a formidable or fearsome nature (he looked like he got a lot of sun on his face while wearing large sunglasses, giving the effect of a rather large raccoon).  Even his methods of killing were rather bland, more or less stabbing his victims with knives.  There was a decapitation (not shown), which resulted in a horribly pathetic fake looking head in an odd place (I won't say where, as that would give too much away).  Also, there is little to no blood anywhere throughout the film (maybe it wasn't in the budget).  I don't really see how you can have a slasher film with no blood, unless they decided to `buck the trend', and try and focus the audience's attention on the suspense rather than the gore.  Fans of the genre like their blood, and will probably be disappointed.  There were a few tense and suspenseful moments, but so much of what was going to happen seemed entirely obvious that I found myself often guessing (correctly) how various particular scenes were going to end.  Another thing, I found it quite annoying how easily the killer gained access to many places undetected, almost as if he were able to `will' himself inside.  There are a few original moments within the film, but even those are kind of spoiled in that often they are dragged before the audience too long, as if to say ""look at this"", effectively draining the subtlety and spoiling the intended effect.  As mentioned by another reviewer, correctly, in my opinion, this whole film seems to be a paper-thin copy of Halloween, without any of the elements that made that film so good and fun to watch.  As I said before, the ending seemed a bit transparent, but provides a nice wrap around, and the reward was just to little, too late.  Basically what you have here is a mediocre film borrowing a bit too much from a better film, packing little punch (and blood).  I kind of see this film as being a primer for someone who hasn't experienced many horror films, especially those within the slasher genre.  Kinda like training wheels on a bicycle...try it out, see if you like it, and then move on to more advanced material.  If you're already there, then you might find a passing interest, but don't expect too much.

The wide screen picture on this DVD looks excellent (to my surprise), and the audio comes through pretty clear.  Special features include a theatrical trailer, and a commentary track by the director Armand Mastroianni and screenwriter Scott Parker.  All in all, not a bad film, certainly serviceable, and retaining novelty value given it's Tom Hanks first screen appearance, but I would recommend Black Christmas (1974) for someone looking for a underrated and not often seen gem in the genre.

I think this movie has a lot in comman with Halloween, in a good way. First off, it has some great jolts in it, the first one of which I thought was really smart because if you had seen this movie in a theater as I did as a kid, you wouldn't have leaned back in your chair the whole movie. Also the use of a popular 70s campfire ghost story (highschool boys ring tapping on the window of the car) was a nice touch as well. The other thing it has in comman with Halloween is how straight up 70s the people in the film are and how you almost know them all at first introduction. You really get to know the people in the film (before they are stabbed to death :-) which is something the new films don't even try anymore. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think the killing scenes could have used a bit more gore. If you are a fan of the 70s give this one a shot. It'll take you back with a bit of a fright along the way.",1093305600,,1050,3.8433179723502304

7818720,1,6301969448,"A very incompetent slasher-type film -- derived from ""Halloween"". But, really makes no sense. Not sure why it's called He Knows You're Alone, since the killer is killing when people are there or not there. Just show a guy standing briefly outside on a lawn, then gone, and that's what passes for scare-tactics here. Terrible dialogue, terrible plot. But, Tom Hanks is in here in his first film role (briefly) -- so, that is something to see. He carries himself well, and I think he has the best and funniest lines in the film (when he is asked how far along he is in his psychology studies, since he seems to know so much. ""Intro""!

One really odd thing: There was absolutely no reason for this being in the film-- but, they had one topless nude scene, in a shower, to presumably bring up thoughts of Hitchcock's Psycho. They even show a drain with water running down it (but no blood). ""What the...? This is the type of random nonsense that you will see in this garbage. Gives slasher films a bad name.

Nothing at all to see here. (I saw on TCM, because it was paired with ""Don't Open the Door"", which IS worth seeing.)",1514764800,,1121,4.436893203883495
