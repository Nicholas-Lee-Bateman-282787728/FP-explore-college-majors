5375552,4,B00A2H9QYC,"Hollywood has had a long love affair with alcoholic stories and for good reason: dramatic, pathetic spectacle lurks around every corner. Just think of The Lost Weekend, Arthur, Leaving Las Vegas, and more recently Bad Santa. Smashed is unique in that it doesn't show a cringe-worthy stunning disaster, but rather how matter-of-factly alcoholism can eat away at otherwise completely normal lives.

Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Aaron Paul are solid and convincing as normal young people who seem to always drink just a little too much. If you saw them at your local dive bar one night a week, you would think nothing of it. They are young, they got married, they have jobs (I think), they like hanging out. The movie does a great job of showing how alcoholism always creeps into an addict's life without necessarily blowing it up. No one dies in this movie, gets beat up, or even gets into a car accident. But being late for work while pretending not to be hungover, begging the liquor store to sell you a bottle after last call, or waking up and wondering where the hell you are for a moment all come off as convincing realities for an alcoholic.

In terms of weak parts, I thought the Vice Principal Mr. Davies and Jenny characters could have been combined and made richer, as they are they are both too thinly drawn. Kate's subplot with her mom is also too quickly discarded. On the other hand, Megan Mullally's role as the school Principal is well done, and Winstead and Paul are superb and carry the soul of the film well. Winstead in particular is great in the last scenes where she portrays a person who has undergone a real change of heart in more ways than one.",1363046400,,1667,4.609427609427609
5375553,4,B00A2H9QYC,"Excellent, well written often humorous ""indie piece"" about a young woman who finds herself struggling with alcoholism.  The film serves as a reminder that since there are genetic predispositions to alcoholism/other additions, every generation will have those who will have to confront this affliction in their own lives.",1363046400,,320,5.666666666666667
5375554,4,B00A2H9QYC,"""I don't think I can do this anymore, I think I need to slow down and I might need help."" Kate (Winstead) is an elementary school teacher who loves her job. She is married to a man she loves. One day at school she throws up in class and the class asks if shes pregnant. What starts off as a little lie snowballs until she reveals the truth. Kate is an alcoholic. This is one of the best under the radar movies that I have seen in a long time. While not as intense as Flight was at showing the effects and struggles with addiction this is still a very well done and disturbing look at the problem. Winstead gives an amazing performance in this and deserves to be nominated or at the very least talked about. The movie is depressing and a little hard to watch but it really should be seen by a bigger audience then it will get. I know movies about addiction aren't at the top of everyone's list but this is a movie that I do recommend. Overall, a movie that is hard to watch in some parts but deserves to be seen by more people then will see it. I give it a high B+.",1362182400,3,1064,4.04739336492891

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

'Smashed' is one of those films that doesn't require much of a long-winded critique. It features a very solid performance by Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Kate Hannah, an elementary school teacher with a serious drinking problem. Perhaps the best scenes come at the beginning of the film: Kate vomits in front of her elementary school children and then attempts to hide the fact that she previously went on a bender by claiming that she's pregnant. Later, she drives drunk with a woman who she just met at a bar and subsequently shares crack with.

'Smashed' becomes rather perfunctory when it examines the deteriorating relationship between Kate and her also alcoholic husband, Charlie. When Kate finally decides that she wants to become sober, Charlie rather predictably clings to the bottle and Kate drifts away. But after Kate confesses to her principal that the story about being pregnant was a lie, she's promptly fired and she falls apart.

Time does heal all wounds and Kate finally accepts the precepts of AA and gets better. At this point, 'Smashed' feels more like a promo for Alcoholics Anonymous than a drama replete with the requisite twists and turns.

There are also a couple of underdeveloped sub-plots including the vice principal, Mr. Davies, a recovering alcoholic who convinces Kate to join AA in the first place but makes a sexual advance that leads to his rejection. Octavia Spencer also has little to do as Kate's sponsor.

'Smashed' is partially saved by Ms. Winstead's excellent performance but ultimately becomes too preachy in regards to its anti-alcohol message as well as too predictable in its dissection of the deteriorating relationship between the now recovering wife and booze-addicted husband, set in his alcoholic ways.",1360627200,9,1819,5.087248322147651
5375556,5,B00A2H9QYC,"""Smashed"" is an incredibly insightful movie about a young woman's courageous journey to personally change the legacy passed down to her by her family.  Mary Beth Winstead is brilliant in her portrayal of Kate.  There is no sugar coating on what lies ahead of her as she struggles with these changes.  The affect on relationships, lifestyles, and convictions is raw and true.  It will likely be moving and familiar to anyone trying to make personnel changes for the better, whether with substance abuse or any other major life change.  This is an important piece of work with the potential for far reaching application and impact. Don't miss it.",1354924800,14,644,4.925925925925926
5375557,4,B00A2H9QYC,"""Smashed"" (2012 release; 85 min.) brings the story of a married couple, Charlie (played by Aaron Paul) and Kate (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who enjoy going out and partying it up. Then several incidents happen to Kate (blacking out in the middle of nowhere; throwing up in front of her elementary school students due to a hangover), which really make her rethink the direction of her life. Without so much as consulting with Charlie, she decides almost on a whim to join AA (at the suggestion of a co-worker who has been there before), while Charlie does not. At that point we are just 30 min. into the movie (hence my suggested alternative title for the movie, ""Sober"") and the rest of the movie plays out the strains and challenges which Kate faces with her co-workers at school, Charlie at home, and even her mom to whom she's not particularly close. I'm not going to tell you how it all plays out, as that would just ruin your viewing experience.

Couple of thoughts: Mary Elizabeth Winstead carries the film on her shoulders, and she does a terrific job at that, although certainly Aaron Paul (he of ""Breaking Bad"") does a credible job too. There are a couple of pivotal scenes in the second half of the movie between these two as their relationship seems to fall off a cliff after Kate joins AA, and where you can really see how Winstead just throws herself into this role. There is also a small choice role for Octavia Spencer as Jenny, Kate's sponsor at AA. Also worth mentioning is the lovely soundtrack for the movie, with a bunch of obvious and not-so-obvious indie music from the likes of Cass McCombs, Richard & Linda Thompson and, best of all, the song ""Our Anniversary"" by Bill Callahan (a/k/a Smog).

This movie clearly was made on a shoestring budget, but it doesn't matter. The is one of those ""little movies that could"", bringing some great performances while examining the fall-out on relationships resulting from being smashed/sober. This is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare. If you are in the mood for a quality indie movie, I am quite certain that you will enjoy ""Smashed"".",1353024000,47,2117,4.703504043126685
5375588,4,B00A2H9QYC,It had the look of a low budget indie movie but Mary Winstead's performance was first class.,1501372800,,92,4.470588235294118
5375589,4,B00A2H9QYC,"Alcoholism is a hideous, life altering, and sometimes deadly disease.  This movie showed how it can sneak up on you and wreck your life before  you even realize what's going on.  I had just finished watching the 3rd season of Fargo on TV.  An actress named Mary Elizabeth Winstead was in it and I wanted to see what other movies/shows she had done and this movie came up.  She and Aaron Paul were excellent in this movie.",1499990400,,421,4.415584415584416

5375591,4,B00A2H9QYC,"The premise actually seems a bit generic and played out (a drunk person that struggles toward sobriety), but wow it's still incredibly compelling. Mary Elizabeth Winstead knocks it out of the park. Aaron Paul is also outstanding. It's a very naturalistic script and it's got a delicate comedy to it. Never veers into the rimshot-timing of a sitcom. The director, James Ponsoldt, shows great sensitivity in capturing these people's lives. What I think it most truthfully conveys is the price you pay for sobriety. There is a deficit in happiness, you have to give up people you care about, you have to turn your life upside down. It's hard to stick the landing in movies but Smashed, I think, accomplishes that. Paul poses a question to Winstead, nothing momentous or operatic, just: ""Would you like to play another game?"" The pause before Winstead's answer illuminates the most tragic thing about addiction: the ever-looming possibility of relapse. Falling back into the cycle just when you thought you've gotten out. We know that giving even that small amount of ground foreswears a ruinous relapse. All giant swings of fortune are often put into motion by the tiniest concessions.",1497916800,2,1182,5.035714285714286

5375594,2,B00A2H9QYC,Just very sorry I followed all the reviews and went ahead and purchased it. If only I had not seen the review. The movie is just stupid.,1494028800,,136,4.074074074074074
5375595,4,B00A2H9QYC,"I watched this movie because I'm a fan of Aaron Paul, from ""Breaking Bad"", and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, from ""10 Cloverfield Lane"".  When I saw that they had made a movie together, I was curious to see it.  They're both great actors, and I wanted to see them work together.

I can understand why some would say that they don't like this movie.  It's not because it's a bad movie (It isn't a bad movie), it's because some people just don't like dramas.  So they watch the movie, and aren't impressed because they don't like dramas.  I get that.  What I don't understand is how someone could say that this movie has terrible performances.  One review stated that, and I simply can't understand it.  This is because the performances are very real -- especially Mary Elizabeth Winstead's.  No fake tears, just extremely authentic acting.  She does such a great job that you almost feel as if she really has her character's struggles.  So I'm thoroughly impressed with the performances.  When someone states that the acting is bad, I can only conclude that they must be a troll.  If these performances are bad, then what's good?  How could these performances have been improved?

As for the story; it's about what you may expect.  It's a drama that tackles a very real subject.  If you're into that sort of thing, then I don't see why you wouldn't like this movie.

As for me, I was entertained enough just to see Aaron Paul and Mary Elizabeth Winstead work together.  It's not a movie I would choose to own (I borrowed it from my local library, and I'm more into serious sci-fi), but it was certainly worth my time for the performances alone.",1493942400,,1638,4.602076124567474

This particular type of addiction portrayed has a lot to do with balancing the main character's functionality in every day life over a long period of time, so that when it starts to break down the homeostasis is so powerful that she has a hard time changing. I don't want to spoil the ending, but suffice it to say the movie doesn't pull any punches.",1460332800,,518,4.580645161290323

5375688,5,B00A2H9QYC,"Bottom Line:  This is a GREAT MOVIE.  I had been to the Movie Theatre & saw the new movie ""10 Cloverfield Lane,"" and I fell in love with Mary Elizabeth Winstead as an actress... Yes ill admit I have a BIG CRUSH on her (LOL).  So, I Googled other movies she is in, and 'SMASHED' came up.  I went to Amazon and rented it ASAP, and Ill rent other movies she is in since i say she is a ""GREAT ACTRESS and very EZ on the EYES!!""  It is a great movie with great actors / actresses... Aaron Paul for Breaking Bad (enough said!!), and Nick Offerman -- the guy from Parks and Rec,, and Meagan Mullally, also a great actress!  Yes, its got it all -- great actors, great plot, heart breaking plot line, real life stories and scenarios, and more.  While it does have an ""Alfred Hitchcock"" type endng (for you young folks that's an ending named after the great film maker who always left you hanging at the end!!)  In other words, you don't know if they are going to get back together or stay separated.  Maybe they set it ip for SMASHED 2 ?!?  I sure hope so, as I would watch it on the first day out.  It talks about a topic that affects many people (Alcoholism) and a group (A.A.) that helps many of them.  This movie shows how our problems and challenges afect others and changes everything we deal with each day... work, life, family, spouse, etc. Watch this movie ASAP... you will NOT be disappointed.
 (P.S. Back to Mary. E. Winstead... I'll also watch every other movie this great looking and great acting lady is in, too.)",1458691200,,1518,4.28421052631579

Kate and her equally alcoholic husband Charlie (Aaron Paul) seemingly are having a good time, most of which is found in bars with Charlie's friends.

One morning Kate is so hung over she upchucks in front of her class and with prompts from the kiddies says she's pregnant and that's what pregnant women do.  Obviously this ruse can only last so long.  Winstead is excellent as Kate makes the change from falling down drunk to straight arrow thanks to support from AA and sponsors played by Oscar winner Octavia Spencer and a socially awkward teaching associate played by Nick Offerman.  Offerman's real life spouse Megan Mullally plays Kate's principal.

The problem here isn't the acting.  But this is a one-note story depicting a struggle by a married couple dealing with alcoholism.  It's been done many times in the past, perhaps best by 1962's ""Days of Wine and Roses.""

Smashed is not a feel-good movie. Instead, it tackles a very difficult subject, alcoholism, and does so with brutal honesty. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is believable as the party girl, the first-grade teacher trying to hide her addiction, the fun-loving wife, and the daughter who has a difficult relationship with her mother. She's also believable as as alcoholic trying to get her ""boring"" life in order, who has to make difficult decisions that are right for her. Her performance was excellent!  The supporting cast was also awesome, including Aaron Paul (from Breaking Bad) as her alcoholic husband.

We've all had a friend who drank too much, did something embarrassing, was the life of the party, or ended up in jail. Smashed doesn't hold back but shows the truth, and it does it with simplicity and without a long, drawn-out plot.

The move was only 81 minutes long, and some may prefer to watch movies in the more traditional 1:45-2:15 time frame. I appreciated the fact that Smashed told its story and said what it needed to say in a short amount of time. I'd rather a movie do that than add unnecessary filler to a movie.

(It's similar to the oft-done hostage episode television dramas are so fond of; act 1, the set-up; act two, the taking, act 3, the fear, act four, the anger.)

The film is good enough, but there's just nothing new here, so much so that the friendly AA co-worker has become almost a caricature, which certainly can't help the film. And these AA meetings and sharings in American films -- they all look like the same AA meeting. A lot of reviews have lauded Octavio Spencer's performance, as the recovering alcoholic. But it is totally by the numbers; I don't think there's anything honest in the performance.

Winstead plays a first grade teacher who eventually realizes she needs to stop drinking after a number of incidents, one which includes throwing up in front of the whole class after a night of drinking.  Although she goes to AA for help, her husband played by Aaron Paul does not.  Their marriage can't handle such a drastic change in personal dynamics and they separate.

5375816,5,B00A2H9QYC,"Kate and Charlie are happily married; well they laugh a lot but that might be due to their excessive alcohol intake. She is a school teacher of young kids and he is a journalist who writes from home. She sometimes needs a `hair of the dog' to get going in the morning, and as any of us who have been there will know' that can cause a bit or a reflux now and then. Well she manages to chunder in the class room and miss the bin - oops.

After managing to lie her way out of the whole episode,  the vice principal lets on that he knows she is an alcoholic as indeed is he and invites her to do a twelve step programme. Well after a night where her antics take her to a very dangerous place albeit in a very funny way, she realises that she has to do something. The problem is that once she sobers up she takes a look at her life with Charlie and finds it wanting. Having personally lived around people `who like a drink', when I heard the phrase `I'm sorry I was drunk' being used as a catch all excuse, it really stopped me in my tracks, I think even I have used that on occasion and it is painful to realise how worthless that excuse is.

This is billed as a comedy/drama, and yes it is funny, but it is tragic-comedy and a lot of it is laughing at how pathetic a drunk is and how desperate they can become. Kate is played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead (`Scott Pilgrim vs. the World') and she is completely brilliant and manages to do the drunk bits as both funny and sad. Her husband Charlie is Aaron Paul best known for the TV series `Breaking Bad' as Jesse Pinkman, he is also convincing and compelling in how he tries to change and the interplay between them is excellent. Megan Mullally (Karen from `Will and Grace') plays the Principal and does so straight faced which is just great as a supporting role. The whole thing is well made, brilliantly acted and tackles alcoholism in an honest way and the humour is incidental not the raison d'tre, which is just how it is in real life. I know a few alcoholics and the humour gets them through - up to a point, I intend to lend this to a couple of them as it captures real life so well.

5375844,4,B00A2H9QYC,"Films dealing with alcoholics are rarely anything less than depressing, with the rare instance of a film like the original ARTHUR (which is a hilarious and heartfelt joy to watch). Going back to THE LOST WEEKEND or DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES to more recent films like Paul Schrader's LIGHT SLEEPER, or really any film dealing with addiction made in the last 20-odd years, alcoholism and addiction are not really to be made light of anymore. It's understandable, and there are always good reasons for film and television dealing with alcoholism and addiction with the appropriate amount of gravitas. James Ponsolt's SMASHED makes a something of a case that a film about alcoholism can have dramatic weight, but can also look at it with a bit of humor in its heart, and that's thanks to a revelatory performance by Mary Elizabeth Winstead and a terrific, if perhaps underused, supporting cast.

Winstead plays Kate, a grammar school teacher who, along with her occasionally-employed rock critic husband Charlie (BREAKING BAD's Aaron Paul), have an abiding love of good times and lots of drinks. When Kate finds herself hitting bottom relatively hard (she pukes in front of her class due to her hangover, and lies about being pregnant to them and to the school's principal played by Megan Mullaly), she decides that it's time to get sober. Through the help of the school's vice-principal (Nick Offerman) who recognizes her as a drunk, he gets her into AA. But Charlie isn't terribly supportive of this, and continues to drink. Kate's mom (Mary Kay Place), a long-time functioning alcoholic, also feels that trying to get sober is a fool's errand. Through AA, Kate also meets a friendly and sassy sponsor in Jenny (Octavia Spencer), who she confides in and helps her through the rough times, at least until her personal and work life hit rock-bottom.

While the film ends on a note of quiet triumpth, it feels like a good chunk of the film was just excised to get to the meat of the storytelling and really concentrating on Winstead's amazing performance. I've been kind of in love with her since seeing her in flawed films like LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD and DEATH-PROOF, but seeing her as Ramona Flowers in the brilliant SCOTT PILGRIM VS THE WORLD kind of sealed the deal of wanting to see a lot more of her, and this performance is just tremendous. It's not particularly showy in a way that garners awards, but instead, she vanishes into her role physically, down-playing her natural beauty and seeming more plain-jane than we've seen her before, as well as emotionally. Her demeanor flips between highs and lows (including a particularly suspenseful but hilarous moment after she's just smoked crack for the first and only time), and they're all played extremely convincingly. Paul is quite good here, but his character isn't much of a variation on Jesse Pinkman to say that it's a stretch. Mullaly and Offerman, natural comedians, are also a bit of a revelation here as they reach out of their comfort zone. As for the rest of the cast, sadly Spencer and Place are in roles that barely amount to more than cameos, which was pretty disappointing.

The script and direction by feature-length newcomer Ponsolt (and co-writer Susan Burke) is very naturalistic and never seems over-wrought. And again, there are moments of genuine humor here, particularly between Winstead and Offerman, who share one of the most uncomfortably funny scenes in recent memory. One of the nice things also about the way that Kate is written is that there's never a scene where she's pushing Charlie to join her in sobriety; she lets their relationship play out and see where he lands. Unfortunately, the film does seem to short some of the characters in its perhaps too brisk 85 minute run-time. It could have done well with either excising some of the characters or giving the supporting cast some more depth.

Once it's all said and done, though, this is really Winstead's show, and it's a marvelous, career-changing performance, and if for no other reason, SMASHED should be seen for Winstead.

4 out of 5 stars.",1367107200,6,4082,4.867625899280576
5375845,3,B00A2H9QYC,"At year's start I heard a lot of buzz surrounding a performance given by Mary Elizabeth Winstead in a small film called `Smashed'.  She was supposed to be the big breakout of the year and Oscar buzz was already mounting before many people even saw her film.  In fact, I was predicting her for the Oscar nomination, and the clips that were circulating the internet looked to make good on that promise.  She wasn't anywhere near an Oscar nom, to be honest, but her performance is stellar to say the least.  Her biggest obstacle is the film itself, which just isn't thought out enough to give her raw performance room to fully breathe, but she sinks her teeth in and never stops thrashing; and for that I praise her.

The film tells the story of Kate, a young teacher who also happens to be an alcoholic.  Her husband came from money and is pretty much a lazy band chaser who spends his days surfing the internet and playing video games and his nights getting completely trashed.  Kate follows suit in the evenings, downing beer and hard liquor like they were water and suffering the consequences (waking up in urine, shop lifting, smoking crack with a homeless chick).  Finally, after throwing up in front of her students and faking a pregnancy to avoid being caught hungover she realizes that she needs to change, so she accepts an offer from a co-worker to attend AA meetings and, with no help from her husband, she starts to clean up her act.

Mary Elizabeth Winstead is sensational here.  She handles the dramatic and the comedic angles of this tonally uneven film really well, and her drunken outburst come from such an honest place.  You feel her pain and her regret and you swell inside for her resolve and her progress.  The film doesn't quite know how to handle this performance though.  It never really gives Winstead a proper foundation and so her performances sits as a solitary moment of clarity in a film that is unfinished.  You never get a real sense of why she's getting sober, how she manages to get sober and where she's planning on going with her life.  It feels like a string of snippets of Kate's life but there are no true connective pieces.

Still, Winstead anchors the film the best she can, and Nick Offerman and Aaron Paul are great supporting players (opposite ends of her support group), while Octavia Spencer perfects her crazy eye routine (she scares me) and Megan Mullally thinks she's in a different movie (what an awful performance).

All in all this is worth seeing for Winstead alone, but don't expect to get much out of this.",1365465600,2,2560,4.6158940397351

Winstead plays an elementary school teacher who binges on booze with husband Aaron Paul. After a series of mishaps (vomiting in class, waking up hungover with no idea where her car is), Winstead decides to become sober, but not until she lies to her boss (Megan Mullally) with the excuse that she's pregnant after throwing up in front of her students. Unfortunately, sobriety comes at a price eventually, not only at work but with her relationship with her usually hung-over significant other.

""Smashed"" is all over the place thematically - a few portions come across like outtakes from ""Bad Teacher,"" while other sequences have the feel of an improvised indie drama. Alas, with such a brief running time, almost nothing in the film is satisfactorily developed. Winstead's journey to becoming sober comes so easily that it feels more like a plot device than a fully explored theme, and her relationship with Paul is likewise hackneyed and predictable. The filmmakers also never give us a sense of why these two people were ever together to begin with - hampering the film's effectiveness - which leaves Winstead single-handedly to carry viewers along on an emotional rollercoaster that's never fully fleshed out. Thankfully, she's up to the challenge, bringing nuances and an emotional range that makes you care about her character's plight, even if the movie on balance fails to support her talents.

Sony's Blu-Ray includes a number of deleted scenes (some of which might've helped the film's final third), commentary with Ponsoldt and Winstead, a Making Of, Toronto Film Festival Q&A/red carpet featurette, 1080p AVC encoded transfer and DTS MA 5.1 audio.",1365033600,6,1811,5.195205479452055

JUDGMENT CALL:

In today's society, it's well-known that alcoholics and addicts face major challenges in their first steps of recovery.

And while there have been film and television shows on the subject of alcoholism, ""Smashed"" is a fascinating film of one's journey through being sober and how sobriety is not easy.  But it's a crucial step in order for one to take back their life, or else they will end up hurting or getting themselves killed.

Mary Elizabeth Winstead does a magnificent job of playing the recovering alcoholic, Kate.  Sometimes one has to fall down so low to realize that their addition is getting the best of them and in this case, the character of Kate constantly wets her bed, she is unfit to work as a teacher for young children and lies about her alcoholism that her sickness is due to pregnancy and it's so bad that when she's drunk, she's out of hand.  Drunk driving, experimenting with drugs, peeing in a store and just not conscious about how bad alcohol has consumed her.

But one thing that the film shows is how loved ones can be enablers to alcoholism.  Kate's mother is an alcoholic, her husband likes drinking and encourages her to drink because she would be a more ""fun"" person to be with.

And no matter if you have AA and close friends with you to help  you with your recovery, it's also important to eliminate things that will cause you to fall  hard again.

It's easy for one to say stay away from those who enable you to do these things, but for the character of Kate and  her husband Charlie, these two are in love and enjoy each other.  But if one is unwilling to be sober or enables it and the other really wants to badly be sober, there is really one way that person can go.

Both Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Aaron Paul have great chemistry of playing a happy young married couple but also seeing how this marriage starts to tear itself apart.  But also making the character of Kate thinking if her marriage is actually based on love or the convenience of getting smashed and not growing up.

Octavia Spencer does a great job in a supportive role (which she was cast for the film prior to her being cast on ""The Help"") as Jenny, who tries to listen and give advice to Kate.  Megan Mullally plays a more serious role in ""Smashed"" than the comedic roles that she is best known for, so it was good to see her playing a different type of role.  And Nick Offerman as Kate's friend and co-worker who has a crush on her and says the creepiest things.

As mentioned earlier, the Blu-ray release is available for ""Smashed"", so if one wants the best picture quality, the Blu-ray is the way to go.  But the DVD release of ""Smashed"" is still good and I detected no major problems with picture quality or audio and there are a good number of special features included.

Overall, ""Smashed"" benefits from its wonderful performance by Mary Elizabeth Winstead but also for its gutsy ending.  There are too many people who choose not to solve their problems and are too comfortable with the way things were despite how much pain or trouble they get into.  May it be domestic abuse, gang affiliation, drug addiction and alcohol abuse, ""Smashed"" is a film that shows us that staying sober is not easy and it also means making tough choices for one's survival.

A film worth watching!",1364601600,,5305,4.838888888888889

Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Aaron Paul excellent as the lead characters. As someone who has experienced the
subject matter within the family I was really sympathetic with Ms Winsteads character. This young lady gets better
with each movie she makes. How some reviewers give this movie one and two stars is beyond me. I suggest they

5375874,3,B00A2H9QYC,"Although this is a very good drama, it is not a happy movie. There is little happiness associated with alcoholism but there is great happiness in finally overcoming it. Mary Elizabeth Winstead turns in a stellar performance as an alcoholic grammar school teacher and Aaron Paul is very believable as her ""enabler"" husband. The casting is perfect with excellent performances by the entire cast including Mary Kay Place as Winstead's ""enabling"" mother, Octavia Spencer as her Sponsor, Megan Mullaly as her prim and proper boss and Nick Offerman as her wannabe boyfriend who delivers an unforgettable line that will make a lot of people cringe. A depressing subject but very well done. It provides a great example of the losses suffered and the strength necessary to ultimately overcome alcoholism.",1363651200,,795,5.170542635658915

5375876,4,B00A2H9QYC,"I heard about Smashed when it came out in 2012, and tried to find in in local theaters without luck. The reviews I'd read prepared me for what I found: the story was somewhat predictable, but the acting was excellent -- and the specifics of Kate's decline felt realistic and painful. Thought the scene in the store where she tried to convince the clerk to sell her alcohol after hours was very well done and so uncomfortable/sad. I think people will bring their own experience to how they view this film -- at least I did. Many people are touched in some way alcohol abuse/dependence, and it's helpful to see attempts to tell stories about this subject on film.",1363305600,3,661,4.563025210084033
5375877,4,B00A2H9QYC,"""I don't know if I'm an alcoholic, really,"" Kate Hannah says at her first Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, ""I just drink. I drink a lot. And I've always drank a lot, everyone I know drinks a lot, so I never really thought it was a problem. But lately it kinda seems like it is."" This is the crux of James Ponsoldt's acute, concise, heartfelt film, co-written with Susan Burke, herself a recovering alcoholic. Smashed understands that alcoholism isn't always the sad, somber burden that the movies tend to portray it as; oftentimes it's actually a lot of fun, and it's only when the physical and psychological toll of a night's bacchanalian revelry becomes too great to shoulder in the morning -- when the drink and its repercussions can no longer be measured independent of one another -- that the alcoholic is compelled to admit his or her problem.

Kate (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is an elementary school teacher, dedicated and passionate about her job, who nonetheless spends more than just Friday night carousing about the local bars with her husband Charlie (Aaron Paul) and their friends. She is what you might call a functioning alcoholic; she gets to work on time every day, but not without finishing last night's beer in the shower and taking a swig of whiskey from the flask she keeps in her car before heading in to the classroom. Kate is able to get by like this just fine, until one day the hair of the dog proves a little too much and she suddenly, uncontrollably vomits in the middle of class. Embarrassed and stunned, Kate impulsively says ""Yes"" when her young students ask if she's pregnant, relieved that she doesn't have to explain what a hangover is. Afraid to admit that she's been drinking, Kate plays along when Principal Barnes (Megan Mullally) congratulates her on her pregnancy and sends her home early to rest.

In celebration of her impromptu early dismissal, Kate heads out to the bar for drinks and karaoke with Charlie and his friends. Perhaps feeling remorse for her unprofessional episode at work earlier, she doesn't stay long, insisting that she has work to do and should head home. Outside, however, she is stopped by a girl (Mackenzie Davis) who talks Kate into giving her a ride home. ""Home"" turns out to be nothing more than a fire and some boxes in the seedy part of town, and on the drive there she convinces the tipsy Kate to take a hit from her crack pipe. When Kate wakes up the next morning on the ground, miles away from her car and with no recollection of how she got there, she decides that it may be time to grow up and slow down.

Charlie keeps pace with Kate, but unlike Kate, he doesn't wet the bed, start drinking first thing in the morning, or end up on the other end of town doing drugs with homeless strangers; so when Kate tells him that she thinks she needs to stop drinking (which she does with a pool cue in one hand and a beer in the other), Charlie doesn't understand why she can't keep drinking and simply stop everything else. ""The drinking is what leads to everything stupid that I do,"" she insists, but for Charlie, who has suffered fewer consequences for his choices than Kate has, it doesn't compute. Charlie seems to think that as long as they drink at home, where there aren't any intruding wayward souls to tempt Kate into transgressing, then she will be in the clear. But when he passes out before she's ready to call it a night, Kate rides her bike to the local store for more booze. When the clerk refuses to break the rules and sell her alcohol after 2am, Kate becomes petulant. First she loses control of her temper, then she loses control of her bladder, urinating on the floor when she is unable to make it to the bathroom in time. The clerk is incensed; when Kate steals a bottle of wine on her way out, he doesn't go after her, he's simply relieved to have her out of the store.

Blacking out and waking up on the side of the road twice in one weekend is apparently the limit for Kate, so when she returns to work the next week and Dave (Nick Offerman), the assistant principal, confides that he's nine years sober, she takes heed. Dave -- who saw Kate drinking in the parking lot the morning she threw up in class -- offers to bring her to a meeting. There, Kate meets Jenny (Octavia Spencer), an older woman whose honesty and candor appeals to Kate. ""All that dumb s*** happened,"" Jenny assures her, ""so now I'm glad it's at least entertaining."" Jenny becomes Kate's sponsor, giving her life advice and perspective.

For Kate, the biggest asset is having someone who understands that she does have a problem that needs to be addressed and handled. Charlie wants to be supportive; he loves Kate but he doesn't understand why she needs AA. Her estranged mother Rochelle (Mary Kay Place) is no help either; dismissive of her accomplishments and skeptical of her sobriety, Rochelle seems fundamentally unable to be happy for Kate and the new path she is is carving for herself with AA, an organization that Rochelle blames for brainwashing Kate's father and convincing him to abandon their family.

It's to the film's credit, however, that there is no villain, no diabolical enabler that is tempting Kate to fail. Instead, Ponsoldt and Burke are compassionate to all their characters, portraying Kate's friends and family as well meaning but misguided. Rochelle loves her daughter, but remains so bitter about her husband's need to leave a toxic relationship that she can't help but see Kate's pride for her success in AA as a slap in the face. Charlie meanwhile continues to drink; he has no malice toward Kate or her decision, he is just unable or unwilling to accept how his actions may affect Kate's. Charlie works from home and comes from a family that is willing and able to support him emotionally and financially; he has not fought for his career, for his house, for his comfort the way that Kate has, and he has no frame of reference to understand how tenuous Kate's self control truly is. Frustrated that he has lost his best drinking buddy, he lashes out at Kate, calling her ""a brainwashed bitch,"" and taking out his insecurities over their lost intimacy on her in the most counterproductive fashion. As sympathetic as he tries to be, Charlie is resentful that he is being excluded from Kate's life, not realizing that he must change with Kate in order to remain with her. ""Love is the easy part,"" Kate tells him, ""it's the rest of this s*** that's hard.""

As Kate, Winstead is fantastic; she plays drunk without any affectation or buffoonery, and her conviction and fortitude are never overplayed. She is neither a hero nor a victim; instead, she is a very smart, very real person who has reached the point at which she can no longer shirk responsibility for her actions. Sober for the first time since she was in high school, Kate must go through the arduous task of rediscovering herself, and Winstead nails the mix of surprise and humility, of acceptance and of resolve that comes from honestly assessing your faults and shamelessly taking the steps to improve them. ""Now that I'm not drinking,"" she explains, ""I have all these other problems I have to deal with.""

Ultimately, Smashed isn't about alcoholism as much as it is about pinpointing your preferred iteration of yourself and finding the necessary support to help manifest it. Rather than make a facile ode to AA, Ponsoldt and Burke -- with the help of a strong ensemble cast -- have instead explored the nature of support and altruism, as well as their evil twins projection and denial. Kate's family tries to help her by assuring her she doesn't have a problem, but she's smart enough to know better; it's only once she admits her failings and aligns herself with people who care enough to hold her accountable that she is able to make positive change. Jenny assures Kate, ""We all carry s*** in our heads that doesn't make any sense,"" lies and vices that we continue to indulge against our better judgment, but ""at least alcoholics have the tools to work through it."" The choices Kate must make are difficult, for both her and the people she loves, but she's been down far enough to know the value of looking up.
