8612630,1,B0001V00L2,"This review is NOT for the movie, but for the preposterous, boneheaded idea of EZ-D. It is up to us, the consumer, to make sure this illogical scam fails miserably! Why would you pay nearly seven dollars for a DVD that you can only watch within 48 hours after opening, when you can buy a new release-that will play forever with proper care- for about double the bones (sometimes less, if you look).
  This is Disney's ill-conceived attempt to muscle out the rental market. Again I present the argument of price. It only cost me a couple of bucks to rent a new release. And some video stores have recent and old releases (but not new) for a buck for 7 days. If more rental stores across the nation would offer this, the EZ-D format would die the quick death it deserves. Do NOT buy anything in this format!! I've  always suspected the evil undertone of Disney, and my suspicions have been confirmed. Hit `em in the pocketbook, people!! You can fool some of the people some of the time, oh MegaEvilCorporation, but you haven't fooled me!",1073779200,4,1035,4.524064171122995
