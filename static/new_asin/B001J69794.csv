8312002,1,B001J69794,"I just finished watching this film and am very disappointed. The title is misleading. If you're looking for information about Black Greek Letter Organizations, please go find another film.  If you're looking for a history of the Masonic organizations, you've got a product. The film is organizationally weak. If offers very little about the BGLO in terms of their foundation in North America. During the ""celebrity"" interviews (why they were shot in black and white is beyond me) the sound is sometimes muffled. There is no compelling story line and the film tends to drone on and on between short clips of frats stepping and long passages about the history. Are the history parts important? Yes. Do I need to hear them, if I bought a film about Black Greek Letter Organizations? No.

The Divine Nine?  Why they were formed? Where?  Who were the founders?  What type of work have they done in the community? What is the impact they have had in the black community?  Why do they step? Show celebrity interviews here. Cut back to the history of the organizations until the present. Talk about the impact that BGLO have on the college experience, talk about retention and graduation rates, talk about the network of the brotherhood and sisterhood.

Leave the history lesson for the history teachers.
Or rename the movie.",1309824000,3,1317,4.878923766816143

8312004,5,B001J69794,"As a graduate of an HBCU, Howard University to be exact this film gave me exactly what I needed. I learned so much about the origin of Greek organizations; it showed the parallel between masons and fraternities/sororities. Not only was this film informative but it was really entertaining. This film is not only a must see for those that are intrigued/interested in the Black Greek Organizations,it is a must see for everyone!!!",1297900800,,428,4.958333333333333
8312005,5,B001J69794,"This DVD is a great educational tool for all fraternities, sororities, masons, and eastern stars. The celebrity interviews are a great addition and the actual footage of stepshows and probate shows gave it an added element of entertainment. It is VERY nice to see celebrity organization members display their affiliation to their organization on film! The entire DVD shows fraternities and sororities in a positive light and further helps showcase the positive influence these organizations have had on many successful individuals. Anyone interested in joing a college african-american fraternity or sorority MUST see this DVD! I recommend for everyone!

I eagerly look forward to Part 2 of the series scheduled to come out.",1297900800,,724,5.407079646017699
8312006,3,B001J69794,"I believe that this particular dvd did cover alot of information, but it left a couple of things. It did not mention all the BGLO'S (Black Greek Letter Organizations). About 30 minutes of the begining was showing just probates and foullay(kappas twirling their sticks as well as sigmas)I lost interest in the dvd after about an hour.",1293321600,,333,4.859649122807017
