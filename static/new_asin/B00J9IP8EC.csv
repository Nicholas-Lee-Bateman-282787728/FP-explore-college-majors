I could not even finish the first episode before the whole series went into that box of losers that will have to be given to a desparate charity,if one that desparate can be found.
Just plain stupid.",1405987200,2,477,4.558139534883721
8649069,5,B00J9IP8EC,"There is a severe problem going on in Japan, the hikikomori people. These people totally isolate themselves from the rest of the world due to bullying. Even though anime is Japanese it has just begun covering the topic and its doing a plain bad job, starting from the fact that most hikikomori are male. But todays anime is obsessed with girls, thus most of the hikikomori characters are girls and they don't nearly suffer as much as the real ones. Sasami-san Ganbaranai is one of these cases. For good cover on hikikomori read Shutting Out the Sun by Michael Zielenzinger, a must-read for anyone interested in Japan.

Despite Sasami-san fails to portray the hikimori hell it still manages to be a pretty good anime, it has pretty hilarious times, good character development and it introduces us to the Japanese mythology, starting with the Sun Goddess Amaterasu, the first hikikomori (also mentioned by MZ), a pretty liberal introduction by the way. Its also interesting the way the plot evolves: it changes abruptly occasionally and like in life everything is turned upside down, the best intentions beget evil, the plot gets complex (or nonsensical like when destroying the sanctuary) and the central characters focus on feelings and relations rather than logic and sense when debating, so much Eastern style.

The central character, Sasami is not very related to hikimori but she does stick to Ganbaranai which basically means lazy, which lead us to another big feature of Japanese culture: making a big effort of life in general. Some authors make a fuss about the expression ganbate claiming it has no good translation into English, yes it does: its just make an effort!. The issue is that we are a nation that only wants to know about easy and safe fun and excitement and in anime series they usually translate ganbate as good luck which is right because the audience doesnt have an obligation to know anything and explanations in the middle of a show are annoying. Its best for us to hear what we normally hear, unless the audience is particularly interested in Japan or anything else. This series may be for such an audience and its a mistake for this web site to relate it to very low-brow shows such as To-Love-Ru.",1402617600,3,2225,4.837270341207349
