8061666,5,B0009J2G5Y,"There's a bunch of things that feel morally wrong about Night Warning.  For one thing the story focuses *way* too much on hating those who prefer the same sex.  I mean after a certain point this part of the story becomes the center of attention.  Also the behavior of the aunt (Susan Tyrrell) is a little too seductive towards her nephew (played by Jimmy McNichol).  It's quite confusing at first since the story begins showing a horrific car accident involving Jimmy's parents, and it's assumed Susan's character is a sister looking after her brother.  But... when the story jumps 14 years later, we see Susan walk into Jimmy's bedroom and try to wake him up by touching his back in a...  weird gentle way.  Certainly a sister wouldn't act that way!  A mother wouldn't either.  We then learn Susan's his aunt, and that she took him in after the death of his parents.

But the creepiness doesn't end there.  Without spoiling too much, Susan flat out despises the idea that Jimmy might be awarded a scholarship and leave home, leaving Susan alone with her warped unusual behavior/memories and picture talking ways.  Yup, she talks to pictures of her husband in the basement.  Susan often comes across more like an obsessed girlfriend whenever she gets into arguments with Jimmy's character, and even when he leaves for school.  She insists he doesn't need school and should just stay home with her.  Susan even hands him spiked milk before a big basketball tournament on one occasion, when she realizes his time at home is coming to an end.  All in an attempt to try and keep Jimmy home forever.  I won't say how the basketball game went but... let's just say, he missed a couple shots!

Of course, you-know-what hits the fan when Jimmy brings his girlfriend home and Susan catches them making love in his bedroom.  Oh boy, suddenly the TRUE side of Susan's nastiness is revealed!  Without spoiling the ending, let's just say Susan's weird obsessive ways turns WAY more violent later on.  She basically turns into a lunatic.  This involves stabbings and shootings around the home front.  Probably not a good day to drop by and visit, huh Marcia Lewis!  Marcia Lewis is a neighborly friend who pretends to leave, but actually sticks around after overhearing one particular unusual conversation between Susan and Jimmy in the new attic bedroom Susan made for Jimmy.  Marcia sensed something weird is going on.

I'd say the suspense overall is really high.  We know something is going to happen with Susan's character eventually, though perhaps Susan goes a little *too* ballistic when that time comes, but she does a tremendous job with her character.  In fact all the acting is terrific, even the absolute JERK (the detective played by Bo Svenson).  His presence becomes a permanent mark when Susan goes ballistic, kills the TV repairman and tries to say it was defense and she was being raped.  When in reality she tried to come onto him and he rejected, so she got upset and stabbed the guy to death.  Susan, you're so weird!  I guess she needed a man pretty badly.  You might say she was incredibly lonely and needed a man so badly, this is why she went insane.

The story gets a little more complex near the end involving family drama and how each family member plays a big role in how this story unravels, but I won't spoil any of that.  I'm just happy the story does eventually make sense because for a while it just looked like Susan's character was flat out insane without reason.  But WOW does Bo Svenson play an extremely big jerk of a detective.  He assumes that since the TV repairman had a preference for men, that Jimmy also had the same preferences but kept them hidden since he knew the repairman, and the two got into a fight and killed each other.  When Bo confronts Jimmy's character about this, Jimmy understandably gets REALLY defensive.

Bo even has the nerve to confront Jimmy's girlfriend and question her boyfriend's sexuality.  I like when she defends Jimmy by saying ""He's more of a man than you'll ever be!"" to the detective.  Even Susan gets defensive over the comments the detective's saying about her nephew, her one moment of normalcy!  This story becomes more complex when the high school basketball coach, who also prefers men, gets involved.  The detective assumes a murderous love triangle was going on, but the heavy emphasis on this aspect of the story is really cruel and makes it look like preferring the same sex is shameful.  I can guess the story will rub some people the wrong way.

Anyway Susan's character makes this movie great.  The story's pretty good too.  It's probably not as much of a horror as I would've liked, but Night Warning's still really appealing from a story point of view. Highly recommended.",1495843200,,4754,4.7274939172749395
8061667,5,B0009J2G5Y,Here he is at his best and this is a good movie under rated and misinterpreted.  I loved Jimmy McNichol but here he is as PERFECT as he can be as an actor and performer.  OH ... That's a repeat.  And so be that!!!,1396569600,,213,3.7954545454545454
8061668,5,B0009J2G5Y,"Copy's of this movie in this condition are pretty scarce so I had to pick this one up. Glad I did as I've never watched this film only heard about it. Every VHS collector probably has a copy of this because it's a 80's genre staple, I heard a DVD was in the works from Code Red but never happened. VHS is cool and so is this film so buy it!",1394409600,3,340,3.8028169014084505
8061669,3,B0009J2G5Y,"Another one of the titles that made the `Video Nasties` list for seemingly no good reason. This is three-quarters TV movie, and one-quarter slasher movie. It has some interesting ideas, but somehow, it never quite works. It`s good to see the female lead go quite mad at the end; which, if you can maintain interest until then, is worth the wait.

Still can`t see how this gets banned & the likes of Braindead is passed uncut. Inconsistency somewhere...",1391040000,,452,4.794871794871795
8061670,4,B0009J2G5Y,"I loved this Gem in 1982 - recall renting the VHS 3 times!!!!
Fast forward to 2010 when I purchased an old rental copy !!
What was I thinking ???
Now I see is as so bad its jaw dropping - yet still so captivating !!!
Unusual storyline for sure!! Probably banned for its subtle incest overtones , homophobia , gay verbal abuse !! Over the top acting is a camp fest!! I love this movie now & when it came out!!
I loved it when it came out as a horror drama! Now , I love it for it unusual story , campy cheesiness & over the top - made - for - tv  type film quality !
It has everything going for it: good & bad",1357084800,,608,3.75
8061671,5,B0009J2G5Y,"No need for me to dissect anything here: this film is unique, entertaining, and memorable. Susan Tyrrell is one of the most exciting actresses and absolutely delivers in this film. I can't imagine ANYBODY else executing this role in such a fashion. The homosexual angle is ahead of its time and quite bold and the incestual overtones...that alone makes it more frightening than 90% of horror films.
If you are wanting to be ""sceeered"", this may not be your film- but if you want something between a slasher film and psychological thriller with some uneasy comedy, this is about as good as it gets.

8061672,5,B0009J2G5Y,"This film has so much going for it. Top performances from the entire cast which is very surprising considering how bad they have been in other films! Susan Tyrell comes out on top, but Jimmy McNichol is very easy on the eyes though. Then the approach to handling the material which could have come off very laughable in lesser hands; it deals with homophobia, incest, racism, corruption, etc. Story unfolds in layers truly letting you get to know each of the characters who are all drawn out very well. Suspense and horror scenes handled with precision. This is one of those films that I can get something new out of with each viewing. A definate must for 80's horror fans!",1247270400,7,673,4.616666666666666
