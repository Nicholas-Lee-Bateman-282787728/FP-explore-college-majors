Silver Spear is a Master and paid assassin  who is hired by a wealthy and devious female clan leader for various missions--one of which involves killing three ruthless martial arts masters known as The Devil's Three. Meanwhile, a powerful villain known as The Old Recluse oppresses and tortures a famous weapons-maker and captures his blind daughter; forcing him to build his ultimate weapon, the Death Rings--a devastating mechanical flying guillotine that hasn't been seen in ten years. With this weapon, he can rule the Martial World... although others have their own plans about procuring the spinning wheel of death.

I personally like Jimmy as one of the ""One Armed Swordsmen"" and in  ""Blood of the Dragon"".",1495497600,,1113,5.032608695652174
