5183067,5,B008U0XKJK,To those of you who are Homeland fans and trying to figure out how to watch this Prisoners of War original series--I did a bit of checking around and discovered that this series is available for download on Hulu Plus!,1354233600,32,217,4.45
5183068,5,B008U0XKJK,"Obviously I purchased this because I was a fan of ""Homeland"" and I was curious about the inspiring miniseries; I was not disappointed.  ""Prisoners of War"" is something quite different from ""Homeland"", more emotional and to me more affecting.  I am pleased with my purchase.

Of course, this particular DVD set is region 2.  This wasn't a problem for me because I used the French solution to put it on my iPad, but it might be a small problem in the US if you intend to play it on a local DVD player.",1353715200,22,499,4.333333333333333
5183069,5,B008U0XKJK,"Invites comparison with Homeland, for obvious reasons (Gideon Raff created both series).  Much more humanly complex than its American cousin, and the Israeli characters have a sense of humor (Yael Eitan is terrific as the daughter of one of the returnees), sadly absent from the American script.  Non-Israelis probably miss a lot of the cultural references (I know I did) but reading about the lead-up to the release of Gilad Shalit can supply some context.  (The background music is wonderfully bad, which suggests more missed cultural references).

Probably only available in non-USA format to avoid competition with Homeland.  Definitely worth the investment, though.",1350777600,19,670,5.466019417475728
5183070,5,B008U0XKJK,Both seasons great to watch!,1495756800,,28,4.8
5183071,5,B008U0XKJK,"This one was extremely tough to watch, but so worth it. Homeland is based on this series and initially you can see where the inspiration comes from, but this one is a million times better. The acting is superb, you start to hate some characters even as you like them. They have gone through impossible situations and you never know what to expect or what will happen - or what happened. Really great stuff. I still find myself thinking about these characters.",1493164800,,459,4.609756097560975
5183072,3,B008U0XKJK,advertised as English audio.  Subtitles for Hebrew version.,1491782400,2,59,6.375
5183073,5,B008U0XKJK,"One of the best series I've ever watched. I finished the second season about a week ago, and I felt (and still feel) a sense of loss that it's over. Though I've been a fan of ""Homeland"" since the beginning, now that I've seen this inspiration for Showtime's version, my estimation has been lowered a bit--it seems rather overblown--""sexed up"" is the phrase that keeps coming to mind--by comparison. The 2 prisoners who return from captivity at the outset of ""Prisoners"" in season 1 seem truly broken and traumatized in a way that Damian Lewis's character does not, and they are far from ever being in the running for high political office (the Lewis character was being groomed for VP soon after his return). And there is no Carrie central figure, who at times seems almost a superhero (in the current season, she is even advising the US president, seemingly called in whenever POTUS needs national-security counseling, though she has left the employ of the gov't). There is pain in the prisoners' family relationships, their memories, their nightmares. There is plenty of suspense, and twists and turns galore, but here it seems much more organic than in ""Homeland."" To sum up, I can't recommend this hihly enough.",1487289600,,1215,4.874396135265701
5183074,5,B008U0XKJK,"2/16/2017 - Only people who don't know how to think would not like this series.  It is almost perfect, absolutely superb.  These are characters and situations that will stay with you for a long time, like those in classic literature.  If you love watching Clare Danes' cry face and listening to her shrill rants, story lines that don't make sense and have huge holes in them, stick with Homeland.  If you are interested in a great story that encompasses politics, drama, family, humor, suspense and courage, don't miss Prisoners of War.",1487116800,,536,4.857142857142857

5183116,4,B008U0XKJK,"The basis for Homeland.  Homeland is more polished, with the great timing and effect one would expect from Hollywood.  The original Israeli series is more thoughtful and psychological.
I loved it, but the Amazon Prime offering stops at Season 1 though a Season 2 was also made. For that reason I gave a 4 instead of a 5.",1444089600,,320,4.5
5183117,5,B008U0XKJK,The artistry and acting are stellar.  The storyline is heartbreaking and far better than Homeland.  The fact that Prisoners of War is an Israeli program and I had to watch in subtitles in no way bothered me.  I only wished I was able to read some of the background writing just so I could be immersed much more in the story.  I would love to watch the remaining episodes.  Here is the problem.  Amazon has chosen to insert their commercials at the most inconvenient times.  The fact that they even insert commercials in a prime product is galling.  This is the only reason I choose not to purchase any more episodes as the product itself is phenomenal.,1444089600,2,652,4.512820512820513

The actors are magnificent--- especially loved every scene between Uri and Nimrod.  The wives and children are fascinating and the choices they have made have consequences-  It is dark, and the torture scenes are difficult to watch, but at least they do not prolong it.

Prisoners of War is not for the faint-hearted because it's much too powerful and suspenseful. Keeps you guessing every minute what's going to happen next. Just when you think you've got it all figured out, you find out you were wrong!
Season 1 was great (mainly character development) and Season 2 exceeded all expectations (mainly suspense thriller). Sure hope there's going to be a Season 3.",1433980800,2,483,4.761904761904762

The series follows the return of two captured Israeli,soldiers after 27'years of captivity.  It explores the effects on them, their families. Their friends and especially the context of how they became,prisoners  and how their release really came,about.  The psychological,depth, political,gruesome,realism, the social,pressures in Israel, the purposeful manipulation of everyone by skilled,professionals is,draining, and gut wrenching.

I don't mind subtitles and here they are WELL worth putting up with for the mind-blowing acting, gritty realism of the story, and the masterfully crafted story lines.  I have to say, though, this has a COMPLETELY different feel to it than Homeland -- a much slower burn if I had to put my finger on it, but absolutely no less entertaining, eye opening, painful, and addictive.  Looking for (and finding) the threads from the original plot that were expanded on for Homeland from this original series will be a treat for Homeland fans and there's SO MUCH MORE -- one great example is the finger-tapping that isn't explained in Homeleand's pilot -- but it IS explained here -- and brilliantly.  There are just so many original, masterful, interpersonal conflicts and masterfully woven strands of plot to this I was super disappointed Season 2 wasn't available On Demand (but it IS available on DVD).  Much like Homeland, if you like the first episode, the rest is history -- I dreamt about the show non-stop the first night I started watching.  Interesting that the focus is far more on the captives than the intelligence community -- but no less edge-of-your-seat for it.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1423267200,3,1308,4.8125

It's a Hebrew language film with English subtitles. There are two seasons. I found them at my local library. The plot is only loosely related to ""Homeland""; i.e. the idea of return from captivity. In this case 3 Israeli POWs. A solid drama with insights into contemporary Israeli society--without the endless twists of"" Homeland.""

This is probably the only Israeli T.V. show I have ever seen and it is fully informative about  the state of consciousness ""on the ground"" in that country. The people, the difficulties, the way of life seem to be beautifully shown. Very informative, moving and altogether spellbinding. The second season, in which I'm now in the middle of, is even better.

5183149,5,B008U0XKJK,"One of the best television series. Homeland which I love is based on this Israeli series.  Prisoner Of War has  excellent acting, directing, and  writing.
Each episode leaves you with wanting more and more. It's different from Homeland but just as high quality of a series. After each episode there is a commentary by the director which I would highly recommend. It's easy to miss things because of the subtitles. This really helps to fill in any missing pieces. The commentary also helps you have a better understanding of life in Israel and how connected everybody is to the military.

One of the wonderful things I found is that a tv serie/show/ or film can be incredible without the 'Hollywood' of it all.  The actors, locations and the fact the characters don't have fancy make up, cars or homes is a plus.  The actors carry this series with incredible emotion.
Don't let the fact that it is in subtitles scare you off.",1412985600,2,577,4.355140186915888
5183157,5,B008U0XKJK,"Far superior to the slick Homeland, this is a very human and realistic thriller that defies categorization. Is it political or psychological?

In any case, after seventeen years in Syrian captivity under the most brutal conditions, two Israeli soldiers, Nimrode and Uri are returned home. Not so fortunate is their fellow captive Amiel, who comes back in  a body bag.

Uri, sensitive and gentle, has to deal with the additional trauma that the love of his life, Nurit, has married his brother and has a thirteen year old son. Nurit, in turn, is torn between her family, her love for Uri and the terrible guilt she feels toward both men.  Nimrode, a strong man who is harboring a terrible secret, which in addition to the torture he suffered, is giving him PTSD. He, though longing for his wife and children all those years, has difficulty adjusting to family life. His well meaning, strong, but terribly intrusive wife, Talia,  cannot understand the trauma he is dealing with, and despite her good intentions, behaves like a punitive mother towards him. Nimrode wants to get back to life, fun, work-and yet he must overcome the one terrible thing that is holding him back from letting his family-including his two messed up and funny children- back into his reality. Almost immediately after their return, the two men are debriefed by a cold-hearted psychiatrist specializing in intelligence and security issues, but given absolutely no psychotheraputic  help in dealing with their traumas.
The third touching storyline, deals with Yael, the young, lovely, winsome sister of the dead man-who is bereft at the loss of her entire family and is left alone in a country house with a collection of stray dogs. Yael cannot cope with her solitude or death of her brother and hallucinates funny and moving conversations with him. She does not want to go on with life, yet she is loved by Elan, an IDF liaison between the families of dead and captured soldiers.

The way I have described it makes it sound like a soap opera, but its not. It is a tightly written, beautifully acted thriller which will have you on the edge of your seat until the final shocking revelation-which will turn the two prisoners' world upside down and provide the breakthrough they need to move forward. Mature, thoughtful and deeply human- the viewer will feel for each one of these people who are caught up in events greater than themselves- the program has far greater depth than Homeland and yet manages to be both exciting and stirring. Highly recommended--and I hope Amazon acquires the already available second season soon.",1411689600,2,2660,4.886917960088692

5183165,4,B008U0XKJK,"""Prisoners of War (original title in Hebrew:  Translit.: Hatufim Translated: ""Abductees"") is an Israeli television drama series made by Keshet and originally aired from March to May 2010. The series was created by Israeli director, screenwriter and producer Gideon Raff.&#34"" Wikipedia

The series, set in 2008, portrays three Israeli soldiers who were captured seventeen years ago while on a secret mission with their unit in Lebanon. The story begins with their return home. Nimrod Klein and Uri Zach return alive, while their friend Amiel Ben-Horin comes back in a coffin. The actors playing Nimrod and Uri are superb, and they have won awards. The series shows  Nimrod and Uri trying to fit into society. Israel has made them national heroes, but they have secrets and terrible trauma to overcome. They are also working through the PTSD of being held captive and tortured. They must deal with their families, some who waited patiently and some who did not. We are also introduced to the sister of the dead returned soldier. She has bizarre dreams, and is a little off center.

Nimrod and Uri have to undergo psychiatric evaluations and debriefings. The military psychologist finds some strange mysteries in their stories, and is convinced that they have something to hide. I have to say the psychologist used nefarious means to talk with the returnees, and acted in an unethical manner. At no time was serious psychological assistance offered to them.

Each episode was gripping and went back to the days of their capture, and we see glimpses of the torture they underwent. This is really a remarkable series, and one that is not easy to forget. The US bought rights to the story, and we now have 'Homeland', a take-off of the original Israeli series.

Highly Recommended.  prisrob 01-21-13",1358726400,9,1794,5.02020202020202

5183167,5,B008U0XKJK,"Far superior in every way to its ""global"" version, Homeland, to the point that it's difficult to imagine that it was written by the same screenwriter.  Also hard to imagine that this was filmed non-linearly (scenes shot at the same location grouped together), and on an extremely low budget, according to Gideon Raff.
This is about as good as TV gets.
