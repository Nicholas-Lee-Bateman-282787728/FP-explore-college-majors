8033499,5,B0002W4KI4,"I laughed so hard during this movie I was crying!  However, my husband thought it was the most ridiculous movie he's ever had to endure with me.  So in the same household we had two totally opposite reactions.  No matter, it was funny and even he still brings it up... years after we watched it!  It's full of overacting and embellishing, which to me is what makes it so funny.  I'm a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and was not offended in the least (neither was my husband) by any of its content.  So sit back, relax, and enjoy (as my husband coined it) ""stupid comedy"".  Hilarious!",1373846400,,610,4.392857142857143
8033500,5,B0002W4KI4,"This movie was very cute and very funny.

I probably would have only given it four stars, but I can't help but feel it does not deserve all the bad reviews.  First, I will tell you that I'm not LDS. I do know some Mormons, so it probably helped me get the jokes.

The Movie gave me quite a few laughs. It does NOT make fun of Mormons; it makes fun of the ""morman culture"" being such a contrast to ""Hollywood movie culture"".

I'm sad for anyone who can't laugh at themselves.  Especially with a movie like this, that at no time presents LDS in a bad light.",1141948800,3,555,4.101851851851852
8033501,1,B0002W4KI4,"I was vacationing in Salt Lake doing Genealogy, when a random guy on the street handed me this flyer, advertising a special ""early premier"" of the movie. It was for that evening at the Salt Lake Public Library. We had nothing else to do, and thought it might be neat to go back to where we lived in Arizona and say that we had seen a LDS movie before any of them had, let alone anyone else in Salt Lake [LDS movies generally take 3 months or so to get down to AZ, if ever, most don't]. Anyway, so we went, expectations high for this new LDS movie, as it was during the big boom of LDS film on the ""silver screen"". Anyway, the person I was with had an uneasy feeling, said they worried about it being an ""anti"" movie. I reassured her that the name rang a bell from a reputable LDS movie website I had visited before, and that it was on the up and up. For the most part I wasn't exactly correct in that reassurance.

Anyway, we go. The person who comes and sits next to me I cannot even begin to describe. Piercing everywhere, tattoo, colored hair, the works. Wearing a T-Shirt with some logo I wouldn't be caught dead in. Obviously not a Mormon. My first reaction was, ""Cool, missionary work. The guy wandered in here and now he is going to get taught what the gospel is"". I was far from the truth. He laughed up a storm when it began, whereas I just sort of sat and fumed. To make matters short we both left after 20 minutes or so. I had enough and was embarrassed to have supported it so much. This guy sitting next to me was literally doubled over in laughter. At one point I saw the title ""Mockumentary"", in some early ads. I think they got rid of it before the theater release because they didn't want it associated with the film. Anyway, in the beginning when they used it, granted, they were mocking LDS Films, with the premise being Richard Dutcher was dead. I left feeling that they were mocking the LDS church in general though, even if that wasn't there goal. The non-mormons were clearly laughing AT us, not with us as in RM and Singles Ward and such.

Even if it hadn't been mocking us, as I felt it was, and even if it had been truly oriented on this plot of finding a replacement for Dutcher, it was a poor quality movie. Bad filming and directing in my mind. It is just like 3 guys who literally look like they have camcorders, recording eachother in various monuments around Salt Lake talking about how they were best! A stupid movie period.

Anyway, PLEASE don't spend your money on the DVD. I PROMISE it is not worth seeing, and I would NEVER want to own it. It is not a wholesome movie. It is for the non-mormons to see how crazy we are. I don't think it is appropriate at all. Just the title should say it all, ""Mockumentary""

If you want to buy an LDS DVD I highly suggest ""The Best Two Years"", or ""The RM"", or ""Singles Ward"", or ""Other Side of Heaven"". If you have older members of the family ""Saints and Soldiers"" won many film festivals. I personally saw it and it was breathtaking. Excellent scenery, excellent story, excellent acting. You can probably pass on ""The Home Teachers"", or ""Baptists at Our Barbeque"", but even those two at least are wholesome, and if it comes to that I would strongly advise those any day over ""Work and the Story"".",1126137600,4,3269,4.284789644012945
8033502,1,B0002W4KI4,"I saw this in the theatre with eight other people on opening night.  We were pretty excited to see it, and about 30 minutes into it all nine of us wanted to leave.  The theatre manager gave us our money back, apologized to us for the movie, told us that they had been giving refunds on each showing that day, and that they were dropping it immediately.  While I can only infer the entire movie quality from the first 30 minutes and the manager's comments about other audiences, I can directly say that the first 30 minutes was possibly the most stupid movie of all time.

Trying too hard to be funny?  Here's an example: There was a joke in the first part of the movie (the ""Laman and Lemuel"" joke) that the movie invested so heavily in that you could almost hear the drum-roll leading up to it and crash-of-the-cymbals right after.  Only problem: the joke was so un-funny it insulted the intelligence of the audience.  Note to the movie director: Jokes with punch-lines don't belong in movies.  Save it for the chicken who crossed the road.  If I could give this 0 stars I would.",1125619200,5,1080,4.441624365482234
8033503,2,B0002W4KI4,"Okay, this wasn't the worst thing I've ever seen.  And thank goodness it wasn't feature length (only 70 minutes).  But I sat there looking at my watch counting down the moments until the ending credits.

Funny?  I think I laughed about three times.  I laughed enough to award it an extra star.  You'll laugh more actually watching most Mormon Cinema.  But they were trying so (too?) hard to be funny... it just didn't catch.

Different?  Oh, yeah!!!

Interesting?  Not really.

Worth the time to watch?  I would say (in fact yell) no.  It is rather pointless and a waste of 70 minutes of my life.

Recommended?  Well, I actually used to make movies in high school and I'm LDS (a mormon) so this should have been right up my alley.  If you are neither or one of these two then I would say no.  If you are both of these, then maybe.  But I wish I never rented this.",1109980800,5,863,4.314465408805032
8033504,3,B0002W4KI4,"This is one of the stranger movies you're likely to see.  It will be much funnier to people who know a great deal about Mormon lifestyle and culture, and at least a little about moviemaking, and the temperment of moviemakers and the actors who work for them.

But novices may as well take a whack at it. The Mormon jokes come thick and fast, and, as usual, will probably be confusing to anyone who doesn't deeply understand the culture.  (If you don't get the joke in the title, for example, you're already behind the 8-ball.)

The humor in this movie typically comes from the sparks that fly between the standard-issue Mormons interacting with the significantly more avant-garde creative Mormon community--the kind of folks that Boyd K. Packer skewered years ago in his talk on tempermental Mormon ""artistes"".  Of course, both sides are skewered equally in this short (about 70 minutes) movie.

The movie is filmed in the ""mockumentary"" style made famous by Rob Reiner's ""This Is Spinal Tap""--which, for the record, I saw before I joined the Church.

Anyway, the movie includes some bright, creative moments, including a funny take-off on ""Amadeus"".  For me, though, the laugh-out-loud funniest part in the movie is a bit called ""Mormon's Apocalypse"".  Without giving it away, it's one of the funniest movie scenes I've ever seen.  Right up there with the hilarious ""Day-O"" segment from ""Beetlejuice"".  (But again, if you're not familiar with the religion, it won't make much sense.  If you are, though, it is VERY funny.)

If the rental price is cheap, and you're willing to watch anything from the sometimes-lame-but-always-wholesome world of Mormon cinema, then give it a try.  Sometimes they hit, sometimes they miss...but at least they're trying.",1103068800,4,1752,5.038194444444445
