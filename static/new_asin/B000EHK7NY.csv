(the length was half the impact), everything here is essential early Andy Warhol and should be in everyone's library but it loses 2 stars for the editing",1386288000,,291,4.290909090909091

Unless you know someone who works at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art or are friends with the curator of The Andy Warhol Museum, you are NOT going to see the four films presented on this, now, out of print DVD. The films were never intended for commercial exhibition and they are rarely shown in the above mentioned museums. All four films included on this DVD have been carefully transferred from half inch master tapes The Museum of Modern Art's Department of Film used for posthumous Warhol exhibits and the quality is exemplary.

There are optional introductions to each film by media and film historians, Adriano Apra and Bruno Di Marino whose insightful commentaries enhance the viewing experience.  If that's not all, the DVD also comes with a high quality, full color, sixty page book that illustrates the history of each film. If you are a fan of Andy Warhol, underground film, pop art or are an art history student, you will not be disappointed with your purchase.

Now, a word of caution for those of you who are simply curious - if you have never seen an Andy Warhol film or an underground film made in the fifties or sixties, I would highly recommend you not purchase this DVD package. Andy Warhol shot these films using black and white, low light 16mm film; they are dark and very grainy (that's the way they originally looked in 1964 so don't go thinking the quality is terrible...because that was Warhol's intent).  The four films presented on this DVD are artistic experiments created by Warhol and were meant as art installations where patrons would view the moving images for a minute or two and then carry on their cocktail conversations; they were not meant to be viewed as one might watch a Hollywood film, they were meant to be viewed as one would observe a painting. There is no story, no plot, no cinematography, no acting or sound - it is art and nothing more.

An addendum for you collectors out there - the version of Empire on this DVD is only one hour long.  The Metropolitan Museum of Art meant this version as ""a taste"" to only be shown in art galleries in 1989. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, along with the Andy Warhol Museum, vowed to never allow Empire to be released on video in any format and has subsequently ordered Raro Video to terminate production of this DVD. Empire will never be released on DVD again, so pick this official version up before the price goes through the roof.",1363564800,,2629,4.616702355460386
