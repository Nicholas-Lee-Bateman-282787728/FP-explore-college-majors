8662551,4,B00KXQL5TG,"Did John Garfield ever play a part that wasn't hard as nails and brimming with swagger? In BLACKWELL'S ISLAND, he inhabits the role of tough-talking, crusading New York reporter Tim Haydon. Tim's one of those confident hombres who thinks he'll always land on his feet. Take the time he got sacked from the Star-Sentinel for writing an incendiary piece the mob didn't appreciate. Same day, later on, he lands a gig with a rival paper, the Times Dispatch.

Tim may see himself as the cock of the walk, but, underneath the conceit and the abrasiveness, he's got a good soul. Somewhere along the way he falls for a nurse named Mary ""Sunny"" Walsh (Rosemary Lane). And when Sunny's cop brother Terry (Dick Purcell)... well, someone does him wrong... Tim determines to move heaven and earth to take down the criminal kingpin what done it.

New York City in 1939, bustling and teeming with the lunch pail society and dreamers and hustlers. And quick to take advantage is ""Bull"" Bransom (Stanley Fields), the mobster behind the shakedown racket that, in polite company, he calls the Waterfront Protective Association. Bull is an odd duck. When he's not extorting money from tugboat and steamship captains, he keeps an ant farm. And he sure loves his mean-spirited pranks.

But the mighty sometimes falls. Not even Bull's pocket politician Steve Cardigan (Morgan Conway) can keep him from being sent to prison. Except, boy, does Bull know how to make lemonade out of lemons. In the infamous penitentiary on Blackwell's Island, he commences to lord it over his inmates and the prison guards and even the dang warden. He takes over the prison's hospital wing as his new headquarters.

Lotsa folks don't have the moxie to punch the prosecutor and get sentenced to six months behind bars. But, the way our intrepid repoter, Tim Haydon, figures it, it's the most expedient way to have a rendezvous with Bull. See, Tim still has a score to settle. He's still hell bent on getting the goods on him, on breaking Bull's airtight alibi of being locked up so how could he possibly have committed a certain murder outside of stir?

THEY MADE ME A CRIMINAL (1939) is my all-time favorite John Garfield movie - it's what introduced me to him - but, oboy, do I enjoy plenty of his work, including this one. BLACKWELL'S ISLAND finds Garfield at his two-fisted, my-tough-is-tougher-than-your-tough best. Man, I would've loved to have seen Garfield and Cagney in the same movie, ripping the screen. They remind me so much of each other, except Garfield can't tap dance. Then, again, Garfield scored more of the matinee idol looks. But both Cagney and Garfield generated pulse-pounding vitality and a volatile acting style that was mesmerizing. Watching them from the theater or from your living room, it feels like you're getting slapped around by their live wire performances. BLACKWELL'S ISLAND is typical of the cop-and-gangster pictures Warner Brothers released in droves in the 1930s. A cool thing was that Blackwell's Island was used for the actual location shoots. This was initially a B-movie that was elevated to ""A"" status when Garfield's film debut in FOUR DAUGHTERS (1938) proved to be a hit and garnered Garfield solid reviews. THEY MADE ME A CRIMINAL actually reached the masses before BLACKWELL'S ISLAND and was another hit. BLACKWELL'S ISLAND validated Garfield even more as a rising star in Hollywood.",1518134400,,3390,4.95079086115993
