1219016,2,B00000I4VZ,"Poor acting, poor plot, bad special effects, would not waste my time watching this movie.  It was really really bad.",1391040000,,116,4.8
1219017,4,B00000I4VZ,"Amy Harding (Pamela Gidley) goes into the deep woods to stay at her family's cabin. She is unaware that something very strange has been happening since her last visit. Something is lurking about, and it's NOT friendly! Amy notices odd things, but really starts to worry when her cat gets eaten! A scientist happens along, and Amy reluctantly joins forces w/ him to deal w/ the creature. It appears that a mutant lizard is on the loose. The thing bites Amy's finger and escapes. After killing it, the scientist examines it, and discovers that the little beastie has sharp fangs w/ a venomous bite. The pair wind up stranded after getting the car stuck, and hike to the closest neighbor's cabin for help. Oh no! The neighbor's been stripped to the bone by a gaggle of mutants! Luckily, he left the gas stove on full blast, so Amy takes out her trusty matches annnd... KA-BOOOM! Back at her own cabin, Amy and Marshal (the science guy) find out that the monster was pregnant! Now, the offspring are somewhere in the cabin! Luckily, Amy has a rifle, and she's a crack shot! POP! POP! POP! (it's a small caliber rifle) POP! What the...? This generation of mutants has adapted! They are now impervious to bullets, and they shoot venom like super-soakers! Amy and Marshal are going to have to do some adapting of their own if they want to survive the night. These things evolve fast, becoming more invulnerable after each attack. ABERRATION is a silly / cheeezy monster movie w/ some interesting monsters. It also has a nice, gruesome plot twist near the end. Hoozzah!...",1378252800,5,1564,4.6909090909090905
1219018,5,B00000I4VZ,"There were very few horror movies in the 90's that were good. Event Horizon, Hellraiser: Bloodline, maybe Wishmaster and that about sums it up. This movie was and still is one of my favorites. Plus Pamela Gidley was awesome.",1377561600,,224,4.769230769230769
1219019,2,B00000I4VZ,"Years ago a young Sid had caught the end of Aberration, not knowing the title or really much about the movie at that time. We were surprised to blindly stumble across it the other evening and had to go for it all these years later. From what we remember it seemed really cool....however we couldn't have been more wrong. This movie couldn't have moved at a slower pace. It was almost like watching Santa go out for a pass while nobody is guarding him, and no matter how hard he runs it looks like it's in slow motion as the ball flies 35 yards over his head.

Aberration starts with some broad whose hiding out in a remote cabin in the middle of the woods. She just stole a bunch of scratch from the Russian mob and now is trying to keep things on the down low. While at the cabin all her food starts getting mangled up by some type of creature, which turn out to be some ravenous killer lizards. She enlists the help of some back woods loser who thought this film was his big break. He was like ""oh yeah I gotta have that, I ain't leaving the beach til I see him."" Really, we're going with Dice references right now? Anyway these two ball bags start a war against these plastic lizards with very little success. The bad part was the first hour was all dialogue boring everyone to tears. By time the lizards start tearing it up you're barely conscious to enjoy it.

Really Aberration was a big let down considering what we thought it would be. Anytime you're main start is a bunch of plastic lizards purchased at Toys R Us, how do you not deliver a 5 star event. The things were seriously plastic lizards! All they did was move their mouths and get dragged around by a string to simulate movement. That in itself was the only reason for the 2 stars. We saw more action in the Ramada room that Saturday night when Santa yelled ""call the front desk, there's a snake in the room!"" after mistaking his specs for the reptile. Even the knock off M&M's and red hots that were spilled all over the floor were more entertaining then this mess. All we could say at the end was ""enjoying the show bi**hes?""",1298505600,,2095,4.30126582278481
1219020,5,B00000I4VZ,"Very cool!  Is all I have to say about this movie!  Pamela Gidley is ultra hot in this movie and I just loved the shower scene with her in it, as I'm sure most men will!  Besides that, the creatures in the cabin is an interesting take and the guy who plays Yuri is a cool villian!  I saw this movie years ago when I was in love with this beautiful girl I was dating at the time and I rented it on a dare from Blockbuster and I always liked the idea of someone purposely looking for peace and quiet in a remote cabin but finding none!  It deserves its title of cult status and I actually hope they put this film out on dvd soon, with some extra cool special features thrown in!  That would be cool!  Buy this movie and I bet you'll really like it!",1147046400,6,746,3.966442953020134
1219021,2,B00000I4VZ,"I actually got a kick out of this movie.  I just watched it yesterday on Sci Fi.  I had never seen nor even heard of it before but there wasn't much else on, so I decided to give it a try.  I think I may have missed a little of the beginning but I got to see most of it.  It's not a ""good"" movie by any means but I found it more engaging and entertaining than a lot of other movies that Sci Fi shows.  For some reason I found Simon Bossell's character especially appealing and I liked that he didn't seem to take his role too seriously, though he wasn't exactly hamming it up.

I really enjoyed Charles Tatum's description of this movie, found below.  It's definitely accurate, but I wouldn't call it an ""awful awful movie.""  I've seen much worse.  It's by no means Oscar-worthy but if you enjoy slightly goofy sci fi movies that don't offer much explanation, this is a decent choice.",1127692800,5,884,4.245508982035928
1219022,2,B00000I4VZ,"To put things in perspective - this isn't, I believe, a movie that is meant to be taken very seriously.  It plays out in semi-humorous form in somewhat the same manner as Leprechaun.
That said, Charles Tatum's review was more fun to read than the movie itself was to watch!",1047081600,,273,4.46
1219023,1,B00000I4VZ,"Pamela Gidley is Amy, who arrives at an isolated cabin in the woods. She is packing a whole lot of cash, and a whole lot of cute. The cabin has not been used in years, and we find out she used to go there as a child. She cleans the place up and she and her trusty cat make themselves at home. She frequents the general store of nice Mrs. Miller (Helen Moulder), and she meets Marshall (Simon Bossell), a field researcher.
Marshall is investigating why all the wildlife in the area is disappearing. He is collecting bags of what can only be described as goop, and begins suspecting a new species of animal is eating everything in the woods. This corresponds with Amy's discovery of goop in her cabin, which she blames on mice. As Amy gets some heavy duty rat spray, her car conveniently breaks down, and she heads back to the cabin with Marshall. A convenient blizzard blows upon the film. The screenplay and acting blows so far, so why not a blizzard? Our ""heroes"" discover weird neighbor Peterson being eaten alive in his own cabin, and blow the cabin up. This starts one very long set piece as the couple finds time to bicker cute in between killing the awful lizard puppets.
And then there's Yuri. Yuri (Valery Nikolaev) is Amy's former boyfriend who arrives demanding his money. They fleeced a few people in Chicago, and Amy split with the dough. Yuri brings a four wheel drive, a couple of guns, and an attitude. Perfect monster lizard bait. He is dispatched. The couple then blow up the cabin.
Amy and Marshall, still bickering, flee in the four wheel drive which breaks down in a field because of the lizards. So they blow it up. They flee to Mrs. Miller's store, taking a lizard with them, and blow it up. The viewer pours lighter fluid on his television during the end credits, and blows it up.
Although set in the United States, this was shot in New Zealand, and it shows. Amy and Marshall are the most unpleasant couple I have ever had the disservice to cheer for. Director Tim Boxell spent all of his money on the gore effects, so for every disgusting bloody lizard stomping, there is a horrible puppet lizard effect.
Dumb ideas are introduced, then dropped. Amy loads a super soaker with poison, then it is never used. Where did it come from? Why is the gas still turned on to a cabin that has sat vacant for over a decade? Why does Mrs. Miller keep referring to living in a small town, when she and Peterson seem to be the only occupants and her store the only building? Where did the dang lizards come from in the first place? Much is made of the lizards able to spray poison from their mouths, yet this only happens twice! For ninety three minutes, this is one long dull boring film.
""Aberration"" has gained a weird cult status, according to some other reviews I have read on other sites. Do not believe them, this is an awful awful film. I do not recommend it.
This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, strong gun violence, strong gore, profanity, and brief female nudity.",1023148800,7,2995,4.477148080438757

1219048,3,B00000I4VZ,"I must say, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this B-movie.  It's loaded with silly action, playful humor, and rubber lizards that violate everything you learned in biology class; zaniness abounds.  If you watch only the first 10, 20 or 30 minutes of this, you'd think you'd be making the right decision to stop watching.  Just please keep watching.  If you've ever loved a B movie this will probably be a pleasant surprise for you.

This film opens with a sluggish pace as we meet Amy (Pamela Gidley; Cherry 2000) and her cat moving into her vacation home (?), a secluded cabin in the woods, where something is clearly (to the audience) amiss.  The cat functions very much as dogs often do in horror, hesitating to enter the cabin as if it sensed an enemy and pointing out clues to the presence of ""something"" else.

We encounter traces of thick, green ""horror movie"" monster slime in and around her cabin.  What's more is that the local elderly weirdo's dog has disappeared and a nearby biologist is collecting samples of slimy reptilian skin sheddings in the wild.  Playing the harbinger trope, the old man warns Amy to ""get out while she still can"" because it's ""mating season.""  Evidently this guy knows something bad is coming and, for some reason, doesn't take the time to explain.  Isn't that just always the case in horror movies, by the way?  How the people who could actually save your life are too busy being vague and weird to consider explaining something.

Observing signs of some sort of infestation, she buys some bug spray and mouse traps.  But after she comes home to a mutilated cat, it's apparent this is more than a few roaches or mice.  Our know-it-all biologist reveals that they're dealing with geckoes, mutant geckoeswith teeth!  In fact, it's an iguana-gecko hybrid that spits poison!  Ridiculous!  But also stupid fun.

What follows are some pleasant surprises including a feasted upon human corpse, plenty of laughs, a gooey dissection, stupid nonsense science, rubber lizard monsters, idiotic logic, pulsating mutant lizard eggs, some unexpectedly random martial arts, communicating like velociraptors in Jurassic Park (1993), three explosions, lots of gory lizard splatters and slimy gooey egg squishing.  There's a surprising amount of bad humorous B-action here, and only a few seconds of it are CGI.

This B-movie plays all the strings of horror tropes.  The weirdo harbinger, the pet sentinel, the secluded cabin in the woods, an incoming storm, a socially awkward scientist who seems to know everything and the uncharacteristically sensual candlelit bath scene.  But all these tropes are delivered with a sort of forgivable B-movie charm.  This movie is surprisingly likable.  The pinnacle of the eye-rolling so-bad-it's-good moments comes when Amy drowns a lizard, that then ""evolves"" (complete misuse of the word evolve, by the way) gills right in front of them!  They also develop an immunity to poison in hours and develop bulletproof scales!!!!  Yeah, this is surely something your biology teacher never wanted you to see.

I must say, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this B-movie.  If you watch only the first 10, 20 or 30 minutes of this, you'd think you'd be making the right decision to stop watching.  Just please keep watching.  If you've ever loved a B movie this will probably be a pleasant surprise for you.  There are LOADS of scenes with effects and blood and zaniness!",1457827200,4,3431,4.923344947735192

1219058,3,B00000I4VZ,"As others have already commented, the special effects aren't very good, but when the vicious monsters are small enough to hide in a house but large enough to kill people, just having them pop out at the characters is pretty effective for a chill or two.  Overall the movie isn't as bad as I expected.  Amy and Marshal are pretty good main characters with some funny dialogue.  Marshall keeps his head pretty well and isn't as stupid as most horror movie characters.  I used fast forward a little bit.  As movies go this is probably two stars, as horror movies go, it is more three stars.  In addition to a couple of people, there is a dead dog, a dead cat, two dead goldfish, numerous dead creatures and $50,000 burned to ashes.

however, when you think about it, $50K isn't exactly big time, so that pretty much tells you she was just penny ante small time, not that she had the brains for the major leagues.

her personality is so offensive you really want the little creature features to devour her.

I love that scene where they walk into the neighbors cabin, discover that it's flooded with gas and then she lights a match when she spots one of the critters..........OMG it's a special kind of stupid.

She runs off to that crummy a** crack of a shack that runs neck n neck with the worst of inner city public housing in the middle of freaking nowhere in a 30 year old VW Beetle. vintage doesn't even begin to describe this automotive nightmare; she still could have struck a better cash deal than that at the used car lot even with a crummy $50K.

this gal is seriously into pyrotechnics, sometimes deliberately, mostly due to her own incompetence, and yet she 's supposed to be a good shot; frankly I wouldn't want to be within a mile of that moron with a gun in her hands......maybe even 2 or 3 miles, I forget what kind of trajectory stray bullets are capable of.

I can't believe that sweet scientist dude fell for her, she's such an obnoxiously stupid bossy (expletive deleted) I hate her.
If the theoretical armageddon ever happened and I were a straight man and she was the only woman left, forget it, the world ain't startin' over.

While the title creatures (mutant geckos) evolve at an unbelievable rate to thwart the efforts of the humans trying to kill them that is the only part of the script that requires major suspension of disbelief. The story is smartly written and every character in the film serves a purpose without being simple throwaway creature fodder. Just as importantly each character has a reason for being where they are and doing what they do, something I wish more horror movies followed. The creature effects are basic but fairly well done given the budget and are used in ways that remain effective throughout the film. The pacing is solid and the cast is pretty good and while its not the best acting every no one is bad, hammy or cheesy.

7909551,2,B00000I4VZ,"I would have given this more stars and written an indepth review like I do every night, which I think you at Amazon appreciate. However, yesterday I was attacked racially and bullied and publicly insulted by Ryan an Amazon customer service rep who attacked me on racial grounds. My morale is so low regarding Amazon right now that I would rather cry some more than do a good job for you reviewing. If you look at my history, I have been a great movie watcher, Prime subscriber, spend tens of thousands of dollars a year on Amazon, and have been your greatest cheerleader. Ryan's stunning racist bullying, hiim being an amazon customer service rep of ALL THINGS, has broken my heart and hurt me from all my enthusiasm for Amazon. I wish someone would let someone know that one racist, bullying, humiliating employee can cost SO many good movie reviews, and thousands of dollars in sales, and general happy, energetic participation in your great programs like these free movies. I asked for an apology but he refused. I can't review movies until I recover. I am SO HURT that a racist bully is allowed to torture great enthusiastic customers like me and nothing happens. He wasn't even made to apologize. And now look--it's affecting me globally in my relationship with Amazon and ability to participate in movie reviews, of which I did a LOT and gave a LOT of 5 stars. I'm crying again. Someone needs to look into Ryan's issues and ask if someone like that should be representing the company I love above all other companies, that being Amazon. I can't even review movies, from crying at what Ryan did to me.",1496102400,,1606,4.658450704225352
