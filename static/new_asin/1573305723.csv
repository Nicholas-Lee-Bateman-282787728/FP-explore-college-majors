190998,5,1573305723,This movie was great in that it taught my three year old how to remember her phone number and what to do if she's lost in a store.  I love having this movie on hand since it sends a message that needs to be heard over and over.  As usual sesame street does a great job getting the point across while keeping it simple and entertaining.,1282694400,,335,4.0606060606060606
190999,5,1573305723,"I bought this for my grandson, who just turned 8 months old.  Both we and his parents have portable DVD players, he watches in the car and at home.  He loves Sesame Street and its characters, and he'll watch videos for 30 to 35 minutes at home almost without moving.  I watched some of this video with him, and it's very cute. If your baby has a good attention span and likes Sesame Street, I recommend this video.",1264291200,,414,4.282051282051282
191000,4,1573305723,"After my disappointment with Elmo's Magic Cookbook, I was a little reticent to view any of the ""Kid's Guide to Life"" videos - I was afraid they would be badly-produced and full of platitudes.  I needn't have worried - this is a terrific, entertaining video with the potential to create dialogue between you and your toddler.  My son (almost three) and I watched together, and enjoyed it as much as a regular Sesame Street episode.
In the story, Big Bird and Maria go shopping at ABCD Mart (shot in what must be a real ""Mart"" store.)  Before they go, Maria makes sure Big Bird understands how easy it is to get lost, and how important it is to stick together.  Then they discuss what to do if they get separated.  She teaches Big Bird his Granny Bird's phone number with a song, and tells him how to identify people who can help (store employees, police.)  When Big Bird gets lost chasing a wayward skate, he finds a store employee, who helps him find Maria again.
The style of this tape is very like a Sesame Street episode. The songs are very entertaining - even the spoof on ""Maria."" (hey, they had to do it sometime!) and because the production values were very good, it was easy to compare to real experiences in  later discussion.  Frances McDormand was excellent, didn't play ""celebrity appearance"" at all.  I highly recommend this one.",1054598400,10,1342,4.581589958158996
191001,5,1573305723,"In this excellent video, we are given a situation that many parents should consider: not letting their child wander away from them in a large store. In this video, Big Bird and Maria go shopping in a large mall-like department store. Somehow, Big Bird wanders off and Maria gets worried. This is THE video for those who want to know how they can prevent this from happening.  END",894844800,16,379,4.573529411764706
7797960,5,1573305723,I hope all you parents and children out there will take Frances McDormand's advice because the special message she gives to all you parents and children at the end of the video on what to do when you get lost or prevent your child from getting lost is something for all you parents and children out there to keep in mind.,1523664000,,321,4.278688524590164

7797966,5,1573305723,"My daughter loves this video. She has borrowed it from the library many times and I was finally able to find a used-like new copy at a reasonable price. (New copies are overpriced because apparently the video is no longer being packaged for sale.) One thing I like about the story is that Big Bird gets separated from Maria in the store, and a lot of kids can relate to this scary experience. Also, it teaches kids what to do if they get lost and shows them what is likely to happen (store employee reunites child and adult). There is also some humor interjected into the story, and Frances McDormand has a role. Another element of the story is that it is Snuffleupagus's birthday and Big Bird wants to buy him a present--thus, the shopping trip.",1382313600,,746,4.492647058823529
7797967,5,1573305723,"I sent this DVD (along with 6 other ""Big Bird"" DVDs) to a child who has never experienced Big Bird. She'll open them all up on Christmas Day - and I'm certain she won't be disappointed.",1354320000,,185,4.166666666666667
