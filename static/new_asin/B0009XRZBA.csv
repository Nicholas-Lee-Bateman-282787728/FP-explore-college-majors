2334530,1,B0009XRZBA,"This title is NOT for weight loss. No way! Worse, it is messaged to women and might send an unsuspecting male running. The balancing portion (20 minutes and one of two workouts) opens with a bizzarre statement about womens' menstrual cycles and seems to admonish women not to exert themselves during the monthly cycle, referencing this again in the same workout.

I contacted the company and asked to return it for ""philosophical differences"" as relating to the above, but they will not accept a return unless ordered directly from their site.",1143158400,2,543,4.967032967032967
2334531,2,B0009XRZBA,"I was disappointed in this video. Suzanne Deason is one of my favorite instructors, usually during her workouts I am challenged, without being overly so.  This video is really only ok for people who want a very light workout.  Maybe when you're tired, have a minor injury, or just want a little energy boost.  But, if you're serious about weightloss, this light workout won't offer much to help you toward your goal.",1139270400,15,416,4.75
2334532,1,B0009XRZBA,"I can't in good faith give this more than 1 star because this is just half of an existing Gaiam DVD being rebranded, but I like this workout quite a lot. Instead of the aerobic drill I feared, it's instead a set of early morning stretches to gently get your metabolism going and improve your circulation.

The exercise portion of the DVD is only 22 minutes long. It begins with some very easy cat-cow type stretches, then six minutes of slow, gentle standing poses (triangle, side angle pose), then some relaxing poses on the floor, working their way up to about 30 sec in a modified downward dog at the end of the video. Many poses are supported by bricks, and they're all safe enough that I wouldn't hesitate to give this video to a friend who had never done yoga before. Suzanne Deason never names the poses or gives very specific style points, so this tape may be frustrating for someone with a lot of  yoga experience.

I think this is a wonderful workout for someone who would have difficulty doing a more vigorous video due to fatigue, injury, weight, etc.",1135900800,29,1063,4.526041666666667
2334533,1,B0009XRZBA,"...IF YOU HAVE AM/PM YOGA FOR WEIGHT LOSS.  THIS CONTAINS THE A.M. PORTION.  IT MENTIONS THIS NOWHERE ON THE COVER BUT SUZANNE DEASON INTRODUCES IT AS A.M YOGA FOR WEIGHT LOSS IN HER INTRO!!! THIS IS SADLY BECOMING A PATTERN WITH GAIAM, TAKE A WORKOUT (5YEARS OLD, 1 YEAR OLD) SLAP A NEW COVER AND TITLE ON IT AND RELEASE IT TO THE MASSES.  THIS IS THE LAST GAIAM TITLE WILL PURCHASE WITHOUT SOME DETAILED INFO ON IT, HECK IT MAY JUST BE THE LAST GAIAM TITLE I PURCHASE.",1125964800,71,470,4.258426966292135
2334534,1,B0009XRZBA,"I suppose like everyone else, I picked this up so I could do a little yoga at home.  Nowhere on the cover does it indicate it uses props - blocks, blankets, and a chair that fits to your body dimensions perfectly.  And I don't get the connection at all between this CD and weight loss.  It's good for some relaxation poses/positions, and it almost seems like the actual CD was incorrectly paired with the CD case.  I did not get what I thought I was getting, and I feel like I threw my money away on this product.",1396742400,,513,4.204081632653061
2334535,5,B0009XRZBA,"When i first got this dvd I tried it. and put it away! I was using it for weight loss and thought this isn't going to work.
Recently I took it off my shelf, tried it again and I love it! what I like about it. you use blocks so your not straining yourself
doing the poses, so you can ease into the poses and concentrate on your breathing. After the workout you sit on your
block to relax. you kind of get the yoga buzz. It makes me feel great. I think also this dvd can give you the health benifits
of yoga. which can lead to weight loss. If you looking for something gentle and a feel good workout this is one of them.",1365033600,3,618,3.9126984126984126
2334536,4,B0009XRZBA,This is very easy to do and I feel great after! With being diagnosed with fibromyalgia it helps with being able to stretch and loosen up!,1360454400,,137,4.3076923076923075
2334537,3,B0009XRZBA,"The yoga positions are good, but they are more for relaxation than weight loss.  If you want yoga for relaxation, it is fine.",1359590400,,125,4.434782608695652
2334538,1,B0009XRZBA,"THE GOOD: The audio CD is actually very good. Believe it or not, the audio describes what you are supposed to do in bed to warm up for the day and get going. She tells you when to breathe. I never know if I am supposed to inhale or exhale at will. Uh, the instructor finally told me when you are exerting yourself you inhale and upon relaxation, you exhale. She talks slowly and has a nice voice. So you're not one sequence behind all the time.

THE BAD: For some odd reason, I thought this was a beginners DVD. I bought this about 4 months ago and tried the yoga routine first.  This is a bad idea if you are a beginner because its too hard. And the DVD doesn't tell you props are necessary. If props are needed, I guess that should tell you this is not a beginner's DVD. Please note I have and am taking Yoga classes.

THE EVEN UGLIER: This DVD and the audio CD both skipped e.g. were defective from the get go. Thus far, Amazon has yet to reimburse me for this but keep reading. If you can scandalize the yoga community by getting ONLY the audio CD, this would be good starting point. Or be like me, and settle Pilates for Beginners and Beyond (3 CD set), take the class and forget the useless promises of yoga instructors  and these nearly impossible to perform yoga DVDs.",1326931200,,1276,4.217213114754099
2334539,2,B0009XRZBA,"I agree with the other reviews. This is only AM yoga, and that's what it should be titled or more like ""Yoga for Beginners"". It seems incomplete and inadequate, and I would actually think that even beginners wouldn't take away much from this DVD. It's more like a light workout. There's plenty of other DVDs that are far more helpful. Pass on this.",1316131200,,348,4.5396825396825395
2334540,5,B0009XRZBA,"I love this video. It's just long enough to give you a good work out for your morning before work. Also, the positions are all explained fully and very well.",1310688000,,157,4.266666666666667
2334541,4,B0009XRZBA,"I really don't see how this could possibly be considered a weight loss routine. However, it is a lovely, relaxing way to begin my mornings. I've felt much more relaxed through the day when I've started with this dvd. It's gentle and not terribly challenging, but sometimes that's all I need.",1303171200,,291,4.7254901960784315
2334542,1,B0009XRZBA,"This video is way too easy, and also rather boring. The instructor doesn't safely move from one pose to another, nor does she instruct on correct posture for poses. This would not be a good thing for someone not already familiar with yoga, so if you are a beginner, don't buy this one.

Sadly, I bought the dvd for $10 and I'll be lucky if I can re-sell it for a buck. Pass.",1300406400,,374,4.123287671232877
2334543,3,B0009XRZBA,"The DVD has two pretty short sessions.  The first is some pretty easy poses that are basically light stretching and relaxation.  The DVD says it lasts 30 minutes. She uses the bricks a lot in the first session, which I didn't have so that was a little frustrating at first. The second session is even slower and very much geared toward relaxation which is supposed to be about 20 minutes.  She talks a bit about menstruation and women on cycles which is okay I guess, but maybe I could do without.  She uses a chair a lot for the second session. I was dissappointed at first because I paid about $14 for the DVD and was hoping for more for the money.  But, as a little time has passed, I have appreciated having it for the slower pace lighter stretching and relaxation when I've had a bad day or my neck injury is acting up and I can't do too much.  It is a good beginner tape that anybody can do.  There may be better ones out there with more variety and minutes for the money though. I didn't see the weight loss connection - but she explains that by being relaxed and in touch with your body that you can be in a better position to make healthy choices.  To me and probably others, weight loss means we're going to be more active and this is not the case here - no breaking a sweat with this one!",1293667200,,1299,4.188755020080321
2334544,1,B0009XRZBA,"I am sure Suzanne Deason is a perfectly nice person but man, oh man, does she suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck as a yoga instructor!
I bought this DVD by mistake and now cannot return it.
Seriously, if you're looking for a great beginner yoga DVD, save your money and get The Firm's power yoga (and don't let the title fool you, as it's really 15 minutes of yoga poses that flow nicely and logically and 15 minutes of stretching, yet you WILL get in shape!).
Deason's way of teaching is counter intuitive for the beginner, she does not explain anything in depth, which is hugely important when doing yoga, and the camera angles are so random and illogical that you constantly have to crane your neck to see what she is doing!
That was 15 bucks and 30 minutes I will never get back.
Learn vicariously!
Hope this helps poor unsuspecting souls....
Namaste!",1280707200,,839,4.6
2334545,5,B0009XRZBA,"I find this DVD very effective and highly recommend it to anyone who has a weight problem. Four years ago The Quick Start Yoga For Weightloss exercises helped me to lose - after pregnancy - 30 pounds in six months. I did just this complex of exercises one time every day. After first three weeks of exercise I received the first results and did not stop until I reached the normal weight. I used thick books when I didn't have blocks, effect precisely the same. The exercises are very simple; even if it seems to you it is difficult to repeat for the instructor, don't stop, the road will be passed by the going. With each following practice, you will notice that to be engaged becomes easier. One day you will feel it is boring, but it does not mean that it isn't effective. I can't imagine a weight loss program easier than this one.

I have two other weight loss yoga DVDs, they have much longer sessions and are more difficult, but don't help me for weight loss at all.",1280620800,4,973,4.375690607734807
2334546,4,B0009XRZBA,"Quick Start Yoga for Weight Loss includes a DVD with two programs - a 25-minute gentle yoga practice and a 15-minute energy balancing yoga practice, access to a 64 page online nutrition guide and a 15-minute audio CD to guide you through a morning routine that can be done upon waking right on your bed.

If you believe that the only way to lose weight is through vigorous sweaty exercise, this is not the program for you. However, if you, like Suzanne Deason, believe that stress, moving too fast, and lack of body-mind awareness are major contributors to weight gain, this program can help you get started with a gentle yoga program that can lead to gradual lasting change. Quick Start Yoga for Weight Loss is an easy to learn program with step-by-step instructions and a great way to start your on the right foot - with more energy, clarity, awareness, and focus.  It's these qualities that often lead to healthy behavior changes resulting in weight loss.

The Quick Start Yoga for Weight Loss workout begins with seated breathing and moves into gentle floor stretches that include extended child's pose, low lunge and runners lunge. Many poses are modified with the use of two bricks/blocks so most beginners will find them accessible.

She then moves on to a series of standing poses that include triangle, extended side angle, wide legged lateral spine stretches, and wide legged forward fold with a twist. Floor poses come next and include a gentle modified cobra, downward facing dog, child's pose, seated twists, cobblers pose, an abdominal strengthener, reclining leg stretches, reclining twists, and a gentle bridge pose.

Although Deason, never refers to the poses by name, she provides detailed instruction for alignment and coordinating breath with movement, making this accessible to beginners and those seeking a gentle well balanced yoga routine to begin the day.

The 20-minute Energy Balancing yoga practice is for those times you are feeling stressed or fatigued or need a gentle restorative practice.  It is designed to help you relax, open up and turn within and includes lots of supported forward folds - both standing and seated - and ends with legs-on-a-chair pose. You'll need a chair and blanket for this yoga practice.

The 15-minute audio CD is a great way to wake up your body before you even get up in the morning, with a series of reclining stretches and twists to increase circulation while integrating your mind, body, and breath, all before your feet touch the floor.

I think Quick Start Yoga For Weight Loss is great for beginners looking for an introduction to a gentle mind-body approach to weight loss through yoga.",1235347200,10,2655,4.948314606741573
2334547,1,B0009XRZBA,"I have taken yoga classes before, but never bought a DVD.  I got this DVD, popped it in and realized that I needed bricks.  I do not own any bricks and no where ON the box does it mention bricks are necessary for the workout.  I had to go out and buy the bricks just to do the workout.  The workout itself was alright, though she intros it as an ""A.M."" workout when it doesn't say anything on the DVD itself.  She also doesn't name any of the poses, which is odd and annoying.  I also don't see how it is geared toward weight loss in any way.  All in all, I was very disappointed and do not want to buy anything from Gaiam again.",1234051200,2,629,3.984
2334548,2,B0009XRZBA,"I haven't actually been able to do this workout yet--not because I haven't wanted to because I have, but because YOU NEED TO HAVE YOGA BLOCKS TO DO IT.  I don't have those yoga blocks, so now I have to go pay more $$ for equipment.  It doesn't say anywhere on the DVD that you need any equipment.  It's really, really annoying because you should know what you need before you wake up at 5:30 AM and pop the DVD in thinking you'll get a workout first thing.",1226361600,,456,4.159090909090909
2334549,2,B0009XRZBA,"I just reviewed this program and I had difficulty following along. This is because the the program is so slow and the narrator has such a calming voice that I kept yawning. There is narration throughout the entire program, had the narration stopped, I may have had a minute to calm my mind as the program encourages. This is a relaxing program, almost too relaxing.

The other distraction in this program is the use of bricks, blankets and a chair. The narration focuses a lot of time on these accessories. It would've been nice to have the narration give directions for people who choose to follow along without the accessories.

The overall program devotes a lot of time to holding certain positions and the narration talks through each interval of a position which could be annoying at times. The pace of the programs are a little too slow. Suzanne's look could also be a distraction for some people. I'm still looking for a program that offers more varieties of positions.",1200182400,3,976,4.735294117647059
2334550,1,B0009XRZBA,"I'm overweight, so I bought yoga for weightloss.  Well, right at the beginning of the workout the instructor, who is not overweight, launches into several positions that I cannot do BECAUSE I AM OVERWEIGHT.  I would have to be at close to a normal weight to fit myself into the positions she does.

What's the point?  I thought this might actually have positions I could do.  I ejected the disc five minutes into it and added it to my coaster collection.

Thanks for nothing.",1189641600,3,475,4.595238095238095
2334551,5,B0009XRZBA,"I see a lot of the reviews are about the weight loss portion of this DVD, and I have to say I have not used it much.  However, I REALLY love the yoga techniques to get you going and then even having a monthly practice is really a nice touch.

I have to say I feel a lot of stress relief when I use this DVD program.",1185753600,,315,3.6865671641791047
2334552,4,B0009XRZBA,"This DVD is not meant to be a strenuous aerobic workout. It's a gentle 30 minute quick-start for starting off the day and for those who are new to Deason's programs. She does seem to aim the Energy Balancing portion of the DVD towards women, but most of her work is for women, and men can still benefit from the Energy Balancing too. This program is also good for those planning on taking on the full Yoga for Weight Loss DVD. When starting off and practiced by itself, that program can leave you a bit sore, as I have experienced many times over, so I find this DVD quite valuable. Be warned though, as many have already said, if you already have A.M./P.M. Yoga for Weight Loss, this one won't be necessary.",1164931200,2,708,4.371212121212121
2334553,1,B0009XRZBA,This video is slow and I wouldn't use it for anything but relaxation. It nearly put me to sleep. I can do both workouts and don't feel a thing other than relaxed. I was very disappointed with the quality. The talk about menstral cycles and the aim to talk to women only is disconcerting too. I think they forgot what their video was supposed to be aimed at- weight loss. Wish I could return it!,1154476800,3,394,4.266666666666667
