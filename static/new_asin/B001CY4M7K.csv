8606487,3,B001CY4M7K,This DVD gives you some good ideas about tournament fishing including fishing where the food is but it is mostly walleyes being pulled out of the water and not much in depth information. The bonus features has the tournament scene with other fisherman while the main DVD covers just one person. Most people should already know everything this DVD talks about.,1375142400,,359,4.901639344262295
