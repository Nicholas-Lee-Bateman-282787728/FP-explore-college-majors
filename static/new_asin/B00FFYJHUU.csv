8669289,5,B00FFYJHUU,"Not everybody can really conduct Bruckner,as there are many otherwise fine pianists who lack the touch & grace to play Mozart, or Chopin. In this case we have a piece rarely
performed live in concert, Bruckners Third Symphony. While symphonies 4-9 are heard more often nowadays( with 5 & 6 the least so),1,2, & 3  (+ 0, & 00) are virtually never played live. It is a pity,since this one, more than the previous two,sets the stage, almost as an archetype, for the remainder of his oeuvre.
  My own experience in hearing it performed was within the last year or two. Alan Gilbert,
a reliable conductor of merit, led a version that I found to be problematic. Perhaps he is
a fine conductor of the other Bruckner symphonies (this is the first one Ive heard him
conduct), but in this case the result sounded episodic, the contrasting  dynamics of
the various sections seemed to stand on there own, as if there was a lost focus. To me
it just didn't hold together. I categorized this: Bruckner""s Third; hard piece to pull off live.
  And yet on this dvd (from 2  Munich concerts in 1993), with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, everything held together just fine. With a strong underpull, the various crescendi/decrescendi seemed to grow out of themselves, rising and falling
as naturally as the ocean. The result is a powerful unified performance - one I've
watched several times in the short period that I've owned  it. In Georg Solti""s hands we hear a real masterwork.
  This performance is supplemented on this disc by a very different type of music,
Stravinsky's Symphony in 3 Movements. Less expansive, more terse music that also shifts through several sonorities,and with great ease. This piece is heard in concert
once and a while. Though not in a category with his early masterpieces, I find this to
be a very good piece of music, here again played in a very immediate manner,
with great definition
  So to me, this disc is a big winner. The color video is good but not great, in terms of
any sort of enhanced remastering. Still, I see this disc as such a rare find that I feel compelled to give it a 5 star rating. If someone thinks that this dvd appears to be promising & chooses to buy it, I doubt if they'll be disappointed. More likely elated.
A nod to the great maestro Solti",1413763200,,2289,4.597051597051597
