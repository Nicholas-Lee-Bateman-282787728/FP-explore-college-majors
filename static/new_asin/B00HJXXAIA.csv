If  Lauries rendition of Let Them Talk, doesnt make you a Hugh Laurie fan, nothing will!",1515369600,,297,4.5
8633161,5,B00HJXXAIA,"This DVD first appeared on PBS back in 2011 on their ""Great Performance"" series. It was this program that would make me a fan of Laurie. I had heard of him before this and knew him as a comedian and actor who at that time was starring the in TV series ""House"" although I had even seen him in that show. What I didn't know about him at that time I show this edition of ""Great Performances"" was he could sing and play musical instruments. My love for blues music and especially New Orleans styles blues lead me to watch this and I was blown away!

The show tells of Laurie's love of this style of blues music and a dream of his to go to New Orleans one day to visit the place where this kind of music he loved growing up was born. And that is indeed what takes place during this program. Along the way as Laurie is driving to New Orleans they show him performing with a band at a New Orleans club. And what a band he has backing him up which includes the horn section on loan from New Orleans legend Allen Toussaint. There are a couple of other guests on the program who lend their talent to the show too. Irma Thomas sings a song with Laurie and the band and then truly one of the very best performances during the show has none other then Sir Tom Jones (yes that Tom Jones) singing with Irma and Hugh singing back up.

All though out this program you see and hear the true love Laurie has for this music and his wanting to share with the world this love. But do not think this is just some egotistical actor who has no musical skills trying to inflate his ego by trying to act like he knows what he is doing. Laurie does indeed know what he is doing and he displays that he has in him the talent to sing and play the blues. Whether you love Hugh Laurie or the blues you owe it to yourself to watch this outstanding program. Currently as I am writing this review there are no copies of this DVD available for sale. That is too bad and hopefully there will be some more copies for sale soon. In the meantime for those interested in wanting to see this could try going to the web site for ""Great Performances"". You should be able to watch a video of that show there.",1422316800,,2163,4.111111111111111
