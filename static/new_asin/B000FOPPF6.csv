8170014,5,B000FOPPF6,"Enjoyed this movie, the story, the actors really had charisma and was a great fit.  The director, ingenious, in making a great film on a low budget, and his passion was revealed all over the screen.  I was able to meet some of the actors and the director during one of the festivals in which the film placed highly and am thrilled to this day that I have been able to work with some of the actors since.  John Schwert is an excellent filmmaker and I am looking forward to seeing more of his films.",1300060800,,497,4.2105263157894735

BUY IT NOW! You won't regret it!",1159488000,2,269,4.1923076923076925
