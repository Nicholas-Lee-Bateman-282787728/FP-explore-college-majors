8550209,2,B00ADRYGPA,"John Carradine did better with vampiric fiends than with evil Nazis.  I would probably blame the war (about to turn around on the Axis powers) and because of the tight filmmaking economics it caused and that the company producing this film was Monogram Pictures, this film had a cheesey effect which undercut the menace the word Gestapo was supposed to evoke inside anyone watching it.  With such a cheap budget, maybe Monogram could go ahead and say, ""What the hell, we might as well bust loose  with out ideas with this one.""  It was not to be.  I watched a young boy riding by my window on his bike and said to myself, even he could escape from this Gestapo.""  Perhaps, many did escape from the real Gestapo.  That would have been a feat to film.  Still, this film starred Dean Jagger, one of the finest in the business with a great subtly rubber yet underacting face.  He and Walter Brennan (in another anti-Nazi film HANGMEN ALSO DIE) were both considered the best actors in Hollywood, having acquired more Oscar (supporting actor, I think) nominations than any other.  For this alone this film should be kept alive, shown and discussed for our youth today.",1430611200,,1162,4.651960784313726
8550210,4,B00ADRYGPA,"Targot Lane(Dean Jagger)a forger,is broken out of prison by an unknown gang. They send him to California where he finds the gang that broke him out is a gang of Nazi spies led by MR Martin(John Carradine)and MRE Bergen(Sidney Blackmer)An unknown MR Big is running the organization. The Nazis want Targot to flood the country with bad money. Could targot be an all American boy or another Nazi?",1398470400,,393,4.794117647058823
8550211,2,B00ADRYGPA,"Poorly done anti-German WWII film typical of propaganda films of that period.  Plot was not realistic.  Interesting that the title on the disc and in the film was:  ""No Escape.""  One line of German language by Caradine.  I wonder if Japanese submarines ever delivered German saboteurs?",1384300800,2,285,5.108695652173913
