But since I turned it back into the library, he has asked for it a couple of times.  It has lots of footage of horses.  It describes what's involved in owning a horse as a theme, but it is aimed at young children who don't have horses.  It is a good toddler video.  I give it 3 stars on behalf of my son.  I would give it 5 stars if I were a toddler because I love horses!",1088812800,,548,3.9272727272727272
7952906,2,B00005RJ0C,"My parents bought this movie for me when I was 10 years old and I hated it. It was only half an hour long and most of the movie was just different girls saying, ""I love horses."" The only reason I give it two stars is that it does have a small amount of horse information. However, this is only the very basics of horses. It goes over the pieces of the saddle, how to groom a horse and several points on the horse. Overall it was not a good movie and I do not recomend for anyone to buy it.",1039132800,3,489,3.8514851485148514
