2810103,5,B000P4Q8DY,"I stumbled across the concept of peak oil around two years ago on Matt Savinar's renowned site, [...].  Needless to say, I was numb for weeks, and oil was around [...] bucks a barrel then (it was $[...] as of 7/28, with no sign of dropping).  This movie is the film equivalent of that shocking wake-up call I had, and lays out a clear, convincing case that we're all going to be in serious trouble when the oil runs out, which is likely sooner than later.  If you think that we can change the course of things by switching light bulbs and tooling around in electric cars, this documentary will show you why those efforts, while commendable, are not going to change a thing.  Everyone agrees that the oil is going to run out - they only disagree on when.  This DVD will yank your head out of the sand, and it comes highly recommended.  This isn't entertainment - it's a WAKE UP CALL.  If you have kids, you need to see this right away so you can begin to work on your gameplan for a post-oil world.",1185753600,6,997,4.2712765957446805
2810104,3,B000P4Q8DY,"The most fascinating aspect to A CRUDE AWAKENING is that the film was made not by some left-wing conspiracy theorists with ties to Greenpeace or The World Wildlife Fund, but by two Swiss directors, one (Gelpke) with a background in anthropology, economics, war reporting, and science films, and the other (McCormack) who holds an honors degree in Environmental Policy and Management. These two men know how to make a documentary that looks at both sides of our oil needs and industry while not knocking our addictive behavior towards gasoline. It does lack a few aspects in the end, but holds your attention enough to make the whole watchable.

The focus, as the title suggests, is on our crude oil dependency. We all know oil won't last forever, right? Right? Please tell me you know this. If not, you really need to watch this film. It looks at the boom and bust methodology used in early crude oil finds and how we naively thought (up until the 1970s) that oil/gas would last forever.

The story slashes across socio-economic ground, taking in opinions from specialists in the field to Senators and economists. All of them, without exception, realize that oil isn't going to last much longer. The need to find alternative fuels that are (and here's the key) affordable is on.

The great thing is that these men and women talk about how vital oil and natural gas is to our financial existence, simply because it is so cheap. You just can't find energy this affordable. Fuel cell technology, hydrogen fuels, solar, and many other alternatives are discussed but are exceptionally expensive to produce and market to the general population. No doubt we have a lot of worries coming our way as carbon-based fuels become more and more scarce.

The only lacking aspect in this documentary was that there's very little time given over to these alternative energy methods, and no experts on said same. All of the information comes from experts in the gas industry or those who monitor it. To truly round-out the program I would've liked to have seen specialists in alternative car manufacturing and other items that are undoubtedly headed our way.

Still, this is an insightful documentary to get your hands on. And one to show your kids to get them on-the-ball about what they can do to help decrease our oil addiction.",1183593600,65,2313,4.83080808080808
2810105,5,B000P4Q8DY,"This film is a must-see for everyone in Europe, Asia, North and South America.....and anyone else who lives in a country whose economy is based on oil.  This film scared the crap out of me....probably the scariest film I've ever seen.  I watched it last night and I am already trying to figure out how I will need to adjust my life.  I will be 34 in less than a month and I am pretty convinced now that I will see a worldwide economic collapse before I die.",1181001600,,457,4.170454545454546
2810106,5,B000P4Q8DY,"Stark and sobering but refreshingly intelligent...

Oil is depicted as a ""miracle elixir"" -- an incredibly efficient energy source so cheap it has transformed human civilization, and makes it possible for us to sustain a global population of 6.5 billion people (and projected to reach ten billion this century).

Yet in the big picture the ""oil age"" will be remembered as a mere 200-300 year ""blip"" in human history - a brief orgy of cheap energy.

Much is made of discovering more reserves and expanded production, but these are being absorbed by huge new markets in Asia and Africa and so merely accelerate our dash toward depletion.

This is a limited commodity and when gone we are unlikely to have a good replacement.

Alternate energy sources lack oil's cheap abundance and efficiency.  If we convert to nuclear on a global scale, in addition to hazards of waste disposal, we will shortly deplete the earth's uranium.  Solar and wind power are simply inadequate to the task of replacing petroleum.  Hydrogen and ethanol are expensive and require petroleum to produce. And so it goes...

There is surprisingly little political agenda here, as there seems no obvious solution to the crisis.  It is suggested we might ""soften"" the shock of oil depletion by immediate serious (not token) efforts at conversion to alternate energies.  This may help ""ease"" us out of the oil age -- but at present is too expensive for most people, and the political will is near non-existent on the scale needed.

It is predicted that the immediate future will see increasingly violent military struggles for control of diminishing reserves.  The history of warfare is much older than oil, so oil does not ""cause war"" as the film states - but it seems likely wars will be fought over it (as in Iraq).

The next prediction is darker still -- a cataclysmic implosion of the world's six to ten billion population.

Think about it...  Most people today are concentrated in vast urban areas which produce no food and little water.  These must be shipped in 24/7 via truck, rail, and air on a massive scale.  When that becomes economically unfeasible, a few local farmer's markets will not fix it.  Starvation, disease, and local militias could run rampant until populations are reduced to economically sustainable local levels.  The film does not state this is how the world will depopulate but it seems an obvious scenario.

The film fails to predict a seemingly obvious positive side to all this -- a new oil-free world should help with the global warming.

Bottom line:

The world as we know it is a brief unsustainable period of cheap energy. True or not? This film makes a thought-provoking case... well worth seeing.",1180051200,42,2700,4.885714285714286
2810107,4,B000P4Q8DY,"The way fossil fuels are being used now days, predominantly oil in huge amounts, it is easy to see why it is so precious and getting more and more expensive due to it being non-renewable.  Before examining the finer points deeper in the program, an introduction is offered first about the history of oil and how petroleum and its by-products are utilized in transportation, food production, and manufacturing of hundreds of items.  It seems we use oil for just about everything and it plays a pivotal role in most parts of the world's economy and lifestyle.  And we take it for granted in a huge way.

There was original optimism decades ago that because of huge amounts of oil back then, there was no worry of running out.  In locations such as Venezuela and Azerbaijan, this documentary shows video footage of vast areas in these regions today that are completely deserted after supplies have been exhausted.  All structures (oil platforms, derricks, and buildings) are abandoned wholesale and left in place.  It is almost eerie looking at these places in this condition.

Another aspect of oil is that it can be a catalyst for war.  History has shown this more than once.  An example featured here is an oil rich African country with 2 different ethnic groups.  One group is currently trying to forcefully displace the other in a land grab so they can take over their land and exploit the resources there.  Additionally, even though the program does not admit this outright, it does present compelling evidence to suggest that the invasion of Iraq in 2003 by the United States may have been somewhat motivated by oil reserves in that country.

As far as remaining oil reserves are concerned, no one really knows how much is left in the world and some experts believe the sustainable peak has been exceeded.  Many countries exaggerate their petroleum reserves for political reasons and to protect production quotas.  Supply is outstripped by demand and it is only going to get worse.

Current technology can assist in this crisis but only in a minimal way.  When looking at power sources such as hydrogen, solar, nuclear, wind, ethanol, and bio-mass, the energy created doesn't even compare to the output of oil.  Some estimates say we are still 30 to 50 years away from properly and efficiently utilizing other energy sources.

Due to the expert testimony of many individuals in this program along with the shown evidence regarding the world's oil problems, I found `A Crude Awakening' to be a worthwhile and important documentary.  It sends a very sobering message that the earth is headed for a major energy crisis in the coming decades and it will have a serious global impact.  This is recommended viewing for everyone.",1179619200,3,2726,4.869848156182212
2810108,5,B000P4Q8DY,"If you haven't heard of peak oil, you probably need to educate yourself.  A Crude Awakening lays out the case for peak oil and spells out the problems that will result.  This is a problem that will not go away as we increase consumption as discoveries and production decline.

This documentary is not entertaining.  At times it is dry. Nevertheless that should not deter you from watching this film.  It should serve as a wake up call to the greatest threat to not only our national security, a threat to our survival.",1179014400,,518,4.586956521739131
2810109,5,B000P4Q8DY,"This is a great introduction to the problem that unfortunately most people remain blithely unaware.  There is no part of the global economy that is not crucially dependent on cheap oil, the 'blood of the world' as the opening scene states.  As this film points out, it's not when you run out of oil, it's when you run out of cheap oil.  It doesn't dwell on the doom and gloom very much, it only hits at what is certainly more than possible once we hit 'Hubbert's Peak' (another important idea well explained in the documentary).  And it ends on a hopeful note, an admonition for us to channel our creativity and effort into solving our energy crisis instead of digging ourselves deeper in the hole we've been digging for over a hundred years now.

If you're aware of Peak Oil, get this film and show it to those whom you care about.  If you've never heard of Peak Oil, watch it and learn as much as you can, these issues will become far more important in the coming days.",1178150400,,971,4.396648044692737
2810110,4,B000P4Q8DY,Its scary to think that the world's supply of oil is on the decline and that governments and big companies are fighting over oil fields. This is an inspiring and eye opening documentary that may encourage you to change your lifestyle. Enjoy!,1388966400,,241,4.761904761904762
2810111,1,B000P4Q8DY,"Ya gotta love how hilariously wrong a few short years have proven it to be. Just a bunch of FRACKIN nonsense. As of Nov 2013 America became the leading energy producer of oil in the world. To quote the great philosipher Nelson Muntz, ""HAHA"".",1384992000,3,241,4.5
2810112,1,B000P4Q8DY,"The program was correct that we have to keep making advances with green energy, strive for development of new
energy sources, and reduce our dependency on oil.  However, we aren't running out in 5, 10, 20, or 30 years and we
are progressing toward oil independence rather than dependence on nations like Venezuela, Iraq, etc.

The program spends the first 1/2 hour with doom and gloom projections from 2005.  Virtually every
projection is wildly inaccurate.

Eight years later and the oil shale industry is booming.  The documentary includes video excerpts from mccamey
Texas describing the pump jacks as dinosaurs.  That might be true because, in 2013, McCamey Texas is booming
with horizontal drilling rigs.  Permian Basin (regional around McCamey) has an unemployment rate of 4.0% (august 2013).  In 2013,
North America projects to be a net exporter of oil within five years due to the massive North American shale reserves.",1384214400,6,927,5.133333333333334
2810113,4,B000P4Q8DY,"This is an excellent overview of how we got hooked on oil, the finite reality of our supply, and the challenges of breaking out addiction. My only criticism of the film is that it leaves the viewer feeling somewhat hopeless and helpless.  I hope it might just be priming us for the next messenger with a more inspiring call to action describing how we can move toward a more sustainable energy economy.  And be less greedy.  I'm starting to wonder if it's time to step aside and give women a chance to run things for a while.  And stop exporting our culture -- and greed -- throughout the world.",1382918400,,595,4.431192660550459

2810116,5,B000P4Q8DY,"Whether you believe all that's being said, it should definitely spur some thought about the future.  Though I haven't reviewed every cite in the documentary, there is definitely enough real information that the general public should trust the thought provocation.  For me, it was very insightful and encourages deeper investigation.  That's what a well done documentary should do.",1377216000,2,380,5.517241379310345
2810117,1,B000P4Q8DY,"Is dependency on oil a bad thing?  Yes.  Is the world about to be spun into a cataclysm as oil wells are bound to dry up ""soon""?  No, and while our world does have to pursue a path of stepping away from this form of energy, I feel the documentary is more hand wringing and fear mongering in nature than it is informative.  As with all documentaries, one should always consider the motivation and agenda behind it and right now ""green energy"" strategies commercially available is simply not viable or cost effective.  This will not change so long as people continue to vote along party lines and so long as corporations continue to purchase congressional support, that's where it starts, the anxiety viewers feel from viewing this program and then jump on oil as being evil, need to step back and recognize its 535 people in D.C. that make it all possible, hold them accountable and ""Big Oil"" follows suit.",1376784000,5,905,4.63125

2810119,5,B000P4Q8DY,"The fact that this movie had to be made in such an elementary way, is watering down the facts of the obvious and inevitable (maybe iminent) decline of oil in the future. This movie is high-school level intellectually at best. But oddly, just making the movie and stating the obvious is proabably sadly a brave act. Most people are not aware that fossil fuels(ie.oil) are NON-renewable. By definition, that means the supply is finite. Equally, most people refuse to recylce, re-use or even consciously think about the utilities of the modern world, ie, turning on the faucet or the light switch. I agree with everything the film says, and the range of speakers, from professors, to scientists, politicians, and geo-scientists is impressive.  Just as Hubble was laughed out of politics, this little film will be seen by too few, too late. Given the urgency of the situation, it seems odd that our progress in alternative fuels (hybrid, solar) or conservation measures are minimal. I am assuming that all of us will continue to live life as usual until one day the black flow just stops.",1374019200,2,1084,4.859459459459459

2810121,4,B000P4Q8DY,"Here is a good evaluation of the world's dependence on petroleum, why it is so important, and the inescapable fact that there is not an unlimited supply.

2810122,4,B000P4Q8DY,"the fact is if the oil companies would allow cars to go 100-200 miles per gallon, like can be done with hidden technologies the oil would last much longer.  with all the alternative fuels they can offset this figure.
they have bio fuel cars that can go as much 150 mpg, bio fuels are renewable.  tehy should force everyone to use synthetic oil in the motors, this would help,
make people have more access to solar in their homes, cheaper etc...  various fuel related companies lobby the government to keep things as they are, ban lobbying will help much of this.
I would suggest people to watch the documentary called Thrive, this will give a bigger view of how things work in the world, from curing cancer, to make cheap energy, it will never happen cuz the rich corporations won't allow it, buy up technology, government steals this technology, things go NO where, the economy would loose too many jobs and a ton of industry if things were done the right way, we are a consumer driven society, you don't consume then you aren't a good american!!

2810124,2,B000P4Q8DY,"I didn't do a thorough fact checking, but statements like ""US cities were all built after the invention of the automobile where as European cities were already built by the time the automobile was invented"" are patently false and this film is riddled with them. Also, statements that seem to devine the motivation of presidents and dictators without any material to support them abound in this film. In one segment, a personality I've never heard of insists that US foreign policy in the middle east is to spread democracy to gain control of the oil there ... there not only is no evidence of this ever being true, history is filled with (even very recent) evidence to the contrary. This same personality in the very same segment then goes on to talk about our relationship with Saudi Arabia -- which is an oligarchy we've helped keep in power to the detriment of it's people, and completely contradicts here earlier statement about democracy. It's just a poorly made film. The subject matter is a serious one and it deserves a better treatment than this silly film gives it.",1367020800,2,1075,4.754010695187166

Sobering.....",1365033600,,352,4.603174603174603
2810127,3,B000P4Q8DY,"This movie is essentially a series of interviews with people who have worked in the oil industry. They focus on discussions revolving around ""peak oil"" and how they believe that the world has hit the peak oil point, hence the increase in oil prices. It shows many once productive oil lands sitting barren now. They also believe that governments and world systems would have us believe that there are vast amounts of oil left in the world when in reality, we have probably hit peak oil already and will soon run out of oil. The experts propose that we must start investing in alternative energy sources and live simpler lifestyles else there will be no way to sustain our standard of living. I think they're right.

A couple of caveats to the movie though. First, it is mostly informational. This isn't an entertainment type documentary that we're used to watching now. It is just a series of interviews with some pictures thrown in for good measure. There wasn't much ""on location"" filming. Second, the movie, if I recall correctly (as I was tired and sleepy when I watched it) doesn't mention much, if anything, about oil extracted from deep sea drilling or tar sands. So actually, there may be more oil in the world than what the movie describes, but as far as traditional land oil production, the movie makes clear we are running out.

Watch it if you're concerned about peak oil and the chaos that will ensue if things don't start to change, but I wouldn't exactly call this required watching. It will interest only those who may have a concern for peak oil and its implications.",1365033600,,1583,4.670250896057348

In the Middle East towns have sprung up and . . .  wait, now many many buildings (high rises), homes, and communities are actually short of power. Short as in not even a hint of power: building closed. Not open.  Also, in the UAE and in other Gulf nations they are running to try and develop sustainables.

Take India, China, and their growing populations putting millions of cars a year on the road, and millions of mouths to feed that were not here last year. There must be a cap somewhere. If the infor is wrong, perhaps it is good. I do think however that a shift from the buring of gas and oil may be a nice way to go regardless, but understand there are difficulties.

This documentary is, for me, an excelent video to promote thought and stimulate discussion. I use it with my students, here in the Middle East, and they are very surprised. It is not to scare them, it is again, to provoke thinking and generate interest in searching for solutions should this industry end suddenly. It is one possibility as the video says (probably more off in the distance), but why not contemplate.

I was depressed for three days after watching this, thinking of the hard life my children may be living decades from now.  The producers succeeded in making this a must-watch for everyone to become more energy-conscious but I don't think that the film-makers needed to be so alarmist.  I found their concept of ""peak oil"" to be logical, but it doesn't imply that it will all run out all at once and the authors underestimate the speed at whicn nations like the U.S. could adjust in time of crisis if, in fact, it comes to that.

The commentators lament that solar, biofuels, hybrids, wind etc all have their pitfalls and will not solve the issue.

In my mind one of two things can happen going forward:
- Oil spikes extremely high again, as it seems to be doing.  Input costs rise and so does the incentive to find alternative energy sources.  Finding a solution is expedited.
- We get early warnings that oil is soon to be depleted (cf. Ozone layer) and again there is a massive prize to finding alternatives.

2810148,5,B000P4Q8DY,"Produced in 2006, ""A Crude Awakening: The Oil Crash,"" has been out on DVD since 2007, but, I must admit, I hadn't even known about it till this week.  I had vaguely been aware of, and worried about, Peak Oil for several years, especially after reading a National Geographic article on it and then occasional (but only occasional) brief mentions elsewhere in the mainstream news.  But this riveting documentary really brought home the urgency of the situation.  I watched it three times, and then read the many (fine) reviews here for opinions, background information, and possible counterarguments - of which there were none.

The film's subtitle, ""The Oil Crash,"" is very fitting.  By contrast, the more familiar term ""Peak Oil"" seems misleading and innocuous, merely indicating that half of the world's oil is now gone or soon will be.  As the film shows, our real problem is far worse than that, because oil will therefore get much more expensive than ever before, indeed beyond the price range of many people and even whole societies.  Ironically, we'll also use up that second, increasingly expensive half of the supply much more rapidly than we did the first half, precisely because of the massive industrialization and population explosion which that first half of the supply allowed us.  Those two problems together will surely lead to widespread oil riots and oil wars, and will seriously damage the world's economy.  Hence ""the Oil Crash.""  With more foresight, all of this could have been prevented.  But we are now rapidly running out of time to transition smoothly to alternative energy sources, and only have about a ten-year window left.

The first industrial use of oil occurred in the 1850s, over 150 years ago.  But the production and near-exhaustion of the second half of the oil supply will take far fewer than 150 years - perhaps merely 20 to 30 years.  An increasingly high rate of use, and waste, by the USA, and suddenly now also by China and India with their billions of people, are rapidly depleting the supply.

As more than one expert in the film bitterly notes, oil has long been the cheapest liquid you could buy, costing less than a bottle of water.  What a terrible waste of a precious non-renewable resource.  But its lowly status won't last more than a few more years.  The Cheap Oil Era will soon be over, and that of Scarce and Expensive Oil will begin.

The film also stresses that alternative energy sources - solar, wind, biomass, nuclear, hydrogen, etc. - simply cannot compare with oil as a marvelously efficient, convenient, concentrated energy source.  And they will all take several decades to fully develop anyway. (Still, we must try, and try with all speed, also in order to reduce that ""other"" drawback of oil use - global warming.)

Highlights of this documentary include fascinating 1970s footage of Prof. Hubbert, the ""peak oil"" doomsday prophet of the 1950s, eloquently explaining the sad facts of our oil addiction and limited world supply.

David Goodstein, professor of physics, offers many insightful comments, noting, for example, that the peak period for discovery of U.S. oil was way back in the 1930s, and that peak production of those discoveries occurred about 1970, exactly as Hubbert had predicted in the 50s.

Colin Campbell, a British oil geologist and consultant to Exxon and other companies, notes a terrible irony to the whole production process: ""The [faster] you exploit oil and gas, the sooner it's gone.""  He then notes how that lesson has struck home: ""The British government now admits that it becomes a net [oil] importer by next year [2006]... and that [North Sea oil] is gone by 2020 ... a huge change.""  He also despairs of finding any major new reserves: ""We already have fantastic technology to find oil....""  Yet not much has been found in decades.

Two other grim ""stars"" of the film are rather unexpected but very welcome ones: U.S. Senator Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland, a Republican, and Matt Simmons, an energy investment banker and former advisor to the first President Bush, also Republican.  These two conservative voices are the most convincing of all.  Listening to them, you know the film isn't slanted leftward.  Both men are experts (Bartlett is also a scientist) and both are pessimistic about the world's oil situation and our collective ability to respond to the looming crisis/crash.

Senator Bartlett warns, ""We [the U.S.] use 25% of the world's oil, we're only one person in 22 [= about 5% of the world's population], we have only 2% of the [world's] known reserves of oil.""  Again, ""Not one in 50, not one in 100 of the people in our country have any inkling of the potential problem that we're facing....  There will be very serious economic consequences.""  Again, ""We [need] to have a very vigorous [energy] conservation program.""  Again, ""[The U.S.] imports two-thirds of the [oil] we use - that has to affect your foreign policy.""  And again, ""It's very unlikely that, once we've run down the other side of Hubbert's Peak, we're going to be able to maintain the kind of lifestyles that we now maintain.... It will be impossible.""  And finally, ""In the absence of fossil fuels, how many people can the world support?  Many people believe maybe a billion and a half [to] two billion people.""

The film ends on that question of world population, with other experts agreeing that the population of a post-oil or scarce-oil world will probably have to go down to 1-2 billion.  Unfortunately, in the four years since this 2006 film was made, world population has gone up from about 6.5 billion to about 6.8 billion, and is on track to reach 8 billion by 2025 - practically tomorrow.  If the Scarce & Expensive Oil Era arrives already this decade, with the price of oil going much higher, a leveling off of world population, and even a major reduction in it, may occur much sooner, and much more painfully, than it otherwise would.

Personally, I'd vote today to double the price of gas in the USA in order to keep gas-guzzling cars off the streets and roads for all but important purposes. We also need to expand our rail system greatly, and produce lightweight solar-powered cars (golf cart style) by the millions for purely city driving, especially in the sunny South.  City speed limits could easily be lowered to 20 mph for their better safety.  And who needs those 4,000 pound elephants that so many people drive today?  As for Hummers, I sincerely believe they should be outlawed.  That would be an important symbolic step.  Of course, we also need to ""buy local"" and do a hundred other things to reduce our use and waste of oil, for the sake of future generations.

Please order this DVD for your local library, and talk to friends and even strangers about it.  Call and write your representatives in Congress and urge them to take action.  Thanks!",1274745600,6,6853,4.845360824742268
2810149,5,B000P4Q8DY,"Like some people (George W. Bush comes to mind) describe their life in terms of ""before 9/11 and after 9/11"", in a sense I describe my life as ""before A Crude Awakening, and after A Crude Awakening"".  I've watched a lot of fine movies and DVD's in my life, but I think I have to rate this as the most important one I've watched.  It is not that the message is so novel.  Before I watched the movie, if someone had asked me, ""Will the supply of oil dwindle in the future?"" I would have answered, ""yes"".  It's just that this movie is so well-done, it puts into perspective--and not over-dramatically, either--so well what that ACTUALLY MEANS for the future of humanity, that it very much impacted the way I think about everything--about our past, our present and our future.  I think that everyone who is capable of understanding the contents should watch this movie.  There are plenty of things to ""worry about"", and plenty of ""disaster movies"" to watch, for those who are inclined to worry.  Probably the chief contender for future problems is climate change.  But ""A Crude Awakening"" has topped anything I've watched about climate change, in terms of how I think about where the world is headed.  That's because while climate change is, I believe, already happening and will continue to accelerate, mankind as a whole is likely to feel a major impact from oil shortage, before we feel major impact from climate change.  And the two topics are interrelated of course; the more we burn fossil fuels, the more CO2 we add to the environment.  Anyhow--this movie affected my thinking so much, I personally have gotten more than 20 other people to watch the film.  By comparison I didn't promote ""An Inconvenient Truth"" to anybody, although it was a well-done film.
WATCH THIS MOVIE.  It does not matter what your politics are, you should hear what the speakers have to say about oil.

2810155,5,B000P4Q8DY,"Today is June 12, 2008, and with oil is above $130 per barrel, we have an ideal environment to take in such a documentary as this.  The scenario reminds me of a book called, ""What To Do When Oil Is $200 A Barrel.""  Perhaps by the time you read this, it will be over $200 a barrel.

For this genre, this is a well-produced documentary that combines visual interest with good academic but energizing commentary.  It plays out like a story: from the early discoveries of oil, the oil bonanza in the USA to the peaks in Venezuela, Russian states and Saudi Arabia.

As one watches how peak discovery USA or other early regions yielded to peak production then leading to ultimate decline, you quickly see the model used for calculating ""peak oil"" globally which many experts say is anywhere between 2003 and 2030 (many predicting around the next five years).  The famous, so-called Hubbert's Peak is described by the man himself.

US production started around the 30's but peaked in 70's and has dwindled to a fraction of peak now.  That's apparently what we see now in the giant of giant fields that produce a lion's share - some being pumpued with seawater to maximize output (something normally done when a field is peaking down).  ALL these will eventually follow the model peaking scenario that was seen in USA, Baku and other areas.  North Sea is also peaking apparently if you follow news in EU.

Arguements for being at a peak include the strong and sustained rise in demand, the apparent signs of peaking of the giant fields today and the fact that no fields this big have been discovered in a while (given oil companies have mapped much of the planet).  This doc makes the strong point that huge discoveries are needed just to keep up with current demand - let alone feed growth - since all current fields will eventually decline.

But with price of oil so high, it will and is opening up discovery previously not pursued until crude hit a magic threshold price.  The doc could have presented such supply-side possibiities more clearly to give more balance.  But, this is a compelling documentary that will stimulate your own analysis.  If nothing else, you will probably see just how oil permeates so much of our lives in the products we buy and way we live.  PS:  Some of the best writers on this topic in my opinion are economists who have little direct bias or professional stake in any particular outcome (""A Thousand Barrels a Second"" is a quite good analysis of the situation).",1213228800,7,2488,4.641552511415525

However, according to Popular Science Apr 2008 there are 175 Trillion thats right 175 TRILLION barrels of oil in Tar sands in Canada that they can extract a barrel of oil from for about $20.00 a barrel. Then you have 5 Trillion barrels of oil in OIL Shale in Colo,Wyo & Utah that they can produced a barrel of oil for about $40.00 a barrel. Then theres the Bakken Formation that stretches from Montana to N. Dakota and southern Canada that has 503 billion barrels of oil, then theres 40 or more billion barrels of oil on the Alaskan North Slope. 1/2 to 1/3 of the Gulf hasn't been explored and the present pools are refilling from deeper deposits seeping upward- from where -do you remember the core.
I have a best frined who's brother works on the Gulf oil rigs and he states they've capped off many excellent producing wells- wonder why?

Hearing this from the horse's mouth (and not from environmental activists or green energy advocates) does make the case for the urgency of this problem.

This truly is the major challenge of our generation.  What many people do not realize is that our lives depend on oil not only for energy.  Look around you and realize that all the plastic is made from oil.  The food we eat depends on oil for fertilizers, pesticides, and of course for the fuel to drive tractors, etc.  In fact the ""green revolution"" that made it possible to feed billions more on the same (or comparable) arable surface as in the 50's depends on the availability of cheap oil.  There is still no energy source as cheap or as compact as oil (in terms of energy per gallon--for instance it takes 50% more ethanol than gasoline, by volume, to run a car).

Coverups of reserve declines by many oil producing nations, a lack of viable alternatives, and a lack of time to make an effective transition ring the alarm bell loudly (a bell that has been rung in the past with little previous effect).

The best thing one could do would be to buy this, watch it, and share it with friends and family. Those unprepared for Peak Oil will find themselves in a worsening economic situation.",1191628800,5,567,4.603960396039604
2810173,4,B000P4Q8DY,"A bold and provocative eye opening look at the future of ""our way of life"" on a global proportion as a result of the imminent looming oil crisis confirming the ""survival of the fittest"" human condition our world faces.

The results of the various scientific studies and models are staggering.  They lead us to a better understanding as to why governments and corporations are scrambling ""in a race against time"" to secure the future remaining limited oil resources in the Middle East (Iraq) and Arctic poles.

Yet, it isn't all gloom and doom.  In fact, it is somewhat inspiring and comforting to know that there are brilliant entrepreneurial and scientific ""visionary thinkers"" working towards alternative global methods of energy resources.

But, what is most fascinating is the realization of the urgency and importance of compelling every continent and their respective governments to form a global authoritative organization who's goal is to establish and execute a universal master plan for the equitable contribution and distribution of the various alternative forms of energy that exists on our planet.",1191369600,3,1110,5.284090909090909
2810174,5,B000P4Q8DY,"These Peak Oil documentaries aren't for everyone.  Peak Oil means that half the world's conventional oil has been used and only half is left.  The fight for the remaining oil will be fierce and that oil will become very expensive.

The concept that our present way of life may be seriously in jeapardy is too much for many to grasp or accept.  Crude Awakening is very well done as is End of Suburbia.  The message of both documentaries is essentially the same -- the cheap oil is gone and nothing is going to replace it that will allow our present level or life style to go on.  There will be a lot less driving around in the future, for instance.  End of Suburbia focuses on North America, US and Canada, Crude Awakenings, a german production I believe, focuses on the whole industrial world.  Both DVDs start with how we got into this mess back when oil was first discovered.

The US uses nearly 21 million barrels of oil per day.  That volume is equal to the flow of water over the Niagara Falls in 19 minutes.  Or that's one square mile, four feet deep.  If that square mile were corn, it would produce only 8000 barrels of ethanol in a year.  Presently the world uses one cubic mile of crude oil per year.  The Sears Tower is only 1/4 mile tall.  Estimates are there are only 30-some cubic miles of conventional oil left.  Nothing will replace oil in terms of low cost, concentrated, abundant energy.  When it's gone's it's gone.

And if the world doesn't get it's act together, serious economic collapse is highly possible -- that is the message of Crude Awakenings and End of Suburbia.

Both Crude Awakenings and End of Suburbia are worthy.  For me, there's enough differences in each one that I didn't regret purchasing both.  However, if your budget is limited, you only need one of the two.  Watch it.  Show it to your friends.",1188518400,8,1837,4.5

Hopefully, this documentary ignites the hearts and minds of more creative individuals to join the cause of ensuring a sustainable future. There isn't many negative things I can say about this video. I thought it seemed very factual and seemed pretty unbiased, unlike a lot of media revolving around the same subject matter. There were some disturbing things I was unaware of (like countries claiming to have much larger reserves to ensure they keep a large enough production quota), as well as A LOT of things I think most people are already aware of. The movie had a nice pace, and didn't seem boring at all. It didn't get too technically involved either, anyone can watch it. Also, Philip Glass's musical score that accompanies the movie was very moving. It's certainly worth renting, maybe even purchasing.",1188518400,3,876,4.965986394557823
2810176,5,B000P4Q8DY,"Compelling information that should be widely distributed.  Whether it happens now, in 10 years or 30 years, we can't wait to plan for the end of oil.  That, combined with the damage we are doing to our world is screaming at us to wake up.",1188518400,3,238,4.266666666666667
2810177,5,B000P4Q8DY,"I have read numerous books on the subject, so nothing in the movie was really new to me.  That being said, to someone who is unfamiliar with the subject, this movie will serve as an excellent introduction.

One mistake that many make when thinking of the subject is to concentrate merely on finding a replacement for oil so that life as usual can continue.  The movie mentions (in passing, really) that it was the petroleum-fueled green revolution that led to unprecedented increases in the total human population on the planet.  But consider what happens when cheap oil is no longer available?  How much food will we be able to grow?  Will we be able to feed the 6-billion-plus people that currently live on the planet?  People have given it serious study - many have concluded that the maximum sustainable human population is between 1.5 to 2 billion people.  Bartlett mentions this in passing towards the end of the film, but the full significance of this point could easily be missed if you aren't paying full attention.

There are other cases besides oil where we are using resources in a non-sustainable way.  We are over-fishing the oceans.  We are over-extracting water from underground aquifers in order to grow the food that we currently have.  And in response to high fuel prices, some advocate growing even more corn and turning it into fuel for our SUVs.

There is a final point at the end of this however, and these questions weren't really addressed in the film.  If you dig a little bit into the subject, they come up rather quickly however.  Our economic systems depend upon and for that matter require growth to be healthy.  But as we wind down oil usage, it seems inevitable that the world economy must contract - especially if the human population must also contract at the same time.  But a contracting economy is one that we would consider to be deeply in a depression.  So perhaps another question is whether there is a more suitable economic model that doesn't require constant growth (both in population, and also in the size of the economy).  No current or past economic model meets these requirements, and while there has been some academic thought given to the subject, at this point nobody really knows what such an economy would really look like.

It would be a huge mistake to treat this issue as a left-vs-right type of issue however.  Most of the world has become conditioned to a world where resources are always available for whatever we want to do.  Or that when one resource does run short, we can trivially substitute something else in order to continue on with life as usual.  None of us - neither left or right - have ever had to face anything of this magnitude.",1187222400,,2702,4.690021231422505
2810178,5,B000P4Q8DY,"This outstanding documentary has won many awards, and has been called ""possibly the most important film of the decade.""  Although, there are several other documentaries of the past few years that should be required viewing.
As a film, ""A Crude Awakening"" is brilliantly crafted.  The cinematography and the music are moving.  While the message of the film is of utmost importance.  For years, environmentalists have been advocating for a more sustainable energy system.  In this film, they have their concerns and goals validated by Republican representatives like Roscoe Bartlett, several energy industry investors, and the former head of the CIA - James Woolsey.  While ""Earth First"" and the CIA may seem like strange bedfellows, there appears to be a shared interest in avoiding an amplified global catastrophe that is pulling them in similar directions.  I say ""amplified"" because in many ways, there is already a catastrophe related to oil going on - the megadeath in Iraq, the propping up of dictators, the oil production waste sites in Nigeria and Ecuador, and much else.
As disconcerting as this film is, there are hopeful developments.

Boy, was I ever surprised when I viewed it today!  This documentary is so well done, that I really feel it should be required viewing in all high schools and colleges, and I wish everyone in this country could in fact see it.

Virtually all of the major energy experts, most of whom have written books on Peak Oil, are interviewed in this film, with a multitude of scores of video clips from the past and present, including an interview from the 1970's, with M. King Hubbert (the originator of Hubbert's Peak).

This film shows the power of video documentaries, when they are produced with style, creativity and true expertise. Just about every conceivable concept related to the world's energy use, past, present and future, along with great comments regarding the various alternative possibilities (solar, wind, nuclear, hydrogen, etc.), are illustrated here.

What's more interesting is that some of the guests reveal how seawater injection in some of the largest fields in Saudi Arabia, the North Sea, and other regions accelerates the flow of oil, leading to potentially steeper declines.  In other words, the use of what one speaker called ""super straws"" for oil extraction will boost short-term profits but have serious consequences later one.
For those still wondering about production curves, just look at North Sea oil and USSR field production charts in ""Twilight in the Desert"" by Matthew Simmons or any number of other peak oil books.",1419206400,,850,5.01418439716312
