4009570,5,B002XT40ES,I had been hesitant to watch Indian movies with Ranbir Kapoor because I thought hewould get parts because of his family connections.  I was wonderfully surprised to see he could actually act and dance!!  The story could have been from Ranbir's own life for the character comes from a wealthy family with servants to do everything.  I loved watching the spoiled Sid (Ranbir's role) grow to be a responsible adult.  Little things like frying an egg were huge achievements as he learned to do things himself!  The romance was also refreshing as there was not the sex and immoral theme in so many Hollywood films!  I thoroughly enjoyed the movie!,1403654400,3,642,4.790909090909091
4009571,4,B002XT40ES,I have seen a few of Ranbir Kapoor's films and I like his acting! The movie was funny and taught a few lessons about self reflection!,1403654400,2,133,4.153846153846154
4009572,5,B002XT40ES,"Was recommended to me by a friend, and the movie is a nice one, glad I ordered it. Typical feel-good bollywood drama.",1389744000,2,117,4.363636363636363
4009573,5,B002XT40ES,"Great story about how a friendship can help a spoiled young man turn to a real man. My favorite part is the happy he was when he learn cook a egg. Honestly I love the movie, its different and fresh. The music is good. Kappor performance is so charming and enchanted I became and instant fan.",1384041600,3,291,4.214285714285714
4009574,4,B002XT40ES,"I stayed away from Ranbir Kapoor movies thinking -- oh another one of star kids , this one a great-grand-kid at that , getting into movies because of contacts. I am a Ranbir Kapoor fan now after watching this movie after Saawariya and RiketSinh-Salesman of the year. He is one of the rare talents of Bollywood.

This is a beautiful, clean, romantic and fun movie. Konkana Sen Sharma has acted very well too. City of Mumbai looks beautiful. Supporting cast is strong including Supriya Pathak and Anupam Kher of course,

I did not like the end, it felt rushed and cliched and they both look so awkward together. Also Ranbir's character running back home without any hesitation looked so out of line of the story. Some of the story branches were added with no closure and they were kind of confusing.

Regardless of that, nice surprise -- away from all the loud melodrama or violent action. I would be looking for move movies by Ayan Mukerji.",1360540800,,939,4.644578313253012
4009575,5,B002XT40ES,"WOW! What a HUGE surprise this movie was! The bad description of it put me off for a while, and then finally one night I figured, ""What the heck?"" I was bored, so I decided to give it a try to rent. Now I am buying this movie. It's a movie about self-journey, but it's also a soft romance too. It starts off a little annoying. Spoiled rich brat in college, basically just parties and plays around with his friends. He's very immature, and not taking life seriously at all. He's never had to take responsibility for anything, or work for any of the luxuries he's had his whole life. He's rude and disrespectful to his parents, and selfish. Then he finds out that he failed college. His Dad tells him he needs to get a job, and he throws a fit and leaves home. He goes to a new friends house ( a girl a little older than him, but not by much). He trashes her house. One day, she freaks out, and tells him he needs to shape up. He realizes that he's free-loading, and resolves to do anything it takes to please her. He starts cleaning the house, and learning how to cook, and wash clothes. Slowly he matures, and becomes someone she would be interested in. She suggests he get an internship at the magazine she works for, and he loves it. He's artistic, and a natural photographer. (Which is why working in a classroom or office always bored him before.) Soon, the magazine offers him a full time job. Feeling better, he goes to see his Dad. His Dad offers to allow him to live back home. He goes, and the first night realizes that he misses his friend, because he's in love with her. This is a story about finding yourself, but it's also about love and friendship. And in the words of another great movie; ""Love isn't always fireworks, Sometimes love just comes softly"".",1338163200,14,1768,4.3444108761329305
4009576,4,B002XT40ES,"The titular 'Sid' (Ranbir Kapoor) is easy to dislike in the beginning of this film - so much so it was actually difficult to watch for the first half-hour. He's entitled, lazy, messy, blames his problems on everyone else, and sulks a lot.

When his wealthy father kicks him out for 1) failing his college exams and b) being a weapons-grade ingrate, he turns to his upwardly mobile, independent, mature female friend Aisha (Konkona Sen Sharma) for somewhere to stay. Essentially the film revolves around Sid 'waking up' and finding a direction in life, and his changing relationship with Aisha, who begins to find his newfound sense of purpose surprisingly difficult to accept.

The two leads, Kapoor and Sharma, have great chemistry and inhabit their roles well. (I wonder if Kapoor could identify with this role somewhat due to his family pedigree in the film industry). Of course, the plot is entirely predictable, but that doesn't detract from the enjoyment too much. It's well shot, does a fairly good job of being a postcard for Mumbai, and the soundtrack is serviceable enough.",1302912000,6,1083,4.945054945054945
4009577,4,B002XT40ES,"Wake up Sid is about the youth that is often spent idling around and having fun without any responsibilities. Sid is Sidharth Mehra played by Ranbir Kapoor who is irresponsible and takes nothing seriously and everything for granted. After failing his final year exams Sid gets in to an altercation with his parents and walks out of his home. He finds Konkona Sen Sharma's home to crash in to. She is new to Mumbai and is the polar opposite of Sid. The first half is about Sid and his life. The second half is about Sid Waking up. Konkona Sen supports brilliantly, much was made prior to the film's release about Ranbir and her age difference but that is the plus point of the film. Her scenes when she is frustrated with Ranbir and her interaction with her boss are some of the highlights. Supriya Pathak and Anupam Kher are superb in the role of Ranbirs mom and dad.
Some scenes stand out, the scene when Ranbir comes to vist his mother and they reminisce his childhood through photographs, the long shot scene of Ranbir staying up for Konkona after they have their first fight and the scene with Anupam Kher when Ranbir visits him at his office and talks about his aspirations.
The songs are good- especially Ektaara, although it bears an uncanny resemblance to Chandni Raatein by Partners in Rhyme.
The direction is flawless...Ayan Mukherji has done a great job because simple scenes have been shot interstingly. He is a director to watch out for.
Ranbir Kapoor proves that acting is in his genes and delivers a superb performance.
Rahul Khanna is wasted.
The city of Mumbai looks beautiful.
This may not be Dil Chahta Hai but it is a fine coming of age movie. I gave it four stars 1/18/10",1263772800,5,1692,4.587458745874588
4009578,5,B002XT40ES,"Debutant director Ayan Mukerji uses an adept light touch on this sweet and subtle coming-of-age story, starring Ranbir Kapoor and Konkona Sen Sharma, who endearingly portray two 20-somethings with a lot of growing up to do.

Although Sharma has gotten some prominent roles such as this one, she's underutilized by the industry given her talent--perhaps because many potential male leads don't want their co-star to outperform them. And Sharma does indeed upstage Kapoor, but the imbalance compliments their characters, who are at different stages in life. That's not to say Kapoor doesn't do a commendable job. 'Wake Up Sid' is only his third film and he's well on his way to becoming one of the best in Bollywood.

Sid (Kapoor) is a rich brat, but he's affable enough of the time. After he flunks out of college, his dad gets him a job at the family company and Sid screws that up, too. He behaves more like a preteen than a post-adolescent, which makes his need to change all the more pressing. Aisha (Sharma) is a driven woman, a few years older than Sid, who moves to Mumbai to become a writer. She and Sid meet and immediately click, but instead of falling into bed together--which crosses both their minds--they ease into a comfortable friendship. Aisha gets her own apartment and lands a job at a hip magazine. Sid is impressed by her willingness to face her fears in order to make something of herself, but she isn't yet mature enough to admit that she needs other people--especially someone as shiftless as Sid. Like a kid, he only lives for the moment, which makes him a risky emotional proposition. But his biggest problem is he's never cared about anything enough to work for it. A raison d'tre is something daddy can't buy him--Sid's got to find it on his own, and Aisha provides him with the inspiration to do it.

Sid's interaction with his exceedingly loving and involved parents (Anupam Kher and Supriya Pathak), who spoil him out of tenderness and are genuinely worried about his future, could have easily come off as sappy and clich&eacute;, but instead it's quite affecting. After Sid has a huge blowup with his father, he moves out in a huff and crashes at Aisha's place. Living together isn't easy since Sid has no idea how to take of himself and Aisha won't tolerate his helplessness.

As their friendship deepens, they both learn that everyone doesn't have to follow the same path--to find love or success--and that happiness comes from being true to oneself.

4009698,4,B002XT40ES,"This really is quite a memorable movie, saw it some time ago and had wanted to see it again. It gets better as it goes along. I like both Randhir and Konkona a lot anyway, Anupam Kher always the classic dad. It's a nice friend's, independant young girl story, college kid coming into manhood story, not what you'd call a love story but you can feel the love and that maybe they'll end up together. Nothing blockbuster or 'wow' that I should give it 4 stars, but this 'memorable movie, want to see it again one day' is my star rating criteria, and Indian movies for a westerner like me who loves them can make what would be a fairly ordinary movie for an Indian into a heart-warming and enjoyable to movie for me. The music wasn't Indian really, or more modern Indian, but was a really nice background theme with mellow melodies that gave me unexpected chills a couple of times. Don't blame me if you find it a 3 star but unless you really don't like these kind of sweet movies, I doubt that you'd give it a two or less.",1464912000,,1019,4.284974093264249

I had seen it on recommendation lists for me (Netflix, Amazon, etc) before but hadn't gotten around to seeing it. Recently, I'd been wanting to check out a movie with Ranbir Kapoor since I'd been hearing about him so I finally decided to rent it. I'm glad that I did! Not only did I really enjoy the movie and the story, but I was introduced to Konkona Sen Sharma as well, who I think is a wonderful actress. She and Ranbir do a great job of bringing the story to life of a spoiled brat boy who meets a determined girl striking out on her own and they both learn from each other about what is important in life. The music is also great, including the lilting and catchy ""Iktara"", which is my favorite. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I know other films in this genre that I ""love"" and I don't love this one as much as those, but I do think it's a really good movie.

8383857,2,B002XT40ES,"The story of a rich and lazy, narcissistic spoiled brat, and his miraculous transformation into a hard-working, mature photographer. Such drastic transformation is bound to have secondary effects, e.g., getting the girl. In no way, of course, are fundamental exploitative relations in Indian society ever seen as needing or being capable of similar changes. Thus, a young manservant for the protagonist is being abused just as much before as after all these radical transformations of the young master. The romance itself, however, goes through epic ups and downs, oscillating between the incredible to the nauseating. The high stature of the participants to this story is made clear by the fact that practically one half of the words spoken are in English,",1471219200,,757,5.264462809917355
