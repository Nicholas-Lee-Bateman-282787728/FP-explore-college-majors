Normally, my kids argue over which shows to watch, but when we put this DVD on, they all found something else they liked in the various segments of the show. I think this programming is really well geared to children of all ages and I'd like to see more of it.",1112832000,,385,4.216216216216216

8053994,5,B0007Y3KOM,"These dvd's are fun and creative. My 3 1/2 year old loves to watch the shows. We have repeated the art projects many times. We love the fruit sticks, he enjoys eating them, I love that he develops his fine motor skills, and counting, and since the kids in the show clean up he does too.

The music is fun and easy to learn. I also appreciate the Molly Manners sections. It is always good for children to learn manners.

I'm looking forward to additional dvd's in the series.",1119484800,,474,4.314606741573034

8053999,5,B0007Y3KOM,"Tot-a-Doodle-Do is a wonderful show for children that inspires language learning in a creative and fun manner. The show follows a theme for easy learning and each segment provides an activity on the theme. The activities are terrific! The show has easy to follow art activities for families to do at home, Miss Manners, a cooking lesson, and my favorite: Imagination Station.  But best of all, the music and songs are catchy and fun for all!

This is a great program that focuses on every day manners, imagination, creativity, singing, dancing and even occupations. It's jam-packed with fabulous segments of entertaining songs, dances, art projects and more. He loves to dance and sing with Penny and her Tot-a-Doodle-Do! friends during HOP N BOP. He even asks for healthy snacks while watching the SUPER SNACK segment.  The MOLLY MANNERS and IMAGINATION STATION segments help my child enhance his imagination, communication & socialization skills. Bravo!",1112918400,,572,5.563218390804598
