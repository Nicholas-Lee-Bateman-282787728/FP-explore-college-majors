1071803,1,6305805849,"...I really wanted to like this film. The girls assembled are fabulous, but that's where it ends. The story is neither erotic, nor interesting. All I can say is if I were the director, and I had this  gorgeous cast, I would have stayed up way past midnight to write a script  that was highly charged, erotic and used my talent to their fullest  potential.

Yes Julie is the Bad girl and over the top as always, Shannon is the good girl prostitute who just wants her money back.  Pretty good plot and well acted.  These ladies could hold their own against any A list actress.

1072087,1,6305805849,"Alas, poor Troma! We should all salute Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Hertz for their selfless dedication and their willingness to act as a lightening rod for the insults heaped upon bad cinema! It takes an awful lot of verve to dedicate your life to making and distributing films like ""The Toxic Avenger,"" ""Terror Firmer,"" and this schlock epic, ""Rowdy Girls."" It takes an awful lot of guts to stand up and brag about making and distributing films like ""The Toxic Avenger,"" ""Terror Firmer,"" and this schlock epic, ""Rowdy Girls."" It takes an awful lot of missed lithium treatments to attach your name for all posterity to movies like ""The Toxic Avenger,"" ""Terror Firmer,"" and this schlock epic, ""Rowdy Girls."" Brazen, tacky, shrill, pathetic--all of these terms, and a few better left unsaid in a public forum, apply to Kaufman and company for passing off yet another piece of dreck, another heap of steaming refuse, as a legitimate motion picture. If there is an omniscient, omnipresent deity somewhere in this wide-open universe, that being must surely have a very special fate in store for anyone remotely associated with ""Rowdy Girls.""
Shannon Tweed. Julie Strain. Some blonde with the acting skills of a cow chip. This is the magical triumvirate that makes ""Rowdy Girls"" what it truly aspires to be: silicone enhanced refuse. Cast your mind back, if you dare, to the western part of the United States in the late 19th century. Three women endowed with saucy attitudes, toting firearms, and sporting enough plastic surgery to keep all the cosmetic quacks in Los Angeles in BMWs for a decade embark on a heartfelt mission to survive in a man's world. No mere rubes, these three, oh no. One girl is a prostitute with a plan to head west with a sack of money. Another girl is the lover of a dumb desperado who robs stagecoaches. The third gal is a southern dumbbelle who wishes to go to San Francisco to seek her fortune, whether she is married or not. Hijinks ensue, lots of hijinks. Tweed dresses up as a nun and spews forth a lot of saucy language decidedly risqu for a lady of the church. Strain cracks her bullwhip and swigs tequila. Cow chip girl still cannot act. A grade Z George Strait intermittently appears to move the narrative along with a jingle and a jangle. Somewhere, a message lurks just below the surface, waiting for us to discover its innermost meaning. What is that message? It is a message that differs from viewer to viewer. Some might hear its whisper and remember to call their mother to express their love. Some detect its dulcet tones and may volunteer for charity work. I heard its call and learned to better police my DVD rental habits.
O Tempora! O Mores! Only in this sad world could such a monument to human stupidity rear its ugly head! ""Rowdy Girls"" slouches towards Bethlehem and woe unto those near a movie theater in Bethlehem. Woe unto me for sticking it out until the closing credits of ""Rowdy Girls."" I fear I will always carry the scars horrifically etched on my brain by watching this film. Do not make the same mistake I did; run, run as far and as fast as your feet will carry you away from this film. Read a book, take a stroll through the forest, hug a loved one, pet a dog, or check your navel for lint--do something other than put this DVD in your player. If you love life, you will listen to my sage advice. Remember: Tweed. Strain. Some blonde with the acting skills of a cow chip. What else do I have to say to get you to avoid this movie?
Not content with merely presenting the picture, Troma decided to punch up the DVD release with the usual plethora of extras. Lots of stuff on the goodies screen, from interviews with a topless Strain, trailers for other Troma films, and a tour of Troma's studio. If you have seen a Troma disc in the past, you have a good idea what sorts of extras appear here. Better you should watch the extras and skip the film! That way, you might, just might, emerge from this experience still able to count from one to twenty on your fingers and toes, comb your own hair, and help pick out your clothes in the morning. I think I have done all I can here. It is up to you to take heed and not make the same mistake I made. Please, people love you and don't want anything bad to happen to you!",1076889600,,4268,4.508387096774194
1072088,1,6305805849,"There's an unwritten rule that all movie fans know: If you see the name Shannon Tweed in a movie's credits (she also co-produced this one) the movie will be garbage. Sure, you're guaranteed there'll be scenes of gratuitous nudity, but the movie itself will stink worse than Mickey Rourke after an all night bender.
THE ROWDY GIRLS is basically Troma's attempt to make a soft porn western, as the video slick says ""Careful not to shoot your load!"" Clever.
The plot: A prostitute and an unhappy bride (both Playmates) liberate themselves in the Wild West 1886; but are taken captive by another liberated, big breasted woman (Playmate) and her posse. After that not a lot happens, except this awful country-western balladeer keeps popping up for no discernable reason. ROWDY GIRLS also features the daftest clmactic shootout your'e ever likely to see.
Obviously this is not one of Troma's best, but they have made far worse (like FEMME FONTAINE and DEMENTED DEATH FARM MASSACRE which I also recommend for guys who like big breasts). I just hope (again) there's no sequel in the works. Actually Shannon Tweed's acting is OK in this, which is a big surprise. Still it could have been worse. It could have starred Ron Jeremy and Divine.",1034380800,5,1230,4.8619047619047615
1072089,1,6305805849,"I have to say I was extremely disappointed in this movie. If you buyers out there are expecting to see great sex scenes from 3 former Playboy playmates, don't waste your money here. While I was a little amused at seeing Shannon Tweed nude, the acting in this movie was just horrible. There was no plot and it seemed like the lines to the movie were strung together by a high school play director. Miss Deanna Brooks couldn't act her way out of a shoe box, and what little nudity we see of her isn't enough to hide her acting skills. Her simulated sex scenes were a joke, which are surprising considering she used to be a nude dancer. You couldn't tell it here. I also wasn't impressed with Julie Strain's role as I have definitely seen her in better movies, and this seemed to have been a somewhat less than stellar career move for her. This movie looks like it was put together in less than a day for a shoestring budget. Don't waste your time watching this, and for sure don't buy it. I have a feeling we will be seeing some of these actors in a grocery store checkout line asking us if we want paper or plastic soon.",1006214400,12,1119,4.283018867924528
1072090,2,6305805849,"A very disappointing effort at creating a sexy western action spoof.  The producers put tall former Playmate Of The Year/B-Movie star Shannon Tweed (good girl) and tall former Penthouse Pet of The Year/B-Movie star Julie Strain (bad girl) together in a western setup, and somehow fail to exploit this casting coup.  Next to no face-to-face rivalry between these two, and at times Tweed and Strain seem to be playing in two different films, shooting on two separate sets.  The two might have been paired in a sexy girl/girl scene, or certainly set against each other in a catfight parody of the Old West showdown.  But neither possibility is explored--- haven't the producers learned the true meaning of the word ""Exploitation""?? Film is competently made, but has no real raunchiness or gusto to its concept.  A golden opportunity wasted.",991180800,10,837,5.036231884057971
