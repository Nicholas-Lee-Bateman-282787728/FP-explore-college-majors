7855251,3,6303932312,"Remember Robby Benson when he was an innocent hero? He's made it to the darkside and he is weirdly convincing there. His all american smile and good looks make for an excellent bad guy. Jennifer O'Neill is still someone to get obsessed with and her daughter,played by Lydie Denier, has a dance scene that is off the temperature charts. The performances here are good enough to take you on this sick little journey, frankly,I was surprised. Don't go here unless you can handle the hair on the back of your neck standing up for awhile. This film might be a good shot around halloween or some other time when you can take creepy. By the way, watch for John Agar briefly as the old convict. Remember him when he was married to Shirley Temple and appeared with John Wayne and starred in such sci-fi classics as The Mole People? This movie will not alter the course of history,but it's rather interesting to watch.",1022544000,7,908,4.576687116564417
