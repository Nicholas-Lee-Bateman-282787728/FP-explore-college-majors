I got Ian's World DVD for x-mas, and I laughed out loud when I heard Ian say it, but when I watched the section in the DVD about this stage, I realized that this is a major part of picking a dog. I have always had golden retriever's but we got a yorkshire terrier in December and I wish I had test driven one. LOL ( goldens are much less maintenance but space was an issue )

We Love our ""China"" but I was going crazy with her getting excited and peeing everywhere and the section on learning from rewards and picking an area, she has already shown improvements .... Although I have already watched the DVD twice, and things you would think are basic, it's helped remind me of some of the things I forgot ... I could have used some of these same tricks on my girls as they grew up ... LOL ... Thanks Ian, for helping me keep my sanity ...",1325289600,,922,4.093922651933702
8500223,5,B004AHREU8,"I got married a few years ago.  All of a sudden I had a household full of dogs, not to mention kids!  I didn't have much experience with dogs, or how to train, or even just ""be"" with dogs.  For the first few months nobody was happy.  So, after much research I decided to learn about Ian Dunbar's method.  This instructional video was SO EASY to understand.  It made the world of difference on how I actually viewed my new dogs.  I didn't really know that dogs had hobbies or interests.  I thought they just liked to eat, pee on my carpeting, and drag me around while on their leashes! After I watched this interesting and sweet video, the fun started.  Once I was armed with a new understanding of my dogs, my way of relating to them totally changed. Seriously, within a matter of days everybody had changed.  Of course, it started with me.  (Ok-it started with Dr. Dunbar) But, all I had to do was watch and learn.  Since then, the rewards have been so big.  For all of us in our BIG family!",1323129600,,992,4.268817204301075
8500224,1,B004AHREU8,"I thought I was getting a DVD to help me train my dog. I now know the theory behind Dr. Dunbar's methods, but that's it. This DVD does not teach you how to train in a step by step fashion.

Make your dog sit before you do anything for them, that's  the main just of this video. Waste of money........",1313452800,,300,3.9833333333333334
