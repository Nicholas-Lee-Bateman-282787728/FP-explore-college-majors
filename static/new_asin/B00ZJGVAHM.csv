I am struck by the incredible irony of how little things change and how this ancient drama speaks to the situation in any modern day dictatorship. e.g. Russian under Putin.

Io is played by Tanya Rodina (Miss Ukraine) who sings in a ridiculous cow-spotted bikini ... okay. this didn't work so well but I loved it anyway.",1439683200,2,599,4.445454545454545
