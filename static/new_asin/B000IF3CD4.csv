8145272,1,B000IF3CD4,Being a HUGE Jackass fan when I saw this at the video store I snatched it up and settled in for some hilarity.  What I got was a confusing mish mash of unfunny sketches and a truly disturbing view of Steve-O spiraling towards rock bottom in his apartment (really proud of O for getting the help he needed since then) Over all wouldn't recommend.  The only remotely entertaining bit is Pontius as Jesus.  Definately don't buy and only rent if you are morbidly curious about how bad this movie truly is.,1250726400,,501,4.483516483516484
