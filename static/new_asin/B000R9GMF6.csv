8199598,4,B000R9GMF6,Wonderful movie for family entertainment!  Definitely amusing especially for the younger children who generally love animals in any form.  Miht be a bit boring for adults but worth sitting through for the kids.,1435449600,,210,5.333333333333333

8199601,5,B000R9GMF6,"This one has it all....cute animals, evil villains, an unusual occupation, gorgeous scenery, a lack of huge-name stars (at least, in the UK and the States) so you can just relate to the characters, a good ending...it's a bit dated with 50s era mom and dad roles in the marriage, but much fun otherwise and can lead to some good thoughtful discussion with the younger viewers about everything from wild animals kept as pets to appropriate gender roles to respect for nature.",1406246400,,473,4.780487804878049
8199602,5,B000R9GMF6,"This is a great ""feel good"" movie for the whole family.  I love animal movies and once did raise a baby seal that had been shot in the tail.",1399248000,,140,3.8275862068965516
8199603,3,B000R9GMF6,"A simple childrens tale demonstrating positive and negative aspects of mans relationship to animals. Not always realistic, the movie is entertaining and educational for the younger set. Parents can use the movie as a starting place to discuss the pros and cons of trying to domesticate wild animals and mans responsibility towards those animals.",1249516800,2,345,5.407407407407407
