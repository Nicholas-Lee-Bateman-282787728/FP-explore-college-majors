8706178,4,B00UGQ1J9E,"Overall the picture and sound quality are an improvement over the MGM DVD. Colors really pop on the vector graphics featured thru out the movie. Candle-lit and fire-lit interiors have excellent depth of field and detail. Large shadowy areas appear jet black, not hazy or fuzzy.

Sound is even better. The sound of Snake's leather jacket wrinkling in Howe's office is crisp and satisfying. Snake's detour through Broadway getting clobbered by street people is claustrophobic, terrifying, and effective.

Sets, model sets, and locations all look remarkable.

Escape is not one of my favorite JC movies, but if you like the movie, you will be satisfied with the royal treatment it receives here.

P.S. I bought this Blu-ray for $9.99 new. Why it's priced so high on Amazon, I don't know.",1478390400,6,784,5.007692307692308
