8547146,5,B00A6SZS6C,"Bonanza, season five, volumes one & two will be released on February 12th, 2013. You can order either volume one (18 shows on 5 disks, SRP $34.99)or volume two (16 shows on 4 disks, SRP $34.99)seperately; or, you can order a ""Bundle-Pack"" of the complete season five (the above mentioned bundled together). Again this will be published by CBS-Paramount Home Entertainment. I can't wait to order the ""Bundle-Pack"" from Amazon when they make pre-ordering available (beter sooner than later...please).  Until then, remember the fresh air of the Ponderosa fondly :)
Merry Christmas & Happy New Year !!!
Have fun...JWC II",1352764800,3,616,5.16
