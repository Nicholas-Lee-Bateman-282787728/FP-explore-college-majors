3455137,4,B001ANOKEI,"If you're familiar at all with Russ Meyer's work, you know to expect 1) really big breasts and 2) bizarre filmmaking with strange plots and weird imagery.

As this was Meyer's final feature film, he went out with a bang.

The movie's plot follows a man (Ken Kerr) who is interested in sex only ""beneath the valley""--get it?--and not in the standard kind of way that most women, including his wife (the absolutely incredible Kitten Natividad), really want it. That's the only true plot thread--which is more than some Meyer movies have--and we follow him as both he and his wife try to ""heal"" him of this great psychological handicap.

I can't say enough about the firecracker Natividad, who appears entirely naked--including a scene or two where Kitten's little namesake is on obvious display--basically perpetually. As her husband won't please her the way that she wants, she has sex with basically everybody else in town--not just men. And she appears to be very enthusiastic about it. In 1979 this woman had an incredible body. Things happened in the five or so years between then and her hard-core career (health problems related to her breast augmentation, I think), but at the time of this filming she was probably one of the hottest women on the planet.

We see a lot of a few other women, too, including a melon-breasted Christian radio announcer, and, rather unfortunately, a junk yard  proprietor (you'll understand when you see her). Even more unfortunately, there is A LOT of male nudity in this movie, which is going to turn off most men.

The sex and nudity in these movies nearly always is played for laughs, and of course it is soft-core porn, but even today this is racy stuff--the hardest that Meyer's work ever got.

The single greatest thing about this picture, though, is the phenomenal narration by Stuart Lancaster, written with Meyer's signature verbosity (aided in great part, I think, by Roger Ebert's screenwriting). That makes this must-viewing for any adult who is interested in film history.",1339286400,,2021,4.909090909090909
3455138,3,B001ANOKEI,"The third installment in Russ Meyer's Vixen Trilogy was co-written by Roger Ebert and is concerned with the sexual antics of small town USA.

Beneath the Valley of the Ultravixens holds a special place in film history as the last ever, proper film directed by cult auteur Russ Meyer. It was scripted by critic Roger Ebert under a psuedonym from Meyer's story, but if you're expecting the over the top laughs of Ebert's Beyond the Valley of the Dolls then you may well find this film curiously laugh-free. It takes Meyer's particular style about as far as it would go, and although promising a sequel at the close (""The Jaws of Vixen""), it was the end of the line for its creator, unless you count the video documentary on Pandora Peaks he made about twenty years later.

Narrated by Meyer favorite, Stuart Lancaster, the story of Beneath the Valley of the Ultravixens is about a small town named Small Town USA which, like the big cities, has secrets of its own. Even rural people can have unfulfilled desires that interfere with their regular day to day business. Lamarr Shedd (Ken Kerr) and his lovely lady Lavonia (Kitten Natividad) have a small problem with their sex life. Lamarr likes a sexual position that Lavona finds...shall we say, uncomfortable. Through a series of sexual misadventures with various townsfolk, they try to find a point where they can 'come together'...

The film features all of the things that made Meyer famous: large women, dumb men, scant storylines and memorable dialogue. The standard definition DVD features an interview with star Kitten Natividad and an insightful commentary by the late Russ Meyer.",1336608000,,1636,4.898916967509026

3455140,4,B001ANOKEI,This is a great movie as a tribute to large and natural breasts.  Russ Meyer does a fantastic job addressing this wonderful fetish in his movie now decades old.,1294790400,,160,4.517241379310345

3455142,5,B001ANOKEI,"I have been searching for this movie for many years. This comedy brings back many happy memories for me and my friends. I can't tell you how nice it is to have an ""unedited"" top quality copy of this movie to call my own! I will definitely be buying more movies from this source in the near future.",1284940800,,297,4.137931034482759
3455143,5,B001ANOKEI,"This is a great movie about a young married couple who have a sexual problem -- he can only get excited when he gives it to her ""beneath the valley,"" if you get my gist. They try all kinds of therapies, she becomes a stripper, and she even has wild sex with him after slipping him a mickey; he isn't bright enough to recognize his own wife in the nude, her only disguise being a blond wig! Russ likes his girls BIG, and he later married Navidad, the star of this film. The husband in the film is handsome but dumb as a doorknob - yet funny! For me, Sister Ufalla Roof (sp?), the local radio evangelist tops the show when she saves the day by giving the husband ""solace and succor"" in her radio studio ""live"" on the air. She nearly drowns the poor guy. The gay dentist scene is pretty stupid, I must admit. The scenes that take place where the husband works are funny as heck.

Meyers was famous for being willing to show full frontal nudity on his females, but when it came to the males, he used dildos. In this groundbreaking film he breaks down and gives us a male frontal nudity scene that practically fills the screen! It's so unexpected, it cracks viewers up.

This is a classic! The sequel was never made, unfortunately, despite the notice at the end of the film. ""Up!"" was Meyer's next film. It's funny too but it took me a couple times to get into it. It includes gay sex and an old Nazi who loves to be beaten by a guy while a woman sits on his face, etc. It's really sick but done in a funny way. I highly recommend ""Beneath the Valley ..."" and with lesser enthusiasm, ""Up!"" Have fun you amateur perverts. These were originally X rated, but they are R rated now.",1275955200,,1672,4.238244514106583
3455144,5,B001ANOKEI,"This 1979 movie was co-written, produced, and directed by Russ Meyer.  Stuart Lancaster, credited as the Man from Small Town U.S.A., is the on-camera narrator of the movie.  Early in the movie, Candy Samples appears briefly as the Very Big Blonde.  Like everything else in this movie, she's larger than life.  Lamar Shedd (Ken Kerr) can't satisfy his wife Lavonia (Kitten Natividad), because he can only climax in an unconventional way.  Lavonia, with the aid of a wig and a Mexican accent, becomes a sexy stripper named Lola Langusta.  Lola proceeds to bed down men with more standard sexual tastes.  Lamar is put through a series of cures, culminating with the laying on of hands by a radio faith-healer named Sister Eufaula Roop, played by the super-stacked Anne Marie (67-25-36).  Near the end of the movie, Uschi Digard has a cameo as SuperSoul.  Russ Meyer himself appears at the end of the film to wrap up the movie.  1972 was a watershed year for adult movies, with the release of ""Deep Throat"" and ""Behind The Green Door.""

At the end of this movie, it says to look for the further adventures of Lola Langusta in ""The Jaws Of Vixen.""  Unfortunately, that movie was never made.

3455145,4,B001ANOKEI,"For a true fan of the B-Babe and Bad Movies, this is a keeper.  There are just times when you want to watch a goofball movie with almost no plot and that doesn't take itself seriously.  The frequent boob shots don't hurt it either.",1102636800,,231,4.2272727272727275
3455146,3,B001ANOKEI,"The main character in this movie is Kitten Natividad. She plays

a wife with a strange husband who has a sexual malfunction. This

causes her to play the field. You also have the appearance of a

radio faith healer who deals with Kitten's husband. Also in the

movie is a tough woman who works on a garbage truck. You are also

treated to a blonde with big mammeries. The only reason that I

viewed this movie was because one of our hometown girls Sharon

Hill plays the dental hygeinist who gets it on with Kitten in the

dental chair. Basically this movie is Kitten being Kitten with

the other actresses playing secondary roles.",1098403200,,631,4.513274336283186

On the movie, I first saw this in college, about 30 yrs ago, when i was taking a film class. Viewing of this was optional due to the subject matter, but I was game, and my best-friends-girlfirend wanted to see it with me (:)). Russ Meyer's potentially invented soft porn. His camera angles, and the rapid shifting of the scenes keeps the viewing engaged. That is, if the super-hooters don't draw you in. Check it out.",1410134400,,520,4.371134020618556

8278154,4,B001ANOKEI,"This was Meyer's epitaph.  Even wilder than Super Vixens (with some full frontal nude scenes), it's raunchy but not hard core.  Meyer didn't approve of the hard core stuff.  It's full of Meyer's big-titted, over-sexed women, his over-the-top violence, and crazy humor.  Not for everyone, but if you like the raunchier and more irreverent type of independent cinema, then this is for you.  If you enjoyed Super Vixens, then be sure to add this one to your collection.
