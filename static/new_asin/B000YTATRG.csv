8234064,5,B000YTATRG,"If you, or anyone you know, is a John Cena fan, this is a must have.  My son loves John Cena more than anything. We got ""My Life (Ultimate Fan Edition)"" for him for Christmas.  We could not have gotten him anything better.  It shows John Cena when he was working his way up the ranks and referred to himself as the Prototype. It shows how he got into bodybuilding at a young age.  In addition, it has other well known wrestlers speaking candidly about John Cena.

This is a must have for any John Cena Fan!",1203206400,7,506,4.175257731958763
