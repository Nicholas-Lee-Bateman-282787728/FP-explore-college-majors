3497950,5,B001BSBBG2,"What can I say? Another great Basil Rathbone film, well acted and full of suspense. Already a big fan of anything Sherlock Holmes and was thrilled to see this old classic. The colorization was very well done and the black and white version perfectly restored. As with other Sherlock Holmes films, this is a good one to invite some friends over on a Friday night, order some take out and enjoy! 5 stars!!",1396224000,,403,4.534246575342466
3497951,1,B001BSBBG2,What a waste of time! Very shallow plot and cheap theatrics- clearly made for the movie-desperate of that era. Avoid,1373155200,,116,4.85

3497954,5,B001BSBBG2,"A most excellent movie, and the colorization, although far from Technicolor, is still well done and, in my opinion, adds to the total enjoyment of this old fashioned ""who done it"".

Basil Rathbone has Sherlock Holmes down pat and does him to a ""T"".

This movie is well worth the money spent for it and I recommend it fully.",1252713600,3,323,4.4576271186440675
3497955,5,B001BSBBG2,This is the best restored old movie I've ever purchased.  The technology has come a long way. It looks like a new movie -- the color and sound are great!,1233014400,2,153,4.1
3497956,5,B001BSBBG2,"The Woman in Green continues the work of the superlative detective duo, Basil Rathbone (Holmes) and Nigel Bruce (Watson), as they seek to unravel the secrets behind a string of nefarious murders in London.

This latest DVD version of The Woman in Green is, in my experience, the best available anywhere.  When I look at other versions of the film, I can't help but notice the extremely, extremely poor quality that they universally possess--certainly nothing that you would want to spend good money on.  Washed out, grainy images are the norm, to say nothing of the obviously deficient source material.  Fortunately, this DVD corrects all of those problems by cleaning up and re-mastering the black and white material, resulting in a much crisper, more watch-able image.  Though we're thankful for this restored black and white (included along with the color version), it's really just the groundwork for the superlative colorization, which is the headline feature of this package.  Unlike some of the shoddy colorization work you've seen done before on other classic films, the technology employed by Legend on this DVD is fantastic--it looks as believable as the first generation of true-color films do, which is probably as good as anyone can do with this source material.

All-in-all, fans of Sherlock Holmes, or families wanting to introduce this hero to the younger generation would be well-served by this DVD.",1227657600,2,1416,5.157205240174672

3497992,3,B001BSBBG2,"In The Woman in Green, London is being terrorized by a series of murders of young women which have only one thing in common: each victim's index finger is neatly cut off. Scotland Yard, as usual, is baffled, and, as usual, turns in desperation to Sherlock Holmes.

Though a rather late entry in a series which many feel lapsed in quality through time, The Woman in Green is actually one of the better movies in the Rathbone/Bruce Sherlock Holmes series. Though Holmes's usual police liaison Lestrade is here replaced by the slightly less bumbling Gregson, all of the other expected elements are firmly in place. As with most of the series (except for the initial two, The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes), this film is set in a sort of combination dream period which is half Victorian and half mid-20th century. The flat at 221B Baker Street is particularly atmospheric and Victorian, perhaps in deliberate contrast to the chic modern flat of femme fatale Lydia Marlowe (Hilary Brooke,) where much of the action takes place.

Several things make this film stand out in the series. The puzzle of the murders connected only by a gruesome detail, while so far as I can remember not drawn from any actual Holmes story, has a genuinely Holmesian feel. Bruce's Watson is particularly endearing in his fumbling assistance, and though this is not one of Rathbone's best portrayals of Holmes -- one gets the feeling he's starting to go through the motions this late in the game -- his characterization benefits greatly by for once having a really effective feminine foil: Hilary Brooke as the evil, sophisticated blonde mesmerist proves a credible enemy. Henry Daniell is also very good as a particularly reptilian Moriarty.

The photography is also noteworthy here. The spookiness of the film's theme of hypnotism is reflected in dark lighting and tilted camera angles which almost make The Woman in Green into an expressionist noir film. Because of the interesting cinematography, I'd give it 3 stars, maybe 3 and 1/2 if we could give half stars.

In a nutshell: if you like this series, you are sure to enjoy this film for its combination of elements which you expect in this series with surprising and effective innovations.",1476489600,,2251,4.900262467191601

Movie color and clarity were fine, but the video was very ""jerky"".  Almost made me think they only colorized every so many frames of the video.  At any rate, I would not recommend it because of the video quality.

The film begins at Scotland Yard. The CID is on an important case. The Police Commissioner complains about a series of unsolved murders. No clues found! They call on Sherlock Holmes. Who cut off the right forefinger on those young women? What was the motive? Gregson and Holmes see somebody in the bar. Who is that lady? Holmes wonders what the four victims had in common? Gregson tells of another victim. Sir George Fenwick returns to Miss Morrow, he has forgotten things from last night! A man shows up, he claims to be a witness to Sir Georges activities. Holmes observes a young woman arrive outside; she is the daughter of Sir George. She tells Holmes what she found in the garden. When they return Sir George will not answer any questions. He has a match book in his hand. Sir George withdrew 10,000 before he died. Holmes suspects a clever criminal is behind these deaths.

Dr. Watson gets a call for his services. Was this a trick? Holmes has figures out the scheme, he just needs evidence. Watson goes out to close the window on the house across the street. They catch a sniper! Holmes figures out what caused this: hypnotism. Anything is possible. Holmes and Watson visit the Mesmer House. Hypnotism is used in place of a local or general anesthetic. Dr. Watson doesnt believe in hypnotism. [A comic interlude.] Holmes meets that young woman [as he planned]. Lydia offers him a sedative at her home, and tries to hypnotize him. Will Moriarity trick Holmes into a suicide? Will Watson and Gregson arrive in time? Will there be a sequel? Is Holmes a difficult subject? Yes, of course.

Those who read the short stories about Sherlock Holmes will recognize where parts of this story came from. What was the name of that sedative? This story is like a stage-play in its static locations. Yes, it had a low budget.",1402444800,,1850,4.651376146788991
