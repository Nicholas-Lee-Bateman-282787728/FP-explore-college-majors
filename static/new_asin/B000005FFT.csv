One must know that all characters in the movie are not sophisticated, they all live in favelas and have a lot of problems because they don't know how to live better.
Despite all the violence and sad way of life, there is sensible side of the story. Some people may not like it because it is not a dreamy movie but it does not make it a bad movie. On the other hand as with all foreign movies, translation is not as good as the original language, therefore it may not make sense to a lot of viewers. The movie, to my taste is very good.",1061424000,,656,4.173228346456693
7903356,1,B000005FFT,"i rented this movie based on a recommendation from one of my co-workers who, just like me, is into lesser-known movies...i suppose that this movie is a ""gritty"" ""bonnie-n-clyde' type story, but the story about the skeletal prostitute and her lover failed to keep my attention, and frankly halfway through the film i a) wasn't able to relate to any of the characters on a personal level, and b) didn't care if any of the characters lived or died...in general, a REALLY BAD movie ...",1026345600,,481,4.670588235294118
7903357,4,B000005FFT,"A girl in Rio de Janeiro, estranged from her bullying detective father, falls in love with a boy. She works in a strip club. He has an angelic face and heavenly body, but is also a cold-blooded sociopath. To complicate matters, the boy's crimes are being investigated by the girl's very nasty and hypocritical father.

This little Brazilian gem -- with all its flaws and faults -- is a powerful film. It looks life, with all its brutality and injustice, right in the face. Despite their being kicked around by life and the police, the two naive lovers try to make a life together against all odds. It's a wild dream, though, and she knows it. But one feels her dilemma. It's impossible not to love this beautiful and seductive outlaw.

Theirs is a story worth of Greek tragedy.",958780800,,777,4.58273381294964
