8482363,1,B0058DGWSI,"I am sorry to admit that i cannot make any sense of the editorial review.
Is it a history of judaism? No
Does it contain any relevant information to the blu ray disc or its musical content? No
Is there an ode to jewish freedom by Ludwig von Beethoven? No
The only hits you get on search engines for this are the amazon links for this disc.
Oh wait, it is a new trick by Alexander Jero, the recording artist whom you can admire in a sleeveless shirt on the disc cover, so he can attack any bad reviewer by making him into an antisemit.
Pls take the time to read through the comments of the 1 star reviews and find out for yourselves.",1309737600,6,632,4.104838709677419
