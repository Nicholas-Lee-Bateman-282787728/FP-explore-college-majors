4517989,5,B0050QNO2U,Great family who is loving and truely cares about their family. Riveting season with the move to Las Vegas in order to keep them together. It takes a lot to pickup and just go. Series was good and I wish them nothing but the best for their family. They have morales and values and have instilled them in their children which is very evident. You just don't find religious family today like theirs whole instill the values and morales God wants us all to have. Best of luck to their family.,1306368000,6,489,4.384615384615385
4517990,1,B0050QNO2U,"Somehow I never expected to be bored witless by a reality show about a polygamous family. But sadly, that is exactly what happened in ""Sister Wives Season 2 - Volume 1,"" which is basically all about the Brown family ""coming out"" as polygamists, and their day-to-day lives. Sadly, without the tension of a forthcoming new wife, their day-to-day life is devastatingly boring -- we have an entire episode devoted to a COLONOSCOPY.

The season opens with Kody, Meri, Janelle, Christine and Robyn all going to New York, and officially coming out as polygamists on a news show. Unsurprisingly, having a reality show about polygamy attracts the paparazzi, who start lurking around their home and watching their kids.

And even though it's common knowledge that polygamy is illegal, and they have mentioned many times how they had to ""hide"" it in the past, they are simply SHOCKED when the state starts investigating them because they revealed it ON TV! I can't tell whether the Browns are depicting themselves as naive or stupid, because it honestly sounds like they're going for both. Yes, polygamy is illegal, you knew that, so why is it shocking when the government investigates you?

While all this is going on, the Browns also continue their everyday life, and take a vacation to Montana, where Kody's family owns a ranch. After some car woes, they make it there in time to deal with horses, cookouts, and painting. We also encounter Kody's father, who is also a polygamist: he's married to Kody's mom... AND Janelle's mom. Wow. So Kody is his own stepbrother-in-law. Ew.

Unfortunately, the rest of the half-season isn't NEARLY as interesting. Janelle and Kody go on a private camping trip while Robyn whines about finances, the family goes trick-or-treating and selects Halloween pumpkins, some of the family heads to Vegas for some fun, the Browns throw a dinner party for some of their non-polygamous friends, and Meri goes in for a colonoscopy to check for polyps.

One of the main reasons people tuned in to the first season of ""Sister Wives"" was because of the underlying tension in the five-way relationship. That tension is completely gone now. Instead the Browns whine occasionally about how the Mean Ol' State is investigating them, and how the paparazzi are following them. Apparently they thought that a REALITY SHOW about polygamy would attract ratings, but no other attention.

And honestly, it's boring. Really boring. The Browns may have a happy, normal day-to-day life, but ""happy"" and ""normal"" do not equal good television -- it's like watching somebody's home movies that somehow ended up on TV. Face-painting, buying in bulk, setting up tents and getting colonoscopies are not exactly the stuff of riveting television, and that is all basically ALL this half-season is about.

And while Robyn informs us that polygamy ""isn't all about child brides,"" I was left wishing that the Browns would actually address that real-life problem. It would be more interesting than watching Kody spray-paint his hair.

As for the family itself, Kody is still a rather spoiled child-man who doesn't seem to realize how tight the family finances are. Robyn is still neurotic and weepy, while Janelle, Christine and Meri form the actual center of the family. But the occasional touching moment -- such as the adults contemplating how Meri's almost-grown daughter would be cared for if she died -- really doesn't overcome the boredom.

Apparently Discovery thinks that polygamists doing ANYTHING makes for riveting TV, and the result is ""Sister Wives Season 2 - Volume 1."" Guess what: not riveting, not interesting, not fun.",1305936000,18,3623,5.045150501672241
4517991,5,B0050QNO2U,I love this family.  Who are we to judge them?  They are happy and doing what they love.  They have opened their lives for all of us to explore this lifestyle and I would give them all a high five and a hug if I could.  Good for them!,1301616000,,234,3.7142857142857144
4517992,3,B0050QNO2U,"First, before I begin, I wanted to sate that I am of the LDS or Mormon faith.  So obviously I don't really believe in this type of marriage although I don't judge anyone by their actions or who they are because it's not in my place to do so.

When first watching one of the episodes of Sister Wifes, I was first kind of brought off gaurd on how everything played out between the wifes and the husband.  When growing up with a family buit on monogamy, most of us would find this not just weird but also interesting.  Though I might of wanted to turn the channel, I couldn't help how fasinated I was on the concept of plural marraige.  Though I would never want to go down that road myself, still it left me feeling interested about the concept the more I watched.

Although the family seems to get along for the most part of the first season, one can't escape the feeling that in some episodes it might look like things are falling apart.  Especially with the first wife he married.  Though you can tell she still loves him, part of me thinks she wants more from him.  This is the one with only one child and I kind of feel for her and understand why she feels the way she does.

Although this series is somewhat fun to watch and to see how the kids react to certain things, one cannot aford to look past the tension that sometimes pokes his ugly head out.  But what can you do when you decide to marry into a polygamous marraige?",1296172800,5,1429,4.216911764705882
4517993,2,B0050QNO2U,"There are reality shows for minor celebrities, musicians, tattoo artists, rich brats, people with huge families, lesbians, superheroes, and presidential wannabes.

And with ""Sister Wives Season 1,"" you can add polygamists (or rather, polygynists) to the long list of slightly-off-the-norm people who have put themselves on reality TV. And while this show initially seems like an interesting glimpse into a family with, um, unconventional marriage habits, it starts getting disturbing and creepy as we see more of the family patriarch.

That would be Kody Brown, who belongs to a sect that splintered off the Mormon Church about a century ago (they share many of the tenets, but still practice polgamy). He lives in an enormous house with his three wives -- bubbly Christine, down-to-earth Meri, and earth-mama Janelle -- and their vast brood of children.

Over the course of the show, a few subplots crop up. Kody courts and becomes engaged to the weepy Robyn. Christine gives birth to her sixth baby, Truely. And as the family prepares for a new wedding, Kody's obvious favoritism makes some waves among his other wives -- especially when he takes Robyn on an 11-day California honeymoon.

I don't support polygamy, but I made my best effort to go into ""Sister Wives"" with an open mind, since I know that some people can make unconventional lifestyles work for them. And ""Sister Wives"" does live up to its name, since Janelle, Meri and Christine are all likable women who have a strong bond of trust, love and honesty with one another. It's also fascinating to see how the children in such a lifestyle turn out, and the attitudes they have.

But after a few episodes, the cracks in the ""plig"" lifestyle start to show. The biggest problem is Kody. This guy is CREEPY. While he presents himself as a good ol' country boy with lots of love to spread around, he comes across as very controlling and insensitive. Whenever one of the wives speaks of their life in a less-than-effusive manner, he fixes his icy, beady eyes on them and just STARES coldly.

To make matters worse, he's a huge hypocrite (he claims the idea of a woman with two sex partners is ""vulgar,"" ""sickening"" and ""wrong to God and nature""), hugely insensitive, neglects his three wives in favor of a skinny young woman, and seems intent on keeping his wives stuck to him with repeated pregnancies.

Here's an example: When Meri (who wants a college degree) tearfully admits that her only daughter is the only thing keeping her married, you can see the gears turning in his head: ""Oooh, I better knock her up so she doesn't leave me when the kid goes off to the Naval Academy."" Sure enough, a few episodes later he tries to convince her to have in vitro fertilization, and is upset when she says no.

And as likable as the three main women are, it's kind of disturbing to hear them dismissing their own feelings, the downsides of polygamy, and Kody's insensitivity. They make so many excuses (oh, Robyn ""needs"" a week and a half honeymoon and a huge wedding) that you just want to hammer on the TV screen and shout, ""Grow a backbone and stop making excuses, ladies!""

""Sister Wives Season 1"" is a twofold enlightenment -- it gives you insights into the dynamics and family life of the ""sister wives,"" but it also shows you the misogyny and creepiness that often squats in the middle of their family.",1293321600,58,3362,4.753001715265866
4517994,5,B0050QNO2U,"This show is one of my guilty pleasures.  I decide3d to go back and watch again from the beginning.  I think in some od way this is a great study in human behavior and prejudice. I just love Amazon.  Before Amazon, everything I needed would have been a trip to a different store.  Now, if I need something  just about anything, I go and look at Amazon first. Its amazing that I can buy everything from  Its amazing that I can buy everything from cereal, dog food, nail products, clothing, household items and electronics.  Along those lines, buying this video is just another example of the wonder that is Amazon.  I have been very impressed with the huuuge selection on Amazon.  I don't think there is anything that you cant buy on Amazon, short of perishable foods.  Most of the time you can the items cheaper than you can in the local store, but not always. Then we have the additional spectacular invention that is Amazon prime.  This praise and rant doesnt mean that I think Amazon is perfect, and I have had a few problems here and there, but over all  Amazon is my go to place for everything I need to buy, except groceries.

4518015,4,B0050QNO2U,"Interesting perspective. Insightful in many ways. Really initially thought this was another stupid reality show, but it has merit. Today with so many society challenges, esp. With raising a family, the focus of the ""sister wives"" appears to be the family. The ""stigma"" attached to polygamy  may be justly correct if it is an abusive, confining, controlling life style.
In this particular case, a balance appears to be in place, in most situations. 4 hormonal women living together, with all the regular life stresses, certainly has to be a challenge. Can't all be about sex!
Still unclear how they finance their life style. It doesn't appear that they are on welfare or state assistance. Is this family to be commended or condemned?",1393286400,,732,5.0

It amazes me because they're always crying about their finances but now they're living in four separate, beautiful houses in Las Vegas which can't be cheap.  They never say anything about what or how much the Network pays them for airing their entire family life...this in itself is interesting.  I think this family enjoys the attention...it's a shame though that they involve their children in the exposure which I'm sure is not always positive.

The children are like his Legacy. He hasn't really contributed anything to society other than douche-hair and polygamy, but he can pop em out like an assembly line and say ""Ahh... my babies."" Duhh. The Taxpayers thank you.

4518076,5,B0050QNO2U,"I am enjoying this series. Although I am a mainstream Latter Day Saint who does not believe in that practice, it is refreshing to see plural marriage by those who do depicted in a non-demeaning manner.
Although these people are NOT accepted as members of the LDS Church, it allows the world at large to view individuals who are normal in every manner other than their  practice of  this principal to which they have sincere belief.

The women are not subjugated automatons but women of character whose religious beliefs and personalities embrace a lifestyle which is illegal however acceptable to them. It works well for them and their children.
If all polygamy could be practiced in this manner, without coercion,  or welfare fraud, it might be a solution to the many children being raised without righteous male influence and without  a loving family environment.

The reason I gave the series only 4 stars was because it infers most polygamous relationships are like the Browns and gives a free hand to the deplorable practices of other polygamists who live in secluded cults.
Although there are many practicing polygamists, I doubt it is commonly practiced in the way the Browns practice it.
My fear is that the show will strengthen the practice at large when the Browns are not typical of the members of secluded groups where the deplorable travesties are so common.",1371772800,,1371,4.913419913419913

But Cody is a creep, he seems like man child that can't decide which toy to play with today.  He doesn't seem to really contribute to the workings of the family, and he is really creepy and a bit of a photo bomb when it comes to other people, he is constantly waving or jumping into a scene so that you know he's there.",1361491200,6,512,4.257731958762887
4518096,4,B0050QNO2U,"Now how in the world would I ever know that??  Actually I had seen most of the episodes when they were first aired on TLC but watched it again to try to unravel the mystery:  how three - now four - women could stand being around and love a man who loved other women.  Kody says at the beginning, ""Love should be multiplied, not divided"".  Interesting quote from a man who divides his love amongst four women because let's face it, Kody:  there's only so much of you to go around and every one of your wives wants to spend more time with you.  You're basically a sperm donor and the women whom you impregnate end up raising the children.  Your entire focus is on your wives and at least from what one can tell from the series, you engage little with your own children.  I love it when Madison, Janelle's daughter, says she'd scratch out the eyes of another woman who wanted to marry her husband.  Way to go, Madison!  But season 2 is a lot about migration as the Browns eventually head for Vegas.  I still to this day don't understand why the Browns went public but they did so consequences ensue.  It's like they forgot bigamy was outlawed in Utah.  I did give it four stars because I like the women.  They irritate me with their rationalizations about this 'lifestyle' but one can see that they (especially Janelle) are bright, intelligent, lovable women who are very good moms and just plain good people.",1361232000,5,1406,4.44140625

4518104,5,B0050QNO2U,"While the show ""big love"" got big audiences, the drama and over-the-top events were very unrealistic.  This show displays a mostly happy family, with ups and some downs and the normal events they go through day to day. We see how having 4 wives in the family makes things both more complex and sometimes more fun.

First the good news - they do not preach their Mormon (ex-mormom) beliefs at you, or try to tell you their lifestyle is right for everyone. They are just good hearted people who seem to really love each other and have some unique triumphs and trials in an otherwise normal life. And unlike most shows that immediately (and foolishly) try to associate poly with various other problems, like forced marriages of some 14-year old girl to her 50 year old uncle etc, this show lets us see what marriage is like when everyone is in the marriage by choice, with love, and there just happens to be more than one wife.

Some of the interesting things include the friendships and relationships between the wives; they seem to really care for each other and make the family work, and help Cody to make good decisions when he might not without their persuasion. They face some people who are immediately bigoted about their lifestyle, but most people seem to like them all after the initial momentary surprise of finding out there is more than one wife in the family; this never ceases to be amusing.

There is no sex or discussion of sex in this show. This is a pretty clean show you would be fine letting your kids watch with you if you aren't afraid to expose them to some other ways of life. They maintain their Christian ethics in their personal life and in the show.

The bad. The producers use bumpers and cut-scenes in such a way as to make you think that someone is about to divorce the family or some other tragedy is about to strike, then when the actual footage is shown in full you realize they fooled you. Just stop that! The show's characters are interesting and the show is plenty engaging without resorting to trickery to keep us tuned in.

In conclusion - holds your interest, the people are good and you soon care about them and find yourself rooting for them.  A very good show as reality shows go. If you're looking for a shocking expos on polygamy and how we should hate them, this is not the show you're looking for.  But if you're open to seeing a mostly positive but realistic look at poly, this is a really fascinating show.",1349913600,4,2453,4.496629213483146

Plural marriage is a strange concept in America, but it works in many cultures and the linch-pin is commitment to the whole family, by all adults.  Having multiple wives addresses a basic instinct in men that most cultures try to regulate via the monogamous marriage.  This is not casual sex, unleashed and uncommitted. Quite the opposite, this requires a tremendous commitment, while allowing for individual space.",1333324800,,532,5.103448275862069

There is something about watching a lifestyle so very different than most, that keeps a viewer captivated. This season is more about day to day life, though it does include the threat of the authorities since the Browns ""came out"". My biggest complaint, I guess, is that all of us non-polygamist have no idea what plural marriage is supposed to achieve. Kody and his wives talk about ""the faith"", but that's simply how it's addressed and never delved into. I think there are probably a lot of viewers out there like me that would like to know a little more. One of the wives, Janelle, talked her mom into polygamy years ago, and she married Kody's dad, so she is a sister wife to Kody's mom. Big question: WHY?

They have good days, bad days, ups and downs, financial difficulties, etc. Polygamy has had a lot of bad press; about time people realize that not all poly families are perverted, twisted, and otherwise strange. They are just like other families, only happy, and have a good support system. They know where their children are, and who is caring for them. Get past the stereotype created by the news media. Read your bible. God never condemned polygamy; it is documented throughout the bible.",1314489600,5,734,4.78740157480315
