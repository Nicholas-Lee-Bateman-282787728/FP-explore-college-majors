8685905,1,B00OZTVWTK,Memphis is a very abstract documentary. I found this documentary to be very difficult to follow. It was not interesting and I could no longer watch. I would like a refund.,1422489600,,171,4.548387096774194
8685906,5,B00OZTVWTK,"Man...Willis Earl Beal...I'd like to think this film is a look inside the man and his process, the environment he draws off of. I guess my only gripe about this film is I wish it had more of his music in it. I've seen him live and if you ever get a shot you should definitely take it because this guy can definitely put on a show and when you walk away you aren't absolutely certain you didn't just get saved along with everyone else in the crowd. This film has some depth to it that's going to take a few more viewings. There's definitely some space in between the moments but if you're really listening they're far from empty. Walking away from this I just have to wonder how much of this is real and how much is fiction. You really feel the artists frustration and uncertainty and absolute certainty. I thoroughly enjoyed this film.",1421539200,2,835,4.358974358974359
8685907,3,B00OZTVWTK,"The trailer and the opening scene of this movie piqued my interest with talk about the shamanic aspects of an artist creating music. Sadly, the rest of the movie was a noble effort but didn't live up to that promise.",1418428800,3,216,4.425
