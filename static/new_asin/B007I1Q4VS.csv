8517099,5,B007I1Q4VS,"I couldn't believe when I ordered this that it was 3 discs and over 5 hours!! I thought it was some sort of mistake for the price. I was thrilled to learn it was not a mistake, and my son loves it!!!",1451260800,,199,3.761904761904762
8517100,2,B007I1Q4VS,"I ordered and was charged for ""The Magic School Bus: Blast Off From Space to Sea"".  I received ""The Magic School Bus:  Field Trip Fun and Games"".  I don't mind getting the wrong DVD set because I debated which of the two I wanted, but I DO mind paying more for the wrong DVD.  The DVD I paid for is $2.46 more than the DVD I received.  It's not worth the price difference to return the DVD, but I do wish my account would be credited the difference.",1423612800,,449,4.056818181818182

8517103,5,B007I1Q4VS,"I watched a few episodes of this show when it still aired, and even though it was aimed at a younger audience (I was a teenager at the time), I remembered it being fun enough that I thought our 3-year old daughter would enjoy it. She simply LOVES this show!

The length is perfect (about 25 minutes per episode), and the characters are a good range of nationalities and personalities. Ms Frizzle is the teacher we all wish we had, and the humour in the show keeps even my husband and me amused (especially the last segment of the show, featuring The Producer). Quite a lot of accurate information is presented in an easy-to-understand and very attention-capturing manner.

I particularly like that this dvd offers the shows in English and Spanish, as we are raising our daughter to be bi-lingual and it is often difficult finding shows in Spanish. The Spanish-speakers are definitely native speakers; for someone who is trying to learn Spanish, it may be a bit too fast-paced, but as fluent speakers, my husband and I were thrilled.

Definitely a great buy!",1365724800,,1057,4.733695652173913
