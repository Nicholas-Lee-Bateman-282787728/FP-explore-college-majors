You can sense the flop sweat by Lucy's obnoxious habit of pushing and shoving people around, so desperate for laffs ...

Another unmistakable stinkburger alert: The frantic canned laughter machine. It rolled along non-stop throughout, heading for overuse meltdown. Sad, considering Lucy's best efforts of the past ...

Worst of all is Ida Lupino. She sweeps around the set in full movie star drag, calling everyone ""darling,"" brandishing fur coats and sun glasses - at night! - so relieved to be slumming in the woods, away from her adoring public ...
