8335394,5,B001QD11IU,"I've never seen the Lion King 2 or the Sing Along but my 2 yr old daughter just loved them.  The sing along was also better than I thought.  It included Aladdin, Little Mermaid, and other popular songs that, even though she's never the movies before-loved the songs.  I originally thought the sing along video was only going to be Lion King songs, but that's not the case.  I think it has 2 or so, just an FYI.",1256601600,,410,4.217948717948718
