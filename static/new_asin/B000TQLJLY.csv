8641231,1,B000TQLJLY,"I ordered this DVD and another ""Fireman Sam"" DVD.  Neither one of them work.  Could not get them to work on any player.  I did let amazon and the shipper know.  But in all fairness I just could not find the time to get them sent back.  This time of year is extremely busy.  I take full responsibility for not returning them.  But I want others to know that that these two DVD's did not work.  Everything else I have ordered from amazon have been excellent.  Prompt shipping, and arriving in excellent condition.  Thanks Amazon!",1386374400,,527,4.4526315789473685
