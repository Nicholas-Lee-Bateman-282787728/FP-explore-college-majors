8458123,5,B0055DXRCU,My 5th graders loooove this video. The accents are great and teaches basic vocabulary. I am glad Mr. Language tree it not featured anymore. He was quite weird.,1377216000,8,159,4.714285714285714
8458124,5,B0055DXRCU,"I bought Language Tree's Spanish for Kids beginning Level 1 Volumes 1 and 2 for my nephew last year.  He truly enjoyed them and started incorporating basic Spanish phrases into conversation when he would come and visit.  Recently I purchase their Spanish Intermediate Vol. 1 and we watched it together.  This video is really good, as they are teaching specific phrases. what you are watching is further exemplified by very succinct graphics.  It is so easy to follow and understand what you are seeing and hearing.  Specifically my nephew enjoys playing the bonus section and interactive games as well as the terrific songs.  Big thumbs up on this production!  Can't wait for Vol. 2.",1310083200,14,683,4.93859649122807
