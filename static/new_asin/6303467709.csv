7849059,5,6303467709,"Chances are, if you are a fan of comics and cartoons, you've at least heard of The Tick, the bumbling blue superhero and his hilarious adventures against evil in the city known as... The City. In the first episode, The Tick arrives in The City and finds a sidekick in Arthur, an accountant who wears a flying moth costume. After meeting with some of the other local superheroes, the duo find themselves tracking The Idea Men, criminal masterminds who wear masks that make it impossible to understand what they're saying. The Idea Men plan to blow up the dam and flood The City. Can The Tick stop them?
Next up, Tick and Arthur team up with American Maid, to stop a mad plot of the infamous villan, Chairface Chippendale, who plans to carve his name into the moon during his birthday party!
Both episodes (as most of the series) are excellent. The only downside is, let's get all of them on DVD!
A short lived (but very funny) live action version of the Tick aired on Fox earlier this year, which hopefully, we'll see on DVD soon.",1013040000,11,1029,4.508021390374331
