This was far better than I was expecting. It is a bit overlong at 100 minutes, but fans of the original will want to check this out. John Waters has a funny bit as a priest!
This works better than other recent belated sequels such as COPRSE GRINDERS 2 or MARK OF THE ASTRO ZOMBIES, which were shot on tape. BLOOD FEAST 2 is film all the way!",1063238400,4,422,4.222222222222222
1879543,5,B000095J2Q,"Splatter fans will have much to enjoy in the return of the ""Godfather of Gore,"" H. Gordon Lewis to filmmaking.  ""Blood Feast 2: All you can eat"" is not a sequel to his infamous 1963 classic, ""Blood Feast,"" but rather a re-make.  This is a movie that couples lots of blood and guts with a wink and a nudge.  ""Blood Feast 2"" needs to be seen with a rowdy crowd of friends.
The plot is silly and the acting is cheesy, but it's all done with tongue in cheek (or ripped out).  A quick summary: Fuad Ramses III (played to perfection by J.P. Delahoussaye), grandson to the Ramses of the first film, has returned to town to resume the catering duties of his grandfather.  He's actually a slave to a goddess named Ishtar (not the movie), housed in a statute, commanded to dismember as many people as he can for his bloody buffet.
Hot on his trail are two bumbling cops, Detective Myers (Marc McLachln), whose weak stomach gets the best of him at crime scenes; and his partner, Detective Loomis (John McConnell), who eats just about anything that comes in reach of his fingers.  Loomis is a big fan of the dishes Ramses offers up to him, like his delicious ""ladyfinger"" sandwiches.
It's all good fun.  The script is silly and the jokes come as fast as the blood and guts.  Oh, and the nudity.  Lots of nudity.  The gore is cheesy and well done, and there's plenty of it.  There's little point in describing the technical details of the DVD set; this is one of those films that was not produced as a centerpiece to an expensive home-theater system, as you talk about anamorphic widescreen with DTS 5.1 sound.  You just pop it in and have fun.",1062633600,6,1631,4.418060200668896
1879544,5,B000095J2Q,"I really didn't expect this to be anything more than a rehash of times past, to be honest.
Hm, I was very surprised, to say the least. It's more of a remake than an actual sequel, although it's constructed to work as the latter as well.
Let me just say it has the same feeling of story, flow, wonderful acting and very reasonable character reactions in it...
All drenched into a great sleazy soundtrack and - this is the biggest change - really great and (more of less) realistic FX!

1879545,5,B000095J2Q,"Herschell Gordon Lewis is back, and better than ever! In 1963, Lewis directed the first ""gore"" movie--""Blood Feast."" After directing a host of other gore classics, HGL called it quits in 1972 and became one of the leading experts in marketing--he's written over twenty books on the subject. Of course, eventually someone HAD to make ""Blood Feast 2,"" and here it is. Herschell Gordon Lewis hasn't lost a single ounce of what made him so memorable. It's all here. Everything you would expect from the ""Godfather of Gore"" rears its ugly head onto the screen. And I do mean ugly. Bad, over-the-top acting, cheesy effects, minimal camera angles, dancing strippers that do nothing to enhance the plot, and more gore lingering than ever before, make up the bulk of this movie. However, if you're looking for a standard HGL script, you may be surprised--this one is really well done with more black humor then any previous Lewis film. At one moment, you're disgusted by the largest liver ever seen inside a human body, and the next minute, you're laughing your head off at the ridiculous dialogue and one-dimensional characters that also linger in the film. For fans of cult films and B-Movies, this one is not to be missed! It comes from the man who brought us the gore film, and he's back after being away from the camera for thirty years--much too long! It's a shame this film didn't get a bit more push from its producers and unlike previous HGL movies, it took quite a while before it was even released. Perhaps they should have asked their director for some marketing advise. In the world of HGL, you write the movie (sometimes), shoot the movie, edit the movie, and release the movie. There are no audience surveys, no focus groups, and certainly no good taste. If you know HGL, make sure to see his latest. If the world of B-Movie Madness is new to you, see the original first, but don't miss this classic sequel--it will leave you aghast! Let's hope he makes another.",1062460800,3,1968,4.690751445086705

Sure, it's a new movie, but this film could've been made right after 1972's 'Gore-Gore Girls' and fit in just fine. What I mean is, Lewis hasn't changed a bit, and I love him for it. Extreme gore is the raison d'etre and there's plenty of it. Many frames are just close-ups of bloody organs being fondled by a pair of hands, but there are some excellent FX as well. Like the original 'Blood Feast' there's no real plot to speak of, it's actually almost a remake. The grandson of Fuad Ramses opens a restaurant in the same town where the original murders took place, and immediately begins slaughtering women for another feast to honor a goddess. Meanwhile, a dumb cop investigates. There's more intentional humour in this one, and the endless jokes concerning the lead cop's overeating partner get tiresome. Nevertheless, I'm a huge fan and it's great to see a new film from a legendary director.",1061337600,,1043,4.643243243243243
1879549,5,B000095J2Q,"Absolutely hilarious!  I was afraid that H.G. Lewis might have lost his touch after all of these years, but he's definitely still got it.  The gore is just as over-the-top, excessive, and sleazy looking as in the first Blood Feast, but this one has the added bonus of being very funny (both intentionally and unintentionally).  John Waters' cameo as a priest is a perfect bit of casting, and is one of the high points of the film.  J.P. Delahoussaye as Fuad is also very good and quite likeable, and you really root for him right from the start.
The extras are nice, too, because they show that Lewis is fully in command of his movie.  Although it seems from the on-set documenary that a lot of the people working on the film have no idea whatsoever who he is, one of the female leads professes to be a fan, and the special effects technician dutifully follows Lewis' directions to a tee.
Of all the Lewis films I've seen, I'd say this probably has the most in common with ""The Gore Gore Girls"", both in the type of humor and the quality/quantity of gore.
One can only hope he makes more films while he still has the time.  Either way, this is a great return to filmmaking for a man who hasn't made a movie in FAR too long.",1061251200,2,1223,4.342105263157895

Movie Review: The GODFATHER OF GORE Herschell Gordon Lewis (YES YOU THICK-NECKED IGNORANT DINGLEBERRIES WHO LIKE TO THINK OTHERWISE YOU LOSERS!!!!) returns after some decades of retirement to direct the sequel to the VERY FIRST gore movie ever made ""Blood Feast"". This movie is stupid as hell but intentionally so. Every character in this movie stupid and clueless and it's f***ing funny. My favorite part of the movie is John Waters as a priest.

1879554,3,B000095J2Q,"NOTE: There are several versions of this movie available on DVD. The version I saw and am reviewing here is a nonanamorphic widescreen, R-rated cut that's part of the ""Cannibal Lunchbox"" boxed set. There are unrated versions of the film available with considerably more gore.

Herschel Gordon Lewis has a well-deserved reputation in cult/schlock film circles as a pioneering trailblazer. Throughout the 1960s, the movies he directed pushed the envelope with a series of virtually zero budget films that had substantial amounts of gore and nudity for that era and minimal amounts of quality acting and production values. Lewis retired from the film industry in the early 1970s to pursue a career in the ordinary business world, but, to the delight of his legions of fans, returned in 2002 with ""Blood Feast 2,"" a sequel to one of his earliest gorefests.

By conventional movie standards, ""Blood Feast 2"" is a disaster: amateurishly acted, with a silly plot line and virtually nonexistent production values. In addition, many people will find it completely disgusting. However, Lewis is perfectly aware both of the limitations of his production and the expectations of his target audience and has delivered a campy, perfectly self aware delight. Although the script is credited to co-producer Boyd Ford (his only screenplay credit), I expect Lewis himself had a lot to do with the film's twisted sense of humor.

""Blood Feast 2"" is actually somewhat of a remake of the original, which featured an insane caterer named Fuad Ramses who was chopping up attractive women as part of a blood ritual to the goddess Isis. This time around, the butchering caterer is Fuad Ramses III, grandson of the original proprietor of the catering company. FR3 wants to keep using the old family recipes, complete with the secret ingredients. Because he's the only caterer for miles around, he soon gets a job providing the refreshments for a fancy wedding.

In addition to providing FR3 with a source of income, the upcoming wedding supplies him with the supplies he needs to cater the affair, namely various body parts of the various bridesmaids, who soon start disappearing or turning up dismembered. The two investigating cops on the case are stumped, and with good reason; they make Larry and Curly look like rocket scientists. Young Myers, who looks like Matthew McConaughey's younger brother, is the groom-to-be, but his only police skill seems to be the ability to throw up all over a crime scene. His veteran partner, Loomis, is a big slob who is always eating a hot dog or doughnut.

Lewis mastered the formula for sick camp shlock fun in the 1960s and he has seamlessly updated his formula for the 21st century. The violence and gore in the R-rated version are fairly tame (well below the level of gore displayed in Eli Roth films or the ""Saw"" movies), but my understanding is there's a good bit more in the unrated version. This version does have a good bit of nudity, since the bridesmaids are quick to disrobe on several occasions in the movie. What makes the film enjoyable, however, is its wicked sense of humor. The screenplay doesn't try to hide the stupid plot and production limitations; instead, it plays on them and exaggerates them for comic effect. The cops are completely oblivious to everything around them, including the dead body they literally have to step over when they search Ramses' kitchen for evidence. In addition, severed body parts keep showing up as part of the catered goodies, such as ladyfingers whose filling consists of ... I think you get the idea.

The original ""Blood Feast,"" like many of Lewis' movies, clocked in at just over an hour, but this sequel is a good half hour longer. The added running time results in repetition... both of the sensationalism and the jokes. Stepping over a dead body or seeing a severed hand in a salad bowl is funny (if you've got that sort of humor) once, but not when you see this type of shtick four or five times. Still, I can't be too critical of a movie that features a cameo by another legendary cult director John Waters (a big fan of Lewis) as a perverted priest. ""Blood Feast 2"" probably won't hold up as well on repeat viewings as cult classics like ""Rocky Horror"" do (I personally have no desire to see it again), but, overall, it's a tasty morsel of a depraved movie.",1402704000,,4335,4.827725437415881

The belated follow up to the movie that launched his career in horror, Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat (2002) is Gordon Lewis' first movie in almost three decades.  Borrowing a few key elements from the original Blood Feast, Blood Feast 2 serves up the gore, while playing mostly as a dark, albeit rather unsophisticated comedy.

Fuad Ramses III (J.P. Delahoussaye) arrives in town to reopen the catering business of his grandfather Fuad Ramses.  The young Ramses is visited by police detective Myers (Mark McLachlan) and warned that if any young women turn up missing, he will be the prime suspect.  Ramses lands a big job catering a wedding, and it's not long before he falls under the influence of evil, and begins to murder young women, and use their body parts as the main ingredient in his various culinary creations.

Similar in the spirit of the original Blood trilogy, Blood Feast 2 is simply meant to be exploitative and over the top, and not to be taken seriously.  Herschell Gordon Lewis retains his demented sensibilities, which apparently provided the motivation for him to return to filmmaking at age 72.

1879574,4,B000095J2Q,"Nearly 40 years after the release of their ground-breaking splatter film BLOOD FEAST, Herschell Gordon Lewis and producer David Friedman dissolved past differences and came together to produce this quasi-remake of their own cult-classic. Fuad Ramses III has returned to take over his grandfather's old catering business, but after becoming possessed by the ancient statue of Ishtar in the backroom, he sets off on a vicious murder spree to gather the necessary ingredients he will need in order to throw another Egyptian blood feast! Thanks to the advent of home video and unrated film releases in recent years, Lewis has been given a free pass to include as much mindless violence and gratuitous nudity that he can come up with. To say that he has outdone the original BLOOD FEAST in the sheer amount of gore would be a gross understatement. On top of a few familiar kills that have been carried over from the first film, the younger Fuad scoops out girls' eyeballs, removes their intestines, grinds their hands and arms into pate, scoops out their brains, and peels off their faces before things really start to get ugly! With the exception of FEAST, few films in recent years have even come close in the gore department. Not surprisingly, the unimaginable amount of splatter is the only thing worth noting in this otherwise mindless spoof. Lewis' directing style has hardly improved in the last three decades, and his choices for the new cast, while nice to look at, are beyond terrible. The one exception would be in the overstated performance by unknown J.P. Delahoussaye, who brings back much of the classic camp to the picture. John Waters also sneaks in a brief cameo as the pedophilic priest set to marry the unfortunate couple in the end. While much of the humor falls flat in this unintelligible remake, gore fans cannot afford to miss what could be H.G. Lewis' last gore opus!

Some of the worst acting with one of the cheesiest scores ever, and the gore factor did not override the sheer dullness of the plot and characters.  When it was funny, it was entirely by accident.  However, one can cut it slack because it was remarkably made in 1963, which made it easily the most hardcore horror film at the time.  It still sucks by today's standards, though.  Nearly 40 years later, the director of the original film, Herschell Gordon Lewis (known as ""The Godfather of Gore""), decided to give it another whirl with decidedly different results.  ""Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat"" is decidedly comedic and scores a win with this horror fanatic for delivering intentional camp with it's gore.

The plot is a rehash of the first film, which featured a caterer possessed by the goddess Ishtar (stated as Egyptian, but actually Babylonian), who revels in cannibalism and human sacrifice.  Cannibalism and catering is a bad combination in general.  This time around it's the grandson of the original killer come to re-open the business he inherited from his family.  He is unaware of the crimes of his forefather, but the citizens of the town don't let that ignorance last for long.  Soon, young girls begin to disappear and it's up to two of the most hilariously incompetent cops in cinema history to put the pieces together and solve the mystery.  Meanwhile, Hell's caterer prepares to make the town's upcoming wedding a memorable one with only the finest ingredients for the feast.  But in exchange they'll have to do without the bridesmaids in the ceremony.

""Blood Feast 2"" is pretty much a laugh-a-minute affair if you're into movies that are so bad they're good.  This one pours intentional cheese all over itself with ridiculous moment after ridiculous moment.  How about a lingerie party where the girls all dress each other?  And of course, the girls get so hot for each other that a couple of them just have to go get a private room. Didn't you know that all women are just a couple of drinks (or one horror movie script) away from turning gay?  And any slasher fans out there know what happens next?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Brutal death, maybe?  The killer could have at least waited until the ladies got down to it.  That's just human decency.  Screw you, Lewis!  Anyhow, lots of unnecessary (see VERY necessary) nudity, multiple puke shots, homages and references to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween/dp/B000RIWAVW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween</a>&nbsp;series, nice touches of gore, and a totally sweet rockabilly soundtrack by Southern Culture on the Skids (join in on the chorus of ""gory gory hallelujah"") make this one of the most enjoyable slashers of the last decade.  Also, can you say ""John Waters as a priest hitting on little boys at the wedding reception""?  SCORE!

This is low-budget B-grade horror, for sure, but the genre-parodying humor really makes ""Blood Feast 2"" enjoyable where the first was just bad.

You want the 98 minute version, which is the UNCUT version.  The Special Edition is also UNCUT.  I assume we all want the uncut version because we're not here for the soliloquies.)

I don't want to go into the level of detail that Gordon Lewis fans know, so I'll present this review for a Lewis virgin:

HGL made movies in the 60s, a time where drive-in movies displaced male testosterone from peep show porn into gore and violence.  His strawberry marmalade, ketchup, tomato paste brand of hack-em-ups was signature long before the Troma Brothers and Bloodsucking Freaks came around.  How Lewis manages to revisit all his dramatic devices (tongue dislodgings, brain removal from cranium, eye-gouging) and make them look exactly the same almost 40 years later is a testament to the man's unyielding devotion to budget before craft. (Insider gossip says Lewis didn't really have full control of this movie; in fact, much of it was purportedly namesake.  The signature motifs, however, are Lewis originals.)

After all, a jar of strawberry jelly isn't what a jar of strawberry jelly was 40 years ago.  Have you seen the ingredients they put in today?  Absolutely frightening!

What Lewis brings to this installment of his art is sprinklings of culture from the time that has elapsed since Blood Feast.  There is rockabilly and heavy metal, the Butthole Surfers, in addition to a hilarious ode to Lt. Lorenzo from the 80s tv show Silk Stalkings (played deftly by Mark McLachlan), and a reference to Emeril Lagassi's ""kick it up a notch"" (BAM!) that will surely delight food fans and fetishists from all around.

McLachlan, bearing a resemblance to Tom Cruise may have spent many hours studying Mr. Glib, as he masters all the most annoying traits of Cruise's method acting.  His partner Detective Loomis (John McConnell) eats nonstop from the beginning of the movie to the end.  There's a string of sexy girls (now in somewhat updated, but still strangely outdated attire) and a rich mother that's right out of a John Waters movie.

For John Waters's fans, it is a delight to finally see Lewis's #1 fan pay homage to his mentor onscreen.  JW plays a priest who scours a wedding for new choir boys.  Devilishly evil!  (Don't worry, the boy looks like he's in his mid 20s!)

All in all, a cheesy and over-the-top flick from the originator of the genre.  Yes, there is Airplane-style silliness, bad, cheap jokes that make you groan and roll your eyeballs out of sheer embarrassment, and a type of violence that is so juvenile that only unemployed feminists can write a thesis on.

What one really wants to see is how Herschell Gordon Lewis can conquer inflation and make an incredibly low budget movie in the millenium look as if the same exact amount of money was spent as in 1963's original Blood Feast.  And in this department, Lewis never disappoints!",1226534400,,2999,4.799220272904483
1879578,4,B000095J2Q,"blood feast 2 is the sequel to the 1960's film blood feast directed by herschell gordon lewis. i haven't seen the original but i'm aware of its reputation of being the first splatter film ever made. blood feast 2 is the only film i have seen of mr. lewis and after being very entertained and my thirst for gore being more than quenched i will probably seek out his other films. this film is very entertaining and very, very, very gory. the plot involves the grandson of the killer from the original blood feast inheriting his grandfathers catering buisiness and after being possed or hypnotized or something by a magic statue of the godess ishtar he begins murdering and mutilating the bridesmaids of a wedding hes catering and using their flesh to prepare the wedding food. this may sound campy and it is. the whole film is campy and corny. some of the acting is pretty bad, but the actor who plays the killer does a good job at being demented, charming and funny. also the 2 cops are funny to watch. the film is more of a comedy than a horror film. the only thing that makes it a horror film is the extremely graphic carnage and gore. the film is filled with disembowlment, eye gouging, throat cutting, scalping and many other forms of mutilation. the gore scenes are long and very graphic and the special effects, while not 100% convincing are pretty good. this is, as the bach of the dvd states, a gorehounds wet dream. this movie is almost buying for the splatter alone, but the entire film is fun and never gets boring. as i said before, the film is really a comedy and if it took itself seriously than the gore would be some of the most gross and brutal stuff ever(not that it isn't gross or brutal, it is). the comedy works, the gore is amazing and the whole film is very enjoyable. any gorehound should pick this up, just make sure you get the uncut version.",1213228800,,1867,4.446064139941691
1879579,4,B000095J2Q,"Herschell Gordon Lewis may have directed Blood feast 2, but he really doesn't consider it one of his films.  The reason for this is because he was pretty much a hired-on director for the film; It wasn't his script, the whole idea had been put together and planned out before he even came on board.  In fact, the film was all edited, cut and released without Lewis even seeing it!  Lewis knew what he was getting into, but he took on this project because he had the itch to make a movie again.  Hell, he'd had that itch for quite a few years and when he was approached with a treatment for Blood Feast 2, he happily accepted.  He did have fun shooting the film though.  Regardless of Lewis' lack of final cut, this movie is pretty fun.  It's pretty much what you'd expect one of his films to look like in the 21st century.  The acting hasn't improved(or Lewis won't allow it to), the gore is still plentiful and of varying degrees of quality, and it's all still done for laughs, maybe moreso in this film than any of his others.  The film is very low budget, yet it looks higher budgeted than any of his previous films.  The plot of Blood Feast 2 has the grandson of the killer from the first film inheriting his grandfather's catering business.  The new and younger Fuad Ramses decides to set up shop and run his catering business, but he quickly falls under the spell of that evil goddess, Ishtar, and soon he's out collecting those body parts for a brand new blood feast to resurrect the goddess.  Opportunity knocks in the form of a wedding reception he's hired to cater.  Soon the bridesmaids are becoming ingredients for the feast.  Two detectives are hot on the case, one of them is the son of the detective from the first film.  Essentially, it's a rehashing of Blood feast, you could almost call it a remake.  Lewis piles on the gore, which like his later films, consist of many shots of hands digging in bellies/torsos, pulling out organs and squeezing them and playing with them.  And people thought Lucio Fulci lingered on gore shots!!  The gore scenes are accompanied by music from rockabilly/surf band Southern Culture On The Skids, giving the scenes a goofy yet different feel from the organ and jazz music we used to hear in the gore scenes in Lewis' older films.  I found this movie to be quite funny.  It's full of bad puns(which I love), cartoony slapstick and sometimes clever exchanges, usually between Ramses and the detectives.  The detectives are a hoot.  While Blood Feast 2 may not break the ground that Lewis' films did years earlier, it's a nice throwback to those good ol days, and shows that 30+ years out of the director's chair hasn't hindered Lewis one bit.  Lets just hope he gets the urge to do this a bit more often.",1188518400,,2751,4.502016129032258
1879580,2,B000095J2Q,"I wanted to like this movie because I like HGL in interviews, I love his commentaries on his older DVD's, and I like horror. Campy horror is okay, exploitation films are great, gore is fine by me. Sadly, I cannot recommend this movie. The good? Well, this is the type of film where women decide to have a ""lingere shower"" prior to a wedding and model said lingere for each other. More nudity than you can shake a stick at. The bad? Most everything else. The jokes are occasionally funny, but mostly just terribly unfunny. The acting is miserable because it seems intentionally bad (one of the hallmarks of a good bad movie is that it wants to be good). Fuad Ramses III is cringe-inducing; the music is over used and too campy; the script is closer to ""Hell Asylum"" than ""2,000 Maniacs."" If you like gore flicks, stick with the original.",1167091200,,836,4.506578947368421
1879581,5,B000095J2Q,"I first saw the R rated version of this that had about 6 minutes of gore cut, resulting in this tame version to have little gore. Still, I liked this movie! The gore level was low but this movie redeemed itself with its comedy and sexy scenes!!! This still was a hell of a good film even without the gore! Later I bought the unrated uncut version which is the orgiinal film with all 6 minutes of gore put back. It still basically is the same movie with or without the gore, but the unrated movie just featured extended scenes of unneeded storyless torture, violence, disembowlment and even more that was kinda fake looking,but still at a gross out level. I liked this movie with or without the gore, but for those gore hounds out there, check out the unrated version, cause this has wall to wall with gore!!",1146960000,2,807,4.422818791946309
1879582,1,B000095J2Q,"I have nothing against ""camp"":  camp can be funny, camp can be entertaining.  I have nothing against ""schlock""; it has its place in cheap horror films, too.

But I had no idea what kind of garbage I was about to see when I watched Blood Feast 2 - All U Can Eat.  Someone needs to tell the, uh, ""director"" a/k/a Herschell Gordon Lewis that his special effects used in his original Blood Feast might have scared a 10-year old then.  In 2006, well, it's pretty pitiful when you recycle the same old garbage--and come up with worse trash.

I am not going to tell anything about the storyline because, well, you have to have a storyline first.  All this movie entails is ""dialogue; gruesome scene; dialogue; gruesome scene; dialogue/nakedness/then gruesome scene.  To borrow a phrase uttered by Beavis and Butthead, ""these effects aren't very special"".  That phrase sums up this lame attempt at movie making.  If I could give this ""zero"" stars, I would.

Uncanny and side splittingly funny, McLachlan nails Cruise's mannerisms and tics that make up the main body of Cruise's early acting roles. Genius pure genius, not to mention that McLachlan looks like Cruise circa Top Gun.

Oh yes and the gore in this movie will make you feel nauseous, unless you work in a slaughter house or have a psychological condition.

Blood Feast 2 is basically a re-imagining of the first with a contemporary feel to it, a new chef opening a catering business where the last store in the first Blood Feast occured. The two detectives in this movie are hilarious, especially the one who eats all the time.  The boobage is high quality, I'm impressed.

HGL's self-awareness allows this cheesy, gory, fun-fest to come off well intentioned and very entertaining.  It makes me hope HGL makes another movie and soon!

Yet another reason to boycott the lifeless corporate machine that is Blockbuster.",1111881600,,375,4.552238805970149
1879587,4,B000095J2Q,"Blood Feast 2 is one of the most unlikely sequels in the history of cinema.  Lewis appeared to have retired from filmmaking for good following The Gore-Gore Girls in 1972 leaving behind film to pursue a career in advertising.  Lo and behold few people would have expected him to return to the fold 30 years later with a sequel to Blood Feast, his most infamous film ever.  Who knows what really possessed Lewis to make this film?  It is never explained despite the numerous features on this special edition DVD, but Blood Feast 2 proves that Lewis still has the ability to deliver the goods even in his twilight years.  Think this movie might be a little soft considering Lewis is now 75?  Think again.
In an unnamed small southern town, an independent caterer opens up shop.  The caterer's name is Fued Ramses, whose grandfather was the one that sacrificed people in honour of an Egyptian goddess in the original Blood Feast.  Well, Fued seems to have picked up a few tricks from grandpa's trade as he grinds fresh human meat for his delicatessen.  A dork by the name of detective Myers is suspicious, being able to put 2 and 2 together and figure out that the murders in his small town have coincided with Ramses' recent arrival.  This detective is also soon getting married to a pretty girl named Tiffany.  Tiffany's mother has enlisted Ramses' catering services for the wedding, obviously unaware of exactly what kind of ""meat"" Ramses' catering specializes in.  As the wedding approaches, the people invited prepare themselves accordingly, including Ramses who will ensure the meat at the wedding is fresh and bloody.
Fans of Lewis will not be disappointed as this film is packed to the rafters with plenty of nauseating scenes of gore.  I still find that the bodies looked too much like mannequins however the internal organs are definitely a vast improvement over Lewis' earlier films.  I don't get out to see guts, livers and pancreases very often but to me this stuff looked uncomfortably authentic, as did the color of the blood.  There's also no shortage of naked voluptuous women in the movie.  Although Lewis has never been able to attract people with semi-decent acting abilities, he certainly knew where to find the babes for this movie.  Speaking of the acting it was unbearably bad as can be expected however I couldn't help but wondering throughout the movie if this wasn't intentional.  The actors are so bad that one could probably pluck people right off the street that would do a better job than this.  But is good acting even allowed in an H.G. Lewis film? I'm gonna go out on a limb here and guess that Lewis probably doesn't even allow decent acting in his movies, as bad acting has become as much a trademark of his films as the infamous gore.  So to bad-mouth one of his films simply on the basis of atrocious acting to me feels like a moot point.
Really, I thought this film was great.  I've already mentioned the babes and the gore but another thing I particularly liked was the retro 50's and 60's style to it.  Many of the characters wear clothes from that era and most of the male leads have enough gunk in their hair to keep the marketing executives of hair gel companies very happy.  Oh and how could I fail to mention the music, the entire soundtrack is played by Southern Culture on the Skids whose rockabilly twang has rarely sounded as good.  Not to mention that the Butthole Surfers have a tune in here too. Throw in a cameo appearance by ""Pink Flamingos"" director John Waters and an extra disc packed with special features and Blood Feast 2 turns out to be an essential package for Lewis fans.  The behind the scenes footage in the extra disc reveals that cast and crew seemed to have a blast of a time while making this movie.  Blood feast 2 is also injected with lots of great humour.  Much of the dialogue in the film was intentionally laughable of course, especially whatever came out of the detective's partner's mouth, a loudmouth who wears tacky Hawaiian shirts and has a rabid appetite for doughnuts.  It's good to see that Lewis doesn't take himself or his films any more seriously than he used to as I've always found self-deprecation to be the funniest type of humour. Best line: ""I only use the freshest meat in my sandwiches"".",1077840000,17,4278,4.645418326693227
1879588,4,B000095J2Q,"Yes, this sequel is 40 years in the making and has been talked about probablly more than any other sequel in horror history over the past few years.  Jackie Morgan succeeds where others have failed, not only coaxing the over seventy year- old ""Godfather of Gore"" Herschell Gordon Lewis back into the director's chair but also bringing back David Friedman, producer of the original.  The crown jewel of this cult film follower's wet dream is the participation of infamous cult director John Waters in his cameo apperance as a minister, of all things!  The plot is inconsequential because what everyone is interested in seeing is the blood and guts style stomach churners that Lewis is famous for and he definately does not disappoint.  Add some extremely campy dark humor to the mix and you have all the makings of a cult masterpiece!  A must see for gorehounds or fans of HGL!",1073433600,6,876,4.774834437086093
1879589,4,B000095J2Q,"Forty years after inventing the gore film, Herschell Gordon Lewis returns with a sequel to his classic schlockfest ""Blood Feast."" Entitled ""Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat,"" the Godfather of Gore once again grosses out viewers with a cornucopia of sickening scenes, hammy acting, stilted dialogue, and corny gags. Over the past few months, I have learned to admire this pioneer's original efforts and when I saw a new release from the master, I just had to run out and pick up the DVD. The biggest surprise about ""Blood Feast 2"" is the gore, which attains new depths of soul shattering nausea. Gone forever are the obviously fake store mannequins of the original films, replaced with special effects on a level never before seen in one of his movies. ""Blood Feast 2"" revels in gruesome scenes of carnage, and does so in a way that would make Peter Jackson sit up and take note. This film will delight rabid grue fans.
The viewer of ""Blood Feast 2"" quickly arrives at the conclusion that something ominous looms on the horizon. The opening sequences of the film show two vagrants stumbling around behind a strip mall where they see an eerie red light seeping out from underneath a door. The light causes the two men to immediately attack each other in a gore scene that ranks as one of the most startling opening scenes in B movie history. A minute later, we see Fuad Ramses III returning to his grandfather's decrepit catering business. In the original ""Blood Feast,"" Fuad Ramses went a little off his head and began abusing the local contingent of lasses in order to pay bloody homage to a statue of the Goddess Ishtar. Fuad's grandson seems like a nice sort of fellow, hardly the type of chap to fall for such bunk as ancient statues and cannibalism, but a local cop, Detective Myers, has a different idea about Fuad, and he quickly pays a visit to the young man in order to straighten him out. It seems that some of the townspeople are chary that the shenanigans of forty years ago may once again claim a few victims. Fuad Ramses III assures the officer that his grandfather's business will assume a sterling reputation under his tenure, and all seems right with the world.
Wrong, of course. Fuad Ramses III discovers the old Ishtar sculpture in the backroom and quickly falls under its spell. Soon the carnage starts anew, as several young ladies disappear under mysterious circumstances. It turns out that the cop who visited Fuad is a complete dunce, and his suspicions that the recent disappearances might have something to do with the reopening of the catering shop fall on the deaf ears of his portly partner, Detective Loomis, a guy who spends most of his time eating at his desk while ogling the pretty, smart mouthed redhead who works at the police station. As for the young Fuad, business promises to pick up when he discovers that Detective Myers will soon wed the beautiful daughter of Mrs. Lampley. Ramses despises this coiffed, wicked woman, but he realizes he needs the business if his enterprise will succeed. The wedding reception is a real hoot, especially with the surprising appearance of John Waters as the officiating priest. The conclusion delivers oceans of gore.
H.G. Lewis really outdid himself with this highly entertaining sequel. First, the gore is simply mind blasting. In his earlier opuses, Lewis always allowed the camera to linger on the unfolding carnage, a technique he uses to sickening effect here as well, but the special effects are SO much better in ""Blood Feast 2."" The last movie I saw that reveled in this type of grue was Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive."" Don't get me wrong; Lewis's film does not approach the frantic pace of Jackson's film, but the gore here truly turns the stomach and made me ask on more than one occasion: ""Did I really just see that""? Imagine seeing a corkscrew used to grim effect, more than one evisceration shown in loving detail, a peeling (best left unexplained), and numerous limbs in places other than where they should be. I'll watch ""Blood Feast 2"" again just to study the nasty special effects work.
Simultaneously, Lewis plays for high camp in this outing. Bad acting and atrocious dialogue are as commonplace in a Herschell Gordon Lewis film as trees in a forest, but this movie is one of the first ones I have seen from this director where he really lets the actors look like they are having a blast. Melissa Morgan, the actress who plays the ultra snarky Mrs. Lampley, takes her performance so over the top that it simply defies description. I cannot comprehend how a woman could manage to stand upright with that much makeup on. Another winner of the Udo Kier award for overacting is Mark McLachlan as the supremely dense Detective Myers (look for Myers's nausea gag; it's a hoot that just gets funnier and funnier as the movie progresses). In fact, everyone does a great job of doing a bad job acting.
I was a bit disappointed with this Special Edition DVD. There is no Lewis/Friedman commentary included, although you do get a bonus disc with behind the scenes looks at the gore effects, a couple of deleted scenes, and short (very short) interviews with Lewis and the cast and crew. The movie disc comes with a mess of trailers for several gory horror films from the likes of Joe D'Amato. Overall, ""Blood Feast 2"" is an unabashed gore classic, and I hope Lewis and company make another film in the near future. How about a sequel to ""The Wizard of Gore""?",1063670400,4,5436,4.69916142557652
