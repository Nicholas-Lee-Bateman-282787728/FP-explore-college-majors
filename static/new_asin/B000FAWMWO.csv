8119842,3,B000FAWMWO,I chose this rating based upon a comparison between My New Partner I and this film. The acting is good but the plot seemed contrived. Too many chance events to move the movie along. We are very fond of Phillipe Noiret and the other actors are good but not quite as good as the cast in the original movie.,1389052800,,304,4.169491525423729
