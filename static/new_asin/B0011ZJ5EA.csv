8243198,5,B0011ZJ5EA,"I am especially pleased that I got this particular DVD. Reason being it is the same sub-style of (Hebei) XingYi I was taught by my ShiFu ...in particular the Pao Chuan fist. Most other Hebei XingYi sub-styles have a simpler version of Pao Chuan, but this one has the same type taught to me (which is not as simplified and has a rather nasty application).

Anyways, this is a great DVD when it comes to learning the 5 fists. The DVD doesn't go into the 12 Animals, but the 5 Fists by themselves are more than enough to learn effective XingYi. A nice little video that I was quite pleased to get. It goes through the 5 fists in detail, and shows some of the more subtle movements that other DVDs may overlook.

XingYi is fortunate that it is not (yet) that popular (meaning there are not a lot of fake teachers showing diluted material), and thus virtually every XingYi DVD you get will be a 4 or 5 star. This one is definitely a 5 star and I can only think of one that is equal to this one, and one that is better.",1370217600,2,1013,4.18974358974359
