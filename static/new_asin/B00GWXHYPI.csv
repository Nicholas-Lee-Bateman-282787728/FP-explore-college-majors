6121720,5,B00GWXHYPI,"A wonderful selection of Poirot mini-movies.  The quality of production on top of the great acting and writing, makes these a great buy.",1394409600,3,136,4.913043478260869
6121721,3,B00GWXHYPI,"This is a supposed HD re-issue of Poirot Movie Collections 4 & 5 (minus Murder On The Orient Express which has already been issued on Blu-ray).
Unlike Poirot Series 1 through 10 (which were produced on film), Series 11 was produced on PAL (Phase Alternate Line) Standard Definition Video with a resolution of 576i.  So that means this HD re-issue must be an up-conversion and not a new transfer of original film elements.

There is little, if any, improvement over the previous DVD releases.  The absolute ONLY improvement I can see is better color balance for the blacks.  Some shadows appear dark blue on the previous DVD, here they are black. The rest of the colors appear the same, NO improvement.  The Blu-ray is surprisingly SOFT in focus, identical to the previous DVD.
Think twice before re-buying these mysteries.  If you have not bought them yet, then price wise this is the version you should buy.  However, Acorn has not yet announced any re-issue of the old set 4 DVD's bonus documentary.

""Series 11"" of Poirot is the only series produced in Standard Definition PAL Video. Series 1 through 10 were produced on super 16mm FILM and can be scanned to HD Video at a High Resolution. Series 12 & 13 were produced on High Definition Video.

The only other difference to note is that the old DVDs started with the PBS Masterpiece Mystery logo, this re-release starts with an ITV Studios logo.

Blu-ray fans will be disappointed at the DVD quality of the image.  One wonders if the directors were intending the hazy effect, but all four mysteries look this way.

***** = for the mysteries themselves.
** = for this re-issue.

From set 4:
MRS. McGINTY'S DEAD
CAT AMONG THE PIGEONS

From set 5:
THE THIRD GIRL
APPOINTMENT WITH DEATH.

Missing from set 4:
SUPER SLEUTHS: A documentary about the entire series with David Suchet, with interviews from the cast. (Hopefully it will get re-issued in ""Series 13"", it is different from the documentary in ""series 10"".)

Missing from set 5:

6121722,1,B00GWXHYPI,"These are titles that I purchased in another Acorn collection quite recently.  If you own any Poirot collections, check them first to prevent duplication.  No one can make sense of this marketing strategy.

And so it does herein with the two episodes featuring the mystery writer character Ariadne Oliver (Mrs McGinty's Dead and Third Girl) along with episodes Cat Among the Pigeons (a captivating tale of international intrigue at a girl's school) and Appointment with Death (which is more of a travelogue with a murder set in the Middle East than a mystery that is decipherable).",1391472000,15,649,4.944954128440367

6121894,3,B00GWXHYPI,"I normally don't review DVD/Blu-Ray purchases, but after watching this set I feel like it's necessary.
I have NOT seen the DVD version of these ones, but in at least the first episode (Mrs. McGinty) the image quality is not good, like they were going for a dark and shaky look, or a hazy look.  It was a little distracting.

Mrs. McGinty's Dead is a decent adaptation of the novel, and I'm always a fan of Zoe Wanamaker as Ariadne Oliver.

Cat Among The Pigeons is the best one in the set, in my opinion.  It's a favorite novel of mine, and although they made some changes to the plot, they made the story easier to tell.  The really good moments were all preserved.

Third Girl is also a decent adaptation.  Zoe Wanamaker really shines as Mrs. Oliver, and while changes were made, I actually thought they were an improvement.  I am not a fan of the novel, so I liked this better.

Appointment with Death, however, was a disappointment.  It's one of the ones I was looking forward to (especially since you can't seem to get the Ustinov adaptation of the novel on DVD in Region 1) and for me, it fell flat.  It had some definite star talent (Tim Curry, Elizabeth McGovern - the best in the group - and John Hannah (Jonathan from the Mummy) but the adaptation was horrible.  They brought a character back who's long dead in the book (and made him very unlikable) and added graphic scenes of child abuse (in the original novel, I believe it was psychological rather than physical).  While we normally allow our 9 year old to watch Poirot, I would not recommend this one for a younger viewing audience.  It's creepy, trippy, and overdone.  The murder was also pretty brutal (although the victim is not one of Christie's more likable characters), and they've added a bunch of extraneous stuff that really detracted for me.",1452384000,,1817,4.547692307692308

6121961,5,B00GWXHYPI,Nobody plays Poirot like Suchet.  I have the entire set and each one has merits of its own.  Wonderful series.,1428364800,,110,4.45
6121992,3,B00GWXHYPI,"I am a huge Suchet/Poirot fan.  I have all of the previous episodes on DVD.  But I debated about buying the last three series (11, 12, and 13) because I wasn't sure I wanted to experience the visual pain of watching  David Suchet grow too old, past his prime.  I cycle through the complete Poirot every three years as I do with Jeremy Brett's great depiction of Sherlock Holmes.  This time, I decided to take the plunge and buy the final three series on Amazon.

To my surprise, Suchet looks great!  Of course, his performance is superb.  Moreover, while I miss the old gang of Chief Inspector Japp, Miss Lemon, and Captain Hastings, I do think it is necessary for the character to evolve.  In that regard, I think the writers got it right by providing Poirot with his own butler, chauffeur, and luxury limousine.  They also got it right with Poirots new sidekick, mystery writer Oliver.  I found that to work very nicely.  The production value in terms of set designs, costume, etc., is also a step-up from previous Poirots if that is possible because those were also excellent.

But there are some downsides to make me not like this series as much as I did all the previous ones.  First, for some reason, the writers felt the need to lift or, to be more truthful, steal, some scenes from a few of the earlier Poirots.  Now, I must qualify this by saying I have not read any of the novels, just watched the DVDs.  So if Agatha Christie wrote these same scenes repeatedly in her novels, then the writers are to be excused.  That said, here are the lifted scenes:

1) Mrs McGintys Dead:  the closing scene is a virtual carbon copy of the closing scene of Sad Cypress.  Just because the actors are different and it isn't exactly the same, the fact is the premise is exact, right down to Poirot saying, go.  Clearly this was lifted.  Do writers really not think Poirot fans like me wouldnt notice?  The closing scene in Sad Cypress has long been one of my favorites, particularly if not mostly because of Christopher Gunnings magnificent musical score of the last three minutes.  In McGintys plagiarism of this scene, however, the stand-in composer isn't up to Gunnings talent and the scene falls completely flat.  Maybe if the writers had tried to be original instead of going back to steal scenes they liked from earlier episodes, they could have come up with something that actually worked.  Instead, it turned out lousy and offended and insulted Poirot loyalists like me.  To whoever reads this, if you have Sad Cypress, go compare the closing music (and yes, the lifted plot) of the closing last 5 minutes of both and youll see what I mean.

2) Third Girl:  Poirot helps yet another central character (as in the earlier Peril at End House) engage in a fake death to trick the culprits into confessing.  Yes, a couple twists are different, but the basic premise of the faked death to trick others is identical.  This is artistic theft.

3) Appointment With Death:  the two mysterious camel riders, where one dismounts and takes off the desert Bedoin face scarfs to be one of the tourist group.  This is a rip-off of an identical sequence in the earlier Poirot episode, Death on the Nile.  Just because there are some differences, doesnt mean the art isn't the same.  In Death on the Nile, the mysterious Bedoin is discovered to be an old friend of Poirots.  In Appointment With Death, its an English woman.  But the dramatic lead-up of both to the unveiling is identical.

I guess it shows the regard the writers and their directors and producers have for Poirot fans that they think they can steal scenes from previous episodes and insert them and expect us to just accept it.  Sorry, I dont.  And if Agatha Christie did repeat these identical scenes in her different stories, then she can be called....lazy!

Other problems:  these fall at the hands of the writers, too.  This is the convoluted, overly complex, multiple story lines.  Who can keep track of all of it.  It becomes absurd.  I know they're trying to give us a good conclusion for Poirot to wrap-up in his renowned closing summation.  But each one of these episodes contain so many independent intersecting story lines it ceases to be fun for the viewer.  Remember, I love all the previous Poirots, and these did not have this level of complexity.  Surprises, yes, but not to the point where at the end of it, I have no idea where I am!  Way, way overdone.

All of the above apply to all of these four episodes for Series 11.  Here are a few episode specifics:

Mr. McGintys Dead:  all the scenes are dark, visually, for the viewer.  I didn't like that.  Depressing.

Cat Among the Pigeons:  the best episode of the four.  Conclusion was great.  Happy ending that seemed real.

Third Girl:  I liked most of it until the closing sequence whereupon the whole thing lost me (as with the others, too, as previously mentioned).

Appointment With Death:  Stephen Mckeons musical score for the opening and the last 5 minutes...tremendous.  Extremely beautiful composition.

I can see giving this a 4 but I went with a 3 just because I don't like writers stealing the work of others.  If that doesnt bother you, then youll find Suchet to be at his best and the production quality to be tops.",1427846400,4,5249,4.61430119176598

Mrs. McGintys DeadVery good production as Poirot attempts to tries to save a wrongly convicted man from execution.  The sets and costumes are authentic;  acting is excellent.  Story well told.

Cat Among the Pigeons Excellent production and great acting;  however Poirot was not as involved in this story until the near-end of the book.  Here, of course, he is curiously staying at a girl's school.  Great setting and this is one of my favorite of her stories.

Third GirlFairly true to story production, some liberties taken.  Acting good, sets and costumes good.

6122180,5,B00GWXHYPI,"I like the fact that the series' writers let Poirot becomes more emotional. He shows kindness, empathy and even joy for the main protagonist in each episode's triumphant. And he doesn't forgive the evil doers. Appointment with Death is a standout with the gorgeous Morocco location and sharp visual. It also doesn't have Ariadne Oliver written in. For me, she is a distraction. David Suchet is excellent and entertaining as always. However, I have reservation about the filtered looks of Mrs. McGintys Dead, Cat Among the Pigeons, and Third Girl. I understand the film makers want to make the cast looks even more attractive. But I do want to enjoy the art and production designs in sharp details. Anyway, I love the four episodes on this blu ray.",1398816000,,747,4.84375
6122181,2,B00GWXHYPI,"When I started to watch the first movie I soon got the impression that someone was making a bad joke. Never in a long time have I seen such utterly poor image quality. If this is HD my name is Santa Claus. Acorn Media should be ashamed to publish such trash. The movies are excellent, but suffer extensively from lower than low reproduction quality. I would stay clear of this product if I were you.",1397606400,18,399,4.333333333333333
