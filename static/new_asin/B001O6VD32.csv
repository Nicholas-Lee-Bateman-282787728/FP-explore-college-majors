8329765,5,B001O6VD32,"While in Okinawa I studied Shorin Ryu Karate under the late Sei Fuki Nitta and his son, Kasuma Nitta.  It was very common for people from around the world to visit Sinsei Nitta and practice Karate at his Dojo.  Several people that came did so to push their own agenda. This is not the case with Mr. Alexander.  The Vol 1 and Vol 2 of this DVD are great videos that showcase advanced katas as well as several weapon techniques.  This is a great addition to my library.",1418947200,,467,4.2727272727272725
