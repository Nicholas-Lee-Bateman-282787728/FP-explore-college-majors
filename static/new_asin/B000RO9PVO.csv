8201683,3,B000RO9PVO,"This is a DVD on dobro technique. While Arlen is undoubtedly a skilled player, he is not well organized as a teacher. He jumps from one technique to another faster than I can follow him, and only demonstrating technique, not teaching it. He also assumes a given base of knowledge is possessed by the student, when it may not be. While there are many notable points presented here, they are not for a beginner. Perhaps this should be retitled as intermediate dobro, etc.  I wish it were better, but it simply ain't so!",1496620800,,517,4.559139784946237
8201684,4,B000RO9PVO,I am a believer in multiple sources for the novice. No you will not learn everything  you need to know but it is an excellent instruction source. I recommend it. Roth covers a lot and his instruction style is concise and personable.,1377129600,,232,4.523809523809524
