I watch both TNA and wwe

TNA's Hard Justice PPv. i give 9 out of 10

Everyone is saying that judgment day rules.......are you kidding me or have expectations for wwe have gone so low that people are actually calling Backlash and Judgment Day 2005 good? Thats pathetic...

quit watching wwe's soap oprah BS and turn on the tube every friday afternoon for TNA the new GOOD werstling show, yes there is now an alternative..

WWE sucks and is a rippoff After this show i am no longer ordering anything in which the money goes to wwe (bouycoting)

2299789,5,B0009MAPVS,"Ladies and gents smackdown normally sucks. Raw normally blows them out of the water week in week out. But this pay per view was great. Best Smackdown pay per view maybe ever!
The pay per view starts off with the tag team titles
  Champions MNM vs. Hardcore Holly &Charlie Haas
I didn't expect much from this match and im sure no one really did because we knew who was going to win. But this match was really a good opener. It was fast paced wasn't slow and boring and there were some bright exciting spots 7/10
  Carlito vs. The Big Show
This was probably the worse or second worse match of the night. Big Show dominated but you no wat happens. Some guy that will never amount to anything in wwe ruins the day. Matt Morgan rips off brock lesnar and f-5's big show Carlito 1-2-3 5/10
  Cruiserweight Title Champ Paul London vs. Chavo
Pretty good match...cruiserweights don't normally interest me but this was a good solid match. London was a sweet finisher 8/10
  US Title Champ Orlando Jordan vs. Heidenreich
This was the other bad match that happend. Jordan controls the whole match and we all wait for Heidenreich to get going he never does. Bad ending. 5/10
  Booker T vs. Kurt Angle
This was a great match. Other than undertaker booker T is the best. I was on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. Not really a dull moment in this match. When is book going to win the wwe title anyway? 9/10
  Eddie G. vs. Rey Mysterio
Another sweet match. I didn't really expect a great match but they gave us one. Eddie does a good job as a bad guy and rey is always great. This could have been the best match if it wasn't for the main event. 9/10
  WWE Championship (c) John cena vs. JBL
First off the entrance by cena was cool. The match was amazing.extremely brutal. Best Smackdown match in probably a year. Blood was everywhere.....match of the year! Ending was a little dull though but still amazing 10/10

2299801,4,B0009MAPVS,"Judgement day 2005 had one of the bloodiest matches I have ever seen. JBL vs CENA. it also had a fantastic one on one battle between guerreo and mysterio.

match 1. wwe tag titles MNM(c) vs hardcore holly and Charlie Haas
This match was a good opener. very technical match with a little high impact moves. MNM performs well in their PPV opener and haas and holly are two profesionals. the only downside to this match was that it was predictable. 3/5

match 2. Big show vs Carlito
boring filler. Big show should be in main events not in fillers. The screwjob ending just makes this a complete squash match. 1/5

match 3. cruiseweight title paul london(c) vs chavo guerreo
this was a very good match. alot of counters and a very fast paced match. a few wicked moves like the f50 splash and a ending that was very good. the only downside to the match was that it was a little short. 3.5/5

match 4. kurt angle vs booker t
the storyline to this match was stupid however I thought these two were gonna put on a show. I was wrong. a very boring match which took forever. alot of submissions grapples that were unnessary and a ending that just came out of nowhere. overall a dissapointing match. 2/5

match 5.us title orlando jordan(c) vs heidenreich
this wasn't much of a match. heidenreich dominates for most of the match and jordan only gets in a few moves. the ending doesn't make sense to me but at least the match was short. 2.5/5

match 6. rey mysterio vs eddie guerreo
what a match. better than their WM 21 match. alot of passion in the match and eddie plays the perfect heel. these two go at it for a good 20 minutes with counter after counter move after move. the ending was pulled off fantastic and help make this match what it is. 4.5/5

sidenote  this match would've been the match of the night if the main event hadn't kicked a#%

match 7. wwe title I Quit match John cena(c) vs JBL
this match was awesome. so much blood and alot of hardcore moves. these two took eachother to the limit. way better than their match at mania. Alot of hardcore weapons are used such as steel pipe, chair, tv , steel stairs etc. the moment when JBL is busted open is awesome. this match is the whole PPV. The ending was great as well. 5/5

You should buy Judgement day 2005 for two reasons the Main event and the guerreo vs mysterio match.",1211241600,,2327,4.353348729792148
2299802,5,B0009MAPVS,"I don't say that often about a John Cena match but his bout with JBL here is definitely one of his best! Before I go into that, let's see the rest of the card:

MNM Vs. Hardcore Holly/Charlie Haas (WWE Tag Team Championship) - MNM had only recently become champs after a win over the defunct team of Eddie Gurerro (RIP) and Rey Mysterio.

The match itself was better than I expected. Great moves by both men but Melina makes the difference for MNM as they retained the belts!

The Big Show Vs. Carlito - This is basically a squash job with TBS dominating most of the bout untl the referee gets knocked down. Matt Morgan (who is now with TNA) gets in and does Brock Lesner's old F5 finisher to help Carlito get the win.

Paul London Vs. Chavo Gurerro (WWE Cruiserweight Title Match) - Great bout! A little short but excellent moves by both men. Ends when London hits his 450 splash. I should note that this was his second attempt at the move as an earlier attempt saw Chavo drive both knees into his guts! OUCH!

Kurt Angle Vs. Booker T. - These two have had great matches in the past. While this one was a good bout, I felt the ""stalker"" angle really took away from this! Angle doesn't need gimicks like that and whoever thought this was a good idea needed to be shot! Not that Sharmell isn't hot (I personally think so) but Kurt has a hot wife, why would he want Booker's!?

Anyway, if you can ignore that terrible angle, this actually was a good bout! Ends with Sharmell gets her revenge on Kurt with a vicious kick!

Orlando Jordan Vs. Heidenreich (WWE U.S. Title Match) - Worst match on the card! Neither man is/was even a 3 star wrestler! Orlando had to be one of the worst U.S. Champions ever! He had a great body but that's it! I know he's not looked upon fondly these days but thank goodness Chris Benoit got the belt off of him a few months later!

Back to this, its worth one view (if that).

Eddie Gurerro (RIP) Vs. Rey Mysterio - This match was much better than their previous WrestleMania 21 encounter. It was longer and it had better psychology in it. After Rey wins, Eddie beats the holly crap about of him and leaves the arena speechless!

John Cena Vs. JBL (WWE Title Match/I Quit Rules) - As I said at the outset, I am not a big fan of John Cena but as another reviewer (D.P.) has pointed out many times, Cena does his best work when the rules are thrown out! Plus, for those that say Cena isn't hardcore, they need to take a look at this match! Both men use weapons and Cena bleeds like a stuck pig! Think Great Muta Vs. Hiro Hase from 1992 in Japan or Undertaker Vs. Brock Lesner in Hell In The Cell in 2002 to get an idea of what kind of bleeding I am talking about!

The ending was rather weak but it was still a great match!

Overall, the card (except for Orlando Vs. Heidenreich) was great! Worth the money!",1206144000,,2831,4.251396648044692
2299803,4,B0009MAPVS,"Charlie Haas and Hardcore Holly VS MNM: A very good opener; as Michael Cole stated what a way to kick off Judgement Day!

Carlito (with Matt Morgan) VS Big Show: Hard to believe WWE never did anything with Morgan and now's a star in TNA. I didn't expect too much from this match. Show dominates the entire match but Morgan interferes a few times and then Morgan f-5's Show, Carlito covers him and wins. A short match that was alright. Amazing WWE let Morgan go.

Chavo Guerrero VS Paul London for the Cruiserweight title: This was anther short match. Decent match, the ending was cool.

Kurt Angle VS Booker T: Angle has been making moves on Booker T's wife, so naturally Booker wanted revenge. I don't care for Booker T, like watching Kurt Angle matches, but this match sucked. Sharmell interferes and gets handcuffed to the ring ropes by Angle, but she escapes and they handcuff Angle to the ropes and Booker T beats him. Stupid match, hated the storyline.

Orlando Jordan VS Heidenreich: This match sucked

Eddie Guerrero VS Rey Mysterio: Liked the story going into this match. Have you ever seen a bad match between these guys? Neither have I. Awesome match and saved the PPV from being worthless. Loved the ending as well, helluva ride.

JBL VS John Cena: I raved about how this was a great match. I'm watching it once again to see if my mind changed. JBL is still in shape and one of the best heels in Smackdown history. Yes, it was a classic match and I still love it.

Overall, the opening match was good but things sucked until Guerrero/Mysterio and JBL/Cena. There are alot of good extras on this dvd, a must own even though the middle of the card sucked.",1153353600,,1665,4.53

2299805,3,B0009MAPVS,"Judgment Day 2005 reminded me of the one the previous year (which I saw LIVE)...only four great matches and the rest were fillers that honestly, you could only watch once...if that.

Tag Team Champions MNM vs. Hardcore Holly & Charlie Hass - Honestly, I just didn't care for this match.  Sorry but it's decent at best.

Big Show vs. Carlito - Another ""put a storyline over"" match as Show just dominated Carlito until M-M-M-M-M-Matt Morgan (those who remember his gimmick will get the joke) interfeared with an F5 for Carlito to win.  Besides Morgan's F5, nothing else to talk about.

Crusierweight Champion Paul London vs. Chavo Guerrero - Great crusierweight match from start to finish.  This is what you can get when you actually push the division.

Booker T vs. Kurt Angle - How Kurt Angle went from having a match of the year with HBK to a ""sexual preditor"" storyline with Booker T's wife is beyond me but storyline aside...this was great match #2 as Booker brought his A game along with Kurt Angle.

United States Champion Orlando Jordan vs. Heidenrich - Slow & boring between two GREEN wrestlers.  Skip.

Rey Mysterio vs. Eddie Guerrero - Another great match between these two with nice in-ring storytelling.  This is the best Eddie has ever been as a heel.

I Quit Match: WWE Champion John Cena vs. J.B.L. - This HEAVILY made up for their WM match and then some.  They went all over the ring & stage using various hardcore weapons.  This match was awesome all the up until the ""I Quit"" ending but it doesn't take away from the match.

DVD extras (that I remember) include Cena's ""Bad Bad Man"" video & the behind the scenes making of it, a J.B.L. anti-Cena promo, and a FUNNY backstage interview with Carlito & Matt Morgan.

The good matches were the Crusierweight title match, and the 3 main events but the rest were heavily filler & boring so I just suggest this for a video rental.",1150502400,2,1890,4.61377245508982
2299816,4,B0009MAPVS,"WWE Tag Team Title Match

MNM vs. Charlie Hass and Hardcore Holly

Pretty decent opener. Lots of back and forth action with MNM retaining the Tag Team Titles.

Big Show vs. Carlito with Matt Morgan

Pretty disappointing match. Show should have won this match with little to no problem. Matt Morgan interferes and hits the Big Show with an F-5. (Wasn't his move a sit down Powerbomb?) Carlito picks up the scraps and the victory.

Cruiserweight Title Match

Paul London vs. Chavo Guerrero

Very fast paced match! Lots of high flying action in this one. These 2 could have had a great rivalry if Chavo did not get traded to Raw. Paul London retains the title.

Booker T vs. Kurt Angle

Not a bad match. Stupid storyline though. Angle does not play a love-sick pervert very well. Booker T wins the match and Booker's wife, Sharmell gets her revenge.

United States Title Match

Orlando Jordan vs. Heidenreich

Absolutely terrible match. Two guys who should not have even made it off Velocity fighting  for the U.S. Title mid-way through the PPV? WASTE of time. If you care, Jordan wins with a DDT.

Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio

Match of the night! The only bad thing about this match was the DQ ending. Other then that, teriffic match. These guys really stole the show!

Much better than expected all the way. Probably JBLs best match that was thanks to rules and Cena punishing him. Excellent match with an excellent result to top off an excellent pay per view.

MnM vs. Haas and Holly- Smart opener but I knew MnM were going to win

Paul London vs. Chavo- Good Crusierweight fight, I enjoyed it.

Big Show vs. Carlito- Not very good. Big Show had the match won until Matt Morgan ruined it. (Morgan was their to make the fans forget about Brock Lesner when he used the F-5 on the Big Show, it's true because shortly after, Mogan quiet WWE just when he debuted.)

Booker T vs. Kurt Angle- Good Match with a funny ending where Angle's plan to cuff Booker's wife to the ropes back fires.

Jorden vs. Heidenright(I can't spell his name)- This was intersting but not good. I wasn't to into the match.

Eddie vs. Rey- Good match with a BAD STORYLINE. The story had Eddie play a poinetless heel, and to make it worse, this same  storyline would go on until SummerSlam.

1) Hardcore Holly and Charlie Haas vs MNM - this exceeded my expectations and turned out to be a very hot opener. Everybody just seemed to be on and the chemistry was great. Charlie's dive over the tope rope was amazing - 8/10

2) Big Show vs Carlito - not much of a match but it did what it needed to do, and thats put Carlito over. The F5 by Morgan after the match was a great, and unexpected spot - 5/10

3) Paul London vs Chavo - I was expecting a **** match here but something doesn't seem to click. Don't get me wrong this is a good match but it had the potential to be much better - 7.5/10

4) Kurt Angle vs Booker T - due to the stupid storyline with this match I wasn't really that bothered, because lets face it when was the last time Booker T had a good/great single match? This actually turned out to be a good match, as you would expect with Angle being involved. I just don't understand why they had Booker T go over in this one, its not like they are going to do anything with him - 8/10

5) Heidenreich vs Orlando Jordon - firstly you have heidenreich who will never get over (he only gets cheered now because he is with Animal), and then you have the US champ who draws no heat whatsoever from the corwd during his match. A boring match, simple as that - 3/10

6) Rey Mysterio vs Eddie - I think both these guys are awesome but this whole fued just bored me, but even the dumb story can't take anything away from this match. It is betterv than their good mania match no doubt, but the ending to me was dissapointing - 8.5/10

7) John Cena vs JBL - I had doubts as to how good this match would be considering their poor mania match but boy was this a good match. WWE were clever and realised that a normal singles match would have bombed because lets face it JBL is no Kurt Angle. Both men made good use of the weapons available to them and it certainly helped that Cena bled a lot, still not as much as Eddie did last year though. The ending seemed a tad anti climatic but the aim was to put Cena over strong and that is exactly what they did here - 9/10

2299833,3,B0009MAPVS,"Hello and welcome to my review on Judgement Day 2005. I use a grading system and each match receives a grade. Then to determine how the show ranks the total of the matches scores are divided by the number of matches giving the grade and a comment about whether you should buy it or not. The grading system is as follows.

Grading E- = 0 - 8.33%-Waste of time and money.

  E  = 8.33 - 16.66%-Waste of time and money.

  E+ = 16.66 - 24.99%-Waste of time and money.

  D- = 24.99 - 33.32%-Very poor event maybe read about it.

  D  = 33.32 - 41.65%-Poor event with a little something standing out.

  D+ = 41.65 - 50%-Not a very good event but it just below passing.

  C- = 50 - 55.55%-Just below average worth a watch.

  C  = 55.55 - 61%-An average event worth a renting.

  C+ = 61 - 66.65%-Above average worth a purchase if you can find it for cheap.

  B- = 66.65 - 72.20%-Good event with a lot of good stuff. Purchase if you're a collector or interested.

  B  = 72.20 - 77.75%-Good quality event which is worth purchase and should be collected.

  B+ = 77.75 - 83.30%-Very high quality event with awesome matches. Must have for anyone.

  A- = 83.30 - 88.85%-Excellent event, must have for anyone. Lock this one away.

  A  = 88.85 - 94.40%-Extremely spectacular event with lots of great stuff. Lock this away.

  A+ = 94.40 - 100%-DVD of the century, must buy and keep in a very safe place.

Match One-WWE Tag Team Championships-Johnny Nitro & Joey Mercury(C)Vs Charlie Haas & Hardcore Holly-This match was a nice opener to the PPV. Hardcore shouldn't be mucking round like this, he should be in a hardcore division(remember the days),except there isn't one,Charlie should be the US champ,MNM(Melina,Nitro,Mercury)are an excellent team, they put on a fairly good quality match, it was a great choice for opener and it kept me on the edge of my seat. My rating 7.19/10.

Match Two-Carlito Vs Big Show-This was another nice match, except this one was a lot more ordinary, Carlito has talent(too bad he's an injury prone wrestler)and should be getting a good steady push up the ladder to the top. This also was a nice way to use Carlito's b-b-b-bodyguard Matt Morgan the walking stutterbox(absolutely golden extra with them). I'm glad this was kept short as any longer it would have lost its effect. My rating 6.31/10.

Match Three-Cruiserweight Championship-Paul London(C)Vs Chavo Guerrero-This match was a great cruiserweight match with lots of risks and high flying spots and bumps taken. The whole feud was nice except it should be one of the bright things on Smackdown, not just a bright spot on Velocity. Keep these two having a nice feud with some great matches to come. My rating 8.01/10.

Match Four-Booker T Vs Kurt Angle-This was a good match with two good wrestlers, except one thing, the storyline sucked. Kurt isn't that type of man wanting to do things with Bookers wife, he's the real american he is. These two put on a good match but its not as good as what they could have done. My rating 7.71/10.

Match Five-U.S Title-Orlando Jordan(C)Vs Heidenreich-This match was just a plain filler. There was no real storyline, one thing happens so they ""settle"" it at Judgement Day. This was a short not exciting match, it was about the same excitement as Carlito Vs Show earlier. My rating 5.71/10.

Match Six-Rey Mysterio Vs Eddie Guerrero-This is what Judgement Day's about, brutal,emotion filled brawls without over pushing it, these two put on a magnificient show, an absolute gem of a match, this is one of the best matches on a Smackdown PPV this year. My rating 8.71/10.

Match Seven-Main Event-I Quit Match-WWE Championship-John Cena(C)Vs JBL-This was a bloody brutal brawl with lots of great spots and action. They both put on a show and were both bleeding bad by the end of this match. Hopefully they don't do many more matches again cause they're not the most talented wrestlers around. Great way to end this show. My rating 9.30/10.

There we have it Judgement Day 2005, now lets see how it went in the scoring department, the score is 52.94 out of 70 which in a percentage is equal to 66.17%. The grading for this is C+ Above average worth a purchase if you can find it for cheap. I agree with the comment, it has two great matches to end, the rest of the matches are fairly good except the Big Show Vs Carlito Match and the US title match.

It certainly out did anything the brand put on in 2004 and was head and shoulders better than No Way Out in Feb.

WWE Cruserweight Championship

Paul London v. Chavo Guererro

This was SUPPOSED to be on the Wrestlemania card, but London got injured just before the event and the match had to be put off two months. Considering the talent, you'd expect this to be a barn burner. Unfortunately, the two came up very short, although they certainly didn't stink out the arena by any means. London sold like crazy and Chavo played the heel of course trying to steal the title at any costs from London. THe chemistry didn't seem to be there and booking obviously limited the length of this match greatly.

Rating: **

United States Championship

Orlando Jordan v. Heidenreich

Heidenreich's face turn has somehow given his character a shade of new life. While smarks still shun the man, marks pop for his over the top cheesy antics in the ring. Orlando Jordan on the other hand, has had an incredibly bland run with the US title part of which blame rests with WWE creative for not coming up with ANYTHING for him to do, and partly on OJ as well for not doing more with the little time he's had.

As for the match itself, it's pretty poor. OJ, who's an average worker at best attempts to carry Heidenreich to something watchable, although given Heidenreich's total lack of in ring ability, it proved to be an impossible task. Nothing great here at all.

Rating: *

WWE Tag Team Championship

MNM (c) v. Charlie Haas and Hardcore Holly

This was suprisingly good. Actually it was VERY good. There's some great psychology here and Charlie Haas pops the crowd with a grizly looking suicide dive through the ropes. Fun match from start to finish.

Rating: **3/4

Big Show v. Carlito

Sluggish isn't the word for this match. Thank god it was kept short and reletively painless.

Rating: *

Booker T v. Kurt Angle

THis came off very well, especially considering the awful storyline that led up to the match itself, featuring Kurt Angle basically try to drool all over Booker T's wife Sharmell as much as possible. Booker T is a worker that folks either work with or just plain don't, but this one came out fairly decent. Angle carried most of the match but Booker T showed signs of his old self in parts. The ending is particularly suprising, but none the less, a solid match.

Rating: **3/4

Rey Mysterio v. Eddie Guererro

These two worked an absolutely outstanding match. Most people ride this match for the DQ ending, but I felt it was very appropriate. It got over Eddie's brutality and Rey's perserverance. It did the trick although fans didn't get the end result that they wanted. The ending IS a tad akward, but worked enough to make this a quality piece of work.

Rating: ***1/2

WWE Championship-- I Quit Match

John Cena (c) v. JBL

This is quite possibly the best pure brawl i've ever seen in the WWE. The two really made up for their Wrestlemania 21 mistep and put on what is, as of this writing (8/05) probobly #2 or #3 match of the year. If you're a wrestling purist you'll hate this. There's really no arm, leg, or even a headlock... just two guys beating the hell out of each other. THe match closely resembled that of JBL-Eddie at JD from a year ago, with a sick blade job and the same spot being used to start the bleeding. JBL comes off as relentless but unable to put away the younger, more determined Cena. The match is essentially JBL controlling, and Cena connecting with a big spot. The ending is certainly akward, but works no less. This is really a career outing for both guys. Great work in this match. The rating is a tad high in all reality, but they get the kudos for rebounding as well as they did, BOTH guys putting on career performances, and it just being one insane brawl.

Rating: ****1/4

Judgement Day is a great pay per view with every match right around the *** range. This is a very good show top to bottom and no doubt about it, again from top to bottom, is probobly the most solid single brand pay per view the WWE has put on since late 2003. This is definately worth a buy as it marks the official emergence of John Cena as a bonafide main eventer, which really stakes it's historical significance. Again, not quite up to Wrestlemania 21 or even really the ROyal Rumble, but still pretty darn good.",1123372800,2,4510,4.501840490797546

Carlito w/ Matt Morgan vs Big Show 6/10- the only thing that saves this one is the entertainment of it. Carlito can't wrestle & is no match for Show. Morgan is trying to be the next Brock Lesnar.

backstage locker room segment with Booker T & Sharmell.

WWE Cruiserweight Championship

Paul London vs Chavo Guerrero 7/10- a fairly decent match but these 2 can do much better. London needs to go back to what brought him to the dance. drop the stupid Ultimate Warrior mixed with typical Indian stereotype wrestler gimmick. this match has a few bright moments that save it from being a flop.

Booker T backstage looking for Kurt Angle segment after Kurt has a present delivered to Sharmell. Angle surprises Sharmell in her locker room.

Kurt Angle vs Booker T 9/10- an excellent match between 2 good ones. the storyline to this match adds fuel to it. Angle as a predator to Sharmell is disgusting. Kurt is ruining his career doing this storyline. a surprise ending & a fabulous aftermath.

Sharmell overplays the victim role but it has you hating Angle because of it.

United States Championship

Orlando Jordan vs Heidenreich 5/10- John Heidenreich as an overgrown child is actually pretty funny. Jordan is ruining the U.S. title. He can't wrestle; neither can Heiden. who wants to be Heidenreich's friend is the only interesting part of the bout.

Eddie Guerrero vs Rey Mysterio 8.5/10- this had the potential to be the match of the year but fell way short. both men were serious & not playing around. Mysterio as a brawler & ground wrestler is not his cup of tea. lame ending also hurts this match but it helps in building the story further. is something wrong with Guerrero, such as drugs, or is he playing the storyline?

WWE Championship

John Cena vs John Bradshaw Layfield 9.5/10- i was not looking forward to this matchup due to the fact that Cena is probably the worst worker in WWE history. I WAS WRONG! this match was awesome. if you like brutality, this is your match to watch. I Quit matches are brutal & always intense. blood flows as everything but the kitchen sink is employed. after viewing this, i must say that Cena has earned my respect as a good worker. this 2 let it all hang out. the lame ending keeps this from being a 10.

Akio vs Nunzio 7.5/10- an interesting match from Heat. this should have been on the PPV so it could have had more time. this 2 are great performers.

WWE Tag Team Championships

MNM [Champions] vs. Hardcore Holly and Charlie Hass:

Right now the only tag team left on Smackdown is MNM. Charlie Hass was let go, the Bashams were separated, and the Dudley Boyz aren't returning any time soon. Anyway, this was  a good opener for the show. The crowd was very into it and some great wrestling moves by all four men. Charlie even dives over the top rope onto Nitro and Mercury. In the end MNM uses the Snapshot on Hass to win. 8/10

Big Show vs. Carlito:

Both these men are now on Raw. In the match the Big Show just tossed Carlito around the whole ring with some funny facial expressions by Carlito after getting chops by the Big Show repeatedly. The referee gets knocked down and Morgan comes in and gives the Big Show an F5 to have Carlito pin Show to win. 6.5/10

Crusierweight Championship

Paul London [Champion] vs. Chavo Guerrero:

Too short, in my opinion, but good for crusierweight fans. The crusierweight division is now dead since Akio, Shannon Moore, Billy Kidman, and Spike Dudley were let go as well. Chavo is now on RAW [Whats with the Kerwin White deal anyway?]

Highlights include a wicked 450 splash by London, only to come down on Chavo's knees! Both men take high risks as they each dive off the ring ropes onto each other. In the end Paul London does another 450 splash to win.

Kurt Angle vs. Booker T:

Thank God Kurt is now back to being the Kurt on a role, the whole stalker gimmick was really hurting him. Back and forth action, with some good wresling holds by Kurt, and Booker T's wife at ringside. In the end Booker T actually handcuffs Angle to the ring ropes and Sharmell kicks the crap out of Kurt. Booker T wins. 7.5/10

USA Championship Match

Orlando Jordon [Champion] vs. Heidenreich:

Not much of a match, Heidenreich was looking for a new friend and the wreslting just wasn't worthy of a ppv. Short match and Heidenreich loses, definately the worst match of the night. 3/10

Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio:

Better than their match at WM 21. Both men really work well together. High flying moves and the crowd was really behind Rey. The match was long and was the second best match of the night. In the end Rey wins and Eddie beats the crap out of Rey with a steel chair, even as referees tried to hold him back. 8.5/10 [After the match the crowd gave Rey a standing ovation.]

WWE Championship

I Quit Match

John Cena [Champion] vs. JBL

What a match, so many weapons and hard hitting spots were in this one. John Cena backdrops JBL onto an announce table, JBL uses a belt, a chair, and the steel steps on Cena. John Cena throws JBL's head through a TV screen and then his limo window.

Both men get cut open and John Cena bleeds almost as heavily as Eddie last year. JBL goes through a table, Cena gets a swinging neckbreaker on top of the limo's hood, very good match. However the ending brought it down a little, as JBL quits out of nowhere as Cena grabs the exhaust pipe of the truck he came on and started stalking him. Cena then grabs the pipe and throws JBL through a glass set. 9/10 [Would have been a perfect score if not for the ending.]

Judgement Day was worth it on DVD, the main event will probably be on a Best of John Cena in the near future, so if you want to buy it just for that match I suggest you wait.",1121040000,,3651,4.360413589364845

2299854,5,B0009MAPVS,"Ok, Judgement Day 2005 was kinda good. Here are the matches.

1st Match

Ladder Match for the US championship

Shannon Moore vs Big Show

-Great moves by Shannon, he had to carry B.S(as in Big Show or Bull $#!t) for the whole match. Big Show tries to chokeslam Shannon but Moore counters into an RKO, and goes up the ladder to get the title. Nice opening. 5/10

2nd Match

Royal Rumble

-The WWE had a service and made a 10 man Royal Rumble match. The winner gets to face the WWE/WHW champ next week.

#1 entry was Nunzio, and he fought with JBL who was the 2nd entry. Nunzio does F-U to JBL and then he suddenly does the People's Elbow. The crowd was on their feet and the roof was coming off.

3rd entry was Eugene. Eugene comes and eliminates JBL, and than hugs Nunzio for 90 seconds. 4th entry comes who was Christian, and Christian dominates the ring by doing the un-prettier to Eugene and Nunzio. Christian eliminates Eugene, and he tries to eliminate Nunzio but Nunzio hanged on. Entry #5 comes and guess what? It was Steven Richards! Richards does a Hulk-Up Combination to Christian. And than he does the french-tickler to CLB. 6th entry was on their way, and she was Christy Hemme. Christy does a Sweet Chin Music to Richards, and then she does a Tombstone Piledriver to Christian. And when she turned around, Nunzio does a Rock Bottom to her! Nunzio eliminates Christy, and the 7th entry came.

Entry 7 was Charlie Haas, and he revealed his macho body to the whole world. He said, ""I was wearing a body-look-a-like outfit to hide my real body. The Charlie saids he is gonna kick those roody-poo. You know I can, 'cuz I'm that damn good!"" he goes in the ring and does a pedigree to Richards. He then goes to Nunzio, and tries to do Walls of Jericho, but does not connect. Instead, Nunzio stunners Haas and haas goes right over the top rope and gets him self eliminated. Nunzio then eliminates Richards, and Booker T comes as 8th entry. Booker does a scissors kick to Nunzio. Christian and Nunzio are down, so he does a spin roonie and spins like 30 times. While he was spinning, the 9th entry came, who was Paul London. Paul gets to the top of the turnbackle and boom! Does an 810 degrees splash to Booker T who was spinning, and the ring breaks. Then London eliminates Booker. And the 10th entry's music comes from the titron. Oh my gosh! Can it be?! Its Linda Mcmahon! Linda comes and tries to eliminate London but he lands on the side of the ring. Then Linda slapped London and he flew and spinned 3 times in the air and got eliminated. Linda goes to Christian and chokeslams him from hell! The ring breaks just like when Brock Lesner broke the ring when he suplexed the Big Show from the top turnbackle. Linda eliminates Christian. It was up to Linda and Nunzio now. Suddenly, Linda dashes toward Nunzio and tries to spear but Nunzio counterd by leg toe-hold and made Linda fell into the middle rope. Dial up! Because here comes the 619! Nunzio connects 619 and does a west coast pop to Linda. Linda suddenly comes up like she never was hurt, and she does a F-5 to Nunzio! Nunzio was busted open, and he looked like he wasn't breathing after he took the F-5. Linda makes Nunzio stand up, and suddenly he takes Linda's anckle and anckle lock is locked in! Linda is screaming in pain and she tappes out. Her finger breaks because she was tapping too hard. Nunzio breaks her anckle and Linda becomes unconcious. Nunzio eliminates Linda and Nunzio becomes the #1 contender. 10/10

3rd Match

Eddie Guerrerro vs Rey Mysterio

This match was very good, as time of the match was 14 minutes. Very high paced match from the beginning. What hurt was that Mysterio's mask flew off and the whole world had to know that he was bold. Eddie wins by the 3rd frog splash on Rey. 10/10

4th Match

Interpromotional Match for the World HeavyWeight Championship

Melina vs Triple H

-Triple H carried the whole match, but there was some good effort by Melina. When Triple H was going to do the pedigree(ref knocked down), Mercury and Nitro came and does snapshot. Melina goes for the cover and ref comes and does the count. 1..... 2..... th- no! Triple H kicked out! Triple H pedigreed Melina and retained the title. 5/10

5th Match

I Quit Match for the WWE championship

John Cena vs Kurt Angle

-Kurt hit John Cena on the turnbackle(not exposed) and John Cena fainted. Kurt then pinned him for the 1, 2, 3. The match was only 14 seconds, which is too short. And the only move that was in the match was Cena's one punch and Kurt's putting cena's head on the turnbackle move. 1/10

6th Match

Hell in a Cell Match by Raw

Val Venis vs Simon Dean

-This match changed the meaning of brutality. The first spotlight was when Val Venis took a ladder from under the ring, went on the top of the ladder and did a Shooting Star Press on Simon Dean! The 2nd was when they were on top of the cell. Simon did a Simon Bomb to Val Venis and the cell broke and Val went down crashing into the floor(not the rijng, but floor!). Everybody thought Val died, but he stood up just like Hulk Hogan did. But not for long, when Simon Dean jumped from the top of the cell and did a hurricane runna to Val. They went back to the ring, and Simon covered Val. Val kicked out, but it looked like he didn't have any more energy. Simon did a Simon Crasher(another one of his special moves) and the ring broke. Simon pinned Val and beated Val. Great match, as it was very fast paced from the beginning. 10/10

Overall, its 41/60, which is 64%. It wouldve been good if there wasn't the match by John Cena and Angle. I recommend a lot for the dvd because the Rumble match is very exciting, and Eddie vs Rey is a MOTY candidate, and HIAC is awesome.",1120176000,,5711,4.384469696969697

Heidenreich vs. Orlando Jordan - U.S. Championship - God, why please explain this to me god, Orlando is a horrible champion, and neither can wrestle worth a crap, I think Heidenreich's friend should be taking some Ritalin. Thankfully this was only 5 minutes. DUD

Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio - Awesome promo before the match.

The bonuses of the DVD were awesome. I liked the interview between Carlito and Matt Morgan , that was so funny! I give some points for the extras.

*BONUS POINTS* +2.5

So the total adds up to *57.1* out of 70. That will be 81%, which means this PPV is *good*. I think this score is pretty good for this PPV, but I hope John Cena loses his title one day.",1119830400,3,3252,4.4033613445378155

2. Carlito vs Big Show- Funny match with Big Show beating Carlito the whole match. At the end the new Brock Lesnar comes (Matt Morgan) and hits the F5 on the Big Show. Carlito crawls and pins the Big Show.

3. Paul London vs Chavo Gurrero- The cruserweight division was good but now it is sinking. Paul London wins in an ok match.

4. Kurt Angle vs Booker T- Good match. Kurt Angle is good and should have won. Kurt Angle is still good and Booker T is a hasbeen. Booker T wins with a rollup. Sharmell slaps and beats Kurt after the match.

5. Heidenreich vs Orlando Jordan- Good match and a very quiet match, no reaction. OJ wins.

6. Eddie Gurrero vs Rey Mysterio- Good job chavo you got Eddie to become a heel. Rey wins in a good match. Eddie beats Rey after the match with a chair.

7. JBL vs John Cena- WOW! very bloody. John Cena was bleeding a lot! I've never seen John Cena bleed like this. His first barbairic match. Both men were eager to win but Cena wins in a long match. Nice entrance by Cena!",1118448000,,1150,4.134529147982063

Match #2 Big Show vs. Carlito w/ Matt Morgan: You knew who was gonna win here. Carlito showed how much he sucks in the ring, but Matt Morgan impressed the hell out of me when he F-5'd Show!!! Carlito gets the pin... 5/10

Match #3 Paul London (c) vs. Chavo Guererro for the Cruiserweight Championship: Paul London is phenominal but they seriously need to get him some better opponents...the Smackdown! Cruiserweight division sucks and they proved it here. Bring in Kazarian already, or make Shannon Moore heel! Chavo sucks and this match fell flat. London retains after a 450. 6/10

Match #4 Booker T w/ Sharmell vs. Kurt Angle: Was a pretty good match, and went about 15 minutes. Kurt is the man, and so is Booker T...but this match was built around a horrible story line that is ruining Kurt's character more and more every week! Booker T wins in a botched ending, and then handcuffs Kurt to the ropes and he and Sharmell beat the living hell out of him... 7/10

Match #5 Heidenreich vs. Orlando Jordan (c) for the US Title: A lot better then I thought it would be, but another example of how bad Smackdown's creative team is, just throwing crap together. We all knew Heidi didn't stand a chance, but put in a good effort. The little girl he brought in was crazy! Orlando retains (and a horrible US Champ at that). 6/10

Match #6 Eddie Guererro vs. Rey Mysterio: This was great as I knew it would be. In my opinion, Eddie kicked Rey's ass but some might see it differently. The DQ ending was actually very smart because you knew Rey wasn't going to lose and that Eddie should not have lost clean! So yeah Rey wins by DQ after almost 20 minutes of greatness! 9.5/10

Match #7 JBL vs. John Cena (c) in and ""I Quit"" match for the WWE Championship: Better then I thought it would be, but not a classic. I'm a huge JBL fan, but him and Cena just don't cut it together in the ring! Cena was busted open early and bled BUCKETS all over the place. Decent up until the crappy ending where JBL just suddenly quit! How bad does that make the man who carried Smackdown on his back for the last 10 months? JBL screwed yet again and would have been a perfect match had it ended in a No Contest or something...Cena retains. 9/10

So Judgement Day gets a 49.5/70 giving it a C-...doesn't look to good on paper, but I guess you'll just have to see it for yourself cuz visually it wasn't that bad. Thanks!",1117670400,2,2579,4.360416666666667

2299881,1,B0009MAPVS,"WWE is so stupid.  I can't believe people actually think that this crap is actually entertaining.  WWE is so political and Vince mcmahon has only tried to do one thing and that is to monopolize the wrestling industry.  John cena is possibly the worst and most boring wrestler besides carlito and heidenreich.  jbl isn't great either.  why don't you watch the final airing of tna impact on fox sports net on friday afternoon and you tell me which is more exciting.  then see that tna is on the rise and that they are getting a better tv deal.  but seriously, the only match that kept me from falling asleep was the paul london match.  i'll be honest i was very biased towards that match because i've been following paul london for a while as i've seen about 10 of his matches from ring of honor.  watch tna people.  if you think this poor excuse of ""wrestling"" is good, then you might actually like real wrestling.  watch the x division which features guys like chris sabin, christopher daniels, michael shane, the canadian destroyer petey williams, and countless others.  watch the new nwa heavyweight champ aj styles.",1117065600,,1118,4.676923076923077

WWE Tag Team Championship
MNM Vs. Hardcore Holly & Charlie Haas - Solid opening bout and a great match that did it's job. Both teams put in a good effort to get the crowd motivated and they did a good job at that. Nothing really bad to say about this match. Both teams did their job here and this was a solid opening match. MNM hits Haas with the Snap Shot to retain the Tag Team Titles. 3.5/5

Carlito Vs. The Big Show - This match is basically squash material with the Big Show dominating Carlito all the way through until the referee gets knocked down and Matt Morgan interferes and hits the Big Show with Brock Lesnar's F5 finishing move to give Carlito the win. Nothing special here besides seeing Matt Morgan delivering the F5 to the Big Show. 2/5

WWE Cruiserweight Championship
Paul London Vs. Chavo Guerrero - Great Match! Chavo and London delivered a great cruiserweight match with both men pulling out all the stops. Great moves from both men and this was just a non-stop, great cruiserweight match. Ends with London hitting the 450 Splash to Chavo after previously missing with it earlier in the match. 4.5/5

Kurt Angle Vs. Booker T - After Booker T was given the shaft from not competing at WrestleMania, he was thrown into this idiotic ""Kurt stalking Sharmell"" storyline with Kurt Angle. Thankfully, the match delivered. This was a very good back and forth contest with a few good spots to look out for. This was a great match with Booker T and Angle bringing their best effort to the match. If you can get past the stupid storyline, this is a fairly enjoyable match. 4/5

United States Championship
Orlando Jordan Vs. Heidenreich - The WORST match of the night. Neither men are good wrestlers and Orlando Jordan has to be one of the worst U.S. Champions ever! A total dud match and this was a bad match to display the prestige of the United States Championship. Horrible match, not even worth viewing. 1/5

Eddie Guerrero Vs. Rey Mysterio - This was a far better match then their meeting at WrestleMania. Not saying their match at WrestleMania was a bad one but this match was better in terms of psychology, match quality, and match duration. You can see Eddie was in full heel mode here as the match progressed and the bitterness Eddie was showing towards Rey Mysterio. Both men told a good in-ring story as Rey was selling his rib injury and Eddie selling this new vicious and insane personality he now has. It ends with Eddie Guerrero getting himself disqualified and beating the mess out of Rey Mysterio with a steel chair. Overall, this was a great one on one battle from these two. 4.75/5

I Quit Match for the WWE Championship
John Cena Vs. John ""Bradshaw"" Layfield - This match heavily made up for their lousy WWE Title Match at WrestleMania. Overall, this match was just a bloody and brutal fight. Both men takes some hard punishment from one another but both Cena and Bradshaw kept coming back fighting strong. Once Cena and Bradshaw introduced the weapons, the match became very hardcore. The ""I Quit"" ending was a little weak but it doesn't take away from the great WWE Title main event both performers put on. Great main event and a great WWE Title Match! 5/5

Overall, with the exception of Big Show/Carlito and Heidenreich/Jordan matches, the PPV is pretty good. This is a PPV that I recommend checking out sometime.",1244592000,,3607,4.598755832037325
8063103,4,B0009MAPVS,"...That title caught your attention, didn't it?

I actually have always felt John Cena 'can' wrestle, but that either WWE executives or Cena's character don't let him compete the amateur style he debuted with.

But that's a subject I'll save for the end.  JUDGMENT DAY 2005 was Cena's first main event match (excluding Royal Rumbles).  There's some other good stuff I'm gonna get to, but for those who think Cena is an overrated success story, I think even you'll forgive him for one night only.

But until then, here's what's in store for you:

1) WWE Tag Team Championships
MNM (champions) v. Hardcore Holly & Charlie Haas
---Our wrestlers actually enter the ring before there's even a ""welcome-to-the-show"" pyro.  Weird, huh?  Anyway, I'll cut to the chase: this match is very, very good!  I've always been a mark for Mercury, Nitro, & Melina; they were a good-looking trio of self-involved who could compete and talk trash.  Holly & Haas are better in tag action than in singles matches.  So, do the math.  What ingredients do I always want from openers?  Fast pace, high-risk spots, wild crowd, false finishes...etc, etc.  It ends a little sooner than I'd like, but I'm not kidding when I cal this exciting contest one of nmy favorites from the JUDGMENT DAY series.
""8.0 / 10""

-----------------------------------------------

2) Carlito (w/ Matt Morgan) v. Big Show
---You're smart enough to know how this match plays out, but I don't think you realize how well each of these three guys pulls it off.  Carlito just gets a ridiculous amount of punishment, and is hopelessly mismatched against the ""World's Largest Athlete"".  But his stuttering accomplice, Matt Morgan, delivers a few impressive moves to even the odds.  The crowd was loving every second of this.  They were in awe of Morgan's strength.  I was having a pretty good time, too.  Not a great phyiscal match, but great physical comedy.
""6.0 / 10""

-----------------------------------------------

3) Cruiserweight Championship
Chavo Guerrero v. Paul London (champion)
---My favorite aspect of this match is how long it was.  I know that sounds weird, but this was a Cruiserweight match that never ends when you think it will.  In a way that's a bad thing, because London took a huge amount of punishment from Chavo before making his ill-fated comebacks.  Just when the champ regained momentum, the challenger would regain the edge.  But when London finally makes his comeback, you feel physically exhausted just watching him defend his title.  This Cruiserweight match is more grounded, but it's all part of a sweet package that includes those high-flying spots we expect from athletes like Chavo & London.
""7.0 / 10""

-----------------------------------------------

4) Kurt Angle v. Booker T
---If I've ever seen a mixed bag, this grudge match would definitely be it.  First, I have to address the storyline.  The whole angle involved Angle stalking Booker's wife, Sharmell.  It's so weird watching him have his WRESTLEMANIA classic against Shawn Michaels, then becoming a sexual predator, and then going back to an Olympic tough guy a few months after this PPV.  Anyway, I kinda liked the storyline, but I think some will be offended by its content.  Now, here's where things get really weird.  After some straight-up fighting between Angle & Booker, the whole match proceeds as if the storyline never happened.  Why in the world would Angle start using his amateur arsenal when he's trying to get Sharmell?  Why would Booker start using pinfalls & ""Spineroonies"" when his opponent is trying to rape his wife?  At least the post-match beatdown was worth the wait.  Here's the deal: the match is average even if there were no storyline.
""6.0 / 10""

-----------------------------------------------

5) United States Championship
Orlando Jones (champion) v. Heidenreich
---I'm gonna go easy on what most will surely call the worst match of the PPV.  Frankly, Heidenreich's poem-reading persona was pretty funny, as was his VERY enthusastic Minneapolis ringside fan.  Man, that girl was really into the match.  Anyway, the match is nothing special, and probably won't be very entertaining to many people.  I wasn't bored, so maybe there's hope after all.  On a side note, Jordan's next U.S. Title Match against Chris Benoit at GREAT AMERICAN BASH is a good one.  Check that one out.
""5.0 / 10""

-----------------------------------------------

6) Eddie Guerrero v. Rey Mysterio
---There's really nothing I can say that nobody else has.  I always love watching these two perform, with this 2005 rivalry being my favorite.  It included the friendly skirmish, this grudge match, a Ladder Match, and a couple other showcases -- in other words, we got to see everything from these two men before Eddie's untimely passing.  The match itself is just as remarkable as their other performances.  If you're expecting a high-flying extranvangza from their WCW or even ""SmackDown Six"" days, be aware that this is more like their WRESTLEMANIA 21 encounter.  Eddie & Rey compete at a slower pace, and try to keep their high-risk offense beliveable.  I like to think of this as the ""offical beginning"" of when Mysterio toned down his high-risk style.  If you're a hardcore pro wrestling fan, then you already know this will be worth your time.  But if you haven't seen this match, then let me assure that I'm not going easy on Eddie Guerrero just because he died.  This showdown is the real deal.
""7.5 / 10""

-----------------------------------------------

7) ""I Quit"" Match - WWE Championship
JBL v. John Cena (champion)
---Yes, I was shockingly disappointed with their WRESTLEMANIA match.  Yes, their 2008 rivalry was average at best.  Yes, JBL is out shape, and needs to go back to commentary.  Yes, Cena is an acquired taste.  But I am begging you on my knees...DO NOT PASS THIS UP!  JBL & Cena delivered one of the best matches of both of their careers.  From Cena's neat entrance to the trash-talking on the microphone, even skeptical fans are going to be caught up in the atmosphere.  And the action is sharp and tough to watch in some spots.  In what seems to be a tradition for JBL and JUDGMENT DAY PPVs, buckets of blood are spilled in his contest.  The final minutes are a tad sloppy, probably because the two men exhausted themselves before getting up the aisle.  But who cares?  Hardcore fans held a strong grudge for the WRESTLEMANIA letdown.  Gentlemen, consider yourselves off the hook.
""8.0 / 10""

---JUDGMENT DAY 2005 is a pretty good PPV that is well worth your time and money.  Even though a couple of its high-profile matches on other WWE DVDs, I'd still buy this individual DVD.",1225929600,,6709,5.03
