5054974,5,B0074JOVGY,"First, the actors are perfectly cast:  the late Oskar Werner as Stefan Zelter who remains vulnerable to love despite fame, fortune, and vanity, is in fine form,  Barbara Ferris is the young ""player"" who realizes that Stefan is not just the finest trophy on her shelf, but the love of her life.  Orbiting around this dazzling couple are the rueful characters who occupied the same space as Sally and Stefan, but are now outsiders, not understanding nor feeling the warmth that exudes from these fated lovers.  'Interlude' is a classic romantic tale, yet it feels personal and timeless.",1355097600,2,584,4.928571428571429
5054975,5,B0074JOVGY,"I saw this movie 30 years ago as a very young girl and never forgot it, may be it's the sound track. Been waiting for it to come out in DVD and finally got it. Still a beautiful love story.",1353542400,2,189,3.75
5054976,5,B0074JOVGY,"""Interlude"" is very popular with people who appreciate Oskar Werner's  work.  It could not be found anywhere until now, that Austria has intervened with Columbia/Sony and they have agreed to re-issue this film.
The DVD is of excellent quality, much better than the earlier ""rental"" I had received previously in VHS form and had been converted to US tape.
Anyone who is appreciative of Werner's acting genius (and genius he was!!) and enjoy good music should purchase this disc.",1350259200,4,477,5.025316455696203
5054977,4,B0074JOVGY,"Was very happy when it was finally released on DVD by Amazon.  Have watched it many times and have become an admirer of Oskar Werner's work.  The film does have some flaws in the script and Barbara Ferris is not always emotionally believable and I put that down to direction of a scene not necessarily her acting, but I am a sucker for a good love story.  The music especially in the opening credits is hauntingly beautiful and I have also purchased from Amazon, the Timi Yuro CD with that particular track on it.  The main theme is also beautiful.",1348704000,2,548,4.45
5054978,5,B0074JOVGY,"On June 22, 2006 as ""artfulwords@yahoo,"" I posted an IMDb ""user review"" entitled ""Timeless Interlude"" and then enthusiastically expanded my thoughts in May, 2009.  See p. 3 on the site in detail and caution, there are ""spoilers"".

In reading the many opinions posted there, I realized that a ""cult"" of us existed who have followed INTERLUDE for ages and longed for a decent copy.  I waited at least a decade for a fine DVD version, having watched the film too many times to count (and still watching!), first on television after seeing it in the theatre, and later via second-generation videos and/or DVDs purchased on EBay.  More recently, Timi Yuro Friends posted it on YouTube mercifully in full length, but postage stamp-size!  Like other followers, I was grateful to have access to any copy.  Some had not seen the film for years, had never seen it, or had only heard of its story through reviews and the original soundtrack.  I even notice the ""cult"" emerging thus far in our Amazon reviews: we are unanimously thrilled to have the new version and its accessibility here and have given INTERLUDE five-stars!  ""Marvelous, marvelous!""

Last month I was overjoyed to discover the remastered DVD on Amazon!  It had become a small ""obsession"" to periodically seek it especially since 2008, when I sent the late Oskar Werner's son, Felix Florian Werner, an email inquiring about INTERLUDE's being remastered.  Incredibly my letter reached him in Germany after seeking him through several sources.  For the last four years, I hoped against hope that he had indeed found a way to re-release his father's film, as he had most cordially indicated he was in process.

When the new Amazon DVD of INTERLUDE arrived at my door in July, almost to the day of its initial review in the ""New York Times"" July 3, 1968 by Renata Adler (see below), I immediately viewed it as I first saw it 44 years ago: in utterly satisfying bright and clean condition, on a large, flat-screen television in surround sound with crisp dialogue, clarity of expression and nuance - all of which were absent from the pirated, second-generation copies.  (Amazing Amazon for having almost anything anyone can wish, and now this long-awaited film!)  Since the advent of DVDs, I always wanted INTERLUDE, my favorite film of all, to find its place among forgotten cinematic jewels.  In the remastering, only the sound of the clapping audience is somewhat muffled and flat; otherwise it is beyond description to see the absolute light in the eyes of each actor who give, and share, incredibly perceptive and tender performances.  On a different note, I have long forgiven some of the quirky director cuts; if anything, I wished instead, that the remastered film contain some of the lost scenes (but alas, not to be!).  The restored color is gorgeous - and with respect to color, and as noted above, Renata Adler's ""NYT"" review popped up this evening online when I cross-researched aspects of the film and its new DVD.  I am in total disagreement with her critique which appeared over four decades ago (and a couple of months before I saw INTERLUDE at 16 and began my love affair with the film).  Adler's many snide observations remain disgusting to this day.  In one she comments on the green, sickly color permeating the scenes.  Not true.  Her further remarks about story, writing and acting are as outrageous and insensitive as the day she first hacked the film to pieces.  DO NOT ALLOW HER NASTY REVIEW TO INFLUENCE YOUR VIEWING OF INTERLUDE!

To paraphrase what I previously wrote on IMDb: ""I very much miss Oskar Werner's presence on screen and there has never been another actor quite like him.  A decade after the film came out, I had the brief and unexpected pleasure of meeting Barbara Ferris in NYC and was able to tell her how the film's sweetness had stayed with me since I was 16.

Though timeless in theme, innocent, yet not, it reflects the aura of the 1960s and becomes more bittersweet with age.  When one grows up with such a film, it takes on each decade that passes and always retains in concept that crystal sensation of the first viewing.  The soundtrack is as beautiful as it was in 1968, ever filled with memory, fresh and fleeting.  I always find that regardless of age, or where we are from, we are all bound by the magic and longing of (and for) this film.  I truly care about each of the three involved; a true test of the movie's enduring quality.  INTERLUDE is an old friend and over the years, its conversations pop up in my head as direct, loving, rich, tender, humorous and poignant streams of thought.  And then, of course, I am compelled to see it again ...

I keep INTERLUDE with me often, reread Donne's XVII Elegy 'On His Mistress,' listen to Robert Lafond's 2005 CD of the reworking of INTERLUDE's soundtrack and marvelous title song. (The CD includes Delerue's RAPTURE; both scores soar with yearning and it is a glorious CD I obtained thanks to Amazon.)  Tchaikovsky's First Symphony, 'Winter Daydreams,' Rachmaninoff's 'Second Symphony,' Albioni's 'Adagio;' the Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms and Dvorak pieces from the film allow me to immerse, to feel the musical world of conductor Stefan Zelter; and perhaps of Oskar Werner himself, who loved music and also portrayed Mozart with such devotion in the 1955 Austrian film, THE LIFE AND LOVES OF MOZART.

INTERLUDE is a film flowing with adult, relevant moments about marriage, career and affairs and represents a triangle of love, sorrow and longing; each character onto the other.  The movie remains blessedly timeless.""

Thank you, Amazon, and Felix Florian Werner who so honors his father's legacy.",1345161600,5,5651,4.841831425598335
5054979,5,B0074JOVGY,"''I have been waiting for this DVD for years. I can't believe my eyes! It's in widescreen and the aspect ratio is 2.35:1. 3.87GB DVD5 size but actually DVD9 quality. Dolby Digital 2.0. No subtitles. And the color is so fresh and perfect! You can see my snapshot pictures at the following sites:[...]
''When the film begins, with the beautiful song Interlude by Timi Yuro, my eyes flood in. I fell in love with Oskar Werner when I first saw Decision before Dawn in 1951. He had an adorable innocent boyish look that made girls melt in his gaze. It was in Summer, 1989. There's a girl who had so happy time with a man's movie.  Werner had a very smart voice. ""What seems like an interlude now could be the beginning of love."" Though they were in the same city, they would never had a chance even to say hello to each other...... And, and then what happened? When did it all seem to the end? Where had it gone just like my long lost love? Time passes so quickly, and so much has changed. But life always goes on. Are you still there? Now 23 years have passed, I'm here to say I'm still happy with you, like many years ago. Loving you all my rest of life.",1338422400,9,1151,4.2318181818181815
5054980,5,B0074JOVGY,"I first fell in love with Oskar Werner when I saw Ship of Fools in 1965. He was my mom's favorite actor. We rushed to the theater to see Interlude (Oskar in a love triangle!!) when it was released in 1968 and loved the movie and the amazing music by Georges Delerue and some of the greatest composers ever to live. Werner did a fabulous job playing Stefan Zelter, an orchestra conductor/married man having an affair with a younger woman. The late Virginia Maskell was wonderful as his gracious wife, Antonia. Barbara Ferris as Sally, a young reporter and Werner's love interest, was OK but I do believe they needed someone more dynamic in that role. Also, watch out for young actors Sir Derek Jacobi, John Cleese and Donald Sutherland. Through the years, I would always scan tv schedules, hoping to see this movie listed but it rarely was. I finally found a copy someone had videotaped from tv and bought that. I am so thrilled to find this version, after so many years. The late Timi Yuro's versions of Interlude (Time) are here on amazon on her cd called The Voice That Got Away. Like Timi, I prefer the other version, not the one used in the movie. Both the song and the movie remain favorites to this day.",1334102400,14,1209,4.5
5054981,5,B0074JOVGY,"This is indeed a first rate love story. One of the best ever. It has beautiful photography, some of the world's most beautiful music, played by the London Philharmonic, [or is it Symphony?], excellent acting [you might even call it non-acting, it seems so natural] and ------ are you ready for this?----- it is in WIDESCREEN! The aspect ratio of this DVD is 2.35.1 and NOT 1.33.1, as advertised on amazon. I nearly jumped for joy when the Columbia Lady with the torch come on and covered my whole screen! The print is clear and clean. Nothing like the murky copies [of copies, of copies] that have been floating about for years and of which I have two, just like the previous reviewer. No comparison. This is THE REAL THING! Thank you Sony Entertainment. It is much appreciated.
The only weak link in the film is Barbara Ferris. Her voice is terrible and her nose likewise. I would have much preferred to see someone like Julie Christie in the role. Still, one gets used to Ferris and she is even quite touching in some scenes. Oskar Werner more than makes up for her inadequacies. Incidentally, he said in an interview that he studied ""being a conductor"" by watching videos of Herbert von Karajan and took it from there. If you are familiar with Karajan you will see the resemblance.
So, go ahead all you movie lovers who have been clamouring for a DVD release of this film on Imdb, here it is. Go ahead, buy it. It is well worth it. [And THEN some].",1332201600,16,1451,4.5
5054982,5,B0074JOVGY,"When this film came out, romance classics were still being made.  This film was a remake of the original movie, ""Interlude"" which starred Rossano Brazzi and June Allyson.  That film was a remake of ""Intermezzo"" which starred Leslie Howard and Ingrid Bergman.

The story line centers around a domestic love triangle which includes a self-absorbed, yet loving, symphony conductor (Oskar Werner), a proper lady, well schooled and self-sacrificing wife (Virginia Haskell) and a free-spirited journalist who represents the Swinging London of the 1960s (Barbara Ferris).

I won't go too much into plot, because it is all pretty basic.  But this film is also worth getting because of the notable early performances of a very funny (mid Python days) John Cleese and a slightly-smarmy, but effective friend of the conductor, Donald Sutherland.

Also, the soundtrack by the late, great George Delereau (who did the scores for Jules and Jim and so many other fine films) weaves through the movie beautifully along with the real classical scores by Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Mozart and others.

In fact, the scenes where Oskar Werner conducts the London Symphony in the Royal Albert Hall is some of the best ever done.  Werner clearly knew his way around a baton, and embodied all the mannerisms and traits we expect from dynamic symphony conductors.

Werner and Haskell are both amazing in their respective roles.  Ferris is not a strong enough actress here to be able to hold her own with the rest of the cast.  As a result, one leaves the film wondering what it was exactly that made this woman so compelling that a relatively happily married man was willing to leave his wife for her.  But, since this is not meant to be a serious drama, only a romantic romp with beautiful scenery, music and acting, the viewer can suspend their belief for a while and simply enjoy.

This film falls into the category of an ""Affair to Remember"" or ""Casablance"" where everyone involved is sympathetically drawn and no one character is all good or all bad.  It is just life and love and all the failings and foibles that come with it.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Interlude-1965/dp/B0074JOVGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Interlude (1965)</a>

BTW.  I have watched this specific DVD and compared the film quality to two different bootlegged versions I owned.  In this re-issued DVD,  the quality of the picture and sound are wonderful.  The color is crisp and you can see the actors' nuanced performance so much better.

5054985,4,B0074JOVGY,"I saw this movie when in college in 1968, Oskar Werner reminded me of someone I met on vacation and fell in love with but living so far apart it had to end.  I recently purchased the movie, and it still remains a realistic love story for the most part.  Oscar Werner was a terrific actor, and played the role well, throughout the movie his music always came first. Unfortunately, I had not remembered from 48 yrs ago but watching it again  found Barbara Ferris miscast,  she was whiny, hurtful and overall disappointing, I had to wonder what he ever saw in her, and why he kept returning to her, as she did not convince me she truly loved him, and seemed to even lose interest in him when he was willing to give up everything for her.

5054999,5,B0074JOVGY,"The movie was found because of Gerorge Deleure's (a French) alluring soundtrack composition and Yuri Tomo's (an Italian) magical voice in the main theme ""Time is like a Dream"".  A classic movie from the 60's, a time full of love, passion and purity.  Perhaps the movie was underrated deeply in a conservative society like England (the story happened in London) as it was talking about a love affair between a married, wealthy conductor Stefan Zelter (Oskar Werner) and a young, well-mannered reporter Sally (Barbara Ferris).  It was featured, I believe, too soon at a time not yet as open and non-dogmatic as today.

The story is told in a step-by-step, simple manner, very British-style - calm, peaceful, subtle but hot-passion inside every man and woman.  Director Kevin Billington just brought us to a journey, an interlude between two people.  The movie is richly illustrated with harmonious colors, while contrasting the subversive affections.  The crisscross of feelings, colliding and underpinning, seems to be under control at times.  Yet, in the end, it is grudgingly silent after an outcry for the suppression of feelings.

It is definitely a movie made with all the essential elements.  Highly technical and detailed, the Director hides himself behind everything and let them perform.  It's very much in good contrast with that of French's acute feeling towards love.  An immersive, engrossing, enthralling movie experience.  I was totally absorbed into it.",1405814400,,1468,5.24892703862661

Werner was considered one of the finest actors in the world when this film was made. I will be sending DVD's to all my friends and relatives. I acquired an original poster, lobby cards, and b/w stills of the film, and also an original French movie poster of this film which is far superior to the American poster. As for the film, there are so many favorite and memorable lines, e.g., when Oskar first calls the reporter to set up a meeting with her, his manager asks ""Is she pretty?"" and Oskar responds: ""She is young."" The dinner scene with the wife and girl friend is tense and so revealing, as many others have written, when Virginia asks Barbara if she loves music..... And the final scene soon after the dinner in which Barbara breaks up with Oskar is devastating, especially if you have ever experienced a breakup with someone you still love and who loves you. And finally, the mystery ending that leaves the viewer with an unanswered question--did Oskar reconcile with his wife or was he divorced? The only clue might be that he says music is his life. A great film, too long overlooked. This is a film I wholeheartedly recommend.",1358985600,4,1515,4.532846715328467
5055016,5,B0074JOVGY,"Thank-you, thank-you, thank-you for releasing this on DVD!!! My sister and I have been waiting years to get a copy of ""Interlude!"" We got hold of a bootleg VHS that wasn't very good but we were so desperate to get ""Interlude"" we put up with the poor quality of the tape. But now we have the DVD and we are thrilled (we may have to order more copies and I believe we will wear out the DVD)! The story is bittersweet but so enchanting. It is well acted with Oskar Werner and Barbara Ferris in the lead roles. The supporting cast is incredible! The film takes you in and holds you so that you become part of Sally and Stefan's world. The original music is wonderful and, of course, the classical compositions are woven into the fabric of the film which enhances the drama.

Once again, thank-you for the release!! You have made 2 women very, very happy!!!!",1358208000,4,853,4.39873417721519
5055017,4,B0074JOVGY,"I first saw this movie when I was in college in the 60's; Oskar Werner was a heart throb then and still is!  His portrayal of the over-indulged conductor was spot-on!  The female lead, however, was not even close (even for a chick flick!).  I have waited patiently over the years to obtain this movie.  I am very glad it has been made available to the ""baby boomers"" to enjoy again!",1357516800,2,382,4.338028169014085
5055018,5,B0074JOVGY,"This movie was probably unnoticed when it was first released. But it is really a wonderful film... low key and unassuming, and not nearly as dated as you would think. It's a MUST for anyone who admires the acting of Oskar Werner or '60s films in general. Check it out!",1356134400,2,268,4.38
5055019,5,B0074JOVGY,"Time does indeed fly! This obscured timeless classic is finally available through DVD which is truly deserved for Blu-ray and soundtrack CD as well.

At the age of 10, I was curiously captured by the unique voice of title song via pop songs chart in my homeland. When I looked back after all these years, it's very strange and funny why such classic theme song with score was not even nominated in both Oscars and BAFTA in 1968/69? Who's mistake?

I saw the film with teenage classmates in 70's and of course, I didn't have much resonance about triangle love except the impressive background music. Somehow my good friend sent me a VHS tape in 80's as birthday gift. Like wine, I started to enjoy the movie more and more every time I played. The very positive and fine reviews are posted here in Amazon. All the castings are terrific and no doubt to the brilliant Austrian actor Oskar Werner who's the personal favorite of new wave director Francois Truffaut. Coincidentally Werner passed away on October 23, 1984 two days later than his mentor Truffaut!

Honestly speaking, I bought this new SONY copy because of the original score (not the classical music) by the unsung hero Mozart of Cinema Georges Delerue (1925-1992). Smart director Billington should be also credit for hiring such gifted composer in refining his tender work. It's quite rare to see the full music version accompany in the movie and Delerue demonstrates his heartbreaking music throughout the film: ""Opening & ending; plus 1) Interlude Triangle (4:15) - Ferris invites Werner go into her apartment and then they have intimate touch; 2) Must It Happen Once To Everyone?(3:17) - During one of their dating, Ferris asked Werner: you must be in love with her, otherwise why married? 3) Bittersweet Interlude (2:51) - Ferris explains to her husband on the phone about goodbye to Werner in the lease expired apartment - I obtained someone I used to know.""

The title song vocal by Timi Yuro and lyrics by Hal Shaper are very stunning! Sadly they both passed away in the year of 2004!

The original liner notes by Hans Fantel in the LP tell the rest - ""But the real star of this show is the sound track. Mr. Delerue has penned a wistfully romantic score. At times his plaintive melodies and gossamer scoring suggest a mood of imminent heartbreak. In his original ""Interlude"" music Georges Delerue Has Blended the Poignancy of the Story Into the Delicate Texture of His Score. He has created a sound image as beguiling as the visual image unfolding on the screen"". Wow!!

I always remember one of the conversations between Ferris & Werner when re-phrasing Maskell's question - ""do you LIKE music, No, do you LOVE music""

The picture quality of this DVD5 (capacity 4.7GB) is excellent except the illustration of the art work is below my expectation. I would prefer the original red with white color base instead of dark blue. It's really unfair not even mention or credit to the composer at all. Could you imagine such bittersweet love story showing without the original music of French master Georges Delerue??

Both film & music of ""Interlude"" remains unique place to everyone who cherishes LOVE including the composer, one of his finest works he admitted to me during our meeting at his house in Los Angeles December 1990! Hopefully Mrs. Delerue could bring us the original soundtrack of this timeless classic in the near future - it's utterly worth of long wait!!
