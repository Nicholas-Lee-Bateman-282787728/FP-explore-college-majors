8064209,2,B0009OL966,"I wish Amazon would adopt a rating system similar to Home Theater magazine or Sound & Vision. This light comedy starring Harry Langdon would be enjoyable if the source material was good. But, as usual Steve Kaplan, owner of Alpha Video has released something that looks like it was transferred from a used VHS videocassette.

So, I give this two star rating although I would give the film a 2.5 rating if it was a decent copy of the original film. This is only worth watching if you are a Harry Langdon fan or you can purchase for a dollar or two.

I don't see much point in reviewing the movie when the Alpha version is so atrocious.",1233878400,2,634,4.364406779661017
8064210,3,B0009OL966,"Actually this is a decent little movie quite funny and sweet.  The presence of Harry is an extra bonus and what a bonus.  I have to agree with the other viewer Harry makes this movie, but it's not his Little Elf character, it's Harry Langdon acting the role of a loyal loving husband whose wives friends suspect is having an affair. Harry's great talent shines through and you watch it just because he is in it.",1228435200,2,411,4.394736842105263
8064211,2,B0009OL966,"The only real appeal here is to watch the great Harry Langdon take a pile of straw and spin it into something kind of amber and shiney, even if it isn't gold. His performance is remarkable given the lack of anything substantial for him to do or react to. That he gets any laughs from viewers at all is a real testament to his talent.

As with other DVDs released by this company (Alpha), the print is poor on all levels. I got this since it was cheap and I was working on a research project involving Langdon and figured it was the easiest way to see the film. Unless you have a similar reason (films with mannequins?) there's not much here for you.

Langdon's funny, but the film does all it can to hide that.",1159142400,8,710,4.213235294117647
