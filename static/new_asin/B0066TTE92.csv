4962626,5,B0066TTE92,"Swing 101 with Shawn Trautman is one of several dance instruction videos that I own and is the only video series that I can recommend. The production value is higher than most and the instructors are easy to understand. This DVD gives enough instruction to get even beginners swing dancing since it starts with very basic rhythm and footsteps as well as several useful tips on technique. While this DVD is a great introduction to swing dancing, if you have any experience with dancing give the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Swing-Dancing-Starter-Pack-3-DVD-Set-Beginner-1-Beginner-2-and-Intermediate-1-Shawn-Trautman-s-Dance-Collection/dp/B000L2BTTI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Swing Dancing Starter Pack (3-DVD Set - Beginner 1, Beginner 2, and Intermediate 1) (Shawn Trautman's Dance Collection)</a>&nbsp;series a try instead. I believe the dance instruction videos produced by the Trautman's are the best available.",1355097600,4,962,6.829268292682927
4962627,5,B0066TTE92,Wanted to learn a dance with my ten footed girlfriend. We put it in and instantly felt the ice melt away as we where following Shawn through the video. He explains everything very well and gives a lot of useful tips throughout. Im glad i picked this up. Would highly recommend to anyone wanting to start swing dancing.,1354579200,,318,4.5
4962628,5,B0066TTE92,I am a beginner. I ordered this Swing DVD recently after checking the reviews of many dance instruction DVDs. I found it to be very thorough and well structured so that I could learn at my own pace without rushing. Very well made.,1341187200,7,230,4.372093023255814
4962629,5,B0066TTE92,We have had the Swing Dancing 101 for three weeks and find it extremely helpful and easy to follow.  We used it to practice at home and it is a perfect fit to our group dance lessons.,1328054400,3,183,3.945945945945946
4962630,5,B0066TTE92,"This is the 4th Trautman Dvd we've purchased.  All of them in the 101 series have proven to be extremely helpful and successful in getting us started with dancing, but this one seems to be especially fun.  I'm not sure if it's Shawn and Joanna's enthusiastic enjoyment of Swing that's infectious, or just the upbeat tempo for the dance, but you will definitely find yourselves having a good time learning with this one.  Like all the other 101 dvd's their organization builds from the very basics and ends with some things to challenge you for repeated study.

The claim in the editorial review that it will have you dancing the swing in minutes proved true.  We were anxious to try the Swing at a local dance just this past weekend, and we only had an hour available on the afternoon before the dance for our first look together at the dvd.  In just a few minutes of Shawn and Joanna's combined instruction we had the basic step (both single and triple time), rotating the basic, and the ladies underarm turn mastered.  Just that simple beginning was enough for us to jump in and enjoy the swing at the dance, and what fun it added!  There is still a lot more for us to learn from the dvd so we will be watching it again as soon as we can.

The Trautman 101 dvd's have had us dancing to the Night Club 2 Step, Cha Cha, and the Waltz.  Now we can add the Swing to the list.  Our thanks go out once again to Shawn and Joanna.",1327881600,2,1424,4.295880149812734
8494233,5,B0066TTE92,Found this DVD and was happy to receive it in perfect condition as promised.,1472428800,,76,4.5
8494234,4,B0066TTE92,"I didn't know that 101 was an overview.  I could have started with Volume 1 of Shawn's video.  I play the Vol 1 over and  over, play parts like the turns only. It really made the difference.  I hardly ever use the 101 version.  I give it 4 stars out of 5 because my husband and I out grew it pretty fast.",1468972800,,304,3.838709677419355
8494235,1,B0066TTE92,"Incredibly frustrating. They say this is good for absolute beginners, but as a complete newbie myself I can tell you that that's false. When he goes to demonstrate the fundamental triple-step he starts shuffling his feet around and then says ""I hope you're following along."" Well, no I'm not because I can't see what your feet are doing and you won't tell me what your feet are doing. It's shot from his side so that one foot is in the way of seeing the other foot. If it was shot from the back, we'd be able to see what each foot is doing. He does that later for the rock step but not for the essential triple-step. In as far as I've watched in the video he never, ever says ""this foot goes here and that foot goes there"".

I had to go find videos on YouTube to help me get the triple-step. What's the point of the DVD if I have to go watch other videos to understand it?

He talks about 120 beats a minute and 200 beats a minute as if I'm going to be familiar with those. He says ""If you are new to this the triple-step is like the polka or a shuffle step."" Of course I don't know what those are - I'm a beginner. He doesn't seem to understand what ""beginner"" means.

He's also confusing about the beats. He talks about 3 steps in 2 beats. Sounds like triple time, 3 against 2. But I eventually realized that it's not. There may be 3 steps but there are 4 divisions. It's not ""tri-ple-step, tri-ple-step, rock-step"", it's ""tri-ple-step-wait, tri-ple-step-wait, rock-wait-step-wait"". I was really confused until I figured that out.",1447632000,4,1532,4.368421052631579
8494236,4,B0066TTE92,"Generally good instruction, easy to follow. Too much intro. Seemed like they were trying to kill some time.",1407888000,,107,5.0
8494237,5,B0066TTE92,"Wow.. we had a blast with this video.  We have a few other videos from the same instructors and this may be our favorite.  They really turn on up the pace on this DVD and keep you moving the whole time.  Its not so fast you cant keep up, but you better be ready for a workout because these people do not slow down to smell the roses.  They have a really cool approach with these 101 videos where they teach you the beat and rhythm stuff and then follow up with how to do the actual dance.  Another great video from our favorite instructors, thanks guys!",1398816000,,553,4.130841121495327
8494238,1,B0066TTE92,We bought this DVD wanting to learn how to swing dance.  But a lot of the DVD does not even show the feet so how can we learn ?,1375574400,3,127,3.3793103448275863
8494239,5,B0066TTE92,Shawn Trautman has been making various dance videos for years.  His easy to understand moves will have you starting to dance with confidence.,1364169600,,141,5.130434782608695
8494240,5,B0066TTE92,"I highly recommend this DVD for beginners. I've tried a variety of other approaches, including lessons and Youtube, to learning different dances and highly recommend this. Video is easy to follow. Good production quality. And makes it fun to learn. Am ordering a bunch of additional DVDs on Swing and other dances.

Shawn and his wife do a great job with clear instruction. They show 1 step and 3 step options to make it easy for you to dance to any pace. This is way cheaper than lessons. It is also great documentation - if you are like me and may need a quick refresher down the road.",1357516800,6,587,4.435185185185185
8494241,5,B0066TTE92,"for people with little dance experince i found this video (along with other shawn trautman videos)to be easy to follow and understand. instruction was slow enough to not be confused yet not to the point of boredom. i think if anyone tries just one instructional video, they would agree and be hooked on learning multiple dances.",1356566400,2,328,4.875
