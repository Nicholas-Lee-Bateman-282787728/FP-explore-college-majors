However I was disappointed that, for me anyways, most of the film was about the people and the equipment used in the making of this film. I would have enjoyed it more if it was were more about the animals that live in the Deep. Nevertheless the footage of the animals were fantastic.",1132876800,2,341,4.428571428571429
1568761,1,B00005JNPN,"Like many others, I expected to have a front-row seat for a 90 minute tour of the deep. Instead, I got a patronizing, self-centered tour of the team who did the dive, with maybe 10 to 15 minutes of actual deepsea life forms added just to keep us hoping for more. Add to that the assumptions about life on other planets, and the science-fiction bit at the end, I have to say that this was a waste of time and money. Better get the Blue Planet series, much much more scientific. The one star is for the few moments where there was interesting deep-sea life forms.",1132704000,2,561,4.30188679245283
1568762,2,B00005JNPN,"I have been expecting with great impatience for this documentary to be released. Finally, Amazon shipped it to me and I sat with a friend to watch it. I WAS GREATLY DISAPPOINTED. The title is Aliens of the Deep. We saw just a fraction of these ...aliens. Where are the rest of the Aliens, given that the scientific team had all the gear to discover them?. The title is misleading. Instead of focusing at the creatures leaving in places where human has never been before, we had this analogy with life in Mars, in Mars, why should I care about Mars at present stage, given that the title is NOT ET Aliens, but Aliens of the Deep? I strongly believe that James Cameron had some spare time and money (if he had paid any, since NASA is greatly involved) and produced this...which I find very, very disappointing. It is a pity, since Cameron is a man who seemed to know his job. Why this end result, I do not Know, and I would like to find out.

If you can watch it without paying a single dollar, do it. If not, avoid...",1132704000,3,1016,4.291666666666667
1568763,2,B00005JNPN,"Director James Cameron originally made this film for 3D theaters and a lot is lost in the translation to television.  ""Ghosts Of The Abyss"" served well in a smaller format, but ""Aliens Of The Deep"" just sinks and sinks.  There is more emphasis on special effects and hypothesis of life on other planets than seeing the real ""Aliens"".  Sure, thousands of shrimp piled around a volcanic vent is kind of cool, and that fish with two feet-like appendages is unusual, but other than a large translucent jellyfish, there's not much here.  All the younger scientists look and talk like actors and the technology of going deep in clear bubble-like compartments is amazing, but it all seems too staged.  The extras are interesting only in that they go into more depth about the crew and the machinery.  I would recommend this perhaps, on a large 3D screen, but don't bother for the home theater.",1132099200,6,886,4.758169934640523
1568764,3,B00005JNPN,"Director James Cameron is best known for his science fiction achievements in cinema with blockbuster titles such as Terminator, Aliens, and the disaster drama Titanic.  However, a real life adventure excites him far more than the fictional creations that he can experience in a safe distance in the theater darkness.  Thus, after having made the documentaries Expedition: Bismarck (2002) and Ghosts of the Abyss (2003) Cameron embarks on his third underwater voyage in Aliens of the Deep where he assembles a joint adventure by American and Russian scientists who begin to explore the unknown depths of the Earth.

The anticipation is overwhelming after having seen the two previous documentaries and all of Cameron's fictional creations, as this must undoubtedly be as captivating.  A brief introduction informs about the importance of sunlight and the photosynthesis, as the depth of where Cameron and his crew are entering will not have any sunlight whatsoever.  It is a scientific approach to the story that Cameron tries to document, however, they are about to enter an unknown area of the world unlike his two previous underwater adventures where the history of the ships were fairly well recorded.  This sets up some obstacles in the storytelling technique, as it leaves the audience in the dark as well.

The storytelling is not the only thing that seems to cause trouble, as do the laws of physics on the ship when they are in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.  The crew together with Cameron show how they must solve the problem in order to find an alternate solution to their problems.  Eventually, they can set off for the bottom of the ocean, which brings the audience on an expedition to the most remote locations in the world where very few humans have ever entered.  Jointly, NASA scientists, marine biologists, and many other scientists work to find the use of the knowledge in the ocean's depth, as it can be applied to space exploration and an understanding of how planets are created.

There are intriguing moments where strange creatures of the sea drift effortlessly by the small deep-sea submarines.  However, it is not as often as the title Aliens of the Deep suggests, which might have many viewers loose their attention.  Instead, there are intriguing facts of how life could live without sunlight from the heat and how chemicals on the ocean floor are generated by the Earth's magma center.  Thus, after having lost the audience's initial interest it might be hard to keep their attention through the rest of the fascinating biology lesson that this cinematic experience offers.",1131753600,,2605,5.013921113689095
1568765,3,B00005JNPN,"""Aliens of the Deep"" is the first commercial film to document the mysterious creatures that live at the bottom of Earth's oceans, where no sunlight ever reaches. It was filmed in 2003, as 4 manned deep submersibles made 40 dives in 10 sites in both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans to get a firsthand look at these sun-less ecosystems thousands of meters below the oceans' surface. ""Aliens of the Deep"" was released theatrically in 3-D IMAX, which was probably more impressive than the smallish 2-D picture on a DVD. Director James Cameron, exploration enthusiast and a great student of deep sea life, was on one of the submersibles and does some narration, but most of the narration is by other members of the team: astrobiologists, marine biologists, and a marine seismologist. Both the 47-minute theatrical version and an extended 95-minute version of the film are included on the DVD.

The pictures of the ocean floor are great. There are plants, fish, microbes, giant squid, giant tubeworms, and a lot of unidentifiable stuff down there. I was pleased to see the tubeworms, as I have always had trouble envisioning them from descriptions. An entire sun-less ecosystem powered by superheated, toxic fluid emitted from hydrothermal vents is intriguing stuff. But the narration is bad. The enthusiasm of the explorers comes across, but very little else does. They're excited. Very excited. They proclaim everything to be ""incredible"" with no explanation of why. But they aren't informative. The narrators are scientists of various descriptions, but not experienced deep sea explorers. They seem to just be along for the ride. They're not authorities on the subject by any means. So their narration is ebullient but superficial. Ironically, a sequence that speculates on how we might discover undersea life on Jupiter's moon Europa is more entrancing than the deep sea footage, even though it's not real, because it's something the narrator knows well.

The technology of the submersibles and the conditions inside of them make a great story in themselves. But instead of taking the opportunity to impress us with the realities of exploration, ""Aliens of the Deep"" says nothing, leaving the audience with the impression that it's easy to putter around on the ocean floor. The description of the deep sea environment is barely even cursory. The narration mentions the heat, but not the pressure against which plumes of smoke blast upwards. The fish have eyes, but do they see? Does infrared light reach that far? Granted, there is limited knowledge of the creatures we see in this film. But I've read accounts of earlier dives, and there is a whole lot more to say about these creatures and their environment than ""Aliens of the Deep"" would have us believe. This film talks more about the scientists than about the subject. The creatures that live around the hydrothermal vents and the efforts to study them are fascinating, but you wouldn't know it from ""Aliens of the Deep"".",1131148800,43,2975,5.044715447154472
1568766,5,B00005JNPN,"I've watched the entire ""Cosmos"" (Carl Sagan's) video series perhaps as many as 50+ times over the past 20 years, and am still not tired of it, but this... this incredible movie went so far beyond anything I could have expected that I'm going to have to return to see it, in 3D, *at* IMAX, multiple times.

The visual impact is just like ""being there"", in fact, it's no doubt very much better (because of the time factor) than even taking an actual ride in this vehicle... and, the speculations of exploring Europa's undersea area was a climax that tied the whole current project together with the most elaborate visions that NASA could have dreamed up.

This could be a much longer review, but there's no time, except to encourage those who might be in the least inclined to go see this film at IMAX in 3D without delay.  This is one that no high-definition TV can recreate for you, at least at the levels of technology we have now or can expect in the home, in the next 20 years.  And, if you feel this review is too enthusiastic, after seeing the movie, all I can say is that I'm sorry for you.

I worked at JPL for 10+ years and was personally responsible for managing the development and flight-hardware fabrication & calibration of the Voyager's wide-angle sun detectors, as well as for a number of other, lesser tasks.  Since that time I've followed the thinking about Humankind's future in space, but *this* movie, again, went beyond anything I could have even dreamed of expecting.

Once again, the visual impact, the way the 3D camera captures the people in these deep-sea vehicles themselves as well as the incredible organism near the volcanic vents 10,000 feet down in the open ocean, is fantastic.  Go See It!!!",1122163200,9,1725,4.61437908496732
1568767,3,B00005JNPN,"To me there is something completely unnatural about going the places in the ocean that this film takes us. I find it creepy down there and would never go there for real.  Of course I have a father who is a scuba diver who would never live in New York, which is where I'm now living.  It's the way the universe balances itself out. As a fan of James Cameron of course I would prefer if he went back to making regular feature films. There he achieved greatness twice with ""Titanic"" and ""Terminator 2,"" and made many other films that were very good. However, he has a right to make what he wants and I feel as though this film and ""Ghosts of the Abyss"" are both strong movie that provide some much needed variety to cinema.  In ""Aliens of the Deep"" Cameron and his crew once again travel to the depths of the ocean and take us along for the ride. It really is an ingenious use of the IMAX screen. I just don't understand why 7th grade science class couldn't have been this interesting.  The entertainment value taken out of this film is directly related to the education being dropped on you.  I would much rather learn through this method as opposed to dusty old textbooks and dusty old professors.  Cameron knows that you sometimes need a flair for the dramatics, and that the knowledge itself is not enough to lure young minds in.  I was fascinated by some of the fish I saw, and by learning that some do not even need sunlight to sustain life.  I would probably argue that by the end Cameron may have taken his flair for the dramatics a wee bit too far, but I can't fault him too much for that.  As he takes us on an imaginary journey to Jupiter's moon Europa I couldn't help but think that he had fallen back on the Hollywood special effects he had lamented earlier in this film. If their theory is that life can exist inside the oceans of Europa I can do little more than shrug my shoulders and assume they know what they're talking about.  Also, while I'm complaining, I don't understand why the movie couldn't have gone on longer. I understand it is something of a tradition now that IMAX movies run under an hour. I also know that it became that way because back in the day the IMAX machines could only sustain power for that long. But we all know that recently a flurry of feature films have ventured onto the IMAX format so that excuse no longer holds water. Despite it's short run time (and higher ticket price) I will still recommend this film because with the exception of ""Ghosts of the Abyss"" you have never seen anything like this before. ***1/2",1114905600,4,2559,4.368421052631579

I sat down and before I knew it the movie was over.  It was so captivating and well done that the time flew by.

The renditions of exploring the moons of Jupiter were the best I have seen, and if more work like this were to be released, NASA would have an easier time securing their funding.

My only wish was that there were more details provided about the fantastic (real!) creatures in this film...  it's a pure visual treat, and a fantastic glimpse at an amazing world, but perhaps a little shorter on substance that I would have wished.

1568871,3,B00005JNPN,"Patience is indeed a virtue if you are watching a film such as Aliens Of The Deep. There are plenty of narratives from scientists, researchers and selected crew before the deep sea aliens make their appearance.

If you are looking for that monstrous fish with the little light bulb dangling over its head from Finding Nemo, you'll be sorely disappointed. That said, not all hope is lost, otherwise this movie would not have made the DVD.

You do get the average feather duster worm and the deep sea anemone. Strange looking albino eels and a 'stingray' with its mouth on the upper side instead of the lower. A friendly octopus also gets up close and personal with the underwater  explorer ship, making this one of the great moments in the movie.

The real showstoppers are this creature which looks like a hybrid of the octopus and jellyfish. It moves by waving gracefully through the water. Quite surreal. You also get a cluster of red  worms in white tubes. Pretty harmless.

What took my breath away was the ocean floor spewing black lava with thousands of tiny shrimps clustered around. When disturbed, these shrimps inundate the explorer's screen like bees, which is quite scary to watch.

Overall, Aliens Of The Deep did not feature as many deep sea creatures as I would have liked. Still, it must have been quite a monumental task for the filmmakers to find these denizens and capture them on camera.",1313366400,,1407,4.741803278688525

1568873,5,B00005JNPN,"Our family loves this video!

This is one of the only movies that concentrates on the deepest portions of our oceans and trenches.  Most videos that say they're about 'deep sea fish' simply aren't.",1299024000,,197,4.764705882352941
1568874,4,B00005JNPN,"I've noticed some pretty negative reviews for this, and there are certain common threads among them.  These threads are basically ""we want to see kewl creatures, don't bore us with anything else.""

Well, if you expected this to be just some pretty pictures of funny monsters, you're watching the wrong movie.  Go rent Spongebob, instead.

I'm not a huge fan of Cameron as an individual...  he's got an ego the size of Montana, and it shows.  He's a pretty smart guy, and he really does have an interest in science and exploration, though...  so he's kind of like the typical college professor in that sense, except that he actually DOES things, rather than just sitting around in a classroom pretending to know about things other people have done.  So, while I'd like him a whole heck of a lot more if he was a bit more humble about his own personal role in all this (after all, many people would do this sort of thing if we had the money, and his money came from movies, not from science).

That said...  this movie is about real science.  REAL science.  Which means ""how do we learn things"" as well as ""why do we want to know them?""  Not just ""isn't this kewl-looking?""  Many of the more negative reviews you'll read below are complaining about those two elements.  Some complain that not enough of the movie is spent showing ""kewl"" creatures.  But real science doesn't work that way...  you have to expend a LOT of effort to make any real discoveries in real life.  Much of this movie explains ""how we learn things"" about the depths of the ocean, and it's one of the best examples of this which I've seen.

Moreover, the ""why do we want to know them?"" question is key to why we're shown the animated ""Europa"" materials later on.  We want to know these things because, even if we see no immediate practical benefit to the shrimp and bacteria colonies on these extreme-depth vents here on Earth (at least for now), it is actually more likely, from a practical basis, that life of THIS sort exists throughout the universe than that life like us does.  There are more ""cold"" planets or moons with massive tidal forces to generate internal heat, than there are planets of just the right mass, just the right distance from just the right type of sun, and so forth, to support atmospheric, life-supporting ecosystems.  So...  statistically speaking...  if we meet alien life some day, it's more likely to be like what we see at the deep vents than it is to be like what we see in Kansas.

This is a DOCUMENTARY.  It's clearly identified as such.  And as such, it's very successful and (to many of us, though obviously not for all of us) it's very entertaining and thought-provoking.

If you don't want to see the whole thing, and only want to look at ""kewl glowy goopy things"" go find another flick, though.  You won't like this.

No, I'm not a fan of Jim Cameron's ego...  but I am a big supporter of how he chooses to spend his fortune.  If the man were to just learn a bit of humility, he'd be in a position to make a real difference in the world...  to be a ""big damn hero.""

This movie shows that side of him, and shows what real science OUGHT to be.  It's about discovery...  a hard, challenging, dangerous process, fraught with danger, with failure, and with the unexpected.  Sometimes giving results that nobody expected, and never ""driven"" by what you ""expected"" to find.",1275868800,,3376,4.529801324503311

Spectacular underwater scenes of creatures almost beyond belief and geological processe that formed the planet.
I recommend this video for everyone. There are 2 versions included on the DVD, Extended and Theatrical.
As an adult, I found the technical and scientific information facinating in the Extended version.
Children ages 4 and up will like the Theatrical version since it highlights the underwater creatures and omits the more technical information contained in the Extended version. Also, I gained a greater appreciation for James Cameron as a producer and director. His ""team"" included experts from Russia and the United States. These experts were from the fields of marine biology, exo-biology and astronauts and scientists from NASA.

1568876,1,B00005JNPN,"It's been put succinctly by others who've rated this lowly.  But KC summed it up best: ""It should have been called `The People Who Search for Aliens of the Deep.'""  The launch is expected - drama built up falsely.  Will the mission succeed?  Will they have to turn back?  Equipment malfunctions just at the start, even after careful preparation, cause the focus of this drama.  Naturally, you have to go with it even knowing there would be no DVD if they had simply gotten to the middle of the ocean and then made a U-turn and headed home.  Or maybe there would be.  Because, except for a few hopeful glimmers of the `ethereal' critters thriving at the floor of the ocean, the critters are missing from the footage.  Most of the footage is obligatory repetitions from one scientist (?) to the next.  ""Ooh"", ""Wow!"", ""It's like being in space"", ""This is what it would be like to land on Mars (or Europa or your-favorite-planet-here"".  The footage is of the people sitting around and chatting about their dreams of what would be found on a planet if it could support life.  The conversations revolve around the notion that the life on the ocean's floor, especially the extremophiles they are searching for, would be the most likely examples.  There are maybe 4 or 5 promising shots of ghostly fish, swirling translucent masses, a curious and dangerous looking squid.  Mostly, its just the people, some unneeded footage of the Mars landing, and lots and lots and lots of shots of eyeballs pressed to the submersibles peephole, followed by the above-mentioned ""Ooh"", ""Wow!"", ""It's like being in space"",  etc.  The film loses its focus, it sorely needed an impartial narrator to inform and explain the animals that were seen.

1568877,2,B00005JNPN,"James Cameron is a filmmaker, not a scientist.  Despite his pretensions to the contrary, he is not ""doing science"" in this film.  I watched the extended version, and only something like a quarter of the footage consisted of the admittedly beautiful undersea photography.  Visually, this is a fine film.  The problem is the relentlessly irritating dialog.  The phoney, self-indulgent, cliche-ridden conversations that make up most of the ""human interest"" portion of the film make every minute a chore to watch.  The effect is similar to that of having to listen to a group of strangers having a deeply personal conversation amongst themselves that doesn't involve you, except more stilted and lifeless.

Also, James Cameron needs to learn that not everyone is as in love with him as he is with himself and that not everyone cares to see and hear him pat himself on the back for being such a pioneering underwater explorer.

I am not joking when I recommend watching this with your television's mute button activated.  Other than some silly bloviating by Cameron and Co. about how this is just like exploring other planets, there is no substantial science in this movie (and the science that is there is highly speculative).

The film clocks in at under 2 hours, and only about half of it focuses on deep sea life, with only about 10 different animals shown.  I can even name them; the Dumbo Squid, a bigger squid that goes unnamed, white crabs, shrimp swimming among hydrothermal vents, tube worms, a fish that looks like a grouper, a rattail fish, a crynoid, lots of bacteria, and an unnamed transparent wispy creature that resembles a jellyfish without tentacles.  In fact, the film features a larger selection of humans than oceanlife.  Too much of it focused on the work done by humans to journey into the deep; which is fine as an extra feature, but not as the main component of the film.

1568902,4,B00005JNPN,"While I was hoping for more of a nature documentary than this ended up being, what it was ended up being pretty interesting.  The DVD has the 45 minute IMAX version and a 99 minute extended version, which is the one I watched.  The movie is more about the mission to explore the deep vents and the life there than about the creatures that live there.  Although, there are some amazing photos of the some amazing life forms, we don't get a lot of scientific content.  Mostly some gee whiz photos and the reactions of the folks on the expedition.

I am not sure why these particular scientists were chosen, but they do seem to have a range of actual expertise, but some seem to be chosen more for the photogenic qualities than their ability to explain anything.  Some of the language they use and their pronunciation is quite embarrassing, let alone for a PhD.  Maybe they are the scientific equivalents of jocks.  I don't know.  However, I bet there are people out there with the same or better expertise who can actually speak properly.  Other scientists were there, shown, but never really heard from.

The movie strays from the deep into outer space.  Part of the reason, so they filmmakers say, is to study life in extreme environments so we can learn what life might be like on Europa and elsewhere in the galaxy.  While this discussion also ranges from interesting to silly, I liked the attempt to connect these environments.

One thing I didn't appreciate much was the blending of animation into the actual photography so the viewer isn't really sure that he is looking at animated lava rather than the real thing.  My son was quite upset about it when I explained that something he thought was really cool wasn't really real.

But it is still definitely worth viewing.",1188691200,,1775,4.641025641025641

With a name like ""Aliens of the Deep,"" I would have liked to see more underwater footage and strange species. Too much time was spent on footage above water and getting to know the crew, who were lucky enough to be a part of it. Unfortunately, I will never be so lucky, and so I was hoping Aliens of the Deep would share much more than it did.

The film explores the correlation between the exploration of our oceans and that of planets within our solar system--which is thought provoking--and is reason enough to watch this film.  All in all however, it just didn't satisfy my own appetite for exploration. I wanted to see more",1184803200,,702,4.4765625

1568905,3,B00005JNPN,"Aliens of the Deep (James Cameron, 2005)

James Cameron does another deep-sea documentary. I was halfway hoping that after the horror that was Titanic, Cameron would retire from feature filmmaking and just do these from now on. IMDB says that's not the case, but we can always look back on what was.

The DVD release of Aliens of the Deep is about half an hour longer than the feature film release, which is quite nice. We get a lot more of what we came to see the movie to experience-- pretty pictures of areas of our world which most of us will never get to see close up. Yes, there's a lot of speculation that sets up for a big special-effects extravaganza at the end (and really, if anyone could find a way to put a big special-effects extravaganza at the end of a documentary, wouldn't it be James Cameron?), and there's a lot of ""ZOMGWTFBBQWE'REKILLINGTHEPLANET"" to put up with, but when you expand the movie to ninety-seven minutes, it's diluted by a lot more footage of scientists running around studying creatures neither they nor anyone else has ever seen before.

Yes, I would've liked more underwater footage and more information on some of the creatures and features that are encountered  - but this film certainly serves to whet your appetitie for further exploration into the mysteries of the deep sea, as well as those of other worlds.  If anything, my main complaint about 'Aliens of the Deep' is that it was over too quickly.  It was wonderful to see young scientists given such a prominent role in this film.  Here's hoping that children watching 'Aliens of the Deep' may have their curiosity piqued by the wonders of space and the deep sea - and science in general - and will point to the screen and say 'I want to do that'.",1162080000,2,702,4.496062992125984

While sitting around discussing alien life is fun, I would rather they focused on deep sea life. I would also have prefer it if they had taken a Marine Biologist, instead of an Astrobiologist (yea, that's a usefull profession). Frankly, this played like an after school special. There's very little here of interest, and one can do much better watching PBS. Watching the extended version only prolongs the pain.

1568968,2,B00005JNPN,"Good nature documentaries beat Hollywood blockbusters in excitement, alien-ness and sheer beauty of images as well as in depth and relevance. Bad ones look like a ""making of"" of an expedition on which actually not all that much happened (you know, a bunch of scientists filming themselves talking for an hour about how they don't find the platypus while showing off their equipment).

I was so excited when I found and bought this one. Acclaimed Hollywood director James Cameron embarking on a 40-dive-4-submarines-Mega-underwater expedition. At the end of the lengthy feature (because you keep waiting for them to start showing what they filmed OUTSIDE of their submarines), you've seen brief shots of five sea creatures (none of which I hadn't seen before), always the same hypothermal vent and a few crabs, and a lot of talk and boasting from the makers about how expensive this mission is. Oh yes, there's some cute (and at the same time pretentious and shallow) Hollywood-style animated interjections about the notion that life in the oceans could be linked to alien life in space, but it makes the impression only stronger that they didn't actually find all that much. What the hell did they do down there? 40 dives?

I regret buying this film. If you want real aliens of the deep, check out ""The Deep"" of the BBC series ""The Blue Planet"", which is a hundred times more amazing. National Geographic also has some good programs on the same subject. Forget this one.",1152835200,4,1470,4.899598393574297

1568972,3,B00005JNPN,"This documentary is not nearly as good as it should have been.  Before I even get to the film, I have to say I have a problem with the title.  Yes, I understand that the creatures at the bottom of the ocean (few of which we actually get to see here, incidentally) are so different that they appear ""alien,"" but the denizens of the ocean's depths are about the last creatures on planet Earth I would refer to as alien.  I think the title is actually a tip-off to what this documentary really is at its heart: James Cameron's pitch to be the first explorer of the oceans possibly existing on truly alien worlds.  This whole thing (and I should note that I'm talking about the 95-minute version) is more about speculations concerning alien worlds than it is about our own ocean's depths.  In a sense, the methods and means of studying life miles below the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans is akin to the exploration of alien oceans, but Cameron and his gang really stretch the point here.  I'm sorry, but a month aboard an ocean vessel is not quite the same as a trip to Mars or the moons of Jupiter, no matter what one young scientist says.  Every time we actually get to go back beneath our oceans, the documentary is soon hijacked by hypothetical comparisons to the exploration of alien worlds.  By the end, some of that speculation really sounds scripted.  I for one hope that bona fide scientists, rather than a rich and daring enthusiast like Cameron and a stable of giggling grad students, oversee those alien missions if and when they take place.

This film simply forgets what it is supposed to be about on several occasions.  The scientists who went along for the ride, mostly young people from astrophysical as well as geological and oceanographic disciplines, just aren't that interesting, and they often sound more like tourists than scientists when they travel down to the ocean's depths.  Certainly, anyone would be blown away by the sights down there, but statements such as awesome, what is that?, and ""Holy pancakes, Batman"" just aren't very informative in my book.  The film makes another mistake, I believe, by not better identifying the locations of each dive in any way that is meaningful to non-geologists.  Unless you are familiar with the names of undersea areas, you won't have much of an inkling where in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans these dives took place.  Give Joe Viewer a little more context, if you please.

I think it's rather obvious that most potential viewers want to see strange-looking creatures they've never seen before.  You'll see a few early on (including a fish with two front feet), and you'd better revel in it while you can because most of the footage consists of hydrothermal vents and their unique ecosystems.  It's fascinating, yes, but all we did in the second half of the film (when we actually found our way back underwater) was jump from one hydrothermal vent to another.

The main problem with this film is the limited amount of time we actually get to spend exploring the ocean's depths.  Far too much time is taken up getting to know the explorers and hearing their speculations on life on other planets.  I would have to say that less than half of this film's time is spent beneath the waves - I for one wanted much more than that, since that is what the documentary was supposed to be about.",1141344000,18,3346,4.656462585034014

1568975,2,B00005JNPN,"""Aliens of the Deep"" has a lot of scenes of James Cameron playing scientist and lots of computer-animated outer space stuff, but not much actual footage of the eponymous deep sea ""aliens"" here on Earth.

The point of ""Aliens of the Deep"" is confusing. Cameron starts out discussing how little we know about the fascinating creatures inhabiting the most extreme depths of the ocean.  However, Cameron then veers off to spend the bulk of the film speculating about life on Mars and the moons of Jupiter.  Very little of this film is dedicated to showing actual ""aliens of the deep"" here on Earth.  I counted ten or so.  The few that we do see are mind-blowing, so it's even more mind-blowing that Cameron should throw in so much gratuitous computer animation of other planets, space probes, and fake extraterrestial ocean creatures.

This could have been an excellent film.  Unfortunately, Cameron, for all his professed love of the ocean's depths, didn't seem to want to make a film about them.  He really wants to make a movie about exploring oceans on other worlds.  At least for now, that's science fiction, not documentary filmmaking.",1138233600,6,1137,4.880208333333333
1568976,3,B00005JNPN,"James Cameron is a guy with a fascination with the deep ocean (he made the THE ABYSS and TITANIC).  He is also the guy whose ego is so big (""I'm king of the world!"" at the Oscars) that even much of Hollywood finds him insufferable.

And that is the good and the bad of this movie.

The clarity and composition of the deep ocean footage are spectacular:  it's safe to say that the ocean floor has never been captured this way before.  However, Cameron is no Jacques Cousteau and this film suffers for lack of a coherent, or compelling, storyline.  It's the equivalent of making an action picture full of explosions, expecting that the spectacle will carry the picture.

One of the mistakes is that there is a lack of decent narration.  Saying ""Oh, wow, how cool"" doesn't tell us much and what narration there is mostly consists of telling us what we can already see on screen.  There is a reason for this:  with a ship full of senior scientists, Cameron has chosen himself, his brother, and the young graduate students aboard as the humans that will guide us on our journey.  The choice of the youthful students instead of their advisors may have been for photogenic reasons (same as casting a Hollywood movie!) or a chance for Cameron, as the only senior guy, to dominate the conversations.

Time and again, we are subjected to Cameron ""explaining"" things that you know he got from others.  Much as Tom Hanks fancied himself as a NASA expert after appearing in APOLLO 13, Cameron fancies himself an oceanographer, simply because he has the financial clout to get to the bottom of the ocean.  So we are treated to his challenging a young planetary scientist on theories of where oxygen can come from and to Cameron's ""version"" of the Drake equation regarding extraterrestrial life.  You know a senior researcher wouldn't put up with this and would politely remind Cameron that he is, after all, just a Hollywood director and producer.

There is also a problem with expository animation:  it's not there were we need it (explaining, for example, some of the deep sea experiments regarding the geology of the ocean floor or the experimental chamber to simulate Europa's surface) and it acts as filler when we could be seeing other things (explaining, for example, the fancy NASA missions that people can imagine like so many PowerPoint slides).  In particular, the animation of the Jupitor Icy Moon Orbitor (JIMO) has a lot of screentime - and is made even more pointless by NASA's recent cancellation of this mission.  At some point, one wishes the Cameron would lay off the heavenly choirs on the soundtrack and stick to more realistic sounds on the bottom of the ocean floor.

In short, Cameron doesn't seem to know if he wants a travelogue, an adventure story, or a scientific documentary.  This is a shame because the ocean photography is so amazing.  It's his inability to come up with a consistent compelling narrative that leaves us nothing more than a home movie of Cameron's underwater vacation.

A fair amount of this program is taken up with speculation about life on other planets. This is interesting at times but, again, is nothing spectacular. That is the problem with the entire program.
