8029167,5,B0002M6XIO,"I've always love Luc Besson's movies - and all of the Taxi serias are funny! Car racing is very cute too, even though I am not into it.

8029168,3,B0002M6XIO,"Taxi driver, Daniel (Sami Naceri) and his cop friend Emilien (Frederic Diefenthal) are back. This time, Emilien is trying to apprehend a gang of thieves who dress up as Santa Claus while pulling robberies, and as you would expect, Daniel and his super-taxi end up helping. Meanwhile, Petra (Emma Sjoberg) and Lilly (Marion Cotillard) are both pregnant with the children of Emilien and Daniel, and Emilien and Daniel must come to terms with their impending fatherhood.

In the first two ""Taxi"" films the car was the star of films, with the actors coming a distant second. In ""Taxi 3"", the car has a smaller part, and more time is given to the characters, and in particular, the sub-plots about the pregnancies, much to its detriment (pregnancy sub-plots are in every second film - it's the car that I want to see). Furthermore, when they do occur, the action sequences just aren't as exciting as those in the earlier films. Compared to the ending of ""Taxi"" (and that of ""Taxi 2""), the ending of ""Taxi 3"" is a bit of an anti-climax: the car doesn't do anything really cool and being eight months pregnant, Petra isn't given any opportunities to kick butt. As a result, ""Taxi 3"" is nowhere near as good as its two predecessors.

If considered simply as a comedy, ""Taxi 3"" also lags behind its forerunners and behind other French comedies, such as ""The Closet"" or ""The Visitors"". The captain's propensity for making racist comments at inappropriate moments has been toned down to nothing, for example. Nevertheless, it still managed to get several genuine laughs out of me, which made it worthwhile.

Overall, this film is still worth watching and will appeal to fans of the ""Taxi"" series who want to go on another outing with the characters that they have come to know and love, but if you are a newcomer to these film, start with one of the earlier instalments.",1222732800,,1859,4.731481481481482

8029170,5,B0002M6XIO,"Just amazing movie. Really great work of director and all crew. I was very much surprised when i saw this movie. It have smth that other first 2 parts don't have that kind of... charm.

I really recommend to watch this movie to everybody! Christmas mood, parents situation and still all the same - crazy and adrenaline movie.
Good end of good movie.",1169337600,,349,4.5396825396825395
8029171,1,B0002M6XIO,"In fact, were it not for Timothy Hines' despicable War of the Worls con trick, this amoeba of a movie really might be the very worst film I've ever seen or ever will see, and even that's being VERY generous. Now I enjoyed the first Taxi movie, which had a sense of speed and fun even if there weren't many stunts. I even enjoyed Taxi 2 in its no-brainer way despite the worse direction (different director, held over for this one for some inexplicable reason) because it had plenty of good stunts. But this film really is like the filmmakers knew they'd have a guaranteed audience no matter what so decided to spend 83 very long minutes throwing merde at the audience to see if they'd eat it. It's that bad. No: it's worse.

It starts off with some badly shot stunts ripped off from Jackie Chan's Operation Condor that lead into our hero giving a James Bond figure a lift he'll never forget. Now obviously Pierce Brosnan's contract wouldn't let him do it, but they could have tried for Timothy Dalton or even Roger Moore. I'm sure if Roge was busy they could have got George Lazenby, who's done that sort of thing before enough times. But no, the joke falls flat because they get that epitome of suave sophisticated British espionage himself, Slyvester Stallone (dubbed badly into French) to do the part. Worse is that not only is this almost the best part of the film but it has the only stunts in the whole picture. It does lead into a very, very funny one-minute send-up of the new Bond title sequences that is genuinely terrific, but once that's over, turn off at once - you will not get the next 70 minutes of your life back and you will resent it.

It's horribly wrong on every level. The two stars don't even meet for 45 minutes, and when they do the charm is replaced with whining, there are no chases or big stunts - this from a film who's only reason to exist is car stunts - and a boring plot about Chinese villains disguising themselves as rollerblading Santas to rob Marseilles' biggest bank. But in the end, they don't bother, they go to Switzerland instead. The taxi follows them, the robbers get very easily arrested and the cop goes to hospital where the girlfriend he didn't notice was pregnant for 8 months is having a baby. The end. Add terrible, horrible mistimed 'comic' relief from Bernard Farcy playing a pompous deluded chief inspector and Bai Ling horrendously made up as the most repugnant racist stereotype of Chinese whoredom (sorry, there's no other description) in a hideously misogynist part and you've got a film that manages to be dumb, boring, pointless and offensive without ever passing 'vaguely interesting' along the way. When the best joke is a dumb comic relief black cop being run over by a car he's trying to commandeer because he's black (""It's okay, I'm used to it""), you know you're in the *beep* Never have I seen a film so lazy and with so much contempt for its audience, and I've seen three Michael Bay movies. THAT bad and worse.",1120262400,2,2979,4.545623836126629
8029172,5,B0002M6XIO,"This is a hellova movie!!! I love it and wish they made more movies of this particular version (I mean after Taxi 3). Actors, action, sense of humor are fantastic!!!!! Car chases incredible!  (Go, Peugeot! I bet Peugeot had to pay tons of money for their car's advertisement, hehe, eh?). Anyways - I highly recommend this wonderful movie!!! Especially this, French, original movie, NOT American poorly made, pathetic copy!

GO, LUC BESSON!!!",1105660800,6,441,5.111111111111111
