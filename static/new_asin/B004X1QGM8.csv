8445894,5,B004X1QGM8,"""Nosso Lar"" has always been one of my favorite books. I enjoyed the movie so much that had my entire family watching it, so I could watch it again and again. Without question, this will be one of my favorite movies as well. Now I purchased it as gifts for friends, I hope they'll like it just as much as I did.",1324425600,5,310,4.016129032258065
8445895,5,B004X1QGM8,"NOSSO LAR(Our Home) is one of the most original stories about what possibly awaits us on the other side. The acting is phenomenal, and many of the scenes will simply take your breath away. I would've never known about this film, if it weren't for an Astral Projection course I was taking at the time; the teachers/instructors at the International Academy of Consciousness(IAC) highly recommended it, for its extreme accuracy on spiritual knowledge.",1321920000,4,448,5.1506849315068495
8445896,5,B004X1QGM8,"I purchased this film and loved it. Made my soul feel more comfortable with life on earth. Everyone who I showed it to loved it. I gifted my copy to the self made genius Jacque Fresco, and have just now ordered another one for myself again. I hope all at least watch this film if not own it. Peace Love and Light!",1318809600,5,313,4.064516129032258
8445897,5,B004X1QGM8,"Hi everyone, I just saw this movie this past week. It blew my mind. It's basically a spiritual metaphysical film about life after death and where the souls go.",1314403200,8,159,4.517241379310345
