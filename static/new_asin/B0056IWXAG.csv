8459701,4,B0056IWXAG,"This is a quite interesting DVD that investigates the evidence for large unknown primates in not just the Himalayas but also in North America.  It draws on the uncanny parallels between the two widely spaced regions as well as shedding new light on the famous yeti relics, ie the scalps.  I for one cannot see why it is so impossible that these creatures could exist.  Whether or not they are surviving Gigantopithecus remains to be seen.  Such a conclusion is hard to accept until such time as there is actual forensic evidence.  It is thought-provoking however, that the suggestion was made that this large extinct ape may actually walked erect anyway, to relieve the pressure of its weight on its body.",1421884800,,705,4.793388429752066
8459702,5,B0056IWXAG,Good video. National Geographic quality. I would recommend this vid to anyone with an interest in this subject. There is a lot of badly produced junk out there. This video is not one of them. You will not be disappointed.,1379808000,3,221,4.55
8459703,4,B0056IWXAG,"A solid entry his doesn't add much to the conversation that isn't already covered in the ""In Search of History"" Abominable Snowman special from History Channel (in fact, that has a little more in some instances) and this simply re-interviews many of the same people--from shirpas to academics--a few years later. This one is billed more as a modern reality TV adventure (like Man vs Wild) and it delivers on that to some degree, but not in spades. Our host is a famous mountaineer/kayaker and we spend a lot more time than usual focused on his trek into the Himalayas, which is fun but ultimately fruitless. From what I've seen, this is one of the three best yeti videos from a major distributer (with Monster Quest and the History Channel piece), but all of the information will be very familiar to anyone who has seen a yeti documentary before or done even the most rudimentary internet research. In fact, the best ""new"" yeti/bigfoot report I've heard was a BBC podcast about a new wrinkle in the famed ""yeti finger"" tale. This is light on adventure and info but is well-made and a good introductory overview. The best thing it has going for it is that it is modern-looking and a little more fun than most.",1357344000,,1208,4.623255813953488
