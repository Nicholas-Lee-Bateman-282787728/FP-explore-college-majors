I've noticed some of the translations are a little funny compared to the version I watched online, and it also misses some of the touches too, but despite that this is just what I wanted, and even a bit more.",1419811200,,324,3.8507462686567164
8473797,5,B005HWAOL6,"In this genre I find myself rooting for one of the girls, and usually I a go for the looser. That is part of the fun of this genre. Although the living of multiple lives in one world is later lamely explained, I think they could have just left it as it is to leave us guessing. If you like harem, you will love this.",1368403200,,316,3.876923076923077

8473799,4,B005HWAOL6,"Part two of Amagami picks up where part one [product link] left off. Again we follow TACHIBANA-kun through three narrative arcs, this time with the quiet but determined NANASAKI Ai, cheerful childhood friend Rihoko, and the brilliant, driven and mysterious Ayatsuji. Though I am a fan of the Kaoru arc in part 1, these three stories are, in my mind, the best of the bunch. NANASAKI's arc is fantastically cute, ends well, and reveals a slightly more stalwart TACHIBANA Junichi than in many of the early arcs. The Rihoko arc plays out pleasantly, with a more subtle love story than in the other arcs. Lastly, the Ayatsuji storyline seems to be the central arc in the series as it is the most complex. Ayatsuji's character provides for easily the most dramatic of plots, as Junichi is drawn into her warped psychology and significant personal demons and, through it all, drawn to her. There is also the extra KAMAZAKI Risa storyline which is easy to spoil so I won't say much. But we do learn more about that fateful Christmas day that so deeply scarred Junichi!

As with the first part, this is a good fit for fans of the romance/slice of life genre and, in my opinion, is the better of the two parts. My only gripe is that (***POSSIBLE SPOILER IMMANENT***) the Rihoko arc is the only one that ends ""differently"" than the others. Since they set her up as the slightly ""overweight"" of the characters (she is always talking about dieting, though I can't tell why from the illustrations), I am unhappy by what is implied by her being similarly singled out with a different ending. I feel this unnecessarily, and rather obviously, hints at a reinforcement of certain values that ought not be reinforced. But, in the end, this is a small gripe. And I rather like Rihoko's arc anyway.",1315440000,6,1777,4.677316293929713
