5883103,4,B00E0RJO9W,"Fate/Zero is and will continue to be one of my absolute favorite anime of all time. Therefore I don't regret my purchase.  But I still think that Aniplex and their products are a tad bit overpriced.

If you are a real fan of this series then this is a great addition to your collection. But if not then this is probably among the worst thing to spend your money on.",1429574400,,365,4.2
5883104,5,B00E0RJO9W,"I love the series, so I am a bit biased; however, the limited edition packaging is worth the extra money in my opinion.",1418688000,,119,4.217391304347826
5883105,5,B00E0RJO9W,"This is one of my top 5 shows that I've ever watched, the story, soundtrack and style are all amazing.  This show was well paced and kept me sitting at the edge of my seat sending shivers up my spine just with all the cliff hangers and rwistst. This is a must watch and buy.",1404345600,3,274,3.981818181818182
5883106,1,B00E0RJO9W,"Fate/Zero is amazing, I know this, you know this, anyone reading this knows this and normally I'd buy this right away no questions asked. However Aniplex's prices are just too stupidly ridiculous and until they realize this, hardly anyone will buy from them. Yes Aniplex is making money from the few people paying this much for their series, I say they'd sell and get much more if they dropped the price so the thousands of normal people who love Fate can buy it.",1392595200,30,463,4.590361445783133
5883107,5,B00E0RJO9W,This is a series that is a revision of the fate Stay Night Story.  It is suppose to happen previous to Fate Stay Night.  I bought this from rightstuf.com which sell anime.  The DVD is really good and the series is epic.  It was considered to be excellent rating by Anime News Network.  I watched this series and deem it very exciting.  The down side is you only get a pinup poster for the DVD set no soundtrack.  Yes the sacrifice of the soundtrack was worth it.  Sentai film works should consider putting the soundtrack for the DVD set as well. Either than that the DVD set is just as good as the Blue-ray disk.  When it comes to animation paying extra for blue-ray is just a waste of time because the video quality doesn't really change unless you are using a live film production.  The video is just fine for me.,1389916800,,815,4.302631578947368

8599898,3,B00E0RJO9W,The series is excellent. However disc 1 skips on episode 16 around 1:02:40. I bought a second set and same thing on the same exact time. Anyone else have had this problem?,1508630400,,171,4.375

8599903,4,B00E0RJO9W,"overall a very enjoyable series with overall good character development, entertaining action, and an interesting overall plot.  my only complaint - and it is minor - is that the ending questionably has a plot hole, though since i've not yet seen UBW entire new release as yet this point could well wind up being incorrect.  additionally the art style is good.  certainly one of the better anime series i've been able to see yet and certainly worth viewing or looking up.",1443052800,,470,4.777777777777778
8599904,5,B00E0RJO9W,"In 2012, animation was updated to next stage. ufotable production overthrew the limit of the TV anime.
I still can't believe Fate/zero was broadcast on TV every week.
The works created by ufotable must be milestones in history of Japanese animation.
By the way,there are three works that  especially satisfied fans of ufotable.
One is "" the garden of sinners "" , another is ""Fate/zero"" , the other is Fate/stay night .
""the garden of sinners"" is based on the novel written by Nasu Kinoko.
""Fate/stay night "" is the story for children of the characters in ""Fate/zero""
If you have a chance to watch them , please don't hesitate!",1442361600,,626,4.6909090909090905
8599905,4,B00E0RJO9W,"One of the boxes I ordered came slightly damaged, but nothing too serious and still in working condition. The anime is great, but whether or not it's worth its price is up to your discretion entirely.",1432598400,,200,4.583333333333333
