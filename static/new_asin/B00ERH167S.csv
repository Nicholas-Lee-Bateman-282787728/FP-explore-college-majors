8608688,1,B00ERH167S,"BORING!  Just one talk after another.  And the interviews were not even all that great.  This is an Unauthorized dvd.  So, nothing really felt up and personal.  I wasted $30, and spent less than $5 on Kay Perry's Part of Me video.  I would've paid that amount for Part of her anytime!",1407974400,,284,4.365384615384615
