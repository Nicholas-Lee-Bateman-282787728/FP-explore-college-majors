8309659,5,B000KG7WBE,"All the Beginner's Bible series are probably closest to the Bible of all the quality videos. But that gives parents or teachers the opportunity to correct or expand the history for the children. The next best thing about these videos is that they appeal to a wide age range. They have enough nuances for the older children, and while using vocabulary simple enough for two year olds, they don't bore the older ones. Too bad they won't offer DVD format.",1375401600,,452,4.6625
