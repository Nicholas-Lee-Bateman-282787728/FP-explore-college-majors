1621469,1,B00005LE3W,"I am sitting here in shock while reading the great reviews this movie has received.  This movie was horrible.  If I could, I wouldn't give this movie ANY stars.  The title suggests this is a movie about a horse, but it isn't.  There is a horse in the movie and that's about it.  The actors could not act, characters come in and out of the story with no rhyme or reason, and the whole story would have been pointless if the father character would have performed some actual parenting.  The ""bad guy"" was apparently a threat only to himself. Please do not waste your time.  If you need a good movie with horses, watch Hidalgo.",1183161600,6,624,4.373913043478261
1621470,4,B00005LE3W,I am a 13 girl who loves riding horses. I thought this movie was a lot like the story of Helen Keller but with horses. I thought the story was moving and that a lot of handicapped kids can find love in horses by relating to the story of Wind Dancer.,1174694400,3,249,3.9019607843137254
1621471,3,B00005LE3W,"My daughter is a horse lover so I bought this film for her.  Though she seemed to enjoyed it I don't think it will be played that often.  The horses are beautiful, the acting is a little stiff (particularly Mel Harris - though that may have been her take on the character).  Someone should have looked at the script more carefully for accuracy.  Little things like the ranch hand referring to the a time when Wind Dancer (a female) was a colt (male horse) really stuck out.  Brian Keith was good and I would have like to have seen more of him in the film.",1169510400,8,555,4.247619047619048
1621472,5,B00005LE3W,Really great film.  Focused on rehabilitating a young girl after an accident with the help of a horse. If you like both horses and movies about overcoming disability this is great.,1145664000,6,180,4.806451612903226
1621473,5,B00005LE3W,This movie is great for people who love horses! This movie teaches people that phisical therepy with horses can build up your self esteim!  I recomend this to anyone any age!,996105600,20,174,4.612903225806452

7943812,3,B00005LE3W,"This message movie that plays like a ""Very Special `Blossom'"" is suitable kiddie fare for parents who want to inspire some spunk in their Nintendo DS-obsessed kids, but grownups will really only appreciate it for the performance of Brian Keith, who plays the good-hearted curmudgeon role he built his career on.

To sum up, a remarkably Blossom-looking teen ends up in a wheelchair after taking a bad spill off her horse, so her dad brings her and a kid shrink to Keith's ranch, where she predictably becomes attached to a palomino named Wind Dancer.

While faux-Blossom's relationship with Wind Dancer helps her heal, some conniving horse thieves - played more broadly and terribly than Jason Alexander and Renee Russo did ""Boris and Natasha"" - have their own plans for the horse.

Faux-Blossom is a good little actress, and it's sad what happened to her later in life (Google it). It's also sad what happened to Brian Keith a couple years later (Google that, too), but his fans know that and are happy he left understated little performances like this in his legacy.

Regardless, ""Wind Dancer"" is cut from the same cloth as a ""Hallmark Hall of Fame"" flick, and those are always good for a Family Movie Night, for those of you who use DVDs to spark poignant family discussion instead of as a tool to leave the kids drooling in front of SpongeBob while you do whatever it is you consider more important than spending time with your kids.

""Wind Dancer"" is part of a 15-movie set from Echo Bridge that costs a fin at K-Mart, and it's a standout on a DVD that's not worth much more than that. I recommend buying it, especially because that set also includes the sweet Africa-set movie ""Askari,"" which harkens back to Disney's early 1970s live-action films, and is worth all five bucks on its own.

Don't go Netflixing ""Wind Dancer"" otherwise, unless you have kids for whom you're looking to teach a Very Valuable Lesson that you don't have the parenting skills to teach without a movie nobody's ever heard of.

But if you do decide to talk to your kids about ""Wind Dancer,"" I recommend including the life story of the lead actress as a cautionary tale.",1359158400,,2150,4.687002652519894
7943813,5,B00005LE3W,Haven't watched this movie yet.  Thought the grandkids would like it as one of them is crazy about horses and continually draws animals.  She's only 7 but loves to draw horses and dogs.,1357603200,,185,4.575757575757576
7943814,2,B00005LE3W,"Wind Dancer starts off a little shaky, but if you can put that aside, you'll find you're watching a movie that in many regards, closely resembles a mixing of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Horse-Whisperer/dp/6305128952/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Horse Whisperer</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flicka/dp/B000O39MZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flicka</a>.

Frankly, Paige (Raeanin Simpson) in Wind Dancer can't hold a candle to Grace (Scarlett Johansson) in The Horse Whisperer, nor to Katy (Alison Lohman) in Flicka. She's not particularly likeable, nor terribly compelling. The therapist, Susan Allen (Mel Harris) lacks the charm of Tom Booker (Robert Redford, The Horse Whisperer), but does serve as a stubborn foil to a reluctant Paige.

Older viewers should probably skip this movie in favor of the grittier, starker presentation of The Horse Whisperer.

Still, for children, Wind Dancer's generally lighter feel may be more suitable than The Horse Whisperer, and may offer parents an opportunity to discuss the conquering of fears and disabilities without deeply upsetting them.",1353456000,,1190,6.92
7943815,5,B00005LE3W,"I was very impressed with the movie Wind Dancer. It was excellent and I would recommand it to anyone, who enjoys good family movies.",1347753600,,132,4.541666666666667

7943817,5,B00005LE3W,"I remember first catching this movie a long time ago on a movie channel and admit I didn't exactly think it would be much of anything. But as soon as I started watching I was hooked from beginning to end and would watch it whenever I caught it in the TV guide. I was super excited to find it finally on DVD.

It's a movie that'll give you inspiration, and make you shed tears of joy throughout. It sets a good message to anyone who's been through a hard time and thought that there was no light at the end of the tunnel.",1344816000,,520,4.048543689320389
7943818,4,B00005LE3W,"This is a good story with a good moral about working hard, and how to be a firm but caring parent.  It had horses as a backdrop but wasn't really a horse story per se.  The little girl in the story gets injured in a horse accident right away and the story is about her recovery, her dads guilt and her feeling sorry for herself.  She is coached by a female therapist who gives her the ""tough love"" she needs to snap out of her self pity.  It is interesting enough to keep the attention of adults and children about 7+ y.o.  The best thing about the movie is the opprotunity it gives a parent to discuss having a winning ""I can do it"" attitude, something my daughter needs to work on.  We had some good dialogue after the movie and I referred back to it since then.  However, I don't think my daughter will choose to watch it on her own again.  It would be a good one to rent too.",1199664000,4,879,4.069767441860465
