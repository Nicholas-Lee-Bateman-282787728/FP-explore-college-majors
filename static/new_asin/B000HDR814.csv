2634914,4,B000HDR814,"The second season of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" arrives on DVD a year after the first set. I suspect Universal wanted to gage the reaction from fans before moving forward with future sets. Luckily Universal has abandoned the dual sided dual layered discs that they had many manufacturing problems with on the first season set. Instead they've opted for single sided dual layered DVDs. We get five DVDs housed in a boxed set the same size as the first (with the same cover design but with the title card in green vs. blue). As before the episodes are listed on the inside and out flaps of the cardboard holder. Unfortunately none of them list which ones were directed by Hitchcock.

Four of the five discs in the set are on top of each other. As with the first set Hitch directed some of these himself--four to be exact ""Wet Saturday"", ""Mr. Blanchard's Secret"", ""One More Mile To Go""and ""The Three Dreams of Mr. Findlater"". I watched these first. ""Wet Saturday"" is a droll story of murder and looks at the wrong man theme that is prevelant in Hitch's work.

***Warning a couple of spoilers ahead***

In ""Wet Saturday"" (on disc one)A father (Cedric Hardwick) discovers his idiotic daughter has murdered a boy she thought was in love with her. When the boy foolishly admits he is in love with someone else she clocks him. The dim witted siblings conspire with their father to try and cover up the murder when a friend (John Williams) comes to visit. This provides them with the perfect set up and alibi.

""One More Mile to Go"" (on disc four) demonstrates the brilliant visual sense that Hitch always used in his films. It's a stand out episode. The episode opens with a shot of a muffled argument between a husband and wife seen through the front window of their house. We don't hear what is said but don't need to as we see the way it ends. How you ask? Why with murder of course! Visually stunning with smooth camera work a story that unfolds building suspense with virtually no dialogue in the first fifteen minutes (at least none that can be made out) and a nice O. Henry type pay off at the end the episode is prime Hitch undermined only by the melodramatic music score. Although Bernard Hermann would have been a bit too expensive for the episode it simply cries out for one of his unusual atonal scores.

That's not to suggest that the rest of the episodes are trash--far from it and the half hour episodes all have top notch writers (Stirling Silliphant, Evan Hunter), TV directors (Robert Stevens, John Meredyth Lucas, Paul Henreid) and casts (Sir Cedric Hardwick, John Williams, William Shatner, Jessica Tandy, Hume Cronyn). The half hour format works well for most of these ""mini-movies"".

The show looks good in its presentation. There aren't any extras as with the first set (which included a featurette on the production of the series). I would have liked to see a commentary or two comparing the production of Hitch's TV shows vs. his films or, at the very least, a featurette focusing on the various directors that worked on the show. We get ""Sneak Peeks"" which are previews of other Universal TV shows. It's a pity that no one thought to do a featurette on the other directors (such as TV stalwarts like Paul Heinrid,Robert Stevens and others) that worked regular on the show).

From early viewing it appears this is a superior set to the first just because they discontinued the dual sided discs. Definitely worthwhile for fans of Hitchcock and suspense dramas. I do think that Universal should reissue the first season (and exchange a revised 3 disc dual sided set for 6 single sided DVDs). It would be good customer service. Unlike the first set I can recommend the second season for fans of the show.",1161043200,29,3719,4.651445966514459

I know everyone will enjoy these episodes as much as I did. I've spent the last 24 hours watching all 39 episodes & let me tell you there Great!! The picture quality is great, the sound is great. No problems here!! There are many well known stars in this set that were just starting out when AHP aired on tv. A lot of the episodes seen in this set, were never seen on Nick at Night. I used to watch them when they were on & I would have remembered them. I know everyone will be very pleased with this set. Universal finally did the right thing by putting them on 5 single sided DVD'S. I wish I could give this set more than 5 stars. This set is well worth the money that you will pay for it. THANK YOU UNIVERSAL FOR FINALLY DOING IT RIGHT!!!!!",1161043200,81,1799,4.067605633802817
2634916,3,B000HDR814,"This wonderful collection of programs is seriously marred by poor production

quality of the discs themselves.  I had to return two sets due to one or

two defective discs per box.  I finally kept the third box, despite a bad

disc.  Is adequate production too much to ask of the manufacturer?",1160870400,13,293,4.647058823529412
2634917,4,B000HDR814,"I own and love season one and I'm anxiously looking forward to the second season. I just wish Universal would speed up the releases. Some of my favorite episodes are among the ""Alfred Hitchcock Hour"" episodes, which are actually the last three seasons of ""Presents"".

 They include the much talked about gems such as ""The Jar"" about a farmer, a jar containing mysterious contents and his loony, jealous wife. A truly creepy and disturbing episode. Another classic is ""An Unlocked Window"" about a group of nurses on a stormy night with a killer on the loose. I don't want to have to wait 7-9 years for Universal to release these.",1158105600,18,628,4.7
2634918,5,B000HDR814,I have always loved this show. Great endings and great stories and acting. There are several episodes I'll be seeing for the first time.

2634919,5,B000HDR814,"I can't wait for this second season to FINALLY be released.  I bought the first set on a whim and WOW was I pleasantly surprised.  I never knew Alfred Hitchcock had such a fun personality and such wicked humor before viewing his little intro's and exits during each episode.
This set includes 39 episodes from the 1956-1957 season.
The casts of each show are superb and the certain actors who show up in other episodes are always welcome as the new characters they play.
If you love short, play-like drama's (some are comedy's in a dark vain) you owe it to yourself to check out both season sets and join me and others who hope that the studio's will quickly release all of the seasons for us fans.
Peace  :o)",1156464000,17,709,4.438461538461539

We can enjoy this show on DVD without any freezing or skipping. Thank you Universal. You made all of us Hitchcock fans very happy!",1156118400,52,397,4.527777777777778
2634921,4,B000HDR814,"I ordered this last year. I'm a big fan of Alfred Hitchcock, and had all seasons but this one. The shows are fantastic! I have knocked off a star because I couldn't get them to play at first, and one of the plastic pieces that holds the disk in was broken. After Purchasing a new disk player, played fine. Seemed like a lot of hassle to replace for a broken casing. Otherwise I would've given it a 5 star!! Love this show!",1485820800,,422,4.158536585365853
2634922,5,B000HDR814,"The master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock had been directing films for more than thirty years when he began hosting the weekly series ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents.""  The half-hour show aired for eleven seasons on CBS and NBC. Hitchcock himself directed several of these episodes.

Each episode would begin with the image of a profile caricature of Hitchcock as Charles Gounod's ""Funeral March of a Marionette"" played in the background. Then Hitchcock would walk into the frame and line up with his profile of the caricature before addressing the audience  in his droll delivery about the upcoming episode. Hitchcock would appear a second time at the end of the episode with a final observation and an invitation to return for the next week's show.

Just like season one, season two aired 39 episodes. All episodes run approximately 25 minutes with a total running time of 16 hrs. 52 min. All episodes are in black-and-white and full frame 1.33:1. Unlike the season one DVD,  the subtitle option for these episodes is English only. All discs are one-sided discs; there are no bonus features. The episodes are presented in the sequence in which they originally aired from Sep. 30, 1956 to June 23, 1957. (An asterisk indicates those episodes directed by Hitchcock.)

2634944,2,B000HDR814,"The episodes here in the season 2 set have been edited, and missing the original opening and closing title cards. What you get is the syndicated versions. The opening and close themes and credits from all the episodes on pretty much of all of the seasons are the same. I know that first generation, old syndication prints released in the 60's at least had the original music associated with them, albeit fairly chopped up when the sponsors announcements were eliminated. You could actually see the splices in the films when watching them.  Anyway, the episodes here are good quality prints. I think that Alfred Hitchcock's opening and closing monologues were shuffled around a bit as well, some are not the ones that originally came with their respective episode. Why couldn't they just leave them alone, and present them as they were originally intended.  I bought 5 of the seasons, and sampled a few episodes off each one. The Review Studios end logos are all chopped off as well.  Someone earlier said that a few of the episodes do contain the original Bristol Meyers openings and ads, but haven't caught any of those yet. There isn't even a hint of bonus material in any of them as well, unless there are some Easter Eggs that I haven't found yet. Only season with a hint of Bonus Material is in season 4 , where you get a slideshow of some of Hitch's artwork. Other than the fact that the video quality is fairly decent, I can give it only 2 stars. A disappointment.",1445212800,,1471,4.628352490421456

If you loved the first season, or one of Hitchcock's  suspenseful movies like Dial M for Murder, you will be pleasantly entertained by these harrowing adventures.",1436054400,,494,4.811764705882353

This is unquestionably a superb viewing experience.

Top-notch plots, acting, filming, etc.

What more could one ask for, you might say?

Well, how about a nice clean audio recording of the opening title, for one thing?

The theme music which ""graces"" the very opening menu screen has to be one of the worst, most distorted botch-jobs I have heard in years. And I am an audio engineer.  The theme music from the individual chapters is far superior to what you hear in the beginning as the disc loads up.  Then, one might ask this:

""Why not just hire a small chamber ensemble of musicians to render a really terrific recording of the theme""?

Or am I dreaming?

The audio used in the intro and ending of most of the individual episodes would have been a wiser choice on the part of the folks at Universal who issued this otherwise pristine edition.

Maybe this has been corrected in the other seasonal presentations, but for me to hear that God-awful distorted recording of the theme was quite a surprise.  Otherwise, this is quite an astonishing effort at presenting all 39 episodes of Season Two.",1285632000,,1211,4.550925925925926

  Yesterday, I looked up this series on the Wilkipedia web site and I believe it stated that the series went on for 14 seasons- (note: as of March, 2012, someone pointed out an error, and I've since discovered that there were ten seasons consisting of 7 half-hour- incl. commercials-, and 3 one-hour seasons)! That's great of course, but what that also means is that some lucky individuals (who have the patience to wait years for the most likely inevitable gigantic box-set), will probably save a couple hundred dollars! Oh well, I'm sure most of us don't have that much patience!
  I have Season 1, and I recieved season's 2 and 3 from Amazon over a month ago, but only opened no. 2 just last night. Yes, so far it's great. I've thus far only watched about 4 episodes and the only problem was a sparodic loud ""snapping"" sound that happened for about a minute (off and on), during the show about a brother and sister trying to collect insurance money by tricking a hobo, while setting their house on fire, etc. I don't remember the title off hand, but hopefully I won't encounter any more of these flaws because it's too late to send this back. Other than that, one thing I'm very happy about, is that I haven't seen any of these shows before, since I was too young (a toddler?) at the time, and probably wasn't allowed to watch it until I was some years older (no doubt, because it was too ""scary""), and therefore, hadn't started watching it until sometime after it had turned into ""The Alfred Hitchcock Hour"".

2635006,5,B000HDR814,"With this second-season box set of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment releases the second installment of one of the greatest television series of all time - with absolutely wonderful picture quality and totally botched-up editing that seems almost to destroy the experience. At least, that's what I thought at first.

One of the troubling things about Universal's first two box sets (another is on its way, covering the third season) is that Alfred Hitchcock's introductions and postscripts aren't the ones we've come to know and love after more than 40 years of syndicated re-runs. Because it's not just the wicked and subversive stories that make this series one of the high-water marks of television. It's also Alfred Hitchcock's presence as host, with his droll delivery, his apparent delight in murder, and his obvious distaste for being interrupted by commercials.

For those of us who love this show, Universal's first box set was a mixed bag. We'd been waiting for it since like, forever. The technical process of the remastering had been accomplished beautifully. But the product was presented on a type of disk (double-sided, double-density) that played poorly in most DVD machines. And even worse, Alfred Hitchcock's introductions and postscripts were edited so badly that many of them seemed incoherent. (A few of the shows were exactly as they aired originally - they even contained a title card indicating that the show was ""Brought to you by Bromo-Seltzer,"" which was deleted when the show went into syndication - but most of the shows appeared to be edited, and not very skillfully, either.) Wherever Hitchcock made a snide comment about his sponsor, the footage was snipped, and even if you hadn't been a fan, you would have noticed something was missing. Most of Hitchcock's appearances on these disks seemed like a joke without a punchline. It was hard to understand why Universal would commit such an atrocity. Did some scissors-happy gnome in Hollywood think we'd be confused if Hitchcock made funny remarks about the upcoming commercial, if the DVD didn't contain the commercial?

I was so dismayed by that first-season set that when the second was released, I delayed a year before buying a copy. Judging by the angry comments I saw on this forum, I could see that this second-season set had the same problem.

But now that I've finally bought the set and I've started watching these disks, I think I finally understand what happened. It's the strangest thing: Universal, without explanation, has decided to give us the BRITISH version of the show.

One thing few people know is that Hitchcock filmed multiple introductions for each program - one for American audiences, one for the British, and one for the French (or so I've read). In the second-season box set, the introductions and postscripts are decidedly different than the ones that we saw in America. A few of them are edited from the American versions, but most of them do not appear to have been edited, and these follow a much different format than the ones that aired in the states. If you watch closely, you'll see that there is no place where a commercial might have been inserted. At the same time, the content is decidedly un-American.

I'll offer a couple of examples.  One of the clearest clues comes in the introduction to the episode, ""Nightmare in 4-D."" Hitchcock's comments begin,

""Good evening. Tonight's play is entitled 'Nightmare in 4-D.' It will be presented in only two dimensions, however. We could present it in 3-D. In fact, we did in America, but the viewers kept getting involved, and during one of the more violent scenes we lost half our audience. We wouldn't want that to happen here.""

In another program, we find a clue that is even more telling. In the postscript to the episode ""Crackpot,"" we see Hitchcock standing in what he describes as an impregnable ""sealed chamber."" Suddenly, from behind him, someone pounds on the wall with a sledgehammer and knocks a hole in the plaster. ""I knew it,"" Hitchcock says. ""It's the I.T.A. It's futile to try to escape. We shall be back with another play. Don't you try to escape.""

This had me scratching my head -- it's a reference that means absolutely nothing to me, and I'm sure it means nothing to anyone in this country. But after a little searching on the Internet, I found out what Hitchcock must have meant. He must have been referring to Britain's Independent Television Authority, a commercial network that started operation two years before this particular episode was shown.

Suddenly everything makes sense, and since Universal hasn't bothered answering customer emails, and its DVD packaging contains no information about the source of the shows, let me outline a scenario that might explain it all. In Britain, Hitchcock's show must have been presented on the BBC, which didn't carry commercials - and so all those snide remarks about the sponsor wouldn't have made any sense. In the first season, these references were crudely deleted, along with the fade-to-black points where commercials might have been inserted. (Perhaps the series hadn't been picked up in Britain at the time the first-season episodes were filmed.) But for the second season, Hitchcock filmed additional introductions and postscripts for the British market, a vast improvement over the previous season. If I'm right about this, I suppose these DVDs are a little more authentic than I thought before. My outrage has been subdued.

But is the British version the right version to be presenting in a ""definitive"" collection of the series? Absolutely not.

It's an American show. Always was, always will be. It aired first on American networks. The American version is the most complete. After 40 years of re-runs, we EXPECT Hitchcock to say nasty things about the upcoming commercial, and when he doesn't, we feel cheated. Heck, it wasn't so long ago that these shows were running every day on cable TV. It's not as if the American shows have been lost - we've been watching them all along. This British format just doesn't feel right. Even if the editing was done 50 years ago, many of the butchered introductions and postscripts don't make sense; at best, they don't flow very well. And the ones specially-filmed for the British audience don't strike me as interesting as the ones we saw over here. (Perhaps they might be included on future releases as a ""Bonus Feature."")

I hope Universal did the right thing and used the American version of the show in its Season Three box set. We'll know when it comes out next month. At least Universal got one thing right in this second release - it abandoned the double-sided disks. The standard-type disks in this set appear to play perfectly. (I probably should make a technical point here as well, to avoid confusion -- this might be the British version of the show, but there are none of the problems associated with PAL to NTSC transfers, because the show was produced on film in the first place.)

Look, this is one of the best TV series ever. The stories are classics, and there's a style to this show we rarely see today, emphasizing character rather than action or cinematography. The original packaging was absolutely brilliant, with those witty Hitchcock bits at the beginning and end of each program. The sheer number of these shows is absolutely staggering - there were some 260 episodes of the half-hour Alfred Hitchcock Presents, and another three seasons of the Alfred Hitchcock Hour. I can't wait to buy them all. I guess this is my way of saying that the way this show is presented - it matters.

Those Brits didn't know what they were missing.

""In a Little Sleep"", Vic Morrow plays a demented youth who is the picture of innocence.  He does not fully comprehend his actions.  He thinks his victims are just sleeping and will be alright when they wake up in the morning.  His latest victim is the new owner of the house he trespassed.  She became a victim when she told Benny (Vic Morrow) his girlfriend was never coming back because his brother had killed her.  In his rage, he fought with his brother and shot him.

2635009,4,B000HDR814,"Alfred Hitchcock Presents was a truly entertaining show and one of the first examples of anthology drama long before The Twilight Zone was even conceived. The show itself rates 5 stars with me. I take issue with the fact that these shows are obviously NOT uncut. I can understand shaving a bit off the original episodes when the series is aired in syndication on commercial television. Gotta make room for what's REALLY important, right? The commercials! That's just a fact of life that we have come to accept. BUT.... when a box set of a TV series is put together for its dedicated fans, one would expect the episodes to be the original uncut versions, wouldn't one? After all, aren't they supposed to be created from the original masters? Well, that's not the case with this box set. Each episode in this set tends to run between 24 and 25 minutes. Back when this show was originally aired, there was generally one commercial break near the midway point of the episode that lasted about one or two minutes, so allowing for the missing commercial time, that still leaves two or three minutes missing; time which was obviously cut from each episode.

Having read the previous reviews here, I see that others noticed portions of Hitchcock's opening and closing dialog had been cut off. I accept that reluctantly, as it does not detract from the original episode itself, however when they cut portions out of the actual play, they mess with the integrity of the show, in my opinion, and I find that far less acceptable. I first realized that at least some (and probably most, if not all) of the shows were cut upon viewing the episode on disc 2 titled ""Jonathan'. The closing credits listed an appearance by Nancy Kulp, who I knew as Jane Hathaway from the Beverly Hillbillies. It struck me that I never noticed her in the episode, so I went back to the beginning and forwarded through it. Nope. No Nancy Kulp in this show!

This is probably a bigger deal to me than to most viewers, so you may not share my ire about this, however to me, this is close to sacrilege. If I buy a CD of my favorite music group's greatest hits, I don't want the songs cut short. I don't want the pop radio's shortened versions, I want the entire song, as the band meant it to be heard. Because of this heinous bit of editing, I have taken two whole stars away from this offering. That and the fact that there are no extras to speak of. I give it four stars, however, because I have added a star for the packaging. Season one was produced on 'flipper discs'. That's what they call discs that have data on both sides of it. Flipper discs are much easier to scratch than one-sided discs, for obvious reasons, and they have also been known to be prone to picture freezing and skipping. Happily, season two has been pressed onto one-sided discs, and that alone earns this my fourth star.

Don't misunderstand, this is still an enjoyable box set, however just knowing that I'm not getting every episode in it's entirety bothers me. I don't believe these shows should be packaged like that, and I am disappointed with Universal for doing that to us. Peace.",1186876800,12,3127,4.56049822064057

On the Season 2 discs, I would swear that someone at Universal deleted Hitchcock's snide remarks aimed at the sponsors.  If you watch the prelude and postscript of each program carefully, you will notice that they do not always flow properly and that something is missing.  What they cut out were Hitch's insults aimed at the commercial sponsors (back in the days when commercials didn't take up 30% of the air time).  These shots at the sponsors were the funniest parts of the original programs and one of the main items that made the Alfred Hitchcock Presents series a huge success and a lasting classic from early TV.
I sent an E-mail to Universal about this atrocity but they never replied.  Hopefully they will get the message and decide not to tamper with Season 3.",1184889600,6,996,4.567415730337078

Taking the master of suspense at his word, none of the wrongdoers in these stories ever got away with their crimes. At least, that's what he told his American audience. In Britain and elsewhere, rather than dwell on right vs. wrong, Hitchcock's host segments were filled with amusing commentary about the curious Americans and their customs.

(Note: He recorded these alternate pieces in English, French and German-- Hitchcock was fluent in all three languages.)

His stable of regulars once again deliver fine performances, the scripts are well-written and direction and photography expert. Transfer to DVD quality is of the highest caliber. This second full season of ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS is certain to please the most discriminating of vintage TV show collectors, while Hitchcock fans will be most delighted.

2635015,3,B000HDR814,"There is no mystery as to how R.J. Reynolds made their fortune when you see the level of cigarette smoking that goes on in these old shows.  They certainly got plenty from me until I wised up, but I digress.  Season 2 is much the same as Season 1--it's all about Hitch.  Take Hitchcock out of the mix and you've got some creaky old stories without a lot of mystery or suspense.  Mind you, they were great in their time, and they are well acted by a combination of old pros (Claude Raines, Cedric Hardwicke)and very good newcomers (Dick York, Robert Culp), and very nicely directed (sometimes by Hitch himself).  But time and 50 years of TV mysteries have not been kind to these wooley old tales, and they pretty much telegraph their twists.

For some reason Hitch layed off the sponsors in Season 2, but his arch and acerbic comments are still what makes the show.  That and his trademark winking addendums that always reassert that ""crime doesn't pay"" are the great fun here.  For me, I enjoyed them as a one-time viewing and remembering how unique the shows were for the time.  But, I would seriously doubt that having seen them, many would want to watch them again so I would put this in the ""rent-not-buy"" category.",1177372800,2,1219,4.529680365296803

Years later I see myself having found this treasure chest. The beauty is that there are no annoying commercials and you can enjoy Mr. Hitchcock's sly wit before and after every episode.

The beauty of his works always is that he manages to shock you without any shred of gore any any disgusring images which are called ""frightfest"" today.

I higly recommend it, I have the first already and can't wait till I get the news that the third box is released. Luckily this show ran for quite a bit of time.",1168300800,3,699,4.361538461538461
2635028,5,B000HDR814,"I was very pleased to be able to add ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Season Two"" to my TV-DVD collection on October 17, 2006, when Universal Studios Home Entertainment officially put this 5-Disc set into circulation. And the video quality looks very nice here too, in my opinion. These black-and-white prints for this second ""AHP"" season (from 1956-1957) have survived in admirable shape.

This set includes all 39 second-year ""AHP"" episodes on five single-sided, dual-layered discs (which is a nice change from the first-season set, which has thirty-nine shows placed onto three double-sided DVDs). These 2nd-season shows appear to be uncut for the most part too.

A few seconds of Hitchcock's dialogue may possibly have been trimmed here and there (leading into what were the commercials breaks when the shows originally aired), but nothing of a substantive nature has been cut out from what I can detect. And the running times would tend to back up that conclusion as well. In sampling a few episodes from Disc #1, I found running times of 26:11, 26:21, 25:28, and 25:33 for the first four programs.

I, personally, have experienced very little difficulty at all while playing any two-sided discs from Universal, but I still like the fact that USHE now seems to be utilizing the one-sided DVD format for most of its television catalog. The single-sided discs look nicer too....they aren't as plain-looking, in that the single-siders include a label on each DVD, complete with photos, show title, and of course an easy-to-read disc number.

The same photo of Mr. Hitchcock (holding a hangman's noose, which seems fairly appropriate) is displayed on each of the five disc labels in this AHP-2 collection. It might have been nicer to have a different picture adorning each of the discs....but the redundant photo doesn't bother me at all. Heck, I just like opening this package and seeing SOME type of label on the DVDs, period.

Other than the switch to the single-sided discs, this set is almost identical to the Season-One release in most respects (such as the packaging and the DVD menu design and layout).

The Main Menu provides choices for ""Episode Index"", ""Subtitles"", and a ""Play All"" option. (The ""Play All"" can be accessed from any of the ""Episode Index"" menu screens as well.)

Eight shows occupy each disc (except Disc #5, which has seven). English subtitles are available for each program. The ""Episode List"" (title only) text screens that were a part of the first-season release have not been included in this second-season boxed set.

Universal has also elected to omit the episode description text screens from the S.2 menus. A wise move too, because a lot of ""spoilers"" were revealed in the S.1 show summaries. For Season Two, when an individual episode is selected, you're taken straight to the episode (without going to a sub-menu first).

Unlike Season One, chapter breaks have been inserted for all 39 of these year-two episodes, which I like a lot. There are four total chapters (scenes) per program. Advancing past the first ""chapter"" takes the viewer directly to Act 1 of the episode, while skipping the opening credits as well as bypassing Hitchcock's prologue/introduction.

Alfred's droll intros are fun to see....but being able to get right to the beginning of the body of the program with one quick click is quite handy too. That's a very nice chaptering option to have.

I haven't seen many of these Hitchcock episodes for quite some time, so some pleasant memories were rekindled when I watched some of the AHP shows on these DVDs -- including the following impressive entries:

""Fog Closing In"", ""None Are So Blind"", ""De Mortuis"", ""Vicious Circle"", ""Father And Son"", ""Nightmare In 4-D"", ""Kill With Kindness"", ""The Night The World Ended"", ""Mr. Blanchard's Secret"", and the three-part story starring frequent AHP guest star John Williams entitled ""I Killed The Count"".

In addition to the above-mentioned installments, the Season-Two episode I enjoy the most is ""One More Mile To Go"" (first aired on April 7, 1957). I actually had no idea that this episode was even going to be a part of the S.2 collection, so it was a real treat indeed to see this one pop up in the Episode Index on Disc #4. It is also one of the very few episodes directed by Mr. Hitchcock himself during this second season of his television series.

""One More Mile To Go"" stars David Wayne and is an episode filled with tension, suspense, and the one thing that frightened the daylights out of Director Alfred Hitchcock more than anything else -- the police. According to Mr. Hitchcock's daughter (Pat), and via interviews with Hitch himself in the years prior to his death at age 80 on April 29, 1980, Alfred very much feared the police.

Perhaps that fear of ""men in blue"" was the springboard for episodes like ""One More Mile"", which has a script that features a motorcycle cop trailing after David Wayne throughout the program. And, according to what Pat Hitchcock has said in the past about her father, ""nothing could be more menacing than that"" (i.e., being pursued relentlessly by a policeman) -- especially if the person being chased (in this case Wayne) has a terrible secret he wants to hide....a ""secret"" in the form of something that Wayne stuffed into the trunk of his car shortly before being pulled over by that menacing man in the blue uniform.

""One More Mile To Go"" has been compared in some ways to the movie ""Psycho"" (which Hitchcock directed three years later). I hadn't really thought about the ""Psycho"" comparisons in the past, but the AHP episode does mirror that iconic Hitch film in several ways, including the part of a policeman tailing the car being driven by the story's main character.

I could probably watch ""One More Mile"" every day of the week and not tire of it. It's an episode that has an eerie and mysterious quality that, for me, makes each repeat viewing just as satisfying as the one that preceded it.

These early Hitchcock shows were delightful. They often contained a murder, and managed often to be humorous anyway.

This season contain probably the only three-part story, ""I Killed the Count"", which was adapted from a 1937 play which I read was very successful. A Scotland Yard inspector becomes more and more frustrated as not one, not two, not three, but FOUR people confess to a murder! It's hilarious. Near the end of part three, when they realize they may not be able to prosecute ANYONE for the crime, the Inspector's assistant delivers the marvelous line:""Well, the good news is, at least he needed killing!""

Hitchcock's introductions and wrap-ups are always amusingly ironic, and he often hams them up entertainingly. Of course, virtually every story has a surprise twist at the end -- that's just Hitchcock.",1515715200,,1024,4.907514450867052
