3873907,1,B0028S77PS,"I bought it because I have first two. I wanted to now the ending to Santi's story but he jumps to the background. After seen it is clear that most of the plot points were meant for Santi but were given to the other two. If you seen the first two then that is all you need and given.

Pros: None

Cons: Weak story, low budget production, former main character jumps back to a barely there character.",1360540800,5,398,4.1558441558441555

3873909,1,B0028S77PS,"I enjoyed the first two movies of this trilogy. I really hope that this one would be a great end for this trilogy.

But the result is... I had to eject the disc after watched it for 45 minutes.

The  movie was suck. Bad plot . Bad production. They ruined the first two movies radically.

I heard that the producer ran out of money to produce the good movie. So that's why they made it only for DVD/Blu-ray  , not in theatre grade.",1341705600,4,430,4.132530120481928
3873910,1,B0028S77PS,"I loved the first Goal and enjoyed the second installment, couldn't wait for the next one.  I really wanted to see what was going to happen with Roz and Santiago.

3873911,1,B0028S77PS,Movie doesn't have any ties to the other two parts.  The CG isn't all that good.  I wouldn't recommend watching this movie.  Stick to the first two parts.,1333929600,8,154,4.428571428571429

3873914,1,B0028S77PS,"This movie simply doesn't have anything to do with the previous movies. It not even continues the story from the second movie. No answer is given about that. The story is about other characters and Santiago Munes is a merely piece without any importance. And the quality of the film is very, very bellow the previous...",1318550400,14,319,4.714285714285714
3873915,2,B0028S77PS,"Do not waste your money. Not enough football scenes.
Santi is back but plays a small part.
To many social and club scenes.
If you want a good football movie get goal 1.

3873919,2,B0028S77PS,"It was rather disappointing. Santiago had so little to do with this movie. Had hoped it picked up where Goal II left off.  Had I seen the movie first, I would not have bought it.",1412726400,2,178,4.085714285714285

3873922,2,B0028S77PS,"After watching Goal 1 and 2 I was expecting a great finish. I was VERY DISAPPOINTED.  If I had known more about Goal three before I bought it, I would have keep my money. I'm a big soccer fan and will watch almost anything that has to do with soccer, but this was not only a waste of money, but also a waste of my time watching.",1396224000,2,328,3.8955223880597014
3873923,5,B0028S77PS,What I do for my Spanish class is gives them a worksheet about the movie. They need to watch the movie and listen for clues to write on their worksheets after the do this they will have to fill in the blanks with the correct answers about the movie. this is good for them because you see how they think about what happen in the movie.,1392854400,,334,4.075757575757576
3873924,1,B0028S77PS,"This movie has nothing to do with previous Goal 1 and 2, also the scenes are terrible, the history it's a soap opera a bad drama in which Santiago Mu&ntilde;ez doesn't play any role , we couldn't find out what happened with his girlfriend who got pregnant in Goal 2 for example. It's a very bad movie , very disappointed a waste of Money and time.",1376438400,4,347,4.2727272727272725
