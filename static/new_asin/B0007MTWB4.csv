8048987,5,B0007MTWB4,Puppy Tales: Adorable Puppies is just the thing to bring a smile to the face of a little one.  It also brought a smile to this Aunt's face.,1357084800,,139,3.9642857142857144
8048988,4,B0007MTWB4,"My mother has dementia and loves dogs.  Other than a great-grandchild, she loves watching the puppies play on this dvd.  The good thing about this dvd is, you have the option of voices or music as well as one-time viewing or a loop.  I prefer the music rather than the voices.  Since she is unable to manage the remote, when I need leave for a while, I use the loop so it will play until I get back.",1294876800,,399,4.076923076923077
8048989,1,B0007MTWB4,"My opinion of this product was so low I returned it and am waiting for a refund.

The video would not respond to a comand ""by design"".

Very dissappointing.",1169078400,,156,4.344827586206897
8048990,4,B0007MTWB4,"I could see how this DVD would be too repetitive to entertain an older child, but my 14 month old loves to look at puppies on TV, so this works for us.  There's also an option to play the skits without the silly voices, just music, and that makes it a little better.  Overall a good buy.",1140739200,,287,4.017543859649122
8048991,5,B0007MTWB4,"Obviously, my review is biased because I made this DVD.  As I write this, there is one fairly scathing review of Puppy Tales.  Puppy Tales could have just been a DVD that put on for your dog when you leave the house - a little company for your pet.  But we tried to make this for humans, too.  Now, you can just watch the puppies run around being cute.  However, we tried to do something a little more clever.

We got some improv comedians to supply the voices for the puppies.  We developed outrageous scenarios for each breed and set the comedians loose.  See the ""customer images"" and ""description"" for a description of each scenario.  Just like any bit of comedy, laughter is in the eye of the beholder.

So, I've said my peace and hope you find Puppy Tales to be enjoyable.",1139529600,,778,4.3776223776223775

The only thing that this DVD would be good for is a gag gift, because it is actually so bad that it makes you laugh - but only in a painful kind of way.  What it is, is a series of amateur footage of different breeds of puppies, with each breed being shown for about five minutes.  While you are viewing the puppies, you listen to the inane chatter of the narrators, whose dialogue is so pathetic that after 2 minutes you will wonder why you are still sitting there watching.  And it only gets worse.  My 5 year old watched for about 5 minutes, then said ""This is too weird, Mom"" and left the room.  Not being as smart as a five year old, I sat and watched about 20 more minutes of the moronic ""skits"" before turning it off.  So, consider yourself warned - save your money for something else!",1128211200,4,828,4.208860759493671
