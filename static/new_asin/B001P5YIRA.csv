3739262,1,B001P5YIRA,I received an empty DVD box. Returned it and got another empty DVD box. Returned that one and got a third empty DVD box. Have you no quality control?,1405641600,,149,4.172413793103448
3739263,2,B001P5YIRA,"Do you know how to mamba, do the rocking horse, or the grapevine? She goes right into the warm up and does not demonstrate any of the steps, just expects you to be able to follow along. The pace is too fast for me though I know I am a babe in the world of exercise, you might be able to keep up.  If I learn the steps, this would be a fun video to exercise by.",1361145600,,360,3.675324675324675
3739264,2,B001P5YIRA,"I Got this to add to my workout DVD's I have a few Nonbeginners dance and they are much easyer to do that this. In my opinion It's 90's ish you just jump into it she does explain easy moves but things like the ""rocking horse"" she needs to go into more detail or your just going to hurt your self. Also one of the girls doing it with Pam Cosmi is in jeans and not the workout fake kind they are just jeans  they look like Glow jeans from Sears (and all my life Ive been told to never go to dance class or do a work out in restrictive clothing)  and she does more than half the moves wrong. I'll keep trying but I don't think I'll ever like it ....",1267660800,5,646,3.8496240601503757
3739265,5,B001P5YIRA,"Like this.  Not too hard at all but you can increase level of intensity if you want.  If you are looking for real beginners stuff you'll like this. Not scary, just fun.",1245628800,6,168,4.21875
3739266,5,B001P5YIRA,"This video has 9 different dance styles so you don't get bored.  I really like the bhangra(sp?), Indian-style dance!  Each segment ends with a strength segment using handled tubes, but you could use dumbbells if you have them instead.  Not too hard, but will get you sweating if you complete the workout!  If you are just getting back into fitness, or looking for something fun and not too difficult, give it a try!",1244073600,7,415,4.6438356164383565
8332187,5,B001P5YIRA,The moves keep me interested and my body keeps moving. Love it that the strength training is also integrated into the program and not hard for a beginner.,1517529600,,154,4.535714285714286
8332188,2,B001P5YIRA,"This is not for beginners.  The steps are hard and there's almost no instruction, nor slowed pace while the person is still learning.  Also, it's a dance video, but you have to have resistance tubes, which I don't have. Very disappointed.",1514678400,,238,4.780487804878049
8332189,3,B001P5YIRA,"https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00G4F01WM/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0  I worked out to this video through Amazon Prime. The content was fine and was a good workout. But the execution and technology were a miss. 1) The visual and the sound were out of sync. 2) Why didn't she wear pants that were tight around the ankle so she wouldn't keep stepping on her pant leg? Wasn't there a rehearsal? 3) My biggest pet peeve is the attempt to throw in arts-y camera angles to jazz things up. For crying out loud, this is an instructional video. I don't need an aerial view or view from behind. I don't need a head shot. I want to see her from the front in full so that I can see what her arms and feet are doing.",1508025600,,700,4.511811023622047
8332190,5,B001P5YIRA,this is my first cardio dance video and i am glad that i got it.  this will give me a reason to 'shake my groove thing' in my living room! pam gives you a number of dance intervals to choose from.,1505952000,,196,3.7804878048780486
8332191,2,B001P5YIRA,"I expected something more upbeat.  This is a bit too tame for me.  But, I did enjoy the stretching.",1485907200,,99,4.157894736842105
8332192,5,B001P5YIRA,very nice,1465344000,,9,4.0
8332193,2,B001P5YIRA,"The intensity level may have been for beginners, but for me the routine was difficult to follow.  In all fairness I have a hard time following any sort of choreography, but thought that since this was for absolute beginners it would have been easier to follow or broken down into steps.",1457308800,,286,4.607843137254902
8332194,1,B001P5YIRA,nope didn't like her,1448409600,,20,4.25
8332195,4,B001P5YIRA,"This is a relatively easy DVD to follow. Its not auper exciting, nor does it have a nice set but it will get the job done when I am in need of a quick workout. All of the workouts are short and all are dancey but not difficult. I tend to enjoy DVDS that have nice colorful sets. I have over 350 Fitness DVDS.",1446854400,,308,3.828125
8332196,1,B001P5YIRA,I have exercised my whole life (am 53) and injured my back. I wanted to slowly get back into fitness and love to dance. Beginner? are you kidding me they start out with a rocking horse all over the floor and it gets worse from there. I'd return it but am not sure how. I am going to stick to instructors I know. This was the worst dvd I've ever ordered.,1419638400,,353,3.9859154929577465
