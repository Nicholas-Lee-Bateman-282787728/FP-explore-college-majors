8431466,4,B004J0TW38,"Great movie, but ending left you hanging. Reminded me of ""Magnolia"", but without the Aimee Mann score.",1469664000,,102,5.0588235294117645
8431467,1,B004J0TW38,Too slow,1458259200,,8,3.5
8431468,1,B004J0TW38,"This is a sordid mess for sure, blending four tawdry stories of bad behavior.  Some of the characters and some of the acting are so over-the-top that it is cringe-worthy.  It seems that sex is at the heart of most everyone's problems, with no one being able to curb their carnal urges. We are led to believe that it is rampant prosperity that has caused everyone to lose their moral grounding.  A sad picture of humanity.",1453680000,,421,4.5131578947368425

8431470,1,B004J0TW38,I wish I would have avoided it -awards for which part - for what?  No reality or realism I would ever want to know about,1449619200,,120,3.8

8431472,5,B004J0TW38,"If you think you can withstand four very dark stories entwined together, where the only catharsis (yes, I am purposely borrowing from the language  used to describe tragedy) the protagonists (and we) may experience, is that of better knowledge of the true nature of the mess we are in - then you are very likely to enjoy  the excellent ensemble acing, the tight weaving of the plot and that sharp rare sense of seeing and touching raw unfiltered reality in a way that most people prefer to avoid most of the time.",1449446400,2,513,4.565217391304348
8431473,2,B004J0TW38,started off ok then quickly lost me,1446336000,,35,4.142857142857143
8431474,5,B004J0TW38,"We got to watch this film while visiting Dublin last year and I can't wait to see it again on DVD. Great acting and an unfortunate, but very believable story. I can see why it was awarded several honors in Ireland; may it receive a few in the U.S., too!",1298246400,2,253,4.08
