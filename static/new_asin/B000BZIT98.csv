8094864,3,B000BZIT98,"This, unfortunately, is the least interesting account of a composer in the otherwise great series by Kultur-BBC. Unlike the other items in the series, there are no interviews, discussions with contemporary musicians, musicologists, or conductors. The DVD is more like an entry in an encyclopedia, read by a narrator. There are some photographs but no live discussions. This is unfair to one of the greatest composers ever lived.

I am sure the producers can do a better job introducing that brilliant composer, and they should do justice to him and his lovers because their other productions have so far being very successful. Also, there was an error in Brhms's date of birth that needs correction.",1268006400,7,699,5.078260869565217
