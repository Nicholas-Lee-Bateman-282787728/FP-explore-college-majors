4888130,5,B005T5OCQE,First viewed a portion of this documentary on PBS.  Ordered the DVD so I could see the rest of it.  Extremely fast shipping; It arrived within 3 days.,1343347200,,150,4.321428571428571
4888131,5,B005T5OCQE,"Countless books, films, and television programs have described the genocide perpetrated by the Nazis during the Second World War, when millions of men, women, and children were shot, hanged, buried alive, burned to death, starved, experimented upon, and gassed throughout Europe.  We have all seen horrifying footage of emaciated and disease-ridden victims and photographs of smug German soldiers who took part in the Final Solution.  In addition, a great deal has been written about what happened to the Nazis after the war.  Did they pay for their transgressions?

Although approximately one thousand Nazi officials were convicted of crimes against humanity during the Nuremberg Trials, hundreds of thousands of perpetrators escaped and went on to live normal lives.  They held jobs, ran businesses, raised families, and in some cases, lived to a ripe old age.  Some are still alive today.  ""Elusive Justice"" is an eye-opening documentary, written and directed by Jonathan Silvers and expertly narrated by Candice Bergen.  Silvers shot footage in eight countries over three years, in which he exposes the shameful truth about the reluctance of the Allies to capture and punish those who committed crimes against humanity.

How can this be?  We learn from commentary by historians, Holocaust survivors, attorneys, politicians, and military officials that:  1)  The Allies were more interested in fighting communists than they were in prosecuting Nazis, some of whom had scientific knowledge that Americans needed. 2) Members of the clergy helped Nazis escape to South America with forged American Red Cross passports. 3)  The Argentinean government provided a safe haven to Nazis, who gladly taught the dictators brutal techniques of imprisonment and torture. 4) Some governments preferred to forget about the atrocities, believing that it was too expensive, time consuming, and arduous to locate and prosecute so many fugitives.

Silvers focuses on little known individuals who, in desperation, became Nazi hunters.  Asher Ben-Natan, the first Israeli ambassador to Germany, funded a covert operation to identify and apprehend Nazi war criminals.  On the strength of a tip, Silvers tracks down Dr. Heinrich Gross, who presided over the Spiegelgrund clinic in Vienna, where the brains of disabled children had been stored in the basement for decades.  Serge and Beate Klarsfeld exposed Kurt Lischka, a former SS Colonel and Gestapo chief who became a judge in his hometown of Cologne after the war.  Vladas Zajanckauskas, originally from Lithuania, is the oldest person awaiting deportation by the U. S. Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations.  When interviewed, Zajanckauskas protested that he has been stripped of his U. S. citizenship; he wants to die in America and be buried with members of his family.  He will probably get his wish.

Why bother pursuing these elderly individuals after so much time has passed?  As Silvers eloquently states, ""The enemies of humanity must be punished--if humanity itself is to survive."" He adds, however, ""How can we ever have justice for crimes on such a scale?"" ""Elusive Justice"" contains hard-hitting archival footage, heartrending testimony from survivors, and thought-provoking facts about how little has been done to punish those who cold-bloodedly carried out such appalling acts of brutality on so many defenseless people.",1322956800,34,3386,5.471153846153846
4888132,3,B005T5OCQE,This story left me hanging. I mean it documents the seeking of nazi war criminals but while interesting it never grabbed me. Still it is interesting to watch given that the history of this is fast fading.,1466208000,,204,4.54054054054054
4888133,5,B005T5OCQE,"An excellent look at the dilemma of placing expediency over principle.  America has literally scoured post-war Europe for anti-communist experts, many of whom turned out to be war criminals.  The CIA provided cover and in some cases even falsified documentation of the former Nazis in order to maintain superiority over the Soviet Union.  The consequence was a discord and divergence of mission between the intelligence agencies, the State Department, and Justice, all working to the detriment of the national fabric. We are still paying the price today.",1466121600,2,554,5.344827586206897

4888141,4,B005T5OCQE,The story never gets old... The guilty will always have folks looking for them.  Good refresher on a dark part of world history. I would recommend to history classes that seem to think the war ended in Europe with the surrender of the third Reich.  It did not really end till years later.,1463184000,,288,4.415094339622642
4888142,5,B005T5OCQE,Great investigation work. Real eye opener to know that there are so many criminals lose with the help of so many (good people) like the Vatican????,1462406400,,147,4.6923076923076925

4888145,5,B005T5OCQE,"It does not surprise me that the Vatican aided the escape of Nazis out of Europe after the War. My father ( long gone now) who was part of the American Forces who entered Rome after the Nazi defeat, spoke of documentation that the Americans recovered of Vatican complicity with the Germans during the War.

4888156,4,B005T5OCQE,"The implications raised by this account of how the world managed the Nazi question after WWII are chilling. 21st century political and cultural events in Germany and France are clearer after viewing as is much about the good ole USA. Everyone should see this film, narrated nearly perfectly by Candice Bergen, about the Nazis, their genocide of Jews and how they (the Nazi's)  became our next door neighbors not inmates of the prison or visitors to the gallows down the road. I'd have given it 5 stars if there was more explanation for the materials presented - why? - kept coming to mind. Perhaps there is no answer.",1434412800,,617,4.712962962962963
4888157,3,B005T5OCQE,"Many of the stories are powerful in this documentary, but the narratives are not linked in a compelling way and the film making is less than the subject matter deserves.  How much better this could have been!",1434240000,,208,4.621621621621622

4888161,5,B005T5OCQE,"Excellent quick look at the disappointing lack of consequences for those who perpetrated the mass murders on the part of the Nazi regime. The record of the governments after the war in regards to living up to the promises of the allies to bring to justice those who were responsible for atrocities after WW2 was a sad, pathetic story of political expediency winning over justice. This movie gives a sense of that though it really only scratches the surface.",1433030400,2,457,4.7974683544303796
4888162,5,B005T5OCQE,"Very informative--and disturbing.  This documentary is thorough, well paced--and worth every minute of viewing.  Do not hesitate to watch it.",1431648000,,141,6.0

4888165,5,B005T5OCQE,Excellent photography from archives. I remember this history but found how so many criminals were helped to escape justice was enlightening. Humanity must not repeat such crimes.,1428019200,,178,5.62962962962963

4888168,5,B005T5OCQE,Left me thinking....War does displace law.  It depends on the winning side and their interests what laws will be enforced and when. Genocide has been happening in other countrys since WW2. Curious where is the outrage for these people?,1425513600,,235,5.0256410256410255
4888169,5,B005T5OCQE,"What a fascinating look at a subject that has been examined what I thought as thoroughly until I watched this show. There are so many contradictions pointed out by the filmmakers that one cannot help but be stunned by what is shown.
While I can't really say much more that hasn't been said already by reviewers, I do have a question that maybe others can help with.
I noted that the music was written by Robert Y. Lee. Does anybody know anything about him? Very little is on IMDB. And, a search on that name is, as you can imagine, brings up a whole lot of information about some other ""Robert Lee.""  (grin)

4888175,4,B005T5OCQE,"Excellent film. Have done a great deal of research (amateur) into the subject. Many of these WW11 Nazi films have splices seen in other films. I have always been interested in seeing Nazi criminals brought to justice. It just pains me that they are all dead and dying because it has taken so long and many countries, including the USA, have been extremely reluctant and secretive about it.",1417651200,,389,4.735294117647059

4888180,5,B005T5OCQE,"This documentary is exceptionally well written and filmed. As an American its hard to believe we allowed Nazi war criminals to live and work among us.

4888188,5,B005T5OCQE,Very informative and enlightening. It is understandable why the Jewish people want to do everything within their power to be and stay free. We should never forget this atrocity and make sure subsequent generations do not forget as well.,1405209600,,236,5.076923076923077
4888189,5,B005T5OCQE,"Very informative documentary and I recognized Candace Bergen's voice immediately which, in my opinion, was an excellent choice. This subject has been of interest to me since a child as both paternal and maternal sides of the family are German.  I liked finding out the fact that some justice was served albeit a very minute portion of perpetrators were punished.
I have found copious amounts of good things through Amazon resources and along this same subject ie: WWII,  a book about Bonhoeffer .... Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy  Author:Eric Metaxas was an inspiring saga about one man's struggle against Hitler.
AMAZON is Amazing!!

4888190,5,B005T5OCQE,"I've seen films on the subject before but this really brings home how so many countries including the United States and even the Vatican helped hide Nazi Criminals all over the world.  Justice was never really achieved since so many Nazi's lived full lives after murdering so many Innocent men, women and children.",1402531200,,314,4.9245283018867925
4888191,5,B005T5OCQE,"Very interesting (e.g. I didn't know the Vatican had such a hand in helping N.W.C's disapear), very well done, and very fustrating.  Well worth your time.  I'll probably end up reading Uki Goni's book that was mentioned in this documentary.",1402185600,,240,4.975
4888192,4,B005T5OCQE,"Clarification: When I have to choose which star for this documentary, I don't mean I like what the documentary shows. I've often wondered what happened to all the accomplices in the atrocities of WWII.  This documentary gives the terrible answer.  It has been said that for evil to succeed, good people do nothing.  I don't call them ""good"", however.  They are just as guilty as the perpetrators.  A person must stand up for justice at all times!  At any price!  Or s/he will be next.

I'm a disabled senior, for instance.  And a veteran of the U.S. Army Nurse Corps.  I'm being threatened with death and the taking of my house simply because (according to court papers), my dog plays in my back yard two hours a day!  And this is the United States that guarantees, ""Equal protection under the Law?""  Where is MY protection?!",1401580800,,825,4.613793103448276
4888193,5,B005T5OCQE,"Amazing documentary. And very well done.

Also, old nazis are the worst liars of all time. You can see it in their face, eyes, and voice dramatically.

It's sad that all of them continue to lie to themselves. I hope that they saw their victims faces every day of their lives.",1400716800,,275,4.372549019607843
4888194,5,B005T5OCQE,"My father told me a very long time ago (he was way up in something) that Amerika was harboring many Nazis after the War.  And, further someday we would pay a huge price for it!  Now look at the extreme right wing Republicans and everything he said has come true plus some!  I personally met three men in the 60's who admitted they had served either in the Kreigsmarine U Boats, The Afrika Corps and the SS.  The SS said he escaped West from Russia by running, ducking, and hiding at night!  Crossed several Rivers with another fellow, they exchanged uniforms and papers with regular Wehrmacht non-coms or Officers and surrendered to the Allies.  Eventually, because their homes were in East Germany they were allowed to stay in the West, since the Russians had seized a huge territory and emigrated to the US because they had skills that Industry wanted.  He was a tool and die maker at GM.  I believed him for several reasons and why he opened up to me I will never know, but he did!",1398729600,2,984,4.4581005586592175

4888199,5,B005T5OCQE,"I learned much from this documentary and I am quite saddened and extremely disgusted by the lack of effort given to punishing these murderers. Justice in the way of death should have been given when the invading forces captured the camps. I find it amazing that their families have supported them through the years and defend them to this day. So most of these murderers have lived long, happy, and fruitful lives and from the appearances have had no remorse or guilt of conscience what so ever.

4888206,4,B005T5OCQE,The movie squarely places blame on the Allies for allowing thousands of Nazis and war criminals to escape punishment. The Cold War after WWII affected the level of attention paid towards these escapees as a new enemy (Communism) surfaced. Also complicity of the Vatican is mentioned. Only a small group of people (the Jews) was active in pursuing and punishing these despicable individuals. This is a well documented report!,1391040000,,424,5.159420289855072

4888208,5,B005T5OCQE,"This is a poignant illustration of a few things: 1) ""Decent, civil, and just cultures and societies"" don't care about atrocities let alone pursuing the mass murderers, 2) Americans are the biggest hypocrites on the globe with more that 10,000 Nazis living in the USA. The Germans and Roman Catholic Church are two other despicable Nazi aiders and abettors, 3) vengeance IS good and doesn't make a single extrajudicial killing of these Nazis objectionable, 4) they got away with 95% of it and will never be caught. One notable scene was the man who found Cukols and extracted what can only be described as real justice, and 5) creates a new definition of heroes although the ideals of law also protected many of these truly, monstrous, evil men. Not for the feint-hearted - includes real film archive footage of graphic horror.",1389830400,,826,4.865248226950355
4888209,5,B005T5OCQE,"The hunt for the Nazi monsters is coming to an end.  This documentary detailed how it happened, why and the pain it caused survivors.  History seems to repeat itself and hopefully this film will be seen by people and keep alive the strength, will to live and fight for what is right.  It does not matter the age of someone, justice must be held up and people made accountable.  Very bittersweet this film.  Well done.",1389744000,,417,4.506666666666667
4888210,5,B005T5OCQE,"This presentation is more than difficult to review . . . it is a commentary on the justice system. What is the difference between justice and revenge? Are those accused beyond the legal system? What was the ethic of Nazi Germany? Questions answered and answers that seem to belie recognition of guilt. WWII and all that happened is now relegated to history. There were atrocities committed by so many that it defies description. Genocide remains as a part of life and of death. Listen to the victims and the perpetrators and try to understand their sentiments. Well worth the time and just perhaps a way of understanding. War remains a focal point . . . once a normal individual takes a human life, there will be consequences.  There is no simple answer. This chapter in history must not be forgotten . . . the time to intervene is before genocide becomes too ruthless to control. Think Khmer Rouge and Cambodia 1978, Rwanda 1994,  Bosnian 1992 - 1995, and Darfur 2003 ethnic cleansing of non-Arabs in Sudan . . . these are more recent examples. Admittedly, none on a scale as massive as Nazi Germany. Perhaps we take more notice of events.

Recommended for those interested in military history, criminal justice, genocide, and this timeline.

So in closing I will just say this; don't watch this because it's the right thing to do, but rather because I demand it.  Have I made myself clear?",1517270400,,310,4.368421052631579

As I learn more history and the atrocities Germany and Japan committed I am appalled, it brings tears that people are so cruel to others and willingly do these horrible things. Then to allow these criminals to go without trial or punishment is another crime. I will pray our governments never allow such things to happen again. This was a wonderful and informative program. Thank you to the producers.",1515369600,4,480,4.593023255813954
