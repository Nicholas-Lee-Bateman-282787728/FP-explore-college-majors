1393395,5,B000055WJ9,"Finally! I'm one of those moonies that loves the ORIGINAL and when I heard they'd release the third seaon:the Best season by far in my opinion: subtitled and UNCUT I was in heaven. if you really love SM you must buy this video and the rest when they're released. But a warning to parents: I'm 16 and by my parents am old enough for this. If you have young SM lovers, consider the dubbed. The original is uncut and has references to homosexuals and a *tiny* touch of nudity. Not any thing to go nuts over but it might not be for young viewers. And they have both versions this time, one for young viewers and one for older viewers. So neither one is left out! Buy it!",977961600,,666,4.2109375
1393396,5,B000055WJ9,"I have all 200 episodes of Sailor Moon and this season, The Sailor Moon S is the best season out off all of the episodes that I have seen.  This series is based on Sailor Saturn and the outer Sailor's scout, Sailor Pluto, Uranus and Neptune, and Renie Sailor MiniMoon joins into the battke to save the world from a mysterious New Enemy, The Tau Ceti.  Got to watch this whole series people it is great",976838400,7,401,4.2631578947368425
1393397,5,B000055WJ9,"I have been watching Bishoujo Senshi Sailormoon for about 5 years now.  As most other fans, I find the third season, known as ""S"" or ""Super"" to be the best one.  Why you ask?  Because it has more plot twists, more character development, more interesting villains and of course, it introduces three of the best Sailor Soldiers, Neptune, Uranus and the illusive Saturn.  This tape contains the first few episodes of the third season.  Right at the beginning, this season starts with a bang.  The five Sailor Soldiers we all are accustomed to, meet up with new deadly villains calling themselves Deathbusters, who are after 3 talismans, each found inside the pure hearts of three selected human beings.  They also get introduced to two new mysterious soldiers.  I found this season to be the most emotional of them all, combining both histerical comedy and heart-clenching drama.  I recommend buying the subtitled version to any moonie out there.  I realize the dub version is also being released, but in my opinion, it is god-awful compared to the original.  Do yourself a favour, buy the subtitled edition, you won't regret it and you might even find yourself learning a cool new language.  Not to mention that you'll be watching the real story with no cuts or extra dialogue.",975801600,9,1275,4.851851851851852
1393432,5,B000055WJ9,"This video has a big change! It's so much better than Sailor Moon R. I think this is a great video. My favorite rpisode is the second one. Here is a description about the four episodes:
 Premonition of World's End? Mysterious New Warriors-Rei(Raye) has a dream about the Apocolypse and when Sailor Moon battles, two new Sailors Appear!

The Rod of Love is Born! Usagi's New Transformation-Serena and Darien believe in the power of love and than a new brooch is formed and the Spiral Heart moon scepter.

A Beautiful Boy?-Serena saw Mina at the Crown Arcade and Mina falls in love with Haruka(Amara) Tenoh. They spy on Haruka and she catches them. Than, they finally meet the two Cloaked Sailors.

Usagi's Idol!-Usagi(Serena) meets Michiru(Michelle) Kaioh and notices she plays the violin and paints. Than, Michiru gives Serena tickets to go to a Concert on music.

In this season, the enemy steals pure hearts in hopes of finding the ones that'll lead them to world victory.

1393435,5,B000055WJ9,"This is the first Sailer Moon video I've ever been able to buy!! You see I live in England, and Sailer moon has only just started showing on Fox Kids last year. Only problem is its a continuos re-run of the first series, Black moon series, and the Doom Tree series!! AAAHHHHHHH!! I knew there were other Series that have been on TV in America (which is sooo unfair!!) and my only way was to import them over using Amazon.com (to which I am VERY greatful!!) I am NOT disappointed, and have since purchased the next 4 volumes of Sailer Moon S, and am now saving up to buy the rest!!!! Granted the new Serena voice was a little annoying but you get use to it, and I love Rini's new voice! Much better than her original voice! I chose to get the unedited version because you get to view it much more like the way it was originally made in Japan, although it's still not the same because Sailer Neptune and Uranus are supposed to be lovers, not cousins as they appear in the American versions. I just hope they will bring out the Sailer Moon Super S, and Stars series, as we shouldnt be deprived of the whole story!!! SO TAKE NOTE ANIME VIDEO PRODUCTION COMPANIES!! WE WANT ALL THE SERIES!! Or Sailer fans everywhere will punish you!",997747200,,1228,4.343478260869565

1393437,5,B000055WJ9,"I purchased the uncut subtitled version of this video because I was tired of the butchered American version.  I simply dispise the American voice actors, and I espescially hate what they've done to ""Amarah"" and ""Michelle"".  I finally got to hear the wonderful voices of Katsuki Masako(Michiru) and Ogata Megumi(Haruka).  It's really amazing how much better the show can be if you have really good VAs.  Also, I saw how Naoko Takeuchi intended the series to be, not what parts CWI decided not to cut out.  This movie is the first three episodes in the S series:
1. A Premonition World Destruction? The Mysterious New Soldiers Appear 2. The Birth of a Rod of Love!  Usagi's New Transformation 3.  A Pretty Boy? Tenoh Haruka's Secret  <<<< (Very funny!)
All three are very good.  The first 2 outer-senshi, Uranus and Neptune are introduced, as well as the new villian, Professor Tomoe and the Death Busters.  If you don't mind reading the bottom of the screen, and you want to see Sailor Moon in all of its Japanese glory, I highly suggest buying the next three movies: The Love War, Labyrinth, and Birthday Blues(all uncut/subbed of course!)",987897600,2,1139,4.794871794871795
1393468,5,B000055WJ9,"Since Cartoon Network stopped airing Sailor Moon on May 3rd, this is the only current way to watch Sailor Moon S until they decide to bring it back! Also, if these video's sell well, Sailor Stars, the last current season of Sailor Moon, could come to America. But only if these sell well, because the Japanese company that owns the rights are selling it at a cost too high for it not to sell in America.
This video contains the 1st 4 episodes of Sailor Moon S. They each keep their original name and are uncut! The episodes are as follows:
1. ""Premonition of World's End? Mysterious New Warriors!"" (""Star Struck, Bad Luck"" in America) in wich Rei has a vision of the world becomeing silenced. We are introduced to Doctor Tomoe and his assistant, Kaorinite and learn that they are after 3 special heart crystals that will destroy Earth. They send a Diamohn (a demon) to steal Ray's pure heart crystal. When the scouts can't defeat it and all hope seems lost, two mysterious girls dressed as sailor soldiers appear and defeat the diamohn. But are they friend or foe?
2. ""The Rod of Love is Born! Usagi's New Transformation"" (""Crystal Clear Again"" in America) in wich Darien takes Serena to an abandoned house where stray kittens live. They meet a young girl whos trying to find homes for the kittens. When the little girls puzzle turns into a diamohn, the scouts come to the rescue. But they can't defeat it. The new scouts, Sailor Uranus and Neptune, appear , and they appear to be searching for pure heart crystals like Professor Tomoe. Sailor Moon gets a new power from her love for Darian. She is now able to defeat the diamohn.
3. ""A Beautiful Boy? The Secret of Haruka Tenoh"" (""Driving Dangerousley"" in America) in wich Serena and Mina meet a boy at the arcade. They stalk him all day when they become suspicious that he might have a girlfriend. But when a diamohn comes after his mechanic friend, the scouts are forced into action. Uranus and Neptune come, but the heart crystal is not the one they were looking for and are able to give it back. Usagi and Mina learns that the boy is a girl named Amara.
4. ""Usagis Idol! The Graceful Genious Micharu"" (""Bad Harmony"" in America) in wich Serena feels that Darian will fall out of love with her if she dosen't mature to his colledge level soon. She meets Amara's friend, Michell who can play the violin. She gives Usagi tickets to a violin concert so she takes Darian. The violin turns into a daimohn and is after the players pure heart. They defeat it, but will Uranus and Neptune be able to give it back?
To find out the conclusion to this, buy ""Sailor Moon S: The Love War"". This video is great! And it will help bring Sailor Stars to America!",987465600,11,2698,4.4969450101833

1393470,5,B000055WJ9,"This tape dives once again into the pre-teen world of Sailor Moon.  The pure hearts series is important, dealing with the entrance of the ""outer senshi"" or scouts, Uranus, Neptune and if you continue the series, Pluto, Rini, and the rarely seen Saturn.  The plot is exciting, and full of unexpected twists and turns.  The animation is better in this set, compared to the earlier episodes.  Serena's voice is a little much, but, hey, if you know the show, its completely normal! :o)  If you love sailor moon, you'll love this, and its follow-up tape The Love War.

I can't wait to get to see Haruka and Michiru as a couple instead of annoying cousins with incest heavily implied. Sailor Moon is not a kid's show, so I don't see why you'd buy *ANY* version of it for a child . . . there's no reason to pay for the dubbed when you can support the original! If you can't deal with a much more enjoyable storyline, better dialogue, and homosexuality (what's wrong with love, anyway?!), then I don't see why you can call yourself a fan. Buy the subbed.

7930920,2,B000055WJ9,"Upon the end of Sailor Moon R somewhere back in 99' I was left with a gaping sense of emptiness after the finale (which I can't remember very well since it was a very long time ago). I was avid fan of Sailor Moon; the so-called Female ""Power Rangers"" show for girls, I loved everything about it. I didn't return to watching Toonami until March sixth which was the arrival of Gundam Wing) and afterward a new season of DBZ starting off with the Trunks saga. So you can I was surprised to find that Sailor Moon had returned with a new season as well. After they had taken her off the air completely I wasn't broken up too much about it. I had the TV-shows for boys (DBZ and GW, Superman, and Batman/Batman beyond, among other things) to watch and keep me happy.

On Christmas I received Sailor Moon S - Pure Hearts (Vol. 1, TV Version). I was excited to watch it again. But when I popped it into the VCR the glimmer of excitement and respect had fallen completely from me; they changed everything I had came to expected from this Shuojo-anime. Maybe the purists who don't mind editing were jumping in their seats upon hearing the original soundtrack from the Sailor Moon Uncut version, but I was pissed. They changed most of the voice actors for every character I either liked or thought was okay [AKA; Mina, Amy, Rini, Sailor Pluto, Serena, and Andrew] with second rate actors who try their best to mimic their past voice actors but fail miserably in every aspect.

Episodes about Serena and Rini aren't as interesting as they were in Sailor Moon/R; they have a little girl encouraging grown adults to never give up on love because if they do they might regret it for the rest of their lives (as if she knew anything about it being a C-H-I-L-D and all), Serena basically broods about everything concerning saving the world, blaming herself, jumping all over Darien, being the klutz she is and saving the day at the end of every episode. There is no longer an aspect of character development in this series. Episodes that are basically about everyone else are still as boring as ever because they're still the backup troopts and never destroy the monsters that attack people they know. When an enemy challenges Sailor Mars - Jupiter - Venus - and Mercury, they just weaken it and Sailor Moon does the rest of the killing, there basically is no new aspect to the four secondary characters powers or strengths.

The plot for Sailor Moon S isn't as gripping as the others although it is change from the regular Steal energy or crystals. This time the enemy wants pure hearts of a particular kind in order to achieve world domination and reawaken a long lost leader of theirs that lies dormant in the body of a small child named Hotaru, so they target everyone they possibly can, mostly people who are close to the sailor scouts until they discover that the pure-hearts they're searching for lay within two new Sailor scouts; Neptune and Uranus. Whom are lesbians in the uncut version *frowns* but cousins in the edited version, thankfully, but are unaware of the third holder of the crystal is Sailor Pluto --- Trista.

When these three items are combined they give Sailor Moon a new method of transforming along with new powers. But this new item drains Sailor Moon's energy everytime she uses it. Eventually the bad guys decide to rear their ugly heads and Kidnap Rini. The sailor Scouts head off to rescue the young girl but find themselves coming one-second too late for Rini's the holder of the purest heart (as well as, the pure-sweet energy, white mirror dream of Pegasus and so on). It is given to Hotaru's evil and it reawakens her split personality Mistress Nine: the sailor scouts try to stop her evil but are overpowered (Sailor Pluto is believed to be killed), Sailor Moon is the only one able to get inside the protective dome Mistress Nine has created around her fortress, Sailor Uranus and Neptune try with all their might to kill Mistress nine but find themselves constantly stopped but an ignorant Sailor Moon who practically helps Mistress nine destroy the world by giving her the sailor chalice in a vain attempt to save Hotaru.

When Mistress Nine gives the sailor Chalice to her master Pharaoh 90 she is supposedly doubled crossed the moment after thus creating a rifft between her control over the young Hotaru's spirit and body. Hotaru's positive side reawakens and destroys Mistress nine and is reborn as Sailor Saturn; the sailor scout of destruction. Without a second thought Sailor Saturn leaps into the heart of Pharaoh 90 and destroys him knowing that she will die as well but the sailor scouts (like always) surrender their powers to Sailor Moon who transforms without the sailor chalice and enters Pharaoh 90 as he is destroyed saving a reborn baby Hotaru's life. After that Sailor Uranus and Netpune object to Sailor Moon being their princess because they think of her as weak (and in so many ways, Sailor Moon is the weakest out of all the characters) but end up being beaten by Sailor Moon's bright-light from her broach (what a sucky way to be beated) and return to whever they came from.

All in all its a basic romp of Mix-pause-and-repeat. Maybe I've lost interest in Sailor Moon, but I do know one thing. the first season and other seasons before S -Super-S-and Stars were far better than this. [a 2 out of 5]",1115942400,5,5344,4.6378035902851105
7930921,4,B000055WJ9,"This is the edited first volume of the third season, S. This season was dubbed by a different company, so many of the voices from the first two seasons have been replaced. Serena's new voice is the only one that is tough to deal with. The actress tries too hard to imitate the previous voice, but she does improve a great deal as the episodes go on. Luckily, Lita & Raye's voice actors return, making the transition easier. Many people will complain about the edited version, but aside from one or two examples, you're not really missing anything.

Episode 83: Star Struck, Bad Luck - 1st Dr. Tomo, Kaori. Raye has a dark vision that troubles her. She's worried about a new enemy appearing. Sure enough, a crazed scientist is searching for special pure hearts that will unleash the Purity Chalice. Raye is attacked for her pure heart & when the scouts rush to her aid, Serena's transformation locket is broken. Also, two warriors in the shadows appear, also hunting for the pure hearts.

Episode 84: Crystal Clear Again - Serena is depressed about not being able to transform into Sailor Moon. Darien takes her to an abandoned house where a bunch of kittens live. A little girl takes care of the cats, making her a pure heart target. When a new monster appears, Serena and Darien's love produces the Spiral Moon Rod allowing Sailor Moon to return. Again, the two new warriors strike from the shadows.

Episode 85: Driving Dangerously - 1st Appearance of Amara/Sailor Uranus, Michelle/Sailor Neptune. Mina and Serena ditch studying to play at the arcade and meet Amara, whom they mistake for a boy. While chasing Amara and the beautiful Michelle around town, the Heart Snatchers strike again. This time, the new warriors emerge from the shadows. Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune work alone and have no interest in helping the other scouts protect the heart bearers.

Episode 86: Bad Harmony - Serena is tired of her childish clutziness and wants to better herself for Darien. She stumbles upon Michelle playing the violen and decides to try learning about classical music. When she and Darien head to a concert, the heart snatchers strike & the Sailor Scouts leap into action.

This is the beginning of my favorite season and if you can afford the DVDs, go for it. Otherwise, pick these up cheap and enjoy the story. And, yes, if you are a cliche anime fan obsessed with ""uncut"" and japanese voices only, feel free to skip these.",1104624000,3,2428,4.7440758293838865
