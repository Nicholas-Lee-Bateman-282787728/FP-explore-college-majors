8099163,3,B000CKJ2KM,"This bizarre little slice of Korean anime finds a pair of young pilots travelling to Earth in search of the mythical ""Pheonix King"" mecha after their world has been decimated by the forces of the evil Emporer Nick (""Hi, Emporer Nick!"" ""Hi, Everybody!""). They do indeed find the Pheonix King and he is revealed to be a super-size version of the G1 Transformers character Inferno. They board the Pheonix King and return to defeat the forces of Nick. And, as luck would have it, Pheonix King can also transform into a 20th Century fire engine and tend to the blaze left in the aftermath of the battle. This is one surreal movie, and I'm glad Digiview has given us an extremely economical opportunity to view it. By late 70's early 80's anime standards it's okay. The real value, however,  lies in the curiosity factor that it will hold for anime and Transformers fans. Also check out ""Raiders of Galaxy"" (yes, I typed that right), which stars the ""Super Mazinger III"" that I'm fairly sure was not authorized by the creators of the original ""Mazinger Z"" series. Digiview has given us a peek into the weird world of Korean anime, for a low, low, price. I thank them,",1150848000,4,1161,4.608695652173913
