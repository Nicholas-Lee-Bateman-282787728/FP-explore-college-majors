5391273,3,B00A705GOI,"I don't really know what to say about this movie. It was kind of twisted, but it did make me think about how keeping secrets, especially in a marriage, can tear family and friends apart.",1381795200,,186,4.3428571428571425
5391274,5,B00A705GOI,"I enjoyed it, and I'm a bit confused about the ending. Was one of the friends (the one got killed) a fiction of imagination by Choi? When Choi attempted to file a missing person report, he initially gave his own name. Then he provided his ""friend""'s name, only to discover that it was not a common name and the person couldn't be found... But it obviously is not consistent with the rest of the plot. If anyone knows please let me know.",1475366400,,436,4.329268292682927
5391275,4,B00A705GOI,"Don't let the 'Pulp Fiction' esqe advertisement mislead you...this is a fairly thoughtful modern day tale with a few very tender moments, some very gut wrenching ones, as well as a splash of humor throughout.",1475020800,,208,4.9714285714285715

5391287,1,B00A705GOI,"A boring, dull, mundane movie. Such a shame. Even the sex scenes were snooze-worthy. I'd rather watch skyfall. That's how horrible this movie is.",1465344000,,145,5.083333333333333

5391295,5,B00A705GOI,"I really enjoyed this film...a little confusing at times, but it was fast paced and entertaining...Jo Dong Hyuk can work out his issues with me anytime",1444176000,,151,4.846153846153846
5391296,1,B00A705GOI,Not recommended.,1436486400,,16,7.5
5391297,4,B00A705GOI,"I really liked this movie but agree that it was a little confusing at times.  I am quite surprised that the most important character in this film was left off the list of the cast on Amazon.  Jang Hyuk is an excellent actor, and really did have the largest part in this movie.  His role was very complicated, and he played it extremely well.",1435881600,,341,4.296875
5391298,3,B00A705GOI,"I really loved this Movie, I'd watch it again although I wasn't very happy about how the movie streamed, I have the best internet and electronic devices and this movie would start and stop then freeze and I'd have to start it over again. When it did work it turned out to be a really good erotic thriller. The English subtitles were excellent.",1432944000,,343,4.4603174603174605
5391299,5,B00A705GOI,"Such a dark twisted drama but not the scary type. The English title on the cover ""Penthouse Playboys"" makes it seem like it's an Entourage-I'mtype movie but it's not. I'm Korean so I listened and read the subtitles, but the subtitles are horrible!! Didn't translate half the dialogue correctly.",1432857600,3,294,5.020408163265306
5391300,5,B00A705GOI,"It may not have the best plot in the world, but it will certainly make you thinking.",1430006400,,84,4.0
5391301,5,B00A705GOI,a schizophrenic twist....very interesting,1425340800,,41,9.5
5391302,3,B00A705GOI,"Not a bad movie, but a little weird and confusing at times. The soundtrack is a little disturbing.  This movie is for mature audiences.",1400630400,,135,4.625
5391303,5,B00A705GOI,"The theme of this movie is to decipit people who stands within high social status, and yet are lost and trying to find their way within society saturated with shallow lifestyle. Each of the three main characters are in their thirties, struggling with his own particular madness: a photographer battling manic-depression, a plastic surgeon that is a sex-addict, and a financial trader finding inappropriate true love.

Overall, the movie was interesting with the ending that stays with you and make you think about many different aspects of life. I'll rate 4.5 in Amazon but since it received 3stars so far, I rounded up.",1393545600,3,620,5.019417475728155
8547431,5,B00A705GOI,I really loved this movie.  I watched like three times on Dramafever and I just brought it.  Buy this drama you will love it.,1490659200,,125,4.166666666666667

8547434,4,B00A705GOI,"This drama was soooo intense; very sexy, and very sad. Just a train wreck of emotions. I couldnt' give it 3 because the acting was really good; but I wanted to because I didn't like the ending. It was also reallly slow at times. But still intense, sexy at times, tragedy style story telling at it's finest.",1484697600,,306,4.385964912280702
8547435,4,B00A705GOI,"Didn't care for the beginning too much but the film grew on me, although it was certainly depressing. Very inventive visually, exploring the different problems of three boyhood friends in adulthood and how they relate to the women in their lives. The film includes ... spoiler alert ... the suicide of a female character. I discovered after watching the film that the actress who portrayed her committed suicide in real life after filming wrapped but before the film's release. Apparently she left a seven page suicide note claiming she was killing herself due to repeated beatings and being forced into having sex with 31 different entertainment industry bigwigs, whom she named in the note. Shortly thereafter her manager attempted suicide. Very sad.",1484006400,2,752,5.172131147540983
