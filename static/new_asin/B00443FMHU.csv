4259473,5,B00443FMHU,"I have always been interested in the life of elephants and the terrible poaching on the herds in Africa.
Excellent photography and telling of this elephants story.",1356566400,,163,5.074074074074074
4259474,5,B00443FMHU,"this is one heck of a great tribute to a remarkable ""beast"".  if you didn't think about how to protect these magnificent creatures for a moment in your life....this will turn the page for you.  what a tremendous loss if we don't act now on preserving their habitat and teaching the ""locals"" other means of providing for their families so that the elephants can live on.",1353628800,,369,4.575757575757576
4259475,5,B00443FMHU,"A pleasure to watch such sensative photography. A story of our most gentle giants told artistically and with a heart. I never knew the strengt of the matriachial influance on the elephants, so clearly shown in this documentary.",1351728000,,227,5.0
4259476,5,B00443FMHU,"I caught this program in Februrary 2012 while flipping thru channels and fell in love with elephants.  It is truly an amazing tribute to a truly beautiful creature.  I think what caught me off guard the most, was how much the family unit means to them, how tender they are with each other, and how they look out for each other, kinda how I view my own values for family.  I was truly touched, and have watched it online until I found I could order the DVD.  I hope they continue with this as I enjoyed the sweet little Ebony and have been very concerned about Enid and how she is doing now since Echo has died.  I have joined Cynthia Moss's website and everyone asks about Enid, but I have been unable to find a answer about her.  I have watched over and over again....and cried every time!!  My kids think I'm going nuts as I now want to go to Africa to see her family in person.",1336348800,,880,4.171597633136095
4259477,5,B00443FMHU,"I fell in love with Echo and her family when I saw a show about her on Animal Planet. After I found out I couldn't purchase that particular video, I started looking for anything and everything I could find about her and I am so glad that I found this video. I watch it over and over again. My husband is so tired of watching Echo, but he does enjoy her almost as much as I do.",1325808000,9,376,3.896103896103896
4259478,5,B00443FMHU,"Through her lifetime example, Echo has been one of the greatest teachers about elephants.  If you haven't seen previous programs about her, this one will catch you up on her,her amazing story, family and legacy.  She reminds us what incredible being we travel through life with on this planet -- if only we have the wherewithal to recognize them.",1313452800,10,346,4.8474576271186445
4259479,5,B00443FMHU,"This is a brilliant film.  I cried form start to finish,  so you may need a box of tissue's on standby and within reach. Echo was a very special elephant who left a legacy. This film shows these animals are truly gentle giants.  Elephant families have a strong caring bond between them that is never forgotten.  A mother, who will not leave the side of her crippled son or a mother who comforts an injured daughter or a daughter who mourns her mother's death.  Whilst the film has amazing sunsets and beautiful photography,  the elephants live in harsh conditions and sadly their biggest enemy is man.  Man's greed for their ivory and unwillingness to share land and water. Cynthia Moss and her team from the Amboseli Elephant Trust are dedicated to saving the elephant and they share their stories of joy and heartbreak.  I have watched this film a second time, tissue box on standby, which was just at well as I cried just as much as I did the first time.  I look forward to see how the family are going in Echo: The Next Generation",1311206400,,1034,4.4866310160427805
4259480,4,B00443FMHU,"This is one of the best and one of the saddest elephant documentaries. It is about the passing of Echo and how it affected the other elephants of the herd. The program is only an hour long, but the content is so good that after watching it you feel that you have had a worthwhile experience with elephants.  The blu-ray disc shows with much clarity the majestic scenery of the national park with Mount Kilimanjaro rising in the background.  Cynthia Moss relates the stories of her long experience with elephants, and she probably knows them better than anyone else. You can sympathize with her and the others who worked with Echo when they have lost the elephant after knowing her for so many years. Elephants are sensitive, intelligent animals, much like the humans who care for them.

If you own the previous documentaries of Nature or the BBC about Echo and her elephant family you will want to add this one to your collection. Perhaps another episode featuring elephants and/or African wildlife should have been added to what is offered here, since many of the other Nature DVD's/blu-rays contain bonus programs to make them at least two hours. It's the one thing that would have made this outstanding blu-ray/DVD even better.  The program has such beautiful footage photographed with the latest technology that it makes you wish for more.",1301011200,15,1343,4.851528384279476
4259481,5,B00443FMHU,"I have closely followed Echo's story for many years now. Watching every episode that Nature, or the BBC aired. When this episode finally aired, I felt like I had lost a friend as well. The documentary is one of the most moving and fascinating ones of the animal kingdom.
""Echo: An Elephant to Remember,"" had me in tears most of the episode, but clapping at the end. For we learn just how deep elephants are. Echo taught her family well, and she will live on through them. I hope the story doesn't end, for I would love to learn more about spunky Ebony, or see how well Echo's sister does in continuing to lead the family.
It is sad to see such a magnificent creature go, but the story is one that cannot be missed. There is just too much to learn from it.
Aside from the story, the photography is amazing. I never tire of seeing these awesome creatures dominate the plains, or watch them interact with each other. This is a must have for any animal lover.",1291334400,43,955,4.340782122905028
4259492,3,B00443FMHU,"You will like or like less this video depending on what you are looking for. The documentary film follows one matriarch and her offspring. The photography is great. The story of Echo and her family are heartbreaking and inspiring. However, I wanted something about elephants in general with more scientific explanations about things like how they choose mates, how far they roam, how many are typically in a herd, how many offspring do they typically have, what are the typical characteristics of matriarchs, what does the stress response look like in elephants, how long do they grieve, how do African elephants differ from Asian ones, and so forth and so on. This is not that type of film. This film is heavy on anecdote/story and soft on study & science. If you want to be invited into the lives of one family in an intimate way then you will love it. If you want more information about elephants in general, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.",1426809600,2,942,4.75

4259495,2,B00443FMHU,they cut out a lot of it which i saw on pbs the love the photographer felt for his subjects was totally missing i was very disappointed,1421712000,2,135,4.037037037037037

4259498,5,B00443FMHU,I saw it on public television and loved it so much that I wanted to buy it to send to my grandchild who wabts to be a veterinarian,1411948800,,130,3.6785714285714284

4259501,5,B00443FMHU,Echo's story will touch your heart.  The photography is wonderful.  The stories that Cynthia Moss and her cameraman tell about each elephant are heartfelt.  I would highly recommend this DVD for the family and the classroom.,1394668800,,224,5.166666666666667
4259512,5,B00443FMHU,This movie is truly touching! It is about the complex relationships between elephants and I was pleasantly surprised. It was very well made.,1389744000,,140,5.130434782608695
4259513,5,B00443FMHU,I literally fell in love with this elephant family. Echo was a wonderful leader and mother. The way that her story was told was excellent. My hat is off to these wonderfully dedicated people  I hope there is more coming to help me keep my grandchildren interested in taking care of the animals we are so fortunate to have on earth. They were so enthralled in this story. They watch it every time they come to my house. Thanks go to all involved.,1383436800,,445,4.36144578313253
4259514,5,B00443FMHU,I am so glad to have this.  This was a remarkable Elephant.  I now want to get the first DVD about her travels.  So sad her life had to come to and end.,1370217600,3,152,3.5454545454545454
4259515,5,B00443FMHU,"A fascinating tale of the most amazing creature I have ever known.  She has an intelligence far beyond that which we have, and courage to preserve her herd under any circumstances.  I wept when she died.",1365120000,,203,4.611111111111111
4259516,5,B00443FMHU,"This documentary about a loving, intelligent female elephant who tends her family until her death, reaches the depths of the human soul beyond all thought.  I have always loved elephants, so this DVD brings to my heart the added love of another creature so very close to some humans who adore their children and family.  It is a bittersweet, yet precious true story of Echo.  She will live forever.",1364688000,6,398,4.739130434782608
4259517,5,B00443FMHU,"Echo is an elephant matriarch who was studied by Cynthia Moss for over 28 years. Echo led her family through many droughts, and through many tough times. Her family was close-nit, and they depended on each other for survival. I have followed the story of Echo the elephant, ever since she has been followed in the 1990's. I remember the documentary they had following the birth of her son Eli. Her son was crippled for the first 3 days of his life. He walked around on his knees until they turned raw, because he could not stand up straight like the other normal baby elephants.

Even though his strength was fading, one day he finally gathered up the strength to stand up straight. Eli finally got his first chance to nurse from his mother. After he got his first meal, his strength improved and he became stronger every day thereafter. Echo went on to have other babies after that, and the documentaries about her slowed down. Echo's daughter's remained with her over the years, and they also helped her look out for the young elephant calves.

This movie is more about the final demise of Echo, It is very interesting, and I enjoyed it so much. Echo was a very intelligent thinking elephant that was devoted to her family until the very end of her life. I like elephants even more than lions, but the good films about them are harder to find.",1363996800,10,1345,4.530864197530864
4259518,5,B00443FMHU,"Great photography and explanation of the family of Echo. In this time when the African Elephant is very endangered it is of small comfort to have a video of that amazing mammal.  That is why supporting the David Sheldrick Wildlife Foundation, which rescues the young of those slaughtered for their tusks, is so very very important!",1362873600,5,331,4.910714285714286
4259519,5,B00443FMHU,"Along with tigers, have an even greated appreciation and love for a disappearing African ELEPHANT!  This CD is excellently filmed, so natural and real!",1358035200,,151,5.291666666666667
4259520,5,B00443FMHU,I purchased this DVD through Amazon and I am so happy I did.  It is a true story and will warm your heart.  I learned so much about Elephants and their capacity of love of family.  Wonderful!  I recommend it to anyone who loves animals.,1357776000,,236,4.177777777777778
4259521,5,B00443FMHU,My grandsons watch this movie over and over again.  DVD arrived as described.  If you have children who enjoy wildlife movies this is a definite must have.,1357516800,,155,4.703703703703703

8415655,5,B00443FMHU,"I just watched this on TV after watching my DVD called ""ECHO OF THE ELEPHANTS"" The story of an Elephant Family.
Of course their were tears at Echo's death. Tissues are needed BUT it made me want to buy whatever i could further on the subject.
Humans could learn so much from Elephants and the rest of the animal world about how to raise, teach their young.
How a family all take care for one another something Humans have lost sight of now. Respect for elders etc. etc. The Red Indians had this type of heirarchy as have many other Indiginous.",1492819200,,543,4.3861386138613865

8415659,5,B00443FMHU,"I love elephants and I am very sad that they are being slaughtered daily. They are intelligent and much like humans, they have feelings and even cry tears. Having been surrounded by a herd in Africa I was never afraid. They are gentle giants. This is the story of a truly awesome matriarch, sad and joyful. Truly an elephant for all time.",1458000000,,338,4.467741935483871
8415660,5,B00443FMHU,"Echo is truly an elephant to remember once you see this well done, emotional and heartbreaking documentary.
