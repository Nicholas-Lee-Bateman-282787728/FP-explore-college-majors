8208317,5,B000MM0Y3Y,"For me personally, this is the top-rated ""Drumming as entertainment"" DVD I own. It is not an instructional DVD as such, but there's plenty of opportunity to learn, if that's what you want. The audio and video quality are, for me, approaching perfection. Zero complaints. The only such disc I would bring to the desert island.",1507420800,,325,4.821428571428571
8208318,5,B000MM0Y3Y,"This DVD is amazing!  I find it heart breaking and inspirational at the same time.  The inspiration comes when it motivates you to practice.  Heartbreaking when you know that you need to work so much harder.  Great music, great insights and different players and approaches for any style and taste to enjoy and learn from.",1364688000,,322,4.8
8208319,3,B000MM0Y3Y,"The DVD is a perfect 10, but the team that filmed the event is zero points.
Change angle all the time, very bad.
Still it's great to see these great musicians together.",1295827200,,168,4.28125
