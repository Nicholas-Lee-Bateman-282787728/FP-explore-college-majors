8018169,1,B0001XLJ2Y,"A corrupt Las Vegas casino owner, Roy Murcant (Nick Mancuso) is presumed by his primary banker to be embezzling funds from his corporation, and following their demand for an audit, Murcant orders his accountant to secrete a second (clandestine) set of books that would, if revealed, clearly implicate him in illicit financial affairs, including bribery of local politicians and police officials, therewith undoubtedly resulting in an indictment, but after the bookkeeper is slain in his home, it becomes apparent that a list of homicide suspects that might benefit from possession of the damning ledgers is increasing apace.  A recently dismissed Miami, Florida area police officer, Jack Newland (Louis Mandylor), terminated because of possible involvement in illegal behaviour, arrives in the Nevada city where he applies for employment in a detective assignment with Las Vegas P.D., is promptly hired by a chief of detectives who is dishonest himself, but subsequent to his again being fired, following a week upon the job, for nosing about too closely into the murder of Murcant's accountant, he is immediately offered a position that he accepts as investigator by the head of the Nevada Gaming Commission, enabling him to persist with his diligent investigative activity, all this part of a confusing plot wherein sense is in the ""now you see it, now you don't"" category.  A bit of a blessing comes as the somewhat torpid Mandylor's character is granted the largest percentage of the film's footage, thereby reducing the amount of the first-billed and hammy Mancuso's habitual scenery chewing.  The plotline is full of holes, lacking continuity and logic as well, while dialogue is poorly written and reflects tepid direction.  In addition, law enforcement and paramedic procedures are ludicrously inaccurate; yet, the most wearing element to a viewer will be the obsessive use of closeups, even applied to scenes involving fisticuffs, with camera stylistics eventually leading to near nauseation.  The players, lacking a strong hand at the helm, cannot accomplish much with the lines supplied to them, and choppy cutting and editing, including poorly accomplished sound synchronization, also contributes negatively to this messy melodrama that is wanting any consistent type of format.",1163808000,,2290,5.421348314606742
