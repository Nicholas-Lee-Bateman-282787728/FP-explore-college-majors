6253490,4,B00I86MQF0,"Ok, while I don't understand about the political machinations regarding excluded episodes I am more than a little ticked off when they included the first half of ""Missing"" but not the conclusion. Why in the name of all that is Holy would someone be so petty? At first I thought maybe it was concern for some racial fall-out....but that doesn't make sense given the entire basis of the series. Why would you release and charge an arm and a leg for something and then only include half of a two part episode?",1395532800,30,506,4.510869565217392
6253491,1,B00I86MQF0,"The first several seasons of this show were, in my opinion, the best.  However when a studio hold back releasing some episodes under the guise of some obscure legal slight of hand it is time to take a stand and not order any of the offerings.  One can only assume that left on their own the 'missing' episodes will magically become available at some future date at a higher cost.  Myself, I'm going to avoid the rush and not order any until the sets are issued in complete package.  The shame will be if I forget about it before that happens, and then it will be the studio that suffers the lose.
In the meantime, there are some very competent shows from the BBC that will serve to entertain.",1395100800,,692,4.341085271317829
6253492,1,B00I86MQF0,"16 missing episodes from these two seasons.  The release of these seasons with missing episodes is just an example of a company wanting to exploit all the fans of this great show.  TGG Direct doesn't care about this show or its fans.  If these seasons are released later on in their entirety, do you think we will get even so much as an apology from TGG Direct?  They will be laughing all the way to the bank, especially if they are the company that is releasing the complete seasons.

I'm personally not going to buy any more of these haphazard releases from a greedy incompetent company that doesn't care one bit about the purpose for buying a TV show on DVD, TO HAVE THE WHOLE SEASON WHEN YOU BUY IT.  If you want to complain, you can visit the TGG Direct web site here: [...]

I'm also complaining strongly to MGM by contacting them through these two links (direct comments to Roma Khanna President, Television Group and Digital or Gary Barber, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer):

6253493,2,B00I86MQF0,"I have been waiting years for the release of In the Heat of the Night as were a lot of people, but, I am very disappointed that at least 15 episodes have been left out of season 2 and 3, and I was disappointed when season 1 came out on two discs and only had 2 episodes on each disc.
I would never pay the $ 31.96  they are asking for seasons 2 and 3, I really would rather not watch it at all then have episodes skipped.
I might would pay 10 or 12 dollars for the seasons 2 and 3 even though they are missing a lot of episodes but never more then that.",1394236800,6,553,3.7672413793103448
6253494,5,B00I86MQF0,"In The Heat of the Night Facebook Fan CLub page posted from TGG Direct as to the reasons why the episodes are missing.  It wouldn't matter which studio licensed the series, MGM won't allow the episodes to be cleared:

""Hello,

Thank you for your email.  When TGG Direct licensed this series, there were episodes that had home video clearance issues such as music rights, etc. that prevent us from releasing the complete series.  It is not in the authority of TGG Direct to authorize clearance nor are we provided the exact legal issue that is prohibiting the release of these excluded episodes.  TGG felt it unfair to the fans of the show to not release the seasons due to missing episodes.  We have no idea if or whether these episodes will ever be released on DVD.

Many people are confused as to why digital downloads are available for episodes that are not released on DVD.  The reason is that of the same nature as to why these episodes are available and shown on TV.  Digital download is viewed the same as television and rights or clearance issues pertain to only in the format of home video.

I hope this clears some issues up.

Best,
Michelle""",1392940800,58,1152,4.565853658536585
6253495,1,B00I86MQF0,"I was thrilled to see this series was going to be released.  But now I don't even know if I will purchase the remaining seasons.  I was upset when seasons 4 and 5 were each missing 3 episodes.  I could have forgiven even that in the upcoming releases, but considering nearly 1/4 of the episodes are missing from the remaining 4 seasons I am not sure I will waste my money.  This is just unheard of.  I hope MGM takes note. There seems to be plenty of interest in this series but this is simply a slap in the face to us consumers.  If MGM doesn't want to mess with this, I wish they would license it to a studio that would give it the proper handling it deserves.  To add to the frustration On Season 4 and 5 I have an episode on each Season that will play the opening sequence and then just freezes and won't play the episode.  I have had 3-4 copies of each disc and the same thing on every copy.  So there's 2 more episodes to add to the omission list.  I still have Seasons 2, 3, 6, and 7 to watch and can't wait to see what problems those discs have.  I truly hope one day either MGM will get the clearance it needs to release the series in whole or sub-license it to a major studio like Shout! that would give it proper treatment with a reliable product.  TGG Direct has just made a mess of this and I wish I had passed on it all together.  Considering this is one of my favorite Series that is pretty sad.",1392768000,65,1410,4.046931407942238

TGG Direct were unable to secure all the rights from MGM to include them. This was one of the last sets released because of this but they decided to release what they had, as a set due to the number of episodes missing from each season. Season 2 is Volume 1 and Season 3 is Volume 2. Most people complain that the second part to the episode Missing is not included. It was actually never filmed, after the episode aired O'Connor decided to change the first episode of Season 3 because the content involving Althea would be more dramatic. There was a closer of sorts to the story line, when asked Gillespie says, ""I talked them into letting me go."" This episode is not included. Most reviewers said that their discs had malfunctions, I only had one instance where the audio cut out, but it came back in and the episode continued. About the show itself, it is a good show with drama, comedy, loss, racial tension, action, and it dealt with a lot of subject considered taboo at the time. That being said, it you didn't watch the show during it original run, or reruns growing up, you may find the show a little difficult to get into to, but it will be worth the effort.",1429228800,,1289,4.330578512396694

I grew up watching ""In The Heat of the Night"" and waited years for the series to come out on DVD. Now that I finally own a few seasons, I almost wish the series hadn't been released yet. First, the packaging on these DVD sets is terrible. The inserts arrived broken and out of place within the set in every season. For the price of each season, the manufacturer could have tried a little harder. Second, and most disappointing, a great number of episodes are missing from the DVD release. While Amazon.com does now share this fact in the description of the products, the DVD boxes themselves do not make any mention of the missing episodes. If you receive the DVDs as a gift like I did, you'll notice a lack of continuity from one episode to the next - when did that character die? Why are there babies when that character was never pregnant? What prior case are they talking about and why are they talking about it as though we've seen it? Apparently due to copyright issues, some of the episodes were never cleared for release, so your DVD set will only contain those that were cleared. However, this is a drama and one that should be watched in order. Season 3 alone is missing 10 episodes. 10!!! If you can get past that, you'll enjoy the episodes we are allowed to see, but if you actually remember the show enough to know what's missing, it will probably be a frustrating experience to have to fill in the blanks from memory.

While the shows, themselves, are great to watch, the most frustrating part is that the last episode provided for Season 2 is the 1st half of a two-parter in a story of Chief Gillespie's kidnapping...and you don't get to see the rest of that story!

I hope that this will be fixed in the near future. It was one of the best TV shows I have watched. We get a lot of repeats in Australia where I live however we never get this one - but nor do we get an entire series of anything as I have bought many TV show and have seen episodes that were never shown on Aussie TV.

and along those lines, all the 1-star ratings are people whining about missing episodes!  none of them review the actual series!  so, anyone reading these reviews who hasn't ever seen this series before and is wondering whether or not to buy any of the sets, ignore those reviews, or just read and take to heart those that actually are talking about the quality of the show.

as far as the series, there is something very special about the cast and their interactions.  the acting was corny at times, but that never detracted from the quality of the show and its principles.  some of the issues addressed are excellently dealt with, and it gives such a realistic feel to the episodes.  the minor cast rarely went wrong in their portrayals and it was always a joy to see the kindness and respect the chief and officers showed everyone.  modern men just don't have that quality anymore.",1402012800,,1397,4.496031746031746

IMDB has a list of every episode from the series, and aside from the said excluded episodes, nothing else is missing. The volume issue can be cleared up as well. There is no S2 V2 or S3 V1, because S2 is V1, and S3 is V2 of the set. They have not split the seasons into two volumes apiece because of the exclusions.

The combination of O'Connor and the great Howard Rollins was sensational.  By season three, the series began to jell. O'Connor had taken over the show.  The Story Editor (the ""Head Writer"" in this series) was Matt Harris, aka Carroll O'Connor.  By season four, O'Connor would fire all but two writers and take the series into the top 20. For any fan of ITHOTN, this is a must buy!

Unfortunately, most of these reviews are for what is missing and not what is here to be enjoyed.  Too bad. The reason the series was held up for so long was due to licensing agreements.

Before I begin, take notice that seasons 2 and 3 are missing around half of their respective episodes. You're buying a dvd set with scattered episodes; any perspective buyer should take this into account.

My experience with TGG Direct, the group who released this dvd, is more than disappointing. I purchased Seasons 2/3, 6, and 7 from amazon.com. Upon arriving, my season 6 box set did not have the discs properly fastened into their slots so my discs came in with heavy physical damage from sliding all around the case. Also, Seasons 2/3 had no physical damage but contained audio issues when playing - some episodes have instances of muted sound which was most prevalent during the episode ""Triangle"". I exchanged seasons 2/3 via amazon.com for another one, only to have the new box set come in but the discs' slots on the new cases were broken and will not allow the discs to be properly fastened in - they too will surely be scratch because of this. I am very unsatisfied with TGG Direct's products and will not be purchasing any more products from this company. Unless I happened to be one unlucky customer, I am left to assume that this is kind of ""quality"" products that they provide. I hate to sound so negative but I have been burned by them once too many. All the while not one of my emails have been responded to by TGG Direct.

6253787,2,B00I86MQF0,"I am not one to write a lot of negative reviews, but this product surely deserves one!  To the point, why, WHY are there missing, that's right, missing episodes?  A few of my favorite episodes like Fairest of them All, and A Loss of Innocence aren't included with the others!  I don't understand it.  Those episodes are part of season 3 and they're missing.  I frankly was looking forward to having those episodes and being able to watch them whenever I wanted at last, and the manufacturer, or whoever is responsible comes out with this?  I honestly feel a little scammed, paying what I did and having to wait as long as I did for this to show up on my doorstep, and only to discover that a few of my favorite episodes weren't included.  This product is extremely disappointing.",1395532800,55,779,4.521428571428571

8639775,3,B00I86MQF0,"Ok, I love this show so I ordered the first 7 seasons. The eighth isn't available yet. You do NOT get every episode on any of the seasons. Many are missing. I was quite disappointed with that but I am keeping them because it's to much hassle to send back. Hopefully someday they will come out with a box set with EVERY EPISODE. The price is a bit high considering what's missing but if your a big fan, it's better than nothing.",1500336000,,427,4.219512195121951

8639778,1,B00I86MQF0,"This is not the complete 2nd and 3rd seasons.  That is what I thought I was purchasing.  What I received was Season 2 Vol 1 (the first half of the season) and then Season 3 Vol 2 (the second half of the season).

I wish I had read the other reviews before I purchased this.  I did return this and received a refund.  I am not sure how this can be advertised as Seasons 2-3 when clearly it is only a few episodes of each season.  I purchased this for a Christmas gift so it was disappointing when we realized we did not get what the package clearly says it is.  With all the negative complaints and proof it is not what it says it is I am not sure how this is still available for purchase.  Unless the description is changed to reflect what you are really buying.  I did notice as I am updating this review that it says the item is ""currently unavailable"".

I want to purchase other seasons of this show but now I am afraid to.  This is the only show I have ever run in to this problem with.  And I have bought a ton of DVDs from Amazon.",1486944000,5,1036,4.0
