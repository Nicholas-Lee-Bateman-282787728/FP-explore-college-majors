On HALLOWEEN in 1998, Jeffrey Crown killed his parents by poisoning their apples. He was sent to Livingston Asylum for life. During his time in the asylum, he drew over a thousand pictures of pumpkins and wears a grotesque pumpkin mask, thus earning him the name 'Pumpkin Man' Ten years later, he breaks out and returns to his home town of Paducah, KY. He goes to a house where people rent rooms. Miss Shaw is the landlady and the tenants are Ben Givens and Detective William Slade. Throughout the HALLOWEEN day, Ben and Miss Shaw hear about Pumpkin Man escaping. Slade is at work, trying to figure out where Jeffrey will go. He seeks help from Dr. Manchester and Dr. Raven. When Ben and Miss Shaw are babysitting some kids, Pumpkin Man comes and crashes the party. I think it's an absolute masterpiece. I highly recommend PUMPKIN MAN!!!

Updated on October 24th, 2009: I have directed a sequel and here is the plot;

One year after Pumpkin Man's massacre, he awakes from his coma on HALLOWEEN to get back Bazieme's amulet that Miss Shaw stole from him in the original. The amulet has made Miss Shaw evil. Detective Slade is writing a book based on Pumpkin Man's life, and Ben Givens tries to help Miss Shaw. Meanwhile, Pumpkin Man's friend from Livingston Asylum, Alex Richardson is the leader of the gothic Hell's Knights cult and  kidnaps a girl named Delilah and plan to sacrifice her to their Demon-God, Bazieme. It's the final chapter of the Pumpkin Man saga and how will it all end? I highly recommend PUMPKIN MAN 2!!!",1232755200,,1740,4.585209003215434
