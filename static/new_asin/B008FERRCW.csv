When I think of 80's hair metal I think of bands like Motley Crue, Ratt, Poison, Dokken.  There was a very small snippet of interview with Stephen Pearcy of Ratt and some good footage with CC Deville but nothing with Motley, nothing with Dokken and in short just disappointing.  I guess for $5.00 I shouldn't have had such high expectations.  :)",1382400000,,457,4.604938271604938
8527313,3,B008FERRCW,"it could had more concert footage,but the interviews is ok,had some good rock interviews,but don't get me wrong its a good dvd to watch and put it up with your other concert videos,you probably won't watch it again,but for coming in the mail and being good shape was fast,and in good shape",1378512000,2,289,4.576923076923077
