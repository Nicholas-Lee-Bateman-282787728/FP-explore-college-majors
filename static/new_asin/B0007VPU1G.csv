This video sure shows plenty of knowledge on Deer hunting tips and strategies to help you be more successful! It even has an all-star cast of expert hunters such as wildlife biologist Dr. Grant Woods, Will Primos of Primos Hunting Calls, Harold Knight and David Hale of Knight & Hale Game Calls, along with the late Dick Kirby of Quaker Boy Game Calls.
