8615544,5,B00FG99AC4,"Unlike the other ""reviewers"" my $60 Samsung Blu Ray player from Costco had no issues with this ALL REGION blu Ray. It is what it advertises itself to be the full 3 plus hour BBC telecast of the match from the nearly 15 minute warmup to the conclusion. It is the widescreen HD broadcast and nothing to fault (excuse the pun) that.  My only wish is that the US broadcast would have been more exciting with John McEnroe and gang calling the match... these Brits can be .... boring in comparison in the booth.  Minor beef... we have the full match in HD  and wonderful to enjoy this magic Wimbledon for the UK after 77 years of waiting....",1413590400,2,635,4.364406779661017
8615545,1,B00FG99AC4,would not play on 2 different DVD players.  It acted like a PAL recording on NTSC product.  returned & reordered w/same results.,1394150400,,128,4.7727272727272725
8615546,1,B00FG99AC4,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She was in England for Wimbledon. It wouldn't play, we sent it back and got a new one. Wouldn't play. Come to find out they are not coded to play on American Blu-Ray players...Sucks",1390348800,,226,4.404761904761905
8615547,1,B00FG99AC4,"Since the DVD is described as being for all regions in the specifications and it shipped from the US I assumed this would be able to play on an American Blu-Ray DVD player. It doesn't. I exchanged it once with the same results and Amazon suggested I return it and give up. So either they had a bad batch of DVDs or the specifications are wrong. And I promise our player has no problem with any other blu-ray DVD.

The tennis match itself is great, though. I highly recommend finding a working copy of this DVD.",1388966400,2,510,4.3125
8615548,1,B00FG99AC4,"Tried the disk on both of my Blue Ray players and on an older DVD player. The disk is not recognized by the players. The players work fine with other disk.  I returned the disk to amazon and they quickly provided a new one but it did exactly the same thing. Amazon is providing a refund but clearly something is very wrong with this product. I contacted Amazon by phone but they don't have an answer and this product will likely stay available till somebody figures out that there is a problem. Since this originated in the UK, my guess would be it is the wrong format for the US.",1388793600,2,580,4.2727272727272725
