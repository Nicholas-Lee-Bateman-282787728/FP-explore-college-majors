4250292,4,B0042FDCKY,"I think it great that Echo Bridge Entertainment is willing to provide fans with three movies  for one low price. I just wish that Full Moon would provide the DVD company with a slightly better picture quality of some of their films as well as provide them with at least movie trailer for an bonus feature.

Always like Demonic Toys as it reminded me some what of another movie Charles Band did outside the Full Moon label  called Dolls.  Demonic Toys deals with a demon like force who been waiting over 60 years for a host to allow him to be born into our world. When a female cop stumbles onto the place she has to call upon the magic of her unborn child to aid her in escaping the toys the demon brings to life to do its bidding. The picture quality of the movie was pretty good and the story itself one of Full Moon's best.

While I would of rather of had Bad Channels as a second movie over Doll Man can see why the title was chosen for this trilogy set. This movie has the worst picture quality on the set but being my least favorite of the three movie that okay too. It deals with an humanoid alien cop who while in the pursuit of justice crash lands on earth to find everything is like 10 times bigger proportion wise to that of his home world. He end up coming to the aid of this woman whose having some gang problems.

The third movie Dolman vs Demonic Toys has the best picture quality of the three films on the set I got from Amazon and has Dollman seeking out the nurse from Bad Channels who was shrunk by aliens.  Shortly after they meet one another the cop from Demonic toys shows up asking for their help. Because of their size they can go after the toys and go where she couldn't to take care of the demons newest attempt to come to enter our world.",1331942400,,1765,4.173529411764706
4250293,4,B0042FDCKY,"Demonic Toys was a bit of a horror movie classic with funny bad guy characters and brief nudity. Dollman was interesting, but more of a bust. The sequel which incorporates both films was horrendously bad. The problem with this 3 pack is that it should be a 4 pack. The movie Bad Channels which introduces Nurse Ginger in the final film is missing from the group. This film would have greatly enhanced a so-so 3 pack.

For $5.00 in the bargain bin, you can't go wrong. Just don't have great expectations after the first feature. They short changed us a movie, I'll short change them a star.",1324857600,,589,4.5046728971962615

4250296,5,B0042FDCKY,"A awesome collection for all the fans of Full Moon movies. This movies were made in the golden years of Full Moon. When wherever video store you went you could find any full moon title. Now in this days these title are difficult to find and that make it collectable.

What I don't like about this DVD is that is a two face disc and I always fine that a problem because it make it easy to damage surface of the Disc. The other thing I don't like is that the movies are not in a chronology order since they are printer from the last to the first. Why? All I can think is because of the compression of the movies. But even that don't make sense because the longer movie is the first one and it in the side where are two movies. The correct order is like it printer in the art work of the DVD case. If you view them in that order the stories will make sense because they all are connected to the last movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dollman-Vs-Demonic-Toys-VHS/dp/6302884829/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dollman Vs Demonic Toys [VHS</a>].",1309305600,2,1081,4.780748663101604
4250297,5,B0042FDCKY,These echo bridge dvd compilations of b movies are the best thing since sliced bread!  You get 3 really hard to find movies in one stripped down cheap package.  The picture quality isn't great but it wasn't any better on the dvds released by full moon.  Only drawback is that it's only available from one retail shop (the one with the K) whereas the W has the rest of the echo bridge comps.  A minor issue is that there are two box art covers floating around with this one being much better than the other one (if that's an issue for you).  Definitely worth the price being charged.,1305331200,9,582,4.351851851851852
4250298,4,B0042FDCKY,"I enjoyed these movies tremendously, they're good silly fun, but Dollman Vs. Demonic Toys was WAY too short.  It felt like they just wanted to hurry up and finish it so they could go do something else.  I mean, 61 minutes???  It was good fun while it lasted, it just didn't last long enough, the ending felt rushed, they could've done so much more with that movie.  Don't know why they're asking so much for this here, I picked it up for 5 bucks at K-Mart.  It's definitely worth 5 bucks.  -kd5-",1302739200,6,495,4.326086956521739

4250313,3,B0042FDCKY,"They were AWESOME back in the 80s when you saw them for the 1st time.

But NOW, with the word ""QUALITY"" defining wheather or not a movie is good, these movies don't hold up to the Bar.

the Camera Work, Acting, Editing, etc... are not upto Par with TODAYs standards, but they are still Unique movies, and I just had to add them to my Collection.

I saw them as a kid, they were Great, but now, as an Adult...... -eh-..... (so-so)",1381881600,,429,4.2073170731707314
4250314,5,B0042FDCKY,"I watched this when I was younger. Have always wanted to see them again. this is a great find. this is a small series. it goes Demonic Toys, Dollman, Demonic Toys... then they came out with a Demonic Toys Vs. The Puppet Master (the last I haven't seen yet). But I love Full Moon pictures. They specialize in B horror. If u do not like B horror, stay clear. But it is silly and great and I love it!!!!!",1377907200,2,401,4.0886075949367084

First police woman Judith Grey fights the Demonic Toys.  Fighting for her life and her unborn son's life and Soul.

Next an Alien Police man, Brick Bardo, crashes on Earth.  His alien firepower allows a foot tall humanoid to still be lethal on Earth.  He battle a large gang of human punks, and his nemesis who'd also come to Earth.

In the final movie, Brick finds a beautiful blond who'd been shrunk by aliens.  She and Brick were the same height, and were a good match to boot.  Then Judith comes calling on Brick, after the Demonic Toys return. .  All 3 team up to battle the Toys, and their Master.",1424304000,,672,4.26984126984127
