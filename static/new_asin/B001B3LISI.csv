8281788,2,B001B3LISI,the seller got this item to me right away I am highly satisfied with the sellar.  with the movie the actors did their best but no amount of talented acting could of saved this movie.  It was so convoluted and dumb I watched it until the end and while it did have a good ending it was a complete waste of time.,1500854400,,309,3.967741935483871

8281791,2,B001B3LISI,"I like weird movies in general, but this was a weird, weird movie. I don't even know how I would describe it. One thing did stand out, though. I absolutely lost count of how many times the F-word was thrown around. Maybe the intent was to bump the rating up to ""R"" and boost its street cred... FAIL.",1374537600,,299,4.172413793103448
8281792,4,B001B3LISI,"I ended up buying this movie because I'm a fan of Josh Dallas and Once Upon a Time. I didn't expect much after watching the trailer, but the end result was better than I thought. It definitely did put me in mind of ""The Game."" There was action, suspense, and even a bit of humor. It was interesting to see Josh play such a wildly different character from Prince Charming.",1330646400,,371,4.314285714285714
8281793,3,B001B3LISI,"Despite the implausible sequence of events in this film (as enumerated by the other reviewers), I found the movie to be quite gripping - up to a point! A dead beat when it comes to repaying his debts, Alex North (played by GM) is given 80 minutes to come up with $15,000.00 in the wee hours of the night (all the banks are long closed) or he will die from a lethal injection of poison. The antidote will be his reward. Along the way, Alex encounters (literally) a man in a new Jaguar with issues of his own; a couple of keystone-cops type of policemen; goes to his apparently alienated brother who is a well to do physician from whom he gets the necessary funds in the form of a check(!); enlists the aid of two spaced out friends (Floyd and Lloyd - read Heckle and Jeckle); is then attacked by some nasty bikers who can't seem to hit the side of a barn even with endless rounds of gunfire; crashes into a lake; he and his friends and the check miraculously survive; eludes the police once more with the aid of his girlfriend Mona; makes it home with the check after shooting the biker leader who was going to kill his friend Floyd (Loyd was already done in earlier for giving a bad tip on a horse); discovers that the chief baddy has now gone back to the restaurant he owns leaving a shot and bleeding henchman behind; makes a final mad dash to said restaurant only to discover that there is no syringe to inject him with the antidote; shoots the chief baddy with his dying breath - and then (Drum Roll) discovers that the whole affair was a ""Birthday"" setup compliments of his friend Floyd. Everyone is there in the restaurant (except for ""Jaguar man"" and the two cops who were ""for real""), nobody got shot, nobody got killed, and we then have a giant love fest.  Guess what? - You've just seen a remake (shot in Berlin it seems) of a 1997 movie titled THE GAME starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn as his brother!!  Holy Moly! Had enough? Satified?  Questions abound: How could anyone be certain that Alex, Floyd, Lloyd, and the check would survive their dip in the pond? Escape a crazed ""Jaguar man""? Or escape the police? How did Floyd get to Alex's apartment without any vehicle? Who's on First?",1330214400,,2203,4.407862407862408
8281794,2,B001B3LISI,"Short Attention Span Summary (missing a few plot details):

1. A guy seems to be a loser who borrowed some money from a Bad Man (that owns a restaurant).

2. The Bad Man comes in and is very angry and wants his money back. To accomplish this, he injects the loser with a serum that contains a poison that will kill him in 80 minutes

3. Said loser goes to the hospital to get the money from his brother and has a blood test that shows that his white cells are increasing in such a way that he will be dead in an hour. The hospital tells him that they can have a serum for him in about 3 hours-- which is 2 hours too late. He calls some friends to pick him up with the check from his brother.

4. On the way back to his house, he encounters all sorts of mishaps-- including some guys that want to execute his friend for $7,000 that he owes them. They execute the friend and he runs away.

5. Through some long series of mishaps, he ends up at the restaurant of the man to whom he owed the money. The Bad Man taunts him and drops the vial on the floor. He shoots the man.

6. It comes out at this point that the bullets in the guns were blanks, and that every single part of the ordeal was staged. His friends had paid off the money that he owed to the Bad Man and staged the event as a hoax.

Comments:

1. These actors had a bunch of not-quite-identifiable accents that made me believe that the whole thing was shot in France.

2. This movie was just way past the plausibility point. They could have had the loser go through all this trouble and then find out that it was a dream. But to imagine that so many people could know one person and stage all of this? Just way too much.

3. When you consider that these actors were perfoming in what was not their first language, the performances seemed good. But if you discount that fact, then the performances were pretty mediocre.

I don't recommend this movie for any price. No matter how cheaply you can find it, it will be a complete waste of time.",1234137600,2,1998,4.110539845758355
8281795,2,B001B3LISI,"Thomas Jahn directed this gritty drama. Jahn has worked extensively in Germany and also wrote the screenplay. It's a chase movie that zips along quickly. Gabriel Mann who was in ""The Bourne Supremacy"" plays Alex North, a young man with financial problems. Alex borrowed from a restaurant owner and is overdue with payment. German actor Francis Fulton-Smith plays the restaurant owner Walter with evil delight. When Alex is injected with a lethal poison that must have the antidote in 80 minutes, he bolts like a madman to try to secure the funds. This sets up the events that follow.  Alex shows up to talk to his doctor brother at the hospital. His brother Vincent is played by German actor Max Urlacher who has a small part in the upcoming Tom Cruise film ""Valkyrie."" Then Alex calls friends Floyd & Lloyd. Lloyd is played by Oliver Kieran-Jones. Floyd is played by Joshua Dallas who experiences events through a smoky haze. Alex's girlfriend Mona played by Natalia Avelon helps out. Improbably, a wet check is apparently still good after a swim in the river.  I'd guess it was written with non-water-soluble ink!  When the film concluded, my reaction was, ""Oh, is that all there is to this?"" Gabriel Mann is somewhat convincing as North. Max Urlacher as his brother and Oliver Kieran-Jones as Lloyd also turn in good supporting performances. Ultimately, this is one DVD I could afford to miss. Taxi!",1229040000,,1402,4.857740585774058
8281796,4,B001B3LISI,"I know, i know. A lot of People don't like this Film, but... It was done for very,  very little Money(No excuse) and its just great Exploitation. I love Gabriel Mann and Josh Dallas, and all the other Actors. They shot that Film in 12 Days and did a very good Job. It fun to watch and its very Politicly Uncorrect. Thats why i like it so much. And by the way, the Screen Format ist 2.35 : 1 in 16:9 Anamorphic Video.",1224460800,4,416,4.0120481927710845
