8481228,4,B001RCTJ70,"This is a very nice film for anyone interested in Mt. Kailash or in traveling to Tibet in general.  A few short parts of the film were a bit fuzzy (mostly in the caves where the lighting was low), and on occasion it was difficult to hear Dr. Thurman teaching due to sound quality problems, but it was really wonderful to view.  Considering that the video camera may have to have been hidden much of the time, since the Chinese communists don't like foreigners filming in some places, it was quite well done.  Along with this DVD I would also highly recommend Bob Thurman's book on a pilgrimage to Mt. kailash ""Circling the Sacred Mountain.""",1353024000,2,640,4.547826086956522
