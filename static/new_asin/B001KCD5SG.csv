3664475,3,B001KCD5SG,"Let's face it. We bought this particular ski movie becuase it's one of the few Blu-ray ski movies. Just like most ""HD"" content, it is watered down or not HD at all. I would have to say that at the very most, 30% of this movie was actually shot with HD cameras. By HD, I mean 1080i/p. Most of the actual HD shots are interview style shots. Very few actual HD action shots, but the ones that are are very sharp. When it's HD, you can just tell because it really POPS.

It's just like cable and dish. They just cannot or will not deliver REAL HD content for whatever practical, logistical, or financial reason. HD Theater and History HD really pop, but most of the commercials are very noticably shot in standard definition. You can display it in HD, but if it's not recorded/shot in HD, why bother?

Real HD content is sparse. When I got my HDTV, I found myself watching things I would never watch just because they were in HD. Now I just watch what I find entertaining, and most of it is not HD. I'm still waiting for the justification for my HDTV purchase.",1262044800,,1056,4.301507537688442
3664476,5,B001KCD5SG,I turn this movie on whenever i miss skiing and have probably watched it a hundred times. Never gets old. Soundtrack is amazing and so is the footage and quality. If you've ever skied or snowboarded before you have to buy this movie. Even if you haven't you should because im sure it will make you want to.,1254268800,,306,4.293103448275862
3664477,5,B001KCD5SG,best ski film i have seen and I have seen many having been a skier for over 40 years.,1240790400,,85,3.526315789473684
3664478,5,B001KCD5SG,"Hands down the best ski movie of the season. It is entertaining, inspiring, fun and creative.  I watched this one first because it was the first Blu-Ray ski movie.  All the other new films that came out this year pale in comparison (Reasons by Poor Boyz Productions, Under the Influence by Teton Gravity Research, The Massive by Red Bull Moving Pictures, Hunting Yeti by Nimbus Entertainment and Turbo by Level 1 Productions.)  Powder Magazine gave ""Reasons"" the movie of the year, which I don't understand at all.  I am beginning to think that Powder is just trying to help other groups beside Matchstick and Teton Gravity sell DVDs.

The first 30 minutes of ""Under the the Influence"" has more insane lines thanks to Sage, Seth and Ian - but top to bottom Claim is better.  Award good film making and promote the production of more Blue-Ray by buying this one (and maybe ""Under the the Influence""). Here is a link to a more professional review of this movie [...] and results from all the Powder Awards. [...]",1235088000,2,1010,4.677966101694915
3664479,5,B001KCD5SG,"This is the first MSP blu-ray (and maybe the first ski movie in HD).  Like all their movies it is filled with gorgeous mountain views and snowscapes that just pop in 1080p.  The powder sparkles and you feel just that much closer to the action.

I am a big match stick fan, and while the movie is up to par, it does not break any new ground.  Saucer boy does make an appearance but only briefly.  As whole, Seven Sunny Days has better scenes and sound track. I'm giving this 5 stars because it is the first HD ski movie I've seen (?made) but only 4 stars for content.",1230854400,,566,4.155963302752293
3664551,1,B001KCD5SG,"This isn't a ski movie. There is no plot, nothing to hold your attention if you are not a skier. It is mis-advertised. What it is: a rock music playlist set to skiing. OK, I love to watch skiing. This video makes me appreciate ski event announcers more than I have before. They make it interesting and exciting.",1422748800,,311,4.379310344827586

3664556,4,B001KCD5SG,"I really enjoyed this film! Just a bunch of great skiers out having a good time, skiing some fantastic lines, and not taking themselves too seriously. If you ski, this is worth watching.",1395532800,,186,4.666666666666667
3664557,5,B001KCD5SG,"Yup, you read that correctly. This is the greatest ski movie of all time. The last movie before Shane's untimely departure, Heimer hucking his meat, Hoji previewing his greatness and Abma and CRJ slaughtering some BC pillows. Oh, the soundtrack is excellent.

If you don't like this movie, you don't like America and should just quite life.

3664560,1,B001KCD5SG,"You know how some documentaries are uplifting, or allow you to gain an appreciation of a subject?

This one isn't like that.

Instead, it felt like having to listen to a small group talk excitedly about an event you didn't attend.

I've seen great skiing movies where one was amazed at what was possible, but this one didn't even manage to engage us in that way.

Websites and magazines more devoted to the persons in question might give this better reviews... but I don't represent them. I'm just an average Amazon user.",1383609600,,521,4.630434782608695

8314703,2,B001KCD5SG,"It amazes me how many great skiers are featured in terrible movies. Like this one. String a bunch hucking clips together, along with some big lines, edited terribly and you have (C) Laim.  Example: you're watching a guy ski a beautiful big line off a tall peak, first from far away, then with cuts to close-ups and back to far away. The problem? The cuts to close-ups are completely different scenes! Including tree skiing and other obvious slack-country. Disjointed, repetitive and... Lame. Glad I didn't pay for it.",1453161600,,517,4.875
