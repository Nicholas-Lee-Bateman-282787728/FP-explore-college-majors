5004667,4,B006ME55VW,"To be completely honest, I'm not really much for exploitation/grindhouse type films. I actually find them quite offensive... bahahahaha! Just kidding! Not too much offends me this day and age except when Hollywood takes a classic 80's TV show and turns it into the bumbling buddy type crap that is the new 21 Jumpstreet. Just look at the ridiculous movie poster... for goodness sake! Now a creature feature? I'll sit and watch one after the other without so much as a potty break in between.

In a small Australian coastal town, a trio of female hired killers, Beretta (Nelli Scarlet), Blondie (Karli Madden) and Snowball (Kate Watts) are hiding away in a seaside shack. Shortly after they arrive they run afoul a cranky old neighbor (Norman Yemm) after taking a dip in the ocean. Shaking his fist, he urges them to stay out of the water warning of the dangers that lie in the deep igniting a feud between him and the girls until his granddaughter Hannah (Kyrie Capri) shows up to defuse the situation. The girls take a shine to Hannah and they become fast friends. Hannah is curious about the world outside of her small town and the rebellious lifestyle the trio represent. That night the grandfather's warnings come true and the sea monster returns to the small town it ravaged years ago. Hannah, her grandfather and the three gorgeous killers must join together to survive the deadly Kraken's attack.

Let me start off by saying the casting for this film was dead on. Norman Yemm does a fantastic job as the crabby old man. There wasn't a second in the entire movie where he didn't have me convinced. I absolutely loved his character. The girls did a great job as well. Especially given the outrageous scenes they had to play out. There were some awkward moments, just a few, but these are three vixens you definitely don't wanna cross paths with in a dark alley, or a brightly lit back road or at all for that matter. Capri holds her own as well playing the sweet, innocent granddaughter to a ""delusional"" old man. You can sympathize with her character almost immediately.

I was pretty much digging this one from the beginning. One of the cool things about it was that it starts off in black and white with that sort of rockabilly flare but with the first drop of blood comes the color. It was a very cool transition that I personally hadn't seen before. There were couple of moments in the film where the soundtrack is too loud. Particularly during a key scene where it drowns out some important dialogue. A goof? Yes but not a major one. Stuart Simpson, who wrote, directed, filmed, edited and did all the visual effects, has crafted a very nice homage to 50's era film. It's grindhouse with a SciFi flare. If you like that kinda stuff you're definitely gonna want to check this one out!

5004668,5,B006ME55VW,"This movie is a must-see for fans of exploitation films of the 50's and 60's. It harks back to the movies of Russ Meyer et al, it's funny, clever and fantastically ambitious for a film made on a shoestring budget. El Monstro is kitsch, spoofy and never dull, I highly recommend this movie!",1331510400,2,289,4.471698113207547
5004669,5,B006ME55VW,"This loving homage of 50's monster movies and the tough-girl-gang cinema of Russ Meyer is a must see for any exploitation fan.
Decked out with hot tattooed chicks, tentacles, a shotgun wielding schoolgirl, glorious gore and an obligatory crazy old man..
If you like horror films that remind you of why you became a fan to begin with, do yourself a favour and get this..
Fun stuff...

Also, on a side note.. The short films on the dvd are also a lot of gory, schlocky fun.. Overall a purchase well worth it.",1331510400,5,506,4.5
5004670,2,B006ME55VW,"In the last few dang months, I've pondered if I should just stop watching modern horror films altogether. After watching El Monstro Del Mar, I've thinking that might be a dang good idea. Well, at least until Scream 5 comes out. Or Friday the 13th, Part 69. El Monstro Del Mar, like many in recent years, is a dang horror film that looked fun on paper. But after viewing it, I only found about ten dang minutes that were fun. The gore is about the only good thing in this cheapie that wants to be as dang good as those old Roger Corman movies, but it just can't pull it off. There ain't even any dang nudity in this film. How can you make a modern day horror movie that's set on the dang beach, and there not be any dang nudity? Even Jaws had some dang nudity, and it was rated PG! The bottom line is that I wouldn't want to sit through El Monstro Del Mar again, for all the dang hemorrhoid cream in the world.",1331078400,2,909,4.112359550561798

5004684,5,B006ME55VW,"EL MONSTRO DEL MAR! (aka: MONSTRO!) is about three wild, insane, homicidal women, named Beretta (Nelli Scarlet), Blondie (Karli Madden), and Snowball (Kate Watts), out for a good time. Fans of Russ Meyer, especially his sublime FASTER PUSSYCAT KILL! KILL! will adore these women, even though they're a bit more on the sadistic / psychopathic side than Meyer might have dared to put on film. Not surprisingly, their idea of fun involves cold, bloody murder. After taking care of a pair of overly helpful gents, and taking their car, the terrible trio head out to the beach for a swim. What they don't know is that they've happened upon more than just another good time. Ignoring the cryptic warnings of a local old man, the girls settle in for a night of partying in a beach house, unaware of the lurking terror outside. With a new-found friend named Hannah (Kyrie Capri) in tow, the women rave on, while a group of fishermen is devoured nearby. It appears that a sea monster is hungry for human flesh! Will the three ""man-killers"" recognize the danger they're in, before it's too late? Have they finally met their match? EL MONSTRO DEL MAR! is a well-made, low-budget Australian film from writer / director Stuart Simpson. Very gory, it still manages to have a decent story-line. The monster itself is actually quite menacing! The gooshy finale -almost- enters into blessed DEAD ALIVE territory!

5004690,5,B006ME55VW,"Those who aren't familiar with Russ Meyer's Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! or Roger Corman's innumerous ridiculous monster movies will likely miss the heavy influences they had on Stuart Simpson's newest horror endeavor, El Monstro del Mar. This is Simpson's second attempt at the macabre, his first being a film that he would probably tell you sucks the big one, or at the very least that he was unhappy with it. He was a rookie Director, and threw everything he had into his first attempt at the genre, Demonsamoungus (which is ""Demons Among Us"" all smushed together).

Monstro begins with a trio of sassy, tattooed, cigarette-smoking vixens stranded on the side of the road in at the intersection of anywhere and nowhere. The scene is shot in black and white which, when combined with the girls' style of dress and choice of music, would indicate the film is set sometime in the fifties or sixties, an undeniable tribute to Meyer's Pussycat. That is, of course, until color rapidly bleeds into the film as a pair of guys that stopped to lend a hand are brutally slaughtered by Monstro's three murderesses. At that point the film shifts into a kind of strange timeline, lost between Meyer's nineteen sixties and Simpson's present day. The girls certainly act old-school, but they also listen to cassette tapes, and at one point one of them even uses a cell phone. It's a veritable medley of pop culture from the ages.

Beretta, Blondie, and Snowball (played by Nelli Scarlet, Karli Madden, and Kate Watts respectively) flee the scene where their terror reigned and go to hiding out in a tiny fishing town, in a would-be abandoned building owned by a friend of Blondie's. Fully stocked with booze, drugs, and music, the jezebels waste no time in getting the party started, but when they blatantly ignore the warnings of the crippled old man next door to stay out of the water and go back to the hole they crawled out of, something terrible awakens from the depths of the sea. Something massive...something ancient. Beretta, Blondie, Snowball, and the old man's beautiful daughter Hannah (Kyrie Capri) are nearly drowned in a tide of blood as they face down the tentacled beast that is...the kraken!

Without being privy to everything that goes into a film like Monstro, it's hard to truly appreciate it for the piece of art that it is. I, myself am guilty of judging a book by its cover from time to time and ignoring what could be the greatest film of all time simply because it dates further back than my tastes prefer or because of a hellacious low-budget appearance. Sometimes you have to set yourself aside from the high-brow drivel that effortlessly seeps in and out of the mainstream media and take on a grittier, riskier film. When you learn of the level of heart and soul, of the effort and passion that was put into it, you'll find that films like El Monstro Del Mar belong in a class all their own.

In an article posted in Fangoria Magazine Simpson talks about how many countless hours he spent rotoscoping the final showdown, during which the girls battle the kraken. Rotoscoping is an animation process in which an animator traces over live action figures to cut them from the frame and then place them over another background. The process was used to effectively have the kraken's tentacles writhing in front of and behind the girls as they battled the creature. This had to be done for every single frame. To think that Simpson nearly scrapped his entire project because of how difficult, painstaking, and time consuming this was to do on his own (probably due to lack of budget) makes the entire film more enjoyable, and ultimately Simpson's efforts more admirable.

One of the more difficult challenges one faces when creating a film where the bad guys are also the heroes is convincing the viewer to root for them rather than against them. Rob Zombie pulled it off in The Devil's Rejects, but Simpson achieved something slightly more. With Monstro, it feels almost as if the three harridans exist in a universe all their own. Their deeds, while immoral and utterly *evil*, are overlooked, almost forgiven even, because they are so wicked that they should kick ass and take names. In their world, butchering innocent men doesn't make them deplorable, but rather exemplifies their awesomeness.

Stuart Simpson had a vision with this film, and he pulled it off without flaw. His influences are clearly defined by how definitively they were used, but he was still able to apply his own vision as well. Every facet of the film, from the music during the opening credits to the amazing talent in the cast (including Australian acting legend Norman Yemm) had a positive affect on the finished product. If anything, Stuart has made me a slightly bigger fan of monster movies.",1331510400,9,4786,4.802184466019417
