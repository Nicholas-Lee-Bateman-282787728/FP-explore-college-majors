5990546,5,B00FFKBAJU,"instant cult classic!  who knew they could still be made like this?  genuinely awesome--with so many film, cultural, and genre references you will want to watch it several times in order to make sure you caught all of the nuances. beautifully shot in black 'n white with cross-over colour sequences. perfectly ill-timed deadpan humor and over acted dramatic scenes. stunningly glamorous costumes and period sets, stylish without the cheap kitsch.  it will keep your senses suspended in a perpetual state of rapture. ..

I have been spontaneously converted to the fantastic cult of juan orol! does anyone know where I can find his films?",1412294400,2,636,5.086538461538462

5990548,5,B00FFKBAJU,"This film is brilliant. I laughed almost non-stop. I also learned a little about a lesser known star of the B movie, whose career spanned
the entire golden age of Mexican cinema. It seems a journalistic device to compare this work to Ed Wood by Tim Burton, as it gives us a conceptual hook on which to hang our ignorance of two national cinema histories. In reality Juan Orol was much more conventional and mainstream than the decidedly fringe Wood, as well as more prolific if for no other reason than longevity. For its multiple layers of humor I would compare El fantastico mundo de Juan Orol to Zelig by Woody Allen or Forgotten silver by Peter Jackson and Costa Botes. As a baby boomer who grew up in southern California during the (later) era depicted this movie brought back memories of a sort documented by Carlos Monsivais in his essay Las mitologias del cine mexicano.",1386806400,4,878,4.634615384615385

8615279,5,B00FFKBAJU,Thoroughly engaging & entertaining movie.  It was much better than expected.  I only wish the subtitles were larger or with more contrast.  Small black & white subtitles tend to get lost in the black & white picture.,1504396800,,216,4.783783783783784
8615280,5,B00FFKBAJU,There really isn't much to say until you have seen the movie. There is nothing else like it. A near perfect surrealistic biography of a surrealistic man.,1499472000,,153,4.703703703703703

8615284,5,B00FFKBAJU,A wonderful bio-drama about a legendary Hispanic filmmaker.  Follow his alter ego throughout his life from rise to fame til forgotten in history.  A great story.,1440633600,,161,5.153846153846154

8615286,4,B00FFKBAJU,I'm giving this a 4 just because I was entertained by this movie. It was subtitled in English and done all in black & white until the very end. I enjoyed the Latin musical sound track with songs by Perez Prado and others. There were many pretty women in the film. Over all it took a light hearted view of Jaun Oral's career in film.,1417219200,,332,4.123076923076923
