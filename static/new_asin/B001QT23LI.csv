8336206,1,B001QT23LI,"OK I'll cut straight to the chase. MEG has released a 2009 movie as 1.85 letterboxed in a 4:3 frame. To get the correct ratio you need to have black bars on all 4 sides (a really good use of your widescreen TV) or use the zoom function and frankly the quality of the transfer just ain't up to it. To use non anamorphic widescreen when this was released is inexcusable. To boot there are no subtitles.  The laughable thing is you have to sit or fast forward (can't skip to the menu) several MEG release previews. Going on the release of Big Bag of $ you're better off keeping your $ by avoiding MEG releases.
I give it 1 star.",1425081600,,625,4.1652892561983474
8336207,1,B001QT23LI,"A gang is transporting money to the boss. One of the gang members has other ideas for the loot and absconds with it. He winds up at the residence of Wade and Tina. In a struggle, our bagman is killed, leaving our couple with a bag of money. Wade is a struggling actor and Tina is an ex-stripper who was eager to return to her old job to help out. That in itself would have made for a good movie had they gone that route.

More gang members show up at their house for the money, only to meet the same fate. The police officer investigating the case, has his own financial problems and knows there is money somewhere. Lanre Idewu plays a body builder named Raymond (beefcake) who is apparently African. He speaks English as if he is Arnold Schwarzenegger attempting a Jamaican accent.

The movie is clearly low budget. CG flames shoot out of a pistol when it is fired. In one scene I couldn't tell if they had a painted backdrop of a town or just lousy film. Outside of Trisha Mann, the acting was very bad. Normally when things are this bad, I always jump on the script writer. My first impression was this was written as a comedy. The screen writer died and someone decided to make the script into a film not knowing it was supposed to be a comedy. Alas, that theory did not hold up as the director and writer are one in the same. Scott F. Evans owes me two dollars. Not worth viewing even for free.

F-bomb, no sex, no nudity. Token blood squirt.",1330128000,,1447,4.273722627737226
