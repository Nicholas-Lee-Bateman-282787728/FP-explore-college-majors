7810842,5,6301324358,"Being the eldest child of deaf parents living in the isolation of a rural community, I had an affinity with the children in this film. Like my world, there were only six cast members, which consisted of the parents, children, and grandparents. I like the children in the movie had no contact with others outside of this family group. I who could hear only communicated with others in sign language. In the hearing world of public education, I like the deaf son, became frustrated with the world around me.
*The film accurately portrays the prejudice the deaf experience. The deaf like those who do not speak English can do everything a hearing person can. The only difference is the way they communicate with others. Like the son in the movie, they are educable.
*Because of ignorance due to isolation in the alpine world, the pubescent energy of the two children led to an incestuous relationship with pregnancy at issue. Tragedy is the result and, in the dead of winter, we are left with the children alone in isolation with an uncertain future.
*The director has done an outstanding job with the telling of this story. I highly recommend this movie to everyone so they can better understand what the deaf world is like.",1225584000,,1222,4.741784037558685
7810843,5,6301324358,"Takes place in the beautiful Swiss Alps, an area sparsely populated and very isolated.
The son is called ""the boy"" by the family, he's deaf and mute, and struggling with the passions that afflict most teenagers, which sometimes leads him to throw tantrums and become uncontrolable.
The only one that understands him is his sister Belli, an aspiring school teacher. Belli teaches her brother how to read and write, and comforts him when he's angry. But their father will neither allow Belli to teach at the school in the village, nor will he allow the boy to attend school, he wants him to help on the farm.
Their parents are loving but insist that they stay on the farm. Telling them, there's nothing in the village for them, the simple life is better in their beautiful surroundings. The only other company they seem to have is their grandparents, who live on the mountain edge across from them.
One day the boy ruins an expensive piece of farm machinery in a fit, fearing his father he runs off to live on the mountain.
  Belli, knows where he is and brings him food. The churning emotions that seethe in such a close relationship, made even worse by each others loneliness, erupt. And the two become involved, yet the subject is handled in a manner that is NOT meant to offend. And if you are offended by such things I would suggest not seeing it.... because there's more.....
The film's ending is strange, yet mystical. In a note of tragedy but also leaving the impression that there is hope and potential....
Very good film.
This is one of my favorite films, and I hope that others will come to appreciate it.",1024617600,,1614,4.600694444444445
