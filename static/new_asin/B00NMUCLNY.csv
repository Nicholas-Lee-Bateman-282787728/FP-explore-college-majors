6673041,4,B00NMUCLNY,"** I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I could watch independent horror films all day if they were all made as well as CUT!.  Granted, many indie films look great, however even many of those lack the same heart and soul as this film.  CUT! is one of those flicks made by horror fans, for horror fans, which is a large part of what makes it so much fun.  And while its not perfect, its still a hell of a movie and worthy of your attention.

I went into this film knowing nothing about it, except for the excerpt from the press release I had received.  As a result, I had no expectations and could therefore review it with no bias.  I try to do this with every film I watch, however I usually know something about each title beforehand.  Going into this one with no prior knowledge helped make this an even more positive entertainment experience.

CUT! is a low-budget feature, but you cant tell just by looking at it.  The production team does a fantastic job of using the money they have, and the result is a solid-looking piece of cinema.  The sound is great, the lighting is tight, and the picture is a smooth HD image with great color.  The film looks like a high-budget picture, which goes a long way in the indie film world.

The acting is pretty good, with director David Rountree and actor David Banks portraying the main characters.  Both do a good job in their roles, and both are believable.  I was pleasantly surprised to see Gabrielle Stone in the film; I enjoyed her performance in ZOMBIE KILLERS: ELEPHANTS GRAVEYARD (click here to read my review of that one http://matthewscottbaker.com/blog/2015/02/movie-review-zombie-killers-elephants-graveyard-2015/), and she gives another solid performance here.  Likewise, screen vets Sam Scarber and Suze Lanier-Bramlett are always a pleasure to see onscreen, and they round out CUT!s cast.

The special effects in CUT! are a big winner.  The film focuses more on suspense and intensity, therefore we don't get to see a whole lot of carnage; but what we do get to see looks good.  Theres several scenes of bloodshed and a few bodies, and they all look great.  I particularly like the close-up we get when the killer removes a large knife from one of his victims.  It is a gruesome shot and looks very real.

My sole complaint about the film is how the storyline stumbles a bit in the middle.  We ultimately get a satisfying payoff at the end (and I love the twist), however the middle of the story is a little shaky.  A couple of things happen that made me raise my eyebrow in wonder, however they are minor and do not detract from the story that much.  Still, I do feel it worth mentioning.

But otherwise, CUT! is a major win for me.  I recommend this to any horror fan looking for an interesting take on the slasher-flick premise.  The film is available on DVD and VOD, so check it out today.",1424995200,5,2887,4.56420233463035

6673043,5,B00NMUCLNY,"Kudos to Director David Rountree on delivering a brilliantly directed and crafted thriller full of surprises! Co-written together by Rountree (Travis Simon) and David Banks (Lane Hayes), this is not your usual slasher horror film, but instead is more of a thinker-mystery type psychological thriller/horror who-done-it, with some comedic moments (yes, there's comedy), but don't let that sway your thinking that this isn't a serious thriller movie. And right when you think you've got it figured out, you realize you don't have anything figured out... CUT! is full of surprises, twists and turns, sure to feed your thrill-seeking soul clear up to the very end! .... or, is it the end? Great cast! Great directing! Brilliant script! You must definitely put CUT! on your watch list!",1424822400,,780,5.198412698412699

8679227,3,B00NMUCLNY,"Finally another movie that I'm actually excited to watch. I bought this from a mom and pop video shop in Portales, New Mexico named Landals Box Office. Shipped to Las Vegas, NV. As I write this review the movie currently holds a 4.5 star rating on Amazon with nine reviews. I'll be number 10.

When I cut open the package and popped it into my projection room in the back of Movies & Candy I was a bit giddy. 150 inches of pure serial killer. It started out very impressive and I liked what I saw. The movie chugs along at breakneck speed with a huge opening laugh and lots of fun little suprises. Movie geeks clearly love to fan out on the horror genre and these characters clearly know their stuff. Soul mates Lane and Trav the Director work in a prop studio and deal with B listers and bull s*** all day. They show us how you can loose your mind in Hollywood and start killing easy prey for cheap thrills. In a place where reality and fantasy are one. Instead of hack a Shaq, its hack a hooker at the Staples center. L.A. has the depth of a curb on Skid Row.

The movie does venture into familiar territory with the main protagonists being horror junkies but it still feels fresh. It does utilize some nice plot twists and learn as you go storyline that keeps you interested but not riveted. More on camera kills would have kept it from feeling like a bit of a drag the second half. But we get one beheading to make up for the amateur acting from the lead Lane Hayes (David Banks). A bit better performance was turned in by North Carolinian, David Rountree, who also directed the film and co-wrote it with his co-star.

It just seemed like it started taking itself to seriously and lost its steam and stopped having as much fun as the irreverent first half. The movie just felt like a bubble wrapped packaged prostitute that left my 101 minute session feeling kind of bored and unsatisfied.

I learned everybody wants to be an actor or director in the city of angels and everybody wants to be a critic on Amazon but this movie does not deserve a 4.5.",1430784000,,2053,4.338541666666667
8679228,5,B00NMUCLNY,David Banks took us to a new level of fear.  His kind face and tormented mind shows how evil can lurk behind the mildest masks.  Best not to watch this movie alone...,1429315200,,166,4.15625
8679229,3,B00NMUCLNY,"Travis Simon (David Rountree, writer, director, producer) introduces the film with a narration claiming ""This is not that kind of film."" Travis works in a warehouse that supplies film makers with cameras and equipment. Lane (David Banks writer ,producer) in on parole for beating up a prostitute, his favorite pastime. Lane works with Travis as we wonder why Travis tolerates Lane's erratic outbursts and behavior.

Travis gets an idea to make a film of their own where they scare people. He has a script. Lane wants to wing it by setting up cameras around the warehouse and film stuff that way. Travis goes along as Lane turns to killing and Travis  films it.

The film was okay while it tries to be different. It includes cameos by Suze Lanier-Bramlett (These Hills Have Eyes I and II)  and Gabrielle Stone (daughter of Dee Wallace), but nothing to write home about. You watch a film that basically is ""Faces of Death"" while it tells us ""Any idiot with a camera can be a film maker.""  Hmmm. David Rountree should have stayed behind the camera.

Nothing more than a rental. Soft 3 stars.

Guide: F-bomb, sex, brief rear nudity. Some blood, killing and violence. Nothing terribly graphic.",1425772800,3,1188,4.794117647058823
