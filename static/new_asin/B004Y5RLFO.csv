8447923,3,B004Y5RLFO,"This is an odd-ball black comedy about an actress/star of some hokey crime show who ends-up hiding out with her lunk-head brother in some dilapidated shack, which happens to contain their newly deceased mother buried in the basement. Along with suggestions of brother/sister incest, more bodies wide-up in the cellar. It's not really a horror movie, just really weird--although Julie Lebreton, as the sister, is pretty hot. The only reason why I'm writing this review is because if you are dying to have this movie, you can go the Amazon.ca (Canada) site and get it for $10 and not get ripped-off here.",1322784000,,602,4.911764705882353
