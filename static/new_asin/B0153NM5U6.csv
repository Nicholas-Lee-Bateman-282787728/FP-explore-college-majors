It's the same size of any other Blu-Ray, the same shape and thickness. It has the same box that snaps closed. Okay, now the movie:

I really enjoy this movie. A small budget documentary (or mockumentary) it may be, but I found it very entertaining and moving. It's about this film maker (Blake Freeman) who meets an older man (Leroy) who is barely making it financially, much to do with the fact that he buys a lot of junk from people who prey on the easily influenced, convincing them they must be concerned with alien mind probes, UFO landings, government black helicopters, crop circles, and other phenomenon. Although some of these things might be a real threat, the majority are hoaxes from insane individuals or con men. Blake decides to take Leroy around the country to try and convince him that these people are not on the up-and-up. He eventually learns that Leroy is in worse trouble than he expected and may lose his home.

This movie can't be found anywhere on the Internet anywhere close to this quality. Believe me, I've tried.",1486771200,2,1191,4.5607476635514015

7428656,4,B0153NM5U6,"You really believe the whole thing might be legit at least until the final scheme which is a bit over the top and far fetched. That said Leroy plays his role very well... understated and quiet; doesn't over sell his role (at least not too often). I may be wrong but you get the feeling that Blake was for the most part just being himself so he was never really acting in the sense that he was taking on a different persona;. Except for  few instances the dialogue seemed pretty natural not stiff or over rehearsed.. I'm guessing there was a lot pf room for improv given the style and story-line???
As a coupe of those charlatans are real dudes it makes me wonder how they felt about acting but basically doing the same acting they normally do in everyday life? Anything for a buck I'm sure. And I wonder if those were all ""real"" psychics who have now revealed their scams for the world to see (or a few Amazon customers anyhow).

Anyhow, a pretty interesting low budget venture. So if you enjoy odd, indie films in general you might give it a try. If you need Deniro and a Hollywood budget to hold your interest then stay away.

7428664,5,B0153NM5U6,"A very funny enjoyable ride!  Blake Edwards is a real cocky SOB.  You do not have to agree with everything he disagrees with and dismisses to enjoy this movie.  I too fell in love with Leroy.  It was heart warming to see the soft side of the arrogant Edwards care about Leroy's predicaments.  Seeing Leroy's art work was outstanding, and how that is just ignored in the larger ""Art Community"" is ridiculous!  Edwards again pokes fun at everything with his typical arrogance, and is even obscene.  It is a hysterical movie but borders on the offensive in a few spots making it racy and controversial.  I still loved it just the same.  ""Tuesdays With Morrie"" can move over because  Edwards did a stellar job here with this film.  I am sorry to say they did not land on planet 'Sanity'.  When Blake Edwards did a Tom Cruise ""Mission Impossible"" imitation of hanging over a red painting to squirt blue paint from well ... just take a guess where; an extra appendage was used - UGH!.

7428684,5,B0153NM5U6,"First, let me share the conflicting emotion I have about this video.

Essentially this is about a man (Blake) looking for a movie that will earn him some money and get him started on his movie making endeavors. When who should come knocking but the pizza delivery guy with his fear of and belief in everything alien and weird. So they begin together to explore these 'things'.

What I didn't like was that Blake Freeman started this with no clue how it would end and little if any thought of what kind of impact he might be having on LeRoy. In fact, it wasn't until the middle of the show, at a minimum, that he really started to be a friend to LeRoy. Blake simply had the belief that by fighting LeRoy's belief system he would be making LeRoy's life better. And in the end, he had to do more to help LeRoy. And may I say that while I enjoyed the ending and thought it was hilarious, it was a bit chancy and a leaned towards the same fraud he was fighting in the first place.

With my conflicting thoughts though, I will say that I loved this show. I laughed out loud at some parts and while I'd love to share some of those parts, this is really one of those see it to believe kind of shows. I loved that Blake was so creative in ways that he was able to show LeRoy the fraud that men and women perpetuate on people in order to make money. (Pet mind reading is just one example!)

And despite my conflicting emotions, the ending was the BEST part and made me laugh and laugh.

I think Blake Freeman will have a future if he chooses to continue to make documentaries like this. I'd love to hear more about what happened to LeRoy as well.",1439251200,6,1636,4.197452229299363
7428685,2,B0153NM5U6,Terrible movie made by a trust fund baby.,1438819200,,41,4.25
7428686,5,B0153NM5U6,"i simply loved this film. I went into it not knowing the description at all,. I don't recall having seen any preview of it, and nothing in theatres.  But once in, I was immediately drawn to Blake's mild manner and his subject, LeRoy...well that gentleman was transformed by making and starring in this film.  I didn't expect the scope of the story, and was surprised to see how intense and yet entertaining it was from the start. I won't give the ending away, but let me just say Blake Freeman will be someone to watch for future enlightening films.  I hope some of the folks who bought the product, based on how informed and snooty they were, are sufficiently educated for now.  I am certain they would watch with dropped jaws at the spoof of them all being desperate to own the art created in 60 minute increments...gotcha! LeRoy is a grand old gent who caught Blake's attention when he delivered an order of take out food; and it was that slight, chancy encounter that turned that man's life around. I applaud Blake's kindness and affinity for helping others, he took very good care of LeRoy, while at the same time unburdening him from the threat of foreclosure and homelessness.
This was a great mixture of people, some nuttier than granola, but still impressive for their contributions  to the filming process.  Don Ray was a hoot, and I am left thinking that he had to be a plant, but a little internet searching disproved that idea. Still, he and the ""OBAMA"" fan were neck and neck for nut job of the year.  I loved the crop circle, and the clearly stated message, I laughed so hard I almost....well....never mind.
For the brief length of this film, I was charmed, so to speak.  And I didn't require someone to read my poop to uncover my hidden potential.  Insanity is present in this film, but not where you would expect it to be.  Charming, enlightening and heartwarming.  I loved it!",1438473600,8,1894,4.57396449704142
7428687,5,B0153NM5U6,"Aight, couple things we have to go through right off the bat: Blake and Jackass' Tremaine and Jonze must collaborate their material in the future. The way in which Freeman and Leroy approach societal deceptors which include alien experts, psychics, and even ghost hunters, rips me up HARD.  Totally on point, LeRoy kept an open mind and developed a fraternal trust to a perfect stranger that just so happened to be a director. It makes me believe in humanity and at the same time brings me disbelief. Misinformation and lack of evidence is much like a quote I heard from an unlikely comedy film, Dogma, from Chris Rock He said that faith is like a glass of water. When you're young, the glass is small, and it's easy to fill up. But the older you get, the bigger the glass gets, and the same amount of liquid doesn't fill it anymore. Periodically, the glass has to be refilled. Casted as an angel from heaven, Chris Rock also mentioned ideas can be changed, but that beliefs anchors one to certain points and limits growth. The more Freeman explored the pangs that enveloped LeRoy, the more it began to remind me of quicksand. It seemed that the more LeRoy tried to fight against so-called aliens in the past, the more his life began to crumble and sink to rock bottom. Blake was charismatic and proved that outlets like these that are planted in American culture, are meant to control people. Chains freed, I saw LeRoy blossom and to my chagrin, he was an artist all this time, which totally made my day. I digress, and I will say, I will never look at a documentary the same way again and I mean that based on the clarification of the film.-",1438387200,3,1643,4.5134228187919465

7428708,5,B0153NM5U6,"A movie that can make our immature sides laugh, and interest our intellectual sides. A comedy that slaps many strange beliefs in the face while it is warming your heart with how much Blake cares for the old man. Definitely worth watching.",1388620800,5,238,4.690476190476191
8732568,1,B0153NM5U6,"Seems like the main guy has had the editing make him look like a ""genuine great guy"" while purposely choosing certified weirdos to make the spiritual world look like a bust. Further adding to mans fall in self realization and awakening. Congrats, your ego is on par with your intellect.",1532736000,,286,4.74
8732569,5,B0153NM5U6,"Fantastic film with heart. Some don't like it because Blake Freeman seems arrogant. Immerse yourself in the world of frauds, charletons, and kooks and try to stay humble and forgiving. Some people deserve to be derided and Freeman is just the guy to do it.",1528070400,,256,4.711111111111111

8732571,5,B0153NM5U6,"One of the best, feel good movies I have seen in a long time. I loved the way Blake made all the charlatans look as stupid as they are. The crop circle expert was especially funny. Two big thumbs up.....",1526428800,,203,4.1
8732572,5,B0153NM5U6,"This was so unexpected! It's quirky, funny, heartfelt, sad, happy, stupid, gross, it just goes on. I honestly didn't know if some of this was real or scripted because it was so funny. The two ufo experts that hate each other arguing are to die for! I have to watch this again because it actually has an amazing human story in it. The way that Leroy is transformed is amazing. It was also very emotional watching Blake deal with how the movie impacted Leroy. Just so far from what I thought it would be. It starts a tad slow. Stick with it. It's a fun ride.",1507161600,,556,4.254716981132075

8732577,5,B0153NM5U6,"Full disclosure:  someone I used to know is featured in this movie.

I bought this DVD just to learn what I could about the person I know in it. My husband and I watched it, and were fascinated.  Blake Freeman comes across as a very kind man.  He's also brave enough to ask ""innocent"" questions, like:
""So you believe aliens are coming from light years away just to probe your butt?""  straight to the face of people. However, when he finds out taking away someone's illusions turns out to be devastating to the person, he has a very interesting and generous reaction.  Definitely worth a watch.",1494374400,,594,4.556603773584905
