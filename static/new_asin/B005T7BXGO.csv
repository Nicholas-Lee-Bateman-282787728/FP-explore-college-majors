4888265,4,B005T7BXGO,"An early war film that covers the experience of a Wellington crew that has to bail out over occupied Dutch territory and how they attempt to get back to England. Strong story and acceptable acting. Not an action flick, but worth watching.",1372377600,2,238,4.690476190476191
4888266,5,B005T7BXGO,"Can a black and white movie with no background music be any good? Try this one out. It's a gripping story. Definitely a period piece, but a well told story should speak for itself without the need for any special glitter.",1369785600,9,221,4.414634146341464
4888267,5,B005T7BXGO,"I like movies that were filmed before the war was over. You see a sober, more realistic perspective. Wonderful story of the brilliance and bravery of the Dutch Underground.",1369180800,4,172,4.9655172413793105
4888268,2,B005T7BXGO,"I know the era in which this movie was made but still, it's silly to an unreasonable degree. People who are trying to escape German held territory don't have the luxury of going to church then sitting around a table, wearing what looked like taylormade suits, in a rich mans house making merry. If the film was suppose to be a comedy (it wasn't) it missed the mark there as well. The film didn't need to be dark and foreboding but a little more realism was called for. Had resistance cells actually acted this way NO ONE would have escaped and the resistance would have been slaughtered.",1363132800,,587,4.4953271028037385
4888269,5,B005T7BXGO,"Very simple, but exactly the way it was. Made very well. The film was not in the best of shape, but the content was so very good. The acting was also quite simple, but that's how it was in 1942. Watching this film makes you wonder how really tough things were then and then you realize that's the way it was, plain and simple. Watch this movie. You will enjoy it. BTW, another great movie to watch from the same era, but much better is "" A WING AND A PRAYER"" starring Don Ameche . Now this is a super movie which I have watched so many times I have lost count. I just love this movie and you will too.",1361404800,4,601,3.975206611570248

4888279,5,B005T7BXGO,"It is impossible to choose a favorite Powell-Pressburger Film.  This is a perfect ensemble drama of some famous men (fictional of course) and not famous men from all walks of life assigned to a British bomber in WWII.  This is an adventure film made to honor the Dutch underground patriots who in real life helped a downed crew escape the Nazis in occupied Netherlands.  I recommend repeated viewings simply to understand their accents, the venacular of that time, and the witty and deep writing of Emeric Pressburger.  And the skilled, but quite natural performances of this stellar cast of top English actors.  Michael Powell's magic touch guides the whole enterprise, but as always, the director remains invisible letting the viewer sink into a world where good men triumph over evil! What a grand movie this is!",1472342400,,815,4.963235294117647

4888282,4,B005T7BXGO,"I think you need to like old movies.  The British was hard to understand at times, but the film was enjoyable anyhow.  I'm a pilot and it gave some interesting insight into how things were done by England during WWII.  Even non-pilots would find this interesting, I imagine.  Besides that the plot follows actual events and was also very interesting.

4888287,4,B005T7BXGO,"I can handle the old special effects, no problem.  What I liked most was the way the courage of resistance fighters was shown.  Even though this was a fictitious movie (I think), it was quite accurate in that sense, and also very early in the war.  It would be later documented that many individuals took great risk to fight the Germans as unarmed civilians.",1465257600,,358,4.5625
4888288,5,B005T7BXGO,"Gave it five stars due to its historical significance. The plot is a bit thin by current standards, but considering that this was made in wartime Britain without specific knowledge of the workings of the Dutch Underground (or risking giving anything away that was known), it was a morale-building story that honored the resistance efforts of the brave civilians under the thumb of their German occupiers.",1464134400,2,404,5.136363636363637

Certainly not a film that will interest many today, perhaps, but it gives us one more dramatically, and evocative views into the struggles and sacrifices made  by so many which led  final victory.

4888307,3,B005T7BXGO,"RAF aircraft crashes over Holland and the story develops as the Dutch aid the crew in getting back to England.  This Michael Powell/Emeric Pressburger 1942 gave the public insights into the challenges faced by RAF crews shot down in missions over the Netherlands.  The film's story was appealing to a viewing public concerned about fathers, brothers and sons serving in the armed forces.  Among the more interesting parts is the ""dance"" that the crew and the Dutch do to determine whether the others can be trusted.  As the Dutch resistance aid the men, very challenges are faced and overcome with ingenuity.

The Dutch are depicted as generous in supplying food but one has to wonder if there were actually food shortages during the occupation.  Surely they shared food with rescued teams but I suspect that they were not offered the kind of bounty depicted in the film.

Emeric Pressburger was the screenwriter and is noted for his collaboration with Michael Powell.  Their collaborative efforts is known as The Archers.  In addition to writing Pressburger, a Hungarian Jew who fled the continent to avoid capture by the Nazis, also handled many responsibilities that a producer would have handled and helped in editing and the selection of the score.  Perhaps the best known collaboration of Powell and Pressburger was the 19th Parallel (141) for which they received an Academy Award.  The 49th Parallel (released in the U. S. as The Invaders) was the story of a  WW2 U-boat crew stranded in northern Canada. To avoid internment, they must make their way to the border and get into the still-neutral USA.

Both One of Our Aircraft Is Missing and 49th Parallel are essentially propaganda pieces while providing stories that would please the public.  Aircraft is an interesting piece but today's viewer can't really feel the danger of the risks faced by the crew or the Resistance.",1433808000,,1882,4.9712460063897765

4888313,4,B005T7BXGO,"This movie should have been renamed to honor the members of the Dutch Resistence. Yes, the British crew was brave, but the people of Holland paid with blood every time they helped downed crews. It was not uncommon for the Germans to round up ten or more people in a town or village and execute them if there had been any support shown the Allied crews. Many innocent people died this way and were never recognized for their patriotism and bravery.",1429401600,,447,4.530864197530864

4888319,3,B005T7BXGO,"I am not sure why this film is reviewed as being outstanding. I thought it was forced, poorly acted and the dialog sounded like it was from a school play. It was way over dramatized. And s-l-o-w. The story wasn't very interesting, was entirely predictable and pretty much unbelievable. There were several plot elements that were introduced and then went nowhere. (The Dutch collaborator with the gramophone records that turned out to be all recordings of the Dutch national anthem.) In other words, it was a propaganda film, based on a fantasy. Perhaps this what they had to do to keep aircrew flying over Germany and maintain popular support for the doctrine of night time bombing.

That the women were dancing around in their evening dresses, that they seemed to have unlimited food (although the Germans drank their wine, which is believable), that the flyers' uniforms never got wrinkled and/or noticed and the Dutch went around making speeches made it even more unbelievable. The flyers went around introducing themselves to every Dutch citizen they met, including children; it is highly unlikely all those people could keep a secret that completely and that long. The Germans here are portrayed as, basically, horny, drunken idiots that could be deceived at will. There was, essentially, no enemy in this film.

The lack of soundtrack was interesting. And, surprisingly, I didn't miss the music. Given the way they made the movie, they probably would have made the soundtrack maudlin with lots of bad music meant to convey tension.

BTW, if aircrew was shot down over the continent and exfiltrated by the underground, they didn't let them go back to flying over enemy territory. If they were captured, they could be forced to give up the underground's operations and members. In this case, that would have been about half the population of Holland.",1415750400,,1854,5.012987012987013
4888320,4,B005T7BXGO,"Very evocative film.  A great tribute to the brave Dutch people who sacrificed so much to rescue RAF airmen.  I watched it with a Dutch friend.

A very interesting story about some pilots who had to be hidden after their plane crashed until they could get back to their ranks. It is informational as well. The acting is good. I hesitated in buying this, because I had heard nothing about it from anyone I know, but it will stay in my library, and I plan to watch it again in the near future, but then I have problem with B & W's.

As he story unfolds, we see them seek their way back to England with the invaluable help of the Dutch Resistance, who are at first skeptical. Is this a Nazi trick or a genuine incident? The townspeople cooperate in many ways in their efforts to protect the crew. The acting and direction is first rate.

There is a strong thread of patriotism that runs through the film, but because it is integral to the story there is no need for self-conscious tinges of melodrama and histrionics. Indeed, the film is punctuated with lighthearted touches. Very highly recommended.",1391212800,,684,4.796610169491525

The movie is surprisingly well done although it starts off sort of slow. I would recommend as a family movie.",1381017600,,428,4.644736842105263
4888339,5,B005T7BXGO,"I streamed this film on Amazon instant video.

There's no music, the story is straightforward, the special effects are simple, but, this film is written and directed by film legends Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. It is photographed by the great cinematographer Ronald Neame. (If you're unfamiliar with these names, look them up on IMDB!) It even features Peter Ustinov in his feature film debut.

Except for one crewmember of the B for Bertie plane, the crew only speaks English and there are no subtitles for the German and Dutch spoken in this film, so we understand no more than the crew attempting their escape. It's a very effective plot device.

In case you're thinking this is some B picture, it's not. It was nominated for two Academy Awards and won National Board of Review 10 Best films of the year. When you watch this film, be sure to note the film editor: It's David Lean. It even features choreographer and dancer Robert Helpmann in a small role as a Nazi sympathizer. I mention all of the above to explain that it should be no surprise this film is a gem. The print and sound are excellent and the sound is very good - just be prepared to not understand some of the dialog which is the way it's intended to be.

Googie Withers as Jo de Vries delivers what must be one of the all time great lines in a resistance film, when she says while British planes are dropping bombs overhead, ""That's what you're doing for us. Can you hear them running for shelter? Can you understand what that means to all the occupied countries? To enslaved people, having it drummed into their ears that the Germans are masters of the Earth? Seeing those masters running for shelter. Seeing them crouching under tables. And hearing that steady hum night after night. That noise which is oil for the burning fire in our hearts.""

8485956,5,B005T7BXGO,"Anyone who writes a negative review for this film -- other than for poor streaming or something -- just doesn't get it. This is a war propaganda film. That's what it's supposed to be and what it is, but above and beyond that (which is a lot) it's a good movie, beautifully filmed, well acted, masterfully edited WITH a sense of humor. Here's a very young Peter Ustinov; here's David Lean editing the movie.",1481155200,,406,4.5
8485957,5,B005T7BXGO,"I love this classic WWII film! It is packed full of action, surprises, and emotion  especially from the Dutch people who were so supportive of the Allies during the war!

Good performances by Eric Portman, Godfrey Tearle and Pamela Brown make this film timeless!

I highly recommend this film. Its a great watch! And if you are considering purchasing a copy, Remember When Classic Movies has the best dvd version of this film out there! A really memorable WWII epic  timeless!",1475539200,,476,4.839506172839506
