5889245,5,B00E3V9UKI,"""Deadwood,"" ""Boss,"" ""The Borgias,""  and now ""Magic City"" make up my list of favorite dramatic shows of mine that were all ended prematurely.  At least the producers of ""Breaking Bad,"" and ""Six Feet Under"" knew ahead of time how long their shows would run so that the audience was left with a satisfying ending.  On the other hand, as evidenced by the unpopular final episodes of ""The Sopranos"" and ""Dexter,"" knowing that a particular season will be the last one may not always be a good thing.  Let's just hope that we get a decent conclusion for ""Sons of Anarchy"" next season and whenever the powers that be decided that ""Mad Men"" has run its course.",1383955200,2,651,4.586206896551724
5889246,5,B00E3V9UKI,"When I watch a time period-specific movie or a TV series, I pay close attention to the production design, hoping that I would make me feel that I was there. Set in the Miami of the late fifties, ""Magic City"" certainly made me feel that way - its attention to detail is just fascinating as the story itself. Having reviewed the first season of this classy and intriguing series, I anxiously waited for the second one. And, for my bucks, the ""Magic Season - The Second complete Season"" did not disappoint - it is first class entertainment.

The second season Blu-ray edition includes 3 discs, the first two featuring eight episodes and the third one loaded with special features. It opens with ""Crimes and Punishment,"" where we find Ike Evans (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), the series' main character, in prison, accused of murder, with Judi Silver (Elena Satine), a prostitute, as the main witness. However, Ike is able to get bail, and is also fortunate to keep his beloved Miramar Playa Hotel. ""Angel of Death,"" the second episode, introduces us to a new character: Sy Berman (the always dependable James Caan), a respected Chicago Outfit mobster, who arrives to Miami to visit Ben Diamond (Danny Huston, who shines in his role), the local mobster king. When asked by Sy if he is happy, Ben responds, ""Happy? F-----g Howdy Doody is happy. I'm content."" At the end of the episode, Ike is traveling to Cuba, to expand his empire. In the following episodes, we'll keep witnessing Ben's sexual fantasies with his wife (Jessica Marais); Ike's deals with the Cuban government;  Jack Klein (Matt Ross), Miami's District Attorney, restless harassment of Ike Evans; Ike's son, Stevie (Steven Strait) rising up in the power structure, but not in a good way; Ben putting pressure on Miami politicians to pass the law that would allow gambling in Miami, and Ike and Meg Bannock (Kelly Lynch) fight against it; and much more. The last episode of the season, and the best, I think, feels like ""The Godfather,"" with all the pieces falling into place, and in which only the best will survive, with Ike always trying to save and keep his hotel, with the support of his beautiful wife Vera (Olga Kurylenko). In addition to Caan, the second season also features Esai Morales and Sherilyn Fenn. I specially enjoyed the use of the track ""Fever,"" with the voice of legendary Cuban singer La Lupe.

As I mentioned in the review for the first season, ""Magic City"" ""has class and elegance in everything - the sex, the ambiance, the colors, the nudity... hell, even the violence. It has style and it has substance - great production design and photography --, and it feels like noir at times."" The exciting second season follows the same path, and I can't wait for the next one. The special features include the documentaries ""The gamble for Havana,"" ""The Criminal Element,"" ""Magic City Style,"" and more. (USA, 2013, color, 411 min)

5889247,5,B00E3V9UKI,"I watched both seasons and I thought it was an awesome show.

 It had a lot of potential, but unfortunately it was cut down in it's prime. To me, the casting and acting was very well done. The settings, music, clothes, and cars were great. Everything was very authentic. The show really gave you a look at what life was like in those times as far as clothing, culture, cars, etc go. The story was rich and multifaceted and could have taken several of the main characters in different directions. Season two sort of served as the fork in the road or turning point for a lot of characters and you could definitely see it all unfolding. However, at the end, you are left hanging big time with no resolution because that was all supposed to be season three! (which is ok as long as you actually get the next season). It was unfortunate that the cancellation news broke after all the filming had wrapped up so there really wasn't a chance for the show to go out in a blaze of glory and tie up all the loose ends. Instead you are left with a tremendous feeling of I can't wait to see what happens in season three. A season that will never come......

I am definitely sad to see magic city go and I wish the show would be saved, but I guess the numbers just weren't there. I don't think the show got the recognition it deserved. It had the makings of a really great show and I was really looking forward to enjoying seasons of it for a years to come.

The soundtrack and musical score on itunes are also pretty good stuff.

I highly recommend watching season 1 & 2. It is a good show and I think you will definitely appreciate all it had to offer and maybe even wish for more magic city yourself !",1382832000,9,1690,4.236024844720497

5889315,5,B00E3V9UKI,"Magic City is one of those series that really sticks to you if you fit into any one of the many reasons that might attract you to that kind of show.

Created by Mitch Glazer who is also one of the principle producers it stars Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Olga Kurylenko, Steven Strait and Jessica Marais, in the main roles. Produced for the Starz network Magic City originally ran from March 30, 2012 and finished up two seasons on August 9, 2013. It was not renewed for a third season. Currently it can be viewed on Netflix.

If you have any connection to Jewish or American Jewish life, Cuban or Cuban American life, and have any interest at all in stories about organized crime in the free world, or just enjoy anything salacious, violence, sex, steamy romance, intrigue, suspense, then you should watch Magic City. In other words, just about anyone will like this drama.

The show takes place in 1959 Miami, the Kennedys, the 59 Dodgers, hula hoops, great big Cadillacs with shark fins in the back and Ed Sullivan on Sunday nights, all come together at The Miramar Playa, a fictitious but very authentic first class Hotel on the Miami strand.

The set production was excellent. The dcor, the costumes were perfect for the time. As someone who was a very little boy in 1959 it took me back. The way men dressed with their tight pants and outer jac-shirts. Zippo lighters never seemed to be far away from a pack of cigarettes. And, of course, everyone smoked. Doctors were starting to warn about the health effects of smoking but It wasn't until 1966 when the Surgeon General became serious and placed warning labels on packs of cigarettes.

Jewish organized crime, hardly ever romanticized in favor of the Italians which were more demonstrative in 20th century Americana, plays a central role in this series as they live up to every underworld stereotype, from degenerate sex to the worst kinds of human sadistic behavior. Apparently, they ran Miami during the post World War II years, probably led by Meyer Lansky although his name is never mentioned. Rather, James Caan, in a supporting role plays Sy Berman, the Lansky type character in the story.

Shamefully, there is a part of me that is proud of Jewish gangsterism. Probably no different than being proud of Jewish sports heroes, Benny Leonard, Hank Greenberg, Sandy Koufax, etc. Not sure why that is. Maybe because they broke the mold of the stereotype bookish Jew, physically weak, and not able to stand up for himself.  But, Jewish gangsters prove that definition wrong. Maybe that is what I am proud of. Of course, those are stereotypes and do not reveal reality and have at any rate become null and void since the State of Israel showed that Jews could fight as well as anyone.

In the 1930s a group of New York Jewish wise guys once broke up an American Nazi party meeting. They ran into the hall and just started beating every one up. Jews beating up Nazis, how cool is that? But then afterward they probably went out and tortured to death one of their street enemies, something none of us could ever sanction. So its a strange kind of kinship the rest of us have with that element.

As a Zionist Jew I can never forget what American Jewish crime did for the Jews in 1948. Because of an international ban on weapons imposed by the Truman administration, the proposed Jewish State in Palestine was left to its own devices to secure proper weapons to fight the war with the Arabs everyone knew was coming.

American Jewish crime was one of several important sources that secured the kinds of weapons which enabled Israels fledgling armed forces to barely survive the first month of their War of Independence. It is quite possible that the Jews could have done it without that segment of American  Jewish society nevertheless the  contribution in history has always been appreciated by people like me.

One of my favorite sayings attributed to Albert Schweitzer really applies to these types of situations. You don't have to be an angel to be a saint.

But I digress.

Mitch Glazer, the producer grew up in Miami Beach, in and around hotels during that time period, so his experiences of being told stories and listening to staff and family tell him lurid tales of crime and how crime don't pay (for anything) became the basis for this series.

With character names like Ben Diamond, Judi Silver and Belvan Jaffe, living the low life in Miami Beach, they were gangsters and bad people but they were part of the Jewish family just the same. Like my own mother and father most of that generation were born from immigrant parents so the Yiddish expressions are common, the cultural ties of common background, heritage, and history bound that community together.

Its no different than the Italian or Irish or any other immigrant community in the American experience. These just happen to be Jewsgangster Jews. Criminal gangs have historically bonded over cultural similarities, and the Jewish crime, whether in Miami, Chicago or L.A. did the same.  Make no mistake, these are bad people, they did bad things but they make for exciting television.

Along with the magnificent set direction, wardrobe and meticulous detail of the period, the show does take on a realism. You think you are looking at 1959. With that prop expertly devised all Glazer had to do was to tell his story.

The show also tells of a symbiotic closeness between the anti-Castro Cubans who took asylum in Miami after the revolution and that errant Jewish gangster community. Castro took over Cuba in 1959 and along with his hatchet man Che Guevara instituted a reign of terror in which they jailed and executed Cuban nationals. Many innocent people, sometimes whole families were murdered just because they were rich and had some kind of connection to the Batista regime.

On all levels those relationships between Jews and Cubans seem to work in Magic City, love, war, honesty, fidelity, it all comes together for the two communities going through life on two similar but parallel life lines never crossing, never descending into tension.  Almost like there is an understanding on the oppressive nature withstood by both groups to both groups. Im not sure if Miami history was that smooth between Cubans and Jews, but even if it wasnt, Glazer made it work for him and his story.

Unfortunately, for me, because I really liked it, the show was cancelled after two seasons. There is hope however. Netflix, has on occasion bought the rights to certain series that were left cliff hanging and consequently many disappointed fans. After purchasing the rights to the three seasons of The Killing from AMC, Netflix produced a season four to tie up all the loose ends. Not ideal but at least it was something. They produced 15 episodes of Arrested Development six years after Fox cancelled it, giving the loyal fans of the show something more that was perceived to be lost.

But, the point is that they could conceivably continue the series if they felt they could get enough of an audience. Whether the show has that or not I don't know.

But, at least we have those two seasons. If you fit into one of the categories I explained at the beginning you will probably like Magic City.

Wishes someone else picked it up as reports first speculated. Still, its definitely worth watching both seasons, they wrapped a lot up neatly...but still so much more was left to do!

Think 1959-1960 Sopranos transplanted from New Jersey to Miami Beach. A highly recommended 2 season series; I dare you to not binge watch it.",1415923200,,424,5.159420289855072

5889378,4,B00E3V9UKI,"This season had some unexpected twists and turns, so I hate that the show got cancelled. We'll now have to use our imaginations to explore how the storyline might have played out. SPOILER ALERT: I was intrigued by Danny and Judi Silver's budding relationship, and I wanted to see how Ike was going to handle his frisky sister-in-law (or former sister-in-law depending on how you look at it). What I didn't want to see was Ike's wife, Vera, fall into bed with Stevie. I just think the whole sleeping with your step-son thing is low and gross. Other than that, I thought the story was getting more interesting overall, and I was becoming more invested in the characters.

5889383,4,B00E3V9UKI,"This series has a beauty and style to it that really brings it alive, and with a stellar cast you truly have 'magic' here. I've heard that Starz has cancelled the series so I can't fully recommend this since it seems to be building towards something bigger in an imagined season 3. One can only hope that there will be some sort of closure in the future - whether that means a movie to complete it, or by some luck only the dreamland of 60's Miami cool could create - that it would get picked up by Netflix or Amazon for more seasons.",1389744000,4,534,4.194174757281553

5889391,2,B00E3V9UKI,I ordered this dvd and put it in to my machine and it wouldn't move past the warning screen. So I phoned amazon and they sent me a return slip. I sent it back and they sent me a new one the next day. We put that one in and the same thing happened. So I sent it back and got a refund.

5889393,5,B00E3V9UKI,"I don't like this show as much as my favorites, Mad Men and the Walking Dead, but I think it deserved more than 2 seasons.  It's one of those shows that has a very loyal but small fan base.  The end of the season brings enough closure to make me feel satisfied but left just enough open so there was room to move on if Starz decided to let them put out another season.  The case for the DVDs if well crafted and if you already own the 1st season you should know what to expect.  I did feel like the Special Features were lacking.  Knowing that it was probably going to be the last season when they released the DVDs it would've been nice to have some of the actors and crew reflections on the show.  There was a little bit of that but not in a 'well, it was great while it lasted and this is what it meant to me' kind of way.",1387324800,2,825,3.9397590361445785

Very absorbing plot lines, concerning crime, politics, and family relationships, as well as interesting, well acted characters. I particularly enjoyed some of the ancillary characters including Elena Satine, as a hooker and Jessica Marais as the tormented wife of arch gangster Ben Diamond. Michael Rispoli and James Cenatiempo were also notable as henchmen for the main characters, Ben Diamond and Ike Evans.
This is a series that I did not want to end-unfortunately it has ended after only two seasons. If Starz had promoted it better it would have been a run away hit. I hope they reconsider-it really is that good.",1386720000,13,710,4.916666666666667
