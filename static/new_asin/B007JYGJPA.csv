8518529,2,B007JYGJPA,"This film is being recycled through Redbox as a 2014 film ""Fields of the Dead.""  A group of college kids working on a ""Thesis Project"" camp out on some haunted land. They find a book as one in the party become a possessed killer with a slight twist that didn't make any sense nor did the diary and its connection to anything. They tried to cram too much into the background.

What was good was the characters and the occasional campy dialog. In the beginning I had to laugh at the song lyrics...""Baby I wrote this song for you, F***ya, just you."" It was fairy lame, but the girl considered it sweet that he wrote a song for her.

The film also had a funny pot scene. At some point the dialog hit a rut and the rest of the film didn't have enough punch to carry it through. Too many slow scenes.
