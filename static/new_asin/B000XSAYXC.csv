8229337,3,B000XSAYXC,"Okay, I have to revise my former statement that if Robert Fuller is in it, I love it.  He's not in this one enough to raise it from mediocre to good.  At least he gets to play a bad guy for a change.  I haven't watched the other movie, and probably never will. On a side note, if you're going to sell a $1.00 movie purchased from Family Dollar, don't have the gall to not mask the original price and charge 400% more for it.",1497398400,,424,3.9647058823529413
8229338,4,B000XSAYXC,"FIND A PLACE TO DIE

Released in 1968-69, but not in the USA until 1971, Find a Place to Die is a Spaghetti Western starring Jeffrey Hunter as a dishonored ex-officer drinking his woes away in Mexico when a beautiful woman (Pascale Petit) hires him and several others to save her husband and their gold mine claim from a band of local bandits.  Daniela Giordano is on hand as the beautiful Juanita at the cantina.

The plot is obviously borrowed (or, more accurately, ripped off) from 1954s Garden of Evil and combines it with a pensive Spaghetti Western flavor, lacking the goofiness and moral hollowness of, say, 1966s The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. The melancholy is heightened by a moving song Juanita sings at the cantina in the first act; the tune is reminiscent of Jerry Goldsmiths excellent acoustic piece for 1970s Rio Lobo. Too bad Giordano (as Juanita) didn't have a bigger role, but its big enough.

There are several other things that propel Find a Place to Die above most Italo oaters: The group Lisa (Petit) compiles consists of a few interesting people, including an ex-con turned minister who seems to be sincere but is dubious at the same time. Secondly, their ordeal becomes almost a survival situation and I favor survival flicks. Thirdly, the story arc of the disgraced ex-Confederate (Hunter) is almost inspiring. Lisa says shes naturally drawn to him because she knows hes not like the other worthless cutthroats. The warmth of love slowly wakens the laconic loner out of his brooding stupor and draws the best in him out. Love is power and, when you find it, you need to plug into it if you want to live. Only a fool rejects it or, worse, abuses it. Lastly, being shot in Italy at some kind of ancient ruins, particularly the notable building of the cantina, the movie has a unique look for a Pasta Western, which of course were typically shot in Spain.

The movie is lean at 89 minutes.

THE GATLING GUN

""The Gatling Gun"" was shot in 1969, but not released in the USA till 1971. It's a cavalry vs. Indians Western focusing on the eponymous weapon with a great cast of familiars -- Guy Stockwell, Robert Fuller, Phil Harris, Woody Strode, Patrick Wayne, John Carradine, Pat Buttram and BarBara Luna (from Star Trek's ""Mirror, Mirror"") -- highlighted by curvy redhead Judy Jordan, to say the least.

Critics write it off as ""routine"" and, yes, it is grade-B and comic-booky, but everything clicks and the movie delivers the goods. It's essentially a survival tale of a small group of soldiers and civilians who team-up to survive a desert trek threatened by Two-Knives (Carlos Rivas) and his rogue tribe. If you're a sucker for desert-survival tales (like me), such as ""Sands of the Kalahari,"" ""Flight of the Phoenix,"" ""Escape from Zahrain"" and ""They Came to Cordura,"" you'll probably appreciate ""The Gatling Gun."" It's not as good as the first three, but it's more entertaining than the last one.

The trek through the desert features a lot of drama but the movie ends with a bang as the group squares-off against Two-Knives and his gang. Stockwell stands out as the alpha male Army Lieutenant who naturally attracts the babe, whereas Fuller is effective as Private Sneed, done-in by his own lust for filthy lucre.

The film runs 93 minutes and was shot at Eaves Movie Ranch and Ghost Ranch near Sante Fe, New Mexico.
