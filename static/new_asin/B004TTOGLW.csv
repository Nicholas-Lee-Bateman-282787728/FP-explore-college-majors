8440869,5,B004TTOGLW,"This film is an exceptional introduction to one of our most intelligent, accomplished and articulate contemporary ceramic artists. Bill Daley, Approaching 90, Bill taught for many decades at Philadelphia's University of the Arts, where, to his credit, his students never made work that looked like their teacher's. There would have been no reason for that to happen, because Daley relentlessly invited his students to find their own way, and as he explains in the film, he never wants to repeat himself exactly in his work, no matter how ""successful"" prior pieces have been. He needs to be on the threshold of discovery in each unique clay pot he makes.
This film was made in BD's small studio in suburban Philadelphia and we see him putting together one of his complex pieces, using methods he has devised over many years; it's like watching jazz composed in 3-D and all the while being described in simple language by this original genius.
This should be in every serious ceramic studio's library, since it is as much about insight and wisdom as about the physical process of building a unique sculptural vessel.",1423008000,,1114,4.930851063829787
