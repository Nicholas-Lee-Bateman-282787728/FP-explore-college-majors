1860139,5,B00008RUYS,"This movie does for elevators what The Legend of Boggy Creek 2 did for Mad Dog attacks. It's all about elevators with human brains that force women into premature labor, teach skaters not to smoke pot, pose as terrorists and kill men, women, children, the blind and their seeing eye dogs. James Marshall stars as an ex-marine elevator repairman that plays air guitar. He's really come a long way since his Twin Peaks days-this is the male equivalent of being spit out of the bottom of the porn industry. Naomi Watts' portrayal of the smut journalist rivals that of James Earl Jones in The Ambulance. I must warn you that she is much, much less naked than she is in Mulholand Dr. It boggles the mind that she made Lynch's Oscar nominated tribute to ambiguity, The Ring and The Shaft all in the same year. The rest of the cast is a duck gallery of B-movie actors: Ron Perlman (the brilliantly played retarded/perverted monk Salvatore in The Name of the Rose as well as Konstantine Konali in Police Academy 7: Mission to Moscow), Dan Hedaya (Karla's ex-husband on Cheers, Richard Nixon in Dick and Alicia Silverstone's father in Clueless), Edward Herrmann (the head, middle-age single mother chasing vampire in The Lost Boys), Michael Ironside (from Starship Troopers, and Seaquest fame) and many more that I'm tired of looking up. Martin McDougall and John Cariani star as a pair of porn-obsessed night watchman that are salute to the bumbling law enforcers in Plan 9 from Outer Space. Well...maybe they are. The movie works on many levels, e.g., most of the people who  rent or buy this movie end up feeling like they got The Shaft. I really can't figure out if it's good or bad. It's either very, very clever or one of the worst I've ever seen. Nonetheless, I'm buying the DVD.",1054684800,7,1777,4.69551282051282

I think what writer/director Dick Maas tried to do was make a horror comedy of sorts (goofy stuff abounds), but ""The Shaft"" falls flat in both respects. The ending is a little suspenseful, but the silliness still gets in the way. The comedic elements are just plain stupid. Overall, we're treated to relatively bad acting, an overly long running time and a lack of the horror element.
Little of the dialogue in ""The Shaft"" rings true. At least 20 minutes could have been left on the cutting room floor. (What works on paper does not always work on screen.) Although Maas did try to flesh out the characters, little of it is successful, including Naomi Watts and her portrayal of a tabloid reporter. Watts operates purely on automatic pilot and displays relatively no acting ability whatsoever.
I almost hate to say it, but there are some decent moments. There's some gratuitous nudity right from the start: two building security guards spying on a couple of nude hookers and a guy. A decapitation scene is pretty well done. A scene where the elevator floor drops out to send more than a few passengers plunging to their deaths is impressive (although reminiscent of ""Speed""). The New York exteriors are done well and contribute to the feeling that you're watching something other than dreck. However, the bottom line is that this is indeed dreck.
One other note: There are several shots of the World Trade Center in the movie. In addition, the police blame the killings on terrorists. A cop makes mention that terrorists almost took out the WTC ""ten years ago."" Another cop says something to the effect of, ""If you see [Osama] Bin Laden, say hi."" I don't object to images of the WTC in existing movies (and would have liked to have had the Spider-Man WTC trailer on the DVD), but the whole thing made me kind of uncomfortable. (The film is copyright 2001; the trailer on the DVD actually has a copyright of 2000.)
As for the DVD itself, Artisan has released ""The Shaft"" in pan 'n' scan with a trailer as the only special feature. The original aspect ratio (OAR) is 2.35:1 (available on the German region 2 DVD release--called ""Down"") and the full frame transfer on the Artisan DVD severely crops the picture. It's difficult to even call this a pan 'n' scan release, however, because there is an annoying lack of panning--with fairly important characters and objects missing from the frame entirely. It is inexcusable that Artisan has released this shoddy pan 'n' scan transfer. However, money is everything. Note the similarity of the artwork on ""The Shaft"" to that of ""The Ring""; the Artisan DVD release of ""The Shaft"" is clearly capitalizing on Naomi Watts and her notable performance in ""The Ring.""",1054684800,2,2763,4.758333333333334

1860142,2,B00008RUYS,"The first thing you will notice about 'The Shaft' is that the acting is not good at all. Not even Naomi Watts (whom I enjoyed in 'The Ring') could deliver a line like she really meant it. You don't realize how annoying bad acting is until you see an entire movie full of it.
The second thing you will notice about 'The Shaft' is that every other word spoken by anyone is the F word. At first, it was cute. After the 600th time I heard it, I decided to give up swearing for good. The only other thing more annoying than bad acting? Over-use of the F word.
The third thing you will notice about 'The Shaft' is that the elevators are evil! I've heard of people being evil. I've even heard of buildings being evil. But...an elevator? Actually, it may be more than just one elevator, but something freaky is happening in the Millennium Building in New York, and people are dying. Naomi plays a reporter who thinks there's a lot more to these deaths than just a malfunction. So, she teams up with an elevator repairman to get to the the bottom of it. Is it terrorists? Is the building built over an Indial burial ground? (yes, believe it or not, that was mentioned as a possibility.) Or is the elevator just a quick way to travel to hell? A couple of the scenes in the elevators reminded me of the elevator scene in 'Speed', and I wished I was watching that instead. I will admit that a couple of the evil elevator scenes were kinda cool, but the ending was just downright silly (and not well-explained).
The fourth thing you will notice about 'The Shaft' is that it could have had potential - not to be a box office horror hit, but to at least be a decent straight-to-video release. Of course, they would have had to recast the entire cast, rewrite the script and explain themselves a little better in the end. If the movie had been done correctly, it should have made me scared to death to ever set foot in an elevator again (I've never liked elevators at all), but I'll still take my chances if it's 4 or more floors I have to travel up.
Do not waste your time on this. If you want to see Naomi in a better-acted, better-scripted movie, get 'The Ring'. If you want to watch a movie about an evil building, try 'The Shining'. But if you want my advice, I'd suggest taking the stairs.",1053561600,11,2279,4.314685314685315
1860143,4,B00008RUYS,"If you take this film as a ""serious horror film,"" you will be probably be angry at the end (or before) of this movie. But if you are looking for a movie to point and laugh at Mystery Science Theater 3000 style, then this one is quite good.
Let's start with the title: The Shaft. This movie already knows its bad. They wanted people to pick this thing up either looking for the classic blaxploitation film or a porno. Either way, they will be terribly disappointed. Fortunately, for the rest of us, the title alone (combined with the requisite picture of the glowing elevator) shows how very cheesy this movie is.
Then there are the characters. There's little to no characterization here, not surprisingly. The two main characters - an elevator repairman ex-Marine and a nosy reporter - are equally obnoxious. And the reporter's clothes are truly horrendous. I thought she deserved to die by the hand (or would it be cord?) of the elevator because of her fashion sense alone. (I can't describe a full outfit, as it's level of ugliness is just so high I've blocked it out of my mind. Either way, hot pink snakeskin jackets should not be legal). There are a bunch of random character actors in here as well, but they just add their name to the credits, if anything. I can't imagine why they chose to make this movie - they must have needed cash, quick.
Now, moving right along to the plot. For movies like this one, you would be likely to say, ""What plot?"" However, like the best of this genre, this film (ahem - I hesitate to call this a film, but nonetheless), attempts to have a plot, but falls miserably on its face instead. After all, this is a movie about a haunted elevator. As one of my friends commented while in the video store, ""How does the elevator kill people? Wouldn't you just take the stairs?"" But despite this obvious issue, this movie actually manages to have too much plot. The group of people I was with was very tempted to just fast-forward, but we just chose to talk over those bits instead. As a result of this excess of plot, the movie is just a bit too long for a really quality flick to make fun of. Thankfully, as we discovered, the parts with the most plot build up to the most spectacular and ridiculous deaths.
And spectacular and ridiculous those are. I won't describe the best for fear of ruining the surprise, but let's just say it ends with an obnoxious rollerblader very, very much squashed. Unfortunately, most of the deaths are not as good as that one (and could possibly be the result of a mechanical failure and not the elevator being haunted), but The Shaft is worth watching just for that one scene. Combined with possibly the worst transition in movie history (we had to go back and watch it twice, it was so horrifically, disturbingly bad), this movie is a minor classic in terms of laughability. But for a real horror movie, go rent Silence of the Lambs.",1053561600,,2896,4.518095238095238
1860165,2,B00008RUYS,"I caught this movie by mistake and the synopsis of the film sounded good. While the local video store was going out of buisness, I found it under drama. Well known actors like Naomi Watts (The Ring) and Ron Perlman (Hellboy) star in this mess. The film is way to long and parts of it doesnt even make sense. The killings are bad as you can tell all were done poorly with CGI. The last death with the man getting his legs crushed did look pretty good. I do not recommend this to anyone. Killer elevators sounds like a good idea but trust me, this movie isn't worth the time.",1278633600,,573,4.218181818181818
1860166,3,B00008RUYS,"THE SHAFT, (not to be comfused with the more well-known movie, ""SHAFT""), is an interesting little thriller that holds your attentioin from beginning to end.  An evil elevator wants to kill people in a NYC office building.  There are thrills and chills.  The acting, directing, production values, and background music are not spectacular -- but certainly better than average.

The best part of this movie, for me, was at the VERY end.  I am not giving away any of the plot, (I don't think), when I say that two of the characters find their way to the rooftop of the building.  Since this was shot in NYC, before 9/11, the panorama of the New York City skyline INCLUDES THE WORLD TRADE CENTER!  For anyone who is, like myself, a native New Yorker who lived during the ""lifetime"" of the WTC -- and/or someone who came to visit NYC as a tourist, and saw these buildings, and what was inside them, first-hand, as well -- this last scene, truly, is THE highlight of this movie.  Sadly, of course, no one who worked on this movie -- or who saw it in its initial theatrical release -- knew of the far greater horror/terror, lurking just a few years away, in deadly reality.  I'm usually not one for colloquial language, but I'm sure I'm not the only person who would like to give ""the shaft"" to a certain Iranian gentleman with the initials: O.B.L.!

Until he gets his just desserts, enjoy this movie, ""The Shaft"", for it's thrills, credible storyline, dialogue, acting, music, and production details.  And be sure to see that last scene.  It's really a true winner...in more ways than one. :_(",1276473600,,1586,4.604982206405694
1860167,2,B00008RUYS,"The Shaft (Dick Maas, 2001)

The Shaft, also known as Down, is one of those incredible train wrecks that makes you wonder how so very many recognizable people found themselves attached to such a godawful movie. Dutch director Maas (probably best known on this side of the pond for Amsterdamned) revisits his own De Lift (1983), but with a much more ambitious scope and an American setting.

The plot: Mark Newman (Twin Peaks' criminally underutilized James Marshall), an elevator repairman, begins to suspect something's hinky, when the elevators in New York's Millennium Building start acting weird. Accompanied by perky reporter Jennifer Evans (Ring's Naomi Watts), he has to figure out what's going on. Yeah, that's pretty much it, with most of the movie dedicated to the elevator's antics, goin' 'round killin' anyone who gets in its path, and a few others just for fun.

But what's really crazy about this movie is the cast. Watts would be nominated for an academy award two years later for 21 Grams, and won the AFI Best Actress award the same year this came out for Mulholland Dr.. Marshall's partner is played by Eric Thal (Snow Falling on Cedars). His boss is Ron Perlman (Hellboy, and a Golden Globe winner for his TV work in Beauty and the Beast). The bad guy is played by Michael Ironside (Scanners). Dan Hedaya, who also showed up in Mulholland Dr., is the lieutenant the police assign to the case. This is not a trivial cast by any means. And somehow Maas manages, Uwe Boll-like, to pull the worst possible performance out of each of these characters. Perlman comes off ham-handed, Watts ineffective. And Ironside? This is the guy who played Daryl Revok? Oh, how the mighty have fallen-- at least for this one flick.

Amusing, in a horrifying sort of way. But avoid unless you have absolutely nothing else to do. * ",1223596800,,1829,4.7936507936507935
1860168,4,B00008RUYS,"""The Shaft"" is one of those guilty pleasures you feel somewhat abashed at liking.  I even feel embarrassed at giving this movie four stars.  The plot is off the wall, some of the acting sucks like a Hoover vac, and the whole thing comes off like a bad C movie.  But I gotta admit -- it's a helluva lot of fun to watch.

So here we are in New York City in the Millenium Building, 102 stories high, just like the Empire State Building which it may or may not be representing.  There's a big bank of elevators servicing the building.  Some of them, for some weird reason, seem to have developed a mind of their own and start acting out in all kinds of crazy, nasty, and just plain lethal ways.

One elevator suddenly turns into a sauna, trapping a dozen women in the end stages of pregnancy who have just left their Lamaze class and causing them to go into labor and give birth right there on the floor.  Another elevator door opens into an empty shaft, down which plunges a blind man and his dog.  A third elevator sucks in a skateboarder like a pneumatic tube, shoot him 86 stories up like a rocket taking off, and propels him out through the nearest window 86 floors down, leaving the poor guy splashed like an overripe melon all over the sidewalk.  Yuck.  Another elevator full of passengers zooms up the shaft while the floor drops out, dumping everybody to their deaths below before it finally zooms through the roof.  A security guard is decapitated and a cop is cut in half.  These elevators aren't kidding around.

A repairman, somewhat woodenly played by James Marshall, can't find a thing wrong with them but something's evidently out of wack with all these elevators doing their own thing and making all kinds of mayhem.  An ambitious newspaper reporter (doesn't every horror movie have to have one of those?), played by Naomi Watts, thinks Somebody is hiding Something and goes off to investigate.  Of course she's right.  Turns out a mad scientist (another stock character) has been experimenting with bio-chips and planted them in the elevator shaft.  You can figure the rest out for yourself.

There's a supporting cast that includes Michael Ironside as Dr. Demento and Ron Perlman as the guy who hired him and lived to regret it, and the cast give adequate performances for the most part, but the stars of this film, of course, are those crazy-creepy elevators.  There's also a great scene with two teenagers in a breath-taking skateboarding race through the streets of midtown Manhattan into the garage of the Millenium Building, from which one emerges shouting ""Beat ya!"" and the other emerges shot like a cannonball from the elevator screaming bloody murder.  Don't even think of taking this movie seriously.  Just accept it for the cheesy camp it is and enjoy the ride.

1860169,1,B00008RUYS,"Remember that scene in Big where Tom Hanks is in a meeting at his new job, playing with the transformer building -- the building that turns into a robot?

This movie is as dopey as that building-bot. Bad acting, and one of the worst plot devices ever. Wow. It doesn't get much worse than this. An artificially intelligent elevator turned evil -- pure concentrated evil!

Actually, there was an X Files episode along these lines that got it right, but this doesn't. Some cool actors in an abysmal movie. No camp, no suspense, and pointless gore.",1215302400,,544,4.65625
1860170,5,B00008RUYS,"So the Millennium building in NYC has a killer elevator.  Why is it killing people you ask?  An elevator repairman and a newspaper reporter(Naomi Watts) are hot on the case.  And hot definitely describes Naomi Watts.  I got a real kick out of these two.  They're very entertaining, and there's some fun elevator kills to boot.

Yes this movie is cheesy.  If you're expecting something like The Exorcist or Alien, you might want to check the cover of the DVD box - it's a killer elevator movie for chrissakes.  If you're in the mood for a cheesy good time, you'll probably enjoy the heck out of it.  I know I did.

1860171,5,B00008RUYS,"I am Autistic and one of my favorite things to watch is and has always been Elevators.  This was a no brainer must Buy for me but I am really quite weird and loving it.  I must say even through I LOVE Elevators this movie looks so corny.  The set's All Look as if they were dressed up bunkers.  The Movie looks as if were filmed mostly in the Fall Out Shelter of a really Old School in California.  I say looks like the filming was in California only because the concrete beams in this high rise building looked like those gigantic earthquake refinforced things you see in L.A.

The building was done up in all shades of that super institutional olive drab prison green that just sucks the life out of everything living within 50 Miles.  The acting was wooden the plot was transparent and the action was weaker than a 90 year old on full life support.  The saving grace of this movie is it took itself seriously and in a really bad B horror movie that usually insures its funny as heck.  The Shaft was funny the life form running the Elevator Looks like a discarded wad of Bubble gum glowing of course.

The cops and safety personal were your stereotyped gung-ho super man muscle heads whose collective IQ would not break 70 if you added 20 points. I gave the movie 4 stars only because, I like Elevators.  I saw another reviewer say he was waiting for the sequel called The Escalator.  I suggest this will likely be a Trilogy.  The Final installment to be named ""The Stairwell"".  You want a cheap laugh in a horror movie.  You looking for that dumb cheap thing to buy to push your shipping to the $25 minimum for super saver shipping.  Buy this.

1860173,2,B00008RUYS,"""The Shaft"" is definitely one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen.  The premise about an elevator with demonic powers is just plain silly.  It's difficult to believe that someone actually pitched this idea to a studio, and it was green-lighted.  It's as bad as any desperate attempt by Irwin Allen to make a disaster movie back in the 1980s.

The dialogue is so laughable and the acting is so wooden, it's amazing that Naomi Watts's career survived.  I have been a big fan of Naomi Watts ever since I saw her in ""King Kong"" and ""21 Grams.""  I'm glad I saw those films before seeing this one on a late-night cable channel.

While ""The Shaft"" is a stupid movie, it's not without its redeeming qualities.  There are some good if gruesome special effects involving the elevator decapitating a security guard and the elevator racing to the roof of the building with its passengers meeting their doom.

And since everything seems to be played tongue-in-cheek, the filmmakers don't expect us to take any of it seriously, so we can laugh at this movie without claiming that the humor is unintentional.

My complaint is not that the humor is unintentional, only that it is unfunny and flat.",1140048000,6,1182,4.694174757281553
1860174,3,B00008RUYS,"I say this a lot, but man ya gotta wonder what a lot of the most negative reviewers were thinking when they decided to watch the movie about the murderous elevator. It's corny, you say? Cheesy? Silly? It is really? Geez, thanks for the input. You'd hope that people would be expecting, nay, wanting something cheesy when they rent the killer elevator movie, but apparently this isn't necessarily the case.

So, obviously, 'The Shaft doesn't work as a straight horror film, but it is quite delightful as a camp horror film. I'm not 100% certain how we're supposed to take this film. It's definitely at least a horror-comedy but it might be an out and out parody. Personally, I get the impression that it is intentionally ambiguous as to its true nature in an attempt to appeal both to the pure camp crowd and the utterly indiscriminate horror fans. No matter what the case, I found it quite entertaining. Whether or not you'll like the film is a tougher call. I suspect the best way is just to ask yourself if the idea of a haunted elevator is amusing to you or not. If it is, go see this movie right now.

Sadly, this movie doesn't have as much elevator action as you'd anticipate. Certainly, it has it's share, perhaps enough for an 80-90 minute film, but this thing is like 110 minutes and really emphasizes the investigation. Now this stuff is still pretty cool and all, but we need more flaming death elevator. I also think it's cute how this movie is as long as it is, and yet it hardly explains anything. There are basically 3 questions you might have: Why are the elevator's sentient? Why do they have magical powers? And why do they wanna kill people? The film only answers the first question, and while I doubt they could've made intriguing answers to the next two ones I think it's funny that they don't even try.

This movie has more people you might've heard of than you'd expect for an direct to DVD horror film. It's got a then unknown Naomi Watts, Ron Perlman, Dan Hedaya, Edward Hermann and Michael Ironside. (Even if you don't know those names I bet you'll recognize some of the actors when you see them.) The performances are generally pretty over the top, as well they ought to be, and really bolster the amusing dialogue. (Also, Watts is pleasant to ogle, as usual.  More so than usual, as a matter of fact.) A few of the deliberate jokes are almost painful, but it's got plenty of funny lines, regardless of whether they were all intended to be funny. Also, there's comes a point where if you say a single word enough times (in this case 'elevator', obviously) it becomes funny for no apparent reason. I also enjoyed the insensitive references to terrorists and the shots of the WTC. (This film was shot shortly before 9/11)

I also like that this film is a bit more juvenile and cruel than your average horror film. It's great that Maas kills a dog in the film. People always flip out when you hurt or kill an animal in film and I've always hated that reaction. It's loose enough this way that when the adorable little girl goes near the elevators, I actually believed that she might get wasted.

This movie is full frame, for some reason. What sorta company releases a film in full frame alone in the year 2003? They shouldn't be releasing them like that at all until all the stupid full framers just convert. This is especially annoying since this movie was apparently shot in 2.35:1 unlike most cheap horror films which are merely 1.85:1 and don't suffer nearly as much from being cropped. But oh well, I doubt it had any fantastic cinematography that I missed out on due to this.  Also, the only extra this comes with is the trailer.  It's a good one however.  If you weren't excited to see the movie about the evil elevator before, you will be. Very soon.  In fact, the trailer makes the movie look like it's gonna be more awesome than it is.

Well that's it. 'The Shaft' is just good campy fun.  I'm surprised it's not better known than it is.  This sorta wackiness if the kinda thing camp film lovers dream about.  Ah well, maybe in a couple years...

Grade: C+
(Note, grades on camp films and good-bad films are generally pretty meaningless from me.  I've never come up with a real system for it.  Suffice to say I enjoyed this a lot.)",1137542400,8,4265,4.496765847347995
1860195,2,B00008RUYS,"Before Naomi Watts became a big star from excellent performances in excellent films like ""Huckabees"", ""Mulholland Drive"", and ""21 Grams"" she was delivering excellent performances in a lot of garbage movies like ""The Shaft"". And while her performance here does not save the movie, it does elevate (bad pun intended)it to a viewable level.

The only other reason to watch this thing is as yet another example of the film-making phenomenon that big is not only not better, but much worse. Which is probably related to the human interest angle in journalism, where a large disaster cannot sustain interest as long as the same story on a smaller more human scale.

For those who don't already know it, ""The Shaft"" or ""Down"" is Dutch Director/Writer Dick Mass's remake of his 1983 classic ""De Lift"". One posted comment about the original says: "".... looks technically proficient, with fine color texture, smooth cinematography ( by Marc Felperlaan ) and tight editing ( by Hans van Dongen ), elements that help to maintain a high level of suspense. The story clearly echoes Jaws, with its obsessed hero and corrupted authority figures, who would rather disguise the truth than face it. Despite this movie being his debut, many of Maas's personal trademarks are also already in place: quick pacing, sadistic gore effects modified by edgy humor, mild satire on bourgeois preoccupations, and broadly etched supporting characters"".

Apparently the title ""Elevator"" was already taken and ""Lift"" was too European so he was left with two very stupid titles for the remake, with which the distributors have experimented to no positive effect.

In the 1983 version, the elevator of an Amsterdam flat (another European term) misbehaves badly. The elevator begins trying to crush, suffocate and decapitate passengers. Fearless mechanic Felix does battle with the seemingly haunted machine. But the anti-technology twist is that the elevator has developed a mind of its own due to an experimental 'biochip'. Felix is assisted by a magazine reporter named Mieke de Beer ( wasn't that the name of Scotty's German pen pal in ""Eurotrip""?).

The original was shot in just 30 days with a very limited budget, this constrained the production resulting in an intimate story, viewers identified with the characters and this greatly enhanced the suspense level. This time someone gave Maas a lot of money and he pumped up the production; moving it to New York, adding tons of unnecessary effects, making the elevator absurdly powerful, and geometrically increasing the size of the cast. The Amsterdam elevator was deadly but in ways that a malfunctioning elevator could be deadly. The new elevator is like a cross between a James Bond story and a poor 1950's science fiction film.

Not surprisingly the human interest wheels fall off immediately. If you ignore your strong impulse to bail you will see decent performances from Watts and the from various character actors who populate the cast.

Unfortunately for Mass, he choose New York City for this 2001 movie and deviated from the original by throwing in some misdirection about terrorists being behind the elevator accidents. There is even a line about the first bombing of the World Trade Center. Apparently this was embarrassing enough to insure that there was no theatrical release.

1860197,2,B00008RUYS,"Don't look down, the first step's a doozy - aka - Do yourself a favor...take the stairs.

The elevators in one of New York city's most popular business and tourist attraction skyscrapers begin to kill people.  It takes a ""goof off but great in a crisis"" (is there any other kind of goof off in movies?) elevator repair man (James Marshall) and a spunky female reporter (again, is there any other kind?) (Naomi Watts) to prove that the cause is something other than faulty circuits or sabotage and more along the lines of thinking, man made evil.

This is a slow moving film with stock characters, average performances from the leads, and some good actors (Edward Herman, Michael Ironside, Ron Perlman, the reasons this gets two stars and not none) in small roles.  It's a B- TV quality movie.  Don't mind mindless horror movies and home sick from work?  That's the kind of time to watch this film.  The spookiest thing about this movie is that it mentions terrorism, Osama Bin Laden, the 1993 attack on the Towers, and came out just before 9/11.

1860200,3,B00008RUYS,"Now this is just getting ridiculous. I followed a review for the Troma schlockfest ""Killer Condom"" with a few comments about ""Inseminoid."" Now I am writing a review for a film called ""The Shaft."" What's even funnier is the next movie I have on my list, a little number named ""Contamination."" I absolutely swear to you that I had no impure thoughts in mind when I assembled my list of products to review. I have my own system about what to review, one that I sometimes deviate from when the mood strikes me, but I have to wonder if some sort of subliminal thoughts were percolating under my mental radar after looking at the order of these risqu sounding movies. Really, though, if I was seeking some sinister pattern, I would probably have arranged the titles thus: ""The Shaft,"" ""Killer Condom,"" ""Contamination,"" and ""Inseminoid."" At least that ordering seems to resemble the reproductive route to some extent (excepting contamination, of course, although that sadly happens to more than a few unfortunate souls). Perhaps this whole thing is the reviewer's equivalent of a Freudian slip. Sorry about that.
After watching the film ""The Shaft,"" I was surprised I had not heard of it before. The movie deals with the disastrous consequences of an elevator possessed by some malevolent force. One of the biggest buildings in what could only be New York City is the scene of an increasingly bizarre series of mutilations and murders centering around one of the building's primary elevator shafts. The building's management moves quickly to cover things up after a car full of pregnant ladies experiences a strange incident in the elevator that causes all of them to suddenly give birth. Further nightmares occur when a several passengers die horribly when the bottom falls out of the elevator car in question, a skater is expelled from the elevator like a ball shot out of a cannon (on the top floor, no less, meaning it is a long way down through that pane of glass!), and a security guard undergoes a horrendous decapitation. What is going on here? Who knows and who cares! Well, the local police seem to care a great deal about the gory antics in the building, as do the people who frequent the establishment. The local elevator repair dudes care the most since they are always heading out to the building to check for malfunctions after the latest disaster.
The movie centers on these two repair techs, especially Mark Newman (James Marshall). He's the sort of guy who slums his way through life, spending his nights drinking himself into a stupor and dealing with his mercurial girlfriend. Newman only took the job with the elevator company because it seemed like a relatively easy way to make a living. As the disturbing incidents in the building begin to build to a fever pitch, Mark starts asking a lot of questions that make everyone around him nervous. When a catty reporter named Jennifer Evans (Naomi Watts) starts digging up dirt on the gruesome accidents, she quickly drags the repairman into the fray when she prints several smart aleck statements he made about the dangers of using elevators. After a sound cussing out from his boss about this unwanted publicity, Newman resolves to keep his nose clean and just do his job. He can't, though, because the nightmarish elevator and Jennifer continue to cause problems for him. Moreover, an enigmatic character named Gunter Steinberg (Michael Ironsides with German accent in tow) draws suspicion when Jennifer and Mark discover he worked on some top-secret military project to turn computers into living creatures. And the very same Gunter Steinberg just happens to work at the elevator research facility at Newman's company (there is actually research attempting to advance elevator technology? Goodness!). Could Steinberg have something to do with recent events?
Hammy. Cheesy. Goofy. These words, and several similar ones, come to mind when watching ""The Shaft."" The cast only adds to the general sense of ridiculousness. Dan Hedaya, Michael Ironsides, Edward Herrmann, and Ron Perlman all make appearances here. And all turn in over the top performances. One wonders why these actors appeared in ""The Shaft."" Are they this desperate to pick up a paycheck? Apparently so. At least Naomi Watts has an excuse for working in this mediocre horror movie. Still trying to make a name for herself in Hollywood when the film was made, Watts does an adequate job playing the yellow journalist looking to make her big break in the hard-hitting world of the New York newspaper industry. Her character IS annoying, but she's supposed to be so it works out well. As for Marshall, he mostly smirks his way through his role as Mark Newman.
There are two scenes worth looking for during the course of the film. The skater rocketing out of the elevator and through a glass window on the top floor of the building is a definite winner, almost to the point of justifying a viewing of the film in and of itself. The second worthwhile scene occurs when the bottom drops out of a packed elevator car, a scene that adds to the general sense of hilarity found throughout ""The Shaft."" The DVD edition of the movie is notable only for a cover case that shamelessly rips off the DVD cover of Watts's other horror film, ""The Ring."" C'est la vie when it comes to ""The Shaft,"" I guess. Not a great film, not even a particularly memorable one, it still provides a few chuckles and groan worthy moments during its nearly two hour run time. Good luck.",1077321600,3,5478,4.847385272145144
1860201,3,B00008RUYS,"""The Shaft"" (aka ""Down"" in some countries) is virtually a remake of the Dutch cult film ""The Lift"" which was made in 1983 by the same Dutch director Dick Maas (""Do Not Disturb"").  The original film about an elevator that kills people was a big hit in Europe, and he revamped the idea with newer technology and English-speaking cast now.
Probably you expect to see Naomi Watts as the lead, but the fact is James Marshall as elevator repairman (and ex-marine ... how convenient!) is the protagonist of the film.  This guy Mark Newman and Naomi Watts's Jennifer Evans, a journalist for NYC paper, suspect something strange behind the repeated accidents of the express elevators in ""The Millenium Building"" of the city.  But what is it?
The idea of killing elavator is interesting (which is later to be found in ""Final Destination 2""), and some parts of the film are really good and even scary.  You should see how the machine kills for yourself if you are intrigued by the idea at all, but remember, Dick Maas' films are doing all these things with quite tongue-in-cheek attitudes.  You cannot take the film seriously, so let's forget the totally silly logics about this  demonic machine or awfully corny dialogues.
This film is shot just before Naomi Watts went for bigger things like ""Mulholand Drive"" ""The Ring"" and ""28 grams.""  No one thought she was going to be Oscar nominee at that time (me neither) and the names of the supports reflect that condition.  Michael Ironside (""Starship Troopers"") is as hammy as ever, and Ron Perlman and Dan Hedaya (both in the fourth ""Alien"" series) also show up, plus Edward Herrman (""The Cat's Meow"").
Again I say, ""The Shaft"" is silly, and only occasionally good.  It is certain that Dick Maas has considerable visual flair (see the opening floating shot), but his whimsical comic sense prevents the film from running smooth with suspence and horror.  It's a real pity",1077062400,7,1907,4.804281345565749
1860202,5,B00008RUYS,"Remember, folks, this movie was made before the awful disaster on 9/11.  Wisely, the movie got held until later.  So, if you consider that, the terrorist implication and the jokes about Bin Laden perhaps formed a sort of foreshadowing or warning.  At any rate, I found ""The Shaft"" rather enjoyable.  It has several really disturbing scenes:  the death of the skateboarder was incredibly paced and filmed; the floor dropping out was mindboggling; and even the decapitated security guard's death was nerve-wracking.  Add some really ""humorous"" asides:  the foul mouthed day care teacher was way out of left field.  The performances were adequate.  Take Naomi Watts off of her post-Shaft pedestal (Mulholland Drive/The Ring) and you get a young actress doing the best with what she had.  James Marshall who also worked with Lynch on Twin Peaks is effective, not great.  Eric Thal did a nice job as his friend Jeffrey; Michael Ironside, Ron Pearlman and Dan Hedaya were effective in their almost cameo roles.  Even Edward Hermann looking more and more like a younger Rudy Vallee captured the right amount of commercialism in his role.  Maybe they did use the f word a little too much, but have you noticed that if the f word gets used a lot in a critically acclaimed movie (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, etc.) no one gripes about that.
Take THE SHAFT for what it is--an above average thriller that delivers.",1073347200,6,1398,4.872881355932203
1860203,2,B00008RUYS,"Okay the idea of an elevator killing people at its own free wil is stupid, but some of the death scenes have a plausable occurance. Like the elevator floor breaking off. Two deaths in this movie effected me, the first was the guy who was thrown from the 87 floor and is seen splatter on the ground, the other was when the elevator floor collapsed and we see kids that are like 5 years old fall to their death. Why did these effect me? Wel they brought back bad flashbacks of 9/11. You know people jumping from windows and stuff. So if were on the spot were 9/11 occured, I strongly recomend not seeing this. But for the rest of us, well the acting is terrible, so is the dialogue (I mean how many times do they really need to use the F word?), and the whole premise of a computer ship made from human cells being put into an elevator and coming to life is just plain stupid. So for a cheeze fest with some decent gore, this is the movie to see.",1067558400,,944,4.135869565217392

Boy was I wrong, Shaft pulls one of those have Naomi's pictures in the title letters thing. That had to be taken from the Ring cover. Anyway, Naomi's role is basically a supportive one and her character is almost identical to hers in the Ring. Naomi did her best she could with the [crummy] dialogue but it is so obvious that she didn't even want to be on the set. The male lead is just horrible, I had to laugh. There were some cool death scenes, my favorite being the skater boy. Poor guy.

DOWN (aka The Shaft)
2001 / Blue Underground / 111m / $39.98 (BR+DVD combo) / R
 With these two releases from Blue Underground we have an intriguing pair of titles: a Dutch horror film (and who knew there were any?) and its almost 20 years later English remake from the same director, Dick Maas. Both involve an elevator in a high rise that inexplicably begins to malfunction; first it stalls between floors and heats up, causing discomfort for the passengers to the extent that several land in the hospital. The mysterious behavior soon starts causing fatalities (including an impressively rendered decapitation). A repairman (here Felix, played by Huub Stapel) whos trying to suss out the problem is called off the job by his employer. Hes determined to get to the bottom of the problem, however, and he reluctantly allies himself with newspaper reporter Mieke (Willeke van Ammelrooy). Shes been writing some rather sensationalistic pieces on the deaths but shes the one who figures out just whats going on (which I won't reveal here even though the film drops the penny fairly early).
The remake isn't a strict one, though it follows essentially the same storyline with minor alterations and a good deal of opening up the proceedings. The 14-story highrise is now well over 100 levels in height and the lobby set is appropriately enormous and quite lavish. The obviously enlarged budget allowed Maas to cast semi-names like James Marshall and Naomi Watts in the leads and back them up with the likes of Michael Ironside, Edward Herrmann, Dan Hedaya and Ron Perlman. The expanded storyline now includes a police investigation into the deaths and, with suspicion of terrorism (this was made after the first bombing attempt on then World Trade Center), a full-scale military action. Whether these embellishments  and an additional 12 minutes  improve things is up to the viewer. The remake does offer smoother, more assured filmmaking. It also, however, feels a bit overstuffed, though that reaction may be entirely due to having watched the two versions back to back.",1512172800,4,2145,4.9860335195530725
