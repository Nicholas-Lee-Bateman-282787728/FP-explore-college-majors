8742692,5,B018QR1R5K,"Loved this live action version of the show. Think of it as an abbreviated version of the show. Some events are moved around and done a little differently. It's not easy taking 26 episodes and making it into a 2 hour movie. The subtitles are perfect, I did notice one word was off. Only one. So if you're a fan of the show you'll love this movie. It's just a lot of fun.",1452038400,4,369,4.068493150684931
