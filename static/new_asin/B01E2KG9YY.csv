7730133,5,B01E2KG9YY,"Love! Easy to put on and take off, super cute, comfortable to hold, and, most importantly, has saved my phone from damage many times after being dropped from various heights. I had a similar one for my last phone as well and will probably stick with the same for my next!",1472774400,,271,4.333333333333333
7730134,5,B01E2KG9YY,Love this case. Fun sparkles but very sturdy with its two part design. Easy to remove and exchange battery (best if done from side).  I'm ordering a second color today for variety.  Also you can't beat the price.,1470960000,,212,4.552631578947368

7730141,4,B01E2KG9YY,This is a good phone protector but it is a little hard to remove and put back on (if you need to).  The fit is very tight and the rubber edge sticks up higher than the front of the phone so it is a good buffer.,1483747200,,210,3.5652173913043477

8757571,1,B01E2KG9YY,"Bought this for my wife. Absolute garbage. While the hard case part would fit nicely, the rubber inset isn't even made with the same openings and the volume button doesn't come close to lining up correctly. I tried stretching it out to make it work, but it looked horrible. Do NOT buy this if you're looking for a good case for an LG5.",1491609600,,335,4.333333333333333
