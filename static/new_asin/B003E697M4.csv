4113439,2,B003E697M4,This is a movie for those who still think that Romeo and Juliet was a love story and not Emos of the Renaissance period thrashing about in existential guilt.  If you don't understand that but just sigh and say 'Romeo and Juliet - how romantic!' - you will love this movie.  Otherwise...move along...,1395014400,,299,4.622641509433962

4113441,5,B003E697M4,Love this movie. I have seen this movie like 20 times or more. I just got the book and started reading it so far the movie and the book match up. Alot of times the books and movies don't match up. So far so good,1394668800,,211,3.7111111111111112
4113442,4,B003E697M4,"This is an interesting story of a very young (rather immature) woman dealing with guilt.  She already had guilt over slowly losing love for her fiance when he then had a life changing accident.  The guilt overwhelms her and she runs away.  She immediately hooked up with someone she had just met and started a sexual affair with him. Personally, I don't understand that.  She eventually goes home and then decided to stay.  Because of guilt.  What?  I felt sorry for the new man - she just used him.  This story wasn't really resolved because of an ambiguous ending.  If the ending had been different I might have enjoyed it more, because I see nothing wrong with getting on with your life when a tragedy changes everything.",1339977600,3,724,4.637795275590551
4113443,2,B003E697M4,"The Dive from Clausen's Pier
1 Disc Widescreen, released July 13, 2010

""The Dive from Clausen's Pier"" is a Lifetime movie from 2005 directed by Harry Winer based on a novel by Anne Packer and starring Michael Trachtenberg. Carrie has been with the same boyfriend, Mike played by Will Estes for eight years and is engaged to marry him, but has been growing apart for some time when he suddenly has a horrible diving accident resulting in him being paralyzed. After trying to be strong, she reaches a breaking point and runs away to New York and its possibilities with a relationship with an older man, Kilroy played by Sean Maher.

All Lifetime movies have a formula of a female lead, romantic difficulties, and tough decisions. Carrie is set-up as if she is this caring girlfriend but her impatience with Mike's antics make her come-off as a PMS-ing terror until he becomes a quadriplegic and she forces emotions for him and that's exactly what they are -- forced. Mike has difficulty coping with his situation and says very rude, out-of-place remarks and acts out against the nursing staff in unbelievable ways. Basically it's no wonder she doesn't love him anymore and he has trouble believing she cares.

Running away to New York and living la vie boheme pushes her into hopes of a career in the nearly impossible field of fashion design and into the arms of a man twelve years older than her and lacking emotional depth. It seems he is running away from a mysterious tragedy in his life as well that is unspeakable.

Michelle Trachtenberg squeezes out tears when necessary and really tries to convince the audience she is mature, but comes off as a poser. The lines feel like lines. She does much better work in the non-verbal moments confronting her old boyfriend and trying to understand the strangeness of her new one.

Will Estes seems abrupt to the point of unnatural when he first becomes hospitalized and is difficult to watch. Making situations awkward was definitely his goal, but wow did he ever make it easy for her to leave! Sean Maher brings a bit of charm, but the French cuisine tactic is way over the edge.

If the story had another half an hour to iron itself out, maybe these characters would have achieved more growth but the middle of the movie was filled with situational party moments that lacked depth. Sit this melodrama out because while it seems to be going somewhere, the ending is inconclusive and unsatisfactory.

4113454,1,B003E697M4,"I just read the book so I was very interested in watching the movie.  What a waste of $3.99.  The acting wasn't great, the music was cheesy, the screenplay was choppy and not subtle.  There was no real chemistry between Carrie and Kilroy and the sex scenes were uncomfortable to watch.  I fast forwarded through much of the movie.  Wish I'd just gone to bed instead.",1440720000,2,366,4.484848484848484

4113462,4,B003E697M4,"I enjoyed this movie, as I enjoy most of the older, late 90s lifetime movies. In summary, a teenager has a life-changing, debilitating  accident after diving from a pier. His fianc&eacute; had already began to doubt her feelings for the young man prior to the incident, so to complicate things she's torn between whether to do what feels right in her heart or what is right in her mind.",1417219200,,386,4.594202898550725

don't expect much except something to watch while you're doing something else, then its ok.",1403654400,,181,4.484848484848484
4113482,1,B003E697M4,The Dive from Clausen's Pier was not very good. Most was about young kids and responsibility. Seems they were all about self. One moment of not thinking changed all of their lives forever. It was pretty much predictable. I was not impressed with this movie. It was sad yet in many cases true. Think before you act seems to have not been done in this movie at all. I did not like this movie.,1400716800,,390,4.283783783783784
4113483,3,B003E697M4,"I read the book years ago and remembered it differently.  I liked the book better.  But that is often the case, isn't it?!
What I liked is the exploration of an unpopular stand, that the young woman couldn't cope with his injury.  It ended as many may have wanted it to, but I was not persuaded by the film that all the implications of her choice were really dealt with.",1399161600,2,370,4.257142857142857

8395332,2,B003E697M4,"I found the leading actress to be more annoying than anything else. She comes across as self centered and attention seeking. She has zero empathy for anyone. She professes love for her new boyfriend, but as soon as he says he loves her, she rejects him. I don't want spoil it for anyone so I won't write anymore.. but overall, the movie was not very good..... IMHO.",1514505600,,365,4.462686567164179
8395333,2,B003E697M4,"A colleague recently passed me the novel, which affected me deeply although my story and Carrie's could not be more different. The book is rich with descriptive detail and conjured such wonderful images, I was compelled to look for a film version -- and as it happens, there is one! Unfortunately, however, it is a Lifetime Movie version (and I'm being quite serious here, although this detail becomes critical in my review), which essentially robs the complex layers of plot, character, relationship, setting, and motivation down to the level of any Afterschool Special. I'm not sure if the problem was the screenwriting, the casting, the direction, or a combination of these. But the worst part for me was Michelle Trachtenberg's stubborn insistence on playing every dramatic moment as though she was smelling freshly baked brownies. So annoying! I suppose I should have known that it wasn't possible to translate such a complex novel successfully to the screen. I still think a feature film version, in the right hands, would be amazing.",1489276800,,1040,5.087719298245614
