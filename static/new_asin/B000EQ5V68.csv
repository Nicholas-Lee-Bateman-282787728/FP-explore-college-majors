8112833,5,B000EQ5V68,"The sequel to Night Warriors; Darkstalkers' Revenge - Alpha, Omega is a must have for those who bought the first DVD. The animation, story and characters are just as good in the second installment of this great anime. The story follows directly from the end of Alpha so if you are getting Omega you really should see Alpha first (if only to understand why the characters are doing what they are).

This was a great finish to the OVA but the ending left you wondering if there would be more to follow. Fingers crossed that someone will eventually continue this story!",1252368000,,566,4.603960396039604
