3870126,4,B0027ZLI0C,"Mo and the Big Exit, retelling the story of Moses and the Pharaoh, is the basis of our Video lesson in Rotation Sunday School.  It handles the plagues of Egypt in a humorous way that isn't frightening to young children, but still is clear in getting the point across.  I have found that the VeggieTales movies really hold the children's attention more than other animated movies. Our Sunday School kids are big VeggieTales' fans!",1263340800,12,429,4.783783783783784

8355322,2,B0027ZLI0C,"Veggie Tales: Heroes of the Bible - Moses, Miriam and Joseph. I feels it was too loosely based on the Bible. I received ""Heroes of the Bible - Lions, Shepherds and Queens"" as a gift and found it very good, but this one strayed to far from the actual stories to be worth while. I had my doubts with it being changed to a western. Moe (Moses) riding a buffalo and dressing like the lone ranger and calling out ""hi ho silver"" when he throws his stick down to become a rattlesnake was a small part compared to many other changes. I don't feel kids are that much into westerns now a days and the venue change from Egypt to the Rocky Mountains was not necessary. I would not recommend this one. I would recommend ""Veggie Tales - Heroes of the Bible - Lions, Shepherds and Queens (Oh My!)"". The latter made my little girl want to read the real stories out of the Bible, while with this one I don't think she would be able to make the comparisons.",1424995200,,939,4.222222222222222
