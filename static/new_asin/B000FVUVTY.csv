8127605,3,B000FVUVTY,"Both of these epics are a lot of fun and ""Hercules Unchained"" is the best example of the recipe that most ""sword and sandals""  films would take up. But the surprise is ""Giant of the Marathon"" which has a very interesting plot line and a nice performance by Reeves.
It actually has a simple charm to it as well and plenty of action especially where Steve takes on a brutal and arrogant wrestler.  Plenty of fun for young teenage boys to mock out and an interesting side line for a discerning film fan.  And of course Reeve's physique is pre-heavy steroid bloated bodybuilders we are used to today and you can see why his build made such a commotion in the cinema long ago.",1375401600,2,671,4.395161290322581
