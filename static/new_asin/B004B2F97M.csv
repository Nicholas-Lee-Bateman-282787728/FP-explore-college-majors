8421293,3,B004B2F97M,"Virtually everything on this disk has appeared on previous compilations.  If this is your first such purchase you might rate it higher than I do, but I've seen most if it before.  There seems to be a shortage of new material so people just keep rereleasing the old stuff in a different guise.",1406505600,,292,4.490566037735849

8421295,5,B004B2F97M,These are old and new films full of interesting train history. I like watching them as well as my 3 yr old,1394150400,,106,3.8636363636363638
8421296,3,B004B2F97M,This is a collection of vintage railroad advertising videos and some older videos of famous trains.  I had many of the videos in my collection from the original VHS tapes so this was not that interesting to me.  If one does not have an extensive video collection this could be very interesting.  Videos of some of the early advertisements for railroads can be eye opening in the way things were shown.  Because these are remastered from earlier films the quality suffers but is still viewable.,1381104000,,493,4.764705882352941
8421297,4,B004B2F97M,"Lot of cool old shots of early trains I loved.

footage but if you love trains like I do, you can
