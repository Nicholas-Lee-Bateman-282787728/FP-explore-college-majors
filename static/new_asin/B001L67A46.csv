3681212,5,B001L67A46,"You have never seen another movie like this. Part documentary, part narrative story about a black man's search for a good woman. It started with a 3 minute clip about a black man stopping by his ex wife's house to pick up his child and being ridiculed by the ex  and her friends because he had the nerve to show up with a white woman. From there the movie takes you places you never thought you would go. People across the nation react to the scene and then we see the history of the couple interspersed with comments by a variety of black people on the nature of black relationships and something called ""Angry Black Woman Syndrome"". How long before this is a topic on Oprah? What ever you do, don't watch this movie alone. You are going  to want watch this with someone because you are going to want to talk about it afterward.... Then you are going to want to share it with other friends just so you can have the conversation with them to. It's not a comedy, but you'll find yourself laughing out loud at several scenes and by the comments by people on the street. I venture to say this is ""an important movie"". A must see aimed at a black audience but valuable to any man, woman, or couple that desires a great loving relationship.",1234915200,4,1235,4.341991341991342
3681213,4,B001L67A46,"Documentaries are a very special branch of the art of cinema. It's purpose can range from entertainment to instruction usually based on some true events or controversial subject. The documentary can put you in the middle of history or show you the lives of regular people that otherwise you would never be aware of. The genre grew out of the old theatrical newsreels. Back in the day long before television took hold of almost every home in the country the people would go to the movie houses and stay for the entire evening. During that time you would get to watch a feature film, a secondary flick, a few cartoons and a newsreel. This was the way that facts and opinions were expressed and lead directly to a lengthier version that we call the documentary. Now it is one of the only genre to get its own category in many award shows including the much lauded Academy Awards; the genre is that special and different. Over time the documentary would take on many varied forms. Some documentary film makers keep a distance from their subject. Others insert themselves directly in the action. It may seem that the format has become routine and some may say even hackney but there is hope in the horizon. Independent film maker Tim Alexander has come up with an extremely fresh and novel approach to this type of film with his work `Diary of a Tired Black Man'. He uses professional actors to play out a situation to invoke an emotional response in his audience. Many documentaries have used actors for reenactments of scenes that occurred in history but this movie combines the documentary with the comedy drama with stunning results. The uniqueness of this film does not stop with its construction and presentation. The marketing involved a model that will certainly become heavily used as time goes on. A three minute clip was posted on the internet and soon made its way around the world. This served to tease the viewers and greatly increase the anticipation for the fill film. The film had some showings in various Indy film festivals but its wide release will be through its DVD premiere handled by Magnolia Home Entertainment. They have always managed to locate the little gems out there in the independent film world and bring them into the house of movie buffs everywhere.

This is the first film for Tim Alexander and like many new film makers has taken on more than one hat for the production. He is a true renaissance man capable of handing just about every job function needed in a film crew. It is not unusual for one person to take on writing, direction and production but that is only the tip of the iceberg for Alexander. He wrote the musical score, designed the sets, handled the makeup, wardrobe and worked the camera. It isn't mentioned in the credits but I would be surprised if he also cooked and served at the craft service table. To say this was an ambitious undertaking for Alexander would be a gross underestimation and disservice to the man. What is most amazing is this was his initial foray into all these jobs. If you looked at his resume with all these jobs on a single film you most likely wouldn't believe it at all. The most incredible thing is the fact that Alexander wildly succeeds in each of these functions; he is a one man film school. Needless to say this movie is a work of love for him. This is something that jumps off the screen and pulls the audience in; the sheer love for cinema that Alexander possesses. He certainly had help with crafting this film but this is completely his project.

As the title of the film lets on this movie focuses on relationships in the African American community. While the viewpoints are specific to this portion of our society the issues at the heart of the film are universal in nature. No matter what ethnic group you happen to belong to themes such as passion, love, hate and revenge are part of your emotional makeup. The movie examines the difficulty between black men and women in maintaining a relationship. It does touch on some of the unique and very specific circumstances, history and obstacles that face the African Americans but can be translated to one degree or another to anyone. It treads the fine line between being so general as to lose its impact and being overly critical of a single group. This is a raw and at times an emotionally draining film to watch. There is purity to the way the actors let loose on each other that are captivating even if painful at times to view. Alexander certainly knew that he was going to stir up a hornet's nest with the release of this movie. Members of the black community are sure to be divided with what they take away from viewing this film. The part of the focus that is less universal in the most important to the production in many ways. Alexander wanted to expose the effects of tradition, media expectation and prejudice on the black relationship. While all groups have their own variations and will be able to use that to appreciate the film it is targeted and acts as magnifying glass to bring all the harsh details to light. It is this juxtaposition of the highly specific to the general that makes this a brilliant work.

The film stars Jimmy Jean-Louis who plays the mind bending superhero Haitian on the NBC television series `Heroes'. Here he portrays James, a black man who is just trying to navigate the murky waters of relationships. The first shot of him is James sitting back having a cup of coffee as he reads an entry from the titular diary. In the time in point he went to pick up his daughter from the home of his ex-wife, Tanya (Paula Lema). Also there, however, were Tanya's three friends. The big mistake that James made in the eyes of his ex and her friends was to show up with a white woman. This is shown in the three minute clip presented here window box for effect. As Tanya meets James at the door the attack immediately escalates. She is resentful not only that he dare to bring another woman to pick up his daughter but the fact that she is white is too much. Tanya taunts him saying that he couldn't find a black woman who would lay back ad let him walk all over her. James does try to keep his composure throughout the heated exchange as the friends begin to chime in with their own sharp barbs. James does point out a bit of possible hypocrisy since one of Tanya's friends is dating a white man. They twist that around on James in short order.

The film stays true to the documentary style throughout. It is gritty and realistic with a power to it that is amazing. Some may argue that this is just another drama but it is far more. It is a documentary in the sense that it takes a real situation and presents it through the perception of the film maker. While the characters may be portrayed by actors and extremely talented ones at that, there is a reality here that is rarely if ever caught in a standard film. This is an important piece of cinema and one that should not be missed.",1233360000,2,6953,4.52903739061257
3681214,5,B001L67A46,"I am a single 45 year old African American raising a 7 year old son.  This film was absolutely amazing and accurate in my opinion.  I found myself and my circumstances in so many of the characters and dialogue.  I was up til 3am watching the film, jotting notes and quotes, and afterwards wanted to purchase at least 10 copies for my friends!

Trust, this is a message that women need to hear.  Most issues that we deal with in relationships are addressed in this film and feedback by the average ""joe/josephine"" plummer across America are incorporated.

This is a man's ""waiting to exhale"" film that can be extremely beneficial to men and women in relationships.  WELL DONE MR. ALEXANDER!""",1229126400,8,690,4.7

3681232,3,B001L67A46,"""THE STREET JOURNALIST"" FOUND THESE ""YOUNG"" PEOPLE AND LEFT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE AS HE FOUND THEM.  HE PROVIDED NO HELP, JUST CRITICISM.  ANY HELP OR INFORMATION TO PERHAPS BETTER THEIR SITUATIONS AS YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN OF THE FUTURE WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT CONTRAST.  It was very tiring to hear ''monologues'' from Dr. Phil and the Oprah Show about not having a boy in the home: the pop-psychology stuff.  I am so sick and tired of hearing those cliches.  I'm thinking of the damage it could do on boys who fathers die in the war or who die in car accidents of the thousands of other ways a boy's father or a girl's mother may not be there because they died.  Or, because they just up and left,  SO!!!  So society attacks these children and kill their spirit with this psycho-mumbo jumbo.  What I want children to know is there is a thousand ways to have a life and a thousand and one ways to create and live a ""style""--and AMERICA loves this grand mix of ways and things.  It sparks vitalities, new ideas and ideals and new inventions and concepts.  Everybody should have a right to live their story but we cut the legs out from under a percentage of the population with:
  ""Oh!  Raised without your father, a father--Oh! raised without a mother....hmmm; that's too bad.
  That's why you will always be poor and ignorant and violent and drug-using and divorced.
  Your life will always be messed up!""

BACK IN THE DAY, say 65+ years ago, say, in the 40s and the 50s, the 'Negro' man and the 'Negro' woman [no one dared said ""black man and black woman""] ...the Negros were so close we use to say ""syrupy sweet"".  Don't believed that?  Well, I got news for you.  When Negros traveled there were no hotels; Negros stayed in Negro homes.  They didn't feel like strangers to each other.  If a Negro was ''properly'' raised, which most were, they not only gained a place to stay, they found a new family.  And this care was recipocal.  Negros ate at Negro tables and restuarant and strangers were taken in and bonded like family.  In urban areas like Harlem times were a bit different.  But Negros from the South came from the land, from the country people and country people were special people--they believe in being cooperative and helping each other out.  They were sweet and kind and get along.  Negros were together.  They had high standards--they set 'excellence' as a goal to reach even when digging a ditch.  Negros took pride in everything they did and intended to do their best and live up to their word so much they were honest to a fault, many of them. Negros loved their family; they loved marriage and walked as much as twenty-five miles to register their marriages after emancipation from bondage and enslavement.  Some good people.  Some sweet people.  Some determined people.  Some honest, hardworking people: most of them.  The marriage rate was high and the divorce rate was low.  The Negro woman was by her man's side through thick and thin.  The Negro woman went to the white government saying something like this: ""My husband is not asking for the world.  He needs work.  He needs a better paying job.  Please.  Just give him a job so he can feel work and feed his family like a man.  He will work hard.  He don't steal.  He'll be on-time.  He will come to work.  Please.  Just give my husband a better job and you will see.""  NOW, UNDERSTAND THIS:  She was already employed.  She was already cleaning houses and babysitting and cleaning hospitals (with excellence as her standard).  The only jobs she could get.  She worked to put bread on the table and pay the rent.  He dranked too much feeling low and not respected as a man.  He had to deal with belittlement every day and he had to not respond like his mother and grandmother taught him because he would be killed.  And he was killed: lynched often and his body burned.  When times got really bleak he left his family so she could at least get help from welfare.  NOW, ACCORDING TO HISTORY, KNOW THIS:  The doors of opportunity did crack a bit and the Negro man did get a chance here and there but most of those chances were in entertainment, the armed forces, laborous jobs, but the best came from sports, athletics, basketball and running track, playing football.  There was an entire layer of Negro aristocrats coming on: engineers, business men, some doctors, some lawyers,  some scholars, artists but the biggest money and the greatest ""bling"" was coming from boxing, football, basketball.  BUT THAT WAS GOOD, things were looking up; hope was high but then the boxers who won the big purses and the athletes with big salaries seem to marry a white woman.  Some other kind of woman, any kind, as long as she was light-skinned and had plenty of long hair.  (It seemed that he was leaving Negro women for the ""declared"" beauty in America.  BUT IT WAS NOT SO, NOT REALLY TRUE...nevertheless, out of millions of men some thousands wanted the light skin and the hair and the smaller frame body, even smaller breasts, legs and butt.  (The Trophy Wife--it's a male thang--we didn't understand.)  But, most Negro men didn't want another woman.  They wanted the Negro woman, but the sight of cross-coloring got the best of her and she became determined to make it without him:  ""I can do better by myself.""; ""I can be poor all by myself.""  But she wanted no other for her boody calls.  She wanted Negro babies.  But the ""riff"" was on.  From very sweet, loving, sweet women who worked hard for their families, they became SBW: Strong Black Women.  Outright fierce.  They could do it all--they declared.  They didn't (and don't) need him.  Yet, going toward a hundred years later she still hasn't crossed the color line to the rest of the entire planet of other males.  She gave birth to him; she wants him and him only.  They would go it alone for decades, the women, and they would say they don't need him but they never said they don't want him.  They left his side though.  He was on his own.

BY THIS TIME THE 60S HAVE HAPPENED AND THE DOORS OPENED TO A ROVING, RIVETING 70S AND A SEXUAL REVOLUTION THAT BECAME OUTRAGEOUS.  THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, THE AMERICAN CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT OF THE 60S HAD OPENED DOORS FOR EVERYONE INCLUDING WHITE MEN AND WHITE WOMEN.  Sex was on the minds of every American even the children.  Women did get jobs, some got two even three to take care of their families.  Negros were so close that all Negro children were raised in a village.  People in the neighborhood kept the kids for a woman until she got home from work.  Latch-Key was not a problem in the 50s but by the end of the 70s Negro children could not stay with anyone.  They had to stay home until their mothers got home.  People were not trustworthy.  They had sex on the brain.  People identified ""black"" and ""black"" was a militant identIty.  Negros were not militant; they were ""passive resisting"" and changed a world.
Then  'Negro' was no longer the identity and the children were no longer raised in a village.  'Black is beautiful' but she still stayed at-lengths from him.  She would still say she didn't need it, that he wasn't ready; he couldn't do it.  That he was not the man of her dreams.  Their homes were broken and he began to feel lack of hope.  The relationship between the ""black"" woman and 'black' man eroded to very low levels.  Even when she had a good man she was talking bad about him to her girlfriends.  The new century and miliennia opened its doors with a rip-roaring sexual revoltuion; gays wanted their civil rights and they wanted their civil rights to marry.  Women wanted to own their body and they wanted the right to say  ""no"" and have it respected: ""No means stop.""  Women were going to college in droves and ""black"" men were going to jail. Black women followed them to jails and prisons: (letters, packages, phones, money in their accounts), and visits with the children, trying to have a relationship with black men and trying to give them a chance to parent their male children.  The bond between the sexes eroded even further.  The black woman gained a new name: ""bitches and hoes"".  Pornographic sex became as normal as apple pie and ''any woman worth having'' gave her man oral sex often if not continuously.  Black women gained another name: sluts, bitches, 'hoes, and so on.  The identity became African American but that name had a hard time to catch on because ""black"" seemed so right.  These people were all-Americans but they are still called a ""minority"" in their own country.  They are relegated to be ""black"" so they can never be ""white"".  The intent is clear that they are still considered ""third class""  or no class at all: Just Here, and just something white society has to deal with: gradually, over time.  SOME people in the country feel that way, not all.  So hope remains.  Mothers taught their daughters to not have children before they married to save their virginity and go to college.  Women went to college in droves and got degrees; guys didn't; they often dropped out.  THIS WAS, AND IS, THE TIME OF THE WOMAN.  She has a good job.  She has a really nice car.  She lives in a very nice neighborhood in a nice place or she owns her home and is keeping up the mortgage payment.  She has her own fur coat because she bought it and she has her diamond rings and she can afford to buy her weave, her suits, coats -- her healthcare and expensivie tickets to shows.  She goes on cruises, tries sky-diving and air-plane piloting.  She has a dental plan, and a retirement plan.  She will live this way always.  She has beautiful children.  A beautiful life. Can afford good childcare.  She reads books, she check the stock market and she loves GOD and looks good at church every Sunday.  She sleeps on the best mattresses.  Her house is well-stocked;  she has nice furniture.  She has everything she wants and she's worked hard for it herself but she does not have the MAN of her dream.  She does not have Mr. Right.  And what does she want with him?  She says, she wants HIM to love her....to adore her...yes! and feel proud of all she has accomplished by herself.  Yes.  Love her.  Be so glad he's got such a great woman he will love her and appreciate her but she can't find that man.  She can't find Mr. Right.  She doesn't want anybody else but Mr. Right, the man of her dreams....because she is soooooo deserving of her dream man....!  She deserves the best; she wants the best....and she wants all of her dreams to come true, true, true.  When she thinks she has found him the first words that come out of her mouth is: ""This is my house.  This is my car.  I worked for this.  You're just here for a visit.  I can get what I want when I want it.  I don't need you.""  And she is called a bitch and a whore and she is abandoned.  And again she concludes: ""I don't need that in my life.  I want a man who is proud of me and appreciates me because I deserve to be appreciated.  Look at what I accomplished on my own.""  But there are millions and millions, as much as sixty-five percent of ""black"" men out there who do not want a college-educated, high-earning woman.  They feel they have to ""yield"" their manhood to her and become her boy-toy.  They feel they can't be her leader, her commander, her savior, her hero, her master, her man.  He wants her to yield to him.  She wants her on her knees crawling to him: needing him and wanting no other man tham him AND she is to want nor dream of having no more than he gives and provides for her.  He doesn't want her to believe in herself and feel she is intelligent and can figure things out just like him.  He wants her to think of him as the only one who knows, as the only one who can do.  He wants her to live the life he wants to live and the life he provides and dream of no other.  He yearns to hear her say: ""I need you so; I can't live without you; my life is nothing without you.""  But instead, he is hearing:  ""I just want some dick tonight.  Can you come over/?""

Many of the males (and men) will say it clearly: ""Put that book down now or I'll walk out that door.  Git in that kitchen and fix me something to eat.""  But today, she'll  walk out of that door, get into her car, take her ownself to dinner, and then go to the library and get her studies done and meet a handsome guy there and think about cheating on her relationship or her marriage because she has decided to leave it anyway.

THEIR STORY BEGAN SO SWEET, SO SYRUPY SWEET....now that's the truth.  Will African Americans get things together better than what we saw in this film where women were easily referred to as ""bitches and whores"" or they referred to themselves as ""eye candy"" or ""royalty"".  Meaning, marriage  is not that important to them, not as important as their next hair appointment.  Am I talking about women?  NO.  I'm talking about life.  Young women and men are out there having a blast!!!  Life, well LIVING could be sooooo good, so much fun, so marvelous, so care-free if young men and women didn't have to deal with their sexuality.  BACK IN THE 50S, when people didn't know that much about sex (and pleasurable sex) people were married for marriage sake but there was a twist: People had more 'god"" in their marriage and people had more love and responsibility and SACRIFICE...they even sacrifice good-time pleasurable sex for the good of their family and to obey their covenant with GOD.  They did not have to know much about sex and pleasures.  Only in backrooms was such discussed.  But now, people talk about such things and plan such things at church.  Women had to marry men (not males) men: responsible, hardworking people they had to be, to  be called a MAN....so women got a great benefit from marriage then: food, rent, and 'bonding' that seemed like love and devotion.

 [THAT WAS A REALLY DUMB WOMAN who thought her husband was weak because he was civilized.  She thought herself special, but she was far from special when she ran her meal-ticket off.  Yeah.  DUMB WOMAN!!!  Dumb, young woman  but not a whore or bitch.]  All in this film was about an ""ethnicity"" trying to reset itself 'in' present-day values.  That's always very hard and confusing.  But they'll get it together eventually.--  MO",1444435200,,14184,4.488819144762652

If there is a divide between black men and black women that forces black men to date outside their race (apparently the film's sole theme) then surely some of the cause rests with both sides. This film seeks to place all the blame at the feet of black women, without taking the time to do any serious examination about what might make black women as angry and aggressive as this film wants them to appear. It's lazy to lump an entire race of women together as if they all share one personality, and then make a cheesy, finger-pointing film to tell them how unappealing that personality is.

3681271,4,B001L67A46,It made some very good points.,1440201600,,30,4.166666666666667
3681272,1,B001L67A46,"Wow.  I just watched the opening sequence and a snippet of the ""YouTube video sensation that started it all.""  I've seen enough!  The women were rude, vulgar and used the ""N"" word at least 3 times in about two minutes (if that). Yeah, I agree with reviewers that see the ""filmaker's"" point of view as extremely biased.  Not up for a bunch of swearing, vulgar, potty-mouthed language and ridiculous, overly biased conversations that make all black women look like psychos.

For the record, not every black woman has that annoying attitude portrayed in most Tyler Perry films (and the 2 minutes I just watched).  It's so embarrassing and inaccurate.  In my family, yes, we do have some personalities that reflect this attitude, but there's a whole group of us that are nothing like that.  I guess that's what sells, because our culture seems to lap it up.  NEWS FLASH:  there are many women of color that grew up in the suburbs (SHOCKER!!!) or diverse neighborhoods and don't walk around with a chip on their shoulder.  As well, if you look at the four temperaments, it's clearly impossible to have that many women in one culture with the same temperament (choleric = pushy, controlling, type A, etc.).  The choleric woman is found in every ethnicity under the sun.  So yes, if you have a choleric AA woman that had a very intense childhood and perhaps came from a single parent home, was abused, etc., you're going to get some major attitude, but it's not because she's an ""Angry Black Woman"" it's because she's a broken black woman that happens to have a choleric temperament.

Learning about the temperaments was a fascinating study for me and helped me to understand, better communicate with and accept people in a way I never thought possible.  I believe we would do well to learn about temperaments at a young age, in order to better embrace the wonderful differences we have and how beautifully they compliment one another.  A woman (or man) who tends to be on the quiet side, might be described as a deep-thinker, homebody, etc., likely has a melancholy temperament, which means she's naturally drained by people (shout out to my fellow introverts!) and may need to work herself up for a night out with the girls, or even spending time with her guy.  A woman who is super chill/easy going isn't always a pushover, it's possible she's phlegmatic, which means she tends to be a peacemaker, and a great listener who's not very extroverted.  Now, the choleric woman is super driven, sometimes controlling, vocal about her wants/needs... she will get what she desires at any cost.  The sanguine is a very bubbly and outgoing woman who loves to be the center of attention and floats from here to there, never wanting to miss out on anything.  You see, God created us uniquely, with different temperaments that were meant to help us build on each others strengths (By the way, most of us have a combination of at least two of these temperaments, with one being predominant).

Anywhoo, I can't say I'd recommend this ""film.""  There are just too many of these stereotypical hot messes going around these days.  I recommend you read a book about the four temperaments (or Google it, WIki, etc.), learn more about yourself, how to better communicate with others and build on this.  The world will be a better place if we would stop lumping groups together and assuming the worst because of past experiences.  We have come too far in this world to behave this way.  Our ancestors would be ashamed.  :O(",1440115200,,3496,4.735537190082645

3681397,4,B001L67A46,"This movie is done documentary-style, but is not really a documentary. The film sets out to expose and explain why many Black men are tired of the destructive dynamic that exists in too many married or dating relationships with Black women. Some of the problem is conscious, some is unconscious and most is systemic. The material is put forth in an entertaining, informative way that to me tries to be even-handed. Keep in mind, that this is from a men's perspective. That said, even many Black woman (and other races, ethnicities) in the film agree that what Black men are complaining about actually exists.
The story follows one couple most closely, married 4 years with a young daughter. They are a professional couple, solidly middle class. In contrast, there are a range of other ages and classes depicted, and none are immune to the destructive dynamic. Finally, the young man--James--walks out in disgust (no spoiler here), leaving a stunned (clueless really) wife to her own devices while the situation is examined from many perspectives.
Ok, so this is really more educational that entertaining, but it does expose a serious problem, makes recommendations at several solutions and leaves the viewer to his/her own opinion. It's very well done; easy to watch; not preachy. Really it's a plea for awareness, love and reform.",1428019200,,1331,5.027149321266968

Why men get tired. The movie wasn't about relationships in a whole. So there's no bais. It's goes in depth on why some men get tired.

3681460,2,B001L67A46,"I often ask myself why are there no documentaries on the happy couples in the black community? If they do exist please point me in the right direction. People view life how they see themselves and that can hinder a person's ability to be objective. People believe that their bad/ good experiences prove everything they need to know about one thing or another. I think people make the mistake of believing that certain problems are exclusive to one race. When I look at a couple with problems I don't see black or white problems. They're just problems and they exist all around you. If your mind is stuck on color and you feel that your experiences make your opinion fact or absolute, you will never see that these problems exist in other races as well. I do believe in cause and effect, in order to get to the root of any problem you first have to be honest with yourself. This is why some problems will never be resolved because there is no balance of honest self-evaluation and responsibility. I agree that certain issues should be addressed, saying that a problem is all one gender's fault is a flawed opinion. Any problematic attitude, behavior, habit has a source. Male/ female are responsible for their choices. If you choose to ignore warnings signs of a bad mate you will suffer the consequences. I saw a preview for the next movie and the daughter is very disrespectful. I understand that some bitter mothers pour bitterness into their daughters. Now I see fathers pouring resentment for black females into their sons. Are black men/ women looking for a path to healing or destruction? I am a black woman married to a wonderful black man for 11 years and counting. If I had the finances and the connections to make a documentary about healthy black relationships and marriages I would. Normally I would focus on healthy marriages in general, but it seems there is warfare going on between black men/ women. Our youth should see healthy examples of relationships. People don't realize this, but it is a small minority of jaded black men/ women waging war on each other. However, those who scream the loudest usually draw the most attention and are usually the biggest hypocrites. A hypocrite with a platform is the worse kind! Remember, no one can tell you how to get somewhere they have never been. So I hear there will be a DOTBM 2 & 3, the daughter will run into father issues and relationship issues. While I feel that parents using kids to get back at their ex is an issue worth addressing. Keeping a on sided narrative really limits the potential to reach both male/ female to inspire change. Continuing the image of male perfection, no change, self-evaluation on how he ended up with these unfortunate circumstances is very unrealistic. It continues to send the message that one gender is the problem and only the female is required to change. There is no solution in that and ultimately the movies will be viewed as the writer/ director needed to vent.",1414368000,,2968,4.687739463601533
3681461,4,B001L67A46,"The title was a dead give-away that balance and an unbiased story was not likely and that is just fine.  This movie/documentary was insightful as we don't often get to hear things from a black man's point of view. As a half black, half white woman, it is time that we all give up being angry. Nobody is benefiting and we are just setting up our kids to follow in our footsteps.

This is not just a black community thing. There are plenty of angry white women who would give angry black women a run for their money. If you went to any poor community across this country you will find more than a few angry women and men who are angry at women. I also suspect that the people who ranted in their reviews were too absorbed in anger to get the message that both men and women need to stop being angry and start doing what is right. They need to teach their sons and daughters the right way to treat others, women and men. Our children need to be taught to not tear down others as the so-called friends in this film did.  And if parents are unwilling to teach these lessons, then the community needs to step in.

From my white mother, I learned that all men were worth less than dog droppings and that if I wanted to have anything in life, my legs needed to be open more than 7-11. Thankfully, I had strong black men and women as well as strong men and women of other ethnicities around me that stood firm and said 'NO this is not how to behave.'

Mr. Alexander makes good points as do the people interviewed on situations that are all to common not only in the black communities, but in every lower income, lower opportunity community across the US.

3681484,4,B001L67A46,"I had to make sure that i watched this movie completely after i saw the initial 3 minute clip that started this movie off. The movie had more false within the truth and I am not surprising.  I feel like this is a movie that all black men and women should watch this movie, but I am waiting to see Diary of a Tried Black Woman.  You have numerous men all of the world who state black women are angry, which is incorrect.  You want to consider black women angry because we are independent, because we have a voice and not one that is abusing you are being outspoken but because women chose to not let men just get away with anything then we are considered angry.  Seriously!!  You want call a woman anger because she is submissive 100% and being whipping board or your maid. I found that this movie was insult to black woman because we are not angry, we are all not carrying baggage from one relationship to another, and you have women who are independent out here, and you have women out here who are working and holding down the household just like their partner and then come home and handling the business is the household as well and you want to act like the woman is not supposed to be tired as well. I looked at Tonya and yes there are women out here who have a good man and they don't drop the baggage from their past and they take it to the next.  She act like she wanted him to do to her what she saw her mom be treated.  as a single parent i felt it was disrespect to those that have raised children along, who didn't dog out the dead beat parent to the child because this is something that they learn on their own as they get older.  My son didn't have his biological father there , so i made sure that he was surrounded by positive role models and yes i would be lying if i said he didn't have some  problem because his father wasn't there but he has turned into a positive black male which is a plus.  I felt that the young lady said this is more of human issue was correct.

I noticed too that it focused alot of women that are single, but what about the ones that are married or in long term relationships that give their all to what has been drummed into their head is how things are supposed to be and not all but so many lose their identiy of the person that they became , they become unhappy, depressed, communication no longer exist, and of course they are forced to hold their anger inside because they longer realize they have a voice and some endure dometic violence as we saw in the video believing its their fault.  I know what the title is but part of why alot o women are mad is because angry, controlling, and men that thing they are king took a good woman and made her into this angry woman.  took her to the point of where she reached enough is enough and she fails to realize to clean out the closet, let loose the baggage of the old before she steps into something new so that new relationship can have a better change of not being just a reason or a season, but nothing is a sure thing no matter what you do.",1408838400,,3040,4.140916808149406

3681544,2,B001L67A46,"I see other reviewers calling this film a ""documentary.""  I'm not sure if some poorly acted, badly scripted 3-5 minute vignettes inserted interspersed with on-the-street interviews about what's wrong with Black women in their relationships could be classified as a documentary.  I didn't read the summary before I began watching this, so when this ""film"" cut to some YouTube video 5 minutes in that ""started it all,"" I really didn't know what was happening.

This film follows a loose storyline of a trouble married couple, the wife and antagonist playing a hyper-stereotypical angry-black-woman role, and the husband serving as the i'm-a-good-black-man-with-a-crazy-woman protagonist. We the viewer watch a variety of scripted ""shorts"" where we see Wife argue, kick, scream, and spit, while publicly maligning her Husband.  And then the film cuts to random, mostly Black people on the streets of major US cities who, having viewed the same short we just watched, provide their commentary.

This film fails whatever genre it might fit into by failing to provide one key element...a coherent statement about what it wants to say.  The shorts are biased enough against Black women that the feedback provided by the folk on the streets is tainted.  Pitted against a flawless husband, the film's writer/director ultimately demonizes Black women by imbuing the wife with so many negative attributes that you as the viewer have no sympathy for the wife and you question whether the filmmaker is deliberating attempting to portray Black women as self-centered, irresponsible, and unreasonable -- because that is how not just the scripted wife, but also many of the Sistas on the street, sound in their comments.

While the film is not a complete waste of time, it severely swerves from any type of balanced portrayal of a typical marriage-gone-bad situation (if there is such a thing).  The mere fact that the husband is cast as an African-looking/sounding Caribbean-American instead of a ""regular"" African-American male has the typical African-American viewer struggling to compare apples to apples, and not watch the characters' relationship through the unique lens through which that community views a African man/Black woman relationship. i.e. African man does NOT equal African American man.

Lastly, while this film is no serious attempt to answer the question, ""Why can't Black couples just get along,"" the failure of even one interviewee to acknowledge not only the racism, but also the sexism, that Black women must endure on a daily basis seems to indicate that many folk in the Black community have no idea what's a root cause of some of the anger Black women possess.  How about this?  Life is tough for Black women.  In the US, they reside on the lowest rung of the socio-economic ladder and as a whole are the least valued in American culture.  Many Black women are or have been abused, discriminated against, or simply ignored in their schools, their churches, their workplaces, and their homes -- sometimes at the hands of Black men.  So it's no wonder that ""Sistas"" want to be loved, protected, admired, and esteemed like other, non-black women.  But often, they are are not.  So yeah, I'd be angry too under those circumstances.  But ""Diary of a Tired Black Man"" starts and ends with this erroneous thesis -- It's Black women's fault that Black men are so tired.  That's a lie.",1392595200,2,3388,5.094032549728753

We still do today. Some of the interviews were a bit corny but I think it's a fresh update on the issue that everyone needs to be informed about. Yes it is hard to find a good partner these days period but if you are black american the odds are stacked against you even more obviously.

To be honest it's a state of the nation type thing. You just have to have it even if it seems repetitive at times, because there is always a new angle that needs to be examined.

3681593,4,B001L67A46,"This movie is not nearly so over the top as some reviewers say, but obviously it pushed some buttons.  That it poked fun (and at men too, and the dating game in general, not just women) while at the same time addressing heartfelt issues made it harder to ""read"" than most straightforward documentaries.  The inclusion of dramatic sketches, sometimes with pretty nutty behavior, made it look even less like a serious documentary with a unified and singularly focused vision. So then, what was it supposed to be?  It wasn't a paint-by-numbers presentation.  It didn't endeavor to keep itself out of trouble; in both subject matter and presentation, it took risks.

But it wasn't trying to be rigorous in the way a tight-collared upper-crusty BBC documentary with a controlled and dour narrator reading off a committee-approved script would be.  It was an exploration, through hyperbole, drama, street interviews, and just plain shooting the breeze in the barbershop, of sexual and racial issues.  Many could just as easily be applied to any race or ethnicity, which makes this film resonate more than it might have and be of broader interest.

Have fun with it, and don't hold yourself to agreeing or disagreeing with every point, and you'll likely enjoy it.  Pretty much every view gets taken to an absurd limit at some point in the movie before the movie bounces back again into the next thought from a more reasonable person (or from a reasonable person who didn't get caught out so obviously going off the deep end), and even interviewees who initially seem strident often show their more human side as the interview goes on.  That's part of what humanizes it from a monotonous rant into something more fun and interesting.

There are few interviewees in this flick that I didn't wind up liking in the end, definitely including all the women.  Many were very funny; almost all were very sympathetic.  Everyone here seemed, well ... nice, if that word hasn't fallen too far out of fashion.  There really wasn't aggressive and negative interrupting of female interviewees to speak of, contrary to what some others reviews assert.  So this movie isn't a hatchet job or a bunch of angry whining from sour and bitter men.  It is one of those films that will put some people on pins and needles -- but isn't that one of the things good documentaries are best at, and one of the things they're for?  And, frankly, don't some (or all) of us deserve that at least once in a while?  Especially the oversensitive types?  You'll probably have a few laughs if you see the flick and be entertained throughout.

The movie will anger Black women accustomed to assuming all Black males are ""no good"" but it goes a long way into showing that a lot of women out there make bad choices in their men and then turn around and blame all Black males as if we are causing the problems.

3681602,2,B001L67A46,"had there been any balance in this film, i could have spared a few more stars.  as it is, this is nothing more than tim alexander's big chance to share with us his distaste for black women.  pitting a truly good man against a crazy woman for this kind of documentary was a very bad idea.  actually, there was something objectionable about the personalities of most of the characters portrayed by actresses.  the guys, on the other hand, all come off looking like beaten down, beleaguered ""good men"" who've been done wrong by their shrewish lovers.  almost none of the men who appeared in this film had anything good to say about black women.

i noticed that whenever a woman said things that didn't mesh with the interviewer's opinion, he was quick to ask, his voice oozing judgement, ""do YOU have a man?""  a woman who doesn't have a man isn't necessarily without one because she nags or puts men down.  we're supposedly in the wrong if we stay with a man who isn't right for us or denigrated if we refuse to get involved with a man who doesn't meet our needs or to whom we're not attracted.  we're either too picky or not picky enough.  and there's certainly something wrong with a woman who helps her man out when he's in need but ends up getting screwed because he sees her as weak and a patsy.  whatever choice a black woman makes, it will be seen by someone else as a bad choice.

this documentary doesn't hold men and women to the same standards.  women are criticized for having children with more than one man, but i don't recall hearing the same criticism of a man who has randomly sprinkled his seed from one end of the country to the other and has more kids than he can count, let alone support.  furthermore, if so many children are being raised in single-parent (mother only) homes, which is pinpointed again and again as one cause of the ""angry black woman syndrome"", it could be because the men know they don't have to stay if they don't want to.

it was mentioned several times that tonya's friends should not have been involved in her relationship with james.  these women were not always in favor of the way she handled her marriage, but the negative aspects of their opinions always took center stage.  still, it was because of their friendship that one woman narrowly escaped being beaten to a pulp by her man.  sometimes a woman's girlfriends are her only link to sanity and her only source of strength.  this isn't to say that such involvement is always right, but it certainly isn't always wrong.

i was intrigued by mr alexander's definition of ""strong black woman"", a term i have come to hate for my own reasons.  to him, it means, ""i can give you grief and you can't shut me up and i'm gonna wear you down until you just wanna hit me"".  is this a clue to the character traits of the women with whom he's been involved?  if so, he should consider this:  black women were, several times, accused of making bad choices and ""attracting"" the wrong kind of man, which can only be translated to mean that if her man's a jerk it's her fault.  but the male interviewees who made these claims were not all chosen by their women.  most of them scoped those women out and got what they wanted based on what was important to them at the time, usually looks, status, financial gain or sex.  maybe mr alexander needs to take note of that and be more discriminating in his own choices.  as a result, he might be a better filmmaker.

the editing process for this documentary probably eliminated lots of intelligent input from black women, and even black men, who have a healthier understanding of why we are the way we are.  maybe mr alexander will put those together for a different story when he calms down.

3681604,1,B001L67A46,"This movie is misogynist and degrades black women. It really feels as if the filmmaker had a bad relationship with a black woman and then decided to make a movie about it, interviewing people to support his misogynist views. I've never heard of someone blaming their partner's race and gender for their failed relationship, but that's clearly what the film conveys. Personally, I think most of the issues he addresses in this film can be traced to just poor communication - something that can ruin any relationship.

The director was less interested in having an open dialogue than having a one-way rant about black women. The series of vingettes woven throughout the film are exaggerated and offensive in their stereotyping black women and portrayal of black men as passive victims of black female aggresion. No substantive analysis occurs, though a few of the interviewees (maybe 3 or 4) make some really insightful points that slightly challenged the director's point of view. But instead of delving further into these points - which the filmmaker should have done - he chooses to just gloss over it, re-direct the discussion to blaming black women, and continue the bland, repetitive cycle of ""black women need to do this"" and ""black women need to do that."" The filmmaker clearly wasn't interested in having his views challenged. You can hear him in the background as he is interviewing people on the street. His line of questioning is leading, biased, and (at times) overly aggressive and forces the interviewees (both men and women) to concede that black women have ""issues."" No where in the film does anyone talk about the trials and tribulations that black women face, though plenty of discussion is given to ""how hard it is to be a black man"" - as if black women are immune to things like racism, too, as well as sexism. The film doesn't address sexism/misogyny in the black community that may contribute to black female anger in the first place. Instead, the filmmaker reinforces hetero-normative patriarchal views in his talk of black women making bad decisions and their emotions needing to be controlled. Who is he or any other man to tell black women what they need to do?

Watching this film made me feel ashamed that such trash is being peddled in the name of offering a ""black man's perspective."" I'm a black man and I think this movie is crap.",1322179200,7,2361,4.841584158415841

3681607,4,B001L67A46,"If I were to judge DOATBM on the acting or script alone, I woudln't rate it very highly but the subject matter alone and the word-on-the-street commentaries, make this worth watching.  the protagonist is James, an respectable architect who, at first, is married to Tanya, a beautiful, but very difficult woman whose mission in life seems to be to make James' life as miserable as possible.  In between the situations the couple find themselves is commentary among men and women across the country and their opinions on black male/female relationships.  If nothing else, the movie and commentary are thought provoking and need to be heard.

  Those who complain about how black women are portrayed, think about how black men have felt after nearly four decades of ""Waiting to Exhale"" type books, Oprah (who I happen to admire), issues of ""Essence,"" ""Ebony"" and other publications telling black women to date outside the race because there aren't enough good black men as well as making us out to be deadbeat dads, cheaters, on the down low and just downright incorrigible.  Some say that this movie is playing tit for tat but I disagree.  You can't sit idly by and be bashed without, at least, wanting to issue a rebuttal.  There are two sides to every story and this is simply one way of telling ours.  Certain black women are always telling us that if we're not the kind of brother who's being maligned that we shouldn't take offense but are obviously refusing to take their own advice.  DOATBM is far from being a solution to the black male/female conflict but it is certainly a worthy catalyst for dialog if you watch with an open mind.",1314057600,6,1639,4.756183745583039
3681608,1,B001L67A46,"I only watched this through because half an hour in I decided to write a review and wanted to be sure my point wasn't disproved later in the video, so that I wouldn't write something unfounded. Wish I had saved another hour of my life, because the more I watched the more clear it became that yes indeed this video is:

1) a completely one-sided presentation of a very complex issue (relationships among members of historically oppressed groups who have attained some integration, but are still impacted by a history of oppression and continuing discrimination);
2) so set up with comments edited and commentators baited that it is almost laughable. (""I find black American women... to be..."" ""Angry?"" ""... yes, some of them are angry."") I really have to wonder about the intellectual level of anyone who doesn't see the bias, because it is pretty heavy-handed bias.
3) an utter failure at delving into the interplay between men and women or within various parts of the African-American culture (and yes, it is not a monolithic culture, but a set of different ones, just like white people have more than one cultural community). Forget about dealing with different aspects of black culture, it doesn't even address the interplay between men and women. Instead everything is that either the woman is the problem because she doesn't appreciate good men or the woman is the problem because she chooses and then stays with bad men. Men of course have no responsibility, so should just forget about these troublesome black women and focus on women of other races, who know how to... well... not be like black women, whatever that means.

I could go on, but basically, this movie was pretty much just Tim Alexander getting some resentment off his chest, apparently based on some bad relationships he had with women who happened to be black. Sure, in general it is easier to date people who don't come from a history of oppression in their community and don't face racial barriers now. And there is a lot to learn from inter-racial dating. But the video doesn't explore any of that. Instead the choice to date inter-racially is presented as a ""so there."" Really, is this junior high? Are we deciding our most important life relationships based on trying to send a juvenile message?

As a black woman, I definitely have learned a lot by dating men who aren't black, and hope that men and women of all races get to benefit from such cross-cultural relationships. But that interest in non-black men isn't coming from an idea that there is something wrong with black men  that I need to escape from. For example, in general the non-black men I've dated have had happier childhoods and easier adulthoods, and that makes a huge difference in terms of how easy it is to share happiness with them now. I've learned how to be a happier person who expects the best from life by dating men who grew up with no reason not to see the world that way. But does that mean black men are a problem I need to get out of my life because they've grown up being stopped by the police and seeing women cross the street to avoid passing them on the sidewalk at night? Am I supposed to be a tired black woman, who just wants a happy-go-lucky guy to lift my mood at the end of a hard day? Sorry, instead I'm a happy black woman who takes responsibility for her own happiness and dates men without regard to race.

I truly feel sorry for anyone who takes the ideas in this video as instructive of how to relate romantically, because woe is them if they do. The only thing to take from this is that some men, like the maker of this film, blaim women for all their problems and are so insecure in that position that they feel the need to rove the country and film a manipulated presentation of lots of people agreeing with them in order to shore up their flimsy belief system.

There are problems in relationships between people throughout the human family, and there is a lot to learn from all angles. One-dimensional representations that take a fragment of the truth then blow it all out of proportion merely distort that picture to a point where it does more harm than good. The only thing worse than not understanding something is not understanding, but thinking you do.",1313280000,43,4238,4.628989361702128
3681609,1,B001L67A46,"Horrible!  Firstly, what was this?!  It could not rightly be classified as a documentary or a movie.  The piece begins with a clip about a woman upset with her ex-husband for being in an interracial relationship.  Then it flips to random people on the street to get their opinion of the clip. And that is how the entire piece went; a constant series of fights between the couple, followed by on-the-street commentary.  My second problem with the piece was the one-dimensionality of the female character.  She was always angry and upset.  No one is ever that one dimensional.  There are many facets to human character, ups, downs, highs, lows.  Even an angry person has various facets to their personality.",1309305600,5,705,4.857142857142857

It had some good points but was not agreeing with the display of black women complaining and blaming everyone but themselves. I understand the fact that a lot of women hold on these grudges and build those high-walled guards to men because of the voids in their hearts when it comes to men; some didn't have a supportive father to be the man in her life to mold her into some understanding about men. And some just have thier personal issues, opinions that may not make any sense to have a reason wear the ""Men aint #@$""! sign. I understand the men on this one but I didn't like how this documentary embrace the fact that MAYBE its the women. this was a finger-pointing documentary and what no one talked about was how people need to check themselves when it comes to having what you need rather than what you want.

3681611,1,B001L67A46,"This was unbelievably bad!! First the film has acting in it. This would be fine if the acted relationships weren't such ridiculous set ups!
A black man who works hard and is loyal to his black wife, puts her in a mansion and  gives her a $$$$ car, but comes home to find her yelling at him and breaking up their perfect home.[Huh?] What fairy tale is this? Why is she bitchin'? Because she is a black woman and is stupid and ungrateful and has a truckload of bitter black female friends filling her head with lies for fun. They FORCE this black man (who loves his child and wants to raise it) to leave his black wife and date white women. There you have it! The REAL reason why over 70% of black kids grow up fatherless (including Pres. Obama and Rev Jesse Jackson and his love child) and why black men seek out relationships with women with lighter skin and longer, straighter hair. Its not their skin and hair. These women are just happen to be nicer and more supportive.
Yea! Those are the facts and the issues. Not black males' having high rates of infidelity (with HIV/STD). Not the high rates of POVERTY for black kids due to them living with only one parent to work and raise them. Or the high rates of imprisonment, violence, and underemployment of black males with a high rate of interracial dating and marriage (for black men with higher incomes).
Even the street scenes were set ups. The film maker interviewed only those saying what he was trying to promote. There was no debate. He selected segments that were perfect for his argument and did it so obviously that it was silly. The filmmaker frequently talks during street interviews goading the women he wants to serve up as examples of ""the problem""- into saying more of what he wants them to say. The filmaker cuts them off or repeats the comment he wants. He allows the ""good"" black women to speak. At one point the film maker actually cuts off a dark skinned black woman who is talking about black men's preference for light skinned women and starts screaming over her ""they're the enemy...they're the enemy..."" while pointing at 2 light skin women. He never allows the darker woman to make her point. He never acknowledges that black men have long preferred women with light skin and long hair. Instead, the film maker constructs a set plays and street scenes that ""prove"" that this is a myth a figment of the imagination of dark skinned black women who have low self esteem or are jealous of light skinned women.
This film is not informative. Its a propoganda film.
There is no film here (just propaganda with bad acting) and no documentary (just edits of people saying what the filmaker want to represent).
Anyone could do this to support any point of view! Using this method you could make a docu-film proving 2 COMPLETELY OPPOSING beliefs are true.

I feel that every black man, and women should see this movie to hopefully try to resolve some of the issue that go on between the two. There is a civial war between black men and women. Allot of which can be rooted in willie lynch ect...

But what people need to understand is allot of it has to do with what children are taught. You should never teach/pass on baggage from past experiences, or too hate in this case black men or women based off your own experience, but allow your children to have there own experiences.

The discussion can really get deep, but ill cut it short and say

Get the movies watch it, pass it own. definately recommended, and essential for black people to see some resolve in black men and women relations.",1301788800,5,1005,4.273684210526316

In order for Humans to better relate to one another it is important for us to consider how the man and the woman are to two complete parts of the Human design that are completed when the are united. This unification cannot be coheasive if we allow outside influences, (Friends, associates, family memenbers, etc.), to interfere with the cleaving process. The world as deceived men and women into believing our unity is not important and influenced us to run away when the uncomfortabilities that contribute to the growth of our relationships arrise. It is my personal view that this condition amist us exits because we don't acknowledge how important we are to each others growth and developement. We have been created in the image and formed in the likeness of our Creator and being that our Creator has done such a magnificient work with us, what magnificient works must we be able to do being that we are like our Creator.

3681618,4,B001L67A46,"I think this is a film to be shared with friends, intimate and otherwise, for discussion and commentary. I found the piece to be funny,insightful and thought provoking.

At which point did inappropriate behavior become the accepted norm in the American and world culture alike?  For me, the inability to relate to people in an intelligent and meaningful way is likely to be present in all of ones relationships not just the intimate ones. This is an issue that is not solely representative of women of color. In fact, it crosses color lines and further still socioeconomic classes. At times, the film was hilarious because I couldn't believe/stomach the behavior depicted here and at other times it fell flat because it missed opportunities for further discussion.

If we are so concerned about dysfunctional relationships and the behavior associated therewith, it's high time we examine our own behavior(s)and find ways to remedy the problems. When one points a finger at someone, there are four others pointing back at you. If this is a common theme in your relationships should we not ask what the common denominator is? Examine your own behavior as people in glass houses should not throw stones. On the other hand; when you see crazy coming, cross the street.",1280102400,,1264,4.981042654028436
3681619,1,B001L67A46,"Firstly, let me just assert that I felt this movie/documentary had some very valid points. However, my biggest disagreement with this movie is the fact that it was promoted as a movie and not a documentary. Okay, it was clear, the producer was very upset (angry) at the many African-American genre movies that depict Black males in a negative view; for instance Waiting to Exhale and Diary of a Mad Black Woman(Written by a black man might I add). So in turn, he creates a documentary to refute stories that aren't even real life?....As if to assert to that because the movies (capitalism) say that Black men are evil, real black women feel the same? I guess I should create a documovie about how all black men want to do is watch black women romp shake and call out whores and  black Bi#@$es on a video. I, however, am an intelligent black woman; I know how to separate fact from fiction.

Second disagreement with the ""movie"" is that it is overwhelmingly biased. I really didn't see the author's point. Was he trying to create more understanding and communication within black relationships? He thought he could do so by gallivanting through the streets starting arguments with random black women that he didn't even know, then editing to expose those that appeared most angry...hence proving his point that all Black Women are angry. I would have loved to be a fly on that wall in that editing room.

Thirdly, the venting of the black men throughout the movie was structured and self-defeating to the point of the whole movie.  Okay, so you want to prove that black women are angry because of past relationships by having black men vent about all the problems they've had in past relationships with black women? One word: WOW! In fact, one valid point made by a young African-American woman and man is that these problems are not a gender or race specific problem, they are a human problem.  If anyone carries baggage from a past relationship or childhood into a new relationship, problems will occur.

In addition, the point that the author tried to make about black women passing up a ""good"" black man because he was ""boring"" or too ""friendly"", sorry Sir, I know personally that this goes both ways. I am a single black women with two advanced degrees, working on a third, (Drum-roll...believe it or not) I am a virgin with no children or baby daddies. I was raised with a strong Christian faith to believe that men were the head and to respect my future husband.  Am I a ""good"" black woman? However, seems the black men (my preference) I meet often pass me up because I am guess what....TOO BORING.  All the while the baby mamas, tattooed broads, ignorant heifers with an attitude get snapped up like gold.  Let's face it, black men love an attitude. Deep down they feel it synonymous with an aggressive (freaky) sex drive.  Then two years later when that ""attitude"" backfires into a stale nagging black woman...You're TIRED. Maybe the reason that the black men in the movie and the author have had the experiences they've had is because of ""poor relationship decisions."" Oops did I just use the authors own words? But I digress; guess I just have ""Angry Black Woman Syndrome."" Maybe I'm being stereotypical...lol.

As far as the black men running to another race card.....SO OVER IT!  Please come again when I actually care.  I believe the author could've have made more progress with his supposed mission by making the movie a black family issue....not a black woman issue. You can't attack one factor of the problem and feel as though you will solve the whole puzzle.  Not the mark of a true journalist.

3681622,5,B001L67A46,"What I saw in this film was an honest and balance observation of the dysfunctional dynamic that has been playing out between African-American men and women since slavery.  But this time, the notion that adults, both male and female, should feel the obligation to act responsibly.  The parallels between this docudrama and my own life experience are too close for me to be totally objective.  But finally, the elephant that has been standing in the living room for far too long is being addressed.

For far too long, in America generally and the African-American subculture particularly, irresponsible behavior is too acceptable.  Irresponsible behavior is considered more acceptable from women than men.  From the PMS defense in the murder trial of 30 plus years ago through today, women have more easily been able to blame their bad choices on something that others around them did.  Unfortunately, the phrase ""strong Black woman"" has become a euphemism of selfish verbally abusive and sometimes violent bullying behavior.  Behavior that should not be excused by anyone.  Most movies I have seen re-enforce these irresponsible attitudes.  This movie challenges it.

Everyone should see this movie.  The well-being of all following generations is at stake.  In the face of radical individualism in personal behavior leading to irresponsible obstructionism in government, irresponsible management practices in the private section and irresponsible pronouncement in our religious communities, this film should be viewed in its larger context.",1275004800,2,1540,5.47457627118644

First critique I wished that the film maker would have not just focused on what a woman with ""Angry Black Woman Syndrome"" looks like. But what a woman without looked like. Would have liked to actually see the main character find the ""good"", ""strong"" woamn that was for him.

The interviews were interesting. Hey we all have our opinions but (2nd critique) just like the film maker ask the women hard questions I wished he had asked some of the opionated ""good"" men did they make choices to cause them to be TIRED like the main character.

3681628,3,B001L67A46,"I think the idea behind this documentary was a good one, however it was very biased.  It seemed as though the take away from the movie was that ""it's the black woman's fault"".  The documentary interviews many regular black people giving their two cents on relationships.  I couldn't help but notice that when the men where interviewed, although making some valid points, they were agreed with and not really interrupted.  However, when the women who were in direct contrast in opinion were interviewed, they were almost chastised in a way.  If the women being interviewed did not directly or indirectly say ""yes, we are angry and/or its our fault"" they were ridiculed and made to look dumb.

I did not like the in between acting.  Again more bias.  The man was made out to be a saint, while the women came off deranged and crazy.  That's not the real world...the world consists of PEOPLE (men and women) who are not infallible.

The movie did touch on no good men, only to say in so many words that the women should make better choices in mates and not bring it to the next relationship.  This documentary stressed the fact that women carry and harbor ill feelings and generalizations about men only to bring it to men who are good and have nothing to do with their past, which is a valid point.  However, the creator/camera man continuously goes on to interview different people asking them questions similar to ""how do you feel about angry black women?""

Perhaps due to an under-appreciation of a drama-less male or their own negative relationship experiences, some women look for the worse and expect the even less from the men they are interested in.  This phenomena is often not discussed in popular culture but it is among men.  Fact is, the emotional and psychic toll related to this is a great burden for many men.  This film opens the social door, so to speak, for men & women to talk about ""how"" we hurt each other intentionally and unintentionally.

The one way to make a black person lose their minds is to spit on them.  Realistically she would have been beaten to within an inch of her life had he been a real black man. For what it was it was ok but again they need to let people know its a documentary and not a true story.,1253491200,2,863,3.9883040935672516
3681637,5,B001L67A46,"I just watched this. I stumbled on to it. This was a phenomenal video. Every Black household should have this in their library. This takes the Black male's perspective ... a refreshing change. In all fairness, the film attempts to give both sides of the issues.

I lived this a couple of times in my life. Luckily I found a really good woman and broke the cycle. But for those of us that don't have a good person in their life, watch this video. Hopefully, you'll get a better perspective on what's going on in your dating life.",1249948800,4,528,4.387755102040816
3681638,4,B001L67A46,The movie came in Good condition. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the interviews.. there was too many. They should have spent more time making a complete film.

3681641,4,B001L67A46,"First of all, this is not a woman bashing movie.  This movie seeks to highlight certain aspects of the Black Male / Black Female relationship dynamic that may be broken and offers constructive ways of fixing it; constructive criticism, meant to strengthen relationships, and help both men and women make better decisions toward their futures together (or apart).

Men, watch it with your woman if you find that she is:
1. Arguing with you constantly.
2. Listening or talking to her friends about what you do or don't do.
3. Tearing you down in front of your children.
4. Taking for granted the kind of man you are (that being a good man).
5. Angry at you for no fault of your own.
6. Crazy.

Women, watch it with your man if you find that he:
1. Leaves the room when you have something to say.
2. Leaves for work early.
3. Comes home late.
4. Crazy.

Hopefully you don't have all of the above problems, and maybe you don't have any, but this docu-drama is a tool to help, not hinder your relationship.  If you don't have the problems portrayed here, then great.  If you do have some of these problems, here's a way to put them on the table and do something about them before your relationship becomes caustic.

This movie does have some downfalls however, which is why it loses a few points (3.5 out of 5 stars).  Many of the commentaries are rather lewd and unnecessary.  The film could be shortened, by taking out a lot of the material that doesn't need to be there.  Some of the outlandish comments cause the movie to have less of an impact on some of it's audience than it would have. The sporadic sequences of drama are also very short, and spaced too far apart.  I would love to see many of the sequences combined, and expanded, and limit the comments to only a few minutes. In all, it still seeks to provide information to strengthen the bonds of the African-American couple community, and succeeds in doing so in spite of it's unyielding use of opinions.

In conclusion, don't just watch the film because you have the aforementioned issues, watch the film because you are proactive, and don't want them.",1244678400,4,2111,4.511811023622047
3681642,3,B001L67A46,"The movie was okay, but it was more like a commentary because everytime it started to get good, he started asking individuals or groups of people about black relationships. I thought there was an actual plot but it was more like watching a ghetto version of 20/20 news with Barbara Walters! It was overall disappointing! If you want an actual movie to watch, don't buy this. If you like commentaries or interviews, go for it. This is definitely for you.",1243814400,6,453,4.675
3681643,4,B001L67A46,I would recomend any single black woman see this movie. It's not what u think it is but it's what u need 2 hear!,1243036800,,112,3.7083333333333335

I will forewarn you that it's 10 times different from Tyler Perry's version of Diary of a Mad Black woman. This movie is done as a documentary & what makes it interesting is that they get men's women's opinions on the movie based on a video they see about the main character pulling up to ""see his daughter"". OK, I've given more than enough of the movie away. Anyways, watch and see if you like it. I was addicted from the first time watching this movie.",1242518400,4,586,4.104347826086957

She could've been a good girlfriend,but she had sooo many insecurities from past relationships and regarding black men as a whole. She was always suspicous of me cheating,when i wouldn't do such a thing. She reminded me so much of the girl in the movie,so inappreciative and fiesty like.

I recommend couples and singles purchase this,because there could be more enriching relationships after this enlightning experience.",1239580800,4,627,4.850467289719626
3681646,5,B001L67A46,"This should be required viewing for every black couple, period(esp. if you have children!!!) It's not all on black woman, because as a black man, we have our s**t with us too. That being said, you can not put us all in the same bag. SOME of us have witnessed our fathers abuse our mothers, and are doing everything not repeat that vicious cycle with the women and children that we love. At the same time , black women who are in potentially good relationships really need to realize what they have and not let the transgressions of previous relationships (be it an ex- or even their fathers) f**k up the root of what could possibly save us as a people. Meaning: how do we expect to unify our race, when we can't unify the nuclear family : man, woman, child(ren)?!?! And speaking from personal experience, I can relate to James. I work hard everyday, and when I get home in the evening, I have no idea of the person that I'm gonna come home to. It's as if I have to constantly prove myself to my woman, who, even though everything I do is indictive of a man who is wholeheartedly commited to family, just seems not to ""get it"". And that is indeed tiring. Something's gotta give, black people. Although this is a problem that's not exclusive to our race, it seems to effect us the most. We need resolution. This film is definitely a step in that direction. Peace!",1239494400,18,1361,4.404761904761905
3681647,5,B001L67A46,Jimmy Jean-Louis does an incredible job on this movie which could have gone deeper into the psyche of the internal problems of Black relationships.  He makes the movie!  We need more of this type of movie.,1238716800,2,205,4.666666666666667
3681648,2,B001L67A46,"I saw the first third of this film last night and gave up on it. It's very amateurishly done, poorly acted, and ultimately repetitive, which is why I couldn't keep watching.

However, it did open my eyes to something I, as a white woman, had very little idea about: the rift that exists between black men and black women, and their mutual disrespect, stemming, as I understood, from so many black children being raised in a broken home.

I think it's quite sad this is the case, but the director approaches the problem from a very subjective, male perspective, openly dismissing the women's points in the interviews he conducts on camera.

There are short acted bits followed by interviews with black men and women. The acted parts are poorly scripted, and poorly acted, but the interviews are interesting because the topic clearly touches a nerve in both black women and black men. Unfortunately, because of the director's dismissive attitude to the women I could not keep watching the film, and ended up seeing only a third of it.

I had picked it from Redbox based on the 'official film festival selection' logos on the picture, because those usually refer to well respected festivals like Cannes, Venice, Berlin and Sundance, which pretty much guarantee a quality film.

The picture was too small to show that this movie was part of the official selection of festivals I had never heard of - African Diaspora, BFM International, and Pan African film festivals. I'm not saying those festivals are not well respected, but simply that I don't know what level of quality they show. It doesn't seem very high if this kind of amateurish work makes it into their official selection.",1238716800,16,1679,4.83623693379791

8317402,4,B001L67A46,"I found this movie an interesting look at the complex interactions between African American men and women's relationships (and other cultures too), and the friction that is caused by the destructive forces of past relationships and experiences that continue a destructive cycle in people's lives.

 The writer attempts to display how these long term cycles of abuse manifest, and offer a male perspective on the problem. As with any destructive cycle, it must be broken before things can be improved, and the point of them movie is to show how things can be improved. The points that are made in the movie can apply to any race, culture or relationship that is affected by past relationships where one or the other have been damaged by long term abuses, where a lack of trust has been ingrained in one or both of of the partners, long before they may have ever even met.",1524873600,,870,4.717105263157895

8317407,5,B001L67A46,"First, we have to realize that everybody has an outlook on life. The reason that there is a divider within the Black relationship is due to lost of respect for each other's opinions. I have never been with a woman outside my race. That's a great thing, huh? Yet I have found that most of my negative experiences in life have come from Black woman. Now, a Black woman has provided me with the best thing in my life...my children and I thank her everyday for that. But I have also grown older before my time due to dealing with the crooked emotions of the Black woman.

The Black community is being demolished because the Black woman has put more trust and favor into the White man. If you noticed, the Black woman treats the White man with more affection, respect and understanding. Through research, I have found out that Women wants to feel that they shouldn't have to worry about anything. Now...before you start to recite the same line that most Black women say at this time (if you haven't said it already)..."" You can't put all women in the same boat"" (this also shows similar characteristics)...I'm not characterizing all women, but there is a thing call ""majority"" and ""ratio"" which allow us to create a picture of amounts. In this case, you find Black men relating to this script due to experience and when the majority of something can relate to that same thing, then we find the problem. But truth falls on deaf ears when the ""problem"" refuses to admit it's faults. This is the result of an addict. Black women have become addicted to drama and will continue to be an addict until they first admit that they have a problem. Everybody has some type of conflict, but the sole purpose of the documentary and reviews are based on the actions of the Black woman and how it affects the Black man.

Black women... Your existence is important to the Black man's survival. There is little that we care for more (besides GOD and our children). But in a cruel, harsh world, Black men desire peace and serenity. If corruption and chaos is the only important reactions you have to Black men, well I say, ""Continue to be with that other race of men (no offense, fellas) or better yet, continue to be confused and be with each other. But don't continue to beat up a Black man because he don't want to continue being stressed and he decides to be with a woman that understands and encourages him to do better.
