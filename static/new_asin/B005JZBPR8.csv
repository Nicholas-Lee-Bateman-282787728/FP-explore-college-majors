4713844,1,B005JZBPR8,"i hate to do this to fluffy (aka Gabriel Iglesias) but this dvd showcases talent that disappoints. the only two good things off of this dvd are gabriel iglesias and his friend Martine (whom we finally get to meet- hooray!) who emcee the event. some of the acts make reference to drug use and quite frankly i did not expect this from gabriel's usual family-oriented material. i think that gabriel basically threw a bone to his friends by showcasing their raw talent on this dvd but unfortunately his good-hearted kindness does not work as this ""new"" talent falls short and quite frankly sort of disappoints. i hope that gabriel takes a cue to improve his recommendations and have better judgment when making a dvd for all of posterity to see.

also, on the positive side (yes, there is a positive side to these performers) is that i think people would enjoy the comics on this dvd ""live"" rather than ""filmed"" on dvd. i think that for some reason these comedy acts just do not translate to video. it could be their material or their delivery style- i'm not sure as i am not in the field. i think next time the performers should come better prepared with ""t.v."" material rather than ""live"" or ""comedy club stage"" material.

i'm sorry again to leave such a poor rating. it really breaks my heart to do it.  much love to you gabriel from a somewhat disappointed fan:(",1334534400,,1362,4.573770491803279
4713845,5,B005JZBPR8,"There's a reason Comedy Central messed up and gave Gabriel Iglesias a show! When purchasing this product make sure you don't have anywhere you need to be cause once you start watching, you'll just keep watching every episode right through! Finally getting to see what his friend Martin looks like (as he directs the show from the sidelines) AND with an episode showing his ""twin"" this DVD will show you a new side to Gabriel which will have you watching it over and over again :)",1332460800,,479,4.5813953488372094
4713846,2,B005JZBPR8,"If you enjoy Gabriel's specials then this is not for you.  The friends are not great (i think out of the 18 friends, i sort of liked 3) and the DVD is designed to where fluffy opens all 6 or 7 shows with 10mins of his stuff and then it's the friends. :( I bought it at full price and I'm just not impressed with it. Fluffy needs to make more DVDs with just him. Make more specials!!!!!",1331856000,,385,3.9358974358974357
4713847,3,B005JZBPR8,"If you're looking for LOTS of The Fluffy Guy and his normally hilarious material, this is not for you. While Fluffy is the host of several multi-comic segments, and gives a few short sets of solo jokes, in my opinion these are not the best I've seen from Fluffy and the other comics range (again, my opinion) from fairly lame to darn funny, but nothing like pure Fluffy on his previous solo DVD presentations. I'm going to resell this two disc set as soon as possible, Bleh!",1329868800,,474,4.459770114942529

4713849,5,B005JZBPR8,"Gabriel is hilarious and his friends is a lot of fun! The only bad side of buying this movie is that I live in Norway, and then it doesnt work on our dvd players without installing something.",1325376000,,191,4.1891891891891895
4713850,5,B005JZBPR8,"I'm so glad that fluffy has his own show, i did not know that he had his own show i thought that this was another special. even though fluffy did not do many jokes his friends were funny. i do hope that he gets another season. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do",1325116800,,282,3.8793103448275863
4713851,4,B005JZBPR8,"After watching this I realised that the special on Commedy Central is an edited version of this.  Was funny, but not a lot of ""other"" material.  So if you've seen the commedy central special, this is pretty much the same with a few extras.  We still loved it though!",1324944000,,266,4.387755102040816

4713853,5,B005JZBPR8,"I was lucky enough to see these shows live in Phoenix. Love the range of talent, special kudos to Martin Moreno his wingman and the great Thea Vidale. She was in top form. The band Ozo Matli plays their theme song and some other great tunes. What a fantastic bunch of predominately Mexican (American) comedians coming to redneck Phoenix. The DVD has all the material that was a bit too racy for the Comedy Central show. The tour just returned from a European tour to rave reviews. Check out the 18 year old kid comedian, he is hot and Thea does an imitation of a sex act that looks more than promising! Just a whole lot of laughs, I bought a copy for my friend for Xmas. Good Job and take it too the grave!",1321920000,3,706,4.237037037037037

4713860,1,B005JZBPR8,I had thought that it would be just Gabriel Iglesias giving and performing his routine. Real disappointed to have realized that it is several different comedians on this.

4713875,3,B005JZBPR8,You need to know that this is NOT a Gabriel Iglesias show. Just over 4 and half hours of comedy on two disc from about 18 different stand up comedians. The problems are (1) Most of it is not very funny (2) It is far from family friendly because most of his friends have much dirtier routines than I have ever heard Gabriel do. Now I will say that I find about 4 of the comedians have very good routines from start to finish. The rest all tell a joke or two that is good. I played the whole thing again to make sure that I give a fair review but it is pretty much what I remembered. You will get about 40 minutes of Gabriel himself but it is sprinkled throughout the four plus hours about 10 minutes at a time. There are out takes and intermission  segments between comedians also.,1409702400,6,780,4.131578947368421

4713881,5,B005JZBPR8,"Great tapes. I love to listen to and watch Gabriel Iglesias, ""Fluffy"" as he is very funny. I looked at trying to get tickets and could only get seats in the nosebleed sections, so getting his tapes was the next best thing to being there, plus I can watch them over and over.",1393200000,,274,4.188679245283019
4713882,1,B005JZBPR8,"We absolutely LOVE Fluffy!  Unfortunately, this DVD was more about him opening up an event and emceeing for other not-even-close-to-funny people.  I bought this DVD hoping to see a lot of funny Fluffy, but that was NOT the case.  This is NOT a Fluffy DVD, but mostly a collection of other people trying to break into the business with the help of Fluffy.",1392595200,3,354,4.587301587301587
4713883,3,B005JZBPR8,"Bought this DVD because I love Gabriel. This DVD is okay but not great. Fluffy is only the host and just does one quick routine and one or two lines as he introduces the other comedians. There is a lot of comedy on this and for a $10-$15 dollar range probably worth the money. As with any multi comedian DVD some are better than others, but this is NOT a Gabriel DVD.",1387670400,,367,4.111111111111111

4713887,5,B005JZBPR8,"This show is one of the funniest stand up shows on television and this particular season showcases some hilarious comedians that are very much worth checking out such as Larry Omaha, Maz Jobrani, Noe Gonzalez, and much, much more!

4713888,5,B005JZBPR8,this is a very funny stand up comic between his humor regarding his mexican heratige and his size it makes for a funny dvd,1375488000,,122,4.125
4713889,3,B005JZBPR8,"Ok, so Gabriel is like the funniest person on the face of the planet so I would have hoped that the people he would consider funny would be just as good or at least close. What you get is meh. Some are sort of funny but most are just either boring or not funny. Occasionally there is one that is offensive. I really enjoy when Gabriel speaks in-between or before his friends but it's just not worth buying for that. Definitely a rental. Wish I would have known that he wasn't going to be in much of the DVD or I would not have bought it.",1374969600,5,537,4.0754716981132075

4713898,5,B005JZBPR8,I found some of these shows online and they were all hysterical! They start off with Gabriel being funny for a bit then introducing the next 3-4 following comedians. I was surprised that all the ones I saw were really funny and good.,1356566400,,233,4.441860465116279
