Thought it would be a little more informative. Was all over the place.",1462147200,,96,4.388888888888889
8355424,4,B00281DXNA,"This video was interesting, informative but wasn't insightful. It is important to know and hear what it says to go further and learn, get more educated on the different subjects. Particularly important is to stay alert at what mandates are being passed as far as new vaccines for children.

I have a child born in 2003, when I wasn't as aware of this subject as I am now. Then there was literature readily available about how dangerous vaccines could be to a pregnant woman. Doctors even warned us that pregnant women should not be vaccinated because vaccines as well as pharmaceuticals could harm the baby. Six years later after our second child was born, I became aware of massive marketing for the vaccination of pregnant women against H1N1 and the flu and high school women """"to prevent"""" cervical cancer.
This was an observation I have made among others just through living, thinking experience which seems to be running out these days because people were going to their nearest pharmacy (CVS, Savon, etc) like drones to get one shot of the flu vaccine. I often thought, the human race has been around for so long, maybe longer than we know and the flu was going to be a huge threat to our health?
I doubt it. I used remedies I learned about and I was fine without vaccination, so have my new children who are more resilient and healthy than our first.
I'm still thinking, questioning, reasoning, communicating and learning and there is much that we must change so our children and our community's children inherit a better world, freedom of choice and wisdom, not entertainment or infotainment.
Knowledge is power
Power without wisdom is petulance
Power without compassion is tyranny

Get angry, get wise and practice compassion along with the first two.",1339286400,3,1760,4.824503311258278
8355425,4,B00281DXNA,"This is sort of a counterpart to Hidden Agenda 2012. It's a tape of Ian Crane discussing as an intentional tool for furthering political agenda at a symposium. Crain is a really animated and engaging speaker, and he also gives a number of references that can be accessed online.",1252368000,6,278,4.6938775510204085
8355426,5,B00281DXNA,"This film could play more like a feature length movie with the subject matter.  Conspiracy on many levels, plans for world domination and a public who is completely oblivious!  It was entertaining and appeared to have merit.  This ""conspiracy against humanity"" is scary and fear inducing, as we know that the desire for world domination is present in some people.  This look into the secret plan for destruction and chaos was well thought out and engaging.",1250208000,5,456,4.9605263157894735
