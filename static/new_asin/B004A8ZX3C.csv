4296853,3,B004A8ZX3C,"Jim Carrey was in fine form.  Not even the penguins could upstage him. But, I found it odd that the director felt the need to convey so many moral messages in this film.  I guess this is what passes for ""family entertainment"" these days.  I think the film would have been more fun if they just simply let the penguins ""fly,"" as the Captain finally did.  Instead, Mark Waters felt the need to bring the family back together, culminating in a wild rescue scene and the ""feel good"" ending you can imagine.  No surprises here, other than what Mr. Popper found in those ice boxes.  Great for kids.",1312934400,7,592,4.435185185185185
4296854,5,B004A8ZX3C,"My 4 year-old saw this movie 5 times! Jim Carrey, Angela Lansbury and Ophelia Lovibond's performances are great. Very original story, and very beautiful message of real love.",1311984000,2,174,5.25
4296855,5,B004A8ZX3C,"This movie is about a divorced business man named Mr. Popper (Jim Carrey).  When Mr. Popper was a little boy he would talk to his father who was in the South Pole when he was supposed to be in bed.  When Mr. Popper's dad dies at the North Pole his dad sends him six penguins.  At first Mr. Poppers tries to get rid of the penguins and send them to the North Pole, but it is unsuccessful meanwhile Mr. Popper grows to love the penguins.  The penguins help Mr. Popper with getting his kids and his ex-wife to love him again.  This movie is really funny. I would recommend seeing this movie with your whole family!",1311724800,4,611,4.232758620689655
4296856,5,B004A8ZX3C,"Between Mr. Popper's Penguins and The ZooKeeper, ... I liked them both, but I liked Mr. Popper's Penguins more. Kids loved it too. Nice story. Has been while since I saw a Jim Carrey movie,... thought he did a good job in this role. And the penguins are hilarious! I didn't quite get that incredible name of Mr. Popper's assistant,.... with the fun voice and accent, ... miss P (?),... but I liked her character/role too. So many fun scenes in this movie. We had a good time.",1310688000,31,475,4.409090909090909
4296857,5,B004A8ZX3C,"You live in an apartment in New York City and work within sight of the Empire State building. Your life is hectic but predictable.

Imagine getting a very unusual gift (turns out, later, to be from your father). It is a live gentoo penguin. Wanting to send it back, you ask for a return crate. You get a new crate all right--filled with five new penguins.

What a mess your apartment soon becomes! You get snipped at and dumped on by the penguins. You give them names, such as Nimrod, Stinky, Captain, etc. They are perpetually playful! The penguins swim in the bathtub and spill water all over. Your children from a terminated marriage come to visit, and, having long been alienated from you, absolutely fall in love with the penguins.

A nosy neighbor wonders what the noises are from your apartment and, suspecting that he is on to something, wants to tell the board about it. Worse yet, your new nemesis, a penguin specialist who works in the zoo, keeps spying on you. He has a behaviorist view of animals (making animals little more than machines made of flesh), and is determined to take your penguins from you. To him, penguins are simply fish-eating machines. He doubts if a non-specialist can properly care for penguins, and especially ridicules the notion that a loving bond has developed between the penguins and you.

In time, you turn your apartment into a winter wonderland, complete with snow, ice skating, etc. Some of the penguins lay eggs, and you are determined that they hatch. Your colleagues from work stumble upon your transformed apartment, and think that you have totally lost your mind. Your penguins follow you around wherever you go, and this produces its own share of comic events.

Everything comes to a head from the nosy neighbor, the penguin specialist, the kids, Popper's ex-wife, and his work colleagues. Popper is accused of breaking the law by housing penguins. He is fired from his job. He tries to win his ex-wife back. The penguin specialist has all of Popper's penguins. The apartment is normal once again, and the visiting children are heartbroken. And then... I will not spoil the ending by revealing it.

This is a very entertaining and heartwarming movie for the whole family. If you are an animal lover, this little tale is definitely for you.",1309737600,87,2289,4.782278481012658
4296858,4,B004A8ZX3C,"This movie was a little better than I expected. It's very funny and has a lot of heart. Jim Carrey is awesome and hilarious as Mr. Tom Popper, a realtor who is trying to help his company aquire Tavern of the Green. When his father passes away, Tom receives a penguin and causes mayhem in his apartment. More penguins arrive and his kids fall in love with them. He must soon choose between his job and family. If you want a good warm-hearted film, you'll love MR. POPPER'S PENGUINS!!!",1308700800,2,483,4.438202247191011
4296859,4,B004A8ZX3C,"Well I will make this review short.
Is this movie worth seeing?
Yes if you are looking for a family movie. No if you are a teenager and want to see an action filled flick. If you want that, go see Green Lantern which is also out right now.
Is this a good family movie?
Yes, this is a better family movie than Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer. This movie is funnier and just overall contains and better storyline.
How is this acting?
The acting from Jim Carrey is very good and it helps make this film better. The rest of the acting is good and just fine for a family movie.
Is this movie funny?
This movie does contain some funny jokes and people of all ages will enjoy them.
Is it predictable?
Yes it is. But the younger kids probally will not have a problem with this.

This movie is a decent family movie. It has a decent storyline that does include more than a few cliches. Overall, if you are a parent looking for a film you and your kid can enjoy, this is it.",1308268800,3,969,4.1
4296860,4,B004A8ZX3C,"Took my 7 year old daughter to see this movie today & Im really glad we went!
From the previews I thought the movie was going to be boring & lame, but I was pleasantly surprised with the movie!

The movie ran at a fast & very entertaining pace...
The theater audience laughed, laughed & then laughed some more...

The movie has comedy for sure, but also tells a great story & has a few very good life lessons in it...
The lengths Carrey takes to take care of these Penguins is just AWESOME!!!

Jim Carrey did a fantastic job as the lead actor...
He shows signs of his old hillarious humor from his early films, but is not sooooo over the top in this film as he was in past films...
He showed true heart & was very believable in his role!!!

The Penguins were unbelievably funny & simply amazing! They must have had some serious training!
The supporting acting was pefectly done by Mr. Poppers kids & ex wife...

Overall I give this movie an A...
I would recommend going to see this movie while its in the theaters...
I would also recommend it for adults & children...

Thanks for reading my review!",1308268800,48,1098,4.331707317073171

There are some similarities between the book and the movie but not too many, though, this fact isn't surprising since that seems to be the norm for a lot of movies based off of books.  That being said:  1)it's a good learning/thinking point having to compare the two 2)it's still an entertaining movie and we'll watch it again.

4297036,2,B004A8ZX3C,"I didn't like it that much because the movie didn't really portray Mr. Popper's love for the Antarctic and the South Pole. In the book, Mr. Popper's Penguins, Mr. Popper is always reading books about the Antarctic and learning of different people's adventures at the South Pole. It was the penguin which made the South Pole seem so interesting to Mr. Popper and the very thought of being able to interact with a penguin on a more personal level brought much joy to Mr. Popper. Mr. Popper was so excited to get word from Admiral Drake that he was to expect a package from him. His very own penguin! How exciting! The movie did not portray Mr. Popper's fascination with the South Pole and knowledge and love of penguins. Also in the book, Mr. Popper trained the penguins to do an act and took them all across America for them to perform their act. Mr. Popper's Penguins were very famous! Their story was in so many newspapers all across the U.S. The movie had a very simple plot and it just wasn't that interesting. The book was much more interesting!",1513296000,4,1049,4.526315789473684

It's nothing like the book except that his name is Popper and there are some penguins. They completely changed the story to where it in no way resembles the book.

There's enough here to satisfy kids as well as parents and there isn't really anything objectionable that you wouldn't want your kids to see.

4298018,5,B004A8ZX3C,"I never ever watch TV but I LOVE penguins so decided to watch this movie on evening with my husband and a friend. Jim Carey is hilarious in his role and for a movie that sounds unbelievable he makes it so believable. By that I mean that this could actually happen. In the movie he inherits 2 penguins from his deceased father, now the funny part is that he lives in a NYC up scale apartment. He wants to get rid of them but then things change as you will see in the movie. Mr. Popper (Jim Carey) is divorced with 2 children a boy & a girl. His job is some sort of big shot real estate tycoon  & no way can he take care of penguins in a NYC apt. BUT he tries like heck.
This is a great family movie , funny and in the end a lesson is learned.
Watch the movie and you will see, I have not sat through a whole movie in over 10 years but I did.
Maybe my love of penguins or just because I didn't want to miss what was going to happen next, never a dull moment in the entire movie.",1454371200,,976,3.8316831683168315

The slapstick insulted children while at the same time the real estate tycoon and property grabbing for nefarious purposes went over their heads.

Good relaxing movie without any over the top negatives, such as language, adult scenes, and questionable villains, that often come up with movies that attempt to satisfy both kids and family..

Rent this one or better yet, get it from Amazon, and park them in front of the tube some cold, dreary afternoon. They will enjoy it. (This one can't be rated ""G"" because it has a couple of penguin-poop jokes.)

Carrey is an ber-successful real estate agent whose job consumes his every waking minute. His father was a scientist who traveled and was away for most of our hero's childhood. When his famous father dies and he inherits a penguin, the fun starts.

The little 'uns will see:
  * Jim Carrey (""I Love You Phillip Morris"") is Mr. Popper, who is his own worst enemy. He lives alone in a palatial high-rise with visiting rights to his children. He is energetic, egotistical and eccentric.
  * Carla Gugino (""New Year's Eve"") is the ex-Mrs. Popper who shares custody of their two children. She has started dating again, but her heart really isn't in it.
  * David Krumholtz (""Harold & Kumar"") is a snoopy neighbor who suspects our hero of breaking the ""No Pets"" rule in the building.
  * Clark Gregg (""The Avengers""), is an animal control officer trying to capture those darling little Gentoo penguins ""for their own good.""
  * Angela Lansbury (""Nanny McPhee"") is a wealthy dowager, Mrs. Van Gundy, whose decision to sell Central Park's Tavern on the Green triggers a bidding war which our hero has been ordered to win.
  * Ophelia Lovibond (""Nowhere Boy"") is Pippi Peponopolis, Mr. Popper's assistant, whose alliteration with ""P""s will entertain the older children (and maybe some adults).

Of course, we suspend disbelief because we see an elegant apartment converted to an Antarctic climate and watch as penguins traipse up and down New York City streets and slide on the revered ramps of the Guggenheim. Awww... Who cares! They really ARE cute!

NOTE: Yes, the real Tavern on the Green has now been converted into a Visitor's Center...sob...",1420675200,,1964,4.817910447761194

4299230,4,B004A8ZX3C,It is a great Jim Carrey movie. Has a really funny plot to it and a lot of good remarks. But it isn't like the book and doesn't follow the book story line as much as I thought it would have.,1417651200,,190,3.658536585365854
4299231,4,B004A8ZX3C,My son and I have only seen this movie a few times but each time we watch it we love it. It is a great family film and one that I finally decided to add to our collection. Each year I get a couple movies for my son as Christmas gifts and this is one of them for 2014. Jim Carrey can sometimes be a little too over the top for my taste but he doesn't go overboard in this film. The writers were able to create a good balance with his character so the movie didn't have him acting too over the top. Definitely worth owning for family movie nights!,1417478400,,545,3.918918918918919

He shows that he is maturing, like Steve Martin and Bill Murray, and put out an very good movie with its light moments and not pure inanity. He can be a solid actor if he so chooses to be.

The story of a man whose late father was a world traveler and was always sending him gifts...the last gift  is a boxful of--you guessed it--penguins!  Our hero is a no-nonsense type who doesn't seem to be able to relate to either his ex-wife or his two children but the entrance of these little birds in tuxedos into his life changes everything for everyone.  Fun in the way he adapts to them instead of the other way around.  Of course there has to be some conflict and that comes in the form of a zoo official who wants the penguins, not because it isn't feasible to keep penguins in a New York apartment, but because he can trade them to others zoos for more exotic animals.  It was fun to see Agent Colson from S.H.I.E.L.D. as the nominal villain (really the man looks much too mild to be any kind of bad guy.) There's the expected happy ending for everyone, penguins included, and some laughs along the way.  A nice family movie with a good cast.",1390867200,,1089,4.231884057971015

4299914,4,B004A8ZX3C,"Let's face it:  without Jim Carrey, this film is as grounded as, well, a family of penguins at the South Pole.

But once again, Mr. Carrey comes through with his standard-but-out-of-control antics, and this makes the film fly.  Well, at least it takes off here and there without too many crash landings.  I almost never discuss plot in a film -- I'm more of a ""themes"" guy myself -- and that tradition continues with this film.  After all, why would you discuss the plot here?  You've seen it all before, albeit without penguins, most likely:  guy-has-family-guy-loses-family-guy-gets-family-back film.  Oh, and he grows a heart along the way.

Is this film realistic?  No.  It's as fake as some of those CGI penguins seen running around a New York apartment.  Is this film funny?  Sure.  Catch Mr. Carrey switching on an old Charlie Chaplin film (I believe the one where he gets so hungry that he cooks and eats his own shoe) and you'll get a good laugh.  I'm sure that it is the case that Mr. Carrey is a fan of Mr. Chaplin as well.  After all, the modern-day comedian almost has to be, since they're both some of the best physical comedians that you'll ever see on film or anywhere else.

If you're looking for something new, you might want to waddle right on by this flick and take a peck at something else.  But if you want a laugh?  I'll nibble at this one, and even though it's more like a 3.5 tops, I'll bump it up as it had its funny moments.",1388188800,,1451,4.448669201520913

It's a nicely-made, fun comedy, in which Jim Carrey receives a few penguins (who procreate) from his adventurer father, just before he passes on. He's a high-powered, divorced real estate deal-maker who lives in a very swanky apartment. He's continually frustrated in his attempts to get rid of them, grows to like them, tries to accommodate them, and of course, they help him re-bond with his kids, and his ex-wife. Lots of zany fun as the birds trash his place. They use real live penguins, obviously necessarily mixed with some CGI, but it's all seamlessly presented. I'm told my niece loved it to pieces, and there's enough sufficiently adult entertainment to keep grown-ups happy.",1372982400,2,830,4.852112676056338

4300354,3,B004A8ZX3C,"After lusting after this dvd for quite some time(and not being able to buy it), I finally managed to find it at my local library.
Before I saw it, I thought it was the original Mr. Popper's Penguins(like the book), with Jim Carrey playing the original Mr. Popper.
Within minutes, we discovered the only similarity was the title and penguins. My children were sadly disappointed. After reading the book, we had really hoped Jim Carrey would do some justice to Mr. Popper. Sadly, just like his attempt at ""Dick and Jane"", this was nothing more than a false illusion of what Hollywood thinks classic children's books should be like.
Granted, the story itself was very cute. The penguins were very loveable, the actors amusing. But be warned- this is NOT like the classic book by the same title, except ""maybe"" a loose reference to the original Mr. Popper who ""may"" have been this Popper's father(I'll admit- I missed the first 5 or so minutes, but this is what I'm assuming I may have missed).
Regardless, I'm very glad I didn't buy this movie. I would have given it less stars if I had.
My kids said it was okay, it was funny. But I think we all were a bit more biased because it did not play out like the book.
If anything, it should have been called, ""Mr. Popper, updated"" or ""Mr. Popper, Jr.(again, because this *may* have been his son's story instead of the original)"".
Hollywood needs to stop attempting to make spins offs of children's classics, and stick to the original story. They're called classics for a reason, don't mess with it!",1364947200,,1540,4.6036363636363635

4300472,4,B004A8ZX3C,"Jim Carrey's career has ranged from the intriguing (""Man in the Moon"", ""The Truman Show"") to the idiotic (""Liar, Liar,"" ""Dumb and Dumber""), so it's refreshing to see his character in ""Mr. Popper's Penguins"" come out as engaging and lovable as he does.

Much of Carrey's success in ""Mr. Popper's Penguins,"" now available on DVD + Blu-ray + Digital Copy from 20th Century Fox, has to do with two factors: the strong source material, and the penguins.  The original book, written by Richard and Florence Atwater in the 1930's, is still one of the most read tales for the elementary school set, having been consistently published since its original printing.  The tale has been updated, and Mr. Popper (Carrey), is now a high-powered businessman who receives a shipment of penguins from the will of his deceased father, an explorer who chose his around-the-world adventures over his son.  Popper the junior finds himself in the same situation, having to choose between his hotshot Manhattan sales job and his two kids (and his never lessened feelings for his ex-wife (nicely portrayed by Carla Gugino)).

Leave it to the penguins to help Popper make the appropriate choices in the end.  Penguins have proven to be the recent bird of success in the world of cinema, whether in a documentary (""March of the Penguins"") or in animation (""Happy Feet"" and ""Madagascar""), so director Mark Waters wisely gives equal time between Carrey's frequently improvised quips and the adorable exploits of his feathered co-stars.

Extras include interesting behind-the-scenes looks at both the real and CGI penguins on the set, the requisite Gag Reel, and a fascinating look at the history of the Atwaters' story.  For a film spending most of its time in freezing temperatures, ""Mr. Popper's Penguins"" will give you that warm feeling inside.",1357862400,,1818,5.05685618729097

4300620,3,B004A8ZX3C,"In ""Mr. Popper's Penguins,"" Jim Carrey plays Tom Hopper, a successful Manhattan realtor, who inherits six penguins after his father's death, and reluctantly starts keeping them in his apartment. The rest of the film is exactly what we expect from a family picture with Jim Carrey and six gentoo penguins: comedic mayhem and slapstick interludes (including water sliding in Guggenheim Museum) followed by a big question. Will Mr. Popper change?

The predictable story is fine with me, but aside from Jim Carrey's protagonist, most characters in ""Mr. Popper's Penguins"" are bland stereotypes. What is worse, it seems filmmakers thought they need a conventional ""villain"" in this film. So instead of sending the penguins to a zoo (as most people would do), Carrey's hero and his kids must protect ""their"" penguins from a zoo official (Clark Gregg), painted in a terribly negative light.

In spite of the clichd and uninspired story, Jim Carrey remains fun to watch throughout. Given the outlandish situation of ""a life with penguins,"" he delivers restrained acting, though he still manages to pull off some nice sight gags and impressions.

Several subplots are incorporated into the main story. They are about Tom Popper, who wants his ex-wife Amanda (Carla Gugino) back; who is tasked to buy a restaurant Tavern on the Green; and whose father, it is suggested, had been travelling around the world since Tom was a child. None of them is interesting. Veterans like Philip Baker Hall and Angela Lansbury are sadly wasted.

""Mr. Popper's Penguins"" is directed by Mark Waters (""Mean Girls"" ""The Spiderwick Chronicles""), who did much better jobs in the past. He is a reliable director, and Jim Carrey does his best, but the film needs a better script with a more coherent storyline.",1348876800,,1776,5.071917808219178

Our senior group from Virginia was one of the last patrons to have breakfast there, because it really was up for sale and closing for good. The city purchased it and made it a tourist ""station"". The room where a lot of the scenes in the restaurant centered around was the room where I took pictures of my wife and some our friends. Decided to purchase the CD.  The movie is funny and leave you happy at the end.  Plan to show it, on the bus, at our next New York trip in December. Most of the seniors were at the Tavern before it closed.

I feel ""The March of Penguins"" is more heart-warming. One of the reasons is the penguins look real. The other is the story is funnier at times. The hardship that the penguins have to endure to give birth is so touching.",1344556800,,556,4.56

I'd probably have been happier with this movie if I hadn't paid full price for it - it's fun, but forgettable.  Although it kept me entertained (the penguins were cute!), I didn't laugh once and found the plot very predictable.  I've seen Jim Carey in the role of ""neglectful father"" before, and felt that this made his character seem too similar to ones I'd seen him play in other movies.

But, ah well. It was fun, but forgettable.  I'd have been harsher if it wasn't for the penguins - they were so cute and fun that I couldn't help at least smiling at this movie.",1340841600,,726,4.348148148148148
4300660,1,B004A8ZX3C,"Mr. Popper's Penguins is another in Jim Carrey's career plan to turn into the next Eddie Murphy;  a talented comic actor who can't stop making cornball family movies that are short on creativity, good writing, and plausibility and long on clowning and shtick. In this latest offering, Carrey even explains his gags now, entirely re-issued from his earlier films, as if to be ironic as well as funny. I enjoy Jim Carrey's talent but I can't understand why he isn't smart enough to hold out for something better (same question directed at Eddie Murphy).

MPP suffers from the same things that seem to define family movies nowadays; brash children (although, to be fair, toned down significantly from other performances - note the less bratty performance from Madeline Carroll who played a much more horrid teenager in The Spy Next Door), cute animals who they insist have to perform some bodily function to get laughs, and a weak and predictable moral lesson about what really matters in life. What's worse is that they use classic children's stories as the vehicles for such dreck. They can't even come up with their own stories. They have to destroy cherished classic books. Wouldn't it have been better to gather the family for a reading of the book instead of mindlessly vegging in front of this awful movie? What's even better is that they could've watched the movie and then spent a stimulating post-movie bonding time dissecting just how badly the movie failed and teaching the greater lesson that entertainment doesn't have to be poop jokes and facial contortions.

Tons of families will enjoy it, buy it to add to their burgeoning collection of visual stimuli to make up Family Night, and everyone makes a pretty penny. Am I the only one who sees the waste of talent, the lack of effort, and the insult to the audience? Beyond that, isn't there some parental responsibility to not inundate your children with feeble entertainment? Isn't there enough garbage on tv to negate the need to actually purchase such a terrible movie? Aren't there hundreds of better things for you and your children to do than sit in front of the t.v. to watch this insipid film? Sorry for the buzzkill and for generating the inevitable ""It's just a movie - lighten up!"" replies. You're right. It is just a movie. So is ""Idiocracy.""",1339113600,15,2315,4.826196473551637

I am not a big Jim Carey fan other than his works in In Living Color and Truman Show, but I thought he was great in this role.  What amazed me is the fact live penguins were used much more than I thought ( in leiu of CGI penguins ) in the production of this film.  It's not heavy slap stick comedy at all.  I consider this a nice family oriented drama with awesome special effects.  Movie running time is 94 minutes and this boxed set comes with the cute plush penguin. 5 stars",1332288000,,597,4.294642857142857
4300715,3,B004A8ZX3C,"I've never been a big fan of Jim Carey. It didn't start out that way. When he was on IN LIVING COLOR and in THE MASK, I thought he was hilarious. But then something happened that always seems to be the way of stand up comedians. Folks tell them they're funny all the time that even them taking a breath is funny. And that's when they stop actually being funny. They continue to do their shtick non-stop but the originality that was there is no longer funny. Carey fell into that category by always seeming to be on, even when doing talk shows and hosting shows.

This brings us to his most recent film MR. POPPER'S PENGUINS. Based on the acclaimed children's book, it tells the story of a man who values his job more than anything. Thomas Popper grew up listening to his father on a ham radio, telling him tales of his adventures around the world. But he was rarely there in person. Popper has grown into a man with this same trait.

Popper is a closer for a real estate company, the best there is and about to be made a partner. All he needs to do is close on the Tavern on the Green property in Central Park. As this is about to go down he received a call from his father's lawyer. His father has passed away and left him something, an item to be delivered. When the item arrives Popper opens it to find a frozen penguin. Not until he takes it from the box and it thaws does he realize it's still alive. A bucket of ice in the tub and a locked door and he's off to work never realizing the fatal flaw there until he comes home to find his bathroom flooded. Looking for where the penguin came from he calls and asks them to take it back, failing to communicate over a static filled phone and a language barrier that results in more penguins arriving.

As if that wasn't enough story we have Popper's family, displaced since his divorce. His son Billy is still young enough to not see problems with his father but Janie is at that tough teen time when everything is a crisis. Even with a touch of advice from his ex-wife Amanda (Carla Gugino) he seems to fail with his daughter. When the kids show for their weekend with him, they're delighted to find the penguins with Billy thinking it's his birthday present.

The scenes shift back and forth between Popper trying to acquire the property he's after and adjusting to life with the penguins. While he first sought to send them to the zoo, he slowly grows attached to them. When they have eggs, he's hooked. Unfortunately it doesn't set well with his employers. Viewing the eggs Popper remembers what is important to him, his children and family. So what's the solution?

MR. POPPER'S PENGUINS is a feel good movie. It tosses aside all sense of logic and reality in the hopes of offering laughs and touching moments. Forget the fact that Popper opens the doors to his exclusive penthouse and fills it with snow. Or that he might toss aside the major career that enables him to do the things he does here. I'm all for suspending reality but some times it goes a bit far.

That being said the penguins are hilarious and adorable. Who wouldn't want to have them in their home? The kids love them and it is through them that Popper finds himself. A misplaced letter from his father that was attached to the first box helps him to find his way.

So back to Jim Carey. He does a great job here. He plays for a few laughs along the way and keeps things somewhat subtle. Until the last 10-15 minutes when it seems he goes completely out of control and does the shtick all over again. Here we are 17 years since ACE VENTURA and THE MASK and he still mugs for the camera. The result is another movie to add to the list of films Carrey could have made better.

But kids will enjoy the movie. They'll love the penguins and beg to have one of their own. Carrey fans will think he's still a comedic genius. Gugino fans will still think she's beautiful. And life will go on. This is a movie that you'll add to your collection for your kids more than yourself. And if they enjoy it, then its worth having.",1332201600,2,4039,4.326287978863936

4300791,3,B004A8ZX3C,"Apparently movie audiances of today enjoy gutter humor and seek it out.  My wife rented this film to watch tonight without reading any reviews first.  She knew the book.  I found it mildly funny.  It had a lot of CGI penguin scenes in it.  I'm sure the book is better than the film.

The movie could have been far better if the script hadn't been taylored to Jim Carey.  Instead Jim should have adapted himself to the character.  Carey often goes a little too far in his movies.  This one is no exception.

But as long as the movie audiance will buy a ticket or pay to buy or rent a film, it's the money that drives the industry.  Not the quality of the product.

This movie has a lot of contrived scenes that couldn't possibly happen in real life.  Consider that his upstairs bathroom has become a swimming pool and when the door is opened the apartment is flooded.  But yet no one knows he has penguins in his upscale apartment save but for one neighbor.  So thousands of gallons of water won't flood other apartments downstairs?  Really.  Cute but no cigar.

A little history research on the Tavern on The Green also shows the building is not privately owned but is owned by the city of New York and has always been owned by the city since the Tavern first opened in 1934.  Therefore no one can sell the building to anyone unless the city sells it.  The building is leased as a restaurant but that closed in 2009 and is now an information center and gift shop for the city.

Food vendors sell food outside.  According to what I read the food was never that great there.  The place served too many meals a day and the food quality lacked.  Nostalgia just isn't what it used to be.",1329523200,,1682,4.334405144694534

Perhaps what impressed me the most is that the movie was clean: no bad language, no nudity, no sexual references...in other words, nothing to offend anyone.  Oh wait...the penguins learn to 'poo' in the toilet, but that doesn't change my opinion.  When the DVD came out, I bought one for the nursing home where my elderly friend lived, and the residents have enjoyed it often.

The plot - the leading man learns that what is really important in life is love and family - is a good, if not uncommon, theme.  My biggest problem, though, was it wasn't very funny - I watched it with 10-12 year olds who laughed very little overall.  As an adult, I didn't feel anything for the characters in the family as they just weren't developed enough.  Instead of going all the way and making it laugh out loud hiliarious on the penguin front, it seems they tried the safe middle ground of some laughs and some family ""gooeyness"".  Mmmmm, gooey.

This is an okay movie for younger kids, and worth a watch, but I doubt you'd want to see it more than once.  So just rent it.",1326240000,2,789,4.248322147651007

POPPER'S PENGUINS may begin changing my mind about that because Carrey was able to be incredibly funny as we know he can be, but at the same time totally relatable as a real person with feelings, emotions and the ability to love and be loved. That's not always evident from his past work (most notably his breakthrough role in ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE). The man has emerged into a cinematic genius and these CGI penguins help bring that out. I couldn't help but think how much more difficult it must have been for him to interact with these penguins on screen when there was nothing there. AMAZING!

4301041,3,B004A8ZX3C,"On the one hand;
-Penguins are adorable
-Movies where a parent gets a second chance at being a good parent and succeeds, although cliche and overdone, is still a nice message
-The simple comedy and charming penguin antics are a good fit for kids
-Human/animal relationships are always heartwarming for a reason we may never completely understand
-Its a simple, easy, entertaining movie for the family without foul language or sex jokes
-....Penguins are adorable....

On the OTHER hand;
-The parents are married for 15 years, then get a divorce. When Mom finds another guy, Dad gets jealous and tries to win her back. Suddenly they are in love again? So, it really isn't a happy ending. Dad only wants mom back because he was jealous of her new boyfriend and as soon as they are back together they'll remember why they got a divorce in the first place, break up and traumatize their children yet again. OR, they have been in love with each other the whole time, but neither of them have a good understanding of loyalty and commitment. Therefore, when they went through a ""rough patch"" in their marriage (Carrey does refer to it that way) they got a divorce. But now that life has gotten a little better, suddenly they are ready to be together again. Sorry but that is NOT how commitment works. I don't really want my children thinking that is the recipe for a solid, healthy relationship.

-I work with exotic animals on a daily basis and I cant help but be a bit peeved at the fact that the zoo worker is depicted as a nasty, immoral man because he wants to take the Antarctic Gentoo Penguins away from the non-expert guy keeping them in his apartment. They use the fact that the kids suddenly want to be with their father again as emotional manipulation into forgetting the fact that a guy is keeping ANTARCTIC animals in his apartment with ZERO knowledge of how to care for them. And they're apparently breeding?  Oh but wait...he GOOGLES what to do with penguin eggs, so obviously he's doing the proper research to care for them.

Now the reason I have a hard time rating this is because, obviously, this movie is not meant to seem realistic. So I'd LIKE to just brush it off as being a stupid little movie that's entertaining for the family. However, our society is heavily influenced by our media. Our children are influenced by our media. I do feel like with children oriented movies, we shouldn't be showing divorce as an easy fix for ""rough patches"" in marriages, and providing hope that a happy experience will bring together divorced parents. Maybe we should teach our children that loving an animal sometimes means letting an expert care for it properly. And that trying to care for an exotic animal we know nothing about, in an apartment that has none of the essential living requirements, is a very irresponsible thing to do and will likely not have a happy ending.

Sooo..... as long as kids understand the parts of the movie that would actually be quite devastating in real life (like ya know, dead penguins) and should only be taken for fluff entertainment, it is a cute movie. But, even if you ignore all my specific complaints, it really isn't anything special.",1325203200,3,3180,4.661319073083779
4301042,3,B004A8ZX3C,"I'm sorry. I forfeited all objectivity once the first penguin waddled on camera. Jim Carrey's past few flicks have been hit or miss with me, and maybe a part of it is that I've gotten accustomed to his schtick, despite the impressive rubber face and manic body contortions that would make a yogi master weep. And maybe I'm still holding NUMBER 23 against him. But what's cuter than an infestation of penguins? My niece and nephews adored this film. MR. POPPER'S PENGUINS, with its predictability and obvious gags, rises above the dreck by dint of penguins. Plus, it's got Carla Gugino, hotness personified.

Jim Carrey plays Tommy Popper, a businessman severely focused on his career. But, first, we see Tommy as a child who spends a span of years communicating with his father via ham radio. His dad is an explorer who is always away on exotic expeditions, and, over time, we witness young Tommy grow disillusioned with his absentee father. Thirty years later, Tommy Popper is divorced with custody of his two kids on alternate weekends. Tommy himself has become a neglectful parent. All he's focused on is securing a partnership in his firm, a position guaranteed him once he bags a primo piece of real estate called the Tavern on the Green.

The status quo gets topsy-turvied when Tommy receives a shipment of penguin to his upscale New York apartment. And then another crate of five more penguins. When his kids come over for a visit, they fall in love with them. From there the plot unfolds in by-the-numbers fashion. You may guess that Tommy Popper turns over a new leaf and becomes a better father, to the detriment of his career. You may conjecture that he becomes smitten with his ex-wife all over again, although how in heck do you fall out of love with Carla Gugino in the first place? There's fun in watching Popper gradually convert his swank Manhattan duplex into a sub-arctic region, just to accomodate the birds and to connect with his kids. Other than the usual thorny family dilemmas that inevitably crop up, the narrative conflict hinges on Clark Gregg's (a.k.a. S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Agent Colson) scheming NYC zoo official who covets the six penguins because they're of the rarer gentoo breed.

I was somewhat impressed when I learned - thru the bonus features - that there's a higher percentage of real penguins in action here than one would assume. (Obviously the scene in which Carrey dances with the penguins is CG-rendered.) Several of the penguins are given enough character traits that they stand out. We learn that ""Captain"" suffers from flight envy. That ""Nimrod"" tends to bump into and fall over things. That ""Stinky""... well, you can guess his specialty. The others - Lovey, Bitey, and Loudy - are descriptive enough. The birds' ridiculous antics won me over. Jim Carrey tones his stuff down, as well, and this is a welcome thing. And I did love his compulsively alliterative personal assistant Pippi (Ophelia Lovibond). I recommend this family flick for those who think penguins are funny. But for those who couldn't care less about penguins - meaning that there's no buffer or filter thru which the bad bits can be digested - there are moments in the movie that simply defy believability (like a penguin hang-gliding) and they well may hike up ye olde blood pressure. MR. POPPER'S PENGUINS is not subtle. You'll see every plot point coming, predict every pratfall. It'll be as if you're watching the addled Mirror Universe version of the MARCH OF THE PENGUINS. But the kids will laugh themselves silly. I did, too.

4301064,3,B004A8ZX3C,"Story Recap: Mr. Popper (Carrey) grows up with an absentee, explorer dad, so he has failed at his own marriage and attentions to a pouty teenage daughter and easygoing pre-teen son. He has, however, succeeded as a high powered real estate developer with designer apartment and ever-present, British assistant who unconciously alliterates her every utterance.  When Popper inherits six penguins, sent by his recently-deceased father from Antarctica, he regains the affections and attention of his estranged family as he turns his slick life and apartment into a snowy playground for the little scene-stealers.  He must defend the tv-watching critters from a slightly evil zookeeper, and he must close on a big real estate deal to keep his job. No plot really matters here: the sight gags are enough....at least for young children.  My 6 and 8 year old granddaughters laughed hysterically at every penguin sequence which is just about every scene.  There is only gentle humor in this movie....no real vitriole or despair.  The kids, thankfully, are not the usual smart alecs, and the ex-wife is a sweetheart, clearly eager to repair the marriage.

4301068,4,B004A8ZX3C,"It's hard to find sweet, fun family films that don't have some kind of violence or meanness involved in the plot, even in animated films. This one fits the bill in that regard, with Jim Carey starring as a divorced, unemotional, workaholic businessman whose heart is opened when he unexpectedly becomes the caretaker for a family of penguins in his New York City high-rise apartment. In the process the rift between him and his ex-wife and children is healed. Although of course there is a 'bad guy' in the film for the plot to revolve around, he's just a zookeeper who wants to keep the penguins for himself to trade for other animals, and there isn't really any violence or car chases involved in the plot resolution.

The penguins are cute and funny, and cause a lot of mischief in his apartment. Jim Carey is hilarious as always - he must have control of more facial muscles than any man alive, with the variety of expressions he can pull off. I watched this film with 4 kids ages 5-8 (3 girls and a boy) and they all found it hilarious. I wasn't quite as amused - this film didn't throw in the adult jokes that some others (Shrek, etc.) throw in to keep us adults entertained - but I appreciated that the kids liked it. The plot requires complete suspension of disbelief, and divorced parents who are trying to get their kids to accept the finality of their split may not appreciate the sub-plot involving the parents in this film getting back together, but other than that this is heart-warming, innocent family fun.",1324166400,,1522,4.575091575091575

4301105,5,B004A8ZX3C,"This is a gem of a movie that parlays Jim Carrey's considerable talent and a delightfully amusing concept of an unexpected gift of six penguins into a heartwarming but hilarious film that never sits still for long.  Carrey's performance goes beyond the simply goofy, slapstick characters he played early in his career to become more nuanced and human, yet still terrifically funny as always.  A man whose own father neglected him, Carrey's character is an exceptionally successful business executive who is on the verge at first of becoming the same kind of father that his own father was, but taking care of the adorable but quirky and demanding penguins wakes him up to the fact that family is the most important thing in his life.  At the end, a letter from his father helps him realize what he must do in order to get his life back into balance, and he brings his fragmented family back together and gets his life back.

This DVD was so much fun to watch that after watching it the first time, I watched it again right afterward with the commentary turned on, and then I watched it again the next day with my 85-year-old mother, who laughed at various points in the story.  This to me is the kind of movie that never loses its appeal.  Far more so than the ubiquitous ""A Christmas Story,"" this movie has the kind of lasting appeal that really works--not just because of nostalgia but because it is endlessly entertaining and it satisfies the heart.  In addition, the filmmakers include just enough character actor roles to make this film pop.  The bellman who figures out how to make money off Carrey's flouting the building's rules and Angela Lansbury, who plays the little old lady with a lot more verve and irreverence than you would expect, plus the p-obssessed assistant, all add their own bit of humor to the story and people it with wonderful elements of comedy worked nicely into the already preposterous plot (see, I'm doing the p's too).

If you need a movie that everyone in the family is likely to enjoy, this is the one.  Jim Carrey is at his best ever, the casting is outstanding, and the movie just works.  From beginning to end, its fun interwoven with heartfelt moments captivated me and made me laugh.  I love this movie, and I hope they're planning a sequel to it with more impossible but ridiculously funny circumstances demonstrating the new grace and warmth that Carrey shows in this film.  Rent the DVD and see if you feel the same way about it.  If so, you'll want to buy it and make it part of your family DVD library for those days when you need a laugh or the comfort of a warm family moment.  It's definitely a keeper.",1323475200,4,2650,4.572938689217759
4301106,1,B004A8ZX3C,"Look, it can't be denied: penguins are adorable. With that in mind, it's quite understandable why there have been so many films in recent years, from documentaries to CGI-animated tales, centered around our most cuddly, flightless friends. And, of course, adaptations of books are a Hollywood favorite as well, which brings us to Mr. Popper's Penguins. Jim Carrey stars as the titular Mr. Popper, a divorced realtor whose globetrotting father leaves him with crates full of penguins upon his death. Popper decides not to turn the penguins over to the zoo when he observes how much his children love them, and in caring for his new feathered friends, he not only mends his personal relationships, but also succeeds in landing an important and sentimental real estate deal. Based on a children's book from 1938, Mr. Popper's Penguins is pretty standard stuff, which means the plot points are predictable, and there are enough ""aww shucks"" moments for the kids. The film, however, fails to transcend clich and become something more.",1323475200,5,1029,5.094674556213017
4301107,2,B004A8ZX3C,"Positives:
Great acting performances by Pippi and her penguins. Mostly good by everyone else except Carrey and Lansbury, at times, reverted to their stereotypic past learned phrasings and characterizations.
Enough uniquely humorous lines and skits to make the movie a mostly novel laughable experience. So, kudos to the writers for those parts.

Negatives:
Studios with their crew of writers, directors and producers know that making money takes precedence over creativity so with that thought in mind we have the following too predictable scenes:
A stereotypic plot framework of a newly divorced couple with teens.
Teens have their own issues as well as navigating/mediating the divorce.
Dad, as usual, had his own father family issues growing up.
Dad is seen as more in love with his monied vocational interests than the kids.
Mom, has a new male friend that ends up to be a boor. Yes, gets booted.
At stake is a prize piece of property that is predictably going to be procured by Dad after he re-prioritizes with the help of, guess who, penguins.
Dad also wins kids and wife after he re-prioritizes with the help of, guess who, penguins.
Penguins, at first, were presented in a clever way but towards the end the writers ran out of ideas and the animals just did the same made-up cute tricks found in most animal movies.

In summary, if the movie just had Pipi and the penguins to build around it would have had the potential to be creatively - spot on.",1323388800,4,1456,4.82

I felt like I'd seen this before in about a dozen ways, but it was heartwarming and family-friendly and all those other wholesome things, so much so that it's hard to not like it to some degree. Carrey is a toned-down version of himself, but if you're a fan you'll still find it plenty Carreyish. The script is familiar but pleasant, like the whole movie itself.

All the standard moral lessons are achieved, family is the only thing that matters, etc (though having mega-millions for a 3,200 sq. foot Manhattan penthouse does help). As in Liar Liar, mean successful Jim becomes nice (and still successful) Jim, makes the kids love him again, gets back with the Mrs., learns his lesson, etc. If that's a spoiler for you, don't worry, you can see it coming from about one minute into the film.

The alliteration of the P's has its moments, and there are enough decent laughs to make this worth watching for more than just the good family fun aspect. The penguin story is on the whole ridiculous, but that's what sells it. All in all, Popper is just another likeable-enough semi-rom-com from Carrey, but serves its purpose well.",1322784000,,1137,4.675
