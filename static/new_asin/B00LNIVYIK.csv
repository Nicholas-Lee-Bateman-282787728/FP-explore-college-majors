8666938,5,B00LNIVYIK,"I was so impressed with the simplicity of Bob's approach.  You can find a sample here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moQn2zfwfxo).  Don't mistake the homespun style for anything other than the time-tested techniques of a master cabinet maker.

I'm a do-it-yourselfer and largely self-taught.  I am tempted to write, ""If only I had seen this 30 years ago..."" but actually, these videos are helpful to making me more consistent and more productive now.  I am as often disappointed in quality as I am in the occasional successes.  Bob's techniques make me consistently better.

In some ways, you'll feel like you're standing by your dad's side and learning the basics again.  It's a rare privilege.  Don't miss it.",1419292800,,713,5.238938053097345
8666939,5,B00LNIVYIK,"Clear, concise understanding using a common sense approach only a Master would know. I would recommend your DVD's to anyone looking for excellent tips or ideas.

Looking on your YouTube Channel ""themasterwoodworker"" and reading some of those reviews from your fan base I had to purchase this DVD set.  These home made videos make me feel like I am being shown by someone I know. I am now part of your fan base and look forward to your next video.

Thank you Bob Chase you sure ARE a MASTER WOODWORKER and a great teacher.",1405641600,2,521,4.5212765957446805
