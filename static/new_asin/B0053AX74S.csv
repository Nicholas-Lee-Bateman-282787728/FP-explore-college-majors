8455074,5,B0053AX74S,"This was a movie based on the Jademan Comics of Oriental Heros and Fists of the Budda's Palm.  The 2 guys are Tiger Wong, that has Nine Suns Kung Fu and Dragon Slaying Kicks, and Gold Dragon, which has mastered his body with Golden Armor of the Oriental Heros.  Donnie Yen is Nine Continents that has mastered Budda's Palm.  The film takes away from the comics and focuses on the 3 heros fighting a main villain.  He beats both Heros and fights Donnie Yen, which beats him in the end.  Althou the men are less powerful in the comics, overall, it showcase the 3 men and is a great movie.",1431043200,,586,4.290909090909091
