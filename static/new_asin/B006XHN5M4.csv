Deliverance From Evil follows in the footsteps of traditional supernatural horror movies that involve a house or person haunted by evil spirits. The film was released independently, and in my opinion it's almost always a good thing. To keep this review simple, it's about a couple and their kid that move into a spooky house. The young boy dies early on in the movie and soon the couple realize they shouldn't have bought the house. There were some scenes that are creepy and just genuinely unsettling that I think will bother some younger viewers. There is a scene with a toy phone that creeped me the hell out, it was simple yet very effective. The cinematography was very impressive for a low budget horror, and I thought that the cast was pretty good as well. Though I liked the movie there were some things I didn't really care for at the same time. There are a couple of establishing, emotional scenes at the beginning when they lose their son. I think there needed to be a little more action earlier on. But once the haunting starts it's all good going forward. I also really liked the glimpses of the evil spirit. It wasn't over the top, yet subtle enough to scare me. I saw it with my kids and my preteen was too scared to sleep with his lights off, LOL. I actually liked Deliverance From Evil better than Paranormal Activity (way overrated and not scary). I have a feeling some will disagree with me on that statement but that's how I feel. This movie was far from being a perfect movie but at the same time I enjoyed it despite its small flaws. Three out of five.",1332547200,27,1600,4.501718213058419

5036826,1,B006XHN5M4,"I love B horror. This was not a B flick. Angel Aviles portrays a mother that has just lost her only child and has no resemblance of grief in her tone or actions. Jose Rosete gave a barely passable performance, at least giving the impression of a grieving father. The phony delivery of self-importance from (I think) Elias Castillo as the clairvoyant was ridiculous. Typically, bad acting in a B flick is an over-the-top delivery that results in a comedic effect. Sometimes intentional, sometimes not; either way, it's that over-the-top effect that can make a B flick really stick out. Sadly, the actors in this film were likely doing their best. Indie films can often hold hidden gems in actors, or storyline, or directing - this one did not. The director holding a camera shot for 20+ seconds, repeatedly, in order to force the viewer to ""notice"" something is the same as hitting someone over the head and shouting, ""Pay attention, stupid!"" It's insulting to the audience, especially when so over used. The story itself was so generic with absolutely nothing notable or unique.

even though it is nothing new,
we have all seen this type of movie a million times,
and the acting was very poor.

I am giving this movie five stars (even though it really deserves only one) because I love these types of movies,
and I really enjoyed it,
even though I must admit that it was not good.

I did not find it scary.
I actually laughed at the ghost scenes, so I was entertained, which is what I was looking for.
I guessed most of the scenes just before they happened.
The make-up on the ghost was poor and the ghost did not look scary or even dead.
So, I am giving this movie five stars because I enjoyed it and I laughed and I was entertained, which is all that I wanted.

S P O I L E R S 

Why was Mike (the father) the only one who seemed to have a job?

His cousin worked with him (he had the same green uniform), but he was free to drive around with Mike all day.

The psychic said that he would not take any money, and that that was not his real job - - but did he have a real job?

And the priest obviously was working in the church.

Everyone else, except for the mailman and the realty lady, seemed to be free all day long.

Mostly, Bobby and Ariel were free all day, and they obviously did not work nights either, because they were free at midnight to come to a cleansing.
Bobby had a two bedroom apartment (it was mentioned that Mike wanted to sleep in the ""extra bedroom""), but he lived alone.
Ariel did not live with him because she made it clear that she wanted to ""go home.""

But everyone could afford cellphones and cars.

Also, it was strange that the mailman would just stop and talk to Mike and tell him horrible stories about his house.

It was strange that Mike was bitten by the entity in the middle of the night.
That was a really bad injury, with a lot of blood, but Mike did not go to the hospital or to a doctor to get stitches or antibiotics or painkillers.
After the bite in the middle of the night, it was not mentioned again, no mention of Mike bandaging his arm or being in pain.

It was also strange that since Mike saw more than everyone else, and Mike had a serious injury, that Mike was the most non-believer.
I was really surprised when Mike broke the circle because he should have wanted the cleansing more than anyone else.

Bobby experienced absolutely nothing, but he had an open mind to it all.

The priest made it clear that, according to the rules of the church, he was only allowed to bless the house.
But when the priest came over, he was performing a quick little exorcism.

I knew that Mike was going to kill his wife at some point.
I could not believe that she was stupid enough to stay in that house.",1455321600,,2681,4.125

5036855,2,B006XHN5M4,"This is not a great film. It's yet another example of amateurs shooting a feature film, largely because the costs of production have gone way down. I'm guessing this film cost at most a few thousand dollars.

Even so, it was entertaining -- provided you're a hardcore horror fan who enjoys even ""home movie"" type productions.

The story is standard-issue supernatural horror. A demonic entity kills a boy early in the film. This entity possesses the house. At first, the dead boy's parents think the boy died in a horrible accident. But then furniture starts moving, etc. Investigation reveals that the house has a dark past of previous deaths.  A psychic performs a seance. A priest performs an exorcism. Etc., etc., etc.

Curiously, the father conducts his investigation by looking at the microfilm archive of a local newspaper in the library. Hasn't he ever heard of Google? The relevant back issue is only a few years old, so it should be online.

The dialog is pretty bad. Very ""on the nose."" Characters keep stating and repeating the obvious. Several times during one phone conversation, the mother of the dead boy says ""It's really hard to lose a child.""

Thank you for that bit of info, Captain Obvious.

The script is FULL of empty dialog like that. The co-writers of this film need to learn subtext, subtlety, and ""showing, not telling.""

The acting is not so good, though I've seen worse. Ditto the production values.

Despite its flaws, I mostly enjoyed this film. You have to be forgiving of amateur horror productions. If you like that sort of subgenre (if it can be called that), you might enjoy this film. It's not great, but I've seen worse.",1428278400,2,1658,4.769230769230769

Probably what annoyed me the most was the sound.  Probably just used the microphone on the video camera.  Just a guess, but they start realizing their house is haunted after some cheap startles, their son's spirit is trapped in the house, and they call the minister to cast out the evil demon.

It took for both of my kids to tell me either, 1) Mom I don't want you in here, I'm old enough to take a bath myself or 2) I don't want to take a bath I want to take a shower (which both of them did at an early age) Anyway.. the movie was painfully slow, and about as scary as a Halloween episode of the Jerry Springer Show, with less action.",1411516800,2,844,3.768361581920904

5036888,1,B006XHN5M4,"DO NOT WAIST YOUR TIME.  This movie was terrible. One of the worst preternatural movies I have ever watched.  I knew it was going to be bad when I saw the dark smoke trail that was used as the entity in the first 30 seconds of the movie.  Acting was bad, sound was bad, script was bad, camera angles bad.",1410480000,,304,4.033333333333333

5036891,4,B006XHN5M4,"It was a good movie. Action all the way throughout. I thought the mother could have been more upset about the loss of her son. Needed professional actors though. But good for a low budget, indie movie. I'd recommend it.",1407196800,,219,4.5

5036894,4,B006XHN5M4,"I was really surprised at how good this movie was. It's not the kind of horror movie that makes you jump at every turn. This is more of a movie that gives you goosebumps. Not the movie for someone who has a short attention span or needs special effects in order  to be entertained. The acting is not that great, but I think it just makes it seem more believable.",1406851200,,362,4.171428571428572

The actors must have been neighbors or family of the producer. I did get a giggle from the short chubby, demon kid who made sure his goth makeup was perfect before each of his apperarations. OOOOOOOH SCARY, LOL. But the cover art was good.",1406332800,,414,4.4605263157894735
5036898,2,B006XHN5M4,Felt generous gave two stars. Only couple parts found interesting. Beginning started good thought man glade I'm going to watch this. Really unbelievable. A little creepy . No chemistry really between these actors . Seen better possession shows. Just really didn't grab me.,1405123200,,272,5.348837209302325

5036901,2,B006XHN5M4,"I am giving this 2 stars because most of the acting was fairly decent and the production was OK.  The movie itself is quite boring.  Do not believe anyone that says that this movie is creepy or scary.  There is none of that.  The music in the back ground plays throughout the whole movie and gets quit annoying, even the sound editor got bored and feel asleep on the job a few times and there were lapses in the music real, it was like listening to the soundtrack of old Hanna Barbera cartoons.

I always like when people get the chance to make their movies and I always applaud small budget independent movies, but this could have been better, if they would have just tried to be creepy, I would have been happier.",1404950400,,715,4.345864661654136

5036905,4,B006XHN5M4,"For a low-budget film this does a fine job of creating a simple no-nonsense portrayal of a haunting, demon, and possession. The relationship between the husband and wife was lovingly done, especially when most couples who lose a child breakup; it was refreshing to see how these two hung together. I was waiting for a stupid surprise ending, and while the ending was a surprise, it was not stupid.",1400284800,,397,4.768115942028985

5036908,1,B006XHN5M4,"Wish there was something lower than one star. The acting was atrocious, reminded me very much of someone reading their lines. The only atmosphere really was the incessant music.

5036911,3,B006XHN5M4,"Not for primetime viewing but it helped me whittle away some time pleasantly. The characters are relatable and it feels like you are peeping in on someone's real life. The psychic was a bit hokey. Anyway, there's nothing new here but like I said, it is a good companion for multitasking. I am a sucker for Satanic, demonic, possession types of things. I really liked the ending.",1396656000,,378,4.656716417910448

The premise of the movie was nothing new, and it wasn't scary at all.  Not even a little bit.  Very disappointed.  I almost quit watching after all the fake crying with no tears at the beginning, but thought I would give the movie a chance.  I wish I wouldn't have wasted my time.",1395187200,,446,4.301204819277109

5036919,4,B006XHN5M4,This movie is lower budget but honestly not real bad. It's not disgusting but remains a bit creepy. I wouldn't go so far as to consider it scary myself though it's not a bad watch for a lazy afternoon. Better to rent this then to buy it. Personally it's not one I'd purchase for my personal collection but like I said it's a rare thing to find a move that is decently scary without being just downright gross so I give it a four for that alone!

And that's probably the story of why this laughable travesty was created.

It looks like it was shot with a potato.  The actors are the finest that a high school drama has to offer.  And the bits of plot that exist were stolen from better movies that were in theaters 20 or 30 years ago.
