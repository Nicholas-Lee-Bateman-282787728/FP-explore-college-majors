4219105,5,B003Y58CKS,"The Dresden Opera was wise to have this live performance of Verdi's warhorse RIGOLETTO recorded and committed to DVD as this is like the only time we will be able to see/hear  Juan Diego Flrez as the Duke of Mantua.  He is absolutely magnificent in this production , but then equally as impressive is Diana Damrau as Gilda.  She is a beautiful woman with an extraordinarily fine voice and stage presence.  And Zeljka Lucic captures the multifaceted aspects of the tortured jester Rigoletto.  Fabio Luisi conducts with a fine sense of pacing the performance, allowing the singers to rule when in aria and at the same time keeping the orchestral sound propulsive to make the drama move.  The production itself is by Nikolaus Lehnhoff who once again wants us to believe that putting costumes from various periods on the characters (primarily the trench coat look) is supposed to make the drama more intense.  It gets a bit wearisome except for the fabricated stage parcels that allow us to observe other character's reactions to the drama as it unfolds.

But all that aside this is a Rigoletto for the top of the heap. Hopefully there will be a CD version to allow those who don't favor the 'look' of this production to just listen.  Grady Harp, November10",1290470400,,1253,4.763888888888889
4219106,5,B003Y58CKS,"Vocally this is a superb Rigoletto. Much more so than any other still available on DVD. Juan Diego is simply perfect in his ardor. Those tenor arias familair from childhood were fresh and new. He is a treasure; I hope he does not overdo and burn out too soon. Mr Lucic's baritone is almost too pretty to be Rigoletto but he did show a gamut of emotions from tender to fury. He reminded me of my first Rigoletto, Leonard Warren. But as noted by other reviewer he was not ugly, misshapen or evil enough. He should not engender pity from the audience. Ms Damrau is an excellent singer who had no trouble with the tessitura of Gilda. My only problem is that she seemed too smart to be taken in by the Duke. My ideal Gilda would have a sweeter, more innocent voice ala Victoria de los Angeles. Even the lesser parts were sung by young excellent musicians. A great cast! I was particularly impressed by the tall sinister Sparafucile of Georg Zeppenfeld. There is a devil for a future Faust. No problems with the low notes they are all there and musical too. He has a great future. I also commend the excellent chorus and orchestra; the conductor Luisi did things just right.
Now the problem. Lehnhoff's production is a travesty. A crime agaist nature. Verdi knew what he wanted. He was a man of the theatre and envisioned the actions and the sets as he was writing the music. Yes you can do strange things to Handel and it works but by no means can you do such to Verdi. I now put on the DVD and just listen to it.",1290297600,8,1508,4.332155477031802
4219107,5,B003Y58CKS,"These traditionalism-vs.-Regietheater times are too heavily partisan, and some of the choices made too idiosyncratic, for Nikolaus Lehnhoff's 2008 Dresden RIGOLETTO not to displease a significant minority. I urge patience. The DVD would be recommendable even if it were simply a brilliantly played and exceptionally well-sung RIGOLETTO (it surely is that) with a troublesome production. In fact, it is more. This time, the oddities (a *very* decadent, decidedly R-rated masquerade for the first scene; Act I Scene 2 mostly set in Gilda's bedroom; the unorthodox Act III quartet, with the Duke and Gilda sharing a symbolic clinch before the former returns to his ""literal"" spot with Maddalena) accumulate in the right ways, and settle better in the long view.

Although the experience is of a RIGOLETTO that is distinctive and slightly disorienting, the liberties taken are properly in details, not in focus or theme. Verdi's opera is still, from its sinister opening measures, a bullet aimed for a spot right between the eyes. There are several things a director can choose to emphasize at the expense of other things, and Lehnhoff's is an unsparingly brutal treatment: a story of goodness trampled as a freakish thing in an environment that cannot sustain it. It is both valid and overwhelming. In the final scene, the pathos of Diana Damrau's death acting and Maestro Fabio Luisi's deliberate pacing (Luisi is all thrilling extremes: marathon-fast in cabalettas, with the saved-up time generously ladled out elsewhere) seem to go beyond fulfilling the requirements of a melodramatic formula. It's about a tiny light in a dark place being snuffed out, and a terrible world being left more the terrible for it. By the end, I was genuinely shaken.

There is such an emphasis from beginning to end on masks and hidden faces that it sometimes seems as though Lehnhoff is checking RIGOLETTO and UN BALLO IN MASCHERA off his to-do list simultaneously. Over that brief, menacing prelude, we see Rigoletto getting dressed for his day at the office and smearing on the greasepaint like Canio (he pointedly removes it as he returns home). The courtiers appear in many guises from scene to scene. They begin in outrageous (and impressive) animal masks, the stuff of a wild carnival, and are even more horrible to Count Monterone than the opera absolutely requires. For the abduction of Gilda, they are costumed as black flies. By ""Cortigiani,"" they have made another transformation: leering, horned devils. Rigoletto futilely rages, begs, appeals to better natures that are not there. When he turns individual attention to Signore Marullo (Matthias Henneberg), the latter shows his true face, and though handsome, it is as cold and impassive as the mask that had hidden it. There seems not to be a soul or heart at all there, never mind the ""gentle"" ones of which Rigoletto pathetically speaks.

When Kyung-Hae Kang sang her first few gorgeous notes as the Countess of Ceprano, prepared as I was for the weak comparimario voice one usually gets in that part of a few lines, I knew this was going to be a real ensemble feast, not just a performance with a few stars surrounded by mediocrity. In the lead roles, Juan Diego Flrez (his wholesome looks successfully sleazed up with a quasi-mullet hair attachment suggesting club trash of about 20 years ago), Diana Damrau, and Zeljko Lucic have the equipment and the estate to make it all sound easy, and their performances take wing from that security -- they have a range of options at their disposal. A list of examples would be long. Flrez, as ever, can make the most hackneyed tenor items sound freshly considered. Lucic is not a fat-voiced Verdi baritone of days gone by (MacNeil, Taddei, Merrill), but there are color and shade to his instrument, as well as expressive warmth, and both this house and the microphones flatter him. Damrau's ""Caro nome"" is simply a breathtaking piece of singing -- the control and detail one always hopes to hear in this and rarely does, and every note and breath furthering an *idea*, not ""decoration"" but elaborative fantasy. Georg Zeppenfeld's Sparafucile (black shades and switchblade recalling the villain in WAIT UNTIL DARK) upholds the standard of excellence, and Angela Liebold actually squeezes an intriguing character of Giovanna, the duplicitous minder. Only Christa Mayer's zaftig Maddalena seems out of place: awkward on stage, without chemistry with Flrez, and vocally no more than satisfactory, though not harmful to the quartet.

While the lead trio is a well-matched team and no one is overtly trying to ""win"" the evening, it is Damrau's Gilda that will linger longest in the memory -- not only for the disturbing image she presents following the Duke's forcing himself on her: hair disheveled, skin scratched, white dress tellingly bloodied in a very specific spot. In her first scene with her father, Damrau had seemed to be overacting embarrassingly, and knowing as I did that she is generally a fine stage actor and that Lehnhoff typically does not elicit poor acting, I waited to see where this was going. And I saw ultimately that this Gilda was to begin as a real ""child"" -- not radically younger than specified in the libretto, but perhaps a manic, sugar-high, jumping-on-the-bed and pillow-fighting kind of teenager. She can hardly keep still to go to sleep, so atwitter is she over her amorous thoughts of ""Gualtier Mald."" Her implied sexual awakening has her physically demonstrating excitement the way a young girl might on Christmas Eve or the last night before summer vacation begins. Knowing what we know is coming, it is heartbreaking. The behavior gets subtly calibrated by every subsequent exchange and every subsequent event; and by the time Gilda dies, Damrau is playing an adult who has achieved tragic stature. Brava.

If I have a single objection here, and it really is less something to affect one's buying decision than something for me to take up with Nikolaus Lehnhoff in a debate that will never occur, it is that I believe one important dimension of the opera is lost entirely: the monstrousness of Rigoletto. We *hear* about it, from him and from others, but we do not see it. No effort has been expended to make Mr. Lucic other than the handsome man he is. Rigoletto's much-discussed hunchback is there but barely noticeable. RIGOLETTO is about an innocent brought to her end by the ""love"" of two men who are both, in their fashion, monsters -- only the one is easier to spot. Rigoletto's obsessive paternal love has kept Gilda so sheltered and unworldly that she's defenseless when she becomes a young woman and attracts this more sinister brand of hovering male figure. The Duke *also* wants her all to himself (for a time) but his motives are darker. Gilda may have survived being in the orbit of one of these two; caught between both, of course she must be destroyed. None of this is in the RIGOLETTO of Lehnhoff. His jester is just a noble and devoted father with a job he hates  (of course, the selfishness of his destructive quest for vengeance -- despite the begging of the daughter he would avenge -- cannot be gotten around). I grant that RIGOLETTO is a work that can take a certain range of approaches, but Rigoletto is a protagonist...never a hero.

Those with the broadest definition of ""Eurotrash"" (I failed to mention the modern dress) may want to stick with the Dexter/Levine Met performance of 1977 (Cotrubas, Domingo, MacNeil). But for its remarkable solo singing, conducting, orchestral playing, and choral singing (an incredibly precise male ensemble throughout, and ""wind"" effects in Act III that sound as eerie as Bartk), allied to a powerful dramatic presentation, the Virgin performance is the new essential.",1290211200,36,7753,4.986862442040185
4219108,4,B003Y58CKS,"I don't have much to offer that the 3 previous reviewers haven't covered. The additional praise must be for the marvelous costumes in the opening scene.
  As for the negative; if someone hasn't already done so, please tell Florez that when he is being recorded in a live performance to stop closing his eyes in the middle of an aria . Stay in character and stop acting as if you're singing to yourself in the shower. Yes, Pavarotti did it regularly but at the end and not during an aria. It is really distracting to this viewer, almost as bad as some singers glancing at the conductor or prompter. Stay in character when being recorded live.",1289952000,7,641,4.517241379310345
4219109,5,B003Y58CKS,"It is difficult to imagine that the Virgin release of Verdi's Rigoletto will be bettered in the near future. Musically, vocally and dramatically this is one of the most satisfying performances of this opera that I have heard and seen. There is not a whiff of routine or cliche. Maestro Luisi conducts on the brisk side but never at the expense of the music or the singer; indeed those arching Verdian melodies are always given full value. And it must be added that the three leads give more than full value. There isn't an Italian among them but their unerring sense of style and how the music should go compensate for a performance that could have emanated from the stage of La Scala. Among the information that Amazon provides is the ""timing"" of the set:90 minutes! This couldn't be more inaccurate. If one checks the timings for most of the sets, the opera runs about 128 minutes. A major exception is the Met set which is alleged to run 180 minutes! I heard and saw this set some years ago, but it is clearly off the mark. I have the ROH set and the timing is listed at 170 minutes. I relistened to it and it checks in at around 128 minutes. There are extras which may boost the timing to 170 but this figure clearly is off the mark as far as the opera is concerned.

As far as Juan diego Florez is concerned, this set is significant. After the run he announced that he was dropping the role! A pity as he is ideal, but the man knows his voice better than we do; thus we must respect his decision and be thankful that it at least has been memorialized. His decision is interesting in that one of his predecessors counted the Duke as one of his signature roles. Tito Schipa has left records documenting his mastery of the role; I assume that he sang it at the old Met--a very large house, larger than any in Europe. Schipa did nothave a large voice: old 78's document this as well as his repertoire. If I am wrong, I trust that corrections will follow. At any rate conductors did respect vocal size in those days. Remember too, that de Luca was considered a great Rigoletto and he was not blessed with an immense voice, a Warren size voice. Florez is marvelous, elegant, musical and charmiing in his depravity. All the duke's arias are rendered with a bel canto sensitivity which surely is what Verdi intended. Damrau matches her Duke with equal musicality and sensitivity. I can only repeat myself by sayiing that her two great arias are exquisitely molded with legato and beauty. As coloraturas go she has a larger voice than, say Galli-Curci, but no less sensitivity to line. Zeljko Lucic (sorry no diacriticals) may not be Italian and the tone may not be as ""sappy"" as Warren's (or another greatly underrated American baritone, Robert Weede). But it is a performance to be reckoned with: dramatically and musically satisfyiing, involved and committed. I have to make mention of the Sparafucile: Georg Zeppenfeld. A young man blessed with a black sound that is reminiscent of Gottlob Frick--high praise. Is there a Haen, a Hunding in his future? One can hope.

As to the production I suspect I will have to hedge a bit. Lenhoff is responsible for a somewhat goofy reimagining of Lohengrin, an updating of Dialogue of the Carmelites from Hamburg, a wonderful Tristan from Glyndebourne and a Parsifal that is a mixture of the outre and the wonderful. In the two Wagner opera there are bonus lectures provided which are pedantic in the extreme. One can hardly absorb half of what he is saying. Poulenc and Verdi are spared his academic pontificating. He has updated Poulenc to the (presumably) Nazi era. this has had little or no effect on the opera; after all the henchmen of the French revolution were thugs of the same stripe as the SS. Rigoletto in its time did, of course, have political ramifications and Verdi was obligated to make changes in the source material. As near as I can determine Lenhoff has not offered any political parallel. The Duke's court is dissolute as is the Duke, the courtiers support this amorality: in other words the essentials of Rigoletto are followed in a way that most of us are used to. That the costumes are (more or less) contemporary is really not important and no one wanting a first class Rigoletto should let this be a barrier to acquiring this set.",1289174400,16,4295,4.591145833333333
4219110,5,B003Y58CKS,"I began to watch this DVD with bated breath, that is, until I heard the singers sing.  Each one is superb.  I especially wondered how Juan Diego Florez would fare as the Duke of Mantua, but once he started singing, I breathed easily land enjoyed the show.  Both Florez and Diana Damrau brought their bel canto expertise and superb vocalism to the service of Verdi's music.  The Rigoletto, Zeljko Lucic, ran the gamut from tenderness with his Gilda to thundering fury with everyone else.  I also liked the production.  At first, when Rigoletto was putting on his grease paint during the overture, I was afraid that it might be a typical ""Euro-trash"" production, with a bit of warmed over I Pagliacci. But the sets and dramatic action really served the music and libretto.  I would have to say that I came to a deeper understanding and appreciation of the story and characters as a result of seeing this performance.  Rigoletto doesn't get any better than this.",1288396800,52,959,4.734939759036145
4219111,5,B003Y58CKS,"An extraordinary performance, not to be missed.  All the leads, even Florez, transcend their stardom to get down to their characters and the performance is faithful to the score.  Wondrous is this.  And real.  And believable.

The only more fascinating performance of Rigoletto I can think of, after 50 years of listening, is the Callas/Gobbi one (the studio one, NOT the live one when Mme C sang sharp as chalk against a blackboard).  But that performance is only on c/d's...and, let this be said out loud, not entirely faithful to the score (though even back then Mme C was leading the way by not concluding The Quartet with a high C).

Do, please, if you love this opera, treat yourself to this dvd.  It will be a long time before you hear it better performed, I don't care what all star casts have already had their bash at it.  This is the Rigoletto dvd I'm going to go back to.

Disclosures:  I have no financial interest in its sales, nor any acquaintance whatsoever with the performers or anyone else involved.  I'm just a plain old fashioned opry freak.",1288137600,83,1062,4.590425531914893
4219112,1,B003Y58CKS,"... is that you can trade it in and get some of your money back to buy a better production.  (In my case, the one with Leo Nucci).",1334707200,3,130,3.642857142857143
4219113,5,B003Y58CKS,"First, I would like to state that I generally like ""Traditional"" Productions.  Most new takes on a ""Classic"" don't always work for me.  Yet, every so often a piece is so well thought out by the director and cast that I can honestly say ""My eyes have been opened.""  This is such a production.  In general it reminds me of the Pre-Nazi Germany of the musical CABARET.  It works for me.  However, what truly raises the ""Ante"" is an excellent singing and acting cast.  Things in the pit are also great.  The three leads all sing wonderfully and act naturally.  They really dig into their characters.  I also found the Sparafucile another new great bass voice with a sonorous low F.  He also acts credibly. The sets especially in Act III work well.  Damrau, Florez and Lucic are the best we have today for these roles; and are great even when compared to anyone's  ideal of a long past GOLDEN ERA!  A dream Quartet for any era.  Sure it's Modern and creative but it works and works very well with both the music and the libretto.",1327276800,4,1024,4.43010752688172
4219114,5,B003Y58CKS,"The staging here is a bit unconventional.  It puts the characters in modern dress to act out a story that could only take place in a past era.  It also contained some apparently symbolic elements, such as minor characters costumed as predatory animals and a bit of nudity, but it worked for me.  The singing is superb, particularly from Rigoletto and his daughter (the Duke's voice struck me as a little thin in tone).  The only objection I can muster is that the audio balance emphasized the voices at the expense of the orchestra.",1325462400,,532,4.627659574468085
4219115,2,B003Y58CKS,"I beg to differ with all those who give this dvd 5, 4, even 3 stars. To say that I was disappointed is to put it mildly. Based on the strength of the cast, I thought that this would be an excellent addition to my collection. Instead, I kept wondering why I wasted my money on this dvd. Having just heard barely three weeks ago a wonderful staged performance of Rigoletto--sung by two unknowns who can put both Lucic and Damrau to shame-- I must conclude that some singers have better luck than others.

Let's not dwell on the shortcomings of the production, which are plenty. The nudity in act I is unnecessary; the blue cubicle in the second part of the same act is distracting and the embrace of the Duke and Gilda during the quartet in Act III is totally absurd. Also ludicrous is having Gilda sing the entire finale standing up, when she's supposed to be dying! It's not as if Diana Damrau doesn't have the breath control required to sing sitting or even lying on her back, as she demonstrates during Caro Nome. Gilda herself comes across as a spoiled brat, not as a sheltered, naive young girl. It may be that Damrau sees her as a stronger personality that we are accustomed, but I don't get the feeling that she identifies with the part. And the masks!! I found myself laughing out loud at times. Frankly, I think this production is pathetic.

But opera is after all about singing. On that score, I find that Lucic never rises to the part. While he has a beautiful voice, I don't think he ""owns"" the character yet--or at least did not when this video was recorded. His ""Si vendetta"" lacks force, to say the least. Damrau's singing is perhaps not as sweet as I expected; however, her technique and breath control are admirable. Florez, while in splendid voice, seems ill at ease most of the time,which detracts from his performance. Zeppenfeld has the dark bass for Sparafucile but his acting makes the character seem like a madman, which Sparafucile is not. Maddalena acquits herself decently. The minor characters I found sub par.

I'm fairly certain that I will not be watching this Rigoletto again. Perhaps if I just listen to it, it may sound different. But I give it only 2 stars, which I think is more than plenty.",1310342400,9,2226,4.532338308457711
4219116,4,B003Y58CKS,"There are positives and negatives here.
First the positives: The singers - all of them- are extraordinary! Lucic is certainly today's leading Verdi baritone, Damrau is radiant and sings beautifully, and Florez sings the Duke splendidly, first embellishing then capping the cabaletta, ""Possente amor"" with a magnificent high C. A real find is the Sparafucile, Georg Zeppenfeld. Remember the name - he will go far. And, from an acting point of view, they are as good as any opera singers ever were. Also, Fabio Luisi paces the orchestra superbly.

Now, the negatives:
This is one of the most moronic, ridiculous production of an opera I have ever seen. I could not figure out what the director, Nikolaus Lehbhoff, was trying to do by setting the second scene of the first act in Gilda's bedroom and with Damrau being dressed in what appeared to be a white evening gown. Was he perhaps trying to suggest (against everything in the score) that Gilda was a prostitute and Rigoletto her pimp? Also, the courtiers wore masks that made them look like some kind of insects in the second act. What that was supposed to signify only Lehnhoff knows.

Hopefully, Virgin will release this splendin performance on an audio CD so that it might be enjoyed without Lehnhoff's distractions.

PS: Just last week I saw Lucic perform Rigoletto at the MET, again under the baton of Maestro Luisi. Hard to believe, but he may have sung even better at the MET and Maestro Luisi even made the 2 minute prelude sound like an opera all by itself! Again, superb singing and acting from a great baritone!",1305158400,3,1574,4.779411764705882
4219117,5,B003Y58CKS,"I have seen many Rigolettos at the Met, and Leonard Warren was to me the consummate jester.  However, I have never heard a cast so completely perfect as the one on this DVD.  Have given copies to my opera friends, and they all agree it is the best cast ever. SO believable--the arrogant Duke with looks to match, the divine Gilda, the incredible jester, and an amazing Sparafucile, have give me hours of pleasure.",1304380800,2,413,4.5675675675675675
4219118,3,B003Y58CKS,"Rigoletto is a great opera.  Its greatness relies, essentially, on two simple ingredients:  Victor Hugo's tragic story (""Le Roi s'amuse""), and Verdi's gorgeous music.  It's too bad that so many stage directors feel compelled to toy with that powerful formula:  whether it's the costuming of the jester, or in this case, a production that takes the meat-and-potatoes tragedy and twists it into a lemon meringue travesty.

First the pluses, and they are huge pluses.  The singing by the central trio and the chorus is, as most reviewers have pointed out, outstanding.  It is highlighted by the pure tone of Diana Damrau, whose beautiful voice is capable of handling any of the score's challenges.  The Serbian baritone, Zeljko Lucic, makes for a formidable Rigoletto, and Juan Diego Florez's bright tenor voice, soars brilliantly, and enthusiastically, up to the house ""gods.""  The conductor, Fabio Luisi, also manages to elicit a forceful and spirited Verdian sound from the Dresden Staatskapelle.

Sadly, the rest of the production's variables are quite uneven.  Sometimes, the sets lend an appropriate context to the performance (e.g., Act II, the Duke's palace), and at other times, they raise more questions than answers (e.g., Act I, the blue bedroom cubicle).

Some stage directors, including certainly Nikolaus Lehnhoff, seem to want to make sure that they're noticed, and in behalf of bringing a new, or unique, slant to a production, their creative impulse leads them to this or that idiosyncratic interpretation of a particular scene that might make some sense to a few initiates, but ends up, for the most part, distracting from the performance, rather than complementing it.  The conspicuous nudity in Act I, for example, is going to get our attention, but is it really necessary.  The sterile blue bedroom cubicle in the 2nd half of Act I is sufficiently unusual as to get our attention, but it seems more a lingering distraction than performance-enhancing.  And the perplexing  embrace of the Duke with Gilda during the opera's signature quartet in Act III is another example of an attention-grabbing absurdity.

Other problems exist with some of the acting.  Lucic, especially, directs too much of his attention to the audience, instead of his daughter, during a couple of their poignant duets together.  When, in the course of Rigoletto's forceful ode to vengeance at the conclusion of Act II, for example, Gilda sings, ""O mio padre, what a fierce joy flashes in your eyes,"" their lack of dramatic coordination is all too evident, because she never could have seen his eyes, ... she is backstage, and he is front, facing the audience the whole time.

There may not be many better singing performances of this opera, but for dvds, my preference would be the Carlos Alvarez, Rigoletto (at Barcelona), with Inva Mula and Marcelo Alvarez as the Duke, although the jester's rubber suit that Carlos Alvarez has to wear was poorly conceived.  My 2nd choice would be Leo Nucci's Rigoletto at Verona with Mula and Aquiles Machado as the Duke; the production values at Verona are quite satisfactory, even though they had to be particularly challenging given that this open air venue seats 20,000.

[It is worth noting that the picture and sound of this Lucic Rigoletto are of a high quality, although it is also worth noting that the Amazon product details contain a number of errors.  For one, the production's aspect ratio is widescreen (1.77:1), and not 1.33:1 as listed.  2.)  There are five different language subtitles, including English, although Amazon lists only the German.  3.)  Running time is 130-plus minutes as distinguished from the 90 minutes listed.  Lastly, the audio format includes 5.0 DTS surround, in addition to the listed two channel stereo].",1303689600,20,3772,5.099348534201955
4219119,5,B003Y58CKS,"Verdi's Rigoletto is the opera that turned me, many years ago, into a severe opera fan.  It was the first opera recording that I owned plus it was the first live production of an opera that I ever witnessed.  Throughout the years I have heard and witnessed many, many performances of Rigoletto because it truly is a favorite opera of mine.  Therefore, upon listening and viewing this 2008 performance from Sachsische Staatskapelle Dresden, I required a short time to adjust especially to the ""modern"" production of the opera that is on this DVD.  After I allowed myself to adjust to this minimalistic staging and, more or less, modern dress, I found myself really enjoying this rather stark production.  As far as the musical sides of things were concerned, there were far less need for any adjustment on my part because almost instantaneously I found the singing and orchestra playing to be marvelous.

Diana Damrau sings spectacularly as Gilda.  She has it all-wonderful  coloratura, easy lovely high notes, a nice full middle register with the ability to phrase wonderfully, lovely trills and she acts very believability portraying a Gilda  with just the right amount of vulnerability that's not too sticky sweet for after all she is willing to  die for her man.  I enjoyed her very much.  Zeljko Lucic as Rigoletto sings sonorously well able to meet all of the vocal challenges that Verdi throws at him and acting the tormented, guilt ridden and full of secrets character of Rigoletto so very well.  I was a little afraid for Juan Florez's singing of the Duke mainly because I had only previously heard him ""do"" Rossini; however,  he brushed my fears aside very quickly singing a Duke with ease of high notes and the ability to negotiate the coloratura passages splendidly.  Plus his portrayal of a ""rake"" was very good.  I also loved the bosomy Maddalena of Christa Mayer. In fact, all of the secondary roles are done very well.

 The orchestra is greatly led by Fabio Luisi whose approach is very lyrical and dramatic.  The chorus sounds so wonderful and very much in tune.  I really enjoyed this performance of a favorite opera.",1299888000,3,2135,4.845303867403315

Keeping Gilda in her bedroom for the entire first act -- metaphorically or not -- makes for credulity problems when encountering the Duke in the initial seduction scene (are we to believe he rapes her then and there...? and later too?...or??).  However, the final bedroom scene in the room with the night sky and stars simulated was effective in conveying her ""starry-eyed"" emotional state.

And of course, I must be an old fuddy-duddy (very probable), but having partially nude party party guests in the opening scenes distracts me from the story being told and the singing being done...and after all, ""the play's the thing"". I am not so jaded as to find nude women (or men) business as usual, so I must deal with my squirmy distracted-from-the-opera-itself feelings because of it. I ""get it""...the duke's a libertine and his court is dissolute --- I don't need to have a cartoon picture drawn with big black crayon and then a flashing neon arrow pointing to the ""sexed-up bits"".  Likewise when the duke was mechanically ""feeling up"" Maddelena....unnecessary and distracting.

Diana Damrau was wonderful..vocally secure and detailed...and dramatically good although I felt was playing Gilda, not being Gilda.  I never felt much for her in her portrayal, she just seemed so darned competent, not vulnerable and naive, but all things considered she was super. Lucic had very good moments, although his voice is limited and was not ideal.  His portrayal likewise had some very good moments -- he is a believable Rigoletto and a very like-able actor/singer.

In my view, Florez was not a success.  He is not a natural stage actor and his nervousness and discomfort transmit strongly to the viewer.  His voice didn't quite reach to all the corners and crannies of the role and frankly disappeared here and there.  I could have enjoyed him nonetheless if he wasn't such an awkward-deer-in-the-headlights-terrified actor.  He was hands down the most unconvincing duke I have seen and I've seen a bunch (see fuddy-duddy remark above).

Loved the Sparafucile...a real black bass at last!  The other players were unremarkable so I won't remark!",1293753600,10,2302,5.021052631578947
4219124,5,B003Y58CKS,"Juan Diego Florez is a fabulous Duke- Gilda,(Diana Damrau) really acts the part of a girl transported by her first love.
This is a Rigoletto worth adding to any opera collection.",1293753600,2,178,4.774193548387097
4219125,5,B003Y58CKS,"I have just watched and am now coming down from this wonderful production.  It cannot be compared to the excellent Ponnelle because that is a filmed production with exquisite appropriate real settings.  In my opinion, it is better than the MacVicar which is also staged and to which I gave five stars.  Nothing else currently out on DVD deserves mention.

As everyone else has noted, this deserves the full (if not more) five stars.  But going through the reviews, it seems that one aspect of the direction of Lehnhoff and the acting of Damrau and Lucic has been missed.  In this production Gilda is furious with her father for his overprotectiveness and for penning her up.  Damrau's Gilda is not the insipid little girl as she is usually played, she is a determined innocent who is led astray (to say the least) by her complete lack of experience, and being cloistered and motherless.  Little wonder that she is entranced by the handsome charismatic duke (Florez) with all that leads to.  She is also most certainly not helped by a father who is far too caught up in his own feelings to pay more than lip service to his daughter.  Lehnhoff's direction emphasises this.  She is emotionally let down again and again throughout the opera by her father.  Therein lies the tragedy.",1292716800,9,1278,4.733031674208145
4219126,5,B003Y58CKS,"Diana Damrau is amazing!  Amazing that she can act so well and still sing.  Amazing that she can sing so well and still act!  Juan Diego Florez and Zeljko Lucic are also superb as the duke and Rigoletto.  But Damrau is the main attraction.  You'll never find a version as well sung and acted.  A slight caveat regarding euro-trash costumes but these can be rationalized as appropriate for the court revels.  Visually and dramatically my favorite is still the Ponnelle film with Luciano Pavarotti, Ingvar Wixell, and Edita Gruberova. But for a live production, I like this one best.",1292544000,2,581,4.808080808080808
4219127,5,B003Y58CKS,"Performances of ""Rigoletto"" (both on CD and DVD) are plentiful, and there are so many out there that it's pretty difficult to decide on one definitive version.  Most opera buffs will have several versions.  I've heard and seen most of these CDs and and DVDs, and all of them have something to say in one way or another.  That said, I'm just about ready to consider this incredible DVD performance from Dresden as the best one of the lot.  The entire opera emerges as something fresh and new.  A portion of this success comes from the tautness of the drama that is achieved by conductor Fabio Luisi.  His pacing of the opera is compelling, dramatic, yet always beautiful.  The three principal roles are taken by three outstanding artists ---- opera superstars all.  Zeljko Lucic, who's already proven himself as one of the great Verdi baritones of the day (his Macbeth at the Met was extraordinary), is to me anyway, the greatest Rigoletto since Tito Gobbi (who recorded the opera with Maria Callas and Giuseppe di Stefano in the legendary EMI La Scala recoding).  He rages, he schemes, he contorts, and his love for his daughter Gilda is poignant and moving.  Gilda herself has rarely appeared as lovely as Diana Damrau makes her.  She's a top notch coloratura soprano, yet never resorts to the ""pecking"" and ""coo-coo"" bird sounds that have plagued so many coloratura sopranos.  She produces a beautiful legato line, especially in the beautiful ""Tutte le feste"", where she tells her father about what was perpetrated on her.  Yet at the same time, she has a florid technique which enables her to sing a perfectly controlled ""Caro Nome"", with all the coloratura embellishments.  It's a masterful performance to set alongside such Gilda interpreters as Erna Berger, Maria Callas, and Anna Moffo (all three of whom made Gilda far more than the usual cardboard coloratura songbird),

  Finally, it's the Duke of Juan Diego Florez which puts the frosting on the this delicious cake.  He sang this role first in Lima, and followed it up in this Dresden production.  He reportedly decided after these Dresden ""Rigoletto"" performances that he didn't feel ""vocally comfortable"" with it (this role is somewhat weightier than the Rossini-Bellini-Donizetti ""bel canto"" operas that he specializes in) and has not undertaken it since.  While I commend him for the care and attention he pays to his magnificent ""tenore di grazia"" vocal endowment,  I can emphatically say that he sounds as fabulous as ever without a hint of strain or effort.  His Duke is truly young, energetic, and superbly sung.  Florez may well again decide to sing this role at a later time, but how fortunate that he is captured here on this great DVD.

  I cannot recommend this performance strongly enough.  Yes ---- it's THAT good!",1292198400,9,2791,4.9081196581196584
4219128,5,B003Y58CKS,"One of the most dramatic and tragic of operas, Verdi's masterpiece is being brought to new life in this German production.
In the title role, Serbian baritone Zeljko Lucic portrayed a burly Rigoletto; not really 'hunchback' (though the 'bag' has always been there inside the costumes), but a towering figure both in terms of looks and voice.
His portrayal is still fine, even if not in the traditional tragic-buffo school.  Lucic has a huge voice, and he is at the same time able to paint varying shades with his large instrument.  May be he will be a even finer Iago or Macbeth. This conjures up the vexing question of how to cast Rigoletto - I saw Gallo live in this role, and is similary plagued by his height.
In the other two lead roles, the physically petite-vocally limpid Diana Damrau is a jewel of a Gilda. It would have been a vocally 'perfect' Gilda had she assumed this role 5 years earlier, before the 16 Die Zauberflote productions robbed Damrau of a considerable amount of her vocal lustre. As it now is, hers is still an exemplary performance, and this is particularly true of her acting skills.  Her vocal technique is rock solid as ever, and her vocal acting never yielded a single inch to the best sopranos who assumed this role.
Juan Diego Florez is not entirely comfortable in the role of the Duke of Mantua vocally, but his acting is also oustanding and believable. His chemistry with Damrau's Gilda works really well.
The truly outstanding portrayal in this wonderful production is Zeppenfeld as Sparafucile, the Burgundian killer. The voice is a dark bass; Max von Egmond comes to mind immediately upon hearing Zeppenfeld. This is a very rare breed of bass voice.
The true glamour of this production, unmistably, lies with the director and the conductor.  The staging is also superb.
While I generally detest nudities in operas, the Act I nudities in this production is neither excessive nor distracting; indeed, it is appropriate to the plot and never out of place with the entire stage setup.
The staging is modern and minimalist, but the lightings are very effective, and the costumes (masks included) very well designed. Overall, this is modern, but no Eurotrash.  If only all modern European operatic productions could reach this level, well, why should it not be encouraged?",1291593600,5,2304,4.83756345177665
4219129,5,B003Y58CKS,"If you're considering buying a dvd of Rigoletto, this is the one to buy!
Why?: The music, the singing, the acting, and the staging and costumes.

First of all, there are the beautiful melodies of Verdi, performed in full rich sound by the Dresden Stattskapelle (officially called the Sachsische Staatskapelle Dresden), very ably conducted by Fabio Luisi.

The performers are brilliant, not only in their singing, but their acting as well. Many will delight in the demonic, crazed look of Zeljko Lucic as Rigoletto, as he confronts the Duke's courtiers who abducted his daughter, Gilda. Lucic has a huge voice matching his acting and dominance of the other characters on stage.

Yes, Diana Damrau, as Gilda, sings all the high notes (and of course, all the other notes) perfectly and with acting and reactions to other actors that make this a dramatic and moving performance. Juan Diego Florez is an excellent match for Gilda both in flawless singing and acting that inspires infatuation for and disgust at the Duke of Mantua.

It should be mentioned that the staging and costumes also contribute much to the beauty of this production. In the opening scene with the Duke and his court, his courtiers and ladies are dressed with masks and costumes resembling birds, lizards, and insects. There is some frontal nudity, but don't let this and the costumes put you off. It helps get across the depravity and the debauchery of the sex-crazed Duke of Mantua and his court, which inspires Rigoletto in his quest for vengeance.

This is the best Rigoletto in decades, if not the best one ever!",1291420800,,1584,4.895522388059701
4219130,5,B003Y58CKS,"Rigoletto is one of my two favorite operas (Donizetti's Lucia is the other) so whenever a new production is available, I'm eager to embrace it.  This one really delivered the goods-- especially the magnificent singing of the three principles. I was pleasantly surprised to witness a brilliant performance by Juan Diego Flores as the Duke (It's always fascinated me that Verdi composed breathtakingly beautiful arias for one of the most despicable characters in the tenor pantheon of opera characters.).  He is a gifted artist, but one I thought was more suited to the light Bel Canto roles he has performed so well in his stellar career. He was vocally splendid, but also had the stage presence to capture the decadant nature of his character. Unlike many Dukes, he was gloriously handsome, which made him even more believable as a cad that so many women would easily fall for.  Diane Damrau was heartbreakingly effective as the doomed Gilda. She has a brilliant colatura along with the natural wholesome beauty to make her role so believable. Her death scene was almost too painful to watch.  What really elevated this Rigoletto to unparalled heights for me, though, was the performance of Zeljko Lucic in the title role. I don't agree with the assessment of Rigoletto's character shared by a couple of the other reviewers.  I believe he is a character to be pitied.  The core of the story is the father/daughter relationship.  Gilda is his life, and knowing the tragic outcome makes Rigoletto a great object of pity. Zeljko captured the pathos of his character with his magnificent singing, but even more so, with his brilliant acting. This was particularly evident in the ACT III scene when Rigoletto enters the antechamber of the Duke's castle feigning gaiety, knowing full well that the Duke's courtiers have kidnapped Gilda. His powerful ""Cortigiani vil razza dannata"" (Courtiers, vile race of the damned!) aria movingly captured his pathos and was the most moving highlight of the opera for me.
  My only criticism would be the staging of the opera. But that's more a reflection of my traditionalist  preference for opera to stick to the period for which it's composers intended it to be presented in.",1291075200,4,2208,4.975543478260869
4219131,4,B003Y58CKS,"This is a highly enjoyable DVD. Rigoletto is one of my favorite operas and I have seen and listened to it often. If you are new to opera it is a not a bad choice for a first opera. The characters are rapidly developed and the scenes all move quickly. The conducting by Luisi, orchestra, and chorus are all excellent. The staging here is interesting if somewhat distracting and emphasizes the lust of the Duke. I hope that the reviewer who said that Florez plans to drop this role from his repertoire is correct. It sounds to me like he is pushing and there is clearly some intonation issues on a couple of his high notes in this performance. Overall he does a great job. Damrau as Gilda is superb. Her death scene gave me goose bumps. Lucic performs and sings the role of Rigoletto very well. I agree with the other reviewer that the commercial recording on EMI (CD) with Callas, DiStefano, and Gobbi should be listened to. The Callas voice for many is an acquired taste but the performance is fabulous. DiStefano's voice in 1955 when the recording was made was still largely intact. Early DiStefano 1944-1955 documents what can happen to a  incredibly beautiful voice when pushed into heavy roles(Trovatore and Forza). Gobbi was one of the leading baritones of his generation and a great singing actor. Sutherland, Pavarotti, and Milnes on CD is well sung but emotinally bland. Maybe generic is a better word. It does document the Duke of Pavarotti which should be listened to. The DVD from the Met with Domingo, Cotrubas, and McNeil brings back memories of my college years in New York. It is as stated elsewhere a more traditional production. Excellent cast none of would be on my ideal cast list.",1290988800,5,1700,4.666666666666667

8408657,4,B003Y58CKS,"The triangle leads of Duke, Jester, and Gilda in this production are magnificent emotionally and musically. The beasitary costuming and settings are over-the-top but delectable, with the direction alternatively fun and muddled. The result is occasionally camp, but highly entertaining. But you will need your own libretto to follow the text, as the subtitles, whether you rely on the German, French, or English, are at best occasional, and bear about as much resemblance to the Italian as Starbuck's drink titles do to their Italian models. The production provides about one subtitle for every ten to twenty sentences, and its relationship to the exact text of the original is at best approximate, and as often, mystifying.

But Diana Damarau can really act, and is delicious as Gilda, especially as she revels in her new found love with the smarmy lothario portrayed with a huge pomade and horse-tail by Juan Diego Florez.  Zeljiko Lucic's Rigoletto turns Rigoletto into a Balkan tragedy steeped in blood and sorrow. He's a living nightmare of a man, and each of them delight. Yes, Damarau is too mature and knowledgable to be young Gilda, but for me, she makes it all work regardless.

Shame on the producers of this DVD for the lackadaisical subtitling, which really fails to respect the audience.  Download the libretto or use one from any Verdi collection, and all is again well with the world, if not for poor Rigoletto and Gilda.",1352592000,,1436,4.99581589958159

8408659,5,B003Y58CKS,"Rigoletto is a truly great opera of Guiseppe Verdi, composed in the same period as La Traviata and Il Trovatore. It is most difficult to pull it off well. This performance done in Dresden is sheer perfection with a dream cast in a European production.  Diane Damrau as Gilda, Juan Diego Florez as Il Duca and Zeljko Lucic as Rigoletto are all first rate. There is female nudity and a decadent elegance of the characters in bizarre headdresses that may be a turn-off for some. Juan Diego Florez plays against type here as the Duke Of Mantua. His angelic voice and genial spirituality is put to work here as tools for rampant seduction rather than the romantic heroism for which is known in the roles of my favored Gaetano Donizetti operas where he excels as Nemorino and Tonio in  ""L'Elisir d'Amore"" and ""La Fille Du Regiment,"" respectively. Florez here is visually spellbinding and vocally untouchable.  The chemistry between Florez and Damrau draws them together incredibly. Diana Damrau is a lovely, visionary and vocally apt Gilda. But it is Zeljko Lucic who commands and compels as the court jester Rigoletto. Spooked by a curse, (La Maledizione, the original title of this opera,)  which frightens him, this Rigoletto's pain is visceral as he resorts to the dispicable act of ordering the murder of the Duke which results in his profound loss. I've long pondered why Verdi allows the violated Gilda to sacrifice her life for the disloyal Duke when Mozart condemns Don Giovanni to Hell. Though Gilda loves the Duke with a steadfast first love, she knows, too, that a future life in Verona with her father Rigoletto would result only in more confinement for her sans love and marriage, making her sacrifice an easier choice. Damrau and Lucic perform Gilda and Rigoletto in the Metropolitan Opera's new version set in Las Vegas which can be viewed in Live in HD in theaters on Saturday, February 16, 2013.",1342828800,3,1907,4.840490797546012
