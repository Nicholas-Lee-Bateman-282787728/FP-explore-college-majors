hopy at his best along with all his side kicks,fun to watch .
if you like old time western action this is the western to see!",1198886400,,288,7.757575757575758
2117697,5,B0002S64EQ,"What's not to like with five Hoppy movies?  Although one of the five has some transfer problems, the joy of watching square-shootin', rootin'-tootin' Hoppy and his Bar-20 companions take on the bad guys is truly a fun way to spend some hours.  Any western movie aficionado will love these films.  Looking forward to collecting all the sets in their glorious black-and-white Lone Pine settings.  William Boyd remains one of the definitive cowboys of the genre.",1179273600,,459,5.08
2117698,4,B0002S64EQ,"Good quality so far.  I like the early movies with Gabby Hayes the best, but these are really quite entertaining.",1170720000,,113,4.65
2117699,5,B0002S64EQ,"The quality is so good that you will think you are watching brand new prints in the best theater on Main Street in the 1940s. Actually it's probably better than that. The intro says these digital re-masters were done by a company named ""US Television Office, Inc."". For goodness sake, every person or studio who has old prints TAKE THEM TO ""US TELEVISION OFFICE, INC."" AND GET THEM RE-MASTERED. Platinum has released 8 volumes of these Hoppy feature films and I own all 8. But for some strange reason, probably only known to some ""power lunch"" executive, they did not number the volumes...so you will just have to tell the difference by the numbers Amazon gives them. They are worth twice or 3 times the price. There were 66 Hopalong Cassidy films made starring William Boyd, and you can own 40 of them with these 8 volumes at a slim price.",1170028800,6,840,4.569536423841059
2117700,4,B0002S64EQ,"Once again Hopalong Cassidy rides across the screen guns a blazing. If you want to go back to your early days when movies were a treat get this collection of Hopalong Cassidy (William Boyd)movies.  ""In Old California"" is a classic in which Hoppy comes to the rescue of a friend of Hoppy's boss.  It is full of action, suspense, and any movie with California Carlson is always a belly laugh that we all need from time to time.

These movies are perfect for the parent concerned with what their children watch on TV.  They are full of examples supplied by Hoppy, California, and Lucky showing how to live without drinking alcohol, smoking, or use of bad language.  They never harm or show disrespect to women, and are a great visual example of how to be an adult, for all kids to see and admire.",1121126400,2,793,4.479166666666667
2117701,5,B0002S64EQ,"One of the most outstanding series of westerns began in 1935 from Paramount Pictures ""Hopalong Cassidy"", under the guiding hand of producer Harry ""Pop"" Sherman...continued well into the '40s proved to be the most successful 'B' Westerns ever made...based on Clarence E. Mulford's stories, they strived in changing Cassidy's image, which was both original and influential...the hero, played by William Lawrence Boyd, was mature and a man of his word...the plots were solid with a sudden burst of climactic action in the last reel, usually a frantic chase backed by tension building music...the Hoppy series produced by Harry ""Pop"" Sherman is arguably the best ""B"" western series ever made...its production values were miles above any other and they always had the look and feel of more expensive ""A"" features...their beautiful outdoor location photography is exceptional for a ""B"" product.

In all, Boyd made sixty-six Hopalong Cassidy Westerns, early films included Uncle Ben and Windy Halliday, both played by veteran actor George ""Gabby"" Hayes...was a steady favorite as a hitchrack, was chosen five years in succession as one of the 10 best money-making Western sidekick stars...like most western comics, had his share of narrow escapes being thrown from his horse, burned by blanks...but that was all in a days work...his one-liners will never be forgotten...""You're dern tootin'""...""Never trust a female, they're pure poyzin""...or my all-time favorite ~ ""Persnickgordy Women""...this crusty old-timer stole many a scene from John Wayne, Randolph Scott and yes even William Boyd.

In this Volume Three we have five films of the following:

IN OLD COLORADO (1941-B&W-66 mins)
Boyd (Hoppy), Andy Clyde (California Jack Carlson), Russell Hayden (Lucky Jenkins), Margaret Hayes (Myra Woods), Morris Ankrum (Joe Weiler), Sarah Padden (Harriet Ma Woods), Stanley Andrews (George Davidson), Cliff Nazarro (Nosey Haskins), Eddy Waller (Jim Stark)

Ma Woods sends for the Bar 20 boys and Buck Peters agrees to purchase her cattle to pay off some past notes...along the way Hoppy is robbed of the money for the cattle with the finger pointing at George Davidson...Hoppy's instincts tell him someone else is behind all this cattle rustling...after patching up the feud between Ma Wood and Davidson the real identity of the ring leader is about to be sprung...a big shoot out of all B-Westerns, having every member of the Paramount lot that could carry a gun in the final scene...once again Hoppy and the Bar 20 boys bring harmony and peace to the valley in Old Colorado!

LEATHER BURNERS (1942-B&W-58 mins)
Boyd (Hoppy), Andy Clyde (California Jack Carlson), Jay Kirby (Johnny Travers), Victor Jory (Dan Slack), George Reeves (Harrison Brooke), Hal Taliaferro (Lafe), George Givot (Sam Bucktoe), Ellanora Needles (Sharon Longstreet)

Rustled cattle is he plot of this Hoppy Adventure...Johnny Travers (Kirby) sends for his old pal and foreman of the Bar 20 to help find the mysteriously vanishing cattle...Hoppy's keen senses immediately suspect Dan Slack (Jory) and he is in cahoots with Sam Bucktoe (Givot) who uses his mine to keep stolen cattle...is this case to tough for Hoppy...can he clear himself of a murder charge...will our hero in black find out the truth and put things right...don't go away we're about to go into action and burn some leather!

STAGECOACH WAR (1940-B&W-63 mins)
Boyd (Hoppy), Russell Hayden (Lucky Jenkins), Britt Wood (Speedy), Julie Carter (Shirley Chapman), Harvey Stephens (Neal Holt), J. Farrell McDonald (Jeff Chapman), Eddy Waller (Wells Fargo Agent Quince), Eddie Dean (Tom the henchman)

Two longtime enemies are bidding on a mail contract via stage line...Hoppy, Lucky and Speedy of the Bar 20 a bringing a her of horses for Jeff Chapman...the love interest is between Neal Holt and Shirley Chapman...Holt is the other interested party on the mail carrying contract now held by old man Chapman...a race is initiated between the two rivals, whoever wins the race will have the mail contract...is there devilment afoot during the race...can Lucky bring himself to ease up on the reins as Shirley's life is in peril...are the two Holt and Chapman going to be at odds forever...well, buckaroos Hoppy just won't stand by and let a stagecoach war happen!

SINISTER JOURNEY (1948-B&W-60 mins)
Boyd (Hoppy), Andy Clyde (California Jack Carlson), Rand Brooks (Lucky Jenkins), Elaine Riley (Jessie Garvin), John Kellogg (Lee Garvin), Don Haggerty (Harmon Roberts), Stanley Andrews (Tom Smith)

Railroad executive Tom Smith is having trouble and sends for Cassidy...his daughter eloped with Lee Garvin and he didn't approve of his daughters choice...Garvin is framed for the murder of Smith...will Hoppy be able to prove Garvin's innocence...does he have a plan to bring the guilty hombre to justice...Hoppy sees things a little more clearly than most...so don't fret Hoppy's on the case of the sinister journey...all will not go well for the villians in this picture!

THE SHOWDOWN (1940-B&W-65 mins)
Boyd (Hoppy), Russell Hayden (Lucky Jenkins), Britt Wood (Speed McGinnis), Morris Ankrum (Baron Rendor), Jan Clayton (Sue Willard), Wright Kramer (Col. Rufe White), Roy Barcroft (Bowman), Eddie Dean (Marshall), Kermit Maynard (Johnson)

An imposter posing as a Baron is the storyline...Baron Rendor (Ankrum) is planning to steal some fine race horses...Hoppy and the Bar 20 comrades arrive just in time to expose the horse thieves...the Baron prides himself as an excellent poker player and challenges Hoppy in a friendly game...Hoppy marks his bills and beats the Baron to win at poker hoping to flush him out into the open...Hoppy is robbed on the trail and the money reappears in a horse trading deal...Hoppy has him dead to rights...and Lucky as usual falls for the pretty Sue Willard (Jan Clayton)...Hoppy gets ready to leave and Lucky is trying to make up his mind about whether to stay or go with Hoppy...what do you think...is there another adventure in store or is this the real showdown!

Hoppy's interaction with Windy Halliday (George Hayes) and California Carlson (Andy Clyde) was always a shot in the arm with their down-to-earth humor and sentimentality, theses scenes are pure Americana! Boyd, with his silver hair, black clothes and white horse (Topper) rode into our lives and we've never been the same since...your children and grandchildren will enjoy this clean wholesome entertainment...Hoppy always wore two silver white handle six shooters, never drank or smoked, when the good guys always won and the moral to the story was fair-play...outstanding role model...gotta love it!

Another pick for ""Pop"" Sherman was a new sidekick for the Cassidy films...a newcomer Lucky Jenkins, played by Russell Hayden had his job cut out for him, with Boyd (as the hero) and Andy Clyde (California Carlson) for comedy, left the field of romance and action wide open, Hayden filled those ""boots"" perfectly.

William Boyd was my hero, this collection of five films are perfect, clear and give me hope for the future. Our youth should have such a hero to look up to today. Must mention the fact that I still miss one of my all-time-favorite sidekicks though, George ""Gabby"" Hayes, you're durn tootin'!

Paramount and Clarence E. Mulford's fictional western character Hopalong Cassidy comes to life through William Boyd as Hoppy and Andy Clyde as California with films from the '40s...horse operas directed by Lesley Selander and George Archainbaud...some of the best hard riding and smokin' gunplay that ever came across the big screen from the Bar 20 boys...just the way we like 'em.

2117713,3,B0002S64EQ,"Doubtful if your life will change after viewing a Hopalong Cassidy flick.  But if you're into B Westerns of a certain vintage and historic fame, not a bad way to divert an hour. Of course, maybe you have to be of a certain vintage yourself to get a satisfactory measure of pleasure out of William Boyd's  heroics--who knows?",1369008000,,324,4.568965517241379
2117714,5,B0002S64EQ,Hopalong is right in the middle of conflict as he goes after the thugs and outlaws that pestered citizens in he Wild and Wooly West. This is pure entertainment by one of the best actors who ever appeared in the picture show.,1368057600,,224,4.357142857142857

2117717,4,B0002S64EQ,These are Hopalong Cassidy movies which he made before doing the Hopalong Cassidy tv series. Character actor Edgar Buchanan is in all of the tv shows. The first 12  episodes of the Hopalong Cassidy tv series are condensed versions from his early movies. The movies and tv shows are very good shows and quite fun to watch.,1362700800,,321,4.631578947368421

2117719,5,B0002S64EQ,"What you have to remember is that the Paramount films from the 1930s and 40s were superb in every detail, but the earliest were already released through Image Entertainment as double features (those are also on Amazon for purchase). These are the second best, ignoring the last twelve that William Boyd produced himself, which drag and are very slooo[...] So slow in fact that when he edited them into TV features in the 1950s, they work better as 25 minute episodes. But overall, the picture quality is superb and so is the sound. These used to sell on VHS as single features at $14.95 each so five of them for a little more than a buck a piece is a bargain and worth the price. This company released eight DVDs, by the way, for a total of 40 of the 66 movies. I recommend you buy all eight of them.",1327363200,,800,4.34
