7977057,5,B00007JZZC,"The Beats Of The Heart series is about the most amzing musical cultural series I have ever seen.  The only dissappointment is if one expects a concert DVD.  This series goes into more depth in the cultural history and economic struggles of people than the musical elements.  It is still filled with music however, and music that you otherwise may never really hear.  This is not the produced, commercial version, this is the real people and their music.  Chase The Devil specifically was one of the best in the series and pulls no punches in describing the harsh reality of a dissappearing traditional way of life in America.  I only wish the whole series could be available at a discount in a package bundle on fewer discs.",1102896000,8,724,4.661417322834645

There were only a couple of moments that showed the people of their time that was truly informative...the rest was too over the top and repetitious...don't waste your money on this one....Down from the Mountain & Gather at the River were much more enjoyable",1049068800,,335,4.583333333333333
