196654,1,1578900026,"I love Iolanthe. I was, therefore, very disappointed by this production.  Although it was obvious that much thought (and money) had gone into preparation of the scenery, costuming, staging, etc., still it never quite worked.  Especially in the beginning, the singing seemed off-key, and even a little bit off-beat.  I thought the fairies all the way through looked and acted silly, as did the peers.  Where did all that hand-waving come from?  And the scenery became boring as scene after scene was acted in what looked like church pews and around papier-mache statues.  And why were the Lord Chancellor and the two lords in bed together???
One of the things I love about G&S is the sublime juxtaposition of intensely emotional, musically beautiful moments and silly scenes that shatter the emotion and scatter all seriousness.  I don't think this entire production ever rose above silly--the actors were all self-consciously ridiculous.  My favorite scene, where Iolanthe pleads with the Lord Chancellor--willingly sacrificing her life for her son's happiness, to the accompanying lamentation of the women's choir--was entirely spoiled by the pace of the music, which was rushed, and by the sight of feet and hands waving around above the aforesaid pews in a senseless manner.  The eruption of the fairies into the scene did not break the enchanted mood.  There was no mood to break. The fairies as ballerinas didn't work well, either.  And the peers, even in their first entrance, which is a marvelous piece of stately music, never had even the slightest hint of dignity--which ruins the audience's ""aha!"" recognition that they are very silly indeed.  Strephon, Iolanthe, and Phyllis were well-cast and well-sung, but couldn't save this plodding production.",989539200,31,1759,5.220640569395018
196655,5,1578900026,"This is one of the 1982 series of G&S productions produced by the BBC. Some of the special effects look cheesy, but of all this series I thought it translated best to the screen.

I loved the Act I finale, with the Peers all misinterpreting the relationship between Strephon and his eternally youthful fairy mother (""Her age upon the date/ of his birth was minus eight/ if she's seventeen and he is five-and-twenty!"")

And of course, the Lord Chancellor's Nightmare Song was terrific.

In all, a great introduction to this gem of an opera.",1219708800,,539,4.712765957446808
196656,4,1578900026,"Iolanthe is often overlooked in the Gilbert & Sullivan lexicon by Pirates, Mikado, Pinafore, etc.  But to my taste Iolanthe is one of the most bouncy scores and this production does not disappoint.  It greatly helps with understanding to know something about the British government and the staging helps clarify some of that.  The singing is good to excellent and the humor comes through.  I showed this to three mid-teenagers and they all thought is was ""good"" to ""cool"" to ""awesome.""  That is not to say it's for an unsophisticated audience, it is to say it is accessible to all -- I enjoyed it as much as they did.",1206748800,3,617,4.623853211009174
196657,5,1578900026,"This review is mostly written for people who don't know ""Iolanthe"" because over here in America the musical isn't very famous and is seldom put on.  I only learned about it myself by accident several years ago when it was produced by a local college in my area.  I went to see it without knowing anything about it nor even having heard anything about it.  I was bowled over by the genius of the music, comedy, story, humor and everything about this masterpiece as portrayed by the college music and drama students!

After seeing the play at the college,  I started looking for CD music and VHS tapes and DVD's of Iolanthe.  Apparently there are only TWO versions on video --- VHS or DVD---this one and one done in Canada by ""The Stratford Festival Company"".  I have both of these.  Is this one and the Stratford any good?  Some reviewers apparently think not.  But, the play---the words and music--- are ""almost indestructable"" in my humble opinion because of the genius of the two creators, Mr. Gilbert and Mr. Sullivan.  Of course, the present versions----""they could be better"" in this aspect or t'other.  But, I am grateful that there are ANY video versions of this masterpiece available at all!  Buy one or t'other of these...don't be too critical  (""the glass is half full rather than half empty"" type of attitude), listen to the music and the clever words,  and I know you'll enjoy!

Afterword:  One part of the musical play that I thought was especially funny and clever is the song,  ""Loudly Let The Trumpets Bray"".  This is the song and music when the arrogant lords, who are really silly things, come  arrogantly marching on stage with their Beefeater Costumes and their noses arrogantly in the air.  As they march on stage they sing:  ""Bow ye tradesmen bow ye masses,  bow ye lower middle classes.""  They are acting as though they are ""superior"" to these ""masses""  thus telling the masses to bow to them---the Lords of The House of Lords.  And, of course, these ""noble lords"" are actually very silly and stupid!  The effect of being told to ""bow"" to these silly guys is very funny I assure you!  :o)  Email  Boland7214@aol.co",1156723200,5,2137,4.681940700808625
196658,4,1578900026,"But, let's be honest it's the only one out there. (Oh, for a sharp focused digital one! Sharp audio would help too.) If nothing else, my buying it might (hopefully) encourage a new one.  But, I was impressed by the zeal of the cast, they were very infectious; it was all I could do not to join right in.",1131926400,3,303,4.135593220338983
196659,2,1578900026,"This production leaves much to be desired, and was ill conceived.  The singing is adequate, but the film's direction included far too much irrelevant  'business'  which detracted from the singing, and the theatrical presentation. The ballet and  the  stage 'blocking' appeared to be under rehearsed. Also, the colour is weak.  As W.S.Gilbert said (Mikado) -- 'Modified rapture'",1131580800,2,377,5.526315789473684
196660,1,1578900026,"...Because I'd rather not!  Yes, this recording is one of Brent Walker's most miserable failures, and certainly the worst I've seen.  I can deal with the cheesy costuming and sets - I can deal with the bad acting and pre-recorded orchestra - I can even deal with Pish-Tush's buck teeth in their ""Mikado"" - but I cannot deal with this.  Mutilated by ""special effects,"" the casting of this was promising if nothing else.  It's a shame that the producer did not realize that the audience is looking for a Savoy opera, not a children's cheap fairy tale video.  Gilbert was brilliant in giving Strephon the power to dissapear down to the waist, for example, but it ceases to be funny and starts to be cheesy when the filmakers actually make the actor dissapear to the waist.  Besides things such as these, other needlessly absurd things are incorperated - for instance, when Strephon and Phyllis are speaking and Phyllis looks into his pocket mirror.  To make this film more modern and dashing, a full-length bedroom mirror suddenly appeared in the forest glen where they sat.  Can someone explain to me how that is funny?
Also, I found the miters worn by some of the peers insulting.  It is a mockery of politics, not religion.

A classic example of modern artists trying to improve upon Gilbert and Sullivan, this was my first and only introduction to ""Iolanthe"" and turned me off completely to what I had thought would be a charming operetta.",1130803200,4,1440,4.724
196661,4,1578900026,"This was my first ""Iolanthe,"" and I was totally captivated.  Having been a professional dancer all of my life,  the dance world really lost out on not having Arthur Sullivan compose ballet scores.  ""Iolanthe"" screams to be danced, and in this production, much of the Fairies staging complies.

The production, though a bit shaky at times, is a joy from beginning to end.  The tongue in cheek campiness is just perfect.  Wonderful sight gags abound, most memorable being the Fairies wings hangning out to dry before they are summoned by Strephon - hysterical.

But!!!! It is the music and those AMAZING lyrics that just overwhelm you. It is truly a wonder that the human mouth can sing/speak at such lighting speed as required in the act one finale.

It is simply wonderful.",1123891200,3,773,4.803030303030303
196662,1,1578900026,"Having done the stage production of Iolanthe just a few months ago, seeing this video greatly dissapointed me.

The fairies in the beginning were cute when they first began to do pointe ballet, but as the singing and the staging and the video edits occurred, I frowned upon this production.  I didn't like the way images would appear in the Queen's fireplace, or how people would quickly show up from the forest to parliament, or even some of the sets and lighting.  The sets reminded me too much of the cardboard cutout trees found in Mary Martin's Peter Pan video.  And during the act one finale there was a television news broadcast?  What happened to good old tradition, and staying within your time period?

I didn't feel like the essence of Iolanthe was caught in this video, but then again the show was made for the stage, not for a film.  It didn't give an real sense of what the show would be like on stage either.  It appeared to me that they tried to throw in as much modern editing as they could to appeal to a new audience.  The vocals were OK, and the acting was OK, but this was nothing to write home about.",1093651200,6,1122,4.381642512077295
196663,3,1578900026,"The musical performance was excellent. However, instead of simply recording a performance, the director decided to be ""creative"" which resulted in a rather disjointed presentation. This would be better as music CD without the ""cute"" distractions of the video.",1087257600,3,259,5.666666666666667
196664,4,1578900026,"Unlike the more 'universal' works of, say, Wagner or Verdi, the Savoy operas are so time-, society- and culture-specific (late Victorian England: the Law, the Empire, the Parliament etc.) that you cannot modernise them without doing a great deal of damage.  This means retaining heavy, pageant-like costumes and sets and a rigid style of vocal delivery, which usually leads to the kind of stodgy mausoleum staging that puts so many people off Gilbert and Sullivan.
One way around this problem is to play around with form.  This charming film of arguably G&S's greatest work is thoroughly traditional in its staging, but takes a great deal of liberties with (admittedly cheap) special effects as it tries to approximate a gossamer fairy world intruding on the heavy formalism of the House of Lords.  Strange camera angles, playful acting, witty bits of business, cheeky choreography and mock newsreel footage add up to a lively, if crude, performance, while retaining all the traditional pleasures - Gilbert's glorious word-play; his devastating social satire and mocking of popular modes of sensational and sentimental melodrama; Sullivan's brilliant tightrope act between parody and emotion.
The sense of nightmare inherent in Gilbert's story of a Lord Chancellor whose love for his ward provokes the enmity of the Fairy World and the dissolution of his identity and the social assumptions he has long based on it, is brought brilliantly alive in the sequence near the end of Act 1 when the fairies engulf the Chamber; while the homosocial world Gilbert portrayed - playing on both meanings of the word 'fairy' - is deliciously foregrounded.",1000857600,17,1642,5.212121212121212
7799296,4,1578900026,"My absolute favourite G&S Operetta. I found some of the special effects tedious, and a few of the scenes annoying, but that is mostly due to the way the BBC films these; more a tv show, than an operetta. The music and story are wonderful.",1423094400,,238,4.311111111111111
7799297,5,1578900026,"The VHS was great and so was the operetta Iolanthe. I was concerned that the VHS would not be good because it was used, but I had nothing to worry about, the film was in great condition and at a very good cost, too. The story is right out of fantasy land with an obvious solution that once happens you would probably say (just as I did) now why didn't I think of that? Love will win the day. I was familiar with The pirates of Penzance, The Mikado and HMS Pinafore but never heard the words or saw the operetta played out. Am so glad that this video was offered. It is a very pleasant and funny story. The acting, dancing and singing is superb. Plus, I got to see Douglas Fairbanks Jr. who I've heard about but do not remember ever seeing. Glad of the purchase and I would recommend it. Hope that this review helps.",1397692800,,815,4.1645569620253164
7799298,5,1578900026,"There have been varying reviews on this version of Iolanthe. Most agree that the music, singing and singers were fine - I agree with this, but feel that they were, in fact, excellent. The audio is faultless with the instrumentation and vocals always syncing.

There have been complaints that the staging was more like Little (or Community) Theater. The only scene I would agree with this is the use of a newsreel after Strephon has been elected to Parliament. There is a newsreel, but its not awful. Its a little strange, but it does get over the idea that political office does bring its problems. Regardless of what you think about the newsreel, the music during this ""newsreel"" is just great.

There were comments about the inappropriateness of  ""church pews"" and ""making fun of Catholic priests"". The ""church pews"" aren't. What you see are reproductions of the red benches in the House of Lords in the Houses of Parliament. The ""Catholic priest"" shown, isn't. What is shown is an Anglican bishop. Anglican bishops are formally addressed as my Lord Bishop and were voting members of the House of Lords. Lastly, there was a negative comment made about the apparent disorganization of members entering the House and how such a thing would never happen in real life. First of all, lots of luck in finding legislative governing bodies always bing orderly, but in addition to that, this case I have to ask - how often are sheep and dancing fairies lead into the House of lords and how often are persons (members) introduced to governing bodies as being half human and half fairy (from the waist up)?

Lastly, yes, it is true that the overture was split to act as though it was the theme song (beginning and entering) of a television show, but all the other pieces were performed as written.

I enjoyed every thing about this performance. If you find that you cannot stand the video, just close your eyes and appreciate it as a great audio recording.",1382659200,,1947,4.731563421828908
7799299,4,1578900026,"Did not realize it was part of the Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Series. Could have done without the special effects, but the voices and the orchestration were well worth it. One question tough: why shorten the overture?",1379289600,,212,4.916666666666667
7799300,5,1578900026,"The Walker Gilbert and Sullivan series (as has already been pointed out) is at best a mixed bag.  The productions range from terrible (RUDDIGORE) to the sublime (PRINCESS IDA)  This production of Iolanthe is well sung, well produced and includes special effects that enhance rather than distract.  It is musically complete (except for the overture) and is as likely as good a production of this confection as we are ever likely to get. What a shame the old D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, which was originally engaged, didn't participate in the series.  This video is over thirty years old but is still excellent!",1361577600,,609,4.9411764705882355
7799301,2,1578900026,"I love Iolanthe but found this BBC/PBS production to be unwatchable. The sets are cheesy, the camera tricks annoying, the newsreel completely out of place and much too long. Stage direction tried to make much of too little, especially with the absurd March of Peers stretched out by having the peers going in circles with a long overhead camera shot. Worse, the peers themselves are all portrayed as uncoordinated buffoons. The House of Lords may be full of dimwits, but they are aristocrats and English aristocrats are trained from birth in posture, manners, and speech. They might be stupid, but they know how to maintain a proper bearing and sense of dignity. The contrast between their very proper formality and their outlandish behavior is what makes Gilbert's satire funny. This film fails entirely to capture the humor. I found myself longing for a well-staged and directed live performance before an audience instead of this cheap studio production which doesn't come close to the musical level of the London Symphony and Ambrosian Opera Chorus dubbed in for ballerinas and actors.",1322092800,,1089,5.089385474860335
7799302,5,1578900026,"NO! NO! This is a beautiful production.  Fairy Queen above hasten to my aid!  The low review for this is based on it as an English TV production that is not on the stage..... Listen.  This is beautifully sung.  The High Lord Chanceller does know how to dive into a cockney accent for his fever dreams inspired by Love.  Can you blame him?!  There was a news reel shown when Strephon worked for a seat in parliment.  Awful, wonderful, delightful? There is a foregroud artificial fire lighting up all the fairy aunts and a green field and a sheep caressed - good or bad or a dream - I do not know for you.  Ladies laughing, legs waving from legal benches - horrible or wonderful - I think wonderful.  I believe you will not find such delight and such beauty and such bliss in any live production today.  Yes, nice to pay people for live productions and DO SO. But this is a delight for me and when people put it down with prejudice, I think - COBWEBS of mind. HIDE!  Let us celibrate and laugh. And by the way, do you remember 'Beverly Mills' at all?  I do as a man and she just shines as Iolanthe.  But so do Derek Hammond Stroud and Kate Flowers and and and.  No.... The whole series is a heaven on earth.  Bless you good folk who recorded this.",1317772800,,1245,4.216101694915254
7799303,2,1578900026,"Ever so sadly, I have to say that Iolanthe, one of the most beautiful and potentially funny of all the Gilbert and Sullivan operettas was a huge disappointment for me.  In community theater I have personally performed Iolanthe three times always one of the leading 3 fairies (in my younger days) always pining to either be Iolanthe or the Fairy Queen, and always relishing each performance in the chorus roles.  My father was Sargent Willis and the Chancellor and my brothers and I were on the receiving end of ""The nightmare song"" throughout our growing years.  On the positive side of this performance, all the voices were excellent, and the performance of the Chancellor and Phyllis more than acceptable.  The negatives--the staging was horrible, especially the first act finale, the out of space themes trite, the flying away at the end awful.  I agree with a previous reviewer about the fairy hands always flopping this way and that, and it was devastating to see the March of the Peers staged in such a helter skelter way.  Iolanthe was lovely, but looked suicidal throughout the operetta.  Surely she could have managed joy once or twice.
If there is no other choice in DVD or Blu Ray for Iolanthe, I guess this is it, but surely someone will come up with one.

7799304,2,1578900026,"I found this performance lacking in many things but above all energy. This production clearly had severe budgetary constraints, but part of the magic of theater is the extent to which an imaginative director and an energized cast can overcome limits of production.

7799305,3,1578900026,"This is one of the better and more popular of Gilbert and Sullivan operas here in the States.  As a Grad student at the University of Chicago, my eldest son was one of the major players and had a fine voice on his solo.  His girlfriend, now wife, was one of the fairies and had back stage duties.  She now has obtained her PhD in Theatre from LSU.  I was recovering from a stroke when I was gifted with a free plane ticket to and from Chicago from Nashville to enjoy this classical production as performed on the campus Green.  Hearing the PBS version brought back fond memories of that weekend and the nice taxi driver who did the impossible, got me to the stage on time.
