8438351,1,B004QO98AO,"I was really looking forwards to getting to watch some new episodes, so i pre-ordered the set but to my horror these are all episodes from previous cheaters Dvd's that have been released. Not very impressed why not advertise as a re-release i feel a little ripped off.",1311120000,7,268,4.604166666666667
8438352,1,B004QO98AO,"Whoever made this DVD set knew exactly what they were doing. Every single one of these episodes are already on the original Volumes 1 and 2. It seems like the producers of this show have gotten lazy, and instead of going through the trouble of finding newer episodes from their database, they're simply re-releasing the original Volumes 1 and 2 in the form of a 4-Volume set. By releasing Volumes 3 and 4 of this new set first, they'll surely dupe a few people who already have the original Volumes 1 and 2 into thinking that these newly released volumes will have new episodes. Well, consider me duped. This is really a slap in the face to all dedicated Cheaters fans.

I should have known something fishy was going on when Volume 4 came in the mail and Volume 3 hasn't even been sent out yet. I'm cancelling my order of Volume 3, and I'm going to try to get my money back for Volume 4.",1309910400,11,887,4.343373493975903
8438353,1,B004QO98AO,What a rip off! Why would anybody want to buy what they already have. The episodes that are on these dvd's I already have. Not only that the box says 3 disks and in fact there are only two. Really disappointed!!! Just to think I bought it two months ago for this. WOW!!!!,1309910400,,271,4.132075471698113
8438354,1,B004QO98AO,"I was totally excited about finally getting some new episodes of Cheaters on DVD. Over the past few years, there's been some hilarious new seasons of material and I was assuming that they would be featured on the 2 new box sets....I was wrong.

The first 2 boxsets (Vol. 1 & 2) have been discontinued and what they're doing is re-releasing the discontinued material as new volumes which is totally misleading. Not only that, but they released this volume (vol. 4) before volume 3...that's some confusing marketing. The episodes featured on Volume 4 are from Volume 2: Too Hot For Broadcast.

I noticed that they released a new Volume 1 with 2 discs, Volume 3 [being released July 23rd] has 4 discs and Volume 4 (this one) has 2 discs....8 discs which make up the previously released Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 boxsets. If you have rare Best of Season 1, Vol. 1 boxset, Vol. 2 boxset and the single released Vol. 5, 6 & 7, you have all the released episodes of Cheaters.

What a disappointment.",1309824000,16,984,4.548022598870056
