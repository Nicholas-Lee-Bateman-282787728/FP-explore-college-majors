8764924,2,B01HC085T8,"Dr. Billy Jennings (George Stumpf) has two wives, gambling debts, and a rope with a noose. He uses the rope. It seems his gambling debts don't go away and the wives (joined forces) are being leaned on for the money...call the police? Of course not because they are no match for a bookie and his muscle man.

The film claims to be based on a true story. It is made for TV and Asylum. The drama and acting was so fake I had to laugh at the car scene. Might want to try a different Lifetime movie. Kimberley Hews back steps about every other scene for drama effect.
