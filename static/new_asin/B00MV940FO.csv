6602567,4,B00MV940FO,"""Thick"" is your basic gangster movie but with a twist - both the Crime Boss and the head Enforcer are lesbians, the latter engaged in an affair with the formers wife. However these sexual proclivities turn out to be almost incidental to the film - were the script to be exactly the same but delivered by men in those two roles, the movie would not have even skipped a beat. Still, the lesbian angle does add some interest and flavor to the story.

There are no wasted lines in the film. Every word of every sentence is used to relentlessly drive the plot forward (the complete antithesis of a Quentin Tarantino film for example, where small talk about innocuous subjects is a key element). But the dialogue here is basic, almost rudimentary - this is really my main criticism of the film and the reason for only 4 stars instead of 5. And yet the simple, but well conceived story line and fierce character portrayals more than make up for this flaw.",1471651200,,948,4.511627906976744

6602569,4,B00MV940FO,"To quote a Smiths song, ""Love, Peace & Harmony?...well maybe in the next World."" That pretty much sums up my feelings at the end of this feature. It's a slick, fast moving, engaging story which was well-acted and well-written.  Tia Dae, the lead actor playing the role of ""Teresa"", gives a performance that immediately grabs you by the balls and doesn't let go. She really fills the screen with her icy-cold demeanour.

Having said that, I felt that the film only really scratched the surface of her character, titterlating me - I really wanted to see more of her backstory.

As far as other performances go, a good strong ensemble carried the film well.  Some nicely shot scenes, including a particularly memorable fight scene.  MI6 is missing a trick here.  if they ever need a replacement for Eve MoneyPenny, then there is a woman here that can do the job.

For me, it could have been paced a little slower. Just felt a bit rushed at times. It would have benefited from adding a few more scenes to flesh out some of the characters. A few little tweaks here and there with some of the camera angles but overall an excellent feature.

I'll certainly be keeping my eyes and ears open for other possible instalments in the world of Teresa.  Really think that there is certainly scope for more of her World and allow her to develop further.

Overall then, a good, solid production.

Just one niggle for me. There were no subtitles supplied.  If my younger brother wanted to watch it - he couldn't.  If you want to reach as many people as possible to access your feature - you must cater for them.  Little things can make a big difference to people :)",1413072000,2,1648,4.5423728813559325
8674824,3,B00MV940FO,"Thick has a good plot that is lost in lengthy dialogue.  Given the budget, I can forgive that and came into it with no expectations. although the dialogue made me groan at times, I really feel that, if re-shot with  few tweaks to the script, this could be a great movie.",1515283200,,270,4.2745098039215685
8674825,4,B00MV940FO,"A low budget with a purpose. A script that keeps the story moving forward. Sometimes, dialogue heavy scripts are used to expose too much of the story line, but in Thick, the dialogue is used to keep the move engaging. At some points, I was excited to see what would happen next. Some nice editing.",1500076800,,297,4.418181818181818
