3017788,3,B000Y9YDKA,"I watched Stub and it wasn't bad--it wasn't a full-length movie about Australian Shepherds as I had thought.  It seemed more like the video version of the tv show, The Wonderful World of Disney that I used to watch Sunday nights as a child.  It's narrated, which dissuaded my daughter from watching.  It does have Slim Pickens in it and I liked seeing his character's comical, accident-prone antics.

That said, unless you're very nostalgic for the old Wonderful World of Disney shows or love Australian Shepherds, this may not interest you.  I suspect most people would rate it lower than I did, but I liked seeing working Aussies.  They have a beauty, grace, and intelligence that are incomparable.

Keep in mind that this is from the 1960s and much has changed in entertainment since then.  I will keep it so I can watch Aussies at work.  And when I feel a little clutsy, Slim will always outdo me and is good for a laugh or two.",1265328000,2,932,4.566265060240964

3017790,5,B000Y9YDKA,"At this writing (2009) the Australian Shepherd has only has a registry for a little over 60 years.  The dogs in this cute little Disney story were the foundation of this breed, really were Jay's dogs, it really was his rodeo act and his ranch in Idaho.  There is nothing on earth like this showing this part of this breed of dog's heritage.  We have faded photographs and yellowed writings, but nothing close to this.

3017791,5,B000Y9YDKA,"This video is a MUST HAVE for any Australian Shepherd (Aussie) lover!

The movie itself is cute and the scenery and wide open spaces are amazing!

This video showcases some of the originally registered greats of the breed and their owner, Jay Sisler.  It is a wonderful visual history of the beginnings of the Australian Shepherd.",1230595200,5,330,4.857142857142857
3017792,5,B000Y9YDKA,"This story was a product of its time, a family Disney episode with a simple story, great photography and a lesson. The episode has held up well with the passage of time. The Aussies are adorable and well trained. Fans of the breed should take note -- herding comprises one of the primary plot lines. I wished for at least some extras, but basically what you get is the episode and that's it. Given the price, that's reasonable, though one hopes for more, a ""making of,"" or ""where are they now,"" etc.

Overall, I recommend this item if you want a vintage story well done, involving a wonderful breed of dog, the Australian Shepherd.",1229299200,2,631,4.535087719298246
3017793,5,B000Y9YDKA,"THE STORY: The story of a ranching family that lives in the Californian Santa Inez Valley along with their 3 Australian Shepherd herding dogs -- Stub, Queen and Shorty.  A renegade wild 1800 pound Brahma bull threatens the ranchers  cattle herds and Stub is the best chance they have in corralling the beast.

BEHIND THE SCENES: A made for television one hour show, it first aired on December 8, 1974 as the 10th episode of the season of the ""Wonderful World of Disney"", on NBC television. The story is perfectly narrated by Rex Allen. Produced and directed by Larry Lansburgh, who also created the original story, and the actual teleplay was put together by Jan Lansburgh and Bill Anderson.  The story is actually a continuation of another Larry Landsburgh directed project for Disney, the Academy Award  nominated 22 minute Disney theatrical featurette titled ""Cow Dog"", released 18 years earlier on November 6, 1956 along with the Disney film, ""Secrets of Life"". That first story also featured a dog named Stub, and the new show is supposed to be about features Stub's descendants. Too bad this original project is not included on the DVD as an extra.  All in all entertaining and clean family fun.",1220486400,4,1201,4.862745098039215
3017794,4,B000Y9YDKA,I have been waiting for this for a long time!  I have very fond memories of growing up watching Wonderful World of Disney on Sunday evenings.  Stub: The Best Cow Dog in the West was especially memorable because part of it was filmed on my uncle's place about him and his dogs.  Uncle Jay and his wonderful dogs were inducted into the Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame in 2002 and this gave me and my children a chance to see the act in action.  I am just amazed at what he could make his animals do!  Any dog lovers in your family are sure to love this.  It is a bit dated but it was worth the wait for me and my boys.,1214784000,2,607,3.894308943089431
