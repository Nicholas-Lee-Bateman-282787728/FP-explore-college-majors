The first time I watched Stan Laurel bottling the wine I thought I might pass out, you just can't breath when you're laughing that hard. This is the movie that gives their unique and spectacular comic talents the stage they deserved.",1393027200,,389,4.6521739130434785
8215475,5,B000UXG2F4,"Let'sface it, you don't tight, concise plots in Laurel and Hardy movies.  Granting that, I found this movie to be pretty funny. The boys are gypsies. Stan is more suave a thief than Ollie. Ollie's wife cheats on him with another man, steals the daughter of her lover's enemy for revenge, and finally runs off with him taking all of both Stan and Ollie's money. It sounds kind of grim, but in their hands it comes quite amusing. The ending is a predictable reunion of the girl and her father, and some unusual aftereffects of torture.",1242000000,2,533,4.552083333333333
