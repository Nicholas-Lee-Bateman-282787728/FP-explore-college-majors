8263366,4,B0016MJ6LK,"There are so many El Cheapo public domain cartoon compilations out there, I'm always delighted when an old favorite gets some respect from a reputable company.  And Classic Media does not disappoint with this rather random but still very attractive set of 1960's Casper shorts.

Here's the list of cartoons:

ENCHANTED HORSE
GROWING UP
MOTHER GOOSE LAND
TWIN TROUBLE
WENDY'S WISH
WHICH IS WITCH
ICE SCREAM
CASPER GENIE
TRUE BOO
BOOS AND SADDLES
BOOS AND ARROWS
LITTLE LOST GHOST

I rate these very high because, for one thing, Casper was almost never shown where I lived growing up.  So it's really like watching all new cartoons for me.  I'm sure the nostalgia factor will be high for those who DID watch these on t.v. years ago.  In any event, the picture and sound quality are quite good, if not quite as polished as the major-studio releases for the Looney Tunes or Tom & Jerry collections.

If you're buying this for children, rest assured that they are VERY G-rated, and blissfully lack the irony or sardonic wit that has saturated nearly all of kids' programming since the early 1990's.  The title of this collection is ""Scare Up Some Fun,"" and that's exactly what it does offer: Slightly spooky-themed laughs with colorful and likable characters.  And for some of us, that's enough.",1293494400,5,1290,4.822727272727272
