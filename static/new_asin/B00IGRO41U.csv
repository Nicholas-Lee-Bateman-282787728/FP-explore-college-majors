6263675,5,B00IGRO41U,"Don't listen to the a-hole who gave it 2 stars....he's crazy!!!  Maybe it's not like the earlier series, but things have to change with the times.  In fact, to be honest, it will never be the same without Caroline Quentin, but it is still very clever and entertaining.  Yes, in the first episode we do know who did it....but there was so much more to the story.  I am so glad I didn't pay attention to the bad review that was given; I would have missed out on one of my favorite series as it continues to be cleverly written and very entertaining!!!  Judge for yourself don't give credence to one bad review.  I hope it continues for series to come.  British series are so much better than the US crap we are subjected to; that's why I don't watch American TV, only British series for me!!",1406678400,5,789,4.326530612244898
6263676,2,B00IGRO41U,"That line, uttered by a character in the second episode, pretty much sums up this season as a whole.

It breaks my heart to write this review, it really does. Up until now I would have described myself as the number one fan of ""Jonathan Creek"", but now it's clear that the show has well and truly run its course. What was once an ingenious (and hilarious) series of baffling mysteries that required a hefty amount lateral thinking from both its characters and the audience, now revolves around  an assortment of minor intrigues in a cozy village setting.

No longer an introverted stage-designer to an egotistical magician, Jonathan Creek has become a bland businessman, married to Polly, a woman with whom he has nothing in common and absolutely no chemistry with. There's no windmill, no magic show, no Adam Klaus and no Maddy Magellan (though she's been missing for a while now). Not even the trademark duffel coat is present.

But none of that would matter if there were at least some juicy mysteries, right? But where once episodes were structured around a solid puzzle-box plot, there are now only a scattering of paper-thin intrigues.

""The Letters of Septimus Noone"" involve the star of a West End musical being stabbed in her locked dressing room, moments after being seen in perfect health, with no sign of the perpetrator anywhere in the theatre. It sounds good, but for reasons that utterly escape me, the episode is structured so that the audience knows EXACTLY how the crime was done. Seriously, you see the whole lead-up to the event - how she was injured, who did it, and why.

There is no mystery! While watching I was concerned that perhaps my recording was playing out-of-order, or that there had been some sort of screw-up in the editing room. Heck, perhaps there was, for I simply cannot fathom why anyone would reveal the solution to the whodunit before the investigation even takes place.

Oh, and if you're wondering how the title of this episode relates to the story, the letters actually refer to a superfluous subplot in which Polly finds a series of letters written to her late mother by another man while she was married. It's not really much of a story.

In ""The Sinner and the Sandman"" a series of numbers are discovered under five layers of wallpaper, numbers that Polly recognizes as the recent winning lottery numbers. The house belongs to a wannabe psychic, and the numbers have been covered for at least fifty years. How on earth have they managed to be so accurate?

Though this mystery is marginally better than the previous one, it's still rather slight and relies on a fairly massive coincidence. The episode is therefore padded out with some rather unfunny subplots: a neighbor who thinks that Jonathan's comments on his sore wrist allude to masturbating, rumors of a strange green-eyed monster hiding in the bushes, and Polly's nightmares about a man from her childhood. None of them are connected in any way, and Polly's story in particular (which lends the title the reference to the word ""sandman"") is practically irrelevant.

""The Curse of the Bronze Lamp"" manages to be the best of the bunch, with a woman kidnapped just before her 40th birthday coinciding with the Creeks' cleaning lady believing that she's found a real genie lamp that will grant her wishes. After asking for wealth, she wakes up to find a diamond watch in her bed - soon identified as belonging to the kidnapped woman. But how on earth did it get there?

In this episode at least the two mysteries are linked, and manages to be quite compelling at times (though the time is padded out by a pointless misunderstood conversation between two elderly women).

Like I said, I hate writing a negative review for ""Jonathan Creek"". I loved this show - I *still* love this show, or at least the first three seasons (and most of the fourth). But it's pretty clear that David Renwick is out of ideas. To borrow a phrase from Bilbo Baggins, these mysteries feel like ""butter scraped over too much bread"". To take Jonathan away from his passion in life (designing magic tricks) seems almost cruel, and Alan Davies appears totally bored with the proceedings.

I'd recommend early ""Jonathan Creek"" to just about anyone - but give this a miss.",1399852800,17,4244,4.773533424283765

8642045,5,B00IGRO41U,"Well worth buying, as ""it's a keeper"", as the saying goes. I've put it into my ""once a year"" list.
  I like the way they've moved Sarah Alexander to a more involved role, as she's always been one of my favorites (who could forget her portrayal of Susan in ""Coupling""?). Her character adds a whole new, and interesting, dimension to JC.
  I'll always miss Maddie, Joey, and the rest, but the producers did right in taking the show in this new direction. We all change some as we age, and this just makes things a little more believable.
  And on a more personal note: Even though she is no teenager, in my humble opinion, Sarah is still about the hottest and most talented of ALL the British ladies, even when you include the greats like Helen Mirren, Louise Lombard, etc. Just my two cents worth!",1503792000,,796,4.455172413793103

8642048,3,B00IGRO41U,"I love Jonathan Creek and was super happy to see this new one but sad to say, they should have left it in the closet. Jonathan is older and wiser and MARRIED - to a shrew that does not let him explore his logical puzzle-solving side. They now live in the country, Adam is nowhere to be seen and all of a sudden he's married and working in a company! Talk about different settings. I didn't really enjoy it, to me there was no suspense, no comedic timing and crap puzzles that I could have figured out! Leave this on the shelf.",1432080000,2,526,4.166666666666667

8642050,4,B00IGRO41U,"I enjoyed this series, perhaps not as much as the earlier ones, but one needs to keep in mind that Jonathan Creek has evolved into modern times.  Sure, I miss the windmill and Adam, but to keep a character like Jonathan in the same setting as he was in the 90's wouldn't make sense.  I think he does quiet well in his new setting.  I do like Polly, I think she's a good stabilizing character.  These are not meant to be deep dramas.  Those who state the writing and the plots are contrived are missing the point.  Jonathan Creek is meant to be light entertainment, and that's exactly what it delivers. I enjoyed seeing the character mature but yet keep that adorable persona he had in the earlier series.  I am a huge fan of Alan Davies and have enjoyed everything I've seen him in so maybe I'm a little biased.  The settings and plots have changed, but Alan Davies does a great job of going with the changes while keeping Jonathan the character we all love him for.",1428364800,2,966,4.35754189944134
8642051,5,B00IGRO41U,"It has been fun watching ""Jonathan Creek"" grow up during this series, since it spans somewhere around 20 years.  Like others have said, there's no windmill, he's settled down and married (however, his wife is good spirited and provides a bit of the comedy), and the magician character is gone.  However, it stays true to the spirit of Jonathan Creek, of which I am a fan.  Perhaps they will make a few more in the next 10 years? Please, please, please?

By the way, you can play the Region 2 DVDs in US on your computer with the VLC player (free download).  No need to change your DVD settings.",1426636800,6,594,4.412844036697248
8642052,5,B00IGRO41U,"True, it's different from the earlier years of the series. It's not as funny and gimmicky, and Caroline Quentin will always be missed. But Alan Davies is an intelligent, charismatic actor and Jonathan Creek is still a terrific character. The plots are interesting and the episodes well-written. The price was a bit high for just three episodes, but I don't regret buying the DVD.",1412467200,4,379,4.9375
