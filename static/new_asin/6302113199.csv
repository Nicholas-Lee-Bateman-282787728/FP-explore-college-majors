7821539,5,6302113199,"As an avid and knowledgable Marilyn collector(ahem), I rate this the best and certainly most intelligent of any documentaries on M.M. Handles her memory with total respect, with interviews of people who loved her, such as Shelly Winters, Susan Strasberg...also some fascinating comments from Joshua Logan. A totally pleasing video for Marilyn fans, a very interesting and entertaining experience even for those not ""ga-ga"" over our girl! (What's wrong with them!!???)",982022400,,467,5.591549295774648
