7883557,2,6305131007,I've seen this movie on VHS... and got it finally on dvd.... I was disappointed because it leaves out some scenes ... the picture looked kinda fuzzy .... funny how some movies on vhs that had all the shall we say risque scenes... but when it comes to putting them on dvd they for some inexplicable reason decide to not put those scenes on it ...,1371513600,,345,4.242424242424242
7883558,4,6305131007,"A very strange, almost stock version of a David Lynchesque miscast. That said, I liked it anyhow.
Heather Graham plays a young widow who has witnessed her husband's murder and the murderer himself commit suicide(I think they were more than buddies wink wink.) There is no determined timeframe thereafter, but she is in a daze and living in an apartment alone and randomly and promiscuously engaging in sex with random guys, oh and one girl too. Well, the sex always revolves around her getting orally surfeited but that's of no matter is it? It's Heather Graham being sexed up! Anyhow somebody begins to stalk her and and and the police won't help and and and she keeps getting beaten and and and followed around by a big white car etc. Finally the mysterious stalker is exposed!
I'm giving it 4 1/2 stars on H. Graham alone being so lovely and just acting like a complete lulu. Her hair is wild, her demeanor is aloof to the things which don't interest her(which is everything) and she crouches over some guy lying on the floor, sans panties and rubs herself into his face. Even when she is at work typing, her shoulders bobbing and the doe-eyes are ghostly round, she is entrancing. I hope H. G. isn't a real-life Hollywood trollop because she sure made me buy into the movie on her presence alone. I even liked her in Say It Isn't So, a romantic comedy, which would make me gag normally. So what I am saying is that I am whoring out any objectivity principally on her aesthetics. But honestly, the movie wasn't bad either.",1084147200,7,1525,4.569343065693431
7883559,4,6305131007,"The movie was at the same time extremely scary but hysterically funny. The neurotic sensibility in Graham's performance is similar to Mia farrow in Rosemary's baby. It left a really deep impression on me since the whole film was so roughly presented and sharply scary. The film is so sharp and rough it even transcends into something really justifiable. Looking back on it I really loved it and how it could scare me like no other film (not anne rice, not from dusk till dawn, not even the baby of Rosemary.)",1068422400,3,508,4.593406593406593
7883560,1,6305131007,I like the way it gives you a twist when you actually think that there is someone real that is stalking her but a lot of scenes were cut out and that is what makes the movie a burial into the moritorium of movies. Other than that if I could just get my hands on an original uncut version that woud be fine too. Thank's..,1050710400,3,320,3.9384615384615387
7883561,5,6305131007,What a surprise. Heather Graham has a good performance. Heather lives in a world of fear and hallucinatory madness. The ending is very shocking. A fun and suspensful puzzle that is very entertaining.,985996800,8,199,5.0606060606060606
7883562,1,6305131007,"OK this movie is SO not-worthy of the hotty-hot-hot Hather Graham. Not only was it pointleass and rather dull, but it seemed to lack in ANY plot whatsoever. Stay away from it like the ebola virus...",961113600,3,198,4.527777777777778
