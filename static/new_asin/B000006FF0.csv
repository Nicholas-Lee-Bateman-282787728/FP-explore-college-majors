The first episode on each tape is complete, the other two are missing the beginning title sequence. All episodes end after the ""Markowitz/Chesler Producing"" logo (the ""This Has Been An HBO Presentation"" screen is omitted). The tape was duplicated in the SP speed. An interesting bit of trivia: the tapes in this series originally sold for a suggested retail price of $39.95 (according to the commercial on the Vol. 4 tape).",1092528000,3,2233,5.308781869688385
