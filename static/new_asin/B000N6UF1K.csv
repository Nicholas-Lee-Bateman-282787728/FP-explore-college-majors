2757461,5,B000N6UF1K,"""In e womb"" is precise and interesting. it doesn't bore you like other documentaries do.  i enjoyed it very much and it has given me insights to what happens to my body every step of the way throughout my pregnancy.

would definitely recommend buying it, if you're planning on starting your family anytime soon*",1193011200,,311,4.7407407407407405
2757462,5,B000N6UF1K,"this documentary gives in-depth perspective of the development of multiples in the womb - and it's done with amazing material. Real life echoes, shown in multiple dimensions, and fascinating views of the inside world of the womb. You can almost imagine what it's like in there. Although many knowledgable facts are told, it's all brought in a very comprehensive way.",1186444800,6,366,5.116666666666666
2757463,5,B000N6UF1K,"Well-done, magnificent example of sensibility combined with technical virtuosism.",1181952000,2,81,8.11111111111111
2757464,5,B000N6UF1K,"This documentary follows the multiple pregnancies of three different women, from conception to shortly after the birth.  Rachel (the only one who isn't a first-time mother) is having fraternal twins (a boy and a girl), Jennifer is having triplets (two identical boys plus one fraternal brother who was conceived on a different day), and Julie is having identical quads (girls).  All three of these sets of multiples were conceived naturally, even Julie's (the odds of having naturally-conceived identical quads are one in eight million!).  Using cutting-edge 4-D technology, we're able to get a fascinating look at just what goes on in the womb during these gestational periods.  Not only do we get to see what the embryos/fetuses look like as they develop, but we also get to see the kinds of interactions they have with one another, interactions that vary from up-close and personal (if they're together in the same amnion and chorion, no barriers between them) to only able to feel one another through membranes if they're in separate amnions and chorions.

This documentary is loaded with just about everything you ever might have wanted to know about multiple pregnancies.  Topics include the different types of twinning, what might cause conjoined twins, how interactions in utero continue playing out after birth (such as one set of twins in which the dominant twin often kicked his brother, who put his head down on the placenta for comfort instead of fighting back; as they grew up, the submissive twin would go to his room and put his head on the blanket when bullied by the dominant one), why older women are more prone to naturally-conceived multiples (one theory is that the eggs a woman is left with by then are weakened by age and therefore more likely to split), why many twins are mirror images of one another, and how a woman's height affects how close to term she can bring a multiple pregnancy.  I knew that sometimes triplets can be carried almost to full term and delivered naturally, but didn't know that the odds are greater for such a thing if the mother is taller.  Jennifer, the triplets' mother, was almost six feet tall, though she ended up having to have a C-section that wasn't as close to full term as had been hoped.

In addition to shining a light on the amazing process of development a fetus goes through, it also lets one into the mysterious world of what it's like to actually be in there, and to be on the same amazing journey with one, two, or even three other companions.  One can't help but wonder how much these newborn multiples remember of their time in the womb, when they formed a bond like no other with their womb-mates.",1179014400,52,2669,4.7700650759219085
2757465,5,B000N6UF1K,I had to watch this movie for a human development course in college. It is the most amazing thing to see actual footage of multiples growing in the womb.  I also learned a lot about multiples that I did not previously know.  Very good watch! Definitely reccomended.,1175731200,8,265,4.617021276595745
2757605,5,B000N6UF1K,"One of my best friends found out she was having twins, so I sent her this video.
She was absolutely thrilled by everything she saw and learned in this documentary.

If you know anyone about to be having twins or triplets, this makes a very thoughtful gift, as they will learn what is happening inside their own body.",1393286400,2,316,4.448275862068965
2757606,4,B000N6UF1K,"This movie has so much to touch on and does a decent job explaining a lot about multiples. I was not thrilled with the birthing part, I didn't expect that, it actually made me kind of emotional but hey, I need to know what's up, right?",1392508800,,235,4.130434782608695
2757607,5,B000N6UF1K,This is my third pregancy. When I found out I was having twins this time I was fascinated with how this was all gonna work. I learned so much and found it really answered so many of my questions.,1385164800,,195,4.0256410256410255
2757608,5,B000N6UF1K,"I am  an identical twin and this video helped explain a great number of mysteries about our current relationship at ages 57. Now I realize that this competitive and even hostile relationship of ours that has evolved, actually started in the womb! I weighed an ounce more at birth and was the more passive/docile twin. Not sure how this helps heal our relationship now, but at least I have more insight. Thanks.",1384905600,,410,4.694444444444445
2757609,5,B000N6UF1K,It is cool to see multiples in the womb and see what my twins went through and their bond. It is very true they have such a strong bond even after they are born they hate being separated even for over ten minutes.,1370649600,,213,3.9767441860465116
2757610,5,B000N6UF1K,Our daughter is pregnant with twins after a long struggle with infertilty.  It is very informative and exciting to watch !,1370390400,,122,4.809523809523809
2757611,5,B000N6UF1K,I looks like they took a camera and put it the womb for nine months.  I can't say enough about this video.,1362182400,,106,3.8181818181818183
2757612,5,B000N6UF1K,"My Identical Twin and I loved watching this film. We were born in 91 at 26 1/2 weeks gestation and growing up in the 90s and 2000s we didn't know much of a multiples life at birth. Now I can clearly see it in opur relationship when we grew up: Jenae was the dominant one whens she grew older, I was submissive although as babies and younf children the role was entirely reversed :) It was a amazing thing to watch imagining what our lives mustve been like in the womb as twins.",1361491200,,477,4.139784946236559

2757614,5,B000N6UF1K,If you want to know and understand better how multiples are conceived watch this video. You'll be surprised how much you don't know. This movie was informative and the graphics are amazing!,1329436800,,189,4.9375
2757677,5,B000N6UF1K,I bought this for my sister who is pregnant with twins. It was really neat to see multiples in the womb. Very educational.,1325980800,,122,4.3478260869565215

2757680,5,B000N6UF1K,Our friend gave this to us when we were expecting our first child...it was incredible to watch and helped my husband feel a bit more connected before the baby started kicking.  We have given it to others who are expecting with great feedback.  The multiples version is even more amazing and a unique gift!  Look forward to showing our girls someday when they can appreciate the images of a true miracle captured on film.,1309478400,2,420,4.648648648648648
2757681,4,B000N6UF1K,"I enjoyed this video very much. The Creation of a new life truly is a miracle! I loved the footage inside the womb. I am fascinated with the whole process of multiple births;truly awesome. My only complaint is that in one place they comment how the embryo has gills and a tail and this is due to our evolutionary past! What bunk! The complexity of DNA is sophisticated information in code. We know that when there is information, there is a mind. Where there is information there is a designer. Let's go where the evidence leads us...the miracle of life requires a Creator.",1289433600,3,573,4.572815533980583
2757682,4,B000N6UF1K,"I am pregnant with multiples and wanted an inside out look of what my babies and body are experiencing.  Great teaching video on the basics of multiple births.  Would be appropriate for helping answer questions that older siblings have (age 13 and up, as conception by male/female intercourse is briefly discussed).",1272844800,5,315,5.1568627450980395
2757683,5,B000N6UF1K,My husband and I watched this together and where extremely surprised as to how detailed this video was. Great insight into the world of multiples in a womb. Definitely would recommend to any couple expecting multiples.,1245024000,,218,5.083333333333333
2757684,5,B000N6UF1K,"This video is amaizing! There is so much information and is so detailed. I had seen the video ""In the Womb"" when I was pregnant and loved it. I would have my husband watch it with me durring each trimester that I was in to show him what changes our baby and myself were going through. It gave him a chance to understand what was happening inside me on a whole differant level and it allowed him to have a better connection with our baby. As you know, men do not get to experience what we feel when we are pregnant and this gives them some insight and a chance to start bonding with your own baby. I can't say enough good things about it. So I figured, we had such a wonderful experience with that video that we mine as well get the ""In the Womb - Multiples"" and it was just as wonderful.",1243382400,2,787,4.083870967741936
2757685,5,B000N6UF1K,"I watched this video 3 times in a row as I am expecting twins this September.  I was in aww!  Love it.  I've learned so much.  Even our 5 year old requests to watch it.  My dear husband has yet to see it but when he does, I know he will be as impressed as I.  Thank you!",1237593600,6,270,3.5689655172413794
2757686,5,B000N6UF1K,It's an interesting video although it appears that the same images continue to be shown throughout the video. However it contains good info.,1235952000,,140,5.130434782608695

8175214,4,B000N6UF1K,"Quite good, but a few things about it bothered me.

""Scientists"" say this.  ""Scientists"" think that.  Never does the narrator say what *kind* of scientists, or cite anything specific.  It comes across like he is trying to sound authoritative without actually doing the research.

It also kind of seems to be trying to be kind of overblown.  The music gets dramatic when he's talking about aggressive behavior in the womb, and he talks about shared amniotic sacks like this is very common (when, in fact, it only occurs in about 1% of cases of identical twins).  Essentially, a lot of things feel like they were exaggerated a little for effect.

I feel like the film is trying to be dramatic over informative, and with a nonfiction subject which inherently very interesting, false drama gets in the way.  It's not too bad, but it's there.

There are also some details which are slightly inaccurate.  (Mirror image twins do not always happen at precisely nine days -- if they were, they would all be mono-mono, and there seem to be plenty of mirror image twins that weren't.  Identical twins of different genders can happen in two different ways, not just one -- the XXY turning into XX and XY he mentioned, but also XY turning into X in one twin.)

I feel like it could have been better researched and more carefully written.

Another minor nitpick is that when he's relating anecdotal stories (the head on the pillow, the twins in the curtains), I really, really would have liked to have seen video footage of these, not just heard about them.  Again, it's a case of not having the sources cited.  But it's also a case of really wanting to see it, not just hear about it!  I do understand if it could not be possible to capture it, but man, it felt so incomplete to hear the story and not see any of it.

Now, all that said, I still gave it four stars because it's interesting, and the visuals of the babies in the womb are AMAZING.  Seeing a baby stroke the amniotic sack, or touch a sibling's face, was so ""Wow.""  The births were also incredible.

Basically, informatively-speaking, I thought it was a bit weak.  Could have been stronger, anyway.  However, the videos of multiples in the womb are really, really cool, and the births brought tears to my eyes.",1441324800,,2260,4.581047381546135

8175216,5,B000N6UF1K,"Love this video, especially while I was on bed rest during my pregnancy. Although I didn't have multiples, I still enjoyed the miracles taking place in the human body and wondered about my own little miracle. gave me something to look forward to!",1419638400,,246,4.744186046511628
8175217,5,B000N6UF1K,Very Interesting and Informative.,1410048000,,33,7.5
8175218,5,B000N6UF1K,Great movie and images. Just be warned wouldn't recommend watching in 1st trimester if you have twins. They are pretty negative when it comes to the facts of miscarriages with twins. It was a little upsetting watching then but now I know I'm in the clear!,1409702400,,255,4.565217391304348
8175219,4,B000N6UF1K,This was a great video showing the growth of multiple children in the womb.  It certainly shows that they were alive at birth.  It was very convincing that abortion certainly kills a child.,1397088000,,189,4.696969696969697
