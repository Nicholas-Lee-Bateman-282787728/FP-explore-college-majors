4063285,5,B000EOTU2Q,"This anime is an entertaining fantasy with some pretty ""hot"" aliens, a bath house, and some cat girls.  It involves romance.  Encourages hard work and self sacrifice.  It has a pretty cool ending.
The one downside is the ""mystery"" doesn't really start to get revealed until the last few episodes.  It begins with more of simple one shot episodes and you may not think that there is an overall storyline.  This doesn't really get revealed until about the last five episodes...but an awesome climax.",1379116800,4,497,4.869047619047619
4063286,4,B000EOTU2Q,I really enjoyed the first season. Second season was not as good though. I felt that the artwork/animation was very good.,1376179200,2,121,4.809523809523809
4063287,3,B000EOTU2Q,This meets the criteria I find as normal for all Prime Amazon anime offerings.  For what it's worth.  As expected.,1374883200,,114,4.65

4063291,5,B000EOTU2Q,"So as I thought this is the 4 disc collection even though in the product description it says that its only a one disc set.

4063292,4,B000EOTU2Q,"If you haven't seen the 1st season of this anime, i recommend you buy the 1st and 2nd season apart, I was unsure about buying, but after seeing the 1st season, it was worth it for sureat the price i got it at.",1306108800,3,209,3.883720930232558
4063293,5,B000EOTU2Q,This is one of those anime shows that can be most likened to a romantic comedy as far as normal movie types go. It has a lot of great parts throughout the series and if you like any one of the volumes of it i suggest getting them all they are all equally entertaining.,1214956800,2,268,3.9814814814814814
4063294,5,B000EOTU2Q,"This installment of ufo ultramaiden valkyrie is pretty funny in the sense that rika explains her encounters since valkyrie landed into the earth ,and the funny part of that episode is when the child version of valkyrie(or better known as val-q)sees a cat ,and get's an empty crate of apples ,and jumps on the box ,and kisses kazuto to be grown up valkyrie ,and saves the cat .well in the second episode ms.sanada get's an 8mm camera from the space shopping network ,and starts filming val-q in her unparalleled cuteness ,and stifles the life out of kazuto ,and also messes up the spacecraft of hydra ,and starts to fire up the whole town in hagoromo city ,but the town was saved by both val,and hydra ,but ms.sanada instead blames hydra for the whole incident of the ship (that's pretty damn typical just like american left wing media),well at any  rate the third episode consists of the enterance of perhaps one of my favorite characters laine ,the mischevous shapeshifting vixen whom is trying to take back her big sister back home but can't drive ,and can't see for her life ,and she turns into akina,hydra,rika,and my homie spot (word up dawg!),and somehow falls in love with the naive bathhouse owner kazuto (you lucky bastard).the fourth episode consists of the catgirls going to the beach,and having fun .personally it was funny ,and would be recommended for ages 10+why not ma because it's just some anime with some flashing ,kinda like ranma1/2",1155600000,5,1453,4.835341365461847

4063320,4,B000EOTU2Q,Season 2 gives us a flashback of the beginning season to build a little more on the character views and attributes.  Graphics and attention to detail for the animation help bring out things not seen in season one. Had some problems getting the video player to work and I hope more Amazon titles pan out from the TV mode into a widescreen view so series like UFO Ultramaiden bloom out and make these anime sagas more of a viewing pleasure.,1398643200,2,438,4.475

8387847,5,B000EOTU2Q,"A friend suggested I watch this and I love it. It involves a high school boy who is trying frantically to keep a bathhouse that his grandfather started in a city where aliens are commonplace. A giant UFO crashes into his bathhouse and seriously injures him. The occupant is a princess from a planet called Valhalla named Valkyrie.  She sees what happens to him and kisses him and transfers half of her soul to him to save him. He recovers but as a result, she is turned into a very rambunctious little girl and mayhem ensues as he and his younger sister try to care for her.  Since the two of them are attached by the soul exchange, she needs to be around him all the time and insists she is in love with him. Later, her not too pleasant sister comes looking for her and promptly crashes into a temple and begins causing chaos trying to locate her. Then it is discovered that when Valkyrie kisses the boy, she returns to her original form briefly and defeats who or whatever comes their way. Also included is a Cat woman maid that fawns all over Valkyrie and a small army of catgirls,  a rabbit-like creature named Spot that Valkyrie vigourously plays with but who is one of the most powerful warriors in the galaxy

 It's sort of like a cross between Sailor Moon and a lot of the 80's brat pack movies.

 There is also nudity but nothing beyond the daily running of the bathhouse and it only is here and there and last for a couple of seconds. It's also hilarious.

  It's good to see some entertaining anime' that is not endless violence, giant robots or the ones that are played to death on American television

 I REALLY hope Amazon gets seasons 3 and 4",1474588800,5,1657,4.379084967320262
