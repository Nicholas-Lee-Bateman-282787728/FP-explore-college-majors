8364449,5,B002CVLAIQ,This is a fabulous kids yoga DVD. The stories are fun and the poses are easy for little yogis. My 5 year old loves it and the illustrations are adorable. A great before bed routine for your little ones. It is easy to follow and I love that it only shows the kids doing the yoga poses. Makes my daughter feel at ease knowing Tree Pose doesn't have to be perfect. Love this DVD so much!,1373846400,,384,4.065789473684211

8364452,5,B002CVLAIQ,Miss Danay definitely has a talent when it comes to connecting with children and easily grabbing their interest in all aspects of yoga.  Her ability to seamlessly integrate the concepts with the poses is brilliant and makes yoga easy for the kids to understand and apply to their lives!  I have witnessed the positive impact of the DVD and her classes and seen the changes in her students.  I highly recommend this DVD as well as the Yoga Buddies program for any school in the LA Area!,1295913600,2,485,4.551724137931035

8364455,5,B002CVLAIQ,"I searched high and low to find the very best kids yoga instructor in all of Los Angeles and found Danay DiVirgilio.  Then I purchased her Yogabuddies DVD for my niece and nephew who live out-of-state.  The kids, who are five and six, practice yoga every night now.  They love the poses and are learning to stay calm, focused, and balanced.  Sometimes the whole family practices together.  Thank you, Ms. Danay for this fabulous creation.  I will be purchasing many more for children of friends and relatives.  I would recommend Yogabuddies to anyone who wants to share yoga with children because it is the very best program I have found.",1294963200,2,638,4.745454545454545
