778847,2,6304053290,I was disappointed in this DVD. It was pretty boring and didn't give any of the spiritual symbolism of the gates of Jerusalem which is what I was looking for.,1265846400,10,158,4.3
778848,4,6304053290,"I had the video in VHS and felt it valuable enough to purchase in DVD format.  Appreciated the dual format.  Used first half for class and fast forwarded to specific pre-selected areas due to time constraint.  The volume of information presented in a viewable format made it difficult to skip some areas and not lose content.  Yet to show it all would not of been the best use of time as there are filler areas or areas that move a little slow.  I made it available for the class to check out and it is on its rounds because what they saw and the format with which it was presented intrigued them to view the rest of the video.  This video was also a pre-trip source of material for an educational trip to Israel.  Having been to Israel the pictures of culture are a little dated.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jerusalem-Sacred-and-Profane/dp/B00079RC0U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jerusalem: Sacred and Profane</a>&nbsp;In comparison the Sacred and Profane video moved extremely slow.

778849,4,6304053290,This DVD was very educational and explained the three world religions who hold ground in Jerusalem.  This is a very good tool for Bible study and a good visual teaching aid.  I enjoyed it very much.,1225152000,18,198,4.472222222222222
778850,4,6304053290,"We received the DVD very quickly but the DVD did have a small nick or scratch that makes a scene jump slightly.  The jump is not enough to be of any concern though, as
it skips over only one word.  The history of each gate is very interesting and clearly
explained.",1221436800,,265,4.176470588235294

779369,2,6304053290,Really old...poor resolution and picture quality. Historical information is good but not good if you're looking for what the place looks and feels like now. Old footage repeated is not great as well.  Very disappointing.,1429142400,,220,5.285714285714286

779429,4,6304053290,"It was an enjoyable film but gets a little boring at times. It is very informative but to ""bleh"" in the narrating.

779430,4,6304053290,"The film is a well produced overview of Jerusalem. The program does a good job in presenting the various aspects of modern Jerusalem (Jewish, Arab, Christian). The production does not dwell on the many problems and frictions facing this ancient city but that does not appear to be point the producers were trying to stress. All in all, this is a very enjoyable study of a old and interesting city.",1417910400,,397,4.685714285714286
779431,5,6304053290,"I ordered this on a hunch and found myself completely captivated by the story it tells. This is the history of the Holy City going back to the very beginning and bringing the story of that troubled city up to fairly recent times. There was a great deal of interesting information about Jerusalem during the period of Roman and Muslim domination with some, but not too much political correctness.

I can highly recommend this documentary movie for anyone who has an interest in the Jerusalem of the past or present. Jerusalem has a brilliant future which will be preceeded by great troubles but none of that was included. One can safely say, regarding Jerusalem, that the best is yet to come.",1417219200,2,691,4.710743801652892

I very highly recommend this video. I cannot imagine you being disappointed.,1416441600,2,266,4.5625
779435,3,6304053290,It is ok.  I have been to Jerusalem so maybe that is why I was not as impressed. Jerusalem is an incredible place. Everyone should go there at least once.,1415318400,,154,4.133333333333334

779523,5,6304053290,"I have a passion for Israel and a special interest in learning about Jerusalem. The specific gates are of particular interest. This film presented the historical significance of each gate along with how it fits with modern day Jerusalem. So many films I have seen about Jerusalem tend to lean against the Jews and to speak more favorably about the muslims. However, this film, in my opinion, presents the information in an unbiased manner, presenting all sides equally and fairly. I rarely finish those that attempt to rewrite history. I am very happy to have not only finished, but purchased this film for future viewing and sharing with others.",1403395200,7,646,4.935779816513762

779527,5,6304053290,"An excellent documentary!  When one visits, he or she enters and exits the gates often.  However, it has taken mer two trips to partially understand the significance of each gate.  Mr. Kiley does an outstanding job of convincing the viewer of that significance.  A statement at the end of this video sums up precisely my thoughts: ""The gates of the city must first be entered through the heart.""  Only before my second visit did that occur for me personally.  That allowed me to make that trip a true adventure to the places Jesus walked!",1398643200,,538,4.670212765957447

The reenactments extra cheesy, they can confuse people rather than present a real confrontation with the harsh conditions people endured under the Old Kingdoms.
