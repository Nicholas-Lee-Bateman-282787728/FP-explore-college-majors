7905240,4,B000007QY2,"Those who remember Mr. Denver recall his oft-mentioned love of the natural world; it was a part of many of the songs he wrote and almost all of those that became hits.  However, the performer learned early in his career that his message enjoyed its widest reception when delivered through the cute, squeaky-clean, family-friendly image associated with his most successful years.  This film showcases Mr. Denver's talents and passions before the patina of that image overwhelmed his delivery.

The songs included in this film are samples of some of his best material: Rocky Mountain High and Cold Nights in Canada are both there.  However, they serve (as Mr. Denver intended them) as a catalyst between the viewer and magnificent footage of the mountains and the species that live there.  Mr. Denver makes an appeal to protect and preserve these species without invoking sentiment or without turning the spotlight on himself.  As a labor of love, it is an admirable effort.

The production quality of the film probably cannot match the video produced today which is a shame.  On the other hand, if the viewer is interested in either the habits of Bighorn Sheep or would like to see Mr. Denver's genuine reactions to the world he loved best, this is a good choice.",1295740800,4,1262,4.892018779342723

A great nature documentary - with John Denver, and some of his music is included in the film! Filmed in 1972 - in color.",1191110400,7,266,4.134615384615385
