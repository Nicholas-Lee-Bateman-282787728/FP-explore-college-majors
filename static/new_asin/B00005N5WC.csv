1628879,4,B00005N5WC,"This a really good but obscure movie about a teenage boy who befriends an injured timber wolf and nurses him back to good health. There are quite a good few scenes of great photography and good acting from both people & the animals. The ending is very good too and not that predictable. I think the real star of the movie however is the wolf who plays the charater of 'Silver', who unfortunatly does not appear in the end credits for some reason, but he puts on a great performance.",1208131200,7,482,4.366666666666666

The photography is beautiful and I recommend it for good family watching.  This movie is not rated and suitable for all ages.  This is the DVD by Digiview.",1130544000,6,270,4.826086956521739
1628881,5,B00005N5WC,"With one exception - youngsters should be warned that wolves are wild animals --
This is a great family movie -- A troubled teen, who just lost his father, is exposed to the great outdoors and given a new outlook on life.
His uncle is in charge of the wildlife and helps his nephew to understand wolves [in cattle country] The cattlemen's association is definitely against the wolves being turned loose in their territory.
There are some great shots of snowboarding and the use of dog pulling on skis etc., that is very neat.
Would liked to have found out more about the animals used in the movie -- but the scenary, the characters and the shots were great.
Definitely recommend this as a great movie for all to see.",1015286400,20,716,4.515384615384615

7946399,5,B00005N5WC,I am part Cherokee so of course I think wolves are beautiful but I got this movie because I like Michael Biehn & I thought it would be nice to see him in something else. The sign of a good movie is you never feel like turning it off... this is a really good movie. Added bonus was to see Roy Scheider again.,1482019200,,307,3.888888888888889

7946406,5,B00005N5WC,"I have been looking for this movie for about 2 years. I have seen it was I when I was younger on television it looked like a pretty good movie when I first seen it.but hay I was like only 10 or 12 then.the day I bought the movie my older sister watched it like 3 or 4 times in a row.

the thing I like about it I liked it because it was a family movie and the movie was based on dogs mostly a wolf I love dogs like wolfs and huskies.

my sister liked it because it was based on a good story line but a little sad I think especially the part about a the boys dad.",1265068800,,562,3.6363636363636362
7946407,4,B00005N5WC,"This film is differant in that it's not the usual action type film that Michael Biehn is known for. In fact he's quite subdued here, yet gives a good performance as a young boy's uncle who helps his nephew come to grips with his fathers death and saves a young wolf in the process. It's a good family film.",1230422400,,306,4.203389830508475
