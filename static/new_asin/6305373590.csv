7888317,3,6305373590,"You have to have a love for John Waters' ""Edie"". This is a short film. I was expecting a little more. It was interesting as it gives a quick view of Edith Massey. Documentary in style.",1195257600,,184,4.138888888888889
7888318,5,6305373590,"The only bad thing I have to say about this short documentary is that it's way too short! 15 minutes if that...

But, it's worth the money...get it on dvd, it's better quality.

I appreciate her because she stood out in many of John Water's films....ever seen Desperate Living? She plays a demented queen and her performance is top-notch and hilarious!

This is just a quick glimpse of her life as an orphan, a madam and other things...we see her in her second hand shop, and sharing her experiences and stories with her customers. She's a true gem and will always be missed. It's a good movie to add to any John Water's collection...

We love you, egg lady!",1179705600,2,658,4.504201680672269
7888319,5,6305373590,"Edith Massey was ""THE"" Virgin Mary in this Modern life.  No one knew it, but she showed the world what the true meaning of love was.  You can actually see her halo hovering above her head when she sits in the play-pen in ""Pink Flamingos"" and shouts, ""Oh Mr. Eggman.  I love you so much!  Oh Babs!  What if there were no more eggs?""  Our own Virgin Mary never got this far.  What about Queen Carlotta from ""Desperate Living""?  ""Would you like some pizza little birdy?"" or ""Oh!  Ready, aim, FIRE!""  The best Catholic-ismatic moment had to be her pleading with her son 'Gator' in ""Female Trouble"".  ""Oh Gator.  I'd be so proud if you was a (...) and had a beautician boyfriend.  I'd never have to worry!  THe woRLd of heteroSexuAls is A sick AND boRIng LIFE!""  Her delivery was priceless!  If you ever had the chance to meet her or see her in one of her live acts, you would know what a kind and sweethearted person there was behind those over-sized (...) and matching tooths.  Yes, tooths.  This tape will probably never make it to DVD, as it is too short, as was Edie's life.  God bless her for spreading her love around Baltimore and little did she know, the rest of the Goddamned world!",1008115200,10,1187,4.362385321100917
7888320,5,6305373590,"WOW... A short documentary about one of the most lovable stars in cinema... I really really liked this.  Edith Massey is definately one of the most awesome ladies ever to roam the earth.  This is a surprisingly  sentimental documentary and extremely interesting.  If you don't like the  Egg Lady, Queen Carlotta, Cuddles, or any of her other characters...you  should be smacked upside your head!  Edith Massey was and always will be  an icon for underground/indie cinema.  So much class, so little teeth...  But a heart of purest gold and a gentleness about her that makes you wish  she were your mommy!  I know I'll be feeding her Eggs someday in the big  playpen in the sky, reciting Humpty Dumpty and laughing with glee.  I wish  she were still alive so I could give her a great big hug and tell her the  wonders she has added to the word ""film"".  I know shes up in  heaven, dancing and singing with David Lochary, Cookie Mueller, Divine, and  Maelcum Soul.  They are all extremely missed.  EDITH I LOVE YOU!",963446400,21,1011,4.598870056497175
7888321,5,6305373590,"I actually went out of my way to see this several years ago when it wasn't available on VHS, I had to rent the special edition of ""Polyester"" on disc to see it. It was definitely worth it. John  Waters had some pretty entertaining people in his Dreamland group but Edith  Massey was definitely the most loveable. I'm glad this warm hearted  documentary short (15 minutes, but worth it) was made before she passed  away. There's some great footage of her talking about her past as a  bar-girl in her endearing way. You'd never think hearing someone with 6  teeth talk would be so enjoyable. I miss her almost as much as I miss  Divine.",949536000,12,634,4.460869565217391
7888322,5,6305373590,"In my opinion, Love Letter to Edie is worth at least five dollars per minute. Does it get any better than a documentary on Edith Massey? Edith Massey is a true starlet!",946512000,11,168,4.28125
