8248031,5,B0012W3TM6,"By far the best Alaska hunting DVDs available. Content is real, real Alaskan Trophies are harvested and Billy Molls is the real deal, no Hollywood producing, just real awesome hunting footage that all hunters want to see!",1491177600,,221,5.0
8248032,1,B0012W3TM6,"I think the other reviews with 5 stars are friends of the film makers. This video is boring, boring, boring.  The editing is TERRIBLE! The first hour shows NO hunting at all. Its just them B.S.ing and talking about nothing interesting. Worse, they show the same scenes of them talking, and pitching their tents, and landing their bush planes, and then showing those same scenes over again. DO NOT PAY MONEY FOR THIS.  The best description of the footage is the guy went on a six month camping trip and made a video journal for his family to see the behind the scenes details of what he does when he's not hunting.",1356393600,,613,4.464285714285714
8248033,1,B0012W3TM6,"I bought this for my dad and we were both 100% disappointed. They basically just film the guy talking, and maybe show 5 min of actual hunting. So if you want to see some actual hunting in a hunting video, this is not the video for you. Huge waste of money.",1356393600,,256,4.03921568627451
8248034,5,B0012W3TM6,I purchased this for my husband as a fathers day gift. If your a hunting fan I think you will really enjoy. I know my husband enjoys it.,1340755200,,136,3.892857142857143
8248035,5,B0012W3TM6,"This is a must have for any hunter's dvd library. Great footage, edge of you seat action. If you think you are tough, watch Billy Molls.",1330128000,,136,4.269230769230769
8248036,5,B0012W3TM6,"If you have never experienced the Alaska wilderness and the excellent hunting that is offered and are thinking of giving it a try I suggest you purchase this DVD and the following 3 seasons as well. If you are looking for a series that is all actual footage and the real thing, this is it. The guides and the outfitter in these videos are top notch and this is realized within the video of the services that they offer each client. Highly recommend this 4 season series to any avid outdoorsman or anyone thinking of giving the outdoors and hunting a try.",1298505600,,554,4.4411764705882355
