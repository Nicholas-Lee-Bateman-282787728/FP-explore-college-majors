2702006,5,B000LC4Y4U,Another review stated that the video could use some tab - the complete tab is included on the dvd as a pdf.  If you don't have a pc there is a link you can use to download the tab.  Great video.  Highly recommended.  I hope Paul put's out more Rockabilly videos.,1206403200,10,262,4.078431372549019
2702007,5,B000LC4Y4U,"pretty good production.  i liked it enough to pick up the travis picking dvd.  i haven't practiced with it much yet, but it seems better taught than the brian setzer hotlicks tutorial from the 80's",1191456000,3,197,4.6
2702008,5,B000LC4Y4U,"A number one teaching tool for the rockabilly genre. Paul breaks it all down nice and easy giving you everything you need to get that authentic feel in your playing. I heard about this dvd from all the rave reviews on the gretsch pages forum and decided to give it a whirl. It is everything they say and more. Much to my surprise i found out he lives in my town. After seeing a few of his shows i whould say he is easily one of the premier guitarists in the billy\swing\bob genre. If you were to buy only one instructional dvd,this would be it.",1185148800,9,544,4.190476190476191
2702079,5,B000LC4Y4U,"I love this dvd. I have played guitar for a while and went to school for it and wanted to know more about rockabilly. I had some problems in my studies thinking initially I could just switch to major pent . While I could, it just lacked that flavor. Also with ""rock"" players we tend to stay in just one key for soloing if allowable. You know what I mean, don't pretend you don't. This video shows the benefit of switching along with the changes and what to do when there. The video is essentially one song of rockabilly soloing .He takes the time to speak on what chord is underneath the phrase ,making this more of a fishing pole than a fish if you know some basic theory. I most enjoyed his use of dominant arpegios up the neck in double stop form. Utilizing an E dominant arpegio wasn't new to me ,but using it in a rockabilly style was . Now I can use these examples in any key and really any style.

I'm nicknaming this ""eruption"" for rockabilly as a compliment. If you are able to play this video up to speed it would prove to most you have a handle on this style. For professionals that pay the rent with their instrument this would be an awsome weekend project and get you a gold star for diversity of style. For the beginner, it is not insurmountable because of the quality of instruction. A quality that is lost sometimes with players at Paul Pigats' level.
Buy it.",1340409600,11,1375,4.288461538461538
2702080,5,B000LC4Y4U,Very well done.  Difficult material to learn but with a seat next to the rewind button most intermediates will get it. Great info on tone and equip too.,1321660800,,152,4.428571428571429
2702081,5,B000LC4Y4U,Probably the best Rockabilly DVD out there!  Very thorough instruction and twang nasty material.  Not recommended so much for the beginner as it requires some practice and skill to nail the exercises.  It has helped kick start my feel for the genre of rockabilly and I would recommend it to all who want to do the same.  I would also get his Travis Picking DVD as well seeing as the style plays out greatly in Rockabilly.,1285200000,,421,4.5
2702082,3,B000LC4Y4U,"From the title of the DVD I expected Paul Pigat to present an introduction to rockabilly. This is not the case, though. He delves right into teaching riffs and licks. He does this, it has to be said, in a very thorough and patient manner. Paul is a very good teacher. Had he only chosen a systematic approach! ""Rockybilly Licks"" would have been a more appropriate title for this DVD.

Unlike most other instructional DVDs, this one doesn't contain the tabs, which must be downloaded from the publisher's website ([...]).

For the beginning rockabilly guitarist, I recommend Fred Sokolow's Rockabilly Guitar DVD; he takes it from the ground up (avoid his book on Rockabilly Guitar, however).",1281916800,9,690,4.939655172413793
2702083,3,B000LC4Y4U,This video isn't a guide to Rockabilly guitar. It shows you a set of riffs to learn. Paul takes his time and goes very slow. He is a very good teacher but this video is limited as far as the material he shows you.,1281571200,2,213,3.8636363636363638
2702084,5,B000LC4Y4U,This video gives you lots of moveable pieces and lets you create on your own after you learn them. It is thoroughly explained and tab is available in pdf. format if you insert the disc in your computer. Great licks and solos and well explained...what more could you ask for?,1265328000,,274,4.5
2702085,5,B000LC4Y4U,"Paul Pigat is an excellent instructor. Clear, concise, and useful tips. He covers a lot of territory in this one DVD - enough to keep anyone busy for a while.

It's intended for intermediate to advanced players. Someone just starting out would probably get frustrated, because it moves along pretty quickly. But I found it to be a good pace.

If you want to add some Rockabilly licks to your playing - get this DVD. You won't regret it.",1260576000,,436,4.506329113924051
2702086,5,B000LC4Y4U,Paul Pigat is one of the best rockabilly guitar instructor's out there! I am very happy with the progress I have made following all his DVD's.  Thank you Paul.,1237939200,,159,4.482758620689655
2702087,5,B000LC4Y4U,"Rockabilly guitar is not an easy style to master, and any beginner to the guitar will struggle. However if you really want the good stuff this is the DVD to buy, my other recommendation would be the similar titles by Jim Weider.
Please, please, please avoid the title by Troy Dexter, who trys to simplfy the process so much it no longer sounds like Rockabilly, for more look at my review of the product.",1221696000,7,403,4.45945945945946
2702088,5,B000LC4Y4U,Out of all of the rockabilly guitar video lessons that I own this is the absolute best!  Paul Pigat teaches some of the best classic rockabilly licks in a wonderfully slow and clear style.  I am actually learning great material and I feel like I am getting better at playing rockabilly guitar.  Thanks to Paul Pigat.,1208217600,3,316,4.607142857142857

8160934,5,B000LC4Y4U,"Really helped, Mr. Pigat is a patient instructor",1427760000,,48,5.125
8160935,4,B000LC4Y4U,"Audio recording of Mr. Pigat's voice is too soft, difficult to hear him at times. Great information, just not enough of it, I was hoping for more content. Not really for a beginner, more early intermediate.",1424131200,,206,4.75
8160936,5,B000LC4Y4U,I am an experienced guitar player who loves Rockabilly music.  This is an excellent instruction.  No matter what your level of playing you will definitely learn something of value from this.  I recommend this along with Jason Loughlin's 50 Rockabilly Guitar Licks You Must Know and The Guitar of Brian Setzer if you really want to get a handle on Rockabilly guitar.,1363996800,,365,4.854838709677419
8160937,5,B000LC4Y4U,"I bought this dvd back when it first came out. I have to agree with the reviewer that gave it 3 stars, everything said in that review is correct. This in not a dvd to teach you how to play Rockabilly, in fact if you aren't an intermediate player or just very determined this probably will end up as entertainment. Even at that it's worth it to me just to be able to see a player like Paul show you what he does up close. However, in spite of all that this is a great dvd lesson. Paul takes you through some awesome classic licks that he puts together in a way only Paul does.  I have been recommending this DVD and Loaning it out to select people since I got it and it is always a winner.  I am here now looking to buy more of Paul's dvds which I'm certain are above my level but I can Dream that someday I could play half as good as Paul.  Oh yeah, I attempt to use the licks from this dvd from time to time and ALWAYS get a strong reaction from the crowd when I do.",1358380800,,967,3.8984771573604062
8160938,5,B000LC4Y4U,"Just a wonderful set of lessons. Just right level of difficulty for an intermediate like myself. Challenging but doable with practice. Paul has a great teaching style. The tab is included btw, as a pdf.",1356652800,,202,4.8
8160939,5,B000LC4Y4U,A pleasure to watch and full of useful information. Pigat is a brilliant player and generously shares much of what he has up his sleeve. Highly recommended.,1355011200,,156,4.814814814814815
8160940,5,B000LC4Y4U,"This is amazingly helpful at a variety of levels; taking the beginner into playable riffs, and on to the real meat and potatoes of Rockabilly! It is a very good tool for enhanced guitar playing!",1352592000,,194,4.571428571428571
8160941,5,B000LC4Y4U,This is a really good rockabilly course.  Paul solos through about nine 12 bar rockabilly progressions. He presents a variety of riffs some of which are challenging at first but can be mastered if practiced.  He plays several Cliff Gallup inspired licks and includes several diminished licks.  All the progressions are in the key of E which is probably the key in which 75% of rockabilly songs are played.  Most of these licks can be transposed to others keys though a few use open strings and would not be readily transposable.  I would say this video along with Jason Loughlin's 50 rockabilly licks you must know are probably the best rockabilly videos.  People mention Jim Weiders videos which are ok and fun to watch but very expensive and are not as well tabbed out or demonstrated as Paul Pigat's or Jason Loughlin's.,1341792000,8,823,4.76056338028169
