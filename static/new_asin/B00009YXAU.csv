1898533,4,B00009YXAU,"As someone who works to historically preserve music, I think Disney has succeeded in not only preserving this film on DVD, but they deserve to be applauded for putting in all the extras, even if it's not conisdered the best of Disney films.  The print, audio and package is great.
I loved this film as a kid, and it was fun to re-watch as an adult.  Ok, it's not going to win the award for the best film ever.  It's definitely light Disney live action comparable to many of it's other 70s films. True, the original Escape To Witch Mountain was better, but this has some great moments of it's own. Also, it's got a fabulous cast, Bette Davis and Christopher Lee, and those incredible kids!!! Can you tell I like this film despite it's silliness?
What makes it all more special, are the extras.  They are laid out kind of strangely, and if you don't look around, you could miss them.  The highlight of these is the documentary, ""Making the 'return' trip."" If you wondered what ever happened to Kim and Iake, as well as the members of the gang (can you believe they actually grew up?), the crew, and director, they're all here.  Thank you everyone at Disney for putting the extra effort into this release.  Keep up the good work!",1065052800,25,1226,4.4708520179372195
1898534,5,B00009YXAU,"I just got my DVD of this movie today. And I loved it a lot. I had a copy of this movie on VHS but it was wearing out so I got the DVD. I really liked the Specail Features. I don't suggest this to kids that are under the age of 8 because it can be a little scary.
Here is a brief description of this movie.
Tony and Tia come back to the USA for a vactaion. This movie takes place in Los Angeles. There Tony meets the Criminal Mastermind Dr. Victor Gannon (Christopher Lee) and his Henchwoman, and Benefactor Letha (Bette Davis). Victor sees Tony's magical powers and kidnaps him for his own use. It ends up with Tia saving the day and rescuing her brother from the evil clutches of Victor and Letha.
Great Movie 5 Star Rating.",1062460800,4,726,4.119718309859155
1898535,2,B00009YXAU,"I own this movie on VHS. Ok I'll admit they made a sequel. (Did I just say that?) If you are a fan of the original ""Escape to Witch Mountain"", this film is a bit of a disappointment.
""Return From Witch Mountian"",is slow and much more dark a film than the original. The vilians and sub-plots have more holes then swiss cheese. If you like the characters of Tia and Tony the movie won't disapoint to much. (I think...)
If you are picking up this movie for its collectability value then go for it! If you are picking up this movie for you viewing pleasure, put it back on the shelf and make yourself a grilled cheese sandwich. Unless, of course, you like cheezy movies.",1062374400,2,666,4.336
1898536,5,B00009YXAU,"Disney's ""Return From Witch Mountain"" is a classic film that highlights the story of super powered alien brother and sister Tony and Tia. ""Return"" is actually the sequel to it's previous film ""Escape From Witch Mountian"". The two children discover thier alien origins in the first film and now, having spent time with thier own people, in the sequel return to the outside world and start a new adventure. Hollywood Grand Dame Bette Davis plays a ruthless industrialist who plans to use the sibling's mental powers to further her own gain, along with fellow henchman actor Christopher Lee. This movie brings a lot of great memories to mind. The DVD also promises to include lots of great bonus features such as a commentary with the film stars Ike Eisenmann and Kim Richards along with Director John Hough. There also proves to be a behind the scenes look at the film called ""Making the Return Trip"" that should make fans of the film happy. In addition Disney is expanding their 'Lost Treasures' releases by including an original interview with actor Christopher Lee. A 1978 Disney Studio Album will also be included along with the film's theatrical trailer. Widescreen and Dolby sound doesn't hurt either. Tack on the animated short ""The Eyes Have It"" and you've got yourself one DVD fans of the genre will be more than happy to own.",1057536000,20,1333,4.82532751091703

The sister is forced to try to use her powers to overcome her brothers powers and to stop the evil plot.  She is helped by a very young street gang and a goat.,1430870400,,522,4.275510204081633

1898588,3,B00009YXAU,"Not as good as the first one, but my 5 year old and 9 year old both enjoyed it very much. Their thoughts was this one had more of a creepy aspect to it (in a good, scary sense), whereas the first one had more magic and mystery. They also liked the first one's variety of effects better, even though I think technically this one had better visual effects. Their comment was that in this one, it was ""mostly just lifting people and things"". It was good enough that they were asking about whether there was a third movie that was not a made-for-TV movie (once I explained to them about made-for-TV usually implying low quality, especially in the 70's).",1405468800,,649,4.416666666666667

1898590,2,B00009YXAU,"I love Bette Davis and was delighted she starred in this classic and seeing Christopher Lee could only mean a bonus. That's where it ended. I'm sorry but the bad guys got away with much too much, Tony and Tia weren't up for much, and all I wanted to do was hand my plate back and say 'this is for a restricted diet, I can have salt.'

  The rental was for more than 24 hours but once was enough.",1394150400,,395,3.9746835443037973
1898591,3,B00009YXAU,"They say, Bette Davis took this role because she knew it was innocent enough for her grandchildren to watch.  And that is high praise for a film these days.

I enjoyed it for the child-like romp that it is - and for all the gratuitous footage of the glorious CITROEN DS (the villians black car of choice).",1393459200,,305,4.333333333333333

1898594,4,B00009YXAU,Bette Davis! She was too much. She  became almost a cartoon character. Over acting every line and those eyes! Bette Davis Eyes,1392163200,,126,4.7272727272727275
1898595,3,B00009YXAU,"Some of the closing dialog between Jason O'Day and Uncle Bene in ""Escape"" covered the fact that there were other castaway children out there and Jason would look for them- when Disney made this movie they completely ignored that. Get the expensive ""Beyond Witch Mountain"" for, I guess, a taste of what should've been done here.
This time out a couple of years have passed and Uncle Bene takes the saucer to Los Angeles (in broad daylight - no one notices this) to drop Tony & Tia off for a few days fun. We never get where they're supposed to go or who'll be paying the cab fare.
Tony is soon captured by some very cartoonish bad guys and subjected to remote mind control, Tia meets up with 4 street boys (the 3 white ones are in a couple of the extras on the DVD).and they spend the bulk of the movie trying to rescue Tony and save the day. All of the kids are good in this movie- too bad all of the adults are so cartoonish and the story so off course. Some very impressive FX work here (and some obvious matte work on some flying trash barrels & gold bullion) really helps a poor story. Some of the best levitation I think I've ever seen.
As with ""Escape"" you have your pop up fun facts (interesting even when they don't apply to the movie) and other extras - three choices of English (and I guess French & Spanish) subtitling for dialog/commentary & fun facts. The movie is also closed captioned - this will appear right over the subtitling so you can't really have both captioning & ""fun facts"" at the same time.
Worth a look but I'm more likely to revisit ""Escape"" than this one.",1391644800,,1585,4.322147651006712

1898597,3,B00009YXAU,"I was sentimental of the original movie that was seen as a child - it was great to share with my own kids who LOVED Escape to Witch mountain. Perhaps it's because I never saw this sequel as a kid, but as an adult it was disappointing, but bit my tongue in case the kids liked it.  Still it was great that with all the outdated special effects, these modern kids still love the storyline of Tia and Tony!  The Earthquake Gang was very cute though!

1898621,4,B00009YXAU,"It's been three years since we last saw psychically gifted Tony (Ike Eisenmann) and Tia (Kim Richards) and their Uncle Bene (Denver Pyle)--a period during which, apparently, many of the other spacewrecked children have found their way to Witch Mountain, since Uncle Bene speaks of ""establishing our own community"" there.  Deciding to reward the kids with a break during which they can see something of how Earth kids live, he takes them to LA for an independent weekend vacation.  But when Tony uses his mental powers to save a man (Anthony James) tumbling from the top of a building, he becomes the prisoner and pawn of Prof. Victor Gannon (Christopher Lee) and his sponsor, the wealthy but larcenous Letha (Bette Davis).  Gannon, who has invented an apparatus that allows him to control the minds of others, dreams of becoming ""the most powerful man in the world;"" Letha and her nephew Sickle just want to get rich.  After a hilariously bungled attempt to use Tony to steal a stash of gold bars, the trio make up their minds to sabotage a nuclear facility and extract blackmail for its safety.  Tia, left on her own, must find and rescue her brother with nothing more but occasional flashes of mental communication and the help of a quartet of young wannabe tough guys, Dazzler (Christian Juttner), Muscles (Brad Savage), Crusher (Poindexter Yothers), and Rocky (Jeffrey Jacquet), who have troubles of their own--a rival gang and a persistent truant officer (Jack Soo)--but know LA well and prove indispensable in her quest.  Kids will enjoy seeing youngsters of their own age outwitting the grownups and saving the day (and each other), and adults can find amusement in watching Lee and Davis strut their stuff.

1898622,1,B00009YXAU,"This is a response to reviewer Trevor Henderson's ""Oh, really?""  Here are a few more ""Oh, really?""s:  Tia and Tony were supposed to show up at a hotel, where (I inferred from something Uncle Bene said) someone was to take care of their cab fare and presumably assume some responsibility for them, and yet no one from the hotel reports them as ""no shows"".  Uncle Bene doesn't expect Tia and Tony to check in with him at any time, even though they are rather young to be left alone in a large and unfamiliar city.  Or how about this?: six children and three unauthorized adults (the villains) are running around loose in a nuclear facility that is under alert, but no one searches the cooling system area where some of the strange events are taking place; no one has called in any security force -- in-house, police or military -- to secure the premises, even though the city of Los Angeles might be destroyed by the impending explosion.  The children and the villains are allowed free reign; not one scientist or guard in the area.

The best part of this movie is one particular special effect -- primitive though we now consider it: the refurbishing of the wrecked van.  Effects like that are always fun; there's even a scene of refurbishing in one of the Harry Potter movies.",1304380800,,1276,4.5701754385964914

Much of the movie has a gang of kids skipping school who befriend the star girl played by Kim Richards then they walk every where in Los Angeles.  Oh really?

1898630,2,B00009YXAU,"After a few years living with others of their kind on Witch Mountain, Tia and Tony Malone (Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann) return to American society in RETURN TO WITCH MOUNTAIN for a field trip.  Their spaceship lands at the Rose Bowl and a taxi is waiting to take them the hotel in L.A. where they will be staying.  On the drive to the hotel, the taxi runs out of gas (he had his cab idling the entire time he was waiting for the siblings to appear) and Tia gets a premonition that a man is going to fall to his death from a nearby building.  Tony gets out and sees the man just as he falls of the building.  Using some of his supernatural abilities, Tony stops the man from hitting the ground and suspends him in mid-air.  Tony has definitely become more powerful since he was last seen.

The only problem is that Tony's actions are seen by Letha (Bette Davis) and Victor (Christopher Lee), a duo who are attempting to become the wealthiest person in the world (Letha) and the most powerful person in the world (Victor).  The man who fell of the building is Letha's brother, Sickle (Anthony James), and was the guinea pig of Victor's mind control experiment.  Victor knows a good thing when he sees it and injects Tony with a needle to knock him out and then kidnaps the boy and brings him to his lair in the basement of Letha's large mansion.

Before passing out, Tony is able to call out telepathically to Tia and alert her of the situation.  Tia is only able to see the car with the unconscious Tony in it drive away.  Tia returns to the cab only to find it has left, leaving Tia stranded in a bad neighborhood.  She doesn't know where Tony was taken and doesn't know where the taxi was taking them and is left to fend for herself. She ends up rescuing a bunch of rag-tag kids who call themselves the Earthquake gang from getting beaten up by some other kids.  The Earthquake gang really isn't much of a gang and is just a group of friends who want to hang out together and skip school (one of the kids calls himself ""Dazzler""--I guess that used to be frightening, but it makes me think of an American Gladiator and caused me to laugh).

Anyway, with a few moments of telepathic communication with Tony and some help from the Earthquake gang, Tia is eventually able to track Tony down, but gets captured herself.  When she awakens she finds herself tied down to a table in a plastic bubble. She's unable to use most of her abilities because of the gas in the bubble, but is able to talk to a nearby goat that she sends to get the Earthquake gang.  Meanwhile, Victor and Letha have taken Tony to a nuclear power plant with their eyes set on this being their first step in taking over the world.

I enjoyed watching ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN. There was a childlike wonder to it, but one that was grounded by a good story and screenplay along with some great actors.  On the surface, RETURN TO WITCH MOUNTAIN seems like a good story and the actors in the movie are amazing (Christopher Lee, Bette Davis, and even Jack Soo portraying helpless truant officer Mr. Yakamoto, as well as Richards and Eisenmann).  Yet, I was completely let down by the movie.  It has some of the same child-like wonder, but the reality that grounded that wonder is replaced by a seemingly mindless serious of scenes (Wouldn't it be cool to see gold fly? Let's have a car crash! What if Tia and Tony had to fight each other in a duel to the death?).  Other than the Earthquake gang, the actors are great actors but there characters really aren't given anything to do: Ike Eisenmann spends most the movie talking in a monotone voice, Christopher Lee spends a lot of time grinning like an evil scientist, Bette Davis just talks a lot about money, and Kim Richards spends the majority of the time running around as though she's on a vision quest to nowhere.

There are a few memorable scenes in the movie:  the bus that is lifted into the air, the van that overturns, and the kids flying in the air at the end of the movie.  Still event these scenes and the great acting talent of the cast aren't able to salvage the movie from the depths of awfulness of the story.  It's disappointing because the premise had so much potential and if the film had a better script, there might have been several more Witch Mountain movies with Tony and Tia.

Fans of the first film will probably want to watch RETURN TO WITCH MOUNTAIN, but will probably be disappointed.  The movie does have some kid appeal, but it's so childish that other than those few memorable scenes even kids won't remember much about the movie.

Special features include an audio commentary, pop-up facts feature for watching the movie, ""Making the Return Trip"" featurette, 1978 Spanish Interview with Christopher Lee with subtitles, a montage of clips called ""Disney Kids With Powers"", an interview with three of the four actors who were the Earthquake gang, the 1978 Disney Studio Album, and the short cartoon ""The Eyes Have It"" featuring Donald Duck.

Of the extras, I really enjoyed ""Making the Return Trip"", the Christopher Lee interview, and ""The Eyes Have It.""  ""Making the Return Trip"" is the usual making-of featurette that many DVDs include nowadays.  However, like the making-of on ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN, this one has just enough gumption to make it more interesting than the typical making-of featurette.  Christopher Lee is an amazingly talented actor who speaks several different foreign languages fluently as displayed in the ""lost"" interview on this DVD.  Lee speaks with a Spanish journalist about RETURN TO WITCH MOUNTAIN as well as other projects he has, including the now classic horror film, THE WICKER MAN.  The interviewer even gets Lee to sing a few bars from an opera.  In all honesty, even though RETURN TO WITCH MOUNTAIN isn't a very good movie, this DVD is worth owning for that interview alone. ""The Eyes Have It"" is a cartoon short where Donald Duck gets some hypnotizing glasses that he uses to hypnotize Pluto into thinking he is other animals than a dog. Hilarity ensues until Donald turns Pluto into a raging beast that destroys the glasses.",1238284800,2,6111,4.565018315018315
1898631,4,B00009YXAU,"The classic Walt Disney sci-fi film ""RETURN FROM WITCH MOUNTAIN"" (1978) is released on DVD to help celebrate the theatrical release of ""RACE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN"" (the third `WITCH MOUNTAIN' film which can be considered a new storyline or a re-imagining of the first film).

""RETURN FROM WITCH MOUNTAIN"" is the long awaited sequel to ""ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN"" (1975) and continue to be a family sci-fi film to utilize the latest special effects at that time and bring back popular British director John Hough and popular teen talents Ike Iesenmann and Kim Richards to reprise their role as the alien human brother and sister team who have supernatural abilities.

""RETURN FROM WITCH MOUNTAIN"" focuses on the return of Tony and Tia to the planet Earth.  The two haven't been back in several years, so they get the opportunity to have some rest and relaxation.

Meanwhile, a mad scientist named Victor (Christopher Lee) and Letha (Bette Davis) talk about how they should be making money.  Letha was once a very rich woman but funded Victor's laboratory in order manipulate people and control them.  Victor decides to put Letha's nephew Sickle (Anthony James) to a test by using a remote control device in which Victor talks on it and the person will follow his instructions.  His first instruction is to have Sickle climb up a tall building and walk on the rooftop ledge and seeing how the remote control device is actually working on him.

Meanwhile, as Tony and Tia are being driven in their cab, the cab loses fuel prompting the taxi cab driver to get gas.  While left alone, Tia's premonitions start kicking in to full gear as she senses a man who will fall to his death from falling from a building.

Knowing that they one would have to wait for the driver, Tony goes to find this man and warn him.  Sickle ends up falling from the rooftop but before he can go splat on the pavement, Tony uses his supernatural abilities to have him suspended in air and eventually help him down.

Victor sees that Tony is quite special and thus Victor and Letha inject John with a tranquilizer and kidnaps him.

Tia is scared that she has lost contact with Tony and goes to look for him.  She ends up losing him and while trying to look around the area, she sees four kids being chased by a bunch of thugs.  She eventually uses her power to save the four kids named Dazzler (Christian Juttner), Muscles (Brad Savage), Crusher (Poindexter Yothers) and Rocky (Jeffrey Jacquet).

The four are trying to be tough kids who want to start their own gang but also hide from their truant officer Mr. Yokomoto (Jack Soo) who wants them back at school.

With no place to go and not knowing the Los Angeles area, the kids decide to help Tia.  Meanwhile, Tony has been thoroughly brainwashed by Victor and is now being controlled by him by the remote device.

With Tony revealing his power to the bad guys, now they want to exploit his power to give them leverage and possibly help them steal anything from gold to possible plutonium.

Meanwhile, Tia tries to search for her brother everywhere and when she does find him, she is pitted against her brother in a battle of their super powers. Will she be able to save her brother from being a pawn of Victor and Letha?

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""RETURN FROM WITCH MOUNTAIN"" includes several special features.  Many which were included in the 2003 DVD release but there is one special feature that is exclusive to the 2009 DVD release.  Included are:

  * ALL NEW Pop-Up Fun Facts - For those who want to watch the film with fun facts popping up on the bottom of the screen.
  * Making the Return Trip - A pretty lengthy featurette with interviews with director John Hough, Ike Eisenmann, Kim Richards and the other children from the film.  The discussion was how they all came together again, the popularity of the first film and how Ike and Kim, unlike the first film where they worked closely together, this time they didn't.  But what is most interesting was to hear how the guys had a crush on Kim Richards.
  * The Gang's Back in Town - A reunion of the gang Christian Juttner (Dazzler), Brad Savage (Muscles) and Poindexter Yothers (Crusher) who talk about having fun on the set, having a crush on Kim Richards and how the film was one of the best experiences of their lives.
  * Disney Kids with Powers - A short music video of various clips of children in Disney films that have powers.
  * ""The Eyes Have It"" - An animated short featuring Donald Duck and Pluto, as Donald learns hypnotism and his test subject is Pluto.
  * Lost Treasure: Christopher Lee: The Lost Interview - An interview with Christopher Lee done back in 1978 with a Spanish television network.  Lee talks about working on the film and his experience for a Disney film.  Subtitled in English.
  * 1978 Disney Studio Album - A short musical featurette featuring stills from all films that were shown in 1978.
  * Audio Commentary - Commentary by John Hough, Ike Eisenmann and Kim Richards.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by ""RETURN FROM WITCH MOUNTAIN"".  Mainly because you have legendary actress Betty Davis and Christopher Lee (known for his work in the past with the Vampire and Fu Manchu films and presently with his work as Count Dooku in the ""Star Wars"" films) .  But it was great to see them out of their typical film element and playing a humorous duo, Letha obsessed with money and Victor obsessed with the power and prestige he can get from utilizing Tony for his own twisted means.

But many people wanted a sequel and this time, the series would managed to capture an action film with an a chase scene and even more special features than the first film.  Definitely something you wouldn't imagine seeing in a family film but John Hough wanted to make sure the film was different from the first and if he could, make it even better.

One thing that I liked was that both Tony and Tina are nearly at the same level in their powers.  In the first film, it seemed like the only way Tony could use his powers was playing a harmonica.  But glad they didn't do that for this film.

I enjoyed the first film for its cat and mouse type of storyline, it was a pure film that is fun for the family and kids.  With ""RETURN FROM WITCH MOUNTAIN"", because more special effects were used and more action scenes, it was interesting to see both Tony and Tia separated but most of all, watching them go against each other utilizing their supernatural abilities.

Speaking of special effects, the first film utilized a cat and a bear.  ""RETURN FROM WITCH MOUNTAIN"" utilized Albert the goat and it's amazing how trainers were able to get a goat to walk through the middle on top of several cars.  Very impressive.

Now, for those who own the 2003 DVD release of ""RETURN TO WITCH MOUNTAIN"", you may not need this DVD because there really is no major addition in terms of special features but for those who are looking forward to watching Dwayne Johnson in ""RACE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN"" in 2009 and have never watched the original films or its been too long since you have last seen it, then definitely pick up both classic Witch Mountain films.  They're both fun and enjoyable in their own separate way.

As for ""RACE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN"", both ""ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN"" and ""RETURN FROM WITCH MOUNTAIN"" both come with a free ticket coupon (attached to the slipcase cover) to download a certificate (ticket) in order to watch the latest film at a participating theater for free.

Overall, ""RETURN TO WITCH MOUNTAIN"" is a fun and enjoyable film and despite being nearly 35 years old, it's a film that families can watch with their children now and still be entertained.

Definitely a Disney classic worth having in your DVD library.",1236470400,12,7738,4.59402332361516
1898632,4,B00009YXAU,"Tia (Kim Richards) and Tony (Ike Eisenmann) have come to Los Angeles for a week of culture.  They'll get to spend their time touring museums and attending a concert or two.  But on their way to the hotel, their taxi runs out of gas.  When they both get a premonition that a man is about to fall to his death, Tony goes to rescue him.

Naturally, the man levitating in the air attracts the attention of those standing nearby.  Unfortunately for Tony, those nearby are mad scientist Victor (Christopher Lee) and his financier Letha (Bette Davis).  Victor is perfecting a devise that would put anyone wearing it under his complete control.  Naturally, the two know they can use Tony's powers to their benefit so they kidnap him.  Now Tia must team up with a gang of truant wanna be hooligans to try to find him.  Will her powers be enough to rescue her brother?

I'll admit I didn't find the first movie all that entertaining, but I pressed on with the sequel anyway.  I'm glad I did.  This movie was fun in an over the top, campy sort of way.  You can't take it seriously at all or it will annoy you.  But if you sit down looking for some Disney 70's fun, you'll find it.  There are several inventive scenes in the movie that feature good special effects and decent action played for laughs.  The villains are just menacing enough to be taken seriously without losing the fun factor of the movie.

Of course, my roommates would tend to disagree.  They came home while I was part way through and thought the movie was horrid.  Which probably means that it is best left to the intended audience of the young and the young at heart.

The part that bothered me the most was the street gang roaming Los Angeles by themselves.  But this is Disney and they aren't really that bad.

No, this isn't great cinema or a must watch, but it will keep kids entertained.  And since they are the intended audience, that's all that matters.",1235952000,,1920,4.454022988505747
1898633,3,B00009YXAU,"Most of the magic in the first film, Escape to Witch Mountain, was the closeness and interaction of Tony and Tia and the development of their relationship. We're drawn in as we find out more about their powers and are carried along with them on their journey. In this film, Return from Witch Mountain, that audience inclusion is largely lost by the fact that for almost the entire film, the two of them are separated, and Tony hardly has any lines at all. You feel jerked back and forth between two story lines and never get drawn into the action as if you were a part of. Christopher Lee, however, is excellent as the villain, but Bette Davis is terrible. Plus the whole thing is in and around L.A. with real places, buildings, etc. In the first film, part of the mystery was that you did not know exactly where things were taking place. This one misses the mark, but most sequels do. Oh well.",1231200000,4,894,4.424242424242424

1898635,1,B00009YXAU,"I grabbed this at the library as they didn't have much else to choose from and thought at the very least it might be entertaining to see Bette Davis in a Disney film.

WRONG.  ""Return From Witch Mountain"" is SO horribly dated -- especially the laughable ""special"" (not) effects -- let alone the stale script and the hokey acting by the teen leads, that it's truly the prime example of why the Disney Studio almost went out of business in the late 1970's.

Even the commentary by director John Hough and now-grown actors Ike Eisenmann and the gravel-voiced Kim RIchards (sister of ""Mother of the Year"" Kathy Hilton, aunt of Paris) is tedious at best.

Hough's comments are especially boring and almost embarrassing, confirming his poor direction of this film.  He even (repeatedly) pronounces Bette Davis'  name wrong, which I'm sure she loved, calling her ""Bett"".  An inexcusable insult, especially after working with her.  Note that in his 40 year career, Hough has made virtually nothing worth remembering, including this prize turkey.

So bad, it's not even worth it for FREE at the public library.",1201305600,2,1101,4.908108108108108
1898636,4,B00009YXAU,"This 1978 movie was a follow up to the 1975 movie, ""Escape to Witch Mountain.""  The original was more charming and clever than this movie, though this movie featured many more special effects than the original.  Even though this movie was more formulaic than the original, it is worth having and watching, particularly if you enjoyed the original.

Tony (Ike Eisenmann) and Tia (Kim Richards) are back again.  This time they are taking a vacation in Los Angeles as a reward for their efforts in helping their people establish the settlement at Witch Mountain.  Uncle Bene (Denver Pyle) drops Tony and Tia off at the Rose Bowl in Los Angeles, where Tony and Tia catch a cab.

Things go awry almost immediately.  The cab runs out of gas.  The cab driver walks down the block to get more.  While Tony and Tia are waiting for the driver to return, Tony senses that a man is about to fall from a building.  What Tony does not know is that the man falls during an experiment conducted by Dr. Victor Gannon (Christopher Lee).  Letha (Bette Davis) is financing Dr. Gannon's experiments.

Dr. Gannon recognizes Tony's potential immediately.  If Dr. Gannon could combine Tony's mental powers with his mental control device, Dr. Gannon could have incredible power.  Dr. Gannon captures Tony and they all return to Letha's house, where Dr. Gannon installs a control device on Tony.  Unfortunately, Letha has significant financial problems and her goals are somewhat more immediate and financially oriented.

Letha and her nephew Sickle (Anthony James) take Tony and the control device to a museum that is displaying $3 million in gold.  Since this movie is a Disney movie, we know that the heist will have to fail in some way.  The heist fails when Tia shows up, supported by a gang of four boys.  Tia begins interfering with Tony's disruption of the museum, and causes Letha, Sickle and Tony to leave in haste.  Tia was not involved in trying to put $3 million in heavy gold into a station wagon, which you will have to see for yourself.

Dr. Gannon is furious, but he decides that perhaps he could combine his desire for power with Letha's need for money, and he plots to take control of a plutonium processing facility.  Before Dr. Gannon and his gang head out, they trick Tia coming to Tony and then they capture her.

The end of the movie increases in excitement as Tia tries to stop Tony from wreaking havoc on the nuclear plant.  Tony's actions throughout the movie confuse Tia because she is unaware of the control device until near the end of the movie.  I leave the viewer to see how things work out for Tony, Tia, the group of boys that help Tia, Letha, Dr. Gannon, Sickle, and Mr. Yokomoto (Jack Soo), the truant officer who chases after Tia and the boys throughout the movie.

This movie is relatively weak, but I bumped my rating to four stars because of the actors involved and some of the special effects.  Christopher Lee is always fun to watch.  Letha is one of Bette Davis's lesser roles, but she was a great actress.  Kim Richards, who was about 14-years-old at the time this movie was made, is incredibly cute and earnest.  Of course, with Tia there has to be Tony, so Ike Eisenmann's presence is a requirement.  The special effects range in quality.  Some are very weak, but several are outstanding.  I particularly enjoy the van scene at the end of the movie, which you will have to watch because I will say no more about that.  Several of the scenes in the chase following the attempted museum heist are very good, and make this chase scene one of the better chases in a Disney film, particularly from this era.

This movie was almost too late.  ""Star Wars"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" shocked the world with breakthrough special effects in 1977.  Subsequent films topped each other with ever-better stories and special effects.  Had this movie come any later, there may not have been an audience for it in theaters, and direct-to-video releases were still in the future.  Lucky for us this film was made so we can see, once more, the duo that charmed us in ""Escape to Witch Mountain.""

1898637,4,B00009YXAU,"Disney's sequel to its' popular sci-fi adventure, ""Escape to Witch Mountain,"" is even more entertaining than the original.  Kim Richards and Ike Eisemann reprise their roles as Tony and Tia, the super power siblings that have just returned to Earth in their shiny disc shaped flying saucer.  The kids are now in their teens and are once again preyed upon by criminal masterminds, this time Christopher Lee (of Hammer Studio's Dracula fame) and the legendary Queen of the Silver Screen herself, Bette Davis.  Disney did itself proud with this sequel, which has lots more special effects, lots more kid actors (including Brad Savage who played Kim's brother in Disney's ""No Deposit, No Return."") and a great story with fine performances by all, especially Kim and Ike.  The dvd special edition has a clean transfer and great audio, featuring entertaining interviews with Kim and Ike, plus three of the ""kid's street gang,"" Brad Savage (Muscles), Christian Juttner (Dazzler), and Poindexter Yothers (Crusher).  I highly recommend ""Return from Witch Mountain,"" as well as it's predecessor, ""Escape to Witch Mountain,"" to young viewers and Disney live-action movie fans.  These movies may not be able to compare with today's computer generated CGI effects, but they make up the difference with the more important ability to entertain with performances by a fine cast and to project that ""Disney charm"" which the new Disney films sadly lack.

**UPDATE!**  ""Escape To Witch Mountain"" and ""Return From Witch Mountain"" are now available both on one DVD disc, and sadly missing ALL of the movie trailers, commentaries, and extras that were part of the 2003 individual single disc ""Special Edition"" releases.
