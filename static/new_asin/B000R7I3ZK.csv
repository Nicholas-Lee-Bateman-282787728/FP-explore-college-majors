8199315,5,B000R7I3ZK,"Three football movies which are different but still very good. All three movies are entertaining. ""The Longest Yard"": the original with Burt Reynolds. Interesting film and very good performances by the cast. Even Reynolds. ""North Dallas Forty"": Very good movie about pro football. Gives you a realisitic look at pro football in the 70s. Nolte is terrific. ""Necessary Roughness"": fun film. Kathy Ireland is gorgeous!",1347580800,,415,5.4
