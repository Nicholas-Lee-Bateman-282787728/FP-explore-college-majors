8276163,4,B001A5J7G2,"I loved this DVD but, I felt it lacked the technical and mechanical detail that perhaps I was looking for.  It's true this DVD offers wonderful scenery of the most powerful freight train monstrosity to ever lurk the western rails, but at times, I wanted more.  I wanted screaming turbines up close and personal.  I needed fire, soot, smoke, and sparks.  What I got was vintage film rolls of passing turbine powered trains from the late 50s, early 60s. Although this is not entirely bad, I expected something else. I would complain about the sometimes shaky and ""phony"" colors hues, but then again, this is vintage film from U.P. I think I would have enjoyed this DVD at a five star level if I could have experienced this train in real life. Maybe if this monster tore through my town when I was a child, my nostalgia would have promoted this to five stars. To further note, the film provides rare footage of steam helpers, cabooses, and rail operations that are pretty much obsolete today.  Some footage adds artistic class, such as a memorable shot of the train passing in front of the setting sun and capturing some lens flare, or a birds-eye view that contains footage of the real length of some of these trains (absolutely amazing). All in all, I would recommend this film, but with a word of caution.",1352160000,2,1305,4.607758620689655
