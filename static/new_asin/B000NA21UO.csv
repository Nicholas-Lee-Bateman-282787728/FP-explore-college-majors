2763376,5,B000NA21UO,"Here is The Duke presented wonderfully by Legend Films. My husband insisted on purchasing this one since he is a big fan of all of John Wayne's films. A great film and very entertaining, so well worth the purchase price. Also not sure why one consumer had an issue saying there was no color?? We watched a great colorized version and have no complaints!",1395964800,,353,4.53125
2763377,5,B000NA21UO,I have seen this many many times in black and white but I just saw that this is available in color so I rented it. There is nothing color about this. The whole thing is black and white just like the copy that I currently have on DVD. Don't pay for this if you are looking for a color version.,1369699200,,292,3.8833333333333333
2763378,3,B000NA21UO,"An early Republic entry this John Wayne film is less than hour long typical of B-Western.  Legend films has colorized this film but left the soundtrack alone.
The colorization is not a high quality job but still better than B&W. But the B&W version is here anyway as well for those who hate colorization.  I have news for Legend Films; the people who hate colorization won't buy this anyway so don't waste your time with B&W version.
The actual movie has an exciting stagecoach race as the finale with Yakima Cannutt and John Wayne doing excellent stunt work.  Wayne totally dominates the film and although [...]
Phyllis Fraser is pretty she adds nothing.
The original title is Winds of the Wasteland from 1936.  The DVD title really is a better title for the film.",1282694400,3,765,4.686567164179104
2763379,5,B000NA21UO,"loved this movie. seeing it in color was even better! great stagecoach
race. back then, they really knew how to wreck 'em. wayne is double tough. you gotta see this one.",1244419200,2,169,4.483870967741935
2763380,5,B000NA21UO,"Stagecoach Run, 1936's appropriately renamed Winds of the Wasteland, is one of John Wayne's greatest B-grade Western efforts, and one of the last such performances he would give before moving on to the later highlights we typically associate with his career.  In part, this success is due to the notable improvement in quality (from writing to sound to setting) over the rest of its Lone Star Productions counterparts.  The film's highlight is an amazing (trust me) stagecoach race through the gorgeous valleys of northern California that foreshadows Ben Hur's epic race several decades later (appropriate, given that Yakima Canutt was involved with both projects).  Very Wells Fargo of them!

This is probably one of the more family-friendly Wayne films, for several reasons.  First, it carries a positive message about perseverance through adversity (a dying town) and ""making lemons out of lemonade"" that is atypical of the western genre, which is often focused on revenge and the like.  Secondly, Stagecoach Run is in color, making it more accessible to the younger generation, who too often has no patience or interest in anything black and white.  Of course, it's worth mentioning that this DVD contains both the black and white and the colorized versions, so you're blessed with the option of choice.  Finally, there's an excellent John Wayne trivia game buried in the bonus features that is quite fun to play with your family, particularly if they happen to be film buffs as well.

If you're in the market for a B-Western, Stagecoach Run will not disappoint.",1228176000,10,1566,5.109803921568627
2763381,5,B000NA21UO,Legend Films does the BEST job of restoring and colorizing movies and this movie is a wonderful example.  I've said it before and I'll say it again- you can't go wrong when you purchase a movie done by Legend Films!!!!!  Wonderful movie - beautiful color:),1187481600,10,256,4.666666666666667

8176212,4,B000NA21UO,"They don't make 'em like this anymore.  And I don't know why.  I really don't.  I used to see these older films on local TV ages ago in the 70s.  I don't remember half of them, but every now and then one pops up.

This one has a pretty good story to it.  I'm just sorry it was colorized and had some sound added to it.  I'm not an anti-colorist snob or anything, it's just that it looked pretty bland to me, and I wasn't sure it added anything to the film.  Though I guess younger viewers might expect color in their media.  I wonder if the original negative of this film is still around somewhere.  If that could get cleaned up (both audio and visuals) the film might stand up on its own without all the colorization.  Just me.

Otherwise it's a pretty decent film.  Have a look-see, partner.",1505347200,,793,4.206666666666667
