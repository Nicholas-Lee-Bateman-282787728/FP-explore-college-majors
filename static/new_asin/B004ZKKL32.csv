4509531,5,B004ZKKL32,"1. How many episodes are there, in total?
20! 460 minutes long, in total; 114-115 mins long for each DVD.

2. How many episodes are there, per DVD?
They count each half-episode as an entire episode. But, if you're counting the whole half hour (or 22-minutes, more-like)... each of them have 5 episodes. Disk one has 5 eps, Disk two has 5 eps, etc...

3. Are there any extras?
Nope, lol. ^^; (But maybe if we ask nicely, Nick will put them in future volumes, or include a whole bunch of them on a separate DVD.)

4. Are the episodes in production order?
No, I believe they are in the order that they aired (in the U.S.)... See below for the order...

5. What episodes are included?
DISK 1:
Downtown as Fruits, Eugene's Bike, The Little Pink Book, Field Trip, Arnold's Hat, Stoop Kid, Helga's Makeover, The Old Building, 6th Grade Girls, The Baseball.
DISK 2: Heat, Snow, Operation Ruthless, The Vacant Lot, The List, Haunted Train, Mugged, Roughin' It, Door #16, Arnold as Cupid.
DISK 3: Arnold's Christmas, Beachwarmer, Cool Jerk, Das Subway, Wheezin' Ed, Tutoring Torvald, Gerald Comes Over, Spelling Bee, Pigeon Man.
DISK 4: Olga Comes Home, Sally's Comet, Abner Come Home, The Sewer King, False Alarm, World Records, Magic Show, 24 hours to live, Arnold's Valentine.

6. What did it play on?
It plays on my Playstation 2 (but it seems to skip during the lightning parts/scenes-- if that's your only DVD player, you might not want to get it, unless you just don't mind the skippage/slippage XD).
It works perfectly fine in my other DVD players tho: An HP Pavilion dv9700 Laptop/Notebook PC (which is a DVD+RW and runs on Windows Vista), my desktop downstairs (which is a Dell 9100, CD/DVD-R and runs on Windows XP)... and our normal DVD player, which is a Toshiba DVD Video play/Video Cassete Recorder SD-V280 ^__^;; That's all I had to test it on, lol, but it worked on ALL of them!!! So, success! :DDD
OH! The only thing that it didn't work on is the bottom DVD+-RW drive on my desktop PC... (I have two DVD drives on the desktop-- the one on the top works) but I think the bottom one is just for burning, not for *playing* DVDs. :P (This is to the best of my knowledge.)

----

Additional comments: WOW, what a crystal-clear picture!! On the computer, it let me take screen shots easily. To my eye, it looks better on T.V. than on the monitor, but maybe it's just my monitor...? Sound quality is good. It doesn't mention anything on the DVD if it's Dolby Surround Sound or anything, but I don't know if it needs to. No captioning available. It shows the opening theme/sequence at the beginning of the DVD (like, before ""Downtown as Fruits"" on Disk 1, for example, and once after all of the episodes are finished (like, after ""The Baseball"" on Disk 1).

Let me just say that ""Hey Arnold!"" in general deserves a 5/5 (in fact, it deserves an 11,000,000/5, but that's probably impossible, lol)

If you are worried just about the episode quality, you shouldn't be, as this definitely has great quality, Dolby Surround Sound or not (I don't know how to test that without actually having speakers that work for it). Just don't expect any extras, lol.

To Nickelodeon: If you're listening/looking at this, please give the fans some DVD Extras in the upcoming disks, or all of them on one, big disk.

To the Current Fans: If you guys REALLY want The Jungle Movie, I urge you to buy the HELL out of these DVDs (and/or at iTunes, if you prefer). Never Say Never!!! Just as long as we stay as optimistic as our favorite Football-Shaped Head :DD lols
All in all, I definitely believe it is worth the money, and I'd buy it again if I had the chance. Instead, I'll just wait for my Pre-order of Season 2 to come. :)) :D

To the Un-awakened, ""Old Fans"": If you haven't watched ""Hey Arnold!"" in a very long time (or not at all...), this'd be a good set to get addicted to, LOL. Hey Arnold! has some of the best humor, entertainment and wit that I've ever seen in ages. Some kinds of humor in other shows can get old, but Hey Arnold! is as entertaining watching it the 100th time or just the 1st time. I remember seeing this cartoon when I was younger (I was 9 when it first came out), but I didn't appreciate the humor and the writing enough until last year. I am 23 years old now! lol! If you haven't seen it recently, you don't know what you're missing!! :D

Just a warning... you might get as obsessed about HA! as Helga is to Arnold, himself! LOL!!!
Yes, it's that good! T_T!!! <3<3<3 XDD

Thank you so much, Nickelodeon! I look forward to the future volumes. Please consider finishing ""The Jungle Movie"" (and ""The Pataki's""? haha '), and accepting Craig Bartlett as a part of your team again. We would love to see you guys working together again. It's not just me.

Let me know if you guys have any extra questions.
Thanks for reading. ^_~

Grandpa always has advice and Grandma seems to be living in another world most of the time.

The story about a boy who was raised by his grandparents in a bordering house, in the city who has crazy friends and they have adventures. This DVD still has my favorite Hey Arnold Episode on it HAUNTED TRAIN!!! I think this is one of the best written Halloween specials and at the end you as the viewer find out that Grandpas story is true, but they don't see the train go by. I remember discussing this show with my buddies, how we'd have these adventures when we were in 4th grade. We could relate! Some of my favorite episodes from this set are Downtown as Fruits & Eugenes bike, and i want to say when me and my best friend from elementary school saw that episode we wanted to skip are play and go around town like that. However our parents happened to drive us to the play so we couldn't, the only other chance i had to do something like that was in 8th grade when me and my buddies found out that the gym was open and we didn't want to do our band concert, until a friend of ours threaten to tell.

I grew up on the cartoons of the 40's, 50's & 60's, which I find to be superior, but this kind of animation has adapted rather well. Can't seem to get the kind of animation of the prior era's anymore. Guess they are too time consuming to make or perhaps can't get the kind of artistry of the past. However, I do find these cartoons rather pleasant along with the characters and the subject matter.",1393977600,,484,4.388888888888889

4509791,4,B004ZKKL32,"OK, so this was the first seasons, and some of the animation and characterization annoys me, particularly with Helga, but don't let that put you off! There are several episodes in here that make the DVD a must-have. Here are my top five:
""Arnold's Hat"" - Probably not the first one to watch. Helga is particularly obsessive with her shrine of Arnold sculpted out of his used bubblegum and kissing the sculpture at one point, but it's a great episode. Helga gets Arnold's hat to put into her shrine, and Arnold becomes depressed without it. When Helga discovers that, her mom's thrown out her shrine and she has to go to the dump to find the hat.
""The Little Pink Book"" - Mainly a nostalgic favourite, being one of the first episodes I ever saw. Helga loses one of her poetry books on the bus just after she wrote an acrostic poem with her name, and Arnold and Gerald are the ones to pick it up and discover all of the Arnold love poems. They try to find out who wrote it while Helga tries to get it back before they read the page with her name on it. Again, Helga is still more obsessive than usual in this episode, but don't worry, she settles down more in later episodes on this disc and becomes less creepily-obsessive.
""Arnold's Christmas"" - A fan favourite. Arnold finds out that Mr Hyunh, a tenant at the boarding house, had to give up his daughter during a war around Christmas and came to America to find her, so Arnold tries to do everything he can to find her. What really makes this episode is Helga's change of heart about Christmas. At the beginning of the episode, she thinks Christmas is all about getting presents, but at the end, she gives up the one present she really wanted to give Arnold his Christmas miracle. Gerald even unwittingly refers to her as a ""Christmas angel"", and the ending, where Helga stands outside the boarding house and whispers ""Merry Christmas, Arnold"" is so touching.
""False Alarm"" - Eugene is accused of pulling the fire alarm and will be expelled if the jury of six classmates finds him guilty. Apart from the plothole when no one is expelled, the jury's interaction is very entertaining and the payoff when (SPOILER'S AHEAD) Curly confesses and explains his reasons is perfect, especially at the end when he laughs in a demented manner and admits to pulling the fire alarm to Principal Wartz, immediately doing it again. Probably one of the best things about this episode is it sets up Curly's position as the school psychopath.
""Arnold's Valentine"" - One of my all-time favourites. Arnold anonymously sends a message for Ruth McDougal to meet him at Chez Pierre that evening, while Helga writes in Arnold's letter from his French penpal that she is flying out from France for that one night and wants to meet him at Chez Paris, which is right across the street, planning to dress up as the penpal and have her first real date with Arnold. Honestly one of the best episodes for romance between Arnold and Helga, and also awkwardly funny when Helga makes mistakes in pretending to be a French girl and when Arnold admits openly that Helga ""bugs"" him. The best episode on the disc and worth every cent.

This DVD let's you relive all of your favorite memories of the iconic first season on Nickelodeon from the fall of 96. On this DVD the animation and music of Hillwood are brought to life once again. Hey Arnold! is a city life of solving problems with sometimes crazy circumstances all seen through a late childhood perspective.

Special features like an audio commentary or behind the scenes look at the show would have been nice but I still give Season 1 five stars for being so genuinely awesome.

PS. The Shout release DVD plays the episodes in production order rather than the order they aired on TV. It also has higher quality, a nice letterbox picture but nothing to stare at in awe like Hey Arnold HD.",1347321600,,898,4.403614457831325
4509821,5,B004ZKKL32,"I have been an avid Hey Arnold! fan since the first season premiered in 1996.

With approximately 100 top-notch episodes, Hey Arnold! has to be one of if not the best cartoon I have ever watched. I grew up in the 90's so I was privileged to watch this during my childhood. HA! has great character development, wonderful jazz music provided by Jim Lang, a nice urban setting that all can relate to, and lovable relationships between characters. It is also a show that many children and adults can learn from, as Arnold as an optimist helping out his neighborhood, friends, and family. I also love this show because it gives you a self connection to each character with their varying personalities (ie. Arnold and his positive attitude, Helga's anger and her misfit family, Gerald and his exciting mentality, Grandpa/Grandma with their strange antics, etc).
HA! is appropriate for all ages, including adults too! There are no foreign creatures, no mystical powers, no pop singing, no crude jokes; just a simple life revolving around a young boy named Arnold. Humor is also present throughout each episode including reoccurring gags.

I want to thank Craig Bartlett for creating such a great show and will be awaiting for the next several DVD releases from Shout! Factory!
11/10 stars

* SPOILER + long read *

First I'd like to state the the final episode was supposed to be ""The Journal"" but 4 more were created after it because Nickelodeon wanted a full 100 episodes.
The only flaw within this show is that the final episode of the 5th season (The Journal) left us on a cliffhanger. If you watched most of the episodes, you would understand why (I'll just keep it at: Arnold's parent's disappearance and Arnold/Helga relationship). If you're on the same boat as me, continue reading. From what I've read and heard, Craig was urged by Nickelodeon to create a second movie (The Jungle Movie) after the initial film. He had already written it, and it was in its 5th or 6th draft so he knows the whole plot inside out. Before completion with TJM drafts, Nickelodeon decided that Craig should make a prequel to TJM. This ended up being, ""The Journal"" where Arnold finds a journal written by his father, which describes Arnold's parent's meeting in San Lorenzo, Arnold's birth, his parent's reason for leaving, and their possible whereabouts. After ""The Journal"" was aired, Nickelodeon decided in their favor that HA! should be cancelled regardless of completion of TJM. Poor sales from the first movie is most likely Nick's motive to cancel the show, and this is probably because Lilo & Stitch was released during the same timeframe. ""The Journal"" ended with Arnold finding a map of San Lorenzo on the last page of his father's journal, showing his parent's possible location. Nick/Viacom currently owns the rights to Hey Arnold! so it is under their discretion to allow Craig finish ""The Jungle Movie"", yet they won't give him a chance due to several disagreements in the past.
After watching ""The Journal"" the whole show left me puzzled with several questions and possibilities. Where are his parent's whereabouts? Why didn't they come back within a week like they said in the last episode? Does Helga confess her true feelings to Arnold? How does Arnold react? What happens to all the other supporting characters?
Luckily, through chats and interviews, Craig was able to reveal some of the plot of ""The Jungle Movie"". However, it is not the same as watching the animation.

* MEGA SPOILER (... well not really) *

Arnold wins an essay contest which allows his whole class to plan a trip to San Lorenzo, with the Mr. Simmons and Principal Wartz tagging along. Through their journey in San Lorenzo, Arnold and Helga finally complete their conversation that was present during their kissing scene in the first movie. They find out that they were meant for each other and kiss again. Gerald interrupts them (CB!) and Arnold attempts to give him an excuse but Gerald acknowledges, ""Whatever you say"".
Yet, still no one knows what happened to Arnold's parents, Miles and Stella. There are currently storyboards and comics of TJM/6th season that HA! fans have made but nothing compares to the work done by Craig Bartlett. Only ""The Jungle Movie"" would be able to complete the story of Arnold's life.

To sum it up, I believe there is still a SLIGHT possibility that Nick would still come to agreements with Craig to publish ""The Jungle Movie"" film (if not, Craig may create a comic or book). It is up to HA! fans to push Nickelodeon by writing kind letters to their New York building displaying your affection for the series and in hopes for the real final ending.

4509832,5,B004ZKKL32,"The Video:
Hey Arnold! is one of those shows that almost everybody remembers. At a time when most Nickleodeon shows were unrealistic or childish, Hey Arnold! was a belivable show that many of us could relate to. For those of you that don't know, the show centers around a 4th grader named Arnold and deals with the many situations that he encounters. He has no parents and lives with his eccentric grandparents who are the owners of the Sunset Arms boarding house. Arnold goes to school at PS-118 with his many friends. There's Gerald who's Arnold's best friend and also a girl named Helga Pataki who pretends to dislike Arnold, but is secretly in love with him. This turns out to be a recurring theme throughout the series and Arnold never finds out. Most episodes deal with Arnold helping one of his friends over personal problems or Arnold trying to deal with one himself. The show was popular enough to span a full-length movie and still mantains a strong fanbase. Unfortunatly, Hey Arnold! was never given a true ending and was left on a cliffhanger that remains unresolved to this very day. A second movie, titled ""The Jungle Movie,"" was supposed to end the series, but was canceled due to problems with the shows' creator as well as the low gross of the first movie. A sixth season, as well as a sequel series was planned, but both never came to fruitation. Despite this, Hey Arnold! outlived many other Nicktoons and lasted eight years with 100 episodes.
After the show ended, many fans clamored for DVD release. In 2008, the first two seasons of the show were released exclusivly on Amazon.com as part of their ""CreateSpace"" program. However, I chose not to purchase those sets because they were expensive and not truely an ""official"" release. Finally, my wish came true when Shout! Factory released the first season officialy on DVD. For the first time ever, I was finally able to experince every single episode of the first season for the first time in years. And what great episodes there are. From hilarious episodes like ""24 Hours to Live"" to more emotional ones like ""Arnold's Christmas"" there's not a single weak episode to be found here. If you're a Hey Arnold! fan or just enjoy 90s Nicktoons, then I highly recommend you pick this set up.
Overall: 10/10

Video and Audio Presentation
The video picture on Hey Arnold! Season 1 is actually much better then I expected. Considering that these episodes are 15 years old, the show is noticably crisp and shows little cel dirt or artifacts on the transfers. While the animation may come off to some as a little bit muddled, it's exactly as I remeber it. The backrounds are simply gorgeous and the animation is fluid and lifelike. For an old 90s cartoon, the first season of Hey Arnold! doesn't disapoint. Unforutunatly, everything is presented in fullscreen so if you own a large TV, the show won't look nearly as good. As for audio, everything is good as well. All the performances are top notch and everyone is bound to have a favorite charcater because of this. My favorite is personally Grandpa. I should also talk about the jazz-influenced score by Jim Lang. During the 90s, most cartoon relied heavily on stock music, but Hey! Arnold was different. For the show, Jim Lang used many jazz instruments such as the sax, drums, and bass to create an original score. The results are simply beautiful. I would love for there to be some sort of physical release of the music someday, but I wouldn't hold my breath. There are no audio options on the DVD so if you're hard on hearing or don't speak English then there will likely be some problems. However, for the most part, everyone will probably be pleased with what they hear.
Overall: 8/10

Packaging and Extras
Hey Arnold! Season One comes in a transparent standard jewel case. The episodes are spread across four discs which are each housed in their own tray. There is one paper insert which advertises other Shout! Factory releases. The inside of the DVD (the other side of the cover) shows a list for which episodes are on what discs as well as artwork for each character. As for the extras, there is absolutly nothing. That's right. Zilch. Nada. Zero. This really isn't Shout! Factory's fault, but more of Nickleodeon's as they didn't offer them anything in the first place. Why not include the original pilot episode or put in some commentaries from the show's cast and crew? Right now, I'm not too angry about this. I'm just satisfied that we have this show on DVD to begin with. Just don't expect anything on other sets in the future.
Overall: 1/10

The Bottom Line
I really have to hand it to Shout! Factory. I never thought that this show would ever see the light of day again. Thankfully, I was proven wrong. Although it may have taken some time, the timing couldn't have been better. 2011 is Hey Arnold!'s 15th anniversary, so what better way is there to celebrate? Don't let the lack of extras on this set drive you away. This is the show that we have been waiting for for years. Although we may never see the ""Jungle Movie"" or anything else from the show, I couldn't be happier with this show finally being released on DVD. I highly recommend that you support Hey Arnold! buy purchasing this set up. Doing so will show Nickleodeon that Hey Arnold! is still a bankable franchise and might possibly make them change their minds on ""The Jungle Movie."" I just hope that Shout! Factory releases the other seasons soon. Highly Recommended.

4509833,5,B004ZKKL32,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE STANDARD, NON-MANUFACTURED ON DEMAND VERSION OF THE DVD. They may be the same; I do not know. I am reviewing only the version of the DVD released in August 2011 by Shout Factory.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For me, Hey Arnold! represents something of the end of an era. I watched the first 3 seasons of it on Nicktoons, but it was the last Nicktoons show I remember watching before I grew out of it. Thankfully, Shout Factory is taking the initiative and releasing classic shows like Hey Arnold, Rocko's Modern Life, and several others on DVD.

Hey Arnold! Season 1 debuted in 1996. This set includes 20 episodes, which is the full and complete first season. As far as I can tell, there is no censorship in the way that Rocko's Modern Life had some content edits for its first season.

The packaging consists of a clear plastic 4-disc case the same width as a standard DVD case. The front and spine are pictured above. The back has a red brick background with some screenshots. Most of the screenshots (3/5) are taken from the opening titles sequence. Inside is an ad for other Nicktoons shows that Shout Factory is producing. The reverse side of the cover has pictures of Arnold (reversed from the front cover), Gerald, Grandpa, and Helga. There is an episode list in 4 blocks separated by disc number. The red brick background from the back cover is re-used here as well. The same background and images appear on the 4 discs.

Each disc has 5 episodes, and almost every episode consists of two 11(ish) minute segments. These are self-contained stories for the most part. There are two single-story episodes, ""Arnold's Christmas"" and ""Arnold's Valentine."" Some of the more memorable episodes are ""Downtown as Fruits,"" ""Mugged,"" ""Magic Show,"" and ""24 Hours to Live.""

When you load the DVDs, there is the standard FBI warning and then a static menu with a picture of Arnold and a background showing an urban-style setting from the show. The music in the background plays over the credits for some of the episodes. It does not loop, so once it plays through once, it's finished.

The video quality is decent, though nothing special. It's as expected for a show of this nature. There is some grain and artifacting, probably present on the original animation cels. This is likely the same transfer that Nick uses for Nicktoons re-runs. While the video clearly has not been remastered in any appreciable way, it still looks good for what it is. (For this review, I watched a few episodes and spot checked all 4 discs using both a standard DVD player with A/V cables and an upconvert DVD player with an HDMI cable; I used a 32"" standard definition TV and a 32"" HD LCD TV for quality checks.)

The audio is a standard stereo mix. One thing that was interesting about this show is that it actually used kids of approximately the same age as their characters. I remember watching a short behind-the-scenes clip on Nick back in the late 1990s interviewing some of the cast. They basically do a good job with everything, but it's important to remember that since these are the early episodes of the show, they are not as strong as they were later on. A final note pertaining to audio is that there are NO CLOSED CAPTIONS, SUBTITLES, ETC. It's not relevant to me or the majority of the audience, but I like to check for it when I review DVDs as a courtesy for those who need them. It's odd because I know the show was closed captioned when it aired, so I can't figure out why that didn't get carried over.

I didn't deduct for it, but there are no extras in this set. It's a shame because there were at least a few things available that they could have used. I chose not to deduct for it solely because this product was released by Shout Factory. For those who are unaware, Shout Factory is probably the best in the nostalgic DVD business, and it's widely accepted that Shout goes to great lengths to acquire extras for their releases (for a good example, check out their 1980s Transformers DVD series). If there are none, it means that whoever licensed the show to them didn't offer anything. While that's a negative, Shout should still be commended for working to get this and other 90s nostalgic shows out on DVD.

For fans of Hey Arnold! who enjoyed watching the show after school and on weekends back in the late 1990s, this is a great release. It's got a solid collection of episodes, many of which are particularly memorable, and the presentation is fine. If you don't have that nostalgic connection to the show, it's perhaps a tougher sell. Kids would probably enjoy it; for adults, it lacks the humor of early 1990s shows like Rocko's Modern Life, Ren and Stimpy, and even Animaniacs. Then again, if you've read this review to this point, you likely do have those nostalgic memories of the show, and if that's the case, I'd strongly recommend picking up this release.",1313366400,2,4943,4.692041522491349
4509834,5,B004ZKKL32,"Hey Arnold is a Nickelodeon cartoon series that originally ran for five seasons from 1996 to 2004. This DVD box set from Shout Factory contains the first 20 episodes of the series.

The series was created by Craig Bartlett and depicts the life of title character Arnold and his interactions with his quirky classmates and bizarre neighbors in the large nameless city in which they all live.  It is well known for skillfully mixing comedy with some dramatic moments as well as for devoting at least an episode or two to even the most minor of characters throughout its run.  It also has a fantastic jazzy soundtrack.  The animation improved greatly over the 5 seasons of the series, and the first season is notably rougher than later seasons, but it is by no means bad, simply a product of its time.

This DVD is the general retail release of Season 1. This season was previously released as an Amazon exclusive Media on Demand (MOD) set burned to order and available for a relatively high price. The retail set has a much more professional feel to it, it comes packaged in a clear case with some nice art on the inside, as opposed to the standard issue black case that the previous release used. Additionally, the previous release had silent menus while this new set has the show's theme song playing in the background. The old set also had some compatibility issues related to the nature of the product; being burned on demand onto DVD-R discs led to complaints about the discs not being playable on certain players. While I personally never experienced that issue with any of the MOD sets, this new set should be free of those problems regardless.

This release contains NO extras whatsoever. Personally, this doesn't bother me as I usually use DVD extras once, at most. I understand that some people fully expect all DVDs to have extras, but for me, it just isn't that big of a problem. The episodes are here, and in the end that's what the fans have been waiting for. Overall, this is a quality release of the complete first season and overlooking the lack of anything but the episodes themselves fans should be happy to finally see this series come to DVD.

This is the fourth Nickelodeon release from Shout Factory, following the first seasons of The Wild Thornberrys, Rocko's Modern Life, and Hey Dude.  Several more are planned for the rest of the year, including The Angry Beavers Seasons 1 & 2, Danny Phantom Season 1, Aaahh!! Real Monsters Season 1, Catdog Season 1 Part 1 and The Wild Thornberrys Season 2 Part 1.  So far I feel like Shout Factory is doing a great job with these sets and I hope their partnership with Nickelodeon can continue for years to come.

Note: All five seasons of Hey Arnold were at one time available from Amazon. Those seasons are the older MOD releases, and seasons 2-5 have NOT been announced or released by Shout Factory. As of July 16, 2011 the older MOD releases have been discontinued, however they may still be available through third party sellers.

Additional Note:  Many of the reviews on this page refer to the old MOD release of season 1.  The episodes on this release are the same, however the reviews of the quality of the product itself seen here do not reflect this retail release.  I have written to Amazon requesting they remove the old reviews; they have not yet done so.",1312934400,7,3330,4.631578947368421

Thanks to Nickelodeon and Amazon for coming together to reunite Arnold with his biggest fans!  (All I need now is 'Daria' on DVD and I'll be fully content.)",1246060800,,672,4.558333333333334

The only improvement I could think of is adding more bonus features to the DVD. But other than that, I'm happy to add this to my collection. Thank you Nickelodeon and Amazon for putting this together!",1239148800,,373,4.420289855072464

4509854,5,B004ZKKL32,"** This review is for Hey Arnold Season 2 as well**

I've been waiting 10+ years for the day they would release Hey Arnold on dvd and now I finally have it. I've seen complaints from users saying that the dvd's didn't play or skip. I have NOT had any problems at all, they play perfectly with no skips or anything. I have a fairly new (2 years old) but not the best dvd player, its the Samsung dvd/vcr combo. The dvd's had some dust and marks on them from the manufacturing but that's it. There aren't any special features but I really don't care about that. The menus are plain yet very easy to navigate, only play all and episode selection. The quality is amazing, tv quality, 10/10, sound is amazing. Everything is PERFECT! Thank you Amazon and Nickelodeon for releasing these dvd's. I just wish the price was lower. $60+ for 2 seasons is quite steep but it was worth it.",1235692800,3,874,4.361963190184049
4509855,5,B004ZKKL32,"So as other people have expressed its fab that they released Hey Arnold for amazon to sell--- I wanted to give my penny's worth because I ordered it from the UK and wanted to confirm that it does work. I contacted Amazon for help--- they were incredibly helpful, Hey Arnold season 1 arrived a few weeks later and it works on my laptop (which actually rejects many of my UK dvds!) So all in all-- a great series, fantastic service from Amazon--- very happy customer ;)",1234569600,3,467,4.441860465116279
4509856,5,B004ZKKL32,HEY ARNOLD WAS A CHILDHOOD FAV OF MINE. I WAS EXCITED TO SEE THEY HAD SEASONS AVAILABLE. NOW I COULD SHARE THE EXPERIENCE WITH MY KIDS. THEY LOVE IT SO FAR. I RECOMMEND TO ANY FAMILY.,1234051200,,183,4.111111111111111
4509857,4,B004ZKKL32,"I have to say I am very happy with this product! Hey Arnold! is an increible show in it's own right and to finally have them available on dvd (thank you again Amazon!) is great. The dvd's themselves are good quality, though they jump straight to an episode menu once you insert them into a dvd player. But that's just a very minor gripe and does not detract from the enjoyability of this porduct. My only other real complaint is the total lack of any special features (deleted scenes, commentaries, etc.) But I say again, even though it would have been nice to have them, just having the episodes themselves available for purchase is more than enough for me. Everyone should be able to enjoy this wonderful and unique show, from die-hard fans who watched it when it was originally on the air, to newcomers who have may have missed out the first time around. In short, this is one show you owe it to yourself to check out! 5/5! Hey Arnold Rules! also does anyone at amazon know when you might be releasing the other seasons?",1233619200,,1023,4.475935828877005
4509858,4,B004ZKKL32,"A few of the episodes freeze up but the rest were fine, and I'm a big fan of the Series, so I put up with it.  Wish there were more seasons availabe besides season 1 & 2...",1233532800,,172,3.6486486486486487
4509859,5,B004ZKKL32,"I loved Hey Arnold! as a kid and have always wanted it on DVD.  After finding this on Amazon, I knew I had to buy it.  I was definitely not disappointed.  It took a little while to arrive, but once it did I sat down and watched the whole thing through.  Some of the best episodes are included in this season!  Stoop Kid... Pigeon Man... Arnold's Hat...All classics!
Strongly recommend.",1233273600,,385,4.442857142857143
4509860,5,B004ZKKL32,"The dvd movie quality is great. I read a couple reviews of them not playing in the dvd players... well, they worked on every dvd player in my house. All of my dvd players are within 2 years old, so i don't know why they didn't play in other users' players. The packaging is labeled DVD-R (which is standard production dvds). The only thing i did not really like about the product was; they are not officially Nickelodeon produced, Amazon has created them, the backs of the dvds are blue, like a cheap dvd you buy in bulk at a store. But the labeling looks decent.

Overall i rated the product 5 stars, I give props to Amazon for creating Hey Arnold, Rockos Modern Life and other Great Nick classics. Simply a must have to any dvd collection.",1233014400,,741,4.369565217391305
4509861,5,B004ZKKL32,"The continuance of Nickelodeon and Amazon.com's Video on Demand releases another show, Hey Arnold!  Created by Craig Bartlett (who is now a contributing writer on Jim Henson's Sid the Science Kid), Hey Arnold! was one of the last few and cool Nicktoons (along with The Angry Beavers, The Fairly OddParents and Spongebob Squarepants) to come out at the latter part of Nickelodeon's fame ""Golden Age"".

It was an interesting show because like Spongebob Squarepants, it has a lot of hidden content not only for kids, but also for teens and adults to laugh to.  Interesting characters and stories made the show a definite keeper for Nick.

Jim Lang's jazz score helped to round it out.  Even though the animation was a bit lackluster, for the real fans out there, you know that the later episodes (that were drawn overseas for Nickelodeon) were the better bunch, but I still gave it 5 stars because it was one of Nick's best shows.

Lord-willing, I hope that Nick and Amazon.com will finally release the last remaining episodes soon.

Looking forward to season 3 & 4, between the two of them I know one of the seasons has the episode of Arnold's Play (Romeo and Juliet, Helga finally kisses Arnold).  If you have any doubts about ordering Hey Arnold let me relieve you of that. Each episode and the sound is crisp and clear. You will be as pleased as I am.

The only fault I can find with the DVD is that the introduction to Hey Arnold only plays once at the beginning of each disc, instead of at the beginning of each 30 minute segment.

Hey Amazon, any way you can talk to Nickelodeon about putting together the ""As Told By Ginger series?""",1224028800,3,676,4.176923076923077

Now I only figured this out but I can't be wrong when I noticed when Doug season 1 and Hey Arnold season 1 both have this problem. During flashes of light(lightning) the DVD will skip for a second or too.

Least to say I was outraged. It was due to several factors. The delayed shipment, the price of the DVD, and me finding out the DVD skips and made me wonder about the craftmanship. Now, this would not be a problem if I got my order on time OR that the price was significantly lower. If I am only the person with this problem, then the product I received was low in quality.

8450027,5,B004ZKKL32,"This is the first season the best cartoon that I have ever watched. All the characters are amazing, the storylines are really cool, and the music is terrific. Everything about it is great. I especially love the friendship between Arnold and Gerald; Helga and are crush on Arnold, but I watch it for all the characters. There's the relationship between Helga and her older sister Olga, who is too much of a perfectionist and is very sensitive. There's Stinky, Sid, Phoebe, Rhonda, Harold, Eugene, etc who all go to P S 118. They have amazing teachers and a principal who is an unapologetic disciplinarian. In addition, most of the parents are cool (Helga's parents aren't very supportive). The postman is amazing, so is the butcher, the people who live with Arnold. And there's the ice-cream man. As an adult, I love watching Hey Arnold. If you love beautiful cartoons, give this a chance. You won't regret it. I highly recommend it to everyone.",1517788800,,944,4.7975460122699385
