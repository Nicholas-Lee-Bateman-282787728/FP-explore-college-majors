1809035,5,B00007G1V4,"While a huge star abroad, American-born Anastacia has had a hard time translating her international success into stateside success.  This despite the fact she's put out two very fine albums, both encompassing pop, funk, rock, and dance.  This companion DVD is a terrific visual overview of what the very fickle American listening audience is missing.  There's not a bad video in the bunch, though particularly good are ""Not That Kind"", ""I'm Outta Love"", ""One Day In Your Life""(the international mix), and ""You'll Never Be Alone"".  Among the extras are some interesting making-of segments, with the lengthy ""One Day In Your Life"" segment getting the bulk of the time. One thing that comes across in all the videos, though, is that this woman possesses a strong, magnetic vocal presence and visual energy that's being overlooked in favor of charisma-free non-singers like Britney Spears.  In the end, she may be too pop for American consumption, but then it wouldn't be the first time American audiences were way off the mark.",1044403200,,1024,5.071428571428571
1809036,5,B00007G1V4,"Anastacia was born in America. Anastacia was first seen on American MTV. Why in God's name has Anastacia remained so anonymous in the country that she calls home?
Plain and simple. She's different.
And different people are usually critically acclaimed, but have trouble finding lasting careers over on this side of the pond. Look at Macy Gray's career. Newcomer Norah Jones will probably be met with a similar fate.
Having been a fan of Anastacia for a long-time, I was estactic and shocked to find out that a DVD video collection had been put together. I've heard all of her songs, but I have only had a chance to put an image to one (""One Day In Your Life""). Sony did a great job providing PICTURE-AND-SOUND-PERFECT-QUALITY videos, as well as well-edited, humorous, and informative ""Making The Video""-esque documentaries.
In addition to that, the remix videos are great. The new takes on the songs are really good. As well as the biography, the ""Who's Anastacia"" short, which is only about four minutes long, but is very informative. Before today, Anastacia was a personality-less voice, now she is a living, breathing, vibrant performer in my eyes.",1041206400,15,1151,4.938144329896907
1809037,5,B00007G1V4,"I just recently was invited to listen to Anastacia's music and video and I have to say that Anastacia is the BOMB!  I have never heard anyone with such a powerful voice like hers.  She has truly been blessed with a beautiful voice and her personality fits her to a ""T"".  I hope that she will continue to gain more fans in the the Great State of USA.  Get Ready America Here Comes Anastacia!",1040688000,6,390,4.22972972972973
1809038,5,B00007G1V4,"It was such a treat to finally see what the rest of the world has seen all along.  As a long-time American fan of Anastacia, it was a thrill to get to see her videos and watch her progression as a visual artisit.  The videos are a pure delight, full of the energy, fun, and originality her music brings.  From the naturally energetic vibe of ""Outta Love"" to the heart breaking beauty of ""You'll Never Be Alone,"" Anastacia proves she is a unique and bright talent.
The bonus footage on this DVD is also completely wonderful.  Behind the scenes footage gives glimpses into the person that is Anastacia, highlighting her humor, humility, and pizazz!
Anyone who is a fan of Anastacia's music will not be disappointed with this collection.  Would I lie to you?",1040256000,4,755,4.604477611940299

7976131,5,B00007G1V4,"I recently bought this video collection, expecting it to be in the PAL format, but was shocked that there were NTSC versions of this video still available.  The videos I overall like the best are I'm Outta Love (her first single), Coyboys & Kisses, You'll Never Be Alone, & the international version of One Day in your Life, just because of the minor video clip, where the camera goes through the castle longer than in the US version, but I like the US version of One Day in your Life for the song.  The international version of One Day in your Life oversynthesizes the music & Anastacia's voice, which I have to give 2 stars for.

As for the extras, I wish it had some behind the scenes footage of of the videos from the Not That Kind album, especially the I'm Outta Love video.  At least there's a dance remix version of I'm Outta Love on the collection, which is what I first heard in a South Bend Indiana nightclub.

It does have the behind the scenes to One Day in your Life, Paid My Dues, Boom (wish that song would have been added to the Freak of Nature album (both the international & US versions, and only referring to the 1 CD set), You'll Never Be Alone, and Why'd You Lie to Me.  There's also a photo album, a brief bio on Anastacia, and more than I can remember.  I'm doing nthis review from work, and the DVD is at home.  Regardless, she has the talent, that unfortunately, american stations overall overlook in favor of Britney Spears, which have no talent, but the sound that the stations want for the quick buck.  But at least Europeans & Australians appreciate her talent, and believe she'll be a hit over there for years to come.  At least this American will followup on her music as long as she makes music.",1175472000,,1727,4.36875
7976132,5,B00007G1V4,"One word ""HOT"" she has all the hits. America needs to get with the progam, this is a good singer. The love we need to give her is long over due!",1141776000,,144,3.6774193548387095
7976133,4,B00007G1V4,"If we were still in the 60's or 70's...maybe the 80's, Anastacia would be big hit in the states; but not in the new millenium.  This video collection provides the clues as to why not.  She has the looks of the younger pop vixens dominating Top 40 in the US and can outsing all of them, but soul/pop music in the US is driven by style (sex-driven choreography and posing), not substance (top-notch vocals and production).  Therefore, a white soul singer who recalls Chaka Khan, Taylor Dayne, and the like can't hold a spot on our charts.  Fortunately for Ms. A., the rest of the world still appreciates a recording artist who can actually sing without promoting her wares with a collection of video lap dances.  Carry on, Anastacia, carry on.  I'm listening...and watching.",1118275200,6,772,4.723880597014926
7976134,5,B00007G1V4,"I purchased this video collection last year, I heard this exciting and beautiful voice through a friend. And all I needed was one song the realize that this was the sound I was looking for. I have this DVD and anyone who is looking for something new and fresh, do yourself a favor, buy all the Anastaica music you can.

In a period of generic copycat performers in music today, she restored my faith in music.s ability to be different and exciting.

Buy it you won't be dis-appointed.",1109635200,5,484,4.488636363636363
7976135,5,B00007G1V4,"You all just have to check out this cool DVD! It's packed with all her videos from the ""Not That Kind"" and ""Freak Of Nature"" abums and on the bonus section you can come along behind the scenes of the videos ""One Day In Your Life"", ""Boom"", ""Why D' You Lie To Me"" and ""You'll Never Be Alone"" and what you see is simply Anastacia as the cool, funny girl that she is and you feel that you really get to know her. She's natural and without any ""I'm a star, I'm a diva""-attitude and I got surprised how really down to earth she is. Another thing about this DVD is the awesome remix videos on the bonus section, I mean - they're HOT! Escpecially the Hex Hector video of ""I'm Outta Love"" which I've been drooling after since I saw it on a Top 20 Chart show on a norwegian channel three  years ago. And now I finally have it on DVD! I'm in heaven! lol And the Kerry Chandler remix video of ""Not That Kind"" is also cool, a really neat remix. This is truly a 100% Anastacia essential collection, not to be missed!",1097107200,9,1002,4.112244897959184
7976136,5,B00007G1V4,"Although she only has 2 albums (""Not that kind"" and ""Freak of nature""), this beautiful and very talented singer has broke all record sellings in Europe, selling 10 million copies with only 2 cd's in the market.
Her appearance in the U.S was last year and her only official single ""One day in your life"" bearly touched the charts. But the funny part is that everyone who listen one of her songs, simply loves it. The whole thing is that she doesn't have a big promotion on TV shows or radio stations.
This DVD includes her 10 video collection, with songs like ""I'm otta love love"" which was her first single. The song is very good, is a dance song such as ""Not that kind"", ""I was made for loving you"", ""One day in your life"" (Directed by Dave Meyers), ""Boom"" (the official song of the 2002 FIFA organization) and ""Why'd you lie to me"" that is a very good video.
You'll also find the video of the first single from ""freak of nature"", ""Paid my dues"" and finally you'll find the ballad videos from her songs ""Cowboys and kisses"" and ""You'll never be alone"".
With the special features, includes remixed videos, behind-the-scenes and a special about Anastacia, between others.",1050105600,28,1170,4.576190476190476
