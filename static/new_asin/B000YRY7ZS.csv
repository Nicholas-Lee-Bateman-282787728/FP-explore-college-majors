Other than that, there's not much else to say. But does anyone know who played Rebecca? She appears all too briefly at 9:10 of the DVD. Even IMDb couldn't identify her. This DVD has no listing telling us who played which character, which is typical of this cheapo product.
Also noteworthy is Cathee Shirriff as Kate, a lady who likes ladies. She makes her first appearance at 20:51.",1331942400,2,547,4.708333333333333
8233994,3,B000YRY7ZS,I like Connie Sellecca a lot. So I've bought this one and I would buy it again. The movie was a pleasent surprise. It's quite fun even though the plot is somewhat familiar. Ten little models and then there were nine. However picture quality of this DVD is about the worst I've seen. It looks like a 4th generation VHS copy and I'm not exagerating.,1205625600,5,347,4.3538461538461535
