7957290,2,B00005YWJZ,"My gradkids, four years old, are really interested in the band thing, which is why I purchased the dvd.  I was mildly disappointed because it focused less on the band and more on the star ( Dave) and his silly antics.  I believe, however, that this is the only video of its kind that it available.",1200009600,2,297,4.285714285714286
7957291,4,B00005YWJZ,My 2 year old grandson loves this DVD.  He watched it 5 times the 1st day it arrived.  He loves marching bands & found this to be entertaining.  I'm certain he learned from it as well.  We both highly recommend it & plan to buy others in the series.,1165536000,,249,4.020408163265306
7957292,4,B00005YWJZ,My son and I have been watching this video every afternoon for the past two weeks.  It is amazing to watch how memorized my 4 year old is as he listens to Dave's funny comments.  Once I even caught him marching around the living room with Dave and the rest of the marching band.  I suggest this title for anyone looking to have their child get involved in music at an early age.,1018569600,9,378,4.1506849315068495
