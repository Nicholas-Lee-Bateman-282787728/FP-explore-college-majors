4830644,5,B005LW489G,"Missed this a few months ago when it was on Cartoon Network, so had to pick it up for my 2 and 5 year old.  We love all of the Lego video games, so this was a big hit.  The main part of the story involves some padawans that Yoda leaves with C3-P0 (not a good idea) who get into trouble and end up on Tatooine.  Even though it is only 22 minutes long, there are many inside jokes that older fans will appreciate (Vader cameo appearance).  It comes with both the Blu-ray and DVD versions which is nice.  Definitely recommend for fans of Star Wars who have Padawans of their own!",1316217600,22,576,4.107142857142857
4830645,5,B005LW489G,"Most of this content is out there on the internet already, but wally world had it on special with the launch of the blu-ray movies today so I picked it up. The main film is 22 minutes long and looks great on Blu-ray. It is well done and very funny. My 5 year old daughter, 7 year old son (big lego fan), and myself all watched it and loved it. There are 4 shorts included with two (bombad bounty and the quest for R2) I thought slightly better then the two part very short history of star wars. All the shorts were great though. Most of the lego star wars universe is shown, with so much more created just for this film. there is also a 5th bonus feature doen animated comic style that isn't done at the same high definition as the main movie and 4 lego based trailers. this does add a few more minutes of content and despite being of a lower visual quality, my son still liked it.

It comes with both the blu-ray disk, which I mentioned looks great, and the regular DVD. Which is good because my son has access to a dvd player so he can watch that one at his leisure now, while the blu-ray stays a bit safer. Yes there is a noticeable difference between the two visually, but the DVD version looks good on a flat screen as well. The set also includes a figure of a young Han Solo which my son is working hard tonight on homework to earn.

All in all not a bad package for the sale price despite their only being about 30-35 minutes of total content. My son will milk several hours (if not days) out of it half hour or not. If you are on the fence and either love star wars, love legos, or love both my vote is to pick it up if you can get it for the intro pricing.

Edit: Son has watched it 6 times since we picked it up two days ago. He would watch it more if we would let him. I've watched it twice and this may be sacriledge but am actually glad I picked this up over the blu-rays as the content here is new (to me), very funny, well done, and has tons of cameos. I actually rate this higher then the robot chicken short movies or the family guys ones.  Anyways still rate this a buy, just be wary of the high prices floating around on the internet. I picked it up for about a 1/3 of the price of the blu-ray 3 pack of movies on release, which I think is fair.",1316131200,10,2264,4.013303769401331

They're little gems that I wasn't previously aware of.  They have all of my favorite characters with their familiar personalities, yet they poke fun at them as well.  They're equally fun for children and adults with inside jokes (a LEGO George Lucas stops by to chastise Darth Vader, Jar Jar Binks gets blown up, etc.).

After watching the LEGO Batman movie, though, I was surprised that this Star Wars LEGO ""movie"" was only 22 minutes.  However, if you watch all of the extras, you get about an hour's worth of programming, so it's still worth the price.  The extra animated shorts with Star Wars LEGO characters are equally entertaining.  There are two ""Star Wars in 2 Minutes"" shorts.  One squeezes the first trilogy into 2 minutes, and the second squeezes the second trilogy into 2 minutes.  Also included are ""The Quest for R2-D2"" and ""Bombad Bounty"" animated shorts.  The second features everyone's favorite love-him-or-hate-him Gungan, Jar Jar Binks, being chased by Boba Fett.

I do not recommend purchasing the Blu-Ray + DVD with digital version, i.e. VUDU.  The VUDU version is terrible and worthless! I've purchased several movies with VUDU versions included.  They are cumbersome to use and are nothing like Amazon Instant Video, iTunes, or Hulu.  I recommend NOT purchasing any movie with a VUDU version.  The voting power of your $$$ will put VUDU out of business.  Then we will get useful digital versions with our movie purchases.",1371686400,,519,4.908045977011494

Whomever mastered this and set up the on-disc layout should go back to Blu-Ray mastering school.

To us, it's worth the price. And, my little girl who is 6 has watched it 5-6 times already. So cute. I love that she loves lego, and Star Wars.

When I bought it it was 20 dollars and I was expecting a feature length piece. So I put in the movie, changed a load of laundry, and when I got back my son was complaining that he wanted to watch it again. I thought something was wrong with the disk. So I checked the box more carefully and Viola! I see that the video is extremely short.

  I know when it comes down to it, it is my fault for not reading the fine print on the box before hand, but I think now that the DVD was a ripoff. What is there is well done, but for ONE Spongebob length short, that's waaay too expensive and misleading.

  The good news is that you will like the few minutes you get.

  As a parent, you know how many times your kids can watch a DVD over and over, so when you compress the time between viewings to 12 minutes you quickly want to chuck the DVD and the box out the window because you know every line of dialogue and every scene by heart.
