2638637,4,B000HKEWHU,"Malle explains in the interview excerpt included on the Criterion release that BLACK MOON is not about plot. It is about capturing moods and tones through various cinematic devices. It is about the unusual characters and situations. They provide the anchors for the film. Malle shoots his film as though it were a dream. Everything is very ambiguous and strange. There's not much I can say about this film that will do it justice, you just have to see it. I didn't know quite what to make of it after my first viewing, I just let it sink for a few days. I'm still not sure how I feel, but I'm glad I had the experience. You just have to let it wash over you. It's very slow and there's usually not much going on in the soundtrack except for ambiance and mumbling. It feels like an early David Lynch film produced by Alejandro Jodorowsky. You will either hate it or it will intrigue you. Either way, if you're a fan of surreal cinema, this is definitely worth a watch.",1309478400,17,967,4.377777777777778
2638638,3,B000HKEWHU,"The movie is often played on a cable station usually after 9pm, and for good reason, I guess. Black Moon is a quiet movie, but its almost like watching a trainwreck. Once you start watching, you cant take your eyes off. And you don't really feel compelled to watch it again because its almost frightening. There is very little dailogue in the movie. Now, I'm not sure, but here is what I think this movie is about: Picture a post-apocolyptic, war-in-progress, war-torn country-any country will do for the purpose of decribing this movie. In your wildest imagination, picture animals that can speak, imp-like nude children running across the countryside chasing pigs, and unicorns actually do exist. All of the scenes have something about them that are flip-flop and the writer's attempt to depict their idea of of what the ""end of the world"" would be like. You know, when all of the ""good"" forces are removed from the earth and all of the ""bad"" forces are completely in contol of everything. For instance, all through the film you find large, rogue forces of female military troops being killed by each other and  the very few male troops that are left at this point in time; probably for defecting or being traitors or something. Then, you have these very beautiful young people who are male/female twins that don't speak, yet they sing songs from Tristan and Isolde. Now these examples are not even the tip of the iceberg for what goes on in this film. And I am sure that I have missed something because I was able to pick up on only some of the subtle points here, but that is the only way that I can explain the odd complexities of this film. I watched it twice, the first time because there wasn't anything else on. The second time was to try to catch what I missed the first time, and after that I gave up trying to decide why a large rodent should have the ability to speak. But this is a very bizarre film with a very shocking and somewhat sad ending. Anyway with all of that being said, if you are a TV viewer who really appreciates very odd and bizarre movies, then this one is for you! However, if you are faint of heart, superstitious, and are confused and thrown off by something that is completely beyond some the most horrible things you can imagine, then try to avoid watching this movie!",1201219200,22,2304,4.525179856115108
2638639,3,B000HKEWHU,"if there is a paradox in time dealing with films  , this is it.this film was made in 1974 and truley competes with filmography (and comparison)of later films made in the style of lynch and the mix of early argento.watching movies is kind of an escape for some . this movie is an escape from reality . imagine ---david lynch (on acid) reading ""alice in wonderland"" with ""pink floyd-the wall ""movie playing on tv in the background  , he falls asleep for 2 days , wakes up  ,then writes a script for a film. this is the scenario i felt while watching this.(mind you i saw this film on cable a week ago before reading the other two reviews ,pertaining to the ""alice in wonderland "" quote from a reviewer).anyway----this was such an odd movie i felt like writing a review on it. if you watch closely there are a couple of scenes where the main actress ,(who is a natural beauty ) rants on to herself outloud from madness ,is so dementedly comedic, is just mindblowing.highly recommended film for that great escape into the wild unknown.",1179187200,11,1031,4.502673796791444
2638640,3,B000HKEWHU,"I saw this movie on cable, thinking it would be about ""a girl who runs from warring forces in a futristic country,"" or so that's what the cable description said. However, this movie is nothing about that.  This movie is about what happens when an LSD factory explodes and Angel Dust floods the atmosphere.  What happens from this catastrophe is now armies are filled with hot chicks who are in a civil war and men who where makeup and look like ""that 70's Show"" rejects.  Please note: this is my explanation for the wierd behavior that happens throughout this movie, and you never actually see an LSD factory explode, unfortunately.

This movie makes absolutely no sense, so don't try to make sense of it.  What I suggest, is that if you ever see this film, watch it for the shock value.  Watch it to see an old lady suckling two teen women for nourishment, and then an animal. Watch it to see one of the teens get molested by a snake. This movie is too much shock and too little substance.  Not much nudity, and the nudity you see, is not sexual in nature, but rather very disturbing.",1167696000,10,1085,4.44949494949495
2638641,5,B000HKEWHU,"This is possibly one of the strangest, oddest, weirdest, wackiest, confusing and all around twisted little movie. It's the future and it's war between the sexes, females hate men and men hate women (Isnt that today). They fight and kill each other. You're introduced to your main character named Lily, a young girl who comes upon a compound, a house, which has interesting characters and interesting moments of confusion and a twisted concept of a fairytale type setting.

Lily first discovers a pig with a bunch of naked children walking down the path. Then she finds a pig sitting in a highchair that talks to her. Then an old elderly woman in her bed talking to a rat and the rat seems to be having an argument with the old woman. Right then you should know what you're getting into. This is a very odd and in the since, almost like an art-house, confusion of imagery and a deep dark trip down the rabbit hole. Alice finding herself in Wonderland. That's what I feel this movie reminds me of, a basic concept of a mirror image world with strangeness.

Lily then meets a young man on the compound played by the wonderful Joe Dallesandro who talks through his mind and Lily seems to understand. His name is also Lily and he has a sister also named Lily. The sister breast-feeds the elderly woman in the bed upstairs that young Lily thought was dead.

This is a masterpiece of imagery. A masterpiece of confusion. A masterpiece of strange scenarios and an all-around twisted example of a fairytale. The subconscious nightmare or dream like state, comes to life on screen. The imagery and the situations and scenarios is something so hard to explain unless you've seen it.

I have always been a huge fan of Joe Dallesandro. He is such a beautiful man and is an iconic pop culture character. A true male sex symbol of the underground film movement.

The elderly woman after coming back to life and getting nourishment through being breast-fed, can communicate and talk through a dialect that is not understandable and also can communication with animals.

This is ultimately a very unique and very original mind screw of a film. A true Avant-garde dreamscape. Directed by the amazing one-of-a-kind brilliant and awesome legendary director Louis Malle. He crafted something that defies explanation. A film that the very mind is dumbfounded when experiencing it. He was truly a master director that sadly passed away at the very young age of 63, but his talent continues to shine as long as you can experience his films. He created another one of my favorite films of all time, one of my top 20, 1971's Murmur of the Heart. Also crafted his mastery talent in masterpieces of film such as 1974's Lacombe, Lucien, 1981's My Dinner with Andre. The tour-de-force masterpiece 1987's Au Revoir Les Enfants. Interesting to note he was married to Murphy Brown a.k.a. Candice Bergen. He was a master, writer, director and gifted visionary.

2638643,3,B000HKEWHU,"Let me say that if you are a fan of surrealism and like movies with ambiguous rather than neatly packaged endings, Black Moon is for you. To me, it was riveting and made sense in a strange, dream-logic kind of way.  The film follows the journey of a young woman who is fleeing a bizarre war: men and women are apparently battling each other.  She drives her car through a seemingly endless landscape of lush green forests and country roads, occasionally encountering  enemy troops or mangled corpses.  Finally, she finds a sanctuary: a farmhouse set deep in a clearing in the woods.  It is here that all everyday logic vanishes and she is caught up in a bewildering world of talking animals (including a unicorn),  apparently shifting rooms, and a quiet, hard-working brother/sister team who both claim that they are named Lily, as she is.

Much of the film`s weirdness, however, emanates from the farm`s matriarch: a gruff, bed-ridden person who alternately harasses Lily  verbally and seems to be attracted to her.  News of the outside world`s war drifts in through an old-fashioned radio: the older lady also uses it to speak with a mysterious correspondent.  Much as in a dream, the house`s lay-out seems confusing. Sometimes doors that appear locked are not, and vice versa.  Taboos are non-existent, as both the matriarchal woman and her son desire Lily, who is not very surprised by this.  She is startled by the apparent sentiency of some of the animals, though. The  appealing, pony-like unicorn talks to her, while a large rat chats with the old lady.

I have no idea what any of this means...one theory could be that this is all a confused dream of Lily`s, one which has to do with issues she is working out, issues mainly to do with growing up and maturity. That could explain why the farm siblings bear her name. They are possibly different aspects of her true self, the stoic sister opposed to the warm and friendly brother.  Then again, maybe director Louis Malle and the writers just wanted to explore a bunch of random surreal images, like Max Ernst did in his collages.  Either way, the movie definitely keeps you entertained if you`re in the mood for something weird and unusual.",1411862400,2,2198,4.759894459102902
2638644,4,B000HKEWHU,"The surrealistic mood of this film must be watched as a bitter metaphor. If it's true Carlos Saura paid his tribute to Buuel with Peppermint Frappe, Malle makes the surrealism according his own rules. You should not forget a curious film Zazie dans le metro(1960), that preserves the candidness through the eyes of a child.

On the other hand, the promised land had been explored by Nicholas Roeg in 1971 with Walkabout, a cult film for many. But there's more, the homage to Buuel (L'age d'or) and Bergman (Cries and whispers). Once you watch it you'll know why I make this statement.

Don't search a rational meaning. It's filled of smart symbols. A real pleasure for those who love aesthetics and the semiotic in the cinema.",1410912000,,726,4.753968253968254
2638645,5,B000HKEWHU,"This film immerses you in a dream of melancholic beauty.  Have you ever been out in the woods at dusk or dawn?  During these times--the interfecess between day and night--strange animal noises can be heard, and there is a slight breeze which shivers the trees in the dim light.

This film begins with the heroine driving through the lonely countryside in such an atmosphere.  The car strays from the path, and she is cast into a dreamy realm of beauty and sadness, rife with symbols that dig up forgotten memories of childhood.  By the time the film is over, you will feel transformed--strange recollections will flow back to you like blood from a reopened wound.  You will wonder:

""So many days have passed since I first set out on my journey which strayed from the path.  Now here I am, at the same point. What has changed?""

And you'll want to revisit those old woods for yourself.",1399939200,6,885,4.585987261146497
2638646,4,B000HKEWHU,"Unsurprisingly, Barbara Gordon related in Jennifer Fever that gay men have a preference for young men, but surprisingly lesbians don't have a preference for young women. And I wrote in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Allure-of-Nymphets/dp/B00B6KKY1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Allure of Nymphets</a>that the only thing that a man likes more than a nymphet are two nymphets.

However, a number of straight men have a preference for a genre of adult films that features teens with middle-aged women. The popularity of the genre may be due to the fact that the contrast in ages highlights the age of the younger women. The contrast appears to make the teens look even younger i.e., more attractive.

Black Moon (1975) is a fantasy film that was written and directed by Louis Malle. (The French born filmmaker directed the very controversial Pretty Baby (1978) as well.) In Black Moon, among other strange occurrences, 15-year-old cleavage revealing Lily Cathryn Harrison) chases a talking unicorn around the grounds of a 200-year-old manor house in France. (The house belongs to Malle.)

When Malle was asked to describe Black Moon he said, ""I don't know how to describe Black Moon because it's a strange melange - if you want, it's a mythological fairy-tale [ la Alice in Wonderland]  taking place in the near future.""

What is clear in the film is that Malle knows how to take advantage of the allure of a nymphet. Malle teases the viewer with Lisa's cleavage for over an hour before he has the nymphet unbutton the few remaining buttons of her white cotton shirt, wipe her ""chest"" clean with a dampened cotton ball, and consolingly ""breastfeeds"" the Old Lady (Thrse Giehse). Unsurprisingly, Black Moon was the winner of two French Csar Awards.

Note: The age of consent in France is 15 and since Cathryn Harrison's topless scene was shown in a non-sexual context, it was legal based on secular law. Although, what is considered to be non-sexual is subjective and sometimes the authorities disagree with artists.",1395532800,5,2062,5.290519877675841

2638657,3,B000HKEWHU,"[BLACK MOON - 1975 - Directed by Louis Malle - Widescreen] Black Moon is a non-narrative Freudian tale of adolescent sexuality (?) apparently set in a postapocalyptic world of men against women, shifting identities and talking animals that make more sense than their human counterparts. It is Malle's most experimental film and an irritating cinematic daydream like no other. Is this a good thing? I don't believe so. He's treading on Luis Bunuel's turf, but clearly is in over his head. Even his interview in the bonus features shows how uncomfortable he is discussing the film, refusing to elucidate on elements that border on incomprehensible within the film, never making eye contact with the camera, his posture and body language as defensive as someone in a police video interrogation we are soon to find guilty of a crime.

As someone who has seen almost every Malle film and is a professed fan, I was excited about seeing this one, but midstream, I realized I was in for a huge letdown, and by the film's end, I was flabbergasted seeing the final scene approaching, the outcome of which would leave me perplexed, pissed, and feeling cinematically cheated by a good friend. There's more to be said about this film and the director's effort, but I simply cannot bring myself to care enough to do so - it might only succeed in making you want to see this flick and, unless you're a completist or a cinema sadist, what's the point? It seems most directors hit a wall at some point during the 70's for a variety of reasons we don't have time to delve into here. What could have been Lewis Carroll by way of Luis Bunuel as seen through the eyes of Louis Malle ends up a non-narrative mess that's not even character driven with little plot, no development or back-story, no emotional content and no ending. Sure, as arthouse junkies we can ruminate on this or that to make believe that there's something deeper there when in fact there probably isn't, so let's call it a day and declare it for what it probably is - Malle's most disappointing work, but one that pushed him into another chapter in his dynamic career during the 80's and beyond. So maybe we have this morsel of manna to be grateful for, in spite of the overarching 'Black Moon' that hangs above us when we indulge in this convoluted overindulgence. All great artists falter from time to time... but that doesn't diminish their greatness if they can rekindle the fire that made them memorable in the first place.",1323561600,9,2477,4.681192660550459

I really wish this wasn't the case, but it was so hard to sit through.  The actors didn't know what to do and I don't blame them.

2638659,1,B000HKEWHU,"The nice thing about throwing a random series of events into a movie is that the viewer can selectively choose which events are connected and in what way. So I found a little ""Alice in Wonderland""; a little Dali surrealism; a little Warhol; a little sexual Freud; a little paganism; a little Jungian dream reality; a little nihilism; a little symbolism; a little film noir; a little Existential pointlessness; a little ...

The problem is when you try to blend too many pigments at once you end up with a black hole; or, conversely, if you try to blend too many colours of light you end up with a white washout. So either way it was just a black hole or a washout film of random events. Oh, no black moons - symbolically or otherwise.

This is definitely one of those.  I always appreciate the come-on wording and ""not rated"" listing for whether or not the film has violence, language, nudity, or suggestive situations.  This film, ""Black Moon: The Criterion Collection"" lists as its main star an actress (typically a signal flare for skin), and has the word ""evocatively"" in the description.  Let me be frank.  There are parts of this film that are absolutely repelling to any sane, moral human being, there are parts that are uniquely entertaining (few and far between), and start to finish you never understand a single thing.  It was filmed using French as the language, dubbed in English, and yet difficult to hear what little is spoken so I activated the English subtitles (use ""on"") and what little intelligible English you CAN decipher audibly doesn't match the English subtitles.  The farmhouse itself is intriguing, and so I watched the extra features included interview with the film maker himself, who says ultimately that he doesn't need to explain what he was trying to say in the making of this film.  Myself having over 140 college credit hours, I consider myself somewhat educated; however I am not a connoisseur of the surreal, or even necessarily of foreign films.  I bought and viewed this film because I wanted something different.  I definitely got something different.  I cannot recommend this film and try as I might, barely was able to admit having viewed it.  Beware the association of Alice down the rabbit hole, because it is the viewer who ends up in Wonderland.  I can't imagine giving this movie a five star rating if you live anywhere in America; yet if you live in any part of France, Germany, Great Britain, Sweden, Australia, or especially some third world country ravaged by war and confusion as day-to-day life becomes a struggle against all odds, then this film might have more of a message.  I was as troubled by viewing this film as I have ever been by watching documentaries about the Spanish Inquisition.  I would be remiss if I didn't also point out, this is one of those DVD's that merits a fraction of a star.  Capice?  Comprenez-vous?  Verstehen Sie?  Usted entiende?

8140191,5,B000HKEWHU,"It seems most reviewers, amateur and professional, have found Black Moon to be very odd and lacking a central meaning. Yet, the movie made a lot of sense to me, which may say more about me than the movie, but Ill give my take on it anyway. The war between the sexes is symbolic of all human conflicts and the primary cause is our war against nature. The opening scene Lily, wearing a mans hat and coat for cover, runs over a badger. Then she encounters male soldiers massacring a group of female prisoners. Once they figure out that she is female, she drives away to escape, not on the man made road, but into the countryside. She gets out and finds a group of sheep and a man hanging from a tree. A suicide? A murder? Did the sheep kill their master? The sheep turn on Lily and she flees on foot, abandoning her car and the mans coat, through the woods. She is more feminine and getting closer to nature. She encounters a snake, a millipede and finally a beetle on her face. She fears these creatures, but are they reaching out to her? She first sees the unicorn. She peruses it and finds the farmhouse. Now things really get weird.

She finds a glass of milk and drinks it. The close up of this makes clear it is not a trivial fact. The old woman talks to her rat friend. She is in touch with the animal world. She reports to some mysterious other on a special radio set. She makes a special note when Lily eats a piece of cheese. Later we learn that the old woman is breast fed by her daughter! Milk and cheese are foods that do not take away from nature.

There is another bizarre scene. The old womans son kills an eagle with a sword and this causes a brutal battle between him and his sister. So, it is again the killing of an animal that is the origin of human conflict. Lily is beginning to understand this. She breast feeds the old woman and later sleeps in her bed. When a snake slithers up her leg, she is not afraid of it. (This scene is very sensual and Lilys sexual awakening is another sub-theme.) This is a reversal of the Garden of Eden story. We must reconnect with nature. When she wakes up the unicorn is there. Earlier the unicorn had lectured Lily on how rude she was to living things. But now Lily offers to breast feed the unicorn. Bizarre yes, but it parallels the opening scene were the badger was killed, but now Lily will give back to the natural world and be one with it.",1451347200,,2400,4.237991266375546
