8652453,5,B00004VY29,"Technical Notes: The DVD is region specific, so make sure you have a digital solution or an appropriate all-region player.

Cool Jean-Paul Belmondo film from the mid-70s.  A reasonable compelling story, but nothing earth-shattering.  I just enjoyed soaking up the B-roll footage from Paris and seeing Belmondo in his prime.",1510704000,,323,5.42
8652454,4,B00004VY29,"The product was found to be just as it was advertised.  It has vocal audio both in French and English and arrived here in southern India by air mail well within the time frame specified.  No complaints; this D.V.D. is for European region, so make sure you have a player that plays all region D.V.D.'s.  However, I wish they had a customer option for despatching by registered post to foreign countries where the mail system may not be 100% reliable.  Of course, that may cost more by way of postage, which already is charged more than the product itself.

Good detective thriller film from the good ol' days.  Enjoyed it!",1352246400,,621,4.6
