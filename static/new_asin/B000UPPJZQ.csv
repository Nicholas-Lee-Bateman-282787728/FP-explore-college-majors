8214299,5,B000UPPJZQ,"Brother Roger, who died at the age of 90 in August, 2005, founded the Taize monastery in France in 1940, in the midst of world war two.  Dedicated to peace and reconciliation among peoples of the world, it is an intentionally ecumenical place, and has become over the decades of its existence a pilgrimage site of great spiritual power and popularity, rivalling any medieval pilgrimage site in its power to draw people, particularly young people, to its centre.

This is a half-hour documentary about the place and the people that make up the Taize community.  The monks who live there are committed to community, daily prayer, reflection, chastity and poverty.

The video features the community and its work more so than any particular individual, including Brother Roger.  It does feature him in interview, discussing the reasons why he founded the community.  It also features other brothers, of different faith traditions, who speak of the present-day mission of Taize, one that will carry on now in Brother Roger's absence - his spirit is strong in this place, as can be seen on the video, and his dream will remain alive.

'People' magazine once wrote, 'Taiz has become a magnet especially for young people, whose presence at times make the village look like a sanctified Woodstock.'  Nestled in the region of Burgundy, France, it fits both medieval pilgrimage and modern day event types of settings.

One professional review called this a visual poem, and the film is the recipient of the prestigious Cine Golden Eagle Award.  This film is actually part of a series of 'Journey' films produced by the group that highlight different kinds of journeys, physical and spiritual, of different traditions and cultures around the world.",1124323200,8,1736,5.038461538461538
