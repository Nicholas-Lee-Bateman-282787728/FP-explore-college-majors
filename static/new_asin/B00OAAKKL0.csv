6731299,4,B00OAAKKL0,"According to me, this is a Fleming/Thielemann show. The other main members of the star cast of Koch and Damrau I am afraid do not really do justice to their roles in either acting or singing. Koch looks strained throughout, and Damrau strains while singing. This is especially evident in the Trio wherein only Fleming's acting and singing saves the day. I am for once, really impressed with the Thielemann conducting... Critics like me, of Thielemann will understand exactly why. He has followed the singers well and brought out velvet from the Orchestra. Oh yes, the tiny part given to Kauffman is cute and he pulls it off well. Hawlata's portrayal of Ochs however, is as crude as it SHOULD be, and I have no complaints about that, although the even more rustic Kurt Rydel does much better in the recording I wish to compare this with below....

I have no real problem with updating of the period, as the Opera can stand at least that much.

I am tempted to compare this with the 'other' blu ray recording of this, Starring Anne Schwanewilms, Kurt Rydl, Oliver Ringelhahn, (Dresden/Luisi). They upped the period by another 50 years or so in that, and that really rankles a bit with cameras with flashes etc. But on the whole, barring Fleming, the singing in that one is a tad superior to this one, plus, the production brings out sensuousness overtly that is slightly underplayed in this Fleming version. No real complaints about that either.... Of the two, Fleming is the more convincing Marschallin... especially her portrayal of the character when alone with Octavian and when with others... the contrast is one that only a mature actor like her who seems to have got into the spirit of Marschallin can really bring out both in acting as well as singing...Kudos Renee

All said and done, Fleming has recorded this for posterity at the absolutely right age, acted beautifully and sung brilliantly.",1324425600,13,1900,4.804281345565749

8682907,5,B00OAAKKL0,"This is a wonderful production of Der Rosenkavalier from the 2014 Salzburg Festival, with Fanz Welser-Mst leading an elegant and spirited Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra and near perfect cast.  The very inventive, stylish and appealing new staging moves the time period from 1740 Vienna to the time of the opera's composition in the early 20th century. There is nothing bizarre or out-of-place in this concept, and it has allowed director Harry Kupfer to add some quite interesting and original elements, but still at home in Viennese elegance.

Bulgarian soprano Krassimira Stoyanova is a dream Marschallin, regal and in glorious voice, with a finely nuanced  portrayal.  Her Octavian, Sophie Koch, is a good vocal match.
Mojca Erdmann, while looking like the perfect image of Sophie, I found to have too light a voice, in the soubrette manner.  But these three do form a thrilling trio at the end.
The Baron Ochs, here much younger than usual, and near the age of Strauss's conception, is virile and handsome, and played with the energy and a depth of acting beyond the typical lecherous old bore.  Austrian bass Gnther Groissbck becomes one of the highlights.

This production restores all the usual cuts, which can make some scenes feel a bit longer than desired.  But it remains a glorious event, in HD and with 5.0 surround-sound.",1440115200,4,1334,5.031818181818182

8682909,3,B00OAAKKL0,"Director Harry Kupfer is known for being provocative, and so it was surprising that more than one dispatch from Salzburg's 2014 Der Rosenkavalier devoted most of its attention to praising conductor Franz Welser-Mst and the Vienna Philharmonic. Andrew Clark, writing for the Financial Times, even reported they made ""the score sound like a three-hour symphonic poem with voices"" in spite of ""the dull, soporific staging."" The Vienna Philharmonic -- with changing personnel, of course -- has been playing Rosenkavalier for more than 100 years, and Welser-Mst drives this fine-tuned machine as though he's trying to break Carlos Kleiber's 1979 land speed mark. What the liner notes describe as ""the ejaculatory spasms"" of the horn section in the prelude are delivered with amazing virtuosity. But even the vaunted Vienna Philharmonic barely keeps up with the molto allegro Welser-Mst launches for Act II, and the conductor produces the quickest final Trio I can find on record.

In C Major's Blu-ray release, however, there is a stage production going on behind the orchestra, even if it's more puzzling than successful.

The icy look of Act I is matched by the cool detachment that separates this Marschallin and her boy. Krassimira Stoyanova and Sophie Koch sing of passion, but their interaction lacks the warm sensuality of Anne Schwanewilms and Anke Vondung&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Strauss-Rosenkavalier-Blu-ray/dp/B001HBX8PK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Strauss: Rosenkavalier [Blu-ray</a>] in the Dresden Rosenkavalier. Stoyanova is a wonderful soprano, but her characterization -- as she must have been directed -- is impassive, aloof. Though an experienced Octavian, Koch comes to life more when the arrival of Ochs forces her to assume the Mariandel disguise.

This is no ordinary Ochs in the Kurt Moll/Kurt Rydl mold. Gnther Groissbck is younger and virile and quite sufficiently rude and crude, even if he's not a buffoon. Some won't like him. I think he's the life of the party -- practically the only life in the party (except for the cameo role of the Italian tenor; Stefan Pop is the best I've seen at being so splendidly irrelevant). Groissbck takes over Act II, which is otherwise less than memorable. The presentation of the rose is dwarfed on the huge Salzburg stage into insignificance. Little help is provided by the Sophie of Mojca Erdmann, whose upper range is not pleasant, or by Adrian Erd, who sings competently but looks more like Sophie's brother than her father. There's no chemistry between Koch and Erdmann, the rampage of Ochs' entourage is muddled, the sword fight is awkward, and a vital piece of continuity is lost when we're not shown Octavian's plotting with the Italian tabloid journalists for Ochs' comeuppance.

Act III degenerates into a mess. With the action updated from 1740 to around the time of the opera's 1911 premiere, the apparitions at the inn that are meant to confound Ochs look as phony as an aluminum Christmas tree. The intimacy of tight camera shots -- especially when Koch is at her best as Mariandel -- is swallowed by the vast space of a surrounding park. Perhaps Welser-Mst gets through the Trio rapidly to disguise Erdmann's difficulties. It's not as moving as other renditions -- Stoyanova, whose costume makes her look 20 years older than in Act I, hardly changes expression -- and neither is Erdman's closing duet with Koch.

As the Marschallin exits, her servant Mohammed makes a surprising reappearance as her chauffeur, driving a vintage limo to pick up his mistress and Sophie's father (but not, as the Marschallin has promised, also Sophie and Octavian). After the young couple runs off stage, Mohammed walks out to retrieve the handkerchief that has been dropped. But whose handkerchief is it? In every other production I've seen, Sophie carries the handkerchief into the inn, and she's the one who drops it. Here, however, it's the Marschallin who brings it in and apparently drops it by a park bench. Mohammed takes it to the Marschallin's now closed bedroom door and, thinking better of knocking, instead inhales its perfume, as though perhaps he will become her next Octavian.

The liner notes, though, are at odds with the stage action, saying the handkerchief is Sophie's and that Mohammed might end up replacing Octavian in Sophie's affections. This confusion typifies the unbalanced feel of the whole production.

8682910,5,B00OAAKKL0,"I cant say enough how much I enjoyed this production of a fantastic opera by Strauss.  The staging was magnificent and complemented the terrific performances by the conductor and singers.  Sophie Koch is a wonderful Octavian, singing beautifully and her acting and expressions are wonderful.  She could handle s sword a bit more confidently but handling the demands of the music and role are mastered and far greater.  You just can't help but love her.  Krassimera Stoyanova gives an outstanding performance as the Feldmarchallin.  She sings beautifully and her acting is incredible.  There is a transitional scene where she comments to her hairdresser ""Today you have made me into an old woman"" and there is a transformation in her acting, expression and singing that conveys her aging from the woman trying to cling onto her youth, beauty and attractiveness (in her affair) to a stately, wise and confident noble woman who releases Octavian to the passion of his young manhood while finding peace alongside the sad fact that she is aging.  Gunther Groissbock is a plays a perfectly disgusting Baron Ochs.  He is a hedonistic, narcissistic, sociopathic, immature fool.  The role is one of a comic caricature of such a nobleman but such people exist in real life.  His has a terrific voice, great comic timing and plays the part convincingly.  Sophie is just beautiful and ""good"" as Octavian observes as Monica Erdman does justice to the role.  Adrian Erod does a grand job as Faninal but is young for the role.  I foresee him growing into it masterfully.  The supporting cast and action are well done and complement the performers and plot, ornamenting this sumptuous production.  Der Rosenkavalier has much to say to us and to every generation and this production is highly commended.",1422748800,14,1786,5.003389830508475
8682911,4,B00OAAKKL0,"As Salzburg productions go, the 2014 Der Rosenkavalier isn't one of their most adventurous, but in almost every area it serves the intentions of the work well. It's the conductor who is in charge of Der Rosenkavalier, and leading the ever impressive Vienna Philharmonic, Franz Welser-M&ouml;st's control and management of the score is absolutely stunning, weaving Strauss' complex lines through the singing voices, matching the melodies, the tempo and the sheer majesty of a score whose lyricism and evocation of resonances belies any notion of the work being merely ""a Viennese farce and nothing more"".

It's immediately apparent that the Salzburg production has a handle on all the essential ingredients. From the overture to the impression that is created by the elegant set for the Marschallin's bedroom in Act I, everything feels right and sounds right. All the more so on account of the singers we have in the roles of Marschallin and Octavian. Sophie Koch is maybe not so sure of voice on the top notes as she once was singing Octavian, but her experience counts. She knows the role well and is better fitted than most to handle the intricacies of this difficult trouser role (ahem, Glyndebourne!). Krassimira Stoyanova is a glorious Marschallin and gives a great performance here. She has an amazing voice that is perfect for big roles like this, and she is simply just one of the best Marschallins in the world at the moment. I don't think there's any particular chemistry between Stoyanova and Koch, but they work together well and bring their own character successfully to the roles.

I was disappointed however by G&uuml;nther Groissb&ouml;ck's Ochs von Lerchenau. His timbre is lovely and his delivery is perfectly good, but I just couldn't take to him as the baron. He doesn't look right and he doesn't appear terribly comfortable with the part either, focussed on delivery, singing almost entirely without looking at any of the other characters he is interacting with. It's possible I suppose that this is how the role has been directed, Ochs always dominating, the other characters always behind him, subservient to his sense of self-importance. Other than that however, Harry Kupfer's direction is hard to fault. The stage design is classy and elegant, the silver-grey colour scheme giving a sense of a cool nostalgic detachment for an idealised past. Hans Schavernoch's set is made up of large panels and props that glide into position, while large projected photographs of classical Vienna scenes, rooftops and parks place the work perfectly into the essential context of the wider world that the opera is set in.

The stylised version of this cold idealised Vienna contrasts perfectly with the warm richness of the lives and sentiments of the characters within it. Act I and II contrasts noble elegance with vulgar extravagance of marbled ostentation, while Act III doesn't just reveal the darker underside of the comic playing, it practically builds the set around the performers in the location of a misty Prater park, making it feel wholly a part of the wider world. Everything slips into place the way it ought to, as elegantly as Strauss's score falls into place, and the finale is simply gorgeous. Ochs ungraciously fades back into the mist, the Marschallin glides off in her Rolls Royce, leaving Koch's Octavian and Mojca Erdmann's delicately sweet-toned Sophie to break free from the past and look ahead to a new future.",1421020800,12,3448,5.056239015817223
8682912,5,B00OAAKKL0,"Fleming is still at her best in this performance as is Sophie Koch. But it's Diana Damrau who astounds here!  What a voice-- and what a final trio!!  Beautiful, fairly traditional production without any directorial ""improvements.""  Kauffmann sings the interrupted tenor aria in Act 1 beautifully.",1371340800,7,296,5.391304347826087
8682913,5,B00OAAKKL0,"Although this production moves the time forward and is not as elaborately staged as the Met's, it is still a worthy effort. Sophie Koch is visually much more convincing as the 17-year old Octavian than Susan Graham, who is otherwise quite wonderful. Normally I get restless with the seemingly endless antics of Baron Ochs, especially in the second act, but Franz Hawlata excels in this role and manages to keep my interest. Overall, I rank the Met's production higher, but Vienna is a close second. Rene Fleming remains the Marschallin of our time. For some reason, Mahomet, normally played by a dark-skinned boy, is replaced by a clown, perhaps inspired by comemdia dell'arte.",1356134400,4,677,5.0
