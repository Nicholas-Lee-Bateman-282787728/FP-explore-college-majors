7709846,1,B01D9TA53U,The first film is the same old bluray that came out a few years ago the other films look just like the old dvds with the picture and sound the same the last film airport 79 the worse no special features except for the trailers again another big ripoff by a video company.,1466553600,,271,4.132075471698113

7709851,3,B01D9TA53U,"Universal have reissued all 4 Airport films on blu-ray now, 4 Discs on flip trays inside plastic case
the first AIRPORT film in this 4 Disc set is exactly the same as the previous blu-ray version
nothing has changed it's the same HD transfer & 5.1 master audio mix & has the usual Theatrical trailer
it's just this time around Universal have included the 3 other Airport sequels aswell
apart from the first AIRPORT which the transfer does look amazing quality No Grain no Dirt i wold rate 9/10 for picture quality
and maybe 7/10 for sound quality
the 3 other sequels didn't get the same respect tragically, AIRPORT '75,'77',79 have the same HD transfers
which look very Good but not excellent i would rate the transfers about 6 -7/10 & the sound quality for each film is about 5-6/10
there is no main menu for each sequel, each film starts playing when each Disc is loaded so you would press popup menu
on the remote to access the original trailer & chapter select, pretty pathetic presentation by universal
there is extended TV version of Airport 77 that was broadcast over 2 nights
Airport '77 TV version is 180mins which is roughly 1 hrs worth of more scenes
this TV version is only available to get as bootleg dvd which i was very lucky to buy of ioffer.com
it's spread of 2 discs about 90mins each Disc with chapters,
and the picture quality looks very Good in 1:66:1 ratio about 7/10 for VHS quality
AIRPORT '79 CONCORDE was also spread over 2 nights in 1982 making the runtime 180min
the Theatrical cut was released in 1979 so the extras scenes with new actors were filmed about 2 years later just for TV broadcast
i assume Universal have the copyrights to these TV versions, you'll have to harrass them with emails
to get them to release the TV cuts on dvd or blu-ray otherwise i Doubt universal will think of it
THE EXTRAS there isn't any apart from the usual Theatrical trailers for each sequel
Universal should've added the Deleted scenes from the TV broadcast's as extras, but they didn't
2-3 stars for this new 4 disc blu-ray based only Good quality HD transfers for the sequels & no new extras",1459468800,56,2107,4.5473684210526315

7709889,5,B01D9TA53U,"All four of the classic air disaster films from the 70's collected here in one inclusive Blu-ray set, and it's a GOOD one!

AIRPORT: A hellacious snowstorm interferes with a plane that's running out of fuel and must land after being damaged by a terrorist explosion. It's up to airport manager Burt Lancaster & chief mechanic George Kennedy to save the day. Suave, swaggering ladies man Dean Martin is our intrepid co-pilot. Helen Hayes is delightfully devious as an elderly stowaway, and Maureen Stapleton gives a terrific performance as the bewildered wife of the suicidal man who boards the plane with a homemade bomb.

AIRPORT '75: A mid-air collision with a small airplane mortally cripples a jumbo jet. With the flight crew dead, hotshot pilot Charlton Heston must perform a suicidal in-flight plane-to-plane zipline transfer(!) if he hopes to land the airliner and save its terrified passengers, including a young girl en route to a desperately-needed heart transplant. George Kennedy once again lends a hand, but in a much smaller capacity here in this sophomore installment of the airborne disaster soap opera. (And keep an out for the number of plot threads plucked from this entry and used to hilarious effect in the uproarious spoof of the genre, AIRPLANE!)

AIRPORT 77: Saboteurs planning to make off with a fortune end up dumping a jetliner into the Atlantic Ocean, miles from where the airport & the Navy think they went down. Will they be rescued before the pressure of the ocean crushes the aluminum hull of the downed jet, dooming all aboard? George Kennedy is back once again, but this time as one of the execs of the company that owns the hijacked plane! (A pretty good promotion for a former chief mechanic.) Jack Lemmon & Christopher Lee up the star power considerably in this water-logged entry.

AIRPORT '79 - THE CONCORDE: Debut transatlantic flight of the supersonic airliner is jeopardized by industrial espionage & intrigue. Robert Wagner leads the all-star cast. This time old George has been reduced to the Captain of the futuristic passenger jet. Lots of plot twists and multiple attacks (and near misses) up the tension in this, the swan song of the venerable series.

THOUGHTS: The films are pretty good though fairly routine and more or less assembly line retreads, with few exceptions. Like Roddy McDowall was for The Planet of the Apes movies, George Kennedy is the lynch pin here that loosely inter-connects these all-star panic in the sky flicks, as gruff-but-lovable airline mechanic cum airport supervisor cum Airline owner cum Concorde captain, Joe Patroni. Tons of guest stars in each film add to the fun, and the special effects are decent for the most part, (though they definitely show their age in some scenes).

THE BLU-RAY: This 4-disc set from Universal set is a pretty good one. All of the films have been remastered in hi-def and look fairly impressive for the most part. They're not frame-by-frame restorations, unfortunately, but they look quite good considering their age. The audio portion on all four films is strong, level & clean. Sadly, there's not much in the way of extras, but it's the films themselves that I bought this set for, (and I got it for a good price, too), so while I'm sorta bummed, I still think it was a solid deal. It was a nostalgic blast to revisit these old school airborne catastrophe films again. (These seemingly played all the time on the ABC Sunday Night Movie, way back in the day.) Clean, excellent picture & sound in a compact, 4-disc snapcase collector's set. All-in-all, this set is a good bargain which I highly recommend! 5 STARS",1503187200,2,3622,4.900489396411093

7709891,4,B01D9TA53U,"All 4 are beautiful Blu-Ray discs. However, only the original ""Airport"" is the best. The last 3 are entertaining,  but rip-offs of the genre.",1501113600,2,141,4.875
7709892,5,B01D9TA53U,"The Airport movies finally get an HD upgrade and proper aspect treatment. I previously had the DVD editions, and one in particular seemed to be off. It was Airport '75. It looks good here in this set, no problem. Each one has the Theatrical trailer, or what they could get their hands on for a trailer, to be exact. The Trailers are not HD, but the movies are and that is the plus here.
I would say the weakest of the movies is the ""79 one, The Concorde. I tried watching that one when I had the DVD set and I couldn't get half way into it. I would have liked to have seen some interviews with some of the cast that was still alive when this was released. I believe Karen Black and George Kennedy were, now they are deceased as of recent years.
I think these are the best the movies are going to look, so do some looking for the best deals.
All four discs are housed nicely in a cover sleeve box with poster artwork on the back for each movie. Very nice.",1500076800,,954,4.106951871657754
7709893,4,B01D9TA53U,"Three decent movies and one coaster.

The original ""Airport"" in 1970 was a monster hit, one of the highest grossing movies of that year.  It is earnest but weighed down by just a touch of camp.  It has drama and tension but never gets too exciting.  ""Airport '75"" fares marginally better and features an all-star cast.  ""Airport '77"" is a surprisingly good thriller with admirable production value.  Actors Jack Lemmon, Christopher Lee, and Darren McGavin keep things afloat (pardon the pun, if you've seen it) quite well.  The extra footage shown in TV broadcasts is not included in this Blu-ray set.  The fourth movie, the one that killed the franchise, is ""The Concorde: Airport '79"".  It's by far the weakest and silliest of the bunch.  The celebrity cameos make it seem like a low-rent ""Love Boat"" episode. Skip it.

The films all look good in their Blu-ray presentation.  More or less a bare-bones release, though.  A trailer here and there but no bonuses to speak of.  Now that the price has settled down a bit I can recommend the purchase for nostalgia reasons.  But think of it as buying three movies, not four.",1499558400,3,1120,4.730569948186528

7709917,4,B01D9TA53U,"Well, I wouldn't catch a plane with any of these people!!!

But I'd catch a movie!

Story lines are well known so no spoilers here!

The first AIRPORT is a lot of fun with a strong story line and great fun performances. Though Helen Hayes won the supporting Actress Academy Award, I thought Maureen Stapleton was absolutely impeccable in her tortured, emotional role and should have got the Award. Van Heflin too, was tremendously moving as the misguided, emotionally scarred husband of Stapleton. Gut wrenching performances.

AIRPORT '75 is fun enough along with AIRPORT '77 and it's rather interesting story of being rescued from the ocean floor without stretching credibility too much.

AIRPORT '79 THE CONCORDE... good cast but that story was a bit hard to take especially when the pilot's window was wound down to fire off a flare gun to distract a heat seeking missile (!!).... must belong in the 10 IDIOTIC IDEAS IN MOVIES OR DON'T DO THIS WHEN YOU'RE ON A PLANE!!

I must point out though the real flying sequences in these movies, particularly more in the last 3 films, were excellent and very spectacular viewed on my 8ft wide movie screen with a Benq Video Projector with a 50,000 to 1 contrast ratio.

All in all, good to have these films in pristine restored Blue Ray versions.",1482019200,8,1290,4.757847533632287

I think I may have rented one or two of them, but I was never motivated to own them until you offered them on blu-ray.  Let me tell all those who have never experienced it, watching a blu-ray version of a film on a hi-def TV screen (with a very few exceptions of some really old DVD movies that were transferred to blu-ray) is like watching a movie in IMAX.  The quality is outstanding, clear, no ""visual noise"", the sound is excellent and the extras are very entertaining.  I have been in the process of transferring my DVD collection to blu-ray and 99 percent of the conversion is done through Amazon Prime.  I am always amazed at how fast I get my DVDs after I order them and the ""one-click"" ordering is absolutely fabulous.

The quality of movies is super great at all levels--Academy Award nominations, great actors!, clarity AND even the SOUND is truly phenomenal as well!  I put in the DVDs & soon realized I had not raised the sound level from the TV programming!  Astonishing!  Happy Dance!

The best of the lot remains the 1970 original, jam-packed with an all-star roster and some truly hokey performances from Burt Lancaster, Dean Martin and Van Heflin, looking bloated and bemused. The original movie is basically a melodrama set in the sky. The subsequent installments are pseudo-disaster epics; the second and fourth playing like really bad jokes. The third, Airport 77, is as improbable as it proves campy good fun; the 747 crashing in the Bermuda Triangle and sinking to the bottom of the sea, later to be hoisted to the surface by a series of pontoons. Dumb - but actually enjoyable.

Transfer wise: only the first movie has been meticulously restored. The rest fall short of expectation. But again Airport 77 looks the best of the remaining flicks, followed by Airport 75.  The last installment is a disaster; riddled in heavy grain, dull colors and a lot of shifts in contrast and color tonality. Badly done. Buy accordingly.",1469404800,,1001,4.882352941176471
7709979,5,B01D9TA53U,"I had the Airport Blu Ray that was released a few years ago with its superb remastering and I always lamented the DVD releases for the Airport sequels, the images were poor.  Well in this new box set all four Airport films are on Blu Ray.  The original Airport is the same superb Blu Ray release but what's great is the sequels have been cleaned up and remastered and all three look like they're brand new films.  My particular favorite is Airport 77, the DVD release print was so poor that the actual disaster depicting the jet hitting the oil rig and landing in the Bermuda Triangle looked so murky, if you hadn't seen the film previously you might have difficulty enjoying the disaster.  This newly cleaned print looks amazing.  Airport '77 has a better cast in my opinion as well; the other sequels are enjoyable but laughable; I guess all four are on the campy side, still sometimes you just want to spend a day living vicariously through other people's disasters.",1469318400,,969,4.6104651162790695
7709980,5,B01D9TA53U,"Always enjoyed this series of movies.  I am glad to have them now in one package.  Clearly, the first movie was the best but the others are always good for a laugh.",1469232000,,164,4.09375
7709981,5,B01D9TA53U,"Finally all 4 of the 1970s era Airport disaster films are available on Blu-ray for the first time ever! The original film, Airport, had been previously available on Blu-ray as a single release, but the three sequels make their Blu-ray debut in this set.

Airport released in 1970 kick started the 1970s disaster movie craze bringing together many of the elements that made the genre so popular (all star casts, tense set pieces, great special effects and lots of drama). This film is done very seriously and depicts a series of mishaps at a busy airport including inclement weather, a plane that slides off a runaway and becomes stuck in the snow, protestors from a nearby community who want a runway shut down as the air traffic goes right over their homes, a stowaway, marital drama and a bomber on board one of the planes. Lots of great performances from the likes of Burt Lancaster, Dean Martin, Jean Seberg, Jacqueline Bissett, George Kennedy, Van Heflin, Maureen Stapleton and Helen Hayes is marvelous as the elderly stowaway. This film was nominated for a number of Academy Awards including Best Picture in 1970 and was a promising start to the disaster genre, which eventually became high camp by the close of the 1970s.

Airport 1975, released in 1974, came out in the heyday of the disaster film (The Poseidon Adventure had already come out and also in 1974 the likes of The Towering Inferno and Earthquake proved the staying power of the genre). Airport 1975 again features an all star cast, but the plot this time is a little more straightforward, rather than dealing with the running of an airline at the airport terminal, this film tells the story of a midair collision and the crew and passengers must work to keep the plane in the air after the pilots are injured or killed. Charlton Heston leads the rescue operations on the ground along with George Kennedy while Karen Black attempts to fly the plane. A number of notable stars are passengers aboard the flight (Helen Reddy as a singing nun, Gloria Swanson as herself, Myrna Loy and Sid Caesar share seats together and Linda Blair is a terminally ill child on her way to receive an organ transplant). Despite the film heading into some campy territory with the singing nun character, the film was surprisingly entertaining and kept me watching the screen the whole time.

Airport '77, released in 1977, tells the story of a high end 747 loaded with important guests who have been invited by Jimmy Stewart to attend the opening of his new museum of art. However the plane is hijacked mid air by a group of thieves hiding in plain sight as crew members who attempt to gas the passengers and steal priceless works of art on board the plane and make their getaway all while the passengers sleep it off. However this goes awry when the plane clips an oil rig and crashes into the ocean where it proceeds to sink to the bottom. After the plane disappears Jimmy Stewart uses his pull to get help in finding the plane which includes George Kennedy back again this time in a very small role. Jack Lemmon is the pilot, Brenda Vaccaro the head stewardess and the passengers include Lee Grant, Olivia de Havilland, Joseph Cotten, M. Emmett Walsh and Christopher Lee.

The Concorde: Airport '79 is definitely the worst of the bunch. Coming out in 1979 at the end of the disaster craze it was full of high camp and like many other disaster flicks of the time (The Swarm, Beyond the Poseidon Adventure and When Time Ran Out) it bombed spectacularly at the box office, successfully ending the franchise. This one features Susan Blakely as a reporter who receives intel that her lover (Robert Wagner), the head of a major corporation, is selling arms to terrorists and she plans to report on this upon arriving in Paris after a flight aboard The Concorde airplane. Robert Wagner uses various means to try and ensure she doesn't survive the trip including shooting experimental missiles at the plane and hiring rogue French jets to try and shoot them down. The film features French star Alain Delon and the returning George Kennedy as the pilots of the Concorde and a host of B-actors are on board as the passengers including (Jimmie Walker as saxophone player, Charo who attempts to smuggle on her pet dog, Eddie Albert as the owner of the Concorde, Avery Schreiber as the coach of a Russian Olympic team and Martha Raye who is hysterically out of place as a woman who suffers from incontinence. Martha Raye features in a scene so unbelievable it has to bee seen, she is seen tumbling around the airplane lavatory as the Concorde veers, darts, dives and spins to avoid the aforementioned missiles. This one is probably more for completists like myself who like to watch all movies in a series or for fans of bad movies.

As for the picture quality of the films Airport and Airport '77 look and sound amazing on my Home Theater set up. Airport 1975 is very good as well. The Concorde: Airport '79 is the worst in terms of picture quality as it is quite grainy in a lot of scenes, however all 4 films look better than their DVD counterparts.

All in all, this is a great set to add to your collection if you are a fan of the films, the 1970s or disaster films in general. OR maybe you grew up with these and want a great nostalgia ride back to the 1970s. Also a great price for 4 films, all around 2 hours each or longer in Airport's case.",1469232000,17,5388,4.613138686131387

7709989,4,B01D9TA53U,this gets 4 stars because the first movie is so good in a soap opera-ish way - and the last three movies (with the possible exception of Airport 77 which is better than 75 or 79) fall into the so bad they're good category.  Airport 75 is just a Charlton Heston fun fest - Karen Black is purely awful. and George Kennedy is useless  but George gets to shine in the worst outing in the series Airport 79- the Concorde but George is given some of the funniest most politically incorrect lines that are a howl.  Airport 77 is a dumb movie but is heightened with good special effects and the whole rising water scenes coupled with the very realistic naval rescue operations that took place.  An enjoyable and worthwhile box set.,1468454400,,723,4.454545454545454
