7845430,4,6303402003,"I found this anime a little short after watching it,but it's a good story,it's got an amazing hero character that's like a cross between the guyver,Spider-man and Spawn all wrapped into one.

I found the climax towards the end was kind of rushed,but it ended in an explosive sort of way,and the final scene after the credits is kind of touching and hopeful.

I still think it could've been longer,but it's a good straight to the point anime,a definite classic.

I also found this was based on a manga of the same name and is from the same guy who created Jo Jo's bizzare venture,now that's something to look forward to as well.",1330041600,,627,4.530973451327434
7845431,4,6303402003,"This is an anime you'll either love... or hate.  Following the style of Guyver, a young man gains superhuman abilities due to a bio booster - in this case a parasite.
But BAOH, while low on plot, was quite enjoyable for me.  The story is merely one section of an entire history not even discussed by the movie, which you could read in the manga.  What did Dr. Kasuminome go into this field, what prompted him?  Why did Ikuro become so attached to Sumire?
You're treated, in this video, a single snapshot of a potentially wonderful series.  I recommend you watch it at least once... in my opinion its on par with the old 80's greats.  Bubblegum Crisis, Guyver, Ranma, and Dirty Pair.",981849600,,682,4.504065040650406
7845432,2,6303402003,This follows a pretty formulaic anime plot.  Guy gets infected with government organism as part of an experiment to try and create a more evolved super-soldier.  He seeks revenge and the recovery of his lost memories.  The female character and her little pet are interesting footnotes in an otherwise silly and immature video.,973209600,,326,5.113207547169812
7845433,1,6303402003,"There was a plot to this movie, but the point of this movie is not the  plot, but rather the stunning animation (on par with Ninja Scroll) and well  executed fight scenes. Baoh reminds me in some ways of ""Guyver""  in that he is an organic superhero with all sorts of fun abilities. It's  somewhat mindless, and as I said before, quite light on the plot and  character development, but surprisingly enjoyable anyway. An interesting  touch is that Baoh apparently cannot speak when transformed, although they  sometimes allow the audience to hear his thoughts.
I found the voice  acting average. Both Walken and the head of Doress overacted their parts  terribly, especially the latter, but most of the rest were competent if not  overwhelming. Music was also eminently forgettable, but appropriate for  whatever scene it was in. Also somewhat lacking was character development.  All the characters were pretty much stock for the genre, but I list that as  a neutral factor. If they weren't riveting, at least they weren't boring or  stupid.
I said it before, and I'll say it again. As animation goes, it's  one of the best I've ever seen. Good thing too, because it's all the movie  has.....",965779200,,1190,4.845771144278607
7845434,1,6303402003,"The evil organization known as Doress has captured a young man to use for their evil  experiment(gasp). What is their evil plan,you ask? Well, Doress is planning to put a worm-like parasite in the boys brain. The worm feeds  on the kids brain, while at the same time, allows him to transform into a  big, blue superhero, (WOW!), that can shoot needles out of his head, big  blades from his arms, and other abilities that mostly end up cutting up  heads. Anyway,he meets a little girl with psychic powers,who helps him  escape from the evil organization Doress. But when the little girl is  captured, The boy must use Baohs amazing power to defeat Doress and save  his friend. Did I mention the boy has amnesia?
If you didn't notice from  my description of ""Baoh""s story that I was being sarcastic, I  will say upfront,BAOH IS AN AWFUL ANIME. Quite honestly,I could find hardly  anything decent about it besides the animation. Not that the animation was  that good. Sure,the animation was very detailed, but it was not very  attractive. The textures were ugly,and took away from the overall  experience. The story was fairly unique,but the plot was pretty bad. What  bothered me most was the extreme(and I mean extreme!) violence. I'm talking  almost X level, almost as violent as ""Fist of the North Star"" .  ""baoh""s violence was almost unbearable, mostly involving heads.  Honestly,I have never seen so many ways to destroy a head.  Heads explode  ,are chopped off, get needles blasted into them, are cut into multiple  pieces, smashed, melted, the list goes on and on. Yeech!
Another flaw  this movie has is its embarassing dubbing. It's some of the worst I've ever  heard. Sometimes it is overacted,and sometimes the voices sound like the  actors are half asleep. And sometimes,they combine both bad and good  dubbing into one sentence.
This anime has so many problems I can't name  them all. Don't torture yourself. This garbage won't appeal to anyone. Even  if you like the graphic violence, chaotic and excessive gore and blood, The  film will still provide you will another bad point. Just please,for your  own good,stay away. You'll be glad you did. And for those of you who make  the fatal mistake buying this trash, I can only laugh and pray.",957052800,,2251,4.816753926701571
7845435,5,6303402003,"I have seen several anime movies and this one,  along with Riding Bean, is the best I've seen!!! It has a nice plot that's not too complicated yet not stupid like many other animes. If you are an anti-violent person when it  comes to cartoons then do not buy this, This is a very bloody and violent  movie and the artwork is excellent!!!",936576000,,337,4.317460317460317
7845436,3,6303402003,"Baoh was a nice little anime.  It lacked a few things from getting it a 5 star.  The art was great even for now, but some lines appeared to thick at times.  The characters were average, they didn't have enough story behind  them as for why they are there.  The main character was pretty cool, just a  normal guy until some scientists wanted to do some experements.  His  transformation is really cool and the way he deals with people is great,  also this anime was very gory for its time and now.  over all Boah is a  must see, maybe a buy because of its length, or to some not even worth it.",925430400,,592,4.150442477876106
