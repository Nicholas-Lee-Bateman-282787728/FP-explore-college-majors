2920132,5,B000UAK75I,"This is a great DVD. There is more than enough in this encyclo. to become Hercules! Buy this package. Work out with it. If you are not strong enough after doing these tortures...well, you must be some sort of mutant! I can't say more. Just work out! Just do it! No excuses...use this with Pavel's stuff. Must admit alot of his (Pavel's) works are expensive. So, if you need to save but want to still get healthy...get this encyclo. get some kettlebells and work out! Do something for yourself develop your mind body and spirit... Be healthy! Help someone out today! BE FULLY HUMAN TODAY! YEAH!!!",1204502400,4,595,4.622641509433962
2920133,5,B000UAK75I,"I own and use this DVD. If I had to own only one teachers DVD instruction for kettlebells...this would be the one. It is detailed, clear, specific, and accurate. Steve is an outstanding athlete and what makes this DVD so good is that Steve is also an exceptional teacher. Numerous of my students have ordered and enjoyed these DVDs. Navigating through the various DVDs is easy. Each movement being taught is shown from several angles with minimal camera movement. This makes it much easier to see what Steve is demonstrating.

Steve puts lots of focus on detailed descriptons of the most efficient way to do each kettlebell lift. I find that I refer back to these DVDs regularly to refine my own skills. Truly a worthwhile investment for everyone wanting outstanding instruction in the art and science of kettlebell lifting.

Get series 1 today, put the principles and skills Steve teaches into practice, and you'll experience significant gains in a very short period of time. I would give these DVDs a ten star if I could.",1203379200,22,1023,4.806818181818182
2920134,4,B000UAK75I,The DVD has excellent information.  Steve Cotter goes through just about every form of kettlebell lifting imaginable.  My main issue with the series is that the workouts provided aren't terribly helpful.  The basic workouts seem too quick/easy and the advanced workouts are just that - advanced.  I would recommend this as a great way to get kettlebell instruction if you don't have access to a certified trainer.  But you'll need another DVD to do an actual workout routine.,1198972800,19,475,5.038461538461538
2920135,5,B000UAK75I,If you are serious about Kettlebells this is a must have!  A good range of exercises and really thorough explanations and demonstrations.  Couldn't wish for more.,1319414400,,162,5.1923076923076925
2920136,5,B000UAK75I,"Cotter provides every detail of every segment of every lift from every angle.  When first viewing DVD #1, this seemed tedious.  When I actually tried to do the lifts, I went back and viewed the DVD again, and I greatly appreciated his detailed explanations.

This is not a workout DVD. This is a set of DVDs that demonstrate and explain dozens of lifts.  However, Cotter does program numerous workout programs for you, from beginner to advanced, and even specialty programs for football.  I counted 16 separate programs.  These are listed in a brief pamphlet included in the DVD case.

If you've not been trained by a qualified instructor on kettlebell use, you will really appreciate these videos.  And they will probably be all you need, except for a quality set of kettlebells, of course.",1311465600,6,791,4.850746268656716
2920137,5,B000UAK75I,OMG I love kettlebells and this DVD has been invaluable as a training aid.  Steve Cotter is a fitness god.,1311292800,,106,4.3
2920138,5,B000UAK75I,"This DVD set lives up to its title.  The instruction for each technique is excellent with an emphasis on making the instruction for the technique clear and easy to follow.  As previously indicated there is little in the way of flashy production or high tech special effects.  Considering the subject what would be the point, it's not an entertainment video, it's an instructional video.  I own a number of kettlebell DVDs and book and this one is by far the best for teaching you correct form and technique.  The only weakness to this DVD set is that it does not have dedicated sections for programing, proper warm-ups, and mobility/flexibility.  There are a few exercises for mobility/flexibility discussed along with some of the techniques, but these are not easily found for reference.  Overall, this DVD set is a valuable addition to any training library, and I highly recommend it to anyone that is interested in working out with kettlebells.",1294444800,4,947,4.955696202531645
2920139,5,B000UAK75I,I got this when I began kettlebells and it taught me how to do every exercise with good form!  It also taught me exercises that I wouldn't of thought of!,1287014400,,153,4.1
2920140,5,B000UAK75I,"I am a female in late 20, and I have been training with a trainer past few months. He recommended Steve Cotter videos. After enjoying his free sample videos, I purchases this whole set. I bought this from Amazon Marketplace seller MMA-DVDs at $79 NEW. (Ordered on Wednesday, and received on Monday.)

I watched many KettleBell instruction videos online, and I found Steve Cotter the clearest.
He goes over all the important details without a trace of condescending or arrogance.
He is very thorough. He goes over every possible variation, and every possible safety issues. (I am a physicist and I can ensure that his mechanics is correct.)

The most introductory and clearest one of his video is here, [...]

""Kettlebell Basics with Steve Cotter

Learn proper kettlebell technique. Steve Cotter stops by UW to show us four basic kettlebell movements. The Kettlebell Swing The Single-Arm Kettlebell Swing The Kettlebell Clean The Kettlebell Lockout ""

And then this website has a sample from every single chapter of this DVD set.
[...]

He is more instructional than others. He is down to earth. He is less about showing off his skills, and more about sharing his knowledge with us.

Some KettleBellers are fitness genius and watching their videos don't tell me how/whether I can get there (or get any closer). Steve is a fitness genius and also a TEACHING GENIUS.

Steve breaks a big goal into many smaller steps to follow. Having this DVD is like having a GPS navigator for your cross country journey. (Some other DVDs by other people may feel like a compass, just pointing the goal but not necessarily the instructions.)

Every penny well worth spent on this DVD!

* It's nice and inspirational to have Valery Fedorenko appearing in the DVD, too.

** I like Pavel Tsatsouline, and I plan on buying KettleBells (and some DVDs) from his company Dragon Door. I benefited hugely from Pavel's Enter the KettleBell book. Even if you love Pavel, this DVD set of Steve is a must-have. Steve is systematic, clear, organized, and thorough. I wasn't particularly impressed with how Pavel explains (body) mechanics, but Steve is really competent in explaining relevant physics. I also felt I can relate to Steve better. My theory is that: for Pavel, Kettlebell is an instinct, but for Steve, he earned it hard. Steve knows how to think from our point of view: our lives didn't start with kettlebell lifting. :-) His martial arts background is also very helpful, because he has a broad view on these various exercise schemes. Pavel is more for elites I felt, or someone who is already familiar.

Both Pavel and Steve are great, and buy Steve's DVD set and buy Kettlebells from Dragon Door

2920141,5,B000UAK75I,"Steve explains all of the moves so clearly!
Very helpful especially for beginners like me.
You can see some pieces of this on youtube and get a preview.
Or you can skip that and just get it - you won't be dissapointed.",1260662400,3,218,4.214285714285714
2920142,4,B000UAK75I,"Been following Dragondoor for years.  I got a discounted/new&used one and I don't need much else to explore the world of girevoy sport.  This guy is insanely strong though and really presents why he is one of the best lifters in the world.  This is an encyclodedia, you won't get to work out along with him really.  I would search youtube for previews of other dvds...I think Maxwell does a regime based one or Enter the Kettlebell....which I am probably get as well.

  Stick with the fundamentals if you get this and are relatively new to it.  His TGU lessons are key and the Swing is so important especially Fedorenko's appearance to show 'softstyle' swings and pulls versus Cotter's preference for 'hardstyle' swings.

  Pick it up, get up and get em up!",1248652800,4,758,4.666666666666667
2920143,5,B000UAK75I,"If kettlebell training was taught at universities, Steve Cotter would be a professor emeritus. This is truly an in depth analysis of kb. exercises. The DVD progresses in a very logical order and each section is also organized nicely from easier to harder drills. Steve explains each drill in detail and speaks very clearly. Each point is then demonstrated. There is no fluff at all in this set. High quality work from a true professional.",1243036800,6,438,4.8533333333333335
2920144,5,B000UAK75I,"Steve Cotter gives an excellent introduction to kettlebells and then does a thorough job of explaining and demonstrating each exercise and the many variations of each.  He also does a nice job demonstrating different combination exercises.  This is DVD set is a video reference and not a workout DVD.  I refer to it often to find ways to keep my kettlebell workouts fresh.  There are sample workouts in the enclosed booklet that comes with the DVD but I like to make up my own.  One thing to keep in mind, even though this is a very good video, I would recommend finding a certified kettlebell instructor (RKC credential) via dragondoor.com for a session or two so that they can evaluate your form. It is easy to get the form wrong even after watching the videos a few times and it good to get feedback from someone experienced.",1241568000,4,828,4.605442176870748
8212779,5,B000UAK75I,"If you're just staring out or fairly well into it, this is for you. If you are doing aerobic kettlebell with Paul Katami, or Russian power training, this is for you.  The level of detail Steve Cotter goes into in just the first of five discs is worth the money.  Currently I have watched the first three over a dozen times each and just getting into the fouth. Once I start the fifth DVD, I will order the second set of 5 DVDs; I am that pleased with the workouts.

My wife has a personal trainer, and she is now schooling him on technique; go figure...  The trainer claims he is ordering this set. Will see.  Net-Net, not only a great investment, but the techniques for assuring no injuries is essential regardless of aerobic light weight Paul Katami Kettlebell or the power training with heavier weight.",1459296000,,805,4.486301369863014
8212780,3,B000UAK75I,"It's an unfair review but I ended up injuring myself with the kettlebells.  Avulsion fractures I believe they're called, where the muscles pulls out tiny pieces of the bone, on my elbow from swinging these out too hard.  I didn't think I was swinging them too hard but it is quite a different motion than you're normally used to so I guess I needed to go much, much slower in the beginning.  I will be selling my DVDs to look for a program a little less violent on the movement.  Some of those 'flips' with the bells look like they could easily take out your wrist. I had no intention on trying them.",1435449600,,600,4.283185840707965
8212781,5,B000UAK75I,Very thorough. Highly recommend.,1430265600,,32,7.25
8212782,5,B000UAK75I,"The best I have seen. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to learn how to perform Kettlebell exercises correctly. The instruction is clear and concise and the demos are inspiring. No hype and no attitude.

The fact that this set does not include workout programming is not a shortcoming. If you want to learn workout programming get either Steve Cotter's or Jeff Martone's book.",1428969600,,382,4.96875
8212783,5,B000UAK75I,Lots of good info for kettlebell exercise,1405641600,,41,5.0
8212784,4,B000UAK75I,I use this to work on bettering my technique one move exercise at a time.  It is a terrific reference for both teachers and home-study enthusiasts.,1400544000,,147,4.653846153846154
8212785,4,B000UAK75I,"Each DVD has a series of kettlebell moves: a dozen versions of the clean, snatch, jerk, swings, hinges, etc. He gives a great explanation of each type and it's a good resource to have.

However, there isn't an actual workout to follow. There is a tiny card included in the DVD with sample workouts that you'd put together on your own, but you can't follow him while doing the workouts, because each move is in a different chapter on a different DVD.

It's like learning a language with a dictionary alone. It's useful to look up words and examples, but you will have an impossible time trying to learn how to string together a sentence or carry on a conversation with a dictionary alone.

If you are new to kettlebells, this might be a good addition to another instructional DVD that has workouts that guide you through the series of exercises.",1388016000,4,844,4.576158940397351
8212786,5,B000UAK75I,"First of all, I purchased this DVD, before it was available on Amazon, for 99.99 and would gladly do so again. When I was introduced to kettlebells, there wasn't a RKC instructor within two states of me and I could tell by its' design that it could, easily, cause injury if I wasn't careful.

The first thing I purchased was a book by Pavel but books don't provide as much visual instruction, so I opted to get this video. This was EASILY the best decision I've made when it comes to the kettles. Steve Cotter is a fantastic story teller and can break down the practice of the swing, which is the foundation of all kettlebell exercises, to the point where he points out all the little things your body will do to compensate the load but will, ultimately, wreck your form. If you remember nothing else, remember this: FORM IS KING.

The way he shows how the technique is done, combined with his ability to break down every movement verbally, is the best I have ever experienced. It was as if he remembered every detail of what it was like when he was starting out, along with other things I had never considered. When I was finally able to get true kettlebell instruction, I was let down by the multitude of information they were not telling me, as I had already watched this series before going to them and thought to get a more 'hands-on' supplementary to my workout. The truth is that some people are simply not good at breaking down and explaining a movement every step of the way. In this regard, Cotter is a true genius because he is able to impart the importance of good form as well as show its practice without being in the room with you.

If you cannot get to an instructor, you won't be headed for certain injury if you pick up this DVD series. This has even been able to help me. in other parts of my life, to see how a situation is made up of many different parts. It's always easy to talk about, but until you see someone apply the technique, you might not be able to fully understand how it works. I never thought I would be able to utilize a workout DVD in other areas of my life.

ON A DIRE NOTE: I would recommend that you watch the video series a few times before you pick up your kettlebell in order to get very familiar with what he's talking about. I practiced the moves before picking up my kettle just to get used to the basics before adding weight to the equation. Doing this saved me hours of pain later and, no doubt, trips to the doctor's office.",1381536000,,2473,4.311827956989247
8212787,5,B000UAK75I,Awesome tutorial. If your going to work out with kettlebells do yourself a favor and just get this now and save yourself from injury and have a much better kettlebell experience.,1376611200,,178,4.774193548387097
8212788,5,B000UAK75I,steve cotter explains things very well and the demos are very effective. it's also a comprehensive set but it is a little pricy.,1363305600,,128,4.608695652173913
