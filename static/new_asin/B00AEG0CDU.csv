5410545,4,B00AEG0CDU,"Very interesting look at what we live with, sleep with, even eat and breathe, but can't see. I use this one in my classes (6-12) regularly.",993686400,4,139,4.384615384615385
8550479,5,B00AEG0CDU,I taped this show from TV onto VHS many years ago and showed it to numerous excited students. VHS technology waned and this dvd still holds classes of kids spellbound as they look at the mites inside our eyelashes and ant wars!!,1468627200,,228,4.4523809523809526

8550481,4,B00AEG0CDU,"I showed it to my 9th grade biology students and used a worksheet I found online to make sure they watched it. It was pretty engaging with all of the electron microscope images. I don't often show a film for an entire class period. The running time was about 42 minutes, which was ideal for a 50-minute class period. It did not have a closed caption option (I had a hearing impaired student in my class), and it is an older film, so that is why I gave it 4/5 stars.",1432944000,,465,4.1208791208791204
8550482,5,B00AEG0CDU,"If you want to see microscopic critters that occupy your home, this is the video to watch! I have shown this to middle schoolers for several years and it is a favorite. It is starting to feel a bit outdated but the kids tell me that they like it anyway.",1401753600,,253,4.08
8550483,5,B00AEG0CDU,This is a wonderful video.  Used it in science class with 7th grade but is great for the entire family.,1392681600,,103,4.15
8550484,5,B00AEG0CDU,Great  video with a great price.  I wish it would come out in DVD.  Most people do not have VHS.,1388793600,,96,3.7
8550485,3,B00AEG0CDU,"Interesting movie to watch, but a little dated.  Not something that is watched over and over again, but has some cool parts",1382572800,,123,4.590909090909091
8550486,5,B00AEG0CDU,"This is a classic! Using great photography, it gives you a different perspective on what's going on in your house. I've used the VHS version for years in my science classes.",1371772800,,173,4.612903225806452
8550487,2,B00AEG0CDU,"I did not realize that this was made in 1990 - or maybe even before that.  Old move, grainy, not what I hoped to get.  Looks like a home made copy of the VHS version.  2008 is misleading.  Sorry to say this because it is a great OLD documentary, I just thought it was redone in 2008.",1371600000,,283,3.912280701754386
8550488,5,B00AEG0CDU,"I have used this video in my science classes (grades 5-10, over the years) since it first came out. I always get the same response from my students. ""Wow I didn't know that was in my house!"" I would recommend this video to any science teacher for almost any age, if it can be found. Unfortunately I have worn my copy out...",1029283200,,323,4.225806451612903
