8553685,3,B00AMHFR0E,Good but not  memorable,1439769600,,23,4.75
8553686,5,B00AMHFR0E,Brilliant DVD with Carlton and Ford bouncing off one another. There is a wonderful little pre-gig interlude where they reminisce about when they first met. A great selection on anyone's music library.,1413936000,,200,5.28125
8553687,4,B00AMHFR0E,"I really enjoy this performance and the audio quality (the bass is tremendous -- just like in the club).  However, I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5, because it's DVD and not blu-ray.  Judging by the aspect ratio and video quality, I suspect this show was recorded in HD.  So why not release it that way?  But the musical performance is 5 stars ! ! ! ! !  (with 5 exclamation points :)",1389916800,,388,4.1891891891891895
8553688,5,B00AMHFR0E,Very accoustic pieces.  I especially like the variation played on old pieces such as Rio Samba.  Larry's  accoustic guitar playing is also fantastic.,1388534400,,149,5.391304347826087
8553689,5,B00AMHFR0E,It is a brilliant example of how to do acoustic blues with a touch of jazz.  The two leads are so familiar and interactive that they practically end each other's solos.  Larry Carlton never hits a wrong note and Robben Ford is solid on the guitar and as a singer.  It is graet to see how they played the lines with the DVD.,1365897600,,323,4.095238095238095
8553690,4,B00AMHFR0E,Two fine masters of the jazz blues genre showing why they are still alive and doing well. It is a nice departure from what is out there these days.,1365033600,,147,4.103448275862069
8553691,5,B00AMHFR0E,"Larry and Robben are two of my favorite players and they do not disappoint here. Excellent solos and rhythm playing, great choice of notes and concepts of harmony. A must have for any real guitar player.",1364774400,3,203,4.666666666666667
