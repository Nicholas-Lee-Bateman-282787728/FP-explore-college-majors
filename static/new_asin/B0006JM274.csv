2189815,3,B0006JM274,"The video series is ok for someone starting and learning to bowl. They cover the basics like how to throw the ball and the approach but when it comes to adapting for changing lane conditions they just talk about moving in and out to find the lane to the pocket. Not one graphic to show where or what they are talking about, this whole section of the video could be audio only, it's just talking.  It's basic, if that is what you want it will get you started but plan on needing more advanced information fairly quickly.",1111363200,19,519,4.350515463917525
2189816,5,B0006JM274,"This is a fairly fast-paced DVD that does what it says it will do - cover the essentials to better bowling. It's a nice DVD to refresh everyone on the basics. No matter what level you perform at, you always need to review the fundamentals and that's where this comes in handy. It's easy to watch and easy to follow. Beginners probably get the most out of this DVD and will want to watch it several times prior to practice and then watch it after practice to help assess your strengths and the areas that need some improvement. The rating is based on the fact that the content matches the title and purpose of the DVD. This is not something that an advanced bowler would have at the top of their purchase list, but again, it's a nice review of fundamentals that remain key to everyone's game. The material is presented by two of the most knowledgeable bowlers in the sport. It is a bit pricey, but the price is probably appropriate for its small market focus.",1109980800,26,958,4.418079096045198
8041851,4,B0006JM274,"I have owned this DVD for 10 years and am very familiar with it.  Good basic video, the principles are sound.  Explanation of release is good but could use better slow motion video showing Yokobosky doing it exactly as they explain it. Would like to see more explanation of HOW to keep armswing in the groove, how to open shoulders and hips in stance, get eyes on and over target line to get swing on target.  Yokobosky's arm goes out to side as Borden moves it into backswing.  Should position Yokobosky, explain exactly what can do to get swing on line and on target,  Crucial to bowl well.
Overall, good basics and principles are sound.",1498694400,,639,4.521739130434782
8041852,2,B0006JM274,"I'm an intermediate bowler, and did not like the way this DVD was set up. I don't recommend this for beginners either. It gave good tips but not any drills you can do to help increase your skill.",1486684800,,195,4.157894736842105

8041855,5,B0006JM274,I love the way mr. BORDEN EXPLAINS bowling processes.  He is rated second to my husband as it relates to my growth as a bowler.  Thanks Mr. BORDEN!!,1399334400,,148,4.25
8041856,1,B0006JM274,"I'm 60 years old, just getting back into bowling after a 30+ year layoff.  Back in the old days, I carried a fair average, but so much has changed now that I'm struggling to come to grips with the basics, I guess. I bought a new ball, one that supposed to be above average in performance on today's lane conditions and it's a fingertip, which I've never used before.

I bought this DVD in the hope that it would help me understand how to hold and throw the fingertip properly, by having good video on each part of the process.  Well, nothing there on that. They obviously know that the hardest part is the release of the ball, because they state so specifically, calling it the most misunderstood part of bowling.  They take 20 seconds to tell you that you need to have your thumb come out of the ball and then rotate your hand with the fingers still inside, to get your hook.  That's the same thing that every book on the topic says.  BUT, THEY DON'T SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THAT!!  The one fellow is wearing a wrist brace.  He's an ex PBA tour pro, so he must think that the wrist brace is a good thing. But, they don't mention that at all... phooey.... What good is a video that does nothing but read the fundamentals to you?  Wasted my money on this one.  :-(

I don't know, maybe this is a good DVD for rank beginners, but I don't see how it would be of benefit to anyone that can keep the ball out of the gutter most of the time. I think that anyone could get the same info from any of the books that cover this topic and save a lot of money doing so.",1296086400,5,1552,4.105960264900662
8041857,5,B0006JM274,I reviewed the tape before going bowling last week and bowled 4 strikes followed by a spare in a row.  First time in my life.  It worked for me to refresh all the rules and keep them top of the mind. Highly recommend.,1237420800,,217,4.023255813953488
8041858,5,B0006JM274,"I am a complete novice in bowling, and this video really helped me to properly start on the game. The instructions are introduced in a very structured manner which can really help a beginner. Yet, it is a good tool for reviewing one's progress in the game.

There are a lot of tutorials that one can find on the web, but no online tutorial video can compare to the ""Essential Keys to Better Bowling."" Happy bowling!",1188864000,2,415,4.4605263157894735
8041859,1,B0006JM274,"As the title says, this DVD addresses only the very basics and essentials of bowling.  Too basic perhaps...  I found it useful only to beginners.  Similar information is readily available on the Internet for either reading or watching as windows media files.

If you consider this DVD wait before ordering.  A much better alternative is Beyond the Bowling Basics, a detailed review of bowling techniques; from very basic to advanced, by Bohn III and Angelo.  All the information of bowling essentials has been covered in a much more detailed and organized way on Bohn's DVD.",1168300800,9,574,4.989473684210527
8041860,4,B0006JM274,"This DVD has very good basic pointers for improving your bowling game, but the presentation could have been more engaging. I purchased this item to assist Junior bowlers in improving their game and correcting bad habits. It was clear enough for them to understand, but had a difficult time holding their attention. They were quickly bored.",1168300800,2,339,5.071428571428571
