7870603,5,6304392648,"This has to be one of Jackies best old school movies.  Classic Jackie fighting and the crazy Snake in the Eagles shadow technique make this a legend.  Also those massive chopsticks Jackie's mentor used were amazing.  Jackie is a young servent who is taught the snake technique by a wandering  mentor.  But the Eagle clan has vowed to kill everyone who knows the art of  the snake.  Unlucky for them, Jackie comes up with his own technique.  The  Cats Claw.  In this movie a stunt went wrong and Jackie has his arm  slashed.  The original footage is still in the movie.  Arm the Homeless",916876800,3,586,4.519230769230769
7870604,5,6304392648,"Together with ""Drunken Master"", Snake in the Eagle's Shadow launched Jackie's career. Not to be confused with the ""sequel"", Snake in the Eagle's Shadow II, which to my knowledge doesn't even have  Jackie in it. The Eagle Claw style has embarked on a quest to eradicate the  Snake Fist style, and almost succeeds before the last living Snake Fist  master passes the art on to Jackie. Jackie's character is quite  cinderella-like, an orphan kept by the master as a janitor. picked on and  abused by the other instructors when the master is away, he gets even after  learning kung-fu from the Snake Fist master, played by Simon Yuen. the  Eagle Claw master / main villian is played by Hwang Jang Lee, one of the  best screen fighters ever. Tino Wong also does some excellent fighting as  the arrogant county kung-fu champion. Beautifully choreographed fights and  a fair amount of laughs make this a must for any Jackie fan.",916099200,4,921,4.772151898734177
