The documentary uses no cheesy reenactments because Rockefeller lived during the era of TV and film.  Almost all episodes of the ""Biography"" series interview biographers and living relatives.  This did the same, but also included President Ford and Rockefeller's staff members.  It is repeated the he was liberal for a Republican, but they never actually said what he did, if anything, in order to promote civil rights, women's rights, or environmentalism.

Like the Kennedys and Queen Elizabeth's progeny, Rockefeller was a jack of many trades.  Like Jeb Bush, he had an interest in Latin America.  Everyday people may related to him for two reasons.  First, like Bruce Jenner, Ozzie Osborne, and many others, he was dyslexic before the condition was named and cured.  Secondly, one of his sons died.  Those who have outlived a child may relate.

In our post-stained blue dress era, it is easy to forget that MANY powerful men had or have mistresses.  It was not just Democrats (Clinton, JFK, FDR); here a Republican is proven to have played the field.  It is hilarious seeing this work dance around a subject that they must bring up.  Like Bruce Lee, Rockefeller died at his mistress' house.  Still, they documentary says ""roving eye"" and ""a female not his wife.""  They never explicitly say ADULTERER or WOMANIZER.  Leave it to the Biography series to be timid and try to water things down.",1155945600,7,1578,4.996153846153846
