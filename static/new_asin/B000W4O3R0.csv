8221211,5,B000W4O3R0,I used to love to watch Peter Jennings and when he was still alive saw this video and it was done very well. There a two few many skeptics in it for my liking; however it had a lot of good information in it. Now I own it and am very pleased.,1378166400,,241,3.6538461538461537

8221213,4,B000W4O3R0,"This has excellent footage of Russian UFO sightings and interviews of prominent Russian citizens which I have never seen before on any other video or documentary.

The downside is the video is very short. It seems like it was only 15 minutes long or close to that. So be aware of this when you buy it because they don't mention it on the description or the DVD case. But also remember you are seeing a newscast without the inserted commercials so it will be much shorter than the original presentation.

The video is still very, very good and worth watching.",1198281600,5,558,4.57
