8471765,5,B005GKRCJ6,"We saw this documentary on HBO.  We sat in awe and suspense, worrying about all the pelicans, but especially 895.  The film documents the heroic efforts to save the pelicans in Louisiana after the BP Oil Spill.  Before the spill, the pelican population had finally started to come back after years of decline due to pesticide use.  They had just finally achieved a healthy population when the oil spill threatened to wipe out years of recovery.  The film shows the efforts of biologists and volunteers to rescue and rehabilitate as many pelicans as they could collect.  It centers on one pelican, number 895, and highlights the struggle for the little guy to survive.  The challenges faced by both the pelicans and rescuers are many, and it was inspiring to see how these problems were overcome.  We loved this film so much, we bought the DVD and also gave it as gifts to family.  I highly recommend this video for anyone, but especially those concerned with the critters who have no voice but are affected by our actions, good or bad.",1350345600,,1035,4.705555555555556
