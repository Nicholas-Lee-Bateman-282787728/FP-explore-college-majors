8749706,5,B01B8PTG9G,What a wonderful DVD.  Quite obviously the audience also enjoyed this memorable concert.,1500681600,,88,5.769230769230769
8749707,2,B01B8PTG9G,It's hard to know what to say because often too little information is given about the pieces that appear on the program of this and many of the other musical DVDs and blu-rays available from Amazon.,1492646400,,198,4.527777777777778
8749708,5,B01B8PTG9G,"A delightful series of performances, two Argetinians with enormous talent and extensive experience collaborating for a peak musical adventure. The camera work and editing made for a seamless work; and the quality of the images of this regular DVD is top notch, better than some of the blue ray releases of older films. Watching Martha Argerich play was inspiring--old hands dancing over the keys, nimble, nuanced and oh so precise. Daniel Barenboim, the conductor, enthusiastically led the orchestra as Argerich flowed through Beethoven's first concerto for piano, then joined her for two-piano pieces, his smaller hands none the less moving over the keyboard with confidence and skill. The terribly enthusiastic audience all but shouted ""GOAL"" for the performances.  Much to be appreciated about this two DVD set.",1466812800,3,814,5.409448818897638
8749709,5,B01B8PTG9G,"This pair of DVDs brings together two universally popular pianists who have known each other since they were both children in Buenos Aires in Argentina as 7 and 8 year olds. Curiously they never played music together at that time though and that situation has remained almost entirely the case until this particular concert recorded in August in 2014 shortly after the previous concert recorded in Berlin in April 2014. ('It was not until the 1980's, when Barenboim was music director of the Orchestra de Paris, that Argerich did a series of dates' with Barenboim as conductor. 'It was also in Paris, during roughly the same period, that Barenboim and Argerich finally gave a four handed recital together for the first time.' - sleeve note quotes).

The Berlin concert from April 2014 features the Mozart, Schubert and Stravinsky pieces also to be found on this August recording. It is also available as a very good Blu-ray option as well as DVD. This newer recording offers an enlarged chamber concert plus a complete orchestral concert which is also a very notable occasion. Although clearly recorded in HD there are no plans to issue it as a Blu-ray as Blu-ray discs have not sold in sufficient quantities to justify their production. However, so long as a suitably longer viewing distance is available, viewers will find that the DVD will not lack sharpness visually and the sound is excellent at any distance. The sound is presented in surround 5.1 (Dolby and DTS) for the orchestral concert and 5.0 (Dolby and DTS) for the chamber concert.

There is not a lot of difference in the cost between the two options available for collectors but there is a considerable difference in content and playing time. There are also differences in performances. Those differences are what this review is about.

DVD 2 contains the identical three piano duo works, Mozart, Schubert and Stravinsky, found on the previous Berlin concert disc. However it plays for far longer, 120 minutes, and the extra items are Schumanns Andante and Variations for two pianos in the original version including 2 cellos and a French horn plus extra encore pieces written for piano duo by Rachmaninov, Gustavino and Milhaud.

There can be no doubt that this second version of the Berlin concert is a more joyous and relaxed affair with both pianists apparently free of the stresses of the d&eacute;but nature of the earlier concert. This is not just apparent in the way that the music comes over with far more spontaneity but it also shows in the exchanged shared glances of mutual pleasure. The impression is of faster performances therefore, but comparisons of playing times per movement shows the reverse to be true in all but one movement. Thus we have slower performances so much more at ease that they seem fleeter which is not what one would expect.

DVD1 contains a performance of Beethovens Piano concerto 1 played by Argerich who gives a sensitive rendering of the second movement and an exhilarating performance of the last movement. The Schumann encore is simply breath-taking. The concert starts with a neat performance of Mozarts Marriage of Figaro overture and an outstanding survey of Ravel after the concerto. Bolero provides a gripping display from the side-drum player who controls a faultless crescendo rising from a bare whisper and lasting over the whole 15 minutes. This sets the scene for other equally faultless solo orchestral contributions. The Rapsodie Espagnole is brim-full with atmosphere and the Alboradas central section is mesmerizingly sensitive to nuance, especially from the solo bassoon. The same sensitivity pervades the Pavane.

Bizets first Carmen Suite is played with &eacute;lan with each movement being separately applauded by the ecstatic audience. El Firulete and Tango, both favourite orchestral encores of Barenboim to be heard on previous BPO and Chicago discs, go down predictably well with the home crowd.

The venue of these two concerts, being both Argerichs and Barenboims home town of Buenos Aires, is an important factor clearly influencing the extreme success of these two concerts. At all points it is obvious that the home crowd is loving every minute and every sound. The musicians inevitably respond by rising to the occasion and excelling themselves. This is why the earlier Blu-ray Berlin concert has been replaced with this pair of DVDs as library references.

In summary, this new pair of DVD discs more than trumps the earlier Berlin concert even at the cost of not being Blu-ray. They are simply more rewarding.",1460419200,8,4549,5.047936085219707
