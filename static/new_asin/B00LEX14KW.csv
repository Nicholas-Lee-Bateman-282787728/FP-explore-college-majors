6481803,3,B00LEX14KW,I found some interest in it. This film has some funny moments. Its OK I Guess,1406851200,5,77,3.875
6481804,5,B00LEX14KW,"I was reluctant to watch this, but it definitely surpassed my expectations! The actors/actresses all played wonderful roles and I had no problem believing what was going on. In too many of these films we are forced to endure cheesy acting at best. Luckily, this is not the case here. James Townsend holds his reputation to a higher standard than most, and for that we all benefit, Awesome production line equals awesome product!  I look forward to his next film! =)~",1406678400,2,466,4.753086419753086

6481806,1,B00LEX14KW,"Has to be one of the absolute worst movies I have every watched, and I have watched some real bad movies.  The story line is typical slasher movie - I'm okay with that.  The acting and the script are horrible, to the point of being painful to watch.  Save your money and your time.",1405987200,10,281,4.166666666666667
6481807,5,B00LEX14KW,"LOVED THIS MOVIE SEAN PAUL LOCKHART AND THE SCENE STEALING RONNIE KROELL WITH JAMES TOWNSEND,NICK AIRUS WITH DANIEL BERILLA ALSO KYLE BLITCH AND SEAN BENEDICT A GOOD CAMPY HORROR STORY",1405296000,3,184,5.166666666666667
6481808,5,B00LEX14KW,This is a excellent horror movie.,1404864000,2,33,4.666666666666667
6481809,5,B00LEX14KW,"What a journey it has been from start to finish! After several attempts at production, the film was finally made with an awesome cast. The result is a nice horror-comedy full of fun, humor and sexiness.
Be sure to leave  review and let us know what you think...",1404432000,13,261,4.4375
6481810,5,B00LEX14KW,"Loved this movie!!! I may be biased I was in it lol, campy with some comedic humor makes all the difference in a gay horror movie. Buy it now, you won't be disappointed, We had an amazing time filming this movie and can't wait for everybody to see it :)

6481814,3,B00LEX14KW,"I gave this an okay for 2 reasons. The first is that I love Sean Paul Lockhart and this seems to have been one of his earlier movies and I think he was still getting his acting legs. The second, hotties galore! Except for the blonde, way over the top screamer, he was simply annoying. The bad things in this movie...so many. They had to apparently throw in a woman as some kind of vampires temptress, first of all, none of these boys would have been interested at all and second aren't temptresses supposed to be at least mildly attractive? Not at all for this one she falls way short. As to the story....yeah, not much of one at all. Lots of boys without shirts and that is about it. Go to the beach instead.",1419033600,6,709,4.2592592592592595

6481818,1,B00LEX14KW,"OMG Ronnie Kroell can't act!! This movie has nothing going for it...bad writing, directing, acting and plot.  Save your money boys, this is one boring movie!",1411862400,4,157,5.038461538461538
6481819,1,B00LEX14KW,Amazon should pay YOU to watch it.  Terrible movie.,1411689600,5,51,4.666666666666667
6481820,1,B00LEX14KW,"30 minutes in and I couldn't take it anymore.  Horrible acting, horrible production, horrible movie.  I would have gotten more satisfaction from flushing $3.00 down the toilet than renting this movie.",1410652800,5,200,5.419354838709677

8665518,1,B00LEX14KW,"gets one star for eye candy, but that's it.  acting terrible. story not great, is the woman in it supposed to be a demon or a vampire,  get your story straight before you make a film.  give it a pass.",1515801600,,200,3.95
8665519,1,B00LEX14KW,"It looked like it might have some kind of low-budget potential, but after 25 minutes...well, let's put it this way: it reminded me that it was time to go to bed. Zzzzzzzz",1507507200,,170,4.34375
8665520,2,B00LEX14KW,"Interesting eye candy . Even if into a thriller/ sci-fi , I'd watch the trailer first. I am sorry I bought it.",1497744000,,110,4.045454545454546
8665521,1,B00LEX14KW,"Again, like  ""The Dark Place"", terrible sound.  The actors are badly in need of a dialogue coach.  Plot doesn't make much sense.  Weird things happen, then there's no follow-up.  One evening they trash the cabin and next morning it's sparkling clean.  Who cleaned it up - Cinderella?
This movie belongs to the genre:  ""Let's make a horror movie in my father's garage.""",1493510400,,368,4.838709677419355

8665523,5,B00LEX14KW,"I had a wonderful time watching this film! What fun!! Who really cares about the story line when you can watch Sean Paul Lockhart and Ronnie Kroell running wild in the woods! Don't expect anything too deep, or for it to change your life; just pop a bowl of popcorn, sit back, and enjoy!",1475280000,,286,4.314814814814815
8665524,2,B00LEX14KW,"Here is another movie that had the potential of being good; however, just like other before it this movie fell flat., Don't waste your time in watching. If you are curious and wish to watch use prime video by signing up or find a way to watch it for free. This movie is not worth spending money on it.",1468108800,,301,4.11864406779661
