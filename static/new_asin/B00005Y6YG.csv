7956370,4,B00005Y6YG,"It was a little short, did not get the length and breadth of his life.  Missed out on a lot.  Great from 1936 to the 90's, full of good videos, some new to me.  I would recommend for someone who does not know much about Joe D",1382227200,,225,3.74468085106383
7956371,5,B00005Y6YG,Joe D was a hero to my mother and father's generation--especially to the Italian community. This bio goes beyond his superb performance on the diamond and reveals the man with all phases of his life.,1381708800,,199,4.714285714285714
7956372,5,B00005Y6YG,"EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT A YANKEE FAN I THINK YOU'LL LIKE THIS DVD.JOLTIN' JOE DIMAGGIO SONG IS GREAT AS SIMON & GARFUNKLE'S WHERE HAVE YOU GONE,JOE DIMAGGIO? IS NICE TOO! MOST OF THE PLAYERS OF THAT ERA WERE USUALLY WITH THEIR TEAMS FOR THEIR ENTIRE CAREER.IT'S TOO BAD THE TEAM OWNERS DIDN'T SHARE THEIR PROFITS WITH  THE PLAYERS WHO GENERATED THE CROWDS. IF THE OWNERS WERE MORE FLEXIBLE THERE WOULDN'T BE FREE AGENCY,THE RUINATION OF A GREAT SPORT. IT'S VERY HARD TO IDENTIFY WITH A TEAM THAT'S ALWAYS IF A STATE OF FLUX.IF YOU A FAN OF OLDD TIME MLB THIS DVD IS A MUST.",1282176000,2,568,4.40952380952381
7956373,3,B00005Y6YG,"I was looking for a video of the yankees with Di Maggio in actual play.  This has a few clips of the games, but nothing spectacular.  NBC and CBS both filmed the all-star games in the late 30's and 40's, but they aren't making moves to release them.  All we have of the old days are stories.  Someone should find the game films and put them out.  I'll buy one or two a month.",1224115200,3,375,4.013513513513513
