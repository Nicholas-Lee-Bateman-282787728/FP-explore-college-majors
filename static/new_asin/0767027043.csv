But the thing that always irks me about these documentaries is that it will show you a little clip of a great performance and then switch to something else. That's how people start to develop ADD, when you have so many things flashing past you that you can't pay attention to any one thing for more than three seconds and you lose your ability to pay attention to anything. I would've liked to have seen the whole clip of Tony Clifton singing ""I Will Survive"" but it got all chopped up. I would've liked to have seen Foreign Man perform all of his ""Kiss Kiss Kiss"" song but that got cut down too and it makes for rather frustrating viewing. But any Andy is better than no Andy so you can't go wrong buying this.",1059609600,2,762,4.2620689655172415

7788811,5,0767027043,"This is an AWESOME video about the ""life and times"" of Any Kaufman.  I've watched it so many times, I may need to buy another copy.  If there is anything you needed to know about Andy, its in this video,  A&E really did do a wonderful job on it.  From his childhood, up until  the day he ""died"", its all covered.  If you want to know what  went on in Andy Kaufmans head, this is it.",963532800,4,382,3.9473684210526314
