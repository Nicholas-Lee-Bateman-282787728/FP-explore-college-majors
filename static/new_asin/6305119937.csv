971816,5,6305119937,"I think this is a great video. I love the show Touched by an angel. Wynonna was the icing on the cake. She is such a great actress. (It must run in the family.) Any how, enough about her. I thought it was a sweet  show in general. The roles were cast perfectly. The show had no glitches as  far as I was concerned.",919036800,,314,3.890625
971817,5,6305119937,"The cast, writers, and crew of Touched By An Angel, are to be commended for transposing a powerful screenplay into a realistic television drama.  The actors and storyline transport the audience into a world where Faith  and values mean more than money and power.
We all face issues that  force us make choices that test our Faith and values.  Hopefully, we learn  from our mistakes and grow in Wisdom.  The story promotes values that  transcend religion ... they are the Truth that all men need to know in  order to find Peace and Happiness while struggling along life's  journey.
""What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose  his own soul ... ""
Such Biblically-based concepts are so artfully  woven into the script and represent a penetrating modernization of not  necessarily the language but the impact of hearing the Gospel  message.
Tied so powerfully to Richard Gere's film, Red Corner, the issue  of basic human rights is developed by the episode beyond Chinese policies  forcing each of us to look and decide how what we do affects the people  around us.
Bai Ling's performance was powerfully moving in both, Red  Corner, and in, Spirit of Liberty Moon.  I can only congratulate her for  the idea of Spirit of Liberty Moon, and CBS and the producers of Touched By  An Angel for investing in such high-quality programming.  Our country and  our people can only benefit from such uplifting and dramatically  entertaining viewing experiences.

971904,5,6305119937,I enjoyed watching how the series started out with Monica assigned to a child but she decides that finding his mother is more important and almost blows the case. Also Tess gets her car. The 100th episode is very emotional about a boy with cystic fibrosis who has a list that he wants to complete before he dies. Also he wants his mom to be cared for.,1330387200,,351,4.253731343283582
971905,5,6305119937,this episode is very touching and at times hard to watch. It is about a woman who left China just after the incident in 1989 and she has to choose whether to go back and risk her life to help the company she is working for.  Also she has to find the courage to stand up for the wrong that is still happening in her country. It is very moving and emotional to see this episode.,1330387200,,376,3.9473684210526314
971906,5,6305119937,in this the first episode is about Monica telling the story of Samuel Clemens (more commonly known as Mark Twain) at Christmas in 1909.  The second episode is about Monica losing everything to help an man who lives on the streets and needs to accept help from other people. This episode is very touching showing what happens to those who fall through the cracks.,1330387200,,362,4.65625

Winona Judd gives a believable performance as a single Mum and struggling singer/song writer. Her son is dealing with a terminal illness and is doing everything possible to help his mother write a song. This is a great episode for those who have never watched the show before and for those who don't quite ""believe."" There is a cameo by Celine Dion which doesn't add much to the story. This is my favourite by far and one for the collector.",1122163200,,529,4.520833333333333
971981,5,6305119937,I loved this episode! I collect all the videos of this series and watched them with my children on Sundays. We just watched The Spirit of Liberty Moon today and I still cry! very moving! I can honestly say there isn't to many episodes I don't like.,1036886400,4,248,4.297872340425532
971982,5,6305119937,"I came away from watching Spirit... with a feelling of hope for China.  While  the program is not one that ends happily for everyone, it does leave me  hopeful. Change is unsettling and change in China has been tremendous and  not always positive for everyone.  There are important points to be learned  from this program about life in China, as lived by it's citizens that it is  important to consider.  The sense of inevitability once Jean enters the  legal system is chilling and the helplessness of all concerned to change  the outcome is especially moving.  At the conclusion, you can look back and  see the impact that Jean has had on the people she has come in contact  with; her boss in America, his slightly frantic partner who also has felt  the touch of Jean, and her former partner in freedom in China who while  outwardly conforming, is still harboring thoughts of improving China from  within.  All of them have been influenced by her.  I found this program to  be one of hope for China, both now and over the long haul.  TBAA has taken a difficult subject,  shown it objectively and left us with the feeling that there is more to  China than the pronouncements of those in power.  This has been a hard  review to write because I could see the conflict within China today yet  remember the days of the Cultural Revolution and the turmoil that resulted.  It is a clash of dreams and reality.  Things are not perfect but the are better than they were.  The Spirit of Liberty  Moon shows an evolving progress that is far from complete.  Thank  you.

Now in 2007 see China struggling with many changes that might have only been imagined when Liberty Moon was written and filmed.  The government is struggling to minimize dissent.  It has impossed severe penalties for non-conformity.  Yet China is different.  I've been to the country twice and it seems to reinforce what Gus was saying which it's better than it was.  Remember China by any measurement is still learning the ropes of being a capitalist society which is what it is evovling into.  It may take a generation before this constant class of ideas resolves itself.  In the meantime the country is evolving and slowly making progress even if westerners are impatient for it to reach the level of the west.  I counsel patience and that is what I took away from the film.",968976000,4,2338,4.621026894865525
971983,5,6305119937,I watched this video and found it to be not only heart warming but it  showed more love then any parent could. This video deals with death in a way  that can only leave you crying for hours. It was an excellent video and I  recomend it.,965952000,,236,3.978723404255319
971984,5,6305119937,Randy Travis does a really great job in this heartwarming episode.  Be prepared for tears.  It's about a man (randy travis) who's wife falls off a horse.  He has to decide whether to give her heart to a dying 15 year old  heart patient.  A Christmas Miracle is equally good.  No TBAA fan will be  disappointed.,962841600,5,310,4.428571428571429
972007,5,6305119937,"This episode of Touched by an Angel was the most incredible one I've seen yet! Wynonna is not only an amazing singer, but also an unbelievable actress.

972009,5,6305119937,"What can I say about this?  Psalm 151 happens to be my favorite episode.  It is funny and sad at times.  It is also filled with uplifting music (a.k.a. ""Testify To Love and ""Love Can Move Mountains"".)  ""Southbound Bus"" is also a good starting episode especially for  those who had never seen the TV show before.  Also a great edition is the  CD of ""Touched By An Angel.""",958694400,,370,4.352941176470588
972010,5,6305119937,"I was watching Touched by an Angel one day and the show with Wynnona was on. I wouldn't normally watch a show like this. But the reason I did is because I love Wynnona, and she rocks so I thought I'd check it out. What I  watched was the most breath-taking show I had ever seen. I have seen  Wynnona in concert and I've seen her caring side, but Wow she did a  terrific job. I especially think she didn't have to play that much of a big  part as being a caring mom. One reason is because she already gets that  from her mom Naomi. But way to go for the cast and especially Wynnona YOU  GO GIRL!",954288000,2,594,3.9495798319327733
972011,5,6305119937,"My daughter passed away in Dec. of 1999 with the same illness as Petey, we were deeply moved by the movie and cried every time we watched it. We love Wynonnas songs and Celines. Testify to  Love was played at my daughters  funeral, it was her testimony. This movie and songs is truly a blessing.  Thank you.

972012,5,6305119937,"My faith is something I have been stuggling with forever, but God keeps pulling through.  When I watched this episode and heard the song, Testify To Love by Wyonna, I was once again reminded of the awsome power and love  of God.  I came here wanting to buy this episode because I wanted to have  it as a constant reminder of God's love and inspiration.  I'm also going to  buy the Cd for the song because everytime I hear that song I am reminded of  how powerful faith is and just how much God loves us -- and how thankful I  should be.  I watched this with four other girls on my floor (in my  university residence) and by the end they were all in tears.  Two of the  girls, who owned the tape, had seen it several times and still they cry  when they see it.  One of the girls was crying only five minutes into it,  and by the end my don was crying too.  I know when I watch this by myself I  will be crying too because it was very hard to hold the tears back with  them.  I can not honestly say wether I wanted to cry because it was sad, or  because once again I was reminded of how amazing God can be.  It was  probably a bit of both, but I do not want to forget that feeling.  This  episode and the song brings out genuine emotion and it serves as an amazing  reminder.  The power of love is something we should never underestimate,  and I pray that ""For as long as I shall live/ I will testify to love/  I'll be a witness in the silences/ when words are not enough/ With every  breath I take/ I will give thanks to God above/ For as long as I shall  live/ I will testify to love.",952819200,2,1584,3.9680511182108624

972014,5,6305119937,"I just started watching TBAA last season. When I saw the 100th episode I cried for half an hour afterward. To see Petey's mom up there singing God's praise when her son just died made me think about my faith in God. I fell  in love with the song ""Testify to Love"" and just received the cd  'A Maze of Grace' by the Christian group Avalon which contains the song.",946166400,3,362,4.1571428571428575

972124,5,6305119937,"""touched by an angel"" was so aptly named, for this show ,more than any in television history, has touched so many lives...and this, their 100th episode, is no exception. ""psalms 151"" is one of the finest  moments in television history and i'm very glad the producers had the  wisdom to release it on video. Special guest Wynonna gives a beautifully  heart-wrenching performance as a mother of a dying child. After this, maybe  Ashley won't be the only acting judd in the house. Ben Cross, of the film  ""Wide Awake"", gives another splendid performance, and of course,  roma downey & della reese give their usual angelic displays. But the one  who always seems to be forgotten, is given a prime example of his  extroidinary prescence. John Dye, who plays the angel Andrew, is  spotlighted quite a bit in this episode, and for those, who in the past,  have ignored his contribution, you won't ever again. his performance alone  will have you cryin'. But make sure to bring along a couple of extra boxes  of tissues, because the writing is so beautiful, and the directing is so  magnificant, with subtle moments that are so poignant, you will be just a  ball of wet by the end.
