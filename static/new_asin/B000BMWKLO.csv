This DVD is the movie version of the TV series and appears to have been compiled from the TV scripts with a bit of the play thrown in.  The TV series was based upon a stage play, ""The Banana Boat"" and the play and this movie both contain a touching insight into the life of the African Chieftan's son that was omitted from the TV series.  The most striking difference in this movie is the setting.  We see Rigsby's home from the outside and it is a row house rather than the detached home of the TV series.  It is also in a much better neighborhood.  The interiors are bright and roomy, unlike the dark, cramped quarters to which we have become accustomed.  The most striking change, however, is the absence of Richard Beckinsale, who declined to appear in the movie.  He is replaced by Christopher Strauli of ""Only When I Laugh"" fame.  Mr. Strauli does a good job with the role.  The rest of the cast remains intact.  I found this movie version of the series quite enjoyable, unlike the sad attempts of many other British TV shows to create big-screen versions of their series, this one succeeds on it's own.  If one had never seen the series, one could still enjoy this movie.

Please note that the British DVD sold on this page requires a region-free DVD player capable of playing a PAL disk. It will not play on a standard U. S. DVD player/recorder. If you like British TV, you can pick up an inexpensive region-free player on Amazon.",1191196800,2,1622,4.420875420875421
