8519379,5,B007LKMC58,"This is one of many studio recitals recorded without an audience ( no applauses nor obtrussive audience noises)wich became fashionable in the 1950's and 60's,so we have the studio quality (probably edited,like music recordings)without the annoying sneezing/coughing background of live/public performances. Collectors will find some of the greatest artists from the era videotaped under this conditions (Rubinstein,Heifetz,Segovia,Michelangeli etc).During the last decades we have Horowitz recorded in is own living room. Except for Beethoven's Op. 111(1960),all performances in this video date from 1959. According to the included insert there is a gap of 2-4 months between the videotaping and the actual TV broadcasts. Like on other Arrau studio video releases for EMI (1964,1970) and VAI (Canadian TV,1964),we get the advantage of better close-ups and less hyperkinetic
cameramen/editors (in contrast with those wich recorded Arrau's Beethovenfest recital of 1970).
Since Arrau performs 2 Beethoven sonatas (Op. 57 and Op. 111) wich are already available on video in various Arrau releases( 1970 and 1983 for the Op. 57,and 1964,1970 (twice) and 1977 for the Op. 111),prospective buyers may hesitate on paying full price for a video wich lasts only 83 minutes in total (including the Van Cliburn's recital).
Here are the reasons: Everything you saw or heard or read about Arrau's legendary 1970 Beethovenfest recital (Classic Archive) is even more valid on these performances: Arrau at his technical and interpretative peak (he was 56 and 57 years old respectevly ),and in spite of having a silent audience (possibly invited guests only),his passion,demeanor and poise fit the description from those who have written about the difference between his live and studio recordings. His technique cannot be described with words. There are moments of ferocious intensity and speed alternating with sublime pathos in the Op. 111 that are not found in the other videos. He appears to be in total control of the technical and musical challenges. If you were to turn the sound off,his body mechanics by themselvesf would mesmerize you with their beauty,like those of a gracious ballerina. So,here is the graphic memory you want to keep of the artist at his peak.
In respect to the Van Cliburn's Chopin pieces,they are  performed well but a bit average and monochromatic. The 3rd Ballade is played too carefully. Granted that Van Cliburn was only 24 years old then,but his art was best heard on Rachmaninov and Tchaikovsky. It doesn't help him being matched beside a fully developped master of the keyboard",1383955200,5,2598,5.383292383292384
