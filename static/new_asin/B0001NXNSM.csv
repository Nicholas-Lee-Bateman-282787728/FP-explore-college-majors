2021055,5,B0001NXNSM,"Fans of Rob Zombie won't be disappointed, as our man continues his march into the world of cinematic horror, a welcome move, and long overdue. Features on Clive Barker & history's #1 effects man Stan Winston also delight. And the new guys! This dvd rocks. Check out BC Furtney's Mister Eryams and Chip Gubera's Song of the Dead, two stand-outs on this all-around great disc.",1081641600,,374,4.769230769230769
2021074,3,B0001NXNSM,"...but with all that's out there, could such a thing actually exist?  In my opinion, it's not a matter of whether or not it's been done (which it has), but rather how well it's done.

That said, there is a limit on how many times I can see, read, or hear the same story, and I was way past my limit on the ghost's revenge story before I saw ""The Hitch,"" a film too bad to even laugh at.  The actor playing the driver is pretty good, but the actress playing the hitch hiker is attrocious, although in her defense, the writer didn't give her much to work with.

Another one I'd like to pick on is ""Shadows of the Dead.""  The problem here isn't so much that the virus-that-turns-people-into-zombies idea has been done too many times, but that it's a stupid idea to begin with.

My favorite in this batch is ""Mr. Eryams,"" and that's not just because it has a mostly naked young woman rolling around on a bed (although that certainly doesn't hurt).  It's a genuinely chilling ghost story.  Yes, it is reminicent of ""The Sixth Sense"" (some of you are going to disagree with me on that, but I'm right, so bring it on), but without the bloated pomposity M. Night Shyamalan's films always seem to have.

""Disturbances"" comes in second on my list, even if it is a tad predictable.  I also liked ""Song of the Dead,"" which, I must say, isn't scary by any stretch of the imagination, but is entertaining.

I'll surely earn myself some hatred for saying this, but ""A Boy and His Finger"" is nothing more than a one-note gag taken way too far, and the gag really isn't all that funny.

But even if it were, aren't these supposed to be horror movies?",1107475200,,1633,4.353135313531353
2021075,4,B0001NXNSM,"Well, what I mean by that is that there are a few directors on here that have amazing potential and overall I think the Fangoria ""Blood Drive"" could become an amazing series of dvds to be released each year. Let me break down for you, straight to the point for each story:

The Hitch - Starts off interesting but very unoriginal and silly in it's horrible cliched tale of morality. Horrible acting.

A Boy and his Finger - Cute and clever, works great as a ""breather"" in between the more scarier short films. Funny yet creepy story about a boy who keeps his finger as a pet.

Inside - This is where things start to get really really good. This short films is really frightening and well done, has incredibly stylish editing and photography. Not very straightforward but that helps the story if anything.

Shadow of the Dead - In my own opinion the best short film on here. Great acting, great effects, amazing sense of atmosphere and did I mention it actually scared me? A strange take on a zombie-ridden world that is completely devoid of silliness and campiness.

Mr. Eryams - This one is good as well but moreso for acting and dialogue. Pretty stylish and the colours are reminiscent of ""Suspiria"" but overall doesn't compete with the past two entries.

Disturbance - Again, somewhat interesting and stylish piece with no dialogue but does not stand up in comparison the last three entries.

Song of the Dead - Shortest one of them all, funny and tongue-in-the-cheek, but please we've all seen a musical/horror film, it's been done. Back to the drawing board chaps.

Overall, it's worth getting this dvd just for the middle three films. Especially if you are a HUGE horror fan like myself and you want to get into filmmaking becaues it gives you an idea of what you can do with a low budget. This is great and I hope they come out with better ones each other!",1094083200,3,1862,4.57057057057057
2021076,3,B0001NXNSM,"Well, not bad for film students. You can tell that all of these people put a lot of effort into their films with varying results. However, filmmaking is not the Special Olympics, and I can't see any justification in a price over 10 dollars since god knows StarLog/Fangoria isn't paying anybody one red cent in royalties. I also think this DVD was a little bit mis-billed. Rob Zombie's only appearant involvement was to show up in the DVD menus for about 60 seconds of blurb-level ""ignore the man behind the curtain"" discourse. Some of the special features were actually interesting, but again not sufficient compensation in consideration of the price.

Not bad, but then not particularly good, either.",1093910400,,701,4.940677966101695
2021077,3,B0001NXNSM,"Blood Drive is a collection of short horror films made by regular people complied by Fangoria magazine.  Supposedly only the best were used, but I find it hard to believe after viewing all of them.  There are some very good films in the batch (""The Hitch"" comes to mind as does ""Inside"") and some not so good films (""Song of the Zombie"" stands out).  For a so-so collection of horror shorts, this one is worth viewing.",1089763200,,418,4.473684210526316
2021078,1,B0001NXNSM,"Don't know what happened to my first review but here is a second one to sum it up: Very, VERY low budget, boring (I fell asleep and I wasn't even tired), stupid (when you get to the finger skit, you'll see what I mean) Rob zombie should have never put his name on this, neither should have Clive barker. They obviously got their names to hype it into what its not. If you like b, better yet z-horror home videos, maybe this is for you, the first sequences is ok, the rest....well you'll see. You've been warned!!! Anyone that would give this 5 stars has to be one of the low budget morons that did one of these films.",1088467200,,617,4.19327731092437
2021079,4,B0001NXNSM,"This is a compilation of 7 short horror movies. they are all pretty good and would not be surprised if they were made into feature length films. my personal favorites were disturbances, inside, and the hitch. like another reviewer said scenes stay with you after you have shut off the dvd.",1086998400,,289,4.686274509803922
2021080,4,B0001NXNSM,"After picking up the Blood Drive at Tower, I was skeptical of the concept, expecting nothing more than amateur shorts and sophmoric gore fest. Although not all are stellar, I was surprised at the overall quality.  Some of the films could even be described as elegant.  The images in ""Shadows of the Dead"" and ""Disturbances"" will linger with you long after you have shut off the DVD player.  ""Mr. Eryams"" and ""Inside"" have well developed story lines and great twists, especially for shorts.  The bonus features round out the package nicely and give it good value.  I wouldn't be suprised to see one of these directors get a break in the near future.",1086912000,,648,4.699115044247788
2021081,5,B0001NXNSM,Film-maker Joel Robertson's love of the zombie genre shines through in this frightening and haunting short film. A must-see for horror fans!,1082332800,,140,5.409090909090909

8015355,1,B0001NXNSM,"This was one of the worse collection of short horror films I have ever seen. I am a novelist and horror short story writer and I was disappointed with this collection. I have also seen nearly 10,000 horror films and have seen some really raw and horrible stuff. On this collection the first two shorts were the best it had to offer. Then came the one called Inside which made absolute no sense at all. Shadows of the Dead felt rushed and didn't follow a story with a horrible ending. Mr. Eryams also rushed and stupid ending. It started off interesting but quickly lost its appeal. Disturbances was alright, but it really lacked. Forget Song of the Dead, I'm still trying to forget it. I wonder who actually picked these winners anyway. Oh well, this one goes on my trash pile. Good thing I got it for a quarter.",1402704000,,812,4.456375838926174

8015357,1,B0001NXNSM,"I think I fell for the cool cover art and the famous names.  This was just a collection of fairly bad films submitted to Fangoria magazine.  If you make your own home movies you might enjoy it, but I was disappointed.",1229817600,,217,4.2682926829268295
8015358,3,B0001NXNSM,Lots of fun if you don't take it too seriously. Not scary at all and lacks real suspense but someone had a lot of fun with a handheld camera and a quart of fake blood!,1194307200,,167,3.8
8015359,2,B0001NXNSM,"My husband & I rented this movie because we love the horror genre & thought we might be in for a good scare. No such luck in that department. We did laugh a lot, though. We actually made a joke of reccommending this DVD to our friends just so we wouldn't be the only one's who wasted our money. The plotlines were mostly terrible. The story about the boy who cuts off his finger is the worst piece of crap I've ever seen. That one wasn't even funny. Seriously, though, go rent it anyway if you want to laugh. Oh, and sidenote, Rob Zombie should be ashamed for promoting this. Bad Rob!",1134259200,2,584,4.223214285714286
