1668745,5,B00005UW7Z,What made this movie so great in my opinion?  Two words:  Ally Sheedy.  She is one of my favorite actors.  Great storyline and I loved the ending.,1361577600,,146,4.296296296296297
1668746,5,B00005UW7Z,"The Bastard Song
Written by Adrienne Shelly & Andrew Hollander
(from the movie I'll Take You There)

It's a world of suffering
In a sea of pain.
No matter how much sun you bring
You're pummeled by the rain.

So what's the use in getting up
And what's the use in tryin'?
And what's the use in listening
When everybody's lyin'?

Don't let the heartless get you down.
Don't greet the heartless at your door.
Don't live among the heartless.

The life you lead just turns to shit.
Your joy it falls to treason.
There isn't any rhyme to it
There isn't any reason.

Don't let the bastards get you down.
Don't greet the bastards at your door.
Don't live among the bastards.

In this dead-end universe
Where there seems to be no grace
There are heavens on the map
There are humans in the race
There are people you can trust
When you need some decency
You can trust someone like you
You can trust someone like me.

Don't let the strangers get you down.
Don't greet the strangers at your door.
Don't live among the strangers
My friend.

Don't live among the strangers
The heartless
The bastards
My love...",1361404800,5,1094,4.407960199004975
1668747,5,B00005UW7Z,"I just finished watching this extremely enjoyable and inventive (the flashback sequences are easily some of the BEST that I've ever seen integrated into a feature film!!) romantic-comedy earlier today -- and couldn't wait to rave about it!!! If it wasn't written with Ally Sheedy in mind (much the way ""The Breakfast Club"" evidently was), it might as well have been, because Sheedy's arguably at her absolute most endearing and sympathetic here (playing a ""broken"" woman who not only finds solace and strength ultimately from a man she really shouldn't even want to TALK to ever again -- and he, just as surprisingly, finding plenty of solace and strength in her in return).

Anyone who even momentarily doubts the unceasingly smart writing AND directing instincts of the late Adrienne Shelly -- who, sadly, was murdered at age 40 (in 2006, in her Manhattan apartment) by a 19-year-old illegal immigrant from Ecuador: read more about Shelly at Wikipedia) -- definitely needs to watch ""I'll Take You There"" ... as well as Shelly's similarly-endearing ""Waitress"" and also ""Serious Moonlight"" (the latter adroitly directed by ""Suburgatory""/""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" actress Cheryl Hines).

The acting, photography, music (Shelly even co-wrote some of the movie's songs -- just as she did for ""Waitress"" and a number of her other low-budget, people-oriented cinematic gems) and the rest of the film's aspects are all first-rate, with profuse kudos, especially, to the actress and actor who play Sheedy's grandmother and grandmother's boyfriend, respectively. Those two all by themselves are MORE than enough reason to rent, or even buy (I did the latter), this superb movie. A++++++++",1339545600,5,1677,5.277153558052435
1668748,4,B00005UW7Z,"""I'll take you there"" is another good seriously playful film by Adrienne Shelly. It ranks right up there with ""Waitress,"" and ""Sudden Manhattan."" Ally Sheedy does a good job as in most of the films with her starring in them. The story is a little vague in my head, but remember it being a good love story, much like ""Waitress."" It's a pretty serious film with some funny moments and has all the touches of Shelly, humor, satire, awkward love, nerdiness, playfulness, etc. Not sure if this helps as a reccomm<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-ll-Take-You-There/dp/B001II10N4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I'll Take You There</a>endation, but if you are a Shelly fan, give it a try. I guess none of her films that she directed are as strong as her acting in Hal Hartley's work, but they are enjoyable none the less. ""I'll take you there"" is one of those films which might not stick with you for long, but all the better to watch it again at some point. Shelly said ""she just wants people to have fun,"" and this comes through in all of her work. She was an outstanding person and is missed. I give it four stars, and it's a bargain for the price, and it's a good sleeper. Nuff' said. Enjoy.",1334361600,,1221,4.875
1668749,5,B00005UW7Z,"I rented this movie after seeing WAITRESS, Adrienne Shelley's last film.  I think I like I'LL TAKE YOU THERE even better than WAITRESS!  Both are terrific!  I am ordering I'LL TAKE YOU THERE right now, so that I can have my own copy.  It is a quirky, creative, charming, fun, movie with an interesting mix of songs (but no soundtrack available apparently.)  Adrienne Shelley co wrote the main song for this movie, as she also did for WAITRESS.  This is a movie that will take you off guard!  Lots of fun!",1208649600,5,504,4.472527472527473
1668750,4,B00005UW7Z,"In the 1930s a film like this would have been described as a ""Screwball Comedy"" -- stick-in-the mud guy who is feeling sorry for himself after his wife leaves him with his best friend meets a whacko woman who changes his life forever. In other words, a truly enjoyable film, perfect for viewing on a Friday evening.

What makes this film special are (1) a great performance by Ally Sheedy as the whacko girlfriend, and (2) the fact that the fim was directed by Adrienne Shelly, a highly promising young actress and director who had appeared in several of independent film director Hal Hartley's films. Her performance in ""Trust"" should not be missed by anyone who enjoys over-the-top black humor.

Unfortunately, her artistic promise will never be fully realized. On November 1, 2006 Diego Pillco, a 19-year-old, allegedly confessed to killing Shelly after she complained about the noise he was making in the apartment below hers. She left a grieving husband and 2-year-old daughter.

She will be missed.",1180742400,11,1004,4.964285714285714

1668752,4,B00005UW7Z,"I had never heard of this movie but it sounded interesting after reading the cover and I like Ally Sheedy.  It was such a pleasant surprise!  I laughed, I cried and I cringed, but it was very original and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I'd highly recommend it.  I will be purchasing it to add to my collection.",1093392000,,305,4.298245614035087
1668753,4,B00005UW7Z,"Sudden Manhattan may not have been much of a movie, but I enjoyed seeing Adrienne Shelly again enough to also pick up this one when it came out.  I wasn't expecting much from it.
First surprise:  Adrienne Shelly is only in the movie for a few minutes, playing our hero's brother in a bit part.  The movie belongs to Ally Sheedy.
Second surprise:  This is a terrific movie!  No longer trying to somehow assemble events and characters from her own life into 120 coherent minutes of film (with coherence the loser when this proved impossible) frees Ms. Shelly to write a good story and make it all work together.  It probably doesn't hurt that the cast is so good, but all in all, this is a better, more focused, more likable movie than even Hal Hartley has made in a few years.",1057017600,6,775,4.422535211267606

7955490,3,B00005UW7Z,"It takes a bit long to get going, but once you get on track it moves along in a predictable way.  A pleasant movie, but not one of the great ones.  You won't be sorry you spent your time viewing it if you haven't anything else to do,",1383264000,,233,3.8333333333333335
7955491,5,B00005UW7Z,I loved this movie. When I wasn't laughing I was smiling. And when it was over I was thinking about it. I would watch it again.,1375056000,,127,3.923076923076923

7955493,4,B00005UW7Z,"Great to see Ally Sheedy again, and she plays a goofy,seemingly-whacked character.  Film certainly has sufficient redemption to merit watching.",1373328000,,143,6.15
7955494,5,B00005UW7Z,"I have been a fan of Ally Sheedy  since the 70's.  This film, written and directed by Sheedy  leaves the viewer believing that there is no possibility for a happy ending until the final moments of the film.  At that point we all breathe deeply and say ""YES"".",1363737600,,258,4.3125
7955495,3,B00005UW7Z,"Take it from someone that has had more than one clinically certified insane girlfriend, Ally Sheedy's character is certifiable in this film!  I watched the whole movie because, just as in real life, some folks are just too crazy to let go of.

7955497,2,B00005UW7Z,"I'm really not sue why so many people loved this movie. I kept waiting for it to pick up, but it never really did. The entire movie focuses on this guy's wife cheating on him and then leaving him (complete with frequent flashbacks). I'll grant that Ally Sheedy's character was funny, but it really couldn't make up for the extremely depressing and bizarre plot.",1363219200,,361,4.65625
