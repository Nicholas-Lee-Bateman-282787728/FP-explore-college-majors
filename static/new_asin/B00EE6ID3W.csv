8604525,5,B00EE6ID3W,Great movie about Coptic Egypt.  You'll learn a lot that you didn't know.  As the Christians went south out of Jerusalem they left a presence in Egypt.  Learn about the hermit and monastery's history and the impact that's been brought forward to modern times.,1413158400,2,259,4.840909090909091
8604526,3,B00EE6ID3W,"This DVD, close to an hour long, is a treat to look at. We see some old desert monasteries and observe religious practices that have varied little over the centuries. We learn about the first Christian hermit and the first Christian monk. We see some beautiful religious art and architecture. We watch quite a bit of restoration work going on. I would have liked subtitles because some of the accents are hard to follow.

I had hoped to learn about the daily life of Egyptians. How the Christians got along with people of other religions throughout history and how they live side by side with their Moslem neighbors. I would have liked to see more about their homes, food, clothing, customs, boating on the Nile, education, agriculture, lives of the women. However, the DVD deals exclusively with religion. Not what I had expected.",1384646400,2,831,4.811188811188811
