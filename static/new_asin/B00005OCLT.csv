8324725,1,B00005OCLT,"This DVD (and other similarly titled Madacy offerings) is little more than a boring assemblage of news file footage strung together with narration. If all of the truly interesting parts were placed in a single presentation, there might be perhaps five minutes of worthwhile video.
The DVD is poorly and very cheaply produced, an experience I have had with all of Madacy's productions.",1075766400,5,384,5.111111111111111
