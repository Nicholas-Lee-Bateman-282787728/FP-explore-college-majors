7854810,5,630370347X,"A great comedy performance by Brett Butler, perhaps best know for her long-running TV series ""Grace Under Fire"". Great wit, polished performance. If you like funny stuff, you'll like this. A ""must see"" special performance! Get it! Se'll have a new disc out later this year.",1252713600,,273,4.956521739130435
7854811,3,630370347X,"This show is nowhere near as good as her first one, ""The child ain't right.""  I laughed a couple of times in this one but overall I didn't like it much.",1027036800,,152,3.903225806451613
