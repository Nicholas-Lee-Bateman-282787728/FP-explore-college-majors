We need more up to date fims like this showing our Native Americans in positive light and giving them the respect and honor that they deserve. Even though these films were originally used as propaganda against the United states, I find that they are now useful to provide positive image of our real americans.",1258329600,,539,4.510204081632653
8135287,4,B000GYI3KE,"As soon as I learned that there was such a thing as these ""Red Westerns"" or ""Osterns"" (from the German word for East), I knew I had to watch them, and I was not disappointed. They are somewhat heavy-handed in their cold war propaganda, and the costumes (particularly the wigs) leave something to be desired, and this combines to make the movies a bit more comedic than intended, but the acting is fine and I personally found them enjoyable movies.

The subtitles are generally well-done (readable and relatively accurate), and the dialogue is clearly spoken, so they would also be good for students of German.

If you like these you may also want to check out the Czech ""Lemonade Joe"".",1175644800,9,685,4.7
