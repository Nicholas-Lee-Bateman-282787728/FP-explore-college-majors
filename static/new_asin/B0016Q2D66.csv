3164531,5,B0016Q2D66,"Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio costar in ""Revolutionary Road"" as April and Frank Wheeler, a typical suburban couple living a typical domestic life in 1955 suburbia. To outsiders, it appears that the Wheelers have it all: a lovely house, two beautiful children, a steady income, etc. The truth of the matter is, both April and Frank are absolutely miserable. Frank is stuck in the same stupid job his father had before him, and he doesn't think April appreciates all his hard work, which causes him to seek comfort outside his marriage in the arms of one of his floozy secretaries. Meanwhile, April is bored out of her mind with being a mother and a housewife. Desperate for a change of pace, she proposes to Frank that they pack up their kids and move to Paris in order to turn their boring lives into an adventure. At first Frank is all for the idea, until he's offered a big promotion at work. Unfortunately, the change of plans doesn't sit well with April, and the Wheelers soon find their lives headed on a downward spiral of self-destruction,

""Revolutionary Road"" is based on the novel by Richard Yates, and it is an extremely good adaptation of the book. Winslet and DiCaprio both deliver the best performances of their careers so far, definitely deserving of Oscar nominations. The film is incredibly depressing but brilliantly well-done. It illustrates the importance of following your dreams before it's too late. (Also, in my opinion, it's a wonderful pro-choice film...you will see why during the last 15 minutes.) This is definitely one of the best films I've seen in a long time, and I highly recommend it.",1230940800,,1624,4.82078853046595
3164532,5,B0016Q2D66,"A lot of people who see this film will probably think of that line from ""Walden"" by Thoreau: ""The mass of people lead lives of quiet desperation.""  Although that line is fitting for his film, I think there was more to it than just that.  To tell you the truth, I think the main character was April Wheeler.  She reminded me of Nora in ""A Doll's House"" by Ibsen: she was fiercely independent and trapped within the confines of society during the '50s.  I think one of the reasons she was attracted to her future husband, Frank, was because of his feelings of independence and not being afraid to live life to its fullest.  But then things happen and people change.  April gets pregnant and suddenly finds herself as a Susie-homemaker somewhere out in the suburbs of Connecticut.  One moment she has dreams of becoming the next Katharine Hepburn on Broadway, and the next moment she is hosting a tea party for the ladies' auxiliary club in her living room.  She is not happy with her life.  Frank, on the other hand, is doing well in his life: he's got a wife and kids, a recent promotion that pays a bundle, and some ""afternoon delight"" on the side.  He's not as anxious or unhappy with his life.  So what do we have here?  Someone who keeps dwelling on the past (April) and someone who is looking towards the future (Frank).  It's no wonder the Wheelers are constantly at each other's throats.  What I liked about this film was its acute observation of a marriage.  How some people in a marriage learn to grow up, accept responsibility, and get on with their lives.  And how other people are fiercely independent, were never meant to get married, and never learn to get on with their lives.  I realize our society dictates that as humans, we should study hard, go to college, find a job, and get married and have kids.  But who's to say that is meant for everybody?  It may have been all right for Frank, but certainly not April.  ""Revolutionary Road"" questions the whole structure of our society and that is what I found so brilliant about it.  It was unafraid to explore these issues.",1230336000,,2086,4.509333333333333
3164533,1,B0016Q2D66,"If you ever think life can't get any worse, leave it to the movies to introduce you to characters whose despondent situations far surpass your own. Such characters thrive in Revolutionary Road, a film whose outlook reaches so far into a realm of stifling depression that the result is exhaustion. If only we could care for these people in some way, if only we could sympathize or connect, then their suffering might not have been wasted on uncaring eyes. If only.

For April (Kate Winslet) and Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) it's love at first sight, and shortly after the seemingly inescapable rut of repetition. Frank assumes the dreary day job as a businessman sleepwalking through mindless work days, womanizing the new secretaries, and purposely slacking in his duties. April is the stay-at-home mother, trapped by her responsibilities and the sinking feeling that her life isn't being lived to the fullest. As the couple plots a course to a new life in the utopian Paris, harsh realities replace desperate dreams and difficult choices steadily destroy their chances at breaking free from the sordid existence they've created.

There really isn't anything to like about Revolutionary Road. The characters are all depressing, dysfunctional and annoying - but most of all they're presented in such a way that sympathy is practically out of the question. As April spirals into insanity and Frank broils out of control, the only sensibility comes from the clinically loony John (Michael Shannon) who is so obnoxious that even his explanation of their situation is troubling. The two children, who might also be used to muster sympathy, are frequently away, further disconnecting audiences from the crumbling leads. It's as if we are supposed to despise everyone in the film, responding with nothing but negativity toward their failures and shortcomings.

The dialogue is lacking as well, making Leonardo and Kate look as amateurish as their turns in Titanic. Some may argue that they're accomplished actors in their primes and that their performances are worthy of distinction - but even the climax of the film is laughable, along with nearly every sequence in which they bicker and yell. And their arguing takes up the majority of the runtime, making this incredibly dialogue-heavy melodramatic mess all lemons and no sugar. At several points Revolutionary Road is so ridiculously funereal it's funny. It's a movie that will make audiences reevaluate the worst performances and films of the year. Maybe it will also cheer up those viewers who can give thanks that their lives are not this socially impaired - or hit too close to home for others.

3164534,5,B0016Q2D66,"It begins so innocently: A young man and a young woman glace at each other and immediately want to close the distance between them and get better acquainted. Such a moment can be found in James Cameron's ""Titanic"" early in the film, when the characters played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet first notice each other despite being separated by deck levels and social status. A very similar moment can be found at the beginning of Sam Mendes' ""Revolutionary Road,"" and interestingly, it features the same two actors. Their characters see each other for the first time at a local party, and they're separated more by life goals than by stature. As wonderful as ""Titanic"" is, it's an escapist entertainment, a sweeping, epic romantic fantasy. ""Revolutionary Road"" is smaller, subtler, and painfully real. We know this because the youthful, nave love the characters share at the start disappears by the next scene, at which point they're already married and having a terrible fight.

Based on Richard Yates' novel, ""Revolutionary Road"" is a brilliant, unflinchingly honest examination of suburban life in 1950s America, where the outward appearance of domestic happiness meant everything to the average married couple. It tells the story of a corporate employee named Frank Wheeler (DiCaprio) and his stay-at-home wife, April (Winslet), who live in a picturesque but boring Connecticut neighborhood. Despite the fact that Frank hates his job, he's content to stick with it, knowing that he's expected to provide for his family. This isn't to say that he doesn't let himself go from time to time. Early in the film, he has an affair with a young secretary. The fascinating thing is that both of them seem so casual about what they're doing; if they regret their actions, they certainly don't show it. There isn't even a spark of emotion as he leaves her in a motel bed, asserting that she was swell.

April, on the other hand, yearns for something more out of life than just living in a suburb and raising her two children. Years ago, she was an aspiring actress. Now, she's in a domestic trap as a wife and mother. On the night of Frank's thirtieth birthday, she makes a radical suggestion: They should all move to Paris in the fall. Once there, she will get a secretarial job while Frank will be allowed to figure out what he actually wants to do with his life. It takes a little convincing, but Frank agrees, and for a time, his relationship with April improves. But it isn't long before life starts getting in the way. For one thing, absolutely no one takes their plan seriously, especially their neighbors, Shep (David Harbour) and Milly Campbell (Kathryn Hahn), who seem genuinely hurt by their wanting to leave. But truth be told, there is something a little phony about the glow that surrounds Frank and April, as if the idea is more appealing than actually moving.

There's more holding them back, of course, but I won't say what. I will, however, take the time to describe a subplot featuring another ""Titanic"" alumnus, Kathy Bates. She plays Helen Givings, the realtor who sold the Wheelers their house on Revolutionary Road. Even though she doesn't have much screen time, it's surprising just how much we learn about her. On the outside, she's polite and upbeat, with a pleasant face and charming smile. On the inside, she's judgmental and, in some ways, just as desperate as April. Her son, John (Michael Shannon), has just been released from a mental hospital, and as part of his rehabilitation, he begins spending time with the Wheelers. In the same way the blind Tiresias is able to see the truth about King Oedipus, John is the only character in ""Revolutionary Road"" with a firm grasp on Frank and April. But as insightful as he is, there does come a point when the truth really hurts.

What I really loved about this movie was the meticulous attention to dialogue. Every line in this movie felt natural, going not for obvious dramatic statements but for realistic outbursts of anger, hurt, and frustration. Even the quieter moments have an intensity all their own, as when Frank sits with the secretary at a restaurant; in that pivotal scene, he expresses--probably for the first time--the disappointment he feels for turning out exactly like his father. At the same time, there's an air of epiphany in his voice, as if he realized right then and there that he was never meant to be anything more than an office worker. Writer Justin Haythe evokes powerful emotions in his screenplay, and he does so without being condescending or clich.

Of course, well-written screenplays are only half the battle--you need talented actors to make the dialogue work. DiCaprio and Winslet have such believable onscreen chemistry, especially as their characters descend into a seemingly never-ending cycle of shouting matches. They fight so well, as if they were an actual married couple. After having eleven years to mature as performers, they may in fact be better than they were in ""Titanic."" One wonders what would have happened had the ship made it to America and Jack and Rose had gotten off together. Would the fairy-tale romance eventually end? Would they grow up to be as unfulfilled as Frank and April Wheeler? ""Revolutionary Road"" is such an amazing film, superbly cast, expertly plotted, and emotionally compelling, a sobering reminder that what we want doesn't always coincide with what we get. Even the crme de la crme of 2008--like ""Changeling,"" ""Gran Torino,"" and ""Frost/Nixon""--are not as good as this film is.",1229904000,3,5529,4.909090909090909
3164555,5,B0016Q2D66,"I'm a very picky person when it comes to movies these days but this is worthy of a 5 star rating. It relates to the eye opening harsh reality we live in. It unveils the societal pressure we give in to work a 9-5 job all for the sake of money instead of being fearless and chasing our dreams. Instead of choosing, love, passion, adventure and new beginnings we choose status, big houses, meaningless objects, and repetition because we believe those things will make us happy. We believe the opinions of others are held at a higher value then the opinion we have of ourselves. Instead of actually being a better person we give an illusion we are better with fake smiles and a perfectly curated lifestyle. I'm so pleased someone could translate to film in to what I think in my head on a regular basis.

3164581,5,B0016Q2D66,"Really liked this and related to Winslet's character a lot. It felt like a dramatization of ""The Feminine Mystique"" which was basically about middle class women in this time period who were not allowed to work and more or less went insane from boredom. All alone in a big house in a big empty neighborhood, washing dishes and folding laundry all day long. Ugh. Really impressive look into the push and pull of married life, thwarted expectations, the burden of childbirth and hard gender roles, the dynamics between married couples, etc etc. And for all the people who thought that it was boring and slow, well that's kind of the point. Car crashes and chase scenes would betray this movie's dedication to its source material. ""Boring and slow"" is part of the characters' problem. Loved it.",1517875200,,790,4.8161764705882355

Incredible and insightful and brutally real.  If you have ever been married or divorced or in a family with real emotion, this film will strike a chord.  Like it or not it's an insightful glimpse of the extraordinary discomfort that comes with true feelings expressed or otherwise in an honest relationship.  Not that honesty is always the policy, but honesty to the fibre of one's own being.  This is the beauty of Revolutionary Road and the beauty of Death of a Salesman.

3164583,1,B0016Q2D66,"SPOILER ALERT*Profane, blasphemous, slow. Great actors wasted on a confusing plot. The action picks up when April (KateWinslet) convinces her hubby Frank (Leo DiCaprio) that they should pack up their idyllic New England existence and move to Paris. She plays a wanna be actress, never gets her big break and presumably marries Leo ( Frank) and gets trapped in the suburbs. First they're excited about moving despite pushback from their friends. But, suddenly, anger and despondency take over the movie. Too many flashbacks explain the supposed deterioration of the marriage which appears to result from Aprils inability to communicate (which explains why she never made it as an actress). Every time Frank tries to talk to her about her feelings, she shuts him down and insults him so its no wonder she feels suffocated! Their kids disappear halfway through the movie for no apparent reason. Frank unexpectedly gets his big break at his humdrum Manhattan company, effectively shutting down any plans of moving to Paris. Multiple screaming matches basically make up the bulk of the last hour. April decides to abort her 3rd child and commit suicide at the same time to escape her terribly comfortable life. I guess this film is supposed to double as a cautionary tale/womens rights, but fails on both counts. In some ways it mirrored Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf? but won't become a classic.

Winslet's character is constantly asking who made the rules to the life they are living and, better yet, why do they have to follow them? She suggests they move to Paris, a place DiCaprio once told her he felt the most alive and one she's never been to. For a moment, they look set to escape their dull existence, before DiCaprio gets a promotion at the job he hates, forcing his retreat into the world he swore was sucking out his soul.

The sudden change in Kate Winslet's character late in the movie was also not believable, though it's difficult to say if that was due to Winslet's acting or an ineffectual screenplay, which also lacked plot and character development in the beginning of the film.

For those who reviewed this and chalked it up as boring or depressing, they probably don't much care for psychological thriller-type movies. The plot takes a couple of twists, and it almost hurts to see how much angst the characters inflict on each other.

This is not just a drama about a couple experiencing the malaise if middle age, in a middle class neighborhood, in mid-century America. It goes way beyond that. Its hard to take simply because its a grim reminder that we often treat our own loved ones worse than anyone. This is not a good choice if you're hoping for a story that wraps everything up in a neat box with a neatly tied bow, with everyone living happily ever after.

In the movie, Revolutionary Road, they dare to think out loud of what happened to those hopes and dreams that brought the couple together. They play it safe for the sake the family but then, the same thing is tearing them apart.

Take for instance, a review from a Doctor

""BUNCH OF NONSENSE.
why? I'm a doc who is old enough to remember the ""good old days"".

One: it's very hard if not impossible to put the tube into the cervix by oneself unless you are a contortionist.
also, You have to dilate the cervix first, which hurts.

Two: the catheter was inserted by the local abortionist, not by the woman.

Three: The ""self administered"" abortion was a knitting needle: Usually this was only done by the poorest and most ignorent patients we treated: and when they came in with a perforated uterus, we had to do an emergency hysterectomy.

Four: back in the fifties, every upper class lady, and a lot of the lower class ones, knew the local abortionist, and rarely had complications. The one at our ""college"" lived in the next town and was a full MD.

Five: deaths became rare after penicillin and blood transfusions were invented.

The only one I know about was from a dirty catheter, with retained fetus and placenta that got infected (i.e. second trimester).

Conclusion:
Propaganda of course, to scare the PC into hating pro life people.""",1515974400,,1218,4.627906976744186

This is an ""art imitates life"" story. From my reading it is emblematic of the ""age of anxiety"" literature of the 50s and 60s.  This movie has value in that it demonstrates ""lives of quiet desperation"" as they are lived in suburbs all over the world; and it tackles difficult social issues such as materialism, abortion and the right to one's own body, gender economic and social divides, marriage and children, ideas about definitions of happiness, etc.

I do have a problem with the story as told.  In the first few minutes, the plot coyly promises an uplifting story about marriage and family, only to lead us into a narrow view of miscommunication, anger, disappointment, depression and desperation.  Having reminded us of the worst parts of ourselves, of the hopelessness that can be life,  the movie ends without taking the time and care to give us hope that the best sides of us can prevail.",1515974400,3,1039,4.681318681318682

3164690,5,B0016Q2D66,"A fundamental existential question of our lives has been the goal or purpose of it. If there is a purpose, then how should we live, such that our lives fulfil that purpose? Philosophers as well as ordinary men have pondered this question for millenniums. Seventy years ago, Jean-Paul Sartre declared that there is no meaning or purpose to our lives other than what our own freedom defines. This meant that there is no joy in looking up to a God or a Guru to give us meaning to our lives. We must rely on our own resources to find an answer and craft our future. But the future is not knowable. It is inherently uncertain. This causes  anxiety and despair from which there is no escape. The larger the purpose, the higher is our responsibility and hence higher the anxiety and despair. This film explores this existential dilemma through a young American couple in their late twenties during the 1950s in suburban Connecticut. The moment I saw that Sam Mendes is the director of the film, I was confident that the subject will be handled with great skill. His treatment of suburban American life  in American Beauty gave me that faith. The film itself is based on Richard Yates classic novel of the same title, written in the 1960s.

The film is set in the mid-1950s and gets off to a flying start, with April and Frank, two young people, meeting at a party and getting interested in each other. In the next frame, we see them already married with a couple of children and living in a lovely suburban corner house in Connecticut with beautifully tended lawns and well-appointed interior decorations. Frank Wheeler works for a firm in NY selling business machines. April is a housewife now, but was an aspiring actor prior to her marriage. A few years into their marriage, as Frank is on his thirtieth birthday, April realizes that they are just living a humdrum existence. It is not the dream life they envisaged when getting married. Instead, they are just following the template given to them by the post-war American society - that of getting a home on debt, consuming on debt, having boring get-togethers with boring neighbours, working a job that he hates and repeating the whole charade year after year. Little does she recognize that neither of them actually has any real, passionate dreams to pursue but only have fantasies about such a dream.
April finds that Frank loved Paris city when he spent some time there years before. So, she suggests that they leave Connecticut and go live in Paris, where she will work as a translator in the US  embassy while Frank can discover what he would love to do with his life. April believes that Paris would give meaning to their lives and show them what their dreams are. Frank agrees and they announce their decision to the total disbelief of his colleagues at work and their neighbours. Just as they are making preparations to leave, April finds that she is pregnant again and Frank is offered a promotion and significantly more money at work. Doubts set in and plans are derailed amidst bitter acrimony. Ostensibly, the rethink is because you cant support three children in Paris on a secretarys salary and that it is foolish to turn down a promotion with a lot more money in these difficult times! They update their friends on the changed plans. While entertaining their friend Helen and her family, April and Frank are brutally confronted by Helens son John, who is a Ph. D in Mathematics and also just out of a mental institution. With searing honesty, he shows them their delusions and exposes their postures and pretensions. The film moves on to a devastating climax.

The story is splendidly narrated and I simply loved the film. Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet are brilliant as Frank and April in their search for a meaning to their lives and pursuit of happiness. Watching them hardly felt like they were acting. It was like taking a peep into our own  lives. The 1950s is brought to us graphically in the way we see a whole train load of men disembarking at the Grand Central station in New York city, clad in stylish suits and smart-looking hats. The cultural feel of the Eisenhower-era values is brought to us by the conversations April has with her neighbours and the ones Frank has with his colleagues at the office. Watching it in 2017, one notices immediately that everyone smokes incessantly and drinks quite substantially. Given the theme of the film, it is as if they use these stimulants to take their minds away from facing up to the emptiness of  a consumer society, selling false American Dreams of affluence.

The film has made me want to read other books by author Richard Yates, on whose book this film is based. Even though the book was written more than fifty years ago, it is amazing how relevant it is still today. After all, it asks us, Leave alone trying to understand the world or other people. Do you actually know who you are?",1513814400,2,4914,4.6728323699421965

For example, ""foiled by faulty contraception,"" and "" the secretarial pool will be ecstatic,"" etc.  He made me laugh when he made the phone call

He, certainly not an innocent in their relationship and having his own serious bouts with impulse control, desperately tries to stay in step with her frenetic dance. He is virtually simon-saysing.

The viewer is wondering why in the world he would volunteer this information.  April even asks him that question.

3164911,5,B0016Q2D66,"I just watched this movie and it was out standing. The acting was so real. The emotions were raw. I loved it. Outsiders thought the Wheelers were special and hypnotic. They were and the feeling was shared by both Frank and April. They had the American dream and the sky was the limit for these two and their children. The perfect family but April wanted more. Frank wanted to make April happy but her dream to run away, live in Paris and find themselves sounded fantastic but life got in the way and Frank couldn't leave security for an unknown future. Watching this movie was like being a fly on the wall, being privy into their complex marriage. The acting was so real and so believable. It was like they weren't acting at all. It was spellbinding! The era was portrayed exactly as it was then. Women just wanted to get married, have children and live the 1950's American dream. But, April wanted more. She said she was suffocating. She was unhappy and she looked desperately for a way out, another kind of life that held promise of excitement and uncertainty. She was bored. Being a mother was unfulfilling for her and her marriage was too safe. Poor Frank. He would have done anything for her but throwing away everything he had worked so hard for was not going to happen.. He thought for awhile he could share her fantasy, but in the end he couldn't do it. Most people thought Frank was in control but in all truth it was April. He tried so hard to fulfill her life but nothing he could do would ever satisfy her. April was a very unhappy woman but it was far more than that. She was mentally ill. She had all the characteristics of being by-polar. She was plagued with constant highs and lows and from the outside looked in she appeared very appealing but it was anything but. She was sexually hyper. Her hormones had a lot to do with that but it was also part of her illness. When she started dancing in the bar with her neighbor it was all premeditated on her part and the neighbor, always desiring her went right along with her game. I was mesmerized by her dance and her oozing sexuality. Throughout her marriage to Frank their sex life was thoroughly enjoyed by both of them but I suspect for her it was much more than that. It is a characteristic of bi-polar, extreme sexuality. She showed manic behavior and chronically depressed behavior throughout their marriage. Yes, she was bi-polar but she also had other mental disorders. She was not able to love. At the end of the movie she had a complete psychotic break. She was not able to distinguish reality from depressive psychosis. She was in desperate need of hospitalization to stabilize her deep depression, because all she could see was hopelessness. This was the 50's and this behavior was not easily recognizable in those years. I felt so sorry for Frank. They were both young, immature and prideful but he inherently was a good, stable man. He loved April with all his heart but she couldn't return the feelings because she had none for him or her children. The thought of her having another child made her suicidal. The botched abortion was her way of committing suicide. She didn't see a way out because of her depression. Death to her was a release from her tormenting life. That was the illness talking. She had so much to be grateful for and many reasons to be happy but because of her mental illness, what looks good to others is not shared or felt with her. After her break from reality when she begged Frank to stop talking and leave her alone, Frank was beside himself and in anger retaliated with harsh words that Alice couldn't feel. The next morning, Alice appeared to be over her tantrum and Frank was so happy and releaved. He asked her if she hated him and her response was of cause not. That was a true response from her because she had no feelings for him. They were all for herself and her deep depression. Frank was so releaved. He didn't want to see the truth and accept the fact that she was mentally ill. He didn't know how to deal with that, so he left for work, knowing deep inside things were precariously dangerous. Such a sad movie. The acting is so intensely wonderful. I highly recommend this movie!",1440633600,4,4198,4.503276539973788

3164990,3,B0016Q2D66,"Directed by Sam Mendes and starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, REVOLUTIONARY ROAD would like to be a scathing indictment of 1950s America and suburbia but unfortunately fails to say anything fresh, and its satirical edge is remarkably dull. Still, there were some fine performances and individual moments that stand out, not to mention the excellent filmmaking on display. The story is about the Wheelers, a couple who live in the Revolutionary Hill Estates, a Connecticut suburban community. On the outside their life looks idyllic, but underneath it all there is a deep dissatisfaction and resentment that begins to manifest itself. The banality of suburban life is not a new topic in literature or film, and this film does a good job getting the surface details right in order to make its point rather clear. However, I didn't feel like it did anything I haven't seen before in other films, like THE ICE STORM and Sam Mendes' own AMERICAN BEAUTY. In fact, this felt a lot like AMERICAN BEAUTY, with the exception that it was set in the 1950s. Even the score was reminiscent of the one for that previous film. However, that one had a more arty feel that this film didn't have. Still, despite the (ironically) banal subject matter, this film was well put together on every front, both technical and performance-wise. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet do a good job playing their roles, although there isn't too much depth to their characters at all. There were a few smaller roles that had familiar faces behind them, but they also felt under-developed. By far the best performance in the entire film was a small role played by Michael Shannon, the temporarily institutionalized son of the couple who sold the house on Revolutionary Road to the Wheelers. His couple of scenes have that acerbic wit and bite to them that I wish had been more prevalent in the overall story, which felt downright sterile at times. From a technical standpoint, the film is flawless and the photography was beautiful, belying the ugliness of the atmosphere projected by its characters. Overall, I didn't hate this film but I didn't think it entirely justified its existence either. It does a good job of portraying suburban malaise, but at the end of it you have to ask ""So what?"" Still it made for a pleasant, if unspectacular, viewing experience and was capped off with the perfect ending.",1421020800,,2381,4.881481481481481

3165009,5,B0016Q2D66,"This was a great movie because the subject matter is so unique.  I read a review of this movie years ago, describing the Suburbs to be the death of the soul.  How chilling, and yet, it is what everyone aspires to.  The third child, then the fourth until the wife looks like an old hag unless she goes out and gets botox so her face can look frozen like all the 40 something reality show women.  Yates does not address what draws people to that life.  He implies there is living up to your parents expectations and fitting in and conforming to what everyone else is doing and pursuing a life of materialism.  Keeping up with the Jones, or in today's world, the Kardashians.  Is it that parenting is just way more draining than most people ever thought about, there is the implication that no one is really prepared for the true nature of a adult life as we know it, especially since the 70s were known as the me decade, post birth control, where couples for the first time in history, could consider becoming fulfilled in an artistic, profoundly spiritual way.  April knows she wants to be an actress but the De caprio's character has no clue.  We know he owes it to himself to take some time and find out what that could be.  The insane son of their realtor neighbor is the little nagging voice in his head that tells him to go for his DREAMS and keep searching until he finds it, but he never does.  If you think about the way society has been since the 50s, it has only gotten more alienating, celebrating individual expression and uniqueness less and less.  April thinks she has the perfect answer which is Paris, but that too, could be just another delusion. She is so desperate to feel special, she sleeps with her best friend's husband.  He is so desperate to feel that he is a person he sleeps with a secretary who eyes him in an elevator.  Paris is a beautiful city but has the same issues as any other metropolis, competition, its very expensive, cold, exclusionary, celebrates the past and pedigrees.  When tourists go there and dream of finding the solution to all their problems and run away to a glamorous, romantic place where everything magically falls into place.  it would be interesting to know how many Americans move there from their middle class frumpy existence and then suddenly find themselves forty pounds thinner, much better off in every way simply because they move to the most decadent city in the world.  April is dreaming a silly fantasy and her husband knows it but he doesn't know how to do anything other than do a better job at suburbia.  The book is somewhat autobiographical, Yates did get a a divorce after having 2 kids, did live in Paris for some time, did search for artistic expression, did smoke nonstop and did feel modern life sucked the soul out of men in the 50s.",1415145600,,2810,4.508875739644971

3165029,4,B0016Q2D66,"April is textbook Borderline Personality Disorder. The fact that she switches instantly from love to hate to a robotic lack of emotion and empathy, and in and out of alternate realities, indicates severe psychological dysfunction that had no contemporary terminology in the 1950s, so no wonder Frank was constantly dismayed by her irrational mood swings and multiple personalities.

Since the original book was written in the 1950s this film doesn't really fit in with all the other recent revisionist Hollywood films which are hellbent on portraying the 1950s Great American Dream as a hoax, a scam, a lie... SOMEBODY must have been happy back then with that quality of life!",1409011200,,676,5.1454545454545455
3165030,3,B0016Q2D66,"In some ways, this film, which reunites ""Titanic"" stars Kate Winslet, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kathy Bates, is reminiscent of ""A Doll's House""-- a piece that challenges the conventional role of a wife in a more repressive era. Both  will end with the wife breaking out of her conventional role, and an environment in which they felt imprisoned, but in very different ways and for very different reasons.
 In either scenario, the husband will be left devastated. But whereas in Ibsen's 1879 play, there is some hope for redemption, in director Sam Mendes'(Winslet's then-husband) film, based on Richard Yates' 1961 best-seller, there will be a different outcome.
 Like Ibsen's play, this too, is a story of a mismatched couple who made many poor choices.
 Set in the late 1940s, then skipping ahead to the fateful summer of 1955, DiCaprio and Winslet play Frank and April Wheeler, who, amid the lovely music of the Ink Spots, meet and dance at a party-she an aspiring actress, and he a longshoreman about to take a job as a cashier.
 An edited scene depicting April's childhood gives some insight into her character. The book purportedly reveals her childhood to have been a troubled one, impacting her relationship with others as an adult.
 Our initial viewing of the Wheelers as a married couple in Connecticut is during April's less-than-stellar performance in a stage production of ""The Petrified Forest"". We hear audience members express relief when the play is over. A discouraged April sobs backstage as her friend, Millie Campbell (Kathryn Hahn) waits for her.
  Frank goes to the dressing room to see his wife afterwards. The first of many quarrels begins when they disagree about whether to rendezvous with friends afterwards. The row continues as they drive home, pulling over to the side of the road still bickering.
 Indeed, as many critics have said, this film depicts what many think would have happened if the fate of Jack and Rose of ""Titanic"" had been different.
 This film becomes a difficult one to watch as the couple with help from Kathy Bates' realtor, Mrs. Giving, move into a more desirable residence on 115 Revolutionary Road.
 Frank continues to commute to work with the Knox Machines firm in New York, and April, having abandoned her dreams of acting, tends the home, and their two children, Jennifer and Michael (Ryan and Ty Simpkins).
 Outwardly, their lives appear idyllic, but in reality, they will continue to be fraught with conflict. Frank reluctantly follows in his late father's  footsteps  as an employee of the same firm.
 On his thirtieth birthday, he has lunch with the young secretary, Maureen Grube(Zoe Kazan), which leads to an affair in her apartment.
 After Frank leaves, he goes home to his wife, who is apologetic about they way she has behaved since the play and his children, who have thrown a surprise party for him. The expression on his face shows him to be deeply moved, but the audience knows he is hiding a guilty secret.
  As they prepare for bed, April, recounting a time in their courtship when Frank talked about his time in Paris during World War II, and how he imagined finding fulfillment if he went back, recommends that  they move there, stating that  she could work as an government secretary while Frank studies and takes time to decide what he really wants to do, rather than stay in an unfulfilling job.
 Frank initially but reluctantly agrees to the  plan, but sharing the idea at the office as well as with Millie and her husband, Shep (David Harbour) seems to be to its detriment.
 Mrs. Givings,  frequently visits  the Wheelers, and at one point asks if her son, John( Michael Shannon), a Math Professor who has been institutionalized, hoping that some company might improve his condition.
 During a get-together, Mrs. Givings, John, and Mr. Givings(Richard Easton) discuss their impending move to Paris, as they previously had with Shep and Millie.
 But soon, April is pregnant again, and Frank is offered a raise at work.
 An outing at the beach with the Campbells provides a crucial moment in which Frank reveals that he is leaning towards staying in his position, much to April's disappointment leading to another quarrel. In the bathroom of their beach house, Frank discovers the equipment April had acquired to terminate her pregnancy, leading to another heated argument, during which Frank questions his wife's sanity.
  I would not call this  film a pleasant viewing session; the constant fights can leave one exhausted and demoralized.
  There is a notable scene where Frank  gives the definition of the word ""inventory"" while speaking into a dictaphone. It seems to set the stage for how he feels his family life should go as opposed to April's vision of what their life could be.
 His affair with Maureen continues briefly. Among the many noteworthy  entries of the film soundtrack is the song, ""Crying in the Chapel"", which suggests that the Wheelers might have fared better with some spiritual values.
  An evening out with the Campbells at a roadhouse finds Millie happy that the gang will stay together. While dancing with Frank, she reassures him that April will get over their not going to Paris. But a series of events finds April alone with Shep, who has been long desirous of her. After confiding to Shep her feelings of uselessness and of feeling trapped, they have a fling in Shep's car after Frank takes Millie home--despite April's pregnancy.
 Another dinner with the Givings leads to a brutally cathartic ""sound and fury"" moment with John, who though insane, proves he's no idiot, correctly guessing the couple's situation and the real reasons for it.
 After Frank's rage chases the Givings out of the house, he and April continue the feud  to the point where April runs out towards the woods, where the couple had had a more pleasant stroll with John not too long before, with Frank in pursuit. April warns Frank away. During the feud, Frank confessed his infidelity, to which April , who hadn't been sleeping with him for quite some time,is apathetic.
  Frank drinks himself to sleep, while April stays outside, smoking, only to find his wife in a better temper, cheerfully making breakfast the next morning, taking an interest in his job now that he has been promoted(inwardly conceding defeat) and giving her husband one last pleasant moment in her company, secretly harboring the fact that she has  made a fateful decision. She briefly speaks with Millie, who has been looking after her children due to her feeling unwell over the phone, tearfully tidies the house, putting the items Frank knocked off of her dresser during their latest fight back in order, and commits an irretrievably life-altering act....
 Upon the revelation of a tragic outcome, we find DiCaprio responding just as he did when he played another character named Frank( last name Abagnale) in another movie--running away from the site of misfortune with a pained expression, his head thrown back, and his 6-foot frame taking quite the blind, dramatic sprint down the road. Although the film differs from the book regarding the fate of the Wheeler's children, life will go on for their closest neighbors, although it will be sadder for both the men who knew April intimately, and Mr. Givings  will decide, as some justifiably will that the Wheeler's tragic story is one that should be tuned out.",1408838400,2,7364,4.931118314424635
3165031,5,B0016Q2D66,"As a person who would move to Paris in a heartbeat if my responsibilities disappeared, I could totally relate to April. April is a creative, colorful person who feels trapped in the rat race of life, in marriage, in motherhood, in the mundane. Frank, her husband in name, is feeling the dissatisfaction of the daily grind at working at a job who's company doesn't even remember his salesman father. April, not quite one to give up, devises a plan to get out of dodge, and Paris is a calling. The audience is somewhat surprised when Frank agrees to her fanciful and ""whimsical"" plan. (It was quite whimsical in the 50s. Nowadays everyone who feels the pull does it.) They put the house up for sale, and pack up most of their belongings. Then, Frank gets offered a promotion at work, and it seems to go downhill from there. All the old wounds get opened up. We see April struggle to hold on to ""sanity"". We see Frank struggle to hold on to April, his trophy wife. Ironically, Frank is the one who always wants to talk things out. April is the quiet, introverted type, who needs to just be, to think. Frank doesn't understand her need for space and resorts to hitting the bottle. Again, it's a downhill spiral from there. When April returns from thinking, it's morning and she asks how would Frank like his eggs. Anyone who can see the resignation and change in her, knows that no good will come from this interaction.

I was stupefied after watching this as this movie gave me pause for about an hour. What dreams am I burying to sustain my pace on the wheel? Where am I performing cognitive dissonance to survive? As a colorful woman, I could relate to April. But what about Frank? I could even relate to him in that as a man in the 50s, you don't rely on your wife to bring in the income. He possibly felt emasculated at the very suggestion, but didn't speak up then. However, his actions were very loud and clear when he accepted the promotion to possibly save face. He did not take April's feelings into consideration when he accepted.

The movie contained volatile scenes and was a bit jarring because I can't say that I've ever seen such raw passion and hatred performed on the big screen, or TV, before. However, these types of scenes is a regular everyday occurrence in some households. This movie was a real portrayal of real people.

The actors have evolved from their earlier work together, and their chemistry is palpable.

possible. They got married,moved to th suburbs in Connecticut and appeared to have the perfect life and be a perfect family with 2 children. in the 1950's people could buy a home and car and all was perfect with the world. Then the realization came. It's not enough to have everything we always want more. They had struggles with communication. The wife had mental issues that were never treated and after a life changing trip to France fell through everything fell apart and became very troubling. It was difficult to see them go through these difficult times. If I knew what was going to happen in the end I probably wouldn't have watched it. Very sad.

April bombs in one play and she gives up on her dream. Way to go champ. That's what winners do;quit the first time things get tough. Frank has no guts or faith. So what if they went to Paris? They would have been fine. It might have brought out something great in them.  In any case, they weren't going to starve.  We're talking France not Uzbekistan. I suppose the author of the book that the movie was based on was trying to say something about the burbs and the salaryman lifestyle. I don't see it that way. This movie is about two jerks who created their own hell because of their cowardice and weakness.  No one has to live in the suburbs.  They're not gulags.  No one has to work in an office.  You have the freedom to walk out the door at any time.  They also had birth control back then.  They didn't have to have kids.

This was a very good movie in that it was so real and honest about peoples inner demons.  I don't want to give anything away but I think this movie would really open peoples eyes a bit more about how everyone is the same inside, that is the same fears at times and desires, how life just throws things at us that we can handle and some we can't.

3165069,5,B0016Q2D66,"""Revolutionary Road"" is a movie I put off a very long time in watching.  I have to be in the right kind of mood to watch a movie of its kind--deep, thought provoking, and one that you and your friends can discuss into the wee hours of the morning.

Frank and April Wheeler (movingly portrayed by Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, respectively) are the principle characters of the movie.  They are the embodiement of (at least on the surface) the American dream:  nice, beautiful house in Connecticut, children, picket fence, etc.  Trouble is, NOTHING is at it seems.  April is a women who lives--yet isn't ALIVE; Frank deeply desires his American dream to have it all, yet he cannot escape the nightmare that has become his life:  he is an adulterer, hates his job, and second guesses his manhood.  Their arguments build and build, until the bloodletting is almost as harsh as the characters of George and Martha in ""Whose Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"".

All this seems to change when April convinces him to LIVE his dream:  move to Paris (she'll work instead of him) and just let the chips fall where they may.  This decision seems to invigorate them both, and plans start being made.  That's when all hell breaks loose.

I am not going to give anymore of the plot away because if you get the chance, you really should see this movie.  The main actors were superbly cast, as are the minor ones.  Kathy Bates puts every ounce of gusto into her role as a real estate agent, who is trying desperately to find her mentally off-balance son a friend.  The movie is rated R (and this confuses me).  There is no violence, no nudity, a couple of sexual situations, and some language.  DiCaprio and Winslet are just unbelievable.  Although I'm not a huge DiCapril fan, I don't know what it would take for this guy to win an Academy Award.  Highly recommended.",1389225600,,1844,4.598159509202454

And while I did like this movie and understood the emotions and frustrations of the characters, I find it extremely obnoxious when the super-rich, beautiful people of Hollywood who honestly do not have any idea what it is like to struggle and feel trapped by life, make movies about how trivial, pointless and unsatisfying life is for us ""normal"" people. It strikes me as extremely elitist, arrogant and down-right demeaning. I'm sure all of us middle-class ""regular"" people would love to know what it's like to make millions traveling around the world and getting paid to dress up and play make-believe in front of a camera, but since we don't, it's really a slap in the face to be told that our mundane lifestyles really aren't as worthwhile or meaningful as theirs.",1381968000,2,1189,4.639810426540285

I had seen it back in 2008 and thought it was a sad and depressing, although extremely well-done film, but at the time the theme didn't really apply to my life.  I recently came upon it and decided to add it to our netflix list because we have started trying to have a family and have watched many of our friends have kids, move to the suburbs and change from the fun people they were to drones that hate their jobs and lives for the most part.

Its interesting to see how this movie was the story of the 1950's suburb life and the themes, issues and disappointments still fits life very closely today. We were moved by several pivotal scenes. The scene where April stands at the end of the driveway when putting out the trash can and EVERY SINGLE HOUSE has their trash can in the same place. Kind of like the suburbs of today where every 3rd house is the same....everyone does the same thing on the same days etc etc.  The scene where Frank is among all the men at the train station, all dressed the same, all solemn, all going to their jobs that they hate in the city.  We still do this today, only in most cities its one person per car, in traffic, road rage etc etc.  The scene where April tearfully claims that she thought ""they were different, they were special"" and immune to the middle class boring life. That the American dream is what everyone strives for and then is just disappointed when they get there. I've seen it in my parents back in the day and I see in my friends with families now.  This movie is powerful from beginning to end. The acting is superb and you see the theme of disappointment and couples who have ""settled"" for their American Dream whether its the neighbors who claim they think Frank and April are crazy for planning to move to Paris, but are clearly jealous or Mrs. Giving's husband who turns down his hearing aid to tune out his wife in the very end of the movie.

My husband and I couldn't stop thinking about this film for days after. We worry that starting our family will mean the end of our happiness.  It will most likely not end in the horrible way this movie ended, but we are hesitant to give up our condo in the city and the life we currently love to buy into the American dream.  Since seeing this movie, we are even more adamant about staying close to the city we love even if it means we have to give up the big house, garden, good suburb schools and the life we are ""programmed"" to want.  I think we may make our own path and see where we end up with that.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who feels the need to ""keep up with the Jones's,"" its not all its cracked up to be.  I have actually ordered a copy to watch again and again....not only because I love the movie, but because I think I need to be reminded once in awhile.",1372032000,3,2837,4.22365988909427

However, this movie is the anti-thesis of  the sappy 'Titanic' love story and could become a cynical study into what could have happened to Jack and Rose if they both had survived the iceberg and settled into marriage. The pace is slow and moody despite the nostalgic set production of the 'simpler' times of the 1950s. The movie's premise is a study in human isolation that is hard not to relate to regardless of how different one thinks they may be. This is of course what makes it crawl under your skin, it demonstrates how we are defined by our society despite our better intentions and knowledge. How we conform in order to fit in and how we lose our identity along the way regardless of believing in our better potential. Who wouldn't want more money and recognition at work despite our real dreams? Who doesn't want the security and comfort of a beautiful and enviable home despite its inherent mediocrity?

The Movie
Review
By Richard E. Noble

This was a difficult movie to watch in its entirety - dark and depressing to say the least.

After watching the movie, I had to go to my computer and find out about the author whose book inspired this movie, Richard Yates. They had a picture of Mr. Yates in the biography I read.

Even his picture was depressing.

The bio said that he had a traumatic childhood and was an unhappy man.

No kidding! Who could have guessed?

Mr. Yates must have been a barrel of fun for family and friends alike. But I am a writer myself, and I find him a curiosity. I ordered his volume of short stories. Whether we like to face it or not, all of life is not Marry Poppins.

From a writer's point of view, the author had to be a very good writer to hold me there until the end of this emotional disaster.

Of course, it could be Sam Mendes, the director or any and all of those responsible for putting this movie together. But, for a start, I'll go to Mr. Richard Yates and see how some of his other works affect me.

Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio deserve praise for their daring to take on the parts of such characters. They truly did an excellent job.

Kate Winslet plays DiCaprio's wife. And what a rendition she provides.

From my perspective the woman in the movie is obviously mentally ill. The story inside the upper middle class home on Revolutionary Road is that of a reasonably normal male who has married and is in love with a severely depressed woman.

At one point DiCaprio brings up the notion of his wife seeing a shrink.

You think?

I would say so.

Kate Winslet does a superb job in capturing the manifestations and personality deformities of this sad, empty woman. This woman has no redeeming qualities in my evaluation. For any actress to take on such a role requires great confidence and courage.

DiCaprio does yeoman service to the part of the struggling husband attempting to bring a reasonable content if not happiness to his confused bride and life's companion.

I felt sorry for him.

His role was secondary and basically played off Miss Winslet.

He is also the only semi-positive character in the whole movie.

I would like to say that this is not a critique of upper middle class suburbia and more a classic study in manic depression, but taking all the surrounding characters in the movie into consideration that is not being realistic.

There isn't a bright face in this whole line up. The community is not real. It is a morose caricature of a slew of sad individuals, all migrants from the dark side the planet earth.

The lightest moment for me in the whole movie was at the very end. An old man in the movie being exposed to his wife's negative banter on the sad conclusion to the studied couple who once lived as their neighbors on Revolutionary Road, reaches into his shirt pocket and turns off his hearing device. That actually made me smile ...

It really didn't warrant a laugh.

I disagree with the ""A hands-down, watch it three times in a row masterpiece"" accolade on the cover of the DVD.

Once was more than enough for me.

The Hobo Philosopher, Richard Edward Noble, is a writer and the author of: ""It's a Long Story"" a group of six ""long"" short stories.",1362787200,2,3244,4.474489795918367
3165145,3,B0016Q2D66,"Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio reunite as a suburbanite couple in this deeply pessimistic film. I found this to be the culmination of the empty, spiritual-less road in which we are headed. Kate Winslet stars as the unfulfilled wife of a typical 9 to 5, hates his job, cheating husband in Leonardo DiCaprio.

Dreams of moving to Paris and starting anew has re-invigorated Winslet's character, Amy. Especially after her husband Frank agrees to go along with it. You can tell that Frank is never totally on board. He is trying to please Amy, but when she gets pregnant Frank finds a loophole in getting out of it. Amy is devestated and is even willing to abort the pregnancy to keep her dream alive. Frank becomes livid when he learns of her intentions and their marriage begins to spiral out of control.

There is no reason to watch this movie a second time. It is a startling, hopeless situation with no real solution. The acting is very good and you will be affected in one way or another.",1361577600,3,993,4.604519774011299

Winslett and DiCaprio unite once again for some serious work, no more kiddie stuff. Topics of their arguments are following one's dreams, cheating on spouses, children, etc.  All of which could be very boring and redundant but these actors are fully capable of entertaining us with their looks and skills.

There are some fine supporting actors including Kathy Bates playing the helpful real-estate agent who by trade is talkative and has a son in a mental institution.

As often happened in those days, the Wheelers met at  a party, seemed to hit it off, and got married.  Then reality sets in.  Frank discovers he is dissatisfied as a ""Man in a Gray Flannel Suit"" commuting to a boring job.  April finds that being isolated in the role of mother/homemaker leaves her depressed.  When she expresses her feelings, she is met with Frank's suggestion that she needs therapy.  When she allows that she doesn't really want a third child and is considering a do-it-yourself abortion (remember, her options were very limited), Frank suggests that she is an inhuman monster.  The most honest person in the film is the real estate agent's son, John, home from the mental institution for a day, who comes along with his mother to the Wheelers' and mercilessly chops through the facade with his observations.

Kate and Leo play a couple trapped in the American dream - house in the suburbs, children, well-paying, albeit dull job. The film explores the question: what happens when you achieve your dream only to find it really is not what you were looking for. Winslet character is similar to the one she played in Little Children - unfulfilled housewife. But unlike her character in that movie, here she is trapped by the social conventions of the early 1950s, i.e, women, especially mothers, did not go to work. When people are trapped, they can sometimes pretend that they are not trapped by simply ignoring it and going on with their lives. MINOR SPOILER ALERT: Here, what really begins her downward spiral is the fact that she is presented with what she sees to be an opportunity to break out of the trap, but when it is taken away she can no longer pretend she is not trapped. Winslet is, as always, superb, and diCaprio has never been better (which is saying a lot). Their on-screen chemistry is tangible, and their off-screen friendship obviously allowed them to go at each other no holds barred - the intensity of many of their scenes is painfully honest.

And the story behind this movie really gave the characters some real issues and contradictions that contribute a lot of how they act in this particular story. For example, Frank is shown to have an affair and then come home to his family throwing him a special birthday party. April on the other hand becomes increasingly detached as the movie progresses as she continues to aspire for more in her life, whatever ""more"" is supposed to mean.

The movie is not a happy one, that is for certain. But to be fair, the acting, especially by Kate Winslet, is pretty stellar and they really know how to flesh out the full range of emotions that each of these characters go through as the story unfolds. And given Sam Mendes as director, the movie is quite the visual masterpiece, but in a manner that is more subtle than his other movies like American Beauty. In that film we were treated to visual spectacles like the scene with the roses (you know which one I'm talking about, yes?) whereas he we have set pieces that play out amazingly well in a stark brightness that tries to push the image of happy suburbia. The lies the contrast (or the juxtaposition if you will), that as much as most of the movie is bright and full of sunshine, we as viewers are in fact watching a relationship fall apart bit by bit.

While I don't expect all movies to be happy, I think the story could have used some bright moments here and there. All throughout it seems to just get heavier and heavier, which is probably why I had issues really immersing myself in the story.

DiCaprio and Winslet star as Frank and April, a young couple with dreams of ditching their humdrum suburban existence for the freedom and excitement of Paris; however, circumstance stymies them, and resentment follows. Revolutionary Road looks immaculate, and the performances are outstanding, but I feel the movie is more tasteful than emotionally resonant.",1320969600,,624,5.578947368421052
3165192,3,B0016Q2D66,"Eleven years after their mega-hit ""Titanic,"" Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio reunite for ""Revolutionary Road,"" released in January, 2009. Kate has shed her unappealing baby fat and is now a curvy beauty, whereas Leonardo is definitely a man and no longer has that boyish vibe.

""Revolutionary Road"" is a drama about a couple with two kids living in the suburbs of Connecticut in the '50s. Frank Wheeler (DiCaprio) marches off to the big city five times a week, ten hours a day, to a job he hates, whereas April (Kate) takes care of things on the home front, including their hardly-seen children. April's dream of being an actress has failed and she vents her frustrations on Frank. Feeling emasculated, Frank has a meaningless affair to prove his manhood to himself. Meanwhile April comes up with a wild idea for them to move to Paris because Frank's war tales describe it as a place of total exhilaration and April desperately wants Frank to regain that aura of vitality he had when they first met. Will they escape the miserable corner they've painted themselves into or will they join the masses of living dead in their midst?

I enjoy a good drama now and then, like the excellent ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snow-Angels/dp/B001DN0V02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snow Angels</a>,"" the potent ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grand-Canyon/dp/B000056BSJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grand Canyon</a>"" or the masterpiece ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dead-Poets-Society/dp/6305144168/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dead Poets Society</a>,"" but ""Revolutionary Road"" fails to achieve the greatness of those films, mainly because the characters and their story are fairly boring. The film's just not that engrossing, which is my main criteria for evaluating any flick.

Yet it does have some glimpses of greatness. For one, the movie possesses a very real bizarreness that's hard to explain. Seriously, this is easily one of the most slyly offbeat dramas I've ever seen. Secondly, Michael Shannon as John Givings, the mentally disturbed son of the real estate lady (Kathy Bates), is a fascinating character. Everyone else in the Wheeler's lives thinks their plans to give up their surburban paradise are crazy. Big surprise. But John sees the brilliance and necessity of the plan. In other words, the only person who 'gets' the plight of the Wheelers is this nigh-insane dude. But he's not really insane. John is gifted at seeing through a facade to get to the core of a matter, the awesome or awful truth. And he has no inhibitions about speaking his mind, good or bad. At heart, John is a beatnik, the 50's precursor to the hippie. He represents the first wave of the 60's counter-culture, a generation of youth who discerned the cracks in the post-war ""paradise,"" and spit on it, for better or worse.

The film raises some important questions: Is life just having a marriage, a family, a well-paying job (you loathe) and a nice home in the pleasant suburbs, plus cigarettes and drinks without end? Or is their more? What about love? What about genuineness? What about unrealized, unused or ignored talents and dreams? What about (gasp) God?

""Revolutionary Road"" has some other positives: it's expertly made, has a good score by Thomas Newman and evokes some haunting moments.

The film was shot in Connecticut & NYC and runs almost 2 hours.

FINAL WORD: Because of the unengrossing characters and story, I can only give ""Revolutionary Road"" a strong 3 Stars or C+. But I can see why others rate it higher because it does have flashes of greatness and it definitely makes you reflect on its themes. In some ways, the same message is addressed in ""Dead Poets Society"" (and ""Grand Canyon"" to a lesser extent) -- rejecting the box society tries to confine you, throwing caution to the wind, and going after your dreams -- the difference is that ""Dead Poets Society"" (and ""Grand Canyon"") accomplished this with a captivating story whereas ""Revolutionary Road"" doesn't. Generally speaking, that is.

But this is a film that might be better on repeat viewings. We'll see. I'll be sure to adjust my rating if it is.

In any event, it's definitely worth catching if these themes trip your trigger.",1320019200,,4308,5.323529411764706

3165195,4,B0016Q2D66,"Revolutionary Road is a very watchable emotional rollercoaster of a film which develops more like a melodrama play than a film. Intensely character based it persists in defying roles and status: wives and husbands, man and woman, work and not work.

Overacting is resisted, but only just. The existence of the 'mature' son who is from the State psychiatric clinic brilliantly brings in the truth for all concerned. He speaks without social filter and this after the truth has been defined as something wonderful and self-fulfilling - like going to war.

Hope is being analysed in Revolutionary Road. There are many twists and turns in the suburban tale not unlike the Picasso (?) painting on a wall in one scene. The story also has a surreal element to it and not just when they wonder into the woods.

The director is very careful to keep us visually interested with as many different places for scenes as he can muster in what is an entirely story based movie. No crawling through a sewer to freedom here (Shawshank).

The dialogue is a little too textual at times. Characters speaking sentences which look good on a printed page but are strained when enunciated.

Revolutionary Road is a wonderful movie and I highly suggest others watch it.  To me, it shows what happens when people DO fall into the mundane motions of every day so called normal life.  Why is it that we are expected to grow up, marry, have kids and just survive day to day. When we are all younger, we have dreams and fantasies of what life should be like.  It's only when we reach adulthood that our dreams are crushed by society and it's definition of what is right and wrong.  Sam Mendes, Kate and Leo were brave enought to make a statement about that with this movie.  Another part I liked was the idea of taking someones dreams away from them. I won't comment too much more on that because of spoiler issues but take away someone's dreams....you take away their very will to live.  They begin to just exist.  Watch this movie.

I wanted to have a hose to flush the memory of it from my brain.  This ranks up there at the top of my list of worst movies ever made.  I like DiCaprio a lot, and have several of his movies, but I think he and Winslet just wanted the paycheck.

This movie is a strong statement about the gender-defined ""roles"" everyone was expected to play until the 1970's, and how trying to fit into those sterotyped roles stifled and suffocated. The movies' basic tenet is that anyone who married, had children, had a nice house in the suburbs with enough money, (i.e. played their roles) couldn't possibly have been happy or fulfilled. The only way to be happy and fulfilled would be to always be a totally self-indulgent child who goes through life only doing what feels good at the moment.  Responsibility is to be shunned, since it forces one to maybe have to do something that is not ""fun.""

The movie offers no insight into their personalities or motivations, no interaction with their two children or anything else that would elevate them from shallow, one-dimensional, paper cut-out dolls.

DiCaprio and Winslet are excellent actors.  But two hours of watching them fight visciously and tear apart themselves, their marriage, their lives and possibly their childrens' lives is not entertainment.  It is shallow, narcissistic voyeurism.

3165210,4,B0016Q2D66,"`Revolutionary Road' is one of those films that although not especially `positive' or `happy' is very well written and acted and draws you in from the start. Following a successful couple who seem to have it all, good job, nice house, two children and a happy marriage, this film explores how all is not quite what it seems and the tensions and frustrations that simmer away beneath any marriage. The acting from both Di Caprio and Winslet is fantastic and the natural chemistry between them makes the love and fight scenes all the more potent. This film is infused with a sense of sadness throughout as you see the couple go from carefree, idealistic young adults to a confused, frustrated and angry set in their ways couple. This film also looks at how the good and bad things in life can trap you into set patterns that don't fulfil you, things like a pay rise or promotion or a pregnancy that alter your plans for the future. The fifties set pieces and costumes are great, as is the directing from Mendes and this film is a very polished affair. You won't walk away with a spring in your step, but that isn't necessary every time you watch a film, and the overall effect at the end is so powerful that this is well worth a watch. This may be deemed by some as bleak, but life isn't always a bunch of roses and it's good to see Hollywood acknowledge that for a change.

3165212,4,B0016Q2D66,"Revolutionary Road (2008) is a film that is fearless in asking the big questions of life...and looking at the answers that our culture provides and that we provide for ourselves. While set in the suburbs of mid-50s America, the movie feels just as relevant and present today as then. For when it comes to marriage, relationships, family, career, and dreams, the questions and answers around those things are timeless. Director Sam Mendes, who made the Oscar-winning Best Picture American Beauty (1999), has crafted a very similar picture here, set 50 years earlier but with the same basic story of a married couple in the suburbs who are at a stage in their lives and marriage where they are not sure what to do and how to live. The couple in Revolutionary Road, played flawlessly by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, are almost like the 1950's parents of the couple played by Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening in American Beauty. The parallels between the two movies have been shared by many other viewers and critics of the film I'm sure.

While I think American Beauty looks at the big questions in a slightly more dramatic and cinematic way, the subtlety of Revolutionary Road is just as powerful if one pays attention to it. Which I really noticed today on my second viewing of the film after seeing it over a year ago when it first came out on DVD. I give American Beauty 4 stars out of 5 and Revolutionary Road 3.5 stars out of 5. Both are adult dramas and very well crafted films with great writing, acting, cinematography, and music. I'm surprised that Revolutionary Road wasn't nominated for more Oscars than the three minor categories it was. But I think the Academy probably felt that this was another American Beauty, which won 5 Oscars, and so it passed it by for other films that year, such as The Reader (2008), which also starred Kate Winslet and for which she won an Oscar for Best Actress. The Reader is a good film as well (I also give it 3.5 out of 5 stars), but I actually felt that Winslet was better and more deserving of her Best Actress Oscar for her work in this film.

As Revolutionary Road unfolds, we see DiCaprio and Winslet's characters, Frank and April Wheeler, both mature and become cynical. It's April's ""failed"" final  appearance on stage as an aspiring actress, the dream career that she's had all her life, that seems to trigger something deep inside her...and inside Frank. After pondering this failure and fighting with Frank, April comes up with the idea that they should quit their ""American Dream"" life and move to Europe, specifically Paris, France. Frank had visited Paris as a young man and loved it more than any other place. Having failed at making her dreams come true, I think April now wants to live vicariously through Frank going after his dream career in his dream place. Since she seemingly can't make her dreams come true, she now wants Frank to make his come true. But Frank has fallen into the easy suburban ""Father Knows Best"" lifestyle in the suburbs, and he doesn't realize that he actually loves it. So initially, he gets excited by April's idea of moving the family to France, where she will work and support him as he ""finds himself"". With this exciting and reinvigorating change upcoming, Frank starts taking risks at his job, which actually pay off with an offer for a huge promotion. And when Frank finds out that April is pregnant with their third child, he knows then that what he wants is his family life that they already have more than anything else. That's who he is. He just didn't know it before.

Part of what is interesting to me about Revolutionary Road is that the typical male/female gender roles are reversed in this film. Frank is really the stable family-oriented parent, and April is the free-willing risk-taking parent. I assume that there must have been men and women that did fit into these roles in the 50's just like today, even though our history books don't usually talk about it. Instead we usually get the stereotypical gender roles presented to us through 50s nostalgia. But I like that Revolutionary Road explores these issues by taking a more ""modern"" or current view on the big life questions through role reversals. I think it makes the viewer, or at least me personally, look at these questions of purpose, happiness, and what I want in my life as universal human questions that have nothing to do with gender or the time in which we live. The fear that we all must confront in asking and answering these questions for ourselves is the same regardless of the context in which we are in.

Revolutionary Road is a smart, mature adult film well worth watching. By ""escaping"" into the past, it actually helps us look at ourselves in the present.",1287878400,2,4741,4.686674669867947
3165213,4,B0016Q2D66,"Revolutionary Road....My 30 something daughter recommended this to me as a must see. I was a bit reluctant at first with the cliche reuniting of Leo and Kate, so about 8 months later I watched it.

It is about the angst of relationships, centering on the wobbly marriage of a couple who bought the ""everything will be perfect, if we just find our picture-perfect house"" etc... Well, years and two children later, boy and girl, things just don't appear to be settling into the halcyon days promised. By every 50's standard, they had it all.

What Revolutionary Road poses is basically who are the ""they"" who write these rules in life, who promise paradise and deliver reality? When, where and what date did people let the ""norm"" become the only reality acceptable? When did he and she lose track of the ideas, dreams, hopes that get us through each redundant, mind-numbing day? Is the pioneer/adventurous spirit totally annihilated in this day and age? Have we,ourselves, been packaged, advertised and sold as a product that just fills in the spaces for society?

This is an adult movie by fact that the issues it deals with are grownup problems. Having grown up in the fifties, I remember when if you knew someone who was divorced, well there just had to be adultery there (heard of 2 divorces in my entire childhood!). Why? .....people stayed together, regardless! That is just the way it was. Many of us have lived through a lot of what this couple faces...the fights, the frustrations on both sides, having the 'perfect house"" and still leaving one day when we could no longer say ""I love you"" and mean it!

Leo and Kate give superb performances as the troubled couple. They play the pathos with honesty and care. She is crying while doing the dishes. He is breaking things in anger and frustration. Friends and family are oblivious to the agony they feel inside. She needs to go outside just to breathe. He won't let things go until he ""fixes"" the situation. Kathy Bates also delivers a bravura performance as the local real estate agent. Her character's ""crazy"" son embodies the Devil's advocate. In the end, we wonder....who is the crazier in this situation?

Well worth the viewing all the way to the end, Revolutionary Road lets us stop and look, stand back and view ourselves, our lives from the outside. For those thinking of marriage, for those 30 somethings who will relate, for people like me who have been there, done that and now market the T-shirt, this movie evokes those deeper emotions we stow away til a convenient time. It makes us pause and remember, any day, any time, I can retake my life. I AM the captain of my own ship...IF I take ownership of it!

My last thoughts as this movie ended, I sent to my daughter with thanks for the recommendation : )

""Every day we rewrite our lives, taking the fragments and rearranging them to suit the needs of the moment. Sometimes, the decisions we make, based on those fabricated collages of our existence, take us down a road from which we can never return. Some things are irreversible. Be careful how you chose. The mind tricks us into believing we are on the right path, because it is easier to believe the lie than face the truth, sometimes.""

...quick thought...revolutionary as in fighting against the status quo...or revolutionary as in you revolved and ended up right where you started from???????????...may be both????

Time to get off the roundabout!

Great movie...watch it! OR, like my daughter buy it! : )",1287619200,4,3483,4.723228995057661
3165214,5,B0016Q2D66,"Just before things take a turn for the worse, Frank Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio) is dictating a letter. A line about inventory control underscores the heart of where he and his wife April (Kate Winslet) find themselves: ""Knowing what you've got, knowing what you need, knowing what you can do without..."" Those answers seemed clear until Frank second-guessed himself, tempted by offers of prestige and money. If there is one lesson I have learned in life and that I will continuously remind my children of, it is that second guessing yourself, going against what your instincts tell you, is always the wrong thing to do. Revolutionary Road is a movie about a couple who face this crossroad in life and differ as to the right direction they should take. April listens to her instincts despite the dark uncertainty of her choice. Frank follows the well-lit and safe path.
Revolutionary Road is a movie that splits people on either side, with those who feel it is a study in whiny, selfish, and immature suburbanites wishing for a better life than they currently have. Then there are those like me who felt a deep connection to them, in particular April; the one of the pair that seems the most trapped in the suburban dream and the one whose escape is the most critical
Of the two, April is largely attacked in reviews and I can't figure that out. She is the one accused of screwing things up and being the most difficult and unrealistic. Yet, she is the one who comes up with the idea to move to Paris as a gift to her husband. She is the one who realizes that ""living life as if it matters"" is beyond any price tag. If any one is at fault in my interpretation, it is Frank, who takes the path of least resistance and condemns his wife to a world of ""emptiness and hopelessness.""
What this movie does is give voice to the minority of people who, like Winslet's character, find themselves trapped inside someone else's dream. Some of us break through, but most stay there, slowly wilting and collapsing under the strain of denying oneself of their own needs, suppressing one's soul, and doing what you feel you are supposed to do. Understand clearly that I am not making an indictment of the suburbs et al. For most people in the world, most people I know, and most people living that life, there is not the oppressive feeling of wasting life and the angst therein. What I am saying is that there are those of us who do not feel the same way about that life choice and this movie speaks to us. It's knee-jerk to not only take offense at the dim view Revolutionary Road portrays of The American Dream, but furthermore to see the Wheelers as little more than a spoiled couple; the assumption being they have everything and still they want more. On the contrary, my opinion is that being spoiled means wanting more and yet not wanting to give up what you have. The character of April Wheeler does not want what she has and knows what she needs - not more, but something entirely different. For those who have been in her tormented shoes, Revolutionary Road is a place some of us call Hell.",1286755200,28,3083,4.546762589928058

Perhaps I'm simple minded or this movie just isn't my cup of tea.  Top flight actors and production but the subject matter is just too common and boring.  While others may write a detailed analysis, I have a single word that describes this suburban couple, spoiled.

Entertainment wise on the secondary market ""Revolutionary Road (2008)"" doesn't appear to have sustainable value compared to titles like ""Mulholland Drive (2001)"", ""While You Were Sleeping (1995)"", and ""Angel-A (2005).""  All of these titles have a much higher secondary market value than Revolutionary Road.

3165217,4,B0016Q2D66,"Revolutionary Road is one of the best heartwarming, lovey dovey, romances out there today. Ok, maybe not, but it's a good movie. Actually it reminds me of the play ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf?"" taken down or up a few notches. The plot was interesting. I really enjoyed watching how things panned out between the Wheelers. I think the film captures universal problems that all couples go through. I predict the film will certainly last the test of time. Some say the film never shows the couple before they came to terms of their mundane lives, but I don't think I would penalize the director, Sam Mendes for that. The film would have just been longer with unnecessary scenes. The film may be on initial viewing depressing, but I find it realistic. This was a much more effective approached as opposed to a typical sappy happy ending romance. The overall lesson I took from this is, don't blame your partner for not accomplishing what you want in life. A relationship can turn very one sided, usually in favor of the man. This isn't necessarily bad thing, but the film goes to show that a relationship definitely needs to be mutual in various aspects. Winslet did wonderful as usual for most of her films. I think she out acted DiCaprio. It's rather hard for me to imagine DiCaprio as the fatherly type. I especially like the character Bug (Michael Shannon). He was hilarious, yet he speaks the truth. I wish more people were like him, dry cut and dead on with realism. My favorite lines are during the monumental dispute towards the end.  This is not a film that I would watch over and over again, one time is effective enough.",1285718400,,1630,4.620689655172414
3165228,4,B0016Q2D66,"For those of you into music of the 70's, Revolutionary Road reminded me of Jackson Browne's song ""The Pretender,"" for its lines, ""Say a prayer for the pretender, who started out so young and strong only to surrender.""  Since that song reflected  the typical baby boomer attitude of those rejecting their parents' lives only to find themselves in the same trap, I would say the main characters Frank and April Weber were a little ahead of their times.

The picture took place in the 1950's, before computers entered the business world, before mothers had careers, and unfortunately before mental health issues were openly discussed.  The rebelliousness of the 60's was unimaginable, and the 70's ""me generation"" theory was years down the road.

This was a time when the ""American dream"" was everything, and people didn't question their happiness or lack of it.  Yet, while she voiced this only to her husband, all the characters would know what April meant when she said, ""No one forgets the truth - they just get better at lying.""

The acting was good - perhaps too good, since some scenes were disturbing.  I wasn't thrilled with April, but I did feel for her, as she was too poignant a character to easily let go, as the people on Revolutionary Road knew all too well.  Even more disturbing was the revelation that, in some way, we all live on this street, which no one leaves behind.

In spite of its depressing aspects, I really enjoyed this film, as it kept me on the edge of my seat.  I wouldn't recommend this for everyone, however, as it is not the love story some would expect, and it certainly didn't have a fairy-tale ending.  And even some less romantic people not needing that ""happily ever after effect,"" may still be left wondering what this story was all about.  But for those not afraid to venture down this road, it will be an unforgettable trip.",1285459200,2,1864,4.680981595092025

But even though most of the time they are telling the truth you can almost always sense that in some way they are somehow unhappy. This is what this flick is about. This movie captures the dark essence of family life. I'm not saying everyone who is married is unhappy. And not everyone of them ends in devorice. But there is a reason most do. I think the main reason people don't like this film is because it deals with aspects of life that are very upsetting.

Now that I got that out of the way let me get to the review. I think this is a great film. It's very well acted and brutality honest. If you don't mind watching a downer of a film you will find much to like about this tale of oppression. Can't family life feel like that sometimes?",1284336000,2,855,4.245398773006135
3165231,3,B0016Q2D66,"I really wanted to like this movie.  I loved American Beauty, which seems to have created its own sub-genre of suburb drama and discontentment such as weeds, six feet under, and even desperate houswives.  Sam Mendes, who directed American Beauty, is returning to the genre that made him famous, which he established, with a film adaptation of arguably the first work in the genre.  The movie is about how couples and lives grow apart, how we change when we get older, and is done so even more tragicly, that the couple is portrayed by the most famous onscreen couple working today.  The unoffical tag for this movie was a snickering, what would have eventually happened if Jack hadn't died.  But the movie doesn't ever really get working.  As much as I want to like him, Sam Mendes just hasn't done anything substantial since his debut.  I wanted to like Road to Perdition but ultimately it was too distant to connect to, and preachy in its morals of forgiveness.  I did enjoy Jarhead, and thought it was better, but it was kind of empty, and I didn't really think on it again after I was done watching and haven't wanted to watch sense.  This is by far his worst effort.  It never really works except on the frankness of its dialogue on where it attempts to go, and you do have to give it credit for covering this subject matter, but its no longer as controversial as it was when American Beauty came out, and goes nowhere to go up the ante.  I don't suggest that it should merely try to shock us, but I couldn't help but think that I had seen this before, and done better elsewhere.  The characters never seem fully developed, and come off as one dimentional.  I read a couple of reviewers complain that the movie doesn't show enough, that there are too many general concepts thrown around in the movie, and I can understand that to a point.  Usually when that technique is used in film it is because you are about to be shown a lot of information, and the film maker doesn't want to bog down the viewer, but nothing really happens in this.  American Beauty seemed multilayered and this just isn't.  The cenimatography in this film is very well done, and there is a lot of polish, just like in most of Sam's films, but it still leaves you disconnected, and doesn't seem to have a purpose or a focal point for why things are viewed the way that they are.  When in comes to genres, usually one of two things are true: The original work in the genre defines the concept at its most basic element so completely that it demands study, forcing followers to either copy or take in new directions, or just faintly outlines a concept and it is later through different adaptations that you get the seminal work.  I haven't read the book, but from the adaptation here, I have to say the only new concept to movie watchers is the analogy to plain living in suburbs to the conservative era of the 50's model housewife, and the dull and restrictive confines of what society wants for them. The movie looks drab, the characters act drab, its not depressing, as much as boring.  This is shown amazing well in Six Feet Under, which is written by the writer of American Beauty, Alan Ball, in which the charcters have to act out and are restrained because of obligation, and they have friends that have lives they want, and there is yearning, and sadness.  This just seems like dull lives, and the people living it endlessly complaining.  The desires are talked about, but it seems so abstract, wanting to go to Paris, that the audience doesn't want to go to Paris, or want its Characters to go to Paris.  All that is really portrayed in this film is two people with nothing in common, who get married, and grow to hate each other, and the only time they seem to be happy is when they are making childish plans that cater to fantasies they had when they were younger.  There are no relatable or interesting characters, save the mental patient who defies the culture of the time, and tells the couple how horrible they are, when I don't think that either character is horrible.  I wonder what he would say about this movie?  Same Mendes, and Kate Winslet divorced after this, I would love to see Sam do something with some passion and take from this rather than do some pretentious work that he dug up.",1281139200,2,4284,4.489690721649485

Richard Yates apparently believes anyone that we dare say is ""happy"" in their ""Americana"" lifestyle HE portrays is simple minded. We are all liars going through the motions of life, unless of course we move to Europe, smoke alot while sitting at a corner cafe with a French beret on. Sheesh!! These people are the authentic real people? This reeks of pure pretention to me, and is somewhat insulting to anyone with any sense of obligation to someone beside themselves.
The truth is even the roads LESS traveled can be at times boring and unfullfiling. I have always marched to the beat of my own drum and I am at my happiest when I am creative, so I do ""get it"" How when we are not working or living a creative life it can be mundane. However; I can also see the joy that may come from actually having a family, children etc.  Why does Yates potray this in an either/ or way? Why is there no mending of the two? Why is everything in Yate's story so black and white? If you are not ALWAYS, 100% in sync with everything YOU want, even the risk of death would be better! April is one of thee most unlikable characters ever written/ or potrayed in film. Her need to be free is not for any noble reasons, just purely selfish. April would be unhappy no matter what the scenario; living in the suburbs ( the bad, bad suburbs) or in Paris ( her ideal utopia.) Basically, she is a spoiled brat of mediocare talent who is delusional and childish. There is no motivation other than one's own selfish consuming wants in almost every character. I can enjoy a book/movie who's views do not align with my own but could not enjoy this book/ movie for the reasons mentioned. Spoiled and bratty with no redeeming qualities or the slight chance to evoke sympathy does not a good story make. They are merely caricatures to insure Yate'e gets his message across.

Winslet plays April Wheeler, a stifled suburban housewife, opposite Leonardo DiCaprio's Frank Wheeler. In the 1950s, the couple marries and moves out of the city due to an unexpected pregnancy. Their dreams of living abroad, treading the boards, etc., are pushed aside to make way for the realities of life with two kids.

One day, April comes up with a novel idea - chuck it all and move to Paris. After some persuading, Frank agrees, and the two begin planning their adventure. As they do so, April and Frank are happier and more in love than they've been in a long time. However, another unplanned pregnancy dashes their dreams of living abroad, and their lives together crumble as a result.

This movie is a study of two things: social mores of the 1950s and the disintegration of a marriage. Both illustrations are fascinating. Performances are more than solid (Both Winslet and DiCaprio are masterful in some of the final scenes.), and the careful recreation of 1950s suburbia is remarkable to observe.

3165249,5,B0016Q2D66,"I have to admit that I was never much of a Leonardo DiCaprio fan and I had even written Kate Winslet off as a 'flash in the pan' when she co-starred with him in Titanic. Two Academy Awards and some amazing performances by Kate and equally terrific roles by Leo changed my mind. So, I decided to give Revolutionary Road a look, first on HBO.  I was absolutely mesmerized, but I did have negative feelings about the conclusion of the story.. you see I alllowed my conventional taste for cinema to overrule my better judgment in a way.  This happens all the time with the public and Hollywood films, and is why so few movies that challenge, trouble, or stir us are ever produced.

I was haunted by what I saw, and decided to watch a second time.  This time, I focused on the superb acting ao ably captured by the Director, Sam Mendes ('American Beauty' Director and the soon-to-be-former-'Mr. Kate Winslet'). I noticed faces, expressions, emotion; all real, gritty, searing, heart-rending.  The viewer's desire for plot conclusions is thwarted continually, yet the viewer's thirst for challenging material is quenched minute by minute.

Gone, is the 'pretty boy' DiCaprio of 'Titanic.'  In his place is the polished, slightly weathered, infinitely deeper actor who fits easily and convincingly into complex adult roles; and there are few more so than Frank Wheeler in this film.  Wheeler is a 1950's post Depression dreamer-turned WWII soldier-turned reluctant New York businessman paired with a die-hard idealist wife named April (Winslet).  Marital conflict is frequent and intense in the Wheeler marriage as Frank, some will argue, 'grows up' and accepts a successful career and life and friends in suburban Connecticut, while April refuses to really 'let go' of the dreams she once shared with Frank.

Prepare yourself for tension, conflict and surprise dramatic developments.  Also, I must mention Milly, unbelievably well-portrayed by actress Kathryn Hahn.  Keep your eyes on her face about halfway through the film in a key scenewhere the Wheelers spend an evening at their neighbor's home and reveal their rather unconventional future plans.  I'll never forget Hahn in that scene.

Love is not the magic cure for problems; sometimes it might make problems even worse. When two people are in love and faced with life's crisis, what are they to do? What are we to do, when our minds take a life of their own and our decisions are separated from our passion, and might lead to our moral demise?

- When Leonardo hit the car with his fist, it looked like it didn't hurt at all.  It reminded me of the same scene in ""The Departed.""
- All of Kate Winslet's diologue was vague.  She didn't explain anything at all.  What hopelessness?  Why is Paris that much better besides it being a place where people are ""alive.""  What does that even mean?  How are they more alive?  How are we less alive?  What's wrong with doing things people do in Paris in the suburbs?  Is painting against the law?  Is quitting your job for six months against the law?  Why can't Frank just take a leave of absense from his job?  Then he could find out what he wanted to do here.  Why is this movie necessary?
- The audience was ""told"" that April was a bad actor.  We never see her act though.  And she just gives up?  After one bad performance?  that we didn't even see?  Why not attend acting clases?  Read books?  Study films and plays?  Be in another play?  She complains about Frank being a loser for not going after what he wants, but how much better is she?  One bad review, and no more acting?  Damn, what a loser.
- Kathy Bates looked deranged.  Her makeup, although possiblly period accurate, was just atrocious.
- Kathy Bates saying ""NOOO Frank he's not well!!!"" looked like a stage performance.
- This line of dialogue; ""Come one step closer and i'll scream"" (one step closer) ""AAAHHHH"" Frank even bends over, covering his ears.  This might look ok on stage, as you don't want to scream as loud as possible, but you want the audience to think you did.  In the movie it looks stupid and terrible.
- What the hell is wrong with suburbia?  It looks pretty awesome.  What the hell is April talking about when she mentions ""hopelessness?""  If it's so bad, why don't they just move back to the city, they seemed much happier there.
- Why does April think Franch has better government jobs than America?  I've never heard this.
- I find it hard to believe that a lot of people fall in love in Rom-coms.  This was the opposite.  Why did these people hate each other so much?  Why did April say she loathed Frank, and then made him breakfest?  Why is the sun shining directly over heard when Frank is suppose to be going to work to get his promotion?  They had kids.  Frank had a great job.  It didn't make any sense, or it was awfully done.  Why did April think of Frank as ""just some boy that made her laugh at a party once.""?  I thought he was the most interesting person she ever met?  Did the writers forget?
- The soudtrack, oh gawd the soundtrack.  I kept thinking ""make it stop, make it stop""  The same 10 second loop, over and over and over.  Damn that was awful.  It was not menacing.  it was not dramatic.  It was ear-splintering, mind-numbingly, coma-inducing awful.
- Speaking of the former, that scene at the end where the realtor's husband turns off his hearind aid, and we get a glimpse of silence.  That was awesome.
- How can you watch this movie more than once?  A women gives herself an abortion, bleeds on the carpet and through her dress, and dies.  That sucked the first time.  I can't see anyone watching this movie more than once, knowing that that's coming up, without skipping past it.
- Why didn't April go see a psychiatrist?
- Why was Frank's work terrible, then being praised by the CEO?  Again, telling us it was bad, instead of showing us why it was bad.  Show, don't tell!!!
- The sex scenes. Two sex scenes.  Both lasted 10 seconds, without even a camera change to make it seem like they lasted longer.  Again, this works on stage, but not in a movie!!  Two guys blow within 10 seconds!!! No wonder April has a terrible life.

I could go on, but i can't.  This movie was awful.  Don't believe the critics.  It's not worth seeing.  I haven't read the book yet, but i also heard that was excellent, so i think i might just to try and figure out what the hell this movie might've been trying to do.

3165254,2,B0016Q2D66,"""Revolutionary Road"" is about a bored, ungrateful woman who has a comfortable life and whose biggest problem is that she really doesnt have any problems, aside from the problem of living in a dream world and looking around to see that reality just doesn't measure up. That is her biggest problem. She is like one of those people who are in love with the idea of love but really don't know and wouldnt know what to actually do with it if it came to them.

The main character played by Kate Winslet is married to a hard working, loving husband (Leo DiCaprio) who has a good paying job which has allowed them to lead a comfortable suburban upper middle class lifestyle with their two children. But that is not enough for April (Kate Winslet). She feels trapped and as if she has not done enough with her life. So she starts nagging her husband and tries to convince him to sell the house, uproot the family and move to France (!). Minor details, such as how they are going to make a living or even maintain their curent standard of living in a foreign country where they don't speak the language, are not further explored. Naturally, her husband is resistant to the idea and just like any sane person in their right mind cannot get behind his wife's notion of just leaving the country on a whim to go to France to do exactly what....eat croissants? No amount of reasoning works with her, however, and through her passive aggressiveness and constant whining and crying she pretty much promises to make his life a living hell if he does not cave in to her far-fetched, immature and selfish fantasies.

The movie tries to paint April's problems and her character in a sympathetic light; like someone who is above it all, misunderstood, disillusioned; someone we all could empathize with and whose struggles we understand. In reality, what it records is callow, immature and superficial behavior by a spoiled, ungrateful and unlikable woman who has way more than she really deserves given her ungrateful attitude. She is someone who does not inspire us to wish we knew her better but someone we just want to slap everytime she starts whining and throwing fits because she cannot make her life be the fantasy she'd like it to be.

The movie is a melodrama, trying to create deep seated problems and psychological struggles ex nihilo. It is as if the writers were trying to force depth and deeper philosophical questions into the story, where in reality there is just shallowness. April spends nearly every scene either staring longingly out of the window or with tears in her eyes, about to burst into a hysterical sob because....what...she doesnt have enough real problems in her life and has lost perspective of the things that really matter. She is like a little child who throws a fit if she doesnt get exactly what she wants.

When Frank, after having first agreed to go with her, changes his mind due to the promotion he finally got at work, April loses it completely, gives herself a home abortion which goes awfully wrong and then dies.

In the end, this movie leaves you unsatisfied and makes you wonder what the hell the problem actually is with April who strikes one as an incredibly immature and selfish person. Granted, suburban life can be suffocating and meaningless; ""American Beauty"" gave us a glimpse into that portion of life that just seems to resemble hell, but April's reaction and attitude are pathological. Unlike Kevin Spacey's character in ""American Beauty"", she is not someone who is parched for love and goes ballistic. She simply does not have much love within her to begin with. She couldn't possibly be parched for something she never had. She seems to lack a moral center and only sees herself. She is not a particularly  loving mother to her children or kind wife to her husband. She treats her family as some kind of nuisance that is in her way and needs to be removed. Frank is erroneously pictured as a selfish man because he is responsible enough to have a job and provide for his family and not want to run off to some random country living in a fantasy, while April, who is the real self centered prig here, is painted as the deep, sensitive rebel who can supposedly see through the phoniness. But she is the phony and it is because of her phoniness and selfishness that she is ultimately miserable. You watch this movie for two hours and wonder what the hell is actually wrong with this woman that she is constantly sad. Objectively, her life is not all that bad - in fact it is great and she is blessed in many ways. In the end you realize that all April really needs is therapy and that obviously she is not a dreamer, but mentally ill.

""A good movie is not what it's about, it how it's about it"". This movie is slow and comatose - from the music to the script and the interaction of the characters with one another. The production aspect of it is great, but everything else is lacking. Whereas in ""American Beauty"" the issue of suburban inertia was tackled with wit and irony and, most importantly, from the heart, the struggles of the characters in Revolutionary Road just seem insincere and it makes it hard to sympathize with someone so out of touch and irrational. The audience is always kept at bay and never given the opportunity to identify with either April or Frank - probably because, unlike Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) in ""American Beauty"", we don't really see much of ourselves and our demons in Frank's and especially April's phony problems.",1266451200,3,5492,4.6440329218107
3165255,4,B0016Q2D66,"The concept is cleverly vague enough that the people this film is criticizing (those trapped within the cycle of living out their dreams exactly like the person next to them) will completely miss the point of it all. The fact is the narrative is not the typical storyline of a couple who encounters problems and is able to weather the storm towards saving their relationship. Yes, they encounter bumps in the relationship but they cannot find a resolution.

The absence of a 'happy' ending makes people cringe because in general, most like to go to the movies to escape reality, not see a numbing representation of the reality of the world. What is that reality? Well, I wouldn't be doing you any favors if I pointed that out nor would I advertise myself as one who could neatly simplify it in a few paragraphs.

I will say however that director Sam Mendes is able to let the events unfold with such care while maintaining an ever-growing presence of uneasiness, that eventually culminates in a crescendo of enormous proportions. Inevitably, this force will cause you to re-examine your relationships present, past and future. Now, I've never been a fan of DiCaprio but I must say with the right director, the man can deliver a good performance. I believe the chemistry with Winslet also helped sell his performance as a man who promised himself more than he could deliver. He is afraid of failing and potentially admitting his own mediocrity while Winslet portrays a woman who is unable to reconcile the need to aspire for something more fulfilling for her existence with the stagnant compromises her husband keeps making for their own good.

Of course, this movie takes place in the 1950's and many will argue things are different today. However, I fear compromise between the genders in relationships will always be a challenge, no matter the period.

The cinematography, set designs, costumes, etc. are all well suited to the times and work flawlessly to integrate the characters in their environment rather than make it look 'stagey'. The clever use of sound/music definitely adds to the emotional turmoil that drives these people to do what they feel they must, and the end scene is no exception. That last scene alone filled me with deep sadness & hopelessness posing the question 'What's the point then?'

I used to think like The Beatles and all you needed was love. Now, I know they were just trying to sell records. Don't get me wrong though, I did like the film tremendously and although the film is hard to watch at times, the hardest things we do are the ones that are worth doing.",1265932800,6,2595,4.783482142857143

This goes on for most of the movie. I found myself asking the question...why?  What is this all for?! It lacked plot, purpose, and flow in the storyline.

How many films do we need to remind us that the 1950s wasn't such a great time to be alive? And that all those neatly manicured lawns and sharp-looking fedoras came at a price? I assume films like this are aimed toward Baby Boomers who bore younger people with endless tales about how great their 1950s childhoods were. For the rest of us, this is just a soap opera. Yes, there was conformity. Yes, there wasn't a birth control pill and women had to do their own abortions. Yes, men had to be the sole breadwinners and had to put their family first. Yes, the suburbs are soul-killing and boring. Even Winslet's role felt derivative, an updated version of her character in ""Jude the Obscure"". Every plot twist was signaled a mile away. When DiCaprio eyes a sexy brunette in the office, I said to my friend, ""they will have an affair."" They do. When Winslet starts dancing with her handsome neighbor, I said, ""they will have an affair."" They do. When DiCaprio goes back to being an office drudge, I said, ""she will kill herself, I bet."" And she basically does. No surprises, just a drawn out melodrama with doses of star power, some self-important social commentary and yes, the enlightening revelation that the 1950s were, indeed, a repressive era.",1264464000,2,1368,4.704166666666667
3165269,4,B0016Q2D66,"Dark period piece about a 1950's couple (Winsett and DeCaprio) who meet at a party in Manhattan.  She is an aspiring actress and he is a fun guy with very few aspirations other than being something like a delivery guy.

The scene shifts forward a few years and Kate is in a play that is apparently a dud.  Leo, now her husband, tries to comfort her saying that at least she was the best thing about the dismal play.  This does nothing to quell her disappointment.  He than pulls the car over (they were driving) and starts yelling at her, telling her that it is unfair for her to be blaming him for her failure (this was not true).  He nearly hits her and this scene is a harbinger of things to come.

Throughout the film it seems that Kate's dreams are constantly shattered while Leo muddle's through life oblivious to her needs.  Kate feels that her life as a housewife in a suburban home with two kids (that was supposed to be the American dream back then) is a boring existance and her husband constantly tells her how boring his job is and that he only keeps it to pay the bills.

Kate comes up with an idea where they will go to Paris to live.  Leo had always told her it was the most fun place he had ever been to.  She thinks that this would be perfect as she would put meaning to both of their lives where she can work and support him until he figures out what he wants to do rather than toil away at something meaningless.

The whole thing sounds like a chance to live out a possible dream but Leo does everything to thwart it.  Whether it be starting up an affair with a girl in the steno pool or wanting to stay at the job he has because his father worked there for twenty years.

The realtor (Cathy Bates) that sold them their house becomes a regular friend of theirs and convinces them to let her bring her son to visit even though he currently resides in a mental institution.  The son may be crazy but he is the only one who sees their relationship for what it really is and has an uncanny knack for seeing through lies.

As the movie goes on Leo keeps killing his wife's dreams to a point that she becomes unfeeling and kind of crazy herself.  I liked this film for showing that the American dream of the 50's wasn't all it was cracked up to be.",1264291200,,2262,4.199074074074074

I knew it was about 2 idealists trying to slum it in the suburbs but the real message for me was how hopelessly trapped the Kate Winslet character was by motherhood. This is very much the tone of feminist literature of the period; the stranglehold of fertility.

I loved the movie and saw, clearly, many aspects of the lives of my mother and aunts of the period...chained by child after child. It is a cautionary tale and a breathtaking one.

3165271,4,B0016Q2D66,"I disagree with most of the reviewers here.  Most view this film as one of a dysfunctional marriage set in the monotone that was the 1950s.  On the other hand, if the film had been set in the 1960s, it would have been viewed as a dysfunctional couple in which one [April] was determined to abandon the 'straight' life whereas her husband [Frank], simply couldn't, with the tragedy that ensues.

As a person who was always uncomfortable with socalled societal conventions, I see it otherwise.  April is determined to shake things up but her 'shake up' has no real direction.  She wants to relocate to Paris without really knowing anything about it....  As third party viewers, we recognize that Paris will prove even more disappointing than Connecticut.  Her husband, Frank, who has been to Paris, is initially carried away by his wife's dream but, learning of her pregnancy, he is jerked back into reality.  Not April.

April, who was probably always psychiatrically fragile, slides inexorably into mental illness.  Severe mental illness is tragic as is demonstrated graphically in the grim ending of this well-acted tale.

3165273,4,B0016Q2D66,"Starring Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, this 2008 film is about a marriage in the 1950s.  It's a time of conformity, suburban living, stay-at-home mothers and a lot of smoking and drinking.  Directed by Sam Mendes, there is an edge to this film, and the viewer immediately senses the despair beneath the seemingly happy veneer that this couple puts forth.  There's tension throughout as DiCaprio is bored with his job and seeks solace in a meaningless affair.  In the meantime, Winslet is home with two children and her hopes of being an actress have been dashed with a mediocre performance in a local theatrical production.  The couple argues a lot and it is clear there is something missing from their marriage.

And then one day Kate comes up with the idea of moving to Paris where she will support her husband as a secretary and he can ""find himself"".  Plans move ahead.  The neighbors are surprised and a bit jealous.  And the real estate agent, played by Kathy Bates, who has befriended the couple, brings her son, who has just been released from a mental institution where he has gone through electroshock treatments, into the couple's home for dinner.  Conflict ensues and he is the only one who voices some painful truths.

This film made me uncomfortable, as it was intended to be.  However, I couldn't take my eyes from the screen because I was interested in knowing how it would all turn out.  Kate Winslet gave a remarkably wonderful performance.  But in my opinion, Leonardo DiCaprio just can't act.  Whenever he was in a serious scene I just couldn't relate him to the character he was playing and I found myself thinking about his rather wooden performance.

While set in the 50's this could be a story of anytime. It is a story of relationships and self identification, of sacrifice and aspiration. Winslet and DiCaprio were excellent and proved their worth as actors.

Much of the complaining by other reviewers are probably somewhat motivated by or triggered by the stage in which this drama was set.

3165277,2,B0016Q2D66,"I am, frankly, amazed by the volumes of praise on this downer disaster. I give it two stars because of the excellent cinematography and fine art direction (with the exception of Winslet's hair!), but other than the look of the film, it's bad beyond reasonable expectation. I think Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio have done much better work - even in Titanic. In this film, Ms. Winslet fails in revealing her character April's inner motivation, and the bipolar Stepford-like personality reversals have no connection to the character's preceding behavior. It never makes sense or paints a full portrait of who this person is or strives (and fails) to be.

In the same vein, Mr. DiCaprio's Frank is somewhat sleazy and dishonest, but he's neither good enough nor vile enough to care about either way. The best moments were when he convincingly tries to get through to April, but most of the time he looks like a kid playing dress-up. This is the same actor who successfully played Howard Hughes, so the blame lies elsewhere - the direction and script.

Sam Mendes really blew it. The film begins disjointedly with a lackluster first meeting, jumping to a play that we don't get to see, and culminates in a blowout argument - roll titles!
New rule: If the movie doesn't click and grab you in the first 10 minutes, it's not going to, and this one never did. We never learn to care about these people because we have no reason to. My other major beef is, to my ears, the leads don't sound like the era they are supposed to inhabit; it's not at all convincing. Minor quibbles worth pointing out - the brief nudity when Frank bangs his also uninteresting secretary is gratuitous, and the sex scenes with April are unsexy. If banality is the point of the film, why make it?

The only saving graces are Kathy Bates, unsinkable as usual, and her creepy but energetic son as played by Michael Shannon. Just watch his scenes and skip the rest.",1262217600,2,1933,4.6627565982404695
3165288,4,B0016Q2D66,"Revolutionary Road, is a drama centered around the lives of a young suburban couple, in the 1950s. Frank Wheeler and his wife April, have been living out the American dream, as proscribed by 1950s social expectations. Frank has a decent job as an executive, which has allowed him to comfortably support his wife and two children.

There's trouble in paradise though, when April urges Frank to quit his job, which he hates, and move the family to Paris. Once in Paris, April wants to work at a high-paying administrative job, for the Parisian government. She is willing to support the family herself, while Frank takes time off to 'find himself'.

Skeptical at first, Frank warms-up to April's plan. But after being offered a lucrative promotion at his company, Frank becomes conflicted about moving away to Paris. Meanwhile, April admits to Frank that she no longer loves him. All emotional hell breaks loose in their marriage, as Frank confesses to having a fling with his secretary. And April then has a brief tryst with her neighbor's spouse, in their car one evening.

Things are further complicated in Frank and April's relationship, when April becomes unexpectedly pregnant with their third child. Feeling stifled and trapped as Frank's wife, April doesn't want the baby. And she's willing to take desperate measures, to end her pregnancy. As their marriage completely unravels, Frank and April come to realize the terrible compromises that they've both made, in order to conform to the absurd expectations of American life in the 1950s.

Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, are both well-matched as the stars of this movie. Leo radiates a compelling charisma, as Frank Wheeler. Leo makes the viewer believe that Frank Wheeler should be destined for better things, than his mundane work-a-day life. Kate Winslet as April Wheeler, does manage to outdo Leo's performance. Kate emotes with a skilled precision, giving enough of herself in each scene to be believable, without going overboard.

The supporting cast of this film, turns-in decent performances. Especially Kathy Bates as the Wheeler's simpering neighbor, Helen Givings. And Michael Shannon gives a standout performance, as Helen's son John, who endured brutal, and unnecessary psychiatric 'treatments'.

3165289,3,B0016Q2D66,"Obviously a labor of love for all concerned, Revolutionary Road comes to us after many decades of trying to bring it to the big screen by a long list of many of Hollywood's most talented creators.  All of them have run ashoal on the insurmountable problem odf the novel's structure.  Sam Mendes, the talented British director, thought he had it licked.  He didn't see the trouble coming from the opposite direction: while he was making this show, US television was delivering MAD MEN, a Revolutionary Road knockoff that manages to outdo the original in every direction.  Uh-oh, what a disaster, not in execution but just in comparison to the TV version, the Mendes picture just seems like a mighty waste of talent.

Others have listed the similarities, so I won't bother, but I will say that MAD MEN has made this picture not only superfluous but actually an object of curiosity.  Watching Kate and Leo in what seems like a dutiful recreation of the American 50s, I began feeling restless wondering why even bother putting it back in the 50s?  Wouldn't it have been more honest, less glamorous, if the filmmakers had made it happen today?  What would possibly have made the least amount of difference?  The Wheelers would have the same ennui at living unfulfilled lives.  April would still have been an awful actress (this was a holdover from the Yates original, one of the many ways in which we know that Yates hated women).  Her despair at being ten weeks pregnant, the way Frank uses this as a bargaining chip to make her stay home.  Everything could have taken place in 2008 and you wouldn't have a picture dripping with all that Kodachrome quaintness that ultimately ruins the picture.  These types of movies are made to make audiences feel better, as if to say, look how awful people had it back then, nothing like this could possibly happen today.

As the office mope who sleeps with friendly Frank, Zoe Kazan tries, but the writing just doesn't give her anything to work with.  Think of the various girls Don Draper has it on with, and the contrast is just humiliating to Mendes.  I love Richard Yates, always have, but we've come to a point when others do him better than he did himself (except for EASTER PARADE and A GOOD SCHOOL).",1261872000,3,2241,4.678571428571429

Nope! But, the crime this movie commits is that it drags on and on, spiraling down and down, into a pit of despair that finally culminates in a mother murdering her own unborn child.

Now isn't THAT an upbeat ending!

No. Movies don't ALL have to be ""Feel good"" or have happy endings, but, censors define obscenity as ..""having no redeeming social value.""By that definition, this movie should be completely rated X and condemned!.

Toward the end, I felt like this movie had been created (from the book) as a vehicle to showcase acting ability. Hard to enjoy performances, though, when the story content was so disturbing and awful.

Oh, Leonardo C., bless his heart, always looks like a little boy playing dress up...he cannot overcome his looks. He came close in the Irish Gangster movie with Jack Nicholson. But here, his face overrides his attempts to portray a mature male. Poor baby.

Oh well....so I wasn't exactly brief, and, YES, I hated this movie. I write this review only because my granddaughter sometimes reads my reviews and I feel it's my responsibility to see that she knows my opinion on this.

3165291,4,B0016Q2D66,"What makes Revolutionary Road stand out to me is the fact that, being patient and putting up with a relatively slow-moving storyline for the first 50% of it will gradually win you over by the time the movie has finished. I feel confident about this because there's a few twists and shockers at the end that I honestly never seen coming.  In order to appreciate these twists, you need to follow the entire film, even the boring parts.

Let's be honest- the first half of Revolutionary Road is slow, boring, and almost pointless. The majority of the first half consists of a young couple (the man played by Leonardo DiCaprio) having big aspirations in life, and the wife encouraging the two of them to go and live in Paris permanently with their two children.

Well, that never really happens because a bunch of obstacles come into the picture and cause a distraction for the young couple, one of them being that the wife is pregnant with another baby. As soon as we find out about the pregnancy, THIS is when the movie really picks up steam. An argument comes about, and then more problems follow suit. This all happens about halfway through the movie.

The first half though... yikes. A VERY slow moving storyline this one has.

Any time any mention of Leonardo DiCaprio's job position is mentioned, the storyline immediately sinks. This is just dull and uninspiring storytelling, and it's a horrible waste of time.

Kathy Bates plays a nice, if somewhat unimportant part in the movie, and like always her scenes are absolutely golden. When she brings her troubled son over and he carries on conversations with the young couple and sticks his nose where it doesn't belong concerning the relationship problems the young couple is having... haha, BAD things happen. I won't spoil it though.

This isn't a comedy- it's a drama with a twist at the end you need to see if you've been following the movie for the first half of it. It's a movie that tells a nice story, and that's about it.",1261785600,,1983,4.664756446991404

3165293,2,B0016Q2D66,"I've never felt more empty and cold after watching a movie before in my life.  I could completely relate to the Wheelers sense of ""entrapement"" in their average, suburban lives but where I feel that the story goes awry is that there is no redemptive, overall message at the end.  I'm not of the camp that says there has to be a clear, concise message at the end of every film, but this one is so depressing it needed something at the end to balance it out!  Otherwise, what's the point of sitting through the entire movie?  The Wheeler's aspire for something ""more"" (what that is exactly is never clear), their plans are foiled for various reasons and then things just spiral horrifically out of control at that point. THE END!  Maybe in 1961 when this story was written the theme of ""quiet desperation"" was new and interesting for people to contemplate but in 2008, I don't think there was anything new to bring to the table and of limited interest for most people!

The only semi-interesting thing that I can point out about this film is that both Wheelers want something more out of life but Frank at some point seems to realize that what they already have isn't so bad.  April, on the other hand, never seems to reach this realization!  Maybe that makes Frank a ""coward"" and maybe it makes him the smart one?!?  Who knows!  Everything's relative!

Lots of people lead lives of quiet desperation, some do something about it and are very successful, some try and fail and others never try at all.  There are a myriad of reasons (some within our control and others not) that contribute to these potential outcomes.  That's life and this isn't new ground!!

I gave the film 2 stars because Kate and Leo gave good performances, but unfortunately they were not good enough to elevate this movie above anything other than depressing!!",1259539200,,1831,4.628482972136223
3165294,3,B0016Q2D66,"Only the talents of DiCaprio and Kate Winslet keep this story watchable.
Otherwise it is a lame story.

In a nutshell, this movie keeps hammering the point that the 1950's were not really as wonderful as portrayed in classic shows like Andy Griffith and Happy Days.
The film also attempts to portray the American Dream and Suburban living as a lie and a depressing prison.

Okay ..... we all know the ""good old days"" were not as pure and innocent as Happy Days ------ BUT, at the other extreme -------- neither were they as depressing and jaded as Revolutionary Road.
Unless of course you were dysfunctional and mentally unstable and generally negative about living.

This film attempts to send a message that the good life of the 1950s was all a lie of fake smiles, depressions, frustration and harmful materialism.

The characters in this film have a nice home in a quiet neighborhood, recently were chosen for a promotion and a raise, take vacations at the beach, etc..etc..etc..

The wife is in perpetual misery because her dream is to toss all this aside and go slum it up in Paris.
In the process she acts like a miserable person on the edge of a mental breakdown.

Her husband is no angel, but he certainly puts up with more of her whacky unstable behaviour than most would put up with.

The movie tries to hard to demonize the rise of middle class suburban living in America and offer a derivative view of life in the 1950s era.

The facts are not matter what time in history you examine, you will find people who are both happy and others who are miserable.

That is no different today than it was then.

However, having lived in the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, and today ....... I DO believe life in America was better 20-30 years ago.

And while there is no time in human history that is perfect (nothing involving people ever will be) ... I can certainly say living in the 70s and 80s in America was better than what we are experiencing today with the direction this Country is heading.",1258848000,,1990,4.5307262569832405
3165295,4,B0016Q2D66,"Over the past period I have seemingly endlessly retailed the experiences of my young adulthood during the 1960s, the time of the ""generation of `68"". That makes me, obviously, a child of the 1950s, the time period of this very interesting movie, ""Revolutionary Road"" based on a book by the darkly sardonic writer, Richard Yates. I have also seemingly endlessly pointed out my experiences and the effects they had as a result of growing up among the marginally working poor in that `golden age'. I am fond of saying that I didn't know there was any other condition than being poor for a long time. Well, I did find out there was and although in my youth I would still have had a hard time relating to the story line of this film. The `trials and tribulations', then, of an upwardly mobile, prosperous young couple, the Wheelers, Frank and April, with the mandatory two charming children and a nice leafy suburban house in some nice town in Connecticut would have gone over my head. Now though I can a little more readily appreciate the seamy psychologically paralyzing side of that existence.

As graphically portrayed in the film that seamy side (that also provided some of the most powerful scenes in the movie, and best acting moments by both Winslett and DiCaprio), the central driving force of the story), is the emptiness of middle class existence in the 1950s. Cookie-cutter is the word that came to mind as Frank and April try to break the golden bonds that keep them tied to their old life. One of the nice moments cinematically is the sequence involving Frank's routine workday morning ritual catching the train to New York City (along with all the other felt-hatted men, the symbol of success in that period). Another sober moment is when April takes out the rubbish in their deathless suburban tract and realizes that this life is not for her.

But how to break those golden chains? The issues presented here about consumerism, meaningless and vacuous work, the isolated role of women in the nuclear family, the eternal struggle for security in an individualistically-driven society are all issues that got a fuller workout and wider airing in the 1960s (and since). In a sense the `whimsical' Wheelers were too early. They were before their time. However, although times have changed, I will bet serious money that if you go to some Connecticut train station headed to New York City on any Monday morning you will see, two generations removed and without the hats, men and women making that same meaningless trip that old Frank made. Yates was definitely onto something about the nature of modern capitalist social organization. But I will confess something, although I know better now the stresses of that fate, I would not have minded, minded at all, growing up in that little `cottage' the Wheelers called home.

It didn't get the Best Picture nomination it deserved and Kate Winslet got a trophy for her inferior performance in The Reader, but Sam Mendes's brilliant adaptation of Revolutionary Road deserves to be recognized for the way it breathes new life into the cliched subject of American suburbia: with its perfect cast, beautifully stark cinematography, vitriolic screenplay and agonizing conclusion, this is a searing and nearly great film.

3165308,4,B0016Q2D66,"This movie is good, but the book is much better.

I liked Kate Winslet's performance very much; Leonardo diCaprio I still can't take seriously as an actor.

Actors like Leonardo diCaprio, Tom Cruise and a host of others have faces that hardly look like they've experienced much in life.

Contrast their faces with the faces of not just actors in the 1930s and 1940s but also directors.

-- Peter Lorre versus Tom Cruise.

-- Erich Von Stroheim versus Steven Spielberg.

-- John Garfield versus Leonardo diCaprio.

-- Mike Nichols versus John Ford.

This is what's missing from the movie version of ""Revolutionary Road.""  I just can't take Leonardo's LA-lovin' baby-face seriously.

Also, the structure of the movie doesn't do justice to what Richard Yates was trying to get across in the book.  Yates was saying something fundamental about ""the American way of life"" -- whereas the people who made the movie (and you can hear this in the DVD extras) were more concerned with the ""relationship"" between the husband and the wife.

A movie can't ask ""Big Questions"" about a culture by sarting with the personal; it has to start more generally with the socio-economic realities of time.  The questions Yates raised in his 1961 book are shied away from by modern-day, post-9/11 filmmakers.  Thus the irony -- a movie based on a book about cultural conformity afraid to step outside the boundaries of present-day cinematic conformity.

Interestingly enough, Leonardo diCaprio in the DVD featurette talk about how the movie is about how one often is guided by what their parents want them to do, versus what they themselves would like to be.  True enough, but Yates in his book is saying much more than that.  His focus is not simply on specific individual relationships but rather the social, political and economic forces that, ironically, most Americans have been brainwashed into believing don't affect specific individual relationships.

These forces are what history and sociology and economics and politics are all about.  But modern-day Hollywood is, for the most part, scared to death to suggest to an audience that an individual is often NOT in control of their destiny; that the world is more clearly understood not in individual terms but rather in terms of collective social, economic, political and historical forces.

The movie shows these forces but only to a certain extentl for example, the outflux of white-collar workers from the suburbs into  the anomic vastness of Grand Central Station.  But only as a backdrop to Leonardo diCaprio's *personal* heartache.

This focus on the individual as opposed to a focus on the societal forces at work is heard again and again in the voiceover commentary of the screenwriter and the director.  They love the story but only as ""a story.""  There's no attempt to present to the audience a ""system of reasoning,"" a way of thinking about America in the 1950s and, by implication, America today.",1256342400,2,2942,5.004115226337449

Life sucks, then you get married, have kids and it turns to hell, we get it! We don't need two hours of fighting and unhappiness to prove what we already know. Life is challenging and you have to enjoy the good things when you can. In this movie there is no good things to enjoy, only misery and fighting.

 The movie features a nutjob who understand the wives desire to move to Paris France and chuck, all reality and responsibility. The wife in this flick seriously needs prozac or some other mood altering drug. She is unstable and in need of psychiatric help at best. She want to get a secretaries job for a government firm in Paris which makes good money supposedly and allow her husband to be a stay at home bum so he can discover what he wants to do with his life. Mind you, she does not have a job offer, she just knows of these jobs and wants to chuck everything to go there and try to get one. There is no planning or realistic pursuit of this aspiration. Can you say serious loss of reality? When she does not get her way and get to chuck life and move to Paris, she gives herself a home abortion because she is pregnant with a kid neither her or her husband wants and commits suicide. Both the husband and wife have affairs, his is a long time deal with a girl at work, hers is a one time thing(we think, not really sure, they make it seem like this may be something that has happened before?), with next door neighbors husband who says he loves her.

This whole movie is confusing pointless and another Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet flop as far as I am concerned. I hated Titanic! I do not like Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, and have never seen a movie by either of them that I have enjoyed.

Frank hates his job, but apparently gets paid a significant salary, seeing as how they live so comfortably.  The film itself is beautiful, the 50's decor to Kate Winslet looking stunning in her 50's housewife apparell, however, the problem with this movie is the story and the message.  April is miserible in her life, regardless of being so rich in blessings.  As a mom myself, it's hard for me to sympathize with a woman who cant appreciate the joys of marraige and motherhood.  There is no real reason for this couples misery, other than there ungratefulness and there sour attitude.  I guess they think the world owes them something, that they cannot be happy unless they are doing something less than ordinary.  I have a hard time feeling sympathy for people who have it so well, yet find so much to complain about.  This film sends the message that all people who live in middle class suburbia, are married and have kids are empty-headed comformnists who have no uniqueness or individuality.  As if being a man who goes to work everyday to provide for his family is not commendable, and taking care of a lovely home and mothering your own kids is degrading.  Frank and April had so much to be gratefull for, and yet April's constant whining and complaining about how boring her life is led her down a road to destruction.  As the movie progressed I found myself wanting to slap this woman, tell her what an ungrateful selfish person she is.  However, the acting is great.

The movie starts upbeat enough with a romantic scene where Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and April (Kate Winslet) see each other across the room.  They start a conversation about their dreams and a hopeful future.  They get married and become ""the Wheelers.""

The next scene shows Frank embarrassed as April is in a play and it is just awful.  The fights start and continue throughout the movie of this mismatched couple.  April's failure as an actress (minor) and Frank's failure to take the family, quit his job and move to Paris to find out what he really wants to do in life.  The movie focuses on Frank who hates his job in New York City, and has the daily grind of going to work and coming home to a wife and two children in a nice home in suburbia, that is on ""Revolutionary Road.""  This gives a clue to what is coming.

April and Frank both feel the middle class malaise, however, April feels it acutely.  Like a 50's wife, she is willing to submit her desires so her husband can succeed.  On Frank's birthday, April asks him to follow his dream - got to Paris (I never figured out why location made a difference in a goal - she later said it could be ""anywhere"").  April talks Frank into taking their savings, sell their home and quit his job to move the family to Paris.  She will get a high-paying job as a secretary in some governmental office.

Feeling free and not tied to his job, Frank submits a proposal that is unexpectedly welcomed.  He meets with a high ranking member of his company who offers Frank a better position and more money.  Frank decides he rather stay in his home on Revolutionary Road.  April is devastated.  She wants Frank to go to Paris to find out what he really wants in life.

The realtor that sold them the house (Kathy Bates) becomes a friend and introduces them to her grown son who has psychiatric problems.  He has had shock therapy and yet he speaks of the evils of conformity.  He told the Wheelers to go to Paris - break out of the mold - find individualism and the spirit of youth.  This causes rough fighting and brutal words between two beautiful people.

The rest of the movie is drama and fighting.  Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet act well, but the lines did not ring true.  The problems they had were not big ones, they could take a trip to Paris with the kids with all their money and see if that is what they really wanted.

Instead, April and Frank keep fighting and hate grows.  April gets pregnant and Frank does not want her to have an abortion.  She wants out of her shackles and self-aborts the baby and dies.  We are told that Frank adores the other children and takes them to a different house to raise.  It is a sad ending to a disturbing movie.

The movie portrays a young couple who are stuck in a rut and decide at one point to make a major change in their lives and move from Connecticut to Paris. This sounds all well and good, but then various new options and obstacles begin to mount. He's offered a better paying job, and she gets pregnant, and so instead of being able to make a break for a new life the prison of their lives begins to get tighter. It is apparent early on that April is unhappy with her life. On the other hand Frank seems resigned to his vacuous life. April is frustrated with their lives and grows resentful of Frank's complacency. There is a chilling scene, the morning after their big argument, when Frank comes to breakfast. April acts like one of the Stepford wifes, behaving with utmost perfection, like a dutiful wife, as if nothing ever happened the night before. Frank seems bewildered, but relieved, and doesn't seem to think too much about what his wife's chilling transformation could mean.

Sam Mendes (Road to Perdition, American Beauty) beautifully directs this movie, which initially seems trapped in the inertia of its all too idealized depiction of 1950's America, but then Mendes takes us down this disturbing path where everything that is too perfect, sterile and bland is revealed as a kind of prison for this couple, and this facilitates in highlighting the underlining tension between Frank and April.

The reason I give it four stars is for the overall authenticity of the tragic romance between the protagonists.  Several fight scenes pulled out the guts of the infamous and disturbing fights between young lovers when the relation sours, and dramatically depicts the unseemly and needless pain two nominally decent people can inflict on each other.  50s plastic commercialism is not a new subject,
yet the movie did have a new take on the matter as the couple dared to defy convention, but ultimately the movie was about how they ended up conspiring against each other and the simple beauties of a normal life.  DiCaprio's character especially was unveiled to be ultimately cowardly, hypocritical, and fawning to the luxuries and vacuous comforts he purportedly despised.  The movie is unable to end on a conclusive note however, and ultimately indicts both human desire but also convention.  A bit of a debbie downer i'd say.

They're given a script to work with and, in my opinion, they did a fine job.  The Barrymore's couldn't pull it off.  Let's be honest, the characters Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are given to portray are, plainly put, hateful.  I don't recall when was the last time that two protagonists in a ""serious"" film came across as so wholly detestable and generally unlikeable.  More on this later.  But first, the film is structured in such a way that from the word go, the audience's collective heads are pushed under the surface and they will not come up for air for a solid two hours.  In between and with little chance of reprieve, the audience is made to witness the so called tragedy that is Frank and April Wheeler's existence.  You know the kind:  Good home in a beautiful neighborhood, lucrative job, good health, loving children.  Doesn't it just break your heart?  Poor April has to go through life without a stint in Paris on her resume.  Is there any greater heartache in this world than not getting a chance to gallivant through European capitals?  No more catastrophic fate could possibly befall anyone.  Illness, death, madness, abject poverty?  Those are nothing compared to missing out on chugging coffee and smoking cigarettes all the while sitting in a cafe on the Quai de Voltaire dreaming about being the next Sandra Bernhardt.  I don't mean to come across so dismissive but that's the reaction this film engendered in me.  April feels progressively isolated and trapped in a life of conformity and all its dull trappings.  My question:  So what????  I have news for everyone who doesn't already know it.  If you're lucky, that's pretty much the life of almost everyone in this world.  Again, if you're so fortunate that your chronic complaint is that you're dissatisfied and bored and feel that somehow you've been cheated out of an extraordinary life, as opposed to living everyday with stage 4 pancreatic cancer and close enough to the grim reaper that your feel his icy breath on your face or you've just buried your 14 year old child killed by a drunk driver.  At some point of the day, I think to myself, what would my life have been like if I had made other choices?  Every now and again I believe we all feel those pangs of regret for the road not taken.  No doubt, it's perfectly normal.  Frank and April, the latter especially, prefer to wallow in self-pity rather than to take a good hard look at her life and realize that Paris or not, acting career or not, everything else or not, she's pretty darn blessed.  In the end, we're left with two hours of constant fighting, self-destructive behavior (including sexual indiscretions) and for what?  To end up with the most maudlin of endings, one that even Isaac the Blind could have seen coming?  I'm sorry, I have zero to no tolerance for these people and their selfishness and ingratitude, not to mention April's petty complaints.  We never see these characters happy.  There is no downward spiral into the life they now feel trapped in.  It's as if they met, got married and were instantly repelled by one another.  Eternally miserable in a life without escape or worse, meaning.  It's like the Connecticut version of existential nihilism.  Their children are a footnote that seem to appear and disappear with alarming ease.  They're more like shadows on a wall than anything else.  We never see how their lives are affected by their parent's non-stop fighting.  I felt like kicking the living fecal matter out of these characters and telling them to get over it.  Yeah, life can sometimes suck but trust me, the alternative is a hell of a lot worse.  Be thankful and humble and learn to deal with it all.  Sadly it'll end too soon anyway.  Yes, the film has many merits, but they're primarily centered on the production side of things.  The look of the film is beautiful and the performances are uniformly very good.

3165325,4,B0016Q2D66,"I went to see this film the weekend it opened.  Having read the book, and being fan of both Kate & Leo, I was expecting to love it.  I did appreciate it, and was impressed with both actors, but what I was not expecting was to be blown away by a character in this story.  In the book, he was important, but not particulary interesting in his own right.  In the movie, John, the son of the real estate agent, played by Michael Shannon, stole every scene he was in.  John is on a weekend leave with his parents from a mental institution.  He is a key character in that he actually speaks the truth of the tension between Frank (Leo) and April (Kate).  John was a mirror to their illusions--both of their superiority and their disfunctional personalities.
I walked out of the theater thinking of how the film was just a bit off, but couldn't explain why.  It had all the elements of a great film--great sets/costumes, filmed beautifully on actual locations-not sets.  Great actors in Kate and Leo (I was also a Titanic fan so of course the reunion was exciting.  The heart does NOT go on in this one.)  Talented enough director, based on a great story and the script did follow the novel--right to the ending image.  So--what was it?  Was it a bit too structured?  The fights and discussions too rehearsed?  Was it to aware that it better be good?  Not sure--but it is a good film, just not a great one.
What is great, and makes it one to see, is Michael Shannon.  I thought walking out that he was the only one deserving an Oscar.  I was thrilled (and still surprised although agreed) when he was the only actor that received the nod (he lost to Heath Ledger of course).

3165327,3,B0016Q2D66,"Well, if you really feel like depressing yourself, this movie will certainly deliver. It is an interesting movie, but serious flaws are prevalent.

The movie starts with the Kate Winslet character (April) feeling humiliation after an unsuccessful play performance. She quickly has a bitter argument with her husband Leonardo DiCaprio (Frank). We see that their marriage is having trouble at best, and at worst is already dead and waiting for the tragic inevitable end. Whatever people may think of Frank, he has a point when he says: ""It's not my fault that the play was lousy.""

A flaw here is that April and Frank are both unhappy with their lives. And while April looks for an irrational escape, Frank seems more set in reality that they have 2 children as well as responsibilities. True, Frank is not happy at his job. But he's not going to 'jump ship' when he has a wife and 2 children. (One pun on ""The Titanic"" here is inevitable.)

Later, April gets a strange idea to run away to France. What she says may sound good in THEORY. But how can she be sure of getting a job? Frank again carries reason when he says: ""It might make more sense if I were a writer or painter.""

It is worth noting that while the movie doesn't mention it, April may very well be bipolar. The movie tries to keep sympathy balanced between the characters, but it just doesn't work. Towards the latter half, April finds that she is pregnant. And Frank knows that he has to go back to reality and accept a great promotion he has been offered.

Whether you are anti abortion or pro choice, there is an unavoidable sting of reality when Frank says: ""A sane woman doesn't perform an abortion on herself so she can live out some fantasy."" April responds that it is for him. And Frank understandably responds: ""How can it be for me when the mere thought of it makes my stomach sick?!""

Frank desperately tries to save the shambled remains of their marriage, but April only gets more cruel: ""I never loved you. You're just a man who made me laugh at a party."" At this point, we can scarcely blame Frank for his rage here: ""Then why are you living in my house? Why are you my wife?"" Also to his credit, despite his rage, he is able to avoid physically striking her.

Another serious flaw in this movie is that they try to make a cruel and nasty man carry weight. (What he says is not fit to be printed here and would probably not be allowed here.) Charles Dickens often put the voice of reason into eccentrics, but without the profanity and cruelty.

I'm not saying the movie does not have some worthwhile moments. But the story just doesn't work. While it tries to make April heroic, it just does not work. And it seems to try to make Frank look bad for keeping one foot in reality.

I went into it fairly open.  From the opening scene there was something disjointed about the film's flow that I just couldn't get around.  I thought perhaps I just didn't relate to the 1950s dynamic, that perhaps one of the Wheeler couple had some sort of mental imperative that skewed the story for the audience, or some other similar great reveal lurked right around the corner.  But nothing ever jumped out to save this film.  It looked spectacular, the story was interesting though painfully slow moving throughout, the acting was top-notch.  In the end what struck me most was that despite how many wonderful elements made up this film, they did not act in unison.  While Winslet, DiCaprio and their supporting cast were fantastic, they all felt like they were each acting in their own film.  There was no synergy.  That was, in essence, the point of the film, but the feeling that even the cast was fragmented did not seal the story.  In the end it gives good insight into the insidious nature of depression and how despite the way things may appear on the outside, everything has shadows.",1251072000,,1246,4.6438356164383565

I believe there were patterns for happy living that people were supposed to follow back then, and that the majority of them found happiness despite this - those would be the interesting stories. These people are just unhappy and seem to hate each other and can think of no better or more creative way to live than to carry out the hellishness they've created. Hoorah.

3165343,2,B0016Q2D66,"""Revolutionary Road"" is a technically well made film with two very appealing actors at the heart of its story, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet (well, maybe one appealing actor since I've never liked DiCaprio that much but I know a lot of other people like him so I'll concede the point).

The problem is that the story is just so bleak and depressing.  I know that some people like movies that depict ""real life"" in all its grim, often boring detail, but I tend to go to the movies because I want to escape from all of that.  There are so many marriages going up in flames in real life, who wants to see two actors portray a fictional one failing?

Don't get me wrong.  Sometimes, Hollywood's depiction of real life can be entertaining and rewarding.  Two movies come to my mind in this category.  The first is ""Ordinary People"" and the second is ""Little Children.""  ""Ordinary People"" showed an all-American family coming apart after the death of one child and the attempted suicide of the other.  ""Little Children"" (with Kate Winslet playing a vastly more sympathetic character in it) explored the disintegration of not one but two marriages.

I think the reason why I liked those films was because of two things.  One was the fact that amidst the sadness, there was some life, brightness, and laughter.  The second was that both of those movies ended on a somewhat hopeful note.  ""Revolutionary Road"" ends with the tragic death of Winslet's character, so watching it was a profound downer.

I didn't go see the movie when it was in the theaters for these reasons.  The only reason why I'm watching it now is because I love Kate Winslet and wanted to see the way he brought her character to life.  She does so with her trademark expertise, but April is a pretty hard person to like.  As for DiCaprio, his ""Frank"" comes across as pretty unlikable too, given the fact that he almost hits his wife during an argument and engages in a sleazy affair with a secretary in his office.

A couple of other thoughts.  Kate Winslet looks like a million dollars in the movie, but she doesn't come across as plausible as an acting student in her early twenties when Frank and April first meet.  As for DiCaprio, it's sort of strange looking at him since he still looks like a teenager, albeit with some lines on his forehead.

Another thing that strikes me as odd is that even though the Wheelers have two young children, they're pretty much off-stage for most of the movie.  How realistic is that?

Overall, the movie is just bleak and since the world has moved on and changed profoundly since the 1950s, it's difficult to see the point.",1250553600,4,2924,5.092436974789916

3165346,4,B0016Q2D66,"Simply put, Revolutionary Road is a hard film to watch.

Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet turn in fantastic performances as April and Frank Wheeler, the ""perfect"" couple on the block.  They have it all: the perfect house, the perfect family, the perfect 1950's lives.  At least, that's how it appears to outsiders.

April, we see in the very beginning of the film, is trying to pursue her dream of becoming an actress.  The play she stars in, however, ends up a failure.  We see the first of many huge fights that she and Frank will have.  April eventually succumbs to the role of Frank's housewife, spending her days in beautiful clothes while she keeps house and watches over their children, who are rarely around.

Frank realizes on his birthday that he is miserable in his current job.  He has ended up in the one position he never wanted to be in--just like his father.  He notices a pretty new girl at the office and takes her out to lunch with bad intent, which is fulfilled later on that day.  While this is going on, April was going through some old photographs and happened upon a snapshot of a younger Frank in Paris, France and remembered a talk they had when Frank mentioned how happy he was then.

Frank comes home that night, wearing his guilt all over his face when April meets him at the door, dressed nicely and acting warm.  He follows her into the kitchen where she and the kids have a birthday cake waiting for him and he makes no effort to hide the pain in his face.  April approaches him later that night with her new plan: they can move to Paris and start all over again.  She offers to look for a job and Frank can stay home and decide what he truly wants to do.  It's perfect!

Except, it's not perfect.  After a short period of bliss, April ends up pregnant and Frank is offered a high-paying promotion to stay at his job.  This wouldn't be so hard to work around if April wasn't slowly realizing that she can't stand Frank anymore.  This is evident when she admits that she never wanted his children in the first place and when he confesses his affair to her, she doesn't care in the least.

Ironically, the only person who saw through their facade the entire time was mathematician John Givings, (Michael Shannon), the son of the Wheelers' realtor, Helen Givings, (Kathy Bates), who they agreed to spend some time with since John has been recently released from a mental hospital and didn't really have any friends.  John cuts right to the core of their problems and lays it all out on the table for them, almost resulting in Frank decking him in front of everyone.

April becomes more and more depressed and miserable as the movie goes on.  She is trapped with this man that she can no longer tolerate, she is stuck in this house in Connecticut and she is pregnant with another child she does not want.  The audience can predict what is going to happen as the film progresses but it does not make the ending any easier to watch.  There is no emotional let-up in this film.  It grabs you by the collar and forces your eyes open, making you take it all in.

All in all, this was a very powerful film and an excellent drama.  You can definitely see how DiCaprio has finely honed his craft over the years.  He looks older but not burned out, only more experienced.  The excited child in him is gone and has been replaced by a mature man.  The expressions on his face are truly heartbreaking and a sign of incredible acting prowess.  You truly believe that he really does love April and can't understand why it's not reciprocated.

Winslet is incredible as well.  You can relate to the position she is in and you can even understand how she resolves her dilemma.  She is a strong woman who is gradually beaten down into a weaker and weaker woman by the environment around her.  What do you do when there's nothing you can do?  She helps us understand exactly where she's coming from.",1249862400,,3910,4.46262341325811
3165347,3,B0016Q2D66,"""Revolutionary Road"" is a serious downer, with one of the most depressing criticisms of suburbia ever seen in a film.

However, we cannot blame Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They do a fantastic job as Frank and April Wheeler, raising the drama to the extreme. One will definitely wonder how on Earth the couple in the film stuck together for so many years.

They play a couple living in Connecticut in a suburban home in the 1950s. Frank works at a mind-numbing cubicle, while April cares for the kids at home. From the start, Frank clearly hates his job and the suburbs.

But when Frank comes home, April gives him the wonderful idea to move his family to Paris. His neighbors and his co-workers are not as thrilled, however. They find every  opportunity to convince him to stay at their home on Revolutionary Road.

At first glance, this appears to be a realistic version of ""The Truman Show,"" minus all the high security gizmos. But ""Revolutionary Road"" takes a turn to the dark side as their family matters grow from bad, to worse, to almost unbearable.

It's not as if the characters are completely off-the-hook and emotional. Kate Winslet plays her part masterfully as a mother who loathes Frank's overdependency on her. And DiCaprio is just as magnificent as an strict, two-timing husband lacking some moral values.

No, it's just that the subject matter is too excessively dark. Whereas ""American Beauty"" has eloquent, poetic dialogue, ""Revolutionary Road"" plays out like an evil suburban soap opera. The high-strung tension in the film gets overwhelming near the end. In spite of the stylish direction by Sam Mendes, the gritty script will make people wonder how the hell this couple could ever get along in real life.

""Revolutionary Road"" is still a great film, with classy 50s tunes and snappy outfits. But it might be a tad too dark, even for DiCaprio fans.",1249689600,2,1876,4.840625

3165349,2,B0016Q2D66,"Instead of blaming Hollywood for their self-congratulatory tales of suburban angst, why not blame a gullible public? For it's the public that laps these specious and false tales up. Why was 'The Graduate' such a success? Because it gave the average person the right to feel that 'I'm better than you'. It's easy to sneer at a Mrs. Robinson, an adult woman who manipulates the emotions of Dustin Hoffman's 'innocent' college student, Benjamin. She's willing to ruin not only his life but that of her daughter's. Her narcissism knows no bounds. In a nutshell, she's a character who's easy to hate. Hollywood has the formula down pat: give us an innocent rebel who 'doesn't fit in' and have him/her pitted against the 'monster'--the hissing mustachioed villain of 19th century melodrama has evolved into the 'conformist' post-war suburbanite.

In Revolutionary Road there is nary a laugh to be heard throughout the entire 118 minutes of the film. No one seems to like themselves at all. At the film's beginning, the suburbanites' community theater production is a complete failure. And the worst performance in the play is given by our protagonist, Kate Winslett's April Wheeler. Heaven forbid people can have fun performing in a community theater production or even laugh at themselves if the production is a little off. No, the point is made from the outset that our community of post-war suburbanites is one of 'hopelessness' and 'emptiness'. This is the profound 'epiphany' that the makers of Revolutionary Road want us to experience and they are going to reveal these 'profound insights' to us. But the truth is, there is no such thing as suburban 'angst'--back then and now the vast majority of people have egos--in short, they like themselves!

Those who have written negative things about Revolutionary Road seem to agree that there is little character development when it comes to April Wheeler. When Helen Givings (Kathy Bates) tells April that she always felt she was someone 'special', the camera comes in close and we see the blank expression on her face. April is not to be blamed for her depression--society has made her into what she is. It's a trite idea that people are not responsible for their own lives but that's what Revolutionary Road serves up here. April is a Bohemian, a free spirit whose main goal is to move to Paris. For half the movie, her plan of liberation is about the only thing we find out about her. Certainly we find out nothing about her personality vis--vis her children--they are barely seen in this film and can be best thought of as a set of props in this overblown passion play.

Additional 'props' can be found in the characters of the Wheelers' neighbors, Shep and Millie Campbell. When April and Frank tell them of their plans to move to Paris, they later deride them in the comfort of their own bedroom as ""immature"". The film's scenarists wish us to identify them as being arrogant and part of the overall suburban 'emptiness'. Shep loses further points when he beds April just before her final breakdown.

One wonders why Frank is so easily convinced by April to chuck his house and job and run off to Paris with her and the kids. After all, he screams at her for her illusions of becoming a great actress in the opening scene. But somehow she appeals to his earlier idealistic desires to be free and independent before the kids came along. In the blink of an eye, the empty and uncaring suburbanite who has no compunctions about bedding the new pretty office worker suddenly is transformed into a caring, self-actualized mensch who will go along with his wife's bold plan to go where no other suburban couple has gone before.

Don't despair, Frank returns to his vile ways quite soon enough. With a job promotion hanging over his head and the news that April is pregnant, he decides to 'sell out'. Aha, we've finally found out who the antagonist is in this film! Fortunately there is one bright note in Revolutionary Road and that is Michael Shannon's electroshock victim, John Givings. John is basically an ally of April since they both don't fit into society and are labeled as deviant (note that at one point, Frank recommends that April see a shrink!). Before Frank 'sells out', he and April have a nice 'heart-to-heart' talk with John in the woods who echoes the film's theme: people in suburbia might 'get' emptiness but April and (pre-sell-out) Frank 'feel' hopelessness. The non-conformist blesses the free-spirit couple for their 'bravery'. But once Frank takes the new job and decides not to go to Paris, he is the recipient of John's full wrath. A real person would have parried John's blows with perhaps a sense of humor, but since Frank is merely a stand-in for all the ills of suburbia (and hence American society), he comes off as arrogant, defensive and with a severe anger management problem.

The only truly enjoyable moment in Revolutionary Road is when John turns on April for a millisecond. After berating Frank, he whispers in HER ear and tells her in effect that maybe she's no great shakes either! The suggestion that maybe April is not an angel is short-lived. Before you know it, April has done herself in by means of a self-induced abortion. Our beloved bohemian is now enshrined as sacrificial lamb.

Ironically, Revolutionary Road is well-acted and directed. What's more the art design of the film, with its attention to period detail, is a work to behold. The score, while repetitious, is also haunting. But somehow the histrionics of the principal characters do not impress since people are not like that in real life. Stories about people living 'lives of quiet desperation' is not only a myth but 'old hat'. The 'Road' is more empty than the mythic society it creates and attempts to tear down.",1249344000,,5775,4.833164812942366

This could've been just another sad soap opera, but what sets it aside is the superlative acting of Winslet and di Caprio, and excellent support from Michael Shannon, Kathy Bates & Dylan Baker. I will not blab away the plot, as others did, but paying attention to the characters can only make you marvel in the talent displayed.

Why?  Because their privileged lives aren't privileged enough.  They don't just want it all, they want it all and fame too.  Without doing anything interesting to earn it, with no hobbies or passions, or real skills,  they somehow feel like if they just relocate to a magical Paris, they'll become famous -- for what, they don't know.  But they know they deserve that too, and they can't be happy with out it.

A more spoiled, stupid set of people, I could not imagine. Had they moved to Paris, they would have soon discovered that changing locations wouldn't change them -- they'd soon be as bored and self destructive in Paris, and probaby a lot poorer and less privileged in Paris, and once the novelty of the location wore off they'd be even more unhappy.

I watched a little of the commentary and they talked about the lives of quiet desperation, how this was a tragic love story, and I just had to laugh -- it was the only laugh in the movie.  The tragedy is not that these characters were trapped in suburbia -- the tragedy is that they never seemed to understand that life is largely the moments in between the big events in our lives, not the big events themselves. The tragedy is not that these people missed out on their big chance in life to grab more.  The tragedy is that they couldn't make a life with all they had.  And that neither the characters, the actors, or the director had a clue, even after making this ridiculous exercise in self indulgence.

This movie might appeal to immature adolescents who are convinced they are owed the universe for no effort on their part and will cry waiting for the universe to deliver. Adults will have very little patience with the theme.",1248825600,20,2019,4.510989010989011

3165355,4,B0016Q2D66,"Revolutionary Road is a depiction of the pointless, empty lives that seemingly successful Americans were leading in the 1950's. Today, not much has changed, and there's never a bad time to perk up and pay attention. Based upon an acclaimed book written over thirty years ago, Revolutionary Road is a study in relationships, character, and existence, most of which are illusions cobbled together by disappointments and a little bit of genuine joy. That joy keeps us going, even though we're bitter, wounded, uncertain, and keeping at bay as best we can alienation, anomie, and moral unwinding.  I'm not sure there is any filmmaker today that puts on a better show about these ideas.  Together with American Beauty, Revolutionary Road is a sure-handed dissection of all the things that make the cozy upper-middle class insufferable and, ultimately, not redeemable. We're playing house as a wonderful pass-time to avoid truly living -- so much so, that really experiencing our lives seems more and more like some wishful daydream.

There is no joyful or redemptive ending. In comparison, American Beauty is a sweet Jolly Rancher of optimism -- which in many ways it is. Nor is it perfect. In trying to add subtlety and complexity to the characters, some clarity was lost -- but, I don't necessarily fault Mendes for that.  One thing that's for certain is that nothing is clear about life. Like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Revolutionary Road gets into the mechanics of who we are alone and in relationships -- why we can't live with them, and can't, seemingly, live without them. And Kate Winslet, the common thread in both of those films, shines as a bright woman just looking for some peace of mind and a little stretch of happiness.

Wonderful and intelligent, if a little studio-esque, Revolutionary Road is a smart film well worth seeing.",1248307200,,1850,4.97411003236246

3165363,3,B0016Q2D66,"""Revolutionary Road,"" based on the 1961 novel by Richard Yates, juxtaposes appearances and contentment with the hidden, underlying unhappiness that threatens to dismantle lives.  This is a somber, dark film about a 1950's suburban couple, April and Frank Wheeler (Kate Winslet, Leonardo Di Caprio), who are ill at ease and dissatisfied with their so-called perfect life.  Frank hates the job he commutes to five days a week.  April finds her days long and empty.  Both feel life is passing them by too quickly and long for something more.

They decide relocating to Paris is just the thing to energize them both.  April will get a high-paying job as a government agency secretary while Frank takes time to think about what he'd like to do.  Their savings will see them through several months.  Initially elated by their decision to uproot themselves and their two children to start a new life overseas, they meet with circumstances that create serious obstacles.

The Wheelers are unhappy not so much with each other but with the feeling that their suburban life has not been the satisfying goal they expected it to be.  Winslet and Di Caprio have a number of heavy-duty verbal fights that ring true, thanks to Sam Mendes' on-the-money direction.  April is a woman trapped in a life of her own making -- a life that has let her down.  It's not as easy as chalking it up to a marriage gone sour.  She still loves Frank, and that is part of her tragedy.  She wants more for both of them, and is desperate for a way out.

Michael Shannon co-stars as the son of a real estate agent (Kathy Bates) who has recently been released from a mental institution.  His character is the one person who sees things more ""normal"" people -- even the Wheelers -- are blind to.  Mr. Shannon was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this role.

Bonus extras include commentary by director Sam Mendes, a making-of featurette, and deleted scenes.  The Blu-ray edition contains the biographical profile, ""Richard Yates: The Wages of Truth.""",1247270400,,2027,4.789625360230548
3165364,1,B0016Q2D66,"Revolutionary Road hinted at the social revolution that has swept away any vestige of the ""horribly oppressive 50s."" But it struck me as a simple screed meant to indoctrinate the thoughtless into the joys of modern selfishness.

My wife and I thought we'd enjoy this movie as it dealt with questions many of us face in the suburban life style epitomized by the 50s. But soon we saw this as something else. A thinly veiled attack against much what we hold dear. Things like marriage, friends, family, children and our attempt at relationship with our creator. Let's take them one at time;

Marriage. There are enough reviews posted to give a good overview of the movie. It depicts a marriage as the representation of the oppressive 50s model, in which the heroine is trapped. Trapped in her modern, convenient home with her well adjusted children and dutiful husband. How horrible! And she can't even work! ""But if we can just move to Paris and there I (big I) can support the family then all will be well."" Please...

Friends. April and Frank's friends are depicted universally as idiots. I wonder why the hang around with them? His work partners are dull, bored, one-dimensional losers. Their neighbors are morons. The only one with a lick of sense is a recently released lunatic. Is this how the author sees his life I wonder?

Family. No hint of family outside the nuclear here. April and Frank love each other when they are not having sex with their neighbors. April loves her born children but the unborn one? Strictly viewed as an impediment to her dream. I mean strictly! There is not a hint of anything other than a vain MAN who thinks abortion impolite to form any sort of moral argument against this act. However, in the end we see April lose her life due to the ugly and ignorant conventions of the day against abortion. Such melodrama!

Children. One bright spot in the movie are their two born children who, when around, are depicted well. Problem is there is almost always some device to remove them from the scene so the couple can go on in their orgy of selfishness.

The Creator. Like most movies there is no hint of God nor any question of God's existence or non  existence. The God-Factor is completely removed making this a typically paper thin, one dimensional presentation. I take that back, there is one background sound track of ""Going to the chapel."" No realization in the film however, nor any attempt, which I believe virtually anyone would make when faced with the immense pressures the couple is under, to seek some spiritual help. I guess that only in Hollywood do you find ""atheists in the foxholes.""

Overall this movie was beyond disappointing. It left me angry and frustrated. I do not like to be indoctrinated by Hollywood. I do not like to be told how horrible and oppressive life was before liberals took over. I don't believe it. I was there.",1247270400,7,2880,4.677865612648222

I don't hesitate to say that this is his best film since American Beauty and is almost the film's counterpart. While American Beauty portrayed the darkly comical underbelly of suburbia, Revolutionary Road shows the tragic, claustrophobic grip of it.

The setting is Eisenhower-era Connecticut, which is where Frank (DiCaprio) and April Wheeler (Winslet) live in a nice suburban home on Revolutionary Road. Having given up on their aspirations to raise their children, Frank works at Knox Business Machines (a job he hates) while April fills her position as housewife. Feeling smothered by the suburban lifestyle they're trapped in, April proposes that the family move to Paris. She wants to get away, but she also wants to give Frank a chance to find his passion. While their friends find the plan absurd, the Wheeler's are steadfast in their determination. But, as things begin to change, the Wheeler's see their dreams start to crumble right along with their marriage.

Don't expect too many surprises, I warn you. The film has an ominous musical score, reminiscent of American Beauty (fitting, as the same composer Thomas Newman scored both films) that clearly foreshadows things aren't going to play out in the happiest way. On the subject of music however, there is perfectly placed '50s era music scattered throughout the movie that marvelously puts us in this timeframe. The set direction (by Kristi Zea) and the costume design (by Albert Wolsky) are both perfect in the film. The beautiful recreation of 1950's suburbia perfectly contrasts the empty attitude of the character's.

The acting is, of course, the film's selling point. Winslet is a reliable actress that likely would've won her 2008-Oscar for this film had she not made&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Reader/dp/B001PPLJIQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Reader</a>. Not any actress could capture feelings of emptiness and claustrophobia in this performance, but Winslet does it flawlessly. A true actress Winslet is.

DiCaprio is one of the most successful actor's in Hollywood, but he's not without his detractors. His performance as Frank is a powerhouse of pent-up frustration and emotion. I think this is one of his best and certainly one of his most powerful performances. The two performances together are so vividly realized, you'll forget this is the ""Jack & Rose reunion."" They completely outshine those performances.

With all the star-power this film has backing it, the Academy only acknowledged one performance in this film. The character is John, the adult son of the Wheeler's neighbors who has only recently been allowed to leave the psychiatric hospital he's been staying at. The actor is Michael Shannon, who has only two scenes and a small amount of screen time. Shannon impressed me in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bug-Special-Edition/dp/B000T5O48K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bug (Special Edition)</a>, but I don't think he has previously been given a role that allowed him to really showcase his talent. As John, he makes quite an impression as the only person able to see right through the Wheeler's facade. He has the most powerful dialouge in the film and he is so stand-out, it's easy to see why the Academy singled him out among these other, well-known actors.

Revolutionary Road goes deep into the inner workings of suburbia, a crumbling marriage, and the unhappiness of these people. It doesn't explore these themes subtly, but gives the audience a very clear view into them. It's based on a 48-year-old novel by Richard Yates and was brought to the screen all these years later because it's still a very relevant story. Look no further for proof than the recent, overpublicized Jon & Kate debacle. This film is not a subtle meditation, it's a realistic exploration.

This is a beautiful, heartwrenching film...Definitely among the best films of 2008. It's powerful, effusive, and impressive considering the subject matter has the makings of a soap-opera and instead is a real human drama. While not a happy movie by any stretch of the imagination. I highly recommend this film.

3165366,2,B0016Q2D66,"Here's a movie that was hyped up quite a bit because it reunited the ""Titanic"" duo of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.  Who would have thought the reunion would have produced such a dud?

Essentially, this movie is like experiencing a protracted episode of cable tv's ""Mad Men"".  As a period piece, it simply doesn't work. It lacks any semblance of authenticity.

As others have pointed out in their reviews, DiCaprio struggles in adult roles because of his boyish appearance.  Any actor who could grow a convincing four o'clock shadow probably would have been better in the role.

The director seems to try to balance the importance of both DiCaprio's and Winslet's roles, but clearly the story should be more weighted towards Winslet.  When you break it down, this is not so much a story about a shipwrecked marriage as it is a portrait of a woman's unhappiness.

It's a story similar to Sylvia Plath's ""Bell Jar"", about a woman with a creative temperament who is stifled in a marriage, her personality ultimately spiraling towards madness.

But despite Winslet delivering what I would call a ""solid but not overly spectacular"" performance, the problem is that the movie is dull.  Neither character inspires much sympathy.

Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick were better in ""The Days of Wine and Roses"", as were Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" ""American Beauty"" is a far superior movie to this, and so probably is ""The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit"".

Much has been made of Kate Winslet's bravado as an actress. She had a very good year in 2008, and her role in ""The Reader"" was deservedly praised.  Kate's appearance seems to have taken on a hard cast, lately. I wish her more good roles, but I hope that the roles are not exclusively ""unhappy women"", and that they are more fully realized than this rather one-dimensional role in ""Revolutionary Road"".",1247097600,7,1890,4.832298136645963
3165367,5,B0016Q2D66,"""If my work has a theme, I suspect it is a simple one: that most human beings are inescapably alone, and therein lies their tragedy."" - Richard Yates on his novel, ""Revolutionary Road""

The above quote gives one a pretty good idea that ""Revolutionary Road"" is not a simplistic or feel-good film, rather a film that dares to imply that society is nave, misled, too quick to conform, and that people lack the courage to do what truly makes them happy because they are too concerned with comfort and safety.  It does this through the ""everyday"" couple, Frank and April Wheeler, and how it does so may touch a nerve or two in those who have ignored their hearts' desires or their discontent for the sake of sufficiency.

From the beginning, it is clear that the Wheelers' marriage is anything but happy.  They are shown meeting at a party for the first time, locking eyes across the room and then the movie swiftly centers on their present relationship in 1955, the two of them married with children and consumed by disillusionment.  April (Winslet) and Frank (DiCaprio) appear to be living the American dream, their comfortable lifestyle in suburban Connecticut possessing everything but the white picket fence.  Bubbling beneath the surface is Frank's dissatisfaction with his compliance to conformity, his identity lost in a job he could care less about in the effort to support his family.  April is equally dissatisfied with her role as a housewife, wanting something more exciting and meaningful.  The disappointment in their stations in life peaks when Frank has an affair with a secretary at his office the day after a nasty argument with April, only to be surprised that evening by his apologetic wife dressed in her best holding a cake.  She further stuns him with a proposal to move to Paris and Frank is dismissive of the idea at first, viewing it as impractical.  When April appeals to his ego by telling him that she will work to support the family while he spends time finding his true vocation, he warms to the idea and the move breathes optimism and romance back into their marriage.

Enthusiastic, the Wheelers begin telling their friends about their plan and are met with criticism.  Frank begins to cave from peer pressure and when he is offered a promotion at work, their plans growing shaky.  The clincher is April's unexpected pregnancy, an event that completely rules out Paris for Frank and has him taking the job offered to him.  Crushed by Frank's decision to keep them in the wearisome lifestyle that has made them so unhappy in the first place, April becomes cold and despondent and what hope their marriage had of repairing itself makes a quick and climactic crumble.

Great dramas ride high on illuminative dialogue and the execution of its main actors and both elements are in top form here - you'll rarely glimpse perfection like this, no matter how many films you watch in your lifetime.  There are movies I have watched and enjoyed but had little to say about them; ""Revolutionary Road"" differs in that I can't say enough.

Nearly everyone involved in this project was highly passionate about the material - most of them had read Yates's 1962 novel and commented on how well it was written, that it was among their favorite novels of all time.  Justin Haythe is among those people and his screenplay is outstanding - I found myself wanting to write down several lines I heard, so many of them quotable that I couldn't possibly put them all in this review (truthfully, I would love to have a copy of the entire screenplay).  Haythe borrowed heavily from the novel's own language as well as producing some wonderful material of his own, and I'm a little surprised that it didn't even get an Oscar nod (""Slumdog Millionaire"" won the Best Adapted category.  Again, WHY?).  The exchanges between April and Frank teeter back and forth from sympathetic and understanding to downright spiteful - some of their remarks towards one another are so cutting at times that the viewer feels stung by them just standing on the outside listening in.

In fact, I'm surprised that it didn't get more than three nominations total in 2008, among them Art Direction (courtesy of Kristi Zea and Debra Schutt, who brought the 1950's alive like never before - it's all in the little details) and Costume Design (I loved the majority of Winslet's wardrobe - simplistic and chic).  Perhaps the most surprising was an out-of-the-blue nomination for little-known actor Michael Shannon for his scene-stealing supporting turn as John Givings, a man who from the beginning speaks cold hard truths everyone knows but no one wants to hear.

Master cinematographer Roger Deakins is onboard this project and his ingenuity knows no bounds.  Sam Mendes, a director who loves to play with light and shadow, has a cooperation with Deakins that produces iconic imagery with stark contrast both visual and metaphorical.  For the actors, there is no soft lens - every wrinkle, crag, scar and physical imperfection is there for the world to see, making their characters more relative and real to their audience.  For the sets, sunlight brightens a cheery and conservatively decorated living room, clashing with the cluttered darkness of the Wheeler's marriage, giving the impression that all is not how it appears.  Shooting within the house, though significantly larger than houses in the 50's typically were, was still a challenge - Deakins squeezed himself into the confined rooms, neck and neck with the actors, creating a physical and psychological claustrophobia that radiates into the story and the performances.

DiCaprio and Winslet tear the house down as Frank and April Wheeler, their on-screen dynamic trumping that of their first collaboration in 1997's ""Titanic"" (of course, this film is of a completely different ilk and highly unromantic). Of their fight scenes, DiCaprio was quoted as saying, ""So much of what happens between Frank and April in this film is what's left unsaid. I actually found it a real joy to do those fight scenes because finally, these people were letting each other have it.""  Because he and Winslet are such great friends in real life, their portrayal of a husband and wife is highly believable and Winslet even had to take a moment to compose herself during one of their tougher scenes because DiCaprio had never been that angry and physically violent towards her before.  Though she won an Academy Award for her role in ""The Reader"" the same year, THIS is the better performance of the two by leaps and bounds.

While the actors are incredible, it is their characters that one becomes so frustrated with.  Though April and Frank struggle with the restrictions of their simplistic lifestyle, it is a prison of their own making and it gets hard for one to sympathize with them after a time, particularly because of their inability to communicate in a meaningful way and to come to a compromise of which both of them can be happy.  Frank is not a risk-taker and won't squeeze out of his societal niche for the sake of leisure, while April is too impractical in her desire to change things; one will come to wonder about her state of mind not only because of her manipulation but her extreme swings between highs and lows (bipolar) throughout the film.  Knowing how difficult they were finding it to see eye to eye after a time and that their feelings for each other had diminished to a certain degree, I don't know why they felt the need to stay together.  Divorce was certainly an option for them instead of what April chooses to do later on.

Bottom line: A dark and emotional journey through a dysfunctional marriage and how the choices we make in life can inspire or delude us, ""Revolutionary Road"" captures that truth of which so many of us choose to avert our eyes.  It is a film that will make a deep impact with those who thought - or knew better than - to trust our ideals.",1247011200,8,7908,4.81314623338257

Even now, the resulting 2008 film, as meticulously directed by Sam Mendes, feels so internally driven that the story may be better suited for the stage or even TV.

The time is 1955 well before professional counseling and divorce were viable options. The one attribute that the couple shares is the disillusionment each experiences with their daily lives, a far cry from the worldly aspirations they had when they first met at a Manhattan cocktail party.

Initially a frustrated actress, April is a creative person who is suffocating from her suburban domestic duties, while Frank is an even more aimless dreamer who hates his sales job at an IBM-like company. The story turns on April's sudden idea to move the family to Paris, where she plans to work as a government agency secretary while Frank figures out what he wants to do. He tentatively agrees, but it is her mounting desperation to hold onto her dream of living a bohemian life abroad that points to their emotional unraveling. Extramarital affairs prove to be the least of their problems, as each becomes entrenched in a deepening inability to empathize with or support one another. Communication between them turns into mutual provocations of emotional abuse. Mendes returns to familiar territory here, as there are vestiges of his debut film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Beauty/dp/B00003CWL6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Beauty</a>, in the often uncomfortable-to-watch marital discord he etches here. However, the tone is even more desultory this time with nary a trace of black humor to provide a counterbalance. All the period touches feel authentic with Roger Deakins' cinematography and Kristi Zea's production design contributing to an evocative feel that doesn't feel overly contrived. Thomas Newman's haunting score is another asset that enhances the dramatic elements.

This is the type of movie that provides a showcase for its principal actors. As April, Kate Winslet (Mendes' wife) manages to make a fundamentally selfish character sympathetic by throwing herself fearlessly and honestly into the role.

He comes to life during the many confrontation scenes, but he can't match Winslet's affinity with the heavy material. The supporting cast is solid - Kathy Bates (another&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Titanic/dp/B000VS6R26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Titanic</a>&nbsp;veteran) as unctuous real estate agent Helen Givings, Kathryn Hahn as the Wheelers' chipper neighbor Milly, David Harbour as her deceptively complacent husband Shep, Zoe Kazan as Frank's gullible secretary, and in just two sharply rendered scenes, Michael Shannon as Helen's mentally ill son and a powerfully uncomfortable harbinger for the tragedy to follow. The 2009 DVD has a standard set of extras - a mostly interesting audio commentary track from Mendes and Haythe, five deleted scenes, and principal cast and crew members contributing to an adequate half-hour making-of featurette, ""Lives of Quiet Desperation: The Making of Revolutionary Road"".",1246838400,3,4662,6.753743760399335
3165370,3,B0016Q2D66,"This movie doesn't work. It's an intellectualized, staged conception of ""quiet desperation."" It doesn't look or feel like real desperation. I can't imagine real people arguing this way or shifting moods this way. It's a professorial view of life that feels as if it had been written from an ivory tower, while its author looked down at an expanse of suburbia from an academic distance. All the intriguing details are invisible; only the broad patches of pattern are apparent.

So it sees only clich. It sees the clich that the 1950's were unbearably conformist, with husbands swimming upstream every morning to work like doomed salmon, while wives stayed home in crisp regiments of starched aprons. But if you had looked close and lived through the 50's, you would have found a very different, motley, messy reality.

There is also the clich of the real estate woman's son. Michael Shannon cast in this role does a very good job as the disturbed, truth-telling iconoclast. But again, his character plays into the trite, almost sitcom presumption that people who are or who have been in insane asylums can be counted on to deliver rude insights and raw wisdom.

There's not necessarily meant to be a clear-cut moral to this movie. However, the movie's sympathies are clearly with making a break from the life dealt to you. Director Mendes and the author of the book on which this movie is based both lean in favor of grabbing any chance to climb out of what, to them, is the inevitable rut of the workaday world. The message is that if you don't have the courage and tenacity to launch off somewhere - you'll be trapped and tragic.

However, that is the biggest clich of all. It overlooks the real detail of beauty inherent in the scene, in favor of the preconceived disdain of 1950's suburbia. If the Wheelers could have opened their eyes, they might have realized they had a gleaming interior, and a view of lovely dappled woods outside, in both a literal and a metaphoric sense. They might have seen that John's co-workers were affable, available beings, probably with rich back-stories of their own. They might have seen that they had a varied network of intelligent, potentially heartfelt people on their very doorstep.

I gave this movie three stars instead of something lower because the actors do make a good attempt to elevate their characters to some social importance. However, in the end, I couldn't care about these people, because they would have been incapable of caring about me. They wouldn't even have been able to find me interesting - unless they came upon me somewhere else, in some exotic, glamorous place - such as Paris.",1246752000,9,2643,4.812775330396476
3165371,5,B0016Q2D66,"Wow....that's what I was left saying after I watched the final credits roll up the screen at the end of this movie. Between Kate Winslet acting like a certified, yet somehow sane, nut and Leonard DiCaprio seamlessly playing the helpless husband racked with his own guilt, I felt totally satisfied about spending my well earned[..] on this movie, twice (yes, twice).
Now I must admit I think I've seen, like, one Kate Winslet movie ever before this, and I just recently started getting on the DiCaprio bandwagon after watching both The Departed and Blood Diamond in the same year (after that I was hooked on DiCaprio). But after watching Revolutionary Road, I was all aboard team Winslet. She was so captivating in this role, so emotional and raw and riveting all at once. This is one of those movies that you just have to see for yourself and derive your own meaning behind it. It just touched on so many different issues like love, the sanctity of marriage, forgiveness, rage, entrapment, loneliness and helplessness.
A young married couple try to live the normal suburban life like so many of their friends have and find out that, with that, comes its challenges, its heartbreak and its own imprisonment and solitude.

3165372,2,B0016Q2D66,"So the deal is that this is directed by Winslet's husband, Sam Mendes, famous for foisting American Beauty on us, and adapted from a novel set in 1955, but released in 1961, and supposedly so depressing it couldn't be adapted until NOW! So are you ready, party peoples?

We open with a short snippet at a NYC party where April, that's Kate, and Frank, that's Leo, meet and chat. Then we cut to April in a local production in which she is apparently awful. Afterward they have a horrible fight on the way home, and we see that when she's upset, April doesn't want to talk, and Frank NEEDS to talk. This is, however, not five minutes into the film. I sort of thought we would see their happy courtship before they moved to the suburbs and began to hate their lives, but no! Which can give you a momentary panic attack thinking ""Oh GOD, it's going to be two hours of straight misery, not a slow slide into misery."" And it kind of is and isn't.

So for the next few minutes we're jumping back and forth between their current lives and how they got here. We see a tiny bit more of the party, in which April tells Frank that he is the most interesting person she's ever met. We see them looking that the house in Connecticut that they end up buying. We see him taking the train to work in Manhattan, his suit beautifully photographed to look wonderful with the sea of guys in similar suits streaming into Grand Central. Meanwhile, April stays at home, raising the magical kids who appear and disappear at will. And over time they get more and more unhappy with their lives, feeling stilted and stifled.

April gets the idea to move to Paris. She says she'll work as a secretary and support the whole family, and Frank can be free to find himself, and discover what it is he wants to do. She says that ""our whole existence here is based on the idea that we're superior,"" i.e. sure , they LIVE in this suburban existence, but they're not OF it. They thought of themselves as better than their surroundings and the people around them, but they find themselves falling into the same petty concerns as the people they think they're better than. Frank isn't convinced of the Paris idea for a bit, but soon warms to it and excitedly tells everyone. One can see how the thought of moving overseas reignites their sense of superiority, brings them together, and gives them something to look forward to. One can also see that their plan is a little unrealistic.
At a certain point Kathy Bates as their neighbor Helen brings by her schizophrenic son, who responds to Frank and April's wish to move away. ""Many people see the emptiness,"" he says, ""But it takes real guts to see the hopelessness."" Once he leaves they say to each other ""He's the first person who understands what we're talking about.""

But eventually, no spoiler, their Paris dream is put on permanent hold, Frank is getting promoted and getting into his job a little bit, and the old rifts open up--and just get worse. The ending was said to be emotionally devastating but, well, not to me. And that's it.

Both DiCaprio and Winslet are great. They both convey a great deal of their emotion and character arc with their silent expressions and body language--they both just give very advanced and intelligent performances. The direction is smooth and seamless, barely noticeable, but effective and professional. Mendes effectively gets a lot of mileage out of their perfect house and the hidden menace of their furnishings. Cinematographer Roger Deakins gets rich, painterly colors out of the clothes and environments, and subtle tricks like having April's shirt being matched perfectly to the wall color, so it seems that she is literally being absorbed into the house, are effective.

The problem is that this novel came out in 1961, and I don't think very much updating was done to create this script. And in the meantime, a lot of very similar material has come out and made its impression--not least of which was American Beauty. Which is not to say that this stuff isn't true or effective, it's just that its view seems a little nave--like one from the 60s, not one from 2008. We see almost nothing of the Wheeler's life before they got married, when they supposedly developed the sense of superiority that becomes such a stumbling block for them. I would have liked to have seen what their lives were like before, to have more of a sense of where they're coming from, and fill out their psyches a bit more. We see them drink and smoke a lot, but we never see them watch television. We never see April clean the house, although it remains immaculate. We never know what she thinks about keeping the house clean, being a forward-thinker as she is. We never find out why she decided to just stay home and do nothing, if she has such an active mind. We never find out why they moved to the suburbs in the first place--why didn't they just stay in the city? Especially if being culturally engaged is so important to them. Why don't they move BACK to the city? Easier than going to Paris. The net result of this is that for all the intimacy we have with these characters, there are several key areas in which we don't know or understand them.

And the movie can only throw in so many expository lines [""Oh, they're at a birthday party""] to cover up the fact that the two kids VANISH for long, long periods of time.

With the focus so closely on the Wheeler's, we're left to wonder why their relationship has so many problems, while others' are working. Is everyone else just stupid? Just not as engaged or once alive as April and Frank? Well, we'd have to see some sense of how engaged or alive they once were in order to know that, and that information isn't here. The movie ignores this question until the final moments, in which it throws out two short answers: the couple across the street are shown deciding not to talk about the things that bother them, and in the portentous and cynical final image, Bates' husband slowly turns the volume on his hearing aid down while his wife talks. Those are your options if you want a successful marriage, folks! Ignore your problems or literally tune each other out!

Oh, and the music is obnoxious. Every few seconds the same cue: slowly rising strings, then a few gentle piano chords. Repeat 1,200 times.
Regardless, the performances are good, and that kind of makes it worth seeing. I've never seen DiCaprio be better or more soulful. Winslet is of course brilliant [though more astounding in The Reader], and it certainly isn't a waste of time. It is, however, strikingly inessential. It's a pity they couldn't have updated and widened the scope of the novel a little more to make it less of a hermetic conversation piece from an earlier time.",1246233600,21,6741,4.578293289146645

3165378,5,B0016Q2D66,"Familiarity breeds contempt, but contempt also comes out of complacency and conformity as well.  The plot of ""Revolutionary Road"" is what happens when the institution of marriage becomes more of an institution then a marriage.  One must remember in 1950's America that the divorce rate was significantly lower then what it is now.  However, that is not to mean that relationships were less troublesome nor were people less dysfunctional.  It merely means that society had more built in pressures in 1955 to at the least 'keep up appearances.'  Therefore, a loveless marriage in the mid 20th century could be maintained for many more years then what it is now in the early 21st.  ""Revolutionary Road"" follows the path less taken of an ordinary couple who eventually break through of their bourgeois pressures, but at the end the price is too much to bear.

The movie takes place during the zenith of Post-War American power, or what John Kenneth Galbraith called ""The Affluent Society.""  Mr. DiCaprio's character has enormous earning potential, and he can decide to melt away into surburban bliss, and his wife (played by Ms. Winslett) can decide to go that route too, but they decide that materialism may not be what they both want, and they decide to pack up and move to Paris.  Of course, as the the externalities of mortgage, children, money and time constrict, this plan is quickly scrapped, and everything begins to melt away.  As everything begins to disintegrate, the house (which serves as almost a secondary character) begins to shrink.  An observant viewer can almost see this happen due to the brilliant cinematography in this film.

Part of the reason this movie is so heart wrenching is that it is so very relevant to marriage now.  In 1999 Mendes captured Clinton-era surburban angst in American Beauty, he captures it much more eloquently and elaborately in this film set during the supposedly placid Eisenhower era.  Whereas 'Beauty' watched a marriage decay in post-middle age, ""Road"" captures it before middle age, where the characters are closer to the beginning of their life, then the end of it.  Part of the reason why this movie is so searing is that because these characters know each other too well, they can stick the knife in where it will do the most damage.  Unlike Mr. Spacey and Ms. Benning's characters in ""American Beauty"" one can cheer for the Wheeler's to break out of the emptiness of their lives.  However, the movie also begs the question: what good would Paris do?  Would it still reveal themselves to be nothing more then the people who meet a tragic end in Connecticut?  Or, would it reinvigorate them and let them start their lives over.

In Bob Dylan's new album he writes that 'dreams never did work for me anyways...even when they did come true.""  The true tragedy of the film is is that the characters will never know what their dreams may have held in store, and at the end they will be fated to become an old man and old woman in their living rooms babbling about nonsense, and turning down their hearing aids.  The question one must answer after watching this movie is, would it really have mattered?",1245542400,,3149,4.803339517625232
3165379,4,B0016Q2D66,"You spend your life learning to live with your own limitations and how they apply to practical life. Then you fall in love, you're mutually smitten by each other's ideals of yourselves... and suddenly, in the real world, you have to live with somebody else's unfamiliar, incomprehensible limitations as if they were your own.

At first glance, ""Revolutionary Road"" appears to be about the dark malaise beneath superficial success in 1950s suburbia; but I think it really chronicles something that happens in all times and places. We love the best in someone, but we live one whole person with another, and sometimes the compromise is more than we can bear.

A related element in the film is the realization that, as George Carlin once quipped, ""Most people aren't particularly good at anything."" Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and April (Kate Winslet) both reluctantly see that this is true of themselves; but April struggles to hold on to the belief that it need not be true of Frank, and loses respect for Frank when he no longer believes it himself.

I can't call this a great movie, but it's certainly a good one. It effectively examines a fundamental problem of human life: that the inspiration for love comes from an ideal, but the art of love lies in making peace with the realities of two people who are inevitably less than they hope to be. Frank and April could not make that leap, and perhaps never even understood that it was there.",1245542400,7,1439,4.771084337349397

3165382,5,B0016Q2D66,"""Revolutionary Road"" was adapted from Richard Yates' 1961 novel about one couple's struggle with post-War middle class ideals in a picture-perfect Connecticut suburb. Set in the mid-1950s, we see the strained marriage of April and Frank Wheeler, an aspiring actress and former longshoreman who initially shared a keen sense of adventure, a vitality that has waned since they had children and moved to the suburbs. Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) takes the train to work in New York each day with thousands of men like him. April (Kate Winslet) stays home, minds the children, chats with neighbors, and becomes increasingly frustrated with her circumscribed life. So she proposes that they give it all up, move overseas, and immerse themselves in life again. At first, Frank agrees, but then the struggle to balance security, happiness, and social pressures begins.

The 1950s were a conformist time, an era when the American middle class ideal was defined especially narrowly. Of course, people like the Wheelers led comfortable lives, for which perhaps they should have been grateful. Comfort and security are nothing to sneeze at. On the other hand, the stifling social environment and rigid value system fashionable at the time had ugly side effects: mind-numbing boredom, shallowness, isolation, hypocrisy, and alcoholism among them. What strikes me about ""Revolutionary Road"" is how contemporary it is. America entered another conformist era in the 1990s, one that I estimate is more conformist than the 1950s, as the middle class is larger, careerism is taken more seriously, and rigid and often bizarre expectations are now extended to children.

In an interesting twist, it is April, a mother of two young children, who wants to give up her comfortable home and take on a job to feel like she is still alive. But her willingness to take the situation in hand unintentionally emasculates Frank, who has slipped more easily into the constraints of middle class ambition. Or perhaps he is genuinely excited by the prospect of a promotion and higher pay. Frank has a compulsion to talk about everything, but he never says what he thinks. ""Revolutionary Road"" was directed by Sam Mendes and filmed on location inside a suburban Connecticut house. This is helpful, as the audience is placed in April's world, surrounded by walls, with windows overlooking the quaint yards of neighboring homes, and unruly woods out back where freedom seems to reign. Two outstanding performances by Winslet and DiCaprio are complimented by a sharp supporting cast, including Kathy Bates, Dylan Baker, and Michael Shannon.

The DVD (Paramount 2009): There are 5 deleted scenes with optional commentary, one featurette, and an audio commentary. ""Lives of Quiet Desperation: The Making of Revolutionary Road"" (29 min) interviews the director, cast, producers, screenwriter Justin Haythe about the film's themes, production designer Kristi Zea about the office and house sets, and costume designer Albert Wolsky. The audio commentary is by director Sam Mendes and screenwriter Justin Haythe. They compare the final cut of the film to a preliminary cut, the film to the novel, talk about characters, filming on location, and the challenges of dramatizing Frank's interior, since his thoughts were expressed in the book.

Set in the mid-50s, it focuses on the Wheelers, a regular middle-class couple with two children who live in a nice house in the suburbs. Frank has an office job which he dislikes while April is frustrated staying at home with the children. April unsuccessfully tries to pursue her dream of being an actress. Seeing how unsatisfied they both are, April suggests they move to Paris where she can work as a secretary while Frank takes time to figure out what he really wants to do in life. Things don't go quite as planned when different complications arise and even their commitment to each other gets questioned.

Podejrzewam ze bardziej wrazliwi widzowie powyginaja sobie palce az do bolu przy tym emocjonalnym ping-pongu. W pierwszych paru minutach podczas gdy poznajemy historie Wheelersow jeszcze zanim pokaze sie tytul, slodki nastroj filmu szybko przebija sie przez abazurowa granice przyzwoitosci tworczej i zakotwicza na dobre w burzliwym oceanie malzenskiej goryczy, niedopowiedzen i osobniczego manekiniarstwa. Smiem zatem twierdzic ze jego przeslanie bedzie bardziej zrozumiale dla widzow bedacych w slubnym zwiazku, ale jeszcze bardziej dla tych ktorym ten zwiazek sie rozpadl.
Z metnawego otoczenia drugoplanowych rol - niejako ""ustawiajacego zyciowe drogowskazy na Ulicy Rewolucyjnej"" i bedacego rola sama w sobie - wylania sie jaskrawa postac matematyka-wariata (Michael Shannon), ktory wydaje sie miec najbardziej klarowny wglad w istote rzeczy. Na mysl przychodzi tu rola antycznego ""greckiego choru"", wszem przypominajacego prawde rzeczywistosci. Prawde calkiem nieraz bolesna. Zastanawiajaca wydaje sie byc odwaga Mendesa ktory w obliczu swojego malzenskigo zwiazku z Winslett, podejmuje sie drazyc bytowe fatum, gdzie dylemat samo-spelnienia jest przeciwstawiony akceptacji spolecznie narzuconych rol zyciowych.
'Revolutionary Road' jest pomimo wszystko kinem pierwszej klasy, i krzywda bylby brak jego rekomendacji. Musze jednak zaznaczyc ze ogladajac ten film czulem sie jak slimak pelznacy po ostrzu brzytwy.

Kate Winslet is a fine actress but she looked like DiCaprio's mother and not a particulrly attractive mother at that.  DiCaprio looked about 18, as usual, and didn't seem to really have a grip on the role. And Kathy Bates and her family, including the brutally honest and more than slightly wacked out son, did not seem to make a lot of sense in the story--maybe as a sort of Greek chorus.  I found them unnecessarily intrusive.

I thought the depressing atmosphere of the 50's was quite well done--the sort of desperation that a lot of women felt being stuck at home and the complete inability of their spouses to understand their frustration. However, since there were virtually no lighter moments in the film, the unremitting gloom and hostility pervaded and, together with the grim ending, left you, or at least left me, completely depressed.  I don't recommend this to anyone without a great ability to bounce back from gloom.",1244851200,2,1105,4.641025641025641

----------------------------------------
After their doomed romance on the Titanic, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are reincarnated as an idealistic young couple trapped in a suburban bungalow during the stifling conformity of Eisenhower-era America. It's like a remake of ""The Shining,"" is Arthur Miller had written the script. A lot of critics went ga-ga over this film; I thought it was okay although it's clearly a Hollywood film that desperately wants to be arty and meaningful. It's definitely evocative of the psychology-based dramas of the 1940s and '50s... with swearing and abortion thrown in for good measure. As in ""Titanic,"" DiCaprio and Winslet are mismatched: she is a much better actor than he is, and they don't actually have that much chemistry between them. But, whatever. It's an okay movie.

3165393,5,B0016Q2D66,"Growing up in the 50's I see a lot of similarities in the predicament this couple find themselves in and the predicament a great number of couples find themselves in during this time period all over the U.S. following WWII and the Korean war and the rise of Hollywood glamour and the promises of the industrial age. A time when Westinghouse and Better Homes and Garden were household words and men were encouraged to bring home the bacon while women were encouraged to be good little house wives and provide a cozy little home and encourage her husband in his daily struggle foraging in the jungle for food. I particularly enjoyed the superb photography. The herd mentality of the fifties exemplified by an army of men all dressed alike in hats , ties and briefcases coming over the horizon as if going to war made its point. This was also the era where corporations began slashing male jobs in order to replace them with less expensive housewives using promises of high paying positions as a carrot. One thing I noticed was the constant reference to communications. Being able to deliver a great sales pitch was considered an asset but in the end it simply turned out to be just a lot of words and empty promises and the only way one can avoid it was to turn it off and tune out. Oh, did I fail to mention how important image was and how people were more concerned with what the neighbors would say than their own lives and how busybodies took advantage of this and used it to fleece people trying to get ahead in life. Being a model couple was the name of the game. and social climbing was the only way a woman could fulfill her need for attention. This was also a time when the industrial/military complex began taking a toll on people's lives. ""Barefoot, pregnant and in the kitchen"", a cliche of the women's movement was also a theme of the movie and the myth on what it meant to be a man from an insecure woman's point of view. The scene of the bread winner trying to explain how the new computer being made up of hundreds of vacuum tubes was exemplifying the lives of people in that era living a life in a vacuum as was the mentally ill mathematician whose memory of what he loved to do was erased from his memory through electroshock treatment so he couldn't even recall what he loved to do anymore.

It is about a couple in the 1950's who are not happy with the modern life of those times, and want to break free from everyday life.  Like I said, DiCaprio and Winslet are tremendous in this movie.  The viewer really feels like they are in the 1950's.  Other than the acting, I was disappointed in the film.

The story is about a young married couple struggling to be happy in their unhappy marriage. There is a lot of commentary on society's social expectations of marriage and women. This is a couple that seems to have gotten married and had children because this is what they are brought up to believe they are supposed to do. The movie documents their struggles and the couples inevitable downfall.

3165401,3,B0016Q2D66,"I have not read the book, so I can only comment on the movie itself. Frankly, ""Revolutionary Road"" is a depressing movie from start to finish. The story centers on Frank and April Wheeler, a nice couple residing in suburban CT and apparently living the American dream, not. April [Kate Winslet in a gut-wrenching performance] is a stifled personality, feeling neither joy or fulfillment in raising her two kids or in her marriage. She wishes to break free from the confines of suburbia and all that it entails, and hits upon a plan - get Frank [Leo Caprio] to give up his humdrum job, pack the family up and move to France, where she is convinced that she can earn a good living as a secretary [she keeps harping on the fact that secretaries get paid really well in Europe] whilst Frank figures out what he really wants to do.

This is a movie about two truly lost souls - both Frank and April aren't really sure what they want, and just feel that they're missing something, which is undefined. As a viewer, it was hard for me to connect emotionally with either character, and more so April than Frank. April is a character that is so consumed by misery that she literally sets herself on a self-destructive path, but it is hard to understand why this seemingly intelligent, beautiful woman can be so unhappy. She has two lovely children whom she doesn't spend much time with [throughout the movie, the kids are either sporadically present or not at all], she takes no pleasure in her beautiful home or surroundings, she chafes in social situations [like there's someplace better she'd rather be] and just appears miserable throughout the movie [except instances where she's packing up, hoping to leave for that beacon of light, Paris]. The only thing I could come up with was that April was clinically depressed, but even then, no one reaches out to her, especially her husband. This is never touched upon in the movie [perhaps because such things were not acknowledged back in the 50s?].

Besides the themes of an unhappy marriage and unfulfilled lives, there are other underlying themes here such as mental illness [Michael Shannon in a remarkably illuminating supporting role], abortion [back when such procedures were illegal, leading to some tragic actions and consequences], adultery, and depression. Given such dark themes, it was inevitable that ""Revolutionary Road"" would be such a depressing watch.

I loved the acting - both Kate Winslet and Leo de Caprio shine in their tormented roles, as does Michael Shannon as the mentally unbalanced mathematician with much foresight. But given how disconnected I felt to the characters being portrayed, I can only give this movie 3* at best. Only recommended to those who can stomach a dark ride into the human soul.",1244419200,3,2768,4.847780126849894
3165402,3,B0016Q2D66,"I watched this film last night and was actually a bit disappointed by it.

Her unhappieness comes from within herself, not in her conformist surroundings.  The ending is horrible and leaves me doubting April's sanity.  Skip this film.",1244419200,5,473,4.5476190476190474

Leonardo DiCaprio is stunning as well, but frankly he pales in comparison to Winslet.  Michael Shannon is also stunning in this film.  It is, overall, an excellent film that dissects several summer months in the lives of April and Frank Wheeler.  As they come to grasp the ""emptiness and hopelessness"" of their unfulfilling suburban lives, they both begin falling apart in their own ways.  It is obvious how unhappy they are ... but it is not until Frank's birthday that they attempt to do anything about it.  April comes up a grand scheme to move to Paris, so they can finally live.  Along the way, they face much resistance and soul searching as life continually throws them obstacles.

Maybe it's caused by the British director's effort not to merge with Hollywood cliches, but the film somehow fails to click on emotional level. We see the Wheeler couple's marriage falling apart - Kate Winslet in phenomenally difficult, but rather unsympathetic role and Leo DiCaprio, very naturally playing a guy who tries hard but his everyman character is just not good enough for his wife. Stuck in the 1950's, their lives are unsatisfying, going to Paris seems as the only way out. Ironically - and most similarly to ""American Beauty"" - the only person who sees through the Wheeler facade is the man confined to mental institution (Michael Shannon in a revelation role). The potential of Richard Yates' praised novel is widely said to be filmed not so fully as it should have been - maybe the film's characters are too bookish to ring true.
The bottom line for many: Is the Wheeler life really so empty? What about the rest of us? Who can tell emptiness from fulfilment? Depends on your attitude.",1244332800,,1185,4.871287128712871
3165407,5,B0016Q2D66,"A half a century ago migration from the noisy high-powered success of the city to the serenity of the suburbs found the path of REVOLUTIONARY ROAD a common one.  Richard Yates' novel about the fragility of married commitment in 1955 has been very successfully transformed to the screen by writer Justin Haythe, director Sam Mendes and a perfect cast of actors.  All of the soured expectations of that period gel in this superb film - a movie that is difficult to watch at times, mostly because it rings so very true.

Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and April (Kate Winslet) Wheeler move to Connecticut from New York when the addition of children to their lives of thwarted expectations alter their once dreamy plans for their future.  Once in the 'just perfect' little suburb and living in a just perfect little house sold to them by real estate agent
Helen Givings (Kathy Bates) - who has a grown son John (Michael Shannon) who is in a mental institution and has undergone multiple shock therapy treatments that allow him to see things as they are no matter how cruel or rude his views - Frank settles for life in the Knox Business Machines Company, reluctantly following in the footsteps of his father while April attempts to rationalize her dreams of being an actress by appearing in an unimpressive amateur theatrical group.  From the opening frames of this claustrophobically suffocating new life the once happy couple shows signs of deterioration of a marriage.  The manner in which they couple attempt to dramatically change their boring life is destroyed by the realities of their situation: another pregnancy plays a significant role in the downward spiral of Frank and April's future and we as viewers are forced to watch the castle crumble.

Winslet and DiCaprio are excellent in the lead roles, offering the type of sensitive acting skills that pull the audience into the film.  The supporting roles by Kathy Bates, Michael Shannon, David Harbour, Richard Easton and Kathryn Hahn are cameos worthy of praise.  Every aspect of the film recreates the 1955 era and in some ways that 'distance' makes observing the film emotionally more tolerable.  This is a sad story that has no redeeming end.

The book, and the movie, were both intended as an indictment of American culture and intolerance in the Age of Conformity, but, unfortunately, the movie's main characters aren't up to the task.  April wallows in narcissitic despair and a silly escape plan, while Frank, who wants to help, has no idea what to do with either his wife or himself.  To a certain extent, we are all prisoners of the culture we live in, but some do have the ability and wherewithal to rise above it and create something of value.  In Far From Heaven, one at least could believe that Cathy Whitaker(if not her husband) and Raymond Deagan had the vision and fortitude to overcome their fate.  Not so with April and Frank, two of the sorriest figures ever seen on screen.  The movie is worth seeing if for no reason but Winslet's and DiCaprio's performances.

They are so overwrought and picking fights and pushing each other's buttons that it becomes overwhelming after a very short time.  The first fight that we see, after April performs in a play, seems to come out of nowhere and to have no context.  But then, having the context and the backstory later doesn't even help all that much.  Also, the music is too loud and rather pervasive and distracting at times.

On the plus side, the photography of the lovely yet sterile-looking homes and the washed-out faces is absolutely appropriate for the subject matter and tone of the film.  A late scene with April trying to perform a procedure on herself at home is especially haunting.  Winslet and DiCaprio can't be faulted for doing the best they can with what they're given.

Excitement does come back into their lives, however, when they decide to move to Paris and do all the things they once wanted to do, but life has a way of spoiling even the best of plans.

Based on Richard Yate's seminal novel about suburban discontent, the movie has the same plot but lacks the author's sly, witty observations acknowledging the irony of people being unfulfilled amid relative luxury, luxury made possible by rigidly conforming to the expectations of society.  DiCaprio and Winslet both do competent jobs; he has a more sympathetic role, looking quite young but handsome, while she plays a desperate shrew, looking much older and being the only woman in the cast not to have the 50's look in hair and make-up.  The period is otherwise wonderfully reproduced and the movie is photographed with a lot of natural sunlight that gives a yellowed, washed-out look, befitting a story about hopelessness.

While not as memorable as the novel, the movie is still a well-made character study.

Kate Winslet and LDC are two of my favorite performers, so I went into this movie with high expectations. From the point of view of sets, camera work, acting, overall artistic merit, the movie is great. However, I also want to feel good after watching a movie, and its my fault I didn't find out enough about this one before watching it. Besides offering commentary on how marriage can turn out when dyadic adjustment to the partnership fails, for me the movie really attacked the American Dream in an unbalanced way, although for sure there is truth for some people in the situation portrayed. Additionally, the second wave, confrontational feminist undertones (why does she have to conform to the feminine, housewife role instead of pursuing her own career?, and if abortion were legal at that time she probably would not have lost her life) again take a swipe at traditional American values in a biased way. There were plenty of people very happy with the American Dream as it manifested in the 1950s, not everybody falls prey to adultery so easily, and not all women want to burn their bras. Add to all of that the very nasty ending and that's why I was left reeling, wishing I hadn't even started watching. For me, if I want to see misery, I can observe plenty of it out there in the real world, and I don't want it turning up in the movies I watch. I like to see things resolved nicely, and I want to walk away feeling happy, like there's hope, like life can be good.

However, I am always a fan of Kate Winslet (and Kathy Bates), so for those reasons, I do applaud this film and recommend it to anyone who is a fan of both (or either), as well as those who enjoy watching Leonardo DiCaprio.

Basically, the film, like the book, addresses the angst that often befalls suburbanites, especially during this particular time in midcentury suburbia.  These two people feel that they have not quite lived up to their special attributes - after all, they were destined for something MORE - but unhappily, they are still plagued by boredom, disillusionment, and that ever-present feeling of ""is this all there is?""

What happens next, to stir things up a bit, is certainly predictable - extramarital dalliances, followed by a last-ditch attempt to shake things up a bit, and then, finally, an unexpected pregnancy that throws a wrench into their best-laid plans.

What will they do?  Will the husband and wife reconnect, or will their plans go awry?

Unexpected tragedy turns their worlds on end and reminds us all that life often dishes out more than we think we can handle.

3165414,5,B0016Q2D66,"For me a good movie isn't necessarily one that is simply fun to sit through as much as one that makes me reflect and draw meanings that I can use -- or relate to -- in my own life.  For me, this movie highlights the futility, the emotional void, the boredom of living a self-centered life.  While the film seemed to be about the inner conflict of following one's heart in spite of the fear and the unknown vs. the pull towards safety and tradition and conformity, it really is not.  I related to the desire to go to Paris because for the past year I have thought long and hard about taking a one year round-the-world adventure, leaving the comfort and safety of the world I know.  However, April would not have been happy in Paris.  I think of the clich&eacute; ""wherever you go, there you are"".  She would eventually have found herself in the same emotional void she felt while living in Connecticut.  While traveling and adventure are great, we truly cannot run away from ourselves.  I think of this woman April who was beautiful on the outside, had a husband who wasn't perfect but who really cared and really tried to reach through his wife's mask (for instance, he is the one who confessed to her of his own wanderings because I think he really did strive to be a man of values in spite of his imperfection...In the movie he is the only person who did any growing and maturing), who had a lovely home, beautiful children (who were free of any obvious disadvantages such as birth defects, learning disabilities, etc), and lived in a peaceful setting.  Yet because she was so wrapped up in her own self-centeredness, she wasn't able to enjoy any of it.

I also wondered about her family.  Didn't she have any before she got married?  This could be partly what was involved in her developing her Narcissistic Personality Disorder.  I am not a psychologist and could be wrong but I think she also demonstrated a Borderline Personality Disorder.

Character development was profound.  Acting was compelling.  Costumes and scenery were perfect for the story.

There were many sub-plots and sub-meanings such as the purposelessness of conformity, the nature of insanity, and of course the ending which deals with one of our most controversial topics in our current society which I won't comment on because I don't want to give away the ending.

In the end, I think of how different April's experience in life could/would have been had she been able to be comfortable with her own self and find joy in making a contribution to something greater than her own self. I used to think a lot like this character and look down upon what I perceived to be ""the establishment"".  But I have learned that life simply reflects back to you that which you are.  If you are shallow, then life will appear shallow and without meaning.  If you are giving, then life will appear abundant.  If we are superficial, that is how society will seem.  It all starts from within and there really is nowhere to run away to where we don't bring ourselves.  If we can find peace within our self (through our life's work, through making a difference, through genuinely loving other people, through religion or spirituality, etc), we can find meaning wherever we are.

Having said all that, my friend with whom I saw the movie pretty much hated it.  He likes ""James Bond"" type movies and he was bored.",1244160000,6,3366,4.624579124579125
3165415,5,B0016Q2D66,"This movie was troubling to watch, but I understand that was Yates' intention when he wrote the book- a caustic and searing portrayal of life in 1950s suburbia. The chemistry between the DeCaprio and Winslet characters worked well (disclaimer: I have never seen Titanic), and the situation was an eerily familiar one for my wife and me: stay in a comfortable but potentially numbing existence, or take a chance and move to Europe (Budapest, not Paris). The dilemmas posed in this film were all too real, especially for the time and place where April's character had few options. The atmosphere of disapproval, from Frank's colleagues at work to the Wheeler's neighbors, was also an accurate depiction. There is a real contradiction between the American cultural enshrinement of individuality, with the condemnation shown when that individuality raises difficult questions about people's own lives and the comfort of conformity. Every character was tragic in some way or another, some more than others, but as real characters they were not so far removed from what anyone could possibly be.",1244073600,7,1089,5.193181818181818
3165416,4,B0016Q2D66,"Having been a huge fan of the novel, and being totally in love with any and everything `Kate Winslet', it's needless to say that I was really, really anticipating this film all year long.  The trailer (complete with the operatic score) just made my skin crawl with excitement.  As the Oscar season progressed and I watched this film get repeatedly snubbed I began to worry, but my interest and anticipation did not dwindle.

And then I saw the film.

`Revolutionary Road' is really a mixed bag of tricks, with a lot going for it, but enough working against it to keep it from becoming the brilliant drama it should have been.  The novel, one of my personal favorites, reeks of humanity and blunt honesty, and while the film carries with it a genuine awkwardness, it's overt obviousness can at times take away from the message Yates was trying to provide us.

The film tells the story of Frank and April Wheeler, a young suburban couple living in the 50's who loathe their lives.  They are stuck in a nice house on a nice street littered with nice people.  They have nice kids and Frank works at a nice job and they are basically sick of the existence they've pigeonholed themselves into.  They want to be free, free from the generalities that make their life so loathsome.  The point is that while their life appears to be perfect, it is that perfection that drives them crazy.  It is that perfection (and their growing distain for their lack of spontaneity) that has driven a hole into their marriage and caused them to attack one another, picking at their faults and growing to detest the very sight of one another.

Be forewarned; `Revolutionary Road' is one of the bleakest films released in recent memory.

In a stroke of desperation, April suggests that Frank quit his job and move the family to Paris, where he would be free to find himself while she supported him and the children doing secretarial work.  Despite the mixed reaction from friends and workmates, Frank seems keen on the idea.

But is he?

Sam Mendes manages to do a lot of justice to Richard Yates' novel, I cannot fault him there.  His style of direction, from the choice in music to the graceful way he captured the era within the actors, was completely complimentary to the source material.  I was in awe of almost every frame, each one just as beautiful as the next.  That had a lot to do with the costume design as well, and the set pieces are glorious.  I loved the crisp whites and overall brightness of most the scenes; the open rooms within their home splattered with yellows and creams and basically adding to the idea that it is the cheery normality of it all that is the evilest creature.

This is a story about loathing complacency.

The acting for the most part is stellar.  Kate Winslet slips in very easily here, and while it can be said that she has done this role before I don't think that she has ever done it so well.  She is a pro, there is no denying that.  Leonardo DiCaprio feels slightly awkward in scenes, as if he isn't sure he knows how to get a full handle on his character; but when he is really needed in order to sell a scene (that brutal fight sequence towards the films end for one) he really nails it.  It's a slightly uneven performance, but there is more good than bad here.  I was more impressed with David Harbour, who plays Shep, the Wheeler's neighbor.  I remember when I read the novel I was really drawn to Shep's quiet yearning for April, and his total feeling of loss.  Harbour nails that.  I would have much rather seen him garner an Oscar nomination over Michael Shannon, who did was he was asked to do but nothing more.  Shannon, in his portrayal of the mentally unstable John Givings, plays `crazy' the way crazy is always played.  I really wanted him to layer this character, since it is within this character that the Wheeler's whole world is brought to fruition.

He just didn't do that for me.

This is where the films primary flaw lies.  Within the Wheeler's dealings with John and his parents (gloriously played by Kathy Bates and Richard Easton) their whole existence, motives and underlying feelings towards each other, is unveiled.  In the novel, while it is almost delivered in the same manner, it appears more subtle and discreet.  No one likes to be browbeat, and so Yates, while maintaining the bluntness with which he treated his characters from the novels beginning, managed to tell us what was `really' going on without `telling' us.  In the film adaptation the same structure is used, but Shannon's delivery of each line feels far too brutish for it to really make an impact.  There is no feeling of mystery or emotional reveal.

He yells, they react, we get the picture.

Had Shannon toned down his approach and actually `lived' that moment as apposed to `act' it, we would have felt something close to what Yates captures on the printed page.

In the end, `Revolutionary Road' is well worth seeing.  The film is harsh, very harsh, and there are no happy endings so don't wait up for them.  This is a film in vein of the novel, truly capturing the harrowing realities of a marriage on the rocks.  This is honest, brutally so, and thus it is not for everyone.  Many people want to escape the realities of life in film, and if that is your intent then stay far away from `Revolutionary Road'.  If, on the other hand, you like to experience film in order to reveal truths about yourself and those around you, then by all means, see this movie.  It will not leave you feeling warm all over.  It will most likely make you squirm in discomfort and break down into tears and leave you in a state of misery (my wife balled her eyes out and lost sleep), but the films honesty is nearly unrivaled.

Despite a few flaws it is intelligent, engaging and unforgettable.",1244073600,,5795,4.546332046332046

If it all meant something it might be bearable, but Mendes is only interested in the ritual of these stories.

It's set in the fifties but it speaks to all generations, it voices a frightening desperation of mediocre lives lived, waiting for something bigger to come around the bend. The fighting scenes are so real and so filled with pain that I was spellbound. They are meant to be together it's just that April (Kate W) has the courage to leap while her mate(Leo) can't quite take that step and it's that very chasm that rips them apart.

3165423,5,B0016Q2D66,"Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio are brilliant in this very sharp satire of American life and practice in the 50s in the USA.

The film has many layers to it, and it posits a dissatisfaction with life in particular and in general in a world that is completely artificial. The dramatic escape plan, suggested and then demanded by the wife, is merely an extension of the American sense of se;f removal to another ""site"" in order to get going with USA values. It does not work.

The breeding family of then and now comes under scrutiny and is found wanting; religious values or ideas are not in evidence, and so there is no leadership in this quarter nor in any other quarter. What the film exposes too are the absurd verbal solutions to problems, hence the wife constantly asking her husband to shut up, and he will not do so, as babble takes over for reason and engulfs the wife and the whole neighborhood.

What keeps the structure of society in this film going are cliches, notions, attitudes, phrases that preach and teach nothing. The fear of the wife and her final actions have the quality of truth when set beside the options she has..suburban death, chronic dissatisfaction on all levels.

There is more, but I will not spoil it; see this film if you are excited by ideas and deeper cosiderations than sit coms and melodramas serve up. This is film as art, acting as perhaps the only route to go for us in understanding the darkness that hates the light.

The other reviews that have issues with boredom or surprise are Mall Movie goers. This is not for entertainment seekers, but for mature thinkers and lovers of film as art.",1243641600,,1636,4.5699658703071675
3165424,5,B0016Q2D66,"There is an audio commentary by director Sam Mendes and screenwriter Justin Haythe. According to Mendes, the BBC owned the rights to Yates' book and asked Haythe to adapt it four years ago. They shot the entire film on location and almost completely in sequence so that DiCaprio and Winslet really lived with their characters. Mendes says that the look of the film was not inspired by other films but a documentary about the suburbs and photographs from the era. Haythe talks at length about adapting the book to film - what was left out, changed and so on.

""Lives of Quiet Desperation: The Making of Revolutionary Road"" is a very classy featurette on how this film came together. Winslet was a big fan of the book and really wanted to make it into a film. Mendes had just finished&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jarhead-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000E0OBK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jarhead (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;and didn't want to jump right into another film but Winslet worked on him for a year until he agreed to do it. It also took Winslet two years to convince DiCaprio to do the film and he loved the script and the chance to work with her again. This featurette also touches upon the challenge of working on location and how the fantastic look of the film was achieved.

Finally, there are five deleted scenes with optional commentary by Mendes and Haythe. There is a scene that was to reveal the Wheeler children earlier on in the film. There is also more footage of the Wheelers visiting with their next-door neighbors with DiCaprio delivering an excellent monologue that reveals more about his character. We see more footage of Frank commuting to work. There is also a flashback with the Wheelers seeing their new home. Mendes and Haythe talk about why this footage was cut and put it into context with the rest of the film.",1243555200,,1906,5.12540192926045
3165425,5,B0016Q2D66,"Sam Mendes surpasses his oscar winning American Beauty with a shattering portrayal of a husband and wife trying to hold on to any dream left in their path. Too often this film has been touted as ""a study of a couple in suburban life"". This may be why it got buried in the oscar race. Audiences and critics missed the importance of the story entirely.

Mendes raises many complicated questions by the film's ending and he doesn't offer very many easy answers. But this is exactly why the movie is so important and compelling from beginning to end. Was she completely rational to want to move to Paris or was she irresponsible and bordering on insantiy? Was he a coward for deciding not to go or was he brave and sane for trying to do the responsible thing? Mendes has made a film that reminds one of Elia Kazan at his best.  The script brilliantly evokes Tennesee Williams at this best.

Kate Winslet is of course superb as the lead character. There has not been such a portrayal of a complex character like this since viviegn leigh as Blanche Du Bois in Streetcar. Michael Shannon is frightening as the next door neighbor,who comes across as some kind of bizarre prophet to the couple.

But it is Leonardo Di Caprio who really captivates in this movie. Like he did as a teenager in some of his best film work, he evokes a vulnerability and daring that makes him a great actor. He has matured into the adult actor in an astouding way like the great jodie foster. Maybe it's easy to overlook this with his brilliant portrayal in Titanic that many can't forget.

And the ending, well that was just disgusting (I think it would have been far more effective to not actually show anything)
A roller-coaster that slides from delight to utter despair. Sadly, although we see the characters are smiling, we never feel like doing it ourselves. There are no 'normal' moments, moments that actually reflect real life I.E. humour or love. By the end, you'll be feeling distinctly cold.",1242518400,11,744,5.10655737704918

That's SO revolutionary - pun intended! I mean come on, who doesn't know this or has experienced this in their own life, who's over 30? Isn't this common knowledge? It's just that in this case, the wife (played by Winslet) can't handle the compromise and live the more realistic lifestyle, but the husband (played by Di Caprio) seems able to do so and there is our ""crisis"" in the film. Really a very overrated film, in my opinion.

6/18/2011:

I watched this movie for a 2nd time today and I must say that I liked it much better after a 2nd viewing and bumped it up from 2 to 3-stars. However, I do still believe the movie to be over-rated and a bit simplistic in its criticism of 50's American suburbia. But at least this time from the comfort of my own home (v. the 1st viewing on a plane) I was able to focus more on the characters rather than being focused on my boredom of the story.

I read some of the other reviews and comments people made about the film and was quite surprised at the number of people that felt sympathy for April (Winslet's character). Of course most of them were women. I personally was disgusted by her character especially towards the end of the film as she turns her back on her children, her husband, and her home. Frank was not without fault but he seemed a much more stable character to me v. April who definitely was seemingly on a balance beam between sanity and insanity.

3165429,5,B0016Q2D66,"This film could have been a melodramatic mash and it is not. In fact the situation and the various developments make it quasi-tragic. Tragic because it is the story of a totally impossible epiphany for a couple who is living in our modern society. There is no escape from the present programmed and even pre-fabricated life in which we all live. We have practically no freedom of choice. The only freedom of choice we do have is to refuse a possible promotion, a potential chance in this life, and we will end up on the dump, the manure pile. There is no choice because we have to pay for the house, the car, the children's education, and so many other things. There is no real choice because our psyches have been pre-determined into accepting the small little tiny wee box that has been attributed to our life. Our psyche is always opportunistic and it always goes the way the wind blows. Even a simple accident, like an unwanted pregnancy, the result of a negligence as for preventive protection, the result of going out bareback when it is well known we are supposed to go out covered, if we want to really have a choice, becomes the direst tragedy of all times. But we are in such a formatted life that we forget something because ""they"", the big brothers of this brave new world, have mesmerized us into forgetting. There is no simple way out, there is no way out at all. Any attempt at trying to evade the consequences of this event will lead to an even worse catastrophe, like death, or suicide, or death by suicide or suicide by death. Tragic indeed. I will also add that the main two actors are outrageously outstanding. They play their anger, their disorientation, their psychoses, their schizophrenias even with such realism and conviction that we may think they are playing their own roles, their own parts, their own private fate and destiny. It is true the cameraman is also quite prodigious. The way he takes the profile of Di Caprio when this one is supposed to be stubbornly refusing any move brings out this stubborn-ness revealed by the very line of the forehead seen under that profile angle, a Neanderthal or apish profile indeed. It is such details that make an actor and a film remarkable. It is true too that the insane, deranged son of the real estate agent is truer than nature, more prophetic about this society than all the Bibles of the world, than all the Freuds and Marxes of this low, low world of ours.

The chemistry between these two is as strong as ever but in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revolutionary-Road/dp/B0016Q2D66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revolutionary Road</a>&nbsp;they are steeped in misery. April Wheeler (Winslet) has aspirations--to be an actress, to be special somehow, to rise above the cookie-cutter suburban life. Frank Wheeler (DiCaprio) is a cog in the machinery at a New York business and dealing with his 30th birthday by having an affair. They are anchored (and not in a good way) by two children, predictable friends and neighbors, and the daily grind.

April comes up with the idea of moving to Paris where Frank can ""find himself"" while she supports the family with secretarial work. He goes along with it and the planning gets underway. Their friends disapprove but the cachet, the specialness of it all, pleases them--until they find out that April is pregnant. The pregnancy and Frank's promotion at work lead him to change his mind about Paris.

April and Frank fight bitterly throughout this dark movie, which is based on the 1961 novel by Richard Yates. If there is one flaw in the premise--or possibly it's a strength---it is that the suburban motif in their lives is drawn too lightly to justify the Wheelers' misery. Their own personal unhappiness and incompatibility seem universal, and they talk about it endlessly. Faced with the collapse of their Paris plans, April says, ""For years I thought we've shared this secret that we would be wonderful in the world ... We were never special or destined or anything at all."" The pathos of this realization is by no means unique to this couple, but it drives the end of the movie to its painful outcome.

The production is beautiful and moody, with wonderful costumes and sets bringing the middle of the century to life. Director Sam Mendes--Winslet's husband--delivers a vehicle that may have slightly more for Winslet to work with than DiCaprio; his angst is played out slightly less convincingly than hers, I thought. The ""Greek chorus"" of a neighbor (Kathy Bates) and her mentally ill son (Michael Shannon) provides back-story and outsider commentary on the problems in the Wheelers' life; Shannon's masterful performance commanded an Oscar but as a device for furthering the story, I thought it was a shade heavily drawn.

I couldn't take my eyes off this gorgeously designed film, and its dark atmosphere left me with many questions. Is it hubris to imagine that you are special? Is it weakness of character to plan a dramatic escape from the everyday-ness of life? When you run away, don't you take yourself with you? Don't problems need to be resolved where they live? And when a dream collapses, how well do we deal with it? These may or may not be the musings that  Mendes and his screenwriters and cast were intending to spark, but they are the questions that stayed with me. Four stars.

I could completely relate to the characters and, had I married someone not as adventurous as myself, may have found myself living the same nightmare. It was like I could see on screen what my life would've been like if I'd chosen the wrong partner.  I hung on every word of dialogue and thought the screenplay was extraordinary, especially considering it was adapted from such a fine novel.

None of the others (American Beauty, Far From Heaven) had grabbed me the way this one did. The fact that it was set in the 50s didn't mean much to me because that's not the ultimate focus of the message for me.  The acting is flawless and I thought the movie was absolutely robbed at the Oscars. At least Kate was recognized for The Reader.  If you can appreciate a well written and acted marital tragedy, you won't find a better film.",1238544000,4,1210,4.403587443946188
3165433,4,B0016Q2D66,"As a longtime admirer of the novel ""Revolutionary Road"" (Yates can really turn a phrase), I thrilled with anticipation when I learned one of my favorite actors, Leonardo DiCaprio, was to star in a big-screen adaptation. It's an actors' movie. In fact, the word ""acting"" seems cheap and insufficient to describe what DiCaprio and Winslett accomplished in this extraordinary film that on the surface indicts suburbia but more deeply jabs at narcissism. Forget about ""characters,"" The reunited ""Titanic"" stars employ their legendary chemistry to engender wholly realized, actual people, people so real that it's sometimes uncomfortable to watch their private lives imploding in an arena so public as a movie theater. There in lies the problem with this film's fleeting popularity and Oscar snub. There is no irony. No editorial comment. No distance of any kind. Just two hours of raw emotion. Director Sam Mendes and his stars perfectly depict-- note-by-note, tear-by-tear, deception-by-deception-- the painful collapse of a marriage and shameful self-realizations of one's small place in the world. But who wants to live through that -- even as a spectator?",1236643200,4,1155,5.386740331491713
3165434,3,B0016Q2D66,"Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, stars of ""Titanic,"" reunite for the first time in eleven years for ""Revolutionary Road,"" but their new film's tone is far from romantic. That is no surprise as the film is directed by Sam Mendes, known for his ""American Beauty"" and ""Road to Perdition,"" and when the critics and reviewers say ""Revolutionary Road"" is a depressing film, they are exactly telling you the truth.

The real point is, however, that depressing mood comes not from the nature of the story itself - see what happened to Jack at the end of ""Titanic."" It was sad, but not depressing. No, the film's depressing tone comes from seeing too much of unhappy characters who choose to be depressing.

Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio play a married couple April and Frank, who settle in a beautiful house on ""Revolutionary Road"" in the mid-50s. After the brief scene of April's disastrous amateur stage production, we realize their married life is not going well.

I am not particularly against the film's vision about American dream turned nightmare. The problem for me is that ""Revolutionary Road"" overstates the point. The characters talk much about themselves. Their efforts are all fertile. What they do is meaningless. Life is miserable and empty. They are not happy even having affairs with someone else. OK, their life is hollow, I know, but what else does the film offer besides what we realize in the first 30 minutes?

The acting of Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio is fine. And throughout the film we are aware that they are acting. Their acting is too good (or serious) for these characters they play, which rather belong to melodramatic world. This is why Michael Shannon (deservedly nominated for Oscar) steals every scene from them as a mentally troubled teacher, who relentlessly tells these characters what we have already known. His character has a mystery, or originality, that ""Revolutionary Road"" ultimately needs.",1235779200,,1941,5.0186335403726705
3165435,5,B0016Q2D66,"Adapted from Richard Yates first novel, Revolutionary Road exposes the adversities of a young couple living in a Connecticut suburban neighborhood during the 1950's who simply realize too late that they were never meant to be.

Frank Wheeler (Dicaprio) and April Wheeler (Winslet) feel as though they must standout from all the other mundane and ordinary suburbanites in their neighborhood. Frank, a marketer who works for Knoxx business (equivalent to IBM in those days) machines, is profoundly miserable at his job as he diligently works in a cubicle and engages in secretarial affairs with the novice typist. April, a struggling actress, who apparently never received her big break in show biz does not like to talk about her failures.

During the beginning of the film, we are introduced to a quick flashback of how they met at a party while they were younger; Frank exhibits his witty, charming charisma as he gives April the impression of eventually leading a spontaneous life in Paris in the future. However, the viewer only begins to find out that this was merely a sales pitch or a common characteristic of a marketer. On the contrary, April falls for it no less. Fast forwarding to the present, April now lives in an ordinary life on Revolutionary Road with Frank and her two children and receives frequent visits from her inquisitive real estate agent (Kathy Bates) accompanied with her ""mentally unstable"" son. April feels as though she is leading a very unsatisfying and unfulfilled life. To add some excitement in their relationship, April broaches Frank's former idea of actually pursuing a career and settling in Paris as a secretary because it simply pays handsomely; meanwhile, it will beneficially fit Frank because he can finally figure out what he wants to do with his life. Frank refuses at first because according to him it is just ""unrealistic"" but eventually obliges because he too feels as though they need something new and spontaneous to reinvent their relationship. Despite the neighbors and Frank's fellow co-workers disbelief in this ""childish"" and radical decision, things seem to go very smoothly in the Wheeler family; the house they just bought is now on sale, their belongings are packed, the children are excited, life could not be any better.

It all seems too swell for this tragic couple, when suddenly Frank is offered a promotion at his redundant job with a higher paying position, heavier responsibilities, and more importantly a chance to be apart of something great, the computer. Frank refuses this handsome offer from his boss at first because it interferes with their big trip to Paris. On the other hand, Frank cannot resist the temptation and is drawn to stay at this job because of the attachment he has regarding his father. We learn that Frank's father has also worked at Knoxx Business Machines for 30 years. It suggests as though Frank has a yearning desire to fulfill this empty legacy. On a different note, it strongly expresses Frank's inability to change and triumph over his trepidation. This couple struggles to achieve any sort of compromise as their lays a serious conflict of interest regarding their futures. April wants a lifestyle change in Paris; meanwhile, Frank is satisfied working in a miserable occupation with a higher salary. This relationship portrays that conflict of interest incessantly; it also shows how it affects their lifestyle and how they grapple with the consequences. It is not pleasant I rest assure you. (You'll see what I mean)

The bigger picture here is the heavy social commentary implemented in this film at almost every other scene. It reflects and exposes the culture of the 1950's, the struggles of an unhappy relationship, and the fine line between insanity and simply pure genius. It also sheds light upon questions such as what is insanity and what is mean to be medically and mentally unstable? The reality is that the real estate agent's son who is ""mentally unstable"" by society is the only one that possesses a real intellectual and realistic perception on the wheeler's relationship.(Go figure) The Wheeler's relationship and decisions are constantly being influenced by other people and we see this through Frank's work environment, the neighbors, and the real estate agent. April is victimized as a prisoner of culture and her difficulty of coping with the dynamics of the role of a wife during the 1950's. Some might question her role in the film and ask, well, why doesn't she just get a divorce, or leave Frank? It just wasn't that simple during that time period as it was considered taboo or dishonorable to leave or separate from your husband. April wishes she could leave the house but is drawn back to it like a magnet because she has two children, a husband, and could not possibly earn a lucrative living in those days considering the job opportunities available at that time period. In that regard, April is prisoner of the house, living in an inescapable environment. She is a prisoner living in a prison within a prison. Frank is a mere coward that cannot confront the social obstacles of change. Like April, Frank too, is a prisoner as well. Hence, my conclusion, a couple that was never meant to be.

Personally, I enjoyed this film not because of the setting, or from the great performances, but the realism that is portrayed here in this relationship. It is quite unique in the sense that the film does not sugar coat anything. Not to be too clichd or anything but it echoes the expression ""it is what it is"". In that regard it may turn some people off. I happen to cherish and embraced this message. If you like this film, check out ""A Doll's House"" with Anthony Hopkins. Both are excellent but sad films.  They express a similar struggle of a couple resisting to conform to society.",1235433600,112,5808,4.9153924566768605
3165436,3,B0016Q2D66,"Revolutionary Road begins in an almost promising manner with a seemingly content couple meeting, then sort of flash forwards into their lives to a sunny suburb where they live in a lovely home with children, and everything seems peachy.

Unfortunetely underneath their calm exteriors, the couple, played to perfection by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio really aren't all that happy with their lives.

The plot is both simple and complex. The film is really about the emotions of the characters. The distrust, deception, adultery- you name it and it can be found in this film.

It is not always pleasant to watch but you almost can't stop watching the pair of spectacular actors do their thing. If it weren't for them, I don't think the film would be as interesting.

Truthfully, after watching it, I can't really make up my mind as to whether I liked this film or not. It is an odd type of film where really you should despise every character and their situation, and yet you find something redeaming along the way.

The film is certainly a downer and I'm not sure of a second viewing. It is a well-crafted movie with minor flaws which don't really detract but make it that much harder to enjoy it.  It certainly makes you think and I suppose it accomplishes that much at least.",1235260800,,1281,4.671111111111111
3165437,3,B0016Q2D66,"I went to see this film, in spite of mediocre reviews, just to see Winslet and DiCaprio.  They did not disappoint!  I sat through the whole thing just because of their amazing performances, especially Winslet's.

However...the script is a whole other thing!  I understand, from reading other reviews here, that the novel from which the film was made was written in the late fifties and that explains a lot.  The main issue appears to be the stultifying influence of suburban life and the impossibility for any sentient being, especially one with artistic aspirations, to live a decent life there.  As we, in 2009, look at the house which poor April (Winslet) feels is her prison we groan.  Poor woman has to put up with that, and wear her nice clothes and stay home and cook for her two beautiful children and then sleep with her handsome husband.  We weep for her dilemma!  No wonder she screams all the time at the guy who goes to work every day at a job he hates in order to finance all this...

What bothered me about the film was that it seemed that Mendes was sympathizing with April and making the husband the bad guy.  I'm a woman and I found it hard to sympathize with April at all.  The husband keeps trying to talk to her about their relationship problems and she just doesn't want to talk.  That sounds backwards to me!

I lived through the 50's and do remember the problems that the novel is addressing.  I haven't read it but it sounds like it was a good treatise for that time.  But now, fortunately, we have evolved and the problems of these people seem really unrealistic to modern eyes.  I kept agreeing with the husband who said that they could have a happy life, yes even there in the gorgeous Connecticut suburban house that seemed to have a woods in the back yard.  A raise was coming, her husband had found something in his job that finally captured his interest, it seemed that their problems were solved.

Another thing that bothered me was the way the children were treated.  We saw them, once, idyllically photographed through the spray of the garden hose, but they weren't around much.  April claimed to love them but we don't see much interaction with them. There was more interaction with the neighbors.  What really was April's problem?  She didn't seem to be much of an actress.  If she really wanted to pursue acting, Manhattan was only a train ride away and she could have hired a baby sitter and taken classes with Lee Strasberg or Herbert Berghoff!  Maybe the novel gives more background on her to make her incredible unhappiness more justifiable.  But the way Mendes makes this film, she is shown to suffer simply because she has to live there and egad, have another beautiful child and somehow it's her husband's fault.

By the end of the film I had lost any sympathy for April, in spite of Winslet's superb performance and I wished her husband better luck next time.

I have to wonder what in this film attracted Mendes---perhaps the opportunity to work with his wife and the added attraction of the reunion of the Titanic co-stars.  Too bad he didn't wait for a better script.",1235174400,10,3116,4.5840867992766725
3165438,2,B0016Q2D66,"Moviegoers who found ""American Beauty"" forced and its satirical targets largely way over the top (viz. Annette Bening's character and actions) would do well to avoid ""Revolutionary Road."" This film is positively dug out with a steam shovel, its revelation of 1950's conformity by Sam Mendes about as revolutionary and exciting as a rediscovery of the wheel.

An equally tiresome aspect of the film is the blatant overacting of both Winslet and DiCaprio in just about all of their scenes -lots of screaming and yelling, with less going on than meets the ears.

Finally, there's the casting of DiCaprio in grown up roles. An excellent  actor as a youth, unfortunately, like Patty Duke, he's hard to believe when cast in adult parts. He invariably resembles just a high school boy made up to portray someone years older, and it's too easy to separate the actor from the character being portrayed. All in all, this is in no way a memorable film.",1234742400,10,941,4.832298136645963
3165439,1,B0016Q2D66,"Warning! Warning!  Earnestness approaching!  Danger!  Danger!  Who are these people??  Leo looks about 12 years old, and Kate looks like his mother (and, from certain angles, like his father).  Leo squints, and then flies off the handle.  Kate frowns, has no hobbies, no friends, and no believable character. Even her hair colour is unconvincing. Rather than being immersed in the world of the story, we are forced to watch these actors act.  They speak in arch dialogue and emote.  It's like watching a bad play.  And it goes on for two hours.

Oh, the pain!  The pain!  It's all so earnest.  You can almost hear the actors commending each other for their work and feeling lucky to be working with, or married to, such an important director and picking out what clothes they will wear to Oscar ceremonies.  What is more, in the best Hollywood tradition, mental illness, replete with references to electro-convulsive therapy, is wheeled in and we, the impressionable audience, are invited to laugh.  In an interview available on [...], Sam Mendes congratulates himself on a job well done.  He also thinks the film contains ""emotional truth"".  Given the above, is Mr. Mendes: a) serious?  b)very serious?  c)too serious?  d)a bubble-headed booby?

The film would have been far more succesful if it had ended with Kate running away with the robot from the original TV series of Lost in Space (the sex scenes would have been more interesting too, and the social commentary less self-conscious).  Indeed, if the neighbours had been the entire space-family Robinson, then I would have enjoyed the film immensely.  As it was, like Dr. Zachary Smith, I was filled with the desire to return to planet Earth as quickly as possible.",1234396800,17,1722,4.919860627177701
3165440,4,B0016Q2D66,"Hollywood seems to like to explore the idea that American suburbia is a cultural, spiritual, moral and BORING wasteland.  How many times have we seen this shot:  A camera on a crane is overlooking a typical street in a typical, cookie-cutter subdivision...when all the cars full of all the people leaving for work back out of all the garages at the same moment...and they're all the same make & color of car?  Ha ha!  That was funny the first dozen times I saw it.  It's even a big part of the opening credits for WEEDS.  And in more ""serious"" movies, denizens of suburbia are all burnt-out middle management types, with bored wives who no longer love or lust for their spouses, and they've all got kids who are spoiled brats, firestarters, druggies or kids trying to GET AWAY from all the BS and phoniness.

It's a VERY tired idea, and from viewing the trailers for REVOLUTIONARY ROAD, it sure looked like Sam Mendes was going to travel that road again...a road recently covered by the excellent MAD MEN.  It looked like Mendes' own AMERICAN BEAUTY, but without a sense of humor and set in the `50s.  But my wife and I finally dragged ourselves anyway, because Kate Winslet is too good to miss.

In some ways, the film DOES imply that the sameness of suburbia and the drudgery of taking a train ""into the city"" for work kills the soul and deadens the creative spark.  We see familiar scenes of New York City middle-managers trudging from the train station, all with identical suits, ties & briefcases.  They all smoke.  They all drink.  They all cheat on their wives.  They all look utterly miserable and bored...hopeless.

I happen to know that folks CAN live in suburbia, and commute a great distance AND be happy.  I know that people who live IN a bustling, alive, creative city can be miserable.  The old clich ""home is where the heart is"" is true.  I've endured long drives every day to work so my young family could have a house on a quite street with a decent backyard.  I hated my drive...but I loved coming home.  I know a lot of people like that...Hollywood just chooses to believe they can exist.  In these kinds of films, the friends and neighbors living the same lifestyle are all equally unhappy.

In REVOLUTIONARY ROAD, Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are young citydwellers who meet at a very artsy looking party, probably in the Village.  They fall madly in love...but we leap forward a few years, and they're living in suburbia (in a gorgeous house, I might add) and have a couple of young children.  All their dreams of living in Paris are dead.  DiCaprio goes to a job he clearly hates (and in which he's clearly asked to actually DO very little).  Winslet is the stay-at-home mom who is going just a little  crazy.  She's bored with her life, but is also terrified that she and her husband are WASTING their potential and falling out of love with each other.

They have some spectacular verbal battles, doing lots of psychic damage to each other.  Yet Winslet is fiercely determined to break the cycle and she concocts a crazy plan.  Sell the house, quit the job, grab the savings and move to Paris.  Winslet will work as a secretary and DiCaprio can spend a few months ""finding out what he really wants to do.""  My goodness, if that isn't an invitation for extended navel gazing, I don't know what is!  DiCaprio agrees to the plan, and the couple begin to make plans to unravel their domestic situation.

A few complications arise, of course...some dramatic and some rather subtle.  They couple reconciles, falls apart, reconciles, etc.  It's all impeccably staged and acted.  It feels like a play, in fact.  The overall production is lovely, but has a fussiness to it that keeps the movie from ever letting loose.  It's almost like the indictment of suburban ennui had inflicted the movie with a lackadaisical sensibility.  It's carefully put together, but has only moments of true life bursting in it...otherwise it feels too observational and not immersive.

But interestingly, it emerges not so much as an indictment of suburbia as a whole, but as almost an exploration of delusion or even mental illness.  I won't tell you WHOSE illness...although you can probably guess anyway.  We all like to think we're a little special...but most of us don't think we're spectacularly special.  What if we did?  What if we genuinely believed we were living amongst ignorant clods who couldn't possibly understand how special and full of bright, shining greatness we are?  Wouldn't that drive us a little crazy?  Wouldn't we scheme to escape?  And when escape becomes an obsession, and ""real life"" conspires to hold us back...just how would we respond?  That's what REVOLUTIONARY ROAD was actually about to me (not sure if that's what Mendes wanted, but that's what I got).  The ability of some people to delude themselves constantly that life is meant to be better and more exciting for them, if only they could be somewhere else.  That happiness and fulfillment are there for the taking...somewhere else.  That the grass is always greener, not on the other side of the fence, but on the other side of the globe.

DiCaprio gives a fine performance (not great) as a man who has somewhat resigned himself to a life of mostly drudgery, with only occasional bursts of joy.  He still looks like a kid, and middle-class gravitas does fit him easily.  But his performance is sincere.  Winslet, big surprise, is incandescent.  She is a character who is easy to dislike, and doesn't care.  She's selfish, vibrant, intelligent and angry.  Unfortunately, sometimes her dialogue in particular (DiCaprio's too) is SO stagey that even with her talent, she doesn't always come across as flesh-and-blood.  These characters scream EVERYTHING at each other...the writer just didn't believe in letting anything roil under the surface...it all needed to spew out.  So while the fight scenes are great in a way...they also feel like scenes, and not snippets of real lives.

There is a wild, crazy exception to all this fussiness.  You've probably seen that Michael Shannon (excellent in BUGS, among other solid roles) was nominated for an Oscar for his role here.  He plays the son of a Winslet & DiCaprio's real estate agent.  He's a mathematician who is mostly confined to an asylum.  Mom brings him round to meet the ""nice young couple"" for lunch, and he is immediately wise to them.  He sees their unhappiness and he articulates it to them.  In his first appearance, his honesty is seen as refreshing to the couple...and affirmation that they are RIGHT about their plans.  Yet later, when things have ceased going so well, he spends another meal with them...eviscerating both of them as neatly as a surgeon might excise a mole.  His character is difficult to believe on an academic level...yet Shannon brings an unexpected zest to his character.  He's a fussy kind of man (just as the movie is fussy), but he's unfettered by propriety, eager to make everyone around him uncomfortable by bring out the truth.  While it does feel like a device to explain to the audience what we already sort of know...Shannon is riveting nonetheless...he literally steals the show from his far better known co-stars.

It's no surprise that REVOLUTIONARY ROAD ultimately was almost excluded from Oscar contention.  It's just a little too carefully crafted and full of itself to entirely work.  Yet is it still a fascinating character study, and a movie journey worth taking.  It actually does have some surprises up its sleeve.",1234224000,4,7505,4.798594847775176
3165441,4,B0016Q2D66,"I suspect that many people watching ""Revolutionary Road"" will expect to see some sort of romantic comedy.  Put Leonardo DiCaprio together with Kate Winslet and would it not be reasonable to expect something romantic?  Nothing could be further from the truth.  ""Revolutionary Road"" is often confronting.  It deals with tough themes within an unsettled marriage.  It is anything but romantic.

Based on the novel by Richard Yates, ""Revolutionary Road"" is set in 1950s Connecticut.  Frank Wheeler (DiCaprio) is a young company man trying to make a way ahead for his wife and two kids.  He works for the same company that previously employed his father in New York.  He is bored.  However, his wife, April (Winslet) is beyond boredom.  She is quite depressed and hates her lifestyle.  This is unfortunate as her lifestyle would be the envy of so many people.  The family is well off and there are two happy children.

It is the interaction of husband and wife that forms the basis of the film.  At times, this can be extremely discomforting to the viewer.  Yet it always seems plausible.  The characters have cred.  The film's ending is also traumatic.  Don't go looking for a happy reconciliation between husband and wife.

Notwithstanding the film's troubling theme, ""Revolutionary Road"" is worth the effort.  The viewer is rewarded with a gritty insight to a dysfunctional family.  Both DiCaprio and Winslet are excellent in their roles.",1234051200,2,1436,5.0212765957446805

So worth the effort? Absolutely, for two reasons. Firstly, the acting is brilliant - Kate Winslet, quite rightly, wins huge praise for her portrayal of the frustrated and tormented wife but in many ways it's Leonardo DiCaprio who has the more difficult role as the confused husband and, despite unfair criticisms about his ""boyish looks"", he carries it off convincingly and equally superbly. Together, they're incredible - so good that they become wholly believable people trapped in a wholly believable marriage.

And, secondly, despite the fairly one-dimensional story and the effort of watching it slowly unfold to a fairly predictable conclusion, this is powerful stuff: couples argue like this, lovers hurt each other like this, people destroy each other's dreams like this, and real life is like this... so much so that it's at times deeply uncomfortable viewing. Not much fun then but after getting through it all you won't forget it in a hurry and, on the way, you'll witness some of the best acting you've ever seen.",1233964800,,1329,5.063926940639269
3165443,5,B0016Q2D66,"""I can't leave and I can't stay. I'm no good to anyone."" -April Wheeler

April and Frank Wheeler (Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio) live in Conneticut with their two children. April is discontent and convinces Frank that he might be too. April suggests they sell up and move to Paris. Frank agrees until he gets a promotion at work and April gets pregnant. Frank decides he's hit his stride in life. He changes the narrative behind his story. He gets interested in selling computers. He tells April ""People in Paris can't be the only ones living interesting lives. We can be happy here."" Most of all Frank wants his wife to be happy, but April refuses to join him in his contentment and continues to dwell on the idea that life is passing her by.

I thought I would really like this movie. I'm a lot like April. On my worst days there is very little that keeps me from running to the airport. Thankfully I married a sweet guy that accepts my occasionally itchy feet-which is what I kept wondering about April. If she wanted to go to Paris so bad, why not just go for a while by herself and then use the experience to bring a new perspective to her existence? Couples don't need to be together every single moment and even the most free spirted of people need a home. Instead April chooses to destroy herself and her husband when there are so many other viable alternatives. It was hard for me to empathize with a character that couldn't laugh, took every moment of her life and herself way too seriously, and couldn't appreciate the love and dedication Frank directed towards her happiness. Though I saw a bit of myself in April, I despised her lack of courage.

The most interesting thing about this movie is that April is playing the ""male"" role. Men always think that women want to ""trap"" them into the nest. Revolutionary Road aptly demonstrates the other side-it's Frank that wants to ""talk about it"" and April just wants him to shut up. Frank wants to stay at home and April wants to travel.

Important to the narrative of Revolutionary Road is Paris and it's ability to provide Americans with a worthwhile existence. Don't get me wrong. I love Paris. But I had a Parisian boyfriend once and he and his friends always laughed about the American fascination with France-a year in Provence, the black berets! Yes, France is good. But where ever you go, there you are. If you're unhappy at home, you'll probably be unhappy in France too. You get the feeling that this is true for April, which is why she chooses her sad ending. April wouldn't have been happy in Paris, she wouldn't have been happy anywhere. At the end of the movie Frank says to his friend ""She did it to herself."" Frank is talking about something else in the scene (I don't want to give it away) but it's an apt metaphor for April's life.

I'm giving this movie five stars because of the good performances, originality of ideas, and the fact that no matter how much you end up liking or hating this film, it's going to get you thinking. And if it all leaves you too sad-if you see too much of yourself or your relationship in this film, remember that there are other ways to solve ennui without destroying yourself, your family, or your spouse and those resolutions don't have to involve electroshock therapy, the mental health system, extra marital affairs, booze, cigarettes and Paris. It's hardly all ""empty hopelessness"" as the characters in this film would have you believe. There's plenty to be happy and laugh about no matter where you are.

3165444,1,B0016Q2D66,"Oh geez, this movie is just unbearably depressing.  It shrieks right through your soul, like watching a live cat getting slowly disemboweled.  After the first 30 minutes of this movie, I wanted both of the main characters to die; after 45 minutes, I got up and left.

The fault is the source material for this movie, the book ""Revolutionary Road"".  The fault is not with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, who are wonderful actors, and do a fine job here, as always.  Another reviewer mentioned something about bad dialogue and stiff acting.  I think that this is only because the screenplay is based on a book published in 1961, and the movie is definitely a period piece trying to re-create the mood and style of that era.  So the story and pacing and acting and dialogue is much more like ""Mad Men"" (which I love) than your basic modern breakup/dysfunctional family movie.

""Mad Men"" too has a lot of characters with dysfunctional marriages, but is enjoyable because of the depth and loving complexity in which the characters are presented.  In ""Revolutionary Road"",  the two main characters are so thoroughly vapid and unlikeable, so completely into their own wants and neuroses that one immediately wonders why they bothered to get married and have children in the first place (oh, right, it was the thing to do back then, and there was no birth control pill yet).  And then one realizes that they probably deserved each other, but the kids (who are just props in this story), certainly did not deserve them.

The closest movie that I've seen which makes you squirm in your seat like ""Revolutionary Road"" would be ""The Squid and the Whale"", which had an equally unlikeable, vapid and self-centered husband and wife pair going through a divorce.  Except that ""Squid and the Whale"" was told from the point of view of the two children, who had to suffer through their parents' self-centered, narcissistic behavior, and of course, as a modern movie story, the wife was empowered to abandon the kids and just flee for her own career instead of agonizing about her failures and sticking her head in an oven (that's how the book ends, I never made it to the end of ""Revolutionary Road"", the movie).

And so that was ultimately why I gave ""Squid and the Whale"" a four star rating - because it had a lot to say about why people should get married - the purpose of marriage is simply to have children, and to protect them, and that requires that the mother and father sacrifice a good chunk of their lives to the kids and refrain from engaging in family-destructive behaviors.  Marriage simply codifies the boundaries of such a relationship.  If a couple cannot live with these boundaries and just want to get together and share a life and have sex, they don't have to get married and in my book they shouldn't.  They definitely shouldn't have kids.

""Revolutionary Road"" deserves only one star, because in spite of the fine period style acting by DeCaprio and Winslet, ultimately the movie utterly fails to entertain or to educate or to do anything other than to torture one's soul as we watch these two fine actors tear into each other.  And the fault lies in Richard Yates's novel, which failed to understand or even to examine the true nature of the dysfunctional marriage of the Wheelers.

Richard Yates intended his novel to be a diatribe against the conformity of the 1950s and 1960s, this tendency to give up the ""revolutionary spirit"", and so blamed the problems of the Wheeler marriage on just that one facet of things.  But we have since seen ample proof that more important factors are involved - completely flipping the social norms of the 1950s around, as we have done since, has not decreased the numbers of seriously unhappy marriages and dysfunctional families, nor stopped suicides and divorces.  No, there is far more at stake here than what is presented in this vapid and very depressing movie.",1233446400,22,3910,4.752958579881657
3165445,3,B0016Q2D66,"Revolutionary Road, set in 1950s suburbia, is the latest movie to deal with the disenchantment that sets in when life fails to meet expectations.

April (Kate Winslet), an acting student and Greenwich Village-dwelling bohemian, falls in love with Frank Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio), and soon finds herself living the life of a suburban housewife and mother. April sees herself as a victim of suburban homogeneity and mediocrity, and longs for more than the ordinary life she shares with Frank. The reality, though, is that April lacks the gifts needed to have an extraordinary life. Her one true talent seems to be making other people miserable.

I found this movie hard to watch. At times the movie is as airless as the suburb it portrays. The nasty fights between the Wheelers become wearying, and there is nothing particularly fresh or original in this portrayal of a marriage gone wrong.  There's a predictability in the downfall of the Wheelers; it's clear from the start of this movie that no one will find any measure of happiness. All that's left for the viewer to do is to guess how exactly the unhappiness will unfold.

For some reason, I found myself unmoved by April's unhappiness, and I'm not sure if this is the fault of the script or of Winslet's performance. April's despair seems a bit overwrought. Part of this may have to do with the fact that the Wheelers are not exactly stranded in the hinterlands. They live within commuting distance of one of the great cities of the world and yet their social lives seem to revolve entirely around suburban locales.  Manhattan is only seen as a place where mind numbing work is done.

Leonardo DiCaprio does a fine job portraying the self-doubting Frank, but it's the supporting actors who are most memorable in this film. Many people are raving about Michael Shannon's performance as a mentally ill mathematician, but I also enjoyed Kathy Bates' nuanced portrayal of a busybody real estate agent.

I also enjoyed the final scene, which injects a bit of dry humor into what has been an increasingly grim affair.",1233446400,28,2068,4.8746438746438745
3165446,4,B0016Q2D66,"Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet played star-crossed lovers whose love and dreams made anything possible in Titanic.  Revolutionary Road is the antithesis of that film.  DiCaprio and Winslet are once again a couple, but here they struggle to find meaning in their comfortable lives and wind up turning their frustration and rage against each other.  But it's not their fault.  The film portrays conformist 1950's suburbia as the villain...

Frank and April Wheeler (DiCaprio and Winslet) seem to be the perfect couple.  Young, smart, attractive and up-and-coming, they appear to be living the American dream.  They have two beautiful children and an idyllic house in the suburbs.  But they are both desperately unhappy.  Why?  Because they feel they are living meaningless lives in a soul-less society.

The filmmakers seem to believe so as well, portraying mid-1950's suburbia as a kind of Stepford, CN, populated by zombies.  In contrast, Frank and April seem to be the only real people.  They have feelings and try to talk through their differences, whereas all the other characters are presented as one-dimensional morons.

So when April comes up with a plan to ditch their unfulfilling lives and move the family to Paris, we root for them.  It seems the answer to their problems.  Indeed, both Frank and April come alive with the plan.  They become happy with their lives and each other as they make preparations to drop out of the ""normal"" lives that everyone else seems to be sleepwalking through.

Alas, breaking free is not that easy.  Events conspire to make their exit more difficult.  Frank and April struggle with each other as they struggle with their fate and future.  The story builds to a melodramatic climax.  Don't expect a happy ending.

Revolutionary Road has gotten near universal accolades, and it is compelling to watch, but I felt sold short by it.  This could have been an intelligent drama about two perceptive young people coming to terms with each other and the responsibilities and disappointments of adulthood in an imperfect world.  Instead, it turns into a potboiler, a platform for DiCaprio and Winslet to overact, as if they were in a Tennessee Williams play.

This is the kind of film Hollywood makes when it wants to showcase middle class suburban life as empty and vapid.  It's Sam Mendes' 1950's version of his earlier film American Beauty. The message here is that those ""happy days"" of the 1950's were really an illusion.  Scratch the surface and not far below, you'll find deeply unhappy people living lives of quiet desperation.  To drive home the point, one of the characters who comes into the Wheeler's home is the grown son of one of their neighbors, a man who is on furlough from a psychiatric hospital.  He preaches eloquently about the emptiness and hopelessness of their lives, and encourages the Wheelers to escape while they can.  He is portrayed sympathetically, as sane and wise, as if he is in a mental hospital because the world around him is crazy.  It's a simplistic and romantic view;  I just didn't buy it.

I thought the Wheeler's problems and angst had more to do with their own character flaws than the world around them.  But the film prefers to  be an indictment of suburban life in the 1950's, with the Wheelers portrayed as hapless victims of their ""hopeless, empty"" environment.  At one point in the film, Frank implores his wife, ""We don't have to go to Paris to be happy, we can be happy here.""  It's the most intelligent line in the film.  Too bad the film didn't believe it.",1233446400,,3549,4.861435726210351
3165447,5,B0016Q2D66,"That would be my take on it.  I found this movie, first of all, watchable.  It made me ask questions as I watched, questions about what it means 'to be someone', what it is she actually hoped to be, and how she thought moving to Paris would help her realize that.  The desire to 'come alive' is often achieved through travel or a drastic change of some kind and I can fully understand wanting to escape the suburbs and the hometown - so on one level I could relate. Not to mention that divorce and abortion were were both taboo in the 50s (when the movie seems to be taking place). It becomes a chessboard of tangled issues developing and playing against each other as the story progresses.

DiCaprio and Winslett did a good job acting in this as well and their dialogues pulled me in.  DiCaprio is sometimes hit and miss for me.  I liked him in ""Catch Me If You Can"", another 50's piece, and in this one I also found him more or less sympathetic (and fairly believable).  The character of the insane/truth-telling son of the housing agent was an added plus and helped really bring out the issues in the film.  It ended nicely too I thought and left me pensive.  I don't think this movie is simply about agreeing or disagreeing with the course the characters take (although that is inevitable) but rather seeing the very familiar attitudes and needs which spurn them on on their way.  The extremity to which she takes things is what makes you really think about it and (probably) come to your own more healthy conclusions.",1233100800,,1522,4.481884057971015
3165448,3,B0016Q2D66,"Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. April (Kate Winslet) marries Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio), has two kids and lives on Revolutionary Road
2. April's unhappy
3. Frank's unhappy
4. April and Frank make me unhappy
5. They dream of Paris in the springtime which is supposed to be the winter of their discontent
6. Summer lovin' changes lots of things
7. It takes a patient of a mental institution to wake them up, and the audience with them
8. It seems they were never special or destined for anything at all

Yeah, I know - it's a drama - but one would have hoped for a little more life, or at least believability in this drawn out saga about unhappy people behaving badly.  DiCaprio is terribly miscast for this role, his baby-faced good looks making him appear far too young, bright eyed and bushy tailed to be a middle aged man with the world on his shoulders.

Winslet, on the other hand, is perfectly cast, and totally aces her part.  Unfortunately, the character is too unlikeable, and draws little or no sympathy from the audience.

Supporting roles are played by Kathy Bates, Richard Easton and Michael Shannon as a dysfunctional family group, and by Kathryn Hahn and David Harbour as a friendly couple.

Far from being King of the World, this monotonous melodrama posing as a Titanic reunion should have gone down with the ship.  Points are given for the acting, the sets and the costumes, with a bonus for Winslet, who gives the only performance worth the ticket price.

3165449,4,B0016Q2D66,"""That's it?  I'm Picking the Movie Next Time..."", said a woman three rows behind me, rather loudly, as the credits began to roll.  I think that if, instead, it had gone 5 minutes longer and ended with a tear-flowing, apology-laden embrace...that she would have been satisfied.  She missed the entire point of the film...probably on purpose.

I came into the movie expecting it to be a warning to all those thinking about marriage.  Basically, the main characters are stuck.  Stuck together.  They've got the house, the kids, the car, the white picket fence.  But then what?  They aren't happy.  They try to think of a way to escape...but both of them know it wouldn't work.  There is no way for them to be happy together.  There is a ""crazy guy"" in the movie, fresh out of the psych-ward who acts as the voice of truth.  Of blunt truth.  He's the only truthful character in the movie.  Everyone else lies to themselves and plays the ""happy suburbia"" game.

I know people like this.  They married young under societal and family pressures.  Got their car.  Got their house.  Got their kids.  Got their white picket fence.  But...they aren't happy.  They're stuck.  Can't change careers.  Can't go back to school to pursue something interesting to their soul.

Not one single character in the movie is happy.  Actually the thing that seems to scare the characters most is the possibility of seeing someone else achieve the happiness they cannot.  As long as everyone is ""in this together"" (misery loves company), then they won't have to feel bad about themselves.

A lot of people will see this movie and distance themselves from it, just like the characters in the movie did with the main couple:  ""Gee, what's wrong with them?  Why do they choose to be depressed?  Why can't they just be happy?  They've got food in their bellies and a place to live.  I'm glad I'll never/didn't end up like them.""  This kind of person is doomed to end up like these characters.  The money, the kids, the possessions...these things don't make a person happy.  The main characters compromised themselves, compromised their dreams and ambitions in order to have these things.  And it destroyed them.

I think it speaks volumes that when the crazy character speaks...the audience roars in laughter.  But he's just speaking the honest truth, brutally blunt as he is.  It shouldn't be funny.  It shouldn't be strange.  It's ironic that if his character wasn't crazy, and still said these things, that it probably wouldn't be accepted by the audience as a plausible character.  We're all so used to lying to ourselves and others that seeing someone speak blunt truth is uncomfortable, and wildly outside of normal societal conventions.  So we laugh to release the tension.

I have friends and family that are destroying themselves in different ways.  Gambling.  Obesity.  Infidelity.  Not seeking medical attention when they obviously should.  Others not taking their medication.  It would be great if this crazy character could visit these people for me and speak the truth.  Maybe wake them up.  Help save them...before it's too late.  And I would like to be that character for them.  But it wouldn't help.  As the crazy character in the movie states:  ""Emptiness and Hopelessness"" is what they're stuck in.  And any attempt I could make to shake them out of that would be met with the same violent rage and indignation as DiCaprio's character in the film.  If I tried anything I would become an unwelcome pariah.  Realistically there is nothing I can do.

This movie re-enforced what I've always felt.  Whether you're happy or not is your own damn fault and no one else's; a lesson that very few people ever learn.  You need to do whatever makes you happy.  Chase that.  Live that.  Never compromise that for anyone or any reason.  Period.  The second you stop living for yourself is the second you stop living, and start destroying yourself.  But introspection, ""knowledge of self"", is the most important thing you need to be truly happy; to stop lying to yourself and see the truth clearly.

This movie would be good companion viewing with ""It's a Wonderful Life"".  It's like the anti-Capra film.  Jimmy Stewart's George Bailey did everything we're told to do.  Everything all our lives we're told is right.  Everything that should give a man true happiness.  He sacrifices his dream (see the world, etc.), in order to serve his family and community by working for the family business in a job he hates and resents.  The sad truth is, the real-life townsfolk of Bedford Falls would have been indifferent to George's situation (reacted as Potter expected them to), and the real-life George Bailey would have ended up at the bottom of that river.

Nevertheless, I think I might make both of these films a yearly viewing ritual, to make sure I've got my life priorities in order.  To make sure I'm not lying to myself.  To make sure I'm not lying to others for my own benefit or to their detriment.  To make sure I'm not living my life to live up to the same pipe-dream (i.e. ""American dream"") lies.

The arguments feel real. The crazy-guy character/jester may seem to get close to the bone, but the story doesn't relieve the tension.

We saw the movie at the cinema last night. The tension took such an unresolved turn near the end, that a young lady a few rows in front of us fainted. Perhaps she had experienced the movies climax a little too intensely in her own life.",1232755200,,630,4.709090909090909
3165451,4,B0016Q2D66,"Frank Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his wife April (Kate Winslet) are a suburban couple who appear to be living the ""American Dream"". But instead they feel trapped by the boredom, conformity and mediocre that surrounds them. April, herself a frustrated actress, suggests that Frank quit his job and move the family to Paris, where they can escape the ""hopeless emptiness"" and find to a way to feel ""alive"" again. Frank is receptive to the idea at first. But a job promotion and April's unexpected pregnancy cause Frank to re-evaluate their plans. April remains dedicated to leaving and their marriage descends into tragedy.

It's been a long time since I've seen a movie I was this conflicted about. From a critical perspective this is a great film. The acting is brillant, the 50's era set designs are terrific and, just like in ""American Beauty"", Sam Mendes is a director who's not afraid to take chances and ask big questions. On the other hand, Frank and April are both so narcissistic it is sometimes hard to feel empathy for their plight.

Also this film may be the victim of bad timing, as the current economic downturn has most people more concerned with trying to maintain their small slice of the ""American Dream"" rather than raging against it. Still I admire the movie's artistic ambition and willingness to confront the ""hopeless emptiness"" we all feel sometimes. But instead of moving to Paris I recommend that folks try to ""bloom where you're planted"" and search for happiness from within.",1232150400,,1505,4.898039215686275
3165452,4,B0016Q2D66,"This is a cinematic poem about what the archetypical ""middle-class white American suburban life"" can do to ones marriage, life and ultimately to ones own humanity: What it does is simply cut life and humanity off at its emotional knees, inevitably turning the faade of order and tranquility into downward cycles of despair, and eventually into self-hatred and barely containable underlying currents of violence: The collective neurotic American emotional condition.

Directed by Sam Mendes the screenplay is characterized by, and dominated by, subtle clashes of many ""mini-moral"" sub-themes - the lost of freedom, having to work in jobs that are hated, having kids too early, unplanned pregnancies, affairs with neighbors and colleagues, the desire, but not the will to run away from it all, and then of course, the 800 pound gorilla in the back of the room, abortion.

At the bottom of all of this is the self-made trap of emptiness and hopelessness that middle-class suburban life of the 1950s represented. Unwittingly, the Wheelers have traded in their freedom for conformity and the always limited but illusory security that middle class suburban life offers. April is the stronger of the two, and thus experiences the growing despair at a higher and much more intense level. And although interesting in its interplay of subthemes, the story, otherwise has a kind of ""vanilla"" flavor to it. In retrospect, it seemed thin in the extreme.

The talents of both actors appear to be much too high-powered for the emotional level of this vehicle. The script should have been reserved for those fresh out of acting school. After ""The Reader,"" Kate has set the bar for her own acting so high, that there are unlikely to be many more roles that can truly test the outer ranges of her abilities. She has raised her game to the level that she now has the ultimate actors dilemma: her enormous talents have already out-paced the best screenplays available in Hollywood. And, as was the case for most of this movie, she will increasingly be left on the set unchallenged with nothing much to do.

Leonardo DiCaprio, still in my estimation, the most under-rated actor in Hollywood, has an entirely different set of problems. His role in this movie just confirms further the Chameleon-like nature of this actor and his acting abilities. That he has such ability is both a virtue and a curse. It is a virtue because it keeps his acting always fresh and alive. He is like a random variable. One does not know when or where he is going to show up in his role; and that is unbelievably exciting. But wherever and whenever he shows up, he will not just ""inhabit the role, he will take it over and ""possess"" it.

The curse however is that chameleons tend not to become truly great actors because defining who they are gets lost in their catlike abilities to switch from one persona to another -- without leaving even a trace of their own humanity behind the actor's mask they wear. Indeed, I understand that this is the very essence of great acting. Yet, by the calculus of the ""movie Gods,"" four ""near great movies"" will never add up to ""one great movie."" If you don't believe it, just ask Samuel L. Jackson.

And while I would argue that DiCaprio's acting is a slight cut above Jackson's, they both suffer the same dilemma: It is difficult to locate and center their humanity in their roles. In this movie, as in Blood Diamonds, DiCaprio did indeed get to flex his ""chops."" He is a thrilling actor, but who the hell is he?

3165456,4,B0016Q2D66,"There are really two versions of the 1950's. There's the pop culture 1950's (ie Leave it to Beaver and Father Knows Best) that celebrate American norms and conventions and the high culture 1950's (Salinger's Catcher in the Rye and Ginsberg's Howl but also Jazz and abstract expressionism) that find American norms and conventions to be both phony and oppressive.  In Yates' Revolutionary Road both the low and the high culture versions of the decade are present but the Wheelers (Kate Winslet's ""April"" and Leonardo DiCaprio's ""Frank"") cannot decide which version they want to subscribe to. When they first meet they are each seduced by the other's contempt for mainstream corporate America and they both dream of escaping its safe but uninspiring clutches even though neither of them can imagine a viable alternative. Once they marry and start a family, however, Frank Wheeler finds himself working for the corporate America that he claims to detest and this is perceived by wife April as a betrayal of his true calling and their oppositional bond. But Frank is a divided creature. He suspects that he doesn't have any real talent (for transforming himself or the world) and that life is most tolerable/enjoyable when one does not ask too much of oneself. Because of his willingness to live within the status quo instead of outside of it problems arise between Frank and April because according to April Frank is no longer the man that she fell in love with. But April also has inner conflicts of her own and is an equally divided creature. Although early on it appears that aspiring actress April accepts the fact that she has no real talent and willingly assumes the role of wife and mother, the artist in her never stops aspiring. The relationship initially fueled by shared aspirations becomes one of mutual disappointment. Early on Frank and April dream of living in Paris but only Frank is willing to let that dream die. Long after the middle-aged Frank himself has discarded it Paris remains for April a symbol of the independent life that she wants but that is, in 1950's America, unavailable to a woman.

Realists will sympathize with Leonardo DiCaprio's handsome and eternally boyish but underconfident Frank. Frank increasingly loses faith in his ability to accomplish anything in the arts and instead uses his ""talent"" with words to sell products. DiCaprio does an excellent job at showing how easily and seamlessly Frank slips out of one world (an artsy gathering where talk is life) and into another (where talk is a commodity).

Social discontents will sympathize with Kate Winslet's beautiful but tragically conflicted and unfulfilled April. She is a woman who very much wants to be married to an artist (a liberator) but who finds herself married to a corporate player (and corporate culture with its masculinist and chauvinist social rituals tends to cultivate in its members a sense of male superiority and material well being as the only measure of success).

Neither Frank nor April possess any measurable artistic genius but there is genius in DiCaprio's and Winslet's portrayal of Frank and April.  Because April refuses to abandon her dreams her life is more difficult than Frank's and the role of April is more demanding to play. Winslet must hit many notes in this performance and she hits them all with consummate perfection. April is sometimes quietly desperate and sometimes not so quietly desperate, she ranges from rebellious and unruly captive to dutiful housewife and Winslet captures each nuance of this character's ongoing struggle for self-definition brilliantly. Winslet does the impossible, she makes each gradation of this complex character readable. Ultimately, April is the rebel/artist that she wishes her husband were but in order to fulfill her function as housewife she must stand by dutifully as he becomes more and more settled into the bourgoisie existence that she finds so stifling. Winslet captures April's seething and subversive spirit and her mounting frustration perfectly. Winslet completely inhabits this character's every thought. Because of Winslet we can feel April's wildness, her need to resist, and her growing desperation and sense of futility. Its a heartwrenching performance.

But DiCaprio's performance as Frank is almost as good. Frank is a restless man who at first resists the mainstreaming ethos of American corporate culture (which is at this time a boy's club) but finds the perks are just too hard to resist. He's like Pacino in the Godfather. He wants out but it just keeps pulling him back in. Because he fails to break free from the corporate machine and assert his own identity he remains conflicted over whether he really is a man or not. The corporate world promises wealth and the ""freedom"" to travel but at what cost to oneself? Frank is the American tragedy. He chooses a well-paying occupation and affluent life over an interesting one.

Another of this films many virtues is the insight it offers into the way males and females victimize each other to momentarily empower and/or escape themselves.

Whether Yates' novel is proto-feminist or not, Mendes' adpatation certainly is that. In 1961 (the year the novel was written) the revolution that would thaw the stifling conformist cold war male-centric 1950's for good was coming but it wasn't there yet.

Honorable mentions must also go to supporting players Kathy Bates and Michael Shannon as Helen Givings and her ""insane"" son John. These two represent the two sides of the decade perfectly and they provide comic relief of the most unusual sort. Bates is excellent as a good-intentioned but meddling realtor who keeps showing up at the worst possible moments. She keeps lifes troubles at bay by placing her own cheerfully palliative spin on each sign of discontent. Her son John mocks her attempts to put a sunny face on everything and he mocks everyone else's attempts to find comfort in a world that he views as hopeless. John's impromptu diagnoses of other people's problems are blunt and brutal and merciless but they are also a welcome relief (in a strange kind of way) since he actually brings out into the open what everyone else tries to suppress from view. This character's bleak world view provides the perfect high cultural counterpoint (no other era witnessed the early death or decline into madness of so many of its high cultural stars: Jackson Pollock, Delmore Schwarz, John Berryman, Sylvia Plath...) to the compulsory optimism of the pop-culture-crazy 1950's.

Be warned, the film's overall vision is exceptionally bleak, but individual performances allow us to see and transcend the limits of both versions of the 1950's even if the characters themselves cannot.",1231459200,7,6720,5.084315503173164
3165457,1,B0016Q2D66,"I really hate ""Revolutionary Road"", the new film starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet and directed by Winslet's husband, Sam Mendes (""American Beauty"", ""The Road to Perdition"").

After a very brief scene showing Frank and April (DiCaprio and Winslet) meeting at a party in New York City, circa the late 40s or early 50s, the film flashes forward almost a decade and we watch as Frank and April fight about how unhappy they are living in the suburbs. April is going stir crazy spending her days in the suburbs, taking the garbage out, and Frank commutes to New York City to work in a cubicle writing sales materials for the Knox Corporation. It's Frank's 30th birthday and his entire world is crushing in on him. When he returns home, April and the two kids sing ""Happy Birthday"" and give him a cake, complete with lit candles. But Frank is still unhappy. April suddenly comes up with an idea. They will uproot the family and move to Paris, the only place Frank has ever felt 'alive'. She will get a job and Frank can study and read and decide what it is he wants to do with his life, what it is he is good at. When they tell the neighbors, their friends, Shep and Milly (David Harbour and Kathryn Hahn), who are even more entrenched in suburbia, their plans, Shep and Milly are not encouraging.

At one point late in the film, very late, April turns to Frank and says ""Can we just not talk about anything for a little while?"" Hallelujah, sister. Maybe if they talked less during the film, there would be less fighting. Maybe we would see more of their life and the decisions that led them into this predicament. Maybe ""Revolutionary Road"" could've provided a scathing portrait of how two young people end up living in suburbia and are unable to cope with the limitations of such a life. Actually, in this film, that means they are dead and must make stupid, irrational decisions in an effort to live.

In ""Road"", practically the entire film is about Frank and April being unhappy with each other. It makes sense that so much of the film concentrates on them; Leo and Kate are the stars and they appeared together in the number #1 money-making film of all time. I will never understand why filmmakers think it is a good idea to put two people the public love so much in a film in which all they do is fight? It just makes the entire film uncomfortable to watch and leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Exactly what every filmmaker should be striving for. The only way to make this type of story work is to show us events leading up to these arguments, to provide some sort of counterpoint, to give us a flavor of why they fell in love in the first place. Strangely, these films almost never seem to do this, skipping directly to the fighting and the fireworks.

So it is even more perplexing when director Mendes shifts away from the action and gives us an interlude with Shep and Milly, or introduces a busybody realtor played by Kathy Bates and her mentally ill adult son played by Michael Shannon. These moments pull us away from the main story, which means we are pulled away from the constant fighting and self-loathing, which isn't a bad thing. But as a filmmaker, Mendes should not be introducing these elements unless they help to move the story forward. Concentrate on Frank and April. They are the reason we paid $12 in the first place. The scenes with Kathy Bates and Michael Shannon are particularly egregious and stick out like a sore thumb. Did Mendes really believe these characters were realistic? I get the purpose of Shannon's character, but it is always a tricky thing to introduce a mentally ill character. It is difficult to make them believable. And in ""Road"", Shannon isn't believable. He is as theatrical as April wants to be in her nascent acting career.

When I initially saw the trailer for this film, I suggested it to my mother as a possible Christmas Day film. She immediately nixed it. ""Oh, no. When I saw that trailer Aunt Kathy and I laughed and thought they were play acting"". In a way, she isn't far from the truth. Leo's Frank Wheeler turns 30 at the beginning of the film. This prompts him to have a mid-life crisis, have an affair, loathe the sight of his wife and family, etc. Kate's April would be about the same age. This young couple is apparently very self-aware of their problems to be so unhappy at 30. Especially when neither demonstrates a real calling for some great life as an artist, writer, dancer, and the like. Generally, people experience their mid-life crisis at least a decade later. Good for them. Maybe when they grow up they'll be able to live a happy life.

Or maybe not.

Early on, Frank watches April performing in a play that appears to be put on by a local community theater. It doesn't go well and Frank tries to say a few encouraging words, But April is just as aware that it didn't go well and they fight during the drive home. Unfortunately, the entire film seems like kids play acting the roles their parents should be playing. DiCaprio still has amazing boyish good looks, despite a few more wrinkles, and just seems miscast as a 30 year old experiencing a midlife crisis. It doesn't help that many of their arguments devolve into each of the characters throwing multi-syllable words at each other that just don't seem natural. It makes them sound like they are regurgitating bad Freud they learned in a college course they recently completed. Worse, it makes them seem like they are spouting over written, stagy dialogue. I just never bought DiCaprio as a defeated businessman and father. In a couple of scenes, he has lunch with a few co-workers, one of whom is played by well-known character actor Dylan Baker. Baker is 15 years older than DiCaprio. I buy HIM as a disenchanted, middle aged man experiencing a mid-life crisis. DiCaprio is simply too young. Winslet fares better, but she also tends to start yelling at Frank, using words that just don't flow naturally and seem stagy and over-written, making her character seem like a little kid playing a grown up role.

There are many, many scenes in which Frank, April, their friends and his co-workers are pictured smoking and drinking. This also seems to make both DiCaprio and Winslet seem younger than they actually are. They are acting like college kids away from home for the first time. Scotch, Bourbon, Whiskey, Gin, Rye, Beer, Wine, Cocktails? Sure. Let's try them all. Could be fun.

""Revolutionary Road"" is a trial to sit through. Wait until it comes out on DVD and rent ""The Break-Up"" to go with it. The perfect double bill. Just make sure you're stocked up on the anti-depressants before hitting PLAY.",1231027200,21,6641,4.6069315300084535
3399028,5,B0016Q2D66,"Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio costar in ""Revolutionary Road"" as April and Frank Wheeler, a typical suburban couple living a typical domestic life in 1955 suburbia. To outsiders, it appears that the Wheelers have it all: a lovely house, two beautiful children, a steady income, etc. The truth of the matter is, both April and Frank are absolutely miserable. Frank is stuck in the same stupid job his father had before him, and he doesn't think April appreciates all his hard work, which causes him to seek comfort outside his marriage in the arms of one of his floozy secretaries. Meanwhile, April is bored out of her mind with being a mother and a housewife. Desperate for a change of pace, she proposes to Frank that they pack up their kids and move to Paris in order to turn their boring lives into an adventure. At first Frank is all for the idea, until he's offered a big promotion at work. Unfortunately, the change of plans doesn't sit well with April, and the Wheelers soon find their lives headed on a downward spiral of self-destruction,

""Revolutionary Road"" is based on the novel by Richard Yates, and it is an extremely good adaptation of the book. Winslet and DiCaprio both deliver the best performances of their careers so far, definitely deserving of Oscar nominations. The film is incredibly depressing but brilliantly well-done. It illustrates the importance of following your dreams before it's too late. (Also, in my opinion, it's a wonderful pro-choice film...you will see why during the last 15 minutes.) This is definitely one of the best films I've seen in a long time, and I highly recommend it.",1230940800,,1624,4.82078853046595
3399029,5,B0016Q2D66,"A lot of people who see this film will probably think of that line from ""Walden"" by Thoreau: ""The mass of people lead lives of quiet desperation.""  Although that line is fitting for his film, I think there was more to it than just that.  To tell you the truth, I think the main character was April Wheeler.  She reminded me of Nora in ""A Doll's House"" by Ibsen: she was fiercely independent and trapped within the confines of society during the '50s.  I think one of the reasons she was attracted to her future husband, Frank, was because of his feelings of independence and not being afraid to live life to its fullest.  But then things happen and people change.  April gets pregnant and suddenly finds herself as a Susie-homemaker somewhere out in the suburbs of Connecticut.  One moment she has dreams of becoming the next Katharine Hepburn on Broadway, and the next moment she is hosting a tea party for the ladies' auxiliary club in her living room.  She is not happy with her life.  Frank, on the other hand, is doing well in his life: he's got a wife and kids, a recent promotion that pays a bundle, and some ""afternoon delight"" on the side.  He's not as anxious or unhappy with his life.  So what do we have here?  Someone who keeps dwelling on the past (April) and someone who is looking towards the future (Frank).  It's no wonder the Wheelers are constantly at each other's throats.  What I liked about this film was its acute observation of a marriage.  How some people in a marriage learn to grow up, accept responsibility, and get on with their lives.  And how other people are fiercely independent, were never meant to get married, and never learn to get on with their lives.  I realize our society dictates that as humans, we should study hard, go to college, find a job, and get married and have kids.  But who's to say that is meant for everybody?  It may have been all right for Frank, but certainly not April.  ""Revolutionary Road"" questions the whole structure of our society and that is what I found so brilliant about it.  It was unafraid to explore these issues.",1230336000,,2086,4.509333333333333
3399030,1,B0016Q2D66,"If you ever think life can't get any worse, leave it to the movies to introduce you to characters whose despondent situations far surpass your own. Such characters thrive in Revolutionary Road, a film whose outlook reaches so far into a realm of stifling depression that the result is exhaustion. If only we could care for these people in some way, if only we could sympathize or connect, then their suffering might not have been wasted on uncaring eyes. If only.

For April (Kate Winslet) and Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) it's love at first sight, and shortly after the seemingly inescapable rut of repetition. Frank assumes the dreary day job as a businessman sleepwalking through mindless work days, womanizing the new secretaries, and purposely slacking in his duties. April is the stay-at-home mother, trapped by her responsibilities and the sinking feeling that her life isn't being lived to the fullest. As the couple plots a course to a new life in the utopian Paris, harsh realities replace desperate dreams and difficult choices steadily destroy their chances at breaking free from the sordid existence they've created.

There really isn't anything to like about Revolutionary Road. The characters are all depressing, dysfunctional and annoying - but most of all they're presented in such a way that sympathy is practically out of the question. As April spirals into insanity and Frank broils out of control, the only sensibility comes from the clinically loony John (Michael Shannon) who is so obnoxious that even his explanation of their situation is troubling. The two children, who might also be used to muster sympathy, are frequently away, further disconnecting audiences from the crumbling leads. It's as if we are supposed to despise everyone in the film, responding with nothing but negativity toward their failures and shortcomings.

The dialogue is lacking as well, making Leonardo and Kate look as amateurish as their turns in Titanic. Some may argue that they're accomplished actors in their primes and that their performances are worthy of distinction - but even the climax of the film is laughable, along with nearly every sequence in which they bicker and yell. And their arguing takes up the majority of the runtime, making this incredibly dialogue-heavy melodramatic mess all lemons and no sugar. At several points Revolutionary Road is so ridiculously funereal it's funny. It's a movie that will make audiences reevaluate the worst performances and films of the year. Maybe it will also cheer up those viewers who can give thanks that their lives are not this socially impaired - or hit too close to home for others.

3399031,5,B0016Q2D66,"It begins so innocently: A young man and a young woman glace at each other and immediately want to close the distance between them and get better acquainted. Such a moment can be found in James Cameron's ""Titanic"" early in the film, when the characters played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet first notice each other despite being separated by deck levels and social status. A very similar moment can be found at the beginning of Sam Mendes' ""Revolutionary Road,"" and interestingly, it features the same two actors. Their characters see each other for the first time at a local party, and they're separated more by life goals than by stature. As wonderful as ""Titanic"" is, it's an escapist entertainment, a sweeping, epic romantic fantasy. ""Revolutionary Road"" is smaller, subtler, and painfully real. We know this because the youthful, nave love the characters share at the start disappears by the next scene, at which point they're already married and having a terrible fight.

Based on Richard Yates' novel, ""Revolutionary Road"" is a brilliant, unflinchingly honest examination of suburban life in 1950s America, where the outward appearance of domestic happiness meant everything to the average married couple. It tells the story of a corporate employee named Frank Wheeler (DiCaprio) and his stay-at-home wife, April (Winslet), who live in a picturesque but boring Connecticut neighborhood. Despite the fact that Frank hates his job, he's content to stick with it, knowing that he's expected to provide for his family. This isn't to say that he doesn't let himself go from time to time. Early in the film, he has an affair with a young secretary. The fascinating thing is that both of them seem so casual about what they're doing; if they regret their actions, they certainly don't show it. There isn't even a spark of emotion as he leaves her in a motel bed, asserting that she was swell.

April, on the other hand, yearns for something more out of life than just living in a suburb and raising her two children. Years ago, she was an aspiring actress. Now, she's in a domestic trap as a wife and mother. On the night of Frank's thirtieth birthday, she makes a radical suggestion: They should all move to Paris in the fall. Once there, she will get a secretarial job while Frank will be allowed to figure out what he actually wants to do with his life. It takes a little convincing, but Frank agrees, and for a time, his relationship with April improves. But it isn't long before life starts getting in the way. For one thing, absolutely no one takes their plan seriously, especially their neighbors, Shep (David Harbour) and Milly Campbell (Kathryn Hahn), who seem genuinely hurt by their wanting to leave. But truth be told, there is something a little phony about the glow that surrounds Frank and April, as if the idea is more appealing than actually moving.

There's more holding them back, of course, but I won't say what. I will, however, take the time to describe a subplot featuring another ""Titanic"" alumnus, Kathy Bates. She plays Helen Givings, the realtor who sold the Wheelers their house on Revolutionary Road. Even though she doesn't have much screen time, it's surprising just how much we learn about her. On the outside, she's polite and upbeat, with a pleasant face and charming smile. On the inside, she's judgmental and, in some ways, just as desperate as April. Her son, John (Michael Shannon), has just been released from a mental hospital, and as part of his rehabilitation, he begins spending time with the Wheelers. In the same way the blind Tiresias is able to see the truth about King Oedipus, John is the only character in ""Revolutionary Road"" with a firm grasp on Frank and April. But as insightful as he is, there does come a point when the truth really hurts.

What I really loved about this movie was the meticulous attention to dialogue. Every line in this movie felt natural, going not for obvious dramatic statements but for realistic outbursts of anger, hurt, and frustration. Even the quieter moments have an intensity all their own, as when Frank sits with the secretary at a restaurant; in that pivotal scene, he expresses--probably for the first time--the disappointment he feels for turning out exactly like his father. At the same time, there's an air of epiphany in his voice, as if he realized right then and there that he was never meant to be anything more than an office worker. Writer Justin Haythe evokes powerful emotions in his screenplay, and he does so without being condescending or clich.

Of course, well-written screenplays are only half the battle--you need talented actors to make the dialogue work. DiCaprio and Winslet have such believable onscreen chemistry, especially as their characters descend into a seemingly never-ending cycle of shouting matches. They fight so well, as if they were an actual married couple. After having eleven years to mature as performers, they may in fact be better than they were in ""Titanic."" One wonders what would have happened had the ship made it to America and Jack and Rose had gotten off together. Would the fairy-tale romance eventually end? Would they grow up to be as unfulfilled as Frank and April Wheeler? ""Revolutionary Road"" is such an amazing film, superbly cast, expertly plotted, and emotionally compelling, a sobering reminder that what we want doesn't always coincide with what we get. Even the crme de la crme of 2008--like ""Changeling,"" ""Gran Torino,"" and ""Frost/Nixon""--are not as good as this film is.",1229904000,3,5529,4.909090909090909

Instead of choosing, love, passion, adventure and new beginnings we choose status, big houses, meaningless objects, and repetition because we believe those things will make us happy. We believe the opinions of others are held at a higher value then the opinion we have of ourselves.

But, suddenly, anger and despondency take over the movie. Too many flashbacks explain the supposed deterioration of the marriage which appears to result from Aprils inability to communicate (which explains why she never made it as an actress). Every time Frank tries to talk to her about her feelings, she shuts him down and insults him so its no wonder she feels suffocated! Their kids disappear halfway through the movie for no apparent reason. Frank unexpectedly gets his big break at his humdrum Manhattan company, effectively shutting down any plans of moving to Paris. Multiple screaming matches basically make up the bulk of the last hour. April decides to abort her 3rd child and commit suicide at the same time to escape her terribly comfortable life.

But if you would like to contemplate how well we actually know the partners we spend our lives with, consider what truly brings and keeps us together, witness the immense differences that have occurred in American society over the last six decades as well as the fundamental truths about being human that are never changing, this is the movie for you.

3399095,5,B0016Q2D66,"I truly love this movie. It's a passionate, fantastically acted period drama set in the 1950s. DiCaprio and Winslet both give wonderful performances as a young married couple who, at the beginning of their relationship, believed they were special and destined for great things, only to find themselves later stuck in the sort of ""keeping up with the Joneses""-looking suburban life they loathe. Winslet's character is constantly asking who made the rules to the life they are living and, better yet, why do they have to follow them? She suggests they move to Paris, a place DiCaprio once told her he felt the most alive and one she's never been to. For a moment, they look set to escape their dull existence, before DiCaprio gets a promotion at the job he hates, forcing his retreat into the world he swore was sucking out his soul. Winslet feels betrayed and more like a prisoner than ever before. The story is a heartbreaker and especially relatable to anyone who has ever experienced the descent from young conqueror to the conquered.",1517443200,,1036,4.825842696629214

The supposed theme of the movie, however, the desperation of dull, middle class life in suburbia, seemed to hover over the screenplay like an empty shibboleth, artificially imposed upon a story that never really developed it into anything believable. The sudden change in Kate Winslet's character late in the movie was also not believable, though it's difficult to say if that was due to Winslet's acting or an ineffectual screenplay, which also lacked plot and character development in the beginning of the film.

3399099,5,B0016Q2D66,"I saw this years ago and found it very moving, a drama that almost borders on a psychological thriller. Not quite, but close. Its definitely more than just a drama.

For those who reviewed this and chalked it up as boring or depressing, they probably don't much care for psychological thriller-type movies. The plot takes a couple of twists, and it almost hurts to see how much angst the characters inflict on each other.

This is not just a drama about a couple experiencing the malaise if middle age, in a middle class neighborhood, in mid-century America. It goes way beyond that. Its hard to take simply because its a grim reminder that we often treat our own loved ones worse than anyone. This is not a good choice if you're hoping for a story that wraps everything up in a neat box with a neatly tied bow, with everyone living happily ever after.

""BUNCH OF NONSENSE.
why? I'm a doc who is old enough to remember the ""good old days"".

One: it's very hard if not impossible to put the tube into the cervix by oneself unless you are a contortionist.
also, You have to dilate the cervix first, which hurts.

Two: the catheter was inserted by the local abortionist, not by the woman.

Three: The ""self administered"" abortion was a knitting needle: Usually this was only done by the poorest and most ignorent patients we treated: and when they came in with a perforated uterus, we had to do an emergency hysterectomy.

Four: back in the fifties, every upper class lady, and a lot of the lower class ones, knew the local abortionist, and rarely had complications. The one at our ""college"" lived in the next town and was a full MD.

Five: deaths became rare after penicillin and blood transfusions were invented.

The only one I know about was from a dirty catheter, with retained fetus and placenta that got infected (i.e. second trimester).

Propaganda of course, to scare the PC into hating pro life people.""",1515974400,,1218,4.627906976744186

This movie has value in that it demonstrates ""lives of quiet desperation"" as they are lived in suburbs all over the world; and it tackles difficult social issues such as materialism, abortion and the right to one's own body, gender economic and social divides, marriage and children, ideas about definitions of happiness, etc.

I do have a problem with the story as told.  In the first few minutes, the plot coyly promises an uplifting story about marriage and family, only to lead us into a narrow view of miscommunication, anger, disappointment, depression and desperation.

3399187,5,B0016Q2D66,"A fundamental existential question of our lives has been the goal or purpose of it. If there is a purpose, then how should we live, such that our lives fulfil that purpose? Philosophers as well as ordinary men have pondered this question for millenniums. Seventy years ago, Jean-Paul Sartre declared that there is no meaning or purpose to our lives other than what our own freedom defines. This meant that there is no joy in looking up to a God or a Guru to give us meaning to our lives. We must rely on our own resources to find an answer and craft our future. But the future is not knowable. It is inherently uncertain. This causes  anxiety and despair from which there is no escape. The larger the purpose, the higher is our responsibility and hence higher the anxiety and despair. This film explores this existential dilemma through a young American couple in their late twenties during the 1950s in suburban Connecticut. The moment I saw that Sam Mendes is the director of the film, I was confident that the subject will be handled with great skill. His treatment of suburban American life  in American Beauty gave me that faith. The film itself is based on Richard Yates classic novel of the same title, written in the 1960s.

The film is set in the mid-1950s and gets off to a flying start, with April and Frank, two young people, meeting at a party and getting interested in each other. In the next frame, we see them already married with a couple of children and living in a lovely suburban corner house in Connecticut with beautifully tended lawns and well-appointed interior decorations. Frank Wheeler works for a firm in NY selling business machines. April is a housewife now, but was an aspiring actor prior to her marriage. A few years into their marriage, as Frank is on his thirtieth birthday, April realizes that they are just living a humdrum existence. It is not the dream life they envisaged when getting married. Instead, they are just following the template given to them by the post-war American society - that of getting a home on debt, consuming on debt, having boring get-togethers with boring neighbours, working a job that he hates and repeating the whole charade year after year. Little does she recognize that neither of them actually has any real, passionate dreams to pursue but only have fantasies about such a dream.
April finds that Frank loved Paris city when he spent some time there years before. So, she suggests that they leave Connecticut and go live in Paris, where she will work as a translator in the US  embassy while Frank can discover what he would love to do with his life. April believes that Paris would give meaning to their lives and show them what their dreams are. Frank agrees and they announce their decision to the total disbelief of his colleagues at work and their neighbours. Just as they are making preparations to leave, April finds that she is pregnant again and Frank is offered a promotion and significantly more money at work. Doubts set in and plans are derailed amidst bitter acrimony. Ostensibly, the rethink is because you cant support three children in Paris on a secretarys salary and that it is foolish to turn down a promotion with a lot more money in these difficult times! They update their friends on the changed plans. While entertaining their friend Helen and her family, April and Frank are brutally confronted by Helens son John, who is a Ph. D in Mathematics and also just out of a mental institution. With searing honesty, he shows them their delusions and exposes their postures and pretensions. The film moves on to a devastating climax.

The story is splendidly narrated and I simply loved the film. Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet are brilliant as Frank and April in their search for a meaning to their lives and pursuit of happiness. Watching them hardly felt like they were acting. It was like taking a peep into our own  lives. The 1950s is brought to us graphically in the way we see a whole train load of men disembarking at the Grand Central station in New York city, clad in stylish suits and smart-looking hats. The cultural feel of the Eisenhower-era values is brought to us by the conversations April has with her neighbours and the ones Frank has with his colleagues at the office. Watching it in 2017, one notices immediately that everyone smokes incessantly and drinks quite substantially. Given the theme of the film, it is as if they use these stimulants to take their minds away from facing up to the emptiness of  a consumer society, selling false American Dreams of affluence.

The film has made me want to read other books by author Richard Yates, on whose book this film is based. Even though the book was written more than fifty years ago, it is amazing how relevant it is still today. After all, it asks us, Leave alone trying to understand the world or other people. Do you actually know who you are?",1513814400,2,4914,4.6728323699421965

And, when blood was dripping toward the end.  It is better when the viewer is older.  I found it to be sort of a retro black comedy.  I especially enjoyed a couple of parts.  When he broke the Paris news to his coworkers I found humor.  I also enjoyed his melodramatic coworker's comments.
For example, ""foiled by faulty contraception,"" and "" the secretarial pool will be ecstatic,"" etc.  He made me laugh when he made the phone call
on visual aids too.  I also enjoyed the part when he was being offered the job and asked his boss if he remembered his father in the same job for twenty years.  And, the part about picking his nose while his wife supported him made me chuckle.  You know there was mental illness with the wife.  And impending tragedy but Leo made the journey entertaining and at times fun...kind of like life.  I really admire this body of work because it was such a collaboration.

He, certainly not an innocent in their relationship and having his own serious bouts with impulse control, desperately tries to stay in step with her frenetic dance. He is virtually simon-saysing.

Frank wanted to make April happy but her dream to run away, live in Paris and find themselves sounded fantastic but life got in the way and Frank couldn't leave security for an unknown future. Watching this movie was like being a fly on the wall, being privy into their complex marriage. The acting was so real and so believable. It was like they weren't acting at all. It was spellbinding! The era was portrayed exactly as it was then. Women just wanted to get married, have children and live the 1950's American dream. But, April wanted more. She said she was suffocating. She was unhappy and she looked desperately for a way out, another kind of life that held promise of excitement and uncertainty. She was bored. Being a mother was unfulfilling for her and her marriage was too safe. Poor Frank. He would have done anything for her but throwing away everything he had worked so hard for was not going to happen.. He thought for awhile he could share her fantasy, but in the end he couldn't do it. Most people thought Frank was in control but in all truth it was April. He tried so hard to fulfill her life but nothing he could do would ever satisfy her. April was a very unhappy woman but it was far more than that. She was mentally ill. She had all the characteristics of being by-polar. She was plagued with constant highs and lows and from the outside looked in she appeared very appealing but it was anything but. She was sexually hyper. Her hormones had a lot to do with that but it was also part of her illness. When she started dancing in the bar with her neighbor it was all premeditated on her part and the neighbor, always desiring her went right along with her game. I was mesmerized by her dance and her oozing sexuality. Throughout her marriage to Frank their sex life was thoroughly enjoyed by both of them but I suspect for her it was much more than that. It is a characteristic of bi-polar, extreme sexuality. She showed manic behavior and chronically depressed behavior throughout their marriage. Yes, she was bi-polar but she also had other mental disorders. She was not able to love. At the end of the movie she had a complete psychotic break. She was not able to distinguish reality from depressive psychosis. She was in desperate need of hospitalization to stabilize her deep depression, because all she could see was hopelessness. This was the 50's and this behavior was not easily recognizable in those years. I felt so sorry for Frank. They were both young, immature and prideful but he inherently was a good, stable man. He loved April with all his heart but she couldn't return the feelings because she had none for him or her children. The thought of her having another child made her suicidal. The botched abortion was her way of committing suicide. She didn't see a way out because of her depression. Death to her was a release from her tormenting life. That was the illness talking. She had so much to be grateful for and many reasons to be happy but because of her mental illness, what looks good to others is not shared or felt with her. After her break from reality when she begged Frank to stop talking and leave her alone, Frank was beside himself and in anger retaliated with harsh words that Alice couldn't feel. The next morning, Alice appeared to be over her tantrum and Frank was so happy and releaved. He asked her if she hated him and her response was of cause not. That was a true response from her because she had no feelings for him. They were all for herself and her deep depression. Frank was so releaved. He didn't want to see the truth and accept the fact that she was mentally ill. He didn't know how to deal with that, so he left for work, knowing deep inside things were precariously dangerous. Such a sad movie. The acting is so intensely wonderful. I highly recommend this movie!",1440633600,4,4198,4.503276539973788

3399487,3,B0016Q2D66,"Directed by Sam Mendes and starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, REVOLUTIONARY ROAD would like to be a scathing indictment of 1950s America and suburbia but unfortunately fails to say anything fresh, and its satirical edge is remarkably dull. Still, there were some fine performances and individual moments that stand out, not to mention the excellent filmmaking on display. The story is about the Wheelers, a couple who live in the Revolutionary Hill Estates, a Connecticut suburban community. On the outside their life looks idyllic, but underneath it all there is a deep dissatisfaction and resentment that begins to manifest itself. The banality of suburban life is not a new topic in literature or film, and this film does a good job getting the surface details right in order to make its point rather clear. However, I didn't feel like it did anything I haven't seen before in other films, like THE ICE STORM and Sam Mendes' own AMERICAN BEAUTY. In fact, this felt a lot like AMERICAN BEAUTY, with the exception that it was set in the 1950s. Even the score was reminiscent of the one for that previous film. However, that one had a more arty feel that this film didn't have. Still, despite the (ironically) banal subject matter, this film was well put together on every front, both technical and performance-wise. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet do a good job playing their roles, although there isn't too much depth to their characters at all. There were a few smaller roles that had familiar faces behind them, but they also felt under-developed. By far the best performance in the entire film was a small role played by Michael Shannon, the temporarily institutionalized son of the couple who sold the house on Revolutionary Road to the Wheelers. His couple of scenes have that acerbic wit and bite to them that I wish had been more prevalent in the overall story, which felt downright sterile at times. From a technical standpoint, the film is flawless and the photography was beautiful, belying the ugliness of the atmosphere projected by its characters. Overall, I didn't hate this film but I didn't think it entirely justified its existence either. It does a good job of portraying suburban malaise, but at the end of it you have to ask ""So what?"" Still it made for a pleasant, if unspectacular, viewing experience and was capped off with the perfect ending.",1421020800,,2381,4.881481481481481

3399506,5,B0016Q2D66,"This was a great movie because the subject matter is so unique.  I read a review of this movie years ago, describing the Suburbs to be the death of the soul.  How chilling, and yet, it is what everyone aspires to.  The third child, then the fourth until the wife looks like an old hag unless she goes out and gets botox so her face can look frozen like all the 40 something reality show women.  Yates does not address what draws people to that life.  He implies there is living up to your parents expectations and fitting in and conforming to what everyone else is doing and pursuing a life of materialism.  Keeping up with the Jones, or in today's world, the Kardashians.  Is it that parenting is just way more draining than most people ever thought about, there is the implication that no one is really prepared for the true nature of a adult life as we know it, especially since the 70s were known as the me decade, post birth control, where couples for the first time in history, could consider becoming fulfilled in an artistic, profoundly spiritual way.  April knows she wants to be an actress but the De caprio's character has no clue.  We know he owes it to himself to take some time and find out what that could be.  The insane son of their realtor neighbor is the little nagging voice in his head that tells him to go for his DREAMS and keep searching until he finds it, but he never does.  If you think about the way society has been since the 50s, it has only gotten more alienating, celebrating individual expression and uniqueness less and less.  April thinks she has the perfect answer which is Paris, but that too, could be just another delusion. She is so desperate to feel special, she sleeps with her best friend's husband.  He is so desperate to feel that he is a person he sleeps with a secretary who eyes him in an elevator.  Paris is a beautiful city but has the same issues as any other metropolis, competition, its very expensive, cold, exclusionary, celebrates the past and pedigrees.  When tourists go there and dream of finding the solution to all their problems and run away to a glamorous, romantic place where everything magically falls into place.  it would be interesting to know how many Americans move there from their middle class frumpy existence and then suddenly find themselves forty pounds thinner, much better off in every way simply because they move to the most decadent city in the world.  April is dreaming a silly fantasy and her husband knows it but he doesn't know how to do anything other than do a better job at suburbia.  The book is somewhat autobiographical, Yates did get a a divorce after having 2 kids, did live in Paris for some time, did search for artistic expression, did smoke nonstop and did feel modern life sucked the soul out of men in the 50s.",1415145600,,2810,4.508875739644971

3399526,4,B0016Q2D66,"April is textbook Borderline Personality Disorder. The fact that she switches instantly from love to hate to a robotic lack of emotion and empathy, and in and out of alternate realities, indicates severe psychological dysfunction that had no contemporary terminology in the 1950s, so no wonder Frank was constantly dismayed by her irrational mood swings and multiple personalities.

Since the original book was written in the 1950s this film doesn't really fit in with all the other recent revisionist Hollywood films which are hellbent on portraying the 1950s Great American Dream as a hoax, a scam, a lie... SOMEBODY must have been happy back then with that quality of life!",1409011200,,676,5.1454545454545455
3399527,3,B0016Q2D66,"In some ways, this film, which reunites ""Titanic"" stars Kate Winslet, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kathy Bates, is reminiscent of ""A Doll's House""-- a piece that challenges the conventional role of a wife in a more repressive era. Both  will end with the wife breaking out of her conventional role, and an environment in which they felt imprisoned, but in very different ways and for very different reasons.
 In either scenario, the husband will be left devastated. But whereas in Ibsen's 1879 play, there is some hope for redemption, in director Sam Mendes'(Winslet's then-husband) film, based on Richard Yates' 1961 best-seller, there will be a different outcome.
 Like Ibsen's play, this too, is a story of a mismatched couple who made many poor choices.
 Set in the late 1940s, then skipping ahead to the fateful summer of 1955, DiCaprio and Winslet play Frank and April Wheeler, who, amid the lovely music of the Ink Spots, meet and dance at a party-she an aspiring actress, and he a longshoreman about to take a job as a cashier.
 An edited scene depicting April's childhood gives some insight into her character. The book purportedly reveals her childhood to have been a troubled one, impacting her relationship with others as an adult.
 Our initial viewing of the Wheelers as a married couple in Connecticut is during April's less-than-stellar performance in a stage production of ""The Petrified Forest"". We hear audience members express relief when the play is over. A discouraged April sobs backstage as her friend, Millie Campbell (Kathryn Hahn) waits for her.
  Frank goes to the dressing room to see his wife afterwards. The first of many quarrels begins when they disagree about whether to rendezvous with friends afterwards. The row continues as they drive home, pulling over to the side of the road still bickering.
 Indeed, as many critics have said, this film depicts what many think would have happened if the fate of Jack and Rose of ""Titanic"" had been different.
 This film becomes a difficult one to watch as the couple with help from Kathy Bates' realtor, Mrs. Giving, move into a more desirable residence on 115 Revolutionary Road.
 Frank continues to commute to work with the Knox Machines firm in New York, and April, having abandoned her dreams of acting, tends the home, and their two children, Jennifer and Michael (Ryan and Ty Simpkins).
 Outwardly, their lives appear idyllic, but in reality, they will continue to be fraught with conflict. Frank reluctantly follows in his late father's  footsteps  as an employee of the same firm.
 On his thirtieth birthday, he has lunch with the young secretary, Maureen Grube(Zoe Kazan), which leads to an affair in her apartment.
 After Frank leaves, he goes home to his wife, who is apologetic about they way she has behaved since the play and his children, who have thrown a surprise party for him. The expression on his face shows him to be deeply moved, but the audience knows he is hiding a guilty secret.
  As they prepare for bed, April, recounting a time in their courtship when Frank talked about his time in Paris during World War II, and how he imagined finding fulfillment if he went back, recommends that  they move there, stating that  she could work as an government secretary while Frank studies and takes time to decide what he really wants to do, rather than stay in an unfulfilling job.
 Frank initially but reluctantly agrees to the  plan, but sharing the idea at the office as well as with Millie and her husband, Shep (David Harbour) seems to be to its detriment.
 Mrs. Givings,  frequently visits  the Wheelers, and at one point asks if her son, John( Michael Shannon), a Math Professor who has been institutionalized, hoping that some company might improve his condition.
 During a get-together, Mrs. Givings, John, and Mr. Givings(Richard Easton) discuss their impending move to Paris, as they previously had with Shep and Millie.
 But soon, April is pregnant again, and Frank is offered a raise at work.
 An outing at the beach with the Campbells provides a crucial moment in which Frank reveals that he is leaning towards staying in his position, much to April's disappointment leading to another quarrel. In the bathroom of their beach house, Frank discovers the equipment April had acquired to terminate her pregnancy, leading to another heated argument, during which Frank questions his wife's sanity.
  I would not call this  film a pleasant viewing session; the constant fights can leave one exhausted and demoralized.
  There is a notable scene where Frank  gives the definition of the word ""inventory"" while speaking into a dictaphone. It seems to set the stage for how he feels his family life should go as opposed to April's vision of what their life could be.
 His affair with Maureen continues briefly. Among the many noteworthy  entries of the film soundtrack is the song, ""Crying in the Chapel"", which suggests that the Wheelers might have fared better with some spiritual values.
  An evening out with the Campbells at a roadhouse finds Millie happy that the gang will stay together. While dancing with Frank, she reassures him that April will get over their not going to Paris. But a series of events finds April alone with Shep, who has been long desirous of her. After confiding to Shep her feelings of uselessness and of feeling trapped, they have a fling in Shep's car after Frank takes Millie home--despite April's pregnancy.
 Another dinner with the Givings leads to a brutally cathartic ""sound and fury"" moment with John, who though insane, proves he's no idiot, correctly guessing the couple's situation and the real reasons for it.
 After Frank's rage chases the Givings out of the house, he and April continue the feud  to the point where April runs out towards the woods, where the couple had had a more pleasant stroll with John not too long before, with Frank in pursuit. April warns Frank away. During the feud, Frank confessed his infidelity, to which April , who hadn't been sleeping with him for quite some time,is apathetic.
  Frank drinks himself to sleep, while April stays outside, smoking, only to find his wife in a better temper, cheerfully making breakfast the next morning, taking an interest in his job now that he has been promoted(inwardly conceding defeat) and giving her husband one last pleasant moment in her company, secretly harboring the fact that she has  made a fateful decision. She briefly speaks with Millie, who has been looking after her children due to her feeling unwell over the phone, tearfully tidies the house, putting the items Frank knocked off of her dresser during their latest fight back in order, and commits an irretrievably life-altering act....
 Upon the revelation of a tragic outcome, we find DiCaprio responding just as he did when he played another character named Frank( last name Abagnale) in another movie--running away from the site of misfortune with a pained expression, his head thrown back, and his 6-foot frame taking quite the blind, dramatic sprint down the road. Although the film differs from the book regarding the fate of the Wheeler's children, life will go on for their closest neighbors, although it will be sadder for both the men who knew April intimately, and Mr. Givings  will decide, as some justifiably will that the Wheeler's tragic story is one that should be tuned out.",1408838400,2,7364,4.931118314424635
3399528,5,B0016Q2D66,"As a person who would move to Paris in a heartbeat if my responsibilities disappeared, I could totally relate to April. April is a creative, colorful person who feels trapped in the rat race of life, in marriage, in motherhood, in the mundane. Frank, her husband in name, is feeling the dissatisfaction of the daily grind at working at a job who's company doesn't even remember his salesman father. April, not quite one to give up, devises a plan to get out of dodge, and Paris is a calling. The audience is somewhat surprised when Frank agrees to her fanciful and ""whimsical"" plan. (It was quite whimsical in the 50s. Nowadays everyone who feels the pull does it.) They put the house up for sale, and pack up most of their belongings. Then, Frank gets offered a promotion at work, and it seems to go downhill from there. All the old wounds get opened up. We see April struggle to hold on to ""sanity"". We see Frank struggle to hold on to April, his trophy wife. Ironically, Frank is the one who always wants to talk things out. April is the quiet, introverted type, who needs to just be, to think. Frank doesn't understand her need for space and resorts to hitting the bottle. Again, it's a downhill spiral from there. When April returns from thinking, it's morning and she asks how would Frank like his eggs. Anyone who can see the resignation and change in her, knows that no good will come from this interaction.

I was stupefied after watching this as this movie gave me pause for about an hour. What dreams am I burying to sustain my pace on the wheel? Where am I performing cognitive dissonance to survive? As a colorful woman, I could relate to April. But what about Frank? I could even relate to him in that as a man in the 50s, you don't rely on your wife to bring in the income. He possibly felt emasculated at the very suggestion, but didn't speak up then. However, his actions were very loud and clear when he accepted the promotion to possibly save face. He did not take April's feelings into consideration when he accepted.

The movie contained volatile scenes and was a bit jarring because I can't say that I've ever seen such raw passion and hatred performed on the big screen, or TV, before. However, these types of scenes is a regular everyday occurrence in some households. This movie was a real portrayal of real people.

The actors have evolved from their earlier work together, and their chemistry is palpable.

I have a sneaky feeling people were looking for another Titanic-esque love story and this is definitely not one of those, plus the story naturally lends itself to the provocation of sympathy for just about every character in the film.  It wasn't overwhelming, though, at least not for me - I thought most of the characters handled the everyday disappointments in their lives (we all feel them!) pretty well, at least until the wife decides she can't do that anymore and things fall apart.

They would have been fine. It might have brought out something great in them.  In any case, they weren't going to starve.  We're talking France not Uzbekistan.

3399566,5,B0016Q2D66,"""Revolutionary Road"" is a movie I put off a very long time in watching.  I have to be in the right kind of mood to watch a movie of its kind--deep, thought provoking, and one that you and your friends can discuss into the wee hours of the morning.

Frank and April Wheeler (movingly portrayed by Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, respectively) are the principle characters of the movie.  They are the embodiement of (at least on the surface) the American dream:  nice, beautiful house in Connecticut, children, picket fence, etc.  Trouble is, NOTHING is at it seems.  April is a women who lives--yet isn't ALIVE; Frank deeply desires his American dream to have it all, yet he cannot escape the nightmare that has become his life:  he is an adulterer, hates his job, and second guesses his manhood.  Their arguments build and build, until the bloodletting is almost as harsh as the characters of George and Martha in ""Whose Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"".

All this seems to change when April convinces him to LIVE his dream:  move to Paris (she'll work instead of him) and just let the chips fall where they may.  This decision seems to invigorate them both, and plans start being made.  That's when all hell breaks loose.

I am not going to give anymore of the plot away because if you get the chance, you really should see this movie.  The main actors were superbly cast, as are the minor ones.  Kathy Bates puts every ounce of gusto into her role as a real estate agent, who is trying desperately to find her mentally off-balance son a friend.  The movie is rated R (and this confuses me).  There is no violence, no nudity, a couple of sexual situations, and some language.  DiCaprio and Winslet are just unbelievable.  Although I'm not a huge DiCapril fan, I don't know what it would take for this guy to win an Academy Award.  Highly recommended.",1389225600,,1844,4.598159509202454

And while I did like this movie and understood the emotions and frustrations of the characters, I find it extremely obnoxious when the super-rich, beautiful people of Hollywood who honestly do not have any idea what it is like to struggle and feel trapped by life, make movies about how trivial, pointless and unsatisfying life is for us ""normal"" people. It strikes me as extremely elitist, arrogant and down-right demeaning. I'm sure all of us middle-class ""regular"" people would love to know what it's like to make millions traveling around the world and getting paid to dress up and play make-believe in front of a camera, but since we don't, it's really a slap in the face to be told that our mundane lifestyles really aren't as worthwhile or meaningful as theirs.",1381968000,2,1189,4.639810426540285

I had seen it back in 2008 and thought it was a sad and depressing, although extremely well-done film, but at the time the theme didn't really apply to my life.  I recently came upon it and decided to add it to our netflix list because we have started trying to have a family and have watched many of our friends have kids, move to the suburbs and change from the fun people they were to drones that hate their jobs and lives for the most part.

Its interesting to see how this movie was the story of the 1950's suburb life and the themes, issues and disappointments still fits life very closely today. We were moved by several pivotal scenes. The scene where April stands at the end of the driveway when putting out the trash can and EVERY SINGLE HOUSE has their trash can in the same place. Kind of like the suburbs of today where every 3rd house is the same....everyone does the same thing on the same days etc etc.  The scene where Frank is among all the men at the train station, all dressed the same, all solemn, all going to their jobs that they hate in the city.  We still do this today, only in most cities its one person per car, in traffic, road rage etc etc.  The scene where April tearfully claims that she thought ""they were different, they were special"" and immune to the middle class boring life. That the American dream is what everyone strives for and then is just disappointed when they get there. I've seen it in my parents back in the day and I see in my friends with families now.  This movie is powerful from beginning to end. The acting is superb and you see the theme of disappointment and couples who have ""settled"" for their American Dream whether its the neighbors who claim they think Frank and April are crazy for planning to move to Paris, but are clearly jealous or Mrs. Giving's husband who turns down his hearing aid to tune out his wife in the very end of the movie.

My husband and I couldn't stop thinking about this film for days after. We worry that starting our family will mean the end of our happiness.  It will most likely not end in the horrible way this movie ended, but we are hesitant to give up our condo in the city and the life we currently love to buy into the American dream.  Since seeing this movie, we are even more adamant about staying close to the city we love even if it means we have to give up the big house, garden, good suburb schools and the life we are ""programmed"" to want.  I think we may make our own path and see where we end up with that.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who feels the need to ""keep up with the Jones's,"" its not all its cracked up to be.  I have actually ordered a copy to watch again and again....not only because I love the movie, but because I think I need to be reminded once in awhile.",1372032000,3,2837,4.22365988909427

But be forewarned, it is a story that is not for everyone since the plot will leave you depressed for days after viewing, however the message is well worth the ride. Glancing over the credits one would think it is a cast reunion from the movie Titanic, with the main actors taking center stage once again alongside Kathy Bates in a period costume piece. However, this movie is the anti-thesis of  the sappy 'Titanic' love story and could become a cynical study into what could have happened to Jack and Rose if they both had survived the iceberg and settled into marriage. The pace is slow and moody despite the nostalgic set production of the 'simpler' times of the 1950s. The movie's premise is a study in human isolation that is hard not to relate to regardless of how different one thinks they may be. This is of course what makes it crawl under your skin, it demonstrates how we are defined by our society despite our better intentions and knowledge. How we conform in order to fit in and how we lose our identity along the way regardless of believing in our better potential.

The Movie
Review
By Richard E. Noble

This was a difficult movie to watch in its entirety - dark and depressing to say the least.

After watching the movie, I had to go to my computer and find out about the author whose book inspired this movie, Richard Yates. They had a picture of Mr. Yates in the biography I read.

Even his picture was depressing.

The bio said that he had a traumatic childhood and was an unhappy man.

No kidding! Who could have guessed?

Mr. Yates must have been a barrel of fun for family and friends alike. But I am a writer myself, and I find him a curiosity. I ordered his volume of short stories. Whether we like to face it or not, all of life is not Marry Poppins.

From a writer's point of view, the author had to be a very good writer to hold me there until the end of this emotional disaster.

Of course, it could be Sam Mendes, the director or any and all of those responsible for putting this movie together. But, for a start, I'll go to Mr. Richard Yates and see how some of his other works affect me.

Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio deserve praise for their daring to take on the parts of such characters. They truly did an excellent job.

Kate Winslet plays DiCaprio's wife. And what a rendition she provides.

From my perspective the woman in the movie is obviously mentally ill. The story inside the upper middle class home on Revolutionary Road is that of a reasonably normal male who has married and is in love with a severely depressed woman.

At one point DiCaprio brings up the notion of his wife seeing a shrink.

You think?

I would say so.

Kate Winslet does a superb job in capturing the manifestations and personality deformities of this sad, empty woman. This woman has no redeeming qualities in my evaluation. For any actress to take on such a role requires great confidence and courage.

DiCaprio does yeoman service to the part of the struggling husband attempting to bring a reasonable content if not happiness to his confused bride and life's companion.

I felt sorry for him.

His role was secondary and basically played off Miss Winslet.

He is also the only semi-positive character in the whole movie.

I would like to say that this is not a critique of upper middle class suburbia and more a classic study in manic depression, but taking all the surrounding characters in the movie into consideration that is not being realistic.

There isn't a bright face in this whole line up. The community is not real. It is a morose caricature of a slew of sad individuals, all migrants from the dark side the planet earth.

The lightest moment for me in the whole movie was at the very end. An old man in the movie being exposed to his wife's negative banter on the sad conclusion to the studied couple who once lived as their neighbors on Revolutionary Road, reaches into his shirt pocket and turns off his hearing device. That actually made me smile ...

It really didn't warrant a laugh.

I disagree with the ""A hands-down, watch it three times in a row masterpiece"" accolade on the cover of the DVD.

Once was more than enough for me.

The Hobo Philosopher, Richard Edward Noble, is a writer and the author of: ""It's a Long Story"" a group of six ""long"" short stories.",1362787200,2,3244,4.474489795918367
3399642,3,B0016Q2D66,"Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio reunite as a suburbanite couple in this deeply pessimistic film. I found this to be the culmination of the empty, spiritual-less road in which we are headed. Kate Winslet stars as the unfulfilled wife of a typical 9 to 5, hates his job, cheating husband in Leonardo DiCaprio.

Dreams of moving to Paris and starting anew has re-invigorated Winslet's character, Amy. Especially after her husband Frank agrees to go along with it. You can tell that Frank is never totally on board. He is trying to please Amy, but when she gets pregnant Frank finds a loophole in getting out of it. Amy is devestated and is even willing to abort the pregnancy to keep her dream alive. Frank becomes livid when he learns of her intentions and their marriage begins to spiral out of control.

There is no reason to watch this movie a second time. It is a startling, hopeless situation with no real solution. The acting is very good and you will be affected in one way or another.",1361577600,3,993,4.604519774011299

Our cubicles and cookie-cutter houses don't make us happy. This movie is a look at the people who are miserable under the constraints of what society says we should want and want to do. I loved the book, think the movie was an adequate representation of the book, and could watch this every day. Perhaps what is depressing when watching this is the realization that this is a lot of lives, not just the unlikable characters.",1361404800,2,544,4.396039603960396
3399644,4,B0016Q2D66,"This is a story of young married couple living the middle-class life in suburbia. Time is in the 50's so for many of us, it is a foreign world when men wore suits, ties and hats to work, wife stayed home, and a live band played in local clubs.  Winslett and DiCaprio unite once again for some serious work, no more kiddie stuff. Topics of their arguments are following one's dreams, cheating on spouses, children, etc.  All of which could be very boring and redundant but these actors are fully capable of entertaining us with their looks and skills.

There are some fine supporting actors including Kathy Bates playing the helpful real-estate agent who by trade is talkative and has a son in a mental institution. Story asks the question: who is more insane? One who day in and day out trudges off to a job that he detests or one who rebels and pursues his dreams giving up the comforts of steady pay check.",1356825600,,908,4.490909090909091

Leonardo DiCaprio is always impressive, as well, but his impersonation of Jack Nicholson in this move felt extremely artificial. I found it very off putting.

Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio portray the ""successfully married couple with children"" of this period.  Beneath the veneer of the beautiful house in the lovely suburbs, a desperate struggle is revealed.  As often happened in those days, the Wheelers met at  a party, seemed to hit it off, and got married.  Then reality sets in.  Frank discovers he is dissatisfied as a ""Man in a Gray Flannel Suit"" commuting to a boring job.  April finds that being isolated in the role of mother/homemaker leaves her depressed.  When she expresses her feelings, she is met with Frank's suggestion that she needs therapy.  When she allows that she doesn't really want a third child and is considering a do-it-yourself abortion (remember, her options were very limited), Frank suggests that she is an inhuman monster.  The most honest person in the film is the real estate agent's son, John, home from the mental institution for a day, who comes along with his mother to the Wheelers' and mercilessly chops through the facade with his observations.

3399671,5,B0016Q2D66,"One of the best films of 2008: a potent, powerful, and, yes, depressing film, brilliantly acted by the two leads, and with superb support, especially by Michael Shannon in two brief but absolutely crucial scenes. Kate and Leo play a couple trapped in the American dream - house in the suburbs, children, well-paying, albeit dull job. The film explores the question: what happens when you achieve your dream only to find it really is not what you were looking for. Winslet character is similar to the one she played in Little Children - unfulfilled housewife. But unlike her character in that movie, here she is trapped by the social conventions of the early 1950s, i.e, women, especially mothers, did not go to work. When people are trapped, they can sometimes pretend that they are not trapped by simply ignoring it and going on with their lives. MINOR SPOILER ALERT: Here, what really begins her downward spiral is the fact that she is presented with what she sees to be an opportunity to break out of the trap, but when it is taken away she can no longer pretend she is not trapped. Winslet is, as always, superb, and diCaprio has never been better (which is saying a lot). Their on-screen chemistry is tangible, and their off-screen friendship obviously allowed them to go at each other no holds barred - the intensity of many of their scenes is painfully honest. A film not to be missed.",1346716800,,1392,4.685714285714286

3399687,4,B0016Q2D66,"As always, the best characters of fiction are those that are flawed and thus appear the most real. And the story behind this movie really gave the characters some real issues and contradictions that contribute a lot of how they act in this particular story. For example, Frank is shown to have an affair and then come home to his family throwing him a special birthday party. April on the other hand becomes increasingly detached as the movie progresses as she continues to aspire for more in her life, whatever ""more"" is supposed to mean.

The movie is not a happy one, that is for certain. But to be fair, the acting, especially by Kate Winslet, is pretty stellar and they really know how to flesh out the full range of emotions that each of these characters go through as the story unfolds. And given Sam Mendes as director, the movie is quite the visual masterpiece, but in a manner that is more subtle than his other movies like American Beauty. In that film we were treated to visual spectacles like the scene with the roses (you know which one I'm talking about, yes?) whereas he we have set pieces that play out amazingly well in a stark brightness that tries to push the image of happy suburbia. The lies the contrast (or the juxtaposition if you will), that as much as most of the movie is bright and full of sunshine, we as viewers are in fact watching a relationship fall apart bit by bit.

While I don't expect all movies to be happy, I think the story could have used some bright moments here and there. All throughout it seems to just get heavier and heavier, which is probably why I had issues really immersing myself in the story. While beautiful from a technical perspective, the story was a bit more painful than what I'm comfortable with.",1324771200,,1758,4.507836990595611

DiCaprio and Winslet star as Frank and April, a young couple with dreams of ditching their humdrum suburban existence for the freedom and excitement of Paris; however, circumstance stymies them, and resentment follows. Revolutionary Road looks immaculate, and the performances are outstanding, but I feel the movie is more tasteful than emotionally resonant.",1320969600,,624,5.578947368421052
3399689,3,B0016Q2D66,"Eleven years after their mega-hit ""Titanic,"" Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio reunite for ""Revolutionary Road,"" released in January, 2009. Kate has shed her unappealing baby fat and is now a curvy beauty, whereas Leonardo is definitely a man and no longer has that boyish vibe.

""Revolutionary Road"" is a drama about a couple with two kids living in the suburbs of Connecticut in the '50s. Frank Wheeler (DiCaprio) marches off to the big city five times a week, ten hours a day, to a job he hates, whereas April (Kate) takes care of things on the home front, including their hardly-seen children. April's dream of being an actress has failed and she vents her frustrations on Frank. Feeling emasculated, Frank has a meaningless affair to prove his manhood to himself. Meanwhile April comes up with a wild idea for them to move to Paris because Frank's war tales describe it as a place of total exhilaration and April desperately wants Frank to regain that aura of vitality he had when they first met. Will they escape the miserable corner they've painted themselves into or will they join the masses of living dead in their midst?

I enjoy a good drama now and then, like the excellent ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snow-Angels/dp/B001DN0V02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snow Angels</a>,"" the potent ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grand-Canyon/dp/B000056BSJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grand Canyon</a>"" or the masterpiece ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dead-Poets-Society/dp/6305144168/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dead Poets Society</a>,"" but ""Revolutionary Road"" fails to achieve the greatness of those films, mainly because the characters and their story are fairly boring. The film's just not that engrossing, which is my main criteria for evaluating any flick.

Yet it does have some glimpses of greatness. For one, the movie possesses a very real bizarreness that's hard to explain. Seriously, this is easily one of the most slyly offbeat dramas I've ever seen. Secondly, Michael Shannon as John Givings, the mentally disturbed son of the real estate lady (Kathy Bates), is a fascinating character. Everyone else in the Wheeler's lives thinks their plans to give up their surburban paradise are crazy. Big surprise. But John sees the brilliance and necessity of the plan. In other words, the only person who 'gets' the plight of the Wheelers is this nigh-insane dude. But he's not really insane. John is gifted at seeing through a facade to get to the core of a matter, the awesome or awful truth. And he has no inhibitions about speaking his mind, good or bad. At heart, John is a beatnik, the 50's precursor to the hippie. He represents the first wave of the 60's counter-culture, a generation of youth who discerned the cracks in the post-war ""paradise,"" and spit on it, for better or worse.

The film raises some important questions: Is life just having a marriage, a family, a well-paying job (you loathe) and a nice home in the pleasant suburbs, plus cigarettes and drinks without end? Or is their more? What about love? What about genuineness? What about unrealized, unused or ignored talents and dreams? What about (gasp) God?

""Revolutionary Road"" has some other positives: it's expertly made, has a good score by Thomas Newman and evokes some haunting moments.

The film was shot in Connecticut & NYC and runs almost 2 hours.

FINAL WORD: Because of the unengrossing characters and story, I can only give ""Revolutionary Road"" a strong 3 Stars or C+. But I can see why others rate it higher because it does have flashes of greatness and it definitely makes you reflect on its themes. In some ways, the same message is addressed in ""Dead Poets Society"" (and ""Grand Canyon"" to a lesser extent) -- rejecting the box society tries to confine you, throwing caution to the wind, and going after your dreams -- the difference is that ""Dead Poets Society"" (and ""Grand Canyon"") accomplished this with a captivating story whereas ""Revolutionary Road"" doesn't. Generally speaking, that is.

But this is a film that might be better on repeat viewings. We'll see. I'll be sure to adjust my rating if it is.

In any event, it's definitely worth catching if these themes trip your trigger.",1320019200,,4308,5.323529411764706

3399692,4,B0016Q2D66,"Revolutionary Road is a very watchable emotional rollercoaster of a film which develops more like a melodrama play than a film. Intensely character based it persists in defying roles and status: wives and husbands, man and woman, work and not work.

Overacting is resisted, but only just. The existence of the 'mature' son who is from the State psychiatric clinic brilliantly brings in the truth for all concerned. He speaks without social filter and this after the truth has been defined as something wonderful and self-fulfilling - like going to war.

The soundtrack has a three-note piano motif running through it not unlike the music in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shawshank-Redemption/dp/B000P0J0EW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shawshank Redemption </a>, you may recall that film's view of hope. Hope is being analysed in Revolutionary Road. There are many twists and turns in the suburban tale not unlike the Picasso (?) painting on a wall in one scene. The story also has a surreal element to it and not just when they wonder into the woods.

The director is very careful to keep us visually interested with as many different places for scenes as he can muster in what is an entirely story based movie. No crawling through a sewer to freedom here (Shawshank).

The dialogue is a little too textual at times. Characters speaking sentences which look good on a printed page but are strained when enunciated.

Revolutionary Road is a wonderful movie and I highly suggest others watch it.  To me, it shows what happens when people DO fall into the mundane motions of every day so called normal life.  Why is it that we are expected to grow up, marry, have kids and just survive day to day. When we are all younger, we have dreams and fantasies of what life should be like.  It's only when we reach adulthood that our dreams are crushed by society and it's definition of what is right and wrong.  Sam Mendes, Kate and Leo were brave enought to make a statement about that with this movie.  Another part I liked was the idea of taking someones dreams away from them.

I wanted to have a hose to flush the memory of it from my brain.  This ranks up there at the top of my list of worst movies ever made.  I like DiCaprio a lot, and have several of his movies, but I think he and Winslet just wanted the paycheck.

This movie is a strong statement about the gender-defined ""roles"" everyone was expected to play until the 1970's, and how trying to fit into those sterotyped roles stifled and suffocated. The movies' basic tenet is that anyone who married, had children, had a nice house in the suburbs with enough money, (i.e. played their roles) couldn't possibly have been happy or fulfilled. The only way to be happy and fulfilled would be to always be a totally self-indulgent child who goes through life only doing what feels good at the moment.  Responsibility is to be shunned, since it forces one to maybe have to do something that is not ""fun.""

The movie offers no insight into their personalities or motivations, no interaction with their two children or anything else that would elevate them from shallow, one-dimensional, paper cut-out dolls.

DiCaprio and Winslet are excellent actors.  But two hours of watching them fight visciously and tear apart themselves, their marriage, their lives and possibly their childrens' lives is not entertainment.  It is shallow, narcissistic voyeurism.

3399707,4,B0016Q2D66,"`Revolutionary Road' is one of those films that although not especially `positive' or `happy' is very well written and acted and draws you in from the start. Following a successful couple who seem to have it all, good job, nice house, two children and a happy marriage, this film explores how all is not quite what it seems and the tensions and frustrations that simmer away beneath any marriage. The acting from both Di Caprio and Winslet is fantastic and the natural chemistry between them makes the love and fight scenes all the more potent. This film is infused with a sense of sadness throughout as you see the couple go from carefree, idealistic young adults to a confused, frustrated and angry set in their ways couple. This film also looks at how the good and bad things in life can trap you into set patterns that don't fulfil you, things like a pay rise or promotion or a pregnancy that alter your plans for the future. The fifties set pieces and costumes are great, as is the directing from Mendes and this film is a very polished affair. You won't walk away with a spring in your step, but that isn't necessary every time you watch a film, and the overall effect at the end is so powerful that this is well worth a watch.

A tying record 11 Academy Awards.
  Now Leonardo and Kate re-team in a new movie, Revolutionary Road, directed by Sam Mendes (then married to Kate Winslet, divorced in 2010).
  April (Kate Winslet) and Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) meet at a party in the 1950's. They dance and become involved. She wants to be an actress.
  Now 7 years later, we see that conversation between the two married couple gets quite heated. She doesn't wish to discuss her bad night in the play. He keeps harping on her about it.
  The next morning, while Frank goes to work at the firm, April begins to recall how their marriage has been.
  She remembers when Helen (Kathy Bates) first showed them the quaint Connecticut house on Revolutionary Hill.
  This is Frank's 30th birthday, he is bored with his job and his family life. He has an affair with a co-worker, Zoe (Maureen Grube).
  At home, his wife decides to become a more understanding wife and surprises him with a birthday cake and their two children at her side.  She has another idea to present to him.

  My thoughts: I enjoyed seeing Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet working together again and hope they will consider doing another movie together in the near future. I just did not care for this type of story. Not a winner.
  I like Winslet with the blond hair.

3399709,4,B0016Q2D66,"Revolutionary Road (2008) is a film that is fearless in asking the big questions of life...and looking at the answers that our culture provides and that we provide for ourselves. While set in the suburbs of mid-50s America, the movie feels just as relevant and present today as then. For when it comes to marriage, relationships, family, career, and dreams, the questions and answers around those things are timeless. Director Sam Mendes, who made the Oscar-winning Best Picture American Beauty (1999), has crafted a very similar picture here, set 50 years earlier but with the same basic story of a married couple in the suburbs who are at a stage in their lives and marriage where they are not sure what to do and how to live. The couple in Revolutionary Road, played flawlessly by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, are almost like the 1950's parents of the couple played by Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening in American Beauty. The parallels between the two movies have been shared by many other viewers and critics of the film I'm sure.

While I think American Beauty looks at the big questions in a slightly more dramatic and cinematic way, the subtlety of Revolutionary Road is just as powerful if one pays attention to it. Which I really noticed today on my second viewing of the film after seeing it over a year ago when it first came out on DVD. I give American Beauty 4 stars out of 5 and Revolutionary Road 3.5 stars out of 5. Both are adult dramas and very well crafted films with great writing, acting, cinematography, and music. I'm surprised that Revolutionary Road wasn't nominated for more Oscars than the three minor categories it was. But I think the Academy probably felt that this was another American Beauty, which won 5 Oscars, and so it passed it by for other films that year, such as The Reader (2008), which also starred Kate Winslet and for which she won an Oscar for Best Actress. The Reader is a good film as well (I also give it 3.5 out of 5 stars), but I actually felt that Winslet was better and more deserving of her Best Actress Oscar for her work in this film.

As Revolutionary Road unfolds, we see DiCaprio and Winslet's characters, Frank and April Wheeler, both mature and become cynical. It's April's ""failed"" final  appearance on stage as an aspiring actress, the dream career that she's had all her life, that seems to trigger something deep inside her...and inside Frank. After pondering this failure and fighting with Frank, April comes up with the idea that they should quit their ""American Dream"" life and move to Europe, specifically Paris, France. Frank had visited Paris as a young man and loved it more than any other place. Having failed at making her dreams come true, I think April now wants to live vicariously through Frank going after his dream career in his dream place. Since she seemingly can't make her dreams come true, she now wants Frank to make his come true. But Frank has fallen into the easy suburban ""Father Knows Best"" lifestyle in the suburbs, and he doesn't realize that he actually loves it. So initially, he gets excited by April's idea of moving the family to France, where she will work and support him as he ""finds himself"". With this exciting and reinvigorating change upcoming, Frank starts taking risks at his job, which actually pay off with an offer for a huge promotion. And when Frank finds out that April is pregnant with their third child, he knows then that what he wants is his family life that they already have more than anything else. That's who he is. He just didn't know it before.

Part of what is interesting to me about Revolutionary Road is that the typical male/female gender roles are reversed in this film. Frank is really the stable family-oriented parent, and April is the free-willing risk-taking parent. I assume that there must have been men and women that did fit into these roles in the 50's just like today, even though our history books don't usually talk about it. Instead we usually get the stereotypical gender roles presented to us through 50s nostalgia. But I like that Revolutionary Road explores these issues by taking a more ""modern"" or current view on the big life questions through role reversals. I think it makes the viewer, or at least me personally, look at these questions of purpose, happiness, and what I want in my life as universal human questions that have nothing to do with gender or the time in which we live. The fear that we all must confront in asking and answering these questions for ourselves is the same regardless of the context in which we are in.

Revolutionary Road is a smart, mature adult film well worth watching. By ""escaping"" into the past, it actually helps us look at ourselves in the present.",1287878400,2,4741,4.686674669867947
3399710,4,B0016Q2D66,"Revolutionary Road....My 30 something daughter recommended this to me as a must see. I was a bit reluctant at first with the cliche reuniting of Leo and Kate, so about 8 months later I watched it.

It is about the angst of relationships, centering on the wobbly marriage of a couple who bought the ""everything will be perfect, if we just find our picture-perfect house"" etc... Well, years and two children later, boy and girl, things just don't appear to be settling into the halcyon days promised. By every 50's standard, they had it all.

What Revolutionary Road poses is basically who are the ""they"" who write these rules in life, who promise paradise and deliver reality? When, where and what date did people let the ""norm"" become the only reality acceptable? When did he and she lose track of the ideas, dreams, hopes that get us through each redundant, mind-numbing day? Is the pioneer/adventurous spirit totally annihilated in this day and age? Have we,ourselves, been packaged, advertised and sold as a product that just fills in the spaces for society?

This is an adult movie by fact that the issues it deals with are grownup problems. Having grown up in the fifties, I remember when if you knew someone who was divorced, well there just had to be adultery there (heard of 2 divorces in my entire childhood!). Why? .....people stayed together, regardless! That is just the way it was. Many of us have lived through a lot of what this couple faces...the fights, the frustrations on both sides, having the 'perfect house"" and still leaving one day when we could no longer say ""I love you"" and mean it!

Leo and Kate give superb performances as the troubled couple. They play the pathos with honesty and care. She is crying while doing the dishes. He is breaking things in anger and frustration. Friends and family are oblivious to the agony they feel inside. She needs to go outside just to breathe. He won't let things go until he ""fixes"" the situation. Kathy Bates also delivers a bravura performance as the local real estate agent. Her character's ""crazy"" son embodies the Devil's advocate. In the end, we wonder....who is the crazier in this situation?

Well worth the viewing all the way to the end, Revolutionary Road lets us stop and look, stand back and view ourselves, our lives from the outside. For those thinking of marriage, for those 30 somethings who will relate, for people like me who have been there, done that and now market the T-shirt, this movie evokes those deeper emotions we stow away til a convenient time. It makes us pause and remember, any day, any time, I can retake my life. I AM the captain of my own ship...IF I take ownership of it!

My last thoughts as this movie ended, I sent to my daughter with thanks for the recommendation : )

""Every day we rewrite our lives, taking the fragments and rearranging them to suit the needs of the moment. Sometimes, the decisions we make, based on those fabricated collages of our existence, take us down a road from which we can never return. Some things are irreversible. Be careful how you chose. The mind tricks us into believing we are on the right path, because it is easier to believe the lie than face the truth, sometimes.""

...quick thought...revolutionary as in fighting against the status quo...or revolutionary as in you revolved and ended up right where you started from???????????...may be both????

Time to get off the roundabout!

Great movie...watch it! OR, like my daughter buy it! : )",1287619200,4,3483,4.723228995057661
3399711,5,B0016Q2D66,"Just before things take a turn for the worse, Frank Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio) is dictating a letter. A line about inventory control underscores the heart of where he and his wife April (Kate Winslet) find themselves: ""Knowing what you've got, knowing what you need, knowing what you can do without..."" Those answers seemed clear until Frank second-guessed himself, tempted by offers of prestige and money. If there is one lesson I have learned in life and that I will continuously remind my children of, it is that second guessing yourself, going against what your instincts tell you, is always the wrong thing to do. Revolutionary Road is a movie about a couple who face this crossroad in life and differ as to the right direction they should take. April listens to her instincts despite the dark uncertainty of her choice. Frank follows the well-lit and safe path.
Revolutionary Road is a movie that splits people on either side, with those who feel it is a study in whiny, selfish, and immature suburbanites wishing for a better life than they currently have. Then there are those like me who felt a deep connection to them, in particular April; the one of the pair that seems the most trapped in the suburban dream and the one whose escape is the most critical
Of the two, April is largely attacked in reviews and I can't figure that out. She is the one accused of screwing things up and being the most difficult and unrealistic. Yet, she is the one who comes up with the idea to move to Paris as a gift to her husband. She is the one who realizes that ""living life as if it matters"" is beyond any price tag. If any one is at fault in my interpretation, it is Frank, who takes the path of least resistance and condemns his wife to a world of ""emptiness and hopelessness.""
What this movie does is give voice to the minority of people who, like Winslet's character, find themselves trapped inside someone else's dream. Some of us break through, but most stay there, slowly wilting and collapsing under the strain of denying oneself of their own needs, suppressing one's soul, and doing what you feel you are supposed to do. Understand clearly that I am not making an indictment of the suburbs et al. For most people in the world, most people I know, and most people living that life, there is not the oppressive feeling of wasting life and the angst therein. What I am saying is that there are those of us who do not feel the same way about that life choice and this movie speaks to us. It's knee-jerk to not only take offense at the dim view Revolutionary Road portrays of The American Dream, but furthermore to see the Wheelers as little more than a spoiled couple; the assumption being they have everything and still they want more. On the contrary, my opinion is that being spoiled means wanting more and yet not wanting to give up what you have. The character of April Wheeler does not want what she has and knows what she needs - not more, but something entirely different. For those who have been in her tormented shoes, Revolutionary Road is a place some of us call Hell.",1286755200,28,3083,4.546762589928058

While others may write a detailed analysis, I have a single word that describes this suburban couple, spoiled.

Entertainment wise on the secondary market ""Revolutionary Road (2008)"" doesn't appear to have sustainable value compared to titles like ""Mulholland Drive (2001)"", ""While You Were Sleeping (1995)"", and ""Angel-A (2005).""

3399714,4,B0016Q2D66,"Revolutionary Road is one of the best heartwarming, lovey dovey, romances out there today. Ok, maybe not, but it's a good movie. Actually it reminds me of the play ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf?"" taken down or up a few notches. The plot was interesting. I really enjoyed watching how things panned out between the Wheelers. I think the film captures universal problems that all couples go through. I predict the film will certainly last the test of time. Some say the film never shows the couple before they came to terms of their mundane lives, but I don't think I would penalize the director, Sam Mendes for that. The film would have just been longer with unnecessary scenes. The film may be on initial viewing depressing, but I find it realistic. This was a much more effective approached as opposed to a typical sappy happy ending romance. The overall lesson I took from this is, don't blame your partner for not accomplishing what you want in life. A relationship can turn very one sided, usually in favor of the man. This isn't necessarily bad thing, but the film goes to show that a relationship definitely needs to be mutual in various aspects. Winslet did wonderful as usual for most of her films. I think she out acted DiCaprio. It's rather hard for me to imagine DiCaprio as the fatherly type. I especially like the character Bug (Michael Shannon). He was hilarious, yet he speaks the truth. I wish more people were like him, dry cut and dead on with realism. My favorite lines are during the monumental dispute towards the end.  This is not a film that I would watch over and over again, one time is effective enough.",1285718400,,1630,4.620689655172414
3399725,4,B0016Q2D66,"For those of you into music of the 70's, Revolutionary Road reminded me of Jackson Browne's song ""The Pretender,"" for its lines, ""Say a prayer for the pretender, who started out so young and strong only to surrender.""  Since that song reflected  the typical baby boomer attitude of those rejecting their parents' lives only to find themselves in the same trap, I would say the main characters Frank and April Weber were a little ahead of their times.

The picture took place in the 1950's, before computers entered the business world, before mothers had careers, and unfortunately before mental health issues were openly discussed.  The rebelliousness of the 60's was unimaginable, and the 70's ""me generation"" theory was years down the road.

This was a time when the ""American dream"" was everything, and people didn't question their happiness or lack of it.  Yet, while she voiced this only to her husband, all the characters would know what April meant when she said, ""No one forgets the truth - they just get better at lying.""

The acting was good - perhaps too good, since some scenes were disturbing.  I wasn't thrilled with April, but I did feel for her, as she was too poignant a character to easily let go, as the people on Revolutionary Road knew all too well.  Even more disturbing was the revelation that, in some way, we all live on this street, which no one leaves behind.

In spite of its depressing aspects, I really enjoyed this film, as it kept me on the edge of my seat.  I wouldn't recommend this for everyone, however, as it is not the love story some would expect, and it certainly didn't have a fairy-tale ending.  And even some less romantic people not needing that ""happily ever after effect,"" may still be left wondering what this story was all about.  But for those not afraid to venture down this road, it will be an unforgettable trip.",1285459200,2,1864,4.680981595092025

This movie captures the dark essence of family life. I'm not saying everyone who is married is unhappy. And not everyone of them ends in devorice. But there is a reason most do. I think the main reason people don't like this film is because it deals with aspects of life that are very upsetting.

Now that I got that out of the way let me get to the review. I think this is a great film. It's very well acted and brutality honest. If you don't mind watching a downer of a film you will find much to like about this tale of oppression. Can't family life feel like that sometimes?",1284336000,2,855,4.245398773006135
3399728,3,B0016Q2D66,"I really wanted to like this movie.  I loved American Beauty, which seems to have created its own sub-genre of suburb drama and discontentment such as weeds, six feet under, and even desperate houswives.  Sam Mendes, who directed American Beauty, is returning to the genre that made him famous, which he established, with a film adaptation of arguably the first work in the genre.  The movie is about how couples and lives grow apart, how we change when we get older, and is done so even more tragicly, that the couple is portrayed by the most famous onscreen couple working today.  The unoffical tag for this movie was a snickering, what would have eventually happened if Jack hadn't died.  But the movie doesn't ever really get working.  As much as I want to like him, Sam Mendes just hasn't done anything substantial since his debut.  I wanted to like Road to Perdition but ultimately it was too distant to connect to, and preachy in its morals of forgiveness.  I did enjoy Jarhead, and thought it was better, but it was kind of empty, and I didn't really think on it again after I was done watching and haven't wanted to watch sense.  This is by far his worst effort.  It never really works except on the frankness of its dialogue on where it attempts to go, and you do have to give it credit for covering this subject matter, but its no longer as controversial as it was when American Beauty came out, and goes nowhere to go up the ante.  I don't suggest that it should merely try to shock us, but I couldn't help but think that I had seen this before, and done better elsewhere.  The characters never seem fully developed, and come off as one dimentional.  I read a couple of reviewers complain that the movie doesn't show enough, that there are too many general concepts thrown around in the movie, and I can understand that to a point.  Usually when that technique is used in film it is because you are about to be shown a lot of information, and the film maker doesn't want to bog down the viewer, but nothing really happens in this.  American Beauty seemed multilayered and this just isn't.  The cenimatography in this film is very well done, and there is a lot of polish, just like in most of Sam's films, but it still leaves you disconnected, and doesn't seem to have a purpose or a focal point for why things are viewed the way that they are.  When in comes to genres, usually one of two things are true: The original work in the genre defines the concept at its most basic element so completely that it demands study, forcing followers to either copy or take in new directions, or just faintly outlines a concept and it is later through different adaptations that you get the seminal work.  I haven't read the book, but from the adaptation here, I have to say the only new concept to movie watchers is the analogy to plain living in suburbs to the conservative era of the 50's model housewife, and the dull and restrictive confines of what society wants for them. The movie looks drab, the characters act drab, its not depressing, as much as boring.  This is shown amazing well in Six Feet Under, which is written by the writer of American Beauty, Alan Ball, in which the charcters have to act out and are restrained because of obligation, and they have friends that have lives they want, and there is yearning, and sadness.  This just seems like dull lives, and the people living it endlessly complaining.  The desires are talked about, but it seems so abstract, wanting to go to Paris, that the audience doesn't want to go to Paris, or want its Characters to go to Paris.  All that is really portrayed in this film is two people with nothing in common, who get married, and grow to hate each other, and the only time they seem to be happy is when they are making childish plans that cater to fantasies they had when they were younger.  There are no relatable or interesting characters, save the mental patient who defies the culture of the time, and tells the couple how horrible they are, when I don't think that either character is horrible.  I wonder what he would say about this movie?  Same Mendes, and Kate Winslet divorced after this, I would love to see Sam do something with some passion and take from this rather than do some pretentious work that he dug up.",1281139200,2,4284,4.489690721649485

Richard Yates apparently believes anyone that we dare say is ""happy"" in their ""Americana"" lifestyle HE portrays is simple minded. We are all liars going through the motions of life, unless of course we move to Europe, smoke alot while sitting at a corner cafe with a French beret on. Sheesh!! These people are the authentic real people? This reeks of pure pretention to me, and is somewhat insulting to anyone with any sense of obligation to someone beside themselves.
The truth is even the roads LESS traveled can be at times boring and unfullfiling. I have always marched to the beat of my own drum and I am at my happiest when I am creative, so I do ""get it"" How when we are not working or living a creative life it can be mundane. However; I can also see the joy that may come from actually having a family, children etc.  Why does Yates potray this in an either/ or way? Why is there no mending of the two? Why is everything in Yate's story so black and white? If you are not ALWAYS, 100% in sync with everything YOU want, even the risk of death would be better! April is one of thee most unlikable characters ever written/ or potrayed in film. Her need to be free is not for any noble reasons, just purely selfish. April would be unhappy no matter what the scenario; living in the suburbs ( the bad, bad suburbs) or in Paris ( her ideal utopia.) Basically, she is a spoiled brat of mediocare talent who is delusional and childish. There is no motivation other than one's own selfish consuming wants in almost every character. I can enjoy a book/movie who's views do not align with my own but could not enjoy this book/ movie for the reasons mentioned. Spoiled and bratty with no redeeming qualities or the slight chance to evoke sympathy does not a good story make. They are merely caricatures to insure Yate'e gets his message across.

Their dreams of living abroad, treading the boards, etc., are pushed aside to make way for the realities of life with two kids.

However, another unplanned pregnancy dashes their dreams of living abroad, and their lives together crumble as a result.

This movie is a study of two things: social mores of the 1950s and the disintegration of a marriage. Both illustrations are fascinating. Performances are more than solid (Both Winslet and DiCaprio are masterful in some of the final scenes.), and the careful recreation of 1950s suburbia is remarkable to observe.

3399746,5,B0016Q2D66,"I have to admit that I was never much of a Leonardo DiCaprio fan and I had even written Kate Winslet off as a 'flash in the pan' when she co-starred with him in Titanic. Two Academy Awards and some amazing performances by Kate and equally terrific roles by Leo changed my mind. So, I decided to give Revolutionary Road a look, first on HBO.  I was absolutely mesmerized, but I did have negative feelings about the conclusion of the story.. you see I alllowed my conventional taste for cinema to overrule my better judgment in a way.  This happens all the time with the public and Hollywood films, and is why so few movies that challenge, trouble, or stir us are ever produced.

I was haunted by what I saw, and decided to watch a second time.  This time, I focused on the superb acting ao ably captured by the Director, Sam Mendes ('American Beauty' Director and the soon-to-be-former-'Mr. Kate Winslet'). I noticed faces, expressions, emotion; all real, gritty, searing, heart-rending.  The viewer's desire for plot conclusions is thwarted continually, yet the viewer's thirst for challenging material is quenched minute by minute.

Gone, is the 'pretty boy' DiCaprio of 'Titanic.'  In his place is the polished, slightly weathered, infinitely deeper actor who fits easily and convincingly into complex adult roles; and there are few more so than Frank Wheeler in this film.  Wheeler is a 1950's post Depression dreamer-turned WWII soldier-turned reluctant New York businessman paired with a die-hard idealist wife named April (Winslet).  Marital conflict is frequent and intense in the Wheeler marriage as Frank, some will argue, 'grows up' and accepts a successful career and life and friends in suburban Connecticut, while April refuses to really 'let go' of the dreams she once shared with Frank.

Prepare yourself for tension, conflict and surprise dramatic developments.  Also, I must mention Milly, unbelievably well-portrayed by actress Kathryn Hahn.  Keep your eyes on her face about halfway through the film in a key scenewhere the Wheelers spend an evening at their neighbor's home and reveal their rather unconventional future plans.  I'll never forget Hahn in that scene.

3399747,5,B0016Q2D66,"This movie is very close to my heart, or maybe to my dark side; contemplating many subjects like boredom, high expectations, and self destruction. Based on the novel by Richard Yates; I don't believe any other two actors could've done a better job than Winslet and DeCaprio.

Love is not the magic cure for problems; sometimes it might make problems even worse. When two people are in love and faced with life's crisis, what are they to do? What are we to do, when our minds take a life of their own and our decisions are separated from our passion, and might lead to our moral demise? Watch this movie and question the story of what is life all about, or as Yates once said: ""Most human beings are inescapably alone, and therein lies their tragedy.""",1270425600,2,750,4.514705882352941
3399748,1,B0016Q2D66,"My problems with this movie.  I did not think it was good at all.  I would put it one step above ""The Room.""  Here are the things that i found to not be good about it:
- When Leonardo hit the car with his fist, it looked like it didn't hurt at all.  It reminded me of the same scene in ""The Departed.""
- All of Kate Winslet's diologue was vague.  She didn't explain anything at all.  What hopelessness?  Why is Paris that much better besides it being a place where people are ""alive.""  What does that even mean?  How are they more alive?  How are we less alive?  What's wrong with doing things people do in Paris in the suburbs?  Is painting against the law?  Is quitting your job for six months against the law?  Why can't Frank just take a leave of absense from his job?  Then he could find out what he wanted to do here.  Why is this movie necessary?
- The audience was ""told"" that April was a bad actor.  We never see her act though.  And she just gives up?  After one bad performance?  that we didn't even see?  Why not attend acting clases?  Read books?  Study films and plays?  Be in another play?  She complains about Frank being a loser for not going after what he wants, but how much better is she?  One bad review, and no more acting?  Damn, what a loser.
- Kathy Bates looked deranged.  Her makeup, although possiblly period accurate, was just atrocious.
- Kathy Bates saying ""NOOO Frank he's not well!!!"" looked like a stage performance.
- This line of dialogue; ""Come one step closer and i'll scream"" (one step closer) ""AAAHHHH"" Frank even bends over, covering his ears.  This might look ok on stage, as you don't want to scream as loud as possible, but you want the audience to think you did.  In the movie it looks stupid and terrible.
- What the hell is wrong with suburbia?  It looks pretty awesome.  What the hell is April talking about when she mentions ""hopelessness?""  If it's so bad, why don't they just move back to the city, they seemed much happier there.
- Why does April think Franch has better government jobs than America?  I've never heard this.
- I find it hard to believe that a lot of people fall in love in Rom-coms.  This was the opposite.  Why did these people hate each other so much?  Why did April say she loathed Frank, and then made him breakfest?  Why is the sun shining directly over heard when Frank is suppose to be going to work to get his promotion?  They had kids.  Frank had a great job.  It didn't make any sense, or it was awfully done.  Why did April think of Frank as ""just some boy that made her laugh at a party once.""?  I thought he was the most interesting person she ever met?  Did the writers forget?
- The soudtrack, oh gawd the soundtrack.  I kept thinking ""make it stop, make it stop""  The same 10 second loop, over and over and over.  Damn that was awful.  It was not menacing.  it was not dramatic.  It was ear-splintering, mind-numbingly, coma-inducing awful.
- Speaking of the former, that scene at the end where the realtor's husband turns off his hearind aid, and we get a glimpse of silence.  That was awesome.
- How can you watch this movie more than once?  A women gives herself an abortion, bleeds on the carpet and through her dress, and dies.  That sucked the first time.  I can't see anyone watching this movie more than once, knowing that that's coming up, without skipping past it.
- Why didn't April go see a psychiatrist?
- Why was Frank's work terrible, then being praised by the CEO?  Again, telling us it was bad, instead of showing us why it was bad.  Show, don't tell!!!
- The sex scenes. Two sex scenes.  Both lasted 10 seconds, without even a camera change to make it seem like they lasted longer.  Again, this works on stage, but not in a movie!!  Two guys blow within 10 seconds!!! No wonder April has a terrible life.

I could go on, but i can't.  This movie was awful.  Don't believe the critics.  It's not worth seeing.  I haven't read the book yet, but i also heard that was excellent, so i think i might just to try and figure out what the hell this movie might've been trying to do.

3399751,2,B0016Q2D66,"""Revolutionary Road"" is about a bored, ungrateful woman who has a comfortable life and whose biggest problem is that she really doesnt have any problems, aside from the problem of living in a dream world and looking around to see that reality just doesn't measure up. That is her biggest problem. She is like one of those people who are in love with the idea of love but really don't know and wouldnt know what to actually do with it if it came to them.

The main character played by Kate Winslet is married to a hard working, loving husband (Leo DiCaprio) who has a good paying job which has allowed them to lead a comfortable suburban upper middle class lifestyle with their two children. But that is not enough for April (Kate Winslet). She feels trapped and as if she has not done enough with her life. So she starts nagging her husband and tries to convince him to sell the house, uproot the family and move to France (!). Minor details, such as how they are going to make a living or even maintain their curent standard of living in a foreign country where they don't speak the language, are not further explored. Naturally, her husband is resistant to the idea and just like any sane person in their right mind cannot get behind his wife's notion of just leaving the country on a whim to go to France to do exactly what....eat croissants? No amount of reasoning works with her, however, and through her passive aggressiveness and constant whining and crying she pretty much promises to make his life a living hell if he does not cave in to her far-fetched, immature and selfish fantasies.

The movie tries to paint April's problems and her character in a sympathetic light; like someone who is above it all, misunderstood, disillusioned; someone we all could empathize with and whose struggles we understand. In reality, what it records is callow, immature and superficial behavior by a spoiled, ungrateful and unlikable woman who has way more than she really deserves given her ungrateful attitude. She is someone who does not inspire us to wish we knew her better but someone we just want to slap everytime she starts whining and throwing fits because she cannot make her life be the fantasy she'd like it to be.

The movie is a melodrama, trying to create deep seated problems and psychological struggles ex nihilo. It is as if the writers were trying to force depth and deeper philosophical questions into the story, where in reality there is just shallowness. April spends nearly every scene either staring longingly out of the window or with tears in her eyes, about to burst into a hysterical sob because....what...she doesnt have enough real problems in her life and has lost perspective of the things that really matter. She is like a little child who throws a fit if she doesnt get exactly what she wants.

When Frank, after having first agreed to go with her, changes his mind due to the promotion he finally got at work, April loses it completely, gives herself a home abortion which goes awfully wrong and then dies.

In the end, this movie leaves you unsatisfied and makes you wonder what the hell the problem actually is with April who strikes one as an incredibly immature and selfish person. Granted, suburban life can be suffocating and meaningless; ""American Beauty"" gave us a glimpse into that portion of life that just seems to resemble hell, but April's reaction and attitude are pathological. Unlike Kevin Spacey's character in ""American Beauty"", she is not someone who is parched for love and goes ballistic. She simply does not have much love within her to begin with. She couldn't possibly be parched for something she never had. She seems to lack a moral center and only sees herself. She is not a particularly  loving mother to her children or kind wife to her husband. She treats her family as some kind of nuisance that is in her way and needs to be removed. Frank is erroneously pictured as a selfish man because he is responsible enough to have a job and provide for his family and not want to run off to some random country living in a fantasy, while April, who is the real self centered prig here, is painted as the deep, sensitive rebel who can supposedly see through the phoniness. But she is the phony and it is because of her phoniness and selfishness that she is ultimately miserable. You watch this movie for two hours and wonder what the hell is actually wrong with this woman that she is constantly sad. Objectively, her life is not all that bad - in fact it is great and she is blessed in many ways. In the end you realize that all April really needs is therapy and that obviously she is not a dreamer, but mentally ill.

""A good movie is not what it's about, it how it's about it"". This movie is slow and comatose - from the music to the script and the interaction of the characters with one another. The production aspect of it is great, but everything else is lacking. Whereas in ""American Beauty"" the issue of suburban inertia was tackled with wit and irony and, most importantly, from the heart, the struggles of the characters in Revolutionary Road just seem insincere and it makes it hard to sympathize with someone so out of touch and irrational. The audience is always kept at bay and never given the opportunity to identify with either April or Frank - probably because, unlike Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) in ""American Beauty"", we don't really see much of ourselves and our demons in Frank's and especially April's phony problems.",1266451200,3,5492,4.6440329218107
3399752,4,B0016Q2D66,"The concept is cleverly vague enough that the people this film is criticizing (those trapped within the cycle of living out their dreams exactly like the person next to them) will completely miss the point of it all. The fact is the narrative is not the typical storyline of a couple who encounters problems and is able to weather the storm towards saving their relationship. Yes, they encounter bumps in the relationship but they cannot find a resolution.

The absence of a 'happy' ending makes people cringe because in general, most like to go to the movies to escape reality, not see a numbing representation of the reality of the world. What is that reality? Well, I wouldn't be doing you any favors if I pointed that out nor would I advertise myself as one who could neatly simplify it in a few paragraphs.

I will say however that director Sam Mendes is able to let the events unfold with such care while maintaining an ever-growing presence of uneasiness, that eventually culminates in a crescendo of enormous proportions. Inevitably, this force will cause you to re-examine your relationships present, past and future. Now, I've never been a fan of DiCaprio but I must say with the right director, the man can deliver a good performance. I believe the chemistry with Winslet also helped sell his performance as a man who promised himself more than he could deliver. He is afraid of failing and potentially admitting his own mediocrity while Winslet portrays a woman who is unable to reconcile the need to aspire for something more fulfilling for her existence with the stagnant compromises her husband keeps making for their own good.

Of course, this movie takes place in the 1950's and many will argue things are different today. However, I fear compromise between the genders in relationships will always be a challenge, no matter the period.

The cinematography, set designs, costumes, etc. are all well suited to the times and work flawlessly to integrate the characters in their environment rather than make it look 'stagey'. The clever use of sound/music definitely adds to the emotional turmoil that drives these people to do what they feel they must, and the end scene is no exception. That last scene alone filled me with deep sadness & hopelessness posing the question 'What's the point then?'

I used to think like The Beatles and all you needed was love. Now, I know they were just trying to sell records. Don't get me wrong though, I did like the film tremendously and although the film is hard to watch at times, the hardest things we do are the ones that are worth doing.",1265932800,6,2595,4.783482142857143

How many films do we need to remind us that the 1950s wasn't such a great time to be alive? And that all those neatly manicured lawns and sharp-looking fedoras came at a price? I assume films like this are aimed toward Baby Boomers who bore younger people with endless tales about how great their 1950s childhoods were. For the rest of us, this is just a soap opera. Yes, there was conformity. Yes, there wasn't a birth control pill and women had to do their own abortions. Yes, men had to be the sole breadwinners and had to put their family first. Yes, the suburbs are soul-killing and boring. Even Winslet's role felt derivative, an updated version of her character in ""Jude the Obscure"". Every plot twist was signaled a mile away. When DiCaprio eyes a sexy brunette in the office, I said to my friend, ""they will have an affair."" They do. When Winslet starts dancing with her handsome neighbor, I said, ""they will have an affair."" They do. When DiCaprio goes back to being an office drudge, I said, ""she will kill herself, I bet.""

3399766,4,B0016Q2D66,"Dark period piece about a 1950's couple (Winsett and DeCaprio) who meet at a party in Manhattan.  She is an aspiring actress and he is a fun guy with very few aspirations other than being something like a delivery guy.

The scene shifts forward a few years and Kate is in a play that is apparently a dud.  Leo, now her husband, tries to comfort her saying that at least she was the best thing about the dismal play.  This does nothing to quell her disappointment.  He than pulls the car over (they were driving) and starts yelling at her, telling her that it is unfair for her to be blaming him for her failure (this was not true).  He nearly hits her and this scene is a harbinger of things to come.

Throughout the film it seems that Kate's dreams are constantly shattered while Leo muddle's through life oblivious to her needs.  Kate feels that her life as a housewife in a suburban home with two kids (that was supposed to be the American dream back then) is a boring existance and her husband constantly tells her how boring his job is and that he only keeps it to pay the bills.

Kate comes up with an idea where they will go to Paris to live.  Leo had always told her it was the most fun place he had ever been to.  She thinks that this would be perfect as she would put meaning to both of their lives where she can work and support him until he figures out what he wants to do rather than toil away at something meaningless.

The whole thing sounds like a chance to live out a possible dream but Leo does everything to thwart it.  Whether it be starting up an affair with a girl in the steno pool or wanting to stay at the job he has because his father worked there for twenty years.

The realtor (Cathy Bates) that sold them their house becomes a regular friend of theirs and convinces them to let her bring her son to visit even though he currently resides in a mental institution.  The son may be crazy but he is the only one who sees their relationship for what it really is and has an uncanny knack for seeing through lies.

As the movie goes on Leo keeps killing his wife's dreams to a point that she becomes unfeeling and kind of crazy herself.  I liked this film for showing that the American dream of the 50's wasn't all it was cracked up to be.",1264291200,,2262,4.199074074074074

I knew it was about 2 idealists trying to slum it in the suburbs but the real message for me was how hopelessly trapped the Kate Winslet character was by motherhood. This is very much the tone of feminist literature of the period; the stranglehold of fertility.

I loved the movie and saw, clearly, many aspects of the lives of my mother and aunts of the period...chained by child after child. It is a cautionary tale and a breathtaking one.

3399768,4,B0016Q2D66,"I disagree with most of the reviewers here.  Most view this film as one of a dysfunctional marriage set in the monotone that was the 1950s.  On the other hand, if the film had been set in the 1960s, it would have been viewed as a dysfunctional couple in which one [April] was determined to abandon the 'straight' life whereas her husband [Frank], simply couldn't, with the tragedy that ensues.

As a person who was always uncomfortable with socalled societal conventions, I see it otherwise.  April is determined to shake things up but her 'shake up' has no real direction.  She wants to relocate to Paris without really knowing anything about it....  As third party viewers, we recognize that Paris will prove even more disappointing than Connecticut.  Her husband, Frank, who has been to Paris, is initially carried away by his wife's dream but, learning of her pregnancy, he is jerked back into reality.  Not April.

April, who was probably always psychiatrically fragile, slides inexorably into mental illness.  Severe mental illness is tragic as is demonstrated graphically in the grim ending of this well-acted tale.

3399770,4,B0016Q2D66,"Starring Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, this 2008 film is about a marriage in the 1950s.  It's a time of conformity, suburban living, stay-at-home mothers and a lot of smoking and drinking.  Directed by Sam Mendes, there is an edge to this film, and the viewer immediately senses the despair beneath the seemingly happy veneer that this couple puts forth.  There's tension throughout as DiCaprio is bored with his job and seeks solace in a meaningless affair.  In the meantime, Winslet is home with two children and her hopes of being an actress have been dashed with a mediocre performance in a local theatrical production.  The couple argues a lot and it is clear there is something missing from their marriage.

And then one day Kate comes up with the idea of moving to Paris where she will support her husband as a secretary and he can ""find himself"".  Plans move ahead.  The neighbors are surprised and a bit jealous.  And the real estate agent, played by Kathy Bates, who has befriended the couple, brings her son, who has just been released from a mental institution where he has gone through electroshock treatments, into the couple's home for dinner.  Conflict ensues and he is the only one who voices some painful truths.

This film made me uncomfortable, as it was intended to be.  However, I couldn't take my eyes from the screen because I was interested in knowing how it would all turn out.

While set in the 50's this could be a story of anytime. It is a story of relationships and self identification, of sacrifice and aspiration. Winslet and DiCaprio were excellent and proved their worth as actors.

I give it two stars because of the excellent cinematography and fine art direction (with the exception of Winslet's hair!), but other than the look of the film, it's bad beyond reasonable expectation. I think Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio have done much better work - even in Titanic. In this film, Ms. Winslet fails in revealing her character April's inner motivation, and the bipolar Stepford-like personality reversals have no connection to the character's preceding behavior. It never makes sense or paints a full portrait of who this person is or strives (and fails) to be.

In the same vein, Mr. DiCaprio's Frank is somewhat sleazy and dishonest, but he's neither good enough nor vile enough to care about either way. The best moments were when he convincingly tries to get through to April, but most of the time he looks like a kid playing dress-up. This is the same actor who successfully played Howard Hughes, so the blame lies elsewhere - the direction and script.

Sam Mendes really blew it. The film begins disjointedly with a lackluster first meeting, jumping to a play that we don't get to see, and culminates in a blowout argument - roll titles!
New rule: If the movie doesn't click and grab you in the first 10 minutes, it's not going to, and this one never did. We never learn to care about these people because we have no reason to. My other major beef is, to my ears, the leads don't sound like the era they are supposed to inhabit; it's not at all convincing. Minor quibbles worth pointing out - the brief nudity when Frank bangs his also uninteresting secretary is gratuitous, and the sex scenes with April are unsexy. If banality is the point of the film, why make it?

The only saving graces are Kathy Bates, unsinkable as usual, and her creepy but energetic son as played by Michael Shannon. Just watch his scenes and skip the rest.",1262217600,2,1933,4.6627565982404695

There's trouble in paradise though, when April urges Frank to quit his job, which he hates, and move the family to Paris. Once in Paris, April wants to work at a high-paying administrative job, for the Parisian government. She is willing to support the family herself, while Frank takes time off to 'find himself'.

Skeptical at first, Frank warms-up to April's plan. But after being offered a lucrative promotion at his company, Frank becomes conflicted about moving away to Paris. Meanwhile, April admits to Frank that she no longer loves him. All emotional hell breaks loose in their marriage, as Frank confesses to having a fling with his secretary. And April then has a brief tryst with her neighbor's spouse, in their car one evening.

Things are further complicated in Frank and April's relationship, when April becomes unexpectedly pregnant with their third child. Feeling stifled and trapped as Frank's wife, April doesn't want the baby. And she's willing to take desperate measures, to end her pregnancy. As their marriage completely unravels, Frank and April come to realize the terrible compromises that they've both made, in order to conform to the absurd expectations of American life in the 1950s.

Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, are both well-matched as the stars of this movie. Leo radiates a compelling charisma, as Frank Wheeler. Leo makes the viewer believe that Frank Wheeler should be destined for better things, than his mundane work-a-day life. Kate Winslet as April Wheeler, does manage to outdo Leo's performance. Kate emotes with a skilled precision, giving enough of herself in each scene to be believable, without going overboard.

The supporting cast of this film, turns-in decent performances. Especially Kathy Bates as the Wheeler's simpering neighbor, Helen Givings. And Michael Shannon gives a standout performance, as Helen's son John, who endured brutal, and unnecessary psychiatric 'treatments'.

Revolutionary Road gives viewers a glimpse into the ridiculous, oppressive existence of '50s suburbanites, and the gruesome effects that it had on their lives. After watching this film, all I can say is how thankful I am for the 60s!",1261958400,,2498,5.201492537313433
3399786,3,B0016Q2D66,"Obviously a labor of love for all concerned, Revolutionary Road comes to us after many decades of trying to bring it to the big screen by a long list of many of Hollywood's most talented creators.  All of them have run ashoal on the insurmountable problem odf the novel's structure.  Sam Mendes, the talented British director, thought he had it licked.  He didn't see the trouble coming from the opposite direction: while he was making this show, US television was delivering MAD MEN, a Revolutionary Road knockoff that manages to outdo the original in every direction.  Uh-oh, what a disaster, not in execution but just in comparison to the TV version, the Mendes picture just seems like a mighty waste of talent.

Others have listed the similarities, so I won't bother, but I will say that MAD MEN has made this picture not only superfluous but actually an object of curiosity.  Watching Kate and Leo in what seems like a dutiful recreation of the American 50s, I began feeling restless wondering why even bother putting it back in the 50s?  Wouldn't it have been more honest, less glamorous, if the filmmakers had made it happen today?  What would possibly have made the least amount of difference?  The Wheelers would have the same ennui at living unfulfilled lives.  April would still have been an awful actress (this was a holdover from the Yates original, one of the many ways in which we know that Yates hated women).  Her despair at being ten weeks pregnant, the way Frank uses this as a bargaining chip to make her stay home.  Everything could have taken place in 2008 and you wouldn't have a picture dripping with all that Kodachrome quaintness that ultimately ruins the picture.  These types of movies are made to make audiences feel better, as if to say, look how awful people had it back then, nothing like this could possibly happen today.

As the office mope who sleeps with friendly Frank, Zoe Kazan tries, but the writing just doesn't give her anything to work with.  Think of the various girls Don Draper has it on with, and the contrast is just humiliating to Mendes.  I love Richard Yates, always have, but we've come to a point when others do him better than he did himself (except for EASTER PARADE and A GOOD SCHOOL).",1261872000,3,2241,4.678571428571429
3399787,1,B0016Q2D66,"I'll be brief: Other reviews have listed the heavy social comments made by this movie..yes, I agree, life without God is bleak..but you never hear that solution here-did I really expect to? Nope! But, the crime this movie commits is that it drags on and on, spiraling down and down, into a pit of despair that finally culminates in a mother murdering her own unborn child.

Now isn't THAT an upbeat ending!

No. Movies don't ALL have to be ""Feel good"" or have happy endings, but, censors define obscenity as ..""having no redeeming social value.""By that definition, this movie should be completely rated X and condemned!.

Toward the end, I felt like this movie had been created (from the book) as a vehicle to showcase acting ability. Hard to enjoy performances, though, when the story content was so disturbing and awful.

Oh, Leonardo C., bless his heart, always looks like a little boy playing dress up...he cannot overcome his looks. He came close in the Irish Gangster movie with Jack Nicholson. But here, his face overrides his attempts to portray a mature male. Poor baby.

Oh well....so I wasn't exactly brief, and, YES, I hated this movie. I write this review only because my granddaughter sometimes reads my reviews and I feel it's my responsibility to see that she knows my opinion on this.

Even the Thomas Neuman musical score was created to mirror the boring, repetitve, lives of the protaganists. Thomas, I hope they paid you a lot for those 6 chords. (BLEH!)",1261872000,4,1474,4.783464566929134
3399788,4,B0016Q2D66,"What makes Revolutionary Road stand out to me is the fact that, being patient and putting up with a relatively slow-moving storyline for the first 50% of it will gradually win you over by the time the movie has finished. I feel confident about this because there's a few twists and shockers at the end that I honestly never seen coming.  In order to appreciate these twists, you need to follow the entire film, even the boring parts.

Let's be honest- the first half of Revolutionary Road is slow, boring, and almost pointless. The majority of the first half consists of a young couple (the man played by Leonardo DiCaprio) having big aspirations in life, and the wife encouraging the two of them to go and live in Paris permanently with their two children.

Well, that never really happens because a bunch of obstacles come into the picture and cause a distraction for the young couple, one of them being that the wife is pregnant with another baby. As soon as we find out about the pregnancy, THIS is when the movie really picks up steam. An argument comes about, and then more problems follow suit. This all happens about halfway through the movie.

The first half though... yikes. A VERY slow moving storyline this one has.

Any time any mention of Leonardo DiCaprio's job position is mentioned, the storyline immediately sinks. This is just dull and uninspiring storytelling, and it's a horrible waste of time.

Kathy Bates plays a nice, if somewhat unimportant part in the movie, and like always her scenes are absolutely golden. When she brings her troubled son over and he carries on conversations with the young couple and sticks his nose where it doesn't belong concerning the relationship problems the young couple is having... haha, BAD things happen. I won't spoil it though.

This isn't a comedy- it's a drama with a twist at the end you need to see if you've been following the movie for the first half of it. It's a movie that tells a nice story, and that's about it.",1261785600,,1983,4.664756446991404

3399790,2,B0016Q2D66,"I've never felt more empty and cold after watching a movie before in my life.  I could completely relate to the Wheelers sense of ""entrapement"" in their average, suburban lives but where I feel that the story goes awry is that there is no redemptive, overall message at the end.  I'm not of the camp that says there has to be a clear, concise message at the end of every film, but this one is so depressing it needed something at the end to balance it out!  Otherwise, what's the point of sitting through the entire movie?  The Wheeler's aspire for something ""more"" (what that is exactly is never clear), their plans are foiled for various reasons and then things just spiral horrifically out of control at that point. THE END!  Maybe in 1961 when this story was written the theme of ""quiet desperation"" was new and interesting for people to contemplate but in 2008, I don't think there was anything new to bring to the table and of limited interest for most people!

The only semi-interesting thing that I can point out about this film is that both Wheelers want something more out of life but Frank at some point seems to realize that what they already have isn't so bad.  April, on the other hand, never seems to reach this realization!  Maybe that makes Frank a ""coward"" and maybe it makes him the smart one?!?  Who knows!  Everything's relative!

Lots of people lead lives of quiet desperation, some do something about it and are very successful, some try and fail and others never try at all.  There are a myriad of reasons (some within our control and others not) that contribute to these potential outcomes.  That's life and this isn't new ground!!

I gave the film 2 stars because Kate and Leo gave good performances, but unfortunately they were not good enough to elevate this movie above anything other than depressing!!",1259539200,,1831,4.628482972136223
3399791,3,B0016Q2D66,"Only the talents of DiCaprio and Kate Winslet keep this story watchable.
Otherwise it is a lame story.

In a nutshell, this movie keeps hammering the point that the 1950's were not really as wonderful as portrayed in classic shows like Andy Griffith and Happy Days.
The film also attempts to portray the American Dream and Suburban living as a lie and a depressing prison.

Okay ..... we all know the ""good old days"" were not as pure and innocent as Happy Days ------ BUT, at the other extreme -------- neither were they as depressing and jaded as Revolutionary Road.
Unless of course you were dysfunctional and mentally unstable and generally negative about living.

This film attempts to send a message that the good life of the 1950s was all a lie of fake smiles, depressions, frustration and harmful materialism.

The characters in this film have a nice home in a quiet neighborhood, recently were chosen for a promotion and a raise, take vacations at the beach, etc..etc..etc..

The wife is in perpetual misery because her dream is to toss all this aside and go slum it up in Paris.
In the process she acts like a miserable person on the edge of a mental breakdown.

Her husband is no angel, but he certainly puts up with more of her whacky unstable behaviour than most would put up with.

The movie tries to hard to demonize the rise of middle class suburban living in America and offer a derivative view of life in the 1950s era.

The facts are not matter what time in history you examine, you will find people who are both happy and others who are miserable.

That is no different today than it was then.

However, having lived in the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, and today ....... I DO believe life in America was better 20-30 years ago.

And while there is no time in human history that is perfect (nothing involving people ever will be) ... I can certainly say living in the 70s and 80s in America was better than what we are experiencing today with the direction this Country is heading.",1258848000,,1990,4.5307262569832405
3399792,4,B0016Q2D66,"Over the past period I have seemingly endlessly retailed the experiences of my young adulthood during the 1960s, the time of the ""generation of `68"". That makes me, obviously, a child of the 1950s, the time period of this very interesting movie, ""Revolutionary Road"" based on a book by the darkly sardonic writer, Richard Yates. I have also seemingly endlessly pointed out my experiences and the effects they had as a result of growing up among the marginally working poor in that `golden age'. I am fond of saying that I didn't know there was any other condition than being poor for a long time. Well, I did find out there was and although in my youth I would still have had a hard time relating to the story line of this film. The `trials and tribulations', then, of an upwardly mobile, prosperous young couple, the Wheelers, Frank and April, with the mandatory two charming children and a nice leafy suburban house in some nice town in Connecticut would have gone over my head. Now though I can a little more readily appreciate the seamy psychologically paralyzing side of that existence.

As graphically portrayed in the film that seamy side (that also provided some of the most powerful scenes in the movie, and best acting moments by both Winslett and DiCaprio), the central driving force of the story), is the emptiness of middle class existence in the 1950s. Cookie-cutter is the word that came to mind as Frank and April try to break the golden bonds that keep them tied to their old life. One of the nice moments cinematically is the sequence involving Frank's routine workday morning ritual catching the train to New York City (along with all the other felt-hatted men, the symbol of success in that period). Another sober moment is when April takes out the rubbish in their deathless suburban tract and realizes that this life is not for her.

But how to break those golden chains? The issues presented here about consumerism, meaningless and vacuous work, the isolated role of women in the nuclear family, the eternal struggle for security in an individualistically-driven society are all issues that got a fuller workout and wider airing in the 1960s (and since). In a sense the `whimsical' Wheelers were too early. They were before their time. However, although times have changed, I will bet serious money that if you go to some Connecticut train station headed to New York City on any Monday morning you will see, two generations removed and without the hats, men and women making that same meaningless trip that old Frank made. Yates was definitely onto something about the nature of modern capitalist social organization. But I will confess something, although I know better now the stresses of that fate, I would not have minded, minded at all, growing up in that little `cottage' the Wheelers called home.

It didn't get the Best Picture nomination it deserved and Kate Winslet got a trophy for her inferior performance in The Reader, but Sam Mendes's brilliant adaptation of Revolutionary Road deserves to be recognized for the way it breathes new life into the cliched subject of American suburbia: with its perfect cast, beautifully stark cinematography, vitriolic screenplay and agonizing conclusion, this is a searing and nearly great film.

3399805,4,B0016Q2D66,"This movie is good, but the book is much better.

I liked Kate Winslet's performance very much; Leonardo diCaprio I still can't take seriously as an actor.

Actors like Leonardo diCaprio, Tom Cruise and a host of others have faces that hardly look like they've experienced much in life.

Contrast their faces with the faces of not just actors in the 1930s and 1940s but also directors.

-- Peter Lorre versus Tom Cruise.

-- Erich Von Stroheim versus Steven Spielberg.

-- John Garfield versus Leonardo diCaprio.

-- Mike Nichols versus John Ford.

This is what's missing from the movie version of ""Revolutionary Road.""  I just can't take Leonardo's LA-lovin' baby-face seriously.

Also, the structure of the movie doesn't do justice to what Richard Yates was trying to get across in the book.  Yates was saying something fundamental about ""the American way of life"" -- whereas the people who made the movie (and you can hear this in the DVD extras) were more concerned with the ""relationship"" between the husband and the wife.

A movie can't ask ""Big Questions"" about a culture by sarting with the personal; it has to start more generally with the socio-economic realities of time.  The questions Yates raised in his 1961 book are shied away from by modern-day, post-9/11 filmmakers.  Thus the irony -- a movie based on a book about cultural conformity afraid to step outside the boundaries of present-day cinematic conformity.

Interestingly enough, Leonardo diCaprio in the DVD featurette talk about how the movie is about how one often is guided by what their parents want them to do, versus what they themselves would like to be.  True enough, but Yates in his book is saying much more than that.  His focus is not simply on specific individual relationships but rather the social, political and economic forces that, ironically, most Americans have been brainwashed into believing don't affect specific individual relationships.

These forces are what history and sociology and economics and politics are all about.  But modern-day Hollywood is, for the most part, scared to death to suggest to an audience that an individual is often NOT in control of their destiny; that the world is more clearly understood not in individual terms but rather in terms of collective social, economic, political and historical forces.

The movie shows these forces but only to a certain extentl for example, the outflux of white-collar workers from the suburbs into  the anomic vastness of Grand Central Station.  But only as a backdrop to Leonardo diCaprio's *personal* heartache.

This focus on the individual as opposed to a focus on the societal forces at work is heard again and again in the voiceover commentary of the screenwriter and the director.  They love the story but only as ""a story.""  There's no attempt to present to the audience a ""system of reasoning,"" a way of thinking about America in the 1950s and, by implication, America today.",1256342400,2,2942,5.004115226337449

Life sucks, then you get married, have kids and it turns to hell, we get it! We don't need two hours of fighting and unhappiness to prove what we already know. Life is challenging and you have to enjoy the good things when you can. In this movie there is no good things to enjoy, only misery and fighting.

 The movie features a nutjob who understand the wives desire to move to Paris France and chuck, all reality and responsibility. The wife in this flick seriously needs prozac or some other mood altering drug. She is unstable and in need of psychiatric help at best. She want to get a secretaries job for a government firm in Paris which makes good money supposedly and allow her husband to be a stay at home bum so he can discover what he wants to do with his life. Mind you, she does not have a job offer, she just knows of these jobs and wants to chuck everything to go there and try to get one. There is no planning or realistic pursuit of this aspiration.

There is no real reason for this couples misery, other than there ungratefulness and there sour attitude.  I guess they think the world owes them something, that they cannot be happy unless they are doing something less than ordinary.  I have a hard time feeling sympathy for people who have it so well, yet find so much to complain about.  This film sends the message that all people who live in middle class suburbia, are married and have kids are empty-headed comformnists who have no uniqueness or individuality.  As if being a man who goes to work everyday to provide for his family is not commendable, and taking care of a lovely home and mothering your own kids is degrading.

The next scene shows Frank embarrassed as April is in a play and it is just awful.  The fights start and continue throughout the movie of this mismatched couple.  April's failure as an actress (minor) and Frank's failure to take the family, quit his job and move to Paris to find out what he really wants to do in life.  The movie focuses on Frank who hates his job in New York City, and has the daily grind of going to work and coming home to a wife and two children in a nice home in suburbia, that is on ""Revolutionary Road.""  This gives a clue to what is coming.

April and Frank both feel the middle class malaise, however, April feels it acutely.  Like a 50's wife, she is willing to submit her desires so her husband can succeed.  On Frank's birthday, April asks him to follow his dream - got to Paris (I never figured out why location made a difference in a goal - she later said it could be ""anywhere"").  April talks Frank into taking their savings, sell their home and quit his job to move the family to Paris.  She will get a high-paying job as a secretary in some governmental office.

Feeling free and not tied to his job, Frank submits a proposal that is unexpectedly welcomed.  He meets with a high ranking member of his company who offers Frank a better position and more money.  Frank decides he rather stay in his home on Revolutionary Road.  April is devastated.  She wants Frank to go to Paris to find out what he really wants in life.

The realtor that sold them the house (Kathy Bates) becomes a friend and introduces them to her grown son who has psychiatric problems.  He has had shock therapy and yet he speaks of the evils of conformity.  He told the Wheelers to go to Paris - break out of the mold - find individualism and the spirit of youth.  This causes rough fighting and brutal words between two beautiful people.

The rest of the movie is drama and fighting.  Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet act well, but the lines did not ring true.  The problems they had were not big ones, they could take a trip to Paris with the kids with all their money and see if that is what they really wanted.

Instead, April and Frank keep fighting and hate grows.  April gets pregnant and Frank does not want her to have an abortion.  She wants out of her shackles and self-aborts the baby and dies.  We are told that Frank adores the other children and takes them to a different house to raise.  It is a sad ending to a disturbing movie.

This sounds all well and good, but then various new options and obstacles begin to mount. He's offered a better paying job, and she gets pregnant, and so instead of being able to make a break for a new life the prison of their lives begins to get tighter. It is apparent early on that April is unhappy with her life. On the other hand Frank seems resigned to his vacuous life. April is frustrated with their lives and grows resentful of Frank's complacency. There is a chilling scene, the morning after their big argument, when Frank comes to breakfast. April acts like one of the Stepford wifes, behaving with utmost perfection, like a dutiful wife, as if nothing ever happened the night before. Frank seems bewildered, but relieved, and doesn't seem to think too much about what his wife's chilling transformation could mean.

Sam Mendes (Road to Perdition, American Beauty) beautifully directs this movie, which initially seems trapped in the inertia of its all too idealized depiction of 1950's America, but then Mendes takes us down this disturbing path where everything that is too perfect, sterile and bland is revealed as a kind of prison for this couple, and this facilitates in highlighting the underlining tension between Frank and April. This is a monumental movie that takes its time in order to weave it web.",1253577600,4,1623,4.838129496402877
3399814,4,B0016Q2D66,"Looks like the opinions are all over the map.  Definitely better than the dreadfully pedestrian ""The Reader"".  That withstanding, the script, although impactful, leaves the audience confused over the message/purpose of the movie.
The reason I give it four stars is for the overall authenticity of the tragic romance between the protagonists.  Several fight scenes pulled out the guts of the infamous and disturbing fights between young lovers when the relation sours, and dramatically depicts the unseemly and needless pain two nominally decent people can inflict on each other.  50s plastic commercialism is not a new subject,
yet the movie did have a new take on the matter as the couple dared to defy convention, but ultimately the movie was about how they ended up conspiring against each other and the simple beauties of a normal life.  DiCaprio's character especially was unveiled to be ultimately cowardly, hypocritical, and fawning to the luxuries and vacuous comforts he purportedly despised.  The movie is unable to end on a conclusive note however, and ultimately indicts both human desire but also convention.  A bit of a debbie downer i'd say.  About 3.5 stars.",1253491200,,1174,5.174603174603175
3399815,2,B0016Q2D66,"Frankly, I didn't know what to make of this film.  Unlike a few of the other reviewers, I don't blame the actors.  They're given a script to work with and, in my opinion, they did a fine job.  The Barrymore's couldn't pull it off.  Let's be honest, the characters Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are given to portray are, plainly put, hateful.  I don't recall when was the last time that two protagonists in a ""serious"" film came across as so wholly detestable and generally unlikeable.  More on this later.  But first, the film is structured in such a way that from the word go, the audience's collective heads are pushed under the surface and they will not come up for air for a solid two hours.  In between and with little chance of reprieve, the audience is made to witness the so called tragedy that is Frank and April Wheeler's existence.  You know the kind:  Good home in a beautiful neighborhood, lucrative job, good health, loving children.  Doesn't it just break your heart?  Poor April has to go through life without a stint in Paris on her resume.  Is there any greater heartache in this world than not getting a chance to gallivant through European capitals?  No more catastrophic fate could possibly befall anyone.  Illness, death, madness, abject poverty?  Those are nothing compared to missing out on chugging coffee and smoking cigarettes all the while sitting in a cafe on the Quai de Voltaire dreaming about being the next Sandra Bernhardt.  I don't mean to come across so dismissive but that's the reaction this film engendered in me.  April feels progressively isolated and trapped in a life of conformity and all its dull trappings.  My question:  So what????  I have news for everyone who doesn't already know it.  If you're lucky, that's pretty much the life of almost everyone in this world.  Again, if you're so fortunate that your chronic complaint is that you're dissatisfied and bored and feel that somehow you've been cheated out of an extraordinary life, as opposed to living everyday with stage 4 pancreatic cancer and close enough to the grim reaper that your feel his icy breath on your face or you've just buried your 14 year old child killed by a drunk driver.  At some point of the day, I think to myself, what would my life have been like if I had made other choices?  Every now and again I believe we all feel those pangs of regret for the road not taken.  No doubt, it's perfectly normal.  Frank and April, the latter especially, prefer to wallow in self-pity rather than to take a good hard look at her life and realize that Paris or not, acting career or not, everything else or not, she's pretty darn blessed.  In the end, we're left with two hours of constant fighting, self-destructive behavior (including sexual indiscretions) and for what?  To end up with the most maudlin of endings, one that even Isaac the Blind could have seen coming?  I'm sorry, I have zero to no tolerance for these people and their selfishness and ingratitude, not to mention April's petty complaints.  We never see these characters happy.  There is no downward spiral into the life they now feel trapped in.  It's as if they met, got married and were instantly repelled by one another.  Eternally miserable in a life without escape or worse, meaning.  It's like the Connecticut version of existential nihilism.  Their children are a footnote that seem to appear and disappear with alarming ease.  They're more like shadows on a wall than anything else.  We never see how their lives are affected by their parent's non-stop fighting.  I felt like kicking the living fecal matter out of these characters and telling them to get over it.  Yeah, life can sometimes suck but trust me, the alternative is a hell of a lot worse.  Be thankful and humble and learn to deal with it all.  Sadly it'll end too soon anyway.  Yes, the film has many merits, but they're primarily centered on the production side of things.  The look of the film is beautiful and the performances are uniformly very good.

3399822,4,B0016Q2D66,"I went to see this film the weekend it opened.  Having read the book, and being fan of both Kate & Leo, I was expecting to love it.  I did appreciate it, and was impressed with both actors, but what I was not expecting was to be blown away by a character in this story.  In the book, he was important, but not particulary interesting in his own right.  In the movie, John, the son of the real estate agent, played by Michael Shannon, stole every scene he was in.  John is on a weekend leave with his parents from a mental institution.  He is a key character in that he actually speaks the truth of the tension between Frank (Leo) and April (Kate).  John was a mirror to their illusions--both of their superiority and their disfunctional personalities.
I walked out of the theater thinking of how the film was just a bit off, but couldn't explain why.  It had all the elements of a great film--great sets/costumes, filmed beautifully on actual locations-not sets.  Great actors in Kate and Leo (I was also a Titanic fan so of course the reunion was exciting.  The heart does NOT go on in this one.)  Talented enough director, based on a great story and the script did follow the novel--right to the ending image.  So--what was it?  Was it a bit too structured?  The fights and discussions too rehearsed?  Was it to aware that it better be good?  Not sure--but it is a good film, just not a great one.
What is great, and makes it one to see, is Michael Shannon.  I thought walking out that he was the only one deserving an Oscar.  I was thrilled (and still surprised although agreed) when he was the only actor that received the nod (he lost to Heath Ledger of course).

3399824,3,B0016Q2D66,"Well, if you really feel like depressing yourself, this movie will certainly deliver. It is an interesting movie, but serious flaws are prevalent.

The movie starts with the Kate Winslet character (April) feeling humiliation after an unsuccessful play performance. She quickly has a bitter argument with her husband Leonardo DiCaprio (Frank). We see that their marriage is having trouble at best, and at worst is already dead and waiting for the tragic inevitable end. Whatever people may think of Frank, he has a point when he says: ""It's not my fault that the play was lousy.""

A flaw here is that April and Frank are both unhappy with their lives. And while April looks for an irrational escape, Frank seems more set in reality that they have 2 children as well as responsibilities. True, Frank is not happy at his job. But he's not going to 'jump ship' when he has a wife and 2 children. (One pun on ""The Titanic"" here is inevitable.)

Later, April gets a strange idea to run away to France. What she says may sound good in THEORY. But how can she be sure of getting a job? Frank again carries reason when he says: ""It might make more sense if I were a writer or painter.""

It is worth noting that while the movie doesn't mention it, April may very well be bipolar. The movie tries to keep sympathy balanced between the characters, but it just doesn't work. Towards the latter half, April finds that she is pregnant. And Frank knows that he has to go back to reality and accept a great promotion he has been offered.

Whether you are anti abortion or pro choice, there is an unavoidable sting of reality when Frank says: ""A sane woman doesn't perform an abortion on herself so she can live out some fantasy."" April responds that it is for him. And Frank understandably responds: ""How can it be for me when the mere thought of it makes my stomach sick?!""

Frank desperately tries to save the shambled remains of their marriage, but April only gets more cruel: ""I never loved you. You're just a man who made me laugh at a party."" At this point, we can scarcely blame Frank for his rage here: ""Then why are you living in my house? Why are you my wife?"" Also to his credit, despite his rage, he is able to avoid physically striking her.

Another serious flaw in this movie is that they try to make a cruel and nasty man carry weight. (What he says is not fit to be printed here and would probably not be allowed here.) Charles Dickens often put the voice of reason into eccentrics, but without the profanity and cruelty.

I'm not saying the movie does not have some worthwhile moments. But the story just doesn't work. While it tries to make April heroic, it just does not work. And it seems to try to make Frank look bad for keeping one foot in reality.

3399835,3,B0016Q2D66,"For all the hype surrounding this film, I suppose my expectations were a bit high.  I had no idea what the film was about, so nothing was given away.  I went into it fairly open.  From the opening scene there was something disjointed about the film's flow that I just couldn't get around.  I thought perhaps I just didn't relate to the 1950s dynamic, that perhaps one of the Wheeler couple had some sort of mental imperative that skewed the story for the audience, or some other similar great reveal lurked right around the corner.  But nothing ever jumped out to save this film.  It looked spectacular, the story was interesting though painfully slow moving throughout, the acting was top-notch.  In the end what struck me most was that despite how many wonderful elements made up this film, they did not act in unison.  While Winslet, DiCaprio and their supporting cast were fantastic, they all felt like they were each acting in their own film.  There was no synergy.  That was, in essence, the point of the film, but the feeling that even the cast was fragmented did not seal the story.

The early parts and their meeting and passion didn't seem compelling, so references to or implications that they -used to be happy- and exciting don't really make sense.

I believe there were patterns for happy living that people were supposed to follow back then, and that the majority of them found happiness despite this - those would be the interesting stories. These people are just unhappy and seem to hate each other and can think of no better or more creative way to live than to carry out the hellishness they've created. Hoorah. A character who actually attempts something valiant or at least tough or mildly interesting is needed here, but neither character seems to even want to try taking a hard problem head on.

3399840,2,B0016Q2D66,"""Revolutionary Road"" is a technically well made film with two very appealing actors at the heart of its story, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet (well, maybe one appealing actor since I've never liked DiCaprio that much but I know a lot of other people like him so I'll concede the point).

The problem is that the story is just so bleak and depressing.  I know that some people like movies that depict ""real life"" in all its grim, often boring detail, but I tend to go to the movies because I want to escape from all of that.  There are so many marriages going up in flames in real life, who wants to see two actors portray a fictional one failing?

Don't get me wrong.  Sometimes, Hollywood's depiction of real life can be entertaining and rewarding.  Two movies come to my mind in this category.  The first is ""Ordinary People"" and the second is ""Little Children.""  ""Ordinary People"" showed an all-American family coming apart after the death of one child and the attempted suicide of the other.  ""Little Children"" (with Kate Winslet playing a vastly more sympathetic character in it) explored the disintegration of not one but two marriages.

I think the reason why I liked those films was because of two things.  One was the fact that amidst the sadness, there was some life, brightness, and laughter.  The second was that both of those movies ended on a somewhat hopeful note.  ""Revolutionary Road"" ends with the tragic death of Winslet's character, so watching it was a profound downer.

I didn't go see the movie when it was in the theaters for these reasons.  The only reason why I'm watching it now is because I love Kate Winslet and wanted to see the way he brought her character to life.  She does so with her trademark expertise, but April is a pretty hard person to like.  As for DiCaprio, his ""Frank"" comes across as pretty unlikable too, given the fact that he almost hits his wife during an argument and engages in a sleazy affair with a secretary in his office.

A couple of other thoughts.  Kate Winslet looks like a million dollars in the movie, but she doesn't come across as plausible as an acting student in her early twenties when Frank and April first meet.  As for DiCaprio, it's sort of strange looking at him since he still looks like a teenager, albeit with some lines on his forehead.

Another thing that strikes me as odd is that even though the Wheelers have two young children, they're pretty much off-stage for most of the movie.  How realistic is that?

Overall, the movie is just bleak and since the world has moved on and changed profoundly since the 1950s, it's difficult to see the point.",1250553600,4,2924,5.092436974789916

3399843,4,B0016Q2D66,"Simply put, Revolutionary Road is a hard film to watch.

Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet turn in fantastic performances as April and Frank Wheeler, the ""perfect"" couple on the block.  They have it all: the perfect house, the perfect family, the perfect 1950's lives.  At least, that's how it appears to outsiders.

April, we see in the very beginning of the film, is trying to pursue her dream of becoming an actress.  The play she stars in, however, ends up a failure.  We see the first of many huge fights that she and Frank will have.  April eventually succumbs to the role of Frank's housewife, spending her days in beautiful clothes while she keeps house and watches over their children, who are rarely around.

Frank realizes on his birthday that he is miserable in his current job.  He has ended up in the one position he never wanted to be in--just like his father.  He notices a pretty new girl at the office and takes her out to lunch with bad intent, which is fulfilled later on that day.  While this is going on, April was going through some old photographs and happened upon a snapshot of a younger Frank in Paris, France and remembered a talk they had when Frank mentioned how happy he was then.

Frank comes home that night, wearing his guilt all over his face when April meets him at the door, dressed nicely and acting warm.  He follows her into the kitchen where she and the kids have a birthday cake waiting for him and he makes no effort to hide the pain in his face.  April approaches him later that night with her new plan: they can move to Paris and start all over again.  She offers to look for a job and Frank can stay home and decide what he truly wants to do.  It's perfect!

Except, it's not perfect.  After a short period of bliss, April ends up pregnant and Frank is offered a high-paying promotion to stay at his job.  This wouldn't be so hard to work around if April wasn't slowly realizing that she can't stand Frank anymore.  This is evident when she admits that she never wanted his children in the first place and when he confesses his affair to her, she doesn't care in the least.

Ironically, the only person who saw through their facade the entire time was mathematician John Givings, (Michael Shannon), the son of the Wheelers' realtor, Helen Givings, (Kathy Bates), who they agreed to spend some time with since John has been recently released from a mental hospital and didn't really have any friends.  John cuts right to the core of their problems and lays it all out on the table for them, almost resulting in Frank decking him in front of everyone.

April becomes more and more depressed and miserable as the movie goes on.  She is trapped with this man that she can no longer tolerate, she is stuck in this house in Connecticut and she is pregnant with another child she does not want.  The audience can predict what is going to happen as the film progresses but it does not make the ending any easier to watch.  There is no emotional let-up in this film.  It grabs you by the collar and forces your eyes open, making you take it all in.

All in all, this was a very powerful film and an excellent drama.  You can definitely see how DiCaprio has finely honed his craft over the years.  He looks older but not burned out, only more experienced.  The excited child in him is gone and has been replaced by a mature man.  The expressions on his face are truly heartbreaking and a sign of incredible acting prowess.  You truly believe that he really does love April and can't understand why it's not reciprocated.

Winslet is incredible as well.  You can relate to the position she is in and you can even understand how she resolves her dilemma.  She is a strong woman who is gradually beaten down into a weaker and weaker woman by the environment around her.  What do you do when there's nothing you can do?  She helps us understand exactly where she's coming from.",1249862400,,3910,4.46262341325811
3399844,3,B0016Q2D66,"""Revolutionary Road"" is a serious downer, with one of the most depressing criticisms of suburbia ever seen in a film.

However, we cannot blame Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They do a fantastic job as Frank and April Wheeler, raising the drama to the extreme. One will definitely wonder how on Earth the couple in the film stuck together for so many years.

They play a couple living in Connecticut in a suburban home in the 1950s. Frank works at a mind-numbing cubicle, while April cares for the kids at home. From the start, Frank clearly hates his job and the suburbs.

But when Frank comes home, April gives him the wonderful idea to move his family to Paris. His neighbors and his co-workers are not as thrilled, however. They find every  opportunity to convince him to stay at their home on Revolutionary Road.

At first glance, this appears to be a realistic version of ""The Truman Show,"" minus all the high security gizmos. But ""Revolutionary Road"" takes a turn to the dark side as their family matters grow from bad, to worse, to almost unbearable.

It's not as if the characters are completely off-the-hook and emotional. Kate Winslet plays her part masterfully as a mother who loathes Frank's overdependency on her. And DiCaprio is just as magnificent as an strict, two-timing husband lacking some moral values.

No, it's just that the subject matter is too excessively dark. Whereas ""American Beauty"" has eloquent, poetic dialogue, ""Revolutionary Road"" plays out like an evil suburban soap opera. The high-strung tension in the film gets overwhelming near the end. In spite of the stylish direction by Sam Mendes, the gritty script will make people wonder how the hell this couple could ever get along in real life.

""Revolutionary Road"" is still a great film, with classy 50s tunes and snappy outfits. But it might be a tad too dark, even for DiCaprio fans.",1249689600,2,1876,4.840625

3399846,2,B0016Q2D66,"Instead of blaming Hollywood for their self-congratulatory tales of suburban angst, why not blame a gullible public? For it's the public that laps these specious and false tales up. Why was 'The Graduate' such a success? Because it gave the average person the right to feel that 'I'm better than you'. It's easy to sneer at a Mrs. Robinson, an adult woman who manipulates the emotions of Dustin Hoffman's 'innocent' college student, Benjamin. She's willing to ruin not only his life but that of her daughter's. Her narcissism knows no bounds. In a nutshell, she's a character who's easy to hate. Hollywood has the formula down pat: give us an innocent rebel who 'doesn't fit in' and have him/her pitted against the 'monster'--the hissing mustachioed villain of 19th century melodrama has evolved into the 'conformist' post-war suburbanite.

In Revolutionary Road there is nary a laugh to be heard throughout the entire 118 minutes of the film. No one seems to like themselves at all. At the film's beginning, the suburbanites' community theater production is a complete failure. And the worst performance in the play is given by our protagonist, Kate Winslett's April Wheeler. Heaven forbid people can have fun performing in a community theater production or even laugh at themselves if the production is a little off. No, the point is made from the outset that our community of post-war suburbanites is one of 'hopelessness' and 'emptiness'. This is the profound 'epiphany' that the makers of Revolutionary Road want us to experience and they are going to reveal these 'profound insights' to us. But the truth is, there is no such thing as suburban 'angst'--back then and now the vast majority of people have egos--in short, they like themselves!

Those who have written negative things about Revolutionary Road seem to agree that there is little character development when it comes to April Wheeler. When Helen Givings (Kathy Bates) tells April that she always felt she was someone 'special', the camera comes in close and we see the blank expression on her face. April is not to be blamed for her depression--society has made her into what she is. It's a trite idea that people are not responsible for their own lives but that's what Revolutionary Road serves up here. April is a Bohemian, a free spirit whose main goal is to move to Paris. For half the movie, her plan of liberation is about the only thing we find out about her. Certainly we find out nothing about her personality vis--vis her children--they are barely seen in this film and can be best thought of as a set of props in this overblown passion play.

Additional 'props' can be found in the characters of the Wheelers' neighbors, Shep and Millie Campbell. When April and Frank tell them of their plans to move to Paris, they later deride them in the comfort of their own bedroom as ""immature"". The film's scenarists wish us to identify them as being arrogant and part of the overall suburban 'emptiness'. Shep loses further points when he beds April just before her final breakdown.

One wonders why Frank is so easily convinced by April to chuck his house and job and run off to Paris with her and the kids. After all, he screams at her for her illusions of becoming a great actress in the opening scene. But somehow she appeals to his earlier idealistic desires to be free and independent before the kids came along. In the blink of an eye, the empty and uncaring suburbanite who has no compunctions about bedding the new pretty office worker suddenly is transformed into a caring, self-actualized mensch who will go along with his wife's bold plan to go where no other suburban couple has gone before.

Don't despair, Frank returns to his vile ways quite soon enough. With a job promotion hanging over his head and the news that April is pregnant, he decides to 'sell out'. Aha, we've finally found out who the antagonist is in this film! Fortunately there is one bright note in Revolutionary Road and that is Michael Shannon's electroshock victim, John Givings. John is basically an ally of April since they both don't fit into society and are labeled as deviant (note that at one point, Frank recommends that April see a shrink!). Before Frank 'sells out', he and April have a nice 'heart-to-heart' talk with John in the woods who echoes the film's theme: people in suburbia might 'get' emptiness but April and (pre-sell-out) Frank 'feel' hopelessness. The non-conformist blesses the free-spirit couple for their 'bravery'. But once Frank takes the new job and decides not to go to Paris, he is the recipient of John's full wrath. A real person would have parried John's blows with perhaps a sense of humor, but since Frank is merely a stand-in for all the ills of suburbia (and hence American society), he comes off as arrogant, defensive and with a severe anger management problem.

The only truly enjoyable moment in Revolutionary Road is when John turns on April for a millisecond. After berating Frank, he whispers in HER ear and tells her in effect that maybe she's no great shakes either! The suggestion that maybe April is not an angel is short-lived. Before you know it, April has done herself in by means of a self-induced abortion. Our beloved bohemian is now enshrined as sacrificial lamb.

Ironically, Revolutionary Road is well-acted and directed. What's more the art design of the film, with its attention to period detail, is a work to behold. The score, while repetitious, is also haunting. But somehow the histrionics of the principal characters do not impress since people are not like that in real life. Stories about people living 'lives of quiet desperation' is not only a myth but 'old hat'. The 'Road' is more empty than the mythic society it creates and attempts to tear down.",1249344000,,5775,4.833164812942366

This could've been just another sad soap opera, but what sets it aside is the superlative acting of Winslet and di Caprio, and excellent support from Michael Shannon, Kathy Bates & Dylan Baker. I will not blab away the plot, as others did, but paying attention to the characters can only make you marvel in the talent displayed.

Why?  Because their privileged lives aren't privileged enough.  They don't just want it all, they want it all and fame too.  Without doing anything interesting to earn it, with no hobbies or passions, or real skills,  they somehow feel like if they just relocate to a magical Paris, they'll become famous -- for what, they don't know.  But they know they deserve that too, and they can't be happy with out it.

A more spoiled, stupid set of people, I could not imagine. Had they moved to Paris, they would have soon discovered that changing locations wouldn't change them -- they'd soon be as bored and self destructive in Paris, and probaby a lot poorer and less privileged in Paris, and once the novelty of the location wore off they'd be even more unhappy. Unless actually having to struggle a little woke them up.

I watched a little of the commentary and they talked about the lives of quiet desperation, how this was a tragic love story, and I just had to laugh -- it was the only laugh in the movie.  The tragedy is not that these characters were trapped in suburbia -- the tragedy is that they never seemed to understand that life is largely the moments in between the big events in our lives, not the big events themselves. The tragedy is not that these people missed out on their big chance in life to grab more.  The tragedy is that they couldn't make a life with all they had.  And that neither the characters, the actors, or the director had a clue, even after making this ridiculous exercise in self indulgence.

3399852,4,B0016Q2D66,"Revolutionary Road is a depiction of the pointless, empty lives that seemingly successful Americans were leading in the 1950's. Today, not much has changed, and there's never a bad time to perk up and pay attention. Based upon an acclaimed book written over thirty years ago, Revolutionary Road is a study in relationships, character, and existence, most of which are illusions cobbled together by disappointments and a little bit of genuine joy. That joy keeps us going, even though we're bitter, wounded, uncertain, and keeping at bay as best we can alienation, anomie, and moral unwinding.  I'm not sure there is any filmmaker today that puts on a better show about these ideas.  Together with American Beauty, Revolutionary Road is a sure-handed dissection of all the things that make the cozy upper-middle class insufferable and, ultimately, not redeemable. We're playing house as a wonderful pass-time to avoid truly living -- so much so, that really experiencing our lives seems more and more like some wishful daydream.

There is no joyful or redemptive ending. In comparison, American Beauty is a sweet Jolly Rancher of optimism -- which in many ways it is. Nor is it perfect. In trying to add subtlety and complexity to the characters, some clarity was lost -- but, I don't necessarily fault Mendes for that.  One thing that's for certain is that nothing is clear about life. Like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Revolutionary Road gets into the mechanics of who we are alone and in relationships -- why we can't live with them, and can't, seemingly, live without them. And Kate Winslet, the common thread in both of those films, shines as a bright woman just looking for some peace of mind and a little stretch of happiness.

3399860,3,B0016Q2D66,"""Revolutionary Road,"" based on the 1961 novel by Richard Yates, juxtaposes appearances and contentment with the hidden, underlying unhappiness that threatens to dismantle lives.  This is a somber, dark film about a 1950's suburban couple, April and Frank Wheeler (Kate Winslet, Leonardo Di Caprio), who are ill at ease and dissatisfied with their so-called perfect life.  Frank hates the job he commutes to five days a week.  April finds her days long and empty.  Both feel life is passing them by too quickly and long for something more.

They decide relocating to Paris is just the thing to energize them both.  April will get a high-paying job as a government agency secretary while Frank takes time to think about what he'd like to do.  Their savings will see them through several months.  Initially elated by their decision to uproot themselves and their two children to start a new life overseas, they meet with circumstances that create serious obstacles.

The Wheelers are unhappy not so much with each other but with the feeling that their suburban life has not been the satisfying goal they expected it to be.  Winslet and Di Caprio have a number of heavy-duty verbal fights that ring true, thanks to Sam Mendes' on-the-money direction.  April is a woman trapped in a life of her own making -- a life that has let her down.  It's not as easy as chalking it up to a marriage gone sour.  She still loves Frank, and that is part of her tragedy.  She wants more for both of them, and is desperate for a way out.

Michael Shannon co-stars as the son of a real estate agent (Kathy Bates) who has recently been released from a mental institution.  His character is the one person who sees things more ""normal"" people -- even the Wheelers -- are blind to.  Mr. Shannon was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this role.

Bonus extras include commentary by director Sam Mendes, a making-of featurette, and deleted scenes.  The Blu-ray edition contains the biographical profile, ""Richard Yates: The Wages of Truth.""",1247270400,,2027,4.789625360230548
3399861,1,B0016Q2D66,"Revolutionary Road hinted at the social revolution that has swept away any vestige of the ""horribly oppressive 50s."" But it struck me as a simple screed meant to indoctrinate the thoughtless into the joys of modern selfishness.

My wife and I thought we'd enjoy this movie as it dealt with questions many of us face in the suburban life style epitomized by the 50s. But soon we saw this as something else. A thinly veiled attack against much what we hold dear. Things like marriage, friends, family, children and our attempt at relationship with our creator. Let's take them one at time;

Marriage. There are enough reviews posted to give a good overview of the movie. It depicts a marriage as the representation of the oppressive 50s model, in which the heroine is trapped. Trapped in her modern, convenient home with her well adjusted children and dutiful husband. How horrible! And she can't even work! ""But if we can just move to Paris and there I (big I) can support the family then all will be well."" Please...

Friends. April and Frank's friends are depicted universally as idiots. I wonder why the hang around with them? His work partners are dull, bored, one-dimensional losers. Their neighbors are morons. The only one with a lick of sense is a recently released lunatic. Is this how the author sees his life I wonder?

Family. No hint of family outside the nuclear here. April and Frank love each other when they are not having sex with their neighbors. April loves her born children but the unborn one? Strictly viewed as an impediment to her dream. I mean strictly! There is not a hint of anything other than a vain MAN who thinks abortion impolite to form any sort of moral argument against this act. However, in the end we see April lose her life due to the ugly and ignorant conventions of the day against abortion. Such melodrama!

Children. One bright spot in the movie are their two born children who, when around, are depicted well. Problem is there is almost always some device to remove them from the scene so the couple can go on in their orgy of selfishness.

The Creator. Like most movies there is no hint of God nor any question of God's existence or non  existence. The God-Factor is completely removed making this a typically paper thin, one dimensional presentation. I take that back, there is one background sound track of ""Going to the chapel."" No realization in the film however, nor any attempt, which I believe virtually anyone would make when faced with the immense pressures the couple is under, to seek some spiritual help. I guess that only in Hollywood do you find ""atheists in the foxholes.""

Overall this movie was beyond disappointing. It left me angry and frustrated. I do not like to be indoctrinated by Hollywood. I do not like to be told how horrible and oppressive life was before liberals took over. I don't believe it. I was there.",1247270400,7,2880,4.677865612648222

I don't hesitate to say that this is his best film since American Beauty and is almost the film's counterpart. While American Beauty portrayed the darkly comical underbelly of suburbia, Revolutionary Road shows the tragic, claustrophobic grip of it.

The setting is Eisenhower-era Connecticut, which is where Frank (DiCaprio) and April Wheeler (Winslet) live in a nice suburban home on Revolutionary Road. Having given up on their aspirations to raise their children, Frank works at Knox Business Machines (a job he hates) while April fills her position as housewife. Feeling smothered by the suburban lifestyle they're trapped in, April proposes that the family move to Paris. She wants to get away, but she also wants to give Frank a chance to find his passion. While their friends find the plan absurd, the Wheeler's are steadfast in their determination. But, as things begin to change, the Wheeler's see their dreams start to crumble right along with their marriage.

Don't expect too many surprises, I warn you. The film has an ominous musical score, reminiscent of American Beauty (fitting, as the same composer Thomas Newman scored both films) that clearly foreshadows things aren't going to play out in the happiest way. On the subject of music however, there is perfectly placed '50s era music scattered throughout the movie that marvelously puts us in this timeframe. The set direction (by Kristi Zea) and the costume design (by Albert Wolsky) are both perfect in the film. The beautiful recreation of 1950's suburbia perfectly contrasts the empty attitude of the character's.

The acting is, of course, the film's selling point. Winslet is a reliable actress that likely would've won her 2008-Oscar for this film had she not made&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Reader/dp/B001PPLJIQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Reader</a>. Not any actress could capture feelings of emptiness and claustrophobia in this performance, but Winslet does it flawlessly. A true actress Winslet is.

DiCaprio is one of the most successful actor's in Hollywood, but he's not without his detractors. His performance as Frank is a powerhouse of pent-up frustration and emotion. I think this is one of his best and certainly one of his most powerful performances. The two performances together are so vividly realized, you'll forget this is the ""Jack & Rose reunion."" They completely outshine those performances.

With all the star-power this film has backing it, the Academy only acknowledged one performance in this film. The character is John, the adult son of the Wheeler's neighbors who has only recently been allowed to leave the psychiatric hospital he's been staying at. The actor is Michael Shannon, who has only two scenes and a small amount of screen time. Shannon impressed me in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bug-Special-Edition/dp/B000T5O48K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bug (Special Edition)</a>, but I don't think he has previously been given a role that allowed him to really showcase his talent. As John, he makes quite an impression as the only person able to see right through the Wheeler's facade. He has the most powerful dialouge in the film and he is so stand-out, it's easy to see why the Academy singled him out among these other, well-known actors.

Revolutionary Road goes deep into the inner workings of suburbia, a crumbling marriage, and the unhappiness of these people. It doesn't explore these themes subtly, but gives the audience a very clear view into them. It's based on a 48-year-old novel by Richard Yates and was brought to the screen all these years later because it's still a very relevant story. Look no further for proof than the recent, overpublicized Jon & Kate debacle. This film is not a subtle meditation, it's a realistic exploration.

This is a beautiful, heartwrenching film...Definitely among the best films of 2008. It's powerful, effusive, and impressive considering the subject matter has the makings of a soap-opera and instead is a real human drama. While not a happy movie by any stretch of the imagination. I highly recommend this film.

3399863,2,B0016Q2D66,"Here's a movie that was hyped up quite a bit because it reunited the ""Titanic"" duo of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.  Who would have thought the reunion would have produced such a dud?

Essentially, this movie is like experiencing a protracted episode of cable tv's ""Mad Men"".  As a period piece, it simply doesn't work. It lacks any semblance of authenticity.

As others have pointed out in their reviews, DiCaprio struggles in adult roles because of his boyish appearance.  Any actor who could grow a convincing four o'clock shadow probably would have been better in the role.

The director seems to try to balance the importance of both DiCaprio's and Winslet's roles, but clearly the story should be more weighted towards Winslet.  When you break it down, this is not so much a story about a shipwrecked marriage as it is a portrait of a woman's unhappiness.

It's a story similar to Sylvia Plath's ""Bell Jar"", about a woman with a creative temperament who is stifled in a marriage, her personality ultimately spiraling towards madness.

But despite Winslet delivering what I would call a ""solid but not overly spectacular"" performance, the problem is that the movie is dull.  Neither character inspires much sympathy.

Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick were better in ""The Days of Wine and Roses"", as were Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" ""American Beauty"" is a far superior movie to this, and so probably is ""The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit"".

Much has been made of Kate Winslet's bravado as an actress. She had a very good year in 2008, and her role in ""The Reader"" was deservedly praised.  Kate's appearance seems to have taken on a hard cast, lately. I wish her more good roles, but I hope that the roles are not exclusively ""unhappy women"", and that they are more fully realized than this rather one-dimensional role in ""Revolutionary Road"".",1247097600,7,1890,4.832298136645963
3399864,5,B0016Q2D66,"""If my work has a theme, I suspect it is a simple one: that most human beings are inescapably alone, and therein lies their tragedy."" - Richard Yates on his novel, ""Revolutionary Road""

The above quote gives one a pretty good idea that ""Revolutionary Road"" is not a simplistic or feel-good film, rather a film that dares to imply that society is nave, misled, too quick to conform, and that people lack the courage to do what truly makes them happy because they are too concerned with comfort and safety.  It does this through the ""everyday"" couple, Frank and April Wheeler, and how it does so may touch a nerve or two in those who have ignored their hearts' desires or their discontent for the sake of sufficiency.

From the beginning, it is clear that the Wheelers' marriage is anything but happy.  They are shown meeting at a party for the first time, locking eyes across the room and then the movie swiftly centers on their present relationship in 1955, the two of them married with children and consumed by disillusionment.  April (Winslet) and Frank (DiCaprio) appear to be living the American dream, their comfortable lifestyle in suburban Connecticut possessing everything but the white picket fence.  Bubbling beneath the surface is Frank's dissatisfaction with his compliance to conformity, his identity lost in a job he could care less about in the effort to support his family.  April is equally dissatisfied with her role as a housewife, wanting something more exciting and meaningful.  The disappointment in their stations in life peaks when Frank has an affair with a secretary at his office the day after a nasty argument with April, only to be surprised that evening by his apologetic wife dressed in her best holding a cake.  She further stuns him with a proposal to move to Paris and Frank is dismissive of the idea at first, viewing it as impractical.  When April appeals to his ego by telling him that she will work to support the family while he spends time finding his true vocation, he warms to the idea and the move breathes optimism and romance back into their marriage.

Enthusiastic, the Wheelers begin telling their friends about their plan and are met with criticism.  Frank begins to cave from peer pressure and when he is offered a promotion at work, their plans growing shaky.  The clincher is April's unexpected pregnancy, an event that completely rules out Paris for Frank and has him taking the job offered to him.  Crushed by Frank's decision to keep them in the wearisome lifestyle that has made them so unhappy in the first place, April becomes cold and despondent and what hope their marriage had of repairing itself makes a quick and climactic crumble.

Great dramas ride high on illuminative dialogue and the execution of its main actors and both elements are in top form here - you'll rarely glimpse perfection like this, no matter how many films you watch in your lifetime.  There are movies I have watched and enjoyed but had little to say about them; ""Revolutionary Road"" differs in that I can't say enough.

Nearly everyone involved in this project was highly passionate about the material - most of them had read Yates's 1962 novel and commented on how well it was written, that it was among their favorite novels of all time.  Justin Haythe is among those people and his screenplay is outstanding - I found myself wanting to write down several lines I heard, so many of them quotable that I couldn't possibly put them all in this review (truthfully, I would love to have a copy of the entire screenplay).  Haythe borrowed heavily from the novel's own language as well as producing some wonderful material of his own, and I'm a little surprised that it didn't even get an Oscar nod (""Slumdog Millionaire"" won the Best Adapted category.  Again, WHY?).  The exchanges between April and Frank teeter back and forth from sympathetic and understanding to downright spiteful - some of their remarks towards one another are so cutting at times that the viewer feels stung by them just standing on the outside listening in.

In fact, I'm surprised that it didn't get more than three nominations total in 2008, among them Art Direction (courtesy of Kristi Zea and Debra Schutt, who brought the 1950's alive like never before - it's all in the little details) and Costume Design (I loved the majority of Winslet's wardrobe - simplistic and chic).  Perhaps the most surprising was an out-of-the-blue nomination for little-known actor Michael Shannon for his scene-stealing supporting turn as John Givings, a man who from the beginning speaks cold hard truths everyone knows but no one wants to hear.

Master cinematographer Roger Deakins is onboard this project and his ingenuity knows no bounds.  Sam Mendes, a director who loves to play with light and shadow, has a cooperation with Deakins that produces iconic imagery with stark contrast both visual and metaphorical.  For the actors, there is no soft lens - every wrinkle, crag, scar and physical imperfection is there for the world to see, making their characters more relative and real to their audience.  For the sets, sunlight brightens a cheery and conservatively decorated living room, clashing with the cluttered darkness of the Wheeler's marriage, giving the impression that all is not how it appears.  Shooting within the house, though significantly larger than houses in the 50's typically were, was still a challenge - Deakins squeezed himself into the confined rooms, neck and neck with the actors, creating a physical and psychological claustrophobia that radiates into the story and the performances.

DiCaprio and Winslet tear the house down as Frank and April Wheeler, their on-screen dynamic trumping that of their first collaboration in 1997's ""Titanic"" (of course, this film is of a completely different ilk and highly unromantic). Of their fight scenes, DiCaprio was quoted as saying, ""So much of what happens between Frank and April in this film is what's left unsaid. I actually found it a real joy to do those fight scenes because finally, these people were letting each other have it.""  Because he and Winslet are such great friends in real life, their portrayal of a husband and wife is highly believable and Winslet even had to take a moment to compose herself during one of their tougher scenes because DiCaprio had never been that angry and physically violent towards her before.  Though she won an Academy Award for her role in ""The Reader"" the same year, THIS is the better performance of the two by leaps and bounds.

While the actors are incredible, it is their characters that one becomes so frustrated with.  Though April and Frank struggle with the restrictions of their simplistic lifestyle, it is a prison of their own making and it gets hard for one to sympathize with them after a time, particularly because of their inability to communicate in a meaningful way and to come to a compromise of which both of them can be happy.  Frank is not a risk-taker and won't squeeze out of his societal niche for the sake of leisure, while April is too impractical in her desire to change things; one will come to wonder about her state of mind not only because of her manipulation but her extreme swings between highs and lows (bipolar) throughout the film.  Knowing how difficult they were finding it to see eye to eye after a time and that their feelings for each other had diminished to a certain degree, I don't know why they felt the need to stay together.  Divorce was certainly an option for them instead of what April chooses to do later on.

Bottom line: A dark and emotional journey through a dysfunctional marriage and how the choices we make in life can inspire or delude us, ""Revolutionary Road"" captures that truth of which so many of us choose to avert our eyes.  It is a film that will make a deep impact with those who thought - or knew better than - to trust our ideals.",1247011200,8,7908,4.81314623338257

When I first saw the trailer, I'll admit, despite a fantastic score, it seemed too ordinary.  What I didn't take into account, and foolishly now in hindsight, was the chemistry between two of our finest actors fueling every scene, word and glance.  Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio offer up a Master's class in acting. Just sit back and be mesmerized.  You believe every emotion that passes between these two.  Add a great supporting class (I found the repressed neighbors to be just as memorable as Michael Shannon), an incredible score, and confident, take-it-there direction, and you have my favorite movie of 2008.

3399866,3,B0016Q2D66,"It took 47 years to adapt for the screen Richard Yates' celebrated novel of the struggles that a young suburban couple faces living within the constraints of Eisenhower-era conformity. Even now, the resulting 2008 film, as meticulously directed by Sam Mendes, feels so internally driven that the story may be better suited for the stage or even TV.  In fact, it often feels a bit like an extended episode of the 1950's-set AMC series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mad-Men/dp/B000YABIQ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mad Men</a>, although the arguments between the protagonists bring to mind similarly visceral set pieces from Edward Albee's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Who-s-Afraid-of-Virginia-Woolf/dp/B000I2JDEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</a>&nbsp;Adapted by screenwriter Justin Haythe (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Clearing/dp/B0002XVKLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Clearing</a>), the plot focuses on Frank and April Wheeler, an attractive couple settled in a Connecticut suburb with two young children and seven years into a dysfunctional marriage. The time is 1955 well before professional counseling and divorce were viable options. The one attribute that the couple shares is the disillusionment each experiences with their daily lives, a far cry from the worldly aspirations they had when they first met at a Manhattan cocktail party.

Initially a frustrated actress, April is a creative person who is suffocating from her suburban domestic duties, while Frank is an even more aimless dreamer who hates his sales job at an IBM-like company. The story turns on April's sudden idea to move the family to Paris, where she plans to work as a government agency secretary while Frank figures out what he wants to do. He tentatively agrees, but it is her mounting desperation to hold onto her dream of living a bohemian life abroad that points to their emotional unraveling. Extramarital affairs prove to be the least of their problems, as each becomes entrenched in a deepening inability to empathize with or support one another. Communication between them turns into mutual provocations of emotional abuse. Mendes returns to familiar territory here, as there are vestiges of his debut film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Beauty/dp/B00003CWL6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Beauty</a>, in the often uncomfortable-to-watch marital discord he etches here. However, the tone is even more desultory this time with nary a trace of black humor to provide a counterbalance. All the period touches feel authentic with Roger Deakins' cinematography and Kristi Zea's production design contributing to an evocative feel that doesn't feel overly contrived. Thomas Newman's haunting score is another asset that enhances the dramatic elements.

This is the type of movie that provides a showcase for its principal actors. As April, Kate Winslet (Mendes' wife) manages to make a fundamentally selfish character sympathetic by throwing herself fearlessly and honestly into the role. Her former&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Titanic/dp/B000VS6R26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Titanic</a>&nbsp;co-star, Leonardo DiCaprio has proven to be an arresting actor in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Departed/dp/B000M341QE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Departed</a>, but his baby face and youthful demeanor really seem at odds with Frank's weakening emotional state and diminishing sense of self-worth. He comes to life during the many confrontation scenes, but he can't match Winslet's affinity with the heavy material. The supporting cast is solid - Kathy Bates (another&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Titanic/dp/B000VS6R26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Titanic</a>&nbsp;veteran) as unctuous real estate agent Helen Givings, Kathryn Hahn as the Wheelers' chipper neighbor Milly, David Harbour as her deceptively complacent husband Shep, Zoe Kazan as Frank's gullible secretary, and in just two sharply rendered scenes, Michael Shannon as Helen's mentally ill son and a powerfully uncomfortable harbinger for the tragedy to follow. The 2009 DVD has a standard set of extras - a mostly interesting audio commentary track from Mendes and Haythe, five deleted scenes, and principal cast and crew members contributing to an adequate half-hour making-of featurette, ""Lives of Quiet Desperation: The Making of Revolutionary Road"".",1246838400,3,4662,6.753743760399335
3399867,3,B0016Q2D66,"This movie doesn't work. It's an intellectualized, staged conception of ""quiet desperation."" It doesn't look or feel like real desperation. I can't imagine real people arguing this way or shifting moods this way. It's a professorial view of life that feels as if it had been written from an ivory tower, while its author looked down at an expanse of suburbia from an academic distance. All the intriguing details are invisible; only the broad patches of pattern are apparent.

So it sees only clich. It sees the clich that the 1950's were unbearably conformist, with husbands swimming upstream every morning to work like doomed salmon, while wives stayed home in crisp regiments of starched aprons. But if you had looked close and lived through the 50's, you would have found a very different, motley, messy reality.

There is also the clich of the real estate woman's son. Michael Shannon cast in this role does a very good job as the disturbed, truth-telling iconoclast. But again, his character plays into the trite, almost sitcom presumption that people who are or who have been in insane asylums can be counted on to deliver rude insights and raw wisdom.

There's not necessarily meant to be a clear-cut moral to this movie. However, the movie's sympathies are clearly with making a break from the life dealt to you. Director Mendes and the author of the book on which this movie is based both lean in favor of grabbing any chance to climb out of what, to them, is the inevitable rut of the workaday world. The message is that if you don't have the courage and tenacity to launch off somewhere - you'll be trapped and tragic.

However, that is the biggest clich of all. It overlooks the real detail of beauty inherent in the scene, in favor of the preconceived disdain of 1950's suburbia. If the Wheelers could have opened their eyes, they might have realized they had a gleaming interior, and a view of lovely dappled woods outside, in both a literal and a metaphoric sense. They might have seen that John's co-workers were affable, available beings, probably with rich back-stories of their own. They might have seen that they had a varied network of intelligent, potentially heartfelt people on their very doorstep.

I gave this movie three stars instead of something lower because the actors do make a good attempt to elevate their characters to some social importance. However, in the end, I couldn't care about these people, because they would have been incapable of caring about me. They wouldn't even have been able to find me interesting - unless they came upon me somewhere else, in some exotic, glamorous place - such as Paris.",1246752000,9,2643,4.812775330396476
3399868,5,B0016Q2D66,"Wow....that's what I was left saying after I watched the final credits roll up the screen at the end of this movie. Between Kate Winslet acting like a certified, yet somehow sane, nut and Leonard DiCaprio seamlessly playing the helpless husband racked with his own guilt, I felt totally satisfied about spending my well earned[..] on this movie, twice (yes, twice).
Now I must admit I think I've seen, like, one Kate Winslet movie ever before this, and I just recently started getting on the DiCaprio bandwagon after watching both The Departed and Blood Diamond in the same year (after that I was hooked on DiCaprio). But after watching Revolutionary Road, I was all aboard team Winslet. She was so captivating in this role, so emotional and raw and riveting all at once. This is one of those movies that you just have to see for yourself and derive your own meaning behind it. It just touched on so many different issues like love, the sanctity of marriage, forgiveness, rage, entrapment, loneliness and helplessness.
A young married couple try to live the normal suburban life like so many of their friends have and find out that, with that, comes its challenges, its heartbreak and its own imprisonment and solitude.

3399869,2,B0016Q2D66,"So the deal is that this is directed by Winslet's husband, Sam Mendes, famous for foisting American Beauty on us, and adapted from a novel set in 1955, but released in 1961, and supposedly so depressing it couldn't be adapted until NOW! So are you ready, party peoples?

We open with a short snippet at a NYC party where April, that's Kate, and Frank, that's Leo, meet and chat. Then we cut to April in a local production in which she is apparently awful. Afterward they have a horrible fight on the way home, and we see that when she's upset, April doesn't want to talk, and Frank NEEDS to talk. This is, however, not five minutes into the film. I sort of thought we would see their happy courtship before they moved to the suburbs and began to hate their lives, but no! Which can give you a momentary panic attack thinking ""Oh GOD, it's going to be two hours of straight misery, not a slow slide into misery."" And it kind of is and isn't.

So for the next few minutes we're jumping back and forth between their current lives and how they got here. We see a tiny bit more of the party, in which April tells Frank that he is the most interesting person she's ever met. We see them looking that the house in Connecticut that they end up buying. We see him taking the train to work in Manhattan, his suit beautifully photographed to look wonderful with the sea of guys in similar suits streaming into Grand Central. Meanwhile, April stays at home, raising the magical kids who appear and disappear at will. And over time they get more and more unhappy with their lives, feeling stilted and stifled.

April gets the idea to move to Paris. She says she'll work as a secretary and support the whole family, and Frank can be free to find himself, and discover what it is he wants to do. She says that ""our whole existence here is based on the idea that we're superior,"" i.e. sure , they LIVE in this suburban existence, but they're not OF it. They thought of themselves as better than their surroundings and the people around them, but they find themselves falling into the same petty concerns as the people they think they're better than. Frank isn't convinced of the Paris idea for a bit, but soon warms to it and excitedly tells everyone. One can see how the thought of moving overseas reignites their sense of superiority, brings them together, and gives them something to look forward to. One can also see that their plan is a little unrealistic.
At a certain point Kathy Bates as their neighbor Helen brings by her schizophrenic son, who responds to Frank and April's wish to move away. ""Many people see the emptiness,"" he says, ""But it takes real guts to see the hopelessness."" Once he leaves they say to each other ""He's the first person who understands what we're talking about.""

But eventually, no spoiler, their Paris dream is put on permanent hold, Frank is getting promoted and getting into his job a little bit, and the old rifts open up--and just get worse. The ending was said to be emotionally devastating but, well, not to me. And that's it.

Both DiCaprio and Winslet are great. They both convey a great deal of their emotion and character arc with their silent expressions and body language--they both just give very advanced and intelligent performances. The direction is smooth and seamless, barely noticeable, but effective and professional. Mendes effectively gets a lot of mileage out of their perfect house and the hidden menace of their furnishings. Cinematographer Roger Deakins gets rich, painterly colors out of the clothes and environments, and subtle tricks like having April's shirt being matched perfectly to the wall color, so it seems that she is literally being absorbed into the house, are effective.

The problem is that this novel came out in 1961, and I don't think very much updating was done to create this script. And in the meantime, a lot of very similar material has come out and made its impression--not least of which was American Beauty. Which is not to say that this stuff isn't true or effective, it's just that its view seems a little nave--like one from the 60s, not one from 2008. We see almost nothing of the Wheeler's life before they got married, when they supposedly developed the sense of superiority that becomes such a stumbling block for them. I would have liked to have seen what their lives were like before, to have more of a sense of where they're coming from, and fill out their psyches a bit more. We see them drink and smoke a lot, but we never see them watch television. We never see April clean the house, although it remains immaculate. We never know what she thinks about keeping the house clean, being a forward-thinker as she is. We never find out why she decided to just stay home and do nothing, if she has such an active mind. We never find out why they moved to the suburbs in the first place--why didn't they just stay in the city? Especially if being culturally engaged is so important to them. Why don't they move BACK to the city? Easier than going to Paris. The net result of this is that for all the intimacy we have with these characters, there are several key areas in which we don't know or understand them.

And the movie can only throw in so many expository lines [""Oh, they're at a birthday party""] to cover up the fact that the two kids VANISH for long, long periods of time.

With the focus so closely on the Wheeler's, we're left to wonder why their relationship has so many problems, while others' are working. Is everyone else just stupid? Just not as engaged or once alive as April and Frank? Well, we'd have to see some sense of how engaged or alive they once were in order to know that, and that information isn't here. The movie ignores this question until the final moments, in which it throws out two short answers: the couple across the street are shown deciding not to talk about the things that bother them, and in the portentous and cynical final image, Bates' husband slowly turns the volume on his hearing aid down while his wife talks. Those are your options if you want a successful marriage, folks! Ignore your problems or literally tune each other out!

Oh, and the music is obnoxious. Every few seconds the same cue: slowly rising strings, then a few gentle piano chords. Repeat 1,200 times.
Regardless, the performances are good, and that kind of makes it worth seeing. I've never seen DiCaprio be better or more soulful. Winslet is of course brilliant [though more astounding in The Reader], and it certainly isn't a waste of time. It is, however, strikingly inessential. It's a pity they couldn't have updated and widened the scope of the novel a little more to make it less of a hermetic conversation piece from an earlier time.",1246233600,21,6741,4.578293289146645

3399875,5,B0016Q2D66,"Familiarity breeds contempt, but contempt also comes out of complacency and conformity as well.  The plot of ""Revolutionary Road"" is what happens when the institution of marriage becomes more of an institution then a marriage.  One must remember in 1950's America that the divorce rate was significantly lower then what it is now.  However, that is not to mean that relationships were less troublesome nor were people less dysfunctional.  It merely means that society had more built in pressures in 1955 to at the least 'keep up appearances.'  Therefore, a loveless marriage in the mid 20th century could be maintained for many more years then what it is now in the early 21st.  ""Revolutionary Road"" follows the path less taken of an ordinary couple who eventually break through of their bourgeois pressures, but at the end the price is too much to bear.

The movie takes place during the zenith of Post-War American power, or what John Kenneth Galbraith called ""The Affluent Society.""  Mr. DiCaprio's character has enormous earning potential, and he can decide to melt away into surburban bliss, and his wife (played by Ms. Winslett) can decide to go that route too, but they decide that materialism may not be what they both want, and they decide to pack up and move to Paris.  Of course, as the the externalities of mortgage, children, money and time constrict, this plan is quickly scrapped, and everything begins to melt away.  As everything begins to disintegrate, the house (which serves as almost a secondary character) begins to shrink.  An observant viewer can almost see this happen due to the brilliant cinematography in this film.

Part of the reason this movie is so heart wrenching is that it is so very relevant to marriage now.  In 1999 Mendes captured Clinton-era surburban angst in American Beauty, he captures it much more eloquently and elaborately in this film set during the supposedly placid Eisenhower era.  Whereas 'Beauty' watched a marriage decay in post-middle age, ""Road"" captures it before middle age, where the characters are closer to the beginning of their life, then the end of it.  Part of the reason why this movie is so searing is that because these characters know each other too well, they can stick the knife in where it will do the most damage.  Unlike Mr. Spacey and Ms. Benning's characters in ""American Beauty"" one can cheer for the Wheeler's to break out of the emptiness of their lives.  However, the movie also begs the question: what good would Paris do?  Would it still reveal themselves to be nothing more then the people who meet a tragic end in Connecticut?  Or, would it reinvigorate them and let them start their lives over.

In Bob Dylan's new album he writes that 'dreams never did work for me anyways...even when they did come true.""  The true tragedy of the film is is that the characters will never know what their dreams may have held in store, and at the end they will be fated to become an old man and old woman in their living rooms babbling about nonsense, and turning down their hearing aids.  The question one must answer after watching this movie is, would it really have mattered?",1245542400,,3149,4.803339517625232
3399876,4,B0016Q2D66,"You spend your life learning to live with your own limitations and how they apply to practical life. Then you fall in love, you're mutually smitten by each other's ideals of yourselves... and suddenly, in the real world, you have to live with somebody else's unfamiliar, incomprehensible limitations as if they were your own.

At first glance, ""Revolutionary Road"" appears to be about the dark malaise beneath superficial success in 1950s suburbia; but I think it really chronicles something that happens in all times and places. We love the best in someone, but we live one whole person with another, and sometimes the compromise is more than we can bear.

A related element in the film is the realization that, as George Carlin once quipped, ""Most people aren't particularly good at anything."" Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and April (Kate Winslet) both reluctantly see that this is true of themselves; but April struggles to hold on to the belief that it need not be true of Frank, and loses respect for Frank when he no longer believes it himself.

I can't call this a great movie, but it's certainly a good one. It effectively examines a fundamental problem of human life: that the inspiration for love comes from an ideal, but the art of love lies in making peace with the realities of two people who are inevitably less than they hope to be.

3399879,5,B0016Q2D66,"""Revolutionary Road"" was adapted from Richard Yates' 1961 novel about one couple's struggle with post-War middle class ideals in a picture-perfect Connecticut suburb. Set in the mid-1950s, we see the strained marriage of April and Frank Wheeler, an aspiring actress and former longshoreman who initially shared a keen sense of adventure, a vitality that has waned since they had children and moved to the suburbs. Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) takes the train to work in New York each day with thousands of men like him. April (Kate Winslet) stays home, minds the children, chats with neighbors, and becomes increasingly frustrated with her circumscribed life. So she proposes that they give it all up, move overseas, and immerse themselves in life again. At first, Frank agrees, but then the struggle to balance security, happiness, and social pressures begins.

The 1950s were a conformist time, an era when the American middle class ideal was defined especially narrowly. Of course, people like the Wheelers led comfortable lives, for which perhaps they should have been grateful. Comfort and security are nothing to sneeze at. On the other hand, the stifling social environment and rigid value system fashionable at the time had ugly side effects: mind-numbing boredom, shallowness, isolation, hypocrisy, and alcoholism among them. What strikes me about ""Revolutionary Road"" is how contemporary it is. America entered another conformist era in the 1990s, one that I estimate is more conformist than the 1950s, as the middle class is larger, careerism is taken more seriously, and rigid and often bizarre expectations are now extended to children.

In an interesting twist, it is April, a mother of two young children, who wants to give up her comfortable home and take on a job to feel like she is still alive. But her willingness to take the situation in hand unintentionally emasculates Frank, who has slipped more easily into the constraints of middle class ambition. Or perhaps he is genuinely excited by the prospect of a promotion and higher pay. Frank has a compulsion to talk about everything, but he never says what he thinks. ""Revolutionary Road"" was directed by Sam Mendes and filmed on location inside a suburban Connecticut house. This is helpful, as the audience is placed in April's world, surrounded by walls, with windows overlooking the quaint yards of neighboring homes, and unruly woods out back where freedom seems to reign. Two outstanding performances by Winslet and DiCaprio are complimented by a sharp supporting cast, including Kathy Bates, Dylan Baker, and Michael Shannon.

The DVD (Paramount 2009): There are 5 deleted scenes with optional commentary, one featurette, and an audio commentary. ""Lives of Quiet Desperation: The Making of Revolutionary Road"" (29 min) interviews the director, cast, producers, screenwriter Justin Haythe about the film's themes, production designer Kristi Zea about the office and house sets, and costume designer Albert Wolsky. The audio commentary is by director Sam Mendes and screenwriter Justin Haythe. They compare the final cut of the film to a preliminary cut, the film to the novel, talk about characters, filming on location, and the challenges of dramatizing Frank's interior, since his thoughts were expressed in the book.

Their quiet disatisafction culminates with Frank's 30th birthday when he has an affair with the secretary from his firm and April's own desire to reconnect with her own youth and her unfulfilled dreams.

On the whim, they decide to start new life in Europe.  They want to break with all social conventions of the time and reconnect with each other and find their own dreams in the process.  But as life never goes according to the plan, neither does their pact to go to Europe.  Outside world and social conventions continue to interfere, until it all falls apart. Irrevocably.

That said, it is a great movie if you can enjoy an intense drama. It has well-written dialogue, wonderful acting, and many tense moments. The story is truly realistic, one which almost anyone can relate to.

Set in the mid-50s, it focuses on the Wheelers, a regular middle-class couple with two children who live in a nice house in the suburbs. Frank has an office job which he dislikes while April is frustrated staying at home with the children. April unsuccessfully tries to pursue her dream of being an actress. Seeing how unsatisfied they both are, April suggests they move to Paris where she can work as a secretary while Frank takes time to figure out what he really wants to do in life. Things don't go quite as planned when different complications arise and even their commitment to each other gets questioned.

How many people are stuck in jobs they dislike? How many people feel trapped even after they achieve the dream of a nice suburban house with children and a reliable income? Yes, the movie has a depressive edge, but it is relatable and makes you stop and look at life. Is it possible to drop everything and move to another continent to start again?

Zastanawiajaca wydaje sie byc odwaga Mendesa ktory w obliczu swojego malzenskigo zwiazku z Winslett, podejmuje sie drazyc bytowe fatum, gdzie dylemat samo-spelnienia jest przeciwstawiony akceptacji spolecznie narzuconych rol zyciowych.

Kate Winslet is a fine actress but she looked like DiCaprio's mother and not a particulrly attractive mother at that.  DiCaprio looked about 18, as usual, and didn't seem to really have a grip on the role. And Kathy Bates and her family, including the brutally honest and more than slightly wacked out son, did not seem to make a lot of sense in the story--maybe as a sort of Greek chorus.  I found them unnecessarily intrusive.

I thought the depressing atmosphere of the 50's was quite well done--the sort of desperation that a lot of women felt being stuck at home and the complete inability of their spouses to understand their frustration. However, since there were virtually no lighter moments in the film, the unremitting gloom and hostility pervaded and, together with the grim ending, left you, or at least left me, completely depressed.

----------------------------------------
After their doomed romance on the Titanic, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are reincarnated as an idealistic young couple trapped in a suburban bungalow during the stifling conformity of Eisenhower-era America. It's like a remake of ""The Shining,"" is Arthur Miller had written the script. A lot of critics went ga-ga over this film; I thought it was okay although it's clearly a Hollywood film that desperately wants to be arty and meaningful. It's definitely evocative of the psychology-based dramas of the 1940s and '50s... with swearing and abortion thrown in for good measure. As in ""Titanic,"" DiCaprio and Winslet are mismatched: she is a much better actor than he is, and they don't actually have that much chemistry between them. But, whatever. It's an okay movie.

3399890,5,B0016Q2D66,"Growing up in the 50's I see a lot of similarities in the predicament this couple find themselves in and the predicament a great number of couples find themselves in during this time period all over the U.S. following WWII and the Korean war and the rise of Hollywood glamour and the promises of the industrial age. A time when Westinghouse and Better Homes and Garden were household words and men were encouraged to bring home the bacon while women were encouraged to be good little house wives and provide a cozy little home and encourage her husband in his daily struggle foraging in the jungle for food. I particularly enjoyed the superb photography. The herd mentality of the fifties exemplified by an army of men all dressed alike in hats , ties and briefcases coming over the horizon as if going to war made its point. This was also the era where corporations began slashing male jobs in order to replace them with less expensive housewives using promises of high paying positions as a carrot. One thing I noticed was the constant reference to communications. Being able to deliver a great sales pitch was considered an asset but in the end it simply turned out to be just a lot of words and empty promises and the only way one can avoid it was to turn it off and tune out. Oh, did I fail to mention how important image was and how people were more concerned with what the neighbors would say than their own lives and how busybodies took advantage of this and used it to fleece people trying to get ahead in life. Being a model couple was the name of the game. and social climbing was the only way a woman could fulfill her need for attention. This was also a time when the industrial/military complex began taking a toll on people's lives. ""Barefoot, pregnant and in the kitchen"", a cliche of the women's movement was also a theme of the movie and the myth on what it meant to be a man from an insecure woman's point of view. The scene of the bread winner trying to explain how the new computer being made up of hundreds of vacuum tubes was exemplifying the lives of people in that era living a life in a vacuum as was the mentally ill mathematician whose memory of what he loved to do was erased from his memory through electroshock treatment so he couldn't even recall what he loved to do anymore.

The movie documents their struggles and the couples inevitable downfall.

3399898,3,B0016Q2D66,"I have not read the book, so I can only comment on the movie itself. Frankly, ""Revolutionary Road"" is a depressing movie from start to finish. The story centers on Frank and April Wheeler, a nice couple residing in suburban CT and apparently living the American dream, not. April [Kate Winslet in a gut-wrenching performance] is a stifled personality, feeling neither joy or fulfillment in raising her two kids or in her marriage. She wishes to break free from the confines of suburbia and all that it entails, and hits upon a plan - get Frank [Leo Caprio] to give up his humdrum job, pack the family up and move to France, where she is convinced that she can earn a good living as a secretary [she keeps harping on the fact that secretaries get paid really well in Europe] whilst Frank figures out what he really wants to do.

This is a movie about two truly lost souls - both Frank and April aren't really sure what they want, and just feel that they're missing something, which is undefined. As a viewer, it was hard for me to connect emotionally with either character, and more so April than Frank. April is a character that is so consumed by misery that she literally sets herself on a self-destructive path, but it is hard to understand why this seemingly intelligent, beautiful woman can be so unhappy. She has two lovely children whom she doesn't spend much time with [throughout the movie, the kids are either sporadically present or not at all], she takes no pleasure in her beautiful home or surroundings, she chafes in social situations [like there's someplace better she'd rather be] and just appears miserable throughout the movie [except instances where she's packing up, hoping to leave for that beacon of light, Paris]. The only thing I could come up with was that April was clinically depressed, but even then, no one reaches out to her, especially her husband. This is never touched upon in the movie [perhaps because such things were not acknowledged back in the 50s?].

Besides the themes of an unhappy marriage and unfulfilled lives, there are other underlying themes here such as mental illness [Michael Shannon in a remarkably illuminating supporting role], abortion [back when such procedures were illegal, leading to some tragic actions and consequences], adultery, and depression. Given such dark themes, it was inevitable that ""Revolutionary Road"" would be such a depressing watch.

I loved the acting - both Kate Winslet and Leo de Caprio shine in their tormented roles, as does Michael Shannon as the mentally unbalanced mathematician with much foresight. But given how disconnected I felt to the characters being portrayed, I can only give this movie 3* at best. Only recommended to those who can stomach a dark ride into the human soul.",1244419200,3,2768,4.847780126849894

We see the Wheeler couple's marriage falling apart - Kate Winslet in phenomenally difficult, but rather unsympathetic role and Leo DiCaprio, very naturally playing a guy who tries hard but his everyman character is just not good enough for his wife. Stuck in the 1950's, their lives are unsatisfying, going to Paris seems as the only way out. Ironically - and most similarly to ""American Beauty"" - the only person who sees through the Wheeler facade is the man confined to mental institution (Michael Shannon in a revelation role). The potential of Richard Yates' praised novel is widely said to be filmed not so fully as it should have been - maybe the film's characters are too bookish to ring true.

Richard Yates' novel about the fragility of married commitment in 1955 has been very successfully transformed to the screen by writer Justin Haythe, director Sam Mendes and a perfect cast of actors.  All of the soured expectations of that period gel in this superb film - a movie that is difficult to watch at times, mostly because it rings so very true.

Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and April (Kate Winslet) Wheeler move to Connecticut from New York when the addition of children to their lives of thwarted expectations alter their once dreamy plans for their future.  Once in the 'just perfect' little suburb and living in a just perfect little house sold to them by real estate agent
Helen Givings (Kathy Bates) - who has a grown son John (Michael Shannon) who is in a mental institution and has undergone multiple shock therapy treatments that allow him to see things as they are no matter how cruel or rude his views - Frank settles for life in the Knox Business Machines Company, reluctantly following in the footsteps of his father while April attempts to rationalize her dreams of being an actress by appearing in an unimpressive amateur theatrical group.  From the opening frames of this claustrophobically suffocating new life the once happy couple shows signs of deterioration of a marriage.  The manner in which they couple attempt to dramatically change their boring life is destroyed by the realities of their situation: another pregnancy plays a significant role in the downward spiral of Frank and April's future and we as viewers are forced to watch the castle crumble.

Winslet and DiCaprio are excellent in the lead roles, offering the type of sensitive acting skills that pull the audience into the film.  The supporting roles by Kathy Bates, Michael Shannon, David Harbour, Richard Easton and Kathryn Hahn are cameos worthy of praise.  Every aspect of the film recreates the 1955 era and in some ways that 'distance' makes observing the film emotionally more tolerable.  This is a sad story that has no redeeming end.

April wallows in narcissitic despair and a silly escape plan, while Frank, who wants to help, has no idea what to do with either his wife or himself.  To a certain extent, we are all prisoners of the culture we live in, but some do have the ability and wherewithal to rise above it and create something of value.  In Far From Heaven, one at least could believe that Cathy Whitaker(if not her husband) and Raymond Deagan had the vision and fortitude to overcome their fate.

There's alot of angst and inner turmoil within these characters. Everything is done subtlely...but deeply felt.
The 1950's were on many levels about conformity and not bucking
the status quo...at least for the adults of that time!
The kids were on another page!
(i.e. Rock-n-Roll, James Dean, Elvis, etc.)
It ends on a very sad and unexpected note that left me kind
of up in the air, but I have to give it 4 stars on the strength
of the acting and subject matter. It's not for everyone,
but it's still a quality film.
The actor who played (John) the mental patient who comes
over and completely sees through all their BS gave
a great & hilarious performance as well!
I loved what he brought to it!
Like an idiot savant/soothsayer who you'd like to
strangle because he won't shut the hell up! (-:",1244246400,,1595,4.484536082474227
3399907,3,B0016Q2D66,"Andaluz nails it in the review, saying that it is tiresome to watch these people fight and carry on when they really don't have it so bad.  They are so overwrought and picking fights and pushing each other's buttons that it becomes overwhelming after a very short time.  The first fight that we see, after April performs in a play, seems to come out of nowhere and to have no context.  But then, having the context and the backstory later doesn't even help all that much.  Also, the music is too loud and rather pervasive and distracting at times.

On the plus side, the photography of the lovely yet sterile-looking homes and the washed-out faces is absolutely appropriate for the subject matter and tone of the film.  A late scene with April trying to perform a procedure on herself at home is especially haunting.  Winslet and DiCaprio can't be faulted for doing the best they can with what they're given.

It's just hard to give much of a care about two folks who create their own problems and are their own worst enemies.",1244160000,6,1026,4.5683060109289615
3399908,4,B0016Q2D66,"It's 1955, and Frank and April Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) are a successful, young suburban couple.  They also both feel doomed in their lives; he hates his job and she always wanted to be an actress but ended up an ordinary housewife. Excitement does come back into their lives, however, when they decide to move to Paris and do all the things they once wanted to do, but life has a way of spoiling even the best of plans.

Based on Richard Yate's seminal novel about suburban discontent, the movie has the same plot but lacks the author's sly, witty observations acknowledging the irony of people being unfulfilled amid relative luxury, luxury made possible by rigidly conforming to the expectations of society.  DiCaprio and Winslet both do competent jobs; he has a more sympathetic role, looking quite young but handsome, while she plays a desperate shrew, looking much older and being the only woman in the cast not to have the 50's look in hair and make-up.  The period is otherwise wonderfully reproduced and the movie is photographed with a lot of natural sunlight that gives a yellowed, washed-out look, befitting a story about hopelessness.

While not as memorable as the novel, the movie is still a well-made character study.  Because there isn't much action, it feels like a staged play much of the time and it's hard to feel sorry for people who seem to have it all and still want more.  As a couple, Leo and Kate don't recreate the romantic magic of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Titanic/dp/B00000JLWW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Titanic</a>, but they do prove to be fine actors.",1244160000,,1654,5.149253731343284
3399909,1,B0016Q2D66,"CONTAINS SPOILERS

Kate Winslet and LDC are two of my favorite performers, so I went into this movie with high expectations. From the point of view of sets, camera work, acting, overall artistic merit, the movie is great. However, I also want to feel good after watching a movie, and its my fault I didn't find out enough about this one before watching it. Besides offering commentary on how marriage can turn out when dyadic adjustment to the partnership fails, for me the movie really attacked the American Dream in an unbalanced way, although for sure there is truth for some people in the situation portrayed. Additionally, the second wave, confrontational feminist undertones (why does she have to conform to the feminine, housewife role instead of pursuing her own career?, and if abortion were legal at that time she probably would not have lost her life) again take a swipe at traditional American values in a biased way. There were plenty of people very happy with the American Dream as it manifested in the 1950s, not everybody falls prey to adultery so easily, and not all women want to burn their bras. Add to all of that the very nasty ending and that's why I was left reeling, wishing I hadn't even started watching. For me, if I want to see misery, I can observe plenty of it out there in the real world, and I don't want it turning up in the movies I watch. I like to see things resolved nicely, and I want to walk away feeling happy, like there's hope, like life can be good. Again, it was my fault for not researching the movie thoroughly beforehand, but if you watch movies for the same kinds of reasons that I do, you might want to stay well clear of this one.",1244160000,8,1680,4.508196721311475
3399910,4,B0016Q2D66,"In this film version of the Richard Yates novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revolutionary-Road/dp/B0016Q2D66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revolutionary Road</a>, we visit mid-twentieth century suburbia, and follow the lives of a young couple, portrayed by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio.  An excellent supporting cast includes Kathy Bates as a somewhat annoying realtor.

Having read the book, I found the film slightly disappointing, in that it didn't seem to delve as deeply into the issues.  However, I am always a fan of Kate Winslet (and Kathy Bates), so for those reasons, I do applaud this film and recommend it to anyone who is a fan of both (or either), as well as those who enjoy watching Leonardo DiCaprio.

Basically, the film, like the book, addresses the angst that often befalls suburbanites, especially during this particular time in midcentury suburbia.  These two people feel that they have not quite lived up to their special attributes - after all, they were destined for something MORE - but unhappily, they are still plagued by boredom, disillusionment, and that ever-present feeling of ""is this all there is?""

What happens next, to stir things up a bit, is certainly predictable - extramarital dalliances, followed by a last-ditch attempt to shake things up a bit, and then, finally, an unexpected pregnancy that throws a wrench into their best-laid plans.

What will they do?  Will the husband and wife reconnect, or will their plans go awry?

Unexpected tragedy turns their worlds on end and reminds us all that life often dishes out more than we think we can handle.

3399911,5,B0016Q2D66,"For me a good movie isn't necessarily one that is simply fun to sit through as much as one that makes me reflect and draw meanings that I can use -- or relate to -- in my own life.  For me, this movie highlights the futility, the emotional void, the boredom of living a self-centered life.  While the film seemed to be about the inner conflict of following one's heart in spite of the fear and the unknown vs. the pull towards safety and tradition and conformity, it really is not.  I related to the desire to go to Paris because for the past year I have thought long and hard about taking a one year round-the-world adventure, leaving the comfort and safety of the world I know.  However, April would not have been happy in Paris.  I think of the clich&eacute; ""wherever you go, there you are"".  She would eventually have found herself in the same emotional void she felt while living in Connecticut.  While traveling and adventure are great, we truly cannot run away from ourselves.  I think of this woman April who was beautiful on the outside, had a husband who wasn't perfect but who really cared and really tried to reach through his wife's mask (for instance, he is the one who confessed to her of his own wanderings because I think he really did strive to be a man of values in spite of his imperfection...In the movie he is the only person who did any growing and maturing), who had a lovely home, beautiful children (who were free of any obvious disadvantages such as birth defects, learning disabilities, etc), and lived in a peaceful setting.  Yet because she was so wrapped up in her own self-centeredness, she wasn't able to enjoy any of it.

I also wondered about her family.  Didn't she have any before she got married?  This could be partly what was involved in her developing her Narcissistic Personality Disorder.  I am not a psychologist and could be wrong but I think she also demonstrated a Borderline Personality Disorder.

Character development was profound.  Acting was compelling.  Costumes and scenery were perfect for the story.

There were many sub-plots and sub-meanings such as the purposelessness of conformity, the nature of insanity, and of course the ending which deals with one of our most controversial topics in our current society which I won't comment on because I don't want to give away the ending.

In the end, I think of how different April's experience in life could/would have been had she been able to be comfortable with her own self and find joy in making a contribution to something greater than her own self. I used to think a lot like this character and look down upon what I perceived to be ""the establishment"".  But I have learned that life simply reflects back to you that which you are.  If you are shallow, then life will appear shallow and without meaning.  If you are giving, then life will appear abundant.  If we are superficial, that is how society will seem.  It all starts from within and there really is nowhere to run away to where we don't bring ourselves.  If we can find peace within our self (through our life's work, through making a difference, through genuinely loving other people, through religion or spirituality, etc), we can find meaning wherever we are.

Having said all that, my friend with whom I saw the movie pretty much hated it.  He likes ""James Bond"" type movies and he was bored.",1244160000,6,3366,4.624579124579125
3399912,5,B0016Q2D66,"This movie was troubling to watch, but I understand that was Yates' intention when he wrote the book- a caustic and searing portrayal of life in 1950s suburbia. The chemistry between the DeCaprio and Winslet characters worked well (disclaimer: I have never seen Titanic), and the situation was an eerily familiar one for my wife and me: stay in a comfortable but potentially numbing existence, or take a chance and move to Europe (Budapest, not Paris). The dilemmas posed in this film were all too real, especially for the time and place where April's character had few options. The atmosphere of disapproval, from Frank's colleagues at work to the Wheeler's neighbors, was also an accurate depiction. There is a real contradiction between the American cultural enshrinement of individuality, with the condemnation shown when that individuality raises difficult questions about people's own lives and the comfort of conformity. Every character was tragic in some way or another, some more than others, but as real characters they were not so far removed from what anyone could possibly be.",1244073600,7,1089,5.193181818181818
3399913,4,B0016Q2D66,"Having been a huge fan of the novel, and being totally in love with any and everything `Kate Winslet', it's needless to say that I was really, really anticipating this film all year long.  The trailer (complete with the operatic score) just made my skin crawl with excitement.  As the Oscar season progressed and I watched this film get repeatedly snubbed I began to worry, but my interest and anticipation did not dwindle.

And then I saw the film.

`Revolutionary Road' is really a mixed bag of tricks, with a lot going for it, but enough working against it to keep it from becoming the brilliant drama it should have been.  The novel, one of my personal favorites, reeks of humanity and blunt honesty, and while the film carries with it a genuine awkwardness, it's overt obviousness can at times take away from the message Yates was trying to provide us.

The film tells the story of Frank and April Wheeler, a young suburban couple living in the 50's who loathe their lives.  They are stuck in a nice house on a nice street littered with nice people.  They have nice kids and Frank works at a nice job and they are basically sick of the existence they've pigeonholed themselves into.  They want to be free, free from the generalities that make their life so loathsome.  The point is that while their life appears to be perfect, it is that perfection that drives them crazy.  It is that perfection (and their growing distain for their lack of spontaneity) that has driven a hole into their marriage and caused them to attack one another, picking at their faults and growing to detest the very sight of one another.

Be forewarned; `Revolutionary Road' is one of the bleakest films released in recent memory.

In a stroke of desperation, April suggests that Frank quit his job and move the family to Paris, where he would be free to find himself while she supported him and the children doing secretarial work.  Despite the mixed reaction from friends and workmates, Frank seems keen on the idea.

But is he?

Sam Mendes manages to do a lot of justice to Richard Yates' novel, I cannot fault him there.  His style of direction, from the choice in music to the graceful way he captured the era within the actors, was completely complimentary to the source material.  I was in awe of almost every frame, each one just as beautiful as the next.  That had a lot to do with the costume design as well, and the set pieces are glorious.  I loved the crisp whites and overall brightness of most the scenes; the open rooms within their home splattered with yellows and creams and basically adding to the idea that it is the cheery normality of it all that is the evilest creature.

This is a story about loathing complacency.

The acting for the most part is stellar.  Kate Winslet slips in very easily here, and while it can be said that she has done this role before I don't think that she has ever done it so well.  She is a pro, there is no denying that.  Leonardo DiCaprio feels slightly awkward in scenes, as if he isn't sure he knows how to get a full handle on his character; but when he is really needed in order to sell a scene (that brutal fight sequence towards the films end for one) he really nails it.  It's a slightly uneven performance, but there is more good than bad here.  I was more impressed with David Harbour, who plays Shep, the Wheeler's neighbor.  I remember when I read the novel I was really drawn to Shep's quiet yearning for April, and his total feeling of loss.  Harbour nails that.  I would have much rather seen him garner an Oscar nomination over Michael Shannon, who did was he was asked to do but nothing more.  Shannon, in his portrayal of the mentally unstable John Givings, plays `crazy' the way crazy is always played.  I really wanted him to layer this character, since it is within this character that the Wheeler's whole world is brought to fruition.

He just didn't do that for me.

This is where the films primary flaw lies.  Within the Wheeler's dealings with John and his parents (gloriously played by Kathy Bates and Richard Easton) their whole existence, motives and underlying feelings towards each other, is unveiled.  In the novel, while it is almost delivered in the same manner, it appears more subtle and discreet.  No one likes to be browbeat, and so Yates, while maintaining the bluntness with which he treated his characters from the novels beginning, managed to tell us what was `really' going on without `telling' us.  In the film adaptation the same structure is used, but Shannon's delivery of each line feels far too brutish for it to really make an impact.  There is no feeling of mystery or emotional reveal.

He yells, they react, we get the picture.

Had Shannon toned down his approach and actually `lived' that moment as apposed to `act' it, we would have felt something close to what Yates captures on the printed page.

In the end, `Revolutionary Road' is well worth seeing.  The film is harsh, very harsh, and there are no happy endings so don't wait up for them.  This is a film in vein of the novel, truly capturing the harrowing realities of a marriage on the rocks.  This is honest, brutally so, and thus it is not for everyone.  Many people want to escape the realities of life in film, and if that is your intent then stay far away from `Revolutionary Road'.  If, on the other hand, you like to experience film in order to reveal truths about yourself and those around you, then by all means, see this movie.  It will not leave you feeling warm all over.  It will most likely make you squirm in discomfort and break down into tears and leave you in a state of misery (my wife balled her eyes out and lost sleep), but the films honesty is nearly unrivaled.

Despite a few flaws it is intelligent, engaging and unforgettable.",1244073600,,5795,4.546332046332046

If your in love with Kate & Leo well you will watch this movie just because but if you are not, you are wasting 2 hours to watch this movie there is no redeeming value.

These people were beaten even before they started, their strivings a grim charade of escalating anger and disappointment. If it all meant something it might be bearable, but Mendes is only interested in the ritual of these stories. He is a cinematic parasite who attaches himself to weakened characters, striving without any real hope of surviving their own stories, who then sucks the life from them frame by frame with his camera and lush, perfectly staged and art directed productions.",1243987200,18,772,5.233870967741935

It's set in the fifties but it speaks to all generations, it voices a frightening desperation of mediocre lives lived, waiting for something bigger to come around the bend. The fighting scenes are so real and so filled with pain that I was spellbound. They are meant to be together it's just that April (Kate W) has the courage to leap while her mate(Leo) can't quite take that step and it's that very chasm that rips them apart.

3399920,5,B0016Q2D66,"Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio are brilliant in this very sharp satire of American life and practice in the 50s in the USA.

The film has many layers to it, and it posits a dissatisfaction with life in particular and in general in a world that is completely artificial. The dramatic escape plan, suggested and then demanded by the wife, is merely an extension of the American sense of se;f removal to another ""site"" in order to get going with USA values. It does not work.

The breeding family of then and now comes under scrutiny and is found wanting; religious values or ideas are not in evidence, and so there is no leadership in this quarter nor in any other quarter. What the film exposes too are the absurd verbal solutions to problems, hence the wife constantly asking her husband to shut up, and he will not do so, as babble takes over for reason and engulfs the wife and the whole neighborhood.

What keeps the structure of society in this film going are cliches, notions, attitudes, phrases that preach and teach nothing. The fear of the wife and her final actions have the quality of truth when set beside the options she has..suburban death, chronic dissatisfaction on all levels.

There is more, but I will not spoil it; see this film if you are excited by ideas and deeper cosiderations than sit coms and melodramas serve up. This is film as art, acting as perhaps the only route to go for us in understanding the darkness that hates the light.

The other reviews that have issues with boredom or surprise are Mall Movie goers. This is not for entertainment seekers, but for mature thinkers and lovers of film as art.",1243641600,,1636,4.5699658703071675
3399921,5,B0016Q2D66,"There is an audio commentary by director Sam Mendes and screenwriter Justin Haythe. According to Mendes, the BBC owned the rights to Yates' book and asked Haythe to adapt it four years ago. They shot the entire film on location and almost completely in sequence so that DiCaprio and Winslet really lived with their characters. Mendes says that the look of the film was not inspired by other films but a documentary about the suburbs and photographs from the era. Haythe talks at length about adapting the book to film - what was left out, changed and so on.

""Lives of Quiet Desperation: The Making of Revolutionary Road"" is a very classy featurette on how this film came together. Winslet was a big fan of the book and really wanted to make it into a film. Mendes had just finished&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jarhead-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000E0OBK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jarhead (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;and didn't want to jump right into another film but Winslet worked on him for a year until he agreed to do it. It also took Winslet two years to convince DiCaprio to do the film and he loved the script and the chance to work with her again. This featurette also touches upon the challenge of working on location and how the fantastic look of the film was achieved.

Finally, there are five deleted scenes with optional commentary by Mendes and Haythe. There is a scene that was to reveal the Wheeler children earlier on in the film. There is also more footage of the Wheelers visiting with their next-door neighbors with DiCaprio delivering an excellent monologue that reveals more about his character. We see more footage of Frank commuting to work. There is also a flashback with the Wheelers seeing their new home. Mendes and Haythe talk about why this footage was cut and put it into context with the rest of the film.",1243555200,,1906,5.12540192926045
3399922,5,B0016Q2D66,"Sam Mendes surpasses his oscar winning American Beauty with a shattering portrayal of a husband and wife trying to hold on to any dream left in their path. Too often this film has been touted as ""a study of a couple in suburban life"". This may be why it got buried in the oscar race. Audiences and critics missed the importance of the story entirely.

Mendes raises many complicated questions by the film's ending and he doesn't offer very many easy answers. But this is exactly why the movie is so important and compelling from beginning to end. Was she completely rational to want to move to Paris or was she irresponsible and bordering on insantiy? Was he a coward for deciding not to go or was he brave and sane for trying to do the responsible thing? Mendes has made a film that reminds one of Elia Kazan at his best.  The script brilliantly evokes Tennesee Williams at this best.

Kate Winslet is of course superb as the lead character. There has not been such a portrayal of a complex character like this since viviegn leigh as Blanche Du Bois in Streetcar. Michael Shannon is frightening as the next door neighbor,who comes across as some kind of bizarre prophet to the couple.

But it is Leonardo Di Caprio who really captivates in this movie. Like he did as a teenager in some of his best film work, he evokes a vulnerability and daring that makes him a great actor. He has matured into the adult actor in an astouding way like the great jodie foster. Maybe it's easy to overlook this with his brilliant portrayal in Titanic that many can't forget.

To make matters worse, Kate Winslet is rather unconvincing as the 'stepford wife' type character, and is incredibly self aware. Even DiCaprio, whom I usually love, feels ill chosen.
And the ending, well that was just disgusting (I think it would have been far more effective to not actually show anything)
A roller-coaster that slides from delight to utter despair. Sadly, although we see the characters are smiling, we never feel like doing it ourselves. There are no 'normal' moments, moments that actually reflect real life I.E. humour or love. By the end, you'll be feeling distinctly cold.",1242518400,11,744,5.10655737704918

That's SO revolutionary - pun intended! I mean come on, who doesn't know this or has experienced this in their own life, who's over 30? Isn't this common knowledge? It's just that in this case, the wife (played by Winslet) can't handle the compromise and live the more realistic lifestyle, but the husband (played by Di Caprio) seems able to do so and there is our ""crisis"" in the film. Really a very overrated film, in my opinion.

6/18/2011:

I watched this movie for a 2nd time today and I must say that I liked it much better after a 2nd viewing and bumped it up from 2 to 3-stars. However, I do still believe the movie to be over-rated and a bit simplistic in its criticism of 50's American suburbia. But at least this time from the comfort of my own home (v. the 1st viewing on a plane) I was able to focus more on the characters rather than being focused on my boredom of the story.

I read some of the other reviews and comments people made about the film and was quite surprised at the number of people that felt sympathy for April (Winslet's character). Of course most of them were women. I personally was disgusted by her character especially towards the end of the film as she turns her back on her children, her husband, and her home. Frank was not without fault but he seemed a much more stable character to me v. April who definitely was seemingly on a balance beam between sanity and insanity.

3399926,5,B0016Q2D66,"This film could have been a melodramatic mash and it is not. In fact the situation and the various developments make it quasi-tragic. Tragic because it is the story of a totally impossible epiphany for a couple who is living in our modern society. There is no escape from the present programmed and even pre-fabricated life in which we all live. We have practically no freedom of choice. The only freedom of choice we do have is to refuse a possible promotion, a potential chance in this life, and we will end up on the dump, the manure pile. There is no choice because we have to pay for the house, the car, the children's education, and so many other things. There is no real choice because our psyches have been pre-determined into accepting the small little tiny wee box that has been attributed to our life. Our psyche is always opportunistic and it always goes the way the wind blows. Even a simple accident, like an unwanted pregnancy, the result of a negligence as for preventive protection, the result of going out bareback when it is well known we are supposed to go out covered, if we want to really have a choice, becomes the direst tragedy of all times. But we are in such a formatted life that we forget something because ""they"", the big brothers of this brave new world, have mesmerized us into forgetting. There is no simple way out, there is no way out at all. Any attempt at trying to evade the consequences of this event will lead to an even worse catastrophe, like death, or suicide, or death by suicide or suicide by death. Tragic indeed. I will also add that the main two actors are outrageously outstanding. They play their anger, their disorientation, their psychoses, their schizophrenias even with such realism and conviction that we may think they are playing their own roles, their own parts, their own private fate and destiny. It is true the cameraman is also quite prodigious. The way he takes the profile of Di Caprio when this one is supposed to be stubbornly refusing any move brings out this stubborn-ness revealed by the very line of the forehead seen under that profile angle, a Neanderthal or apish profile indeed. It is such details that make an actor and a film remarkable. It is true too that the insane, deranged son of the real estate agent is truer than nature, more prophetic about this society than all the Bibles of the world, than all the Freuds and Marxes of this low, low world of ours.

After 1 hour I felt I was watching De Caprio self-indulging. I was expecting some plot, twist to happen but it never did. I couldn't wait for the end to come round quick enough. Then I heard that ominous piano music which reminded me of American Beauty ( another couple trapped in a loveless marriage); likewise her suicide at the end was reminiscent of Amerciab beauty.

3399928,4,B0016Q2D66,"Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio reunited for this film about U.S. suburban life in the mid-1950s. The chemistry between these two is as strong as ever but in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revolutionary-Road/dp/B0016Q2D66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revolutionary Road</a>&nbsp;they are steeped in misery. April Wheeler (Winslet) has aspirations--to be an actress, to be special somehow, to rise above the cookie-cutter suburban life. Frank Wheeler (DiCaprio) is a cog in the machinery at a New York business and dealing with his 30th birthday by having an affair. They are anchored (and not in a good way) by two children, predictable friends and neighbors, and the daily grind.

April comes up with the idea of moving to Paris where Frank can ""find himself"" while she supports the family with secretarial work. He goes along with it and the planning gets underway. Their friends disapprove but the cachet, the specialness of it all, pleases them--until they find out that April is pregnant. The pregnancy and Frank's promotion at work lead him to change his mind about Paris.

April and Frank fight bitterly throughout this dark movie, which is based on the 1961 novel by Richard Yates. If there is one flaw in the premise--or possibly it's a strength---it is that the suburban motif in their lives is drawn too lightly to justify the Wheelers' misery. Their own personal unhappiness and incompatibility seem universal, and they talk about it endlessly. Faced with the collapse of their Paris plans, April says, ""For years I thought we've shared this secret that we would be wonderful in the world ... We were never special or destined or anything at all."" The pathos of this realization is by no means unique to this couple, but it drives the end of the movie to its painful outcome.

The production is beautiful and moody, with wonderful costumes and sets bringing the middle of the century to life. Director Sam Mendes--Winslet's husband--delivers a vehicle that may have slightly more for Winslet to work with than DiCaprio; his angst is played out slightly less convincingly than hers, I thought. The ""Greek chorus"" of a neighbor (Kathy Bates) and her mentally ill son (Michael Shannon) provides back-story and outsider commentary on the problems in the Wheelers' life; Shannon's masterful performance commanded an Oscar but as a device for furthering the story, I thought it was a shade heavily drawn.

I couldn't take my eyes off this gorgeously designed film, and its dark atmosphere left me with many questions. Is it hubris to imagine that you are special? Is it weakness of character to plan a dramatic escape from the everyday-ness of life? When you run away, don't you take yourself with you? Don't problems need to be resolved where they live? And when a dream collapses, how well do we deal with it? These may or may not be the musings that  Mendes and his screenwriters and cast were intending to spark, but they are the questions that stayed with me. Four stars.

3399929,5,B0016Q2D66,"Many of the reviewers here are focused on the film being set in the 50s and that this makes it somehow cliche.  What I found so compelling about the movie was how applicable it is to today (or any day/time for that matter).  I could completely relate to the characters and, had I married someone not as adventurous as myself, may have found myself living the same nightmare. It was like I could see on screen what my life would've been like if I'd chosen the wrong partner.  I hung on every word of dialogue and thought the screenplay was extraordinary, especially considering it was adapted from such a fine novel. There have been many movies that have tackled this type of material before, but that, in and of itself, does not take away from what an amazing film this is.  None of the others (American Beauty, Far From Heaven) had grabbed me the way this one did. The fact that it was set in the 50s didn't mean much to me because that's not the ultimate focus of the message for me.  The acting is flawless and I thought the movie was absolutely robbed at the Oscars. At least Kate was recognized for The Reader.

It's an actors' movie. In fact, the word ""acting"" seems cheap and insufficient to describe what DiCaprio and Winslett accomplished in this extraordinary film that on the surface indicts suburbia but more deeply jabs at narcissism. Forget about ""characters,"" The reunited ""Titanic"" stars employ their legendary chemistry to engender wholly realized, actual people, people so real that it's sometimes uncomfortable to watch their private lives imploding in an arena so public as a movie theater. There in lies the problem with this film's fleeting popularity and Oscar snub. There is no irony. No editorial comment. No distance of any kind. Just two hours of raw emotion. Director Sam Mendes and his stars perfectly depict-- note-by-note, tear-by-tear, deception-by-deception-- the painful collapse of a marriage and shameful self-realizations of one's small place in the world. But who wants to live through that -- even as a spectator?",1236643200,4,1155,5.386740331491713
3399931,3,B0016Q2D66,"Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, stars of ""Titanic,"" reunite for the first time in eleven years for ""Revolutionary Road,"" but their new film's tone is far from romantic. That is no surprise as the film is directed by Sam Mendes, known for his ""American Beauty"" and ""Road to Perdition,"" and when the critics and reviewers say ""Revolutionary Road"" is a depressing film, they are exactly telling you the truth.

The real point is, however, that depressing mood comes not from the nature of the story itself - see what happened to Jack at the end of ""Titanic."" It was sad, but not depressing. No, the film's depressing tone comes from seeing too much of unhappy characters who choose to be depressing.

Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio play a married couple April and Frank, who settle in a beautiful house on ""Revolutionary Road"" in the mid-50s. After the brief scene of April's disastrous amateur stage production, we realize their married life is not going well.

I am not particularly against the film's vision about American dream turned nightmare. The problem for me is that ""Revolutionary Road"" overstates the point. The characters talk much about themselves. Their efforts are all fertile. What they do is meaningless. Life is miserable and empty. They are not happy even having affairs with someone else. OK, their life is hollow, I know, but what else does the film offer besides what we realize in the first 30 minutes?

The acting of Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio is fine. And throughout the film we are aware that they are acting. Their acting is too good (or serious) for these characters they play, which rather belong to melodramatic world. This is why Michael Shannon (deservedly nominated for Oscar) steals every scene from them as a mentally troubled teacher, who relentlessly tells these characters what we have already known. His character has a mystery, or originality, that ""Revolutionary Road"" ultimately needs.",1235779200,,1941,5.0186335403726705
3399932,5,B0016Q2D66,"Adapted from Richard Yates first novel, Revolutionary Road exposes the adversities of a young couple living in a Connecticut suburban neighborhood during the 1950's who simply realize too late that they were never meant to be.

Frank Wheeler (Dicaprio) and April Wheeler (Winslet) feel as though they must standout from all the other mundane and ordinary suburbanites in their neighborhood. Frank, a marketer who works for Knoxx business (equivalent to IBM in those days) machines, is profoundly miserable at his job as he diligently works in a cubicle and engages in secretarial affairs with the novice typist. April, a struggling actress, who apparently never received her big break in show biz does not like to talk about her failures.

During the beginning of the film, we are introduced to a quick flashback of how they met at a party while they were younger; Frank exhibits his witty, charming charisma as he gives April the impression of eventually leading a spontaneous life in Paris in the future. However, the viewer only begins to find out that this was merely a sales pitch or a common characteristic of a marketer. On the contrary, April falls for it no less. Fast forwarding to the present, April now lives in an ordinary life on Revolutionary Road with Frank and her two children and receives frequent visits from her inquisitive real estate agent (Kathy Bates) accompanied with her ""mentally unstable"" son. April feels as though she is leading a very unsatisfying and unfulfilled life. To add some excitement in their relationship, April broaches Frank's former idea of actually pursuing a career and settling in Paris as a secretary because it simply pays handsomely; meanwhile, it will beneficially fit Frank because he can finally figure out what he wants to do with his life. Frank refuses at first because according to him it is just ""unrealistic"" but eventually obliges because he too feels as though they need something new and spontaneous to reinvent their relationship. Despite the neighbors and Frank's fellow co-workers disbelief in this ""childish"" and radical decision, things seem to go very smoothly in the Wheeler family; the house they just bought is now on sale, their belongings are packed, the children are excited, life could not be any better.

It all seems too swell for this tragic couple, when suddenly Frank is offered a promotion at his redundant job with a higher paying position, heavier responsibilities, and more importantly a chance to be apart of something great, the computer. Frank refuses this handsome offer from his boss at first because it interferes with their big trip to Paris. On the other hand, Frank cannot resist the temptation and is drawn to stay at this job because of the attachment he has regarding his father. We learn that Frank's father has also worked at Knoxx Business Machines for 30 years. It suggests as though Frank has a yearning desire to fulfill this empty legacy. On a different note, it strongly expresses Frank's inability to change and triumph over his trepidation. This couple struggles to achieve any sort of compromise as their lays a serious conflict of interest regarding their futures. April wants a lifestyle change in Paris; meanwhile, Frank is satisfied working in a miserable occupation with a higher salary. This relationship portrays that conflict of interest incessantly; it also shows how it affects their lifestyle and how they grapple with the consequences. It is not pleasant I rest assure you. (You'll see what I mean)

The bigger picture here is the heavy social commentary implemented in this film at almost every other scene. It reflects and exposes the culture of the 1950's, the struggles of an unhappy relationship, and the fine line between insanity and simply pure genius. It also sheds light upon questions such as what is insanity and what is mean to be medically and mentally unstable? The reality is that the real estate agent's son who is ""mentally unstable"" by society is the only one that possesses a real intellectual and realistic perception on the wheeler's relationship.(Go figure) The Wheeler's relationship and decisions are constantly being influenced by other people and we see this through Frank's work environment, the neighbors, and the real estate agent. April is victimized as a prisoner of culture and her difficulty of coping with the dynamics of the role of a wife during the 1950's. Some might question her role in the film and ask, well, why doesn't she just get a divorce, or leave Frank? It just wasn't that simple during that time period as it was considered taboo or dishonorable to leave or separate from your husband. April wishes she could leave the house but is drawn back to it like a magnet because she has two children, a husband, and could not possibly earn a lucrative living in those days considering the job opportunities available at that time period. In that regard, April is prisoner of the house, living in an inescapable environment. She is a prisoner living in a prison within a prison. Frank is a mere coward that cannot confront the social obstacles of change. Like April, Frank too, is a prisoner as well. Hence, my conclusion, a couple that was never meant to be.

Personally, I enjoyed this film not because of the setting, or from the great performances, but the realism that is portrayed here in this relationship. It is quite unique in the sense that the film does not sugar coat anything. Not to be too clichd or anything but it echoes the expression ""it is what it is"". In that regard it may turn some people off. I happen to cherish and embraced this message. If you like this film, check out ""A Doll's House"" with Anthony Hopkins. Both are excellent but sad films.  They express a similar struggle of a couple resisting to conform to society.",1235433600,112,5808,4.9153924566768605
3399933,3,B0016Q2D66,"Revolutionary Road begins in an almost promising manner with a seemingly content couple meeting, then sort of flash forwards into their lives to a sunny suburb where they live in a lovely home with children, and everything seems peachy.

Unfortunetely underneath their calm exteriors, the couple, played to perfection by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio really aren't all that happy with their lives.

The plot is both simple and complex. The film is really about the emotions of the characters. The distrust, deception, adultery- you name it and it can be found in this film.

It is not always pleasant to watch but you almost can't stop watching the pair of spectacular actors do their thing. If it weren't for them, I don't think the film would be as interesting.

Truthfully, after watching it, I can't really make up my mind as to whether I liked this film or not. It is an odd type of film where really you should despise every character and their situation, and yet you find something redeaming along the way.

The film is certainly a downer and I'm not sure of a second viewing. It is a well-crafted movie with minor flaws which don't really detract but make it that much harder to enjoy it.  It certainly makes you think and I suppose it accomplishes that much at least.",1235260800,,1281,4.671111111111111
3399934,3,B0016Q2D66,"I went to see this film, in spite of mediocre reviews, just to see Winslet and DiCaprio.  They did not disappoint!  I sat through the whole thing just because of their amazing performances, especially Winslet's.

However...the script is a whole other thing!  I understand, from reading other reviews here, that the novel from which the film was made was written in the late fifties and that explains a lot.  The main issue appears to be the stultifying influence of suburban life and the impossibility for any sentient being, especially one with artistic aspirations, to live a decent life there.  As we, in 2009, look at the house which poor April (Winslet) feels is her prison we groan.  Poor woman has to put up with that, and wear her nice clothes and stay home and cook for her two beautiful children and then sleep with her handsome husband.  We weep for her dilemma!  No wonder she screams all the time at the guy who goes to work every day at a job he hates in order to finance all this...

What bothered me about the film was that it seemed that Mendes was sympathizing with April and making the husband the bad guy.  I'm a woman and I found it hard to sympathize with April at all.  The husband keeps trying to talk to her about their relationship problems and she just doesn't want to talk.  That sounds backwards to me!

I lived through the 50's and do remember the problems that the novel is addressing.  I haven't read it but it sounds like it was a good treatise for that time.  But now, fortunately, we have evolved and the problems of these people seem really unrealistic to modern eyes.  I kept agreeing with the husband who said that they could have a happy life, yes even there in the gorgeous Connecticut suburban house that seemed to have a woods in the back yard.  A raise was coming, her husband had found something in his job that finally captured his interest, it seemed that their problems were solved.

Another thing that bothered me was the way the children were treated.  We saw them, once, idyllically photographed through the spray of the garden hose, but they weren't around much.  April claimed to love them but we don't see much interaction with them. There was more interaction with the neighbors.  What really was April's problem?  She didn't seem to be much of an actress.  If she really wanted to pursue acting, Manhattan was only a train ride away and she could have hired a baby sitter and taken classes with Lee Strasberg or Herbert Berghoff!  Maybe the novel gives more background on her to make her incredible unhappiness more justifiable.  But the way Mendes makes this film, she is shown to suffer simply because she has to live there and egad, have another beautiful child and somehow it's her husband's fault.

By the end of the film I had lost any sympathy for April, in spite of Winslet's superb performance and I wished her husband better luck next time.

I have to wonder what in this film attracted Mendes---perhaps the opportunity to work with his wife and the added attraction of the reunion of the Titanic co-stars.  Too bad he didn't wait for a better script.",1235174400,10,3116,4.5840867992766725
3399935,2,B0016Q2D66,"Moviegoers who found ""American Beauty"" forced and its satirical targets largely way over the top (viz. Annette Bening's character and actions) would do well to avoid ""Revolutionary Road."" This film is positively dug out with a steam shovel, its revelation of 1950's conformity by Sam Mendes about as revolutionary and exciting as a rediscovery of the wheel.

An equally tiresome aspect of the film is the blatant overacting of both Winslet and DiCaprio in just about all of their scenes -lots of screaming and yelling, with less going on than meets the ears.

Finally, there's the casting of DiCaprio in grown up roles. An excellent  actor as a youth, unfortunately, like Patty Duke, he's hard to believe when cast in adult parts. He invariably resembles just a high school boy made up to portray someone years older, and it's too easy to separate the actor from the character being portrayed.

Leo looks about 12 years old, and Kate looks like his mother (and, from certain angles, like his father).  Leo squints, and then flies off the handle.  Kate frowns, has no hobbies, no friends, and no believable character. Even her hair colour is unconvincing. Rather than being immersed in the world of the story, we are forced to watch these actors act.  They speak in arch dialogue and emote.  It's like watching a bad play.  And it goes on for two hours.

Oh, the pain!  The pain!  It's all so earnest.  You can almost hear the actors commending each other for their work and feeling lucky to be working with, or married to, such an important director and picking out what clothes they will wear to Oscar ceremonies.  What is more, in the best Hollywood tradition, mental illness, replete with references to electro-convulsive therapy, is wheeled in and we, the impressionable audience, are invited to laugh.  In an interview available on [...], Sam Mendes congratulates himself on a job well done.  He also thinks the film contains ""emotional truth"".  Given the above, is Mr. Mendes: a) serious?  b)very serious?  c)too serious?  d)a bubble-headed booby?

The film would have been far more succesful if it had ended with Kate running away with the robot from the original TV series of Lost in Space (the sex scenes would have been more interesting too, and the social commentary less self-conscious).  Indeed, if the neighbours had been the entire space-family Robinson, then I would have enjoyed the film immensely.

3399937,4,B0016Q2D66,"Hollywood seems to like to explore the idea that American suburbia is a cultural, spiritual, moral and BORING wasteland.  How many times have we seen this shot:  A camera on a crane is overlooking a typical street in a typical, cookie-cutter subdivision...when all the cars full of all the people leaving for work back out of all the garages at the same moment...and they're all the same make & color of car?  Ha ha!  That was funny the first dozen times I saw it.  It's even a big part of the opening credits for WEEDS.  And in more ""serious"" movies, denizens of suburbia are all burnt-out middle management types, with bored wives who no longer love or lust for their spouses, and they've all got kids who are spoiled brats, firestarters, druggies or kids trying to GET AWAY from all the BS and phoniness.

It's a VERY tired idea, and from viewing the trailers for REVOLUTIONARY ROAD, it sure looked like Sam Mendes was going to travel that road again...a road recently covered by the excellent MAD MEN.  It looked like Mendes' own AMERICAN BEAUTY, but without a sense of humor and set in the `50s.  But my wife and I finally dragged ourselves anyway, because Kate Winslet is too good to miss.

In some ways, the film DOES imply that the sameness of suburbia and the drudgery of taking a train ""into the city"" for work kills the soul and deadens the creative spark.  We see familiar scenes of New York City middle-managers trudging from the train station, all with identical suits, ties & briefcases.  They all smoke.  They all drink.  They all cheat on their wives.  They all look utterly miserable and bored...hopeless.

I happen to know that folks CAN live in suburbia, and commute a great distance AND be happy.  I know that people who live IN a bustling, alive, creative city can be miserable.  The old clich ""home is where the heart is"" is true.  I've endured long drives every day to work so my young family could have a house on a quite street with a decent backyard.  I hated my drive...but I loved coming home.  I know a lot of people like that...Hollywood just chooses to believe they can exist.  In these kinds of films, the friends and neighbors living the same lifestyle are all equally unhappy.

In REVOLUTIONARY ROAD, Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are young citydwellers who meet at a very artsy looking party, probably in the Village.  They fall madly in love...but we leap forward a few years, and they're living in suburbia (in a gorgeous house, I might add) and have a couple of young children.  All their dreams of living in Paris are dead.  DiCaprio goes to a job he clearly hates (and in which he's clearly asked to actually DO very little).  Winslet is the stay-at-home mom who is going just a little  crazy.  She's bored with her life, but is also terrified that she and her husband are WASTING their potential and falling out of love with each other.

They have some spectacular verbal battles, doing lots of psychic damage to each other.  Yet Winslet is fiercely determined to break the cycle and she concocts a crazy plan.  Sell the house, quit the job, grab the savings and move to Paris.  Winslet will work as a secretary and DiCaprio can spend a few months ""finding out what he really wants to do.""  My goodness, if that isn't an invitation for extended navel gazing, I don't know what is!  DiCaprio agrees to the plan, and the couple begin to make plans to unravel their domestic situation.

A few complications arise, of course...some dramatic and some rather subtle.  They couple reconciles, falls apart, reconciles, etc.  It's all impeccably staged and acted.  It feels like a play, in fact.  The overall production is lovely, but has a fussiness to it that keeps the movie from ever letting loose.  It's almost like the indictment of suburban ennui had inflicted the movie with a lackadaisical sensibility.  It's carefully put together, but has only moments of true life bursting in it...otherwise it feels too observational and not immersive.

But interestingly, it emerges not so much as an indictment of suburbia as a whole, but as almost an exploration of delusion or even mental illness.  I won't tell you WHOSE illness...although you can probably guess anyway.  We all like to think we're a little special...but most of us don't think we're spectacularly special.  What if we did?  What if we genuinely believed we were living amongst ignorant clods who couldn't possibly understand how special and full of bright, shining greatness we are?  Wouldn't that drive us a little crazy?  Wouldn't we scheme to escape?  And when escape becomes an obsession, and ""real life"" conspires to hold us back...just how would we respond?  That's what REVOLUTIONARY ROAD was actually about to me (not sure if that's what Mendes wanted, but that's what I got).  The ability of some people to delude themselves constantly that life is meant to be better and more exciting for them, if only they could be somewhere else.  That happiness and fulfillment are there for the taking...somewhere else.  That the grass is always greener, not on the other side of the fence, but on the other side of the globe.

DiCaprio gives a fine performance (not great) as a man who has somewhat resigned himself to a life of mostly drudgery, with only occasional bursts of joy.  He still looks like a kid, and middle-class gravitas does fit him easily.  But his performance is sincere.  Winslet, big surprise, is incandescent.  She is a character who is easy to dislike, and doesn't care.  She's selfish, vibrant, intelligent and angry.  Unfortunately, sometimes her dialogue in particular (DiCaprio's too) is SO stagey that even with her talent, she doesn't always come across as flesh-and-blood.  These characters scream EVERYTHING at each other...the writer just didn't believe in letting anything roil under the surface...it all needed to spew out.  So while the fight scenes are great in a way...they also feel like scenes, and not snippets of real lives.

There is a wild, crazy exception to all this fussiness.  You've probably seen that Michael Shannon (excellent in BUGS, among other solid roles) was nominated for an Oscar for his role here.  He plays the son of a Winslet & DiCaprio's real estate agent.  He's a mathematician who is mostly confined to an asylum.  Mom brings him round to meet the ""nice young couple"" for lunch, and he is immediately wise to them.  He sees their unhappiness and he articulates it to them.  In his first appearance, his honesty is seen as refreshing to the couple...and affirmation that they are RIGHT about their plans.  Yet later, when things have ceased going so well, he spends another meal with them...eviscerating both of them as neatly as a surgeon might excise a mole.  His character is difficult to believe on an academic level...yet Shannon brings an unexpected zest to his character.  He's a fussy kind of man (just as the movie is fussy), but he's unfettered by propriety, eager to make everyone around him uncomfortable by bring out the truth.  While it does feel like a device to explain to the audience what we already sort of know...Shannon is riveting nonetheless...he literally steals the show from his far better known co-stars.

It's no surprise that REVOLUTIONARY ROAD ultimately was almost excluded from Oscar contention.  It's just a little too carefully crafted and full of itself to entirely work.  Yet is it still a fascinating character study, and a movie journey worth taking.  It actually does have some surprises up its sleeve.",1234224000,4,7505,4.798594847775176
3399938,4,B0016Q2D66,"I suspect that many people watching ""Revolutionary Road"" will expect to see some sort of romantic comedy.  Put Leonardo DiCaprio together with Kate Winslet and would it not be reasonable to expect something romantic?  Nothing could be further from the truth.  ""Revolutionary Road"" is often confronting.  It deals with tough themes within an unsettled marriage.  It is anything but romantic.

Based on the novel by Richard Yates, ""Revolutionary Road"" is set in 1950s Connecticut.  Frank Wheeler (DiCaprio) is a young company man trying to make a way ahead for his wife and two kids.  He works for the same company that previously employed his father in New York.  He is bored.  However, his wife, April (Winslet) is beyond boredom.  She is quite depressed and hates her lifestyle.  This is unfortunate as her lifestyle would be the envy of so many people.  The family is well off and there are two happy children.

It is the interaction of husband and wife that forms the basis of the film.  At times, this can be extremely discomforting to the viewer.  Yet it always seems plausible.  The characters have cred.  The film's ending is also traumatic.  Don't go looking for a happy reconciliation between husband and wife.

Notwithstanding the film's troubling theme, ""Revolutionary Road"" is worth the effort.  The viewer is rewarded with a gritty insight to a dysfunctional family.  Both DiCaprio and Winslet are excellent in their roles.",1234051200,2,1436,5.0212765957446805

So worth the effort? Absolutely, for two reasons. Firstly, the acting is brilliant - Kate Winslet, quite rightly, wins huge praise for her portrayal of the frustrated and tormented wife but in many ways it's Leonardo DiCaprio who has the more difficult role as the confused husband and, despite unfair criticisms about his ""boyish looks"", he carries it off convincingly and equally superbly. Together, they're incredible - so good that they become wholly believable people trapped in a wholly believable marriage.

And, secondly, despite the fairly one-dimensional story and the effort of watching it slowly unfold to a fairly predictable conclusion, this is powerful stuff: couples argue like this, lovers hurt each other like this, people destroy each other's dreams like this, and real life is like this... so much so that it's at times deeply uncomfortable viewing. Not much fun then but after getting through it all you won't forget it in a hurry and, on the way, you'll witness some of the best acting you've ever seen.",1233964800,,1329,5.063926940639269
3399940,5,B0016Q2D66,"""I can't leave and I can't stay. I'm no good to anyone."" -April Wheeler

April and Frank Wheeler (Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio) live in Conneticut with their two children. April is discontent and convinces Frank that he might be too. April suggests they sell up and move to Paris. Frank agrees until he gets a promotion at work and April gets pregnant. Frank decides he's hit his stride in life. He changes the narrative behind his story. He gets interested in selling computers. He tells April ""People in Paris can't be the only ones living interesting lives. We can be happy here."" Most of all Frank wants his wife to be happy, but April refuses to join him in his contentment and continues to dwell on the idea that life is passing her by.

I thought I would really like this movie. I'm a lot like April. On my worst days there is very little that keeps me from running to the airport. Thankfully I married a sweet guy that accepts my occasionally itchy feet-which is what I kept wondering about April. If she wanted to go to Paris so bad, why not just go for a while by herself and then use the experience to bring a new perspective to her existence? Couples don't need to be together every single moment and even the most free spirted of people need a home. Instead April chooses to destroy herself and her husband when there are so many other viable alternatives. It was hard for me to empathize with a character that couldn't laugh, took every moment of her life and herself way too seriously, and couldn't appreciate the love and dedication Frank directed towards her happiness. Though I saw a bit of myself in April, I despised her lack of courage.

The most interesting thing about this movie is that April is playing the ""male"" role. Men always think that women want to ""trap"" them into the nest. Revolutionary Road aptly demonstrates the other side-it's Frank that wants to ""talk about it"" and April just wants him to shut up. Frank wants to stay at home and April wants to travel.

Important to the narrative of Revolutionary Road is Paris and it's ability to provide Americans with a worthwhile existence. Don't get me wrong. I love Paris. But I had a Parisian boyfriend once and he and his friends always laughed about the American fascination with France-a year in Provence, the black berets! Yes, France is good. But where ever you go, there you are. If you're unhappy at home, you'll probably be unhappy in France too. You get the feeling that this is true for April, which is why she chooses her sad ending. April wouldn't have been happy in Paris, she wouldn't have been happy anywhere. At the end of the movie Frank says to his friend ""She did it to herself."" Frank is talking about something else in the scene (I don't want to give it away) but it's an apt metaphor for April's life.

I'm giving this movie five stars because of the good performances, originality of ideas, and the fact that no matter how much you end up liking or hating this film, it's going to get you thinking. And if it all leaves you too sad-if you see too much of yourself or your relationship in this film, remember that there are other ways to solve ennui without destroying yourself, your family, or your spouse and those resolutions don't have to involve electroshock therapy, the mental health system, extra marital affairs, booze, cigarettes and Paris. It's hardly all ""empty hopelessness"" as the characters in this film would have you believe. There's plenty to be happy and laugh about no matter where you are.

If the themes in Revolutionary Road interest you, I'd suggest the Aussie film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alexandra-s-Project/dp/B0007LI10S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alexandra's Project</a>, the humorous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-War-of-the-Roses/dp/B0009X75PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The War of the Roses</a>, or the gentler&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Good-Wife/dp/B00005R5G8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Good Wife</a>.

3399941,1,B0016Q2D66,"Oh geez, this movie is just unbearably depressing.  It shrieks right through your soul, like watching a live cat getting slowly disemboweled.  After the first 30 minutes of this movie, I wanted both of the main characters to die; after 45 minutes, I got up and left.

The fault is the source material for this movie, the book ""Revolutionary Road"".  The fault is not with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, who are wonderful actors, and do a fine job here, as always.  Another reviewer mentioned something about bad dialogue and stiff acting.  I think that this is only because the screenplay is based on a book published in 1961, and the movie is definitely a period piece trying to re-create the mood and style of that era.  So the story and pacing and acting and dialogue is much more like ""Mad Men"" (which I love) than your basic modern breakup/dysfunctional family movie.

""Mad Men"" too has a lot of characters with dysfunctional marriages, but is enjoyable because of the depth and loving complexity in which the characters are presented.  In ""Revolutionary Road"",  the two main characters are so thoroughly vapid and unlikeable, so completely into their own wants and neuroses that one immediately wonders why they bothered to get married and have children in the first place (oh, right, it was the thing to do back then, and there was no birth control pill yet).  And then one realizes that they probably deserved each other, but the kids (who are just props in this story), certainly did not deserve them.

The closest movie that I've seen which makes you squirm in your seat like ""Revolutionary Road"" would be ""The Squid and the Whale"", which had an equally unlikeable, vapid and self-centered husband and wife pair going through a divorce.  Except that ""Squid and the Whale"" was told from the point of view of the two children, who had to suffer through their parents' self-centered, narcissistic behavior, and of course, as a modern movie story, the wife was empowered to abandon the kids and just flee for her own career instead of agonizing about her failures and sticking her head in an oven (that's how the book ends, I never made it to the end of ""Revolutionary Road"", the movie).

And so that was ultimately why I gave ""Squid and the Whale"" a four star rating - because it had a lot to say about why people should get married - the purpose of marriage is simply to have children, and to protect them, and that requires that the mother and father sacrifice a good chunk of their lives to the kids and refrain from engaging in family-destructive behaviors.  Marriage simply codifies the boundaries of such a relationship.  If a couple cannot live with these boundaries and just want to get together and share a life and have sex, they don't have to get married and in my book they shouldn't.  They definitely shouldn't have kids.

""Revolutionary Road"" deserves only one star, because in spite of the fine period style acting by DeCaprio and Winslet, ultimately the movie utterly fails to entertain or to educate or to do anything other than to torture one's soul as we watch these two fine actors tear into each other.  And the fault lies in Richard Yates's novel, which failed to understand or even to examine the true nature of the dysfunctional marriage of the Wheelers.

Richard Yates intended his novel to be a diatribe against the conformity of the 1950s and 1960s, this tendency to give up the ""revolutionary spirit"", and so blamed the problems of the Wheeler marriage on just that one facet of things.  But we have since seen ample proof that more important factors are involved - completely flipping the social norms of the 1950s around, as we have done since, has not decreased the numbers of seriously unhappy marriages and dysfunctional families, nor stopped suicides and divorces.  No, there is far more at stake here than what is presented in this vapid and very depressing movie.",1233446400,22,3910,4.752958579881657
3399942,3,B0016Q2D66,"Revolutionary Road, set in 1950s suburbia, is the latest movie to deal with the disenchantment that sets in when life fails to meet expectations.

April (Kate Winslet), an acting student and Greenwich Village-dwelling bohemian, falls in love with Frank Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio), and soon finds herself living the life of a suburban housewife and mother. April sees herself as a victim of suburban homogeneity and mediocrity, and longs for more than the ordinary life she shares with Frank. The reality, though, is that April lacks the gifts needed to have an extraordinary life. Her one true talent seems to be making other people miserable.

I found this movie hard to watch. At times the movie is as airless as the suburb it portrays. The nasty fights between the Wheelers become wearying, and there is nothing particularly fresh or original in this portrayal of a marriage gone wrong.  There's a predictability in the downfall of the Wheelers; it's clear from the start of this movie that no one will find any measure of happiness. All that's left for the viewer to do is to guess how exactly the unhappiness will unfold.

For some reason, I found myself unmoved by April's unhappiness, and I'm not sure if this is the fault of the script or of Winslet's performance. April's despair seems a bit overwrought. Part of this may have to do with the fact that the Wheelers are not exactly stranded in the hinterlands. They live within commuting distance of one of the great cities of the world and yet their social lives seem to revolve entirely around suburban locales.  Manhattan is only seen as a place where mind numbing work is done.

Leonardo DiCaprio does a fine job portraying the self-doubting Frank, but it's the supporting actors who are most memorable in this film. Many people are raving about Michael Shannon's performance as a mentally ill mathematician, but I also enjoyed Kathy Bates' nuanced portrayal of a busybody real estate agent.

I also enjoyed the final scene, which injects a bit of dry humor into what has been an increasingly grim affair.",1233446400,28,2068,4.8746438746438745
3399943,4,B0016Q2D66,"Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet played star-crossed lovers whose love and dreams made anything possible in Titanic.  Revolutionary Road is the antithesis of that film.  DiCaprio and Winslet are once again a couple, but here they struggle to find meaning in their comfortable lives and wind up turning their frustration and rage against each other.  But it's not their fault.  The film portrays conformist 1950's suburbia as the villain...

Frank and April Wheeler (DiCaprio and Winslet) seem to be the perfect couple.  Young, smart, attractive and up-and-coming, they appear to be living the American dream.  They have two beautiful children and an idyllic house in the suburbs.  But they are both desperately unhappy.  Why?  Because they feel they are living meaningless lives in a soul-less society.

The filmmakers seem to believe so as well, portraying mid-1950's suburbia as a kind of Stepford, CN, populated by zombies.  In contrast, Frank and April seem to be the only real people.  They have feelings and try to talk through their differences, whereas all the other characters are presented as one-dimensional morons.

So when April comes up with a plan to ditch their unfulfilling lives and move the family to Paris, we root for them.  It seems the answer to their problems.  Indeed, both Frank and April come alive with the plan.  They become happy with their lives and each other as they make preparations to drop out of the ""normal"" lives that everyone else seems to be sleepwalking through.

Alas, breaking free is not that easy.  Events conspire to make their exit more difficult.  Frank and April struggle with each other as they struggle with their fate and future.  The story builds to a melodramatic climax.  Don't expect a happy ending.

Revolutionary Road has gotten near universal accolades, and it is compelling to watch, but I felt sold short by it.  This could have been an intelligent drama about two perceptive young people coming to terms with each other and the responsibilities and disappointments of adulthood in an imperfect world.  Instead, it turns into a potboiler, a platform for DiCaprio and Winslet to overact, as if they were in a Tennessee Williams play.

This is the kind of film Hollywood makes when it wants to showcase middle class suburban life as empty and vapid.  It's Sam Mendes' 1950's version of his earlier film American Beauty. The message here is that those ""happy days"" of the 1950's were really an illusion.  Scratch the surface and not far below, you'll find deeply unhappy people living lives of quiet desperation.  To drive home the point, one of the characters who comes into the Wheeler's home is the grown son of one of their neighbors, a man who is on furlough from a psychiatric hospital.  He preaches eloquently about the emptiness and hopelessness of their lives, and encourages the Wheelers to escape while they can.  He is portrayed sympathetically, as sane and wise, as if he is in a mental hospital because the world around him is crazy.  It's a simplistic and romantic view;  I just didn't buy it.

I thought the Wheeler's problems and angst had more to do with their own character flaws than the world around them.  But the film prefers to  be an indictment of suburban life in the 1950's, with the Wheelers portrayed as hapless victims of their ""hopeless, empty"" environment.  At one point in the film, Frank implores his wife, ""We don't have to go to Paris to be happy, we can be happy here.""  It's the most intelligent line in the film.  Too bad the film didn't believe it.",1233446400,,3549,4.861435726210351
3399944,5,B0016Q2D66,"That would be my take on it.  I found this movie, first of all, watchable.  It made me ask questions as I watched, questions about what it means 'to be someone', what it is she actually hoped to be, and how she thought moving to Paris would help her realize that.  The desire to 'come alive' is often achieved through travel or a drastic change of some kind and I can fully understand wanting to escape the suburbs and the hometown - so on one level I could relate. Not to mention that divorce and abortion were were both taboo in the 50s (when the movie seems to be taking place). It becomes a chessboard of tangled issues developing and playing against each other as the story progresses.

DiCaprio and Winslett did a good job acting in this as well and their dialogues pulled me in.  DiCaprio is sometimes hit and miss for me.  I liked him in ""Catch Me If You Can"", another 50's piece, and in this one I also found him more or less sympathetic (and fairly believable).  The character of the insane/truth-telling son of the housing agent was an added plus and helped really bring out the issues in the film.  It ended nicely too I thought and left me pensive.  I don't think this movie is simply about agreeing or disagreeing with the course the characters take (although that is inevitable) but rather seeing the very familiar attitudes and needs which spurn them on on their way.  The extremity to which she takes things is what makes you really think about it and (probably) come to your own more healthy conclusions.",1233100800,,1522,4.481884057971015
3399945,3,B0016Q2D66,"Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. April (Kate Winslet) marries Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio), has two kids and lives on Revolutionary Road
2. April's unhappy
3. Frank's unhappy
4. April and Frank make me unhappy
5. They dream of Paris in the springtime which is supposed to be the winter of their discontent
6. Summer lovin' changes lots of things
7. It takes a patient of a mental institution to wake them up, and the audience with them
8. It seems they were never special or destined for anything at all

Yeah, I know - it's a drama - but one would have hoped for a little more life, or at least believability in this drawn out saga about unhappy people behaving badly.  DiCaprio is terribly miscast for this role, his baby-faced good looks making him appear far too young, bright eyed and bushy tailed to be a middle aged man with the world on his shoulders.

Winslet, on the other hand, is perfectly cast, and totally aces her part.  Unfortunately, the character is too unlikeable, and draws little or no sympathy from the audience.

Supporting roles are played by Kathy Bates, Richard Easton and Michael Shannon as a dysfunctional family group, and by Kathryn Hahn and David Harbour as a friendly couple.

Far from being King of the World, this monotonous melodrama posing as a Titanic reunion should have gone down with the ship.  Points are given for the acting, the sets and the costumes, with a bonus for Winslet, who gives the only performance worth the ticket price.

3399946,4,B0016Q2D66,"""That's it?  I'm Picking the Movie Next Time..."", said a woman three rows behind me, rather loudly, as the credits began to roll.  I think that if, instead, it had gone 5 minutes longer and ended with a tear-flowing, apology-laden embrace...that she would have been satisfied.  She missed the entire point of the film...probably on purpose.

I came into the movie expecting it to be a warning to all those thinking about marriage.  Basically, the main characters are stuck.  Stuck together.  They've got the house, the kids, the car, the white picket fence.  But then what?  They aren't happy.  They try to think of a way to escape...but both of them know it wouldn't work.  There is no way for them to be happy together.  There is a ""crazy guy"" in the movie, fresh out of the psych-ward who acts as the voice of truth.  Of blunt truth.  He's the only truthful character in the movie.  Everyone else lies to themselves and plays the ""happy suburbia"" game.

I know people like this.  They married young under societal and family pressures.  Got their car.  Got their house.  Got their kids.  Got their white picket fence.  But...they aren't happy.  They're stuck.  Can't change careers.  Can't go back to school to pursue something interesting to their soul.

Not one single character in the movie is happy.  Actually the thing that seems to scare the characters most is the possibility of seeing someone else achieve the happiness they cannot.  As long as everyone is ""in this together"" (misery loves company), then they won't have to feel bad about themselves.

A lot of people will see this movie and distance themselves from it, just like the characters in the movie did with the main couple:  ""Gee, what's wrong with them?  Why do they choose to be depressed?  Why can't they just be happy?  They've got food in their bellies and a place to live.  I'm glad I'll never/didn't end up like them.""  This kind of person is doomed to end up like these characters.  The money, the kids, the possessions...these things don't make a person happy.  The main characters compromised themselves, compromised their dreams and ambitions in order to have these things.  And it destroyed them.

I think it speaks volumes that when the crazy character speaks...the audience roars in laughter.  But he's just speaking the honest truth, brutally blunt as he is.  It shouldn't be funny.  It shouldn't be strange.  It's ironic that if his character wasn't crazy, and still said these things, that it probably wouldn't be accepted by the audience as a plausible character.  We're all so used to lying to ourselves and others that seeing someone speak blunt truth is uncomfortable, and wildly outside of normal societal conventions.  So we laugh to release the tension.

I have friends and family that are destroying themselves in different ways.  Gambling.  Obesity.  Infidelity.  Not seeking medical attention when they obviously should.  Others not taking their medication.  It would be great if this crazy character could visit these people for me and speak the truth.  Maybe wake them up.  Help save them...before it's too late.  And I would like to be that character for them.  But it wouldn't help.  As the crazy character in the movie states:  ""Emptiness and Hopelessness"" is what they're stuck in.  And any attempt I could make to shake them out of that would be met with the same violent rage and indignation as DiCaprio's character in the film.  If I tried anything I would become an unwelcome pariah.  Realistically there is nothing I can do.

This movie re-enforced what I've always felt.  Whether you're happy or not is your own damn fault and no one else's; a lesson that very few people ever learn.  You need to do whatever makes you happy.  Chase that.  Live that.  Never compromise that for anyone or any reason.  Period.  The second you stop living for yourself is the second you stop living, and start destroying yourself.  But introspection, ""knowledge of self"", is the most important thing you need to be truly happy; to stop lying to yourself and see the truth clearly.

This movie would be good companion viewing with ""It's a Wonderful Life"".  It's like the anti-Capra film.  Jimmy Stewart's George Bailey did everything we're told to do.  Everything all our lives we're told is right.  Everything that should give a man true happiness.  He sacrifices his dream (see the world, etc.), in order to serve his family and community by working for the family business in a job he hates and resents.  The sad truth is, the real-life townsfolk of Bedford Falls would have been indifferent to George's situation (reacted as Potter expected them to), and the real-life George Bailey would have ended up at the bottom of that river.

Nevertheless, I think I might make both of these films a yearly viewing ritual, to make sure I've got my life priorities in order.  To make sure I'm not lying to myself.  To make sure I'm not lying to others for my own benefit or to their detriment.  To make sure I'm not living my life to live up to the same pipe-dream (i.e. ""American dream"") lies.

But instead they feel trapped by the boredom, conformity and mediocre that surrounds them. April, herself a frustrated actress, suggests that Frank quit his job and move the family to Paris, where they can escape the ""hopeless emptiness"" and find to a way to feel ""alive"" again. Frank is receptive to the idea at first. But a job promotion and April's unexpected pregnancy cause Frank to re-evaluate their plans. April remains dedicated to leaving and their marriage descends into tragedy.

It's been a long time since I've seen a movie I was this conflicted about. From a critical perspective this is a great film. The acting is brillant, the 50's era set designs are terrific and, just like in ""American Beauty"", Sam Mendes is a director who's not afraid to take chances and ask big questions. On the other hand, Frank and April are both so narcissistic it is sometimes hard to feel empathy for their plight.

Also this film may be the victim of bad timing, as the current economic downturn has most people more concerned with trying to maintain their small slice of the ""American Dream"" rather than raging against it. Still I admire the movie's artistic ambition and willingness to confront the ""hopeless emptiness"" we all feel sometimes.

3399949,4,B0016Q2D66,"This is a cinematic poem about what the archetypical ""middle-class white American suburban life"" can do to ones marriage, life and ultimately to ones own humanity: What it does is simply cut life and humanity off at its emotional knees, inevitably turning the faade of order and tranquility into downward cycles of despair, and eventually into self-hatred and barely containable underlying currents of violence: The collective neurotic American emotional condition.

Directed by Sam Mendes the screenplay is characterized by, and dominated by, subtle clashes of many ""mini-moral"" sub-themes - the lost of freedom, having to work in jobs that are hated, having kids too early, unplanned pregnancies, affairs with neighbors and colleagues, the desire, but not the will to run away from it all, and then of course, the 800 pound gorilla in the back of the room, abortion.

At the bottom of all of this is the self-made trap of emptiness and hopelessness that middle-class suburban life of the 1950s represented. Unwittingly, the Wheelers have traded in their freedom for conformity and the always limited but illusory security that middle class suburban life offers. April is the stronger of the two, and thus experiences the growing despair at a higher and much more intense level. And although interesting in its interplay of subthemes, the story, otherwise has a kind of ""vanilla"" flavor to it. In retrospect, it seemed thin in the extreme.

The talents of both actors appear to be much too high-powered for the emotional level of this vehicle. The script should have been reserved for those fresh out of acting school. After ""The Reader,"" Kate has set the bar for her own acting so high, that there are unlikely to be many more roles that can truly test the outer ranges of her abilities. She has raised her game to the level that she now has the ultimate actors dilemma: her enormous talents have already out-paced the best screenplays available in Hollywood. And, as was the case for most of this movie, she will increasingly be left on the set unchallenged with nothing much to do.

Leonardo DiCaprio, still in my estimation, the most under-rated actor in Hollywood, has an entirely different set of problems. His role in this movie just confirms further the Chameleon-like nature of this actor and his acting abilities. That he has such ability is both a virtue and a curse. It is a virtue because it keeps his acting always fresh and alive. He is like a random variable. One does not know when or where he is going to show up in his role; and that is unbelievably exciting. But wherever and whenever he shows up, he will not just ""inhabit the role, he will take it over and ""possess"" it.

The curse however is that chameleons tend not to become truly great actors because defining who they are gets lost in their catlike abilities to switch from one persona to another -- without leaving even a trace of their own humanity behind the actor's mask they wear. Indeed, I understand that this is the very essence of great acting. Yet, by the calculus of the ""movie Gods,"" four ""near great movies"" will never add up to ""one great movie."" If you don't believe it, just ask Samuel L. Jackson.

And while I would argue that DiCaprio's acting is a slight cut above Jackson's, they both suffer the same dilemma: It is difficult to locate and center their humanity in their roles. In this movie, as in Blood Diamonds, DiCaprio did indeed get to flex his ""chops."" He is a thrilling actor, but who the hell is he?

Frank has a job as a salesman in New York City, April is a housewife and mother with unrealized dreams of being an actress. Moving to Paris seems to be the solution to their stagnant lives. But, comfort, fear and the inability to blindly leap proves to be the catalyst that makes them reach their boiling point.

Frank and April always thought they were above it all, above the suburban lifestyle, that they were special and this was just a stop on the road to something marvelous. Then, they start to confront the idea that they are just like anyone else, that this is their life now and forever and that they have and are living a frustrated and unrealized life. Frank and April feel trapped in their suburban life. They resent the job, the house and also their marriage. Their unfulfillment and general unhappiness lead to explosive quarrels that little by little corrode the couple's relationship. The movie was raw and honest, delving deeply into a relationship and the idea of living a compromised life. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio were nothing short of astounding in their performances and the movie itself was perfectly and artistically shot. 4.5 stars.",1231804800,,1296,4.917808219178082
3399953,4,B0016Q2D66,"There are really two versions of the 1950's. There's the pop culture 1950's (ie Leave it to Beaver and Father Knows Best) that celebrate American norms and conventions and the high culture 1950's (Salinger's Catcher in the Rye and Ginsberg's Howl but also Jazz and abstract expressionism) that find American norms and conventions to be both phony and oppressive.  In Yates' Revolutionary Road both the low and the high culture versions of the decade are present but the Wheelers (Kate Winslet's ""April"" and Leonardo DiCaprio's ""Frank"") cannot decide which version they want to subscribe to. When they first meet they are each seduced by the other's contempt for mainstream corporate America and they both dream of escaping its safe but uninspiring clutches even though neither of them can imagine a viable alternative. Once they marry and start a family, however, Frank Wheeler finds himself working for the corporate America that he claims to detest and this is perceived by wife April as a betrayal of his true calling and their oppositional bond. But Frank is a divided creature. He suspects that he doesn't have any real talent (for transforming himself or the world) and that life is most tolerable/enjoyable when one does not ask too much of oneself. Because of his willingness to live within the status quo instead of outside of it problems arise between Frank and April because according to April Frank is no longer the man that she fell in love with. But April also has inner conflicts of her own and is an equally divided creature. Although early on it appears that aspiring actress April accepts the fact that she has no real talent and willingly assumes the role of wife and mother, the artist in her never stops aspiring. The relationship initially fueled by shared aspirations becomes one of mutual disappointment. Early on Frank and April dream of living in Paris but only Frank is willing to let that dream die. Long after the middle-aged Frank himself has discarded it Paris remains for April a symbol of the independent life that she wants but that is, in 1950's America, unavailable to a woman.

Realists will sympathize with Leonardo DiCaprio's handsome and eternally boyish but underconfident Frank. Frank increasingly loses faith in his ability to accomplish anything in the arts and instead uses his ""talent"" with words to sell products. DiCaprio does an excellent job at showing how easily and seamlessly Frank slips out of one world (an artsy gathering where talk is life) and into another (where talk is a commodity).

Social discontents will sympathize with Kate Winslet's beautiful but tragically conflicted and unfulfilled April. She is a woman who very much wants to be married to an artist (a liberator) but who finds herself married to a corporate player (and corporate culture with its masculinist and chauvinist social rituals tends to cultivate in its members a sense of male superiority and material well being as the only measure of success).

Neither Frank nor April possess any measurable artistic genius but there is genius in DiCaprio's and Winslet's portrayal of Frank and April.  Because April refuses to abandon her dreams her life is more difficult than Frank's and the role of April is more demanding to play. Winslet must hit many notes in this performance and she hits them all with consummate perfection. April is sometimes quietly desperate and sometimes not so quietly desperate, she ranges from rebellious and unruly captive to dutiful housewife and Winslet captures each nuance of this character's ongoing struggle for self-definition brilliantly. Winslet does the impossible, she makes each gradation of this complex character readable. Ultimately, April is the rebel/artist that she wishes her husband were but in order to fulfill her function as housewife she must stand by dutifully as he becomes more and more settled into the bourgoisie existence that she finds so stifling. Winslet captures April's seething and subversive spirit and her mounting frustration perfectly. Winslet completely inhabits this character's every thought. Because of Winslet we can feel April's wildness, her need to resist, and her growing desperation and sense of futility. Its a heartwrenching performance.

But DiCaprio's performance as Frank is almost as good. Frank is a restless man who at first resists the mainstreaming ethos of American corporate culture (which is at this time a boy's club) but finds the perks are just too hard to resist. He's like Pacino in the Godfather. He wants out but it just keeps pulling him back in. Because he fails to break free from the corporate machine and assert his own identity he remains conflicted over whether he really is a man or not. The corporate world promises wealth and the ""freedom"" to travel but at what cost to oneself? Frank is the American tragedy. He chooses a well-paying occupation and affluent life over an interesting one.

Another of this films many virtues is the insight it offers into the way males and females victimize each other to momentarily empower and/or escape themselves.

Whether Yates' novel is proto-feminist or not, Mendes' adpatation certainly is that. In 1961 (the year the novel was written) the revolution that would thaw the stifling conformist cold war male-centric 1950's for good was coming but it wasn't there yet.

Honorable mentions must also go to supporting players Kathy Bates and Michael Shannon as Helen Givings and her ""insane"" son John. These two represent the two sides of the decade perfectly and they provide comic relief of the most unusual sort. Bates is excellent as a good-intentioned but meddling realtor who keeps showing up at the worst possible moments. She keeps lifes troubles at bay by placing her own cheerfully palliative spin on each sign of discontent. Her son John mocks her attempts to put a sunny face on everything and he mocks everyone else's attempts to find comfort in a world that he views as hopeless. John's impromptu diagnoses of other people's problems are blunt and brutal and merciless but they are also a welcome relief (in a strange kind of way) since he actually brings out into the open what everyone else tries to suppress from view. This character's bleak world view provides the perfect high cultural counterpoint (no other era witnessed the early death or decline into madness of so many of its high cultural stars: Jackson Pollock, Delmore Schwarz, John Berryman, Sylvia Plath...) to the compulsory optimism of the pop-culture-crazy 1950's.

Be warned, the film's overall vision is exceptionally bleak, but individual performances allow us to see and transcend the limits of both versions of the 1950's even if the characters themselves cannot.",1231459200,7,6720,5.084315503173164
3399954,1,B0016Q2D66,"I really hate ""Revolutionary Road"", the new film starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet and directed by Winslet's husband, Sam Mendes (""American Beauty"", ""The Road to Perdition"").

After a very brief scene showing Frank and April (DiCaprio and Winslet) meeting at a party in New York City, circa the late 40s or early 50s, the film flashes forward almost a decade and we watch as Frank and April fight about how unhappy they are living in the suburbs. April is going stir crazy spending her days in the suburbs, taking the garbage out, and Frank commutes to New York City to work in a cubicle writing sales materials for the Knox Corporation. It's Frank's 30th birthday and his entire world is crushing in on him. When he returns home, April and the two kids sing ""Happy Birthday"" and give him a cake, complete with lit candles. But Frank is still unhappy. April suddenly comes up with an idea. They will uproot the family and move to Paris, the only place Frank has ever felt 'alive'. She will get a job and Frank can study and read and decide what it is he wants to do with his life, what it is he is good at. When they tell the neighbors, their friends, Shep and Milly (David Harbour and Kathryn Hahn), who are even more entrenched in suburbia, their plans, Shep and Milly are not encouraging.

At one point late in the film, very late, April turns to Frank and says ""Can we just not talk about anything for a little while?"" Hallelujah, sister. Maybe if they talked less during the film, there would be less fighting. Maybe we would see more of their life and the decisions that led them into this predicament. Maybe ""Revolutionary Road"" could've provided a scathing portrait of how two young people end up living in suburbia and are unable to cope with the limitations of such a life. Actually, in this film, that means they are dead and must make stupid, irrational decisions in an effort to live.

In ""Road"", practically the entire film is about Frank and April being unhappy with each other. It makes sense that so much of the film concentrates on them; Leo and Kate are the stars and they appeared together in the number #1 money-making film of all time. I will never understand why filmmakers think it is a good idea to put two people the public love so much in a film in which all they do is fight? It just makes the entire film uncomfortable to watch and leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Exactly what every filmmaker should be striving for. The only way to make this type of story work is to show us events leading up to these arguments, to provide some sort of counterpoint, to give us a flavor of why they fell in love in the first place. Strangely, these films almost never seem to do this, skipping directly to the fighting and the fireworks.

So it is even more perplexing when director Mendes shifts away from the action and gives us an interlude with Shep and Milly, or introduces a busybody realtor played by Kathy Bates and her mentally ill adult son played by Michael Shannon. These moments pull us away from the main story, which means we are pulled away from the constant fighting and self-loathing, which isn't a bad thing. But as a filmmaker, Mendes should not be introducing these elements unless they help to move the story forward. Concentrate on Frank and April. They are the reason we paid $12 in the first place. The scenes with Kathy Bates and Michael Shannon are particularly egregious and stick out like a sore thumb. Did Mendes really believe these characters were realistic? I get the purpose of Shannon's character, but it is always a tricky thing to introduce a mentally ill character. It is difficult to make them believable. And in ""Road"", Shannon isn't believable. He is as theatrical as April wants to be in her nascent acting career.

When I initially saw the trailer for this film, I suggested it to my mother as a possible Christmas Day film. She immediately nixed it. ""Oh, no. When I saw that trailer Aunt Kathy and I laughed and thought they were play acting"". In a way, she isn't far from the truth. Leo's Frank Wheeler turns 30 at the beginning of the film. This prompts him to have a mid-life crisis, have an affair, loathe the sight of his wife and family, etc. Kate's April would be about the same age. This young couple is apparently very self-aware of their problems to be so unhappy at 30. Especially when neither demonstrates a real calling for some great life as an artist, writer, dancer, and the like. Generally, people experience their mid-life crisis at least a decade later. Good for them. Maybe when they grow up they'll be able to live a happy life.

Or maybe not.

Early on, Frank watches April performing in a play that appears to be put on by a local community theater. It doesn't go well and Frank tries to say a few encouraging words, But April is just as aware that it didn't go well and they fight during the drive home. Unfortunately, the entire film seems like kids play acting the roles their parents should be playing. DiCaprio still has amazing boyish good looks, despite a few more wrinkles, and just seems miscast as a 30 year old experiencing a midlife crisis. It doesn't help that many of their arguments devolve into each of the characters throwing multi-syllable words at each other that just don't seem natural. It makes them sound like they are regurgitating bad Freud they learned in a college course they recently completed. Worse, it makes them seem like they are spouting over written, stagy dialogue. I just never bought DiCaprio as a defeated businessman and father. In a couple of scenes, he has lunch with a few co-workers, one of whom is played by well-known character actor Dylan Baker. Baker is 15 years older than DiCaprio. I buy HIM as a disenchanted, middle aged man experiencing a mid-life crisis. DiCaprio is simply too young. Winslet fares better, but she also tends to start yelling at Frank, using words that just don't flow naturally and seem stagy and over-written, making her character seem like a little kid playing a grown up role.

There are many, many scenes in which Frank, April, their friends and his co-workers are pictured smoking and drinking. This also seems to make both DiCaprio and Winslet seem younger than they actually are. They are acting like college kids away from home for the first time. Scotch, Bourbon, Whiskey, Gin, Rye, Beer, Wine, Cocktails? Sure. Let's try them all. Could be fun.

""Revolutionary Road"" is a trial to sit through. Wait until it comes out on DVD and rent ""The Break-Up"" to go with it. The perfect double bill. Just make sure you're stocked up on the anti-depressants before hitting PLAY.",1231027200,21,6641,4.6069315300084535
8264163,5,B0016Q2D66,This is a movie about a dream lost. It isn't for the faint at heart or the simple minded. It is a complex and raw look at what happens when a couple loses their dreams and are no longer walking the same path. These two artists started down a road planning to live an extraordinary life but the need for the security seeped in and made them forget. Most people have to choose between security or an extraordinary life. That choice can ruin marriages and worse. In a desperate attempt to reclaim their ideal things spiral out of control. I couldn't look away and was deeply moved by the story. It's not a happy one but maybe it will break some free of their bonds of banality.,1524355200,,674,4.31496062992126

8264165,5,B0016Q2D66,"This is one of my favorite movies yet. Painful, insulting, anything but a fairytale... such is life. This is a VERY realistic approach on the cookie cutter life. The fear of being complacent adjacent to the fear of being judged and daring. Its everything that our inner selves face every year. We are happy, and yet are we? Are we making good or bad decisions, and are they good because they're responsible or are they bad because they're the decisions we want? We live to find ourselves and end up being tied to our professions and customs. Its everything we are scared of and yet everything we are used to. Its a cry for help and yet a reminder to be happy with what weve got. Its a grass is always greener, yet be grateful we have grass kind of movie; and yet.. does having grass even matter? An absolute outstanding performance from both timeless performers - a must watch for realists. I have been debating on watching it for weeks and cant believe good films like this are still being made.

I realize that this is regarded by many as a masterpiece, and maybe it's in part due to the fact that I don't find Leo to be that compelling of an actor, but I quit watching this movie even before it was done and I hardly ever do that. In fact, I can't remember the last time I have. Mopey, self-involved, can't see the world beyond themselves characters that essentially made me rage quit.
