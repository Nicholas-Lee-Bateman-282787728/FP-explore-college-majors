1937340,4,B0000E69JB,"Marthe Keller stars in ""And Now My Love,"" a sweeping examination of French life during the 20ths century.  The film opens in black & white, tracing the beginnings of film and cinema.  A multitude of stories are told in brief snippets before the focus settles on one family - a French Jewish mogul and his daughter (Marthe Keller).  A parallel story is interspersed into the action as well, telling the story of a young criminal, Simon (Andr&eacute; Dussollier), who later discovers photography and filmmaking.  The story builds toward a rather predictable climax, but with some unexpected stops along the way, including a bizarre trip to 1990.

Director Claude Lelouch, who is still making movies today, is considered one of the geniuses of French cinema, and this film is certainly impressive.  I particularly appreciate his music selections - along the way, the music tells perhaps a stronger story than does the actual plot.  Ultimately, ""And Now My Love"" is truly a filmmakers' movie; it reminded me of ""8 "" and ""Day for Night"" in that respect.

French films of this period often focused on politics, workers' unionizing, and class - ""And Now My Love"" is a model of that theme.  As a result of the material's focus, I didn't particularly enjoy the film; however, I respected its vision and execution.  Everything about it is top-notch; the directing, acting, and cinematography particularly deserve praise.  In addition, the screenplay, which was written by Lelouch and his long-time collaborator Pierre Uytterhoeven, was nominated for an Oscar.  I just didn't enjoy the plot and themes explored.  Viewers with a special affinity for European politics of this era will likely enjoy this movie more than did I.  If you really loved movies like ""Z"" or ""Weekend,"" then you'll probably adore ""And Now My Love.""",1121385600,9,1810,5.030201342281879
1937341,4,B0000E69JB,"Claude Lelouch's ""And Now My Love"" is the story of two people. One who has nothing but wants everything and one who has everything but wants nothing.

 Simon, has been in prison twice, one for theft and once for making pornographic films, he then decides to go straight and make conventional films, to great success. Sarah, was born in luxury. After her father's death she has so much money she doesn't know what to do with it. Money or men do not bring her happiness, only problems. In movie terms these people were made for each other.

 ""And Now My Love"" could also be described as the story of the 20th century. It starts off in the early 1900s and we meet Sarah's grandmother and mother. Than the Simon character is introduced. It goes through much of the events of world history including WW1 & WW2, Kennedy's assassination, Vietnam, Marliyn Monroe's death and the Nixon administration.

 I could see why some would not like this movie. They may feel ""And Now My Love"" is too political. Lelouch is injecting his beliefs on us too strongly, too forecefully. This also happened to Jean-Luc Godard's ""Tout va Bien"". But I disagree up to the point where I'd call both films masterpieces. One of the reasons I like both films so much is because they have ideas and stick to them. They are about something. And that's what the best films do. They have an opinion - there's nothing wrong with that. Whether I agree with people like Lelouch or Godard I find immaterial. You don't have to agree with a film or book 100% to respect what it has to say. Just because some may disagree with the philosophy of Descartes or Hume doesn't mean they are ignorant. Or is Freud stupid because you find Carl Rogers more stimulating? I don't think so. It takes a lot more than that. Say, oh, I don't know, lying about Iraq? (Just kidding)

 One of the film's flaws is it goes on too long. The movie is 2 hours and 30 minutes. It could have been 2 hours and still be just as pleasing, charming, intelligent, enetertaining, and emotionally involving.

 Claude Lelouch, for those who are unfamiliar was quite the craftsman. Not to imply he's not now. Have you seen ""And Now Ladies & Gentlemen""? It's just that he no longer draws much of an audience or conversation. He has though made some great works including ""A Man & A Woman"", ""Les Miserables"" and this film.

 Bottom-line: One of the most pleasing films I've seen by Claude Lelouch. A movie with lots of ideas and a definitive viewpoint. Should please those with an open mind.",1111363200,20,2512,4.557777777777778
1937342,5,B0000E69JB,"I, too, had only seen the American ""video"" version (not sure what version that would be, as I understand there to be more than ""two"" versions of this film) and was all jazzed by the final meeting in the airplane ending.  But let me say that I think the ""future"" ending that everyone is all riled up about is quite charming and harmless.  I mean, the set design is most impressive and there must be a cast of hundreds.  And the music by Francis Lai is most appropriate:  a show-y, operatic, future opus played out in its entirety without dialog.
So, vote one viewer here who thinks the ""future"" ending is darn cool and a welcome ""addition"" (though, again, I am not sure that this is even an ""addition"", but part of the original French version, which should be preferred).",1082332800,9,770,4.478571428571429
1937343,3,B0000E69JB,"My absolute all-time favorite film, which I've watched countless times over the last 20 years (taped from a televised version from the Bravo channel).  Nothing could surpass the story of the inevitable meeting of the two primary characters of the film.  And when they finally do meet - it has been a moment that has always given me the cold chills (in a good way).
With that said, this new DVD release is a thorough disappointment.  Claude Lelouch, with all his lifetime of experience of film making has inexplicably chosen to restore nearly 20 minutes of footage that was edited out of the version that was generally released on video tape years ago.  Thus making this current DVD version an over-bloated affair, ending in a mind-numbing 10 minute ""life-in-the-future-unless-we-do-something-about-it-now"" sequence.  Sure, you can give some allowances that this film was a product of its time (originally released in 1974).  But for Lelouch to self-indulgently insert back footage that completely destroys the momentum of what should be that ""cold-chill"" scene - well, I think I've said enough.  Suffice it to say, a good film editor is worth his or her weight in gold.
Other ""restored"" scenes are fairly short, and don't really detract from the film; however the new English subtitles supplied with this release are questionable.
So, if you plan to buy this version (since the old video tape version has not been available for years!), make sure you know French, turn the subtitles off, and be ready to hit the fast forward button at the very end of the film.",1073088000,29,1560,4.954022988505747
1937344,5,B0000E69JB,"From the opening shot, in black and white with titles, at the turn of the 20th Century, showing a cinematographer shooting with a windup camera on a tripod, (meeting and courting the grandmother of our soon to be female lead, Martha Keller) to the final color image 75 years later, we're enchanted watching through three generations as our two hope-to-God will-be-lovers, are being prepared through history, war, and the process of failing, overcoming, succeeding, and living through those years (1899 to 1975) to eventually, hopefully become the two mature adults who will someday meet, when they will be ready for each other. The filmmaking itself changes to conform  with movie making history. When sound quickly follows, it follows in our film;  in the forties, we have color, and on and on.  One of the joys of rewatching this film is to notice how our peoples' paths cross, unbeknownst to them, throughout the film.  You're like a kid, pulling for them to meet.  I have seen this film 20 times and it's always brand new.  This was Claude LeLouche's movie after ""A Man and a Woman"" and I'm always surprised most people have never even heard of it.  It's a wonderful trip and my favorite film of all time.  I was a working actress at the time I first saw it and if I could have, I'd have happily carried cables or props on any Claude LeLouche set.  See it, by all means, and pretend you're going to see a 3 star movie so you won't be disappointed -- you know how THAT goes.  I'm happy to share it with you. Post Script added after I actually viewed the DVD -- they've included an ending different from anything I've ever seen before, and you know I've seen it 20 times.  Suddenly we're in some futuristic Stanley Kubrick/Buck Rogers world which they've apparently extropolated from an earlier scene with a futurist.  It's long and tedious, possibly 5 minutes long, before it finally gets back to the ending with which I'm familiar.  So, 5 stars with the old ending; only 3 as they're playing it out now.  Sorry about that.",1072742400,22,2026,4.638655462184874

8002035,5,B0000E69JB,"I cannot believe that no one has mentioned the stroke of brilliance that makes this film an ingenious gem.  The film is a ""boy meets girl"" film in reverse.  The two do not meet until the final minute.  Instead, the film goes back two generations, beginning with the grandparents of the boy and girl, who come from totally different backgrounds (she comes from a refined background, he is a petty criminal, and their grandparents also reflect these differences).  The film flips back and forth from past generations to present as the boy and girl grow up.  Their parents are equally different:  hers are Jews who meet when they both survive concentration camps.  Have you ever wondered if you and your spouse passed each other before you met?  Look closely at this film.....the boy and girl are in the same restaurant mid-film, before they even know each other exists.  And when the boys comes out of jail after being arrested for making pornographic films, he rises to become a serious filmmaker.....and is interviewed on a talk show.....and when asked about his new project, the film he describes that he is working on is the film you are actually watching!!  All of these nuances make And Now My Love one of the most well-conceived films I've ever seen.  I've seen it six times, and each time I discover something new in it.",1349222400,2,1326,4.721739130434782

8002037,2,B0000E69JB,"I was thrilled when this movie was finally released on DVD. I had taped it off cable years ago, but was never able to buy it on video tape. WHAT A BUMMER...this is a ""directors cut"". It sucks compared to the original theater version. All of the extra scenes should have remained on the cutting room floor, and the subtitles, although more faithful to the actual French dialog, are much less enjoyable and sometimes make little sense in English.
I'd love to have the original version on DVD. It was a truly great film.

I might also mention that I saw the original theatre release eight times when it first came out. It was a great film.",1217203200,5,636,4.435897435897436
8002038,5,B0000E69JB,"this has been my favorite movie of all time for over 30 years since it came out in theatres.  for years, some of the artsy movie houses still showed it in the early 80's (remember the nuart in west l.a?)  my husband recently bought the restored version for me as a surprise. we finally saw it the other night for the first time.  disappointed doesn't express the emotion i had when i saw the alternate ending they put on this version.  bleak, dark and morbid science fiction...why put this spin in a movie that is all about romance and destiny?  i just don't get it...WHERE CAN I FIND AN ORIGINAL VERSION OF THIS MOVIE?  by the way, if you love the premise of the movie like i do, check out the movie sliding doors with gwyneth paltrow.",1216252800,5,736,4.335766423357664
8002039,5,B0000E69JB,"I first saw this film in London in the '70s and loved it then.  The DVD release has preserved it, although I would agree about the ending.  The additional scenes were unnecessary.  As they said in Mozart ... ""too many notes"".",1169769600,4,225,4.439024390243903
