Very faithful to Kazantzakis' book, it represents the story correctly, without any exaggerations. It definitely makes you think and ask yourself some questions about life and cosmos. Great philosophy! Also, this is the movie that established Quinn as a famous actor! Enjoy!",1044921600,6,361,5.135593220338983

510174,4,6302753198,"This 1964 film is has a lot going for it.  Mostly, it's because of Anthony Quinn's outstanding performance as a middle-aged Greek drifter.  He's brings the ultimate joy of living to the role, in which he shows a reserved Englishman what the essence of life is all about.  ""You have to be a little mad,"" he says, and he surely demonstrates this.  He works hard, he loves women, he constantly philosophizes about life and he dances.  I immediately loved the character and wanted to identify with him.  There is beauty is what he says and passion in every one of his actions.
Lila Kedrova is also great in a supporting role that won her an Academy Award.  She plays an aging French woman who runs the hotel in Crete where Quinn and the Englishman, played by Alan Bates, go to work a mine that Bates has inherited.  She is sad, funny and flirtatious all at the same time, and my heart went out to her plight.  Quinn romances her and I could understand the relationship between these two people who both live their lives to the fullest.
The film has a message.  And that is to find joy in life. It's a good message and that's why this film is a classic.
However, I can't understand why it was filmed in black and white.  If ever a film needed color, this one did.  And even though Irene Pappas is given star billing, her time on the screen, as the widow who appeals to the Englishman, is very little.  I found her performance rather wooden as I did the performance of Bates.  But, after all, that was the role Bates was cast in.  Pappas should have been stronger.
I was disturbed by the basic story, which depicted some terrible cruelty by the townspeople.  And the Englishman's role of just standing by and doing nothing, even though he was the cause of much of it, was disappointing.  Bates' expression mostly stayed the same throughout it all, that of being overwhelmed.  And his face showed no acknowledgment of the horror.
I still recommend this film however - if only to see Quinn at this best.  And to try to grasp the essence of life that Zorba the Greek tries to impart.",1031961600,11,2074,4.439153439153439
510175,5,6302753198,"I'm puzzled by the previous reviewer who gave Zorba low marks because it failed to present life on the island of Crete as some kind of feminist utopia. In fact, Zorba is an amazing film BECAUSE it refuses to sugar-coat what was the hard reality for women in rural Greece - which is in fact, the hard reality for women in many rural, non-industrialized nations. (Greece was not industrialized at the time Kazantzakis wrote the original novel on which the film is based.) In fact, it would have been a betrayal of women everywhere to sugar-coat the discrimination these particular women faced.
Yes, life in Zorba's universe is incredibly brutal, and the fate of the young widow whose only crime was to reach out bravely to a sympathetic fellow human being, well, it's one of THE essential tragedies of this film. (Besides the tragedy of a man like Zorba who has survived fighting the Turks, only to be scarred by his own memories and regrets.) The film is brutal because life for these people (men AND women) truly was brutal. To present it as otherwise would be inexcusable. That there are moments of exultant joy in the midst of so much tragedy is the genius of Kazantzakis - and of Cacoyannis and his cast.
Who could fail to appreciate the courage and dignity of the young widow, played hauntingly by the austerely beautiful Irene Pappas? (She's also heartbreaking in the political thriller ""Z."") Anthony Quinn is wonderful as Zorba, and Alan Bates his perfect counterpart, but Irene Pappas is the woman you can't forget. The tragedy of the old French courtesan is yet another important way in which this film refuses to sugar-coat the cruelty of Greek village life in the first half of the 20th century.
Amid this difficult environment, Zorba's essential lesson is that one must live and somehow find meaning and pleasure. The offended reviewer below states that the moral is ""To attempt to find freedom results in death, and living a traditional life is a living death."" True, Zorba defies tradition, and battles conformity, and this is a good lesson. And he is honest in showing us that the attempt to find freedom involves great risks (certainly the young widow risks everything in her quest for freedom, and Zorba, in trying to protect her, takes his own risks), but that we must try.
This movie is unforgettable, but it's not for anyone who doesn't understand the essential role of tragedy, or who insists that films follow some kind of utopian script. At the end of the film, amid their colossal failures, Alan Bates begs Zorba, ""Teach me to dance!"" After fighting and losing, what else can one do but dance? Or at least try...",1016755200,15,2635,4.755458515283843
510176,1,6302753198,"If we look at this film from a different point of view, the movie becomes radically different. The society that we enter is incredibly brutal to the women that are portrayed. The young widow in the town is stoned by the townspeople and murdered by the enraged father of the man she rejects. The elderly woman who is Zorba's lover, is mocked by the townspeople for her folly in having an affair with a man who has no plans to marry her. When she dies at the end of the film, the townspeople loot her house and leave her corpse laying in the bedroom. Because she is not Greek Orthodox, they will not even bury her body. The only other woman of significance in the film, is the young woman, most likely a prostitute, whom Zorba entertains with his boss's money.
Clearly, the truths that Zorba proclaims in the movie exist only on one side of the double standard. If the women in this society embrace freedom and love, they can look forward to pain, suffering, and death. The women who have obeyed the rules of the society are portrayed by black shrouded crones that crouch in the corners of the room and gibber. Their self-efacement is total, they do not have faces or names. And these are the choices that are offered to the women in this film. To attempt to find freedom results in death, and living a traditional life is a living death.
I hope that this film does not reflect the reality of life in Greece.",1014076800,16,1406,4.411538461538462
510177,5,6302753198,"""A man needs a little madness."" - Alexis Zorba. And so is the tale of a seemingly crude and boorish man, or that may be the manner in which he is viewed by those very people Zorba would never want to be. Living with every emotion on his sleeve, Zorba watches a young struggling writer working restoring a mine with him open like a an emotional flower under his careful ""tutelage"" which revolves around dancing in joy and sorrow, living life every single minute and never fearing the inevitable ending of life. (How's that for a run on sentence? Ah, but it is the Greek way!). This film is simply wonderful and I am surprised it isn't shown more often in its entire form. I feel Zorba, like so many of our old favorites, should have a re-release on the big screen. We have forgotten how to live like this.",998006400,48,804,4.366666666666666
510178,2,6302753198,"I hate to say that this was one of my favorite films when I was in my twenties.

Now. with much more experience under my belt, I listen to Zorba's answer about whether he has ever been married, which is (from memory), ""Yes, wife, house, kids, the full catastrophe!""  And my older & wiser self automatically raises two questions: (1) Most people consider a wife and family to be the best of good fortune, and (2) Where are these people, now that you have obviously abandoned them, to become a Life Force of the Greek Peasantry?

The rest of this movie is no better, and goes straight downhill when the Life Force of the Greek Peasantry begins having affairs with women.

It retains some small interest as one more attempt to justify the idea that ""I am free to do whatever I want whenever I want,"" a thought that is absurd even in Calvin & Hobbes cartoons.",985824000,2,855,4.426751592356688

great acting

the clash between Apollo (Bates ) and Dionysus (Quinn). The gods always play roles in Greek tragedy....

Irresponsible Zorba laughs. drinks. makes love  and dances in the face of tragedy and setbacks.

The shy, rich, stodgy, bookish repressed Briton played by Bates can't. He is frozen, he is nonsexual, unable to perform sexually with the Greek woman (Pappas) who loves him and not the loutish men in her village that desire her. Bates is sympathetic to her.  He says he ""is different""...There a subtle hints he might be gay.

there is a restaurant on the Greek Cyclades isle of Santorini named ""The Mexican Zorba"" named for this movie. There is another restaurant on Isle of Mykonos called ""Zorba's"" . Despite its brutal nature, the Greeks love this movie and play the music from it everywhere! Greeks consider this movie a national treasure. Zorba represents the Dionysian force of life and that force is positive, even if the locals are ignorant and brutal and the Greek orthodox monks uncaring and superstitious

The Greek Orthodox church refused to bury the author in sacred ground because of this book and movie  and his ""The Last Temptation of Christ""

Anthony Quinn' s most memorable performance of a lifetime. Best performances from all three

This  and ""Never on Sunday"" are the two most famous Greek movies.

510275,5,6302753198,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS, but you should read it anyway. The review may enhance your appreciation of this fine film.

There are very few films which so accurately reflect human character or the moment of history that they almost immediately fall into parody. Pulp Fiction in my opinion is one; Zorba the Greek is definitely another. Anthony Quin was so compelling in portraying Alexis Zorba, a person who actually existed and inspired Nikos Kazantzidis to write his novel based on his life and philosophy upon which the movie is based, that everyone believes all modern Greeks are the same.

There are things going on in this movie that created quite a stir, raised a few eyebrows, that are known in the Greek community, but relatively unknown to non-Greeks.

This can be seen in the opening moments of the movie. The film opens with Alan Bates playing a stodgy Englishman, half Greek, half English, waiting in a transit office in Peireas for a boat to Crete. The office is miserable, it is raining outside, local Greeks are looking at him with distrust. Anyone who has been to Peireas at all know that the city looks nothing like it does in this film. Remember, the movie was made in 1964 and is probably more true of Greece then than it is now.

In some ways, Zorba th Greek is not only a fine film, but a social time capsule of life of Greece in general and specifically life in an isolated Cretan village. For anyone who has been to Greece within the last twenty years, one can see how much things have changed.

Or have they? Even though the Country has undergone a spiritual revival in the wake of Greeces economic crisis, there has always been an antagonistic relationship with the Greek church and clergy. That strained relationship is clearly present in this film. For instance, when Zorba released some rocks down the hill to test how to move the logs, two priests, one old the other young, are seen fleeing a cave on the beach below, running to escape the falling rocks. What were they doing in that cave, anyway? Embarrassing for them, Zorba just laughs. Why were they running away? Inquiring minds wonder. Then there are the several scenes where the monks sample the wine made at their monastery, clearly drunk as a skunk. Finally, in probably the most shocking scene, Irene Pappas throat is slit outside a church to settle the suicide death of a man distraught thinking he lost her affection. Here, the clergy does nothing to stop the village castigating the poor woman while dutifully conducting church services.

That scene where Pappas is killed, shocking as it is portrayed, is an open secret in the Greek community. People know that these honor killings occur, even still, but don't talk about it.

Equally shocking is villages treatment of Madame Hortense played by Lila Kedrova. The movie caused a stir when it portrayed Madame Hortenses house being raided by the womanfolk of the village after she died. While expressing shock and ridicule at the spectacle, Greek viewers knew, of course, that such incidents occurred, and likely in isolated villages, still occur.",1487980800,,3103,4.799625468164794

510587,5,6302753198,"Everyone knows the basic plot: young man painfully emerges from his stuffy, confining shell with the aid & ferocious friendship of Zorba, a man of the Earth who may be poor but is overwhelmingly rich in life experience. Along the way, there are moments of joy & bliss, as well as moments of deepest tragedy & despair. It's that second part that troubles many viewers, who ask how a film that features nakedly rapacious greed, superstition, murder can ever be called life-affirming.

It's because the film affirms life in ALL of its aspects. For too many people, ""life-affirming"" means nothing but good, happy, comforting things -- and that's simply illusion. Yes, life does offer such moments. But it also offers pain, loss, suffering, and meaningless absurdity -- and these things are inextricably woven through the joy & wonder of life. As Zorba makes clear, a man isn't supposed to float blissfully through life, because that turns out to be nothing more than avoiding it -- which, sadly, a lot of people prefer to do. But as a poet once said, ""We cannot choose what we are given, we can only choose how we face it.""

And that's the life-affirming quality of this film. It makes no promises of unbroken happiness & tranquility, because that would be a lie -- a lovely, reassuring lie to be sure -- but still a lie. Or at least it's a half-truth. What it does say is that life is to be met & faced & embraced in all of its aspects, even when those aspects are grim -- because that's the nature of being alive, and there's no hiding from it. This is a worldview that's quite Greek, and of course Greek civilization is one of the prime taproots of Western civilization. Go all the way back to Homer, and you'll find heroes who scales the heights of triumph & plunge into the depths of disaster ... and all of this is part of a life defined by blazing sun & blackest shadows.

So as Alan Bates' decent but emotionally virginal character discovers, life isn't safe -- but it is glorious, shattering, heart-wrenching, and above all an intense, immense blessing. And with such a man as Zorba as his guide & mentor, how can he do anything other than face his Fate, defy the Gods, willingly risk failure & destruction, all for the knowledge & experience of being truly, fully alive in that one brief instant? It's a far cry from the world of cozy illusions so many want -- or think they want, because that's what they've been sold -- but it's life itself. Most highly recommended!",1427155200,3,2474,4.5675675675675675

SPOILER ALERT:
How anyone can call this a life-affirming story overall, is a mystery to me. It shows such brutality especially towards the young widow who is harassed and ultimately killed by the cruel, out of control villagers, while Alan Bates who apparently is madly in love with her, does nothing to help. That was a hard scene to watch as were others about how they treated the older widow when she died.

510686,5,6302753198,"With Alan Bates as the man naive for his age and the worldly Anthony Quinn(Zorba), you have the makings of a 'coming of age' film, one of 100's.  Ho-hum?
Well, this was different.  The coming of age was not in jolly old England or America, or even cosmopolitan Athens.  No, the film was set in rural Greece, where we as moviegoers are put within the '3rd world' side of Euro countries.  No glossy Euro buildings or transporation lines, this is dusty, bleak, Greece, and Alan Bates sees people struggling not to get ahead but simply to survive.
Zorba takes the naive young man and teaches him some of the basic tenets of life, from money to love, he has some wisdom to impart for everything.  Apparently a 'wise old Turk' told him  everything that Confucius hadn't thought of.
It's impossible to describe the film more than this without spoiling it.  This film is neither a comedy nor a tragedy, it's a 'coming of age' film which can transform the views of people of any age...",1413417600,2,976,4.542857142857143

I swear Anthony Quinn could have been Greek, his mannerisms, his Greek accent, and the way he dances is a soulful expression of the Greek culture I grew up with.

I admire the Directors authentic approach in conveying a classic story of Greek Tragedy with each character experiencing his or her troubled life experiences.

Even Zorba with his wit and charisma is not immune to life's challenges and adversity. However Zorba's approach to adversity reminds me of the ""divine fool"", recognizing the seemingly small things in life are what is most important as they provide the means and methods to navigate through life's challenging times. I especially appreciated Zorba setting his boundaries regarding his gifts as a musician.

I would recommend anyone with Greek heritage not only to rent this movie, but to add it to your collection of timeless classics. For me it is a beautiful reminder to be grateful for the honor and privilege of growing up with a Greek family.

There is no reason for either of the main characters to have any attraction to one another, the Alan Bates character is more vacuous and simple-minded than any person you have ever met, the plot is implausible in the extreme, the dramatic climaxes beg for serious consideration and explication and are merely tossed away like chaff in the breeze.  It is insulting to the local Crete culture and is filmed in black and white, thereby rendering what one imagines as a ruggedly beautiful scape a bleak vessel.

When I see it now, my reaction is somewhat different. A woman is killed because she rejects the local men, and Zorba brushes it off all too easily. An old woman (his wife) dies in Zorba's arms but is denied a funeral because she crossed herself with four fingers - in other words, she was not a Greek Orthodox.
Today, those events effect me a lot deeper than when I was young, and I think I am a better person for it. I wish I could say that the movie has revealed something I didn't catch in my youth - but unfortunately, that is not the case.

There were other fine performances for instance Alan Bates was a convenient foil for Quinn in the role of the sexually repressed young writer. The other stand out performances were from Lila Kedrova, who won a best supporting actress oscar for her performance as the faded courtesan hotel owner of the ""Ritz"" while Irene Papas was very effective in her tragic role as the ill fated young widow.
This movie itself is tough to love in parts especially in the graphic scenes where tragedy befalls the female protagonists. One has to understand that this film was set on Crete in the early 20th century where sexual and cultural mores  were quite different than today .Still these scenes may be a bit jarring for some when viewed within the prism of the 21st century.

511033,5,6302753198,"I read some of the other reviews, which summarize the plot. I'll merely add that the movie takes place in rural Crete in the 1930's, where life was harsh, and there was a double standard for men and women. However, the character portrayed by Alan Bates isn't just a repressed British intellectual, he has actively focused his spiritual life inward, while writing a book about the Buddha and contemplating the void --he doesn't want to engage in life. This is reflective of Kazantakis' own spiritual struggles, which were marked alternatively by asceticism and earthiness. Zorba brings Bates' character back to the world--though he finds his time on Crete brutal and marked by tragedy, particularly because of the death of the young, beautiful widow, and the old,tragic,deluded,yet ultimately delightful, Madame Hortense.

To me the relationship between Bates and Irene Pappas contains some of the most incredibly erotic moments in cinema. The two are smitten from the first moment they lay eyes on each other, and yet because of her position in the village as a respectable widow,  his awareness of that fact, and his self-imposed reticence--they don't engage. Passing each other on a lonely road--all the sexual tension between them- everything that has gone unsaid and undone-- is more profound than the thousands of images of bumping and grinding that Hollywood has subjected us to. When he finally comes to her house in the dead of night, the emotions that pass over her before she gives herself to him: her desire, her shame, her joy the moment she realizes he will be a tender, giving lover are terribly moving, beautiful and sensual.

Irene Pappas is gorgeous in this role--so much pride, pain, longing and strength. When she is so brutally killed, not just for her sexual transgression but for her pride and independence in choosing a stranger for her lover--a slap in face to the 'honor' of the villagers who all lusted after her, Bates is unable to act, and is thrown back into his doubt and his own void. Zorba brings him back from that. Yes, life is brutal, humans are horrid, petty, jealous and stupid [ all over the globe, to this day]  but life is also beautiful--and for now, it's all we've got.",1366934400,4,2211,4.888
511034,5,6302753198,"Despite its somewhat undeserved modern reputation as a bit of lightweight tourist bait, Zorba the Greek turns out to be a surprisingly dark and anarchic film - not so surprising when you consider that it's based on a novel by Nikos Katzanzakis, who also wrote The Last Temptation of Christ. Indeed, the film originally began with Anthony Quinn playing Zeus (or at least Zeus as Zorba sees him) in a deliberately theatrically artificial heaven in a prologue that can be found in the extras on the US DVD and Blu-ray editions (but not the less fortunate Region 2 PAL editions).

It certainly paints a less than flattering portrait of Cretan village life. One Sunday the villagers leave the church to harry and then kill a woman they blame for a suicide, and when ex-prostitute Lila Kedrova lies dying they cannot even wait for her to stop breathing to loot her hotel. Functioning like some leaderless medieval fiefdom in thrall to machismo and misogyny, it is as far from a good commercial for the Cretan tourist Board as you can imagine.

Similarly, Anthony Quinn's performance in the title role is more layered than its many parodies over the years would lead you to expect. A loser with a gift for life who inveigles his sway into working for Alan Bates' excellently underplayed half-English observer of life who has come to make a go of his father's mine, there's a genuine sense of laughter in the face of death and despair in his performance. More low-key than you would expect, it is all perfectly underlined by Mikos Theodorakis' surprisingly varied and versatile score and Walter Lassally's Oscar-winning cinematography.

Fox's region-free US Blu-ray carries over all the extras from their two-sided US DVD release, and it's an impressive bunch: audio commentary by director Michael Cacoyannis and Nikos Katzanzakis expert Demetrios Liappas, the alternate opening sequence, documentary Anthony Quinn - A Lust for Life, 2 Movietone News extracts, stills gallery, TV spot; teaser trailer and full trailer (they're not all listed on the packaging but are all present and correct on the disc itself).",1366588800,11,2103,5.002857142857143
511035,5,6302753198,"This story of the unlikely friendship of an earthy Greek peasant and a repressed English intellectual still can bring me to tears.  Love and hate, good and evil, joy and grief, courage and cowardice engulf Bates' character Basil in the small village on Crete where he comes to discover himself.  In the bittersweet climax, when Zorba and Basil say their farewell on the beach, Basil asks Zorba to teach him to dance.  They clasp shoulders as Zorba leads him in the steps.  Through their adventures, Zorba, a Christ figure, has metaphorically taught Basil to do the dance of life.

It is one of the most perfect and emotionally satisfying endings in cinema.  The film, based on the book by Nikos Kazantzakis, has been beautifully restored by the Academy in a sparkling new print, with a vibrant rendition of the famous soundtrack.  I hope this DVD has captured that restored version.

511039,5,6302753198,"For starters the score by Mikis Theodorakis is fabulous. The technical aspects of the transfer I leave to others. This is  Great Greek  music! I cannot read the book except that I hear this score. I also hear Anthony Quinn (Zorba) as I read, so second point in favor.

If you only have modern eyes and ears, it is not possible to miss the misogyny. A woman is murdered by lynch mob. The victim knows that her killing is the way of her village even if she could not articulate why.  The portrayal of peasants is pretty much clich and overtly negative. Even the effete and timorous academic Brit (Alan Bates) however brilliantly acted is 60+ years later clich. On the other hand this is a world where if there is a school you can bet there is prayer in school and all of these villagers considered themselves to be very good deeply religious people. No one here has civil rights and no one has the money to even think about filing a lawsuit. So this really is the mythical past isn't it?

If you can watch as if looking into a window in time, it is a classic.

The central character Zorba is a con, a failure a womanizing drunk. And for all this he is Alive. He carries the wisdom of a long and varied, and mostly a failed life, but all of his scars are in front. That is he never turned his back. The key to Zorba is that he is every bit as small as the timid ""Boss"" Basil. The difference is Zorba does not admit to it. For Zorba to be alive is to be thirsty. Not being in trouble is to be going through the motions.  Ultimately Zorba is the classic con and lovable ne'er-do-well.

Yes this movie is black and white and yes it is paced pretty much as movies were paced 60+ years ago but if you can place yourself in that time it is an authentic pleasure. And if this is not enough, there is the music!",1363046400,4,1800,4.1671469740634

511042,1,6302753198,"I can't think of a finer example of the crypto-racism of the modern age than Zorba the Greek.

In olden days, we used to just openly deride and indict certain cultures -- whether it was true or not -- as being corrupt and backward, and/or even subhuman.  Nowadays we're not nearly so honest, and that's why so many of the world's problems only continue to get worse.

Nowadays we portray all the corruption, backwardness, and even subhumanity of a given culture -- whether its true or not -- while also working into that depiction a despicable pretense of respect for that culture as being somehow merely ""quaint"" or ""life-affirming"".  In this fashion, we romanticize and even encourage the proliferation of cultural toxicity.

511098,5,6302753198,"The DVD Zorba The Greek, a movie that symbolized my youthful awakening of a way to live still excites me.

Zorba, with Anthony Quinn, Alan Bates, and Irene Papas all give excellent portrayals of a study in three contrasting characterizations of  freedom, cerebral/intellectual, and the culturally familiar standard of female powerlessness, saved and protected by men. The themes are timeless as are the actors' brilliant performances.

I still love this film and find it fresh after all these years. The black and white feel of authenticity for old world time still thrills me. I can't tell you how I appreciate films made years ago as compared today. The perspective left the viewer free to experience instead of bombarding the senses.

511142,5,6302753198,"This is a beautiful and extremely raw film about an impoverished Crete, from the point of view of a sensitive literary man and his charge, the irrepressible Zorba.  I saw this when very young with my father; his point was that it is about learning to dance to the miracle of life, but for me it sparked a fascination with Europe, at once so similar yet so different.

It starts with a charming local (Quinn) hussling the unworldly writer, Bates.  This is a character that Quinn plays to perfect pitch, funny and full of life yet aggressive in his pursuit of his mark.  He accompanies him to Crete, where the writer inherited some land, including a decrepit mine that he wants to reanimate.  Zorba introduces him to the subtleties of village life in what is one of the most charming and believable portrayals of the virtues of ancient tradition.  I was swept into it as a child and now as an adult, though having lived in Europe for decades I am far more jaded than I was.  The landscape is dotted with the most vivid characters, from naive, wine-loving priests and rapacious villagers to pathetic spinsters or coveted widows.  It is poignant without Hollywood sentimentality.

The underside quickly reveals itself, in particular with a brutal murder as public retribution, which is both unjust and displays the helplessness of the protagonists.  It is tragedy of a type that AMericans would find hard to understand.  The writer watches with the deep regret of a new lover.  Another awful scene is the looting of a woman's house while she is on her death bed, a lonely creature whom Zorba befriended out of sympathy.

But the main plot line is Zorba as he teaches the writer about life.  Their relationship, with all its frustrations, is fresh and completely believable, an original literary gem.  The writer learns to laugh, to approach others for love, and to dance.  I found myself flooded with memories of my father, who loved to watch the dance but felt inhibited by fundamentalist religious teachings from his childhood.  He understood the vitality of spirit, the love of the moment and even spectacular failure, that Zorba embodies.  It was a great gift to me and everyone can experience it in this moving film.",1296432000,3,2217,4.774278215223097

 Firstly, technically, the DVD is not of great quality; the fabled greek landscape is all murky, the sound track undistinguished.

Far more importantly, the 'story' ,40 years later, is totally unacceptable. I would think that the people of Crete would not have been at all happy with it even in the 1960s. An innocent widow is stoned and has her throat slit...and our heroes do nothing....A dying woman has all her possessions stolen by not just the hideous crones invading her bedroom but the whole village invading her house...and our heroes do ...nothing.

And the heroes then make things better by dancing on the beach. So thats all right then. They celebrate the Greek way of life. Except it was not all right in the 60s let alone the 2000s.

I was very impressed with the direction and the movie's very faithful rendition of the original novel. What really makes this a fine film is the exuberant performance of Anthony Quinn in the title role. If ever an actor was born to play a specific part this was it. Quinn has the character's joy of life and he plays Zorba as if he was possessed. This was clearly the role of a lifetime for him and he was never better. Alan Bates does a fine job as the Englishman who takes Zorba with him to Crete and is gradually transformed by Zorba's zest for living.

The scenery is stunning even though it's in B&W, the raw beauty of the island comes through. Even the opening scenes in the port of Piraeus with the pouring rain are realistic and well done.

I loved the film , although there are two things that made me deduct 1 star. First the film starts and finishes very strong but there are a few scenes in the middle that drag a bit. Second the villagers are depicted as harsh and cruel without really much characterization. They come across as stereotypes and cardboard cutouts at times.  The director focused on the main characters and fleshed the cast out with people who look the part but I think they get shortchanged by the plot and screenplay.",1253232000,3,1381,4.429133858267717

Zorba does his own thing, lives life to its fullest on his own terms but, even so he is neither small nor selfish.  His compassion is boundless.

At the same time, having never been there, I rather suspect that the director/producers of this fine film have shortchanged the people of Crete.  The scene in which the French woman lays dying, surrounded by crones in the form of human vultures almost literally waiting to pick her bones, is both distressing and chilling.  Also, the scene in which the villagers slaughter the widow woman in a strange form of honor killing is also disturbing.  Hopefully, this is a gross mischaracterization of the people of the island.

The last scene in which Zorba and his young boss dance and laugh following the destruction of their mine and dreams is very similar to John Huston's great 'Treasure of Sierra Madre' in which two men, following the loss of all their gold fall into uncontrollable hysterical laughter.

Crete is portrayed as a brutal and intolerant place, where neither law or decency seem to exist.  Murder is socially acceptable and there is no governmental authority.

The plot of the movie just made me scratch my head and wonder where it was going and why?  The movie has no clear message to portray.  Further, it is unclear why the movie was made, unless it was simply to showcase Quinn.",1232841600,,662,4.5508474576271185
511210,2,6302753198,"I'd heard many great things about the film ""Zorba the Greek"". Now I've watched it. What do I think?

""Zorba the Greek"" is based on a novel by the same name. It tells the story of an Englishman (Alan Bates), who comes to Greece to open up a mine left to him by his father. Along the way he meets the exciting and interesting Alexander Zorba (Anthony Quinn). Zorba talks the Englishman into giving him a job. As the movie goes on, our Englishman falls in love, learns about life, and how to do Greek dances. About what you'd expect for a movie like this.

As for my opinions of it? Well, first, Zorba is kind of useless, isn't he? I mean, sure he has his whole ""lust for life"" thing going on, but when it really matters, what does he do? Nothing. When someone is killed, he does nothing (also, no real explanation for WHY this particular person was killed). When a rather odd plan he formulates goes down the tubes, he does nothing to correct it. He's big, he's loud, he's romantic, he's useless.

But on the other hand, Anthony Quinn's performance as Zorba is amazing! He really carries the film and elevates the material above what it would otherwise be. Bates does reasonably well, as does Lila Kerdova, who plays a Frenchwoman ""of a certain age"", and got an Oscar for her performance.

The scenery is nice, though I'm somewhat surprised they didn't film this movie in color. Since it was filmed in Greece, you do get a good feel for the people and the place.

But overall? I was disappointed. The movie wasn't nearly as good as I'd hoped it would be. The DVD is pretty good, boasting a commentary and an episode of ""Biography"" on Anthony Quinn.

And now that I am much older, I appreciate the film even more. I never tire of viewing Zorba, and the director, Michael Cacoyannis did an excellent job not only with the character development of Zorba (Anthony Quinn) but Alan Bates as well.

Moreover, the stunning and beautiful cinematography enhances the films appeal. And the decision to use black and white instead of color was a great decision. For some reason, the black and white gives the film something [I am not quite sure what] of an added and luring sense that color could never have given the film. Seeing Alan Bates' portrayal as the bookish and uptight Englishman sent to inherit his fathers mine, contrasted brilliantly with the 'Full of Life' and wisened character of Zorba.

The entire film is a lesson in life. A lesson at least for a young man (Bates) who comes to see the zest which Zorba exhuberates [even in the most difficult times] as a much needed respite from his own uptight and rigid belief's. The film works at every level, and it is the greatest [to me anyway] film or both Bates and Quinn's career. They are both gone now, however, they remain on the screen forever.

A few years later I read the novel and loved it so much that I then read it twice a year for about 10 years, then once a year after that (so I've read it about 30 times). My opinion of the movie dropped during the reading years because the movie only got about a third of the magic of the novel. Later I watched the film again and fell into love with it, a profound work in its own right. Film doesn't have all the fascinating detail and stories of the novel but does capture the LIFE, the struggle, the wonderful character of Zorba and many of the secondary characters. The movie is so much superior to most Hollywood movies, so character driven, so thoughtful, spiritual and deep as to make it hard to 'get into' right away. I would guess that young people today would have a really hard time enjoying it because it is antithetical to MySpace iPod cell phone culture, ie the ""culture"" of no-thought, music video, shallowness. It would be most interesting to screen Zorba for a group of 50 or 100 young college students and high school students and then survey their reactions.

All I know is that Zorba (who was a real man that author Kazantzakis met and lived with for some 6 months) should have lived a thousand years, just as Zorba said, and I'd hope that there is still some real hunger for meaning in people that would make them fall in love in Zorba the movie and Zorba the novel.",1156204800,11,1647,4.282051282051282
511397,5,6302753198,"""Zorba the Greek"" is one of those magical, bittersweet movies that reminds you what living should really be about. Not existing, but LIVING.

Anthony Quinn created a vibrant, lovable personality that leaps off the screen in every scene, and he rules the movie as its trickster god. Though ""Zorba"" reminds viewers that life can be unfair and bitter, it can also be full of joy, love, fun and simple pleasures. It's hard not to have some happy tears when this film finally ends.

Stuffy, prissy, uptight Basil (Alan Bates) is journeying to Crete to take care of his inheritance, some land and mines. On the way, he meets the scruffy, earthy Alexis Zorba (Anthony Quinn), who volunteers to be Basil's all-round sidekick (""I like you... take me with you!""). Basil can't exactly say no, especially since he is as different as can be from the native Cretans. In fact, he sticks out like a sore thumb all the time.

But Zorba has more than music and soup to offer. His gusto for life is all about women, wine and general joie de vivre, but he also hides secret pains in his past. And he introduces Basil to a beautiful, tragic young widow, an aging prostitute with a sad past, and the beauties of Crete itself. With Zorba to guide him, Basil finds out how to really live.

The setting is the stark, primal beauty of Crete -- lots of dusty, stony roads, mountains full of gnarly trees and cruelly beautiful landscapes. It's reflected in the heartless behavior that small communities sometimes have (such as the poor widow), but it's also a backdrop against which the simple pleasures of life (through Zorba) can shine the brightest.

Director/writer Michael Cacoyannis got two Oscar nominations for this movie, and it's not hard to see why. He made the dialogue quirky in a realistic way (""What kind of man are you? Don't you even like DOLPHINS?""), and let the story unfold in a natural, sometimes bittersweet way. The only problem is the way in which all the main women in the story end up.

Zorba is one of those really magical movie characters -- he laughs, drinks, weeps, dances, and worries about his crazy brain. He's an impish figure like a trickster god with no real harm in him. Even a collapsing mine shaft can't keep him down -- he just walks out and curses the mountain (""I'll eat your guts!""). Alan Bates is the ideal counterpart, as a repressed, bookish little Englishmen who starts to realize that propriety is overrated.

""Life is trouble. Only death is not,"" sums up ""Zorba the Greek,"" an enchanting look at how to enjoy your life. It's a memorable, lovable little movie, and a deserving classic.",1154563200,5,2605,4.67467248908297

Surprisingly Basil agrees, thus beginning a most unconventional friendship and a journey of self-discovery the likes of which has seldom be captured on film.

From the first sighting of Zorba peeking through the rain drenched window on the ship you become distinctly aware of the presence of a unique and magical personality.  A personality embodying the soul and wisdom of the ages. Priest, confessor, shaman, guru, enlightened master, friend and follow traveller. Reminiscent of the Greek God Pan, Zorba laughs, sings and dances through all the joys and tragedies of life viewing everything as a necessary part of the process of living. As Zorba tells his young friend and pupil, ""Life is trouble, only death is not.""

Zorba works his magic from beginning to end and will enchant the viewer long after he leaves us dancing with Basil on the barren sandy beaches of Crete against the backdrop of the beautiful Mediterranean.

Adapted from the novel of the same name by Nikos Kazantzakis and released in '64 'Zorba the Greek' truly captures the existential landscape of the 20th century and Anthony Quinn and Alan Bates deliver the performances of a lifetime. Add to the mixture the stark but inviting scenery of the island of Crete and an intoxicating soundtrack of traditional Greek music and you have one of the greatest motion pictures of all-time. Truly a masterpiece! OPA!!",1149811200,9,1962,5.006134969325154

Perhaps the best way to explain it would be to say that it takes at least three times to really ""get"" the film. Throw in a few tragedies of your own, and you might begin to understand that this film is about LiFE, the good, the bad, the unexplainable.

511401,1,6302753198,"I'm baffled by all the hoopla surrounding this movie. For years I'd heard it rapturously described as some kind of ""life-affirming"" cinematic masterpiece and, boy, was I misled!

Anthony Quinn, with his all-purpose ethnicity, does his usual schtick, playing a coarse, lusty peasant (Greek, in this case). Alan Bates plays a cowardly, effete British intellectual who must be taught how to ""live"" by the ""earthy"" Zorba. How original. Threadbare plot and tiresome stereotypes abound in this movie. The story is sluggishly paced and rather tedious, without a single line of fresh, original dialogue.

But far worse is the utter moral callousness of the movie. With the partial exception of Zorba, the Greek peasants are vicious, grasping, stupid creatures who sadistically delight in tormenting everyone. And worst of all is the astoundingly brutal misogyny displayed throughout. Because a young, wealthy, attractive widow turns down a lovesick local suitor who subsequently commits suicide, the villagers chase her down like an animal, stone her into a semi-unconscious state, and then finish her off by slitting her throat--while the ""life-affirming"" Zorba makes only a feeble effort to protect her and the cowardly intellectual Bates character (who is supposed to be in love with the murdered widow) just stands around and does nothing. Do these two ""heroes"" even attempt to notify the police about this atrocity? No, they just shrug it off--as does the movie itself, which seems to consider this shocking crime nothing more than a colorful little folk custom. Gee, how quaint to be able to butcher an innocent woman and get away with it! Gosh, I wish I lived in such a ""life-affirming"" culture. In another scene, a foreign woman, who had been Zorba's lover for many years, lies on her deathbed in her bedroom as dozens of shrieking old peasant women ransack her house and nastily taunt the dying wretch. (After her death, her body is left to rot in her room because she wasn't Greek and didn't belong to the Greek Orthodox Church and thus doesn't deserve even the decency of a burial.)

Now, if the movie had presented these despicable attitudes and atrocious behaviors in order to condemn them, that would be one thing. But Zorba himself, the one person we're supposed to identify with, the man being celebrated in this movie, comes off as mostly indifferent to the suffering of others and sometimes as slightly sadistic. ""I spit on their suffering!"" he growls angrily at one point. Our hero also mocks his sleeping lover as a ""dirty b*tch"". Nice. And after the murder of the young widow, he stupidly wonders, ""Why do the young die?"", as if she had passed away mysteriously from natural causes instead of being butchered by a howling mob. (Not too bright, that Zorba.) And when our hero isn't spitting on the suffering of others and deriding his lovers, he's busy cheating people and getting drunk on ouzo and retsina. Oh, what a delightful scamp you are, Zorba!

Yet all of this appalling, dreary, loathsome behavior is presented to us as something zestfully ""life affirming"" and quaintly charming! Oh, the joyful vitality of earthy peasant life! Actually, this movie is the best argument I've ever encountered for the blessings of modernity and cosmopolitanism.",1144713600,98,3264,5.050092764378479
511402,4,6302753198,"The film of the book is so true to the novel, when I read the novel the characterisation was so real. I love the music and Anthony Quinn certainly deserves his Oscar. This is a 1960's movie, in Black and White, and I think creates the exact atmosphere of the time and place being written about. It is a bit surrealist, because it is unfamiliar, but it is classic, as is the book.",1142812800,2,379,4.205479452054795
511433,5,6302753198,"Basil (Alan Bates), a somewhat boring Englishman that also happens to be a writer, goes to Crete in order to take charge of small inheritance. In his journey to that island he meets Zorba (Anthony Quinn), a Greek that is his polar opposite. Zorba is temperamental, and acts before thinking, enjoying life at it fullest with no regard for the consequences.

Circumstances, and Zorba's wish to earn some money, join this two men. Their interaction is something to be enjoyed as we watch ""Zorba the Greek"" (1964) once and again. Of course, the scenery is beautiful, and the music outstanding, but the real magic of this film is that it shows you what really good actors can do with a great script, and a director that knows what he is doing.

This film has hilarious scenes, but also others so dramatic that you will literally feel the pain of the characters. And of course, the ending is nothing less than perfect.

On the whole, I believe that this film is an excellent example of a true classic. Enjoy it.

511434,5,6302753198,"This film is one of the all time classics. It should be never remade, particularly never in  colour, nor with foreign actors like Penelope Cruz (unconvincing as a Greek) and Nicholas Cage! The Zorba  film succeeded as most of the roles  were played by well-known Greek movie actors of the early 1960s. Anthony Quinn is one of the very few foreign actors who  could successfully imitate a Greek character. The black and white format is essential to the black comedy/drama aspects of the movie. The novel must have been very difficult to adapt to the screen and yet it was exceptionally well-handled.

I first watched the movie when it came out in a London  theatre and bought the LP sound track as soon as it  became available. Anyone  who was enthralled with the  film should try and get hold of the book (available in French and English) or if able to read Greek the original version as inevitably some things get lost in translation. The film has a few minor  flaws (as opposed to goofs) which  may not be apparent. For example,  careful viewers  who watch the scene on the ship when Zorba rants against Alan Bates over a dolphin is incomprehensible unless one has read the book. There must have been some bad editing  of the  script or the footage and essential lines needed for the  interaction to make sense are missing.

Many people, even Greeks I know, are convinced that the story's Zorba was a Cretan. Not so, the book makes it very plain that he was a miner from Makedonia (not to be confused with the former Yugoslav republic of the same name) who in his own words was born under the heights of Mount Olympus, Greece's  highest  peak. Many  viewers, and some of the Amazon reviewers, wince at the violence  and the crude manners of the Cretan peasants as depicted in the film. The setting of the book, however, is in the late 1920s. The old  French courtesan refers to events that happened in Crete during its revolution against Ottoman rule many years  before  the setting of the film. Zorba, the Makedonian,  claims that he played a combative  role in that revolution.

Zorbas's straight man  in the film is played by a young Alan Bates as a person of mixed British-Greek parentage who inherits a mine. In the book  the role is played by the narrator, a writer, who is purely Greek  and who would have little trouble in a Cretan setting except that he is a college-trained intellectual,  one who is gradually won over by Zorbas's natural philosophy. The actual Greek title of the novel ""Vios kai Politeia tou Alexi Zorba"" , which  cannot  be satisfactorily translated, conveys this.  He does not inherit the mine, he rents it to occupy himself and get over the loss of his best frend killed in some remote war with the Turks near the Black Sea. The screen adapatation was right to omit the complex reasons for his trip to Crete which unecessarily interrupt the book's first chapter that really begins, as in the film, in a Piraeus quayside cafe during a storm.

The awful violence associated with the film's act of revenge, and  the separate scenes  of  the looting of a dying woman's house would be more credible  back in the 1920s but  very unlikely to have occured some  eighty years later. However, even today, a film director would have little problem in finding toothless crones in black  for extras in any Greek village. Greek peasants are not very careful about their teeth and women often crack nuts with their jaws.",1139097600,8,3438,4.633499170812604
511435,5,6302753198,"""Zorba the Greek"" in many ways is similar to Miguel de Cervantes' ""Don Quixote"". Alexis Zorba (Anthony Quinn) like Sancho Panza is the loyal guardian to his rationale, yet repressed Anglo-Greek 'Boss' (Alan Bates). Madame Hortense, the old French consort (Oscar winner Lila Kedrova) whom he proposes marriage is likened to Dulcina. He defends a widow (Irene Papas) when villagers attack her to exact family honour for the suicide of a son and would-be suitor, although she is ultimately murdered. As the movie progresses, we witness Alan Bates' character, Basil, gradually adopting more and more of the loveable rascal's traits, just as Sancho Panza began to emulate Don Quixote's chivalry and quest for adventure.

I agree the music and dancing is infectious. The scenery and casting extras on the island of Crete also lend credibility to Zorba's whimsical desire to tame their austerity and harshness, although he doesn't always succeed. Still -- and I can't emphasise this enough -- you cannot help but love this guy's audacity, his craziness to continually scheme and to rise above every adversity, hardship thrown at him. Zorba takes life by the horns and tries to live it on his terms.

Zorba's bacchanal lifestyle and outlook may seem overly provocative. Yet, he is certainly the most humane and civilised of characters when compared to the villagers on the island. In this respect, Nikos Kazantzakis, the author of ""Zorba The Greek"", lets it be known we should be less analytical, less dogmatic towards circumstances that befall us in life. Rather, we should learn to be more compassionate towards others; we should discover the beauty of singing and dancing with life...enjoying its pleasures and mysteries as it reveals itself little by little, day after day.

511438,1,6302753198,"All my life the name 'Zorba the Greek' has been a recognized name, but I have never heard much about the contents except that Zorba is an example of someone who embraced life and didn't take things lying down.  Since I recently saw 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' at my sister's house, I felt as though I had a clue now as to what that philosophy represents (MBFGW is a wonderful movie).  If there is a Greek in the movie who has any inclination to embrace life, it is only Zorba and none of the others.  The towns people are uptight, hypocritical and malicious.  The monks are fools who are tricked over nothing.  Zorba is celebrated for using his boss's money to pay for prostitution and carousing when he goes to town for materials.  Women looking for anything uplifting in how they are portrayed will look in vain.

I have lived with people who disassociate life from responsibility, and the experience wears thin very quickly.  Zorba himself seems to be compensating for a life that is basically empty and devoid of purpose or meaning. That leads to the message of ""eat drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die"".  Rather than having multiple layers, this movie comes across rather flat.",1127606400,15,1185,4.604761904761904

The score is uplifting. The high-contrast, b/w cinematography is quite beautiful.  While Anthony Quinn occasionally pushes the enveelope with his exuberance, his role is offset by the brooding Alan Bates, whose eloquent performance as a man between life stages, countries, and loves is remarkable. Lila Kedrova's Oscar-winning performance is a specxial treat. The extras  are entertaining, but unnecessary.  I lobbed off a star because my copy began delaminating (the plastic layers detached from the aluminum layer) after just six months.  Two-sided DVDs (like this one) are a drag, not only because they are more difficult to handle without scratching, but because their slightly wider metal layer may stress the polycarbonate wafers around it, eventually causing the DVD  wafer to split.

511441,2,6302753198,"I was sorely disappointed by this movie.  While Zorba himself is charming (enough to almost gain this review a 3-star rating on his own merits), the rest of the movie presents a blatantly racist, sexist and classist world view.

1)Racist:  Except for Zorba himself, the Greeks in the movie are cruel, heartless, murderous, plundering fools with no human compassion.  Additionally, Basil is a personification of the negative British stereotype: physically weak, weak-willed, uptight, and emotionally crippled.

2)Sexist: Women in this movie have three options.  They can be a prostitute, a crone, or a murder victim.  In each of these cases, they'll have their heart toyed with, be subjected to ridicule or worse for seeking joy and freedom in their life, and will likely meet a grizzly death.

3) Classist.  The cruel, heartless, plunderous, murderous fools aren't just Greek, they're *poor* Greeks.  With the exception of Zorba, the amount of compassion characters show is directly proportional to the amount of money they have.  The penniless peasant women clean their newly deceased neighbors' house of all possessions in a matter of moments.  The poor suitors play cruel tricks on the widow, drive a better-off suitor to his death with rumors, and then brutally murder a helpless woman.  On the other hand, the widow who owns her own farm feeds and supports a local insane beggar, and Basil himself shows unexpected kindness to his workers and those around him.

Zorba himself is charming, despite his rather human character character flaws.  His zest for life, his sometimes crazy schemes, his insistance on seeing everyone as an individual, all are endearing.  In any other movie I would have adored him, but he just wasn't enough to save this one.",1122768000,7,1754,5.123239436619718

Movie overall is OK, and it does flow (pulled along by QUINN's acting as it were). It's a B/W life drama on a lonely Greek island,  more of a character play than an action movie.

511540,5,6302753198,"... when this movie was announced the first time as being in full-screen format, which would have been more than a shame, I feel an obligation to correct both my former review and M. Harstein's review. Maybe he did get some other DVD edition I'm not aware of, but the one I just received from Amazon is a perfect 1.85 : 1 ratio; and, as well, a very good transfer. There is only a very short time, 2/3 sec., when starting the playing and before the movie starts, with the 20th c's logo in color and full-screen.

Is this answer satisfying for M. Hartstein?

I'm not sure if my first review and some others in the same line helped the studio to abandon the full-screen lunacy (I can't imagine why original formats are not the default for ALL DVDs, since the butchering of the widescreen is not ""fitting"" my screen, it's defacing it and disgracing it) or if the information at this time was not accurate: yet the logo before the start of the movie makes me think they really intended a butchered edition. But as soon as the info was showing it would respect the widescreen format I did order it, and now I'm glad I did.

Maybe Amazon who already ""let the studio know how many customers are waiting for this title"" could also provide the studios with

some feed-back about how many customers are not the least interested in buying DVDs which are only a part of the original movie (if the original ratio is 2.35, cutting to 1.33 will give you only a little bit more than half of it - exactly 56%).",1093305600,,1493,4.379061371841155

Lovingly produced, directed and adapted by Michael Cacoyannis (check out his 1999 film of The Cherry Orchard, with Charlotte Rampling and Alan Bates, to see how versatile this director really is), Zorba is a kind of Never on Sunday story about a free spirit (Anthony Quinn's Zorba) paired with an uptight Englishman (Alan Bates's Basil). They cross paths on Crete, and there the story unfolds.  The stars of this film are many: the excellent adaptation by Cacoyannis; the hard-to-forget music by Mikis Theodorakis (available, thank goodness, on CD); Crete as backdrop to the story; the Academy Award-winning black and white cinematography, black and white art direction/set decoration; and, Quinn, Bates, Irene Papas and Lila Kedrova (Best Supporting Actress winner), all superb in their roles.  At nearly two-and-a-half hours, the film holds your attention because of all the aforementioned ingredients. I had the pleasure of seeing Quinn and Kedrova on stage in the musical adaptation (Zorba) that toured for a while in the 80's, and while I enjoyed it a lot, I couldn't help but think of how musical the film was in all regards, and how the addition of Broadway-style tunes pulled focus from the simple power of the story, which was so effectively captured by Cacoyannis and his cast. If I had to run out of a burning building with only a small bagfull of films, Zorba the Greek would surely be one of them. It's unique and ultimately unforgettable.",1092528000,2,1533,4.9765625

511645,5,6302753198,"""Zorba the Greek"" is the three time Oscar winner that delves deeply into the rich cultural heritage of Greece and comes up a powerful, moving and emotional cropper. When timid English writer, Basil (Alan Bates) hires the enigmatic, fiery and lustful Zorba (Anthony Quinn) to work a mine he's inherited in Crete, a clash of cultural differences arises. Basil despises Zorba's fast and loose way with women but admires his work ethic and protective nature toward a widow who becomes the target of a group of jealous men whose advances the widow has thwarted.  Based on the best selling novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, the film's screenplay and direction belong to Michael Cacoyannis who excels at capturing the flavor and passion of the Grecian masses. Through Zorba's example Basil comes to understand his own shortcomings in life and ultimately grows to engage the world around him. The addictive mandolin soundtrack became an instant best selling record of its day.

Part of Fox's Studio Series, ""Zorba the Greek"" has been impeccably mastered for DVD. The gray scale is exemplary with sharp contrasts, solid deep blacks and a minimal amount of film grain. Though some of the stock footage varies in quality with the rest of the picture, there is a startling lack of age related artifacts. Framed in its original 1:85:1 aspect ratio and enhanced for widescreen televisions, this is truly an outstanding example of DVD's capabilities. Digital anomalies are practically nonexistent and the overall quality of the image is very smooth and easy on the eyes. The soundtrack has been cleaned up and remixed to stereo.  The original mono is also included. Extras include Anthony Quinn's Biography Special, a stills gallery, some news reel footage and theatrical trailers.

511648,4,6302753198,"Definatly a great movie to watch, but it really portrays the backward Greece of several decades ago. The movie portrays Greeks in a somewhat harsh and distorted way, sometimes painting a very bad picture.
After reading many of the reviews it seems as if people still think the Greeks are wearing togas, worshipping the Gods and spending all day studying philosophy.  This isn't the case, it hasn't been for over fifteen hundred years and if that is what you are expecting, then find out more about modern Greeks before watching this movie or you will be very surprised.",1084320000,2,569,4.8061224489795915
511649,5,6302753198,"Something is definitely wrong with this picture!! Where is Criterion, or some other company that is neglecting one of the greatest movies of the 20th C?
Cacoyannis assembled one of the most sublime international casts ever in this classic. Few movies can approach great literature as far as providing a microcosm of ""the human condtition,"" to use an overworked, but apt phrase. This is one of the few that can. The plot, which is secondary to the theme, revolves around the wizened, but still vibrant Greek peasant Zorba (Quinn) teaching the young, uptight, sexually confused (OK, maybe that's not PC of me, but it's certainly the subtext) Brit mine-owner ""boss"" Basil (Alan Bates), about the facts of life.
Zorba is one of the great lovable rogues of cinema history, maybe even the most memorable. Wine, women, song and dance are his credo, and we come to learn that they are his defense against some personal tragedy in his background. This film is unmatched in terms of playing the comic against the tragic, the many facets of life that color actual existence, as opposed to the usual Hollywood, one dimensional perspectives. There are layers within layers to the message here, just as in great fiction or theater. What it boils down to, however, is about friendship. Zorba and Basil go through so much together, running the full gamut of human emotions, that by the perfectly realized ending (the best I can recall in recent or distant memory, outside of Fellini's La Strada maybe [another Quinn movie, incidentally]), this viewer was breaking down in sheer joy/release/catharsis. The Greeks have long had a knack for this, have you noticed?
As a footnote, the soundtrack is also legendary, thanks to Greece's most noted score composer, Mikis Theadorakis. I'm not going to gripe here, but how did Alan Bates pass on without an Oscar on his mantle? This was essentially Cacoyannis' and Quinn's project, however, and they should live on in every film buff's memory for ages to come for this masterpiece on both their parts. Irene Papas, as a widow who shoots some of the most unforgettable darting glances in film history, and Lila Kedrova as the sad, but ever hopeful Madame Hortense, are also highly memorable. And where did Cacoyannis find those old, withered, diminuitive, toothless harpies that hung about the bedside like vultures gathering for a feast?
Do what you can to re-view this true classic on VHS while we hope and pray that the eventual DVD treatment will be of worthy quality.

511650,5,6302753198,"I watched this movie with great expectation. I first came across Zorba in a book of Osho. I must say that movie does not disappoint. The message of the movie is quite clear ""be a bit crazy, don't take life too seriously"", And I agree with that completely. Drink, eat and be merry. But the problem with this approach start getting clear as you watch, and it is here I think the movie or the thought behind the movie lacks.
How long one can avoid the question of his own existence, his identity. In this regards I like Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse which I think is an extension of Zorba.
Be like Zorba, but be aware the life demands more than.
Just add enlightenment to Zorba and you will get what Osho once called ""Zorba the Buddha"". That could be the best possible synthesis of a human being.  Remember Mr. Zorba we need to have a heart towards other as well. Highly recommended!!",1072742400,4,879,4.392638036809816

Whereupon Zorba cuts him off with the classic: "" What do you mean you don't want trouble?  What is life but to take of your belt and go looking for trouble! ""
Besides, as Zorba further enlightens him, God, who is very merciful, will forgive many sins. But there is one sin He will not forgive: When a woman calls a man to her bed and he will not come . . .
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Anthony Quinn plays Zorba, a man who lives through tragedy by women, dance, music and madness. He has surrendered to all the beauty and horror of life and embraces whatever comes his way.
 Alan Bates plays Basil, the bookish and reserved Brit who becomes both Zorba's boss and unwitting pupil after an accidental meeting brings them together during a storm on the way to Crete.
This is the simple premise which sets up one of the greatest novels and greatest films of the century, Nikos Kazantsakis's most popular work; ""Zorba the Greek""
 Quinn and Bates are phenomenal. Never better. The supporting cast is also superb. Perfect casting, subtle directing and a wonderful musical score.
The plot revolves around Bates trying to get an abandoned coal mine in the backwoods of Greece to produce. He's inherited it and if he can't make a go at it, then it's back to dreary old England and writing essays for a living.
Zorba, whose nickname is 'catastrophe' becomes his foreman. They interact with a young widow, an aging French hotel keeper--who was once a great beauty, and villagers that are straight out of the Dark Ages.
""Interact "" is a weak word. Both heaven and hell breaks loose in this gripping tale.
 It's a paean to lunacy. To the necessity to be 'a little mad' in order to find the courage to break the chains that bind us.
A forgotten gem. Told with savage humor and great compassion.  Another sacrament of the cinema.
Enjoy!",1069891200,13,2110,4.67654986522911
511652,5,6302753198,"I watched this movie like everybody else expecting to see greek elements of life. But i did not see anything greek particularly. A mediterranian warm-blooded guy meets with a shy englishman and with the help of this likeable greek they have a friendship developed. Love of life, standing against society against hatred, naive and simple lives, no deep philosophy just life itself without thinking and hoping for happiness in any situation.

511653,5,6302753198,"Since I am leaving today for a trip to Greece I figured I should watch ""Zorba the Greek"" since this 1964 film is considered the quintessential ""Greek"" film.  I have to admit my first reaction was to be glad I was not going to Crete, because the way the locals treated the beautiful widow (Irene Papas) and Madame Hortense (Lila Kedrova), the old prostitute, were outright horrific.  But this is why people like us and young Basil (Alan Bates) need to meet up with somebody with a zest for life like Alexis Zorba (Anthony Quinn).
Basil is an Englishman of Greek extraction who goes to Crete to check out a mine he has inherited.  Zorba attaches himself to Basil, ostensibly as a cook but clearly as a guide to the joys and tragedies of life.  In terms of Quinn's performance the only thing you can really say is that before there was Robert Begnigni there was Zorba the Greek when it comes to Mediterranean men who provided inspirational madness.  As Zorba tells Basil: ""Dammit, boss, I like you too much not to say it.  You've got everything except one thing.  Madness!  A man needs a little madness, or else...he never dares cut the rope and be free.""  +
When they arrive on Crete it becomes clear the mine is not going to pan out for anybody.  They move in with Madame Hortense, who is wooed by Zorba, who insists Basil go after the beautiful local widow.  After these tragedies all that is left is Zorba's plan for bringing trees down from the top of the mountain, an endeavor obviously equally doomed to failure.  This is why in the end there is only one thing a man can do, and it is in this cathartic conclusion that any and all sins of this film are absolved.
""Zorba the Greek"" is written and directed by Michael Cacoyannis, based on the novel by Nikos Kazantzakis.  The film won three Academy Awards: Lila Kedrova for Best Supporting Actress, Best Art/Set Direction, and Best Cinematography.  Quinn did not win the Oscar for what is clearly his most memorable role in a long and distinguished film career, but that is usually the case with actors and their greatest roles.  Marlon Brando did not win for Stanley Kowalski and Quinn did not win for Alexis Zorba.  What is a man to do in the face of such a fate but dance?",1047600000,70,2227,4.475247524752476
7831043,3,6302753198,"Magnificent performance by Quinn and even better by Kedrova. Another point to praise is the minimalist dialogue. The director lets the camera do the talking. Alas, Bates (perhaps by design) gives an almost personality-free performance as an Englishman with Greek ancestry, who gradually assimilates Greek culture. The big negative for me is that the plot verges on a parody of Greek peasant life. Perhaps I'm wrong: the director and the author of the source novel were both Greek and presumably better informed than I. Nevertheless, the scene in which the monks initially believe they have seen the devil (Zorba's face blackened by circumstance) and then that they have seen water turned into wine seems insulting to the Orthodox religion. The lynch mob, (almost) defeated by Zorba single-handedly is similarly hard to believe and the cackling crones and looting at the foreigner's death are unworthy.",1525910400,,901,5.263888888888889

Ironically, I must say that as I am about to turn 64, I've had a colorful and textured livingness! And I'm not done yet! It hasn't always been easy, yet I have LIVED, while still among the living.
