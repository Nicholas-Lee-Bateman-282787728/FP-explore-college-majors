2672735,5,B000JJRACI,"This is one of my favourite productions. Not only is it a fabulous opera containing  a lot of interesting, psychological material, but Martin Kusej knows how to put it on stage and focus the spotlight on the dark side of human nature, so that it almost hurts. This DVD also contains a lot of additional features including extensive interviews and pictured synopsis, which justifies the price.",1245801600,6,392,4.9393939393939394
2672736,5,B000JJRACI,"After listening to Rostropovich's EMI rendition I knew I would take an interest in a stage production.  The cover of this DVD version is a little misleading and so are some of the critical remarks: This show isn't about a complete sex act so much as it is about the tragedy of the misdirection of a passion.  The whole production is startlingly abstract in sets and action; the glass box as the setting for Katerina's home was an outstanding idea; the ghosts walking vertically was a startling addendum; the final scenes realize what I had until then considered an impossible barrier to staging: abjection of the prisoners, the desertion of Katerina by Sergei, the murder of Sonya (and how else could you depict a drowning on stage?), the last lamentations floating over the sentries and their dogs.  Really, really cathartic.",1238025600,18,826,4.885714285714286
2672737,3,B000JJRACI,"One of my problems with this production is the revisionist ending.

Now that there are no longer satellite countries, I guess since this is updated to modern times,  the treck to Siberia in the last scene would be unbelievable but the ending is jarring for all the wrong reasons.

The staging is effective but odd.  The first half taking place within a glass enclosed box obviously representing Katerina's entrapment as the bride of a impotent man.  Wooden walls line the back of the stage and the wings.  The production is stark.  A huge wow for Eva-Marie Westbroek as Katerina.  She has a voice similar to the young Eva Marton, which is saying a lot.  It's a huge sound and beautiful too.  Ventris repeats his Sergei here.  His voice is growing darker but he's looking bloated and fat.  What is a sexy and dangerous looking performance in the other DVD version, becomes seedy here.

The orchestra and chorus dominate this performance.  I wanted to love this, the opera is one of my favorites, but it's too odd and gimickey for my tastes.

There's also a tracking problem on the second DVD.  It's not my player because this does not happen with the other DVDs that were apart of my order.",1173571200,26,1189,4.617224880382775
2672738,5,B000JJRACI,"This is now my third DVD of Lady Macbeth, an opera which I would rank among the very best of all 20th century operas and of all Russian operas. Its strong points are very strong indeed.  The musical performance as led by Mariss Jansons is outstanding and there are no disturbingly weak links among the singers/actors. All leading performers deserve the wild applause they receive at the opera's end. And the sound on this DVD is magnificent. There is only one possible fly in the ointment and that is one's ability (or inability) to go along with Martn Kusej's stage direction. Sex and murder were done well and only in the last act - set in some kind of asylum or jail - did what was going on stage (people wandering around in their underwear) seem at odds with what was going on in the opera itself (prisoners marching off to Siberia). Otherwise I do not think the production gets in the way of the drama.  With repeated listening - and this production deserves repeated listening - I think its musical strengths will win out over any questions.",1170547200,30,1047,4.5638297872340425
2672739,4,B000JJRACI,"Following Rostropovich's pioneering effort from the latter days of LP, Shostakovich's second (and last) opera seems to finally reach its deserved status amongst the 20th century's masterpieces in the genre. It is an outstanding work, perhaps among the composer's finest, along with the 1st violin concerto, the Michelangelo Sonnets, the 6th and 10th symphonies, the preludes and fugues for piano, the late quartets or that jewel of an opera, ""The Nose"". The contrast with his own watered-down version (Katerina Ismailova) which I own on Melodia LP's purchased long ago at Collett's in London's Charing Cross Rd. (they kind of specialised in selling records from the iron courtain countries) is revelatory and would explain Stalin's disgust with this original version (funny to notice how prudish dictators can be, no? no remorse from brutally having people killed or exiled to Siberia, but scandalised at Mme Ismailova's sexual frolics; it is said Hitler was quite prudish too, as is Castro, were said to be Saddam Hussein and Kim il Sung or others of their kind) and later satisfaction with the composer's 5th symphony.

Visually the production is stunning, a winner in all respects and I must congratulate Opus Arte for making it avaliable on DVD. I knew of producer Kusej's work only from reference, as not understanding german I have not attended any of his theatre productions. I haven't seen the work's EMI release on DVD of a Liceu staging, but found Gramophone's review of it rather demolishing (I don't know if they have turned their eyes yet to this Opus Arte Amsterdam version, but I should expect nothing short of a most favourable review from them).

Musically, there are two real ""coups de foudre"": one is of course the superlative playing of the Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra, and the other the choosing of Mariss Jansons to conduct the work. Janson's key formative years at Leningrad under Mravinsky's wing assure us of a direct link not only to the composer via who was his most conspicuous and trusted collaborator, but also to the actual environment, politically and artistically, that hovered over the composer whilst composing this opera, which not only Mravinsky knew all too well but was a key player as he was able not only to survive it but also to excel within it. Singers-wise, top honours must go of course to Ms Westbroek, who sorts out an enormous task not only in vocal terms but also as an actress and stage presence (and she's also quite an attractive woman, if only she shedded a handful of kilos ...). She fully deserves every single bit of applause she gets in the courtain calls after the work's end. Ventris does not get an especially good comment in Gramophone's review of EMI's Liceu release, but as I haven't seen that one as I mentioned, I can't say if in the Amsterdam production he was better (or worse), I will only say that, from what I saw and heard in this Opus Arte video at least, he makes a powerful impersonation of what must be one of the most lustful characters in the history of opera, and he does so with unquestionable results; he not only does look the part, but sings it remarkably well as well. I did find the other important male singers rather low in volume, perhaps more than they should, the two Ismailovs as well as the drunken priest; they are in a league certainly different from Ms Westbroek's. And let's not leave aside the chorus's outstanding contribution.

So in all, a most remarkable result, with the utterly realistic sound one has come to expect from the house and the very apt and interesting supplementary material that has contributed to place Opus Arte above most other publishers of opera on DVD (and miles away from US publishers such as Image or Kultur, whose in this respect very mediocre products tend to reach our shelves this side of the Atlantic more often than Europe-based ones like Opus Arte, Bel Air Classiques or Arthaus Musik).",1169251200,51,3925,4.846497764530551

8151039,2,B000JJRACI,"I agree with other reviewers about the formidable singing of Eva-Maria Westbroek. And also about Mariss Jansons great conducting. But there it stops. Martin Kuejs directing is a modern interpretation that would best be described as eurotrash. Ugly, bluish tints most of the time, brutal sex scenes, nudity and stroboscopic light effects makes this version an evil affront to Shostakovichs greatest opera. There is a much better Blu-ray available; Lev Dodins beautiful version from Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, with Jeanne-Michle Charbonnet in the title role.",1470182400,,557,5.642857142857143
8151040,1,B000JJRACI,"""Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk"", Shostakovichs second and last opera, is a work of immense dramatic power. But it also engages our emotions, even though all the characters are thoroughly unpleasant. Shostakovichs marvelous music elicits our sympathy, at least for the heroine.

I had high hopes for this DVD, with the wonderful Eva-Maria Westbroek in the title role and the fine conductor Mariss Jansssons leading his great Dutch orchestra. And, in fact, it is an excellent performance in musical terms; the singing is excellent, and Janssons well articulates the musics dramatic power, satirical bite, and occasional intense lyricism.

Unfortunately, the production is simply awful! The director tells us in the program notes that he chose to ignore the Russian element in the work and simply stage the music. But ""Lady Macbeth"", though post-Revolutionary, is still a deeply Russian opera, and the plot grows out of the nineteenth-century social milieu. When this element is not present, the work makes little sense.

What we get here is a minimalist concept production, with the usual quotient of heavy-handed symbolism and absurdity. The stage is bare except for a glass-and-metal structure to represent Katarinas room. It rather resembles a cage - talk about brutally obvious symbolism! The sides and back of the stage are cut off by what appear to be rough wooden walls, though its hard to tell in the pervading gloom. The costumes are in a sort of generic mid-twentieth-century style and are decidedly ugly.

The absurdities are multitudinous, and Ill cite just a few:
Why is Katarinas room filled with shoes, a la Imelda Marcos, and why do the choristers carry them off after Boriss demise?
Sergei tells us several times that he sneaks into Katarinas room by a window. Yet we see him enter through a hole in the roof, with the aid of two large and obvious aluminum ladders.
Why do Boris and the workers skulk about with flashlights, but when Zinovy returns he carries a torch?
Why does fake snow start falling in the middle of Act II as the choristers are trudging off with their ill-gotten footwear?
Why does Katarina dump about a pound of rat poison on Boriss mushrooms? Does she think he won't see or taste it?
Why, during Katarinas little nightmare, do we see two naked men in climbing harness walking up the walls?
We are rather beaten over the head with the sexual aspect of the work. Aksinyas humiliation goes much farther than the libretto requires. The crucial sex scene at the end of Act I is fairly explicit, but it doesnt need to be; the music is quite sufficiently graphic. And then the scene is staged under a strobe light, which accomplishes nothing besides irritating the viewer. Later we have the insalubrious experience of watching two less-than-svelte opera singers cavorting about in their underwear. Having Sergei and Katarina copulate on top of Zinovys grave is more than a bit much.
The directors final blow is to change the ending. Katarina is supposed to throw herself into the icy river after Sergei abandons her. The director finds this too romantic an ending and instead has her killed by the other prisoners. Of course, in this production they are not trudging to Siberia, and there is no icy river! Perhaps the choristers enjoyed beating up the prima donna, but this is both sensationalistic and irrelevant.

As with several other opera videos Ive seen lately, Id like to watch this one with the picture turned off. But Ill continue to enjoy the great Vishnevskaya/Rostropovich audio recording and hope someone films a worthy production of this masterpiece.",1446508800,5,3588,4.973333333333334
8151041,5,B000JJRACI,"Shostakovich's Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk is an opera more heard about than seen. The facts of its notoriety are well known. After opening in 1934 in Leningrad and Moscow, the opera catapulted the 29-year-old composer to superstardom. Within two years, it had been performed 83 times to sold-out houses in Leningrad, nearly 100 times in Moscow, and reached the stage in London, Stockholm, Zrich, Copenhagen, Argentina, Czechoslovakia, New York, and even Cleveland.

Then on Jan. 26, 1936, Stalin showed up at the Bolshoi to see what the fuss was about -- and all hell broke loose. The Great Leader, entourage in tow, stormed out of his box before the show was over. Two days later an editorial on Pravda's front page condemned the opera and its composer. Lady Macbeth soon disappeared. Shostakovich, declared an Enemy of the People, feared for his life.

After watching Mariss Jansons conduct Lady Macbeth with Eva-Maria Westbroek in the title role in this 2006 Amsterdam staging, the surprise is not that Lady Macbeth upset Stalin, who slaughtered millions on a whim but was a prude on matters sexual. The surprise is that Shostakovich wasn't marched out and executed on the spot -- which I don't doubt would have happened had Stalin witnessed this particular production.

I've seen my two-Blu-ray set from start to finish three times, and I can hardly take in the daring performance Westbroek delivers. I believe there are times she forgets where she is, forgets who she is, so complete is her commitment to the role, so white-hot is her involvement in realizing the multilayered character of Shostakovich's Katerina Ismailova.

Katerina is a bored, rich housewife stuck in a provincial backwater. Her impotent husband has not been able to consummate their marriage, and while he is away on business, she takes as her lover a wandering rake named Sergey who has just begun working in the family factory, then murders the abusive father-in-law who catches her with Sergey. When her husband returns, she and Sergey murder him, then try to flee with the family's fortune before they are arrested and sent to Siberia.

Somehow, Westbroek overcomes our revulsion at Katerina's crimes and, without absolving her of guilt, evokes pathos for her suffering, her isolation, her own betrayal by Sergey with another female prisoner. Katerina wants Life. She wants to be kissed hard, to taste blood, to know what is it to feel truly alive. Actualizing Katerina on stage as this true-to-life woman is no small achievement. Westbroek does it.

Describing the virtues of this overwhelming production could grow to Dostoyevskyian proportions.

The whole supporting cast deserves praise, including Alexandre Kravets, who enacts Shostakovich's version of the drunken porter who gets up in the night to relieve himself in Shakespeare's Macbeth. The Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra plays as only this world-class orchestra can play. On the podium, Mariss Jansons is so absorbed that the sweat is dripping off his chin within 15 minutes. The camera work, directed by Thomas Grimm, is dazzlingly right.

That camera work is notably effective when Katerina and her Seryzha first make love, as runaway music throbs from the orchestra and pulsating strobe lights heighten the entire episode, right down to its descending trombone glissando denouement.

Which brings up a major caution. On the back cover is printed a warning: ""This production contains stroboscopic light effects, nudity and scenes of a sexual nature."" To which might have been added: graphic violence and bloodshed. If such elements offend you, avoid this.

Shostakovich's orchestration is modern but accessible. Some people shy away from Russian opera because they say the language doesn't sound musical, but Westbroek does indeed sing. Beautifully. She shreds the heartstrings. Listen to her moan, ""Seryzha, Seryzha,"" toward the final moments of the opera, and you'll understand as you never could otherwise the mournful motif that rises in the fourth movement of Shostakovich's String Quartet No. 8, composed 24 years after Lady Macbeth was crushed.

The strongest recommendation for this Lady Macbeth perhaps comes, by accident rather than design, from Westbroek herself. At the end, when the curtain rises to reveal her standing alone to receive the ovation she is due, she puts her hands on her head with a look of astonishment on her face, as though she herself cannot believe what she has done. She has laid it on the line, body and soul, heart and voice, given every ounce of her being to this performance. She barely holds back the tears.

It's a feat Westbroek might not be able ever to duplicate. She doesn't have to. Thanks to Opus Arte's stunning Blu-ray, the whole world can hear it and see it.",1446336000,2,5210,5.451612903225806

8151045,5,B000JJRACI,"There was a time when this opera was regarded as erotically graphic in a ""crossing the line"" sort of way.
And it is that, truly--but times have changed, and nowadays it is just another fascinating tale of thwarted
love, as almost all non-comic operas are. This filming of a stage production in the Netherlands is superb
in every way--very well sung (especially by the lead soprano, Westbroek) and played and an excellent record
of a brilliant staging. Basically, all you see is a unit set of a great big open box, but the director, Martin
Kusej, uses it imginatively. For instance, the start of Katarina and Sergei's wedding party shows all the guests
at a vast table, frozen in somewhat glamorous poses. Suddenly, they all go into real time, and the picture of
an elegant party instantly falls apart in rustic roughness--people crashing off their chairs, stuff breaking,
etc. And the irruption into the scene of the police is a real stunner. Some reviewers have chided Ventris for
losing the hunk attitude he displayed on his earlier DVD performance, but he knows how the role should go. I
found him a wonderful match for the soprano. What was especially interesting to me was the portrayal of Sonetka,
the girl he takes up with at the end, as somewhat less than seductive. Normally she's a young cutie, but here
she was more like the rest of the women prisoners. It suggested that Sergei isn't attracted to her as much as
he is attracted to the notion of being seen as a tomcat. I leave it to each individual viewer to decide whether
Kusej found a solution to the problematic ending, which, like the one to Wagner's Gotterdammerung, really needs
a river if it is to play properly.",1339545600,4,1682,4.6858108108108105
8151046,5,B000JJRACI,"Shostakovich opera Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, was disliked by  Stalin. He had seen it is December 1935. To receive Stalin's displeasure meant that you would be shot. The composer was lucky he was not. I know in jest, some singers actually do think, that a composer should be shot for inflicting some difficult part upon them, but this nearly happened to this great man. He fought back in his so called war symphonies,5-9. There is a DVD on this subject, called Shostakovich against Stalin The war Symphonies.

Mariss Jansons vigorously conducts the Royal Concertgebown orchestra. He is a Shostakovich specialist. The Staging by Martin Kusej,may not appeal to traditionalists. I then suggest you obtain the version conducted by James Conlon with the rough hawn voice of Jeanne Charbonnet. I can recommend this version, as I have it. In this modern staged version, Katerina is well portrayed by Eva-Maria Westbroek,who is also Sieglinde on the Blu ray version of Wagners Die Walkure, conducted  by Simon Rattle. She is able to to sing this role, as any aspiring Brunnhilde should be able to do. Sergey is sung by Chris Ventris and Boris is Vladimir Vaneev. All the parts are well sung. For those lovers of modern staging this is a must for your collection.",1309392000,3,1252,4.89622641509434
8151047,5,B000JJRACI,"One has to admire the courage of Shostakovich ( or wonder at his folly ) for creating such a damning indictment of Stalin's police state just as the purges were reaching their climax. This lends a historical dimension to what is without doubt one of the richest operas in the literary and musical domains in the entire repertoire, modern or ancient. Other reviewers have done justice to the plot and the large cast of ( mostly ) sleazy characters around whom it is built to display the greed, envy and lust that pervade the core of the human spirit. It is a bleak commentary on humanity, as deserved in our day as in the time of the Great Dictator, and no one emerges with their reputation untarnished ( that is, if they are still alive at the end ), yet the impact upon the receptive listener and viewer is of exhiliration rather than despair. This excitement is largely the product of the magnificent orchestral work performed by Jansons and the Concertgebouw, backed up by the powerful chorus and the fine camera work that captures these extended moments in all their ugly majesty. Think of Francis Bacon's geatest canvasses and you will understand where I am coming from. Director Martin Kusej has cleverly updated the decor to our own times, and set the action in a series of spare cubes and rectangles that pare down the action to its essentials, and except for the dying moments, lends piercing clarity to the compex and busy activity on stage. This comment leads, in fact, to the finale itself, for Kusej has been accused of changing the ending. I do not see it that way. Katrina's preceding soliloquy expresses her wish for death by drowning, and nothing that follows rules out the fulfillment of that wish. Nor does the libretto. It seems that Kusej is trying to convey the image of rising water as the stage clears to reveal the dead, so that the drowning is suggested surrealistically as it has to be, given the fact that the constraints of this set allow no room for the river that one can imagine borders their temporary stopping place. It is how Salvador Dali might have done it if he had landed the job of building the sets.

Back to the music. I consider this the finest orchestral writing that the composer ever produced, his major symphonies notwithstanding. No one who is timid about modern opera need be terrified by anything in this work. They will not find much to hum about, but the intense congruity of words with music pushes the plot forward and exposes the characters down to their very skeletons. Nothing so revealing is to be found in the superficially more entertaining pre- 20th Century operas, although late Wagner and Verdi come close. Its model is Berg's Wozzeck, that other towering musical drama of our time (no, I am not forgetting Peter Grimes, number 3 on my list ). The singing and acting are hardly distinguishable and could not have been better overall. Ventris' sexy performance has elicited some harsh words, but for me he gives a convincing interpretation of the role: after all, he is not singing Parsifal here as he has done with great distinction elsewhere. Westerbroek, as all seem to agree, dominates the cast. She compellingly projects the unsavoury appetites of the heroine, as well as the remorse that they bring. Visually and vocally she has an Olympian quality that doubtless accounts for her success in Wagnerian roles. Five cheers and five stars for a remarkable DVD, that stimulates, satisfies, and provokes in equal measures.",1303689600,7,3485,4.760330578512397
