7937915,1,B00005BSM8,"Don't buy any of these proto motion comics. I purchased a few of these & only the two Daredevil one's & Wolverine Origins worked. This one & the Hulk versus Wolverine, & along with the Avengers; none of them worked on my DVD player or laptop. When they did work they either froze or began skipping. Naturally, I returned the bunch back. Again, don't waste your time or money on these.",1359244800,,384,4.422535211267606
7937916,5,B00005BSM8,"I can tell you I was quite skeptical when I saw this....but I was wrong!  Each one of these comic discs has a dramtic reading in the style of a small film with comic panels. I was surprised at how good the acting was and would tell any fan of comics to grab these while they last. I don't understand why more comics fans didn't buy these? They are quite good and I don't see why Marvel wouldn't want to make more of them.

As a fan of the Hulk I have to say the producers did do a good job of translating this into the format.",1101772800,6,526,3.9065420560747666
7937917,5,B00005BSM8,"I stopped reading comics in the mid 90's. The influx of Superhero Movies (Spiderman, X-Men, Blade & Hulk) totally got me back into the Marvel world. I purchased all the DVDS that Sock Puppet studio produced and I loved them. For basically the same price as a Graphic Novel you get a DVD with over 2 hours of material. I think the format might not be for everbody but for somebody who has been away from Comics this should pull you back quickly. I have been waiting for them to release other titles soon.",1089158400,4,503,4.361702127659575
