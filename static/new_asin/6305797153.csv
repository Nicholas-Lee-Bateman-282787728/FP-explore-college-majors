Strange things begin to happen as the woman's son begins to behave strangely. I don't want to go deeper into the story because it will ruin the movie.

1076755,4,6305797153,"This movie has some good moments although I won't say it's a masterpiece.

Probably the favorite character for me is the son.

The dead husband's ghost takes possession of the youth which causes him to start having un-natural feelings towards his mother.  He steels some of her clothes for example when she's in the shower.

Finally she wakes up and the boy is on top of her.  I guess you can read between the lines there.  I'm waiting for the day when I watch some weird movie and they take this idea to another level.  Probably nobody would ever go that far.

The boy develops powerful psycho kinetic abilities as a result of being possessed.  He can cause a plane to crash simply by pushing a swing.

I like the son he's a good actor.

Other than that though this is a more or less typical Italian horror movie.  Doors slamming, pianos playing, etc..

The new husband is giving the wife some type of drug.  I don't know if he's really supposed to be the bad guy or what.  I guess that's the idea of this movie you are never quite sure of who's the bad guy or what really happened.

Actually one interpretation is everyone in the entire movie is bad.

I would say the story is a little weak.

Still it's worth watching I would say.

1076756,5,6305797153,"The only other Bava films I've seen are Bay of Blood and Black Sabbath, but Shock is my favorite.  It seems to usually get lukewarm reviews from critics and horror movie fans for some reason.  I remember seeing it on TV under the title Beyond The Door 2 and it freaked me out when I was younger.  Some of the dialog is laughable, but maybe that's due to the dubbing and translation.  It might sound much better in the original Italian. There's not a whole lot of gore, but enough surprises and weird imagery to keep one interested.

The dvd by anchor bay is very nice.  It's great to see this movie in widescreen.  (Italian horror films used to get such horrible pan and scan treatment on vhs back in the day.)  It was also very cool to see the original Italian trailer and American TV spots.

1076758,2,6305797153,"Compared to Argento, I must say that Mario Bava is for me entirely overrated. He might be a pioneer, but as a stylist he is sadly lacking. His seventies work is more often than not tiresome and tawdry, even if you like horror films.

Argento fans seeking out 'Shock' on the strength of Daria Nicolodi's starring role, music by two members of Goblin (under the nom-de-plume 'A.Libra)and Srgento's supposed giallio-based debt to Bava should buy 'Shock' with caution. Although it is an authentic slice of Eurohorror and better than the contemporary garbage horror Hollywood churns out, it is still a fairly dreary, dull, repetitive flick with few high points and many annoyances.

Finally, the sound and picture quality are fairly poor even when compared to some of Jess Franco's rubbish (and that's saying something) - my DVD of the silly 'She Killed In Ecstasy', filmed years before this looks and sounds far far better. Shame Daria never made films without Argento that are better than this...",1097366400,3,993,4.975903614457831

1076760,2,6305797153,"Shock (Mario Bava, 1977)

While Mario Bava put his name to Shock (known to American audiences as behind the Door II)-- the last film Bava was involved with before his death in 1980-- that probably wasn't a good move. Bava, whose career reached such heights as I, Vampiri (1956) and Bay of Blood (1971), never sank so low as this. Not even Danger: Diabolik! (1968) is this bad.

Much of the blame rests on Mario Bava's son Lamberto, who in an interview included with the DVD says (admits to?) having directed over half the film himself. Anyone who's seen any of Lamberto's solo outings (Demons 2, Demons 3, Black Sabbath,
Midnight Killer, etc. ad nauseam*) already knew that about five minutes into this dog. It's all the more disturbing given a high-powered, albeit small, cast and a script that might have actually worked in the hands of a director who understands how to build suspense. Mario, for example.

The story (which isn't a sequel to the original Beyond the Door, incidentally; the only thing the two have in common is David Colin, who plays a different role in each movie) centers around a family who move into a new house. Well, not really a new house. The mother, Dora (Daria Nicolodi, a Dario Argento staple), lived here before with her first husband, who committed suicide years before. Her new husband (John Steiner, who also worked with Argento in the 1982 film Tenebre)is an angel compared to the first guy, or so everyone seems to think. Dora's child from marriage #1, Marco (David Colin, who never acted in another film after this), is also along for the ride. By the family's first night in the house, Marco is starting to fall under the influence of something rather nasty.

Yes, you've seen a bunch of possessed-kid flicks before, but there's enough here to have made this one compelling (Bava has a take on the Oedipus complex that's just plain nasty-- some of the few scenes that actually make this worth watching) had it been done correctly. However, any subtlety reflected in the original script is woefully absent here; foreshadowing is writ large enough for even the densest viewer to be able to spot any good jumps from a mile off, and the ending can be seen coming long before you actually get there. Not a good thing in a supposed mystery.

Painfully, both Steiner and Nicolodi turn in good performances, and the soundtrack, originally credited to Libra (who have since been unmasked as Italian pop stalwarts Goblin), is as much a joy as is all of Goblin's other early work. However, Shock provides hard and painful evidence at how much less than the sum of its parts a whole can be. * 1/2
(* Yes, Lamberto is credited with the original Demons. One wonders whether Dario Argento was just the writer on that one.)",1010966400,5,2745,4.686721991701245
1076761,4,6305797153,"Last film of the italian king of B-movies - Mario Bava - , SHOCK is now presented by Anchor Bay in an above-average DVD version. Trailers, italian, english and french dubbed versions and incomplete filmographies are offered as bonus features as well as a short interview with Lamberto Bava, the son of the late Maestro.
I didn't see SHOCK when it was theatrically released nor in the VHS-NTSC standards so I cannot make comparisons regarding the quality of images. In my opinion, the copy is superb without a single white or black spot and I had a tremendous pleasure to watch for the first time this movie which belongs to the psycho-horror thriller genre.
Due to production restrictions, at least I presume so, most of the action takes place in a cozy italian mansion near the sea. A couple played by John Steiner and Daria Nicolodi - Dario Argento's compaign - has just moved in with Daria Nicolodi's child. The father of the child has died seven years ago and, since then,  Daria has spent a lot of time recovering from a severe depression.
As in BAY OF BLOOD, the child has an important role in the movie. One of the characteristics of Mario Bava's cinema is to always leave to the audience the possibility to find a rational explanation for the most bizarre events. In SHOCK, one could perfectly imagine that the story is told from the sole point of view of Daria Nicolodi who is lead to psychosis by her guiltiness.
Anyway, SHOCK is an example of a smart B-movie with good scary effects done without the help of computers. Mario Bava was a real movie lover perpetuating the example of Georges Mlis, the french movie director who invented some of the first special effects of Movie History. In 1905.

It's a fun little possession  movie and features several very creepy moments...the standout being the  shot where the possessed little boy runs up to his Mom (Daria Nicolodi) and  suddenly turns into the ghost of her dead husband...all done without  effects or cgi.  All in all, the film doesn't really break any new ground,  but it's a worthy last film from the original italian horror maestro.

It is a good film in a sense that it is ""original"" in its plot for its time; however, the film is slow at times and not shocking as the title would suggest.  The music is what creates the spooky/tense atmosphere in the film...if it was not for the soundtrack, I would have given it 3 stars.

The film is about a young married couple Dora and Bruno, who have a 7 year old son Marco.  The family lives in a modern, spacious suburban home, in what looks like northern Italy.  On the surface they seem like a normal-happy family, but soon strange things began happening with their son Marco, who seems not only to be possessed but is also trying to kill his own mother...

1076886,3,6305797153,"Mario Bava's final film is more or less a sequel to a movie called Beyond the Door (1974), but the two movies have very little to do with one another, save for some thematic similarities. In Shock, the beautiful, wispy blonde Dora Baldini (Daria Nicolodi) moves back into her old house with her new husband Bruno (John Steiner), an airline pilot, and her creepy son Marco (David Colin Jr.). Apparently Dora's former husband died in this house, and strange things begin to happen to bring it all back. Not least of all, Marco begins seeing an ""invisible friend,"" and behaving strangely, even attempting to kill his mom and step-dad. While the film has only scant evidence of Bava's masterly directorial touches or his trademark use of color, it's actually an effective, scary horror movie in its own right.

1076890,3,6305797153,"Italian horror cinema, especially it's more exploitative stylings such as giallo, is so hit-and-miss.  Some directors are great, others are terrible, even when they're contemporaries.  Within oeuvres, some director's movies are quite effective, others are nearly useless (I'm glaring at you, Dario Argento).  And, in some cases, even a single movie has its amazing parts and its terrible parts--yes, like Shock, Maestro Mario Bava's final directorial effort.

The concept itself is very good.  A mix of Shining and Amityville Horror style haunted house narrative, a woman and her family move into the house of her youth, only to be beset by spectres.  Dora, the mother, is first beset by apprehension, then anxiety, then horror, and finally insanity as the house slowly destroys her mind.  Young Marco, her child, almost immediately gets possessed -- by what is not so clear, but that's actually a good way to go about it.  Bruno, Dora's second husband and Marco's step-father is ostensibly the voice of reason, but first his absence's sink the security of Dora's psyche, and then his sordid past comes back to destroy all vestiges of hope for the family.  If you're looking for skeletons in the closet, that's basically the best way to describe this movie.

However, it's execution is spotty at best.  There's the aforementioned possessions, ghostly happenings, psychoses; there's also voodoo, token objects, endless dream sequences, and a trippy montage in the middle of the movie that comes out of absolutely nowhere.  There are some sequences that are superbly executed (one shot near the end of the movie involving a hallway and Bruno suddenly changing into someone else has to be one of the most terrifying moments in cinema I've ever witnessed), and then there are others that do more than drag down the narrative (Dora slowly going hysterical while Bruno just sits there watching goes on too long while little reaction from Bruno makes it entirely unbelievable).  In classic Italian cinema means, the imagery is mostly beautiful but their penchant for dubbed post-production sound is very disconcerting, making the movie a little harder to get into.

I'd really only recommend this one to fans of Bava, the other Italian giallo filmmakers, and those who really do love really flamboyant horror movies of all sub-types.  It's a shame, too, because some sequences are deserving of recognition for their skill and execution, but the whole does not support the parts, and vice versa.

1076891,3,6305797153,"Shock is the very last feature film made by the legendary Mario Bava and honestly this is one of the most frustrating movies I have ever seen. There was so much potential for a truly great and scary movie, but somewhere along the lines it just doesn't seem to fully work. There isn't anything in particular that is bad about Shock, but it just never reaches the level of greatness it was so close to.

The screenplay was written by Francesco Barbieri, Lamberto Bava & Paolo Brigenti & Dardano Sacchetti and honestly this is one of their better written movies. And again that is why it's so frustrating with the outcome. I love Italian horror films; in the 70s and 80s American and Italian horror were the leaders. While other nations were also producing quality work American and Italian horror were the more popular.

The thing is though with Italian horror is a lot of times things happen and they really don't make a lot of sense. Sometimes the things the characters say is kind of idiotic though sometimes it can be the dubbing. But Shock was actually mostly coherent and the characters don't really say the stupid things they normally do with a couple of exceptions. Shock was an interesting character study. But the problem is while not badly written there were moments it just wasn't all that interesting. Certain aspects of the film could have been explained better but overall Shock wasn't badly written at all; just at times not all that interesting at times.

Mario Bava was one of the best Italian filmmakers and one of the biggest influences on not just Italian horror, but American horror. Actually, his influence is more than just horror. He's inspired filmmakers of many different genres. But here with Shock the tension and suspense just slightly lack at times. By no means was Shock poorly made or anything there was just something missing. The pacing can be a bit off at times and personally I just never really felt the suspense and tension that I have felt in other movies by Mario Bava.

Mario Bava was a filmmaker who knew how to create suspense and tension that is why he is so loved. Story-telling wise his movies did lack, but as I have said many times, while yes that is important there is more to filmmaking than just story-telling. Bava, made movies that were high on suspense and tension and can be downright creepy; but here with Shock those elements were slightly off. Bava also was a filmmaker who was very visual and knew how to use colors much like the filmmaker he inspired Dario Argento. I think a movie like Shock could have used that touch. Quite honestly, when Bava used showed off his great visual style that is when Shock works best.

When it comes to children in horror movies I think I can count on one hand how many didn't annoy me. Even when I was a child, kids in horror often got on my nerves. One of the only exceptions was Danielle Harris; besides her in general kids get on my nerves in horror. And Italian horror they seem to annoy me even more since they are always so poorly dubbed. David Collin Jr. as Marco really, really grated on my nerves. While some of it was the actor it was for sure more of the dubbing.

The main saving grace was Daria Nicolodi who was excellent here. Daria should be very well known to horror fans for her work with her one time partner Dario Argento, she also happens to be Asia Argento's mother. Daria was excellent here and quite honestly was the main saving grace. It's her who really kept me interested.

Overall Shock has some solid moments with some suspense, but overall it mostly lacks in my opinion. The shame of it all is Shock had potential to be a truly frightening movie. All the elements were there, but it just never fully works. Despite the flaws I'm still giving it 3-stars. Mainly due to the potential and due to some creepy moments; while Shock doesn't come highly recommended for fans of Bava or ghost flicks you might get a little something out of it.",1204848000,,3955,4.554149085794656
1076892,3,6305797153,"This film came late in Mario Bava's career (actually his last film, I think?) and suffers slightly from the move into modern territory, leaving it resembling too many other films around it at the time. But generally it's a pretty solid thriller with some very good moments. Daria Nicolodi plays Dora, a woman recovering from a breakdown. She has a young son and a new partner, and together they move into the house that Dora used to live in when her first husband was still alive...not a good start eh?  As you might expect things don't go well for the trio...Dora has nightmares and hallucinations, her son acts strangely, and her new husband Bruno always seems to be away working when she needs him most.

What we have here is quite a typical ""is she going mad or is it all real?"" scenario, which has been handled many times before. Bava, however handles the material quite deftly. He picks out lots of small oddities such as the bizarre ceramic hand sculpture that Dora pores over, some booby-trapped piano keys (ouch!), the weirdness of the young son playing around, and when seen from Dora's viewpoint, you can quite easily believe that she's being haunted by something very unnatural...or is she?

Well I'm not telling, and hopefully you can watch this film without being aware of the plot explanation, because it deserves to be experienced fresh. Bava directs the action with some skill, and the acting is pretty good, with Daria Nicolodi making a convincing traumatized victim. Sadly the English language dubbing weakens the impact of many scenes, but the visuals are good and Dora's dream sequences are all quite creepy. Plus the film boasts one really, REALLY good jump-scare, which I'm sure you will remember, as it's a very clever one. It also has quite a bloody finale, to keep gore fans happy.

The Anchor Bay DVD is a good copy to buy, it's uncut, restoring some sequences that were trimmed from earlier VHS releases, especially those involving the young son's behaviour (I think you'll be able to spot the ones I mean!), and nicely presented too.

7895151,5,6305797153,"The principal writer of Shock is Mario Bava's son Lamberto, so expect a bit of Blade In The Dark and Ghost Son in the mix of this Italian haunted house murder mystery. In many ways however Shock is very much a Mario film, and it stars Dario Nicolodi, surely one of the most popular and successful scream queens of 20th Century Euro cinema. John Steiner(Tenebrae) and Ivan Rassimov(Your Vice Is A Locked Room) provide male support and this one should have been a classic but because it is a slow burner it is sometimes overlooked. The final third is an absolute treat for lovers of horror ingredients such as bloodletting and female vulnerability, and is a showcase for Lamberto's writing and Mario's Directing. A modern Rome location and a murder mystery, but not a Giallo. If you've only seen it on 4/3 vhs, the Blue Underground dvd exposes the sides and the bottom of the movie to be something worth seeing so give it a second look now. Bloodshed is realistic but not continuous.",1479254400,,981,4.64367816091954

7895154,3,6305797153,"Gotta say, this starts out as probably the worst Bava film I've seen. The score is irritating, the characters are unlikable, you name it. Then in the third act, it's as though his morning cup of coffee finally kicked in. The pace kicks into high gear with some fantastic moments. No one with half a brain will be surprised by the ending though. My recommendation is that if you decide to watch it, stick with it until the end for any kind of payoff.",1477008000,,449,4.357142857142857
