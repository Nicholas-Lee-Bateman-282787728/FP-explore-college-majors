8145692,1,B000IJ7AHE,"The Marengo Films edition of The Kennel Murder Case has fairly good picture quality throughout most of the movie. Unfortunately, most of the scenes are ruined by a pronounced background hiss on the audio track. Whenever this noise cuts in, it takes the viewer right out of the story.

The other movie on this disc, British Intelligence, has a somewhat softer visual image. However, its audio track is relatively clear.",1313107200,4,418,4.9714285714285715
8145693,4,B000IJ7AHE,"William Powell has always been a favorite of mine.  Likewise, he was in this mystery.  it was entertaining and I will watch it again.",1238112000,,133,4.5
8145694,5,B000IJ7AHE,"I picked this up because I wanted to get a DVD that had Kennel Murder Case with a transfer as good as The Roan Group. Marengo Films hit the home run for me here.
The transfer of Kennel Murder Case is just as good as the Roan Group. Not only that, but British Intelligence IMHO is a much better co feature than the Nancy Drew movie on the Roan DVD.
I have written some reviews on Kennel Murder already where the great William Powell is Philo Vance looking to solve the murder of Archer Coe - this had a lot of twists and turns. Eugene Pallette co-stars (he and Powell were in My Man Godfrey)& Mary Astor is in it as well. A very well done who-done-it.
British Intelligence stars Boris Karloff as a butler - but in reality he is a spy - the question is for who - the British or the Germans, all sorts of plot twists and a satisfying explosive ending. Not great,but a good little spy thriller. It is a worthy co-feature for Kennel Murder.
My assessment then is to avoid Kennel Murder from Alpha, avoid British Intelligence from Alpha (transfers are bad) get the Roan DVD if you think you can bear watching Nancy Drew, or get the Marengo DVD if youd rather have British Intelligence.
Hey, if you are going to package a DVD with a co-feature, you might as well find a good co-feature to go with the movie you want.
I am happy with Marengo DVD in terms of the quality of the transfer of Kennel Murder and a satisfying co-feature.",1234483200,4,1423,4.274074074074074
8145695,5,B000IJ7AHE,"I agree with the other reviewers comments on the superb quality of the transfer - video image.  (This applies to the Marengo DVD release).  Obviously from a 35mm print source material with fine grain.  I was pleasantly surprised that the Marengo release is right on par or exceeds the image quality of the previous Roan release, and at 25% or less of the cost.  Definetly a good value.  The plot and presentation is definitely the best of the 4 William Powell outings as Philo Vance.",1193356800,5,483,4.635294117647059
8145696,4,B000IJ7AHE,"I have seen this movie on two other occasions, once on DVD and the other time on television.  Both were dark and grainy.  This is a very good print, it's clear and the audio is very good.  It was a pleasure to be able to watch and finally see detail.  Great restoration job for a 1933 movie!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kennel-Murder-Case-British-Intelligence/dp/B000IJ7AHE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kennel Murder Case/British Intelligence</a>",1192492800,5,485,6.650793650793651
8145697,5,B000IJ7AHE,"I owned another print of Kennel Murder Case but acquired this on Marengo's assurance that it was a superior transfer. Indeed, it is: very few blown highlights and very easy viewing. If you like Powell's thin man, then you should enjoy this, his third and last outing as Philo Vance. The companion piece (British Intelligence) would be perhaps more aptly entitled Lack of British Intelligence, but the Kennel Murder Case is more than worth the price.",1185408000,12,449,4.921052631578948
8145698,5,B000IJ7AHE,"In fact, quite the opposite. Bravo to MARENGO for a stunning transfer of THE KENNEL MURDER CASE, the best of the William Powell / Philo Vance murder mysteries. It is the equal of the ROAN GROUP version in sharpness but superior in the audio track. MARENGO has done a marvelous job of remastering, and the crisp, clear soundtrack will blow you away. Highly recommended indeed!",1172534400,21,375,4.7846153846153845
8145699,5,B000IJ7AHE,Marengo Films is proud to announce the issue of these two fine films. Our company put both masters through a complete sound design and color correcton. We guarantee these are the finest prints of these movies on the market.,1165881600,11,223,4.743589743589744
