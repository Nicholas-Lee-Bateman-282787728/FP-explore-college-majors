8373977,1,B002MPQIHK,"This is an overpriced piece of garbage. I once caught a historical documentary about this extraordinary creator of Central Park.  That is what I was looking for, a detailed examination of what it took to create Central Park and his legacy of public park engineering.  I was NOT looking for some cheesy actors playing at this pathetic movie.  This is like one of those ""made for TV"" after school specials for teenagers.  HUGE waste of for adults who love history.",1362182400,2,462,4.7375
