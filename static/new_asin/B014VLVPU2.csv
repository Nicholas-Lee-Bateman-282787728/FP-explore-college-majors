7424922,5,B014VLVPU2,"I went to see the HD simulcast in March, 2015 at my local theater.  The singing in this opera is wonderful.  I'm a hugh fan of Joyce DiDonato and Juan Diego Florez.  I haunted the Met Store until finally this DVD was released.  The opera is long but a Rossini opera has magnificent music.  For me the time flew as I sat there in awe.  The staging is rather stark but Scotland was stark at that time and I was there for the music.",1452643200,10,429,4.0476190476190474
7424923,5,B014VLVPU2,"La Donna del Lago is one of the operas that Rossini composed for the Teatro San Carlo in Naples.  It was the first of many operas to be inspired by the works of Sir Walter Scott and is based on his epic poem The Lady of the Lake. After a less than successful premiere it proved to be one of the composer's most popular pieces.  It featured not only Rossini's  future wife Isabella Colbran in the title role but also the two tenors Giovanni David and Andrea Nozzari who were the the other star attractions of the Neapolitan company.  Added into the mix was contralto Benedetta Pisaroni resulting in an opera that was specifically composed for four of the greatest exponents of the art of Bel Canto at that point in time.  That the MET was able to replicate such a situation is certainly a feather in its cap.

I saw this production in the house and was so enthralled that I opted to catch the movie theater presentation a couple of weeks later.  I have been anxiously awaiting its release ever since.  Needless to say I was not disappointed.  Isabella Colbran had a unique voice.  As such she could be classified as either a soprano or mezzo soprano.  Consequently both sopranos and mezzos have attempted the parts written for her.  Very often mezzos don't have the type of voice that blossoms above the staff. Conversely sopranos are often not able to adequately encompass the lower reaches of the roles.  With Joyce Di Donato neither is an issue as she not only has the ability to declaim the lower aspects of the part, but the voice healthily soars in the upper reaches of the the role as well.

With Juan Diego Florez in the cast one is assured of vocal excellence.  This is especially evident in the nocturne like aria that opens the second act. That the sometimes inconsistent John Osborne is able to match him note for note is one of the glories of the production.  This is certainly notable in the concluding section of the trio in the second act which can be described as Rossini's version of dueling banjos scored for two tenors with the tenors literally dueling as the titular lady looks on.  In the trouser role of the heroine's true love Daniella Barcelona not only sings well, but manages to act the part to perfection.  The remainder of the cast more than adequately meets their demands.

Fortunately the production is traditional with scenery and costumes depicting the Scotland of the Sir Walter Scott poem.  Disappointments in the staging are few, with those mainly being the lack of Elena rowing herself across Loch Katrine in the opening scene and the somewhat incongruity of the bright red flooring when it initially appears in the final scene.  The chorus is  excellent, and the  orchestra, and most importantly in this opera, the stage band play well and on cue for conductor Michele Mariotti.  This is especially true regarding the somewhat contrapuntal ensemble that concludes the first act where soloists, two choruses, stage band, and orchestra bring the act to a rousing conclusion.  Incidentally Maestro Mariotti hails form Pesaro, the birthplace of Rossini.  As such he was literally surrounded with music of the town's most  famous citizen from an early age.

Picture and sound are totally up to today's standards as viewed in the BluRay version.

This is necessary for anyone interested not only in Rossini and Bel Canto but simply great singing.  Highly recommended!",1449100800,23,3398,4.758974358974359
7424924,5,B014VLVPU2,"In a published review of Joyce DiDonato's performance of this opera in London at the ROH, the music critic said that when she sang, sunshine poured from her mouth. While I am an unabashed fan of Mme DiDonato, I thought that the comment was a bit hyperbolic, but not having seen the ROH performance then under review, I could not validate (or invalidate) the opinion. Having now seen this Met performance, I understand the aptness of the metaphor.

La Donna Del Lago had its first staging in Naples in 1819. Rossini's then ""squeeze"", later to be his first wife,  the legendary Isabella Colbran played Elena, with the equally as legendary tenor, Giovanni David as James. It was not well received, and is thought of better today than it has been for many decades. In my opinion it is is one of Rossini's most lyric and melodic works, yet possessed of all of the vocal pyrotechnics one expects of Rossini.

This performance is superbly sung; not one performer turns in a less than stellar performance. Our era is blest with many exceptional singers, who can act as well as sing, both executed with gratifying excellence.  In addition to Joyce DiDonato, whose interpretation defines the role in modern times, we enjoy Juan Diego Florez in the role of James V, John Osborne as Rodrigo and Daniella Barcelona in the en travesti part of Malcolm, true beloved of Elena.

My first hearing of Florez was in his first CD, ""The Rossini Tenor"" several years ago. Recall, gentle reader, that the real Rossini Renaissance is of recent vintage, with the majority of the Maestro's works, especially the opera seria, enjoying near total oblivion for about 150 years. Thus hearing a tenor sing the then unperformed music of Rossini was a new experience for me. And it was an eye opening (perhaps better stated as ""ear opening"") experience at that! Comparing the tenor aria ""O Fammia Soave"" from that early CD to the rendition from the DVD shows a voice that has matured without losing any of the flexibility required by Rossini's music.

John Osborne does a splendid job in the tenor role of Rodrigo. Talk about dueling tenors! Wide ranging coloratura from the low register to several well placed high Ds seem easy for him and his ""high testosterone"" characterization of the part is also near perfect. Daniella Barcellona who specializes in Rossini turns in a performance that is of the highest quality.

Michele Mariotti conducts with an authority that belies his youth. He got his start at the Rossini Opera Festival, held annually in August in Pesaro, Rossini's birthplace. I have found his work to be uniformly excellent, and he does not disappoint here. The Met orchestra and chorus execute as one would expect of the world's foremost opera orchestra and chorus.

Erato's disc is a technical wonder: picture is perfect and without glitch. Sound in the Dolby 5.1 mode is rich, detailed and full.

This should be in the music library of every opera fan, particularly folks who relish great singing of the bel canto repertory.

Finallly, this is NOT a Region 2 disc as Amazon notes on its product page, but, rather, a ""Region 0"" disc, thus playable on Blu ray (but not generic DVD) players worldwide.",1448323200,13,3182,4.811355311355311

7424926,5,B014VLVPU2,"Absolutely wonderful! Incredible singing not only from Florez and DiDonato, as expected, but also from Osborn and Barcellona. The finale is an extraordiary example of what ""bel canto"" singing is all about",1461024000,,204,5.40625

7424928,5,B014VLVPU2,"When I saw this opera in the theater as a one of the productions Met Life HD Broadcast series I was very impressed with the performance. I don't have another reference as this was the first time I saw this opera and I enjoyed it very much.
The cast is outstanding; it is probably one of the best singing Rossinis operas, even the smallest characters were very good.
The music is beautiful. I enjoyed the duets between Elena ,la donna del lago and  GiacomoV(Uberto) played by Joyce DiDonato and Juan Diego Flores respectively as well as the trio with these two characters and Rodrigo played by John Osborne. The singing chorus and different ensembles were amazing: the cast sees a meteor in the sky and then departing to war was very beautiful.
The scenery was simple, but very appropriate playing with costumes and light very well.
The quality of the dvd is perfect.",1460246400,3,866,4.660130718954249
7424929,4,B014VLVPU2,"This starts as what appears to be a traditional production, with traditional costuming and traditional casting. I understand that, traditionally, the role of Malcolm, has been portrayed, in travesti, by a female, preferably a large one and, in this case, Daniela Barcellona does physically qualify. Despite that fact, in my mind, it just doesnt work. It needs the balance of a male tenor, to properly offset the female soprano. When the love duets are sung and were listening to two soprano females, singing to each other, the balance is off.

 Also, one of the scenes makes no sense, to me. In Act 1, as the Clans prepare for war, a Clan group, all dressed in blue, with stark, blue body paint, appears, forms a circle, around Elena, kneels and is surrounded by the rest of the Clans. What is the purpose of all that blue and the outstretched arms, toward Elena, as though they were worshiping her?

 The other oddity is the stage setting. With very few adjustments, the whole opera takes place on a mound, which, at different moments, functions as a pile of dirt, a hill or a mountain top. A bit more scenery, rather than this minimalistic approach, would have served better.

 DiDonato, as usual, has a beautiful voice but she sings mechanically, with little or no emotional expression in her deliveries. Juan Flres, as James V/Uberto, is excellent. Daniela Barcellonas voice would have been better used in a female role.",1459900800,2,1424,4.815573770491803
7424930,1,B014VLVPU2,"When the applause started for the appearing conductor, I noted that the applause was coming only from the left surround. So I walked to the right surround and sure enough, no sound from here. I checked my loudspeaker (in case a cable had come lose) but it was fine. So no right surround on this blu-ray! Needless to say that you can't really get a decent sound stage with the right surround channel missing.

As the orchestra started to play, I noted the percussion instruments/cymbals came right out of the left surround. Switching to stereo, the cymbals are coming from the right. So it sounds like the content that was mend for the right surround ended up in the left surround.

To make things worse, in the more piano parts I noticed the background noise in the recording was unusually high. My sound pressure meter goes only down to a 60 db scale, so the reading is not very precise, but it looked like a noise level of about 53-54 db. Must be the highest background noise of any recording I have, very annoying.

7424931,5,B014VLVPU2,"In the opera scene today I don't think that one can experience anything greater than the pure joy of the Bel Canto of mezzo Joyce Di Donato. As she did in Maria Stuarda she again emphasizes that statement in this album. This is pure joy - singing as must have caressed the ears of Rossini when he conceived this beautiful masterpiece. Pure joy flowing flawless ""beautiful singing"" as it came from his pen to the best talents of the day. The plot is light, endearing and leaves no messy aftertaste. A royal is smitten by an innocent peasant girl who happens to be the daughter of the royal's arch enemy and is herself in love with a rebel to the royals throne. It all works out well as in this political drama there are only a few bodies left on stage,  not the many as occurs in Rossini's grand last opera William Tell. Lots of bodies there. Here we have ceaseless, flowing melody, easy harmonies and a happy resolution.
Ms Di Donato is only one of the bel canto stars of this display work for the genre. The royal in disguise is none other than the leading bel canto tenor Juan Diego Florez. That pure beautiful tenor echoing through the Scottish highlands makes a match with Elena made in heaven. Then add the acrobatic finesse of mezzo Daniela Barcellona as Elana's true love Malcolm another rebel and it's truly bel canto heaven. Bye the way, as noted in the records introduction,  in this opera the mezzo gets the mezzo - sorry about that Mr. tenor!
The other two stars of this drama are John Osborn as the rebel leader Rodrigo who is also betrothed to Elena and  Duglas her father also a rebel sung by Oren Gradus. Both add clear declamation and style to the proceedings.
A big cheer goes to the conductor Michele Mariotti. I have heard him conduct several times from Bologna, Pesero and other festivals and he truly has the Rossini touch. At this Met broadcast he certainly demonstrated it again. Bravo maestro and Bravi to the orchestra.
The story itself was fashioned by Rossini and his librettist Tottola at Naples San Carlo Opera from a French translation of the newly popular Waverly Tales by Sir Walter Scott. His octosylabic verse easily translated into French and then Italian. Soon after Rossini, dozens of opera based on Scott and other Romantic authors appeared. One of the most famous being Lucia di Lammermoor. For some twenty - thirty years after the premiere on Oct 24, 1819, La Donna del Lago was sung through Europe, Cuba and South America. It it was then forgotten along most all Rossini works except the Barber of Seville.
My first acquaintance with La Donna del Lago was in October 1981. A new critical edition had been prepared by a friend, Colin Slim and was presented, to great acclaim, at Housten Grand Opera. Frederica van Stadt as Elana, Marilyn Horn as Malcom and Rockwell Blake as the Royal. It was grand Grand Opera. This present recording is of its first presentation at the Metropolitan of New York.
In this production even suggestive realism has been discarded.  In this Lady of the lake the lake is gone and no row boats as called for in Rossini's score. All that's left are some irregular slopes (some Scott's heather) and a flickering T.V. images that wax and wane. Actually it all works out pretty well especially the final scene in the royal hall with all it's gold costumes. Beautiful opera beautifully done.
A final accolade for Ms Di Donato. As Sir Walter said of Elena:
And ne'er did Grecian chisel trace
A Nymph, a Naiad, or a Grace,
Of finer form, or lovelier face!",1459036800,4,3515,4.610223642172524
7424932,5,B014VLVPU2,There is no one singing today like Joyce! The entire cast is incredible. Problably the most florid bel canto singing I have ever heard.

8731968,5,B014VLVPU2,"I have recently been discovering Rossinis Opera Seria and La Donna del Lago is my favorite.

The key to enjoying Rossinis dramatic operas is to ignore the libretto.  When I first watched La Donna del Lago,  I watched with the English subtitles and I did not like the opera.  When I watched it again using the Italian subtitles, I loved it.

The story is stupid and the costumes and sets are drab.  The only reason to watch this DVD is for the music and the singing.

Joyce DiDonato is the best Rossini Mezzo Soprano of our time.  Juan Diego Florez is possibly the best Rossini tenor of all time.

The stereo soundtrack sounds better than most CDs  but if you have a high quality sound system, you will hear the air vent.  Most people probably will not notice it.

At this point of my life, I actually like Rossini more than Verdi or Puccini and certainly more than Bellini and Donizetti.

I highly recommend this DVD of Rossinis La Donna del Lago.",1516579200,,947,4.436046511627907
8731969,5,B014VLVPU2,"I enjoyed this MET production of La Donna Del Largo. The voices were great. The production and costumes were very good, but I found that the La Scala older productions had better set designs and staging. The La Scala production was with June Anderson, but the tenor sometimes seemed to shout. Florenz has a stronger voice in the MET production. Both are very good, slight different in interpretation. The quality of the the MET is superior in that it was recorded with more advanced technology.",1514764800,,494,4.823529411764706
8731970,3,B014VLVPU2,"As some others have noted, there is no right surround, making this Dolby Digital 4.1. Although this may seem a little far-fetched, one possible reason that not everyone is experiencing this issue is that they may be playing the 2-channel soundtrack, which seems to be the default, and many receivers operating in home-theater mode automatically simulate surround sound when fed a 2-channel signal. (Therein lies a workaround for those who are really bothered by the lack of a right-surround channel; your receiver will probably produce a more satisfactory surround sound than the alleged 5.1 Dolby Digital track.)

I can also verify the complaint others have had regarding the high level of background noise: it's as if some of the microphones were stuck in the air-conditioning vents. I find it rather astonishing that the engineering is so poor; and yet aside from feeling cheated for paying full price for a multi-way defective product, I concede that the level of background noise is tolerable; if you want to put the best possible face on it, it does kind of make one feel as if one is actually in the opera house, with all the extraneous noise one might encounter there; the acoustic does have a certain ""air"" about it. The same was the case in the PBS broadcast of this opera on its ""Great Performances from the Met"" series; so I assume that the engineering error was there from the beginning (I wonder how it sounded in the movie theaters.)

At the time of this writing, Amazon incorrectly lists the disc as being Playback Region B/2 and PAL. It is in fact Worldwide Playback (although it will not play correctly, if at all, in countries using the PAL system, as this disc is NTSC.)

Finally, putting technical matters aside, I'd say this disc is a must for opera lovers. First of all, this was a Rossini I didn't even know existed, as I am more accustomed to the lighter comic operas. The sophistication of the score came as a wonderful surprise; it harks back to Mozart (not surprising) but presages Verdi. As for vocal pyrotechnics, if you think La Cenerentola is something, wait until you hear this! Rarely is a cast so excellent across the board, although I suppose I am among only a handful of people in the world who don't like Florez's voice. Comparing the two tenors pining for Elena, Florez is dead-on accurate with his thin, piercing instrument, while Osborne uses his more full-bodied voice not quite so flawlessly. Between the two, Osborne is the more convincing actor. Part of the issue I had with Florez's acting, particularly in the earlier parts of the opera, seems to have been due, at least in part, to the direction. He sings to the audience, not to the object of his affection. At the same time, DiDonato totally inhabits her role. (Was there too little direction, with DiDonato self-directing superbly, and Florez not so much? Or did Florez simply not respond to direction?)

When it comes to the two mezzos, DiDonato runs away with the show. Although we are blessed to have a second mezzo of such excellent quality in Daniela Barcellona, the latter's performance lacks energy.

The Met Orchestra, this time under conductor Michele Mariotti, provides its usual sensitive and virtuosic support.

As it is hard to imagine a more capable cast's coming along soon, if ever, I suggest overlooking the technical flaws of this production (which, as a technology lover, it pains me to say), and enjoy some great Rossini and the dazzling singing on this disc.",1512000000,,3480,4.8207705192629815

I just did not like the opera.  To Rossini I award two stars.  I ordered this one mainly because it is based on Sir Walter Scott.  But the opera is shallow with a silly happy ending - like Fidelio.  Placido Domingo has said that in life he likes to be happy but on the stage he likes to suffer.  Maybe that is why I enjoy Verdi and Domingo so much.  They suffer so beautifully together.
