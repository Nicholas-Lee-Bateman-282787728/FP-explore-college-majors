8225264,5,B000WQWPPK,"I've seen many video, claiming to teach finger style but do not deliver. Well Fred is low keyed and delivers the goods.
Johnny Cash was this singer of the first song I really latched onto as a young child! The song on this video are some great ones!
I walk the line, Big River, Ring of Fire, Folsom Prison Blues, I Guess Things Happen That Way, I Still Miss Someone and more!
It has the PDF of the tabs so put it on the computer and print it out!
Great buy!",1391126400,3,457,4.032967032967033
8225265,4,B000WQWPPK,"Good lesson for intermediate beginner, it provides a base to launch your journey into finger picking lead and accompaniment. And it is Johnny Cash, so the songs are great just to know. Fred is not the best vocalist but you can tell he really loves what he is doing.",1381017600,3,265,4.428571428571429
8225266,5,B000WQWPPK,"This DVD is an instructional DVD in finger picking guitar.  Fred Sokolow's teaching assumes you know most of the the basic first position chords. This was my introduction to finger picking and I was hooked ever since and have ordered many of Fred's DVDs since then.  If you know basic guitar chords, I strongly recommend this to anyone who wants to learn finger picking.  He has another DVD on beginning finger picking which I also strongly recommend.  His teaching style is far better than any other I have tried.",1210377600,10,514,4.741573033707865
