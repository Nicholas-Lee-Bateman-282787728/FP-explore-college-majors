8220416,5,B000VXC0GI,"""Old Friends"" is a sentimental reminder of the roots of Gospel Music and the impact Bill and Gloria Gaither have in nurturing artists and performers in this field.

Among the ""old friends"" featured on this DVD are: Doris Akers, James Blackwood and the Blackwood Brothers, The Cathedrals, The Imperials, Doris Akers, and The Happy Goodman's.

Other favorites I especially enjoyed were: Greg Cook's rendition of ""When He Was on the Cross I was on His Mind,"" Jake Hess's ""Then I Met the Master,"" and Doug Oldham's ""Thanks to Calvary.""

Gloria Gaither's effective narrations and Bill's stories from the early beginnings of many of the featured guests and groups were heartwarming and poignant. Bill paid tribute to Rusty Goodman and interviewed his daughter. I was moved by the authenticity of her testimony.

Throughout the filming at the Gaither studio a genuine spirit of camaraderie, friendship, love, and devotion to Jesus (the very theme of Gospel music) was evident. Good music, enjoyable entertainment, and inspiration.",1296777600,,1023,5.257668711656442
8220417,5,B000VXC0GI,"This is one of the best video/DVD's produced by Bill Gaither.  Many of the people present on the video are no longer living which makes this video special because they are on the video and singing or sharing some of their own songs.  If you want to see many of the movers and shakers of gospel music from the 1940's through the present day, then this is a video that is a must see.  When I use the term ""gospel music"" I am including black gospel and southern gospel together.  On this film you will see Doris Akers, Ira Stanphill, Jake Hess, Howard and Vestal Goodman, the Speer family, James Blackwood, Lillie Knaulls, Jessie Dixon, and many others.  One highlight of the video is when Bill Gaither tries to play gospel accompaniment for Doris Akers and she relieves him at the piano.  It was all in fun and the respect and love between all of these wonderful people is very palpable.  And the Florida Boys singing ""When He Was On The Cross,I Was On His Mind"" is outstanding.  One other piece in this video is unsurpassed and that is when the Mullins sing Fanny Crosby's wonderful song ""My Savior First Of All"" accappella.  It is truly gorgeous and worth listening to again and again.  I could go on about this video.  It is truly worth the buy and is one that you will want to listen to again and again.",1289865600,,1305,4.395833333333333
8220418,5,B000VXC0GI,"One of the earlier Homecoming Series was in 1993, Old Friends.  Gloria Gaither says the greatest treasure is human relationships, deep joyful friendship.  That's what this is about, Old Friends, those in this gospel world who enjoyed each other, the music and spirit of friendship.

Bill Gaithers interviews Vestal and Howard ""I Wouldn't Take Anything for My Journey Now"" about the earlier members of the Happy Goodman family, including Rusty and Sam Goodman who died within a year of each other, both in their early 60s.  Sam Goodman is a prolific Christian songwriter.  Tanya Sykes Goodman, warmly sheds light on her father Rusty.  There is early footage.  Two DVDs on the Goodmans are also available&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Happy-Goodmans-Celebrating-50-Years-of-Marrige-Ministry-and-Music-Gaither-Gospel-Series/dp/B000E9ZGSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Happy Goodmans - Celebrating 50 Years of Marrige, Ministry and Music Gaither Gospel Series</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Tribute-to-Howard-Vestal-Goodman/dp/B0002HODX6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Tribute to Howard & Vestal Goodman</a>.

Doug Oldham sings ""Thanks to Calvary"" and ""Im Free"", and the group is so touched by these songs.  ""I'm Free"" is a beautiful song in more recent concerts by Lynda Randle&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Best-of-Lynda-Randle/dp/B00080ASZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Best of Lynda Randle</a>, a voice to hear.

I first heard the song sung by Johnny Cash.  Writer of ""Suppertime"", Ira Stanphil was too an old timer on the show.

What one can feel from these Old Friends is that there camaraderie, friendship, wholesome respect.  The Friends reach out to one another, they console each other, they offer praise and appreciaton.  A young member Steven Weatherford talks about his being 6 yrs. old and remembering a visit to Gloria Gaither.  You will hear a young Russ Taff.

The Fairfield Four,  The Mullins, Brian Stoker from the Jordanaires, The Speer Family, ""All Aboard""; Doris Akers, ""Sweet Jesus"", Bob Crews.

A touching moment for Jake Hess ""Then I Met the Master"" was to hear Vestal urge everyone to pray for him with his health issue.  Florida Boys newer member Greg Cook ""When He Was on the Cross, I Was On His Mind"" recites how he is honored to be among the best, those who paved the way.

Other music ""Jesus Is coming Soon""; ""Ole Gospel Ship""; ""Is My Lord Satisfied"";  That's Enough"";  ""Some Glad Day""; ""He Is Here""  and many more.  There is a lot of wonderful music here.
