837909,3,6304291752,"After 4 years of working out on a Nordic Track, 3 to 4 times a week, I was bored out of my mind.  I thought my motivation was gone, until I checked out Leslie's 2 mile walk.  She keeps you motivated, and the time goes by  very fast.  You can bump up or slow down the intensity on your own, giving  yourself as intense of a work-out as you want to handle. The music, and the  mile guides are very helpful.  She makes it easy for somebody with two left  feet!  I wish she'd come out with a 3 mile tape too.",954806400,14,504,3.8627450980392157

837911,4,6304291752,"I loved Sansone's 15 minute-one mile walk video so much that I've decided to go for the 30 minute-two-mile walk.  Although Sansone's attitude and personality are very motivating, I found that the music was a bit (just a  bit) disappointing to my taste.  Also, a few of the movements were not so  impressive.  Overall, it's a good video tape, and I'm glad that I found  Sansone through amazon.com.",950140800,5,396,4.75
837912,5,6304291752,This video was wonderful.  The directions are great and the music is wonderful.  I really have enjoyed working to this adn like the walking videos.

837913,3,6304291752,"I was quite disappointed in this video. I should have just dusted my old Jane Fonda tapes off and used those instead. This is really nothing more than low-impact aerobics. The workout itself was fine and the pace fast  enough for anyone looking to get their heart rate up. If you buy this  thinking that it is some new revolutionary way to work out....don't be  fooled because it's not. If you are looking for a well-rounded tape, find a  nice low-impact tape with floor exercises and you will be much better off.",948067200,4,513,4.543478260869565

837916,5,6304291752,"I feel like I've really done something good for myself. I worked out to this video for the first time today and I made it all the way through! It was a little tough. Some of the steps were a little confusing, but Leslie  was quick to tell you that you could walk in place if you were didn't like  the move. She was encouraging and the other people in the video looked like  normal people, not Barbie dolls. When I master this tape, I definitely plan  to buy more of her videos. Even I (with a full time job, husband and six  year old son) can make time for a 30 minute workout 4 times a week!",928540800,17,592,3.983050847457627

837984,3,6304291752,"I'm a senior, and Leslie Sansone's 2 mile walk is just what I need for cardio exercise. I bought my Two Mile Walk from Goodwill Bookworks and it had some surface scratching.  The disc button was half broken, which could explain why the disc is scratched since it won't fit and hold properly, sliding around in the box.  The box itself was alright, however, and the CD was shipped carefully. I sprayed Rain X on the disc and buffed it and it plays without a hitch, although it might have played well anyway. I will put the disc in a plastic sandwich bag to protect its surface from now on.  The box condition and scratching lowered my rating.",1373587200,,641,4.415254237288136

I have biggest loser powerwalk and walk your belly flat which can be a bit tiring but I needed something a lil more. Well this was a WORKOUT. I've lost 70lbs in the past 9mos and this thing kicked my butt. I was out of breath, tired, exhausted and had to push through only made it to 1.25 mile.

837986,5,6304291752,"I've owned quite a few Leslie Sansone tapes. This one is the workout I always default to when I'm short on time. I can always make room in my busy schedule for this one, and feel energized afterwards. Please note that I have chronic sciatica pain due to a bulging disc in my lower spine, and there are certain exercises (such as Pilates) that exasperate that condition. Not so with walk aerobics. These workouts are fantastic and do not leave me in pain. When I switched from VHS to DVD format, this one plus her 4-mile Super Challenge were the 2 Leslie Sansone workouts I replaced. Highly recommended!",1308528000,2,602,4.583333333333333

837988,4,6304291752,"I've had this VHS version for years. I normally walk outside as I love the fresh air, hills, beach, trees, flowers, scenery (choose one)! However when I cannot get outside this walk is a nice substitute. It's much easier, though, than walking outside so you might need to step it up by adding weights or doing extra exaggerated moves.
Would be great for a beginner as well! Enjoy!!",1241222400,2,381,4.617647058823529
837989,4,6304291752,I had a lot of trouble with this DVD because I am very clutzy. She went into new moves with almost no warning and they definitely require dexterity. I just couldn't do most of it the first few times. But what I could do got me sweating and I think if I keep at it I will get the hang of it after awhile.  I think it is more challenging than most of her newer DVD's.,1236988800,,365,3.8026315789473686
837990,5,6304291752,"This dvd is great if you prefer to walk indoors on any given day.

837991,4,6304291752,"I have several Leslie Sansone walking videos.  But this older one I first rented from the library and found it to be my favorite so I bought it to keep.  It has simple moves that I can use to almost any kind of upbeat music.  I also like the fact that Leslie has thin and huskier-types of individuals doing the workout.  The mile-marker is also an encouragement for me.  There is a little of the chatter that goes on, but I've learned to tune it out. This is a good basic workout that you can do right in your own living room.  No excuse for bad weather!",1212624000,,554,4.130841121495327

I have just gotten back into exercising after dropping out of it for awhile and this DVD is just what I was looking for!  I am in my early 50s and overweight and can easily get through the first mile and the cool-down period.  Once I become more fit, I'm sure I'll be able to get through two miles and the cool-down period.  I highly recommend this wonderful DVD!  It's my fourth Leslie Sansone tape/DVD and a keeper!",1209945600,2,567,4.242990654205608
838053,4,6304291752,This fast paced 2 mile walkaerobics workout is fast and effective.  Leslie's cuing of the steps makes this easy to follow. Leslie announces each quarter mile accomplished as it is shown on the bottom of the screen. Her encouragement and upbeat personality makes me continue to 2 miles when I get tempted to stop at one mile.  As a beginning exerciser I find her friendly personality to be encouraging. This is a program I would recommend to anyone who wants to feel enthusiastic about doing the workout and energetic when their finished.  I am looking forward to progressing to Leslie's 3 mile workout.,1196726400,,602,4.825242718446602

838055,5,6304291752,I have several of Leslie Sansone's tapes but this is my favorite.  It's easy to do and keeps you moving.  It's was a little challenging in parts for me at the beginning but now it's easier and it's fast.  Before you know it - time is up!  I've recommended this one to several people.  I love being able to work out at home and I don't need huge space to do this.  Way to go Leslie!,1185667200,2,381,3.9473684210526314
838056,5,6304291752,"I hate exercise! I'd much rather read a book rather then get sweaty from working out. But...I love Sansone's exercise programs. I bought the older adult DVD and did that for a couple weeks. Liked it very much. Went onto to purchase the 1 Mile/2 Mile combo DVD. Huffed and puffed my way through the 1 mile program until it was easy, took me a couple weeks, now I'm using the 2 mile program. Back to huffing and puffing but I am getting there. I don't use the weights as I have some medical conditions, but the aerobic workout is gentle; and I feel so GOOD after completing the programs. It also helps to see how Leslie Sansone cheerily encourages us to work out and says it's OK to slow down, if needed. Just listening to Leslie is like a dose of sunshine and encouragement.",1154390400,,773,4.337931034482758
838057,5,6304291752,"I'm a 15 year old, not very active girl. My mom introduced me to the Walk Away The Pounds videos and I loved them. I didn't have to go outside to walk (this was great during winter), and it didn't even bother my school and social life But recently, I was getting totally bored of the moves and music.

A week ago I got this tape, and oh gosh!!! The first time was pretty confusing because the pace is much faster and there are many new movements(Instead of just knee lifts, you do 2 steps and a knee lift while raising your arms). But the next time I did the workout, it was great! It's a much more intense workout and there's a lot more moves, so you'll never get bored! I was so into it, I laughed at how fast I walked 2 miles !!!! :)",1153267200,6,736,4.006802721088436
838058,5,6304291752,"This is my favorite Leslie Sansone dvd.  I know it's an old one and some of the moves are out of date. The thing is, though, is that it works to tone and lose weight.

I actually like the grapevine and kickbacks.  It's fun and seems to be over in a snap.  It's a good workout to do every day or if you're a walker and it's raining.",1152921600,7,331,3.823529411764706
838059,5,6304291752,"I would have thought these kind of workouts would be boring and ineffective and therefore I've honestly never bought one of her workouts before.  However, something made me choose this (a break from what I normally do maybe) and I really really like it and enjoy it.  I suppose she wouldn't be the big hit she is if she was no good.  She's outgoing and motivating and I'm pleasantly surprised.

This doesn't use fancy shmancy moves or anything too tricky, but it's still so effective.  You get the fat burning benefits of fat burning walk (2 miles at that) at home - whether it's raining, boiling hot or snowing outside.  This is an excellent way to get your fitness level up so you can go ahead and do more progressive workouts soon.  She uses marches, side steps, taps etc and get your heart rate up and burn fat.  The other exercisers are real-life weight loss winners.  It's refreshing to see real people workout out.

Give this a go; I think you'll find it better going than you might have thought.  For an experienced exerciser like myself, I still found benefits from this.",1148256000,8,1080,4.572916666666667
838060,5,6304291752,"When I first tried this DVD I found is frustrating and difficult.  I expected it to be more like Leslie Sansone's other DVDs that I had been using:  the Walk Away the Pounds 1 and 2 mile, and the Miracle Mile.  This workout is from the same set as Miracle Mile and has the same participants.  This set is from the early 90s and it shows in their clothing and the music.

What's different is the variety in movement.  This is much closer to a regular hi/lo aerobics video than a walking video.  There is still walking, but there is more movement around the room, more variety in steps, and more mixing up the steps.  For example, we would do two knee lifts, then two kick backs.  Or we'd do a grapevine, knee lift, march, grapevine knee lift.  It still wasn't too complex, though.  There was also more moving around the room.  I did her other workouts in my bedroom; for this one I had to move to our more spacious living room.  Finally, it's more intense than her other workouts.  You actually finish the two miles in 25 minutes, but there are around five minutes of cool down after that.

So at first these changes annoyed me.  I put the workout away and continued to practice with her other workouts.  Then I got bored of those and picked this one up again.  Surprise, surprise, I loved it.  I enjoyed the changes, the variety.  It was a good next step for a challenge.  If you're totally new to exercise, I recommend her Walk Away the Pounds 1 and 2 mile set, which are simpler, but if you're looking for something a bit more challenging, but still only 30 minutes, this is it.",1117584000,9,1580,4.342465753424658
838061,4,6304291752,This is a good workout for those who enjoy the Walk Away the Pounds videos/dvds.  It is more intense than the WATP 2 mile and at the one mile point has a speed of 5 mph. I wish Leslie would do more aerobics only videos.,1112227200,4,219,3.8666666666666667
838062,5,6304291752,"I purchased this and the Miracle Mile together. Both are good. The Miracle Mile is good for days when we are short of time and energy. It takes only 15 to 20 minutes. But the 2 Miles programme is one of Leslie's best videos. I have also tried many of her other videos,but I always seem to come back to this 2 mile video. It has a variety of moves which keep you going till you realise the 2 miles is over. It has a good pace and makes you sweat. The meter which tells us the time and distance covered is also helpful. I would also like to add that Leslie's walking programmes have kept me consistent with exercise. I would recommend this to anyone who may want to start some aerobic exercise. The steps are not as difficult as other aerobic programmes and are easy to follow. Also the programme is low impact for people who may not be able to do any high impact aerobics.",1102032000,10,871,4.190476190476191
838115,5,6304291752,"A combination of eating healthy foods and doing this video helped me lose twenty-five pounds in a month and a half.  This is exactly what I needed to keep me moving.  This video is not for experienced marathon runners or people that want super high-impact workouts.  the movements were not hard to get and they are not ""dancy"" like other aerobic video workouts.

I would wake up every morning and do this workout for 30 minutes every day.  Doing these workouts helped me to sleep better, gave me more energy, and helped me to feel better about myself!!  Thirty minutes a day is not a lot at all and I found myself doing these workouts whenever I was bored or had extra time on my hands.  This video looks a little outdated and the music might be a little cheesy for some of the younger crowd, but it works and that is what really matters.  I urge anyone that is concerned about their health or wants to lose weight to give this video a try.

You DON'T need to get the one mile walk first.  The DVD allows for one to finish the first mile and skip to the cool down very easily.  Try this!!  THIS is  a miracle weight loss program.  It helped me realize that exercise and proper diet is the ONLY way to lose weight and stay healthy.  I've moved on to other videos by Leslie, but I still use this video.  It's great!",1093824000,9,1313,4.255060728744939
838116,5,6304291752,This is one of the BEST exercise videos I've used.  It's easy on the joints but works out the whole body with a friendly group.  Leslie is motivating but not loud; just offers easy encouragement.  The 30 minutes goes by quickly!,1060300800,6,228,4.512195121951219
838117,5,6304291752,"This is my favorite excercise video. I've been using the VHS tape version for years, and now I have it on DVD! Naturally, the DVD version is much more convenient to use as I can go directly to the portion I need without fast forwarding or rewinding the tape when I'm done.
For a klutz like me, Leslie Sansone has been a God send. Even when I've been at my heaviest, this video was possible to do. And yet even though it is easy with no complicated dance steps, it certainly works! No matter what my level of fitness is, this video gets my heart pumping!
Leslie is upbeat, positive, and encouraging. When she smiles directly at the camera and says ""Good!"" I feel she is talking to me! The exercisers who join her on the video are regular people, not all of whom are at the peak of perfection, which makes me feel right at home. Finally, the exercises take very little room, so I can do the video in a spare bedroom or in the living room.
I've never gotten tired of this video, but just to expand my exercise horizons, I've also ordered several more Leslie Sansone DVDs.",1059609600,8,1068,4.318407960199005

838122,3,6304291752,"If you are a veteran of the Walk Away The Pounds 2-mile walk, you will have no problem completing this two-mile, 30-minute walk. It is a do-able supplement to the Walk Away workouts, for days when you don't want to use weights and need a little more variety. This DVD does not have any strength training, and uses very little in the way of arm movements.
However, there are a few things that really date this DVD. Be aware that this is a re-released old workout from 1992. The music is very dated. Leslie is also continually referring to using a VCR with the workout: ""Fast forward to the cool down"" or ""if you didn't catch this step, rewind and do it again."" The clothes and hair styles also really date this DVD, from the ""big sock"" look to the layered leotards.
The moves themselves are more complicated than her Walk Away workout. For example, she has you doing several variations on side steps - lots and lots of 80's style grapevines, stepping to the corners at an angle, and even backwards.
The bonus features on this DVD include a short biography of Leslie (non-interactive), and a URL link to Current Video (the manufacturer). The DVD features a three-minute introduction, where the walkers themselves are interviewed about the walking workouts and their success with them. Leslie then introduces the walkers (the same walkers as the ""Miracle Mile"" DVD). What I really appreciate about Leslie's choice of walkers is that they are ""real"" people. One of the walkers lost over 100 pounds!

While I really appreciate Leslie's Walk Away Workouts, I find this release to still need some tweaking (how about a make over?). I only use it occassionally, to throw some variety into my workouts. If you're bored, and looking for something else to try with Leslie, give this a go.",1043193600,10,1777,4.713826366559486

Leslie can be a bit goofy at times, but she gets you through two miles with ease and sweat.  It is worth the money.  Go for it.",1043020800,5,455,4.090909090909091

838167,5,6304291752,"I generally don't relish ""walking exercise"" programs for your home. What it turns out to be is a simple mid-level intensity workout aimed to lose weight.

Leslie Sansone has been a champion instructor and advocate for walking as a critical form of exercise, and she offers a variation of workout videos on walking. But here, walk in the comfort of your own home.

The 1996 approximately 35 minute tape has a warmup of about 4 minutes. The 2-mile walk is total of 25 minutes 2 miles at 4 mph. After the 25 minutes, a slow down with stretch. The meter displayed that pops up periodically to give you an idea how many minutes and how far in proximity to mileage you have accomplished per hour.

As you participate, you can watch a meter that displays time, distance, and miles per hour. The ""walk"" consists of exercise marching steps, grapevine, kickback, walk and tap. This isn't vigorous at all, what is pleasing is that there aren't any complicated steps, and Leslie isn't constantly incorporating changes to confuse us.

The video is unpretentious, average looking people in normal workout attire. Music is paced to the workout, but nothing compares like selecting your own. If you prefer to lose weight, get outdoors, do fast aerobic walking, pick some motivating rhythmic music on for the walkman, and move!!! But if the cold keeps you in, this is a great alternative......MzRizz.",1024790400,10,1383,4.8474576271186445

I am not intimdated by the usual ""models"" that some fitness tapes seem to use. People come in all shapes and sizes and leslie seems to know this fact.

I probably wouldn't have even tried it if my Denise Austin video hadn't broken. But this video is 100 times better! It has a counter that pops up at every quarter mile, half mile, mile, etc. which is great for keeping you motivated to keep on walking. My husband and I did just a mile, and then fast forwarded it to the cool-down as she suggested. She's also wearing a very modest outfit- not some skimpy bathing suit/leotard, and she has several other people on the video with her of all shapes and sizes, who have supposedly done her program and lost weight. At the beginning of the tape there is about five minutes, if  that, if testimonials- which is kind of annoying, because after the first time of watching them, you don't really want to watch them over and over again.

The workout lasts approx. 29 minutes, including a 4-minute warm-up and a 4-minute cool down.  Sansone's cues are great, and the footwork is not at all complicated, so it's appropriate for beginners and intermediates.  At one point, the beat is pretty fast, and I feel like I'm just flinging my arms around with momentum, rather than really using controlled muscles, but it definitely gets my heart pumping, and that's the intent.  She offers next to nothing in the way of toning exercises, and stretching is practically non-existent in both the warm-up and the cool-down, so you'll have to do that on your own.  For a more complete, balanced workout, I'd recommend alternating this video with one that offers more firming and toning exercises (e.g. ab work, leg lifts, etc.), but this one is great for those interested solely in a cardio program.",1000771200,7,966,4.938271604938271

Let's put it this way, all the other videos I have tried make me feel like a cow and that makes me feel like I just can't do it anymore...but not Leslie's video...she makes me feel great, makes me want to keep going even when I want to quit!

I had gained back 3 pounds (from eating BAD foods one weekend) and dropped 3.5 in a few days.  The exercise really makes the difference no matter what diet you are on.  She does tend to get annoying at times, but that is because she is getting tired in the middle, you can just tell.  I like having the meter pop up and tell you how far you have gone too.  It helps to keep me going. It's a great video for all.  I started with only doing the feet part then finally started using my arms after about 4 days.  I am uncoordinated when it comes to arms and legs.  But, this actually starts to feel like a dance after you do it about 10 times.  I would recommend it to anyone it works well.

It moves quickly, with little need for instruction because the movements are all very basic, but it gets the heart rate going pretty well.  Leslie gets a tiny bit annoying, but anybody who is perky at 5:30 AM can get annoying.  She does not concentrate enough on form - about 20 minutes into the tape she tells you to ""blow out"", where other exercise videos really remind you how important it is to keep breathing.

I complete 3-mile walks outdoors in 45 minutes (that's about 4 mph) and yet this workout raised my heart rate like my outdoor walks have never done.  In the sense that the moves are simple, it could be considered a beginner's tape.  But, if you're looking for a nice energy boost without having to follow complex moves, this is the perfect tape.  It's brief enough that you won't be tempted to blow it off because of time issues, and the simplicity of the moves are a pleasure if you exercise first thing in the morning.

A more advanced exerciser can use this tape in addition to another tape or on a day when a less rigorous workout is needed. I enjoyed the workout. I have a number of intense, dancy tapes and I was looking for something that was simple and quick. Leslie varies her step enough to prevent boredom but not so much that you have trouble keeping up. Side taps, basic marches, grapevines just simple steps. The conversation is easy and encouraging.

I enjoy this video quite a bit and use it in various combinations with the other videos I've purchased by Leslie.  In my opinion, this is the most intensly aerobic video she has made to date. The workout is a two mile ""walk"" in 25 minutes, filled with a lot of low impact moves such as sidesteps, grapevines, arm movements and other cardio raising moves you can do in four square feet in front of you television. It is cardio focused with toning a low second place. There are two parts of the video that may be hard on delicate knees, so keep that in mind.  If you're concerned about knees, you may want to start with her ""Over 40"" video; a 30 minute/ 2 mile workout that is very good, but less intense - perhaps start with that and move up to this ""2 Mile"" video.  I found I did better when I did that. If you want a lot of toning and cross-training focus I recommend her ""In-Home Walking"" video, a 20 minute mile with hand weights or ""Walk and Firm: Fat Burner"" video, a 35 minute, 2 mile walk/cross training video with timed intervals of aerobic and weight training (using hand weights).  Of course, a great addition is her ""Miracle Mile"" video, great for that short, intense burst of cardio (15 minutes) for those days on the run.

7867501,4,6304291752,"A review for the rest of us, hopefully.

I'd rate this workout as beginner to low-average fitness.  You can start with a shorter workout and work up to the two miles if you're a beginner.  I'm probably low-average, and the two-mile workout gets me sweating and tired but not exhausted.

Pro:  It isn't a room full of 84-pound supermodels.
Con:  It's an older video, so there are no men, in spite of there being one on the back cover.

Pro:  No one's asking you to do cartwheels.
Con:  ""No dancy moves"" depends a lot on your definition of ""dancy.""  That's more a function of coordination than of fitness.  I spent a lot of time kicking myself in the ankles until I returned to less-coordinated moves.

Pro:  The instructor is very non-saccharine compared to most.
Con:  It gets a little more intolerable when she starts chatting with the other people.  It's bad enough that they don't respond, which is actually pretty funny.

Pro:  There is some accommodation of varying levels of fitness and coordination.  She tells you to go back to a regular walk if the moves are too complex or difficult.
Con:  No one among the people working out behind her does that, so there's no one to follow if you do.  That problem is compounded by....

Pro:  You can hear the instructor clearly.
Con:  The music, not so much.  This is a problem if you do go back to walking from another move; it's hard to keep pace using only the music.

Pro:  You get a reasonably good stretch during the routine.
Con:  Some of the moves aren't so great for the knees.  That's a problem of the workout's age, too; a couple of the moves probably wouldn't appear, or would be modified, in a more modern workout.  There's no warning given for them.

Pro:  Everyone does the moves just a bit differently, so you will probably find someone to follow who moves similarly to you.
Con:  It very well may not be the instructor.  Her legwarmers match her shoes, and the white-on-white lack of contrast sometimes makes her footwork hard to follow.

Summary:  A good workout for the beginner-to-average person if you know your limitations and are prepared to adjust for them without guidance.",1438905600,,2145,4.61436170212766
