633482,4,6303394043,"Finaly The Man with the One Red shoe on DVD.What took so long?It's a Tom Hanks film! Well beter late then never. Tom Hanks play a musician mistaken for a spy,plus his best friend played by Jim Belushi thinks he is having an afair with his wife played by Star Wars star Carrie Fisher. Cant wait to add this movie to my DVD collection!",1091318400,,333,4.21875
633483,4,6303394043,"There is a competition of sorts between two groups of people in the CIA headed by the two bosses (Dabney Coleman and Charles Durney).  One group sets the other up by claiming they have a spy/mole with some important information and that he's coming in on a certain plane.  They leak the information by deliberately talking into the bugs they found planted by the other team.  There is no one, but when part of their team goes to the airport, with the other team sets up with their men there to discover who the informant is, the team that has put the plan in motion, randomly picks out an unsuspecting passenger getting off a plane who just happens to be wearing one red shoe, which is Tom Hanks.  They pretend to make contact and then, Tom Hanks, completely unaware of anything unusual is now under surveilence.
Tom Hanks is a musician who travels to different countries playing with a concert.  He and his friend and his friend's wife (who has the hots for him) have just returned from one of his trips.
He is tracked and followed by both teams, one to spy on him and the other to try and protect him, his place is turned upside down, a beautiful agent is sent to get close to him, his friend's wife is hitting on him, wanting him to go to bed with him.  She likes to play Tarzan in bed and makes some wild noises, which is recorded by Dabney's team and later heard by the wife's husband as they play the recording in their van and he thinks she's in it, and so on...  You get the picture.  Lot of things going on all the time.  The whole time Tom Hanks is completely unaware of any of this and is falling for the beautiful blond.  Not a whole lot of depth, but a fun little movie and actually has parts in it that are quite believable in this day and age.  Enjoy!",1084406400,5,1766,4.25748502994012
633484,4,6303394043,"I love this little movie.  Carrie Fisher looks even hotter than she did in that bikini thing in Jabba's lair.  Very funny writing and directing.  The photography is excellent and the broadcast print has aged very well.  It looks more like an early 90's movie, with only the blonde seeming a bit 80's.  Surprisingly, this is an ensemble cast.  Hanks, though at the center of all the action, is sharing time with a lot of other talent.  From beginning to end I think this film works.",1081900800,9,481,4.523255813953488
633485,1,6303394043,"I had high hopes for this one when it was released; the original French movie 'The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe' is one of my favorite comedies, and hey, who doesn't like Tom Hanks?
But this remake is streets apart from that - for all the mayhem in the common plot of intelligence intrigue and unwitting decoys, the remake plays it lots meaner and uglier than the original...and then is downright prudish on the sexual angles that made the original a pleasing adult comedy.
Maybe if you never saw the original you can like or tolerate this one. As for me...Sacre bleu, it stinks.",1064793600,8,585,4.528301886792453
633486,3,6303394043,"I have fond memories of this movie from my late adolescence. True, it is hard to keep track of which thugs work for which side, but in the end, who cares? The trouble Tom Hanks gets them into by innocently going about his own business is great! Jim Belushi has some great moments too, later on in the film. I laughed out loud for several gags, and can watch the movie more than once.",1029024000,8,383,4.1891891891891895
633487,3,6303394043,"Overall a nice movie ... but, not great. The story line is a bit confusing. You'll need to see the beginning 15 minutes several a couple times and read the jacket before knowing who's who and what it's all about. Belushi and Hanks both have some wonderful moments that make the film worth seeing and owning.",1008115200,3,307,4.5
633488,3,6303394043,"A cleverly written spy thriller spoof and comedy with lots of good talent.  It is worth watching and entertaining, but far from a great film.  Hanks plays all his characters in a believable fashion and I have yet watched a film that he is in with regret.  A mild recommendation.",1005436800,2,278,4.52
633489,5,6303394043,"I loved this movie!  It's novel, fresh and outrageously funny! I want to  see it released on DVD so I can enjoy it for years!",968025600,2,125,3.96
633490,3,6303394043,"As one of Tom Hanks' earlier comedy pieces, I found it to be somewhat entertaining although not altogether believable.  The performances by the supporting cast (i.e., James Belushi, Carrie Fisher, Dabney Coleman, Lori  Singer, etc.) help make the movie more palpable, but not a movie that I  would view over and over again.",916012800,,323,5.056603773584905

633685,5,6303394043,"Dabney Coleman is sort of a renegade CIA inside the CIA he has to eliminate those that know. Through a series of misdirections he is convinced that Richard (Tom Hanks) is the informant that knows his secret. Naturally Tom is innocent. Now watch as Richard unknowingly brushes with death several times. Will this ever get cleared up and what happens to the different parties in this cat and mouse game.

This is one of Tom Hanks's best. It may get lost in the total of his movies. However it is a must see. I did not see the French movie ""The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe"" this is supposed to be a remake of, yet given the cast and their enthusiasm in the movie it could only be an improvement. It was interesting that Richard (Tom Hanks) and Morris (James Belushi) used bicycles for transportation. Many parts of the film would not have worked if they were in automobiles or on foot.

I guess the moral of this story is that you have to watch your feet.",1501027200,2,959,4.351955307262569

633897,3,6303394043,"I find it odd that Carrie Fisher is the only star whose name shows up with this title in the list of things I need to review. Apparently Tom Hanks's leading roll wasn't a big a deal back then, although his name shows up with the title in the graphic. In any case, this was a fun movie when it came out years ago. It does not hold my teenagers' attention in 2016. They sat all the way through Oscar (Sylvester Stalone) and have asked for it again, so they aren't entirely opposed to 1980s movies. My wife and I enjoyed The Man with One Red Shoe anyway. The scene when Tom Hanks returns home from the dentist and just accepts his mixed up bathroom is good enough to make the whole movie worth watching.",1475366400,4,700,4.192592592592592

Tom Hanks is the center of attention, to the surprise of none, as his usual aloof '80s bachelor in search of more than just another one-night stand. His character's unfortunate choice of footwear on a long flight leaves him tangled in a web of espionage and deceit; a hapless patsy in a high-stakes game of cloak and dagger. Jim Belushi and Carrie Fisher support, in roles that don't really go anywhere or mean anything, and work no miracles with the base-level material. It's an unfocused film with no ambition, no personality and a bald, spell-it-out sense of humor that's better for eye rolls than snickers.

(Dabney Coleman's) group knows the CIA Director suspects them, and so has bugged the home and garden of the CIA Director to try and dig up dirt on him, and also sets-up the Director to take the fall on the drug deal.

The film opens with the two rival groups trying to pin a drug deal, in progress, on one another.

The CIA-Director, who is also a bad-guy, decides to have some fun with his rival. He targets a person at random (Tom Hanks) and gives the rival group the impression that (Tom Hanks) is a spy carrying the evidence needed to convict (Dabney Coleman's) group.

(Tom Hanks) is totally unaware of all this. (Dabney Coleman's) group spends the rest of the film trying to find the evidence (Tom Hanks) must have in his apartment, and trying to capture, and later kill (Tom Hanks). Meanwhile, a few good guys in the CIA give (Tom Hanks) a little help, unbeknownst to him, when needed.

(Tom Hanks) begins the film wearing one red shoe, because his best friend plays practical jokes on him, and left him with mismatched shoes.

A clever comedy.

The film talks about sex in a couple scenes with scantily clad women. These scenes are funny; are meant to be funny; and you know from the set-up in the previous scene they will be funny. They have a funny atmosphere rather than a sexual atmosphere.

634460,3,6303394043,"I agree with the reviewer who said that Tom Hanks is always good.  Aside from Lori Singer, the rest of the cast is good in this movie, too.  If I were just rating the cast members, I'd give it 5 stars for sure.  But Lori Singer does not pull off her role convincingly.  She tries too hard to ""act"" her part, and it just seems forced.  And, even though I LOVE Tom Hanks, his ability to fake play the violin is bad enough to be painful! lol... The story is alright, but there are some terrible scenes that are so bad that you can't even find the humor in them.  It does have it's funny moments, though, and if you can follow the sometimes-confusing story line, it is a pretty good movie over all.  Tom Hanks' character reminds me of him in Splash but with a different story.  When he's screaming for Maddy, he sounded exactly like he did in Splash when he was screaming for Madison.

So, basically it's a great cast with a so-so story line, but it's probably one I'd watch again.  It's nothing too heavy, which is nice once in awhile.  And I loved seeing David Ogden Stiers in his small role.  He always amazes me in anything I've ever seen him in.  Same with Edward Herrmann and Tom Noonan.  It certainly could have been much better with such a great cast, although I have to say that Carrie Fisher's character got on my nerves, which was probably her intention, so her part was well acted, too.

634464,3,6303394043,"In this movie Mr. Ross (Charles Durning) is the Director of CIA, working with Mr. Brown (Ed Herrmann) - have 48 hrs until a senate hearing regarding one of his agents being caught smuggling drugs.  Agent Cooper (Dabney Coleman) and agent Maddy (Lori Singer - Darryl Hannah look alike) are on a team of CIA agents working against Ross & Brown.  Ross is aware Cooper is on him - so to throw Cooper off his trail he says something to the bugs planted in his residence by Cooper to lead Cooper to believe his agents are going to be meeting someone important at the airport.  He sends Brown there to pick any person out of the crowds at the airport and speak with him, knowing Cooper's people will assume that person is some type of spy and waste their time/effort tailing/investigating that random person - while Ross does whatever he needs to before the senate hearing.

Tom Hanks for some reason comes off the plane wearing a dress shoe and a red tennis shoe, due to some joke played on him by fellow orchestra pal ""Morris"" (James Belushi), so they pick him as the random person and simply shake his hand and let things run their course.

Hanks, as always, makes the most of his roles and is always enjoyable. The story is fairly amusing but also fairly stupid.  In the end I was left wondering what the deal really was.  What was Dir. Ross trying to do that made it necessary to throw agent Cooper off his trail with Tom Hanks - and who was really behind the drug smuggling? So I couldn't give it a 4-star rating.

A young Tom Hanks seems all at sea in the barely-defined lead, Lori Singer overdoes the icy professionalism to zombie-like extremes as his leading lady while a capable supporting cast (Jim Belushi, Charles Durning, Edward Herrmann, Carrie Fisher, Tom Noonan, David Ogden Stiers) have too little to do and even less of it close to funny under Stan Dragoti's leaden direction that misses what few comic opportunities remain in Robert Klane's script through lazy staging. Only Dabney Coleman's ruthlessly ambitious CIA bigwig makes much of an impression, and he's just diligently ploughing the well-furrowed field of arrogant institutional SOBs that were his 80s stock-in-trade. Not so much obnoxiously bad, more utterly pointless, it's a film that really seems to have no reason to exist or be watched.",1284076800,2,1209,5.1421319796954315

However, there is one scene I will never forget. Hanks' character was performing. The femme fatale who was sent to do ill to him by the CIA was in the audience, and Hanks' character was gaga over her. The orchestra began Rimsky-Korsakov's Shaherazade. Those of you familiar with that symphony will know that after a brief intro, a solo violin part comes in. When it came time for Hanks' character to play it, he instead played a piece he composed for the femme fatale! David Ogden Stiers' was playing the conductor. He stopped the orchestra, turned to him and said ""Tonight we are playing 'Shaherazade.' Would you care to join us?""

Little things like the fake peanuts his friend (of the red-shoe trick) slips him become objects of obsession for the agents following him. There are also several hysterical scenes where a sexy female agent tries varied tricks to get him to reveal his secrets...except he *has* no information and so doesn't reveal anything- but gets a reputation as a cool operator for not losing his head and saying anything. Watching his friend think he's going insane as he spots (and is knocked out) by the agents following Richard while Richard is oblivious is very funny; some of the best scenes in the movie!

Sure, the plot is somewhat predictable, but it's a lighthearted comedy - and almost makes it even funnier with the anticipation of the next gag. The supporting cast is also excellent, with the likes of Dabney Coleman (it was illegal in the Eighties to make a light comedy in which he did not appear), Carrie Fisher in a small but funny role, and my favorite James Belushi, who was great in his role.

634646,3,6303394043,"Only the third movie of Tom Hanks' illustrious career, The Man With One Red Shoe is a hilarious comedy about a case of mistaken identity. With a star studded cast that includes not only Hanks, but also Dabney Coleman, James Belushi, and Carrie Fisher, The Man With One Red Shoe is a decent slapstick comedy that appears on cable television from time to time. Not exactly the greatest film in history, it is a fun and entertaining movie well worth the time involved...

When top level CIA operatives Cooper (Dabney Coleman) and Ross (Charles Durning) fight out a personal turf battle, Ross sends Cooper on a wild goose chase to find a fictional witness who can clear his name of some impending charges. Using planted information from a wire tap, Cooper stakes out the local airport in an effort to find the mysterious man...

Meanwhile, Richard (Tom Hanks) is wearing mismatched shoes (one of them red, thus The Man With One Red Shoe) because his friend Morris (James Belushi) played a practical joke on him. But the joke takes an odd twist when a CIA agent spies Richard's odd shoe pairing and fingers him as the target of their stakeout. In an effort to find out what the man with one red shoe knows, Cooper puts a tail on Richard, sparking a strange sequence of events which leaves the bike-riding violin player questioning his sanity.

But the snafu really turns serious when Cooper assigns top agent Maddy (Lori Singer) to the case. Maddy gets close to Richard (who easily falls in love with her). Cooper thinks he's getting closer to the information he needs when the unthinkable occurs - his top agent falls for Richard...

Tom Hanks plays the lead role to the best of his ability, playing the part of a character type he has totally mastered - the clueless, out-of-the-loop guy. He played similar roles in Big and Forrest Gump, but irrespective of those roles, Hanks is generally outstanding in any role which he's assigned. The Man With One Red Shoe is no exception. Hanks comes across as a genuine and likeable character, totally oblivious to the events which transpire around him.

Based solely on a case of mistaken identity, The Man With One Red Shoe is an interesting concept for a film. Despite stretching the limits of reality, the film nevertheless manages to remains within the boundaries of the sane and normal. The movie isn't over the top or utterly ridiculous like so many comedies of today. Instead, the lead characters remain serious while the circumstances of their situation provide the humor. A light-hearted and fun film, providing an early glimpse of Tom Hanks' much heralded career, makes The Man With One Red Shoe a definite must-see movie...
